https://openalex.org/W2121542842,"A strong transcription enhancer was identified in the genomic DNA (235 kb) of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a ubiquitous and severe pathogen of the herpesvirus group. Cotransfection of enhancerless SV40 DNA with randomly fragmented HCMV DNA yielded two SV40-HCMV recombinant viruses that had incorporated overlapping segments of HCMV DNA to substitute for the missing SV40 enhancer. Within HCMV, these enhancer sequences are located upstream of the transcription initiation site of the major immediate-early gene, between nucleotides -118 and -524. Deletion studies with the HCMV enhancer, which harbors a variety of repeated sequence motifs, show that different subsets of this enhancer can substitute for the SV40 enhancer. The HCMV enhancer, which seems to have little cell type or species preference, is severalfold more active than the SV40 enhancer. It is the strongest enhancer we have analyzed so far, a property that makes it a useful component of eukaryotic expression vectors."

https://openalex.org/W1994810131,"We have constructed five new temperature-sensitive DNA topoisomerase II mutations and have analyzed their physiological consequences in yeast. Several lines of evidence suggest that the activity of topoisomerase II is required specifically at the time of miosis. First, top2 mutations cause dramatic lethality at the restrictive temperature, but only if the mutant cells are actively traversing the cell cycle. Second, temperature-shift experiments with synchronized cultures show that the onset of inviability coincides with the time of mitosis. Third, fluorescence microscopy reveals that the normal progression of mitosis is disturbed in mutant cells at the restrictive temperature. Finally, inviability at the restrictive temperature is prevented by nocodazole, an inhibitor of tubulin polymerization that prevents formation of the mitotic spindle. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the essential function of topoisomerase II is to allow the separation of intertwined chromosomal DNA molecules during mitosis."

https://openalex.org/W2008493977,"The envelope (env) and structural (gag) gene products of human T-cell leukemia (lymphotropic) virus type III were identified by immunoaffinity chromatography, immunoprecipitation, and two-dimensional oligopeptide mapping methods. The env gene specifies a glycosylated polypeptide with a molecular weight of 160,000 (gp160) that is processed to gp120 and smaller gene products. The gag gene specifies two polypeptides of 70,000 and 55,000 molecular weight (p70 and p55), both of which contain p24, the major structural protein of the mature virion. The techniques in this study can be used to define the extent of variability of the env gene product among different virus isolates and may identify the nature and patterns of the humoral immune response that lead to an immunologically protected state."

On alfalfa, the mutants do not curl root hairs, but penetrate the epidermis directly, forming nodules that contain no visible infection threads or “bacteroids” have a few bacteria in superficial intercellular spaces only and not within the nodule cells, and fail to fix nitrogen (Fix−). Evidently, infection threads are not essential for cell proliferation and nodule formation, which are here induced by a bacterial signal at a distance and uncoupled from the bacterial differentiation that normally goes on as well."
https://openalex.org/W1965753868,"In the recent literature on nucleoside phosphorothioate anions the structural formulas show a double bond between phosphorus and sulfur and a single bond between phosphorus and oxygen with a negative charge localized on oxygen. However, a review of physical data on these compounds shows the reverse to be the case; that is, in phosphorothioate anions the P-S bond is a single bond with a negative charge localized on sulfur, while the P-O bond order for exocyclic and nonbridging oxygens is greater than 1, approaching 2 in O-alkyl phosphorothioate monoanions and O,O-dialkyl phosphorothioates. The P-O bond orders in phosphorothioate dianions and trianions approach 1 1/2 and 1 1/3, respectively, owing to delocalization of negative charge among two or three oxygens. These conclusions are based on bond lengths obtained from x-ray crystallographic data and electron diffraction, the magnitudes of the effects of 18O on the 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shifts of phosphorus in nucleoside [18O]phosphorothioates, the pH-dependence of 17O-NMR chemical shifts in [17O]phosphate and [17O]thiophosphate, the vibrational spectra of thiophosphate di- and trianions, and the pKa (dissociation constant) values for phosphoric and thiophosphoric acids."
https://openalex.org/W2056382700,"Topoisomerase I is associated with DNAase I hypersensitive sites in the nontranscribed spacers flanking the rRNA genes in Tetrahymena thermophila. The endogenous topoisomerase I introduces site and strand specific single-strand cleavages in the rDNA spacers in situ. The cleavages occur base specifically within a hexadecameric sequence element present in two or three direct repeats at the hypersensitive sites. The sequence specificity and polarity of the cleavage reaction are identical when the enzyme is reacted with naked rDNA, indicating that the repetitive element functions as a high-affinity topoisomerase I attraction site in the r-chromatin. The biological mechanism associated with this phenomenon appears to be widespread among eukaryotes, since the topoisomerase I recognition sequence is conserved in the rDNA spacers of phylogenetically remote organisms, such as fungi, slime molds, ciliates, and insects."

https://openalex.org/W2013271253,"We have cloned the human alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT) gene and identified the promoter and the transcription initiation point. The cloned gene, following transfection, is expressed in a cell-specific manner, being transcribed in a human hepatoma cell line (Hep3B) but not in HeLa cells. We show that the 5' flanking region of the alpha 1-AT gene contains DNA sequences sufficient for efficient transcription in Hep3B but not in HeLa cells. This DNA sequence also activates, in a cell-specific manner, heterologous promoters such as that of SV40; however, the effect is only obtained in one orientation, suggesting that this cis-acting cell-specific element does not share all the features generally associated with enhancers. By cotransfection-competition experiments we also show the existence of a limiting trans-acting factor, essential for the expression of the alpha 1-AT gene in Hep3B cells."
https://openalex.org/W1523079115,"Although the lambdoid bacteriophage phi 80 and P22 possess site-specific recombination systems analogous to bacteriophage lambda, they have different attachment (att) site specificities. We have identified and determined the nucleotide sequences of the att sites of phi 80 and P22 and have examined the interaction of these sites with purified Escherichia coli integration host factor (IHF). The sizes of the homologous core regions of the att sites vary greatly: P22 has a 46-base pair core, while phi 80 and lambda have 17- and 15-base pair cores, respectively. The core sequences of the three phage show no significant homology, although dispersed regions of homology in arm sequences indicate that the three phage att sites are related. All three att sites have a high A + T composition, and restriction fragments carrying these sites migrate anomalously upon polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. IHF binds to a site to the left of the common core in the phi 80 and P22 phage att sites (attP) and to a site to the right of the core in P22 attP and attB (the bacterial att site). In the lambda system, IHF interacts with three regions on attP (designated H1, H2, and H') and none on attB (Craig N., and Nash, H.A. (1984) Cell 39, 707-716). Alignment of the IHF sites of all three phage results in a consensus sequence for IHF binding, Pyr-AANNNNTTGATAT. Among the three phage, the number of IHF sites differs; however, the location and orientation of the binding sites in relation to the respective core regions are well conserved. An IHF site analogous to lambda H2 is present in both phi 80 and P22 attP, while a site analogous to lambda H' is present in P22 attP. This conservation suggests that IHF plays a very similar role in the site-specific recombination pathways of all three phage, and that the flanking arm sequences are necessary for phi 80 and P22 attP function, as is the case for lambda attP function. These structural similarities presumably reflect a conservation of the mechanism of site-specific recombination for the three phage."

https://openalex.org/W1535473141,"Medium conditioned by BRL-3A cells, a known source of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), induced phenotypic transformation (anchorage-independent proliferation) of mouse BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts but not rat NRK-49F fibroblasts, in the presence of 10% calf serum. A specific radioreceptor assay and a bioassay indicated that BRL-3A conditioned medium contained 0.5-1 ng/ml of type beta transforming growth factor (beta TGF). Purified IGF-II and beta TGF acting together reconstituted the transforming activity of BRL-3A conditioned medium on BALB/c 3T3 cells. Insulin was 5-10% as potent as IGF-II in supporting the transforming action of beta TGF on BALB/c 3T3 cells. NRK-49F cells were phenotypically transformed by beta TGF in the presence of EGF and 10% calf serum as the sole source of IGFs. However, transformation of NRK-49F cells under these conditions was inhibited by addition of purified IGF-binding protein. Addition of an excess of IGF-II prevented the inhibitory action of IGF-binding protein. The different sensitivity of the two cell lines to IGFs was correlated with lower levels of type I IGF receptor and higher levels of type II IGF receptor in NRK-49F cells as compared with BALB/c 3T3 cells. The results suggest that cellular stimulation by IGFs is a prerequisite for transformation of rodent fibroblasts by beta TGF. We propose that transformation of fibroblasts by beta TGF requires concomitant stimulation by the set of growth factors that support normal cell proliferation."

Both oncogene proteins were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using monoclonal antibodies against p19 and immunoglobulins specific for myb, which was expressed in bacteria for antibody production. The purified proteins bind to DNA in vitro. In contrast, purified p135gag-myb-ets proteins from several mutants of E26 virus, temperature-sensitive for myeloblast transformation, either lost their abilities to bind to DNA or exhibited highly thermolabile DNA-protein interactions in vitro. DNA binding of AMV and E26 oncogene proteins is inhibited by myb-specific immunoglobulins. Our results suggest that lesions in the myb oncogene affect transformation as well as DNA binding of myb proteins in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1973451373,"We have isolated DNA sequences defining the forked locus of Drosophila. All the alleles belonging to the right pseudoallelic series of M. M. Green map within a 5.4 kb DNA fragment that encodes four transcripts. These RNAs are only expressed in 2-4 day old pupae and their accumulation is affected by mutations at the forked locus. Also, homozygous mutations at the unlinked suppressor loci su(Hw) and su(f) cause the accumulation of these RNAs to return to the normal wild-type levels. The gypsy transposable element, which causes the mutant phenotype in the suppressible forked alleles, encodes a transcript that is maximally expressed in 2-3 day old pupae, the same time in development as transcription of the forked RNAs. We propose a model to explain the mutagenic effect of gypsy based on the influence of promoter elements in the long terminal repeats of the transposon on the transcription from other promoters located nearby."
https://openalex.org/W2005669461,"Phorbol esters specifically reduce the binding of epidermal growth factor to surface receptors in intact cells, but not when added directly to isolated membranes. We show that after treatment of intact cells with phorbol myristate acetate, 125I-EGF binding is reduced in membranes prepared subsequently. High-affinity binding of 125I-EGF is modulated by an intracellular calcium-dependent regulatory process. Preventing calcium entry with EGTA or enhancing intracellular calcium with A23187 in intact cells modulates EGF receptor affinity in membranes isolated subsequently. Also, EGTA attenuates the usual inhibition of EGF binding caused by phorbol esters. Membrane preparations do not respond to phorbol ester treatment because the calcium- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C is removed or inactivated during membrane isolation. Reconstitution of unresponsive membranes with purified C kinase alters phosphorylation of the EGF receptor and restores the inhibitory effect of phorbol esters on 125I-EGF binding previously observed only in intact cells. Thus, activation of the Ca++-dependent enzyme, C kinase, modulates EGF receptor affinity, possibly via altered receptor phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W1519058182,"Omeprazole (5-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5- dimethylpyridinyl)methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole) appeared to inhibit gastric (H+-K+)-ATPase by oxidizing its essential sulfhydryl groups, since the gastric ATPase inactivated by the drug in vivo or in vitro recovered its K+-dependent ATP hydrolyzing activity upon incubation with mercaptoethanol. Biological reducing agents like cysteine or glutathione, however, were unable to reverse the inhibitory effect of omeprazole. Moreover, acidic environments enhanced the potency of omeprazole. For example, in vivo pretreatment of rats with carbachol, a secretagogue, enhanced the activity of omeprazole to inhibit gastric (H+-K+)-ATPase, while pretreatment with cimetidine, an antisecretory agent, reduced its potency. In vitro, lowering pH of incubation media from 7.4 to 5.0 improved the ability of omeprazole to inhibit hog gastric (H+-K+)-ATPase almost 60-fold. The inhibitory effect of the drug was accompanied by a dose-dependently decreased amount of free sulfhydryl groups in the isolated hog gastric membranes. The chemical reactivity of omeprazole with mercaptans is also consistent with the biological action of omeprazole. The drug, only under acidic conditions, reacted with a stoichiometric amount of ethyl mercaptan (or beta-mercaptoethanol) to produce regio-isomers of N-sulfenylated omeprazole sulfide (5-methoxy-2[[(4-methoxy-3,5- dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)methyl]thio]-1- or 3-(ethylthio)benzimidazole). The N-sulfenylated compound reacted at neutral pH with another stoichiometric amount of ethyl mercaptan to produce omeprazole sulfide quantitatively. The gastric polypeptides of 100 kilodaltons representing (H+-K+)-ATPase in the rat gastric mucosa or isolated hog gastric membranes were covalently labeled with [14C]omeprazole. The radioactive label bound to the ATPase, however, could not be displaced by mercaptoethanol under the identical conditions where the ATPase activity was fully restored. These observations suggest that the essential sulfhydryl groups which reacted with omeprazole did not form a stable covalent bond with the drug, but rather that they further reacted with adjacent sulfhydryl groups to form disulfides which could be reduced by mercaptoethanol."
https://openalex.org/W2009015251,"Three gene-sized molecules cloned intact from macronuclear DNA served as hybridization probes to study excision of these molecules from chromosomes and their processing during macronuclear development in the hypotrich Euplotes crassus. These olecules occur in integrated forms within polytene chromosomal DNA during macronuclear development. After transection of the polytene chromosomes, the three molecules occur in intermediate forms. One of the three molecules first appeared in a large intermediate that was subsequently replaced by a second intermediate, ∼140 by larger than the final molecule. The other two macronuclear molecules were detected only in intermediates ∼140 by larger than the mature form. These penultimate intermediates are larger by virtue of oversized telomeres, which are pared to yield the mature gene-sized molecules."

However, in hypertonic medium both RI★ and catenated dimers accumulated, and Form II★ was not observed. Hypertonic medium appeared to inhibit both DNA unwinding in the termination region and separation of catenated dimers.

https://openalex.org/W2088741833,"We identified an Escherichia coli gene, designated P14, that is adjacent to and in the opposite orientation to the tonB gene. The 36 base pair intercistronic region between tonB and P14 contains a novel rho-independent transcription terminator that functions bidirectionally, both in vivo and in vitro, to terminate tonB and P14 transcription. Transcription of tonB and P14 terminates at symmetrically equivalent nucleotides, such that the 3' ends of tonB and P14 transcripts are complementary. The terminator is 70% efficient in both directions in vitro. Interestingly, relative rates of in vivo RNA synthesis, immediately prior to and following the terminator, appear to indicate that it is more efficient in the tonB direction (95%) than in the P14 direction (70%). We discuss the possibility that this gene arrangement has regulatory consequences for the expression of tonB."
https://openalex.org/W1977479548,"We have analyzed the transforming potential of two fos oncogene products in nonestablished cultures of mouse connective tissue cells: p55fos of FBJ-MuSV and p75gag-fos of FBR-MuSV. Although both proteins induced morphological transformation and colony formation at low cell density in a G418 resistance selection assay, p75gag-fos exhibited more pronounced transforming potential than p55fos. In addition, p75gag-fos-transformed cells overcame crisis with a high probability and were tumorigenic in syngenic mice. These properties of the FBR-MuSV appear to be linked to structural alterations in the p75gag-fos oncogene product. Polyoma virus large T protein complemented the transforming potential of fos, in that it not only increased the probability of establishment of fos-transformed cells but also enhanced fos-induced morphological transformation. Our results suggest that different oncogenes affect morphological transformation, low cell density growth, establishment, and tumorigenicity to various degrees."
https://openalex.org/W2125241206,"Proteins dissociated from SV40 minichromosomes by increasing NaCl concentration were tested for their binding to Z-DNA [Br-poly(dG-dC)] and B-DNA [poly (dG-dC)]. Z-DNA binding proteins are largely released in 0.2 M NaCl whereas most B-DNA binding proteins are not released until 0.6 M NaCI. Incubation of SV40 minichromosomes with Z-DNA-Sephadex in low salt solution results in proteins with Z-DNA binding activity (PZ proteins). These proteins bind to negatively supercoiled DNAs containing left-handed Z-DNA but not to relaxed DNAs. They compete with anti-Z-DNA antibodies in binding to negatively supercoiled DNAs. The binding is tighter to negatively supercoiled SV40 DNA than to other plasmids, suggesting sequence-specific Z-DNA binding. PZ proteins binding to negatively supercoiled SV40 DNA interfere with cleavage at the Sph I sites, within the 72 by repeat sequences of the viral control region, but not with cleavage at the Bgl I site, at the origin of replication. Removal of PZ proteins also exposes the Sph I sites in the SV40 minichromosomes while addition of PZ proteins makes the sites inaccessible."
https://openalex.org/W1655258255,"Abstract We have isolated several overlapping genomic clones which contain the 5' terminal portion of the rat pro-alpha 1 (II) chain gene. These clones span about 20 kilobases (kb) of contiguous DNA containing 15 kb of the gene and 5 kb of the 5' flanking sequence. Electron microscopic analysis of mRNA-DNA hybrids by R-looping shows that collectively these clones contain 16 exons which code for approximately one-third of the pro-alpha 1 (II) chain. The sizes of the exons are small, except for the first exon which is relatively large. The nucleotide sequence of the first exon and the 1000 base pairs (bp) preceding it was determined. The first exon contains a 150-bp untranslated segment and an 85-bp sequence coding for the signal peptide and a part of the NH2-terminal propeptide of type II collagen. The segment preceding the transcription initiation site contains the box and several G + C-rich stretches, whereas the CAT box is not evident between -70 and -120. The hexanucleotide sequence 5'-GGGCGG-3' is found in three different places between -200 and the TATA box. The inverted complement sequence of this hexanucleotide, 5'-CCGCCC-3', is located around both -220 and -450. The hexanucleotide and its inverted sequence have been found previously in the promoter region of the tk gene of herpes virus. These sequences are known to function in a mutually dependent manner as transcription signals for the tk gene; thus, they may play a role in determining the level of transcription of this cartilage gene. The hexanucleotide, 5'-CCGCCC-3', is also found in the 21-base pair repeats of the SV40 promoter and the promoter region of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase gene. The sequence 5'-GTGGTTAGA-3' located around -280 is identical to the core sequence that has been reported as enhancer element in both viral and cellular genes. These unusual structures may be related to the tissue-specific expression of this gene."
https://openalex.org/W2052785720,"Analysis of the turnover of unassembled proteins during the assembly of the erythroid membrane skeleton has revealed that α- and β-spectrin, two structurally related, high molecular weight proteins, are degraded in a selective manner by two distinct intracellular pathways. Unassembled α-spectrin () is degraded by a system with all the pharmacological characteristics of a membrane-bound, lysosomal-type pathway. This result illustrates for the first time the selective degradation of an intracellular short-lived, unassembled protein by a lysosomal pathway. In contrast, unassembled β-spectrin is degraded extremely rapidly ( at 38°C) by a soluble cytoplasmic system in an apparently ATP-independent manner. These observations suggest that the selective and rapid degradation of β-spectrin serves an important regulatory role in the topogenesis of the spectrinbased membrane skeleton in the chicken erythrocyte."

https://openalex.org/W1479957720,"Abstract An active form of phosphorylase phosphatase of Mr = 33,000, referred to as the for over a decade, was purified to near-homogeneity from rabbit skeletal muscle. Repeated immunization of a sheep produced immunoglobulins that blocked the activity of the phosphatase. These immunoglobulins were affinity-purified on columns of immobilized phosphorylase phosphatase and used as macromolecular probes in a Western immunoblotting procedure with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep immunoglobulins. Only one protein, of Mr = 33,000, was stained in samples of the immunogen, attesting to the specificity of the probes. However, the Mr = 33,000 phosphatase protein was not detected in muscle extracts or in partially purified preparations. Instead, a single protein of Mr = 70,000 was detected. Limited proteolysis, in particular by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and thermolysin, converted the immunoreactive protein from Mr = 70,000 to Mr = 33,000. Coagulation of the phosphatase preparation with 80% ethanol at room temperature rendered the Mr = 70,000 protein insoluble, but allowed extraction of the Mr = 33,000 protein from the precipitate. Thus, we conclude that the immunoreactive protein of Mr = 70,000 is the catalytic subunit of phosphorylase phosphatase with a domain of Mr = 33,000. Previous purification schemes have yielded only the fragment of Mr = 33,000 due to its relative resistance to proteolysis and coagulation. Gel filtration chromatography of the form of phosphorylase phosphatase showed Mr approximately 230,000. Both the Mr = 70,000 and a Mr = 60,000 protein related to inhibitor-2 were detected by immunoblotting in the same fractions that exhibited activity after treatment with Co2+ and trypsin. Only the Mr = 60,000 protein was degraded during this activation process. We propose that the native phosphorylase phosphatase is an elongated structure with two-fold symmetry, containing one of Mr = 70,000 and one regulatory of Mr = 60,000."

The purified protein displays three activities in vitro: stimulation of poliovirus RNA synthesis in the presence of poliovirus replicase, apparent self-phosphorylation, and phosphorylation of the alpha-subunit of eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2 (eIF-2). All three activities can be removed or inhibited by an antibody to host factor. Partially purified preparations of reticulocyte eIF-2 contain a similar phosphoprotein and display host factor activity in the viral RNA synthesis assay in vitro. In vitro phosphorylation of the 67 kd protein can be stimulated by low concentrations of double-stranded RNA. Addition of phosphorylated host factor in an in vitro RNA synthesis assay significantly changes the kinetics of viral RNA synthesis, indicating that protein phosphorylation may play an important role in viral RNA replication."

To identify the K10 gene we used P-mediated transformation with cosmid clones constructed in cos-P, a cosmid vector incorporating the terminal repeats of the P element. Clone cos9, containing a 43 kb insert, transformed the germ line of homozygous K10 females and allowed production of normal progeny. It also rescued three genes, crooked neck, pecanex, and kurz, which map genetically near K10. Transformation experiments using smaller fragments of cos9 localize the K10+ function within 11 kb. Northern blots hybridized with probes from this region indicate the presence of several mRNA species. Each transcript has been assigned to a complementation group."

Two patterns of greying were observed, diffuse greying beginning at 4 to 6 months of age and patterned greying beginning at 4 to 6 weeks. Strains exhibiting either greying pattern expressed high levels of infectious ecotropic and mink cell focus-inducing murine leukemia viruses (MuLV) in tests of thymus and spleen and in cultures from skin or tail biopsies, whereas nongreying strains expressed little virus until late in life. Electron microscopy demonstrated large accumulations of MuLV in grey, but not in black areas, of skin from a mouse with patterned greying. Infectious MuLV was produced spontaneously by embryos of greying, but not of nongreying, mice and pups of nongreying strains fostered on greying mothers turned grey after 3 months. These results suggest that greying with age results from melanocyte dysfunction that occurs subsequent to pre- or early postnatal infection with MuLV."

Antiserum raised in sheep against I2 by repeated immunization potently blocked inhibitory activity, whereas preimmune serum did not. Immunoglobulins which blocked inhibitory activity were purified by affinity chromatography with I2 as the immobilized ligand. Using a Western immunoblotting procedure, as little as 1-5 ng of pure I2, obtained by electroelution of the Mr = 31,000 band of I2 from a polyacrylamide gel segment, were detected. Immunoblotting of the immunogen revealed only a band at Mr = 31,000, indicating the absence of contaminating antigenic proteins. When extracts of skeletal muscle and other rabbit tissues were denatured directly in dodecyl sulfate for immunoblotting the most intensely stained band was present at Mr = 60,000, rather than at Mr = 31,000 as expected. A small amount of I2 and other bands were detected, in particular at Mr = 36,000 and 25,000. Subsequent to heat treatment of the tissue extracts, there was an enrichment of I2 content relative to the Mr = 60,000 band. The results indicate the existence of a Mr = 60,000 protein related to I2. Activation of phosphorylase phosphatase in a muscle extract by treatment with Co2+ plus trypsin exactly coincided with digestion of the Mr = 60,000 immunoreactive protein. Available data indicate that this protein may function as a regulatory subunit of phosphorylase phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1640556448,"The biosynthetic conversions of arachidonic acid to hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HPETEs) and the further conversion of leukotriene epoxides are accompanied by stereoselective hydrogen abstraction from the reaction substrate. Furthermore, this hydrogen removal has always been found to occur in fixed stereochemical relationship to carbon-oxygen chiral center(s) in the substrate or product. We have used stereospecifically labeled 10-3H-substrates with 14C internal standard to investigate whether the same relationships bear in HPETE and leukotriene formation during autoxidation. After autoxidation of labeled arachidonate, both the 8(R)- and 8(S)-HPETE enantiomers (resolved as diastereomer derivatives) and the 12(RS)-HPETE were observed to retain 41-47% 3H relative to the starting material. In autoxidative formation of leukotrienes from labeled 15(S)-HPETE the four main leukotrienes, including two derived from 14,15-leukotriene A4 hydrolysis, were observed to have retained an average of 45% 3H. Primary and secondary isotope effects were found to accompany these reactions. The results prove that stereorandom hydrogen abstraction occurs in autoxidation and that the hydrogen loss bears no stereochemical relationship to chiral oxygen center(s) in the HPETE product, (8(R) or 8(S], or the 15(S)-hydroperoxy substrate. We conclude that the chiral features of the biosynthetic reactions are a reflection of enzymatic control of stereochemistry. Nonetheless, the findings of primary and secondary isotope effects in autoxidation which are similar to those observed in the analogous biosynthetic reactions suggests that, except for stereochemical control, the autoxidative and enzymatic reactions may be mechanistically similar."
https://openalex.org/W1585229817,"Brief (approximately 20-min) exposure of S49 lymphoma cells to beta-agonists such as isoproterenol leads to a homologous form of desensitization in which beta-agonist but not prostaglandin E1-sensitive or NaF-sensitive adenylate cyclase is reduced. The desensitized receptors (R) appear to be sequestered away from the effector system (guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Ns) and adenylate cyclase (C)). Membrane perturbants such as polyethylene glycol are known to reorient membrane proteins and lipids. Thus, we fused agonist-desensitized S49 lymphoma cells to each other, using polyethylene glycol as fusogen, in an attempt to functionally reunite the R, N, and C components which might have become sequestered in microdomains of the plasma membrane during desensitization. Such treatment completely restored isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase to normal and re-established the ability of R and N to functionally couple as assessed by the ability to form a high affinity, guanine nucleotide-sensitive state of the receptor. These results support the concept that agonist-promoted sequestration plays a functionally significant role in the homologous desensitization of the beta-adrenergic receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1531294584,"Abstract Uteroferrin and semimethemerythrin, proteins possessing spin-coupled binuclear iron centers, exhibit large linear electric field effects in their mixed-valence, EPR-active states. This indicates that the paramagnetic center of each protein is noncentrosymmetric and suggests that charge may be localized on one of the iron atoms. The magnetic field dependence of the linear electric field effects for both proteins demonstrates that the direction of most facile polarization of the binuclear iron centers is near the orientation giving rise to gmin. Electron spin-echo studies of uteroferrin reveal that its magnetic electron interacts with at least one and possibly two classes of nitrogen nuclei. Furthermore, comparison of echo envelope spectra for uteroferrin with that of ferric bleomycin suggests that one of these nuclei is from a histidine ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1537481495,"The contractile proteins of striated muscle are encoded by multigene families and constitute an excellent system to investigate differentiation and developmental control of gene expression. Different forms of myosin light chains are expressed in skeletal muscle as well as in the myocard. To study the gene structure and molecular mechanisms underlying differential gene expression, the structural cardiac myosin light chain 2 (MLC-2A) gene was isolated from a chicken genomic DNA library. Restriction enzyme mapping, electron microscopic analysis, and partial sequencing revealed that the gene coding for the MLC mRNA of 700 nucleotides in length extends over 4.2 kilobases of DNA and is interrupted by 5 introns. Sequence analysis led to the detection of two codons for additional amino acids at the N terminus which were not reported to be present in the mature protein and are presumably removed post-translationally. These two amino acids, methionine and alanine, are coded on two separate exons split by the largest intron of the entire gene. Southern blot analysis of genomic chicken DNA indicates the presence of one MLC-2A gene per haploid chicken genome."
https://openalex.org/W1593876912,"The enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from Drosophila melanogaster has been purified, and these preparations contain two subunits forms which have molecular weights of 37,000 and 35,500, respectively. Each subunit is found in crude extracts, and two activity bands are seen in nondenaturing acrylamide gels. Translation of Drosophila poly(A)-containing RNA results in two products which are precipitable with anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase serum. Two recombinant DNA clones have been isolated from a genomic library of Drosophila DNA. Each of these clones has the ability to hybrid select mRNAs which translate into both subunit forms. These clones have been genetically characterized by in situ hybridization and restriction mapping. One clone hybridizes to region 13F and the other to region 43E of the Drosophila cytogenetic map. Therefore, it appears that the Drosophila melanogaster genome contains two unlinked genes for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; one of them encodes a protein of 37,000 daltons, the other a protein of 35,500 daltons."
https://openalex.org/W1557643082,"In this study, we found that Hg2+ and Cd2+ enhanced the phosphorylation of human erythrocyte membranous proteins, especially band 4.2 protein, which was hardly phosphorylated in the absence of the metal ions. p-Chloromercuribenzenesulfonate and p-chloromercuribenzoate had effects similar to those of Hg2+ and Cd2+ on band 4.2 protein phosphorylation, while other metal ions and sulfhydryl agents, such as N-ethylmaleimide, 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), or iodoacetate, did not. The Hg2+-stimulated phosphorylation of band 4.2 protein required a millimolar concentration of Mg2+, and it was inhibited by Ca2+ dose-dependently. Phosphoserine was identified from a hydrolysate of the phosphorylated band 4.2 protein by high-voltage electrophoresis. A specific protein inhibitor against cAMP-dependent protein kinase decreased the Hg2+-stimulated phosphorylation of band 4.2 protein. This protein had more binding sites for 203Hg2+ than any other membrane proteins. A spectrin complex from the Hg2+-treated membranes contained the band 4.2 protein, which was not detected in the complex from untreated membranes. Furthermore, protein kinase, which could phosphorylate the band 4.2 protein, was also contained in the cytoskeletal fraction from the Hg2+-treated membranes. These results suggest that Hg2+ may bind certain sulfhydryl groups of band 4.2 and other proteins to make band 4.2 protein susceptible to the endogenous cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1519187595,"The nucleotide preferences of calf thymus topoisomerases I and II for recognition of supercoiled DNA have been assessed by the relaxation and cleavage of DNA containing base-specific phosphorothioate substitutions in one strand. The type I enzyme is inhibited to varying degrees by all modified DNAs, but most effectively (by approximately 60%) if deoxyguanosine 5'-O-(1-thiomonophosphate) (dGMP alpha S) is incorporated into negatively supercoiled DNA. A DNA in which all internucleotide linkages of one strand are phosphorothionate is relaxed, most probably via the unsubstituted strand. The type II enzyme is inhibited when deoxyadenosine 5'-O-(1-thiomonophosphate) (dAMP alpha S) or deoxyribosylthymine 5'-O-(1-thiomonophosphate) is incorporated into the DNA substrate, and the course of the relaxation reaction changes from a distributive mode to a predominantly processive mode. A fully substituted DNA is very poorly relaxed by the type II enzyme, illustrating the strict commitment of the enzyme to relaxation via double-strand cleavage. The sense of supercoiling does not affect the inhibition profile of either enzyme. DNA strand breaks introduced by type II topoisomerase in a normal control DNA or deoxycytidine 5'-O-(1-thiomonophosphate)-substituted DNA on treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate at low ionic strength are prevented by pretreatment with 0.2 M NaCl. In contrast, breaks in DNA having either dAMP alpha S or all four phosphorothioate nucleotides incorporated in one strand are prevented only with higher NaCl concentrations. Thus indicating activity at the phosphorothioate linkage 5' to dA but not 5' to dC. We conclude that topoisomerase II activity occurs preferentially at sites possessing dAMP or dTMP, and that dGMP is involved in DNA recognition by topoisomerase I."
https://openalex.org/W1587400850,"We have previously shown that, by culturing cells in hypertonic media, histone 2A becomes hyperphosphorylated (Pantazis, P., West, M. H. P., and Bonner, W. M. (1984) Mol. Cell. Biol. 4, 1186-1188). In the present study we have probed the effect of this histone modification on the overall chromatin structure by micrococcal nuclease and DNase I digestion. Although no significant quantitative differences in the extent of hydrolysis were observed between control and hyperphosphorylated chromatin by micrococcal nuclease, DNase I digested hyperphosphorylated chromatin at a 3- to 4-fold higher rate than unmodified chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1505480675,"The catabolism of deoxy-GTP and GTP was compared in purine-nucleoside phosphorylase-deficient mouse T lymphoblasts. It was found that guanine ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides are degraded by distinct pathways in cells cultured under both physiological and induced catabolic conditions. In T lymphoblasts, cultured under physiological conditions, 50% of the GMP formed during GTP catabolism was dephosphorylated and 50% was deaminated, whereas in the presence of the catabolic inducer deoxyglucose 90% of the GMP formed was dephosphorylated and only 10% was deaminated. These results indicate that GTP catabolism in lymphoblasts proceeds by alternative pathways, either via GMP dephosphorylation or via GMP reductive deamination, and physiological conditions determine with pathway will be used. In contrast, deoxy-GTP catabolism proceeds exclusively via deoxy-GMP dephosphorylation under both physiological and induced catabolic conditions. The lack of deoxy-GMP deamination may contribute to the accumulation of cytotoxic levels of deoxyguanosine found in purine-nucleoside phosphorylase-deficient patients."
