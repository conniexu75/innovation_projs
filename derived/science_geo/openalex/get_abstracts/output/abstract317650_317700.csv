https://openalex.org/W2117087393,"Antibiotic mode-of-action classification is based upon drug-target interaction and whether the resultant inhibition of cellular function is lethal to bacteria. Here we show that the three major classes of bactericidal antibiotics, regardless of drug-target interaction, stimulate the production of highly deleterious hydroxyl radicals in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, which ultimately contribute to cell death. We also show, in contrast, that bacteriostatic drugs do not produce hydroxyl radicals. We demonstrate that the mechanism of hydroxyl radical formation induced by bactericidal antibiotics is the end product of an oxidative damage cellular death pathway involving the tricarboxylic acid cycle, a transient depletion of NADH, destabilization of iron-sulfur clusters, and stimulation of the Fenton reaction. Our results suggest that all three major classes of bactericidal drugs can be potentiated by targeting bacterial systems that remediate hydroxyl radical damage, including proteins involved in triggering the DNA damage response, e.g., RecA."

Eritoran is an analog of LPS that antagonizes its activity by binding to the TLR4-MD-2 complex. We determined the structure of the full-length ectodomain of the mouse TLR4 and MD-2 complex. We also produced a series of hybrids of human TLR4 and hagfish VLR and determined their structures with and without bound MD-2 and Eritoran. TLR4 is an atypical member of the LRR family and is composed of N-terminal, central, and C-terminal domains. The β sheet of the central domain shows unusually small radii and large twist angles. MD-2 binds to the concave surface of the N-terminal and central domains. The interaction with Eritoran is mediated by a hydrophobic internal pocket in MD-2. Based on structural analysis and mutagenesis experiments on MD-2 and TLR4, we propose a model of TLR4-MD-2 dimerization induced by LPS.

Innate immunity provides immediate and efficient defense against microbial infection. It promotes inflammatory responses and also plays a role in the induction of the adaptive immune system that recognizes specific antigens. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a family of type I transmembrane glycoproteins, are central to vertebrate innate immune responses (Gay and Gangloff, 2007Gay N.J. Gangloff M. Structure and function of toll receptors and their ligands.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 141-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, Medzhitov et al., 1997Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. A human homologue of the Drosophila Toll protein signals activation of adaptive immunity.Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4208) Google Scholar). They recognize broad but highly conserved structural patterns on bacteria, fungi, and viruses, which are generally absent from host molecules and are called pattern recognition receptors. To date, 13 mammalian members of the TLR family have been identified, and six subfamilies have been defined based on function and sequence characteristics (Matsushima et al., 2007Matsushima N. Tanaka T. Enkhbaya P. Mikami T. Taga M. Ymada K. Kuroki Y.

USA. 2005; 102: 9577-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). The extracellular segments of TLRs consist of leucine-rich repeats (LRR) with horseshoe-like shapes (Gay and Gangloff, 2007Gay N.J. Gangloff M. Structure and function of toll receptors and their ligands.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 141-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Binding of ligands to the extracellular domains of TLRs causes a rearrangement of the receptor complex and triggers the recruitment of specific adaptor proteins to the intracellular domain, thus initiating a signaling cascade. TLR4 is composed of a 608 residue extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a 187 residue intracellular domain (Medzhitov et al., 1997Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. A human homologue of the Drosophila Toll protein signals activation of adaptive immunity.Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4208) Google Scholar). MD-2, which lacks transmembrane and intracellular regions, associates with the extracellular domain of TLR4 and is believed to be the component of the TLR4-MD-2 complex that interacts with LPS (lipopolysaccharide) (Shimazu et al., 1999Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. MD-2, a molecule that confers lipopolysaccharide responsiveness on Toll-like receptor 4.J. Exp.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38044-38051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LPS is an outer membrane glycolipid of Gram-negative bacteria and a well-known inducer of the innate immune response (Raetz and Whitfield, 2002Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Lipopolysaccharide endotoxins.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3019) Google Scholar). It is composed of a hydrophobic lipid A component and the hydrophilic polysaccharides of the core and O-antigen. The lipid A portion, which is composed of phosphorylated di-glucosamine and multiple acyl chains, corresponds to the conserved molecular pattern of LPS and is the main inducer of biological responses to LPS. LPS is extracted from the bacterial membrane and transferred to TLR4 by two accessory proteins, LPS-binding protein (LBP) and CD14 (Miyake, 2006Miyake K. Roles for accessory molecules in microbial recognition by Toll-like receptors.J. Endotoxin Res. 2006; 12: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). TLR4 and MD-2 are essential for LPS recognition. The C3H/HeJ strain of mice, which tolerates lethal doses of LPS and has altered inflammatory responses, was found to have a missense mutation in the conserved region of the TLR4 intracellular domain (Poltorak et al., 1998Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. et al.Defective LPS signaling in C3H/HeJ and C57BL/10ScCr mice: mutations in Tlr4 gene.Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6166) Google Scholar, Qureshi et al., 1999Qureshi S.T.

Med. 1999; 189: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). Similar tolerance was observed in the C57BL/10ScCr mutant, which has a deletion of the entire tlr4 locus, and in TLR4-deficient mice (Hoshino et al., 1999Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H.

Med. 1999; 189: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). However, transfection of TLR4 alone is not enough for LPS recognition, and physical association of TLR4 with MD-2 on the cell surface is a prerequisite for ligand-induced activation (Nagai et al., 2002Nagai Y. Akashi S. Nagafuku M. Ogata M. Iwakura Y. Akira S. Kitamura T. Kosugi A. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Essential role of MD-2 in LPS responsiveness and TLR4 distribution.Nat.

MD-2, a molecule that confers lipopolysaccharide responsiveness on Toll-like receptor 4.J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). LPS has similar affinity for MD-2 as for the TLR4-MD-2 complex, demonstrating that MD-2 is the LPS-binding component (Viriyakosol et al., 2001Viriyakosol S. Tobias P.S. Kitchens R.L. Kirkland T.N. MD-2 binds to bacterial lipopolysaccharide.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38044-38051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only the monomeric form of soluble recombinant MD-2 was found to bind LPS, producing a stable MD-2-LPS complex, and this complex was sufficient for inducing TLR4-dependent activation (Gioannini et al., 2004Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Coussens N.P. Dockstader W. Ramaswamy S. Weiss J.P. Isolation of an endotoxin-MD-2 complex that produces Toll-like receptor 4-dependent cell activation at picomolar concentrations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Monomeric recombinant MD-2 binds toll-like receptor 4 tightly and confers lipopolysaccharide responsiveness.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23427-23432Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Engagement of LPS on the host cell activates a strong immune response that protects the human body against further infection. However, it can also lead to a fatal septic syndrome if the inflammatory response is amplified and uncontrolled. Eritoran (or E5564) is a synthetic molecule derived from the lipid A structure of the nonpathogenic LPS of Rhodobacter sphaeroides (Mullarkey et al., 2003Mullarkey M. Rose J.R. Bristol J. Kawata T. Kimura A. Kobayashi S. Przetak M. Chow J. Gusovsky F. Christ W.J. Rossignol D.P. Inhibition of endotoxin response by e5564, a novel Toll-like receptor 4-directed endotoxin antagonist.J. Pharmacol.

Drugs. 2005; 6: 496-502PubMed Google Scholar). It is a strong antagonist of TLR4-MD-2 and is currently in a phase III clinical trial for severe sepsis. Although the first crystal structures of TLR3 was recently reported (Bell et al., 2005Bell J.K. Botos I. Hall P.R. Askins J. Shiloach J. Segal D.M. Davies D.R.

Kelker M.S. Wilson I.A. Crystal structure of human toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) ectodomain.Science. 2005; 309: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), the structural basis of ligand binding and activation of TLR family proteins still remain to be clarified. To address these questions, we undertook structural studies of TLR4-MD-2 and its complex with Eritoran. To determine the structure of the mouse TLR4-MD-2 complex, the full-length ectodomains of mouse TLR4 and MD-2 were expressed in cultured insect cells using recombinant baculoviruses. The mouse TLR4 and MD-2 proteins form a stable 1:1 complex and are not separated during purification. In the crystal structure, one molecule of MD-2 binds to each TLR4, confirming previous reports that only monomeric MD-2 interacts with TLR4 and mediates LPS signaling (Figure 1) (Gioannini et al., 2004Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Coussens N.P. Dockstader W. Ramaswamy S. Weiss J.P.

The crystal structure shows that TLR4 is an unusual member of the “typical” subfamily of the LRR superfamily. Typical subfamily LRR proteins have characteristic horseshoe-like structures whose concave surface is formed by parallel β strands and whose convex surface is formed by loops and 310 helices (Kajava, 1998Kajava A.V. Structural diversity of leucine-rich repeat proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, Kobe and Kajava, 2001Kobe B. Kajava A.V. The leucine-rich repeat as a protein recognition motif.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). The parallel β sheet of the typical subfamily has uniform twist angles and radii throughout the entire protein. Unlike other typical family members including TLR3, analysis of the β sheet conformation of TLR4 demonstrates that it can be divided into N-, central, and C-terminal domains and undergoes sharp structural transitions at the domain boundaries (Figures 1A–1C and S1 and Table S1). The N-terminal domain starts from amino acid residue 26 and ends at residue 201 and contains the LRRNT module and LRR modules 1 to 6 (Figure 2). The LRRNT module has no sequence homology with the LRR modules and protects the otherwise exposed hydrophobic cores of the LRR modules. The sequences of the six LRR modules in the N-terminal domain agree well with the conserved pattern of LRR modules of the typical subfamily. The radius and twist angle of the N-terminal domain also agree well with those of typical LRR subfamily members (Table S1). The C-terminal domain of TLR4 contains the LRRCT module and LRR modules 13 to 22. The radius of the β sheet of the C-terminal domain is 28% larger than that of the N-terminal domain. Like LRRNT, the LRRCT module contains two disulfide bonds and covers the hydrophobic core of the LRR modules at the C terminus. The central domain is composed of LRR modules 7 to 12 and has a 35% smaller radius and three times greater twist angles than those of TLR3 (Table S1). It includes the “hypervariable” region that is essential for recognition of an LPS variant from P. aeruginosa (Hajjar et al., 2002Hajjar A.M. Ernst R.K. Tsai J.H. Wilson C.B. Miller S.I. Human Toll-like receptor 4 recognizes host-specific LPS modifications.Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). The conformational variation of the central domain appears to originate from three changes in its sequence conservation pattern (Figure 2). (1) The standard LRR module contains two variable amino acids between the first and second conserved leucines. However, the LRR modules of the central domain have only one variable residue. (2) Signature residues important in the structure of the “typical” subfamily LRR proteins are missing from the central domain. In the typical subfamily, the conserved asparagines form a continuous hydrogen-bonding ladder and the phenylalanines form a hydrophobic spine (He et al., 2003He X.L. Bazan J.F. McDermott G. Park J.B. Wang K. Tessier-Lavigne M. He Z. Garcia K.C. Structure of the Nogo receptor ectodomain: a recognition module implicated in myelin inhibition.Neuron. 2003; 38: 177-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, Kim et al., 2007Kim H.M. Oh S.C. Lim K.J. Kasamatsu J. Heo J.Y. Park B.S. Lee H. Yoo O.J. Kasahara M. Lee J.O. Structural diversity of the hagfish variable lymphocyte receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6726-6732Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In TLR4, the asparagine ladder is absent from LRR modules 9 ∼12 and the phenylalanine spine is broken at the border between the central and the C-terminal domain. (3) The lengths of the LRR modules of the central domain vary considerably, ranging from 20 to 30 amino acid residues. The length of the LRR module is strongly correlated with the overall shape of the horseshoe-like structure. The LRR superfamily consists of six subfamilies, within which the lengths of the LRR modules are conserved (Kajava, 1998Kajava A.V. Structural diversity of leucine-rich repeat proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, Kobe and Kajava, 2001Kobe B. Kajava A.V. The leucine-rich repeat as a protein recognition motif.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Subfamilies with shorter LRR modules have loops in their convex regions, and those with longer ones have α-helical structures. Since an α helix requires more space than loops, the horseshoe-like structures with longer LRR modules have smaller radii. Thus the large variation in the length of the LRR modules appears to affect the radius and shape of the horseshoe-like structure of the central domain. MD-2 adopts a β cup fold with two antiparallel β sheets that contain three and six β strands, respectively (Figure 1D). The β cup fold is different from the immunoglobulin fold although both of them contain sandwiched antiparallel β sheets (Derewenda et al., 2002Derewenda U. Li J. Derewenda Z. Dauter Z. Mueller G.A. Rule G.S. Benjamin D.C. The crystal structure of a major dust mite allergen Der p 2, and its biological implications.J. Mol.

Biol. 2003; 331: 951-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the β cup fold, the two β sheets become separated on one side of the protein and the hydrophobic internal core is open for ligand binding. Furthermore, the conserved disulfide bridge that connects the two β sheets in the immunoglobulin fold is absent from the β cup so that the two sheets can be separated, further permitting the formation of a large internal pocket. The MD-2 pocket is narrow and deep with a total surface area of 1000 Å2. The overall shape and chemical behavior of the pocket appear to be suitable for binding large flat molecules such as LPS that contain multiple hydrophobic acyl chains and negatively charged phosphate groups. The generous internal surface of the pocket is completely lined with hydrophobic residues, and the opening region of the pocket contains positively charged residues that facilitate the binding of LPS. Unlike the majority of globular proteins, MD-2 does not have a sizable hydrophobic core because almost all of its hydrophobic residues are involved in forming the internal pocket. Therefore other structural elements appear to have a more important effect on the stability of the protein. The disulfide bridge connecting Cys25 and Cys51, together with hydrogen bonds between Tyr34, Tyr36, and the backbone atoms of the βC strand, close the bottom of the pocket and stabilize the cup-like structure (Figure 1D). The remaining two disulfide bridges buttress structures of the loops connecting the β strands. The surface of TLR4 that interacts with MD-2 has a long and narrow shape with dimensions 40 × 20 Å (Figure 3A). It can be divided into two chemically and evolutionarily distinct areas, the A and B patches. The A patch is negatively charged and evolutionarily conserved, whereas the B patch is positively charged and located in a less conserved area, although the residues directly interacting with MD-2 are strictly conserved (Figures 3B and 3C). The A and B patches of TLR4 are composed of the residues in the concave surface derived from the “LxLxxN” part of the LRR modules in the N-terminal domain and of the central domain, respectively (Figure 2). The interaction between TLR4 and MD-2 is mediated by an extensive network of charge-enhanced hydrogen bonds (Figure 3A). The negatively charged residues in the A patch interact with the positively charged Arg68 and Lys109 residues in MD-2. The positively charged B patch interacts with negatively charged residues in the loop between the βF strand and the α helix of MD-2. The parts of MD-2 interacting with the A and B patches of TLR4 are named the A′ and B′ patches, respectively, in Figure 3. The large interaction area and the complementary charge distribution over the interaction surface are consistent with the nanomolar binding affinity of TLR4-MD-2 (Hyakushima et al., 2004Hyakushima N. Mitsuzawa H. Nishitani C. Sano H. Kuronuma K. Konishi M. Himi T. Miyake K. Kuroki Y. Interaction of soluble form of recombinant extracellular TLR4 domain with MD-2 enables lipopolysaccharide binding and attenuates TLR4-mediated signaling.J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 6949-6954PubMed Google Scholar). Previous reports support our structural observations. Nishtani et al. have shown that mutations of TLR4 residues Cys29 and Cys40, and a synthetic peptide including the residues from Glu24 to Lys47 of TLR4, block TLR4 binding to MD-2 (Nishitani et al., 2005Nishitani C. Mitsuzawa H. Hyakushima N. Sano H. Matsushima N. Kuroki Y. The Toll-like receptor 4 region Glu24-Pro34 is critical for interaction with MD-2.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, Nishitani et al., 2006Nishitani C. Mitsuzawa H. Sano H. Shimizu T. Matsushima N. Kuroki Y. Toll-like receptor 4 region Glu24-Lys47 is a site for MD-2 binding: importance of CYS29 and CYS40.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38322-38329Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This region is not only important for the structural integrity of the LRRNT module but also contains Asp41, a crucial component of the A patch of TLR4. Mutations of MD-2 residues Cys95, Cys105, Asp99, Asp100, and Asp101 in the B′ patch have also been shown to disrupt TLR4 binding (Re and Strominger, 2003Re F. Strominger J.L. Separate functional domains of human MD-2 mediate Toll-like receptor 4-binding and lipopolysaccharide responsiveness.J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 5272-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To facilitate soluble expression and crystallization of the TLR4-MD-2 complex with bound ligands, we have developed a novel technique that we term the “Hybrid LRR Technique” in this article. Difficulties in producing target proteins in soluble form and in crystallizing them are the two most common obstacles to successful crystallographic studies. These problems can sometimes be bypassed by removing nonessential domains because many proteins have multiple domains linked by flexible loops, and biological function is often dependent on domains much smaller than the full-length protein. All natural LRR proteins including TLR4 have two specialized modules, LRRNT and LRRCT, that cover the otherwise exposed central hydrophobic core of the LRR modules (Kajava, 1998Kajava A.V. Structural diversity of leucine-rich repeat proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, Kobe and Kajava, 2001Kobe B. Kajava A.V. The leucine-rich repeat as a protein recognition motif.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Truncation of the LRR modules in a target protein will also remove these structurally indispensable LRRNT or LRRCT modules. To avoid this problem we fuse truncated fragments of TLR4 with the LRRNT or LRRCT modules from other LRRs. The VLR proteins of hagfish were chosen as fusion partners because all VLR proteins have canonical LRR structures with sequence diversity in their variable regions maximized (Kim et al., 2007Kim H.M. Oh S.C. Lim K.J. Kasamatsu J. Heo J.Y. Park B.S. Lee H. Yoo O.J. Kasahara M. Lee J.O. Structural diversity of the hagfish variable lymphocyte receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6726-6732Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore good fusion partners can be selected from a large pool of diverse VLR proteins. By varying fusion partners and the site of fusion of pairs of proteins, this technique can generate a practically unlimited number of hybrid LRR proteins without loss of structural integrity. After many unsuccessful attempts we realized that the “LxxLxLxxN” regions of the LRR modules would be the best fusion sites because they are highly conserved and their structures are practically invariant (Kajava, 1998Kajava A.V. Structural diversity of leucine-rich repeat proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, Kobe and Kajava, 2001Kobe B. Kajava A.V. The leucine-rich repeat as a protein recognition motif.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar) so that one can predict the structure of the resulting hybrid proteins with great confidence. Relative positions of the conserved residues were strictly preserved at the fusion sites (Table S2). This fusion strategy was surprisingly successful, such that of 15 fusion proteins designed, 7 yielded soluble hybrids (Table S2). Some of the hybrids were tested and found to bind MD-2 and to yield crystals. Furthermore, like the full-length ectodomain of TLR4, the longest TV8 hybrid could be multimerized by LPS (details in the section “Dimerization of the TLR4 and MD-2 complex”). From the analysis of the hybrid structures, we were convinced that the Hybrid LRR Technique did not cause substantial structural changes (See below “Structural rigidity of the LRR modules in the TLR4-VLR hybrids” section) and the complete structure of the ectodomain of human TLR4 was generated by aligning the overlapping regions of the TV8 and VT3 structures (Figure 4). Among the hybrids, MD-2-bound TV3 was successfully crystallized with Eritoran and their complex structure was solved (Figure 5). Eritoran binds to the hydrophobic pocket in human MD-2, and there is no direct interaction between Eritoran and TLR4. The structure formed by the four acyl chains of Eritoran complements the shape of the hydrophobic pocket and snuggly occupies almost 90% of the solvent-accessible volume of the pocket, leaving only a narrow groove near its opening (Figures 5B and 5C). Although the R2 and R3 acyl chains adopt a fully extended conformation, the R2′ and R3′ acyl chains are bent in the middle (Figure 5C). The double bond of the R2′ acyl chain has a cis conformation, and the chain makes a 180 degree turn at the cis double bond to occupy the empty space in the pocket (Figure 5D). The di-glucosamine backbone of Eritoran conserved in all LPS molecules is fully exposed to solvent. Although the di-glucosamine sugars do not interact directly with MD-2, the two phosphate groups attached to the backbone form ionic bonds with several positively charged residues located at the opening of the pocket (Figures 5D and 5E). This is consistent with biochemical studies showing that the di-glucosamine groups are dispensable for binding of synthetic ligands derived from LPS to MD-2, whereas the phosphate groups are essential (Brandenburg et al., 2004Brandenburg K. Hawkins L. Garidel P. Andra J. Muller M. Heine H. Koch M.H. Seydel U. Structural polymorphism and endotoxic activity of synthetic phospholipid-like amphiphiles.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4039-4046Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The TV3 hybrid does not contain the B patch but still forms a stable complex with MD-2, suggesting that the A patch of TLR4 plays the major role in MD-2 interaction. This is consistent with the evolutionary analysis of TLR4 where the A patch shows higher conservation than the B patch (Figure 3C). All the residues involved in the A-A′ patch interaction are present in the TV3-MD-2 complex, and deletion of the B patch induces no substantial structural changes in the interaction of the A and A′ patches. We compared the structures of mouse TLR4 in complex with MD-2 and the human TLR4 without bound MD-2. Mouse and human TLR4 have 62.4% sequence identity and therefore are expected to have highly homologous structures. Indeed, the N- and C-terminal domains of the two TLR4 structures could be superimposed with average Cα rms differences of 0.66 Å and 1.56 Å, respectively (Figure S2). The largest structural differences of the C-terminal domain were located in the LRRCT module, where the insertion of Glu563 in human TLR4 caused a 3.5 Å displacement of the LRRCT module. The central domains differ substantially more in structure than the N- and C-terminal domains. MD-2-bound mouse TLR4 has its LRR9 loop shifted by more than 12 Å, which bends the entire horseshoe-like structure by approximately 20 degrees. The observed structural change is unlikely to be due to the sequence differences between human and mouse TLR4 central domains. These are 56% identical, and residues with clear structural roles are strictly conserved. Instead, the structural change is likely to be caused by MD-2 binding because the LRR9 loop of mouse TLR4 occupies the central region of the B patch and interacts at many points with MD-2 (Figure 3A). Future crystallographic experiments using MD-2-free mouse TLR4 are required to confirm the origin of the structural changes in the central domain. Mouse and human MD-2"

Here, we report a critical role for the osteoclastic estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) in mediating estrogen-dependent bone maintenance in female mice. We selectively ablated ERalpha in differentiated osteoclasts (ERalpha(DeltaOc/DeltaOc)) and found that ERalpha(DeltaOc/DeltaOc) females, but not males, exhibited trabecular bone loss, similar to the osteoporotic bone phenotype in postmenopausal women. Further, we show that estrogen induced apoptosis and upregulation of Fas ligand (FasL) expression in osteoclasts of the trabecular bones of WT but not ERalpha(DeltaOc/DeltaOc) mice. The expression of ERalpha was also required for the induction of apoptosis by tamoxifen and estrogen in cultured osteoclasts. Our results support a model in which estrogen regulates the life span of mature osteoclasts via the induction of the Fas/FasL system, thereby providing an explanation for the osteoprotective function of estrogen as well as SERMs."
https://openalex.org/W2000900144,"The phenomenon of entanglement is a key concept in quantum information science. Atomic systems are promising candidates for quantum 'memories'. These in turn can be coupled and entangled by the exchange of photons, providing the basis of a quantum information processor. The signature of entanglement between remotely located atomic ensembles was recently demonstrated. Now Moehring et al. have achieved entanglement between two single-ion quantum memories separated by a metre. The use of single ions, rather than atomic ensembles, has certain advantages for subsequent quantum operations. Entanglement between two single-ion quantum memories separated by a metre has been achieved. The use of single ions, rather than atomic ensembles, has distinct advantages for subsequent quantum operations: long coherence times, enhanced stability, and ease of measurement without ejection of the ion from the trap. Quantum information science involves the storage, manipulation and communication of information encoded in quantum systems, where the phenomena of superposition and entanglement can provide enhancements over what is possible classically1,2. Large-scale quantum information processors require stable and addressable quantum memories, usually in the form of fixed quantum bits (qubits), and a means of transferring and entangling the quantum information between memories that may be separated by macroscopic or even geographic distances. Atomic systems are excellent quantum memories, because appropriate internal electronic states can coherently store qubits over very long timescales. Photons, on the other hand, are the natural platform for the distribution of quantum information between remote qubits, given their ability to traverse large distances with little perturbation. Recently, there has been considerable progress in coupling small samples of atomic gases through photonic channels2,3, including the entanglement between light and atoms4,5 and the observation of entanglement signatures between remotely located atomic ensembles6,7,8. In contrast to atomic ensembles, single-atom quantum memories allow the implementation of conditional quantum gates through photonic channels2,9, a key requirement for quantum computing. Along these lines, individual atoms have been coupled to photons in cavities2,10,11,12, and trapped atoms have been linked to emitted photons in free space13,14,15,16,17. Here we demonstrate the entanglement of two fixed single-atom quantum memories separated by one metre. Two remotely located trapped atomic ions each emit a single photon, and the interference and detection of these photons signals the entanglement of the atomic qubits. We characterize the entangled pair by directly measuring qubit correlations with near-perfect detection efficiency. Although this entanglement method is probabilistic, it is still in principle useful for subsequent quantum operations and scalable quantum information applications18,19,20."

https://openalex.org/W1992841021,"IKKbeta-dependent NF-kappaB activation plays a key role in innate immunity and inflammation, and inhibition of IKKbeta has been considered as a likely anti-inflammatory therapy. Surprisingly, however, mice with a targeted IKKbeta deletion in myeloid cells are more susceptible to endotoxin-induced shock than control mice. Increased endotoxin susceptibility is associated with elevated plasma IL-1beta as a result of increased pro-IL-1beta processing, which was also seen upon bacterial infection. In macrophages enhanced pro-IL-1beta processing depends on caspase-1, whose activation is inhibited by NF-kappaB-dependent gene products. In neutrophils, however, IL-1beta secretion is caspase-1 independent and depends on serine proteases, whose activity is also inhibited by NF-kappaB gene products. Prolonged pharmacologic inhibition of IKKbeta also augments IL-1beta secretion upon endotoxin challenge. These results unravel an unanticipated role for IKKbeta-dependent NF-kappaB signaling in the negative control of IL-1beta production and highlight potential complications of long-term IKKbeta inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2076828243,"There are various subtle ways of triggering phase change in a solid: for example, by using a pulse of light or electrical current to inject 'hot' charges that change the electronic state of a system. Rini et al. now report a very different approach, the use of ultrafast pulses of terahertz radiation to excite an individual vibrational mode in a magneto-resistive manganite. In this system, which has strongly correlated electrons, even subtle changes of crystal structure can profoundly effect the electronic and magnetic properties. The activated vibration is sufficient to drive the material from a stable insulating phase to a metastable metallic one. Phase control by coherent manipulation of selected vibrational modes — metal–oxygen phonons in particular — could find application in other complex solids; for example, in addressing how Cu–O vibrations affect the electronic properties of high-temperature superconductors. Ultrafast pulses of terahertz radiation are used to excite individual vibrational modes in a magnetoresistive manganite. In a system such as this, with strongly correlated electrons, even subtle changes of crystal structure can have a profound effect on material properties, and this is indeed what they see: the activated vibration is sufficient to drive the material from a stable insulating phase to a metastable metallic one. Controlling a phase of matter by coherently manipulating specific vibrational modes has long been an attractive (yet elusive) goal for ultrafast science. Solids with strongly correlated electrons, in which even subtle crystallographic distortions can result in colossal changes of the electronic and magnetic properties, could be directed between competing phases by such selective vibrational excitation. In this way, the dynamics of the electronic ground state of the system become accessible, and new insight into the underlying physics might be gained. Here we report the ultrafast switching of the electronic phase of a magnetoresistive manganite via direct excitation of a phonon mode at 71 meV (17 THz). A prompt, five-order-of-magnitude drop in resistivity is observed, associated with a non-equilibrium transition from the stable insulating phase to a metastable metallic phase. In contrast with light-induced1,2,3 and current-driven4 phase transitions, the vibrationally driven bandgap collapse observed here is not related to hot-carrier injection and is uniquely attributed to a large-amplitude Mn–O distortion. This corresponds to a perturbation of the perovskite-structure tolerance factor, which in turn controls the electronic bandwidth via inter-site orbital overlap5,6. Phase control by coherent manipulation of selected metal–oxygen phonons should find extensive application in other complex solids—notably in copper oxide superconductors, in which the role of Cu–O vibrations on the electronic properties is currently controversial."
https://openalex.org/W2146907709,"Traditional medicines provide fertile ground for modern drug development, but first they must pass along a pathway of discovery, isolation, and mechanistic studies before eventual deployment in the clinic. Here, we highlight the challenges along this route, focusing on the compounds artemisinin, triptolide, celastrol, capsaicin, and curcumin. Traditional medicines provide fertile ground for modern drug development, but first they must pass along a pathway of discovery, isolation, and mechanistic studies before eventual deployment in the clinic. Here, we highlight the challenges along this route, focusing on the compounds artemisinin, triptolide, celastrol, capsaicin, and curcumin. Traditional medicines continue to provide front-line pharmacotherapy for many millions of people worldwide. Although their application is often viewed with skepticism by the Western medical establishment, medicinal extracts used in ancient medical traditions such as Ayurveda on the Indian subcontinent and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are a rich source of therapeutic leads for the pharmaceutical industry. The transformation of traditional medicines into modern drugs has its origins in the archetypal examples of the antimalarial quinine and the antipyretic analgesic aspirin. The alkaloid quinine was isolated in 1820 from the bark of several species of Cinchona, thought to have been used by Peruvian Indians to suppress shivering and used since the 17th century in the treatment of malarial fevers (Greenwood, 1992Greenwood D. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1992; 30: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similarly, aspirin was derived from salicylic acid in the bark of the willow tree (Salix species), used traditionally to treat fever and inflammation in many cultures worldwide for at least four millennia (Mahdi et al., 2006Mahdi J.G. Mahdi A.J. Mahdi A.J. Bowen I.D. Cell Prolif. 2006; 39: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The successes of these two early “blockbuster” drugs set the stage for ongoing drug discovery efforts from traditional medicines. Compounds derived from medicinal extracts are appealing for several reasons (Schmidt et al., 2007Schmidt B.M. Ribnicky D.M. Lipsky P.E. Raskin I. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). They are often stereochemically complex, multi- or macrocyclic molecules with limited likelihood of prior chemical synthesis, and they tend to have interesting biological properties. But perhaps most importantly, parent extracts have been “clinically” tested in their traditional milieu, in some cases over millennia. Despite these advantages, the path from traditional medicine to Western pharmaceutical is fraught with challenges. Here, we discuss the challenges of each of the four steps in this pipeline (see Figure 1): Western “discovery” of a traditional medicine, isolation and/or synthesis of the active component, elucidation of the molecular mechanism, and development as a pharmaceutical. We focus on five interesting and timely examples derived from traditional medicines in varied therapeutic classes, each at a different stage in the development process, highlighting successes and roadblocks on the path to status as a Western drug. The antimalarial artemisinin (and derivatives) represents one of the greatest recent clinical success stories arising from a traditional medicine, echoing the success of quinine two centuries earlier. Artemisinin (see Figure 1) is derived from Artemisia annua L., the sweet wormwood (qinghao), a shrub first documented in TCM in 168 BCE as a hemorrhoid treatment (Liu et al., 2006Liu C. Zhao Y. Wang Y. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2006; 72: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Since at least the fourth century CE, it has been used in the treatment of fever attributed to malaria. This long history of use prompted Chinese researchers to seek the active antimalarial principle; artemisinin was isolated and its structure determined in the mid 1970s (Liu et al., 2006Liu C. Zhao Y. Wang Y. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2006; 72: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Artemisinin, an endoperoxide sesquiterpene lactone with a complex polycyclic ring structure, is modified by Fe2+ ions to structures containing carbon-centered free radicals. Given that the intracellular environment of the Plasmodium malaria parasite is rich in this ion from heme, these radicals are currently thought to be responsible for artemisinin's antimalarial activity. The classic method of cell fractionation after treatment with radiolabeled artemisinin has identified numerous cellular constituents alkylated by artemisinin (Asawamahasakda et al., 1994Asawamahasakda W. Ittarat I. Pu Y.M. Ziffer H. Meshnick S.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 1854-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar); the strongest validated target for artemisinin is PfATP6, the Plasmodium sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA), which is inhibited by artemisinin (Eckstein-Ludwig et al., 2003Eckstein-Ludwig U. Webb R.J. Van Goethem I.D. East J.M. Lee A.G. Kimura M. O'Neill P.M. Bray P.G. Ward S.A. Krishna S. Nature. 2003; 424: 957-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Clinical studies, initiated in the 1970s prior to any mechanistic insights into artemisinin function, demonstrated that artemisinin and its derivatives are powerful antimalarials. They have proved particularly effective for treating severe malaria and, in combination with traditional antimalarials, for combatting Plasmodium drug resistance. Combination therapies containing artemisinin are now considered the treatment of choice for malaria in Asia, with growing adoption in Africa (see Table 1 for information on clinical trials). Artemisinin may also have efficacy against other parasites and as an anticancer compound, possibly acting via antiangiogenic and proapoptotic mechanisms in the latter case (Efferth, 2007Efferth T. Planta Med. 2007; 73: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar).Table 1Five Traditional Medicines in Clinical TrialsCompoundDiseaseClinical TrialsNumberPrincipal SponsorsArtemisininMalaria8131 charities, institutes, universities, and companies based in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Colombia, Ethiopia, France, Gambia, Germany, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, the Netherlands, Papua New Guinea, South Africa, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the USA; and working in numerous Asian, African, and South American locationsCytomegalovirus infection1Hadassah Medical Organization, IsraelSchistosomiasis1Dafra Pharma, BelgiumTriptolide & Celastrol (T. wilfordii extract)Rheumatoid arthritis1National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, MD, USACapsaicinChronic pain13NeurogesX, CA, USA; AlgoRx Pharmaceuticals, NJ, USAPostoperative pain5National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, MD, USA; AlgoRx Pharmaceuticals, NJ, USARadiation-induced mucositis1North Central Cancer Treatment Group, MN, USAAlopecia areata1University of Minnesota, USAMorton's neuroma1AlgoRx Pharmaceuticals, NJ, USAOsteoarthritis1Khon Kaen University, ThailandInterstitial cystitis1National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, MD, USACurcuminColon cancer6Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, CA, USA; Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Israel; Johns Hopkins University, MD, USA; University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, USA; University of Pennsylvania, USA; University of Medicine and Dentistry, NJ, USAPancreatic cancer3Rambam Medical Center, Israel; M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, TX, USA; Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, IsraelAlzheimer's disease2John Douglas French Foundation, CA, USA; Chinese University of Hong KongChemotherapy-induced mucositis1Hadassah Medical Organization, IsraelMultiple myeloma1M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, TX, USAPsoriasis1University of Pennsylvania, USACystic fibrosis1Seer Pharmaceuticals, CT, USAIncludes registered, open, closed, terminated, and completed trials of these compounds, parent extracts, or derivatives.

Data current as of August 21, 2007. Despite these dramatic findings, widespread deployment of artemisinin has been hindered by production difficulties. Although a dozen synthetic routes to artemisinin have been described, all are complex and low yielding, rendering them economically unfeasible (Liu et al., 2006Liu C. Zhao Y. Wang Y. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2006; 72: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Synthetic chemistry has, however, offered semi-synthetic artemisinin derivatives with improved solubility (such as sodium artesunate) and stability (such as artemether) (Efferth, 2007Efferth T. Planta Med. 2007; 73: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Even a totally synthetic trioxolane compound RBX11160 (OZ277), inspired by the trioxane endoperoxide moiety of artemisinin, has shown promise as an antimalarial (Vennerstrom et al., 2004Vennerstrom J.L. Arbe-Barnes S. Brun R. Charman S.A. Chiu F.C. Chollet J. Dong Y. Dorn A. Hunziker D. Matile H. et al.Nature. 2004; 430: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Artemisinin for clinical use is predominantly produced naturally in A. annua plants. Despite efforts to maximize agricultural production, the artemisinin content in plant extracts varies widely due to environmental conditions: 0.01%–0.8% dry weight (Efferth, 2007Efferth T. Planta Med. 2007; 73: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This in turn makes the drug itself expensive—particularly problematic for an antimalarial, which is needed in large quantities in many poorer countries. Cell and plantlet cultures are an appealing alternative source of this compound as they can be grown under much more closely controlled conditions than whole plants. Indeed, useful yields of the compound can be produced by feeding cultures artemisinin precursors (Liu et al., 2006Liu C. Zhao Y. Wang Y. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2006; 72: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). An alternative approach is the genetic engineering of A. annua itself. The plant has proven genetically tractable: Several of the isoprenoid biosynthetic enzymes necessary for artemisinin production have been cloned, and A. annua can be successfully transformed with Agrobacterium tumefaciens to overexpress key biosynthetic genes (Liu et al., 2006Liu C. Zhao Y. Wang Y. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2006; 72: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Perhaps the most promising strategy is the use of microbes to produce artemisinin. In a triumph of genetic engineering, Ro et al. combined genetic activation of the endogenous mevalonate isoprenoid synthesis pathway with introduction of A. annua genes to produce artemisinic acid in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Ro et al., 2006Ro D.K. Paradise E.M. Ouellet M. Fisher K.J. Newman K.L. Ndungu J.M. Ho K.A. Eachus R.A. Ham T.S. Kirby J. et al.Nature. 2006; 440: 940-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). This precursor compound, which can be readily converted to artemisinin in the laboratory, is secreted in large quantities from the yeast. Such creative strategies, leveraging the power of genetics and in vivo biochemistry, can provide a valuable counterpart to synthetic chemistry and natural sources in the production of natural product medicines. Trypterygium wilfordii Hook F., the “thunder god vine” (lei gong teng), is another TCM. This vine has been used traditionally for the treatment of arthritis and other diseases, and it is the source of several biologically active secondary metabolites (Tao and Lipsky, 2000Tao X. Lipsky P.E. Rheum. Dis. Clin. North Am. 2000; 26: 29-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Some of its TCM uses might rely on the presence of multiple active components, and clinical studies have been performed on extracts of the plant (Table 1), rather than on a single compound (Tao and Lipsky, 2000Tao X. Lipsky P.E. Rheum. Dis. Clin. North Am. 2000; 26: 29-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, substantial work has focused on two major bioactive constituent compounds: triptolide and celastrol (Figure 1). Triptolide is a diterpenoid epoxide with a staggering variety of documented cellular effects. Along with anti-inflammatory activity, it shows anticancer, immunosuppressive, and antifertility effects (Qiu and Kao, 2003Qiu D. Kao P.N. Drugs R D. 2003; 4: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). It was isolated in 1972, and several synthetic routes have been described since then (Yang et al., 1998Yang D. Ye X.-Y. Xu M. Pang K.-W. Zou N. Letcher R.M. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 6446-6447Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar and references therein). Like artemisinin, however, triptolide is currently derived from its plant of origin with low yield: 6–16 ng/g in one study (Brinker and Raskin, 2005Brinker A.M. Raskin I. J. Chromatogr. A. 2005; 1070: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Little work has been done to investigate biotechnological routes to triptolide production, which are important to reduce reliance on the natural source. Moreover, continued development of derivatives of triptolide such as the succinyl sodium salt PG490-88 will be valuable to improving the solubility and side-effect profile of this compound (Tao and Lipsky, 2000Tao X. Lipsky P.E. Rheum. Dis. Clin. North Am. 2000; 26: 29-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Determination of triptolide's cellular target has proven to be an even greater challenge. This is not unusual: Many a promising therapeutic natural product has faltered when no clear-cut mechanism of action could be identified. Although progression into the clinic without such knowledge is possible, as was the case with artemisinin, a solid knowledge of molecular mechanism (ideally at the structural, not just the molecular, level) allows medicinal chemists to perform rational derivatization to improve affinity, specificity, pharmacokinetics, and stability. Knowledge of mechanism can also potentially lead to more specific clinical trials and, in cases like triptolide, completely new insights. A large body of work describes triptolide's inhibitory effects on transcription mediated through NF-κB and NFAT (Qiu and Kao, 2003Qiu D. Kao P.N. Drugs R D. 2003; 4: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), but until recently, direct cellular targets were elusive. Nonetheless, careful cell fractionation with [3H]-triptolide enabled identification of the Ca2+ channel polycystin-2 (encoded by the PKD2 gene) as a possible triptolide-binding protein (others also likely exist) (Leuenroth et al., 2007Leuenroth S.J. Okuhara D. Shotwell J.D. Markowitz G.S. Yu Z. Somlo S. Crews C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 4389-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). PKD2 or the gene encoding its activator, PKD1, causes polycystic kidney disease (PKD) when mutated because entry of Ca2+ ions is essential for growth arrest of epithelial cells forming the kidney tubule. Because triptolide activates opening of the polycystin-2 channel, it could potentially complement loss of PKD1. This is the case in a mouse model of polycystic kidney disease in which the mice lack Pkd1 (Leuenroth et al., 2007Leuenroth S.J. Okuhara D. Shotwell J.D. Markowitz G.S. Yu Z. Somlo S. Crews C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 4389-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Thus, this calcium-dependent activity of triptolide, which is unrelated to its transcriptional repression activity (Leuenroth and Crews, 2005Leuenroth S.J. Crews C.M. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 1259-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), opens a new therapeutic avenue for pursuing triptolide, in addition to its effects on the immune and reproductive systems and in cancer. Highlighting the complexity of plant extracts, the pentacyclic triterpene celastrol (Figure 1) is structurally a very different component of T. wilfordii with a divergent therapeutic profile. Celastrol (also known as tripterine) is extracted in small quantities from T. wilfordii or other members of the Celastraceae (bittersweet) family. To our knowledge, no total synthesis or alternative production routes have been reported. Although not yet tested as a single agent in humans (Table 1), celastrol has shown promise as an anti-inflammatory compound in animal models of arthritis, lupus, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease (Sethi et al., 2007Sethi G. Ahn K.S. Pandey M.K. Aggarwal B.B. Blood. 2007; 109: 2727-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar and references therein). It also has antiproliferative effects against numerous cancer cell lines. Several molecular mechanisms have been identified for these effects, including gene expression modulation likely mediated through inhibition of NF-κB via TAK1 and IκBα kinase (Sethi et al., 2007Sethi G. Ahn K.S. Pandey M.K. Aggarwal B.B. Blood. 2007; 109: 2727-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar and references therein), proteasome inhibition, topoisomerase II inhibition, and heat shock response activation (Hieronymus et al., 2006Hieronymus H. Lamb J. Ross K.N. Peng X.P. Clement C. Rodina A. Nieto M. Du J. Stegmaier K. Raj S.M. et al.Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar and references therein). Nonetheless, direct targets remain elusive. As celastrol and triptolide move into human studies, it will be vital not only to better understand their mechanisms of action but also to investigate any potential synergistic effects of the two compounds, both at the cellular and organismal levels. Used worldwide, the alkaloid capsaicin is the main cause of the “hot” sensation associated with chili peppers, members of the genus Capsicum. Beyond their widespread use as a spice, chili peppers were used in the Americas by the Aztecs and Tarahumara Indians as a remedy for coughs and bronchitis. Similar uses plus anti-inflammatory and gastrointestinal applications were adopted in India after the Portuguese imported chili peppers in the late 15th century. In Africa, they are traditionally used internally and externally as antiseptics (Dasgupta and Fowler, 1997Dasgupta P. Fowler C.J. Br. J. Urol. 1997; 80: 845-852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, modern usage of capsaicin is focused on the treatment of various types of pain (see below) and also in the treatment of detrusor hyper-reflexia, a form of urinary incontinence (Dasgupta and Fowler, 1997Dasgupta P. Fowler C.J. Br. J. Urol. 1997; 80: 845-852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). High-dose oral capsaicin also has anticancer properties in some animal model studies but seems to be a cancer promoter in others. Compared with artemisinin, triptolide, and celastrol, capsaicin is chemically quite simple (Figure 1). It was purified and named in the 19th century and first synthesized in the 1920s (Dasgupta and Fowler, 1997Dasgupta P. Fowler C.J. Br. J. Urol. 1997; 80: 845-852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). But the widespread cultivation of Capsicum makes synthesis unnecessary, as large quantities of capsaicin can easily be extracted from readily available peppers. The mechanism of capsaicin in pain induction has been the topic of much neurophysiological research (Cortright et al., 2007Cortright D.N. Krause J.E. Broom D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1772: 978-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Capsaicin, along with thermal heat, directly activates nociceptors in the skin, the sensory neurons responsible for the sensation of pain, with the subsequent release of the neurotransmitter substance P. Capsaicin's therapeutic effect on pain is due to the desensitization and eventual destruction of nociceptors following repeated capsaicin exposure. In a classic example of expression cloning, Caterina et al. identified the capsaicin receptor (Caterina et al., 1997Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6541) Google Scholar). Capsaicin was known to cause Ca2+ ion influx into nociceptors, so these authors transfected a nociceptor cDNA library into nonexcitable HEK293 cells and screened for capsaicin-dependent Ca2+ ion influx. The receptor they cloned, now known as TRPV1, is a Ca2+ ion channel that also responds to, and integrates, signals from piperine (the irritant in black pepper), protons, and other noxious stimuli (Caterina et al., 1997Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6541) Google Scholar). The cloning of TRPV1 kick started the field of pain receptor pharmacology. Numerous pharmaceutical companies are developing both TRPV1 antagonists (to block nociception directly) and agonists (to desensitize nociceptors, as with capsaicin) (Immke and Gavva, 2006Immke D.C. Gavva N.R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 17: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Resiniferatoxin, another traditional medicine from the latex of Euphorbia resinifera, is one such agonist with higher potency than capsaicin (Immke and Gavva, 2006Immke D.C. Gavva N.R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 17: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Efforts continue to create TRPV1 agonists with better skin permeation and lacking the distinctive side effect of a burning sensation on application. Capsaicin itself has been used clinically with moderate success as a topical treatment for the pain of rheumatoid and osteoarthritis, psoriasis, diabetic neuropathy, and postherpetic neuralgia (Table 1), but herein lies the particular challenge with this molecule: The chronic pain disorders are notoriously idiosyncratic, and not all patients or all pain syndromes respond to capsaicin (Immke and Gavva, 2006Immke D.C. Gavva N.R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 17: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The somewhat vague and diffuse traditional uses of this compound offer little assistance here, unlike artemisinin, for instance. Thus, testing for capsaicin efficacy is a matter of clinical trial and error, largely undermining the “tried and true” advantage of a traditional medicine. The major clinical advantage that capsaicin holds over other unrelated pain drugs under development is its approved status as a foodstuff. Like capsaicin, the polyphenol curcumin (Figure 1) is best known as a spice constituent: It is the yellow pigment component of the curry spice turmeric (Curcuma longa, known as haldi in Hindi). It is also, however, a drug used in Ayurveda and TCM in the treatment of diseases as diverse as rheumatism, fever, intestinal disorders, trauma, and amenorrhea (see the Analysis by S. Singh on page 765 of this issue). Modern research has attributed anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antimalarial, and anticancer effects to this multitalented compound (Aggarwal et al., 2007Aggarwal B.B. Sundaram C. Malani N. Ichikawa H. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2007; 595: 1-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). Like capsaicin, synthesis of curcumin is trivial and was first reported in 1910, but sufficient quantities of curcumin for therapeutic use are available from the spice. This is particularly important as low bioavailability of the parent compound coupled with rapid intestinal metabolism dictates large doses for clinical use (Sharma et al., 2005Sharma R.A. Gescher A.J. Steward W.P. Eur. J. Cancer. 2005; 41: 1955-1968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar); derivatization of the natural product is actively being pursued. Given its pleiotropic clinical effects, it is perhaps not surprising that curcumin has documented effects on countless intracellular signaling pathways. Its anti-inflammatory action can be attributed largely to its inhibition of NF-κB activity, COX-2 and 5-LOX expression, and cytokine release (Aggarwal et al., 2007Aggarwal B.B. Sundaram C. Malani N. Ichikawa H. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2007; 595: 1-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). Curcumin may directly target IκBα kinase to block NF-κB. It also binds to a number of other proteins, including thioredoxin reductase, several kinases, and several receptors (Aggarwal et al., 2007Aggarwal B.B. Sundaram C. Malani N. Ichikawa H. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2007; 595: 1-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). The challenge here, then, as with many other natural products, is deciphering which of these targets is mechanistically valid for which biological activity. With such a broad spectrum of potential targets and activities described for curcumin, this is no easy task. Synthesis of derivatives that selectively ablate certain cellular and/or therapeutic effects is one possible route to tease apart this mechanism-function conundrum, perhaps in concert with radiolabeled fractionation experiments (as described above) or affinity chromatography with immobilized curcumin. The very versatility that makes curcumin appealing has also limited its rigorous clinical testing: There are wide-ranging efficacy reports, but most are based on preclinical, anecdotal, or pilot studies rather than on randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials (Hsu and Cheng, 2007Hsu C.H. Cheng A.L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2007; 595: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Activity has been reported in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and numerous cancers, both as a preventative agent and treatment, alone or in combination (Hsu and Cheng, 2007Hsu C.H. Cheng A.L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2007; 595: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The relative ease and rapid payoff of undertaking preclinical or pilot studies, compared to rigorous clinical trials, has slowed the formal validation of curcumin. This is confounded by limited pharmaceutical company interest because curcumin itself is not patentable (although synthetic methods, derivatives, and pharmaceutical formulations are) and by the perception that, as a foodstuff, curcumin is more a nutraceutical (perhaps a dietary cancer preventative) than a traditional drug. This perception can only be changed by clinical studies showing successful disease treatment with curcumin. Phase I studies have documented tolerance up to 8000 mg/day, allowing a large dose-response range to be tested in phase II studies, several of which are underway for the treatment of cancer, psoriasis, and Alzheimer's disease (Table 1) (Hsu and Cheng, 2007Hsu C.H. Cheng A.L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2007; 595: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We must await the outcomes of these studies before curcumin can be validated as a pharmaceutical. An effective drug should be facile and economical to produce and deliver, should display favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) characteristics, and should treat the targeted disease with specificity and efficacy. Traditional medicines, as with other natural products, can offer powerful leads for therapeutic development because (unlike synthetic libraries) they already have documented effects on the organism. However, the process from plant to product is a slow one. Despite the oft-shared limitations noted here, these five examples of traditional medicines are exceptional in the extent to which they have been studied and the success they have achieved in the clinic; countless other promising compounds wallow in obscurity. The challenges are formidable (Figure 1): Ethnopharmacologists must identify a medicine, its uses, and active components. These efforts are urgent, as traditional knowledge—and traditional plant species—are being lost at an alarming rate. Chemists must then synthesize the compound using a cost-effective method or develop alternative processes such as cell culture or transgenesis to enable useful-scale production. Despite continuing advances in synthetic chemistry, the very complexity of many natural products that is responsible for their desirable biological function can make production difficult. With a reliable supply of compound available, biologists can then identify and validate cellular targets and mechanisms of action. New tools are sorely needed for this particularly daunting challenge, such as methods that compare the phenotypic or gene expression profiles induced by a small molecule to those induced by known compounds (Hieronymus et al., 2006Hieronymus H. Lamb J. Ross K.N. Peng X.P. Clement C. Rodina A. Nieto M. Du J. Stegmaier K. Raj S.M. et al.Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) or chemical enhancer/suppressor screens. Development of in silico tools to “dock” small molecules with protein structures to provide models for testing in vitro will likely come into their own with advances in structural genomics, as sufficient computational power becomes available. Ideally with a mechanism in hand, clinicians must then test the compound in the disease of interest (Table 1) while keeping an open mind for unexpected therapeutic activities and working with medicinal chemists to produce derivatives with improved ADMET properties. Finally, regulatory approval must be obtained, as with all drugs. This is particularly problematic if the active principle is an extract or mixture, rather than an isolated compound; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been understandably reluctant to approve multiple-agent drugs until recently (Schmidt et al., 2007Schmidt B.M. Ribnicky D.M. Lipsky P.E. Raskin I. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Only in 2006 was the first such drug approved: Polyphenon E (MediGene), a topical antiviral prepared from catechins extracted from green tea (Camellia sinensis). Artemisinin, triptolide, celastrol, capsaicin, and curcumin are “poster children” for the power and promise of turning traditional medicines into modern drugs. However, their stories highlight the ongoing interdisciplinary research efforts that continue to be necessary to realize the pharmaceutical potential of traditional therapeutics.

https://openalex.org/W2072791837,"Maintenance of CG methylation ((m)CG) patterns is essential for chromatin-mediated epigenetic regulation of transcription in plants and mammals. However, functional links between (m)CG and other epigenetic mechanisms in vivo remain obscure. Using successive generations of an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant deficient in maintaining (m)CG, we find that (m)CG loss triggers genome-wide activation of alternative epigenetic mechanisms. However, these mechanisms, which involve RNA-directed DNA methylation, inhibiting expression of DNA demethylases, and retargeting of histone H3K9 methylation, act in a stochastic and uncoordinated fashion. As a result, new and aberrant epigenetic patterns are progressively formed over several plant generations in the absence of (m)CG. Interestingly, the unconventional redistribution of epigenetic marks is necessary to ""rescue"" the loss of (m)CG, since mutant plants impaired in rescue activities are severely dwarfed and sterile. Our results provide evidence that (m)CG is a central coordinator of epigenetic memory that secures stable transgenerational inheritance in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2106462936,"Organisms maintain the correct balance of intracellular metals primarily through metal-sensing proteins that control transport and storage of the target ion(s). Here, we reveal the basis of metal sensing and genetic control by a metalloregulatory RNA. Our data demonstrate that a previously uncharacterized orphan riboswitch, renamed the “M-box,” is a divalent metal-sensing RNA involved in Mg2+ homeostasis. A combination of genetic, biochemical, and biophysical techniques demonstrate that Mg2+ induces a compacted tertiary architecture for M-box RNAs that regulates the accessibility of nucleotides involved in genetic control. Molecular details are provided by crystallographic structure determination of a Mg2+-bound M-box RNA. Given the distribution of this RNA element, it may constitute a common mode for bacterial metal ion regulation, and its discovery suggests the possibility of additional RNA-based metal sensors in modern and primordial organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2154040307,"Natural transformation is a mechanism for genetic exchange in many bacterial genera. It proceeds through the uptake of exogenous DNA and subsequent homology-dependent integration into the genome. In Streptococcus pneumoniae, this integration requires the ubiquitous recombinase, RecA, and DprA, a protein of unknown function widely conserved in bacteria. To unravel the role of DprA, we have studied the properties of the purified S. pneumoniae protein and its Bacillus subtilis ortholog (Smf). We report that DprA and Smf bind cooperatively to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and that these proteins both self-interact and interact with RecA. We demonstrate that DprA-RecA-ssDNA filaments are produced and that these filaments catalyze the homology-dependent formation of joint molecules. Finally, we show that while the Escherichia coli ssDNA-binding protein SSB limits access of RecA to ssDNA, DprA lowers this barrier. We propose that DprA is a new member of the recombination-mediator protein family, dedicated to natural bacterial transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2060667756,"Sox9 is a transcription factor that is essential for chondrocyte differentiation and chondrocyte-specific gene expression. However, the precise mechanism of Sox9 activation during chondrogenesis is not fully understood. To investigate this mechanism, we performed functional gene screening to identify genes that activate SOX9-dependent transcription, using full-length cDNA libraries generated from a murine chondrogenic cell line, ATDC5. Screening revealed that TRPV4 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 4), a cation channel molecule, significantly elevates SOX9-dependent reporter activity. Microarray and quantitative real time PCR analyses demonstrated that during chondrogenesis in ATDC5 and C3H10T1/2 (a murine mesenchymal stem cell line), the expression pattern of TRPV4 was similar to the expression patterns of chondrogenic marker genes, such as type II collagen and aggrecan. Activation of TRPV4 by a pharmacological activator induced SOX9-dependent reporter activity, and this effect was abolished by the addition of the TRPV antagonist ruthenium red or by using a small interfering RNA for TRPV4. The SOX9-dependent reporter activity due to TRPV4 activation was abrogated by both EGTA and a calmodulin inhibitor, suggesting that the Ca2+/calmodulin signal is essential in this process. Furthermore, activation of TRPV4 in concert with insulin activity in ATDC5 cells or in concert with bone morphogenetic protein-2 in C3H10T1/2 cells promoted synthesis of sulfated glycosaminoglycan, but activation of TRPV4 had no effect alone. We showed that activation of TRPV4 increased the steady-state levels of SOX9 mRNA and protein and SOX6 mRNA. Taken together, our results suggest that TRPV4 regulates the SOX9 pathway and contributes to the process of chondrogenesis.

Taken together, our results suggest that TRPV4 regulates the SOX9 pathway and contributes to the process of chondrogenesis. Chondrogenesis is an important biological event for endochondral bone development, skeletogenesis, and tissue patterning (1Kronenberg H.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar, 2de Crombrugghe B. Kim V. Behringer R.R. Bi W. Murakami S. Huang W. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The first step in chondrogenesis is the aggregation of mesenchymal cells into prechondrogenic condensations. These condensations start to express cartilage-specific genes and further differentiate into mature chondrocytes. In the growth plate, chondrocytes proliferate and further differentiate into hypertrophic chondrocytes. The control of chondrogenic differentiation and hypertrophy plays a pivotal role in the process. Dysregulation of either step leads to severe skeletal dysplasia in both mice and humans (3Zelzer E. Kim B.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The transcription factor Sox9 (SRY (sex-related Y)-type high mobility group box), which contains a SRY-related high mobility group box, has an essential role in the chondrocyte differentiation pathway (4Akiyama H. Kim M.C. Martin J.F. Schedl A. de Crombrugghe B. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2813-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar, 5Bi W. Kim J.M. Zhang Z. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Nat.

Heterozygous mutations in the SOX9 gene cause campomelic dysplasia characterized by severe chondrodysplasia (10Giordano J. Kim H.M. Bamforth J.S. Walter M.A. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 98: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Sox9 heterozygous mutant mice and mice lacking SOX9 function show impaired endochondral bone formation (4Akiyama H. Kim M.C.

Genet. 1999; 22: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). Sox9 is also involved in the expression of Sox5 and Sox6, both of which form the transcriptional complex with Sox9 and control the expression of type II collagen and aggrecan (4Akiyama H. Kim M.C.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that Sox9 plays essential roles in chondrogenesis. Although several molecules involved in chondrocyte differentiation have been identified, the mechanism of chondrogenesis is not fully understood. Identification of the mechanisms that control expression and activity of Sox9 would provide important insights into the regulation of chondrogenesis. We recently established a powerful functional cDNA screening system to identify molecules involved in NF-κB 2The abbreviations used are: NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; FBS, fetal bovine serum; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; MOI, multiplicity of infection; 4α-PDD, 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate; RR, ruthenium red; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; RT, reverse transcription; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; Ad-shVR4, adenovirus expressing an shRNA against the TRPV4 gene; FAM, 6-carboxyfluorescein; TAMRA, 6-carboxy tetramethyl rhodamine. and MAPK signaling pathways, and we successfully identified many potential activators of these signals (12Matsuda A.

That study and others provided a genome-wide screening method based on large scale cDNA transfection and showed that, as a functional genomics method, large scale transfection linked to functional screening is an effective approach for searching for genes related to specific functions (12Matsuda A.

In the present study, we used a similar approach for identifying additional components and modulators that are involved in the regulation of Sox9 and chondrocyte differentiation. We constructed full-length cDNA libraries derived from ATDC5 cells using the oligo-capping method (17Maruyama K. Kim S. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 138: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 18Suzuki Y. Kim K. Maruyama K. Suyama A. Sugano S. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 200: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and screened the libraries by performing a luciferase reporter assay using the SOX9-dependent type II collagen gene promoter. We isolated several positive cDNA clones that clearly stimulated the reporter gene and identified TRPV4 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 4) acting as a SOX9 regulator during chondrogenesis. Thus, our findings reveal novel functional roles for TRPV4 in chondrocyte differentiation. Cell Culture and Analysis of Chondrocytic Differentiation—ATDC5, a murine chondrogenic cell line, was obtained from the RIKEN cell bank (Tsukuba, Japan) and cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and Ham’s F-12 medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% FBS, 10 μg/ml human transferrin (Sigma), and 3 × 10-8 m sodium selenite (Wako) (19Atsumi T. Kim Y. Kimata K. Ikawa Y. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 30: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). A murine mesenchymal stem cell line, C3H10T1/2, was obtained from the RIKEN cell bank (Tsukuba, Japan) and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% FBS. To induce chondrogenic differentiation, bovine insulin (Sigma) was added to the medium at a concentration of 10 μg/ml for ATDC5 cells, and an appropriate concentration of human recombinant bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) (R & D Systems) was added to C3H10T1/2 cells. The medium was replaced once every 2 days. To evaluate chondrocyte differentiation, cells were fixed with 95% methanol and stained with 0.1% Alcian blue 8GS (Sigma) in 0.1 n HCl overnight. Alcian blue-stained cultures were extracted with 6 m guanidine HCl for 2 h at room temperature. Optical density of the extracted dye was measured at 620 nm. Construction of Full-length cDNA Library and Arrayed cDNA Pool—ATDC5 cells were cultured with or without 10 μg/ml bovine insulin for 4 days. RNA samples were prepared from both samples and used for the construction of full-length cDNA libraries in the pME18S-FL3 mammalian expression vector (GenBank™ accession number AB009864). The procedure for constructing the full-length cDNA library using the oligo-capping method is described elsewhere (17Maruyama K. Kim S. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 138: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 18Suzuki Y. Kim K. Maruyama K. Suyama A. Sugano S. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 200: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We randomly isolated 40,000 cDNA clones from the cDNA library of ATDC5 cells stimulated with insulin and 80,000 cDNA clones from the library without insulin. In total, 120,000 cDNA clones were isolated and used to construct an arrayed cDNA pool in 96-well microtiter plates. Plasmid DNAs were purified using QIAwell 96 Ultra Plasmid Kits (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Screening of the Full-length cDNA Library—SOX9-dependent transcription was measured by using a reporter construct, tentatively named 4Col2E-Luc, which contained four tandem 48-bp chondrocyte-specific enhancer segments of type II collagen α1(Col2a1) in the pGL3 Basic vector (Promega), as previously reported (6Lefebvre V. Kim W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lefebvre V. Kim G. Mukhopadhyay K. Smith C.N. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. Zhou X. Sinha S. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4512-4523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reporter assays were performed using transient transfection. In each well of a 96-well microtiter plate, ATDC5 cells were inoculated at a density of 7.5 × 103 cells/well and cultured overnight prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with 50 ng of each cDNA clone and 100 ng of reporter plasmid using 0.3 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Immediately after transfection, ATDC5 cells were stimulated with 5 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor-1 (Roche Applied Science). At 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured using PicaGeneLT2.0 (Toyo B-Net). cDNAs that produced more than 2-fold induction of luciferase activity relative to the parental plasmid (pME18S-FL3), the mock control, were defined as positive clones. Preparation of Tissue Samples—Primary murine chondrocytes were prepared from the rib cages of 4-week-old DDY mice (Nihon SLC) by collagenase digestion (0.2% collagenase (Wako) in phosphate-buffered saline) after adherent connective tissue and muscle was thoroughly removed by trypsin and collagenase pretreatment. Then cells were subjected to RNA extraction. Articular cartilage tissues were surgically prepared from femoral condyles and the tibial plateaus of 12-week-old ICR mice (Clea Japan). Embryonic hind limb buds were surgically prepared from embryonic day 12 embryos of DDY mice. Both tissues were then subjected to RNA extraction. Quantitative and Conventional Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from cells using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) with DNase I (Qiagen) treatment, and 0.5 μg of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The cDNAs were then used for quantitative RT-PCR, the products of which were analyzed using an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system. Expression values were normalized to ribosomal protein RPL19. The following oligonucleotides were used. The dual fluorophore-labeled sequence for mouse TRPV4 was 5′-FAM-TCAGCCACTGGAGGGCACGC-TAMRA-3′, and the PCR primers were 5′-TCTTCACCCTCACCGCCTACT-3′ and 5′-TCCACTGTGGTCCGGTAAG-3′; for mouse COL2A1, the dual fluorophore-labeled primer was 5′-FAM-ACTGAGGGCTCCCAGAACATCACCTA-TAMRA-3′, and the PCR primers were 5′-TCCAGATGACTTTCCTCCGTCTA-3′ and 5′-AGGTAGGCGATGCTGTTCTTACA-3′; for mouse aggrecan, the dual fluorophore-labeled primer was 5′-FAM-CGTGTAAAAAGGGCACCGTGGCC-TAMRA-3′, and the PCR primers were 5′-GCATGAGAGAGGCGAATGGA-3′ and 5′-CTGATCTCGTAGCGATCTTTCTTCT-3′; for mouse SOX6, the dual fluorophore-labeled primer was 5′-FAM-CTTACTATGAAGAACAGGCCCGGCT-TAMRA-3′, and the PCR primers were 5′-CATGTCCAACCAGGAGAAGCA-3′ and 5′-GGGTACTTCTCTAGGTGGATTTTGC-3′; for mouse SOX9, the dual fluorophore-labeled primer was 5′-FAM-TGCCTGCTCAGACTATCACCTGTACCTCC-TAMRA-3′, and the PCR primers were 5′-CCATGTGGCCAGCAGATG-3′ and 5′-TTTTAGCACATGGGATGTCTTGAA-3′; for mouse RPL19, the dual fluorophore-labeled primer was 5′-FAM-CATTCCCGGGCTCGTTGC-TAMRA-3′, and the PCR primers were 5′-ATCCGCAAGCCTGTGACTGT-3′ and 5′-TCGGGCCAGGGTGTTTTT-3′; for mouse alkaline phosphatase, the dual fluorophore-labeled primer was 5′-FAM-CGCTGGGCCAAGGATGCTGG-TAMRA-3′, and the PCR primers were 5′-TCAGGGCAATGAGGTCACATC-3′ and 5′-TCACAATGCCCACGGACTT-3′; for mouse osteocalcin, the dual fluorophore-labeled primer was 5′-FAM-TTCATGTCCAAGCAGGAGGGCA-TAMRA-3′, and the PCR primers were 5′-GGCCCTGAGTCTGACAAAGC-3′ and 5′-GCCGGAGTCTGTTCACTACCTT-3′. Reaction conditions were 60 °C for 2 min and then 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s. For analysis of TRPV4 gene expression in cartilaginous tissues, conventional RT-PCR was employed. For amplification of the TRPV4 gene, the PCR primers used were 5′-GTGCACCAACATGAAGGTCTGT-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGTTCTGGTTCCAGTGAG-3′. For the β-actin gene, the PCR primers were 5′-CTAGACTTCGAGCAGGAGATG-3′ and 5′-GACTCATCGTACTCCTGCTTG-3′. Reaction conditions were 94 °C for 3 min and then 35 cycles for TRPV4 and 30 cycles for β-actin of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The PCR products were resolved on 1.2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+—Cellular Ca2+ was estimated using the ratiometric fluorescence Ca2+ indicator Fura-2. ATDC5 cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in assay buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 115 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 13.8 mm glucose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin), containing 5 μm Fura-2 AM (Dojindo) and 0.2% Pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes). The cells were then washed and resuspended in assay buffer. Cellular Ca2+ was measured by ratio imaging of Fura-2 fluorescence (emission at 510 nm with excitation at 340 and 380 nm) using the Functional Drug Screening System 3000 (Hamamatsu Photonics). Reporter Gene Assay—ATDC5 cells were inoculated at a density of 7.5 × 103 cells/well in 96-well microtiter plates and cultured overnight prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with 100 ng of the 4Col2E-Luc reporter plasmid and 10 ng of phRL-TK (Promega) using 0.3 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Six hours after transfection, the medium was replaced by Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 containing 0.5% or 2% FBS, and cells were cultured overnight. On the following day, cells were treated with various concentrations of EGTA or the calmodulin inhibitor W-7 (Calbiochem) for 0.5 to 1 h and then treated with an appropriate concentration of a pharmacological activator of TRPV4, 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4α-PDD; Calbiochem) overnight. Reporter activity originating from 4Col2E-Luc and the internal control, phRL-TK, was measured using the dual luciferase reporter assay system according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega). Preparation of the Adenovirus Vector and RNA Interference—A short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression vector was constructed as described previously (21Brummelkamp T.R. Kim R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3968) Google Scholar). The shRNA expression cassette was then transferred into the SwaI site of the pAxcw cosmid vector (TaKaRa Bio Inc.). A control adenovirus was constructed using an shRNA expression cassette without the RNA interference sequence. Propagation and generation of recombinant adenoviruses were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (TaKaRa Bio Inc.). The RNA interference target sequence for mouse TRPV4 mRNA was 5′-CTGGCAAGAGTGAAATCTACCAGTA-3′. For the RNA interference experiments, ATDC5 cells were infected with the adenovirus construct at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 300. The transfection experiment was carried out 3 days after adenovirus infection, and luciferase activity was measured the following day. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed with Tris-SDS sample buffer, and cell lysates were electrophoretically separated on a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Daiichi Pure Chemical) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with Immuno Block (Dainippon Sumitomo Pharmaceutical) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with anti-SOX9 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-α-tubulin primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Genome-wide Identification of Full-length cDNA Involved in Chondrogenesis—In order to identify genes that are involved in chondrocyte differentiation, we screened full-length cDNA libraries using luciferase reporter assays. In these assays, we used a murine chondrogenic cell line, ATDC5, which mimics chondrogenic differentiation by insulin stimulation, as a host cell and 4Col2E-Luc as a SOX9-dependent Col2a1 reporter construct (Fig. 1). We prepared RNAs from ATDC5 cells treated with and without 10 μg/ml bovine insulin and constructed full-length cDNA libraries on the mammalian expression vector, pME18S-FL3. We randomly isolated 40,000 cDNA clones from the cDNA library of ATDC5 cells stimulated with insulin and 80,000 clones from the library without insulin. Each of the cDNAs in the arrayed format was co-transfected with the reporter gene into ATDC5 cells, and luciferase reporter activity was measured. In total, 120,000 clones were assayed, and each clone with reporter activity that was more than 2-fold higher than that of the parental control plasmid was selected. The selected clones were sequenced from both ends, and BLAST searches were performed against the GenBank™ nonredundant data base. We clustered redundant clones and finally identified 46 genes that activated SOX9-dependent luciferase activity (Table 1). SOX5 and SOX6 were identified among this set of clones. The association of both Sox5 and Sox6 with Sox9 has been previously reported (11Lefebvre V. Kim P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that both molecules act as transcriptional co-activators for Sox9 and are essential for chondrogenic differentiation (22Smits P. Kim P. Mandel J. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Lefebvre V. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 277-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Although many of the genes shown in Table 1 have not been previously reported as being related to chondrogenesis, our result suggests that some genes identified here might be involved in the course of chondrocyte differentiation.TABLE 1Complete list of genes that activated the SOX9-dependent Col2a1 promoter A gene with a more than 2-fold higher level of luciferase activity relative to the mock control was defined as a positive clone. -Fold induction is a ratio of the luciferase activity of each gene to that of the parental plasmid, pME18S-FL3, as a mock control.

For these experiments, we employed cDNA microarray analysis and found that the mRNA levels of TRPV4, interferon-induced transmembrane protein 5, SOX9, and MYD116 were increased during the differentiation of ATDC5 cells (data not shown). In this report, we investigated the TRPV4 cation channel molecule in detail, since it had a strong effect on SOX9-dependent reporter activity (42-fold increase) (Table 1) and its relevance to chondrogenesis remains poorly understood. To confirm the increase in TRPV4 mRNA observed using microarray analysis, we performed quantitative RT-PCR and compared the expression pattern of TRPV4 with that of other chondrogenic marker genes. The expression levels of well known marker genes, such as COL2A1 and aggrecan, were elevated on day 12 after insulin stimulation (Fig. 2A) (19Atsumi T. Kim Y. Kimata K. Ikawa Y. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 30: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 23Shukunami C. Kim C. Atsumi T. Ishizeki K. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The elevation in the levels of the two mRNAs reached about 45-fold for COL2A1 and 110-fold for aggrecan on day 21. TRPV4 mRNA was expressed at significantly high levels on day 12 and peaked on day 14 (Fig. 2A). The maximum induction level of TRPV4 was about 7-fold on day 14. We further examined the expression pattern of the TRPV4 gene using another cell line, C3H10T1/2, a murine mesenchymal stem cell line that is known to differentiate into chondrocytes when stimulated with BMP-2. Expression of the COL2A1 gene was elevated by BMP-2 stimulation and reached about 30-fold on day 7 (Fig. 2B). Although expression of the aggrecan gene was not detected on day 0, it was evident on day 3 after BMP-2 stimulation and increased to about 24-fold on day 7 when compared with day 3 (Fig. 2B). We also observed that TRPV4 gene expression had increased about 30-fold by day 3. TRPV4 and COL2A1 mRNAs had increased significantly on day 1, and an increase in aggrecan mRNA was evident on day 3 after BMP-2 stimulation, suggesting that chondrocyte differentiation in C3H10T1/2 cells proceeds faster than in ATDC5 cells. These results indicate that TRPV4 mRNA is elevated during chondrocyte differentiation. Gene Expression of TRPV4 in Cartilage Tissues—The expression of TRPV4 in several murine tissues has been previously reported; however, its expression in cartilage tissues is still uncertain (24Liedtke W. Kim Y. Marti-Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A. Hudspeth A.J. Friedman J.M. Heller S. Cell. 2000; 103: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). To determine the importance of TRPV4 in chondrogenesis in vivo, we examined the expression of TRPV4 in murine cartilage tissues using RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2C, amplified DNA fragments of predictable size were detected in cartilage tissue of the hind limb in embryonic day 12 embryos and in cartilage tissues of knee joints and primary chondrocytes prepared from the rib cage in adults (Fig. 2C). From these observations, we concluded that the TRPV4 gene is expressed in cartilage tissues as well as in chondrogenic cell lines. These results prompted us to investigate the function of TRPV4 in chondrogenesis. Activation of TRPV4 Promotes SOX9-dependent Transcription—TRPV4 was identified by its ability to elevate SOX9-responsive reporter activity in an ectopic expression experiment. We next examined whether the activation of endogenous TRPV4 resulted in the elevation of SOX9-dependent luciferase activity. For this purpose, we used a pharmacological activator of TRPV4, 4α-PDD, which is a non-protein kinase C-activating phorbol ester derivative, in the following experiments (25Watanabe H. Kim J.B. Smart D. Jerman J.C. Smith G.D. Hayes P. Vriens J. Cairns W. Wissenbach U. Prenen J. Flockerzi V. Droogmans G. Benham C.D. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13569-13577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). We examined the efficacy of 4α-PDD on 4Col2E-Luc reporter activity. As shown in Fig. 3A, 4α-PDD strongly increased 4Col2E-Luc reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner in ATDC5 cells, and this effect was abolished by the addition of 10 μm ruthenium red (RR), a TRPV antagonist (25Watanabe H. Kim J.B. Smart D. Jerman J.C. Smith G.D. Hayes P. Vriens J. Cairns W. Wissenbach U. Prenen J. Flockerzi V. Droogmans G. Benham C.D. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13569-13577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Similar results were also obtained when C3H10T1/2 cells were examined (Fig. 3B). To further confirm that the effect of 4α-PDD on 4Col2E-Luc reporter activity was mediated by TRPV4, we generated an adenovirus expressing an shRNA against the TRPV4 gene (Ad-shVR4) and used it to attempt to inhibit TRPV4 expression. When ATDC5 cells were infected with Ad-shVR4 at an MOI of 300, expres"

Knockdown of SEPT2, 6, and 7 causes stress fibers to disintegrate and cells to lose polarity. We now show that this phenotype is induced by nuclear accumulation of the adaptor protein NCK, as the effects can be reversed or induced by cytoplasmic or nuclear NCK, respectively. NCK is carried into the nucleus by SOCS7 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 7), which possesses nuclear import/export signals. SOCS7 interacts with septins and NCK through distinct domains. DNA damage induces actin and septin rearrangement and rapid nuclear accumulation of NCK and SOCS7. Moreover, NCK expression is essential for cell-cycle arrest. The septin-SOCS7-NCK axis intersects with the canonical DNA damage cascade downstream of ATM/ATR and is essential for p53 Ser15 phosphorylation. These data illuminate an unanticipated connection between septins, SOCS7, NCK signaling, and the DNA damage response.

Since their initial discovery in budding yeast, septins have been identified in all eukaryotes except plants (Longtine et al., 1996Longtine M.S. DeMarini D.J. Valencik M.L. Al-Awar O.S. Fares H.

However, the functions of these proteins in higher organisms remain unclear. There are 13 mammalian septins, as well as multiple splice variants (Hall et al., 2005Hall P.A. Jung K. Hillan K.J. Russell S.E. Expression profiling the human septin gene family.J. Pathol. 2005; 206: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Some are expressed ubiquitously, while others are restricted to specific tissues and to postmitotic cells (Hall et al., 2005Hall P.A. Jung K. Hillan K.J. Russell S.E.

As in yeast, the mammalian septins have been implicated in mitosis and cytokinesis, although their mechanism is unclear (Kinoshita et al., 1997Kinoshita M. Kumar S. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kinoshita A.

Yeast septins are better understood. They organize into a ring at the emerging bud neck and are required for proper cell division (reviewed in Longtine et al., 1996Longtine M.S. DeMarini D.J.

The septin ring also is a key element in morphogenetic checkpoints that respond to DNA damage (Enserink et al., 2006Enserink J.M. Smolka M.B. Zhou H. Kolodner R.D.

Additionally, septins function in the mitotic exit checkpoint as a scaffold for a microtubule sensor (Castillon et al., 2003Castillon G.A. Adames N.R. Rosello C.H. Seidel H.S. Longtine M.S.

Furthermore, SEPT9 can form trimeric complexes with SEPT7 and 11, which in turn colocalize with actin stress fibers (Nagata et al., 2004Nagata K. Asano T. Nozawa Y. Inagaki M. Biochemical and cell biological analyses of a mammalian septin complex, Sept7/9b/11.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55895-55904Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Though a reciprocal relation between septin filaments and actin has been established, the biological relevance of interactions between mammalian septins and the actin cytoskeleton is not well understood. We now describe a novel signaling pathway that links the SEPT2/6/7 complex to actin organization and cell morphology. The septins act through the signaling protein SOCS7 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 7) to restrict the nuclear accumulation of the adaptor protein NCK, which is involved in the coordination of receptor tyrosine kinases, focal adhesions, and the actin cytoskeleton (reviewed in Buday et al., 2002Buday L. Wunderlich L. Tamas P. The Nck family of adapter proteins: regulators of actin cytoskeleton.Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 723-731Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In the absence of septin filaments, SOCS7 recruits NCK into the nucleus. Moreover, depletion of NCK from the cytoplasm triggers the dissolution of actin stress fibers and loss of cell polarity. We have also determined that the association between septins, SOCS7, and NCK plays a role in the DNA damage checkpoint response. NCK rapidly and efficiently enters the nucleus following DNA damage and is necessary for UV-induced cell-cycle arrest. Furthermore, nuclear NCK is essential for activation of the tumor suppressor p53 in response to UV-induced DNA damage. Thus, we have identified a novel link between mammalian septins and actin via the SOCS7/NCK signaling pathway that couples the regulation of the DNA damage response to the cytoskeleton. To characterize the role of mammalian septins in actin organization, we targeted three septins (SEPT2, 6, and 7) that form a heteromeric complex in vivo and in vitro (Joberty et al., 2001Joberty G. Perlungher R.R. Sheffield P.J. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Haystead T. Macara I.G. Borg proteins control septin organization and are negatively regulated by Cdc42.Nat.

The expression of these septins is coupled, so that a reduction in any one of them causes a decrease in the expression of the other two (Kinoshita et al., 2002Kinoshita M. Field C.M. Coughlin M.L.

Mammalian septins regulate microtubule stability through interaction with the microtubule-binding protein MAP4.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4648-4659Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We previously generated a set of siRNAs that efficiently silence SEPT2, 6, and 7 in HeLa cells (Kremer et al., 2005Kremer B.E. Haystead T. Macara I.G. Mammalian septins regulate microtubule stability through interaction with the microtubule-binding protein MAP4.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4648-4659Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Septin depletion grossly affected the actin cytoskeleton and cellular morphology (Figure 1A; see also Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). In control cells, the actin stress fibers were clearly visible and aligned with the long axis of the cell. By contrast, the septin-depleted cells were unpolarized, and actin was present as small fibrils throughout the cell. Any remaining stress fibers lost direction and formed disordered clusters. Similar results were observed following septin depletion in Ref52 and CHO cell lines (data not shown). As an objective measure of cellular morphology, we calculated the mean “shape factor,” 4πA/P2, where A is the cell area and P is the perimeter. Shape factor values vary between 1 (perfect circle), and 0 (straight line). As shown in Figure 1B and Figure S1B, septin knockdown significantly increased the shape factor of the cells. To further examine the septin regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, we tested the ability of septin-depleted cells to spread on a fibronectin-coated surface, a process mediated by focal complexes and actin (reviewed in Martin et al., 2002Martin K.H. Slack J.K. Boerner S.A. Martin C.C. Parsons J.T. Integrin connections map: to infinity and beyond.Science. 2002; 296: 1652-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Control and septin-depleted cells were replated onto fibronectin-coated surfaces and fixed at various time points, and the cellular areas were measured. At t = 5 min, septin-depleted cells were the same size as control-transfected cells (Figures 1C and 1D). However, septin-siRNA-transfected cells spread more rapidly than control cells; after 30 min, they were significantly larger than control cells (Figures 1C and 1D) and had significantly more focal complexes (data not shown). Together, these results show that SEPT2, 6, and 7 are required for normal organization of the actin cytoskeleton and for actin-dependent processes such as cell spreading on extracellular matrix. To determine how septins regulate the actin cytoskeleton, we screened septin-depleted cells for the relocalization of proteins that may impact actin dynamics. Interestingly, the adaptor protein NCK accumulated in the nuclei of septin-depleted cells (Figures 2A and 2B). NCK has two isoforms, NCK1 and NCK2, both of which contain three SH3 domains, an SH2 domain, and no classical nuclear localization signal (NLS). NCK functions in signal transduction from tyrosine kinases to the actin cytoskeleton (reviewed in Buday et al., 2002Buday L. Wunderlich L. Tamas P. The Nck family of adapter proteins: regulators of actin cytoskeleton.Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 723-731Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In control cells, NCK was almost exclusively cytoplasmic (Figure 2B). By contrast, NCK accumulated in the nuclei of virtually all septin-depleted cells. Immunoblots of lysates from NCK-depleted and NCK-overexpressing cells verified that our antibodies were specific and recognized both isoforms of NCK (Figures S2A and S2B). In addition, myc-tagged NCK1 was cytoplasmic when expressed in control cells but became diffuse throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus in septin-depleted cells (Figure 3D). Importantly, this relocalization was specific to NCK. The distribution of the adaptor protein p130Cas was unchanged by septin-siRNA transfection (Figure S2C), even though NCK can bind to p130Cas (Zhu et al., 1998Zhu T. Goh E.L. LeRoith D. Lobie P.E. Growth hormone stimulates the formation of a multiprotein signaling complex involving p130(Cas) and CrkII. Resultant activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK).J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33864-33875Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, septin depletion induces a selective redistribution of NCK to the nucleus. The redistribution of NCK to the nucleus might mediate the septin knockdown phenotype or might simply be an epiphenomenon. To distinguish between these possibilities, we transfected cells simultaneously with siRNAs against sept7, nck1, and nck2. Knockdown efficiency was similar in all cases (Figure 2C). Those cells depleted only of NCK were long and polar, with actin stress fibers aligned along the long axis of the cell, as in control cells. Therefore, the absence of NCK is not sufficient to induce actin reorganization. Cells depleted only of septins were flat and round, as described above (Figures 2D and 2E). Importantly, however, cells reverted to a normal morphology when simultaneously depleted of septins and NCK (Figures 2D and 2E). These cells had a lower shape factor value and contained visible actin stress fibers with normal distribution. We conclude that NCK expression is required for cells to respond to loss of septins and is in a pathway downstream of or parallel to the septin-actin axis. We next asked whether NCK is sequestered in the cytoplasm or instead shuttles constitutively in and out of the nucleus. HeLa cells were treated for 1 hr with leptomycin B (LMB), a specific inhibitor of Crm1-mediated nuclear export (Kudo et al., 1999Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Scheiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Leptomycin B inactivates CRM1/exportin 1 by covalent modification at a cysteine residue in the central conserved region.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). NCK rapidly accumulated in the nucleus after exposure to LMB (Figures S2D and S2E). Therefore, we conclude that endogenous NCK constitutively shuttles between the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments and that septins regulate the dynamics of this process. We next asked whether the redistribution of NCK to the nucleus drives the loss of stress fiber integrity. To address this, we created a fusion of myc-NCK1 with a nuclear export signal (NES) to maintain myc-NCK1 in the cytoplasm. We transfected cells with control or anti-septin siRNAs, then cotransfected them with NES-NCK1 or, as a control, myc-GFP-GFP-RanBP1 (GGBP1), a shuttling protein that is cytoplasmic at steady state (Richards et al., 1996Richards S.A. Lounsbury K.M. Carey K.L. Macara I.G. A nuclear export signal is essential for the cytosolic localization of the Ran binding protein, RanBP1.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1157-1168Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The cells were stained for the myc epitope to identify transfected cells (Figure 3A), as well as for SEPT2 to verify knockdown efficiency (data not shown). In both the control and septin-depleted cells, GGBP1 remained in the cytoplasm, proving that the relocalization of endogenous NCK was not due to a global failure of nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. The expression of GGBP1 did not affect the actin cytoskeleton or cell shape (Figures 3A and 3E). Importantly, however, the constitutively cytoplasmic NES-NCK1 reversed the morphological phenotype induced by septin depletion (Figures 3A and 3E). Additionally, on fibronectin-coated surfaces, septin-depleted cells that expressed the NES-NCK1 fusion no longer spread as rapidly as septin-depleted cells that expressed GGBP1 (Figure 3B) and were indistinguishable in size from wild-type (WT) cells (Figure 3C). Thus, the ectopic expression of a constitutively cytoplasmic NCK can reverse the loss-of-septins phenotype, even though endogenous NCK presumably still accumulates in the nucleus. This result argues that the loss of NCK from the cytoplasm is responsible for the effects of septin depletion on the actin cytoskeleton. To confirm this conclusion, we expressed myc-tagged NCK without an NES. This construct distributed diffusely throughout the cell, both within the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. Nonetheless, it reversed the cell-rounding phenotype (Figures 3D and 3E), supporting the idea that cell rounding is caused by depletion of NCK from the cytoplasm rather than through any specific action of NCK within the nucleus. How can these data be reconciled with our observation that silencing of NCK expression does not disrupt the actin cytoskeleton? One possibility is that the effect is indirect—that nuclear NCK sequesters a binding partner and that the loss of this partner from the cytoplasm causes cell rounding. To test this hypothesis, we expressed a constitutively nuclear NLS-NCK1 fusion protein. Strikingly, the transfected cells lost their polar orientation and became more circular. Moreover, the actin stress fibers dissolved into small, curled filaments, as occurs after septin depletion (Figures 3D and 3E). Therefore, the forced expression of nuclear NCK phenocopied the effects of septin depletion, while elevated cytoplasmic NCK reversed the effects. We conclude that nuclear NCK sequesters an effector that normally acts in the cytoplasm to maintain actin stress fibers and polarized cell morphology. NCK contains no classical NLS or NES. We hypothesized, therefore, that NCK is transported through the nuclear pores by association with an adaptor protein. One NCK-binding protein, SOCS7, contains both an N-terminal leucine-rich region, postulated to be a NES, and a central basic region with homology to a classical monopartite NLS. In addition to the predicted full-length protein, two naturally occurring splice variants of SOCS7 lacking either the NCK-binding domain (SOCS7 ΔNBD) or the NES (NAP4) have been described (Martens et al., 2004Martens N. Wery M. Wang P. Braet F. Gertler A. Hooghe R. Vandenhaute J. Hooghe-Peters E.L. The suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-7 interacts with the actin cytoskeleton through vinexin.Exp.

Gertler A. Hooghe R. Vandenhaute J. Hooghe-Peters E.L. The suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-7 interacts with the actin cytoskeleton through vinexin.Exp.

Commun. 1997; 239: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we expressed myc-tagged NAP4, SOCS7 ΔNBD, or full-length SOCS7 in 293T cells; immunoprecipitated cell lysates with anti-myc antibody; and probed for coprecipitation of endogenous NCK. The NAP4 and full-length SOCS7, but not SOCS7 ΔNBD, coprecipitated specifically with endogenous NCK (Figure S3B). We next verified the functionality of the nuclear traffic signals. Myc-tagged SOCS7 localized to the cytoplasm, while LMB treatment caused the SOCS7 to accumulate in the nucleus (Figure S3C), consistent with sequence information that SOCS7 contains a Crm1-dependent NES. In contrast, myc-NAP4, which contains the putative NLS but lacks the N-terminal NES, was exclusively nuclear. Next, we bound the nuclear import factor Impα3 to beads and added cell lysate containing myc-SOCS7. The myc-SOCS7 specifically coprecipitated with Impα3, demonstrating that SOCS7 contains a bona fide NLS (Figure S3D). To determine whether SOCS7 is the nuclear import factor for NCK, we silenced expression of SOCS7 by RNAi, then treated control or SOCS7-depleted cells with LMB and stained for endogenous NCK. As predicted, NCK accumulated in the nuclei of control-transfected cells after LMB treatment, but SOCS7 depletion greatly reduced the fraction of cells with nuclear NCK (Figures S3E and S3F). Therefore, NCK requires SOCS7 for nuclear import. These results raised the possibility that SOCS7 couples septins to NCK localization. To investigate this idea, we generated antibodies against SOCS7, then immunoprecipitated SEPT6 and assayed for coprecipitation of endogenous SOCS7. SEPT6 specifically coprecipitated a double band that was detected by the anti-SOCS7 antibody (Figure 4A, top). However, at 120–140 kDa, this band was larger than the previously reported size of SOCS7. Therefore, we repeated the coprecipitation in cells transfected with siRNAs against SOCS7. The siRNAs reduced the intensity of the double band by >80% (Figure 4A, bottom), and we conclude that HeLa cells express an unusually long splice variant of SOCS7. Only the shorter SOCS7 variants have been previously characterized, however (Martens et al., 2004Martens N. Wery M. Wang P. Braet F. Gertler A. Hooghe R. Vandenhaute J. Hooghe-Peters E.L.

Commun. 1997; 239: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), so these were used in our further experiments. To identify the specific region of SOCS7 bound by septins, myc-NAP4 or myc-SOCS7 was expressed in HEK293T cells and assayed for binding to endogenous SEPT6. As shown in Figure 4B, full-length SOCS7, but not NAP4, coprecipitated specifically with the septin complex, suggesting that the N-terminal domain of SOCS7 contains the septin binding site. Additionally, the isolated N-terminus of SOCS7 fused to GFP (GFP-SOCS7(1–124)) coprecipitated with the septin complex (Figure 4C). Thus, the N-terminal domain, which contains the NES, is both necessary and sufficient for septin association. Of note, GFP-NCK did not coprecipitate with SEPT6 (Figure 4C). We next asked whether septins regulate SOCS7 localization. In control cells, full-length myc-SOCS7 was predominantly cytoplasmic. However, SOCS7 was no longer excluded from the nucleus following septin depletion (Figures 4C and 4D). To determine whether the relocalization is dependent on NCK binding, we transfected cells with SOCS7 ΔNBD. The distribution of this deletion mutant was indistinguishable from WT, both in control cells and in cells depleted of septins (Figure 4C). Moreover, the ΔNBD mutant accumulated in the nucleus in response to LMB treatment (Figure S3B). We conclude that SOCS7 localization is dependent on septins and that NCK import requires SOCS7 but that SOCS7 import is independent of NCK binding. If SOCS7 is a key component of the septin-NCK-actin pathway, then its absence should block the effects of septin knockdown on both cell morphology/actin organization and NCK localization. To test this prediction, we knocked down SOCS7 and/or septins and examined the morphological response (Figure 5A). Control and SOCS7-depleted cells were long and polar, with well-organized actin stress fibers (Figures 5B and 5C). As expected, cells lacking septins were large and circular, with disordered actin. Importantly, however, cells depleted of both SEPT7 and SOCS7 were indistinguishable from control-transfected cells (Figures 5B and 5C), demonstrating that the septin-d"
https://openalex.org/W2169442239,"Little is known about how synaptic activity is modulated in the central nervous system. We have identified SCRAPPER, a synapse-localized E3 ubiquitin ligase, which regulates neural transmission. SCRAPPER directly binds and ubiquitinates RIM1, a modulator of presynaptic plasticity. In neurons from Scrapper-knockout (SCR-KO) mice, RIM1 had a longer half-life with significant reduction in ubiquitination, indicating that SCRAPPER is the predominant ubiquitin ligase that mediates RIM1 degradation. As anticipated in a RIM1 degradation defect mutant, SCR-KO mice displayed altered electrophysiological synaptic activity, i.e., increased frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. This phenotype of SCR-KO mice was phenocopied by RIM1 overexpression and could be rescued by re-expression of SCRAPPER or knockdown of RIM1. The acute effects of proteasome inhibitors, such as upregulation of RIM1 and the release probability, were blocked by the impairment of SCRAPPER. Thus, SCRAPPER has an essential function in regulating proteasome-mediated degradation of RIM1 required for synaptic tuning."
https://openalex.org/W2143661749,"The global demand for more affordable therapeutics and concerns about side effects of commonly used drugs are refocusing interest on Eastern traditional medicines, particularly those of India and China. The global demand for more affordable therapeutics and concerns about side effects of commonly used drugs are refocusing interest on Eastern traditional medicines, particularly those of India and China. Curcumin, the phytochemical agent in the spice turmeric that gives Indian curry its yellow color and distinctive taste, is also a staple of traditional Indian medicine (including Ayurveda) (see Figure 1). Used for millennia as a wound-healing agent and for treating a variety of ailments, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of curcumin have only recently garnered the attention of researchers interested in its mechanisms of action and clinicians attracted by its therapeutic potential for treating diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Even as publications on curcumin's effects on cell lines and in animal models of disease increase dramatically, there are only 13 clinical trials underway worldwide (see the Essay by T.W. Corson and C.M. Crews, page 769 of this issue). Part of the delay is attributable to a US patent, granted in 1995 to researchers at the University of Mississippi Medical Center for curcumin's wound-healing properties, that prevented its development as a therapeutic. In a landmark case, the Indian Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) spent two years arguing and finally proving that curcumin has been part of the Indian traditional system of medicine for centuries and that this knowledge should be considered “prior art” and hence in the public domain. The patent was finally overturned in 1997. However, many other patents still stand preventing widespread and rigorous development of traditional medicines into modern therapeutics. To establish traditional medicines as “prior art” and so stem the tide of multinational companies rushing to patent herbal compounds, the Indian government has launched an initiative to document and digitize its traditional knowledge. Called the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL), this encyclopedia currently contains 24 million pages, with more than 120,000 formulations from 100 ancient texts and will soon be made available in five languages to patent offices worldwide. “We are currently negotiating with the patent offices in the US, European Union, and Japan to make our library accessible to them for patent examination,” says Vinod Kumar Gupta, the chief architect of TKDL and head of information technology at CSIR in New Delhi. Gupta estimates that about 2000 patents misappropriating Indian traditional resources are granted every year to multinational corporations and nonresident Indian researchers working abroad. Overturning the patent on curcumin has only removed some hurdles to its development as a therapeutic. Given that public knowledge does not involve any intellectual property (IP), drug companies are not interested in its commercialization. “Unless there is an IP to make money, nobody will come forward,” says Bharat Bhushan Aggarwal, whose research group at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas was the first to show that curcumin inhibits the master transcription factor NF-κB that is activated in many human tumors (see the Essay by Corson and Crews on page 769). However, the potential benefits of curcumin are sufficiently compelling that scientists are finding ways to overcome the lack of interest from big pharma. Although curcumin itself is no longer patentable, derivatives, formulations, delivery systems, and synthetic methods can be patented. For instance, Aggarwal founded a company in 2004 called Curry Pharmaceuticals that is developing drugs based on synthetic analogs of curcumin. Another big hurdle to using curcumin clinically is its insolubility in water and hence its poor bioavailability. For free curcumin to be effective as a drug, solubility is crucial so that it can be absorbed by the gut and enter the bloodstream. But since it is excreted from the gut, a patient on curcumin therapy would have to take oral doses of 12 to 20 g, a huge dose given that more than 10 g of curcumin leaves an almost unbearable aftertaste. Thus, scientists are busy developing new delivery mechanisms or combinations of curcumin with other compounds to render curcumin more suitable for clinical use. Anirban Maitra at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland and Amarnath Maitra, a chemistry professor in India's Delhi University, have developed a “nano” formulation of curcumin that is soluble in water. They synthesized nanoparticles that are hydrophilic on the exterior and hydrophobic on the interior and then encapsulated curcumin within these particles. The hydrophilic exterior allows nanocurcumin to be soluble in water enabling it to enter the bloodstream where the biodegradable polymer nanoparticles break down. After positive results using nanocurcumin to kill pancreatic cancer cell lines in the lab, Anirban Maitra is ready to move into animal models. “These studies are aimed at two aspects of cancer—the treatment of established tumors using xenograft models and prevention of cancers in genetically engineered mice,” he says. Meanwhile, Anirban Maitra and Johns Hopkins, which owns the nanocurcumin patent, already have the drug industry interested in their technology as it is easy to produce to GMP (good manufacturing practice) requirements. “A U.S. pharma company is close to licensing our nanocurcumin formulation to develop it for multiple indications, including Alzheimer's and cancer, and take it to the clinic,” says Maitra. Meanwhile a research group at the Indian Institute of Science (IIS) in Bangalore has filed a patent application for a new combination of curcumin and the antimalarial drug artemisinin, a Chinese traditional medicine (see the Essay by Corson and Crews on page 769). The group, supported by India's Department of Biotechnology (DBT) in New Delhi, is testing the combination preclinically and will start clinical trials later this year in India, which has about 2 million cases of malaria annually. Although artemisinin combined with other antimalarial drugs has been used to fight resistance of the malaria parasite to frontline drugs, most of the combinations are less than ideal because of side effects, pharmacokinetic mismatches, and cost. Researchers at IIS point out that the curcumin-artemisinin combination may circumvent some of these problems. “Both are from natural sources of long-term use and so far no resistance is known to curcumin,” says Govindarajan Padmanaban, an IIS principal researcher. Moreover, curcumin is tolerated at very high doses without any toxic side effects, and hence there is potential to decrease the dose of artemisinin and lower the cost of therapy. The problem of poor bioavailability can be overcome by adding a low dose of piperine (from black pepper), which increases the uptake of curcumin by 2000% in humans. “We have an industry partner, Ipca Laboratories, which will manufacture the malaria drugs once the fast-tracked human trials are completed,” says Padmanaban, who believes India will finally have the first “made-in-India” malaria drug at a much lower cost than offered currently by big pharma even with special reduced price programs. With curcumin once more in the public domain, DBT launched eight multi-institution clinical trials nationwide in 2005 and 2006 to investigate curcumin's effects on squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, cervical cancer, oral premalignant cancer, oral fibrosis, and clearance of human papillomavirus. These multicenter trials involve nine hospitals and research institutions across the country, including the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi, Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, Rajiv Gandhi Center for Biotechnology in Thiruvananthapuram, and the National Cancer Institute in Kolkata, and are due to be completed within two to three years. These trials use curcumin formulations that are GMP compliant from two Indian companies: Arjuna Pharmaceuticals, which makes Biocurcumax (95% curcumin in turmeric oil), and Sami Labs, which makes Bio-prene, a preparation of curcumin with piperine. Touted more as a social service for a disease that is expensive to treat in developing nations, DBT's large-scale cancer trials anticipate no proprietary benefits, but if they do see anticancer effects then there are plans to “convert the results in a nano-based delivery or better combinations that could be patented.” “Our study primarily aims to show to the world that if we test this molecule in a systematic manner, we may provide a cheaper way to treat cancer,” says Bindu Dey, director of medical biotechnology at DBT. And in the hopes of discovering profit-yielding formulations of curcumin, DBT is funding the National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research in Mohali in northern India to research patentable formulations of curcumin. Curcumin's potential therapeutic effects have also garnered interest beyond India's borders (see the Essay by Corson and Crews on page 769). Ongoing clinical trials worldwide include investigating curcumin as a treatment for FAP (familial adenomatous polyposis) at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, chronic psoriasis at the University of Pennsylvania, multiple myeloma at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, and pancreatic cancer at Kyoto University in Japan (www.clinicaltrials.gov). A six month randomized placebo-controlled double-blind pilot clinical trial examining curcumin's effects on Alzheimer's disease in 34 patients at the Chinese University of Hong Kong has been completed. Patients were randomized to receive either 4g /day or 1 g/day curcumin or placebo. Researchers saw no difference in adverse events among the three groups. Scores on a simple test of cognitive function (MMSE) did not decline in any of the groups including placebo. “Interestingly, although the serum A-beta peptide level did not differ significantly among doses, the level did tend to rise in patients treated with curcumin, possibly reflecting an ability of curcumin to disaggregate A-beta deposits in the brain, releasing the A-beta for circulation and disposal,” says the trial's principal investigator Lawrence Baum. Encouraged by the findings, Baum intends to start a larger two-year clinical trial with 100–200 Alzheimer's disease patients and using a more comprehensive cognitive function test (ADAS-Cog) to determine whether curcumin can slow cognitive deterioration. As curcumin's beneficial effects are under scrutiny in clinical trials, researchers are trying to unravel the mechanisms underlying its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. “Curcumin is the most effective inhibitor of NF-κB, through which it affects several downstream targets” including gene products involved in blocking apoptosis (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, XIAP), invasion (MMP-9), angiogenesis (VEGF), and metastasis (adhesion molecules), says M.D. Anderson's Aggarwal. Meanwhile, biochemist Gaurisankar Sa at the Bose Institute in Kolkata reported this year that curcumin's anti-tumor effects are mediated in two ways. “We show that curcumin not only boosts the immune system in tumor-bearing mice by restoring CD4 and CD8 T cells, but also increases production of proteins that cause immune cells to proliferate and reduces the production of proteins that destroy immune cells.” Administration of curcumin to tumor-bearing animals resulted in restoration of progenitor, effector, and circulating T cells. “Our observations suggest that curcumin may be used alone or in combination with classical anti-tumor drugs to sustain the immune capacity of the host,” says Sa. Researchers say that most Ayurvedic plants, including curcumin, work by modulating the immune system through different molecular mechanisms. For instance, a polysaccharide in the Ayurvedic plant Tinospora cordifolia, traditionally used to treat throat cancer, induces mitosis of B lymphocytes, says Ashok Vaidya, a clinical pharmacologist and research director of Kasturba Health Society in Mumbai. Agents modulating a single pathway or cellular target may be less effective than a cocktail of botanicals to restore immune system homeostasis. But there are limitations. “You can derive good immunodrugs from traditional medicinal plants but you may never get a strong analgesic, a cytotoxic or a hypolipidemic drug from them,” says Bhushan Patwardhan, professor and director of the Interdisciplinary School of Health Sciences, University of Pune. Several scientific measures have been taken by the Indian government to ensure that drug researchers drawing on the Indian traditional system of medicine start their investigation from standardized and safe botanical material. “A major scientific shift has been the adoption of “reverse pharmacology” for drug development from natural products,” says Patwardhan, who also leads CSIR's New Millennium Indian Technology Leadership Initiative (NMITLI) program on Ayurveda-based herbal drug development. NMITLI was launched in 2002 for fast track, innovation-driven indigenous development of certain areas in science and technology, some of which derive from India's traditional knowledge. Among the first few deliverables of this initiative are three new botanicals for arthritis, diabetes, and hepatitis. “The usual drug development pathway, from laboratory to clinic, is actually reversed in the study of traditionally used herbal medicines. The strategy we are now following is ‘from clinics to laboratories,’” says Patwardhan. In this approach, case studies, case series analyses, observational studies, including cohort studies, all provide data on clinical use and outcomes of Ayurveda. They also serve as clues for mechanisms and therapeutic effects of well-established herbal drugs. Researchers say in this process safety remains the most important starting point and efficacy becomes a matter of validation. The process also reduces the time and cost of development, argues Patwardhan, who has four Indian drug companies as partners in CSIR's NMITLI program as well as several promising leads. For example, a compound for treating osteoarthritis derived from a fully standardized polyherbal (a combination of two or more plant extracts) is in a phase III trial at five Indian centers. “We are comparing our compound with the largest selling osteoarthritis drugs on the market, Glucozamine and Celecoxib. While it compares positively in bioequivalence, our compound shows an added property of chondro protection,” says Patwardhan, implying that the new drug can prevent degeneration of cartilage by protecting the chondrocyte cells that build cartilage. Promising as the polyherbal osteoarthritis drug may be, it could have a long road to approval in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) traditionally has been reluctant to approve plant extracts or mixtures of different compounds. Currently, CSIR is building a case before the FDA for submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for multiplant extracts. CSIR has a Memorandum of Understanding with the FDA-supported National Center for Natural Products Research (NCNPR) to provide mutual help in validating and promoting products derived from nature. “The NCNPR [and FDA] recognizes the potential of more solutions in Ayurveda for degenerative disorders and hence is keen on multi-plant extract research data that we have generated,” says Ghulam N. Qazi, director of the Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine in Jammu, who is leading the CSIR discussions with the FDA. However, there is evidence that the FDA may be looking more favorably on polyherbals and botanicals. In November of last year, the FDA approved a special extract of green tea as a prescription drug for topical treatment of genital warts caused by human papillomavirus, making it the first prescription herbal (botanical) drug approved in the United States. Although this approved drug is a single plant extract, the FDA has received several INDs on multiplant extracts although none have yet been approved, says Qazi. The CSIR team hopes to file an IND for the polyherbal osteoarthritis drug before the end of the year. Although Indian and Chinese traditional medicine has been used for millennia, their recent convergence with Western medicine is opening up fresh opportunities for developing new therapeutics and for boosting the effects of existing drugs."

Here we show that deletion of the nuclease domain of Exo1 reduces accumulation of DNA damage and DNA damage signal induction in telomere-dysfunctional mice. Exo1 deletion improved organ maintenance and lifespan of telomere-dysfunctional mice but did not increase chromosomal instability or cancer formation. Deletion of Exo1 also ameliorated the induction of DNA damage checkpoints in response to γ-irradiation and conferred cellular resistance to 6-thioguanine-induced DNA damage. Exo1 deletion impaired upstream induction of DNA damage responses by reducing ssDNA formation and the recruitment of Replication Protein A (RPA) and ATR at DNA breaks. Together, these studies provide evidence that EXO1 contributes to DNA damage signal induction in mammalian cells, and deletion of Exo1 can prolong survival in the context of telomere dysfunction.

Telomeres form the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes (Blackburn, 2001Blackburn E.H. Switching and signaling at the telomere.Cell. 2001; 106: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). The main function of telomeres is to cap chromosomal ends, thus preventing induction of DNA damage pathways. Telomere capping function depends on telomere length and telomere structure (de Lange, 2005de Lange T. Shelterin: the protein complex that shapes and safeguards human telomeres.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2100-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2281) Google Scholar). Due to the end replication problem of DNA polymerase and the processing of telomeres during cell cycle progression, telomeres shorten with each round of cell division (Shay and Wright, 2000Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Hayflick, his limit, and cellular ageing.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Telomere shortening limits the proliferative lifespan of primary human cells (Allsopp et al., 1992Allsopp R.C. Vaziri H. Patterson C. Goldstein S. Younglai E.V. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Harley C.B.

In mammalian cells telomere shortening leads to telomere dysfunction inducing senescence or apoptosis (Lechel et al., 2005Lechel A. Satyanarayana A. Ju Z. Plentz R.R. Schaetzlein S. Rudolph C.

Critically short telomeres lose chromosome-capping function.

Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to telomere dysfunction represent a tumor suppressor mechanism (Wright and Shay, 1992Wright W.E. Shay J.W. The two-stage mechanism controlling cellular senescence and immortalization.Exp. Gerontol. 1992; 27: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). As a downside, these checkpoints may contribute to decreased regenerative reserve and impaired organ maintenance in response to telomere dysfunction and aging (Choudhury et al., 2007Choudhury A.R.

The generation of telomerase-deficient mice, which carry a homozygous deletion of the telomerase RNA component (mTerc−/−), has delivered a unique tool to study consequences of telomere dysfunction in vivo.

These studies have shown that activation of the p53 pathway has a major role in mediating the adverse effects of telomere dysfunction on organismal aging, but at the same time, this pathway has a pivotal role in preventing the evolution of chromosomal instability and cancer initiation in response to telomere dysfunction (Chin et al., 1999Chin L.

Telomere dysfunction promotes non-reciprocal translocations and epithelial cancers in mice.Nature. 2000; 406: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Of note, ATM deletion did not rescue premature aging of telomere-dysfunctional mice (Wong et al., 2003Wong K.K. Maser R.S. Bachoo R.M. Menon J. Carrasco D.R. Gu Y. Alt F.W. DePinho R.A. Telomere dysfunction and Atm deficiency compromises organ homeostasis and accelerates ageing.Nature. 2003; 421: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), indicating that ATM-independent pathways can activate p53 in response to telomere dysfunction possibly involving ATR (d'Adda di Fagagna et al., 2003d'Adda di Fagagna F. Reaper P.M. Clay-Farrace L. Fiegler H. Carr P. Von Zglinicki T. Saretzki G. Carter N.P. Jackson S.P. A DNA damage checkpoint response in telomere-initiated senescence.Nature. 2003; 426: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar) —a gene involved in activation of DNA damage signals in response to generation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (Zou et al., 2003Zou L. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Replication protein A-mediated recruitment and activation of Rad17 complexes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 13827-13832Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The induction of chromosomal instability and tumor initiation in response to telomere dysfunction is linked to the evolution of chromosomal instability and the formation of nonreciprocal translocation (Artandi et al., 2000Artandi S.E. Chang S. Lee S.L. Alson S. Gottlieb G.J. Chin L. DePinho R.A. Telomere dysfunction promotes non-reciprocal translocations and epithelial cancers in mice.Nature. 2000; 406: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). This response appears to be initiated by DNA repair pathways that induce chromosomal fusions in response to telomere uncapping, with the consequence of fusion-bridge-breakage cycles (Maser et al., 2007aMaser R.S. Choudhury B. Campbell P.J. Feng B. Wong K.K. Protopopov A. O'Neil J. Gutierrez A. Ivanova E.

Biol. 2002; 12: 1635-1644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Exonuclease-1 (EXO1) is a 5′-3′ exonuclease. A role of EXO1 for the induction of checkpoints in response to telomere dysfunction has been revealed in studies on yeast. Deletion of Exo1 rescued the induction of senescence in telomere-dysfunctional yeast strains (Maringele and Lydall, 2002Maringele L. Lydall D. EXO1-dependent single-stranded DNA at telomeres activates subsets of DNA damage and spindle checkpoint pathways in budding yeast yku70Delta mutants.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1919-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In addition, EXO1 processing of dysfunctional telomeres has been implicated in generating chromosomal translocation in response to telomere dysfunction in yeast (Hackett and Greider, 2003Hackett J.A. Greider C.W. End resection initiates genomic instability in the absence of telomerase.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8450-8461Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). EXO1 can also mediate survival of telomere-dysfunctional yeast strains by increasing homologous recombination at dysfunctional telomeres (Maringele and Lydall, 2004Maringele L. Lydall D. EXO1 plays a role in generating type I and type II survivors in budding yeast.Genetics. 2004; 166: 1641-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Knockout mice carrying a deletion mutation of the nuclease domain of Exo1 are viable, but show defects in DNA mismatch repair, accompanied by slightly increased cancer susceptibility at advanced age (Wei et al., 2003Wei K. Clark A.B. Wong E. Kane M.F. Mazur D.J. Parris T. Kolas N.K. Russell R. Hou Jr., H. Kneitz B. et al.Inactivation of Exonuclease 1 in mice results in DNA mismatch repair defects, increased cancer susceptibility, and male and female sterility.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The role of EXO1 in response to telomere dysfunction and DNA breaks in mammalian cells is unknown. Here we show that Exo1 deletion rescues the accumulation of DNA damage in telomere-dysfunctional mice, as well as DNA damage signal induction in response to γ-irradiation (γ-IR) and at laser-induced DNA breaks. In vivo, Exo1 deletion improved organ maintenance and prolonged lifespan of telomere-dysfunctional mice without accelerating chromosomal instability or cancer formation. Mice carrying a deletion of the nuclease domain of Exo1 (ΔExon 6 = Exo1+/−, Wei et al., 2003Wei K. Clark A.B. Wong E. Kane M.F. Mazur D.J. Parris T. Kolas N.K. Russell R. Hou Jr., H. Kneitz B. et al.Inactivation of Exonuclease 1 in mice results in DNA mismatch repair defects, increased cancer susceptibility, and male and female sterility.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) were crossed for three generations with mTerc−/− mice on a C57BL/6J background. As previously reported the lifespan of G3 mTerc−/− mice (n = 25) was shortened compared with mTerc+/+, Exo1+/+ mice (n = 89, p < 0.0001, Figure 1A). Homozygous Exo1 deletion (Exo1−/−) shortened the lifespan of mTerc+/+ mice (p = 0.009, Figure 1A; Wei et al., 2003Wei K. Clark A.B. Wong E. Kane M.F. Mazur D.J. Parris T. Kolas N.K. Russell R. Hou Jr., H. Kneitz B. et al.Inactivation of Exonuclease 1 in mice results in DNA mismatch repair defects, increased cancer susceptibility, and male and female sterility.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). An increase in spontaneous cancer has been reported in Exo1−/− mice of a mixed genetic background (Wei et al., 2003Wei K. Clark A.B. Wong E. Kane M.F. Mazur D.J. Parris T. Kolas N.K. Russell R. Hou Jr., H. Kneitz B. et al.Inactivation of Exonuclease 1 in mice results in DNA mismatch repair defects, increased cancer susceptibility, and male and female sterility.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In agreement with the relative cancer resistance of the C57BL/6J mouse strain, the overall cancer incidence was low in our mouse cohorts (Figure 1B and Table S1 in the Supplemental Data, available with this article online), and Exo1 deletion did not result in a significant increase in cancer formation, indicating that other factors may contribute to the lifespan reduction in mTerc+/+, Exo1−/− mice. In contrast to the effects on lifespan of mTerc+/+ mice, deletion of Exo1 significantly prolonged survival of G3 mTerc−/−, Exo1−/− mice (n = 34) compared with G3 mTerc−/−, Exo1+/+ mice (p < 0.0001, Figure 1A). This rescue in lifespan was associated with an improvement of overall fitness, as reflected by an increase in body weight of aging G3 mTerc−/−, Exo1−/− mice compared with G3 mTerc−/−, Exo1+/+ mice (p = 0.0002, Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Notably, Exo1 deletion did not accelerate tumor formation in G3 mTerc−/− mice (Figure 1B, p = 0.3). G3 mTerc−/− mice are phenotypically normal at the age of 3 months, but show an atrophy of the intestinal epithelium and impaired hematolymphopoiesis at the age of 12–15 months (Rudolph et al., 1999Rudolph K.L. Chang S. Lee H.W. Blasco M. Gottlieb G.J. Greider C. DePinho R.A. Longevity, stress response, and cancer in aging telomerase-deficient mice.Cell. 1999; 96: 701-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar, Choudhury et al., 2007Choudhury A.R.

Genet. 2007; 39: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The evolution of these phenotypic changes correlates with the progression of telomere dysfunction in aging G3 mTerc−/− mice. A survey of our aging cohorts showed that Exo1 deletion rescued organ maintenance in 12- to 15-month-old G3 mTerc−/− mice (Figures 1C–1F and Figures 2A–2F). In a cohort of 24-month-old G3 mTerc−/−, Exo1−/− mice (n = 4), not in 24-month-old mTerc+/+ mice (Figures 1D and 1F and Figures 2B and 2C), some of the phenotypes of impaired organ maintenance appeared, indicating that Exo1 deletion transiently rescued organ maintenance in G3 mTerc−/− mice, but that EXO1-independent mechanisms limited organ maintenance in very old G3 mTerc−/−, Exo1−/− mice. Deletion of Exo1 did not rescue testis atrophy in G3 mTerc−/− mice because Exo1 deletion itself causes meiotic defects resulting in testis atrophy and sterility in both male and female mTerc+/+ mice (Wei et al., 2003Wei K. Clark A.B. Wong E. Kane M.F. Mazur D.J. Parris T. Kolas N.K. Russell R. Hou Jr., H. Kneitz B. et al.Inactivation of Exonuclease 1 in mice results in DNA mismatch repair defects, increased cancer susceptibility, and male and female sterility.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Impaired maintenance of high-turnover organs in telomere-dysfunctional mice has been linked to increased apoptosis and impaired cell proliferation (Lee et al., 1998Lee H. Blasco M. Gottlieb G. Horner 2nd, J.W. Greider C. DePinho R. Essential role of mouse telomerase in highly proliferative organs.Nature. 1998; 392: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous studies (Choudhury et al., 2007Choudhury A.R. Ju Z. Djojosubroto M.W. Schienke A. Lechel A. Schaetzlein S. Jiang H. Stepczynska A. Wang C. Buer J. et al.Cdkn1a deletion improves stem cell function and lifespan of mice with dysfunctional telomeres without accelerating cancer formation.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), the rate of BrdU incorporation was reduced in basal intestinal crypts of aged G3 mTerc−/− mice compared with that of mTerc+/+ mice (Figures 3A and 3B). Exo1 deletion partially rescued proliferation rates of intestinal basal crypts in G3 mTerc−/−, Exo1−/− mice compared with G3 mTerc−/−, Exo1+/+ mice (n = 5 mice per group, p = 0.0041, Figures 3A and 3B). Elevated rates of apoptosis were present in basal crypts of 12- to 15-month-old G3 mTerc−/− mice compared with age-matched mTerc+/+ mice (Figures 3C and 3D). Deletion of Exo1 reduced apoptosis in 12- to 15-month-old G3 mTerc−/−, Exo1−/− mice compared with G3 mTerc−/−, Exo1+/+ mice (n = 5 mice per group, p = 0.001). An increase in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest appeared in intestinal crypts of 24-month-old G3 mTerc−/−, Exo1−/− mice (Figures 3B and 3D). Studies in yeast have shown that defects in mismatch repair genes can promote telomerase-independent proliferation (Rizki and Lundblad, 2001Rizki A. Lundblad V. Defects in mismatch repair promote telomerase-independent proliferation.Nature. 2001; 411: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, telomerase-independent immortalization of cells involves the activation of an alternative lengthening mechanism of telomeres (ALT), which is based on homologous recombination and characterized by an overall lengthening of telomeres and an increase in telomere length heterogeneity (Bryan et al., 1995Bryan T.M. Englezou A. Gupta J. Bacchetti S. Reddel R.R. Telomere elongation in immortal human cells without detectable telomerase activity.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4240-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar, Chang et al., 2003Chang S. Khoo C.M.

Telomere-based crisis: functional differences between telomerase activation and ALT in tumor progression.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 88-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). An analysis of telomere length in basal intestinal crypts (Figure 4A), splenic white pulp (data not shown), and bone marrow (Figure S1B) of 12- to 15-month-old mice revealed a reduction of the average telomere length and an increase in the frequency of cells with critically short telomeres in G3 mTerc−/− mice compared with mTerc+/+ mice. This reduction in telomere length in G3 mTerc−/− mice was not rescued by Exo1 deletion (Figure 4A and Figure S1B). We also did not see an increase of telomere length heterogeneity in G3 mTerc−/−, Exo1−/−. Together, there is no evidence of systemic activation of ALT that rescued survival and organ maintenance in G3 mTerc−/−, Exo1−/− mice. As a direct marker of telomere dysfunction, telomere-free chromosome ends were present in bone marrow-derived metaphases of G3 mTerc−/− mice but rarely in mTerc+/+ mice (Figures 4B and 4C). Exo1 deletion did not rescue the prevalence of telomere-free ends in G3 mTerc−/− mice (Figures 4B and 4C). Instead there was a further increase in telomere-free ends in G3 mTerc−/−, Exo1−/− mice, likely due to the abrogation of checkpoint responses (Figure 3). Telomere dysfunction induces chromosomal fusion by activation of DNA repair pathways (Maser et al., 2007bMaser R.S. Wong K.K. Sahin E. Xia H. Naylor M. Hedberg H.M. Artandi S.E. DePinho R.A.

We analyzed the rate of anaphase bridges—a morphological correlate of chromosomal fusions (Kirk et al., 1997Kirk K.E. Harmon B.P. Reichardt I.K. Sedat J.W. Blackburn E.H.

There was a significant increase in anaphase bridges in G3 mTerc−/−, Exo1+/+ mice compared with those in age-matched wild-type mice, but Exo1 deletion rescued the formation of anaphase bridges in G3 mTerc−/− mice (Figures 4D and 4E). Spectral karyotyping (SKY) analysis on metaphase spreads from bone marrow cells did not reveal recurrent chromosomal translocations in 12- to 15-month-old G3 mTerc−/−, Exo1+/+ mice (data not shown). Notably, deletion of Exo1 did not result in any detectable increase in chromosomal translocations in bone marrow cells from 24-month-old G3 mTerc−/−, Exo1−/− mice (Figure 4F, n = 4 mice). Together, these results indicated that Exo1 deletion reduced the formation of chromosomal fusions and did not increase chromosomal instability in G3 mTerc−/−, Exo1−/− mice with an extended lifespan. We did not detect a significant effect of Exo1 deletion on telomeric g-strand integrity in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Figures S2A–S2D). The formation of DNA damage foci represents the most upstream molecular event associated with DNA damage signal induction in response to telomere dysfunction (d'Adda di Fagagna et al., 2003d'Adda di Fagagna F.

DNA damage foci containing γH2AX and 53BP1 were detected in basal intestinal crypts of 12- to 15-month-old G3 mTerc−/− mice (Figures 5A–5D), but not in age-matched mTerc+/+ mice (Figures S3A and S3B). Exo1 deletion reduced the accumulation of DNA damage foci in G3 mTerc−/−, Exo1−/− mice (Figures 5A–5D). Costaining of γH2AX with TUNEL-positive, apoptotic cells revealed that DNA damage foci were present in nonapoptotic cells of aging G3 mTerc−/− mice, indicating that the DNA damage foci staining did not reflect DNA breaks in apoptotic cells (Figure S3C). Only 14% of the total number of DNA damage foci (γH2AX or 53BP1) colocalized with telomeres (Figures S3D and S3E). These data indicated that Exo1 deletion impaired the accumulation of DNA damage, likely including extratelomeric DNA damage, in telomere-dysfunctional mice. Activation of DNA damage signaling in response to dysfunctional telomeres and DNA damage involves p53 and its downstream target, p21 (Chin et al., 1999Chin L. Artandi S.E. Shen Q. Tam A. Lee S.L.

https://openalex.org/W2151697358,"Retinoschisin or RS1 is a discoidin domain-containing protein encoded by the gene responsible for X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS), an early onset macular degeneration characterized by a splitting of the retina. Retinoschisin, expressed and secreted from photoreceptors and bipolar cells as a homo-octameric complex, associates with the surface of these cells where it serves to maintain the cellular organization of the retina and the photoreceptor-bipolar synaptic structure. To gain insight into the role of retinoschisin in retinal cell adhesion and the pathogenesis of XLRS, we have investigated membrane components in retinal extracts that interact with retinoschisin. Unlike the discoidin domain-containing blood coagulation proteins Factor V and Factor VIII, retinoschisin did not bind to phospholipids or retinal lipids reconstituted into unilamellar vesicles or immobilized on microtiter plates. Instead, co-immunoprecipitation studies together with mass spectrometric-based proteomics and Western blotting showed that retinoschisin is associated with a complex consisting of Na/K ATPase (α3, β2 isoforms) and the sterile alpha and TIR motif-containing protein SARM1. Double labeling studies for immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed the co-localization of retinoschisin with Na/K ATPase and SARM1 in photoreceptors and bipolar cells of retina tissue. We conclude that retinoschisin binds to Na/K ATPase on photoreceptor and bipolar cells. This interaction may be part of a novel SARM1-mediated cell signaling pathway required for the maintenance of retinal cell organization and photoreceptor-bipolar synaptic structure.

It is primarily expressed in photoreceptors and to a lesser extent bipolar cells of the adult retina (2Takada Y. Fariss R.N. Tanikawa A. Zeng Y. Carper D. Bush R. Sieving P.A. Invest. Ophthalmol.

Retinoschisin consists of a 23-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide and a 157-amino acid discoidin domain flanked by a unique 39-amino acid Rs1 domain and a 5-amino acid C-terminal segment (5Wu W.W.

Eye Res. 2007; 84: 227-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The signal peptide directs the nascent polypeptide across the ER membrane before its removal by a signal peptidase in the lumen of the ER. The processed polypeptide folds into its native conformation and further assembles into a disulfide-linked homo-octameric complex prior to secretion from cells (7Wu W.W. Wong J.P. Kast J. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10721-10730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The secreted, disulfide-linked octamer associates with the external surface of rod and cone photoreceptor cells of the outer retina and bipolar cells of the inner retina (3Molday L.L. Hicks D. Sauer C.G. Weber B.H. Molday R.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 816-825PubMed Google Scholar). The function of retinoschisin is not known at the present time. However, the characteristic features of XLRS patients and retinoschisin knock-out mice suggest that this extracellular protein plays a crucial role in maintaining the cellular organization and synaptic structure of the retina. XLRS is characterized by a splitting of the retinal cell layers, a loss in central vision, and a decrease in the b-wave amplitude of the ERG (8George N.D. Yates J.R. Moore A.T. Br. J.

In vitro studies have shown that most disease-causing missense mutations in the discoidin domain of retinoschisin cause protein misfolding and retention in ER of cells (5Wu W.W. Molday R.S. J. Biol.

Mutations in cysteine residues within the Rs1 domain and the C-terminal segment result in normal protein folding and secretion, but defective disulfide-linked octamer formation (5Wu W.W. Molday R.S.

Molday L.L. Gehrig A. White K.L. Seeliger M.W. Jaissle G.B. Friedburg C. Tamm E. Molday R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6222-6227Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). These include a marked disorganization of the retinal cell layers with gaps between bipolar cells of the inner retina, disruption of the photoreceptor-bipolar synaptic structure of the outer plexiform layer, reduction in the b-wave amplitude of scotopic and photopic ERGs, and progressive degeneration of rod and cone photoreceptor cells. Together, these studies suggest that loss in retinoschisin function compromises the structural integrity of the retina and disrupts normal signal transmission across the photoreceptor-bipolar synapse. The discoidin domain, also known as the F5/8 type C domain, is the main structural unit of retinoschisin (1Sauer C.G. Gehrig A. Warneke-Wittstock R. Marquardt A. Ewing C.C. Gibson A. Lorenz B. Jurklies B. Weber B.H. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Discoidin domains were first discovered in discoidin proteins of the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum (16Poole S. Firtel R.A. Lamar E. Rowekamp W. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 153: 273-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Subsequently, they have been found in a wide variety of extracellular and cell surface membrane proteins that function in cell adhesion, development, and signaling (17Baumgartner S. Hofmann K. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Bucher P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1626-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These include blood coagulation Factors V and VIII, milk fat globule protein, neuropilins, neurexin IV, discoidin domain receptor proteins, and others (17Baumgartner S. Hofmann K.

The high resolution structure of the C2 discoidin domain of Factor V and Factor VIII and the b1 discoidin domain of neuropilin 1 have been determined by x-ray crystallography (19Macedo-Ribeiro S.

In each case it is composed of a core β-barrel structure in which a 5-strand antiparallel β-sheet packs against a 3-strand antiparallel β-sheet. At one end of the β-barrel, the discoidin domain is stabilized through the formation of a disulfide bond between conserved cysteine residues at the start and end of the discoidin domain. At the opposite end loops or spikes protrude from the core β-barrel structure and define a groove or cleft that serves as the ligand binding site (18Fuentes-Prior P. Fujikawa K. Pratt K.P. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2002; 3: 313-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Lee C.C. Kreusch A. McMullan D. Ng K. Spraggon G.

The structures of the C2 domains of Factor V and Factor VIII have been used to generate a structural model for the discoidin domain of retinoschisin (5Wu W.W. Molday R.S. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 544: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Like Factor V and VIII, it has a core β-barrel structure with several loops delimiting a groove. Discoidin domains have been reported to bind a variety of different cellular components. Blood coagulation proteins Factor V and Factor VIII are known to bind to cell surface anionic phospholipids and in particular phosphatidylserine, whereas discoidin domain receptors I and II specifically interact with collagen and neuropilin 1 binds semaphorin 3, VEGF, heparin and heparin-binding proteins (18Fuentes-Prior P.

Discoidin I and II of D. discoideum, on the other hand, have been reported to have a strong affinity for carbohydrates and in particular galactose (16Poole S. Firtel R.A. Lamar E. Rowekamp W. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 153: 273-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although retinoschisin associates with retinal cell surface membranes (3Molday L.L. Hicks D. Sauer C.G. Weber B.H. Molday R.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 816-825PubMed Google Scholar, 24Reid S.N. Yamashita C. Farber D.B. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6030-6040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the identity of the components that anchor retinoschisin to these membranes is not known at the present time. Homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations of the retinoschisin discoidin domain, however, have led to the suggestion that retinoschisin, like blood coagulation Factors V and VIII, may bind to membrane phospholipids (22Fraternali F. Cavallo L. Musco G. FEBS Lett. 2003; 544: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used mass spectrometry based proteomics, biochemical and immunocytochemical methods to identify components in retinal extracts that interact with retinoschisin. Our studies indicate that retinoschisin does not bind to membrane lipids, but instead forms a complex with Na/K ATPase and SARM1. This interaction implicates retinoschisin in a novel signal pathway important in photoreceptor-bipolar synaptic structure and function and retinal cell organization. Materials—1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-choline (DOPC), 1,2,-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (DOPS) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Purified activated Factor Va and an anti-Factor Va monoclonal antibody were obtained from Hematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT). The anti-human SARM1 polyclonal antibody was purchased from Cedarlane Lab (Hornby, ON). Anti-Na/K ATPase α3 isoform (MA3-915) monoclonal antibody was obtained from Abcam Inc (Cambridge, MA) and an anti-Na/K ATPase β2 isoform polyclonal antibody was purchased from Upstate-Millipore (Billerica, MA). The anti-retinoschisin monoclonal antibody RS1 3R10 and polyclonal antibody have been described previously (3Molday L.L. Hicks D. Sauer C.G. Weber B.H. Molday R.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Purification of Retinoschisin—Weri-retino-blastoma cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in RPMI media containing 10% fetal calf serum. After 2 weeks, the media containing the secreted retinoschisin was collected, centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min to remove any cell debris, and precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 1/40 the initial volume of the cell culture media. The solution was dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min to remove residual precipitated protein. For some experiments, retinoschisin was further purified by affinity chromatography on a galactose-agarose column. The partially purified retinoschisin protein solution obtained after ammonium sulfate precipitation was incubated with 0.2 ml of galactose-agarose at 4 °C. After extensive washing in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, the bound retinoschisin was eluted with 1 m isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and subsequently dialyzed extensively against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl to remove the IPTG. For some experiments, retinoschisin was extracted and partially purified from bovine retina as previously described (7Wu W.W. Wong J.P. Kast J. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10721-10730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Preparation of Phospholipid Vesicles—Lipids were extracted from retinal cell membranes using the method of Bligh and Dyer (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar). Briefly, retinal membranes were vortexed in a solution consisting of 1 part chloroform, 2 parts methanol, and 0.8 parts water. Subsequently, a 1:1 mixture of chloroform:water was added and the solution was sonicated in a water bath and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to induce a phase separation. The lower organic phase containing the lipids was recovered and dried to a homogeneous film under nitrogen. Large unilamellar phospholipid vesicles were prepared by the method of Hope et al. (26Hope M. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar). Synthetic phospholipids (3:1 ratio of DOPC to DOPS, 3:1 ratio of DOPC to DOPE or 1:1:1 ratio of DOPC:DOPS:DOPE) were dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of chloroform:methanol and dried to a homogeneous film under a stream of nitrogen gas. The synthetic phospholipids or retinal lipids were extracted with 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 300 mm sucrose and extensively vortexed (27Zeibdawi A.R. Pryzdial E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19929-19936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The resulting multilamellar vesicles were subjected to 5 freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen to promote lipid hydration and equal transmembrane lipid distribution. The multilamellar vesicles were then extruded 10 times through a 100 nm pore polycarbonate membrane (Whatman, Nucleopore, Middlesex, UK) using a lipid extrusion device (Lipex Biomembranes, Vancouver, BC, Canada) to produce large unilamellar vesicles. Finally, the vesicles were dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2. Binding of Factor Va (FVa) and Retinoschisin to Phospholipid Vesicles—The binding of FVa and retinoschisin to lipid vesicles was carried out in HEPES-buffered saline (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 2 mm CaCl2 for 10 min at 25 °C. Vesicles containing a total of 0.6 mg of phospholipids were incubated with 1.2 μg of FVa or retinoschisin in a volume of 50 μl at room temperature for 15 min. The mixture was then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min in a Beckman TL55 rotor. The supernatant containing unbound protein was retained, and the pellet containing the vesicles was washed by centrifugation with HEPES-buffered saline containing 2 mm CaCl2 to remove any loosely bound protein. The pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of HEPES-buffered saline, and both the supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. Binding studies were reproduced at least three times. Binding of FVa and Retinoschisin to Immobilized Phospholipids—The binding of FVa or retinoschisin to phospholipids immobilized onto microtiter plates was carried out by a modification of the method of Ortel et al. (28Ortel T.L. Devore-Carter D. Quinn-Allen M. Kane W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4189-4198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DOPC or DOPS was dissolved in methanol at a concentration of 0.32 μg/ml and 100 μl was added to each well of a 96-well microtiter plate (Corning). The lipids were allowed to air-dry overnight at room temperature. The wells were then blocked with 200 μl of blocking buffer (5 mg/ml gelatin, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl) for 1 h at 37 °C and subsequently washed three times with wash buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 120 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, and 0.05% Tween 20). Binding studies were carried out by adding 50 μl of 0.25 μg FVa or retinoschisin in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2 and 1% bovine serum albumin) to each well. After 2 h at 37 °C, the wells were washed three times with wash buffer and then incubated with 50 μl of either anti-FVa or anti-retinoschisin RS1 3R10 culture fluid diluted 1:1000 or 1:5, respectively, in blocking buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. The wells were washed with wash buffer and subsequently incubated with 50 μl of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to goat anti-mouse Ig (Sigma) at a dilution 1:200 for 1 h at 37 °C. The wells were washed 3 times and incubated with 100 μl of 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (0.5 mg/ml) in PBS containing 0.03% hydrogen peroxide. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured in a microtiter plate reader. All samples were run in triplicate. SDS-PAGE, Western Blot Analysis, and Protein Assays—Samples were denatured in sample mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% sucrose, and 4% β-mercaptoethanol and separated on 9% or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For Western blotting, proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-FL membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a semidry electrophoretic apparatus. The blots were blocked in 1% skim milk in PBS for 30 min and labeled for 1 h with the primary antibody in 0.5% skimmed milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) at the recommended dilution. The blots were washed in PBS-T and labeled for 1 h with a secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Ig antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 680 (1:40,000) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or LI-COR IRDye 800 (1:20,000) (Rockland, PA) for analysis on a LI-COR Odyssey imager (Lincoln, NE). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method (Pierce). Preparation of Retinal Membranes—Two bovine or human retinas were incubated in 2.0 ml of TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1 mm MgCl2 and Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Sciences, Basel, Switzerland) for 25 min on ice. Retina cells were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer and subsequently passed through a 22-gauge needle. The homogenate was loaded on top of 50% sucrose in TBS and centrifuged in an Optima TLS55 rotor (Beckman) for 30 min at 26,000 rpm. The retinal membranes, which banded on top of the 50% sucrose, were collected and washed by centrifugation. For the preparation of mouse retinal membranes, 16 retinas from wild-type C57BL/6 or retinoschisin-deficient mice (15Weber B.H. Schrewe H. Molday L.L. Gehrig A. White K.L. Seeliger M.W. Jaissle G.B. Friedburg C. Tamm E. Molday R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6222-6227Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) were suspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2 containing Complete protease inhibitor. The retinas were homogenized by repeated passage through a 22-gauge needle, and the retinal membranes were isolated by centrifugation on a sucrose cushion as described above. Immunoprecipitation of Retinoschisin from Retinal Membranes—Human and bovine retinal membranes (6 mg) were solubilized in 3.0 ml of 10 mm CHAPS in TBS and mouse retinal membranes (1 mg) were solubilized in 500 μl of 10 mm CHAPS in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 5% glycerol. The solution was stirred at 4 °C for 20 min and subsequently centrifuged in Optima TLA100.4 rotor (Beckman) for 10 min at 50,000 rpm to remove residual unsolubilized material. Typically, 70% of the total retinoschisin, Na/K ATPase and SARM1 proteins were solubilized from bovine retinal membranes under these conditions. The solubilized extract was applied to 50-100 μl of Sepharose beads conjugated with the RS1 3R10 retinoschisin monoclonal antibody (or an irrelevant monoclonal antibody Rim 3F4 as a control) prepared as previously described (5Wu W.W. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28139-28146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation in an Ultrafree filter unit (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The beads were washed six times in TBS containing 10 mm CHAPS by low speed centrifugation to remove unbound protein. Bound protein was eluted directly with 2% SDS in TBS or first with 5 mg/ml of the 3R10 competing peptide (LSSTEDEGEDPWYQKA) in CHAPS buffer followed by a second elution with 2% SDS in TBS. The bound protein was collected by low speed centrifugation. Mass Spectrometry—In-gel digestion of immunoprecipitated proteins was performed by punching out the Coomassie-stained bands from a Nu-Page SDS gradient gel with a Pasteur pipette. The gel pieces were washed with water several times to remove acetic acid and destained in a 1:1 mixture of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 100% acetonitrile several times. After treating with 100% acetonitrile, the gels were dried and subsequently incubated with 10 mm dithiothreitol followed by 50 mm iodoacetamide, washed with ammonium bicarbonate, and dried from 100% acetonitrile. The gel pieces containing the samples were incubated with porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at 12 ng/μl in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 5 mm CaCl2 for 30 min on ice. The protease solution was removed, and the gel pieces were overlaid with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 5 mm CaCl2. The samples were digested for 18 h at 37 °C. The solution was collected in a separate tube, and the gel pieces were re-extracted with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate/66% acetonitrile (basic extraction) and with 5% formic acid/66% acetonitrile (acidic extraction). The samples were pooled, dried in a Speedvac, and resuspended in 10 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. For MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, protease-digested samples (2 μl) were applied to H4 chips (Ciphergen, Fremont, CA). The sample was dried and washed with two quick rinses of water before applying 20% α-cyanohydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) matrix in a solvent with 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Samples were analyzed on a Ciphergen mass spectrometer. Masses obtained were average masses and mined against a mammalian data base using Profound server. A Qstar XL LC/MS/MS (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used for MS/MS analysis of peptides. Trypsinized samples obtained as above were lyophilized and reconstituted in formic acid. A PepMap C18 column with a 3-mm particle size and 100-Å pore size column from LC Packings (Amsterdam, Netherlands) was used for peptide separation. Solvents B and A contained 20% acetonitrile in water and 5% acetonitrile in water, respectively. LC conditions started at 2% solvent B, with a gradient to 60% B over 60 min, to 95% B at 93 min, and held for 3 min before returning to 2% B. Masses obtained were monoisotopic masses. Mass spectra were searched against the mammalian data base using Mascot Server v2.1. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Eyes from 2-month-old C57BL/6 mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 5% sucrose for 2 h. The eyes were then washed 3 times with 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, (PB) containing 5% sucrose. Eyecups were frozen in Tissue-Tek OCT and 12 μm cryosections were cut. The sections were blocked and permeabilized in 10% goat serum and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PB for 20 min and subsequently labeled overnight at room temperature with the primary polyclonal retinoschisin antibody and monoclonal antibody to Na/K ATPase diluted in PB containing 2.5% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 (1:5000 anti-retinoschisin; 1:200 anti-Na/K ATPase (α3-subunit)). The sections were washed with PB buffer and labeled for 1 h with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa-488 or Alexa-594 diluted 1:1000 in PB containing 2.5% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100. Samples were visualized under a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope equipped with an Eclipse image analyzer. Binding of Retinoshisin and FVa to Immobilized Phospholipids—The C2 discoidin domain of blood coagulation Factor V is known to bind anionic phospholipids and in particular phosphatidylserine (19Macedo-Ribeiro S. Bode W. Huber R. Quinn-Allen M.A. Kim S.W. Ortel T.L. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Stubbs M.T. Kane W.H. Fuentes-Prior P.

This interaction enables the prothrombinase complex to assemble on the surface of platelets as a key reaction in the blood coagulation cascade. Retinoschisin associates with retinal membranes and in particular the extracellular surfaces of photoreceptor and bipolar cells (3Molday L.L. Hicks D. Sauer C.G. Weber B.H. Molday R.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 816-825PubMed Google Scholar, 24Reid S.N. Yamashita C. Farber D.B. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6030-6040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations of the retinoschisin discoidin domain has led to the suggestion that retinoschisin like Factor V may bind to the phospholipid bilayer through the interaction of conserved hydrophobic residues within the spike region of the discoidin domain (2"

Using neural progenitor cells derived from the subventricular zone of the adult mouse, we investigated the effect of CEPO on neurogenesis and the associated signaling pathways in vitro. We found that CEPO significantly increased neural progenitor cell proliferation and promoted neural progenitor cell differentiation into neurons, which was associated with up-regulation of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), its receptor ptc, and mammalian achaete-scute homolog 1 (Mash1), a pro-neuron basic helix-loop-helix protein transcription factor. Blockage of the Shh signaling pathway with a pharmacological inhibitor, cyclopamine, abolished the CEPO-induced neurogenesis. Attenuation of endogenous Mash1 expression by short-interfering RNA blocked CEPO-promoted neuronal differentiation. In addition, recombinant mouse Shh up-regulated Mash1 expression in neural progenitor cells. These results demonstrate that the Shh signaling pathway mediates CEPO-enhanced neurogenesis and Mash1 is a downstream target of the Shh signaling pathway that regulates CEPO-enhanced neuronal differentiation.

However, EPO also elevates hematocrit levels, which could lead to adverse effects on stroke recovery (6Wang L. Kim Z. Wang Y. Zhang R. Chopp M.

The effect of CEPO on neurogenesis has not been investigated. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a member of the family of the hedgehog proteins known to exert important regulatory functions in patterning and growth in a large number of tissues during embryogenesis (11Ruiz i Altaba A. Kim P. Dahmane N. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 12Goetz J.A. Kim L.M. Zeng X. Robbins D.J.

Development. 1995; 121: 3163-3174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the mammalian brain, Shh plays an important role for the regulation of progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation (14Zhu G. Kim M.F. Zhao J. Yu Yung S. Kessler J.A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 215: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15Fu M. Kim V.C. Sham M.H. Pachnis V. Tam P.K. J.

Shh binds to the transmembrane receptor protein patched (ptc), which, in the absence of Shh, exerts an inhibitory effect on the seven-transmembrane receptor smoothened (Smo) (18Gutierrez-Frias C.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2504) Google Scholar). Binding of Shh to ptc blocks the inhibitory effect of ptc on Smo. Once activated, Smo induces a complex series of intracellular reactions that target the Gli family of transcription factors (11Ruiz i Altaba A. Kim P. Dahmane N. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Gli1 is the principal effector of Shh signaling in neural progenitor cells (20Ahn S. Kim A.L. Nature. 2005; 437: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). In the present study, using neural progenitor cells derived from the SVZ of adult mice, we tested the hypothesis that CEPO via Shh signaling promotes proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells. All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Henry Ford Hospital. Male mice (C57BL6/J, 6-8 weeks) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). EPOR null mice (ΔEPOR mice, C57BL6 background) were provided by Dr. Constance Tom Noguchi at NIDDK, National Institutes of Health (44Chen Z.Y. Kim P. Prchal J.T. Noguchi C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25875-25883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Neurosphere Culture—SVZ neural progenitor cells were dissociated from normal (n = 10) and ΔEPOR mice (n = 10) as previously reported (21Chiasson B.J. Kim V. Morshead C.M. van der Kooy D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4462-4471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Morshead C.M. Kim B.A. Craig C.G. McBurney M.W. Staines W.A. Morassutti D. Weiss S. van der Kooy D. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1071-1082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). The cells were plated at a density of 2 × 104 cells/ml in growth medium. Growth medium contains Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s-F-12 medium (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml of epidermal growth factor (EGF) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and 20 ng/ml of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (R&D Systems). Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s-F-12 medium contains l-glutamine (2 mm), glucose (0.6%), putrescine (9.6 μg/ml), insulin (0.025 mg/ml), progesterone (6.3 ng/ml), apo-transferrin (0.1 mg/ml), and sodium selenite (5.2 ng/ml). The generated neurospheres (primary sphere) were passaged by mechanical dissociation and reseeded as single cells at a density of 20 cells/μl in bFGF- and EGF-containing media (passage 1 cells). Passage 1 cells were processed for various experiments in the present study. These cells were cultured in reduced growth medium containing 10 ng/ml of EGF and 10 ng/ml of bFGF. To analyze the formation of secondary neurospheres, passage 1 neurospheres were collected and digested with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) for 5 min at 37 °C. They were then gently triturated with a fire-narrowed Pasteur pipette, spun down at 400 rpm for 3 min, resuspended in the reduced growth medium, and plated at 1 × 104 cells/ml in each well of a 24-well plate (Corning). The number of neurospheres was counted at 7 days in vitro. To analyze cell proliferation, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) (20 μg/ml), the thymidine analog that is incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells during S-phase was added into the reduced growth medium 18 h prior to termination of incubation. BrdUrd-positive cells were measured. To dynamically measure dividing neural progenitor cells, time-lapse microscopy was employed (23Zhang R.L. Kim Y. Gregg S.R. Wang Y. Toh Y. Robin A.M. Zhang Z.G. Chopp M. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 3157-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Cultured neurospheres were incubated in a stage top chamber with 5% CO2 and 37 °C (LiveCell Control Unit), which was placed on the stage of a Nikon TE2000-U inverted microscope equipped with a motorized Z stage. A ×10 objective with ×1.5 electronic zoom was used for acquiring images. A stack of images (30 images with a 5-μm step in z-axes) were acquired at 15-min intervals for a total of 20 h using a CCD camera (CoolSnap, 5000) and MetaView software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA) (23Zhang R.L. Kim Y. Gregg S.R. Wang Y. Toh Y. Robin A.M. Zhang Z.G. Chopp M. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 3157-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To analyze phenotypes of neural progenitor cells, neurospheres were mechanically dissociated as single cells. These cells (2.5 × 104 cells/cm2) were plated directly onto laminin-coated glass coverslips in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s-F-12 medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum but without the growth factors for 7 days. This medium was referred to as the differentiation medium. Immunocytochemistry was performed with various antibodies (see below) to determine phenotypes of neural progenitor cells. Experimental Protocol—1) To examine whether Shh/Gli signaling pathway is involved in the effects of CEPO on neurogenesis, neural progenitor cells were incubated in the presence of CEPO (0, 1, 10, 100 ng/ml) (H. Lundbeck A/S, Denmark) with or without cyclopamine (a specific inhibitor of Smo, 5 μm; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). Neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation and activation of the Shh/Gli pathway were measured. In addition, neural progenitor cells were transfected with mouse Gli1 siRNA and incubated with CEPO (10 ng/ml). 2) To examine the effects of CEPO on Mash1 expression, neural progenitor cells were incubated in the presence of CEPO (10 ng/ml). Mash1 mRNA and protein levels were measured. 3) To examine the role of Mash1 on CEPO-enhanced neuronal differentiation, neural progenitor cells were transfected with mouse Mash1 siRNA cassettes and incubated with CEPO (10 ng/ml). Neuronal differentiation and Mash1 levels were measured. 4) To examine the direct effect of Shh on neural progenitor cell proliferation, differentiation, and Mash1 expression, neural progenitor cells were incubated in the presence of recombinant mouse Shh (Shh-N terminus, 0, 10, 100, 1000 ng/ml; R&D Systems) with or without cyclopamine (5 μm). Mouse siRNA Synthesis and Transfection—Mouse Mash1 siRNA cassettes were designed according to the Mouse Mash1 sequence in GenBank™ (NM_008553) using siRNA target finder (GenScript Corp., Piscataway, NJ). The selected sequences were chemically synthesized, and the cassettes were constructed by PCR, which consists of a 505-bp human H1 promoter and terminator sequence flanking a DNA insert encoding a small hairpin RNA (GenScript Corp). A BLAST search against the mouse genome was performed for the specificity of all target sequences and the scrambled sequences. All cassettes were labeled at the 5′-end with Cy3 for control of transfection efficiency (Fig. 7). Mouse Gli1 siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. Neural progenitor cells were transfected using the Mouse NSC Nucleofector™ kit (Amax Inc.) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The total amount of siRNA per transfection was kept constant to 0.5 μg/ml. mRNA and protein levels were measured 48 and 72 h after transfection. Real-time RT-PCR—Quantitative PCR was performed using the SYBR Green real-time PCR method (24Wang L. Kim Z. Zhang R. Hafner M.S. Wong H.K. Jiao Z. Chopp M. Neuroreport. 2004; 15: 1225-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from neural progenitor cell cultures using the Stratagene Absolutely RNA MicroRNA isolation kit (La Jolla, CA). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on an ABI 7000 PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using three-stage program parameters provided by the manufacturer, as follows; 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, and then 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. Specificity of the produced amplification product was confirmed by examination of dissociation reaction plots. A distinct single peak indicated that a single DNA sequence was amplified during PCR. PCR products were run on 2% agarose gels to confirm that correct molecular sizes were present. Each sample was tested in triplicate, and samples obtained from three independent experiments were used for analysis of relative gene expression using the 2-ΔΔCT method (25Livak K.J. Kim T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127160) Google Scholar). The following primers for real-time PCR were designed using Primer Express software (ABI): Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (FWD, AGA ACA TCA TCC CTG CAT CC; REV, CAC ATT GGG GGT AGG AAC AC); Shh (FWD, CCT TTA CCC TAC AAG CAG TTT ATT GC; REW, GTA ATT GGG GGT GAG TTC CTT AAA TC); ptch1 (FWD, TAG CGC CTT CTT CTT TTG GA; REV, GTG GAA GTT GGT GGA CGA GT); Gli1 (FWD, TCC ACA CGC CCC CTA GTG; REV, TGG CAA CAT TTT CGG TGA TG); Mash1 (FWD, TCT CCT GGG AAT GGA CTT TG; REW, GGT TGG CTG TCT GGT TTG TT). Immunocytochemistry and Quantification—Single and double immunofluorescent stainings of cultured cells were performed as previously described (2Zhang R.L. Kim Z.G. Zhang L. Chopp M. Neuroscience. 2001; 105: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 26Zhang R. Kim L. Zhang L. Chen J. Zhu Z. Zhang Z. Chopp M. Circ.

The following primary antibodies were used in the present study: mouse anti-BrdUrd (1:100; Roche Applied Science), mouse anti-β-tubulin III (TuJ-1, 1:500; Covance), mouse anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) (1:200; Chemicon), mouse anti-NeuN (1:100; Chemicon), rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (1:500; Dako Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA), rabbit anti-Gli1 (1:300; Abcam Inc. Cambridge, MA), rabbit anti-nestin (1:100; BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-SOX2 (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and mouse anti-Mash1 monoclonal (1:250; BD Biosciences). Cultured cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15-20 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 60 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with the primary antibodies listed above and with CY3-conjugated or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies. Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The number of BrdUrd-, TuJ1-, MAP2-, NeuN-, and GFAP-positive cells and total DAPI cell number were counted, and the percentage of each cell type was determined. Western Blot Analysis—Western blots were performed according to published methods (27Wang L. Kim Z.G. Zhang R.L. Jiao Z.X. Wang Y. Pourabdollah-Nejad D.S. LeTourneau Y. Gregg S.R. Chopp M. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2006; 26: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates from neural progenitor cells were sonicated for 10 s and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min. Protein concentration in the supernatants of cell extract was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.). Equal amounts of proteins were loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the blots were subsequently probed with the following antibodies: Shh (N-19) (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), patched (G-19) (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Gli1 (1:5000; Abcam Inc.), and Mash1 (1:250; BD Biosciences). For detection, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used (1:2000) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence development (Pierce). Normalization of results was ensured by running parallel Western blots with β-actin antibody. The optical density was quantified using an image processing and analysis program (Scion Image, Ederick, MA). Measurements of Neurite Outgrowth—To analyze neurite outgrowth, TuJ1-positive cells were digitized using a ×20 objective (Zeiss) via the MCID computer imaging analysis system (Imaging Research, St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada). Neurite outgrowth was quantified using a software program developed in our laboratory that includes measurements of the number, length, and diameter of branches (27Wang L. Kim Z.G. Zhang R.L. Jiao Z.X. Wang Y. Pourabdollah-Nejad D.S. LeTourneau Y. Gregg S.R. Chopp M. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2006; 26: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Fifty TuJ1-positive cells per group were measured, and all measurements were performed by experimenters blinded to each culture condition. Statistical Analysis—One-way analysis of variance followed by Student-Newman-Keuls test was performed. The data were presented as means ± S.E. A value of p < 0.05 was taken as significant. CEPO Induces Proliferation and Differentiation of Neural Progenitor Cells—To examine the effect of CEPO on adult neural progenitor cells, we employed a neurosphere assay that has been widely used for investigating the biology of neural progenitor cells (24Wang L. Kim Z. Zhang R. Hafner M.S. Wong H.K. Jiao Z. Chopp M. Neuroreport. 2004; 15: 1225-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28Reynolds B.A. Kim S.

When neural progenitor cells harvested from the SVZ of the adult mouse were plated at a density of 20 cells/μl on the non-adhesive culture surface in the reduced growth medium (10 ng/ml of bFGF and 10 ng/ml of EGF), these cells formed spheres 7 days in vitro. The vast majority of cells in neurospheres were nestin-immunoreactive (98.8 ± 0.3%, Fig. 1A) and Sox2-immunoreactive (74.6 ± 0.34%, Fig. 1B), markers of neural progenitor cells. Double immunostaining revealed that 69 ± 0.02% of cells in neurospheres were BrdUrd-positive, an index of proliferating cells, and nestin-positive, suggesting that most of the cells are proliferating. When single cells dissociated from neurospheres were reseeded on laminin-coated glass coverslips (2.5 × 104 cells/ml) in medium without the growth factors for 7 days, these cells differentiated into TuJ1-positive (Fig. 1C), a marker of immature neurons, GFAP-positive, a marker of astrocytes (Fig. 1D), and O4-positive cells, a marker of oligodendrocytes (Fig. 1E). However, NeuN-positive cells, a marker of mature neurons, were not detected until 14 days in culture, which is consistent with published studies (32Tanaka R. Kim K. Mochizuki H. Cho N. Onodera M. Mizuno Y. Urabe T. Stroke. 2004; 35: 1454-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These data indicate that SVZ cells have the capacity of selfrenewal and undergo multilineage differentiation, characteristics of neural progenitor cells (33Alvarez-Buylla A. Kim D.G. Wichterle H. Prog. Brain Res. 2000; 127: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We then determined whether CEPO promotes neural progenitor cell proliferation. Single SVZ cells were cultured in the reduced growth medium containing CEPO (0, 1, 10, 100 ng/ml). Exposure of single SVZ cells to CEPO (10 and 100 ng/ml) resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the number and size of primary neurospheres (Fig. 2, B, G, and H) compared with that in the control group (Fig. 2, A, G, and H). We further measured the number of the secondary neurospheres in which the CEPO-treated neurospheres were dissociated and reseeded at 1 × 104 cells/ml in the reduced growth medium. Compared with the control group, the number of the secondary neurospheres derived from the CEPO-treated (10 ng/ml) group was significantly (p < 0.05) increased (459 ± 14%, n = 8 versus 349 ± 18%, n = 8, in control). Furthermore, treatment with CEPO significantly (p < 0.05) increased the number of BrdUrd-positive cells (Fig. 2, E and I) and the number of BrdUrd- and nestin-positive cells (Fig. 2, J and K), suggesting that increases of number and size of neurospheres result from an increase of progenitor cells but are not induced by an increase of cell aggregation. In parallel, time-lapse microscopic analysis revealed that 15 cells that migrated out of the neurosphere were dividing in the CEPO (10 ng/ml) group during a 20-h experimental period, whereas only 4 dividing cells were detected in the control group at the same time period. Collectively, these results demonstrate that CEPO augments neural progenitor cell proliferation. We next determined the effect of CEPO on neural progenitor cell differentiation. Single cells dissociated from neurospheres were reseeded on laminin-coated glass coverslips (2.5 × 104 cells/ml) and treated with CEPO (0, 1, 10, 100 ng/ml) for 7 days in differentiation medium without the growth factors. Treatment with CEPO (10 and 100 ng/ml) significantly increased the number of TuJ1-positive (Fig. 3, B and C) and MAP2-positive (3.8 ± 0.01%, n = 8 in CEPO 10 ng/ml versus 1.7 ± 0.04%, n = 8, in control) cells and decreased the number of GFAP-positive cells, although it did not reach statistical significance compared with the number in the untreated group (Fig. 3, A and C). The increase of TuJ1-positive cells could reflect a decrease of cell death. To address the possibility that CEPO may act as a survival factor for neural progenitor cells, we measured the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells and found that the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the CEPO group (12 ± 1.2%, n = 4) was not significantly different from the number in the control group (11 ± 1.1%, n = 4). These data suggest that CEPO selectively enhances neural progenitor cell differentiation into neurons. To examine whether CEPO enhances neurite outgrowth, neurite outgrowth was quantified by measuring the length and number of branches extending from TuJ1-positive cell soma. In the control group, TuJ1-positive cells exhibited a few short branches (Fig. 4E). However, TuJ1-positive cells exhibited complex branching patterns when neural progenitor cells were incubated with CEPO (Fig. 4F). Quantitative analysis revealed that treatment with CEPO significantly (p < 0.05) increased the number and length of branches (Fig. 4, J and K), suggesting that CEPO promotes neurite outgrowth. We then measured the effect of CEPO on SVZ cells harvested from ΔEPOR mice. Treatment with EPO (10 units/ml) significantly (p < 0.05) increased the number of TuJ1-positive cells in neural progenitor cells derived from wild-type mice (4 ± 0.32%, n = 8 versus 2 ± 0.2%, n = 8, in control) but did not increase the number of TuJ1-positive cells in ΔEPOR neural progenitor cells (3 ± 0.5%, n = 8 versus 3 ± 0.3%, n = 8 in control), which is consistent with our previous studies (6Wang L. Kim Z. Wang Y. Zhang R. Chopp M. Stroke. 2004; 35: 1732-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 27Wang L. Kim Z.G. Zhang R.L. Jiao Z.X. Wang Y. Pourabdollah-Nejad D.S. LeTourneau Y. Gregg S.R. Chopp M. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2006; 26: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, treatment of ΔEPOR neural progenitor cells with CEPO (10 ng/ml) significantly (p < 0.05) increased the number of TuJ1-positive cells (5 ± 0.5%, n = 8) compared with the number in the control group (3 ± 0.3%, n = 8). These results suggest that EPOR is not required for CEPO-enhanced neurogenesis. The Shh/Gli1 Signaling Pathway Regulates the Effect of CEPO on Neural Progenitor Cell Proliferation and Differentiation—The Shh/Gli1 signaling pathway is required for regulating neurogenesis in the adult rodent brain (20Ahn S. Kim A.L. Nature. 2005; 437: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 34Palma V. Kim D.A. Dahmane N. Sanchez P. Brionne T.C. Herzberg C.D. Gitton Y. Carleton A. Alvarez-Buylla A. Ruiz i Altaba A. Development. 2005; 132: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). To determine whether CEPO induces Shh/Gli1 signaling activation, we examined expression of Shh, its receptors, and Gli1. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis revealed that neural progenitor cells expressed Shh, ptc, and Gli1 and treatment with CEPO significantly up-regulated these genes (Fig. 5, A and B). However, in the absence of EGF or bFGF, CEPO failed to augment mRNA levels of Shh (1.09 ± 0.07 versus 1.0 ± 0.09 in control), ptc (0.9 ± 0.03 versus 1.0 ± 0.08 in control), and Gli1 (0.9 ± 0.12 versus 1.0 ± 0.16 in control), suggesting that CEPO activates the Shh pathway in cooperation with EGF and bFGF. Moreover, CEPO in the presence of 20 ng/ml EGF and 20 ng/ml bFGF did not significantly increase the number of neurospheres (442 ± 18, n = 8) compared with the number in control group (379 ± 16.9, n = 8). These data are consistent with findings that EGF at lower concentration has a synergistic effect with Shh in the control of proliferation of SVZ neural progenitor cells (16Lai K. Kim B.K. Gage F.H. Schaffer D.V. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). To test whether Shh signaling is necessary for CEPO to promote proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells, we treated neural progenitor cells with CEPO in the presence of the Shh antagonist cyclopamine. Application of cyclopamine (5 μm) abolished the ability of CEPO to induce ptc and Gli1 expression but did not suppress CEPO-induced Shh expression (Fig. 5, A and B). In addition, cyclopamine significantly reduced the numbers of CEPO-increased BrdUrd-positive (Fig. 2, F and I) and TuJ 1-positive (Fig. 4, D and I) cells compared with the numbers in the control group. Furthermore, cyclopamine blocked CEPO-induced neurite outgrowth (Fig. 4, H, J, and K). These data indicate that the Shh/Gli1 pathway regulates CEPO-enhanced neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. To directly examine the effect of Shh on neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, we measured the number of BrdUrd- and TuJ1-positive cells after treatment with Shh-N. At a concentration of 5 ng/ml EGF, Shh has a synergistic effect on neural progenitor cells (16Lai K. Kim B.K. Gage F.H. Schaffer D.V. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Therefore, SVZ neural progenitor cells were cultured in the growth medium containing EGF (5 ng/ml) with or without Shh-N (100 ng/nl) for 7 days. Shh-N treatment led to a significant (p < 0.05) increase of BrdUrd-positive cells from 61 ± 2% in the control group to 73 ± 2%. In addition, Shh-N treatment substantially increased the number of TuJ1-positive cells in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal increases at a dose of 1,000 ng/ml (11 ± 0.3%, n = 8 for 100 ng/ml and 16 ± 0.7%, n = 8 for 1,000 ng/ml versus 2 ± 0.2%, n = 8 in control) when neural progenitor cells were cultured in the differentiation medium. These data indicate that Shh induces neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, which is consistent with published results (35Machold R. Kim S. Rutlin M. Muzumdar M.D. Nery S.

https://openalex.org/W2094925514,"Mammals generate external coloration via dedicated pigment-producing cells but arrange pigment into patterns through mechanisms largely unknown. Here, using mice as models, we show that patterns ultimately emanate from dedicated pigment-receiving cells. These pigment recipients are epithelial cells that recruit melanocytes to their position in the skin and induce the transfer of melanin. We identify Foxn1 (a transcription factor) as an activator of this “pigment recipient phenotype” and Fgf2 (a growth factor and Foxn1 target) as a signal released by recipients. When Foxn1—and thus dedicated recipients—are redistributed in the skin, new patterns of pigmentation develop, suggesting a mechanism for the evolution of coloration. We conclude that recipients provide a cutaneous template or blueprint that instructs melanocytes where to place pigment. As Foxn1 and Fgf2 also modulate epithelial growth and differentiation, the Foxn1 pathway should serve as a nexus coordinating cell division, differentiation, and pigmentation."
https://openalex.org/W1964252744,"How yeast cells respond to cell wall stress is relatively well understood; however, how filamentous fungi cope with cell wall damage is largely unexplored. Here we report the first transcriptome analysis of <i>Aspergillus niger</i> exposed to the antifungal compounds caspofungin, an inhibitor of β-1,3-glucan synthesis, and fenpropimorph, which inhibits ergosterol synthesis. The presence of sublethal drug concentrations allowed <i>A. niger</i> to adapt to the stress conditions and to continue growth by the establishment of new polarity axes and formation of new germ tubes. By comparing the expression profile between caspofungin-exposed and nonexposed <i>A. niger</i> germlings, we identified a total of 172 responsive genes out of 14,509 open reading frames present on the Affymetrix microarray chips. Among 165 up-regulated genes, mainly genes predicted to function in (i) cell wall assembly and remodeling, (ii) cytoskeletal organization, (iii) signaling, and (iv) oxidative stress response were affected. Fenpropimorph modulated expression of 43 genes, of which 41 showed enhanced expression. Here, genes predicted to function in (i) membrane reconstruction, (ii) lipid signaling, (iii) cell wall remodeling, and (iv) oxidative stress response were identified. Northern analyses of selected genes were used to confirm the microarray analyses. The results further show that expression of the <i>agsA</i> gene encoding an α-1,3-glucan synthase is up-regulated by both compounds. Using two P<i>agsA</i>-GFP reporter strains of <i>A. niger</i> and subjecting them to 16 different antifungal compounds, including caspofungin and fenpropimorph, we could show that <i>agsA</i> is specifically activated by compounds interfering directly or indirectly with cell wall biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2035334282,"Thrombin and factor Xa, two important pro-coagulant proteinases, can be regulated through direct and indirect inhibition mechanisms. Recently, we designed sulfated dehydropolymers (DHPs) of 4-hydroxycinnamic acids that displayed interesting anticoagulant properties (Monien, B. H., Henry, B. L., Raghuraman, A., Hindle, M., and Desai, U. R. (2006) Bioorg. Med. Chem. 14, 7988–7998). To better understand their mechanism of action, we studied the direct inhibition of thrombin, factor Xa, factor IXa, and factor VIIa by CDSO3, FDSO3, and SDSO3, three analogs of sulfated DHPs. All three sulfated DHPs displayed a 2–3-fold preference for direct inhibition of thrombin over factor Xa, whereas this preference for inhibiting thrombin over factor IXa and factor VIIa increased to 17–300-fold, suggesting a high level of selectivity. Competitive binding studies with a thrombin-specific chromogenic substrate, a fluorescein-labeled hirudin peptide, bovine heparin, enoxaparin, and a heparin octasaccharide suggest that CDSO3 preferentially binds in or near anion-binding exosite II of thrombin. Studies of the hydrolysis of H-d-hexahydrotyrosol-Ala-Arg-p-nitroanilide indicate that CDSO3 inhibits thrombin through allosteric disruption of the catalytic apparatus, specifically through the catalytic step. Overall, designed sulfated DHPs appear to be the first molecules that bind primarily in the region defined by exosite II and allosterically induce thrombin inhibition. The molecules are radically different in structure from all the current clinically used anticoagulants and thus represent a novel class of potent dual thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors. Thrombin and factor Xa, two important pro-coagulant proteinases, can be regulated through direct and indirect inhibition mechanisms. Recently, we designed sulfated dehydropolymers (DHPs) of 4-hydroxycinnamic acids that displayed interesting anticoagulant properties (Monien, B. H., Henry, B.

The molecules are radically different in structure from all the current clinically used anticoagulants and thus represent a novel class of potent dual thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors. The coagulation cascade is composed of two intertwined pathways, called the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathways, that operate in a highly complex, but tightly regulated, manner to bring about controlled formation of the fibrin polymer. Several enzymes participate in this process, including factor IXa and factor VIIa, which belong to the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, respectively, and thrombin and factor Xa, which belong to the common pathway (1Butenas S. Kim K.G. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2002; 67: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 2Jenny N.S. Kim K.G. Loscalzo, J. Schafer A.I. Thrombosis and Hemorrhage. 3rd Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2003: 1-21Google Scholar). The cascade is regulated by several proteins present naturally in the plasma, of which antithrombin is a major regulator (3Björk I. Kim S.T. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 425: 17-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 4Olson S.T. Kim I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Antithrombin, a member of the serpin (serine proteinase inhibitor) family of proteins, primarily inhibits thrombin, factor Xa, and factor IXa and also possibly inhibits several other enzymes to a lesser extent. Yet antithrombin is a rather poor inhibitor of these pro-coagulant enzymes and requires the presence of heparin to exhibit its anticoagulant potential (3Björk I. Kim S.T. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 425: 17-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 4Olson S.T. Kim I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Heparin is a highly sulfated polysaccharide that greatly enhances the rate of antithrombin inhibition of thrombin, factor Xa, and factor IXa under physiological conditions (5Olson S.T. Kim R. Raub-Segall E. Bedsted T. Sadri M. Petitou M. Herault J.P. Herbert J.M. Bjork I. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2004; 92: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This acceleration is the primary reason for the continued use of heparin as an effective anticoagulant for the past 8 decades. Yet heparin suffers from several limitations, including enhanced risk for bleeding, variable patient response, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and the inability to inhibit clot-bound thrombin (6Menajovsky L.B. Am. J. Med. 2005; 118: 21-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 7van Dongen C.J. Kim A.G. Prins M.H. Lensing A.W.

Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), 2The abbreviations used are: LMWH, low molecular weight heparin; CDSO3, sulfated dehydropolymer of caffeic acid; DHP, dehydrogenation polymer; DTI, direct thrombin inhibitor; FDSO3, sulfated dehydropolymer of ferulic acid; [5F]-Hir-(54–65)(SO3–), Tyr-63-sulfated hirudin-(54–65) labeled with fluorescein; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; H8, heparin octasaccharide; PABA, p-aminobenzamidine; PEG, polyethylene glycol; SDSO3, sulfated dehydropolymer of sinapic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. derivatives of heparin with reduced polymeric length, and fondaparinux, a specific sequence of five saccharide residues (Fig. 1A), have been introduced in the past decade as better mimics of full-length heparin. These new anticoagulants still possess risk for bleeding and are unable to inhibit clot-bound thrombin (8Bauersachs R.M. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 35: 27-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Turpie A.G. Expert Opin. Drug. Saf. 2005; 4: 707-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A major reason for the limitations of heparin therapy is its high negative charge density. Heparin (and LMWH) is a linear co-polymer of glucosamine and uronic acid residues that are decorated with a large number of sulfate groups generating a complex, heterogeneous polyanionic macromolecule (Fig. 1A) (10Rabenstein D.L. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 312-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). This highly polyanionic polymer is capable of interacting with a large number of plasma proteins and cells, which likely induce many of the adverse effects of heparin (11Capila I. Kim R.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2002; 41: 391-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar). Apart from the indirectly acting heparins, several direct inhibitors have been put forward, including argatroban and ximelagatran for thrombin and DX9065a and razaxaban for factor Xa (12Weitz J.I. Kim H.R. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 13Nutescu E.A. Kim N.L. Chevalier A. Clin. Geriatr. Med. 2006; 22: 33-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Structurally, most direct inhibitors of thrombin (DTIs) and factor Xa contain a guanidine or an amidine group that mimics the critical arginine residue at the P-1 3Nomenclature follows the convention introduced by Schechter and Berger (40Schechter I. Kim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4765) Google Scholar) in which the substrate residues are denoted P with the amino acid residues of the N-terminal side of the scissile bond numbered P3, P2, P1; those of the C-terminal side are numbered P1′, P2′, P3′; and P1-P1′ residues form the scissile bond. site of the proteinase recognition sequence (14Kikelj D. Pathophysiol. Haemost. Thromb. 2003; 33: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Gerotziafas G.T. Kim M.M. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2005; 11: 3855-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). DTIs and direct factor Xa inhibitors form major classes of clotting regulators that are considered to be superior to heparins primarily because of the expectation that they are likely to inhibit both circulating and clot-bound enzymes. Yet challenges exist in the development of these inhibitors, including establishing enzyme-binding affinity that is not associated with excessive bleeding and avoiding liver toxicity (13Nutescu E.A. Kim N.L. Chevalier A. Clin. Geriatr. Med. 2006; 22: 33-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, the direct and indirect anticoagulants utilize different pathways of inhibition. Although heparins require antithrombin to mediate their effect, DTIs and direct factor Xa inhibitors either bind in the active site or to an exosite on the enzyme to inhibit its proteolytic function (14Kikelj D. Pathophysiol. Haemost. Thromb. 2003; 33: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Gerotziafas G.T. Kim M.M. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2005; 11: 3855-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). With a goal of developing inhibitors of factor Xa and thrombin that are less polyanionic and more hydrophobic than the heparins, we designed sulfated dehydropolymers (DHPs) (Fig. 1B). Three sulfated DHPs, CDSO3, FDSO3, and SDSO3, were prepared in a simple two-step chemo-enzymatic process involving horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oligomerization of 4-hydroxycinnamic acid monomers followed by the chemical sulfation of the resulting DHPs with triethylamine-sulfur trioxide complex (16Monien B.H. Kim B.L. Raghuraman A. Hindle M. Desai U.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006; 14: 7988-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies suggested that the chemo-enzymatic sulfated DHPs were potent anticoagulants in vitro. The sulfated DHPs prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time at concentrations equivalent to LMWH. Interestingly, although being designed as heparin mimics, CDSO3, FDSO3 and SDSO3 were found to inhibit factor Xa and thrombin in an antithrombin-independent (direct) manner suggesting a potentially novel mode of inhibition (16Monien B.H. Kim B.L. Raghuraman A. Hindle M. Desai U.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006; 14: 7988-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that CDSO3, FDSO3, and SDSO3 possess high selectivity for inhibiting thrombin and factor Xa over other enzymes of the coagulation cascade; CDSO3 inhibits thrombin through allosteric disruption of its catalytic apparatus and preferentially binds the enzyme in or near the region formed by anion-binding exosite II. Sulfated DHPs appear to be the first molecules that induce inhibition of pro-coagulant proteinases, thrombin and factor Xa, through exosite II. Our work suggests that sulfated DHPs are structurally, functionally, and mechanistically a very interesting class of molecules that may lead to novel anticoagulants. Proteins and Chemicals—Sulfated dehydropolymers CDSO3, FDSO3, and SDSO3 (Fig. 1B) were prepared in two steps from 4-hydroxycinnamic acid monomers, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and sinapic acid using chemo-enzymatic synthesis described by Monien et al. (16Monien B.H. Kim B.L. Raghuraman A. Hindle M. Desai U.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006; 14: 7988-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Human plasma proteinases, factor VIIa, factor IXa, factor Xa, and α-thrombin, were purchased from Hematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT) and used as such. Stock solutions of proteins were prepared in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl and 2.5 mm CaCl2 (antithrombin and thrombin) or 5 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0 (factor Xa). Factor VIIa stock solutions of proteins were prepared in 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl and 5 mm CaCl2, whereas factor IXa stock solutions were prepared in 5 mm MES buffer, pH 5.5, containing 150 mm NaCl. Chromogenic substrates Spectrozyme TH (H-d-hexahydrotyrosol-Ala-Arg-p-nitroanilide), Spectrozyme FXa (methoxycarbonyl-d-cyclohexylglycyl-Gyl-Arg-p-nitroanilide), Spectrozyme FIXa (d-Leu-Phe-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide), and Spectrozyme FVIIa (methanesulfonyl-d-cyclohexylalanyl-butyl-Arg-p-nitroanilide) were purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). A low molecular weight heparin (Mr 5,060) used in plasma assays was purchased from Sigma, and enoxaparin (Mr 4,500, from Aventis Pharmaceuticals) and fondaparinux (Mr 1,727, from GlaxoSmithKline) were pharmaceutical grade. Heparin octasaccharide H8 was from Dextra Laboratories (Reading, UK). Thrombin substrate p-nitrophenyl-p′-guanidinobenzoate and active site fluorophore p-aminobenzamidine (PABA) were purchased from Sigma and used as such. Tyr-63-sulfated hirudin-(54–65) labeled with 5-(carboxy)fluorescein ([5F]-Hir-(54–65)(SO–)) was prepared as described earlier (26Bock P.E. Kim S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19837-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were analytical reagent grade from either Sigma or Fisher and used without further purification. Physicochemical Properties of CDSO3, FDSO3, and SDSO3—The weight average molecular weight of the unsulfated parent dehydropolymers CD, FD, and SD were determined by Monien et al. (16Monien B.H. Kim B.L. Raghuraman A. Hindle M. Desai U.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006; 14: 7988-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using nonaqueous size-exclusion chromatography (Table 1). The molecular weight values suggest that an average of 12.7, 15.5, and 14.4 monomer units are present in CD, FD, and SD, respectively. Sulfate composition of the sulfated DHPs was determined by elemental analysis and found to be 0.40, 0.30, and 0.38 sulfate groups per monomer unit (16Monien B.H. Kim B.L. Raghuraman A. Hindle M. Desai U.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006; 14: 7988-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This implies that an average of 5.1, 4.7, and 5.5 sulfate groups per average DHP chain are present in CDSO3, FDSO3, and SDSO3, respectively. Thus, the molecular weight value of the sulfated DHPs was calculated to be 3320, 4120, and 3550 for CDSO3, FDSO3, and SDSO3, respectively (Table 1).TABLE 1Physical properties of DHPs from cinnamic acid derivativesRange of oligomer chain lengthaData were from Ref. 16.Weight average oligomer sizebSize was obtained by dividing the average molecular weight by the molecular weight of acetylated monomers, caffeic acid (Mr 221), ferulic acid (Mr 235), and sinapic acid (Mr 208).Sulfate groups per monomercAverage number of sulfates per monomeric unit was obtained from elemental sulfur composition (16).Calculated MrdAverage molecular weight of sulfated DHPs was calculated by adding the molecular weight of the average number of sulfate groups to the average molecular weight of unsulfated DHP.

For these assays, 10 μl of DHP at concentrations ranging from 0.035 to 10,000 μg/ml was diluted with 930 μl of the appropriate buffer in PEG 20,000-coated polystyrene cuvettes. The buffers used in these experiments include 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 for thrombin and factor Xa; 100 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8, containing 100 mm NaCl and 10 mm CaCl2 for factor IXa (18Bedsted T.

Following the preparation of the sulfated DHP solution, 10 μl of the proteinase solution was added to give 1–10 nm initial enzyme concentration, and the cuvette was incubated for 10 min. Thrombin, factor Xa, and factor VIIa assays were incubated at 25 °C, whereas factor IXa assays were incubated at 20 °C. Following incubation, 50 μl of 2 mm chromogenic substrate, Spectrozyme TH, FXa, FVIIa, or Spectrozyme FIXa, was rapidly added, and the residual enzyme activity was determined from the initial rate of increase in absorbance at 405 nm. Relative residual proteinase activity at each concentration was calculated using the activity measured under otherwise identical conditions, except for the absence of the sulfated DHP. Logistic Equation 1 was used to fit the dose-dependence of residual proteinase activity to obtain IC50. Y=YO+YM−YO1+10(log[DHP]O−log IC50)HS (Eq. 1) In Equation 1 Y is the ratio of residual proteinase activity in the presence of inhibitor to its absence (fractional residual activity), YM and YO are the maximum and minimum possible values of the fractional residual proteinase activity; IC50 is the concentration of the inhibitor that results in 50% inhibition of enzyme activity, and HS is the Hill slope. HS does not represent cooperativity because sulfated DHPs are highly complex species that may possess multiple binding modes and geometries. Sigmaplot 8.0 (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, IL) was used to perform nonlinear curve fitting in which YM, YO, IC50, and HS were allowed to float.

Open table in a new tab Michaelis-Menten Kinetics of Spectrozyme TH Hydrolysis by Thrombin in the Presence of CDSO3—The initial rate of Spectrozyme TH hydrolysis by 1 nm thrombin was monitored from the linear increase in absorbance at 405 nm corresponding to less than 20% consumption of the substrate. The initial rate was measured as a function of various concentrations of the substrate (0.6–20 μm) in the presence of a fixed concentration of CDSO3 (10–300 nm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% PEG8000 at 25 °C. The data were fitted by the Michaelis-Menten equation to determine Km,app and Vmax. To calculate kcat from Vmax, active site titration of thrombin with p-nitrophenyl-p′-guanidinobenzoate was performed, according to the reported procedure (19Chase T. Kim Shaw E. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2212-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), and the change in extinction co-efficient of 9920 m–1cm–1 (20Sonder S.A. Kim J.W. II Clin.

Michaelis-Menten Kinetics of Spectrozyme TH Hydrolysis by Thrombin in the Presence of [5F]-Hir-(54–65)(SO3–)—The initial rate of Spectrozyme TH hydrolysis by 1 nm thrombin was monitored from the linear increase in absorbance at 405 nm corresponding to less than 20% consumption of the substrate. The initial rate was measured as a function of various concentrations of the substrate (0.6–20 μm) in the presence of fixed concentration of [5F]-Hir-(54–65)(SO–) (8.6–103.2 nm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% PEG8000 at 25 °C. The data were analyzed as described above. Competitive Binding Studies with [5F]-Hir-(54–65)(SO 3–), an Exosite I Ligand—CDSO3-dependent thrombin inhibition studies in the presence of [5F]-Hir-(54–65)(SO3–) were performed in a manner similar to that described above for direct thrombin inhibition using the chromogenic substrate hydrolysis assay. A 950-μl solution containing CDSO3, [5F]-Hir-(54–65)(SO3–), and thrombin, each at their required concentrations, in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% PEG 8000 was incubated at 25 °C in PEG 20,000-coated polystyrene cuvettes for 10 min. Following incubation, 50 μl of 2 mm Spectrozyme TH was added, and the initial change in absorbance at 405 was measured. A 4 nm concentration of thrombin was found to give sufficient signal at various concentrations of the fluorescent peptide for reproducible results. The dose dependence of the fractional residual proteinase activity at each concentration of the competitor was fitted by Equation 1 to obtain the apparent concentration of CDSO3 required to reduce thrombin activity to 50% of its initial value (IC50,app). Competitive Binding Studies with Anion-binding Exosite II Ligands—Exosite II competition experiments were performed in a manner similar to that described above, except for the presence exosite II competitors. Briefly, residual thrombin activity was measured in a spectrophotometric assay following 10 min of incubation of CDSO3, exosite II competitor, and thrombin, each at the required concentration, in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, as described above. Exosite II competitor ligands included bovine heparin, enoxaparin and H8. The molecular weights of bovine heparin and enoxaparin were assumed to be 15,000 and 4500, respectively, as reported in the literature (22Desai U.R. Garg H.G. Linhardt R.J. Hales C.A.

The dose dependence of the fractional residual proteinase activity at each concentration of the competitor was fitted by Equation 1 to obtain IC50,app. The affinities of bovine heparin, enoxaparin, and H8 for thrombin under the conditions utilized for inhibition experiments were measured spectrofluorometrically using p-aminobenzamidine (PABA), as reporter of interaction following published procedures (25Olson S.T. Kim H.R. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6342-6352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of exosite II GAG ligands with thrombin-PABA complex resulted in a saturable quenching in fluorescence at 370 nm (∼16%, λex = 345 nm), which can be fitted by the quadratic binding equation to derive the KD value for the interaction. Structure of Sulfated Dehydropolymers (DHPs)—The sulfated DHP molecules studied in this work were prepared chemo-enzymatically in two steps from 4-hydroxycinnamic acid monomers, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and sinapic (Fig. 1B). Horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidative coupling followed by sulfation of the available hydroxyl and phenolic groups gives the corresponding sulfated DHPs, CDSO3, FDSO3, and SDSO3, in reproducibly good yields (16Monien B.H. Kim B.L. Raghuraman A. Hindle M. Desai U.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006; 14: 7988-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Overall, these sulfated DHPs are a mixture of many oligomeric species that range in size from 4 to 15 monomer units and contain several intermonomer linkages, including β-O-4, β-5, β-β, and 5-5. Of these, β-O-4 and β-5 linkages form the major proportion (Fig. 1B), except for SDSO3 (see below). Although heparins and sulfated DHPs belong to structurally distinct class of molecules, with respect to the properties of polydispersity and microheterogeneity, they have much in common. Each preparation of both these types of molecules contains numerous sequences possessing different chain lengths and fine structure. Yet the level of sulfation in the sulfated DHPs is significantly lower than that found in heparins. Although the three sulfated DHPs studied here have an average of 1 sulfate group for every 2–3 monomer residues, heparins possess an average of 2–2.5 sulfate groups for every disaccharide (Table 1). More importantly, the backbone of sulfated DHPs is composed of a number of aromatic rings, a feature completely absent in heparin. Thus, the sulfated DHPs are significantly more hydrophobic than heparins, whereas heparins have significantly more anionic character. Finally, although unfractionated heparin with a Mr of ∼15,000 is considerably larger, sulfated DHPs (Mr ∼ 2500–4000) are comparable with enoxaparin (Mr 4,500) and fondaparinux (Mr ∼ 1,700) (Table 1). Although all three sulfated DHPs possess several types of inter-monomer linkages, structural constraints in the sinapic acid monomer do not allow the formation of 5-5 and β-5 intermonomer linkages in the oligomer (16Monien B.H. Kim B.L. Raghuraman A. Hindle M. Desai U.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006; 14: 7988-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, the predominant inter-monomeric linkage in SDSO3 is β-O-4 with some proportion of β-β. This implies that the SDSO3 dehydropolymer is structurally more homogeneous, or less diverse, than CDSO3 and FDSO3. Sulfated DHPs Inhibit Factor Xa and Thrombin in the Absence of Antithrombin—Our initial results on inhibition of thrombin and factor Xa in the presence and absence of antithrombin suggested the possibility of a dual inhibition mechanism (16Monien B.H. Kim B.L. Raghuraman A. Hindle M. Desai U.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006; 14: 7988-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The discovery of a direct inhibition mechanism was unexpected and hence interesting. To better define this initi"

Critical for the regulation of PKD1 activity in response to oxidative stress are Src- and Abl-mediated tyrosine phosphorylations that eventually lead to protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ)-mediated activation of PKD1. Here we identify Tyr95 in PKD1 as a previously undescribed phosphorylation site that is regulated by oxidative stress. Our data suggest that PKD1 phosphorylation at Tyr95 generates a binding motif for PKCδ, and that oxidative stress-mediated PKCδ/PKD interaction results in PKD1 activation loop phosphorylation and activation. We further analyzed all PKD isoforms for this mechanism and show that PKD enzymes PKD1 and PKD2 are targets for PKCδ in response to oxidative stress, and that PKD3 is not a target because it lacks the relevant tyrosine residue that generates a PKCδ interaction motif.

Importantly, PKD1 in response to activation by ROS leads to the induction of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), a transcription factor that regulates SOD2 expression and cellular detoxification as well as cell survival (10Storz P.

This signaling pathway could be of importance for processes regulating cell survival under oxidative stress conditions such as mechanisms that regulate aging or cancer. PKD2 also activates NF-κB in response to other stimuli such as BCR-Abl expression in myeloid leukemia cells and NF-κB, activated by this PKD isoform mediates interleukin 8 production in epithelial cells (25Chiu T.T.

An initial step in ROS-mediated PKD1 activation are tyrosine phosphorylations mediated by the kinases Src and Abl (10Storz P. Kim A.

It has been shown that Src-mediated phosphorylations in the PH domain lead to further activating phosphorylations, suggesting a conformational change as a first step in the PKD1 activation cascade (20Storz P.

PKD1 gains full activity after phosphorylation at two serine residues in the activation loop in the kinase domain, which is mediated by novel PKC (nPKC) isoforms. Four nPKC isoforms (PKCθ, PKCε, PKCη, and PKCδ) are known within cells and all have been described to directly phosphorylate the PKD1 activation loop serines (17Waldron R.T. Kim E. J. Biol.

For example, it has been shown that PKCε and PKCη activate PKD1 in response to growth factor signaling or at the Golgi (13Van Lint J. Kim Y. Valius M. Merlevede W. Vandenheede J.R. J. Biol.

It was suggested that a nPKC/PKD activation complex is necessary to facilitate activation loop phosphorylation and full activation of PKD. The nPKC isoform PKCη, for example, associates with the PH domain of PKD1 in response to growth factor signaling (33Waldron R.T. Kim T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9224-9230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, the sites of interaction of PKD with other novel PKC isoforms have not been mapped so far and it is particularly unclear how PKCδ interacts with PKD1 in response to ROS. Recently, the C2 domain of protein kinase Cδ was described as a novel phosphotyrosine binding domain (34Benes C.H. Kim N. Elia A.E. Dharia T. Cantley L.C. Soltoff S.P. Cell. 2005; 121: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In response to overexpression of Src this domain facilitates the interaction of PKCδ with the Src-binding glycoprotein CDCP1. The C2 domain interacts with a minimal phosphotyrosine consensus motif that was described as (V/I)-pY-(Q/R)-X-(Y/F)-X, whereby the tyrosine residue is phosphorylated by Src (34Benes C.H. Kim N. Elia A.E. Dharia T. Cantley L.C. Soltoff S.P. Cell. 2005; 121: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Although additional proteins containing this motif such as MUC-1, Abl, and PLD2 all have been shown to associate with PKCδ, the experimental proof for interaction of these proteins with the C2 domain of PKCδ through this phosphotyrosine motif is still lacking (34Benes C.H. Kim N. Elia A.E. Dharia T. Cantley L.C. Soltoff S.P. Cell. 2005; 121: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We here demonstrate that PKCδ interacts with PKD1, whereas a PKCδ lacking the C2 domain does not bind PKD1. This data suggests that the mechanism of how PKCδ binds to and activates PKD1 in response to oxidative stress is via its C2 domain. We describe a novel phosphotyrosine residue within a C2-binding motif in PKD1 that is phosphorylated by Src and regulates the interaction of PKD1 with PKCδ. We further show that this interaction is prerequisite for oxidative stress-mediated regulation of the PKD isoforms PKD1 and PKD2, but not for PKD3.

Immunofluorescence—Cells were transfected (5 μg of DNA) and 24 h after transfection plated on glass coverslips at a density of 50,000 cells/well in a 24-well plate. The next day cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde (15 min, 37 °C). Following permeabilization (0.1% Triton X-100, 10 min) cells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 200 in phosphate-buffered saline (blocking solution) for 30 min at room temperature. The coverslips were then incubated with primary antibody diluted in blocking solution anti-HA (rat), 1:2,000, overnight at 4 °C. Cells were then washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with secondary antibody diluted 1:500 in blocking solution (donkey anti-rat IgG Alexa Fluor 488) for 2 h at room temperature. After extensive washes in phosphate-buffered saline coverslips were mounted in Fluormount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) and examined. The NH2 Terminus of PKD1 Contains a PKCδ Binding Motif—PKD1 has important roles in the protective response to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide, where it promotes cellular survival and detoxification (37Storz P. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 13-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). H2O2 has been shown to lead to Src and PKCδ activation, which both in turn can phosphorylate PKD1 (19Storz P. Kim H. Toker A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8520-8530Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In this activation mechanism Src causes priming phosphorylations that facilitate PKCδ-mediated phosphorylations, which lead to a fully active PKD enzyme (20Storz P. Kim H. Toker A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2614-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 27Storz P. Kim H. Toker A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 870-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of how PKCδ interacts with and activates PKD1 in response to oxidative stress are not known. First, we determined which nPKC isoforms besides PKCδ are capable to bind PKD1 in response to oxidative stress. We found that only the δ isoform binds to PKD1 after treatment of cells with H2O2 (Fig. 1A). Then, to map the region of interaction of both enzymes we analyzed the interaction of endogenous PKCδ with PKD1 deletion mutants after stimulation of cells with hydrogen peroxide. Therefore we expressed wild-type PKD1 or mutants deleted in the acidic region (ΔAR), the pleckstrin homology domain (ΔPH), the kinase domain (ΔKIN), and the NH2 terminus (Δ1–321) (Fig. 1, B and C). We found that in response to oxidative stress, PKCδ interacts within a region containing the first 321 amino acids of PKD1 (Fig. 1C). This NH2-terminal region of PKD1 contains the lipid-binding C1a and C1b domains as well as a putative transmembrane region and a 14-3-3 binding motif (38Hausser A. Kim P. Link G. Stoll H. Liu Y.C.

Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within the NH2 terminus we also found a sequence containing two tyrosine residues (Phe94-Tyr95-Gly96-Met97-Tyr98-Asp99), similar to the recently described minimal consensus motif (V/I)-pY-(Q/R)-X-(Y/F)-X that facilitates interaction of proteins with the PKCδ C2 domain (Fig. 2A) (34Benes C.H. Kim N. Elia A.E. Dharia T. Cantley L.C. Soltoff S.P. Cell. 2005; 121: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We mutated both tyrosines in this motif to phenylalanine (PKD1-Y95F; PKD1-Y98F) or to glutamine (PKD1-Y95Q; PKD1-Y98Q) and analyzed the interaction of these PKD1 mutants with PKCδ in response to oxidative stress (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, PKD1 mutants with tyrosine to phenylalanine or glutamine mutations at residue 95 lost their ability to interact with PKCδ suggesting that a tyrosine at this position is required. On the other hand a PKD1 mutant with tyrosine at residue Tyr98 mutated to phenylalanine was still capable of interacting with PKCδ in response to oxidative stress. However, a tyrosine 98 to glutamine PKD1 mutant (PKD1-Y98Q) lost its ability to interact with PKCδ, suggesting, that position 98 allows tyrosine or phenylalanine, which concurs with the requirements of the consensus motif for PKCδ binding (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Importance of PKD1 tyrosine residue 95 for the interaction with PKCδ. A, comparison of the consensus motif that allows binding of the C2 domain of PKCδ to phosphotyrosine residues and a similar motif of amino acids 94 to 99 (FYGLYD) identified in PKD1, with Tyr95 as a potential phosphorylation site. B, HA-tagged wild-type PKD1 or PKD1 mutants (PKD1-Y95F, PKD1-Y95Q, PKD1-Y98F, and PKD1-Y98Q) were overexpressed in HeLa cells and cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide (10 min, 10 mm). PKD1 was immunoprecipitated (anti-HA) and samples were analyzed for co-immunoprecipitation of PKCδ by immunoblotting with anti-PKCδ. The nitrocellulose was then stripped and re-probed for PKD expression (anti-PKD). All results are typical of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Oxidative Stress-mediated Phosphorylation of PKD1 at Tyrosine Residue 95—Tyr95 mediates binding of PKD1 to PKCδ in response to oxidative stress. Furthermore, the Tyr95-Gly-Met/Leu-Tyr/Phe sequence in PKD1 shows similarity to the minimal consensus sequence ((V/I)-pY-(Q/R)-IX-(Y/F)-X) for PKCδ-binding proteins. We next analyzed if PKD1 is phosphorylated at tyrosine residue 95 in this potential PKCδ C2 domain binding motif. To analyze phosphorylation of this site in response to oxidative stress, we generated a phosphospecific antibody that specifically recognizes PKD phosphorylated at tyrosine residue 95 (anti-pY95). To demonstrate phosphorylation of tyrosine 95 in response to oxidative stress we transfected wild-type PKD1, PKD1-Y95F, and PKD1-Y98F mutants and analyzed the phosphorylation of Tyr95 after induction of oxidative stress. As expected, a PKD1-Y95F mutant was not phosphorylated in response to oxidative stress, whereas wild-type PKD1 and a PKD1-Y98F mutant were tyrosine phosphorylated and were recognized by the antibody (Fig. 3A). This experiment also indicates specificity of the pY95 antibody for the phosphorylated Tyr95 residue. Because a mutational analysis always bears the possibility that point mutants are mislocalized within cells, we analyzed cellular localization of the wild-type PKD1 and the Y95F mutant and found no significant differences in cellular localization either before or after hydrogen peroxide treatment (Fig. 3B). We also used the anti-pY95 antibody to analyze oxidative stress-treated cells for tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous PKD1 and PKD2 at this residue and found that both are phosphorylated at this tyrosine residue in response to oxidative stress (Fig. 3C). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr95 did not occur in response to treatment of cells with phorbol ester, which mimic diacylglycerol formation and thus activate PKC isoforms and PKD in some signaling pathways (supplemental Fig. 1). Because we have shown in previous studies that tyrosine kinases Src and Abl are upstream of PKD1 in response to oxidative stress signaling and that both can directly phosphorylate certain tyrosine residues in PKD1, we next analyzed if the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKD1 at Tyr95 is mediated by one of these kinases. We expressed constitutive-active Abl or Src and analyzed if this leads to PKD1 phosphorylation at residue Tyr95 and found that Src, but not Abl mediates Tyr95 phosphorylation of overexpressed and endogenous PKD1 (Fig. 4, A and B). This is in accordance with Benes et al. (34Benes C.H. Kim N. Elia A.E. Dharia T. Cantley L.C. Soltoff S.P. Cell. 2005; 121: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), who identified Src as the kinase that leads to the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue of the PKCδ binding motif of other targets that interacts with the C2 domain of PKCδ. Moreover, the inhibition of Src with PP2 led to an inhibition of oxidative stress-mediated phosphorylation of PKD1 at Tyr95, further indicating the importance of Src in this activation mechanism (Fig. 4C). Finally, to determine whether Src is the major regulator of PKD1 pY95 phosphorylation, we compared cells transfected with wildtype (WT-Src) and dominant-negative Src (DN-Src) and determined PKD1 Tyr95 phosphorylation in response to oxidative stress. Dominant-negative Src completely blocked PKD1 phosphorylation, indicating that Src (but not other Src-like kinases) is the mediator of PKD1 phosphorylation at pY95 (Fig. 4D). A more detailed analysis of how Src contributes to the phosphorylation of this site will be the subject of future studies. PKCδ Interaction with PKD Isoforms Occurs via a pY-Gly-Met/Leu-Tyr Motif—We next analyzed the amino acid sequences of all three PKD isoforms, PKD1/PKCμ, PKD2, and PKD3/PKCν for the potential PKCδ interactio"

This enzyme consists of two components, an oxygenase (HpaB) and a reductase (HpaC). To understand the structural basis of the catalytic mechanism of HpaB, crystal structures of HpaB from Thermus thermophilus HB8 were determined in three states: a ligand-free form, a binary complex with FAD, and a ternary complex with FAD and 4HPA. Structural analysis revealed that the binding and dissociation of flavin are accompanied by conformational changes of the loop between β5 and β6 and of the loop between β8 and β9, leading to preformation of part of the substrate-binding site (Ser-197 and Thr-198). The latter loop further changes its conformation upon binding of 4HPA and obstructs the active site from the bulk solvent. Arg-100 is located adjacent to the putative oxygen-binding site and may be involved in the formation and stabilization of the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate.

Structural analysis revealed that the binding and dissociation of flavin are accompanied by conformational changes of the loop between β5 and β6 and of the loop between β8 and β9, leading to preformation of part of the substrate-binding site (Ser-197 and Thr-198). The latter loop further changes its conformation upon binding of 4HPA and obstructs the active site from the bulk solvent. Arg-100 is located adjacent to the putative oxygen-binding site and may be involved in the formation and stabilization of the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate. The 4-hydroxyphenylacetate (4HPA) 2The abbreviations used are: 4HPA, 4-hydroxyphenylacetate; HpaB, the oxygenase component of 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-monooxygenase; HpaC, the reductase component of 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-monooxygenase; DHPA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate; TC-FDM, two-component flavin-diffusible monooxygenase; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviations; C2, oxygenase component of p-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase from A. baumannii. 3-monooxygenase catalyzes hydroxylation of 4HPA to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate (DHPA). This enzyme is involved in the initial step of the degradation pathway of 4HPA. It uses molecular oxygen and reduced flavin for hydroxylation and NAD(P)H for flavin reduction. Thus, the enzymatic reaction is separated into two steps, the reduction of flavin to generate two reducing equivalents using NAD(P)H as an electron donor and the hydroxylation of substrates using molecular oxygen and reduced flavin. This enzyme has been isolated from Escherichia coli (1Cooper R.A. Skinner M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 302-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Prieto M.A. García J.L. J. Biol.

The small component of these enzymes is the flavin reductase, which generates reduced flavin for the oxygenase component to oxygenate substrates.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) have classified these enzymes into the two-component flavin-diffusible monooxygenase (TC-FDM) family (10Galán B. Díaz Prieto A García.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The TC-FDM family includes monooxygenases targeting various substrates such as 4HPA, chlorophenol (11Takizawa N. Yokoyama H. Yanagihara K. Hatta T. Kiyohara H. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1995; 80: 318-326Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar), styrene (12Velasco A. Alonso S. García J.L. Perera J. Díaz E. J.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6937-6943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and aliphatic sulfonate (17der Ploeg J.R. Cummings N.J. Leisinger T. Connerton I.F. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2555-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences of reductase components are relatively similar to each other, whereas those of oxygenase components differ, which may reflect substrate specificity for either aromatic or non-aromatic compounds (14Kadiyala V. Spain J.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2479-2484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that members of the TC-FDM family that act on aromatic compounds can be further divided into two groups. One group includes an enzyme from A. baumannii (and probably one from P. putida), and the other includes the remaining members (the E. coli enzyme is representative of this group). The reductase component (C1) from A. baumannii is larger than E. coli-type reductases of the TC-FDM family and is stimulated by the presence of the substrate (18Sucharitakul J. Chaiyen P. Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10434-10442Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In contrast, E. coli-type reductases are not affected by the presence of their substrate. The oxygenase component (C2) from A. baumannii shows low identity with E. coli-type oxygenases (9Thotsaporn K. Sucharitakul J. Wongratana J. Suadee C. Chaiyen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1680: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, C2 reacts with FADH2, FMNH2, and riboflavin during the hydroxylation reaction (19Sucharitakul J. Chaiyen P. Entsch B. Ballou D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17044-17053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), whereas E. coli-type oxygenases selectively utilize either FADH2 or FMNH2 (20Xun L. Sandvik E.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).

Structure. 1998; 6: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) has been reported. The catalytic mechanisms of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase have been investigated thoroughly by many structural and kinetic studies (Refs. 21Entsch B. van Berkel W.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 22Entsch B. Cole L.J. Ballou D.P. Arch. Biochem.

Commun. 2005; 338: 590-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar and references therein). This enzymatic reaction can be divided into reduction and oxidation. In the reductive reaction the enzyme changes its structure from an open conformation to a closed (or the in) form upon binding of substrate. Subsequently, NADPH binds to the enzyme, and the isoalloxazine ring of FAD swings toward the protein surface (the out conformation), allowing electron transfer from NADPH to FAD. In the oxidative reaction reduced FAD moves back to the in conformation and reacts with an oxygen molecule to generate the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate, which immediately reacts with the substrate. This closed (in) conformation excludes solvent from the active site, preventing the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate from degradation by a water molecule. Oxygenase components belonging to the TC-FDM family also form the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate (26Gisi M.R. Xun L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2786-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Valton J. Fontecave M. Douki T. Kendrew S.G. Nivière V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, there are remarkable differences between single- and two-component systems. In a two-component system, reduced flavin is supplied from a reductase component to an oxygenase component. The first step in the reaction of an oxygenase component is the binding of reduced flavin. Reduced flavin bound to the oxygenase component reacts with molecular oxygen to form the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate, which is stabilized until a substrate comes into the active site of the enzyme (26Gisi M.R. Xun L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2786-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Valton J. Fontecave M. Douki T. Kendrew S.G. Nivière V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, there must be a mechanism by which the unstable C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate is stabilized. In contrast, in the single-component systems an aromatic compound must be bound to the enzyme before reaction with an oxygen molecule and may immediately reacts with the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin formed upon binding of oxygen. The amino acid sequences of the HpaB (54.3 kDa) and HpaC (16.1 kDa) proteins from Thermus thermophilus HB8 have identities of 30 and 29%, respectively, with the corresponding proteins from E. coli. The unique feature of these enzymes is that they can bind and release flavin. We reported previously the crystal structure of HpaC, showing that no conformational changes occur upon FAD binding (28Kim S.H. Hisano T. Iwasaki W. Ebihara A. Miki K. Proteins. 2007; (in press)Google Scholar). The affinity of HpaC for FAD can be attributed to the interaction between the AMP moiety of FAD and the non-conserved loop region (Gly-83-Gly-94) of HpaC. In this research, to understand the structural basis for the catalytic mechanism, we determined the crystal structures of HpaB from T. thermophilus HB8 in three states; that is, a ligand-free form, a FAD complex, and a FAD-substrate complex. This is the first structural determination for the E. coli-type oxygenase components in the TC-FDM family. Purification and Crystallization—The purification, crystallization, and initial phase determination of HpaB has been described elsewhere (29Kim S.H. Miyatake H. Hisano T. Iwasaki W. Ebihara A. Miki K. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Comm. 2007; 63: 556-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The structure of HpaB was determined using the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction method with a platinum derivative (29Kim S.H. Miyatake H. Hisano T. Iwasaki W. Ebihara A. Miki K. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Comm. 2007; 63: 556-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). As the model was being built, three residues were found to be mutated due to a PCR error (T198I, A276G, and R466H). The expression plasmid was reconstructed, and purification of wild-type HpaB was performed in the same manner as was used to purify the mutated protein. Crystals of wild-type HpaB were prepared by mixing 4 μl of a solution containing 5 mg/ml protein and 1 mm dithiothreitol with an equal volume of a reservoir solution containing 1.5 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), and 25% (v/v) glycerol. Crystals appeared within a few minutes and reached a final dimension of 0.25 × 0.4 × 0.2 mm after 1-3 days. Crystals of the HpaB·FAD complex were obtained by soaking crystals of the ligand-free form into a reservoir solution containing 5 mm FAD for 30 min. For crystals of the HpaB·FAD·4HPA complex, crystals obtained in the presence of 5 mm 4HPA were soaked in 5 mm FAD for 210 min. Data Collection and Structural Determination—Diffraction data for wild-type HpaB, the HpaB·FAD complex, and the HpaB·FAD·4HPA complex were collected under cryogenic conditions using a Quantum 210 CCD detector (ADSC) at beamline BL44B2 at SPring-8, Harima, Japan (30Adachi S.

Open table in a new tab Quality of the Models—The crystal structures of unliganded HpaB, the HpaB·FAD complex, and the HpaB·FAD·4HPA complex were determined at resolutions of 2.00, 1.66, and 1.66 Å, respectively. No electron density was observed for the one N-terminal residue (Met-1) and four C-terminal residues (Glu-478—Ala-481). In addition, in the model of unliganded HpaB and that of the HpaB·FAD complex, the Arg-153—Gln-158 and Ser-197-Thr-198 residues, respectively, were not clearly defined in electron densities and were omitted from the final models. A Ramachandran plot for each model showed that more than 91% of the non-glycine residues fall into the most favored regions and that Met-246 lies in disallowed regions. This residue is anterior to the conserved Asp-247, which forms hydrogen bonds with Thr-185 and two arginine residues (Arg-225 and Arg-433). The unusual main-chain conformation of Met-246 is probably required for the formation of the hydrogen bond network that stabilizes the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate. In addition, in the model of unliganded HpaB, Thr-145 also lies in disallowed regions. Thr-145 is located at the starting position of the loop between β5 and β6. Thr-145 and Leu-144 moved significantly upon binding of FAD, and the conformational change of the main chain of this dipeptide affected the conformations of Ser-197 and Thr-198 (see below). Thus, the unusual main chain conformation of Thr-145 may contribute to preformation of the substrate-binding site. The electron densities of Thr-145 and Met-246 were clearly defined (data not shown). Structure of HpaB—The crystal structure of HpaB is shown in Fig. 1. HpaB is a tetrameric molecule and is arranged as a dimer of dimers (Fig. 1A). The HpaB monomer consists of three domains, the N-terminal (Ala-2—Leu-138), middle (Ala-139—Gly-266), and C-terminal (Asn-267—Tyr-456) domains, with an additional C-terminal α-helical tail (Asn-457—Ala-481) (Figs. 1B and 2). The N- and C-terminal domains consist mainly of antiparallel α-helices, and the middle domain is packed with two β-sheets. One β-sheet consists of β5, β8, β9, and β12, and the other consists of β1, β2, β6, β7, β10, and β11. Two of the C-terminal α-helical tails protrude from the dimer and extend to the other dimer, lying on its surface. There is a groove between the three domains that serves as the binding sites of FADH2 and a substrate.FIGURE 2Amino acid sequence alignment of several oxygenase components belonging to the TC-FDM family and 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase whose structure is most similar to that of HpaB. Secondary structures in HpaB are indicated above the alignment. α-helices and β-strands are indicated by cylinders and arrows, respectively, and the colors correspond to those in Fig. 1B. HpaB shows 21-32% homology with other enzymes.

However, conformational differences are observed in the loop between β5 and β6 (loop β5-β6) and in the loop between β8 and β9 (loop β8-β9) (Figs. 3A and B). In addition, the electron densities of residues Arg-153—Gln-158 in loop β5-β6 that were not seen in the ligand-free model are now visualized. The Pro155—Gln-158 region in loop β5-β6 forms a 310-helix. The conformational change of loop β5-β6 also causes a change in the length of β5. In unliganded HpaB, β5 was assigned from Thr-140 to Leu-144, whereas in the HpaB·FAD complex, it was assigned from Thr-140 to His-142. An important observation is that Leu-144, which occupies part of the FAD binding site in the ligand-free form, is pushed away upon the binding of FAD (Fig. 3C). The movement of Leu-144 in turn affects the conformation of the region around residues Ser-197 and Thr-198 as well as the remaining region of loop β8-β9, resulting in the preformation of the substrate-binding site. Data for a crystal of HpaB obtained in the presence of 4HPA indicated no electron density for 4HPA, and the structure of HpaB was essentially identical to that of unliganded HpaB, indicating that the binding of FAD(H2) was essential for the preformation of the substrate-binding site (data not shown). The structure of the HpaB·FAD·4HPA complex is similar to those of unliganded HpaB and the HpaB·FAD complex, with r.m.s.d. values of 0.865 Å for 470 Cα atoms (Ala-2—Ala-152 and Pro-159—Phe-478) and 0.694 Å for 475 Cα atoms (Ala-2—Pro-196 and Leu-199—Phe-478), respectively (Fig. 3A). Differences among the three structures are observed in loop β8-β9 (Phe-195—Tyr-207) (Fig. 3B). The conformation of loop β8-β9 was further changed compared with that of the HpaB·FAD structure, establishing Ser-197 and Thr-198 as binding sites for the carboxyl group of 4HPA. The main chain of Thr-198 in loop β8-β9 exhibits the largest shifts (7.6 Å) compared with that of the ligand-free form. This conformational change acts to obstruct the catalytic site from the bulk solvent during hydroxylation (see Fig. 5C). Therefore, molecular oxygen could not access the catalytic site after the substrate binding. FAD Binding—The electron density of FAD in the HpaB·FAD complex is clearly observed in the groove (Fig. 4A). FAD has an extended conformation and is located inside the groove (Fig. 4, B and C). The FAD-binding site is shaped by residues His-142—Arg-151 (the C-terminal end of β5 and the following loop), Thr-183—Thr-185 (the C-terminal end of β7), Asp-247 (the N-terminal end of β11), and Arg-433—Arg-447 (the middle of α14 through the N-terminal end of α15). In addition, residues from the neighboring monomer, Ala-312*-Val-318* (the N-terminal end of α9* and the preceding loop), and Gln-378*-Ser-382* (the C-terminal end of α10* and the following loop) also contribute to the binding of the AMP moiety (asterisks indicate residues from the neighboring monomer). FAD is stabilized by eight hydrogen bonds with the main chains, seven hydrogen bonds with the side chains, and eight hydrogen bonds with water molecules. Furthermore, the adenine ring of the AMP moiety is stabilized by stacking interactions with side chains of Arg-447 and Tyr-315*. Despite the conformational changes of loop β5-β6 and loop β8-β9 upon binding of FAD, the groove remains open to the bulk solvent. Accordingly, although the xylene moiety of the isoalloxazine ring is buried in the protein, the re face of the 2,4-pyrimidinedione moiety is accessible to the bulk solvent through ordered water molecules (Fig. 4C). The mouth of the groove is wide enough to allow substrate and molecular oxygen access to the active site after FAD binding. It is worth noting that a water molecule (W1) is bound in the vicinity of the 2,4-pyrimidinedione moiety via hydrogen bonding to Arg-100 and His-142 (Fig. 4B). This water molecule may indicate a possible oxygen-binding site (see below). The binding mode of FAD of HpaB is similar to that of structurally homologous proteins of 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase from Clostridium aminobutyricum (Protein Data Bank code 1U8V; r.m.s.d. of 2.3 Å for 461 Cα atoms with 24% sequence identity) (37Martins B.M. Dobbek H. Çinkaya I. Buckel W. Messerschmidt A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15645-15649Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and pig liver medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Protein Data Bank code 3MDD; r.m.s.d. of 2.9 Å for 304 Cα atoms with 13% sequence identity) (38Kim J.P. Wang M. Paschke R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7523-7527Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), which contain FAD as a prosthetic group. However, there is a remarkable difference among these proteins. The FAD binding in HpaB causes the conformational change in loop β5-β6. The affinity of HpaB for FAD may be affected by the mobility of loop β5-β6. The specificity for FADH2 can be explained by the interaction between HpaB and FAD. The side chains of Gln-148 and Arg-151 in loop β5-β6 interact with the phosphate moiety of the AMP portion of FAD. Thus, FMNH2 may not be stabilized by these residues, resulting in the destabilization of loop β5-β6 and the inability to preform the substrate-binding site. 4HPA Binding—The electron density of 4HPA is shown in Fig. 5A. 4HPA (bound in the active site) is located at the re face of the 2,4-pyrimidinedione moiety of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD (Fig. 5B). Upon binding of 4HPA, loop β8-β9 moves significantly and sequesters the active site from the bulk solvent (Fig. 5C). 4HPA is bound to the protein by both hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions. The carboxyl group of 4HPA is hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of Ser-197 and the main chain nitrogen atom and the side chain of Thr-198. The hydroxyl group of 4HPA forms hydrogen bonds with side chains of Arg-100, Tyr-104, and His-142. These residues are likely to select the substrate and define its orientation. Arg-100, Tyr-104, and His-142 are conserved in oxygenases of the TC-FDM family that act on substrates such as 4HPA and phenol, whereas Ser-197 is not conserved in members acting on compounds without carboxyl groups (such as phenol and chlorophenol). The aromatic ring of 4HPA is sand-wiched between the side chain of Leu-144 and the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Phe-441 and undergoes further contacts with the side chain of Thr-198, the main chain and side chain of Phe-442, and the 2,4-pyrimidinedione moiety of FAD. The distance between the C4a atom of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD and the ortho position of 4HPA is 4.8 Å. This distance is comparable with those of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (5.3 Å (Protein Data Bank code 1PN0)) (39Schreuder H.A. van der Laan J.M. Hol W.G.J. Drenth J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and phenol hydroxylase (4.4 Å (Protein Data Bank code 1PBE)) (25Enroth C. Neujahr H. Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Structure. 1998; 6: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Interestingly, electron density, which is interpreted as 4HPA, is also observed in a region surrounded by the N-terminal end of α10 and the C-terminal end of α15 (Fig. 5A). This substrate is stabilized by a polar interaction between the 4-OH group of 4HPA and the side chain of Asp-359 as well as by hydrophobic interactions with the side chains of Leu-452, Val-455, and Tyr-456. Because this substrate is located in the vicinity of the entrance of the active site, it could approach the active site. However, the residues interacting with this substrate are not conserved in the TC-FDM family, and the function of this extra binding site is unclear. Possible Oxygen-binding Site—Monooxygenases use oxygen molecules for substrate hydroxylation and form the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate. Therefore, the oxygen binding site is expected to be close to the C4a atom of flavin. In the HpaB·FAD·4HPA complex, a water molecule (W2) is bound to a region in the vicinity of the C4a atom of FAD, the ortho position of 4HPA, and the side chain of Arg-100 (Figs. 5B and 6A). The distances of W2 to the C4a atom of FAD and the ortho position of 4HPA are 3.2 and 3.2 Å, respectively. In the HpaB·FAD complex, a water molecule (W1) is bound to a position located 3.4 Å from the C4a atom of FAD, slightly different from that of W2 (Fig. 6A). These water molecules may indicate the binding site of molecular oxygen as well as the position of the C4a-hydroperoxy moiety. It should be noted that W2 may mimic a water molecule that is released from C4a-hydroxyflavin. Stabilization of the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin Intermediate—An important question is how the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate is stabilized until a substrate enters the binding site. As described above, Arg-100 is located in the vicinity of the oxygen-binding site. In the HpaB·FAD complex, the Nϵ atom of Arg-100 is located 4.8 Å from the C4a atom of FAD, and the Nη atom of Arg-100 is located 2.6 Å from the water molecule (W1). If the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate is formed, the Nϵ atom of Arg-100 can form a hydrogen bond with the putative peroxy moiety of the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate (with a minor conformational change in the side chain). This indicates that Arg-100 may contribute to the formation and/or stabilization of the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate. Arg-100 is conserved in the E. coli-type oxygenases of the TC-FDM family. It is worth noting that the N5 atom of the isoalloxazine ring forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Thr-185. This hydrogen bond extends to a salt bridge network formed by Asp-247, Arg-225, Arg-433, and Glu-244. Bach and Su (40Bach R.D. Su M.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 5392-5399Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have suggested that, on the basis of ab initio molecular orbital calculations, a hydrogen bond to the N5 hydrogen of the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate could afford a stabilized transition structure for oxygen transfer, providing a novel explanation for the unusual monooxygenase reactivity of flavins. Thr-185 as well as other residues in the salt bridge network appear to be mostly conserved in the E. coli-type oxygenases (Fig. 2). These contrast to the case of single-component monooxygenases. In these enzymes substrates are bound to the active site before the formation of the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate, so substrate hydroxylation immediately occurs upon formation of the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate (21Entsch B. van Berkel W.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 22Entsch B. Cole L.J. Ballou D.P. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1979; 254: 10944-10951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that, in single-component systems, the stabilization of the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate requires the bound substrate (23Ballou D.P. Entsch B. Cole L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 590-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In fact, structures of these enzymes do not reveal residues that should be involved in the stabilization of the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate. Instead, it appears that single-component enzymes and tryptophan 7-halogenase (43Dong C. Flecks S. Unversucht S. Haupt C. van Pée K.H. Naismith J.H. Science. 2005; 309: 2216-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 44Yeh E. Blasiak L.C. Koglin A. Drennan C.L. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1284-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) as well form a cavity in proximity to flavin to accommodate molecular oxygen as well as the hydroperoxy moiety of the C4a-hydroproxyflavin intermediate (45Alfieri A. Fersini F. Ruangchan N. Prongjit M. Chaiyen P. Mattevi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 104: 1177-1182Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Implications for the Catalytic Mechanism—Our proposed catalytic mechanism is as follows (Fig. 7). (i) A reduced FAD, which is supplied from HpaC, binds to HpaB and is stabilized by loop β5-β6. The substrate-binding site (Ser-197 and Thr-198) is preformed. (ii) The reduced FAD accepts an oxygen molecule at the C4a position of the isoalloxazine ring and forms the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate, which is facilitated and stabilized by Arg-100. (iii) 4HPA binds to the enzymes-C4a-hydroperoxyflavin complex and is stabilized by residues His-142, Tyr-104, Arg-100, Ser-197, and Thr-198. 4HPA is activated by His-142 via deprotonation of the 4-hydroxyl group, and a hydroxyl group of the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate is introduced into the ortho position of 4HPA by electrophilic attack, yielding a dienone form of the product. (iv and v) Rearomatization of the dienone yield DHPA and C4a-hydroxyflavin. (vi) DHPA dissociates from HpaB. (vii) A water molecule is eliminated from the C4a-hydroxyflavin. (viii) Oxidized FAD is released from HpaB and recycled to HpaC to be reduced during the next catalytic cycle. The activation of the substrate is an important factor in the function of aromatic monooxygenases. In p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, the hydrogen bond network that is composed of Tyr-201, Tyr-385, and His-72 is responsible for the deprotonation of the substrate. p-Hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase influences this activation of the hydroxyl group of the substrate by shifting the pKa from 9.3 to 7.4 (46Entsch B. Palfey B.A. Ballou D.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17341-17349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the increased nucleophilicity of the substrate, the enzyme can perform the electrophilic substitution reaction to the aromatic ring of the substrate. His-72 in the hydrogen bond network plays a key role in the deprotonation of a substrate (47Palfey B.A. Moran G.R. Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1153-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In HpaB, the hydroxyl group of 4HPA directly forms a hydrogen bond with each of Arg-100, Tyr-104, and His-142. His-142, in particular, also may play a role in the deprotonation of substrates, as does His-72 of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase. Comparison with Structurally Homologous Proteins—The overall fold of HpaB is similar to that of 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase (37Martins B.M. Dobbek H. Çinkaya I. Buckel W. Messerschmidt A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15645-15649Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (38Kim J.P. Wang M. Paschke R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7523-7527Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), nitroalkane oxidase from Fusarium oxysporum (Protein Data Bank code 2C12; r.m.s.d. of 3.5 Å for 323 Cα with 11% sequence identity) (48Nagpal A. Valley M.P. Fitzpatrick P.F. Orville A.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1138-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and acyl-CoA oxidase II from rat liver (Protein Data Bank code 1IS2; r.m.s.d. of 3.6 Å for 299 Cα with 8% sequence identity) (49Nakajima Y. Miyahara I. Hirotsu K. Nishina Y. Shiga K. Setoyama C. Tamaoki H. Miura R. J. Biochem. 2002; 131: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, the structure of the monooxygenase component (C2; Protein Data Bank code 2JBR; r.m.s.d. of 3.2 Å for 298 Cα atoms with 11% sequence identity) of a two-component monooxygenase from A. baumannii has been reported recently (45Alfieri A. Fersini F. Ruangchan N. Prongjit M. Chaiyen P. Mattevi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 104: 1177-1182Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Superposition of the structures of HpaB and C2 shows that HpaB has many insertion regions compared with C2 (α3-β3, the loop between α5 and α6, loop β5-β6, the loop between β10 and β11, and α11-α13). The absence of loop β5-β6 in C2 is likely to result in a functional difference between the two enzymes. Structural analyses of C2 (45Alfieri A. Fersini F. Ruangchan N. Prongjit M. Chaiyen P. Mattevi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 104: 1177-1182Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar) showed that, upon binding of reduced FMN to C2, only minor conformational changes occur; that is, a tilt of the indole moiety of Trp-169. In addition, no significant conformational change occurs, but the side chain of Phe-266 rotates outward upon binding of substrate, creating the substrate pocket. In contrast, the binding of FAD in HpaB is accompanied by a drastic conformational change in loop β5-β6 and loop β8-β9, including the preformation of the substrate-binding site. The binding of substrate leads to an additional conformational change in loop β8-β9, sequestering the active site from the bulk solvent. C2 can utilize both FADH2 and FMNH2 (19Sucharitakul J. Chaiyen P. Entsch B. Ballou D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17044-17053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), whereas HpaB utilizes only FADH2 (20Xun L. Sandvik E.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This difference of flavin specificity also is related to the structural difference. The flavin-binding site in C2 apparently can accommodate not only FMNH2, but FADH2 and riboflavin, whereas in HpaB flavin specificity is defined by the ability to undergo interactions with Gln-148 and Arg-151 (on loop β5-β6). The architectures of the active sites of HpaB and C2 are different (Fig. 6B). Thr-185 in HpaB is replaced by Ser-171 in C2, whereas there is no residue in C2 that corresponds to Arg-100 in HpaB. However, His-396 in C2 is located at a position different from that of Arg-100 in HpaB and is proposed to play a role similar to Arg-100 (45Alfieri A. Fersini F. Ruangchan N. Prongjit M. Chaiyen P. Mattevi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 104: 1177-1182Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, the substrate recognition of C2 is different from that of HpaB. The hydroxyl group of 4HPA in C2 forms hydrogen bonds with Ser-146 and His-120, whereas that of 4HPA in HpaB makes hydrogen bonds with Arg-100, Tyr-104, and His-142, although the His-120 in C2 plays a key role in the deprotonation of a substrate in the same way as does His-142 in HpaB. These residues in HpaB are conserved in the E. coli-type oxygenase components of the TC-FDM family, which act on 4HPA and phenol as a substrate. In addition, the carboxyl group of 4HPA forms a salt bridge with Arg-263 in C2, whereas that of 4HPA forms a hydrogen bond with Ser-197 and Thr-198 in HpaB.

Here we show iNOS activity is acutely up-regulated by activation of the B1-kinin receptor (B1R) in human endothelial cells or transfected HEK293 cells to generate 2.5-5-fold higher NO than that stimulated by Arg alone. Increased iNOS activity was dependent on B1R activation of the MAPK ERK. In HEK293 cells transfected with human iNOS and B1R, ERK phosphorylated iNOS on Ser745 as determined by Western analysis using phospho-Ser antibody, in vitro kinase assays with activated ERK, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Mutation of Ser745 to Ala did not affect basal iNOS activity but eliminated iNOS phosphorylation and activation in response to B1R agonist. Mutation of Ser745 to Asp resulted in a basally hyperactive iNOS whose activity was not further increased by B1R agonist. ERK and phospho-ERK (after B1R activation) were co-localized with iNOS as determined by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, ERK co-immunoprecipitated with iNOS. The discovery that iNOS can be phosphorylated by ERK and acutely activated by receptor-mediated signaling reveals a new level of regulation for this isoform.

In general, NO serves a protective function at low concentrations under normal conditions, but in inflammatory conditions and at high levels, NO may contribute to tissue damage, especially after reaction with superoxide to form peroxynitrite (5Zamora R.

Under inflammatory conditions, endothelial cells can also express inducible NOS (iNOS) (12Chan G.C. Kim J.E. Mawji I.A. Leung D.D. Rachlis A.C. Marsden P.A. J.

Physiol. 2004; 287: L35-L45Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast to eNOS, iNOS is considered to be regulated primarily at the level of expression (15Kleinert H. Kim A. Linker K. Schwarz P.M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 500: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Once expressed, iNOS is thought to continuously generate NO in the presence of sufficient cofactors and substrate until the protein is degraded (15Kleinert H. Kim A. Linker K. Schwarz P.M. Eur. J.

These properties have led to the concept that iNOS generates high output NO in an unregulated fashion with primarily cytotoxic functions, for example in the host defense response (4Papapetropoulos A. Kim R.D. Sessa W.C. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We showed that activation of the inducible kinin B1 receptor (B1R) with peptide agonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors directly stimulates high output NO production in cytokine-treated human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC) (13Ignjatovic T.

Brovkovych V. Skidgel R.A. Erdös E.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), indicating the possibility of its acute, post-translational activation. We report here that B1R activation results in ERK1/2 activation and phosphorylation of Ser745 in iNOS, resulting in a profound activation and generation of “super-high output” NO. Receptor-dependent activation of iNOS via phosphorylation reveals a new layer of complexity in the regulation of this enzyme that can play an important role in inflammatory conditions. Materials—Human iNOS cDNA in pcDNA3 was a gift from Dr. Timothy Billiar, University of Pittsburgh. Human B1R cDNA was a gift from Dr. Fredrik Leeb-Lundberg, University of Lund, Sweden. Des-Arg10-kallidin (DAKD), phenol red-free DMEM/F-12, and protein A-agarose were from Sigma. PD98059, SB202190, and purified ERK1 were from EMD Biosciences. Effectene was from Qiagen. Arg-free and phenol red-free DMEM (custom-made), Lipofectamine 2000, Opti-MEM I, and human IFN-γ were from Invitrogen. Anti-human iNOS antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (polyclonal; SC-8310) orR&D Systems (monoclonal; MC-5225). IL-1β was from Calbiochem. FBS was from Atlanta Biologicals. Phospho-Ser antibody was from BD Biosciences. Rabbit antibodies to human ERK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2 were from New England Biolabs. Goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa 488 and goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) conjugated with Alexa 543 were from Molecular Probes. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. HLMVEC (Cambrex) were cultured in dishes coated with 0.1% gelatin in basal medium with growth factors and antibiotics from EGM-2 BulletKits (Cambrex) and 10% FBS. HLMVEC were treated with 20 ng/ml IL-1β and 200 units/ml IFN-γ for 16-24 h to induce B1R and iNOS expression (13Ignjatovic T. Kim S. Brovkovych V. Skidgel R.A. Erdös E.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Sangsree S. Kim V. Minshall R.D. Skidgel R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: H1959-H1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were co-transfected with iNOS and B1R cDNA plasmids with Effectene transfection reagent per the manufacturer’s instructions. After 24 h, cells were washed and maintained in DMEM/F-12 with 0.5% FBS overnight and then changed to the medium indicated for experiments. HEK293 cells stably expressing B1Rs were established by transfecting with human B1R cDNA and selecting with 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) and by responsiveness to B1R agonist (increased intracellular Ca2+). HLMVEC were transfected with either B1R or iNOS cDNA plasmids by electroporation with a Nucleofector (Amaxa Biosystems) using the manufacturer's kit and protocol optimized for HLMVEC. Experiments were carried out 48 h after transfection. Generation of Constructs—Overlapping PCR was used to mutate Ser745 to either Ala or Asp using human iNOS cDNA as template. The PCR fragment was re-introduced into iNOS/pcDNA3.1 between the HindIII and NotI restriction sites. iNOS was tagged at the N terminus by inserting iNOS cDNA in-frame into the 3′ end of a pDsRed-Monomer vector (Clontech). For GST fusion constructs, the iNOS sequence encoding amino acids 721-761 was amplified by PCR using full-length WT or the S745A mutant cDNA as template and inserted into pGEX-4T1 in-frame between the BamHI and EcoRI sites. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Western Blotting—Cells were washed, collected, and lysed for 30 min on ice in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatant proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and detected with appropriate primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled second antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence. Detection of ERK and iNOS Phosphorylation—HEK293 cells co-transfected with human iNOS and B1R were serum-starved in DMEM/F-12 for 3 h and then treated with 100 nm DAKD as indicated. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 100 μm sodium vanadate, collected by centrifugation, and lysed as above with buffer containing 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 25 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, and 1 mm sodium vanadate to inhibit phosphatases. Samples were centrifuged (16,000 × g, 4 °C, 15 min), and the supernatants were used. For detection of ERK1/2, aliquots were added to an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to Western blotting with antibody to total or phospho-ERK1/2. For detection of phospho-iNOS, supernatants were pre-cleared by rotating for 30 min with 25 μl of protein A-agarose bound to normal rabbit IgG followed by centrifugation. Supernatants were incubated with 3 μg of polyclonal anti-human iNOS antibody overnight and then with 25 μl of protein A-agarose for 3 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed with 500 μl of lysis buffer five times and once with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. Proteins were eluted as above and analyzed by Western blotting with primary antibodies to either phospho-Ser or iNOS (monoclonal). In Vitro Kinase Assay—The generation and isolation of GST fusion proteins and in vitro kinase assay were done as described (18Zhang Y.-K. Kim X. Muraoka K.-I. Ikeda A. Miyamoto S. Shimizu H. Yoshioka K. Yamamoto K.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34657-34662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was done at 30 °C for 3 h, and 0.5 μg of purified GST fusion protein was incubated with 50 ng of active or inactive ERK1 in kinase assay buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, stained with GelCode Blue (Pierce), and dried, and bands were detected by autoradiography. Measurement of NO Production—For nitrite measurements, aliquots of medium (500 μl) were removed, and nitrate was reduced to nitrite using a Cd-Cu reducer (Nitralyzer II kit, World Precision Instruments) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Nitrite was measured in 50-μl aliquots using the Griess reagent (nitrite detection kit; Promega). NO production was measured directly in real time with a porphyrinic microsensor as described (17Sangsree S. Kim V. Minshall R.D. Skidgel R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: H1959-H1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Brovkovych V. Kim E. Oman J. Tomboulian P. Malinski T. J. Pharmacol. Biomed. Anal. 1999; 19: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 20Malinski T. Kim Z. Nature. 1992; 358: 676-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). The porphyrinic sensor was positioned with a micromanipulator close to the cell culture surface (20 ± 1 μm). In some studies, cells were preincubated in l-Arg-free and phenol red-free DMEM for 2-3 h. After establishing a base line, 1 mm l-Arg ± 100 nm DAKD was added, and the response (current versus time) was recorded continuously. Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy—HEK293 cells stably expressing WT human B1R were transfected with DsRed-MFP-iNOS and ERK1 cDNA. After 24 h, cells were serum-starved with 0.5% FBS in DMEM/F-12 medium overnight and then treated with 100 nm DAKD for the indicated times. HLMVEC seeded on coverslips were cytokine-treated for 16 h as above, then serum-starved for 3 h in EBM-2 with 0.5% FBS, and treated with 100 nm DAKD for the indicated times. Cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed on ice for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. HEK293 cells were stained with rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2 or anti-ERK1/2 antibody (1:1000 dilution) followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG second antibody conjugated with Alexa 488 (1:750 dilution). HLMVEC were stained with mouse monoclonal anti-human iNOS antibody (1:200 dilution) and rabbit anti-ERK1/2 antibody (1:200 dilution) followed by goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugated with Alexa 488 (1:750 dilution) for iNOS and goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) conjugated with Alexa 543 (1:750 dilution) for ERK1/2. Coverslips were mounted on slides with mount medium (Vectashield) and scanned using an Olympus LMS510 Meta confocal microscope. MALDI-TOF Analysis—HEK293 cells stably expressing B1Rs were transfected with WT, S745A, or S745D iNOS and then incubated with or without 100 nm DAKD for 5 min. Cells were lysed in buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors and immunoprecipitated with anti-iNOS antibody as above. An aliquot of immunoprecipitate from cells transfected with WT iNOS but not treated with DAKD was incubated with purified active ERK1 as described above. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7% gels and stained with GelCode Blue, and the iNOS band at 130 kDa was excised and digested with trypsin as described (21Lee B.S. Kim S. Krisnanchettier S. Lateef S.S. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 334: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides were subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using a cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix and analyzed by a Voyager DE-PRO mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a nitrogen laser as described (21Lee B.S. Kim S. Krisnanchettier S. Lateef S.S. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 334: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). HLMVEC were treated with IL-1β and IFN-γ for 16 h to up-regulate expression of iNOS and the B1R (13Ignjatovic T. Kim S. Brovkovych V. Skidgel R.A. Erdös E.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Sangsree S. Kim V. Minshall R.D. Skidgel R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: H1959-H1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). After incubation in Arg-free medium for 3 h, addition of 1 mm Arg resulted in prolonged high output NO (Fig. 1A), reaching a maximum of 295 ± 22 nm NO (n = 3). In HLMVEC not preincubated in Arg-free medium, addition of 100 nm B1R agonist, DAKD, caused a greater increase in NO production that peaked between 40 and 60 min (Fig. 1B), reaching a maximum of 832 ± 37 nm NO (n = 3). Total NO output (measured as area under the curve) was much greater for cells treated with DAKD than cells treated with Arg (Fig. 1C). The specific iNOS inhibitor, 4 μm 1400W, blocked the response to either DAKD or Arg but only the response to DAKD was inhibited by B1R antagonist des-Arg10-Leu8-kallidin (Fig. 1, A-C). Further proof that B1Rs can activate iNOS was obtained in transfected HEK293 cells. DAKD (100 nm) generated only low levels of NO in mock-transfected cells or cells transfected with either iNOS alone or B1R alone (Fig. 1D). However, in cells co-transfected with B1R and iNOS, DAKD generated a profound output of NO that was blocked by the iNOS inhibitor 1400W (Fig. 1D). To confirm these results, nitrite accumulation was measured in HEK293 cells transfected with B1R and iNOS. Cells incubated with fresh medium alone (containing 0.7 mm Arg) generated 1.2 ± 0.1 μm (n = 4) nitrite in 20 min, reflecting basal iNOS activity. Addition of 100 nm DAKD with fresh medium increased nitrite accumulation to 6.2 ± 0.3 μm, which was inhibited 77% by a B1 antagonist, 1 μm des-Arg10-Leu8-kallidin (1.4 ± 0.1 μm nitrite; n = 4). Finally, in B1R- and iNOS-transfected cells, 1 mm Arg stimulated a slow increase in NO concentration as measured with the NO electrode, but addition of 100 nm DAKD 5 min later caused a further 3-fold increase in the slope of the rate of NO production (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these data show that B1R stimulation results in acute activation of iNOS, a novel mode of regulation for this enzyme. It has been reported that B1Rs can activate eNOS transfected into adventitial fibroblasts of cerebral arteries (22Tsutsui M. Kim H. Iida Y. Smith L. O'Brien T. Katusic Z.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H367-H372PubMed Google Scholar), and we reported that B1R-dependent NO production was because of eNOS activation in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (13Ignjatovic T. Kim S. Brovkovych V. Skidgel R.A. Erdös E.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, in HLMVEC, B1R-dependent NO production is blocked by the highly specific iNOS inhibitor 1400W (Fig. 1) and not by the relatively eNOS/nNOS-specific inhibitor l-NG-nitroarginine (l-NNA) (13Ignjatovic T. Kim S. Brovkovych V. Skidgel R.A. Erdös E.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To further rule out the involvement of eNOS activation in the HLMVEC response, we transfected HLMVEC (not cytokine-treated) with the B1R alone and stimulated with 100 nm DAKD. As shown in Fig. 2A, B1R-transfected cells generated relatively low levels of NO that were only slightly higher than that in control HLMVEC or vector-transfected cells. NO production was not because of eNOS activation as it was not inhibited by 4 μm l-NNA (Fig. 2A). These results are consistent with our previous report of a low level of prolonged B1R-dependent NO output in control HLMVEC (17Sangsree S. Kim V. Minshall R.D. Skidgel R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: H1959-H1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), which constitutively express low levels of iNOS (not shown). To confirm that l-NNA does inhibit eNOS in HLM-VEC, cells were stimulated with 10 μm A23187, the calcium ionophore, to acutely activate eNOS, which resulted in a sharp pulse of NO output reaching a maximum of 218 ± 13 nm within 3 s and returning to base line within 20 s (not shown). l-NNA (4 μm) pretreatment substantially reduced the response to A23187 (70 ± 7nm NO), whereas 50 μm PD98059 had no effect (222 ± 13 nm NO). To show that B1Rs were efficiently transfected, HLMVEC were cotransfected with B1Rs + iNOS and then stimulated with either 1 mm Arg or 100 nm DAKD. Under these conditions, DAKD stimulated high output NO (Fig. 2B) similar to that seen in cytokine-treated HLMVEC (Fig. 1). We explored the involvement of ERK as the B1R is known to activate this MAPK (23Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Kim F. Muller-Esterl W. Pettibone D.J. Zuraw B.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 57: 27-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). In HEK293 cells transfected with B1R and iNOS, 100 nm DAKD stimulated a large increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation within 5 min and was still elevated at 20 min (Fig. 3A). In transfected HEK293 cells or cytokine-treated HLMVEC preincubated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059, NO production in response to 100 nm DAKD was substantially reduced (Fig. 3B), indicating ERK activation is required to stimulate iNOS activity. To determine whether iNOS is phosphorylated in response to B1R activation, we used phospho-Ser-specific antibody to probe immunoprecipitated iNOS. As shown in Fig. 3C, there was substantial serine phosphorylation of iNOS within 5 min of DAKD stimulation, which remained elevated at 20 min. A phosphorylated dimer form of iNOS was also seen under these denaturing conditions (Fig. 3C), which may represent the nondissociable dimer form of iNOS recently reported in HEK293 cells expressing iNOS (24Kolodziejski P.J. Kim M.B. Eissa N.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14263-14268Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The iNOS phosphorylation was ERK-dependent as PD98059 inhibited it (Fig. 3D). Although eNOS activity is regulated by phosphorylation (25Venema R.C. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2002; 2: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), none of the identified phosphorylation sites are conserved in iNOS. Analysis of the human iNOS sequence with Scansite (26Obenauer J.C. Kim L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3635-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar) and NetPhos (27Blom N. Kim S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar) revealed one highly significant potential MAPK phosphorylation site at Ser745, which is conserved in all known iNOS sequences (Fig. 4A). This Ser is also conserved in nNOS and eNOS (Fig. 4A) but has not been reported to be phosphorylated. We mutated Ser745 to Ala (S745A) and found that phosphorylation was greatly diminished in response to B1R stimulation (Fig. 3C). To prove that ERK can directly phosphorylate Ser745, WT and S745A GST-iNOS fusion proteins containing residues 721-761 were generated. When incubated with purified active (phospho)-ERK1 in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, a phosphorylated band was seen with either WT GST-iNOS-(721-761) or ATF-2 (positive control) but not with S745A GST-iNOS-(721-761) (Fig. 5A). Inactive (de-phospho) ERK1 did not yield any radioactive bands (not shown). Further evidence was obtained from MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides from immunoprecipitated iNOS. A tryptic peptide with the sequence QNLQSPTSSR (where the underlined S indicates Ser at position 745) was at m/z 1117.560 in all samples from cells transfected with WT iNOS (Fig. 5B), but not in those transfected with either S745A or S745D mutants, which yielded instead peaks at 1101.564 or 1145.569, respectively, because of altered masses of the mutated residues (not shown). A peak corresponding to the phosphorylated form of the tryptic peptide (80 Da larger at m/z 1197.526) was detected in WT iNOS treated in vitro with activated ERK or from cells stimulated with 100 nm DAKD but not in WT iNOS from untreated cells (Fig. 5B) or cells transfected with the S745A or S745D mutants and treated with DAKD (not shown).FIGURE 5Activated ERK phosphorylates Ser745 in iNOS. A, WT and S745A GST-iNOS-(721-761) or GST-ATF-2 fusion proteins were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and active ERK for 30 min followed by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained for protein (bottom panel) and then analyzed for radioactivity by autoradiography (top panel). B, HEK293 cells stably expressing B1Rs and transfected with iNOS were untreated (WT control) or treated with 100 nm DAKD for 5 min. iNOS immunoprecipitated from untreated cells was also incubated with active ERK in vitro. Immunoprecipitated iNOS was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and tryptic peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Peaks corresponding to iNOS residues 741-750 (m/z = 1117.560 nonphosphorylated, 1197.526 phosphorylated) and residues 222-229 (m/z = 1121.487) are indicated by arrows. The peak at m/z = 1198.6 was not identified. Results shown are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether phosphorylation at Ser745 is required for B1R-mediated activation of iNOS, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with B1R and either WT iNOS, the S745A mutant (to block phosphorylation), or S745D mutant (to mimic phosphorylation). The basal activities of WT and S745A iNOS were equal in response to 1 mm Arg, but 100 nm DAKD + 1mm Arg resulted in ∼5-fold greater NO in cells expressing WT iNOS but no increase in cells expressing the S745A mutant (Fig. 6). In contrast, the S745D mutant generated super-high output NO in response to 1 mm Arg that was equivalent to the WT response to 100 nm DAKD + Arg, but the B1R agonist did not cause a further increase (Fig. 6). Thus, mutation of Ser745 to Ala did not affect basal iNOS activity but prevented its receptor-mediated activation, whereas mutation to Asp resulted in iNOS that was fully activated without receptor stimulation. The sequence around Ser745 (Met735-Leu757) contains three additional conserved residues that are predicted potential phosphorylation sites; Ser739, Ser748, and Thr752 (Fig. 4A). We generated three additional iNOS mutants (S739A, S748A, and T752A) and co-transfected them with B1Rs in HEK293 cells. NO production of these mutants in response to 1 mm Arg or 100 nm DAKD was essentially identical to that of WT iNOS (data not shown). HEK293 cells stably expressing B1Rs were transfected with ERK1 and iNOS N-terminally tagged with DsRed-monomer fluorescent protein (DsRed-MFP). Co-localization of iNOS and ERK1 was apparent in unstimulated cells when stained with anti-ERK1/2 antibody, but there was no nuclear staining of ERK1/2 and staining with anti-phospho ERK1/2 antibody gave no signal (Fig. 7A). After stimulation with 100 nm DAKD for 10 min, cells stained brightly with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody in both the cytosol and nucleus, and a high degree of co-localization of iNOS and phospho-ERK1 was apparent in the cytosol (Fig. 7A). Evidence for interaction of iNOS and ERK was obtained in co-immunoprecipitation studies. Antibodies to iNOS co-immunoprecipitated ERK1 only in cells co-expressing iNOS and ERK1, both in the absence and presence of 100 nm DAKD (Fig. 7B). To explore this interaction in HLMVEC, cytokine-treated cells were serum-starved for 3 h and were then treated with 100 nm DAKD. As shown in Fig. 8A, there was robust ERK activation within 1-5 min in response to B1R agonist. Immunostaining of the cells with antibodies to iNOS and ERK showed co-localization that intensified after 1 and 5 min of"
https://openalex.org/W2081674731,"For chromosomes to congress and segregate during cell division, kinetochores must form stable attachments with spindle microtubules. We find that the centrosome protein, xCep57, localizes to kinetochores and interacts with the kinetochore proteins Zwint, Mis12, and CLIP-170. Immunodepletion of xCep57 from egg extracts yields weakened and elongated bipolar spindles which fail to align chromosomes. In the absence of xCep57, tension is lost between sister kinetochores, and spindle microtubules are no longer resistant to low doses of nocodazole. xCep57 inhibition on isolated mitotic chromosomes inhibits kinetochore-microtubule binding in vitro. xCep57 also interacts with γ-tubulin. In xCep57 immunodepleted extracts, sperm centrosomes nucleate with normal kinetics, but are unable maintain microtubule anchorage. This characterization places xCep57 in a novel class of proteins required for stable microtubule attachments at the kinetochore and at the centrosome and suggests that the mechanism of microtubule binding at these two places is mechanistically similar."
https://openalex.org/W1988316620,"The molecular identity of mammalian phosphopentomutase has not yet been established unequivocally. That of glucose-1,6-bisphosphate synthase, the enzyme that synthesizes a cofactor for phosphomutases and putative regulator of glycolysis, is completely unknown. In the present work, we have purified phosphopentomutase from human erythrocytes and found it to copurify with a 68-kDa polypeptide that was identified by mass spectrometry as phosphoglucomutase 2 (PGM2), a protein of the α-d-phosphohexomutase family and sharing about 20% identity with mammalian phosphoglucomutase 1. Data base searches indicated that vertebrate genomes contained, in addition to PGM2, a homologue (PGM2L1, for PGM2-like 1) sharing about 60% sequence identity with this protein. Both PGM2 and PGM2L1 were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and their properties were studied. Using catalytic efficiency as a criterion, PGM2 acted more than 10-fold better as a phosphopentomutase (both on deoxyribose 1-phosphate and on ribose 1-phosphate) than as a phosphoglucomutase. PGM2L1 showed only low (<5%) phosphopentomutase and phosphoglucomutase activities compared with PGM2, but was about 5–20-fold better than the latter enzyme in catalyzing the 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate-dependent synthesis of glucose 1,6-bisphosphate and other aldose-bisphosphates. Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that PGM2L1 was mainly expressed in brain where glucose-1,6-bisphosphate synthase activity was previously shown to be particularly high. We conclude that mammalian phosphopentomutase and glucose-1,6-bisphosphate synthase correspond to two closely related proteins, PGM2 and PGM2L1, encoded by two genes that separated early in vertebrate evolution.

Biochemical characterization of phosphoglucomutase (PGM) isozymes indicated that one of them, designated PGM2 in man (PGM1 in mouse) was more active as a phosphopentomutase than as a phosphoglucomutase, whereas mammalian PGM1 (equivalent to PGM2 in mouse) has a phosphopentomutase activity representing only about 0.2% of its phosphoglucomutase activity (3Quick C.B. Kim R.A. Harris H. Ann. Hum. Genet. 1972; 35: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Phosphopentomutase has been purified from rat liver to near homogeneity and shown to coelute with a polypeptide of 32.5 kDa (4Barsky D.L. Kim P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 743: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the sequence of which was not determined. Analysis of cell hybrids indicated that the PGM2 locus is on human chromosome 4p14-q12 (5Wijnen L.M. Kim K.H. Pearson P.L. Meera Khan P. Hum. Genet. 1977; 37: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A putative protein sharing ≈20% identity with PGM1 is encoded by a gene present on human chromosome 4p14. It is designated PGM2 in the databases presumably because its chromosomal localization fits with the PGM2 locus but it has never been shown to act as a phosphopentomutase. Furthermore, its size (612 amino acid residues) is about twice that reported for rat liver phosphopentomutase (4Barsky D.L. Kim P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 743: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In view of these contradictory findings, we decided to reinvestigate the identity of human phosphopentomutase, which we formally identify in this report as the protein designated PGM2 in the data bases. We also show that a closely related protein, PGM2-like 1 (PGM2L1), which shares ≈ 60% sequence identity with PGM2, actually corresponds to glucose-1,6-bisphosphate synthase. This enzyme, which had not yet been molecularly identified, catalyzes the 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate-dependent synthesis of glucose 1,6-bisphosphate and other aldose-bisphosphates that serve as cofactors for several sugar phosphomutases and possibly also as regulators of glycolytic enzymes. Materials—Reagents, of analytical grade whenever possible, were from Sigma, Acros (Geel, Belgium), Roche Applied Sciences (Mannheim, Germany), or Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). DEAE-Sepharose, SP-Sepharose, Q-Sepharose, Superdex-200 10/300 GL, HisTrap, and PD-10 column were purchased from GE Healthcare (Diegem, Belgium). Vivaspin-2 centrifugal concentrator was from Vivascience (Göttingen, Germany). Enzymes and restriction enzymes were purchased from Sigma, Roche Applied Sciences, or Fermentas (St Leon-Rot, Germany). TriPure reagent was from Roche Applied Sciences and the cDNA synthesis kit was from Fermentas. Purification of Phosphopentomutase—Phosphopentomutase was purified from human erythrocytes. 80 ml of packed erythrocytes were washed three times with 150 mm NaCl and diluted in 400 ml of a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml antipain. The hemolysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 11,000 × g. The supernatant (300 ml) was diluted twice in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml antipain) and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (200 cm3) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 400 ml of buffer A, and protein was eluted with a 0–0.25 m NaCl gradient in 1000 ml of buffer A. The most active fractions were pooled (75 ml), brought to 300 ml with buffer B (25 mm MES, pH 6, 1 mm DTT, 25 mm KCl, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml antipain), and applied to a SP-Sepharose column (25 cm3) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with 100 ml of equilibration buffer. Phosphopentomutase was recovered in the flow-through and washing fractions, which were concentrated to 37.5 ml by ultrafiltration in a 200-ml Amicon cell equipped with a PM-10 membrane. This sample was brought to 180 ml with buffer C (25 mm glycine, pH 9, 1 mm DTT, 25 mm KCl, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml antipain) and applied to a Q-Sepharose column (20 cm3) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 80 ml of buffer C, and the retained proteins were eluted with a 0–0.75 m NaCl gradient in 300 ml of buffer C. The most active fractions (6.6 ml) were concentrated to 0.5 ml (with Vivaspin-2) and gel-filtered on a Superdex-200 10/300 GL column equilibrated with buffer D (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml antipain, and 100 mm NaCl). Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. Protein was assayed as described (6Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The bands co-eluting with the phosphopentomutase activity were cut out from a 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide-SDS gel and digested with trypsin. Peptides were analyzed by nanoelectrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometry (7Achouri Y. Kim G. Vertommen D. Rider M.H. Veiga-Da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) in a LCQ Deca XP Plus ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) fitted with a nanoelectrospray probe. The data were analyzed with the X-calibur software (ThermoFinnigan), and the proteins were identified with TurboSEQUEST in the BioWorks software suite (ThermoFinnigan). Overexpression and Purification of Human PGM2 and PGM2L1—The open reading frame of human PGM2 and PGM2L1 (GenBank™ accession numbers NP_060760 and NP_775853) were PCR-amplified using a mixture of Taq and Pfu DNA polymerases and human white blood cells cDNA as a template. For PGM2, a 5′ primer containing the initiator codon (CAAGCTCACATATGGCGGCTCCAGAAGGCAG) in an NdeI site (in bold) and a 3′-primer containing the putative stop codon (GGCTGGAGATCTTTAGTCTGCTTTTGGCTGCAGAT) flanked by a BglII site (in bold) were used. The 1840-bp PCR-product was digested with NdeI-BglII and cloned into pET-15b expression vector. The insert was checked by sequencing. This expression vector was used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3). For PGM2L1, a 5′ primer containing the initiator codon (CCATATGGCTGAAAACACAGAGGGGG) in an NdeI site (in bold) and a 3′ primer containing the putative stop codon (TGGATCCCTAAACAGAACGCCAGATCA) flanked by a BamHI site (in bold) were used. A 1870-bp product was obtained, which was subcloned in pBlueScript and checked by sequencing. A NdeI-BamHI fragment was removed from the pBlueScript plasmid and ligated in pET-15b expression vector. This vector was used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS. Protein expression and preparation of bacterial extracts were performed as described previously (8Fortpied J. Kim R. Stroobant V. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Both His-tagged proteins were purified on HisTrap columns (Ni2+ form) as previously described (9Gemayel R. Kim J. Rzem R. Vertommen D. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 4360-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Both proteins were eluted with ≈150 mm imidazole (as indicated by SDS-PAGE analysis). Both proteins were desalted on PD-10 columns equilibrated with 25 mm Hepes pH 7.4 and 50 mm KCl. Protein concentration was estimated by measuring A280 assuming extinction coefficients of 83,810 and 97,260 m–1 cm–1 for PGM2 and PGM2L1, respectively; 22 mg of pure PGM2 and 3 mg of pure PGM2L1 were obtained per liter of culture. The purified proteins were supplemented with 10% (w/v) glycerol and stored at –70 °C. Measurement of Enzymatic Activities—The enzymatic activities were assayed spectrophotometrically at 30 °C. All assay media (reaction mixture of 600 μl) contained 25 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 100 μm EGTA (assay buffer). Phosphoribomutase was assayed in assay buffer containing 1 mm MnCl2, 50 μm CTP-Mg, 0.15 mm NADPH, 0.5 μm glucose 1,6-bisphosphate, different concentrations of ribose 1-phosphate, ribose-5-phosphate isomerase from spinach (1.7 units/ml), Haemophilus influenzae ribulose-5-phosphate reductase (0.3 units/ml) (10Follens A. Kim M. Merckx R. van Schaftingen E. van Eldere J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2001-2007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and PGM2 (0.03 μg/ml) or PGM2L1 (2 μg/ml). One unit of enzyme is the amount that converts 1 μmol of substrate per min under these conditions. Phosphodeoxyribomutase was assayed in assay buffer containing 0.15 mm NADH, 5 μm glucose 1,6-bisphosphate, different concentrations of deoxyribose 1-phosphate, deoxyribose-5-phosphate aldolase (6 μg/ml, from Thermus thermophilus, overexpressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity), 6T. Sokolova and M. Veiga-da-Cunha, unpublished results. rabbit muscle triose phosphate isomerase (3.5 units/ml) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1 units/ml), as well as PGM2 (0.03 μg/ml) or PGM2L1 (5 μg/ml). Phosphoglucomutase was assayed in assay buffer containing 0.25 mm NADP, 5 μm glucose 1,6-bisphosphate, different concentrations of glucose 1-phosphate, yeast glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (3 units/ml) and PGM2 (0.15 μg/ml) or PGM2L1 (2.4 μg/ml). The glucose-1,6-bisphosphate synthase and aldose-bisphosphate synthase activities were determined in assay buffer containing 500 μm inorganic phosphate, 20 μm glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, 500 μm NAD, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, different concentrations of aldose monophosphate, rabbit muscle glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1 unit/ml) and PGM2 (1.5 μg/ml) or PGM2L1 (0.8 to 2.8 μg/ml). RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real Time PCR Assays—Total RNA was extracted from fresh tissues from 3 male fed mice with TriPure reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA integrity was verified by loading RNA onto a 1% agarose gel and evaluating the 28 S and 18 S ribosomal RNA bands, and its purity was assessed by checking A260/A280. Approximately 1 μg of RNA from each sample was converted to cDNA by RT-PCR using random hexamers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase. Gene-specific primers (Table 1) were designed to generate PCR products of about 150 bp from PGM2, PGM2L1 and two reference genes: GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and HPRT (hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase). Intron-spanning primers were selected to verify, by agarose gel electrophoresis, that amplification of contaminating genomic DNA did not take place. Real-time PCR was performed using an iCycler IQ™ system (Bio-Rad). The rate of accumulation of amplified DNA was measured by continuous monitoring of SYBR green I fluorescence.TABLE 1Primer sequences for PGM2, PGM2L1, and internal control genesSymbolNameForward primerReverse primerPGM2Phosphoglucomutase 2GCTGTTATTTGTGCAGAGCTGCTTCCCGTCATAGTTTCTCAGPGM2L1Phosphoglucomutase 2-like 1GAAGGTAACACTGATGGAGCATGGTTATGTCCCGTACATGCAGAPDHGlyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseTGCACCACCAACTGCTTAGCGGATGCAGGGATGATGTTCTHPRTHypoxanthine phosphoribosyl-transferaseGTTAAGCAGTACAGCCCCAAAATGAAATCCAACAAAGTCTGGCCTGTA Open table in a new tab Tree Construction—The sequence of homologues of human PGM2 and PGM2L1, identified with the BLAST program (11Altschul S.F.

Kim T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35495) Google Scholar). A neighbor-joining tree was constructed using the tree option of Clustal X after exclusion of positions with gaps and with correction for multiple substitutions. For the bootstrap analysis, 1000 samplings were carried out. Purification of Human Erythrocyte Phosphopentomutase—During its purification, phosphopentomutase was assayed by measuring the conversion of ribose 1-phosphate to ribose 5-phosphate with a coupled assay using ribose-5-phosphate isomerase and ribulose-5-phosphate reductase. Phosphopentomutase was purified from human erythrocytes about 100-fold by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, SP-Sepharose, Q-Sepharose and Superdex with an overall yield of 0.4%. This low yield was due to the fact that after each purification step, only the most purified fractions were used for the next step. SDS-PAGE analysis of the fractions of the last purification step showed that the enzymatic activity co-purified with a 68-kDa band (Fig. 1), which was cut out from the gel and digested with trypsin. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated that the 68-kDa protein corresponded (p < 5.5 × 10–6 in the Bioworks software) to a protein designated PGM2 (GenBank™ accession number NP_060760) in the databases. Nine matching peptides (underlined in Fig. 2) were found, which covered 96 amino acids. As a previous report had suggested that phosphopentomutase corresponded to a 32.5-kDa polypeptide chain, we also analyzed the ≈30-kDa polypeptide band that coeluted with phosphopentomutase activity (though less ideally than the 68-kDa band). This protein, which was identified (p < 2.2 × 10–10) as triose phosphate isomerase (GenBank™ accession number NP_000356), is unrelated to phosphopentomutase.FIGURE 2Alignment of human PGM2 and PGM2L1. Conserved residues are indicated by an asterisk below the alignment. The highly conserved TASHNP motif from the α-d-phosphohexomutase family is in bold. The peptides identified by mass spectrometry in the protein purified from human erythrocytes are underlined in the PGM2 sequence. The following sequences are shown: human PGM2 (GenBank™ accession number gi-63055049) and PGM2L1 (GenBank™ accession number gi-31377548).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Occurrence of PGM2 Homologues—BLAST searches with human PGM2 indicated that homologues of this protein were found in eukaryotes including vertebrates (>70% identity with the human sequence), insects and Caenorhabditis elegans (both ≈50% identity) and fungi (≈40% identity). No orthologue was detected in plant genomes. Vertebrate genomes also encode a closely related protein, designated PGM2-like 1 (PGM2L1), which shares about 60% sequence identity with PGM2. As shown in the sequence alignment of Fig. 2, a remarkable feature of the PGM2L1 proteins was that they do not contain a proline but an arginine in the highly conserved TASHNP motif that surrounds the phosphorylatable serine in the phosphoglucomutase family (13Ray W.J. Kim Hermodson Puvathingal M.A. Mahoney J.M. W. C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9166-9174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Shackelford G.S. Kim C.A. Beamer L.J. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2130-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The evolutionary tree illustrated in Fig. 3 shows that PGM2L1 and PGM2 separated early on during vertebrate evolution, as indicated by the presence of orthologues of both PGM2 and PGM2L1 in Danio rerio. PGM2 and PGM2L1 are distantly related to PGM1, sharing only about 20% sequence identity with this enzyme (not shown). They are also similar to phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase (PGM3) in a region (TASHNP) that surrounds the serine residue that is phosphorylated during catalysis (not shown). Analysis with PSORT (15Horton P. Kim K. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1997; 5: 147-152PubMed Google Scholar) and Target P (16Emanuelsson O. Kim H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3619) Google Scholar) indicated that the sequences of both human PGM2 and PGM2L1 do not contain a signal peptide, a mitochondrial propeptide, or a nuclear localization signal, suggesting that both proteins are cytosolic. Tissue Distribution of PGM2 and PGM2L1—The tissue distribution of PGM2 and PGM2L1 mRNAs was determined in mice by quantitative real-time PCR using both glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) transcripts as references. Fig. 4A shows that for PGM2, the highest expression levels were observed in lung, spleen, and thymus. Other tissues contained at least 20% of the levels found in lung or spleen if HPRT was used as a reference. The lower levels observed in skeletal muscle and heart when GAPDH was used as a reference are presumably because of the high expression of this glycolytic enzyme in muscle. As for PGM2L1 (Fig. 4B), the highest levels of expression were observed in brain and testis, intermediate levels were found in thymus, spleen, lung and skeletal muscle, and the lowest levels (about 2–3% of the maximal ratio) were recorded in kidney, liver, and heart. Overexpression and Characterization of Human PGM2 and PGM2L1—Both proteins were overexpressed in E. coli as fusion proteins with a polyHis tag at their N terminus and purified on His-Trap to near homogeneity. The ability of the two enzymes to convert ribose 1-phosphate, deoxyribose 1-phosphate, and glucose 1-phosphate to the corresponding aldose 5- or 6-phosphates was determined with specific spectrophotometric assays. As shown in Table 2, PGM2 displayed significant phosphomutase activity on all three substrates. In terms of catalytic efficiency the best substrates were deoxyribose 1-phosphate and ribose 1-phosphate, which were 27 and 12 times better than glucose 1-phosphate, respectively. The highest Vmax was observed with ribose 1-phosphate and the lowest Km, with deoxyribose 1-phosphate. PGM2L1 showed much lower phosphomutase activity on all three substrates, the Vmax being in all cases less than 5% of that observed with PGM2. All phosphomutase activities mentioned above were stimulated by glucose 1,6-bisphosphate. In the case of the phosphoglucomutase activity of PGM2, half-maximal stimulation was observed at 0.16 and 0.18 μm glucose 1,6-bisphosphate in the presence of 100 and 500 μm glucose 1-phosphate, respectively. In the case of PGM2L1, half-maximal stimulation was observed at much higher glucose 1,6-bisphosphate concentrations (1.15 μm in the presence of both 20 and 200 μm glucose 1-phosphate).TABLE 2Phosphomutase activities of PGM2 and PGM2L1VmaxKmkcat/KmCatalytic efficiency ratio (PGM2/PGM2L1)μmol min-1 mg-1μms-1 μm-1PGM2 Ribose-1-P104.3 ± 3.745.7 ± 3.72.7 ± 0.216.5 ± 2.5 Deoxyribose-1-P20.8 ± 1.04.1 ± 1.36.2 ± 0.7407 ± 74 Glucose-1-P22.8 ± 0.6114 ± 3.10.23 ± 0.014.7 ± 0.5PGM2L1 Ribose-1-P0.71 ± 0.045.2 ± 0.80.17 ± 0.02 Deoxyribose-1-P0.09 ± 0.016.7 ± 0.70.015 ± 0.001 Glucose-1-P0.87 ± 0.0920.7 ± 1.30.051 ± 0.003 Open table in a new tab Glucose-1,6-bisphosphate Synthase Activity—The low phosphopentomutase and phosphoglucomutase activities of PGM2L1 suggested that it played a different role. As a screen to identify molecules that could potentially serve as substrates for PGM2L1, we tested the ability of a series of phosphate esters to inhibit the phosphoribomutase activity of this enzyme. Interestingly, we found that glycerol 3-phosphate and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate were strong inhibitors of PGM2L1 though not of PGM2. At a concentration of 200 μm, glycerol 3-phosphate and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate inhibited the phosphoribomutase activity of PGM2L1 (tested with 20 μm ribose 1-phosphate) by 95 and 99%, respectively, but that of PGM2 by only ≈50%. This finding suggested that the phosphate ester of a C3 compound could be a substrate for PGM2L1. Previous work has disclosed the existence of a glucose-1,6-bisphosphate synthase, which uses the high energy compound 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to convert glucose 1-phosphate or glucose 6-phosphate to glucose 1,6-bisphosphate (17Rose I.A. Kim J.V. Kaklij G. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3466-3470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wong L.J. Kim I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5431-5439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme was shown to be particularly active in brain. It was purified from this tissue and identified as a 70-kDa protein, which acted also with low activity, as a phosphoglucomutase, all properties that are similar to those of PGM2L1. To test the ability of the latter to synthesize glucose 1,6-bisphosphate from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and glucose 1- or 6-phosphate, we designed a spectrophotometric assay in which the activity of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (monitored by the appearance of NADH) is coupled to the utilization of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate by the synthase. This coupling is made possible by the fact that the reaction catalyzed by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Fig. 5A) readily reaches its thermodynamic equilibrium in the absence of an enzyme that consumes 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. However, as illustrated in Fig. 5B, the progression of the reaction (and therefore NADH formation) can be made to resume by adding a 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate consuming system, e.g. 3-phosphoglycerate kinase and ADP. Fig. 5B also shows that NADH formation resumes upon addition of glucose 1-phosphate and PGM2L1 (although not if each of them is added separately; not shown), which indicates that PGM2L1 utilizes 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to catalyze the formation of glucose 1,6-bisphosphate. The rate of NADH formation in this phase was proportional to the concentration of PGM2L1. Using this assay, we found that PGM2L1 showed an aldose bisphosphate synthase activity with glucose 1-phosphate, deoxyribose 1-phosphate, ribose 1-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, and mannose 1-phosphate as substrates, but little or no activity on mannose 6-phosphate, ribose 5-phosphate, and deoxyribose 5-phosphate (Table 3). These findings are in good agreement with previous results obtained with glucose-1,6-bisphosphate synthase purified from mouse brain (17Rose I.A. Kim J.V. Kaklij G. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3466-3470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Guha S.K. Kim Z.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 250: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The homologous enzyme PGM2 showed some ability to synthesize aldose bisphosphates but was about 5–20-fold less active than PGM2L1 in this respect. The synthase activity was more potently inhibited by glucose 1,6-bisphosphate, the product of the reaction, in the case of PGM2 than of PGM2L1: when tested with 1 mm glucose 1-phosphate, 50% inhibition was reached with 10 μm glucose 1,6-bisphosphate in the case of PGM2 as compared with 50 μm in the case of PGM2L1.TABLE 3Glucose 1,6-bisphosphate synthase and other aldose-bisphosphate synthase activities of PGM2 and PGM2L1SubstratePGM2PGM2L1Activity at 1 mm substrateVmax* or activity at 1 mm substrateKmkcat/Kmμmol min-1 mg-1μmol min-1 mg-1mms-1 μm-1Glucose-1-P0.22 ± 0.011.45 ± 0.03*0.32 ± 0.235.5 ± 0.4Ribose-1-P0.14 ± 0.011.93 ± 0.10*0.44 ± 0.015.4 ± 0.1Deoxyribose-1-P0.05 ± 0.001.36 ± 0.03*0.30 ± 0.015.6 ± 0.2Mannose-1-P0.15 ± 0.011.38 ± 0.11*0.79 ± 0.042.1 ± 0.1Glucose-6-P0.08 ± 0.010.77 ± 0.05*0.36 ± 0.022.6 ± 0.1Ribose-5-P0.07 ± 0.000.14 ± 0.01NDaND, not determined.NDaND, not determined.Deoxyribose-5-PNot detectable0.04 ± 0.01NDaND, not determined.NDaND, not determined.Mannose-6-PNot detectableNot detectableNDaND, not determined.NDaND, not determined.a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Identification of Phosphopentomutase as PGM2—Our work demonstrates that phosphopentomutase activity in human and presumably also in other vertebrates is contributed by the protein designated PGM2 in the protein data bases (except in mouse where PGM2 is the orthologue of human PGM1). This conclusion is based on the finding that human erythrocyte phosphopentomutase copurifies with PGM2. Furthermore, recombinant PGM2 displays a higher phosphopentomutase activity than its phosphoglucomutase activity, having therefore properties similar to those of the phosphopentomutase (PGM2) previously characterized in mammalian tissues (20Kammen H.O. Kim R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4888-4893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Accorsi A. Kim E. Piacentini M.P. Gini S. Fazi A. Prep. Biochem. 1989; 19: 251-271PubMed Google Scholar). These findings are at variance with the results of Barksy and Hoffee (4Barsky D.L. Kim P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 743: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), who purified phosphopentomutase from rat liver to near homogeneity and concluded that it was a dimer consisting of two subunits of 32.5 kDa. However, the SDS-PAGE gel shown by these authors indicates that their most purified fractions also contained a faint ≈70-kDa band in addition to the 32.5-kDa band. Our presumption is that the ≈70-kDa band rather than the 32.5-kDa band corresponds to rat phosphopentomutase. Accordingly the rat genome also encodes a PGM2 orthologue sharing 90% sequence identity with human PGM2. Our findings indicate that PGM2 comprises the TASHNP motif common to members of the α-d-phosphohexomutase family, which comprises eukaryotic phosphoglucomutases, bacterial phosphoglucomutases and phosphomannomutases, eukaryotic phosphoacetylglucosaminemutase and bacterial phosphoglucosamine mutase (14Shackelford G.S.

Chem. 2006; 281: 15564-15571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To be active, phosphoglucomutase needs to be phosphorylated on the serine present in the TASHNP motif, and this phosphorylation is achieved by transferring one of the phospho-groups of glucose 1,6-bisphosphate. To catalyze the net conversion of glucose 1-phosphate to glucose 6-phosphate, the phosphorylated enzyme reacts with glucose 1-phosphate, thus re-forming glucose 1,6-bisphosphate. The latter flips inside the catalytic site and rephosphorylates the enzyme by transferring its 1-phospho group, thus forming glucose 6-phosphate. Because of the conservation of the TASHNP motif in PGM2 and of the fact that this enzyme also requires glucose 1,6-bisphosphate as a cofactor, it is likely that the conserved serine also serves as a transient phosphate acceptor. The role of phosphopentomutase is to utilize ribose 1-phosphate and deoxyribose 1-phosphate, which are formed by purine nucleoside phosphorylase and uridine phosphorylase. The molecular identification of phosphopentomutase might help to solve unexplained cases of congenital immunodeficiency. Both adenosine deaminase and nucleoside phosphorylase deficiencies are indeed known to be causes of immunodeficiency (24Giblett E.R. Kim J.E. Cohen F. Pollara B. Meuwissen H.J. Lancet. 1972; 2: 1067-1069Abstract PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar, 25Giblett E.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1985; 451: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The absence of phosphopentomutase should result in the accumulation of ribose 1-phosphate and deoxyribose 1-phosphate and therefore in a functional block of purine nucleoside phosphorylase. Identification of PGM2L1 as Glucose-1,6-bisphosphate Synthase—The presence of a human protein sharing about 60% sequence identity with human PGM2 was very intriguing. Our first hypothesis was that this enzyme was a second form of phosphopentomutase/phosphoglucomutase with slightly different kinetic properties. However, this enzyme proved to have a very low phosphomutase activity on the three tested substrates (glucose 1-phosphate, ribose 1-phosphate, and deoxyribose 1-phosphate). The finding that PGM2L1 is expressed at a high level in brain, its molecular mass of 72 kDa and its (low) phosphomutase activity are all properties that PGM2L1 shares with glucose-1,6-bisphosphate synthase (17Rose I.A. Kim J.V. Kaklij G. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3466-3470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wong L.J. Kim I.A. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1049-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), an enzyme whose molecular identity had not yet been established. That PGM2L1 corresponds to glucose 1,6-bisphosphate synthase is indicated by the fact that recombinant PGM2L1 used 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate as a phosphate donor and a series of sugar-monophosphate as acceptors. As for brain glucose-1,6-bisphosphate synthase (17Rose I.A. Kim J.V. Kaklij G. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3466-3470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Guha S.K. Kim Z.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 250: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), 1-phosphosugars (glucose 1-phosphate, mannose 1-phosphate, ribose 1-phosphate, and deoxyribose 1-phosphate) were good substrates, whereas 5 or 6-phosphosugars (to the exception of glucose 6-phosphate) were not. This broad substrate specificity makes that PGM2L1 is able to synthesize cofactors for various phosphomutases. The fact that PGM2L1 also comprises a potentially phosphorylatable serine in a similar motif as found in PGM1-related enzymes agrees with previous findings indicating that glucose-1,6-bisphosphate synthase is phosphorylated on a serine residue by transfer of the 1-phosphogroup of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (18Wong L.J. Kim I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5431-5439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As previously shown, this reaction is the first step of aldose-bisphosphate synthesis. The second step is the transfer of the phosphate group from the phosphorylated serine onto a suitable sugar-phosphate acceptor (18Wong L.J. Kim I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5431-5439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Morino H. Kim C. Kish P.E. Ueda T. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1049-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). As previously reported by others for the enzyme purified from human erythrocytes (21Accorsi A. Kim E. Piacentini M.P. Gini S. Fazi A. Prep. Biochem. 1989; 19: 251-271PubMed Google Scholar), recombinant PGM2 also displays glucose-1,6-bisphosphate synthase activity. However, as shown in the present study, the synthase activity of PGM2 is lower than that of PGM2L1 and it is more powerfully inhibited by glucose 1,6-bisphosphate. This means that PGM2L1 is more prone to form elevated concentrations of glucose 1,6-bisphosphate than PGM2. This agrees with the finding that the glucose 1,6-bisphosphate concentration is particularly elevated in brain, where values of the order of 75 nmol/g have been reported (27Passonneau J.V. Kim O.H. Schulz D.W. Brown J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 902-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Yip V. Kim M.E. Carter J. Rose I.A. Lowry O.H. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 594-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These concentrations are far above the levels needed to saturate phosphomutases (Ka ≈ 0.1 μm) and it is therefore thought that glucose 1,6-bisphosphate plays another role, possibly a regulatory one. Glucose 1,6-bisphosphate is, at least in vitro, an inhibitor of low Km hexokinases (29Crane R.K. Kim A. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 210: 597-606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Gerber G. Kim H. Heinrich R. Rapoport S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 45: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (31Beitner R. Kim J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 583: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (32Marcus C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2963-2966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a stimulator of phosphofructokinase (33Rose I.A. Kim J.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 59: 1333-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), though a much poorer one than fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (34Van Schaftingen E. Kim M.F. Hue L. Hers H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3483-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and of liver pyruvate kinase (35Koster J.F. Kim R.G. Staal G.E. van Berkel T.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 258: 763-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The idea that glucose 1,6-bisphosphate plays a regulatory role is supported by the finding that brain is also rich in glucose-1,6-bisphosphatase, the enzyme that degrades glucose 1,6-bisphosphate. The activity of this enzyme is nearly dependent on inosine-monophosphate, a nucleotide that accumulates in anoxia (36Guha S.K. Kim Z.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6634-6637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and this effect may at least partly account for the fact that the glucose 1,6-bisphosphate concentration decreases in brain during ischemia. The decrease in the concentration of glucose 1,6-bisphosphate is likely to deinhibit low Km hexokinases and favor glycolysis. A complementary role is presumably played by ribose 1,5-bisphosphate, which is also formed by PGM2L1 and is a potent stimulator of phosphofructokinase (37Ishikawa E. Kim S. Ishikawa T. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18875-18878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of ribose 1,5-bisphosphate was shown to increase in macrophages during hypoxia (38Kawaguchi T. Kim R.L. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28554-28561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The molecular identification of the enzyme that synthesizes glucose 1,6-bisphosphate and ribose 1,5-bisphosphate will facilitate investigations aimed at testing the regulatory role of these molecules in intact cells."

Previously, we showed that asporin can inhibit transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-mediated expression of cartilage matrix genes and chondrogenesis in vitro (Kizawa, H., Kou, I., Iida, A., Sudo, A., Miyamoto, Y., Fukuda, A., Mabuchi, A., Kotani, A., Kawakami, A., Yamamoto, S., Uchida, A., Nakamura, K., Notoya, K., Nakamura, Y., and Ikegawa, S. (2005) Nat. Genet. 37, 138–144). However, details about regulation of asporin itself are not yet known. Here, we examined ASPN expression in skeletal tissue and potential regulation of ASPN by TGF-β. In situ hybridization revealed the presence of ASPN mRNA in the perichondrium/periosteum of long bones, but its absence in articular cartilage and growth plates. Immunohistochemical analysis also showed ASPN protein expression predominantly in the perichondrium/periosteum. TGF-β1 induced endogenous ASPN mRNA expression over time in vitro, and this induction was suppressed by the TGF-β type I receptor kinase inhibitor SB431542. Inhibition of Smad3 significantly reduced TGF-β1-induced ASPN expression, whereas overexpression of Smad3 augmented the induction. Characterization of the human ASPN promoter region revealed a region from -126 to -82 that is sufficient for full promoter activity; however, TGF-β1 failed to increase activity through the ASPN promoter. Our findings indicate that TGF-β1 induces ASPN through Smad3 but that this induction is indirect.

TGF-β signaling is initiated by interaction of the TGF-β ligand with two transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors (types I and II) (6Ebner R. Kim R.H. Shum L. Lawler S. Zioncheck T.F. Lee A.

In this pathway, Smad2 or Smad3 forms heterodimer complexes with Smad4 and then binds directly or via other DNA-binding proteins to TGF-β-responsive promoters, stimulating or repressing gene transcription (9Heldin C.H.

Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). BGN expression is stimulated by TGF-β, whereas DCN expression is repressed. It is thus reasonable to hypothesize that ASPN expression can be influenced by TGF-β. In this study, we demonstrate that ASPN expression is up-regulated by TGF-β1 and that the Smad pathway is crucial for this induction. In addition, the 5′-flanking region between -126 and -82 in the ASPN promoter shows strong basal promoter activity in articular chondrocytes, but no TGF-β-responsive regions reside within ∼1.3 kb of the ASPN promoter region. These results suggest that ASPN expression is induced by TGF-β1 through Smad3 in an indirect manner.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRNA in Situ Hybridization—A mouse asporin cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_025711) spanning nucleotides 187–457 was subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) for generation of sense and antisense RNA probes. RNA probes were prepared using the digoxigenin RNA labeling mixture (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). Paraffin-embedded blocks and sections of C57BL/6 mouse knee joint were obtained from Genostaff (Tokyo, Japan). The mouse knee joint was dissected, fixed with tissue fixative (Genostaff), and then embedded in paraffin using the manufacturer’s proprietary procedures. Tissue sections (4 μm) were dewaxed and hybridized as described (16Hoshino M. Kim M. Fukata M. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Nabeshima Y. Hama C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17837-17844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), with some modifications. We carried out hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes at 60 °C for 16 h. The bound label was detected using BM purple alkaline phosphatase substrate (Roche Applied Science), and the sections were counterstained with Kernechtrot stain solution (Mutoh Chemical Co., Tokyo), dehydrated, and then mounted with malinol (Mutoh Chemical Co.).Immunohistochemistry—Deparaffinized sections were incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 15 min at room temperature to block endogenous peroxidase activity. The sections were washed with Tris-buffered saline, and excess protein was blocked with protein block (code X0909, Dakopatts, Copenhagen, Denmark). Next, the sections were incubated overnight with an anti-ASPN polyclonal antibody (2229-B01) at a concentration of 1 μg IgG/ml at 4 °C. Normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was used as the control primary antibody. After washing, tissues were blocked with the biotin-blocking system (code X0590, Dakopatts), and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (code E0432, Dakopatts). After washing, the sections were exposed to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Nichirei Biosciences, Tokyo, Japan), and signals were detected with dimethylaminoazovenzene/H2O2.Antibody—A polyclonal antibody against mouse ASPN was prepared by immunizing a rabbit with recombinant mature mouse ASPN. Its titer was detected by enzyme-linked immunoassays on microtiter plates. The anti-ASPN antibody (2229-B01) was separated by protein A affinity chromatography. This polyclonal antibody cross-reacts with human ASPN.Cell Lines and Cell Culture—OUMS-27 cells (17Kunisada T. Kim M. Mihara K. Gao C. Kawai A. Inoue H. Namba M. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) were purchased from the Osaka Animal Cell Bank of the Institute for Fermentation (Osaka, Japan) and cultured as described previously (18Kou I.

Normal human articular chondrocyte (NHAC) cells from the knee joint were purchased from Cambrex (East Rutherford, NJ). To obtain monolayer cultures, NHAC cells were maintained in a standard chondrocyte growth medium (Cambrex). Differentiated articular chondrocytes were maintained in three-dimensional cultures using alginate beads (Cambrex) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Unless noted otherwise, we used primary cells following redifferentiation in three-dimensional culture for experiments.Induction of ASPN by TGF-β—NHAC cells were cultured in 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in DMEM/nutrient mixture F-12 containing 10% FBS. When cells reached confluence, the culture medium was replaced with DMEM/nutrient mixture F-12 containing 0.2% FBS. After 12 h, cells were treated with TGF-β (10 ng/ml) (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) for the indicated time periods. The induction of ASPN by TGF-β was also examined in OUMS-27 and HCS-2/8 cells using DMEM instead of DMEM/nutrient mixture F-12.Inhibitor Treatment—SB431542 (a potent and selective inhibitor of ALK4, ALK5, and ALK7) and two macromolecular synthesis inhibitors (cycloheximide (CHX) and actinomycin D) were purchased from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). To examine the effects of SB431542, NHAC cells were cultured in 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in DMEM/nutrient mixture F-12 containing 10% FBS. The culture medium was replaced with DMEM/nutrient mixture F-12 containing 0.2% FBS when cells reached confluence. After 12 h, cells were treated with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) for 24 h in the absence or presence of SB431542 (10 μm). SB431542 was added to cells 1 h prior to treatment with TGF-β1. The effects of SB431542 on TGF-β1-induced ASPN expression in OUMS-27 and HCS-2/8 cells were also examined using DMEM instead of DMEM/nutrient mixture F-12. To examine the effects of CHX and actinomycin D, NHAC cells were treated with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) for 24 h in the absence or presence of CHX (5 and 25 μg/ml) or actinomycin D (1 μg/ml). CHX and actinomycin D were added to cells 0.5 h prior to TGF-β1 treatment. ASPN mRNA levels were quantified using real-time PCR. The expression of SMAD7 and GAPDH was examined as a positive and a negative control, respectively.Transient Transfection—HCS-2/8 cells were cultured for 24 h with DMEM containing 10% FBS in 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. The expression plasmid pCMV6-Smad3 and the empty control vector were purchased from Ori-Gene Technologies (Rockville, MD). Cells were transfected using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus Bio Corp., Madison) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 24 h following transfection, the cells were treated with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) and incubated for another 24 h. Total mRNA from harvested cells was subjected to real-time PCR.Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—Target sequences for Smad2 and Smad3 siRNAs (Smad2, 5′-UCUUUGUGCAGAGCCCCAATT-3′ and 5′-UUGGGGCUCUGCACAAAGATT-3′; and Smad3, 5′-ACCUAUCCCCGAAUCCGAUTT-3′ and 5′-AUCGGAUUCGGGGAUAGGUTT-3′) were selected using the siRNA design support system on the TaKaRa Bio web site. These siRNAs and control scrambled siRNA were purchased from TaKaRa Bio Inc. (Shiga, Japan). HCS-2/8 cells were cultured for 24 h with DMEM containing 10% FBS in 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. Cells were transfected with 25 nm siRNA using TransIT-TKO (Mirus Bio Corp.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) for 24 h, and total mRNA from harvested cells was subjected to real-time PCR.RNA Isolation and Real-time Quantitative PCR Assay—Total RNAs were isolated using the SV total RNA isolation system (Promega Corp.). Equal amounts of total RNA were reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the TaqMan core reagent kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). 2 μl of each reverse transcription reaction was used as a template for SYBR Green real-time PCR (Qiagen Inc., Hilden, Germany). The following primers were used for amplification: ASPN,5′-CTGGGCCTAGGAAACAACAA-3′ and 5′-TTCATCTTTGGCACTGTTGG-3′; and GAPDH,5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. SYBR Green PCR and real-time fluorescence detection were performed using the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system. The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. To adjust for differences in cDNA synthesis, relative values for ASPN mRNA concentration were normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels.Western Blotting—Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in mammalian protein extraction reagent (M-PER, Pierce) with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The proteins in the cell lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The primary antibody to ASPN (2229-B01) was used at 1:1000 dilution, and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare) was used at 1:5000 dilution. The membranes were stripped with a Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) and reprobed with an anti-actin antibody (1:2000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or an anti-GAPDH antibody (1:2000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5000 dilution; Upstate, Temecula, CA).Luciferase Reporter Assay—ASPN-luciferase fusion plasmids were constructed in the promoterless vector pGL3-Basic (Promega Corp.). All ASPN fragments were amplified by PCR using a primer pair containing MluI- or XhoI-cleaved restriction sites at the 5′-ends. The 45-bp (-126 to -82) and 29-bp (-110 to -82) fragments were synthesized as double-stranded oligonucleotides containing MluI-cleaved sites at both ends (Invitrogen). All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. For detection of luciferase activity, HCS-2/8 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in DMEM containing 10% FBS. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 0.2% FBS. After 12 h, cells were transiently transfected using TransIT-LT1 reagent with appropriate ASPN promoter plasmids and incubated for 24 h in the absence or presence of TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml). Luciferase analysis in NHAC cells was performed using DMEM/nutrient mixture F-12 instead of DMEM. In these experiments, the pGL3-Basic vector was used as a negative control and the pRL-SV40 vector (Promega Corp.) as an internal control for normalization. The SBE4-luciferase plasmid (where SBE is Smad-binding element) (20Zawel L. Kim J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol.

Luciferase activity was measured using the PG-DUAL-SP reporter assay system (Toyo Ink Co., Tokyo). All assays were performed at least two times in duplicate.RESULTSExpression of Asporin in Adult Mouse—In previous work, we showed that ASPN expression is increased in articular cartilage from osteoarthritis patients using real-time PCR (3Kizawa H.

To investigate the expression pattern of Aspn in limbs, we performed RNA in situ hybridization using mouse embryos at 15.5 days post-coitus (dpc). At this stage, Aspn mRNA was present around the maxilla, mandible, and vertebrae, consistent with previous findings (2Henry S.P. Kim M. Boyd T.C. Mayne P.M. Eberspaecher H. Zhou W. de Crombrugghe B.

Detailed analysis of the limbs revealed a pronounced signal in the perichondrium/periosteum of the long bones, but not in the epiphysial cartilage (Fig. 1, A and B). Next, we investigated Aspn expression in the knee joints of 8-week postnatal mice. No substantial expression was detected in the articular cartilage and growth plate (Fig. 1, C and D), whereas the adjacent perichondrium showed expression similar to that of the 15.5-dpc embryo (Fig. 1E) (2Henry S.P. Kim M. Boyd T.C. Mayne P.M. Eberspaecher H. Zhou W. de Crombrugghe B. Hook M. Mayne R. J. Biol.

In 15.5-dpc mouse embryos, ASPN staining was seen in fibroblasts surrounding the subcutaneous tissue and vertebrae (Fig. 2, B and C). Weak ASPN staining was also found in fibroblasts surrounding the sphenoid bone and thoracic cavity (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the knee joints of 8-week postnatal mice showed ASPN expression predominantly in the periosteum, fascia, and tendon, with no apparent expression in growth plate cartilage (Fig. 2, D–F).FIGURE 2Immunohistochemical analysis of ASPN protein in embryonic and postnatal mouse limbs. Shown are a 15.5-dpc embryo (A–C) and a 8-week postnatal knee joint (D–F) stained with anti-ASPN polyclonal antibody 2229-B01 (left panels) or with normal rabbit IgG (right panels).

To examine the potential effects of TGF-β on ASPN expression, we first investigated ASPN mRNA levels in response to TGF-β isoforms (β1, β2, and β3). Each isoform similarly induced ASPN expression in all chondrocytic cells examined (Fig. 3). We next examined the temporal profile of ASPN expression in response to TGF-β1, the isoform most abundantly expressed in articular cartilage and NHAC cells. ASPN expression was induced within 3–6 h following TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) stimulation and increased with time up to 24 h. These findings were replicated in HCS-2/8 and OUMS-27 cells (Fig. 4), suggesting that TGF-β1 induction of ASPN is a common feature of chondrocytes. Thus, TGF-β1 positively regulates ASPN in cartilage. However, in TGF-β1-untreated NHAC cells, ASPN expression was induced after 24 h of culture.FIGURE 3TGF-β isoforms similarly induce ASPN mRNA. TGF-β1, -β2, and -β3 (10 ng/ml) induced ASPN expression in NHAC, HCS-2/8, and OUMS-27 cells. When cells reached confluence, the medium containing 10% FBS was replaced with medium containing 0.2% FBS.

This inhibitor completely suppressed TGF-β1-induced ASPN expression in NHAC, HCS-2/8, and OUMS-27 cells (Fig. 5) as a smad7 (data not shown).

To determine whether TGF-β1 activates the Smad pathway in HCS-2/8 cells, we analyzed extracts from cells treated with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) by immunoblotting for phosphorylated and total Smad2 and Smad3. Smad2 and Smad3 were present in both control and TGF-β1-treated cells, and phosphorylation of both proteins increased within 10 min of TGF-β1 treatment (data not shown). These results indicate that HCS-2/8 cells can respond to TGF-β1 through a Smad pathway.To clarify the role of Smad2 and Smad3 in TGF-β1-induced ASPN induction, we investigated the effects of endogenous Smad2 and Smad3 after TGF-β1 stimulation using knockdown experiments. It is interesting that only Smad3 siRNA repressed TGF-β1-induced ASPN expression effectively. Furthermore, simultaneous knockdown of Smad2 and Smad3 produced results similar to those of knockdown of Smad3 alone (Fig. 6, A and B). ASPN expression was again repressed by Smad3 siRNA at the protein level (Fig. 6C), and Smad3 overexpression increased TGF-β1-induced ASPN expression at both the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 7). Taken together, these results indicate that TGF-β1-induced ASPN expression occurs through the Smad pathway and involves Smad3 in particular.FIGURE 6Smad3 knockdown down-regulates TGF-β1-induced ASPN expression in HCS-2/8 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2016008152,"Acute renal failure (ARF) is a major worldwide cause of morbidity and mortality, lacking specific targeted, effective therapies. Renal tubular cell apoptosis has been recognized to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of ARF, yet few studies have evaluated whether intervention in apoptotic pathways can ameliorate the deterioration in renal function associated with ARF. Using transgenic mice with diminished levels of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein, survivin, we show that survivin is required to protect the kidney from apoptosis, to suppress renal expression of p53, and to ameliorate renal dysfunction in two models of ARF. Gene delivery of survivin to wild-type mice and mice with 50% levels of survivin, prior to or at the time of induction of ARF, interferes with the deterioration of renal function and preserves the integrity of the kidneys and the renal tubular cells by inhibiting activation of apoptotic pathways in the kidneys and suppressing expression of p53. These results encourage further evaluation of survivin, its active structural domains, and other inhibitors of apoptosis proteins, for preventing and/or treating acute renal failure."

A number of DNA damage response pathways are activated in a MMR-dependent manner following MNNG, and several also require ATM kinase activity. Here we show that activation of the transcription factor c-Jun is dependent upon both the MMR component MLH1 and ATM, but not ATR, in response to MNNG. In addition to c-Jun, the upstream MAPKs JNK and MKK4 are also activated in a MLH1- and ATM-dependent manner. We document that c-Jun activation is dependent on the MAPK kinase kinase MEKK1. Additionally, the tyrosine kinase c-Abl is required to activate this signaling cascade and forms a complex with MEKK1 and MLH1. This study indicates that an arm of DNA damage-activated MAPK signaling is activated in an MLH1- and ATM-dependent manner in response to MNNG and perhaps suggests that dysregulation of this signaling is responsible, in part, for alkylation tolerance.

DNA damage activates a number of cellular signaling mechanisms that promote DNA repair, halt cell growth, or activate cell death mechanisms. It has been proposed that these damage response mechanisms serve to limit the accumulation of heritable genetic errors thus maintaining genomic homeostasis (1Hartwell L.H. Kim T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (2411) Google Scholar). Unsurprisingly, tumor cells are often defective in one or more of the elements that control such responses, and this contributes to the heightened rates of genomic instability observed in cancer. It is now clear that DNA damage response mechanisms are crucial to limiting the occurrence of somatic mutations, maintaining genomic homeostasis, and limiting cancer development (2Hartwell L. Kim T. Kadyk L. Garvik B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 3Loeb L.A. Kim K.R. Anderson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

MNNG and related alkylators are extremely mutagenic and carcinogenic, and they evoke a strong cell cycle arrest and/or apoptotic response. MNNG alkylates multiple nucleophilic centers within DNA with methylation of the N3 position of adenine and the N7 and O6 positions of guanine being the predominant lesions (4Friedberg E.C. Kim G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 1-58Google Scholar). N3MeA and N7MeG lesions are repaired by base excision repair. However, the cytotoxic and mutagenic properties of MNNG principally stem from the methylation of the O6 position of guanine (5Karran P. Kim M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2933-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 6Stojic L. Kim R. Jiricny J. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Direct repair of mutagenic O6MeG lesions is primarily accomplished by the repair protein methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (7Lindahl T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 61-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Accordingly, lost or diminished methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase activity results in an increased MNNG-induced lesion load thus significantly raising sensitivity to MNNG and related alkylators (8Kalamegham R. Kim S. MacDonald H. Ebisuzaki K. Carcinogenesis. 1988; 9: 1749-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).O6MeG lesions are also recognized by the mismatch repair (MMR) system (9Griffin S.

MMR is an evolutionarily conserved DNA repair mechanism that is chiefly responsible for resolving post-replicative base mispairing in DNA (11Modrich P. Kim R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). In addition to its capacity as a repair mechanism, numerous observations clearly implicate the MMR system as a necessary component in activation of signaling in response to persistent O6MeG lesions (6Stojic L. Kim R. Jiricny J. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Exposure to MNNG and related methylators results in robust establishment of G2 arrest, and MMR-deficient cells are unable to activate either cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in response to these drugs (12Goldmacher V.S.

MAPK pathways operate through sequential phosphorylation events that ultimately phosphorylate/activate transcription factors and thus regulate gene expression in response to various cellular stresses and stimuli. At present, three distinct arms of MAPK signaling have been characterized: extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), p38 MAPKs, and stress-activated protein kinases/Jun-N-terminal kinases (JNKs) (17Kyriakis J.M.

Overall, the contribution of JNK and consequential activation of c-Jun following genome damage remains unclear; however, JNK is reported to be involved in activating apoptosis in certain cells types, namely lymphoid and neuronal cells (23Xia Z.

ATM, which is activated in response to MNNG (26Adamson A.W. Kim W.J. Shangary S. Baskaran R. Brown K.D. J. Biol.

Further, the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl, which is activated in response to exposure to various genotoxins (28Kharbanda S. Kim R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W.

Finally, several groups have documented that activation of c-Abl is ATM-dependent in response to ionizing radiation (34Shafman T. Kim K.K. Kedar P. Spring K. Kozlov S. Yen T. Hobson K. Gatei M.

The results of the present study indicate that c-Jun activation following MNNG exposure is dependent upon ATM and MLH1 as is activation of JNK. Our investigation determined that these defects are attributable to dysregulation of the upstream MAPK signaling cascade, and observations support a role for ATM and MLH1 in the activation of c-Abl in response to MNNG.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Drug Treatment—The SV40-immortalized A-T fibroblast line AT22IJE-T stably expressing full-length recombinant human ATM (designated YZ-5) or stably transfected with empty vector (designated EBS-7) were cultured as previously indicated (36Ziv Y.

MNNG treatments were performed by removing media from cultures of logarithmically growing cells and adding serum-free media. MNNG was then added to the indicated final concentration, and cells were returned to the incubator. After a 1-h drug exposure, plates were rinsed extensively with PBS, and cells were refed on complete growth media and returned to the incubator.The JNK inhibitor anthra[1,9-cd]pyrazol-6(2H)-one 1,9-pyrazoloanthrone (SP600125, Calbiochem) was dissolved in Me2SO to 10 mm as a stock solution and stored at –80 °C. SP600125 was added to cell cultures (10 μm final concentration) 1 h before MNNG treatment. Cells were maintained on SP600125 both during and after MNNG exposure until cells were harvested. STI-571 was obtained from Novartis and prepared as a 10 mm stock solution in Me2SO. Cells were pretreated with 10 μm STI-571 for 24 h before treatment with MNNG and maintained on STI-571 both during and after MNNG exposure.Immunoblotting—Cells were harvested by scraping in ice-cold PBS, and extracts were formed by the addition of lysis buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5/5 mm EDTA/5 mm EGTA/10 mm β-glycerolphosphate/10 mm NaF/10 mm sodium pyrophosphate/1.0% SDS) for 5 min on ice, and then placed in a 95 °C hot block for 5 min. Lysates were then sonicated and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 3 min.Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce), and lysates were stored at –80 °C prior to use. Prior to electrophoresis, an appropriate volume of cell lysate was diluted in 3× SDS sample buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 3% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 0.01% pyronin-Y) and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes overnight at 12 V. After transfer, the membranes were probed with anti-phospho-c-Jun (ser63) II, total c-Jun, phospho-JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185), total JNK, phospho-MKK4 (Ser-257/Thr-261), phospho-MKK7 (Ser-271/Thr-275), or phospho-p53 (Ser-15). These antibodies were all purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Alternatively, blots were probed with anti-MEKK1, c-Abl, MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, or lamin A/C. These antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). ATM was detected using the monoclonal antibody AM-9 (38Allen D.M. Kim H. Ray J. Weaver Z. Winrow C.J. Carter T.A. Braquet R. Harrington E. Ried T. Brown K.D. Gage F.H. Barlow C. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 554-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) or a rabbit polyclonal antiserum obtained from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX). ATR was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum, termed pAb-ATR39, created and characterized in our laboratory as previously described (39Beardsley D.I. Kim W.J. Brown K.D. Mol Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Anti-α-tubulin (DM1A) was a generous gift of Dr. D. W. Cleveland (University of California-San Diego). Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). Immunoreactivity was visualized by chemiluminescence and recorded on x-ray film. Image (version 1.63, National Institutes of Health) was used to quantify immunoblot signals on exposed films.Transfection—A full-length cDNA clone encoding human MLH1 cloned into pBluescript was obtained from Dr. R. Liskay (Oregon Health Sciences University). Subsequently, the MLH1 cDNA was subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1/Hygro (Invitrogen). Following verification by restriction mapping and sequencing, this plasmid, termed pcDNA-MLH1, was used in transfection assays. Prior to transfection, MLH1-deficient HCT-116 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well in 6-well tissue culture plate. The following day, medium was removed and serum-free culture medium (Opti-MEM, Invitrogen) added. To the cells, 4 μgof pcDNA-MLH1 or empty pcDNA3.1/Hygro and 10 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) diluted in 500 μl of Opti-MEM was added to the culture medium, and the mixture was incubated with cells for overnight at 37 °C. After transfection, cells were harvested and seeded into 6-well plates. Three days post-transfection, cells were treated with 10 μm MNNG for 1 h and harvested 4 h after drug for analysis.RNA Interference—RNAi was carried out with a modified version of a procedure described previously by our laboratory (39Beardsley D.I. Kim W.J. Brown K.D. Mol Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Synthetic siRNA duplexes specific for human ATM, ATR, c-Abl, MEKK1, and non-targeting control siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). For siRNA transfection, cells were seeded into a 6-well tissue culture plate at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells per well 24 h prior to transfection. Prior to transfection, medium was removed and 2 ml of complete growth medium (without antibiotics) was added to each well. Subsequently, 250 μl of transfection mix containing 5 μlof 20 μm siRNA stock and 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) diluted in Opti-MEM was added to each well. Following an overnight incubation at 37 °C, cells were split at a 1:4 ratio into multiple wells of a 6-well tissue culture plate, and allowed to attach overnight. The following day, the cells were transfected a second time as outlined above. 24 h after the second transfection cells were washed, re-fed on complete growth medium, and treated with the indicated concentration of MNNG for 1 h. Subsequently, cells were harvested at the indicated time point and processed for immunoblot analysis.Immunoprecipitation—Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, after which the supernatant was removed, 2 μg of mouse monoclonal anti-c-Abl (Calbiochem) or 2 μg of purified mouse IgG (Sigma) was added, and reactions were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rocking. Following this, an equal volume of protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) suspended in PBS was added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rocking. Finally, the agarose beads were washed four times in lysis buffer and resuspended in 3× SDS sample buffer. After boiling, the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting.In other experiments, cells were fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions prior as previously described (40Cong F. Kim H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2882-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Briefly, HCT116+ch3 cells were either mock treated or exposed to 10 μm MNNG and harvested 4 h post-treatment. Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5/10 mm NaCl/1 mm KH2PO4/5 mm NaHCO3/1 mm CaCal2/0.5 mm MgCl2) and placed on ice for 5 min. Cells were subsequently homogenized by 12 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, and cell lysis was verified by trypan blue staining. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and the nuclear pellet was removed. The supernatant was re-centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C to generate the cytosolic fraction. The nuclear pellet was washed twice in PBS and resuspended in nuclear isolation buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5/300 mm sucrose/0.1% Nonidet P-40). The pellet was subsequently homogenized 20 times using a Dounce homogenizer and harvested by centrifugation. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis or immunoprecipitation using MLH1 or MSH2 rabbit polyclonal antisera obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.RESULTSPhosphorylation of the Transcription Factor c-Jun in Response to MNNG Is ATM- and MLH1-dependent—Based on observations made using MNNG and other genotoxins, we hypothesized that MAPK signaling triggered in response to MNNG was potentially dependent upon a functional MMR system. To address this hypothesis we examined activation-linked phosphorylation of c-Jun using matched MLH1-proficient/deficient colorectal tumor lines. MLH1-deficient HCT116 and MLH1-proficient HCT116+ch3 were either mock treated (buffer only) or treated with a range of MNNG concentrations from 1.0 to 50 μm. 4 h post-drug, cells were harvested, and extracts were formed and subsequently immunoblotted with an antibody specific for phospho-ser63 c-Jun, because phosphorylation of this residue is linked to activation of this transcription factor (41Franklin C.C. Kim V. Wagner F. Woodgett J.R. Kraft A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7247-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). When extracts from MNNG-treated HCT116 were probed with anti-phospho-ser63 c-Jun we observed negligible levels of phosphorylation of this molecule in both mock treated and cells treated with all drug concentrations tested at the 4-h time point (Fig. 1A, top). In contrast, when the MLH1-proficient HCT116+ch3 cell line was treated with MNNG we observed a dose-dependent increase in ser63-phosphorylated c-Jun (Fig. 1A, bottom). Specifically, we measured an increase of ∼2-fold in phosphorylated c-Jun in HCT116+ch3 cells treated with 10 and 20 μm MNNG and an increase of ∼4-fold in cells treated with 50 μm MNNG.To confirm that the defect in c-Jun phosphorylation observed in HCT116 was directly attributable to MLH1 deficiency, we transfected HCT116 with either empty pcDNA3.1/hygro expression plasmid, or plasmid containing a full-length copy of the human MLH1 cDNA (pcDNA-MLH1). Transient transfection of this cell line with pcDNA-MLH1 results in robust expression of MLH1 24 h post-transfection (Fig. 1B). Next, HCT116 cells were transfected with either empty vector or pcDNA-MLH1, cells treated with 10 μm MNNG 24 h post-transfection, and harvested 4 h after drug treatment. Immunoblot analysis of mock treated cells or MNNG-treated cells transfected with empty vector or pcDNA-MLH1 with phospho-specific c-Jun indicated that HCT116 cells transfected with pcDNA-MLH1 displayed a clear increase in MNNG-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun (Fig. 1C). In contrast, cells transfected with empty vector did not display increased phosphorylation of this molecule in response to MNNG.ATM is a critical DNA damage-response kinase, and our group has shown this molecule is catalytically activated in response to MNNG (26Adamson A.W. Kim W.J. Shangary S. Baskaran R. Brown K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38222-38229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To examine a potential role for ATM in activation of c-Jun in response to MNNG, we utilized the isogenic ATM-proficient/deficient human fibroblast lines YZ-5 and EBS-7. These lines were derived from the A-T cell line AT22IJE-T, which has been stably transfected with a plasmid encoding full-length human ATM cDNA (YZ-5) or empty vector (EBS-7) (36Ziv Y. Kim A. Pecker I. Russell P. Jorgensen T.J. Tsarfati I. Shiloh Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Using anti-ser63 c-Jun we observed elevated basal levels of phosphorylated c-Jun in EBS-7 cells, and this level did not increase in response to MNNG doses tested (Fig. 2A, top). Untreated YZ-5 cells do not display a basal level of phosphorylated c-Jun present in EBS-7; however, this ATM-proficient line did show a dose-dependent increase in phosphorylated c-Jun in response to MNNG (Fig. 2A, bottom).FIGURE 2ATM, but not ATR, is required for c-Jun phosphorylation in response to MNNG. A, ATM-deficient EBS-7 (top) ATM-proficient YZ-5 (bottom) human fibroblasts were either mock treated (lanes 1) or treated with MNNG doses ranging from 1.0 to 50 μm (lanes 2–6). 4 h post drug cells were harvested, and lysates were formed and immunoblotted with phospho-ser63 c-Jun or anti-total c-Jun as indicated. B, YZ-5 cells were transfected with either control or ATM-specific siRNA and following transfection cells were harvested an immunoblotted with anti-ATM or anti-tubulin (top). Mock transfected YZ-5 cells (lane 1), or cells transfected with either control (lane 2) or ATM-specific (lane 3) siRNA were treated or mock treated with 5 μm MNNG 24 h post-transfection as indicated. 4 h post-drug cells were harvested, and following this, lysates were formed and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-ser63 c-Jun or anti-total c-Jun (bottom). C, HCT116+ch3 cells were transfected with either control or ATM-specific siRNA and extracts immunoblotted with anti-ATM or anti-tubulin (top). HCT116+ch3 transfected with control siRNA (lanes 1 and 2), or cells transfected with ATM-specific siRNA (lanes 3 and 4) were mock treated (lanes 1 and 3) or treated with 10 μm MNNG (lanes 2 and 4) 24 h post-transfection. 4 h post-drug cells were harvested, and following this, lysates were formed and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-ser63 c-Jun or anti-total c-Jun as indicated. D, YZ-5 cells were transfected with either control or ATR-specific siRNA and immunoblotted with anti-ATR or anti-tubulin (top). YZ-5 transfected with control siRNA (lanes 1 and 2), or cells transfected with ATR-specific siRNA (lanes 3 and 4) were mock treated (lanes 1 and 3) or treated with 5 μm MNNG (lanes 2 and 4) 24 h post-transfection. 4 h post-drug cells were harvested, and following this, lysates were formed and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-ser63 c-Jun or anti-total c-Jun (bottom). E, HCT116+ch3 cells were transfected with either control or ATR-specific siRNA and immunoblotted with anti-ATR or anti-tubulin (top). HCT116+ch3 cells transfected with control siRNA (lanes 1 and 2) or ATM-specific siRNA (lanes 3 and 4) were mock treated (lanes 1 and 3) or treated with 10 μm MNNG (lanes 2 and 4) 24 h post-transfection. 4 h post-drug cells were harvested, and following this, lysates were formed and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-ser63 c-Jun or anti-total c-Jun (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that the up-regulation of phosphorylated c-Jun observed in YZ-5 cells following MNNG exposure was directly attributable to ATM activity we used RNAi. Transfection of YZ-5 cells with ATM-specific siRNA forced an approximate 2-fold decrease in ATM expression in this cell line when compared with cells transfected with nonspecific control siRNA (Fig. 2B, top). Following transfection with either control or ATM siRNAs, cells were treated with 5 μm MNNG for 1 h. 4 h post-drug, cells were harvested, and extracts were immunoblotted with phospho-Ser-63 c-Jun antibody. We observed increased levels of phosphorylated c-Jun in MNNG-treated cells transfected with control siRNA, whereas YZ-5 cells transfected with ATM-specific siRNA showed a minimal (1.3-fold) increase in c-Jun phosphorylation in response to MNNG (Fig. 2B, bottom).When parallel RNAi experiments were performed on HCT116+ch3 cells, we observed a 2.4-fold decrease in ATM expression in this cell line (Fig. 2C, top). Similar to results obtained in YZ-5 cells, we found that reduced ATM expression in HCT116+ch3 cells resulted in diminished c-Jun phosphorylation in response to 10 μm MNNG (Fig. 2C, bottom). Based on these results, we conclude that MLH1 and ATM are required to induce rapid phosphorylation of c-Jun in response to MNNG-induced alkylation. We have also examined MNNG-induced phosphorylation of ATF-2 that, like c-Jun, is a member of the AP-1 (activating protein-1) family of transcription factors. Our investigation demonstrated that, in parallel to c-Jun, ATF-2 is also activated in an ATM- and MLH1-dependent manner in response to MNNG (supplemental Fig. S1).ATM and the structurally related protein ATR are both DNA damage-responsive kinases that share significant overlap in their substrate specificities (42Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar, 43Shiloh Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1979287801,"Ribosomes have a characteristic protuberance termed the stalk, which is indispensable for ribosomal function. The ribosomal stalk has long been believed to be a pentameric protein complex composed of two sets of protein dimers, L12-L12, bound to a single anchor protein, although ribosomes carrying three L12 dimers were recently discovered in a few thermophilic bacteria. Here we have characterized the stalk complex from Pyrococcus horikoshii, a thermophilic species of Archaea. This complex is known to be composed of proteins homologous to eukaryotic counterparts rather than bacterial ones. In truncation experiments of the C-terminal regions of the anchor protein Ph-P0, we surprisingly observed three Ph-L12 dimers bound to the C-terminal half of Ph-P0, and the binding site for the third dimer was unique to the archaeal homologs. The stoichiometry of the heptameric complex Ph-P0(Ph-L12)2(Ph-L12)2(Ph-L12)2 was confirmed by mass spectrometry of the intact complex. In functional tests, ribosomes carrying a single Ph-L12 dimer had significant activity, but the addition of the second and third dimers increased the activity. A bioinformatics analysis revealed the evidence that ribosomes from all archaeal and also from many bacterial organisms may contain a heptameric complex at the stalk, whereas eukaryotic ribosomes seem to contain exclusively a pentameric stalk complex, thus modifying our view of the stalk structure significantly.

This pentameric P0·P1-P2 stalk complex can be substituted for E. coli L10·L7/L12 complex in the 50 S subunit and makes the ribosome accessible to eukaryotic elongation factors (33Uchiumi T. Honma S.

In a recent study, we reconstituted the functional stalk complex of the archaeal species Pyrococcus horikoshii from the recombinant constituents archaeal P0 from P. horikoshii (Ph-P0) 3The abbreviations used are: Ph-P0, ribosomal protein P0 from P. horikoshii; Ph-L12, ribosomal protein L12 from P. horikoshii; eEF-1α, eukaryotic elongation factor 1α; eEF-2, eukaryotic elongation factor 2; eL12, ribosomal protein L12 from B. mori (equivalent to E. coli L11); WT, wild type. and Ph-L12 (34Nomura T.

It is interesting that the archaeal stalk complex has the ability to make the E. coli ribosome accessible to eukaryotic elongation factors at levels comparable with the eukaryotic stalk complex (34Nomura T.

This result suggests that the functional structures of the stalk complexes are highly conserved between Eukarya and Archaea, although there is a marked difference between them in terms of dimers, i.e. eukaryotic heterodimers and archaeal homodimers. Here, we characterized the P. horikoshii stalk complex and unexpectedly identified the third binding site of the stalk dimer in the expanded region within the archaeal P0. We investigated the functional effects of removing one or two stalk dimers on ribosome function. We also performed sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses and showed the presence of an expanded homologous sequence in all known species of Archaea, implying that archaeal ribosomes may generally contain three stalk dimers. Preparation of P. horikoshii Ribosomal Proteins—The plasmid construction for P. horikoshii proteins Ph-P0, Ph-L12, and silkworm Bm eL12 (a eukaryotic homologue of bacterial L11) was performed, and their expression and purification were performed as described previously (31Hagiya A.

Each DNA fragment was cloned into an E. coli expression vector, pET28 (Novagen), and the resultant plasmid was used for transformation of E. coli strain BL21 to express the proteins. Truncations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The C-terminal truncation mutants expressed in E. coli cells were purified using the same procedure as used for the WT Ph-P0, as described previously (34Nomura T. Nakano K. Maki Y. Naganuma T.

The P. horikoshii 23 S rRNA fragment containing residues 1155-1224 (corresponding to residues 1043-1112 of E. coli 23 S rRNA) was synthesized in vitro using template DNA and T7 RNA polymerase (34Nomura T.

Binding of Ph-P0·Ph-L12 complex to the rRNA fragment and its analysis by gel electrophoresis were performed as described previously (34Nomura T. Nakano K. Maki Y. Naganuma T. Nakashima T. Tanaka I.

Ribosomal 50 S Core and Hybrid 50 S Particles—The E. coli ribosomal 50 S core deficient in L10·L7/L12 and L11 was prepared by extraction of the 50 S subunits from the L11-deficient E. coli mutant AM68 (35Dabbs E.R.

The P. horikoshii-E. coli hybrid 50 S particle was formed by mixing the E. coli 50 S core with the P. horikoshii ribosomal proteins (34Nomura T. Nakano K. Maki Y. Naganuma T. Nakashima T. Tanaka I.

A, E. coli 50 S core particles (2.5 pmol) were preincubated without any stalk complex (column 1) or with 20 pmol of the complexes as follows. Column 2, WT-P0·Ph-L12; column 3, CΔ79·Ph-L12; column 4, CΔ89·Ph-L12; column 5, CΔ105·Ph-L12; column 6, CΔ114·Ph-L12; column 7, CΔ131·Ph-L12. Then particles were assayed for eukaryotic eEF-2-dependent GTPase activity in the presence of silkworm eL12 and E. coli 30 S subunits.

The mean values of the three functional assays were shown in both A and B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Quantitative Analysis of Ph-L12 Incorporated into the Ribosome—Isolated Ph-L12 (68 μg) was incubated with 500 units of casein kinase II (New England Biolabs) and [32P]ATP for 120 min at 30 °C in a solution containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The 32P-labeled Ph-L12 was mixed with non-labeled Ph-L12 (215 μg). The specific radioactivity of the resultant sample was 42 cpm/pmol of protein. This labeled protein was added to the non-labeled Ph-P0 (or truncation mutants), and the complex was reconstituted as described above. For the E. coli 50 S core (30 pmol), excess amounts of the protein sample including 60 pmol of Ph-P0 was added, together with 60 pmol of eL12. The sample was then layered onto a 10-28% sucrose gradient in a solution containing 50 mm NH4Cl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and fractionated after centrifugation at 40,000 rpm at 4 °C for 3 h in a Hitachi P-45 ST rotor. The 50 S fraction was collected, and the amount of the associated 32P-labeled Ph-L12 was estimated by radioactivity. Mass Spectrometry—The intact complex (1 μg/μl) was buffer-exchanged into 300 mm ammonium acetate (pH 7.6) using micro BioSpin 6 columns (Bio-Rad), and 2-μl aliquots were introduced into the mass spectrometer via gold-coated nanoflow capillaries prepared in-house. Mass spectra were recorded on a QSTAR XL mass spectrometer (MDS Sciex) modified for high mass detection (37Sobott F. Hernández H. McCammon M.G. Tito M.A. Robinson C.V. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), and the conditions within the mass spectrometer were adjusted to preserve non-covalent interactions (38McKay A.R. Ruotolo B.T. Ilag L.L. Robinson C.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 11433-11442Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic Elongation Factors and the Functional Assays—Eukaryotic eEF-1α and eEF-2 were isolated from pig liver, as described by Iwasaki and Kaziro (39Iwasaki K. Kaziro Y. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 657-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The activity of the hybrid ribosome with respect to eEF-2-dependent GTPase activity and eEF-1α- and eEF-2-dependent polyphenylalanine synthesis was assayed as described previously (34Nomura T.

Kobayashi Y. Hachimori A. Uchiumi T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2620-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), except that the reaction mixture for the polymerization assay contained 5 pmol of the hybrid 50 S subunit and 25 pmol of the E. coli 30 S subunit, and the reaction was performed 7 min at 37 °C using Phe-specific tRNA. Phylogenetic Analysis of Eukaryotic and Archaeal P0 and Bacterial L10—The amino acid sequences of P0 from 11 species of Eukarya and 10 species of Archaea as well as the sequences of L10 from 28 species of bacteria were aligned using clustalW followed by manual inspection. The alignment is shown in supplemental Fig. S5. One hundred and three unambiguously aligned sites were selected from the alignment and the data set was subjected to phylogenetic analysis using the program package PHYLIP3.6a. The maximum likelihood method of protein phylogeny in the PROML program was used for searching the best tree, assuming the JTT +Γ model with input sequence order randomized three times and global rearrangements. Maximum likelihood bootstrap analyses (100 replications) were carried out using PROML with the same settings. Bootstrap analyses based on the maximum parsimony method and the neighbor joining method with the maximum likelihood (JTT +Γ) distance were also completed (1000 replications) using the programs PROTPARS and NEIGHBOR. The sequence alignment shown in Fig. 1A is the selected data from Homo sapiens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bombyx mori, and 10 species of Archaea. In a previous study of the silkworm stalk complex (31Hagiya A. Naganuma T. Maki Y. Ohta J. Tohkairin Y. Shimizu T. Nomura T. Hachimori A. Uchiumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39193-39199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we showed that 1) truncation of the C-terminal 55 amino acid residues of P0 (CΔ55) still gives a structure with two P1-P2 stalk dimers; 2) truncation of the C-terminal 65 (CΔ65) and 81 (CΔ81) residues produces a structure that can only bind one P1-P2 dimer; and 3) truncation of the C-terminal 107 residues (CΔ107) does not allow any stalk binding activity (Fig. 1A). From these results, we concluded that the region encompassing residues 210-261 in silkworm P0 participates in the binding of two stalk dimers. The amino acid sequence of this region is conserved in eukaryotic and even in archaeal homologues (Fig. 1A). In Ph-P0, this conserved region corresponds to residues 212-263. It is noticeable that Ph-P0 contains a short inserted sequence, namely residues 272-287 preceding the hydrophilic C-terminal region. This extra sequence is also detected in other archaeal homologues. To investigate whether the 212-263 region of Ph-P0 is responsible for binding of the two stalk Ph-L12 homodimers in a similar manner to the eukaryotic counterparts and whether the inserted short sequence of archaeal P0 participates in the stalk binding, we tested the effects of a series of truncations of the C-terminal half of Ph-P0 (Fig. 1A). Five truncated mutants of Ph-P0 (CΔ79, CΔ89, CΔ105, CΔ114, and CΔ131), together with Ph-L12, were expressed in E. coli cells, purified (Fig. 1B), and used in the following binding experiments. By adding excess amounts of Ph-L12 to individual Ph-P0 variants, the Ph-P0·Ph-L12 stalk complexes were reconstituted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The formation of the complexes was analyzed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2A). The complexes were observed as shifted bands of free Ph-L12 (lane 1) by mixing with WT Ph-P0 (lane 2), CΔ79 (lane 3), CΔ89 (lane 4), CΔ105 (lane 5), and CΔ114 (lane 6) but not with CΔ131 (lane 7). Because 1) all Ph-P0 samples without Ph-L12 were not observed as clear bands (supplemental Fig. S1) and 2) the shifted bands contained Ph-P0, together with Ph-L12, detected by SDS gel electrophoresis (supplemental Fig. S2) and immunoblotting, 4J. Ohta and T. Uchiumi, manuscript in preparation. it is highly likely that the Ph-P0·Ph-L12 stalk complexes formed appear as shifted bands. Each reconstituted sample was tested for rRNA binding by a gel mobility shift assay using a small amount of the 32P-labeled RNA fragment covering the 1070 region (Fig. 2B). Strong RNA binding was observed for all samples. A clear single shifted band in each sample indicates the homogeneity of each complex formed. Moreover, the reconstituted stalk complexes were confirmed to bind to E. coli 50 S core particle deficient in the cognate stalk complex L10·L7/L12 and L11 (supplemental Fig. S3). All these data suggest that binding sites for Ph-L12 stalk dimers lie in the C-terminal 131 amino acids including an inserted 272-287 residues in the Ph-P0 sequence. To investigate the copy number of Ph-L12 bound to WT Ph-P0 and its truncated variants, Ph-L12 was labeled with 32P by casein kinase II as described under “Experimental Procedures” and used for reconstitution of the stalk complexes. Each Ph-P0 sample (100 pmol each) was mixed with an 8-fold higher amount of 32P-labeled Ph-L12 and reconstituted. The complex formation with each Ph-P0 sample was confirmed by the same native gel as shown in Fig. 2 (see also supplemental Fig. S4). The excess amount of each reconstituted complex was added to a given amount of E. coli 50 S core, which was completely deficient in L10·L7/L12. By sucrose gradient centrifugation, the hybrid particle composed of E. coli 50 S core and the archaeal stalk complex was collected. The labeled Ph-L12 protein included was quantified by measurement of the specific radioactivity of 32P-Ph-L12 (42 cpm/pmol protein), and the value was related to the amounts of 50 S particles estimated by A260 (Fig. 3). In the stalk complex with WT Ph-P0 (Fig. 3A), 5.8 pmol of Ph-L12 were incorporated per 50 S particle (Fig. 3E). In the complex samples with CΔ79 (Fig. 3B) and CΔ105 (Fig. 3C), 4.1 and 2.0 pmol of Ph-L12 were present in the 50 S particles, respectively (Fig. 3E). No incorporation of Ph-L12 into the 50 S particle with CΔ131 was observed (Fig. 3D). Since Ph-L12 tightly forms a homodimer (34Nomura T. Nakano K. Maki Y. Naganuma T. Nakashima T. Tanaka I. Kimura M. Hachimori AkiraA. Uchiumi T. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), it is highly likely that WT Ph-P0, CΔ79, CΔ105, and CΔ131 bind 3, 2, 1, and 0 Ph-L12 dimers, respectively. The results clearly show that the extra sequence present in Ph-P0 is involved in binding of one of three stalk dimers. The stoichiometry of the WT complex was confirmed by mass spectrometry of the intact protein complex. The charge states series 21+ to 25+ at m/z 4000-5000 enable the mass of the complex to be measured as 106,611 ± 39 Da (Fig. 4). This value is consistent with the heptameric complex with three copies of L12 dimer (calculated mass 106,094 Da). In a previous study, we observed that the P. horikoshii stalk complex incorporated into E. coli 50 S core functions more efficiently with eukaryotic elongation factors than with the archaeal factors at 37 °C (34Nomura T. Nakano K. Maki Y. Naganuma T. Nakashima T. Tanaka I. Kimura M. Hachimori AkiraA. Uchiumi T. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Here we used this hybrid system to investigate the functional role of the three Ph-L12 dimers. The ribosome carrying the CΔ105 mutant that bound a single Ph-L12 dimer showed significant GTPase (Fig. 5A) and polyphenylalanine synthetic activities (Fig. 5B). Both the activities corresponded to ∼70% of that of the ribosome carrying WT Ph-P0 that could bind three Ph-L12 dimers. The activity of the ribosome with CΔ79 that could bind two Ph-L12 dimers was 90-95% of the ribosome carrying WT Ph-P0. The activity of two dimer-ribosome is higher than that of the one-dimer ribosome and slightly lower than the WT Ph-P0-carrying ribosome. To understand how many species have the third binding site for the ribosomal stalk dimer, we compared amino acid sequences of P0-type proteins from 11 Eukarya and 10 Archaea and L10-type proteins from 28 bacteria. The extra sequence observed in Ph-P0 as the third binding site of the stalk dimers exists in all archaeal sequences (Fig. 1A) but not in eukaryotic P0 (supplemental Fig. S5). In bacteria, however, almost a half of known sequences were found to contain the extra sequences in their C-terminal regions. This leads to a suggestion that most of the archaeal ribosomes and many of the bacterial ribosomes contain three stalk dimers, whereas eukaryotic ribosomes contain two. The present study demonstrates that three stalk dimers bind side by side to the C-terminal half of the anchor protein Ph-P0 at the ribosomal GTPase-associated center in the archaeal species P. horikoshii. The amino acid sequence alignment for the stalk binding sites of P0-like proteins indicates that the region for binding of two stalk dimers are conserved from Archaea to Eukarya (supplemental Fig. S5). The region for the third stalk dimer in the C-terminal region includes an extended sequence, which is present and conserved in all known Archaea but not in Eukarya. The present evidence, together with previous data from the eukaryotic stalk complex (31Hagiya A. Naganuma T. Maki Y. Ohta J. Tohkairin Y. Shimizu T. Nomura T. Hachimori A. Uchiumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39193-39199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), implies that archaeal ribosomes may generally contain three stalk dimers and that eukaryotic ribosomes may contain two. This is consistent with a hypothesis based on sequence comparison data by Shimmin et al. (41Shimmin L.C. Ramirez C. Matheson A.T. Dennis P.P. J. Mol. Evol. 1989; 29: 448-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) that predicts the presence of three modules in archaeal P0-like proteins, which may participate in interaction with stalk dimers. In contrast, the present results are inconsistent with cross-linking data with Sulfolobus solfatarius ribosomes (42Casiano C. Traut R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21578-21583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that suggested a pentameric structure containing two stalk dimers. Further extensive studies with various archaeal species will be required to fully understand the situation. In the case of bacteria, heptameric protein complexes composed of L10 and three dimers of L7/L12 have recently been detected in ribosomes from three thermophiles, namely Thermus thermophilus, Thermatoga maritima, and Thermus aquaticus (22Ilag L.L. Videler H. McKay A.R. Sobott F. Fucini P. Nierhaus K.H. Robinson C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8192-8197Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 23Diaconu M. Kothe U. Schlünzen F. Fischer N. Harms J.M. Tonevitsky A.G. Stark H. Rodnina M.V. Wahl M.C. Cell. 2005; 121: 991-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). We have recently confirmed that one of the three dimers is removed from the reconstituted stalk complex by truncation of the short extended sequence observed in the C-terminal region of L10 in T. thermophilus. 5T. Nomura, M. Nakatsuchi, and T. Uchiumi, manuscript in preparation. It is therefore highly likely that the extended sequence in L10 from these three bacteria corresponds to the third binding site for the L7/L12 dimer. Since the homologous sequence for this extended segment is observed in about half of bacterial species (supplemental Fig. S5), many species in bacteria may posses ribosomes with three stalk dimers. Using the alignment data containing 49 sequences (11 Eukarya, 10 Archaea, and 28 bacteria), we performed phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 6). In this figure, the species having the extra sequences in the C-terminal region are shown in bold. All examined P0 proteins from Archaea contain expanded sequences. Such expanded sequence is missing in all the eukaryotic homologues examined, as explained above. All the thermophilic species were found to have the inserted sequences, but it is noticeable that the expanded sequences are also observed in species other than thermophiles, e.g. Rickettsia prowazekii in bacteria and Haloarcula marismortui in Archaea. Bacterial inserted sequences were found in some independent branches, showing that the deletion of the sequences occurred in each branch independently. These considerations of bacterial as well as archaeal stalk dimers lead to a hypothesis that the ribosome in a common ancestor cell might have had three stalk dimers. There is an important question to be addressed. That is, what is the functional difference between the two and three stalk dimers in the ribosome? Considering the recent cryo-electron microscopy evidence that the C-terminal domain of the stalk directly interacts with prokaryotic elongation factor G (EF-G) (3Datta P.P. Sharma M.R. Qi L. Frank J. Agrawal R.K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 723-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), higher efficiency of translation elongation may be expected with the three stalk dimers. We tested this point by deletion of the third stalk dimer from the stalk complex derived using the C-terminal truncation mutants of Ph-P0. We assayed the functions by using a hybrid ribosome system, which we recently developed (32Krokowski D. Boguszewska A. Abramczyk D. Liljas A. Tchórzewski M. Grankowski N. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 386-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 34Nomura T. Nakano K. Maki Y. Naganuma T. Nakashima T. Tanaka I. Kimura M. Hachimori AkiraA. Uchiumi T. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, the results showed only a slight effect of deletion of the third stalk dimer in the C-terminal region on factor accessibility (Fig. 5). This indicates that the third stalk dimer in Archaea does not play an essential functional role at low temperature. This stalk dimer may play its role at very high temperature such as that around the optimum growing conditions of P. horikoshii (95 °C). It is also conceivable that the three-stalk complex results in additional interactions not only between stalk dimer and Ph-P0 but also between the neighboring stalk dimers on Ph-P0. These cooperative interactions might increase efficiency in assembly of the stalk complex and its stability in extremely unusual conditions. The present study indicates that factor accessibility of both the archaeal heptameric stalk complex containing three Ph-L12 dimers and its variant pentameric complex containing two Ph-L12 dimers is comparable. Moreover, the accessibility of the archaeal stalk complex to eukaryotic elongation factors is similar to that of the eukaryotic stalk complex containing two P1-P2 heterodimers, at least at 37 °C (34Nomura T. Nakano K. Maki Y. Naganuma T. Nakashima T. Tanaka I. Kimura M. Hachimori AkiraA. Uchiumi T. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the pentameric complex form of Ph-P0(Ph-L12)2(Ph-L12)2 and the intact heptameric form of Ph-P0(Ph-L12)2(Ph-L12)2(Ph-L12)2 bear a striking similarity to the eukaryotic P0(P1-P2)(P1-P2) complex in both structure and function. The two stalk dimers seem to work sufficiently well with respect to functional interaction with eukaryotic elongation factors and the coupled events under normal conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2093240545,"CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCTα) is a proteolytically sensitive enzyme essential for production of phosphatidylcholine, the major phospholipid of animal cell membranes. The molecular signals that govern CCTα protein stability are unknown. An NH2-terminal PEST sequence within CCTα did not serve as a degradation signal for the proteinase, calpain. Calmodulin (CaM) stabilized CCTα from calpain proteolysis. Adenoviral gene transfer of CaM in cells protected CCTα, whereas CaM small interfering RNA accentuated CCTα degradation by calpains. CaM bound CCTα as revealed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and two-hybrid analysis. Mapping and site-directed mutagenesis of CCTα uncovered a motif (LQERVDKVK) harboring a vital recognition site, Gln243, whereby CaM directly binds to the enzyme. Mutagenesis of CCTα Gln243 not only resulted in loss of CaM binding but also led to complete calpain resistance in vitro and in vivo. Thus, calpains and CaM both access CCTα using a structurally similar molecular signature that profoundly affects CCTα levels. These data suggest that CaM, by antagonizing calpain, serves as a novel binding partner for CCTα that stabilizes the enzyme under proinflammatory stress.

In eukaryotes, the enzyme CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) catalyzes the pivotal step for PtdCho synthesis (1Kent C. Prog. Lipid Res. 1990; 29: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). CCT is both rate-limiting and rate-regulatory for PtdCho synthesis, and its deficiency is linked to apoptosis, impaired cell growth, and embryonic lethality (2Post M. Batenburg J.J. Smith B.T.

Chem. 2005; 280: 853-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The primary structure of the dominant species, CCTα, consists of 367 amino acids with four functional domains: an NH2-terminal nuclear localization signal, a catalytic core (C), a membrane-binding domain containing a hydrophobic α-helix (M), and a carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation domain (P). CCTα activity is regulated by activating and inhibitory lipids, by reversible phosphorylation, and at the level of mRNA (5Jackowski S. Fagone P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 853-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 6Sugimoto H. Okamura K. Sugimoto S. Satou M. Hattori T. Vance D.E. Izumi T. J. Biol.

CCTα protein turnover might be a physiologically important control mechanism, since the enzyme is degraded by calcium-activated neutral proteinases (calpains) and death effector caspases (7Zhou J.

Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 2314-2324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Calpain severs CCTα at the amino terminus and within the catalytic domain-membrane binding domain boundary (7Zhou J. Ryan A.J. Medh J. Mallampalli R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37032-37040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Calpains exist in cells as two major isoforms, depending on calcium requirements: M-calpain and μ-calpain. Each isoform consists of two distinct subunits, a larger 80-kDa catalytic subunit and a smaller 30-kDa regulatory subunit, forming a heterodimeric structure. The large and small subunits consist of four (I–IV) and two (I-II) domains, respectively (10Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). EF-hand motifs within each subunit allow for heterodomain interactions and calcium binding. Calpain cleaves its substrates, in part, by docking to two major motifs within its substrates: PEST (proline-glutamate-serine-threonine) sequences and calmodulin (CaM) binding domains. PEST sequences within IkBα and the ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 serve as proteolytic signatures for calpain degradation (11Han Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R.K. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 12Wang N. Chen W.G. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Likewise, CaM binding domains within a calcium-ATPase pump and inducible nitric-oxide synthase impact their sensitivity to calpain hydrolysis (13Padanyi R. Paszty K. Penheiter A.R. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Enyedi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35798-35804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14Walker G. Pfeilschifter J. Otten U. Kunz D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1568: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A “calmodulin-like” domain also exists within the catalytic subunit of calpain that facilitates interaction with some PEST sequences or CaM binding motifs (15Shumway S.D. Maki M. Miyamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30874-30881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 16Molinari M. Anagli J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2032-2035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Indeed, data base analysis (available on the World Wide Web) identified a consensus PEST sequence within the CCTα NH2-terminal domain. Thus, this PEST sequence or other structural motifs that recognize CaM might brand CCTα for its elimination within cells. Despite being a calpain substrate, CCTα is a relatively stabile enzyme. CCTα is highly abundant in cells, is cytosolic in pneumocytes, and has an extended half-life (17Ridsdale R. Tseu I. Wang J. Post M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49148-49155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Typically, larger, hydrophobic, cytosolic proteins and regulatory enzymes exhibit faster turnover rates (18Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: C141-C152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The half-life of CCTα (∼8 h) also exceeds that of other metabolic enzymes, including hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (19Hargrove J.L. Schmidt F.H. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2360-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). These observations strongly suggest existence of covalent modifications, stabilizing ligands, or binding partners that enhance the life span of CCTα in vivo. CaM (16.7 kDa) is a highly conserved calcium-sensing protein that binds and modulates stability of some cytoskeletal and ion transport proteins (20Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 21Brandt N.R. Caswell A.H. Brandt T. Brew K. Mellgren R.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 127: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Johnson G.V. Greenwood J.A. Costello A.C. Troncoso J.C. Neurochem. Res. 1991; 16: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). CaM binds proteins in its calcium-bound (holo-CaM) or calcium-free form (apo-CaM). CaM binding proteins are thus classified into Ca2+-dependent, Ca2+-independent, and Ca2+-inhibited proteins (20Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Many CaM binding proteins harbor recognition motifs characterized by a basic amphipathic helix, moderate to high helical hydrophobic moment, and a net positive charge (20Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Other motifs described include an IQ motif ((I/L)QXXXRGXXXR), a 1-8-14, and a 1-5-10 CaM binding motif (20Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Although CaM protects some substrates from proteolysis, the molecular basis for these observations has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the hypothesis that specific molecular sequence signatures confer stability to CCTα. We show for the first time that CCTα is a CaM-binding enzyme and that CaM protects CCTα from calpain degradation. A conceptually unique finding of this study is that a highly conserved residue (Gln243) (rather than an NH2-terminal PEST sequence) serves as an essential molecular recognition site for competition between CaM and calpain for access to CCTα. Mutagenesis of Gln243 within CCTα totally blocked CaM binding but also the ability of calpain to degrade CCTα in vitro and in vivo. The intermolecular competition between a proteinase and a stabilizing protein for access to a single recognition site within CCTα represents a novel mechanism regulating an enzymeŉs availability.

Coffeen L.A. Shea M.A. Squier T.C. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2001; 40: 9605-9617Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All DNA sequencing was performed by the University of Iowa DNA core facility. Construction of CCTα PEST Mutants—A CCTα variant harboring point mutations in the PEST domain (CCTPESTSDM) was constructed where Thr25 and Ser32 were mutated to Ala using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. A full-length CCTα template (pCMV-CCTFL) plasmid DNA was used as a template. The primers used to mutate Thr25 were 5′-GCCCTAATGGAGCAGCAGAGGAAGATGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCATCTTCCTCTGCTGCTCCATTAGGGC-3′ (reverse). The primers used to mutate Ser32 were 5′-GAAGATGGAATTCCTGCCAAAGTGCAGCGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCGCTGCACTTTGGCAGGAATTCCATCTTC-3′ (reverse). PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min and then denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, elongation at 68 °C for 6 min, 18 cycles for three steps. An internal deletion mutant lacking the PEST sequence (CCTPESTSOE) was constructed using splicing by overlapping extension PCR. Full-length CCTα cloned into TOPO4 (TOPO-CCTFL plasmid) was used as a template. Four primers, CCTPEST1 to -4, were designed (CCTPEST1, 5′-CACCATGGATGCACAGAGTTCAGC3′; CCTPEST2, 5′-ACTGCACAGCGCTGCACTTTCCTCCTCTTCCTTGAATTGACTTTA-3′; CCTPEST3, 5′-TAAAGTCAATTCAAGGAAGAGGAGGAAAGTGCAGCGCTGTGCAGT-3′; CCTPEST4, 5′-TCAGTCCTCTTCATCCTCGCTG-3′). In the first step, primers CCTPEST1 and CCTPEST2 were used to amplify an NH2-terminal fragment of CCTα. In the second step, primers CCTPEST3 and CCTPEST4 were used to amplify a COOH-terminal CCTα fragment. Each fragment flanked the PEST. In the last step, the two gel-purified fragments from the steps above were used as a template in the final PCR using primers CCTPEST1 and CCTPEST4 to amplify a desired 1050-bp product lacking the PEST. This fragment was purified and cloned into pPCR4-TOPO. The PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 30 s and 18 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 68 °C for 5 min. After DNA sequence confirmation, TOPO-CCTPESTSOE was used as the template using the primers 5′-AAGCTTATGGATGCACAGAGTTCAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCGAGGTCCTCTTCATCCTCGCTG-3′ (reverse) to amplify the 1050-bp CCTα fragment. The forward primer contains a recognition site for HindIII, the reverse primer contains a recognition site for XhoI. The PCR product was cloned into pPCR4-TOPO, followed by digestion with the same enzymes prior to directional cloning into pcDNA3.1/V5-his. Construction of Glutathione S-Transferase (GST)-tagged CCTα Domain and Carboxyl-terminal Mutants—A series of internal CCTα domain deletion mutants were constructed using TOPO-CCTMEM and TOPO-CCTCAT, TOPO-CCTPEST that were first generated as described previously or by using splicing by overlapping extension PCR (23Agassandian M.

These constructs were used as a template in PCR to generate GST-CCTMEM and GST-CCTCAT, two constructs devoid of the membrane binding domain or catalytic domain, respectively. The forward primer, 5′-CACCATGGATGCACAGAGTTCAGCT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GTCCTCTTCATCCTCGCTGA-3′, were used in the PCR conditions as follows: 95 °C for 30 s and 25 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min. The PCR products were gel-purified and cloned into pENTR-TOPO. A series of carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants were constructed as follows. pCMV5-CCT was used as a template for PCR using the forward primer 5′-CACCATGGATGCACAGAGTTCAGCT-3′ in combination with one of the following reverse primers: 5′-ACTGATGGCCTGGAGCAT-3′ for CCT315, 5′-ACTTCCAATGAACTCTCGGG-3′ for CCT288, 5′-CACTTTCTGCACAAATTCTTTTGA-3′ for CCT267, 5′-TTGCAAGTGGTATTTCTTTTCGT-3′ for CCT243, 5′-GACAATGCGGGTGATGATGT-3′ for CCT210, 5′-TGACTTTTCCTCCACATCTTTCA-3′ for CCT260, and 5′-CCTTACCTTATCAACTCGTTCTTGC-3′ for CCT250. An NH2-terminal CCTα deletion mutant (CCTN40) was constructed using the forward primer 5′-CACCTTACGGCAGCCAGCTCCT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GTCCTCTTCATCCTCGCTGA-3′. The PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 30 s and 25 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min. All PCR products were gelpurified and cloned into pENTR-TOPO. Finally, for cloning into GST fusion constructs, 150 ng of pENTR-TOPO plasmids and 150 ng of pDEST27 GST destination vector were incubated with LR Clonase enzyme mix at 25 °C for 1 h per the manufacturers' instructions. The reactions were terminated by adding 1 μl of proteinase K solution and heated at 37 °C for 10 min. The plasmids were transformed into E. coli TOP10 competent cells, followed by plasmid preparation. A CCTα variant harboring a point mutation (CCTQ243A) where Gln243 was mutated to Ala was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. GST-CCTFL plasmid was used as a template for PCR using forward primer 5′-GAAAAGAAATACCACTTGGCAGAACGAGTTGATAAGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCTTATCAACTCGTTCTGCCAAGTGGTATTTCTTTTC-3′. The thermal cycling program was as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min and then denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, elongation at 68 °C for 10 min, 18 cycles for three steps. The desired PCR product was gel-purified and fused to GST as above. A CCTα carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant harboring a similar point mutation (CCT267Q243A) was generated by PCR using GST-CCT267 as the template using methods described above. All of the above PCR products in pENTR-TOPO were verified by DNA sequencing. In Vitro TNT—CCTα cDNA constructs cloned into pCR4-TOPO4 (2 μg of plasmid/reaction) were added directly to the rabbit reticulocyte lysate, incubated in 50 μl of reaction solution containing 2 μg of plasmids, 25 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 2.5 μl of RNase inhibitor, 1.2 μl of 1 mm amino acids (minus methionine), 2 μl of T7 RNA polymerase, and 5 μl of [35S]methionine (40 μCi/reaction). The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 90 min as described (23Agassandian M. Zhou J. Tephly L.A. Ryan A.J. Carter A.B. Mallampalli R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21577-21587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Calpain Proteolysis Assay—A 25-μl reaction volume containing 10 μl of TNT reaction products, 10 μl of calpain buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Tween 20, and 0.015% Triton X-100), and 0.25–1 μg of purified μ-calpain was incubated at 37 °C for 0–1 h after adding CaCl2 to a final concentration of 200 μm. The reaction was terminated by adding 2× SDS protein loading buffer and heating to 95 °C for 5 min. Effects of calpain hydrolysis of CCTα were further tested in separate studies by inclusion of varying concentrations of CCTα, CaM, or the calpain substrate, LLVY, in the reaction mixture. In these studies, calpain was present at a fixed concentration of 0.6 pmol/reaction. The digestion products were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and gels were processed for autoradiography or immunoblotting. In other experiments, purified recombinant GST-CCTα and GST-CCTα mutants were used as substrates for calpain (0.005–0.05 μg) digestion. Cell Culture—MLE cells were cultured in Dulbeccoŉs minimum essential medium containing 0% fetal bovine serum for up to 48 h with or without Ox-LDL (100 μg/ml). Cell lysates were prepared by brief sonication in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 1.0 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.025% sodium azide, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Buffer A) at 4 °C prior to analysis. Cytosolic and microsomal preparations were isolated as described (25Mallampalli R.K. Ryan A.J. Salome R.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol.

Lipoprotein Oxidation—Lipoproteins were dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 24 h followed by oxidation in 5 μm CuSO4/phosphate-buffered saline for 24 h at 37 °C. Confirmation of lipoprotein oxidization was by the malonaldehyde assay and by detection of apoprotein B-100 degradation as described (7Zhou J. Ryan A.J. Medh J. Mallampalli R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37032-37040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). CCT Activity—Enzyme activity was determined by measuring the rate of incorporation of [methyl-14C]phosphocholine into CDP-choline using a charcoal extraction method (7Zhou J. Ryan A.J. Medh J. Mallampalli R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37032-37040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Assays were conducted with and without exogenous PtdCho/oleic acid lipid activator in the reaction mixtures. PtdCho Analysis—Cells were pulsed-labeled with 1 μCi of [methyl-3H]choline chloride during the final 3 h of incubation, lipids were extracted and resolved, and activity within PtdCho was analyzed as described (7Zhou J. Ryan A.J. Medh J. Mallampalli R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37032-37040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—Equal amounts of total protein (5–20 μg) in sample buffer were resolved using 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoreactive CCTα or calmodulin was detected as described (23Agassandian M.

The dilution factor for primary and secondary antibodies was 1:2000. CCTα was purified to homogeneity as described (26Weinhold P.A. Rounsifer M.E. Feldman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5104-5110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation—200 μg of total protein from MLE cell lysates were precleared with 20 μl of Trueblot anti-Ig beads for 1 h at 4 °C. 5 μg of CCTα, ERK, CaM, rabbit IgG, or calmodulin kinase II antibodies were added for a 2-h incubation at 4 °C. 20 μl of Trueblot anti-Ig beads were added for an additional 2-h incubation. Beads were spun down and washed five times using 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm leupeptin, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (radioimmune precipitation) buffer as described (23Agassandian M.

Beads were heated at 100 °C for 5 min with 80 μl of protein sample buffer prior to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Expression and Knockdown of Recombinant Proteins—CCTα PEST mutants were expressed in cells using the Amaxa nucleofector system per the manufacturers' instructions. Cellular expression of green fluorescent tagged plasmids using this device was achieved at >90% in MLE cells. Transfection of GST-CCTα fusion constructs was also conducted for 24 h in Dulbeccoŉs minimum essential medium/F-12 medium containing 0% fetal bovine serum using 18 μl of FuGene6 reagent and 6–10 μg/dish of the desired plasmid. After 24 h, the cells were harvested in Buffer A followed by brief sonication. In some studies, 24 h after transfection, 100 μg/ml Ox-LDL was added for an additional 24 h. For overexpression of CaM, 1 × 106 cells were infected with Adv-CaM or an empty vector (Adv-Con) at MOI = 40 for 6 h prior to an additional 24-h incubation with Ox-LDL. For CaM knockdown, 1 × 106 cells were electroporated with 1 nmol of siRNA. Cells were either transfected with siRNA (sense sequence, 5′-UGACAAACCUUGGAGAGAAUU-3′; antisense sequence, 5′-PUUCUCUCCAAGGUUUGUCAUU-3′) against CaM or with a control siRNA. 72 h after transfection, cells were exposed to Ox-LDL for an additional 24 h prior to harvest. In rescue studies, cells were either transfected with CaM siRNA or control siRNA; 48 h after transfection, cells were infected with Adv-CaM for another 24 h. Finally, Ox-LDL was added to the medium for an additional 24 h prior to harvest. CCTα Degradation—CCTα degradation was determined by nucleofecting CaM siRNA or control siRNA in MLE cells as above, and 72 h later, cells were preincubated for 1 h in methionine-deficient medium and then pulsed with [35S]methionine (60 μCi/ml) for 4 h at 37 °Cas described (25Mallampalli R.K. Ryan A.J. Salome R.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9699-9708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed, chased in medium replete with methionine and cysteine for 0–8 h, and processed for CCTα immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography as described (7Zhou J. Ryan A.J. Medh J. Mallampalli R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37032-37040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). GST Pull-down Assays—After plasmid transfection, cellular lysates were prepared as described above, followed by incubation with 20 μl of immobilized glutathione-agarose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. After incubation, the beads were spun down and rinsed three times using buffer containing 250 mm NaCl and 0.2% Nonidet P-40. Beads were heated at 100 °C for 5 min with 80 μl of protein sample buffer for subsequent immunoblotting. For purification of recombinant GST-CCTα, 100 μl of immobilized glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with cell lysates (prepared from two 100-mm dishes) at 4 °C for 4 h. After incubation, beads were washed as described above. Recombinant GST-CCTα proteins were eluted using a 5 mm glutathione Buffer A solution, followed by concentration using YM-30 spin columns. Calmodulin-Sepharose Binding Assay—20 μl of CaM-Sepharose beads were incubated with cell lysates (30 μg) or purified rat liver CCTα (1–2 μg) with or without calcium at 4 °C for 2 h. After incubation, beads were spun down and washed three times using buffer containing 300 mm NaCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Beads were heated at 100 °C for 5 min with 40 μl of protein sample buffer. Released products were resolved using SDS-PAGE prior to immunoblotting. Mammalian Two-hybrid Binding Assay—CCTα was PCR-amplified using GST-CCTα as a template and cloned into the pM vector (Clontech) that expresses the CCTα-Gal4BD fusion protein. CaM was also PCR-amplified using the Adv-CaM plasmid and cloned into a pVP16 Gal4AD vector that expresses a CaM-Gal4AD fusion protein. After sequence confirmation, CCTα-Gal4BD, CaM-Gal4AD, and pG5CAT reporter vector were co-electroporated into cells per the manufacturers' instructions. 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed and assayed for β-galactosidase activities. pM-53 and pVP16-T plasmids served as positive controls. pM3-VP16 and pVP16-CP plasmids served as negative controls. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Analysis—PCR-based strategies were used to create compatible restriction enzyme sites that would allow construction of chimeric cDNAs for FRET. A 1050-bp CCTα fragment was amplified in PCR using the primers 5′-ACAAGATCTATGGATGCACAGAGTTCAGCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACTGTCGACTTAGTCCTCTTCATCCTCGCTG-3′ (reverse) using pCMV5-CCT as a template. The forward primer contains a recognition site for BglII, and the reverse primer contains a recognition site for SalI. The PCR product was gel-purified and digested with the same enzymes prior to cloning into pAmCyan-C1 (Clontech), generating CFP-CCTα. An Adv-CaM vector (below) was used as template in PCR using the primers 5′-ACTAGATCTATGGCTGATCAGCTGACCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACTGTCGACTCATTTTGCAGTCATCATCTGTAC-3′ (reverse) to amplify a 450-bp CaM fragment. The forward primer contains a recognition site for BglII, and the reverse primer contains a recognition site for SalI. This PCR product was gel-purified and digested with BglII and SalI prior to cloning into a linearized pZsYellow1-C1 vector (Clontech), generating YFP-CaM. For analysis of CCTα and CaM interaction by FRET, cells were first plated at 0.12 × 106 cells/well in a two-chamber cover glass system. Cells were co-transfected with YFP-CaM and CFP-CCTα (2 μg of plasmid/chamber) with Fugene 6 (6 μl). CaM-CCTα interaction was detected at the single cell level using a combination laser-scanning microscope system (LSM510/ConfoCor2; Zeiss, Jena, Germany). To achieve excitation, the 458-nm line of an argon ion laser was focused through the Zeiss ×60 oil differential interference contrast objective lens onto the cell. Emissions of YFP (the FRET acceptor) and CFP were collected through 535–595-nm and 470–500-nm barrier filters, respectively. Photobleaching was performed with 50 iterations and 100% intensity of a 514-nm laser. FRET quantitation of fluorescence images were generated using Zeiss"

https://openalex.org/W2095491557,"Most aspects of cellular events are regulated by a series of protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation processes. Abi (Abl interactor protein) functions as a substrate adaptor protein for Abl and a core member of the WAVE complex, relaying signals from Rac to Arp2/3 complex and regulating actin dynamics. It is known that the recruitment of Abi into the lamella promotes polymerization of actin, although how it does this is unclear. In this study, we found PTP61F, a Drosophila homolog of mammalian PTP1B, can reverse the Abl phosphorylation of Abi and colocalizes with Abi in Drosophila S2 cells. Abi can be translocalized from the cytosol to the cell membrane by either increasing Abl or reducing endogenous PTP61F. This reciprocal regulation of Abi phosphorylation is also involved in modulating Abi protein level, which is thought to affect the stability of the WAVE complex. Using mass spectrometry, we identified several important tyrosine phosphorylation sites in Abi. We compared the translocalization and protein half-life of wild type (wt) and phosphomutant Abi and their abilities to restore the lamellipodia structure of the Abi-reduced cells. We found the phosphomutant to have reduced ability to translocalize and to have a protein half-life shorter than that of wt Abi. We also found that although the wt Abi could fully restore the lamellipodia structure, the phosphomutant could not. Together, these findings suggest that the reciprocal regulation of Abi phosphorylation by Abl and PTP61F may regulate the localization and stability of Abi and may regulate the formation of lamella."

Plk3 regulates cell fate through regulating cell cycle progression. UV irradiation is one of the major environmental stresses that affect corneal epithelial wound healing. In the present study, we report that UV irradiation activated Plk3 and that Plk3 interacts with AP-1 and c-Jun, which appears to be important to mediate corneal epithelial cell apoptosis after UV irradiation. Recombinant Plk3, as well as Plk3 immunoprecipitated from UV-irradiated cells, phosphorylated c-Jun in vitro. The phosphorylation of c-Jun by Plk3 immunoprecipitates was not altered by the pre-removal of JNK from the cell lysates. In addition, the effect of UV irradiation-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun and apoptosis were not significantly affected by knockdown of JNK mRNA. Co-immunoprecipitation reveals that Plk3 and c-Jun directly interacted with each other. Consistently, Plk3 co-localized with c-Jun to the nucleus after UV irradiation. Further, modulating Plk3 activities by overexpressing Plk3 or its mutants significantly affected UV irradiation-induced c-Jun activity and subsequent apoptosis. Our results thus provide for the first time that Plk3 mediates UV irradiation-induced c-Jun activation by phosphorylating c-Jun, suggesting that Plk3 plays an important role in mediating programmed cell death of corneal epithelial cells after UV irradiation.

UV irradiation is one of the environment stresses that affect various cell types, including those of the corneal epithelial origin. UV irradiation-induced cellular responses share common signaling mechanisms with those induced by cytokine and other stresses, eventually modulating the programmed cell death (1Lu L. Prog. Retin Eye Res. 2006; 25: 515-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Several signaling components, including Ras-Raf, Src, and caspases, have been identified in response to UV irradiation. More importantly, exposure of mammalian cells to UV irradiation causes regulatory responses of various genes, including activation of transcription factors, AP-1 and NF-κB (2Herrlich P. Kim H.

In addition, recent studies indicate that the stimulation of K+ channel activity causes the rapid loss of intracellular K+, which results in the activation of JNK and caspase cascades (11Lu L. Kim L.

In corneal epithelial cells, JNK1 activation is observed within 5–15 min after UV exposure, resulting in apoptosis. We have characterized the intermediary role mediated by the JNK kinase SEK, JNK, and p38 signaling pathways in this response in corneal epithelial cells (11Lu L. Kim L. Shell B. Invest. Ophthalmol.

Sci. 2004; 45: 1796-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we have found that the activation of NFκB by tumor necrosis factor-α affects cell survival in UV irradiation-induced corneal epithelial cells. Tumor necrosis factor-α induces NFκB nuclear translocation and increases the DNA binding activity of NFκB, but it does not elicit the activation of the JNK signaling pathway. The effect of increased NFκB activity in UV irradiation-induced corneal epithelial cell apoptosis is probably due to an increase in DNA repair. This study thus suggests a variation in stress-induced signaling processes in corneal epithelial cells. Polo-like kinases 3 (Plk3) is a multifunctional protein and involves stress-induced signaling pathways in fibroblasts, lymphoblastoids, and lung carcinoma cells (17Bahassi el M. Kim C.W. Myer D.L.

Plk3 is rapidly phosphorylated in response to various stresses, including ionizing radiation, reactive oxygen species, and methylmethane sulfonate. Plk3 is predominantly localized around the nuclear membrane and involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression (20Ouyang B. Kim H. Lu L. Li J. Stambrook P. Li B. Dai W. J. Biol.

During mitosis, Plk3 appears to be localized to mitotic apparatuses such as spindle poles and mitotic spindles (29Dai W. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 214-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Expression of a constitutively active Plk3 results in rapid cell shrinkage, frequently leading to the formation of cells with an elongated, unsevered midbody. Intriguingly, ectopic expression of both constitutively active Plk3 and kinase-defective Plk3K52R mutant induce apparent G2/M arrest followed by apoptosis (21Conn C.W. Kim R.F. Dai W. Sanchez Y.

Plk3 and c-Jun proteins were co-localized in the nucleus in the UV irradiation-stimulated corneal epithelial cells. Plk3 stimulated by UV irradiation directly phosphorylated c-Jun, resulting in apoptosis. Our study thus shows that Plk3 plays an important role in stress-induced c-Jun activation, in addition to its effect on the activation of the JNK signaling pathway. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 (1:1) culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 μg/ml insulin in an incubator supplied with 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The medium was replaced every 2 days, and cells were subcultured by treatment of cells with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA. Transfection of JNK1-specfic siRNA (Qiagen, catalog no. SI02758637) was done by following an instruction manual provided by Qiagen. Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 105 per 35-mm dish in 1 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 medium. A transfection mixture was made by adding JNK1-specific siRNA (a final concentration of 25 nm) and 12 μl of HiPerFect (Qiagen, catalog no. 301705) in 100 μl of culture medium without serum. Transfection complexes in the mixture were formed after 10 min incubation at 22 °C. The mixture was evenly dropped into cultured cells. Transfected cells were cultured in the normal growth condition for 48 h before performing experiments. Control cells were transfected with the non-silencing siRNA in the same way as described above. For UV-irradiation experiments, confluent corneal epithelial cells were placed in a tissue culture hood at a distance of 60 cm from the UV-C light source and exposed at an intensity of 45 μJ/cm2. Cell Death Detections—An MTT assay was performed following an established protocol in our laboratory (24Li T. Kim L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12988-12995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, a colorimetric assay system was used to measure the reduction of a tetrazolium component (MTT) into an insoluble formazan product by the mitochondria of viable cells. The culture medium was replaced with 1 ml of serum free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 (1:1) medium, 100 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) was added into each wells, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h in a moisturized CO2 incubator. Acidic isopropanol (0.4 ml of 0.04 m HCl in absolute isopropanol) was added to solubilize the colored crystals. All samples were placed into an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Beckman DU-600, Spectrophotometer) at a wavelength of 570 nm with a background subtraction at 650 nm. Caspase 3 activity was determined by using the CaspACE™ assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). This system provides a highly sensitive and quantitative measurement of caspase-3 (DEVDase) activity. DNA fragmentation experiments were performed to detect apoptosis, lysis buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml proteinase K) was added, and cells were then incubated for 4 h at 55 °C. The nuclear lysates were extracted twice with an equal volume of phenol and then extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25/24/1, v/v). DNA was precipitated with 0.05 volume of 5 m NaCl and 2.5 volumes of absolute ethanol, incubated overnight at -20 °C, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The DNA pellet was dried and dissolved in TE buffer containing 20 μg/ml RNase A, and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The DNA was extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. DNA samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels and visualized by staining with 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Immunocytochemistry Experiments—For Western analysis, corneal epithelial cells (2 × 105) were lysed in SDS-polyacrylamide sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% w/v bromphenol blue or phenol red. After denaturing, cell lysates were size-fractionated in 12% PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. They were exposed to blocking buffer containing 5% nonfat milk in TBS-0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at 22 °C, and then incubated with the primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was applied in TBS-T buffer for 1 h at 22 °C. Western blots were developed by an ECL Plus System (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and visualized by exposure of x-ray films. For immunostaining experiments, corneal epithelial cells were grown on glass slides and treated as indicated in the figures. The cells were permeated and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline-Tween 20 overnight. Slides were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate/Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse/rabbit IgG antibody. Immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out using corresponding antibodies for Plk3 (BD Pharmingen (25Ouyang B. Kim W. Pan H. Meadows J. Hoffmann I. Dai W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6029-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)) and c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Corneal epithelial cells (5 × 107) were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and followed by incubation in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) on ice for 30 min. The cell lysates were spun at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and incubated with corresponding antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The immunocomplexes were recovered by incubation with 50 μl of 10% protein A-Sepharose kinase assay buffer (expanded and stocked at 0.1 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5.) by conversion. Plk3 kinase assays were carried out by incubation of immunocomplex with casein or glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun fusion protein in 30 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 25 mm glycerophosphate, 100 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [32P]ATP) for 30 min at room temperature. Equal volumes of samples were placed onto 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by exposure on x-ray films. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear proteins were extracted by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 20 min. The consensus oligonucleotide for AP-1 transcription factor (5′-CGCTTCATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′) was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by using T4 polynucleotide kinase. DNA probes were used to hybridize with extracted nuclear proteins. Reactions were conducted by adding 1 pm γ-32P-labeled DNA probe into each sample. DNA-protein complexes were displayed by electrophoresis on a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. For the supershift assay, DNA-protein complexes were further incubated with a specific antibody against c-Jun. Specific competition experiments were performed by using unlabeled oligonucleotide to compete with the labeled oligonucleotide for AP-1. Nonspecific competition experiments were performed by using unlabeled AP1 oligonucleotides to interact with the γ-32P-labeled AP-1 oligonucleotides. Statistical Analysis—For Western analysis, signals in the films were scanned digitally, and the optical densities were quantified with Image Calculator software. Data were shown as fractions of original values in MTT assay or relative optical density for Western blot experiments as mean ± S.E. Significant differences between the control group and treated groups were determined by one-way analysis of variance and Student’s t test at p < 0.05. UV-induced Activation of Plk3 and AP-1—Plk3 is a multifunctional protein and involved in stress-induced signaling pathways. Early studies indicate that Plk3 is activated by various stresses, including reactive oxygen species and DNA-damaging drugs. We examined the role of Plk3 in UV irradiation-elicited stress responses by analyzing the activation of AP-1 in corneal epithelial cells. Human corneal epithelial cells were exposed to UV irradiation (42 μJ/cm2). Total Plk3 protein was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody and casein was used as an in vitro substrate for Plk3 kinase assays (Fig. 1A). Immunocomplex kinase assays revealed a marked increase in Plk3 activity shortly (15–60 min) following UV irradiation. Plk3 immunoprecipitated from H2O2-treated HCE cells served as the positive control. The role of Plk3 in UV irradiation-induced AP-1 activation was studied by transfecting HCE cells with cDNA encoding full-length Plk3. UV irradiation-induced AP-1 activation, detected with an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, showed remarkably increased AP-1 activities in HCE cells exposed to UV irradiation and in cells transfected with wild-type Plk3 (Fig. 1B). The effect of Plk3 on AP-1 activation was further confirmed by transfecting HCE cells with a constitutively active Plk3-PBD (pEGFP-Plk3-PBD) and an inactive Plk3-WV (pEGFP-Plk3-WV) as the control. AP-1 activity was found highly activated in pEGFP-Plk3-PBD-transfected HCE cells in the presence and absence of UV stimulation (Fig. 1B). The specificity of UV irradiation-induced AP-1 binding was competed and inhibited by nuclear unlabeled AP1 oligonucleotides in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. In addition, UV irradiation-induced c-Jun activity was identified by the supershift assay using anti-c-Jun antibodies. These studies suggest that Plk3 may be involved in UV-induced signaling pathways and, more specifically, that Plk3 may participate in activating c-Jun in the AP-1 complex. Effect of UV-induced Plk3 Activity on c-Jun Phosphorylation—UV irradiation-induced activation of AP-1 involves several transcription factors, including c-fos and c-Jun. In HCE cells, UV irradiation-induced c-Jun phosphorylation was determined by using site-specific phospho-antibodies to c-Jun. UV irradiation-activated c-Jun involves phosphorylation of two serine residues (Ser-63 and Ser-73, Fig. 2A). The effect of Plk3 activation on c-Jun phosphorylation after UV irradiation was determined by the immunocomplex kinase assay. In the experiment, expressions of total c-Jun and β-actin were detected as the controls. Plk3 was immunoprecipitated from UV irradiation-induced HCE cells using the antibody to Plk3; c-Jun fusion protein was used as a substrate in the assays (Fig. 2, B and C). Consistent with our prediction, Plk3 was able to effectively phosphorylate c-Jun 15 min after UV irradiation, and this phosphorylation activity lasted up to 60 min after UV treatment (Fig. 2C). As an alternative approach to confirm the phosphorylation of c-Jun by Plk3, the purified protein of constitutively activated Plk3 (Plk3a) was incubated with equal amounts of hypophosphorylated c-Jun fusion protein (2 μg per sample) in the kinase reaction mixture containing [γ-32P]ATP. There was a marked increase in c-Jun phosphorylation, as determined by fractional display in a PAGE gel, which was concentration-dependent (Fig. 2D). The specific effect of UV irradiation-induced Plk3 activation on c-Jun phosphorylation was further studied by a two-step immunoprecipitation process followed by immunocomplex kinase assays. First, the effect of UV irradiation-induced JNK-1 activation on c-Jun in HCE cells was analyzed by immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assays using c-Jun fusion protein as substrate. Second, Plk3 was further immunoprecipitated from the cell extracts in that JNK-1 protein had been depleted during the first immunoprecipitation. The precipitated Plk3 from the extracts was used to determine the effect of Plk3 activity after UV irradiation on phosphorylation of c-Jun fusion protein in immunocomplex kinase assays (Fig. 3A). The results indicate that UV stress activated Plk3, resulting in c-Jun protein phosphorylation in the absence of JNK activity. To further determining the effect of Plk3 activity on c-Jun phosphorylation, constitutively active and kinase-deficient Plk3 mutants were overexpressed in HCE cells, respectively. In the other group of experiments, HCE cells were transfected with wild-type Plk3 (Plk3wild), kinase-deficient mutant Plk3 (Plk3K52R), or the vector DNA. UV irradiation-induced Plk3 activation was determined by the immunocomplex kinase assay. There was an increased Plk3 activity in Plk3wild-transfected cells. In contrast, UV irradiation could not induce additional Plk3 activities from cells transfected with kinase-deficient Plk3 (Plk3K52R) or from cells that were transfected with the vector DNA only (Fig. 3B). Further experiments were done in JNK1 mRNA knockdown HCE cells using JNK1-specific siRNA. Knockdown of JNK1 mRNA minimized JNK1 expression. Interestingly, UV irradiation failed to induce JNK1 phosphorylation, whereas UV irradiation was still able to induce strong phosphorylation of c-Jun in these cells (Fig. 3C). This experiment separated the effects of UV irradiation-induced JNK and Plk3 on c-Jun phosphorylation. Experimental results from studying Plk3 mutants and knockdown of JNK1 mRNA provide further evidence that Plk3 activity is regulated by UV stress in addition to the JNK effect and that c-Jun may be one of important downstream targets of Plk3.FIGURE 3Effect of UV irradiation-induced Plk3 activity on c-Jun phosphorylation. A, effect of Plk3 purified from UV-induced and JNK removed HCE cells on c-Jun phosphorylation. UV irradiation-induced HCE cells were collected and immunoprecipitated with JNK-protein A-agarose to remove JNK protein. The supernatants precleared of JNK kinase were subjected to second immunoprecipitation with the specific antibody against Plk3. JUN and Plk3 Immunoprecipitates were used in immunocomplex kinase assay, respectively. The c-Jun fusion protein was used as the substrate in in vitro kinase assays. B, effect of overexpression of Plk3 (Plk3wild) and kinase-deficient Plk3 mutant (Plk3K52R) on UV irradiation-induced c-Jun phosphorylation. Expression levels of Plk3 and phospho-c-Jun in Plk3 and its mutant transfected HCE cells were detected by Western blot analysis using the anti-Plk3 and the anti-phospho-c-Jun antibodies. C, effect of suppressing JNK1 on UV irradiation-induced c-Jun phosphorylation. JNK1 mRNA was knocked down by using JNK1-specific siRNA. Phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun were detected by antibodies against phospho-JNK and phospho-c-Jun, respectively. Total JNK and c-Jun expressions were detected by Western analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) UV Irradiation-induced Interaction of Plk3 with c-Jun—Phosphorylation of c-Jun fusion protein in vitro by Plk3 following a time course suggests that these two proteins may directly interact with each other in HCE cells (Fig. 4A). Whole HCE cell lysates were prepared after UV irradiation for co-immunoprecipitation. Plk3 and c-Jun were identified in the cell lysates by Western blot analysis. Plk3 immunoprecipitates contained c-Jun (Fig. 4B, left panel). On the other hand, the anti-phospho-c-Jun (p-c-Jun) antibody, but not the c-Jun antibody, pulled down Plk3, suggesting that phospho-c-Jun (the active form) may have higher binding affinity to Plk3 (Fig. 4B, right panel). Next, whole lysates were harvested from Plk3K52R- and Plk3wild-transfected HCE cells. Expression levels of Plk3, JNK, and c-Jun were detected in the whole lysates by Western blot analysis. In an incubation of the lysates with c-Jun fusion protein linked with beads, c-Jun beads were able to pull down Plk3 and JNK proteins (Fig. 4C). In addition, nonspecific antibodies were used to test the specificity of c-Jun beads for control experiments (data not shown). Finally, immunostaining experiments were performed to investigate subcellular localizations of Plk3 and c-Jun in UV irradiation-induced HCE cells. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that Plk3 and c-Jun were co-localized in the nucleus in HCE cells 15 min after UV stimulation. Both Plk3 and c-Jun signals were enhanced 60 min after exposure of cells to UV irradiation (Fig. 4D). Thus, the results from studying protein-protein interaction and subcellular localization strongly suggest that Plk3 lies upstream of c-Jun and that it may directly regulate the c-Jun function by phosphorylation after UV irradiation. Effect of UV-induced Plk3 Activation on Apoptosis—Previous studies demonstrate that apoptosis of HCE cells induced as a result of UV irradiation is mediated by the activation of JNK and AP-1 complex (11Lu L. Kim L. Shell B. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 5102-5109Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that Plk3 activated by UV irradiation directly phosphorylated c-Jun in a JNK-independent manner. To confirm the role of Plk3 in UV irradiation-induced apoptosis, HCE cells were transfected with Plk3wild and the control vector. Overexpression of Plk3wild resulted in increased expression of c-Jun phosphorylation and enhanced cell death after UV irradiation, compared with that in control vector-transfected cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Furthermore, HCE cells were also transfected with the constitutively active Plk3-PBD and the inactive Plk3-WV as the control. Cell viabilities were significantly decreased in constitutively active Plk3-transfected HCE cells in the absence and presence of UV irradiation (Fig. 5C). In addition, UV irradiation-induced apoptosis detected by measuring changed activities of caspase 3 was significantly increased by transfection of HCE cells with the constitutively active Plk3-PBD compared with the control cells transfected with the inactive Plk3-WV (Fig. 5D). UV irradiation-induced apoptosis was further determined in JNK1 mRNA knockdown cells. Exposure of cells to UV irradiation decreased cell viability and increased DNA fragmentation in both of the control and JNK1 mRNA knockdown cells, respectively (Fig. 5, E and F). The results shown in Fig. 5 indicate that Plk3 activation and subsequent c-Jun phosphorylation by Plk3 plays an important role in UV stress-induced apoptosis in addition to the JNK signal pathway. One important function of the cornea is to act as a barrier that protects the corneal interior from being damaged by noxious environmental hazards such as UV irradiation. Recent studies show that UV irradiation induces the activation of a Kv channel in the cell membrane and activates JNK cascades to phosphorylate c-Jun protein, resulting in corneal epithelial cell apoptosis (11Lu L. Kim L. Shell B. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 5102-5109Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 26Wang L. Kim T. Lu L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 5095-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The results from our present study are consistent with others that exposure of HCE cells to UV irradiation increased c-Jun phosphorylation at two residues proximal to the major transactivation domain, including serines 63 and 73 (Fig. 2). Phosphorylation of c-Jun is required for the efficient transactivation function, and the kinases responsible for this modification include MAP kinases, such as JNKs (27Kallunki T. Kim B. Tsigelny I. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Moore G. Davis R. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2996-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 28Pulverer B.J. Kim J.M. Avruch J. Nikolakaki E. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Interestingly, UV irradiation also activated Plk3 within 15 min of UV exposure. Plk3 is a protein serine/threonine kinase and involved in the regulation of a variety of events during the cell cycle (29Dai W. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 214-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is very likely that, in addition to JNK, Plk3 also participates in phosphorylation and activation of c-Jun in HCE cells, especially in response to UV irradiation. Indeed, direct phosphorylation of c-Jun by Plk3 was demonstrated in two independent experiments. First, UV-induced AP-1 activation was significantly enhanced by overexpression of wild-type Plk3 in HCE cells. Consistently, the effect of Plk3 on AP-1 activation was observed in cells transfected with a constitutively active Plk3 cDNA construct (Fig. 1B). Second, activated Plk3 immunoprecipitated from UV-induced HCE cells was able to directly phosphorylate c-Jun fusion protein in vitro (Fig. 2). The experiment that pre-depletes JNK also strongly supports the notion that JNK may not be the major contaminant in Plk3 immunocomplex kinase assays (Fig. 3). With pre-removal of JNK, Plk3 precipitated from the same cell extracts can still strongly phosphorylate c-Jun fusion protein in vitro, suggesting that the effect of Plk3 on c-Jun phosphorylation is rather specific. The regulatory relationship between Plk3 and c-Jun in HCE cells is also confirmed by protein-protein interaction studies. Both Plk3 and c-Jun proteins are capable of pulling down each other. Intriguingly, the phospho-specific anti-c-Jun antibody, but not the general c-Jun antibody, precipitated Plk3. This suggests that a much stronger interaction exists between Plk3 and phosphorylated c-Jun (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, it is also possible that the c-Jun antibody may disrupt the interaction between c-Jun and Plk3 through competing for the same binding site on c-Jun or through inducing a conformational change. It is known that phosphorylation of c-Jun determines its function (28Pulverer B.J. Kim J.M. Avruch J. Nikolakaki E. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that phosphorylation of c-Jun by Plk3 also leads to down-regulation of c-Jun function. During interphase, a low level of Plk3 signals can be detected throughout the cell; during mitosis, Plk3 appears to be localized to mitotic apparatuses, such as spindle poles and mitotic spindles (21Conn C.W. Kim R.F. Dai W. Sanchez Y. Stambrook P.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6826-6831PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wang Q. Kim S. Chen J. Fukasawa K. Naik U. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Jhanwar-Uniyal M. Dai W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3450-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Our fluorescence microscopy experiments show that little nuclear Plk3 is detected in untreated control cells. Following UV exposure, Plk3 appears to accumulate in the nucleus, forming visible foci in HCE cells and co-localizing with c-Jun (Fig. 4D). These subcellular localization studies thus also strongly suggest that Plk3 directly interacts with c-Jun and plays a role in stress-induced signaling pathways to regulate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (30Ruan Q. Kim Q. Xie S. Fang Y. Darzynkiewicz Z. Guan K. Jhanwar-Uniyal M. Dai W. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that Plk3 involves the regulation of UV irradiation-induced HCE cell apoptosis, and overexpression of Plk3wild increased UV irradiation-induced HCE cell apoptosis (Fig. 5). The effect of Plk3 on cell viability was further confirmed by expression of a constitutively active Plk3-PBD cDNA construct. Transient expression of Plk3-PBD in HCE cells significantly reduced viability in the absence of UV stimulation and remarkably enhanced UV irradiation-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5). These results are consistent with results of previous studies. Plk3 is identified as an immediate early response gene product and involves growth factor-elicited cell cycle regulation and stress-induced DNA damage responses (18Xie S. Kim H. Wang Q. Cogswell J.P.

Ectopic expression of Plk3 and its mutants result in dramatic morphological changes, G2/M arrest, and apoptosis (21Conn C.W. Kim R.F. Dai W. Sanchez Y. Stambrook P.J.

Biol. 2002; 22: 3450-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In our recent reports, exposure of corneal epithelial cells to UV irradiation stimulates JNK activities, and this activation is associated with UV irradiation-evoked increases in cell membrane K+ channel activity (26Wang L. Kim T. Lu L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 5095-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Activation of the JNK signaling pathway by UV irradiation finally results in corneal epithelial apoptosis (11Lu L. Kim L. Shell B. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 5102-5109Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Now, we provide new evidence for a functional role of Plk3 in UV stress-induced AP-1 and c-Jun activation. In addition to activation of the JNK signaling pathway, UV irradiation-activated Plk3 interacts with c-Jun and modulates c-Jun by protein phosphorylation, subsequently resulting in corneal epithelial cell apoptosis."

Toxoplasma gondii is a highly successful parasite, causing the disease toxoplasmosis that affects humans and a wide variety of mammals. The infection is normally controlled by the immune system of healthy individuals, leading to an asymptomatic infection. Although human infections are usually relatively benign and lead to lifelong immunity, acute T. gondii infection during pregnancy in the non-immune host can cause congenital transmission resulting in serious birth defects (1Jones J.L.

In all cases, GPI biosynthesis involves the initial addition of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to phosphatidylinositol (GPIno) to form GlcNAc-PI, which is then de-N-acetylated to GlcN-PI (43Doering T.L.

Biochem. 1992; 208: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). De-N-acetylation is a prerequisite for mannosylation of GlcN-PI to form later GPI intermediates (45Watanabe R. Kim Y.

These early events occur on the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas the subsequent steps of mannosylation by three separate Dol-P-Man-dependent mannosyltransferases (23Menon A.K. Kim S. Schwarz R.T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4249-4258Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) occurs on the luminal face (10McConville M.J. Kim A.K. Mol. Memb.

A recent study on the topology of the Toxoplasma GPI biosynthesis suggests the transfer of GalNAc and Glc to the first mannose takes place on the cytoplasmic face of the ER (49Kimmel J. Kim T.K.

The pre-assembled glycolipid GPI precursor is then flipped inside the ER where it is transferred en bloc to a protein via a transamidase reaction involving the cleavage of a hydrophobic C-terminal GPI signal sequence (for review, see Refs. 50Kinoshita T. Kim N. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar and 51Menon A.K. Lennarz W.J. Lane M.D. Encyclopedia of Biological Chemistry.

Nevertheless, significant differences in the timing of certain biosynthetic steps occur between organisms, including the common but sometimes transient addition of an acyl chain linked to the 2-hydroxyl of the myo-inositol of GPI-anchor precursors. In P. falciparum as well as mammalian and yeast cells this inositol acylation is dependent upon acyl-CoA and is required before the addition of the first mannose (52Gerold P. Kim L. Blackman M.J.

In contrast, T. brucei inositol acylation only occurs after the addition of the first mannose (24Menon A.K. Kim R.T. Mayor S. Cross G.A. M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6667-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Uniquely, T. brucei inositol acylation is not acyl-CoA-dependent, and both the inositol acylation and inositol deacylation are inhibited by the serine protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and diisopropyl fluoride (DFP) respectively. In this paper we show that the serine protease inhibitors PMSF and DFP have a drastic effect on the T. gondii GPI pathway. Using a cell-free system and in vivo labeling allowed the characterization of novel mannosylated inositol-acylated T. gondii GPI intermediates. These allowed the elucidation of the roles of inositol acylation and inositol deacylation in the T. gondii GPI biosynthetic pathway. Materials—d-[6-3H]Glucosamine hydrochloride (25 Ci/mmol), UDP-[6-3H]GlcNAc (18.9 Ci/mmol), and GDP-[2-3H]mannose (15.1 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC; EC 3.1.4.10) from Bacillus cereus was from Roche Applied Science, and Bacillus thuringiensis PI-PLC, jack bean α-mannosidase (JBαM), and jack bean β-N-acetylhexosaminidase was from Glyko, although α-glucosidase (maltase) was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Parasites and Cell Culture—RH strain T. gondii tachyzoites were grown in Vero cells (20Azzouz N. Kim H. Niehus S. Debierre-Grockiego F. Bieker U. Schmid J. Mercier C. Delauw M. Dubremetz J.F. Smith T.K. Schwarz R.T. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 1914-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Confluent cell cultures (175 cm2) were infected with 5 × 107 tachyzoites in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 1% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Tachyzoites were harvested after 72 h and set free from their host cells using the Mixer Mill homogenizer (Retsch), and the suspension was run through a 20-ml glass wool column to remove cellular debris. The purity of the tachyzoite suspension was monitored microscopically. Cell lines and parasites were routinely tested for Mycoplasma contamination. Metabolic Labeling of Tachyzoites—After infection with T. gondii (72 h post-infection), cell cultures were washed twice with glucose-free culture medium containing 20 mm sodium pyruvate. Labeling was performed using the same medium supplemented with 0.5 mCi d-[6-3H]glucosamine for 6 h at 37 °C. After labeling, parasites were liberated from host cells and purified as described previously (39Tomavo S. Kim J.F. Schwarz R.T. J. Biol.

Those in vivo labelings involving PMSF (1 mm) or DFP (1 mm) were preincubated for 6 h with d-[6-3H]glucosamine before the addition of inhibitor and incubated for a further 5 min. Radiolabeled glycolipids were extracted and analyzed as described below. In Vitro Labeling of Early, Non-mannosylated GPI Biosynthesis Intermediates—In vitro labeling was performed as described (16Striepen B. Kim J.F. Schwarz R.T.

Hypotonically permeabilized parasites were pelleted (1000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and washed twice with incubation buffer A (50 mm Na-HEPES at pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 μg/ml tunicamycin). Labeling experiments were performed in the presence of 8 mm EDTA and absence of Mn2+, as Mn2+ is required for dolichol-phosphate-mannose synthase activity, therefore preventing the formation of Dol-P-Man (38Chen R. Kim E.I. Parker G. Lapurga J.P. Millan J.L. Ikehara Y. Udenfriend S. Medof M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9512-9517Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 1 × 108 tachyzoites were labeled in buffer A supplemented with 2 μCi of UDP-[6-3H]GlcNAc, dithiothreitol (1 mm) in the absence or presence of ATP (1 mm) and CoA (1 mm) or Acyl-CoA (100 μm). Reactions were briefly vortexed and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C, and the radiolabeled glycolipid products extracted and analyzed as described below. Labeling of Mannosylated Glycolipids—Aliquots (100 μl) of 0.5 × 108 tachyzoites in buffer A with 1 μCi of GDP-[2-3H]Man, dithiothreitol (1 mm), and MnCl2 (5 mm) were incubated with either UDP-GlcNAc (1 mm) or GlcN-PI (500 μm)2 with n-octyl-glucopyranoside (0.3%) in the absence or presence of the following supplements: ATP (1 mm), CoA (100 μm), pamityl-CoA (100 μm), UDP-GalNAc (1 mm), and UDP-Glc (1 mm). Some reactions were preincubated with PMSF (1 mm) or DFP (1 mm) for 5 min before the addition of supplements. The cell-free system reactions were briefly sonicated and incubated for 120 min at 37 °C. The radiolabeled glycolipids were extracted and analyzed as described below. Extraction of Glycolipids—All in vivo and in vitro labeled glycolipid products were extracted three times in chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3, v/v), dried, and recovered from a butan-1-ol partitioning, as previously described (20Azzouz N. Kim H. Niehus S. Debierre-Grockiego F. Bieker U. Schmid J. Mercier C. Delauw M. Dubremetz J.F. Smith T.K. Schwarz R.T. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 1914-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). HPTLC—Samples as well as glycolipid standards were applied to 10-cm aluminum-backed silica gel 60 HPTLC plates that were developed using solvent system A, hexane, chloroform, methanol, water, acetic acid (3:10:10:2:1, v/v), or solvent system B, chloroform, methanol, 1 m ammonium hydroxide (10:10:3, v/v), both before and after enzymatic and chemical digests. Radiolabeled components were detected using either a Berthold LB2842 or a Bioscan AR-200 linear analyzer or by fluorography at –70 °C after soaking in EA-Wax and using Kodak XAR-5 film with an intensifying screen. Enzymatic and Chemical Treatments of Radiolabeled Glycolipids—Digestions with JBαM, GPI-PLD, PI-PLC, base hydrolysis, deamination, and N-acetylation were performed as previously described (Ref. 25Güther M.L. Kim M.A. J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3080-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar and references therein). jack bean β-N-acetylhexosaminidase and α-glucosidase were performed following the manufacturer’s instructions. Glycan Head-group Analysis—The HPTLC-purified radiolabeled glycolipids were delipidated, deaminated, reduced, dephosphorylated with aqueous HF, and desalted by passage through AG50X12 (H+) and AG3X4 (OH–) ion-exchange resins. The resulting neutral glycan head groups were analyzed before and after various glycosidic digests each by Bio-Gel P4 gel filtration (Ref. 16Striepen B. Kim J.F. Schwarz R.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1478-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar and references therein). For these analyzes the radiolabeled glycans were detected by scintillation counting and correlated with the elution positions of the co-injected individual glucose oligomer standards. Exoglycosidase Digestions of Glycans—Glycans obtained from HPTLC-purified radiolabeled glycolipids were digested with either JBαM, jack bean β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, or α-glucosidase. All enzymatic digests were terminated by heating at 100 °C for 5 min. The samples were desalted by passing through 0.25 ml of AG50X12(H+), dried, and flash co-evaporated with toluene to remove residual acetic acid. Identification of the Phosphatidylinositol Moieties from Purified Free GPIs and GPI-anchored Proteins—T. gondii free GPIs and GPI-anchored proteins were purified as previously described (54Azzouz N. Kim H. Schwarz R.T. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 343: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Aliquots (2–10 nmol) were dried and dissolved in 15 μl of sodium acetate (0.3 m, pH 4) followed by the addition of 7.5 μl of freshly prepared sodium nitrite (1 m) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. An additional 15 μl of sodium acetate (0.3 m, pH 4) and 7.5 μl of freshly prepared sodium nitrite (1 m) were added and incubated for a further 2 h at 37 °C. The GPIno moiety released by deamination was partitioned into butan-1-ol (3 × 100 μl). The pooled butan-1-ol extracts were dried and suspended in chloroform/methanol (1:2) and analyzed by negative ion electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS) on a Quattro Ultima triple quadrapole instrument. Samples were introduced into the mass spectrometer using nanospray tips. GPIno species were observed in negative ion mode with a capillary voltage of 0.9 kV and a cone voltage of 40–60 V. Daughter ion ES-MS-MS spectra were obtained with a collision voltage of 35–50 V using argon at 3 × 10–3 torr as the collision gas. MassLynx was used to record and process the data. Identification of Toxoplasma GPI Biosynthetic Genes—Genes for GPI biosynthesis were identified by using sequences of homologue genes for the GPI biosynthesis of different species as probes to systematically search for the homologous genes in data provided by the Toxoplasma Genome resource. In all cases putative homologous genes were identified and analyzed as to their suitability to be true homologues. The homologues were checked for Pfam motifs and conserved residues as well as topology and hydrophobicity comparisons, after which they were submitted to EMBL and GenBank™ (see Table 2).TABLE 2Identification of the T. gondii genes for the GPI biosynthetic pathway using homologues from P. falciparum, human, and yeastStepEnzymeDonorGenesMammalsYeastT. gondiiP. falciparum1GlcNAc transferaseUDP—GlcNAcPIG-AGPI3/SPT14/CWH6PIG-APIG-APIG-H—aGenes are missing.PIG-CGPI2PIG-C (CAI84649)GPI1GPI1GPI1GPI1PIG-PYDR437W2De-N-acetylasePIG-LGPI12PIG-L (CAI91276)3Inositol-acyltransferasePalmitoyl-CoAPIG-W(PIG-W) YJL091CPIG-W (CAH18643)PIG-W4α1-4-Mannosyltransferase (MT-I)Dol-P—ManPIG-MGPI14 (a)PIG-M (CAI84647)PIG-M5α1-6-Mannosyltransferase (MT-II)Dol-P—ManPIG-VPIG-V (CAI91278)6α1-2-Mannosyltransferase (MT-III)Dol-P—ManPIG-BGPI10PIG-BPIG-B7Ethanolamine-P-transferasePEPIG-FGPI11PIG-FPIG-OGPI13PIG-OPIG-O8Inositol-deacylase9β1-4GalNAc transferaseUDP—GalNAc10α1-4Glc transferaseUDP—Glc11Phospholipase A212TransamidaseGAA1GAA1GAA1 (CAI91277)GAA1GPI8GPI8GPI8 (CAD44992)GPI8PIG-TGPI16PIG-SGPI17PIG-TPIG-UCdc91pDol-P—Man synthaseGDP—ManDPM1DPM1DPM1 (CAI84648)DPM1DPM2‡DPM3‡a Genes are missing. Open table in a new tab Formation of GlcN-(acyl)PI—A cell-free system was utilized to study the Toxoplasma GPI biosynthetic pathway. Priming of the endogenous GPI pathway with UDP-[3H]GlcNAc in the presence of dithiothreitol and EDTA (Fig. 1A) resulted in the formation of two [3H]GlcN-labeled glycolipids. Identification by various digests (Table 1) revealed them to be [3H]GlcNAc-PI and [3H]GlcN-PI, presumably formed via the UDP-GlcNAc:PI GlcNAc transferase and the subsequent GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase. The addition of ATP and CoA (Fig. 1B) or Pam-CoA (data not shown) to the cell-free system causes the formation of a third [3H]GlcN glycolipid, which is resistant to PI-PLC but sensitive to GPI-PLD, deamination, and base hydrolysis (Figs. 1, C–E, and Table 1), suggesting the formation of GlcN-(acyl)PI in T. gondii. This inositol acyltransferase activity, like that of the P. falciparum, S. cerevisiae, and mammalian GPI pathways, acts on GlcN-PI (14Ferguson M.A. J. Kim J.S. Brown J.R. Crossman A. Dix A.

The connection between extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton is essential for cell extracellular matrix adhesion. This connection is mediated by a network of protein-protein interactions involving integrins and many cytoskeletal proteins (1Hynes R.O.

Although skelemin IgC domains 4-5 also bind to integrins, the molecular details for this binding have not been characterized.In this work, we have undertaken a detailed structural characterization of the skelemin/integrin interaction using NMR as a primary technique. We show that skelemin IgC repeats 4 and 5 exhibit a conserved Ig-fold, and we have characterized their interactions with integrin αIIbβ3 cytoplasmic tails. Specific regions of contact between the IgC of skelemin and the integrin β3 CT have been mapped. Our NMR data confirmed that the primary skelemin binding site resides in the membrane proximal region of the β3 CT (4Reddy K.B. Kim P. Price M.G. Negrescu E.V. Fox J.E. J. Biol.

Furthermore, surprisingly, we have detected a skelemin binding site in the membrane-proximal region of αIIb CT. Overall, our data provide a molecular template for understanding how SkIgC45 may serve as a modulator of the αIIbβ3 complex formation and a regulator of integrin clustering.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Purification—Cloning, expression, and purification of αIIb CT, β3 CT, and MBP-β3 have been described previously (15Vinogradova O. Kim A. Velyviene A. Hu B. Haas T. Plow E. Qin J. Cell. 2002; 110: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The short N-terminal part of the β3 CT (Lys716-Trp739; N-terminal part of β3) was subcloned into pET31b vector (Novagen Inc.) and purified according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The short C-terminal part of β3 CT (Lys738-Thr762; Cβ3) was synthesized chemically (Biotechnology Core, Cleveland Clinic Foundation). SkIgC4 (Glu1207-Phe1328), SkIgC5 (Glu1332-Met1433) and SkIgC45 (Glu1207-Met1433) were subcloned into pET15b vector (Novagen Inc.) containing an N-terminal His tag using NdeI forward and BamHI reverse cutting sites. SkIgC4 was expressed in BL21(DE3) cells. Rosetta(DE3) cell line from Novagen, expressing rare tRNAs, was employed to improve expression levels of SkIgC5 and SkIgC45. Purification of all skelemin Ig domains was performed according to the protocol from Qiagen under nondenaturing conditions followed by gel filtration on HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column in PBS (140 mm NaCl, 27 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) buffer. To prevent aggregation of SkIgC5, gel filtration was performed in 1% Triton X-100. The aliquot containing an elution peak, corresponding in milliwatt to SkIgC5 dimer, was collected. Using a Millipore Ami-con centrifugal 10 KDa filter unit, it was washed thoroughly with 10 volumes of 0.5× PBS and concentrated. GST-fused skelemin domains were purified as described (4Reddy K.B.

To produce isotopically labeled αIIb CT, β3 CT, and Sk-IgC4/SkIgC45, cells were grown in M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4CL (1.1 g/liter) and/or 13C glucose (3 g/liter) and/or 2H2O.NMR Spectroscopy—HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum correlation) titration experiments (summarized in Fig. 2) were performed on 0.1 mM 15N-labeled β3 CT or αIIb CT mixed at 1:1, 1:3, 1:5 molar ratios of unlabeled SkIgC4, SkIgC5, and SkIgC45 at 25 °C in 0.25× PBS. Sequence-specific assignments of integrin tails are described elsewhere (15Vinogradova O. Kim A. Velyviene A. Hu B. Haas T. Plow E. Qin J.

Transferred NOESY experiments for different peptides were performed at 25 °C in 0.25× PBS with mixing times of 100, 200, 300, and 400 ms to analyze NOE build-up to eliminate spin-diffusion arti-facts. Different ratios of the peptides to the binding partner were investigated to find the optimal range for NOE transfer for each particular analysis. The resonance assignments of unlabeled peptides were made using conventional two-dimensional 1H TOCSY and NOESY spectra (16Wuthrich K. NMR of proteins and nucleic acids.

Residues labeled indicate the most significant changes. B, chemical shift changes of the β3 tail upon SkIgC45 binding. Bars are colored according to the different ratios as presented in A. First nine residues (Lys716-Arg724) in 1:5 (blue) series are undetectable because of extreme line-broadening and are shown as bars with maximum values. C, chemical shift changes of the β3 tail upon binding to different skelemin constructs at the ratio of 1:3. Bars are colored according to the interaction with a particular domain of skelemin: green bars, interaction with SkIgC4; blue bars, interaction with SkIgC5; red bars, interaction with SkIgC45. The last bar in each series represents chemical shifts of the Trp739 side-chain HN; His722 is undetectable (probably because of the exchange with water) and is not shown in green and blue series. Δδ(HN,N) in ppm refers to the combined HN and N chemical shift changes, according to the equation: Δδ(HN,N) = ((ΔδHN2 + 0.2 (ΔδN)2)½, where Δδ = δbound - δfree.

The resonance assignments of double-labeled SkIgC4 were made using standard triple resonance experiments at two temperatures, 25 °C and 40 °C, to resolve the differential line-broadening for certain regions of the protein and to overcome degeneracy of peak frequencies. Briefly, HNCACB and HNCA experiments were used for the backbone and H(CC)(CO)HN, (H)CC(CO)HN, and HCCH-TOCSY experiments for side-chain assignments. All the spectra were processed with nmrPipe (18Delaglio F. Kim S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Kim P. Price M.G. Negrescu E.V. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35039-35047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This notion is based on yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down experiments. To confirm and further characterize this interaction at the molecular level, we performed chemical shift mapping experiments by NMR. Unlabeled SkIgC45 was titrated into the solution of 15N-labeled β3 CT, and associated chemical shift perturbations were monitored (Fig. 2A). Chemical shifts changes, plotted as a function of the residue number in β3 CT (Fig. 2B), clearly show that the membrane-proximal region is most perturbed, confirming that primary binding site resides in this region (4Reddy K.B. Kim P. Price M.G. Negrescu E.V. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35039-35047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the extent of the chemical shift perturbations is rather small, which may be because of rapid reversibility and/or low affinity of the interaction. However, the perturbations are reproducible and concentration-dependent. Increase in SkIgC45 to β3 CT ratio of 5:1 resulted in significant line-broadening and disappearance of some peaks that correspond to the most perturbed N-terminal membrane proximal region of β CT3 (the Lys716-Arg724 region; Fig. 2B).To further characterize the binding interface and to distinguish which of the two Ig domains is essential for this interaction, we titrated unlabeled SkIgC4 and SkIgC5 separately into 15N-labeled β3 CT (Fig. 2C). SkIgC5 appears to be primarily responsible for binding to the membrane-proximal region ending at Asp723. SkIgC4 causes perturbations mostly around Asn743-Thr755. SkIgC45 caused perturbations in both regions albeit in a smaller extent. Interestingly, the Asn743-Thr755 binding site overlaps with the filamin Ig domain binding site found in the crystal structure of integrin β7 in complex with Ig-FLN21 (14Kiema T. Kim Y. Jiang P. Oxley C.L. Baldassarre M. Wegener K.L. Campbell I.D. Ylanne J. Calderwood D.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 337-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) suggesting that SkIgC4 may bind to integrin β3 tail in a similar manner as filamin. Several additional residues, Ala735, Lys738, and Asp740, are also affected by binding to SkIgC4.To confirm the above binding data, we employed another method by performing transferred NOE (trNOE) experiments (27Clore G.M. Kim A.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 402-417Google Scholar). This method is especially well suited to characterize weak interactions (28Vaynberg J. Kim J. Trends Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 22-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, it is expected that unstructured or only a partially folded peptide assumes a stable conformation upon binding to the target protein, and this process is manifested by appearance of additional peaks in its NOESY spectra. We used short synthetic β3 peptides composed of either the 24 N-terminal (Nβ3) or 25 C-terminal (Cβ3) residues. IgC4 and IgC5 were fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST), respectively, where fusion of GST increased molecular weight of the binding targets to allow favorable NOE transfer (28Vaynberg J. Kim J. Trends Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 22-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Nβ3 mixed with GST-IgC5 exhibited several additional peaks (Fig. 3A, blue, highlighted by arrows) compared with the free unstructured peptide, whereas Nβ3 mixed with GST-IgC4 did not (3A, red). These additional peaks were also observed when Nβ3 was mixed with SkIgC45 (data not shown). In comparison, Cβ3 displayed almost no additional peaks when mixed with GST-IgC5 (Fig. 3B, blue) but exhibited several additional peaks when mixed with GST-IgC4 (3B, red, highlighted by arrows). Interestingly, these peaks are more pronounced and form a slightly different pattern when Cβ3 was mixed with SkIgC45 (Fig. 6 in supplemental data), suggesting that the loop connecting domains 4 and 5 may help to define the proper mutual orientation between integrin β3 CT and/or tandem skelemin IgC repeats. To conclude, our trNOE data independently validate the above HSQC-based skelemin binding model to integrin β3 CT, i.e. SkIgC5 binds to the N terminus of β3 CT, whereas SkIgC4 is involved in interaction with C terminus of β3 CT. The number of additional peaks was limited in both cases, which precluded us from total structure determination of the bound peptides. However, the NOE pattern did suggest that NPLY motif of β3 forms inverse turn when bound to SkIgC4.FIGURE 3Transferred NOEs evidence for integrinβ3/skelemin andαIIb/skelemin interactions. All shown trNOE experiments were performed at 25 °C (400 ms mixing time) in 0.25× PBS buffer (pH 6.2; 5 mm Ca2+ was added to the samples used for experiments presented in panels C and D to stabilize αIIb CT as described earlier (15Vinogradova O.

Superposition of NOESY spectra are presented as follows: A, Nβ3 alone (black) and in complex with skelemin GST-IgC5 (blue, some additional peaks are highlighted by arrows) or with GST-IgC4 (red) at the ratios of 20:1; B, Cβ3 alone (black) and in complex with skelemin GST-IgC5 (blue) or with GST-IgC4 (red, some additional peaks are highlighted by arrows) at the ratios of 20:1; C, αIIb alone (black), in the presence of MBP-β3 (red) at the ratio of 100:1 showing additional peaks, a manifestation of trNOE effect reported previously (15Vinogradova O.

To our surprise, the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of αIIb CT also underwent dose-dependent chemical shift changes upon addition of unlabeled SkIgC45 (Fig. 2E). However, no changes were associated with titration of SkIgC4 (data not shown), suggesting that SkIgC5 is a major binding partner for the integrin αIIb subunit. Several peaks, such as the ones corresponding to residues Gly991, Phe992, Lys994, and Arg997, are significantly broadened and shifted slightly, whereas others, like Val990, Phe993, Arg995, and Asn996, are just shifted. All perturbations are clustered within the membrane-proximal region of αIIb. This is the region involved in the maintenance of the receptor in a latent state by interacting with the membrane-proximal region of β3. Interestingly, the most significantly perturbed residues are Phe993, Lys994, and Asn996, which are located on the opposite side of αIIb interface with β3 CT (15Vinogradova O. Kim A. Velyviene A. Hu B. Haas T. Plow E. Qin J. Cell. 2002; 110: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). This novel finding may have significant impact on our understanding of how skelemin might associate with the integrin cytoplasmic face.Integrin β3 Binding Site on Skelemin—We next attempted to investigate the interaction from the skelemin side using the same 1H-15N HSQC method. We do see changes in the SkIgC45 spectrum upon addition of full-length β3 CT, mostly manifested by differential line broadening, but also by some small chemical shifts perturbations (Fig. 2D). However, the overall quality of this spectrum prevents us from making full (or even backbone) resonance assignments of this construct. The molecular weight of SkIgC45 is about 29, which is within modern solution NMR limits, but the protein appears to undergo a significant degree of conformational exchange, and neither deuteration nor TROSY-based experiments at high magnetic field improved the spectral quality. Thus we decided to investigate SkIgC4 and SkIgC5 separately. We found that these two highly similar (about 20% sequence identity, Fig. 1B) domains of skelemin, composing essentially the same fold, behaved very differently in solution. SkIgC4 is a monomer and is characterized by a well dispersed, homogeneous spectrum, which allows not only full resonance assignments but also high-resolution structure determination (see below). However, SkIgC4 1H-15N HSQC spectrum shows no chemical shifts perturbations upon addition of full-length β3 CT at ratios of up to 1:3 (data not shown). Further increase of this ratio is limited by the insolubility of β3 CT, which prefers low salt and pH below 6.1, whereas SkIgC4 requires some salt and a pH ∼ 7.0 to prevent aggregation. Thus, we again used the short synthetic β3 peptides, Nβ3 or Cβ3, to examine interactions. We see no changes upon addition of Nβ3 in SkIgC4 1H-15N HSQC spectrum even with high excess of the peptide (ratios of up to 20:1). Very small changes upon addition of Cβ3 in the SkIgC4 1H-15N HSQC spectrum (ratios of up to 40:1) were masked by random changes in frequencies of highly sensitive surface exposed residues, which did not allow us to map unambiguously integrin β3 binding surface on skelemin IgC4. Addition of αIIb CT has no effect on SkIgC4 HSQC spectrum, confirming the above titration results for 15N-labeled αIIb subunit. SkIgC5 tends to oligomerize in solution, therefore we do not observe its 1H-15N HSQC spectrum because of its slow, on the NMR time scale, tumbling rate. Interestingly, the SkIgC45 construct seemed to behave better than SkIgC5 alone, which allowed us to obtain HSQC despite some conformational exchange problems (Fig. 2D). This finding indicates that SkIgC4 plays an important structural/stabilizing role in the solution behavior of SkIgC45.NMR Structure of SkIgC4 and Homology Modeling of SkIgC5—To verify fold and characterize unique features of skelemin IgC domains 4 and 5, we performed detailed structural analysis. First, we determined the high-resolution structure of SkIgC4 by modern triple resonance NMR methods as described in the “Structure Calculation” section of the “Experimental Procedures” (assignments are presented in Table 2 of supplemental data). As expected, SkIgC4 adopts a very well known Ig-fold and contains seven β-strands in two β-sheets, which form a β-sandwich. Apart from these β-strands, however, SkIgC4 contains unique features, namely two alpha helices, referred to as N-terminal H1 and C-terminal H2. Fig. 4A maps SkIgC4 secondary structural elements, and 4B shows a schematic representation of their arrangement. In accordance with the IgC-fold, β-strands A, B, E, and F form one face of the β-sandwich and strands C, F, and G form the other face (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, there is one short β-strand (D′), which runs almost perpendicular to strand C. This feature is not observed often in IgC-folds. The N-terminal H1 is made up of six amino acid residues and is followed by a long flexible region (13 residues), which connects it to β-strand A. The C-terminal H2 is composed of 10 residues and is attached to β-strand G by a short loop. Additionally, there is a helix-like turn, which connects β-strands E and F. Fig. 4D presents the backbone super-position of 20 calculated structures with the lowest target energy functions. This ensemble has been deposited to Protein Data Bank (access code 2jtd). Statistics of this ensemble are presented in Table 1 demonstrate a very high quality structure (see also Ramachandran plot, Fig. 7 in supplemental data).FIGURE 4Structure of SkIgC4 and model of SkIgC5 domains.

Because the αS589C mutation alters the monovalent to divalent cation selectivity ratio of ENaC and because internally applied Cd2+ blocks wild-type ENaC with high affinity, we hypothesized that the inhibition of αS589C ENaC by Cd2+ results rather from the coordination of this cation with native cysteine residues located in the internal pore of ENaC.

J. 2004; 23: 146-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar).Functional ENaC at the cell plasma membrane is a heteromeric protein made of homologous α, β, and γ subunits arranged pseudosymetrically around a central channel pore, presumably in a 2 α, 1 β, and 1 γ configuration (5Firsov D. Kim I. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Schild L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 6Kosari F. Kim S.H. Li J.Q. Mak D.D. Foskett J.K. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13469-13474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Each ENaC subunit is made of two transmembrane helices (TM1 and TM2), a large extracellular loop that represents more than half of the mass of the protein, and intracellular N and C termini. The ENaC subunits belong to the ENaC/degenerin superfamily of ion channels but share no sequence homology with other tetrameric channels also made of two transmembrane domains, such as inward rectifier K+ channels.In the absence of crystal structures of members of the ENaC/degenerin ion channel family, our understanding of mechanisms and structures involved in the ion permeation is quite limited. The amino acid sequence preceding the second transmembrane domain (TM2) constitutes the outer channel pore (pore region in Fig. 1) where the pore blocker amiloride binds (αSer-583, βGly-525, γGly-537 in rat ENaC sequence, see Fig. 1) (7Kellenberger S. Kim I. Schild L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 848-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Secondary structure predictions conform the TM2 to an α helix (8Rost B. Kim G. Liu J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W321-W326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). The amiloride binding site is located external and upstream to the selectivity filter with an amino-to-carboxyl sense. The conserved three-amino acid sequence G/SXS (587–589 in rat ENaC) that is essential to maintain the high selectivity of ENaC for Na+ over K+ or Ca2+ ions is considered therefore a key element of the selectivity filter (9Kellenberger S. Kim I. Schild L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4170-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the increase in permeability to K+ and NH +4 resulting from mutations of αSer-589 reflects changes in the geometry of the pore segment comprising the selectivity filter that allow it to accommodate larger cations (10Kellenberger S. Kim M. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E. Schild L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of the interaction between the permeant Na2+ or Li2+ ions and oxygen atoms at the binding site is not yet clear. Recent experiments reported that the serine 589 to cysteine substitution in the α subunit (αS589C) confers to ENaC a sensitivity to block by external Cd2+ ions, which was interpreted as evidence for an orientation of the side chain of serine 589 toward the lumen of the channel pore (11Sheng S. Kim C.J. Kashlan O.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8513-8522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).ENaC and the K+ channel KcsA share a similar membrane topology and a heterotetrameric structure made of homologous subunits comprising two transmembrane segments. The conduction pore of ENaC appears to be, however, quite different from that of the members of the K+ channel superfamily. The amino-terminal portion of the pore region in the KcsA forms an α helix (pore helix) pointing from the outside toward the center of the channel (12Doyle D.A. Kim J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A.L. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5686) Google Scholar). Following this pore helix, the amino acid stretch lining the selectivity filter folds back toward the external surface, exposing binding sites for external blocking ligands such as toxins or triethanolamine (TEA). In ENaC, the pore region points from the outside to the center of the channel with an amino-to-carboxyl sense of, successively, the amiloride binding site, the selectivity filter, and the TM2 (1Kellenberger S. Kim L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar).These important differences in the pore organization indicate that the three-dimensional structure of the KcsA K+ channel does not represent an adequate template to understand ion permeation through ENaC. The pore-lining residues beyond the selectivity filter that constitute the internal channel pore remain to be identified in channels belonging to the ENaC/degenerin family, for which only a few studies have been performed to determine the accessibility of inner pore lining residues. Recent work has shown that, in contrast to the acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC), another member of the ENaC/degenerin family, ENaC is highly sensitive to intracellularly applied sulfhydryl reagents such as Cd2+, Zn2+, or methanethiosulfonates (MTS). Cysteine residues in the N terminus of ENaC contribute to inhibition by MTS reagents (13Kellenberger S. Kim I. Pfister Y. Schild L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7739-7747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Similar inhibition of ASIC by internal sulfhydryl reagents can be reproduced in ASIC mutants in which cysteines have been introduced at the N terminus and in the 5′-start of the TM1 (14Pfister Y. Kim I. Takeda A.N. van Bemmelen M. Kellenberger S. Schild L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11787-11791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Altogether, these observations suggest that the N terminus and the internal part of TM1 participate in the pore lining of ENaC.In this study we have revisited the mechanism of channel blockade by external Cd2+ in ENaC mutants with amino acid substitutions in the selectivity filter (αS589C) (11Sheng S. Kim C.J. Kashlan O.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8513-8522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We show that, in order to block ENaC, Cd2+ has to bind to distinct sites deep in the channel pore, including a cysteine residue in the TM2 of γENaC subunits.MATERIALS AND METHODSSite-directed Mutagenesis, Expression in Xenopus laevis Oocytes, and Electrophysiology—The ENaC constructs used for this study were taken from a previous study (10Kellenberger S. Kim M. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E. Schild L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Kellenberger S. Kim I. Pfister Y. Schild L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7739-7747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Complementary RNAs of each α, β, γ subunit were synthesized in vitro with SP6 RNA polymerase from wild-type and mutant α, β, and γENaC cDNA encoding vectors previously linearized with PvuII (α and γ subunits) or BglII (β subunit).Healthy stage V and VI X. laevis oocytes were pressure-injected with 100 nl of a solution containing equal amounts of α, β, and γ ENaC subunits at a total concentration of 100 ng/μl. For standard experiments, oocytes were kept at 19 °C in a low Na+-modified Barth’s saline: in mm, 10 NaCl, 0.82 MgSO4, 0.41 CaCl2, 0.33 Ca(NO3)2, 80 NMDG, 2 KCl, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.2.Electrophysiological measurements were made 16–30 h after injection. ENaC current (INa) was recorded using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique (model TEV-200; Dagan Corp.). Holding potential was–100 mV. The amiloride-sensitive currents defined as the difference in I measured before and after addition of 10 μm amiloride (Sigma-Aldrich) in the bath were considered ENaC-mediated macroscopic INa. All electrophysiological experiments were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C). Oocytes were maintained in a recording chamber continuously perfused with a standard bath solution containing in mm, 120 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2-2H2O, and 10 HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2. For cadmium block experiments, 0.01, 0.1, 1, or 10 mm Cd2+ was freshly added to the perfusion solution. Results are reported as means ± S.E. and represent the mean of n independent experiments in which the average amiloride-sensitive Na+ current INa was measured for four to ten individual oocytes originating from different frogs.Analysis of the Data—Data obtained from the time course of INa decrease in the presence of external Cd2+ were best fitted by the sum of two exponentials. To analyze the voltage dependence curve of the INa current of the ENaC mutant, the ratio I/I0 measured in presence (I) of 1 or 3 mm Cd2+ to that in the absence of the Cd2+ (I0) is described by the Woodhull equation (15Ravindran A. Kim L. Moczydlowski E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 97: 89-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 1 Pun=I/I0=KB(0)exp(′FV/RT)/{[B]+KB(0)exp(′FV/RT)} (Eq. 1) where Pun is the probability that the binding site of Cd2+ is unblocked; KB(0) is the equilibrium dissociation constant at 0 mV; [B] is the blocker concentration; z′ is the slope parameter; F, the Faraday’s constant; V, the applied voltage; R, the gas constant, and T, the absolute temperature. Moreover, z′ is equal to the product of the actual valence of the blocking ion z and the fraction of the membrane potential (or electrical distance) δ acting on the ion: z′= zδ.RESULTSIt has recently been reported that serine-to-cysteine substitution at position 589 in αENaC makes the channel inhibitable by external Cd2+ (11Sheng S. Kim C.J. Kashlan O.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8513-8522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The block of ENaC αS589C mutant by Cd2+ shows an unusual slow on-rate (kon > 1000 m–1s–1), as well as a slow and incomplete recovery of ENaC activity after external Cd2+ removal. This was interpreted as evidence for Cd2+ coordination with the thiol group of the side chain of the cysteine at position α589 (11Sheng S. Kim C.J. Kashlan O.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8513-8522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).αSer-589 is located in the selectivity filter sequence G587S588S589 of rat ENaC (see Fig. 2), and its mutation drastically changes the ion selectivity of the channel (9Kellenberger S. Kim I. Schild L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4170-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 10Kellenberger S. Kim M. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E. Schild L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that these unusual characteristics of block by Cd2+ are due to the trapping of Cd2+ ions in the internal pore of the channel, i.e. downstream the selectivity filter as far as the channel opening to the cytosol. Two previous observations support this hypothesis. First, the αS589C mutation makes the channel permeable to divalent cations such as Ca2+ and possibly also to Cd2+, which has a smaller ionic radius than the former (9Kellenberger S. Kim I. Schild L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4170-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Second, we have recently reported that, in both inside-out patch and in cut-open oocytes, Cd2+ applied at micromolar concentrations to the intracellular side of ENaC blocks the channel; this block was characterized by a slow and partial recovery upon removal of Cd2+ (13Kellenberger S. Kim I. Pfister Y. Schild L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7739-7747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Current inhibition of the αSer-589, β, γ mutants by external Cd2+. Representative tracings of macroscopic ENaC (INa) currents obtained in oocytes injected with ENaC αS589C, β, γ (A); αS589D, β, γ (B); αS589N, β, γ (C); αS589A, β, γ (D); or α, β, γ wild-type (E). Removal of amiloride (10 μm) in the bath induced a robust inward Na+ current. The addition of 0.1 or 1 mm external Cd2+ (A–C) decreased INa, whereas 10 mm Cd2+ decreased INa of the αS589A, β, γ (D). The wild-type ENaC (E) remained insensitive to 10 mm cadmium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the requirement of a thiol side chain at position α589 for the binding of external Cd2+ and the inhibition of ENaC, we tested its effect on different substitution mutants, e.g. αS589C, αS589D, αS589N, and αS589A. Cd2+ ions are known to bind the sulfhydryl group of cysteine or the fully charged oxygen atoms contributed by glutamate or aspartate side chains; however, Cd2+ has little affinity for side chains of asparagine. Fig. 2 shows representative recordings of ENaC-mediated amiloride-sensitive currents (INa) and their inhibition by external Cd2+. Cadmium at 0.1 or 1 mm inhibits the INa generated by ENaC αS589C, αS589D, and αS589N mutants (Fig. 2, A–C). A higher concentration of Cd2+ (10 mm) is required to inhibit the αS589A mutant (Fig. 2D), whereas wild-type ENaC remains insensitive to inhibition by Cd2+ (Fig. 2E).The blockade of ENaC αSer-589 mutants by Cd2+ slowly reaches equilibrium. This is particularly evident for low concentrations of Cd2+ and for the αS589N mutant, which appears slightly less sensitive to Cd2+ than the αS589C and αS589D counterparts. It was difficult to determine the true affinity of the αSer-589 mutants for Cd2+ because at low Cd2+ concentrations the blockade equilibrium was still not reached after several minutes. At a higher concentration of Cd2+ (1 mm) the rate of channel inhibition is faster and the block almost complete after 1 min. This contrasts with the fast kinetics of inhibition of the αS583C ENaC mutant by Cd2+ at concentrations varying from 0.01 to 1 mm (IC50 = 0.105 ± 0.0012 mm, n = 10): external Cd2+ rapidly reduces the current level in a dose-dependent manner without changes in the on-rate of channel blockade (Fig. 3). By contrast to the αS589N, the αS583N mutant is insensitive to inhibition by external Cd2+. There is strong evidence that the side chain of the cysteine at position Ser-583 is oriented toward the channel lumen, allowing Cd2+ to bind in the external pore and to block the channel (16Sheng S.H. Kim J.Q. Mcnulty K.A. Kieber-Emmons T. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1326-1334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 17Schild L. Kim E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). It also shows that Asn does not bind Cd2+ at any of the assayed concentrations, and we conclude therefore that the lower sensitivity of the αS589N mutant to Cd2+ inhibition probably results from a decreased permeability to this cation as compared with that of the other α589 mutants. Moreover, the discrepancy between the αSer-589 and αSer-583 mutants regarding their sensitivity to Cd2+ and the kinetics of block indicate that the mechanism of ENaC inhibition by Cd2+ is different for the two mutants.FIGURE 3Inhibition of αS583C, β, γ mutant by external Cd2+.

Fit of the data (▪) was obtained by simple Langmuir isotherm and gave a KD for Cd2+ of 0.105 ± 0.0012 mm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The on-rate of channel inhibition by Cd2+ of the αS589C, -D, -N, and -A mutants is summarized in Fig. 4; the best fit of the data were obtained using the sum of two exponentials, consistent with two components of the ENaC block with a fast and a slow rate constant (Table 1). The data also show that increasing Cd2+ concentrations between 0.01 and 1 mm affect predominantly the time required to reach the equilibrium rather than the magnitude of current inhibition. From the extrapolation of the best fit of αSer-589 channel inhibition, we can predict that, at equilibrium, the half-maximal inhibition (IC50) for Cd2+ is largely below 0.1 mm for the αS589C, -D, and -N mutants, suggesting a high affinity site for the Cd2+ binding site. However, the slow on-rate of the Cd2+ block points to the presence of important diffusional constraints in the αSer-589 mutants for Cd2+ ions to bind at its blocking site. Interestingly, the conserved αS589A substitution, which only slightly modifies the cation selectivity of the channel compared with the αS589C, -D, and -N mutants, shows the slowest on-rate of Cd2+ block.FIGURE 4Time course of inhibition of ENaC current (INa) by Cd2+ in oocytes expressing the mutants αS589C, β, γ (n = 12) (A), αS589D, β, γ (n = 6) (B), αS589N, β, γ (n = 11) (C), or αS589A, β, γ (n = 6) (D) or expressing ENaC wild-type (open symbols).

We observed that Zn2+, at similar concentrations, shows inhibition curves of INa that are superimposable to those obtained for Cd2+, indicating similar blocking kinetics for Cd2+ and Zn2+. We do not have any sound explanation for the stimulatory effect of external Zn2+ (1 mm) on ENaC wild type.FIGURE 5Time course of inhibition of ENaC current (INa) by Zn2+ in oocytes expressing αS589C, β, γ (A), α589D, β, γ (B), or αS589N, β, γ (C)(closed symbols) compared with oocytes expressing ENaC wild-type (open symbols).

Data were best fitted by the sum of two exponentials, and results are given in Table 1. n = 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Another particularity of the blockade of the αS589C mutant by Cd2+ is the slow and partial recovery from inhibition. We asked whether differences may exist in the dissociation of Cd2+ from its blocking site (off-rate) among the αS589C, αS589D, and αS589N mutants. The tracings in Fig. 6A compare the αS589C, -D, and -N mutants with respect to the recovery from amiloride and Cd2+ block. The recovery from the channel inhibition by amiloride is rapid and nearly complete, whereas the recovery from Cd2+ blockade is considerably slower and incomplete. The amount of INa recovered 2 min after removal of external Cd2+ was similar for the three αSer-589 mutants (Fig. 6C), indicating that coordination of Cd2+ at position α589 is not responsible for its slow dissociation rate. In comparison, the recovery from blockade by Cd2+ of the αS583C mutant is rapid and fully reversible (Fig. 6, B and C). These experiments further support our hypothesis that the mechanism of block of the αSer-589 mutants by Cd2+ differs from the block of the S583C that involves direct coordination with the sulfhydryl side chain of the cysteine. Residues other than Cys or Asp introduced at position αSer-589 likely participate in the channel inhibition by external Cd2+. It can be argued that mutations at αSer-589 create a novel binding site that allows inhibition of INa by Cd2+ independently of the diffusion of this cation into the pore. However, if Cd2+ has to bind within the pore in order to block the channel, this inhibition should be prevented by the pore blocker amiloride. To test this hypothesis we took advantage of the slow and partial reversibility of ENaC block by Cd2+ and measured the recovery of INa from channel inhibition by Cd2+ when amiloride was simultaneously added to the external medium. Fig. 7A shows that the INa of the αS589C, -D, and -N mutants exposed to 1 mm Cd2+ in the presence of amiloride (10 μm) in the bath solution recovered rapidly and almost completely after removal of both blockers. These experiments demonstrate that amiloride prevents the irreversible inhibition of αSer-589 mutants by Cd2+. These results are summarized in Fig. 7B in which it can be seen that the INa recovered after ENaC inhibition by amiloride and Cd2+ was identical to INa after the same control period. The interpretation of these results is that upon binding to its receptor at the external entrance of the channel pore (see Fig. 1), amiloride prevents the access of Cd2+ to its binding site located beyond that of amiloride. We conclude that in the αS589N, as in the αS589C or -D mutants, Cd2+ likely binds to cysteine residues within the channel pore at a site downstream or deeper relative to the amiloride binding site.FIGURE 6Slow and partial recovery of ENaC currents from Cd2+ block.

If Cd2+ binds within the transmembrane electric field, we expect the inhibition of αSer-589 ENaC mutants by Cd2+ to be dependent on voltage across the membrane. Fig. 8 shows the INa inhibition of the αS589N and αS589C mutants by 1 and 3 mm extracellular Cd2+ at transmembrane voltages ranging from–120 to 0 mV. Inhibition of both mutants by Cd2+, arbitrarily determined 40 s after application, was clearly dependent on voltage, with a stronger inhibition at negative holding potentials. According to Woodhull’s formulation, the slope parameter z′ is equal to the product of the actual valence of the blocking ion (2 for Cd2+) and the fraction of the electrical distance, δ, acting on Cd2+ at the binding site. The δ values of 0.34 ± 0.05 and 0.42 ± 0.05 calculated for the voltage dependence of Cd2+ block of αS589N and αS589C, respectively, represent apparent relative distances in the electric field, because they were not determined at equilibrium. Still our data clearly indicate that Cd2+ binds to a site within the transmembrane electric field that is indistinguishable for both mutants.FIGURE 8Voltage dependence of Cd2+ block in the mutants αS589C, β, γ and αS589N, β, γ.

Fin1 is a budding yeast protein that localizes to the poles and microtubules of the spindle during anaphase and contributes to spindle stability. The N-terminal half of Fin1 is phosphorylated at multiple sites by the cyclin-dependent kinase Clb5-Cdk1, and dephosphorylation in anaphase triggers its localization to the spindle. The C-terminal half of Fin1 contains coiled-coil motifs that are required for its self-association. Here we investigated the functional importance of the two regions of Fin1. Fin1 mutants lacking the C-terminal coiled-coil domains localized to spindle pole bodies but not along spindle microtubules. These mutants failed to self-associate and displayed reduced binding to microtubules in vitro but were functional in vivo and stabilized anaphase spindles when dephosphorylated. Deletion of the Fin1 C terminus suppressed the lethal phenotypes of the phospho-mutant Fin15A. Our findings suggest that the N-terminal region of Fin1 is sufficient for its regulated function as a spindle-stabilizing factor and that this function involves association with the spindle pole body.

The faithful segregation of chromosomes during mitosis requires precise regulatory control of spindle microtubule dynamics. During metaphase, microtubules exhibit high dynamic instability, which facilitates the capture of chromosomes at their kinetochores. At the onset of anaphase, microtubule dynamics are silenced, and the spindle is thereby stabilized (1Zhai Y. Kim P.J. Borisy G.G. J.

Kim K. Mitchison T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1423-1426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The change in microtubule dynamics at the onset of anaphase depends on regulated changes in the activity of proteins that influence microtubule behavior (4Higuchi T. Kim F. Nature. 2005; 433: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The budding yeast protein Fin1 is a microtubule-stabilizing factor that associates with the spindle during anaphase. The activity of Fin1 is carefully regulated during the cell cycle (5Woodbury E.L. Kim D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation in early mitosis by the cyclin-dependent kinase Clb5-Cdk1 inhibits Fin1 function and prevents its association with the spindle. Dephosphorylation in anaphase promotes its localization to the spindle, where it acts as a stability factor. A Fin1 phospho-mutant (Fin15A) localizes prematurely to the spindle, alters metaphase spindle structure, and causes lethal errors in chromosome segregation (5Woodbury E.L. Kim D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Fin1 purified from yeast self-associates to form a 10-nm-diameter filament (6van Hemert M.J. Kim G.E. Klein D.C.

Fin1-Fin1 interactions have also been demonstrated in vivo (7van Hemert M.J. Kim A.M. Molenaar C. Steensma H.Y. van Heusden G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15049-15055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 8Marino-Ramirez L. Kim J.C. Yeast. 2002; 19: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Oligomerization of Fin1 is mediated by sequences in the C-terminal portion of the protein, which are predicted to form coiled-coils (9Lupas A. Kim M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3458) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Fin1 filaments provide structural support to the mitotic spindle, but the importance of Fin1 self-association for spindle stability is unknown (10Bloom K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4757-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 11Johansen K.M. Kim J. Cell Cycle. 2002; 1: 312-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We tested the importance of Fin1 self-association by analyzing the properties of a series of Fin1 truncations. We found that deletion of the predicted coiled-coil regions in the Fin1 C terminus blocked self-association, eliminated Fin1 localization to spindle microtubules, and lowered the affinity of Fin1 for microtubules in vitro. Deletion of the predicted coiled-coil domains suppressed the lethality of the Fin1 phospho-mutant and prevented its effects on metaphase spindle structure. However, the N-terminal region of Fin1 was sufficient to target the protein to spindle poles, where it functioned to stabilize the spindle despite the absence of the coiled-coil domains. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—All strains were derivatives of W303 and grown at 30 °C unless otherwise noted. Plasmid p416GALS was used to express Fin1-GFP 2The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; SPB, spindle pole body; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; HA, hemagglutinin; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; TEV, tobacco etch virus. proteins under the control of the GALS promoter, an attenuated version of the GAL promoter (12Mumberg D. Kim R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Plasmid p414ADH was used to express Fin1-GFP proteins under the control of the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) promoter (13Mumberg D. Kim R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Protein Analysis—Protein extracts for immunoblots were prepared as described (14Ubersax J.A. Kim E.L. Quang P.N. Paraz M. Blethrow J.D. Shah K. Shokat K.M. Morgan D.O. Nature. 2003; 425: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation, 50 ml of cells were grown to log-phase and lysed by bead-beating two times for 1 min in 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin. Protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) were preincubated with anti-GFP antibody for 30 min at 4 °C and then washed with lysis buffer. Protein extract (1 mg) was incubated with the bead mixture for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and then resuspended in protein sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Fin1-3HA was detected with the 16B12 antibody (Covance Laboratories Inc.) at 1:1000, and Fin1-GFP was detected with the anti-GFP antibody clones 7.1 and 13.1 (Roche Applied Science) at 1:1000. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed overnight at 4 °C in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 3.7% formaldehyde. After fixation, immunofluorescence was performed as described (15Ayscough K.R. Kim D.G. Celis J. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, New York1998: 477-485Google Scholar). The anti-tubulin antibody YOL134 (AbCam Ltd.) was used at 1:500, and the anti-Tub4 antibody was used at 1:500. Anti-rat Cy3 and anti-rabbit Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used at 1:1000. Images were captured with a Hamamatsu Orca-AG camera on a Zeiss Axiovert 2000MAT microscope with a ×63 objective lens, using Image Pro Plus 5.1 software. Microtubule Binding Assays—Microtubule binding was analyzed as described previously (5Woodbury E.L. Kim D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). That is, purified Fin11–152-His6 was incubated with serially diluted taxol-stabilized microtubules in BRB80 buffer (80 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA) for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was centrifuged at 90,000 rpm for 10 min at 22 °C. Supernatant and pellet were separated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Subcellular Localization of Fin1 Mutants—Fin1 is a 291-amino-acid protein that contains two putative coiled-coil domains near its C terminus. The N-terminal half of Fin1 is a regulatory region that contains five consensus Cdk1 phosphorylation sites and a destruction box (D-box), which is required for anaphase-promoting complex-mediated proteolysis of Fin1 (Fig. 1A) (5Woodbury E.L. Kim D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To determine which regions of Fin1 are required for its spindle association, we expressed a series of truncations fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the inducible GALS promoter in fin1Δ cells. During anaphase, wild-type Fin1-GFP localizes along spindle microtubules and as two foci at the spindle poles. Fin11–197-GFP and Fin11–152-GFP, which lack the C-terminal coiled-coil domains but contain all five Cdk1 phosphorylation sites, appeared diffuse in the nucleus and as foci near spindle poles but were not detected on spindle microtubules (Fig. 1B). Further truncation of the C terminus (Fin11–132-GFP) caused an increase in the cytoplasmic GFP signal and a reduction of the signal near the spindle pole body (SPB). Fin140–152-GFP localization was similar to that of Fin11–132-GFP. Fin1132–291-GFP, which contains the predicted coiled-coil domains but not the regulatory domain, localized diffusely in the nucleus and never appeared at the spindle poles or along the length of the spindle (Fig. 1B). Expression of each mutant in wild-type cells yielded similar results, indicating that the presence of endogenous Fin1 has no effect on the localization of the mutants (data not shown). These results indicate that both the C-terminal and the N-terminal regions of Fin1 are required for its association with spindle microtubules but that amino acids 1–152 are sufficient to target Fin1 to spindle poles. Kinetochores, the sites of microtubule attachment to chromosomes, cluster near the spindle poles during anaphase (16Guacci V. Kim E. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, the Fin1 foci we saw could represent Fin1 at the SPB and/or the kinetochore. To determine whether the appearance of Fin1 dots depends on kinetochore function, we compared the localization of Fin15A in wild-type cells with that in cells expressing a temperature-sensitive version of Ndc10 (ndc10-1), an essential kinetochore component (17Goh P.Y. Kim J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Kinetochore structure is extensively disrupted at the restrictive temperature in this mutant. Expression of Fin15A in these cells allowed us to analyze Fin1 foci in both metaphase and anaphase. Wild-type and ndc10-1 cells were synchronized in G1 at 23 °C and released at 37 °C in the presence of galactose to induce expression of Fin15A-GFP. Cells were harvested 60 and 90 min after release and prepared for visualization of Fin1 localization and immunostaining of tubulin and γ-tubulin (Tub4) to visualize spindles and SPBs, respectively. Fin15A-GFP co-localized with SPBs (Fig. 2A) and spindle microtubules (data not shown) during metaphase and anaphase in wild-type cells. Expression of Fin15A had an unexpected effect on spindles in ndc10-1 cells. SPBs were unseparated, spindles were unassembled, and astral microtubules were elongated. This phenotype is similar to that seen when Fin15A is overexpressed in metaphase-arrested cells (5Woodbury E.L. Kim D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 7B below), suggesting that these Fin15A effects are accentuated in the absence of kinetochores. In any case, Fin15A co-localized with SPBs and microtubules in these cells, suggesting that Fin1 localizes to SPBs and microtubules independent of kinetochore function.FIGURE 7Suppression of Fin1 phospho-mutant phenotypes. A, cells carrying an empty vector or a vector with the indicated FIN1 form under the control of the GALS promoter were grown to A600 = 0.1 and serially diluted 2-fold. Cells were plated onto medium containing either glucose or galactose. B, MET-CDC20 fin1Δ cells carrying the indicated FIN1 form under the control of the GALS promoter were arrested by Cdc20 depletion for 2.5 h followed by the addition of galactose for 4 h. Cells were harvested and prepared for tubulin immunofluorescence (top). The number of cells with abnormal spindles was measured (bottom; 100 cells counted for each mutant). 5A, Fin15A; 1–197-5A, Fin11–197-5A; 1–152-5A, Fin11–152-5A; 1–132-4A, Fin11–132-4A; 40–152-4A, Fin140–152-4A; 132–291-1A, Fin1132–291-1A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also investigated the localization of Fin1 truncations in ndc10-1 cells. Unlike Fin15A, Fin1 truncations had no effect on spindle structure in ndc10-1 cells. Fin11–197-5A-GFP formed foci that co-localized with SPBs in wild-type and ndc10-1 cells (Fig. 2B). Fin11–152-GFP displayed a similar localization pattern (data not shown). Fin1-Fin1 Interactions Require the C-terminal Coiled-Coil Domain—The C terminus of Fin1 has been characterized as a self-association domain (7van Hemert M.J. Kim A.M. Molenaar C. Steensma H.Y. van Heusden G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15049-15055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 8Marino-Ramirez L. Kim J.C. Yeast. 2002; 19: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To confirm that Fin1 interacts with itself, we performed co-immunoprecipitations from a strain carrying two different epitope-tagged versions of Fin1. Fin1 was tagged at the C terminus with triple hemagglutinin epitopes (3HA) or with GFP. Tagged Fin1 proteins were co-expressed in fin1Δ cells, and protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody. Anti-GFP immunoprecipitates contained Fin1-3HA, confirming that Fin1 self-associates in vivo (Fig. 3). Truncation of the predicted coiled-coil domains eliminated the interaction of Fin1 mutants with full-length Fin1. A mutant containing the coiled-coil domains (Fin1132–291) maintained the ability to associate with full-length Fin1. Together with the localization data, these results suggest that Fin1 self-association is required for Fin1 localization to spindle microtubules but not to SPBs. The Fin1 C Terminus Contributes to Fin1 Affinity for Microtubules—The localization of Fin1 truncations to SPBs but not spindle microtubules suggested that deletion of the C terminus might lower the affinity of Fin1 for microtubules. To test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of recombinant Fin11–152-His6 to bind purified, taxol-stabilized microtubules in vitro. In our previous work, we showed that full-length Fin1 binding to microtubules was half-maximal between 0.13 and 0.25 μm tubulin (5Woodbury E.L. Kim D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Fin11–152-His6 retained some ability to bind microtubules, but affinity was reduced significantly, resulting in half-maximal binding between 0.5 and 1.0 μm tubulin (Fig. 4). These results, along with the self-association data, suggest that amino acids 1–152 contain a weak microtubule-binding domain but that full microtubule binding requires the C terminus, perhaps because Fin1 oligomerization enhances microtubule binding. Functional Analysis of Fin1 Truncations—Deletion of FIN1 is synthetic lethal with deletion of ASE1 (18Tong A.H. Kim G. Bader G.D. Ding H. Xu H. Xin X. Young J. Berriz G.F. Brost R.L. Chang M. Chen Y.

Science. 2004; 303: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar), which encodes a protein that contributes to anaphase spindle stability by cross-linking microtubules at the spindle midzone (19Schuyler S.C. Kim J.Y. Pellman D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To assess the functionality of Fin1 truncations, we tested whether they could support growth as the only copy of Fin1 in ase1Δ cells. We constructed a fin1Δase1Δ strain that is viable due to the presence of a URA3-marked plasmid that expresses FIN1 from its own promoter. We expressed Fin1 truncations from the constitutive ADH promoter in these cells and then assessed cell viability on medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), which selects against the FIN1-URA3 plasmid. Fin11–197 and Fin11–152 supported robust colony growth on 5-FOA, indicating that these mutants retain Fin1 function (Fig. 5A). A small number of colonies survived on 5-FOA when Fin11–132 was the only copy of Fin1, suggesting that this mutant is partially functional. Cells expressing Fin140–152 or Fin1132–291 could not survive in the absence of full-length Fin1. To exclude the possibility that differences in the functionality of the mutants were caused by variations in expression, we analyzed the levels of the mutant proteins by immunoblotting. Mutant proteins were expressed at levels higher than those of full-length Fin1 but similar to each other (Fig. 5B). We next assessed the ability of Fin1 truncations to stabilize spindles in an artificial anaphase system (4Higuchi T. Kim F. Nature. 2005; 433: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 20Uhlmann F. Kim D. Poupart M.A. Koonin E.V. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2000; 103: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). In this assay, cells are arrested in metaphase by depletion of Cdc20, an essential activator of the anaphase-promoting complex. Sister chromatid separation is induced by expression of TEV protease, which cleaves an engineered site in Scc1, a protein required to maintain sister chromatid cohesion. Anaphase ensues, but chromosome movements and spindle elongation occur abnormally, and spindles in these cells eventually break. These defects are thought to result because Cdk phosphorylation inhibits the activity of important anaphase spindle-stabilizing factors in this arrest (4Higuchi T. Kim F. Nature. 2005; 433: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 21Pereira G. Kim E. Science. 2003; 302: 2120-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Expression of non-phosphorylated Fin1 (Fin15A) reduces the frequency of spindle breakage in these cells, whereas expression of Fin1, which remains phosphorylated, has no effect (5Woodbury E.L. Kim D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We found that Fin11–197-5A and Fin11–152-5A promoted spindle stability in this system, although to a lesser extent than full-length Fin1 (Fig. 6). Fin11–152 also partially stabilized spindles, indicating that this mutant is not properly regulated by phosphorylation. This mutant lacks a KXL motif that is important for interaction with Clb5-Cdk1 (22Loog M. Kim D.O. Nature. 2005; 434: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and might therefore be incompletely phosphorylated. Spindle-stabilizing activity was lost in mutants with further deletion of either the N terminus or the C terminus. Deletion of the Fin1 C Terminus Suppresses Fin15A Phenotypes—Proper regulation of Fin1 phosphorylation state is required for cellular viability; expression of Fin15A from the GALS promoter is lethal. However, expression of the truncated Fin1 mutants from the GALS promoter had no effect on cell viability (Fig. 7A). The Fin15A C terminus is therefore required for its lethal effects. Overexpression of Fin15A in metaphase-arrested cells causes striking defects in metaphase spindle structure (5Woodbury E.L. Kim D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These spindle defects likely contribute to the lethality of Fin15A. Since truncation of Fin15A suppressed its lethality, we hypothesized that Fin1 truncations would have no effect on metaphase spindle structure. We arrested cells in metaphase by depletion of Cdc20 and then induced Fin15A or truncated Fin1 phosphomutants from the GALS promoter. After 3.5 h, expression of full-length Fin15A caused spindles to collapse and astral microtubules to elongate (Fig. 7B), as in our previous work (5Woodbury E.L. Kim D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A small percentage of cells expressing Fin11–197-5A or Fin11–152-5A contained these abnormal microtubule structures, but the majority of metaphase spindles appeared normal. Metaphase spindle structure was unaffected in cells expressing any of the other Fin1 mutants. We conclude that the N-terminal half of Fin1 (amino acids 1–152) is sufficient for Fin1 localization to spindle poles and for its normal function as a stabilizer of the anaphase spindle. Phosphorylation sites within this region ensure that the spindle-stabilizing effects of the Fin1 N terminus are limited to anaphase. The Fin1 C terminus promotes self-association but is not essential for the spindle-stabilizing function of Fin1. This region is required for high affinity binding of Fin1 to microtubules in vitro and for the localization of Fin1 to spindle microtubules in vivo. The C-terminal region is also required for the deleterious effects of the Fin1 phospho-mutant. We speculate that coiled-coil-dependent assembly of Fin1 into dimers or higher order multimers generates multivalent Fin1-microtubule interactions that enhance microtubule binding and bundling. This behavior is not required for the normal function of Fin1 in anaphase but may result in lethal spindle defects when the Fin15A phospho-mutant interacts with the spindle before anaphase. Regulated changes in the behavior of spindle microtubules occur as cells progress through the cell cycle. Microtubules are highly dynamic in metaphase, but this behavior is silenced at anaphase onset. Our work suggests that Fin1 activity at the spindle pole contributes to the stabilization of microtubules during anaphase. The minus ends of microtubules are organized at spindle poles, perhaps suggesting that Fin1 affects spindle stability by changing microtubule dynamics at the minus end. The dynamic behavior of spindle microtubules in animal cells depends in part on microtubule flux, which involves microtubule depolymerization at the minus end and polymerization at the plus end. In Drosophila embryos, the poleward flux of microtubules before anaphase is thought to result from the sliding activity of a kinesin-5 motor (KLP61F) at the plus end and the microtubule-depolymerizing activity of a kinesin-13 (KPL10A) at the minus end (23Rogers G.C. Kim S.L. Schwimmer T.A. Ems-McClung S.C. Walczak C.E. Vale R.D. Scholey J.M. Sharp D.J. Nature. 2004; 427: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 24Brust-Mascher I. Kim G. Kwon M. Mogilner A. Scholey J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15938-15943Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Elongation of the spindle in anaphase B appears to result from inhibition of minus end depolymerization by kinesin-13 (24Brust-Mascher I. Kim G. Kwon M. Mogilner A. Scholey J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15938-15943Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The inhibition of flux depends on the degradation of cyclin B (24Brust-Mascher I. Kim G. Kwon M. Mogilner A. Scholey J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15938-15943Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 25Cheerambathur D.K. Kim G. Brust-Mascher I. Sommi P. Mogilner A. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 995-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Likewise, in human mitotic cells, inhibition of a kinesin-13 (Kif2A) causes a significant decrease in flux (26Ganem N.J. Kim K. Compton D.A. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1827-1832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, a change in microtubule dynamics at the minus end, which likely depends on the dephosphorylation of Cdk substrates, contributes to the elongation and stabilization of animal spindles in anaphase B. Fluorescent speckle microscopy of budding yeast spindles has revealed that microtubule assembly and disassembly occurs primarily at the plus end and that microtubule minus ends are stable (2Maddox P.S. Kim K.S. Salmon E.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). These studies were based on analyses of cytoplasmic astral microtubules and anaphase interpolar spindle microtubules, and the dynamics of metaphase spindle microtubules were not determined. It therefore remains possible that microtubule flux contributes to the dynamic behavior of microtubules during metaphase in yeast and that the recruitment of Fin1 to spindle poles accounts for the stabilization of minus ends in anaphase. Alternatively, Fin1 associated with the spindle poles might affect microtubule stability at the plus end either by traveling to the plus end itself or by recruiting plus end regulatory proteins to the spindle. Several plus end-interacting proteins are loaded onto the spindle at the poles and subsequently transported to the plus end (27Carvalho P. Kim M.L. Jr. Hoyt Pellman M.A. D. Dev.
