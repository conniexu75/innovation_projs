https://openalex.org/W2042464260,"The first mammalian examples of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter family to be characterized, hENT1 and hENT2, were passive transporters located predominantly in the plasma membranes of human cells. We now report the functional characterization of members of a third subgroup of the family, from human and mouse, which differ profoundly in their properties from previously characterized mammalian nucleoside transporters. The 475-residue human and mouse proteins, designated hENT3 and mENT3, respectively, are 73% identical in amino acid sequence and possess long N-terminal hydrophilic domains that bear typical (DE)XXXL(LI) endosomal/lysosomal targeting motifs. ENT3 transcripts and proteins are widely distributed in human and rodent tissues, with a particular abundance in placenta. However, in contrast to ENT1 and ENT2, the endogenous and green fluorescent protein-tagged forms of the full-length hENT3 protein were found to be predominantly intracellular proteins that co-localized, in part, with lysosomal markers in cultured human cells. Truncation of the hydrophilic N-terminal region or mutation of its dileucine motif to alanine caused the protein to be relocated to the cell surface both in human cells and in Xenopus oocytes, allowing characterization of its transport activity in the latter. The protein proved to be a broad selectivity, low affinity nucleoside transporter that could also transport adenine. Transport activity was relatively insensitive to the classical nucleoside transport inhibitors nitrobenzylthioinosine, dipyridamole, and dilazep and was sodium ion-independent. However, it was strongly dependent upon pH, and the optimum pH value of 5.5 probably reflected the location of the transporter in acidic, intracellular compartments.

Nucleoside and nucleobase transporters play key roles in the uptake of precursors for nucleotide synthesis by salvage pathways in a number of cell types, in particular in the bone marrow and brain (1Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 153-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). They are similarly required for the efficient cellular uptake of hydrophilic anticancer and antiviral nucleoside drugs such as gemcitabine and zidovudine (3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine, AZT) 1The abbreviations used are: AZT (zidovudine), 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine; ENT, equilibrative nucleoside transporter; hENT, human ENT; mENT, mouse ENT; GFP, green fluorescent protein; NBMPR, nitrobenzylthioinosine (6-[(4-nitrobenzyl)thio]-9-β-d-ribofuranosylpurine); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TM, putative transmembrane helix; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. 1The abbreviations used are: AZT (zidovudine), 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine; ENT, equilibrative nucleoside transporter; hENT, human ENT; mENT, mouse ENT; GFP, green fluorescent protein; NBMPR, nitrobenzylthioinosine (6-[(4-nitrobenzyl)thio]-9-β-d-ribofuranosylpurine); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TM, putative transmembrane helix; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate.

By regulating the concentration of adenosine available to cell surface purinoreceptors, transporters also influence many physiological processes, including coronary blood flow, inflammation, and neurotransmission (4Shryock J.C.

Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar).Nucleoside transport processes in mammalian cells are mediated by two families of unrelated nucleoside transporter proteins. Active, sodium-dependent nucleoside transport is found primarily in specialized epithelial tissues such as small intestine, kidney, and liver and is mediated by members of the concentrative nucleoside transporter family, also classified as the SLC28 family (6Baldwin S.A. Mackey J.R. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 216-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 7Gray J.H. Owen R.P. Giacomini K.M. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 728-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In contrast, passive nucleoside transport processes are almost ubiquitous and are mediated by members of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) family, also classified as the SLC29 family (5Baldwin S.A. Beal P.R. Yao S.Y.M. King A.E. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 6Baldwin S.A. Mackey J.R. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 216-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). This family is widely distributed in eukaryotes and, despite its name, includes examples of active, proton-linked transporters, such as those of the kinetoplastid protozoa (8Landfear S.M. Ullman B. Carter N.S. Sanchez M.A. Eukaryotic Cell. 2004; 3: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Family members are predicted to share a common topology of 11 transmembrane (TM) α-helices, with a cytoplasmic N terminus and extracellular C terminus, and typically possess a large cytoplasmic loop linking TM6 and -7 (9Hyde R.J. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 53-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Direct experimental evidence for this topology has been obtained in the case of the archetypal family member hENT1 (10Sundaram M. Yao S.Y.M. Ingram J.C. Berry Z.A. Abidi F. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45270-45275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).The human and rodent genomes encode four ENT isoforms, designated ENT1–4 (5Baldwin S.A. Beal P.R. Yao S.Y.M. King A.E. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The best characterized of these isoforms, ENT1 and ENT2, are broad selectivity equilibrative nucleoside transporters that have been classified, on the basis of their sensitivity to inhibition by nitrobenzylthioinosine (nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside; NBMPR), as es (equilibrative-sensitive) or ei (equilibrative-insensitive), respectively (6Baldwin S.A. Mackey J.R. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 216-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The two human isoforms also differ in their sensitivities to inhibition by coronary vasodilators such as dipyridamole, dilazep, and draflazine, with hENT1 being ∼100–1000-fold more sensitive than hENT2 (5Baldwin S.A. Beal P.R. Yao S.Y.M. King A.E. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 11Visser F. Vickers M.F. Ng A.M.L. Baldwin S.A.

Although the transporters exhibit similar selectivities for natural nucleosides, hENT2 differs from hENT1 in that it transports antiviral 3′-deoxynucleosides, in particular AZT (12Yao S.Y. Ng A.M.L. Sundaram M. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and a wide range of purine and pyrimidine nucleobases (13Crawford C.R.

Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 53-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a fourth human ENT isoform, hENT4, has been identified by genome data base analysis (15Acimovic Y. Coe I.R. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 2199-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the latter has recently been characterized as a low affinity monoamine, rather than a nucleoside, transporter and has been alternatively designated plasma membrane monoamine transporter, PMAT (16Engel K. Zhou M. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50042-50049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), although we have shown that the mouse homologue is in fact capable of adenosine transport (5Baldwin S.A. Beal P.R. Yao S.Y.M. King A.E. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). In contrast to hENT4, the functional properties of hENT3 have not yet been described. In light of the presence of a long (51 residues), hydrophilic N-terminal region preceding TM1, which possesses a putative dileucine-based targeting motif, we previously suggested that hENT3 might function intracellularly, as is the case for the yeast homologue FUN26 (9Hyde R.J. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 53-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Vickers M.F. Yao S.Y. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25931-25938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the present study we have confirmed this hypothesis by examining the effect of mutating the targeting motif on the subcellular location of hENT3 and have shown that the transporter is indeed intracellular and partially co-localizes with lysosomal markers. Relocation of the hENT3 to the cell surface in the absence of the motif has allowed detailed characterization of its functional properties when expressed in Xenopus oocytes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Expression Vectors Encoding hENT3 and mENT3—We have previously reported the identification and sequencing of cDNA clones encoding hENT3 (GenBank™ accession code AF326987) and mENT3 (GenBank™ accession code AF326986) (9Hyde R.J. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 53-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For Xenopus expression of the latter, a 2055-bp region of mENT3 cDNA (nucleotides 31–2085) was amplified using primers bearing 5′EcoRI and HindIII sites, respectively, and subcloned using these sites into the Xenopus expression vector pGEMHE (18Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). The resultant construct, pGEMHE-mENT3, contained the entire coding region of the mENT3 cDNA flanked by 29 bp of untranslated 5′-nucleotide sequence and 598 bp of untranslated 3′-sequence. A construct (pGEMHE-mENT3AA) encoding a mutant in which the putative dileucine motif residues Leu-31 and Leu-32 had been mutated to alanine was produced from pGEMHE-mENT3 using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). To generate an expression construct lacking the putative N-terminal lysosomal targeting sequence, the 1918-bp region corresponding to nucleotides 168–2085 of the mENT3 cDNA was amplified from pGEMHE-mENT3 using primers again bearing 5′-EcoRI and HindIII sites, respectively, and subcloned using these sites into the Xenopus expression vector pGEMHE. The forward primer used for this amplification, 5′-GCTCGAATTCCAATAATGGACTACCCAGCCCCGGGCC-3′, also included a Kozak translation initiation sequence and an ATG initiation codon (underlined). The resultant construct, pGEMHE-mENT3ΔN, encoded residues 37–475 of mENT3 plus 598 bp of untranslated 3′-sequence.For Xenopus expression of hENT3, a 1433-bp region of hENT3 cDNA (nucleotides 1–1433) was amplified using primers bearing 5′-EcoRI and HindIII sites, respectively, and subcloned using these sites into pGEMHE. The resultant construct, pGEMHE-hENT3, contained the entire coding region of hENT3 cDNA plus 5 bp of untranslated 5′-nucleotide sequence. A construct (pGEMHE-hENT3AA) encoding a mutant in which the putative dileucine motif residues Leu-31 and Leu-32 had been mutated to alanine was produced from pGEMHE-hENT3 using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). To generate an expression construct lacking the putative N-terminal lysosomal targeting sequence, the 1320-bp region corresponding to nucleotides 112–1433 of mENT3 cDNA was amplified from pGEMHE-hENT3 using primers again bearing 5′-EcoRI and HindIII sites, respectively, and subcloned using these sites into the Xenopus expression vector pGEMHE. The forward primer used for this amplification, 5′-GCAAGAATTCCAATAATGGACCGCCCGCCCCCTGGCC-3′, also included a Kozak translation initiation sequence and an ATG initiation codon (underlined). The resultant construct, pGEMHE-hENT3ΔN, encoded residues 37–475 of hENT3.To examine their subcellular distributions when expressed in cultured cells, the coding regions of wild-type hENT3 or of mutant transporters were inserted into the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion vector pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). The resultant constructs expressed transporters with the GFP moiety fused to their N termini. For expression of wild-type protein, the L31A,L32A mutant, and the N-terminal-truncated protein, SmaI/XbaI fragments of pGEMHE-hENT3, pGEMHE-hENT3AA, and pGEMHE-hENT3ΔN were inserted into pEGFP-C1 that had been restricted using the same enzymes, yielding constructs pSF4, pSF5, and pKB1, respectively. For expression of the wild-type hENT3 and the dialanine mutant in GFP-tagged form in Xenopus oocytes, AgeI/XbaI fragments of pSF4 and pSF5, containing the complete coding regions of the GFP·hENT3 fusions, were subcloned into pGEMHE that had been restricted with XmaI and XbaI, yielding the constructs pSF6 and pSF7, respectively.Transient Transfection of HeLa Cells—Cells grown on coverslips in 6-well plates were transfected with 1 μg of GFP·hENT3 constructs using Lipofectamine™ (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, the post-transfection cells were fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and mounted in Vectashield® medium.Fluorescence Microscopy—Antibodies against synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 267–285 of mENT3 and residues 276–294 of hENT3 (designated anti-mENT3267–285 and anti-hENT3276–294) were raised in rabbits and affinity purified using previously described procedures (19Davies A. Ciardelli T.L. Lienhard G.E. Boyle J.M. Whetton A.D. Baldwin S.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 799-808PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells cultured on coverslips were fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.6 mm KH2PO4, 2.4 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.2), quenched with 100 mm glycine in PBS, and blocked with 0.2% fish skin gelatin in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. They were then incubated for 2 h with 20 μg/ml anti-hENT3276–294 in PBS containing 0.2% fish skin gelatin and 0.1% saponin (antibody buffer). To confirm the specificity of hENT3 staining, parallel samples were stained with anti-hENT3276–294 that had been preincubated for 2 h with a 2-fold excess by weight of synthetic peptide. The subcellular distributions of endogenous hENT3 and of heterologously expressed GFP fusion proteins were assessed by simultaneously incubating cells with mouse monoclonal antibodies against CD63 (2 μg/ml; Serotec) or β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (GLT2, 1 μg/ml) (20Towler M.C. Prescott A.R. James J. Lucocq J.M. Ponnambalam S. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) or with affinity-purified sheep antibodies against TGN46 (1 μg/ml) (20Towler M.C. Prescott A.R. James J. Lucocq J.M. Ponnambalam S. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After subsequent washing with PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h with a goat anti-rabbit IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate plus goat anti-mouse IgG tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) conjugate, donkey anti-sheep Alexafluor 546 conjugate, or a TRITC-conjugate of mouse monoclonal OKT9 antibodies (20Towler M.C. Prescott A.R. James J. Lucocq J.M. Ponnambalam S. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) against the transferrin receptor, as appropriate, in antibody buffer. After being washed twice in PBS, cells were mounted in Vectashield® medium. For imaging, 20 optical sections were captured at 0.2-μm intervals with a Delta Vision® system (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA) comprising an Olympus I×70 microscope linked to a charge-coupled device camera and processed using the manufacturer's deconvolution software.Expression of mENT3 and hENT3 Constructs in Xenopus Oocytes— pGEMHE-based hENT3 and mENT3 constructs were linearized with NheI and transcribed with T7 polymerase in the presence of m7GpppG cap using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ (Ambion) transcription system. Preparation of oocytes, injection with RNA transcripts, and assays of the uptake of radiolabeled nucleosides and nucleobases (Amersham Biosciences) were as previously described, except that oocytes were incubated for 5 days prior to transport experiments (21Huang Q.Q. Harvey C.M. Paterson A.R. Cass C.E. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20613-20619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each experiment was performed at least twice on different batches of oocytes. In adenosine uptake and competition experiments, the transport buffer (100 mm NaCl (or 100 mm choline chloride), 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) contained 1 μm deoxycoformycin to inhibit adenosine deaminase activity. Unless otherwise indicated, the incubation time was 5 min and the permeant concentration was 20 μm. Apparent Km and Vmax values were determined using the Enzfitter software package (Elsevier-Biosoft, Cambridge, UK).Tissue Distribution of hENT3 mRNA—A human multiple tissue expression (MTE™) mRNA array (Clontech) was incubated with an [α-32P]dATP-labeled antisense DNA probe corresponding to residues 262–345 of hENT3, produced using a Strip-EZ™ PCR kit (Ambion). Hybridization at high stringency (68 °C) was performed using ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech) and 100 μg/ml sheared herring sperm DNA. Wash conditions were as described in the Clontech ExpressHyb user manual. Signals on exposed blots were quantified using Kodak 1D Image Analysis software with the Kodak Image Station 2000R. The signal for each dot was normalized to that for human DNA (500 ng), which was given a value of 1. Possible cross-hybridization between the hENT3 probe and other ENT family members was tested on dot blots of dilutions (100–0.05 ng of RNA) of hENT1, hENT2, hENT3, or hENT4 in vitro transcripts, using procedures for hybridization and washing described above. The results showed that the probe was specific for the hENT3 transcript under the highly stringent hybridization and washing conditions used in the analysis (data not shown).RESULTSAmino Acid Sequences of hENT3 and mENT3—The human and mouse genomes each contain four ENT family genes, designated ENT1–4 (5Baldwin S.A. Beal P.R. Yao S.Y.M. King A.E. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 15Acimovic Y. Coe I.R. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 2199-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The 475-residue hENT3 and mENT3 proteins were found to be 73% identical in amino acid sequence and exhibited between 22 and 33% identity to the other three human and mouse ENT isoforms. Although only a single ENT isoform has so far been identified in the genome of the primitive chordate Ciona intestinalis (Fig. 1A), genes encoding close homologues (51–60% amino acid sequence identity) of the two ENT3 proteins are also present in the chicken and pufferfish genomes, indicating that divergence of the ENT1, ENT2, and ENT3 isoforms was an early event in vertebrate evolution (Fig. 1A). Divergence of the ENT4 isoforms from the other three mammalian isoforms appears to predate divergence of the vertebrates from other metazoans (15Acimovic Y. Coe I.R. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 2199-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Subcellular Location of ENT3—Both the human and mouse ENT3 isoforms exhibit the characteristic signature motifs of the ENT family and are predicted to adopt the same 11-TM topology as the other mammalian isoforms, with a cytoplasmic N terminus and extracellular C terminus (9Hyde R.J. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 53-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, they differ from the other mammalian isoforms in possessing a typical (DE)XXXL(LI) endosomal/lysosomal targeting motif (22Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar) in the hydrophilic region of the sequence that precedes the first TM region. A significant function for this motif is suggested by its conservation in ENT3 sequences from pig and chicken (Fig. 1B). A dileucine motif is also found at the same position in the ENT3 homologue from the pufferfish Fugu rubripes, although this is separated from the upstream aspartate residue by 6 rather than 3 other residues (Fig. 1B).The presence of a putative lysosomal targeting motif suggested that ENT3 might function as an intracellular rather than as a cell surface transporter. To investigate this hypothesis, antipeptide antibodies against hENT3 were used to examine the distribution of the endogenous transporter in HeLa cells, which preliminary experiments had shown to contain hENT3 transcripts. On Western blots of cell lysates the affinity-purified antibodies stained a major band of apparent molecular mass ∼60 kDa (supplemental Fig. S1A), consistent with an N-glycosylated form of the transporter (predicted protein mass 51.9 kDa). Additional bands of higher and lower molecular mass probably represented oligomeric and non-glycosylated precursor forms of the transporter, respectively, as we have previously described for rENT1 (23Musa H. Dobrzynski H. Berry Z. Abidi F. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Boyett M.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). None of these bands was stained by nonspecific rabbit IgG (supplemental Fig. S1B).Treatment of fixed, permeabilized HeLa cells with affinity-purified anti-hENT3276–294 yielded a punctate intracellular staining pattern with no discernable cell surface staining (Fig. 2A). The specificity of the staining was confirmed by the profound reduction in intensity resulting from preincubation of the antibodies with synthetic peptide (Fig. 2B). The pattern of staining did not coincide with that obtained using antibodies against Golgi or endoplasmic reticulum markers (data not shown), but some co-localization with the late endosomal/lysosomal marker CD63 (24Metzelaar M.J.

HeLa cells transiently transfected with an expression construct encoding GFP-tagged hENT3 exhibited a similar pattern of punctate, intracellular GFP fluorescence with no co-localization with early endosomal (Fig. 2C), trans-Golgi network (Fig. 2D), or trans-Golgi (Fig. 2E) markers and substantial co-localization with the lysosomal marker CD63 (Fig. 2F).Fig. 2Subcellular distribution of hENT3 in HeLa cells.A and B, distribution of endogenous hENT3. HeLa cells were stained with affinity-purified anti-hENT3276–294 (green) and anti-CD63 (red) in the absence (A) or presence (B) of an excess of the hENT3 peptide antigen as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Nuclei were visualized in panels A–C, E, and F by staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, blue). DAPI was omitted from the sample in panel D to reveal any nuclear staining. The white circle highlights an area where some co-localization of hENT3 and CD63 was observed. C–F, distribution of the transporter in HeLa cells expressing GFP-tagged hENT3 (green). Cells were simultaneously stained (red) for markers of the early endosomes (EEA1) (C), the trans-Golgi network (TGN46) (D), the trans-Golgi (β-1,4-galactosyltransferase) (E), or late endosomes/lysosomes (CD63) (F).

In contrast to the intracellular distribution of fluorescence seen in HeLa cells expressing GFP·hENT3 (Fig. 3A), substantial cell surface fluorescence was evident in cells expressing either GFP·hENT3ΔN or GFP·hENT3AA (Fig. 3, B and C). Similarly, although only intracellular fluorescence was evident in Xenopus oocytes that had been injected with RNA transcripts encoding GFP·hENT3 (Fig. 3D), strong cell surface fluorescence was evident in oocytes injected with transcripts encoding GFP·hENT3AA (Fig. 3E). Oocytes injected with water alone showed no fluorescence (Fig. 3F).Fig. 3Role of the N-terminal dileucine motif in determining the subcellular distribution of hENT3.A–C, distribution of fluorescence in HeLa cells expressing GFP fusion proteins bearing wild-type hENT3 (GFP·hENT3) (A), hENT3 lacking the first 36 residues of the N-terminal region (GFP·hENT3ΔN) (B), or hENT3 in which the dileucine motif at positions 31 and 32 had been replaced by alanine residues (GFP·hENT3AA) (C).

Transport experiments were performed in Xenopus oocytes both at physiological (7.5) and acidic (5.5) pH, using both the wild-type proteins and mutants lacking the putative intracellular targeting motif. At pH 7.5 the transport activities of the wild-type and mutant human (Fig. 4) and mouse proteins (supplemental Fig. S2) were extremely low, such that the rates of adenosine uptake in RNA-injected oocytes were essentially equal to those seen in oocytes injected with water alone. In the case of wild-type mENT3, a similarly low activity was apparent at pH 5.5. (supplemental Fig. S2), but for hENT3 the rate of uptake was substantially greater than at pH 7.5 (Fig. 4). For both proteins, still larger rates of adenosine uptake were seen when the putative intracellular targeting signal was removed either by N-terminal truncation of the protein or mutation of the leucine residues of the motif to alanine (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. S2). The greatest activity was seen for the hENT3AA mutant, and this activity was essentially identical for the non-tagged form of the protein (Fig. 4) and for the form of the protein bearing an N-terminal GFP tag (GFP·hENT3AA, data"

A genomic study of E. coli was undertaken to identify other potential targets of oxygen and ArcA regulation. A group of 175 genes generated from this study and our previous study on oxygen regulation (Salmon, K., Hung, S. P., Mekjian, K., Baldi, P., Hatfield, G. W., and Gunsalus, R. P. (2003) J. Biol.

These 175 genes clustered into eight expression patterns and represent genes involved in a large number of cell processes, including small molecule biosynthesis, macromolecular synthesis, and aerobic/anaerobic respiration and fermentation. In addition, 119 of these 175 genes were also identified in our previous study of the fnr allele. A MEME/weight matrix method was used to identify a new putative ArcA-binding site for all genes of the E. coli genome. 16 new sites were identified upstream of genes in our gold standard set. The strict statistical analyses that we have performed on our data allow us to predict that 1139 genes in the E. coli genome are regulated either directly or indirectly by the ArcA protein with a 99% confidence level.

Escherichia coli thrives in the gastrointestinal tract of many warm-blooded animals as a commensal or as a pathogen depending on a strain-dependent complement of genes (2Blattner F.R. Plunkett G. II I Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6056) Google Scholar). These enteric bacteria have the ability to switch between aerobic and anaerobic growth if oxygen is limiting. In response to microenvironments in the host, each individual cell adjusts its metabolic pathways to optimize energy generation via aerobic and/or anaerobic respiration or by fermentation of simple sugars (3Gunsalus R.P. Park S.J. Res. Microbiol. 1994; 145: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Many other cellular functions also are adjusted in response to oxygen availability, such as alterations in gene expression levels of membrane-associated nutrient uptake and/or excretion systems, biosynthetic pathways, and macromolecular synthesis (3Gunsalus R.P. Park S.J. Res. Microbiol. 1994; 145: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Expression of E. coli genes involved in oxygen utilization is down-regulated as oxygen is depleted, and in a reciprocal fashion, expression of genes encoding alternative anaerobic electron transport pathways or genes needed for fermentation is switched on. Many of these metabolic transitions are controlled at the transcriptional level by the activities of the ferric nitrate reductase global regulatory protein FNR and/or the two-component ArcAB regulatory system (4Guest J.R. Attwood M.M. Machado R.S. Matqi K.Y. Shaw J.E. Turner S.L. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 5Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. Lin E.C.C. Lynch A.S. Regulation of Gene Expression in E. coli. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996: 362-381Google Scholar). The role of the FNR protein in the global control of E. coli gene expression has been profiled in response to anaerobiosis (1Salmon K. Hung S.P. Mekjian K. Baldi P. Hatfield G.W. Gunsalus R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29837-29855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Based on this analysis of whole genome transcription data, it was estimated that the expression of over one-third of the genes expressed during growth under aerobic conditions are altered when E. coli cells transition to an anaerobic growth state and that the expression of half of these genes is modulated either directly or indirectly by FNR. Thus, the fnr gene family was estimated to be ∼10-fold larger than the 70 members previously recognized as members of the fnr gene regulatory network (6Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. Neidhart F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1526-1549Google Scholar, 7Guest J.R. Green J. Irvine A. Spiro S. Lin E.C.C. Lynch A.S. Regulation of Gene Expression in Escherichia coli. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996: 317-342Crossref Google Scholar). The ArcAB (aerobic respiratory control) two-component regulatory system is recognized as a second global regulator of anaerobic gene regulation (3Gunsalus R.P. Park S.J. Res. Microbiol. 1994; 145: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 6Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. Neidhart F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1.

The ArcAB system is composed of a classical OmpR-like receiver regulator, ArcA, and a membrane-associated sensor transmitter protein, ArcB (6Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. Neidhart F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1526-1549Google Scholar). Together, these components have been shown to regulate expression of oxygen-requiring pathways, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle (e.g. sdhCDAB, icd, fumA, mdh, gltA, acnA, and acnB), and the aerobic cytochrome oxidase complexes (9Park S.J.

ArcAB is also known to be required for proper expression of certain catabolic genes for pyruvate utilization and sugar fermentation (19Drapal N. Sawers G. Mol.

In this genome-based study, we have identified additional E. coli genes under oxygen control that are differentially expressed in response to the ArcA global regulatory protein. This was accomplished by the use of DNA microarrays to analyze gene expression profiles in E. coli cells cultured at steady-state growth rates under aerobic (+O2) or anaerobic (-O2) growth conditions and in cells cultured under anaerobic growth conditions in the presence (-O2, +ArcA) or absence (-O2, -ArcA) of the ArcA protein or in otherwise arcA+ and arcA- isogenic strains. These experiments show that about one-half of the genes whose expression levels are affected by aerobic to anaerobic transitions are also affected by the ArcA protein. Thus, the number of E. coli genes differentially regulated by the ArcA protein is much larger than the 30 (5Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. Lin E.C.C. Lynch A.S. Regulation of Gene Expression in E. coli. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996: 362-381Google Scholar) or 100 (22Liu X. De Wulf P. J. Biol.

The results of the gene expression profiling experiments further show that as many as two-thirds of the genes whose expression levels are affected by the ArcA protein are also affected by the FNR protein (1Salmon K. Hung S.P. Mekjian K. Baldi P. Hatfield G.W. Gunsalus R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29837-29855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).

Chem. 2002; 277: 40309-40323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Total RNA Isolation, cDNA Synthesis, and Target Labeling Conditions—Total RNA was isolated from 10-ml cultures; cDNA was synthesized and labeled with [α-33P]dCTP; and filters were hybridized exactly as described by Hung et al. (25Hung S.P. Baldi P. Hatfield G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40309-40323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Stripping and reusing filters four times as described here results in a <3% increase in variance (26Baldi P. Hatfield G.W. DNA Microarrays and Gene Expression: From Experiments to Data Analysis and Modeling. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2002Crossref Google Scholar). Data Acquisition—The commercial software package DNA Array-Vision obtained from Research Imaging Inc. was used to grid the 16-bit image file obtained from a PhosphorImager, to record the pixel density of each of the 18,432 addresses on each filter, and to perform the background subtractions. 8580 of the addresses on each filter were spotted with duplicate copies of each of the 4290 E. coli open reading frames (ORFs). The remaining 9852 empty addresses were used for background measurements. Because the backgrounds were constant, a global average background measurement was subtracted from each experimental measurement, although local background calculations are possible. Experimental Design—The experiments described here (Fig. 1) were performed at the same time as our previously reported experiments profiling gene expression levels in the presence or absence of oxygen and FNR (1Salmon K. Hung S.P. Mekjian K. Baldi P. Hatfield G.W. Gunsalus R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29837-29855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The data for strain MC4100 (ArcA+) grown aerobically (Experiment 1, Filters 1 and 2) and anaerobically (Experiment 2, Filters 3 and 4) have been reported by Salmon et al. (1Salmon K. Hung S.P. Mekjian K. Baldi P. Hatfield G.W. Gunsalus R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29837-29855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). For Experiment 3, Filters 5 and 6 were hybridized with random hexamer-generated 33P-labeled cDNA fragments complementary to each of three independently prepared RNA preparations (RNA 25–27) obtained from three individual cultures of strain PC35 (arcA-) grown under anaerobic conditions. These three 33P-labeled cDNA target preparations were pooled prior to hybridization to the full-length ORF probes on the filters (Experiment 3, Replicate 1, Filters 5 and 6). Following PhosphorImager analysis, these filters were stripped and again hybridized with pooled 33P-labeled cDNA target fragments complementary to each of another three independently prepared RNA preparations (RNA 28–30) from the same strain (PC35; Experiment 3, Replicate 2). This procedure was repeated one more time with Filters 5 and 6 with yet another independently prepared pool of cDNA targets (Experiment 3, Replicates 3; RNA 31–33). The data for the fourth replicate of this experiment were lost. This experimental design produced duplicate filter data for four replicates performed with cDNA targets complementary to four independent sets of pooled RNA preparations for Experiments 1 and 2. Thus, because each filter contained duplicate spots for each ORF and duplicate filters were used for each experiment, a total of 16 measurements were obtained, four measurements for each ORF from each of four replicates. Duplicate filter data were obtained for three replicates performed with cDNA targets complementary to three independent sets of pooled RNA preparations for Experiment 3. Thus, because each filter contained duplicate spots for each ORF and duplicate filters were used for each experiment, a total of 12 measurements were obtained, four measurements for each ORF from each of three replicates. Statistical Analyses—Data processing and statistical methods implemented in the Cyber-T software used for the analysis and interpretation of the data obtained from the DNA microarray experiments described in this study were the same as those described previously by Salmon et al. (1Salmon K. Hung S.P. Mekjian K. Baldi P. Hatfield G.W. Gunsalus R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29837-29855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). For each target signal, a background subtracted estimate of the expression level was obtained and scaled to total counts on the membrane by dividing each individual gene expression value by the total of all target signals on the membrane. Thus, each normalized gene level is expressed as a fraction of the total mRNA hybridized to each DNA array. For any given measurement, a value greater than zero (indicating an expression level) or a zero (indicating an expression level lower than background) was obtained. Only those genes exhibiting an expression level greater than zero in all replicates were used for statistical analysis. These gene expression level measurements were analyzed by a regularized t test based on a Bayesian statistical framework (25Hung S.P. Baldi P. Hatfield G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40309-40323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 26Baldi P. Hatfield G.W.

For analysis of the data reported here, we ranked the mean gene expression levels of the replicate experiments in ascending order, used a sliding window of 101 genes, and assigned the average S.D. of the 50 genes ranked below and above each gene as the Bayesian S.D. for that gene. The p values for each gene measurement based on a regularized t test with a confidence value of 10 are reported in the Supplemental Material. A comprehensive discussion of the use of a regularized t test and the modifications applicable to the analysis of DNA microarray data of the type presented here is described in detail elsewhere (26Baldi P. Hatfield G.W. DNA Microarrays and Gene Expression: From Experiments to Data Analysis and Modeling. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2002Crossref Google Scholar). Gene measurements containing zero expression values in one or more replicates were set aside. Among this set of genes, those with zero expression values for all replicates in one experiment and all values greater than zero for all measurements of another experiment were identified. Because these gene measurements could not be analyzed with a t test, the significance of these results was evaluated by ranking these genes in ascending order according to their coefficients of variance of the four greater than zero measurements of each experiment. Cyber-T employs a mixture model-based method described by Allison et al. (30Allison D.B. Gadbury G.L. Heo M. Fernndez J.R. Lee C.K. Prolla T.A. Weindruch R. Comput. Stat. Data Anal. 2002; 39: 1-20Crossref Google Scholar) for the computation of the global false positive and false negative levels inherent in a DNA microarray experiment (25Hung S.P. Baldi P.

DNA Microarrays and Gene Expression: From Experiments to Data Analysis and Modeling. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2002Crossref Google Scholar). With this method, described by Hung et al. (25Hung S.P. Baldi P. Hatfield G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40309-40323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we estimated the rates of false positives and false negatives as well as true positives and true negatives at any given p value threshold. In other words, we obtained a posterior probability of differential expression PPDE(p) value for each gene measurement and a PPDE(<p) value at any given p value threshold based on the experiment-wide global false positive level and the p value exhibited by that gene (25Hung S.P. Baldi P. Hatfield G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40309-40323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 26Baldi P. Hatfield G.W.

In most instances, PPDE(<p) values are reported below and Tables I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII.

https://openalex.org/W2146965330,"Recent studies have demonstrated that the tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10), the antagonist of the phosphosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling cascade, is susceptible to H2O2-dependent oxidative inactivation. This study describes the use of redox-engineered cell lines to identify PTEN as sensitive to oxidative inactivation by mitochondrial H2O2. Increases in the steady state production of mitochondrial derived H2O2, as a result of manganese superoxide dismutase (Sod2) overexpression, led to PTEN oxidation that was reversed by the coexpression of the H2O2-detoxifying enzyme catalase. The accumulation of an oxidized inactive fraction of PTEN favored the formation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate at the plasma membrane, resulting in increased activation of Akt and modulation of its downstream targets. PTEN oxidation in response to mitochondrial H2O2 enhanced PI3K signaling, leading to increased expression of the key regulator of angiogenesis, vascular endothelial growth factor. Overexpression of PTEN prevented the H2O2-dependent increase in vascular endothelial growth factor promoter activity and immunoreactive protein, whereas a mutant PTEN (G129R), lacking phosphatase activity, did not. Furthermore, mitochondrial generation of H2O2 by Sod2 promoted endothelial cell sprouting in a three-dimensional in vitro angiogenesis assay that was attenuated by catalase coexpression or the PI3K inhibitor LY2949002. Moreover, Sod2 overexpression resulted in increased in vivo blood vessel formation that was H2O2-dependent as assessed by the chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay. Our findings provide the first evidence for the involvement of mitochondrial H2O2 in regulating PTEN function and the angiogenic switch, indicating that Sod2 can serve as an alternative physiological source of the potent signaling molecule, H2O2.

The principal mediator of ROS-dependent signaling is the two electron reduction product of oxygen (O2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). H2O2 is generated in response to receptor stimulation and is an efficient signal transducing molecule by its ability to reversibly oxidize active site cysteines (1Rhee S.G. Chang T.S. Bae Y.S.

Until the discovery of PTEN oxidation, the only known regulation of PTEN was through phosphorylation by casein kinase-2 in the PDZ domain located in its C-terminal tail (11Vazquez F. Grossman S.R.

However, the exact source of H2O2 in response to receptor engagement is an area of controversy and may involve activation of the noninflammatory NADPH oxidase family members and subsequent spontaneous or enzymatic dismutation of superoxide ( O2·¯) to H2O2 (16Lambeth J.D. Cheng G. Arnold R.S. Edens W.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 459-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The mitochondria are also a source for the generation of intracellular H2O2 under physiologic conditions (17Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2065) Google Scholar) and in response to receptor stimulation (18Werner E. Werb Z. J.

However, whether mitochondrial derived H2O2 contributes to the oxidative inactivation of PTEN or other phosphatases has not been established. In this study, we report that alterations in the steady state production of mitochondrial H2O2 by antioxidant enzyme overexpression modulate the redox state of PTEN. This mechanism is responsible for modulating PI3K/Akt signaling, VEGF production, and angiogenesis. These findings define a novel role for mitochondrial H2O2 and Sod2 in regulating the angiogenic switch via PTEN phosphatase inactivation. Cell Lines and Reagents—Human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1000 units/ml penicillin, 500 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 mg/ml neomycin, in a 37 °C humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cell lines transfected with CMV (empty vector), Sod2, and/or catalase were described in detail previously (20Rodriguez A.M. Carrico P.M. Mazurkiewicz J.E. Melendez J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Measurement of Oxidation Rate in Intact Cells—Measurement of ROS levels in redox-engineered cell lines was performed using the redox-sensitive dye Redox Sensor Red™ CC-1 (Molecular Probes). Cells were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution containing 1 mm EDTA. Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 6.7 g/liter glucose to a final density of 5 × 105 cells/ml. Redox Red CC-1 was added to a final concentration of 10 μm at room temperature. Samples were analyzed in a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) at a wavelength of ∼540/600 nm. Western Blotting—Cell lysates were collected in 0.05 mm KPi buffer containing an array of phosphatase and protease inhibitors, loaded on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride. The primary Abs used included rabbit anti-human PTEN (1: 1000), phospho-PTEN (1:1000), Akt (1:1000), phospho-Akt (1:1000), GSK3-β (1:1000), phospho-GSK3-β (1:1000) (Cell Signaling), VEGF (1: 1000), and HIF-1α (1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). This was followed by an incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000) (Amersham Biosciences) as the secondary Ab. Antibodies were used according to manufacturer's recommendations. 30 μg of protein was loaded per well with the exception of Akt (50 μg). The primary was applied overnight in 5% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C. Identification of Reduced and Oxidized PTEN by Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were harvested in PBS/EDTA, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in 0.2 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 2% SDS and 40 mmN-ethylmaleimide; 30 μg of protein per cell line was subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions as described previously (7Lee S.R. Yang K.S. Kwon J. Lee C. Jeong W. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20336-20342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). The separated proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and immunoblotted with a rabbit anti-PTEN 1°Ab (1:1000). Immune complexes were detected by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated 2°Ab (1:10,000) (Amersham Biosciences) and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). Sod Zymography—Lysates from cell lines were harvested in 0.005 m potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.8 containing 0.1 mm EDTA. Lysate supernatants were analyzed by electrophoresis in a discontinuous polyacrylamide gel, consisting of a 5% stacking gel (pH 6.8) and 10% running gel. The gel was stained with a solution containing 2.5 mm nitro blue tetrazolium, 0.008 mm riboflavin, 30 mm TEMED, and 0.005 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 0.1 mm EDTA, was incubated for 15 min in the dark at room temperature, and was washed twice in deionized water. The gels were then exposed to fluorescent light until clear zones of SOD activity were evident. 5′-Fluoresceinated Iodoacetamide (5-IAF) Labeling—Cells were lysed in 0.05 mm KPi buffer at pH 7.0 containing 10 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma). Samples were rocked at room temperature in the dark for 10 min, and free cysteines were blocked at this step. Lysates were then immunoprecipitated for PTEN (Sigma) by using protein G-Sepharose beads (Pierce). This step also removed any excess iodoacetamide. After immunoprecipitation, the bead-antibody-protein complex was resuspended in 200 μl of 0.05 mm KPi buffer at pH 7.0 containing 10 mm dithiothreitol (Roche Applied Science). This denatured the proteins, breaking all disulfides, thereby freeing previously oxidized cysteines. The proteins were then acetone-precipitated in order to remove the dithiothreitol. Samples were then resuspended in buffer containing 5 mm 5-IAF and were then vortexed and kept at 4 °C for 30 min. The 5-IAF (Molecular Probes) will now bind previously oxidized cysteines. Lysates were then run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to Western blot using anti-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody (Molecular Probes). Transient Transfections of hVEGF Promoter Construct and Dominant Negative Constructs—Cell lines were transfected with the various hVEGF (obtained from Dr Kenneth Anderson at Harvard Medical School and described by Tai et al. (21Tai Y.T. Podar K. Gupta D. Lin B. Young G. Akiyama M. Anderson K.C. Blood. 2002; 99: 1419-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar)). The VEGF construct and pCMV.SPORTβ-gal were cotransfected with Lipofectamine Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The cells were lysed 18 h post-transfection, and the luciferase reporter activity was determined using the Promega assay system. All of the results were reported after normalization for transfection efficiency by measuring β-galactosidase activity. In Vitro Angiogenesis Assay—The in vitro angiogenesis assay was described previously by Nakatsu et al. (22Nakatsu M.N. Sainson R.C. Perez-del-Pulgar S. Aoto J.N. Aitkenhead M. Taylor K.L. Carpenter P.M. Hughes C.C. Lab. Investig. 2003; 83: 1873-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In brief, bovine lung microvessels (BLMV) were complexed with Cytodex 3 microcarrier (Amersham Biosciences) in 1 ml of EGM-2 (Clonetics) at a concentration of 400 BLMVs per bead. The bead and cell solutions were shaken every 20 min for 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to allow the cells to bind to the beads. Following the incubation, the cell-bead complex was grown overnight in a T-25-cm2 tissue culture flask (Corning Glass) in 5 ml of EGM-2 at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After incubating, the cells were washed three times in EGM-2 and resuspended at a concentration of 200 cell-coated beads/ml in EGM-2 containing 2.5 mg/ml of fibrinogen (Sigma) with 0.15 units of aprotinin (ICN). 500 μl of the above solution was added to 0.625 units of thrombin (Sigma) in a 24-well tissue culture plate. The solution was allowed to clot for 5 min at room temperature and then at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 20 min. One milliliter of EGM-2 containing 0.15 units aprotinin was added per well and allowed to equilibrate with the clot for 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. EGM-2 was removed and replaced with 1 ml EGM-2 containing 0.15 units of aprotinin and 20,000 cells of the indicated redox-engineered cell lines (CMV, Sod2, Sod2mCAT, eGFP, and Sod2GFP). For a positive control, 2.5 ng/ml of VEGF was added to the CMV control cell line, and for a negative control, 30 μm of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was added (Calbiochem). To test if the effects were VEGF-specific, 0.16 μg/ml of a monoclonal mouse anti-human IgG2B VEGF neutralizing antibody (R & D Systems) or IgG2B isotype control antibody (Pharmingen) was added to the Sod2-overexpressing cell lines, and the effect on sprout formation was analyzed. Clots were grown for 24 h, and the number of sprouts/bead were analyzed. Images of beads were captured on a Nikon Diaphot microscope with a 4× objective. The number of sprouts per bead were counted, and all experiments were repeated 10 times with similar results. Chicken Embryo Chorioallantoic Assay—The CAM assay was performed as described previously by Brooks et al. (23Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar) with minor variations. Fertilized chicken eggs were incubated with constant rocking at 37 °C under 60% humidity. On the 9th day, the CAM was pulled away from the shell by first drilling a small shallow hole at the end of the egg that contains the natural air sac; an additional hole was made on the broad side of the egg directly over the embryonic blood vessels, as determined by candling. Gentle suction was applied to the 1st hole, thereby displacing the air sac to the side of the egg shell where the 2nd hole was made. This allowed the CAM to be pulled away from the shell on the side of the egg. A window was opened above the air pocket in the shell and sealed with a piece of sterile tape. A sterile rubber O-ring was placed on the CAM, and 2 × 105 cells in a total volume of 50 μl of PBS were placed in the center of the ring. No cells were added to the control. 24 h later the allantoic vessels around the CAM were photographed using a digital camera, five fields per egg. Vessel density was then quantified by placing a grid over the photo in Adobe Photoshop 7.0 and counting the number of vessels per field. Plasmid Constructs—The pEGFP-N1 vector was obtained from Clontech. Human Sod2 was PCR-amplified with 5′-AvaI and 3′-KpnI ends. AvaI was added 4 bp upstream of the Sod2 initiation codon and KpnI was added prior to the Sod2 termination codon and directionally inserted in-frame into the pEGFP-N1. The constitutively active myr-Akt and kinase dead (K170M) Akt DNA was kindly provided by Dr. Andrew Aplin, Albany Medical College. The wild type PTEN and phosphatase mutant (G129R) PTEN DNA were obtained from Dr. William Sellers, Harvard Medical School, and were described previously (24Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Vazquez F. Batt D.B. Perera S. Roberts T.M. Sellers W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2110-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The Akt-PH-YFP and PLCδ-PH-CFP constructs were obtained from Tobias Meyer, Stanford University. The mito-GFP construct was obtained from Yisang Yoon, University of Rochester. Confocal Microscopy—Cell cultures were imaged on an inverted LSM 510 Meta laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) by using a Plan-Apo 63 × 1.4 NA oil immersion objective. Pinhole diameter was ∼1 airy unit. (a) For cells labeled with the single fluorescence reporter YFP, the 514 laser line from an argon laser was used to excite YFP, and images were collected using an HFT 458/514 dichroic mirror and a bandpass filter of 535–590 nm at an 8-bit intensity resolution over 1024 × 1024 pixels at a pixel dwell time of 6.4 μs. (b) For cells labeled with GFP and mitoTracker Red®, the multitrack mode was used in which the 488 nm laser line from an argon laser was used to excite GFP; the 543 laser line from a HeNe laser was used to excite the mitoTracker Red®, and images were collected by using an HFT 488/543/633 dichroic mirror and a 500–530 nm bandpass filter for GFP and LP 560 nm filter for the mitoTracker Red® at a 12-bit intensity resolution over 1024 × 1024 pixels at a pixel dwell time of 3.2 μs. (c) For cells labeled with the fluorescence reporter combinations of CFP/GFP or GFP/YFP, images were collected at a 12-bit intensity resolution over 1024 × 1024 pixels at a pixel dwell time of 3.2 μs by using spectral imaging followed by linear unmixing to separate the fluorescence contribution of each fluorescent protein on a pixel by pixel basis (25Dickinson M.E.

Opt. 2001; 6: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A series of λ stack X-Y images was collected using the Zeiss META detector over a spectrum of wavelengths between 462 and 633 nm with bandwidths of 10.7 nm during excitation with the 458 nm laser line and a HFT458 dichroic mirror for the CFP/GFP pair. For the GFP/YFP pair, a spectrum of wavelengths between 494 and 633 nm with bandwidths of 10.7 nm was collected during excitation with the 488 nm laser line and an HFT 488 dichroic mirror. Reference λ stack images were collected and stored for each of the fluorescence reporters alone to provide spectral signatures for GFP, YFP, and CFP that were used in the linear unmixing procedure. For time lapse studies, images were captured at 512 × 512 pixels, one image every 15 s for a total of 5 min. The Zeiss LSM Physiology software package and Microsoft Excel were used to analyze the time-lapse data. Statistics—Analysis of variance with α = 0.05 was used for processing the data. A two-sample t test was used as post-test unless otherwise indicated. Analysis of Redox Engineered Cells—To define molecular targets that are sensitive to alterations in the mitochondrial production of H2O2, we have developed a line of redox-engineered HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cell lines using antioxidant enzyme-based expression systems. We have focused our analyses on six redox-engineered cell lines that have been thoroughly characterized in terms of their antioxidant and oxidant profile (20Rodriguez A.M. Carrico P.M. Mazurkiewicz J.E. Melendez J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 27Ranganathan A.C. Nelson K.K. Rodriguez A.M. Kim K.H. Tower G.B. Rutter J.L.

Enforced expression of mitochondrial manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (Sod2) led to a significant increase in intracellular H2O2, which was reversed by cytosolic or mitochondrial expression of catalase (Fig. 1A). Sod2 overexpression led to a 2-fold increase in the rate of oxidation of the H2O2-responsive fluorophore Redox-Red™ that was attenuated upon catalase coexpression (Fig. 1A). Sole catalase overexpression also decreased the basal rate of Redox-Red™ oxidation. These findings demonstrated that the enhanced rate of oxidation was attributed to the Sod2-dependent increases in the steady state production of H2O2 that was subsequently reversed upon expression of the H2O2-detoxifying enzyme catalase. Redox-dependent Oxidation of PTEN—PTEN is a dual specificity phosphatase that is reversibly sensitive to inactivation by H2O2 (7Lee S.R. Yang K.S. Kwon J. Lee C. Jeong W. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20336-20342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The oxidation status of PTEN resulted in the conversion of the sulfhydryl groups to a disulfide, resulting in a more compact protein structure that can be visualized under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1B) (7Lee S.R. Yang K.S. Kwon J. Lee C. Jeong W. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20336-20342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). The Sod2-dependent generation of H2O2 showed accumulation of the oxidized form of PTEN (Fig. 1B, lane 4) that was prevented by coexpression of catalase (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6). Addition of exogenous H2O2 (0.5 mm) caused a prevalent accumulation of the oxidized form of PTEN that was blocked by mitochondrial targeted catalase (Fig. 1B, lane 6). PTEN inactivation resulting from mutational loss or oxidation increased the phosphorylation of the serine-threonine kinase Akt (4Leslie N.R. Bennett D. Lindsay Y.E. Stewart H. Gray A. Downes C.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5501-5510Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 24Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Vazquez F. Batt D.B. Perera S. Roberts T.M. Sellers W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurol. 2003; 53: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Coordinate to the increase in PTEN oxidation upon Sod2 overexpression was a pronounced elevation in phosphorylation at serine 473 of Akt (Fig. 1B, lane 4), which was attenuated by the overexpression of catalase in either the cytosolic or mitochondrial compartment (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6, respectively). The substrates for Akt are numerous and are involved in regulating many diverse cellular functions, including proliferation, glucose utilization, angiogenesis, and cell survival (29Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), a negative regulator of cyclin D1, was inhibited by Akt-dependent phosphorylation. GSK3β phosphorylation was also reversibly sensitive to alterations in the steady state production of H2O2 by antioxidant enzyme overexpression (Fig. 1B). The dominant negative isoform of Akt (K179M) can prevent phosphorylation of native Akt at serine 473 (30Cheng H.L. Steinway M. Delaney C.L. Franke T.F. Feldman E.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 170: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and expression of this mutant in our Sod2 overexpressing cell line blocked the increase in Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation (Fig. 1B, lane 7). Enforced expression of a constitutively active myristoylated-Akt rescued the catalase-dependent inhibition of both Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation in the Sod2-overexpressing cell lines (Fig. 1B, lane 8). The PI3K complex was found in the plasma membrane, whereas PTEN is largely a cytoplasmic enzyme. It has been established previously that PTEN can be negatively regulated by phosphorylation of residues (Ser380, Thr382, and Thr383) in its C-terminal tail (11Vazquez F. Grossman S.R. Takahashi Y.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4985-4989PubMed Google Scholar). Given this, we sought to examine if PTEN phosphorylation was regulated in a redox-dependent manner. PTEN phosphorylation status did not change in any of our redox-engineered cell lines, indicating that its primary mode of redox regulation is through oxidation. These results suggested that reversible alterations in the steady state mitochondrial production of H2O2 modulated the redox state of PTEN and the phosphorylation state of both Akt and the downstream target GSK3β. Sod2-dependent Oxidation of PTEN and PI3K Signaling— Clonal isolation of transfected cells, as in the case of the redox-engineered cell lines, may give rise to variants whose altered signaling characteristics may be independent of the gene being studied.

https://openalex.org/W1993507992,"Decorin is a multifunctional proteoglycan that is expressed by sprouting endothelial cells. Its expression supports capillary formation and cell survival. Previously, it was shown that some effects of decorin are mediated by protein kinase B and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21. However, the cell surface receptor responsible for these effects was unknown. We demonstrate that decorin binds to the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor on endothelial cells with an affinity in the nanomolar range (KD = 18 nm), which is comparable with IGF-I (KD = 1.2 nm). Furthermore, decorin can bind IGF-I itself, but with a lower affinity (KD = 190 nm) than classical IGF-I-binding proteins. Decorin addition causes IGF-I receptor phosphorylation and activation, which is followed by receptor down-regulation. These effects are caused by the core protein of decorin, and the binding region could be mapped to the N terminus of the molecule. The physiological relevance of the decorin/IGF-I receptor interaction was corroborated in two animal models (e.g. inflammatory angiogenesis in the cornea and unilateral ureteral obstruction). In both models the IGF-I receptor was up-regulated in decorin-deficient mice compared with controls and the up-regulation could not compensate the decorin deficiency in the disease models. These data indicate that decorin is an important player in the IGF system and its loss cannot fully be compensated in different types of diseases.

Decorin is the most thoroughly investigated member of the still growing family of small leucine-rich proteoglycans. Core proteins of these proteoglycans are characterized by leucine-rich repeat motifs flanked by cysteine-rich clusters. In addition, they carry at least a single glycosaminoglycan chain. Recently, a crystal structure for bovine decorin has been published (1Scott P.G. Grossmann J.G. Dodd C.M. Sheehan J.K. Bishop P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18353-18359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that together with earlier x-ray scattering data (2Scott P.G. McEwan P.A. Dodd C.M. Bergmann E.M. Bishop P.N. Bella J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15633-15638Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) suggests that decorin is a dimeric protein with 12 leucine-rich repeat motifs that include the N- and C-terminal cysteine-rich regions. This numbering of leucine-rich repeats is subsequently used in this report. Each monomer adopts a curved structure, and an antiparallel dimerization occurs through the β-sheet on the concave surface of the monomer. Decorin has been shown to have a variety of different functions that can be mediated by the core protein as well as the glycosaminoglycan chain. It regulates collagen fibril formation and stabilization, and it modulates cell adhesion as well as transforming growth factor-β activity (for review see Refs. 3Kinsella M.G. Bressler S.L. Wight T.N.

Decorin expression in endothelial cells, hepatocytes, fibroblasts, or macrophages causes differentiation, but it does not lead to apoptosis. In contrast, it protects cells from programmed cell death (6Tralhão J.G. Schaefer L. Micegova M. Evaristo C. Schönherr E. Kayal S. Veiga-Fernandes H. Danel C. Aresta S. Iozzo R.V. Kresse H.

Blood. 2001; 98: 2124-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Endothelial cells cultured inside a collagen lattice can form capillary-like structures. We showed that both capillary formation and protection from apoptosis were only observed in decorin-synthesizing cells. A decorin-containing matrix was not sufficient to induce these changes. Adenoviral gene transfer of decorin into endothelial cells confirmed that decorin was instrumental for tube formation and cell survival (7Schönherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W. Plenz G. Vischer P. Young M.F. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The physiological and pathophysiological relevance of these observations in culture was further supported by the finding that interleukin-6 and -10, two cytokines that are released during inflammation, induce decorin synthesis in endothelial cells growing in a collagen lattice (9Strazynski M. Eble J.A. Kresse H. Schönherr E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21266-21270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These cell culture results corroborate earlier observations in vivo, where decorin was found during inflammation-induced angiogenesis, i.e. in newly formed capillaries in granulomatous tissue (7Schönherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W. Plenz G. Vischer P. Young M.F. Kresse H. Eur. J.

The importance of decorin in angiogenesis could also be demonstrated in a model of inflammatory angiogenesis in the cornea, as blood vessel growth was significantly reduced in decorin knock-out mice compared with wild-type mice (11Schönherr E. Sunderkötter C. Schaefer L. Thanos S. Grässel S. Oldberg Å. Iozzo R.V. Young M.F. Kresse H. J. Vasc. Res. 2004; 41: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, decorin signaling is involved not only in angiogenesis but also in renal inflammation and fibrosis, as enhanced apoptosis and atrophy of tubular epithelial cells as well as an increased infiltration of mononuclear cells were observed in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) 1The abbreviations used are: UUO, unilateral ureteral obstruction; Akt, protein kinase B; DCN, decorin; EGF, epithelial growth factor; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IGF-IR, IGF factor I receptor. 1The abbreviations used are: UUO, unilateral ureteral obstruction; Akt, protein kinase B; DCN, decorin; EGF, epithelial growth factor; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IGF-IR, IGF factor I receptor. in decorin-deficient mice (12Schaefer L. Macakova K. Raslik I. Micegova M. Gröne H.J. Schönherr E. Robenek H. Echtermeyer F.G. Grässel S. Bruckner P. Schaefer R.M. Iozzo R.V. Kresse H. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 1181-1191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).How decorin affects differentiation and apoptosis is not completely understood. In tumor cells, decorin binds to the epithelial growth factor (EGF) receptor or ErbB4 and leads to activation of the mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) pathway, Ca2+ influx, induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21, and subsequently to down-regulation of the receptor (13DeLuca A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 35671-35681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells decorin affects different pathways. It enhances the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and subsequently induces p21 by a MAPK-independent pathway. In addition to p21 the related cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27, is also induced, but by an Akt- and MAPK-independent mechanism (16Schönherr E. Levkau B. Schaefer L. Kresse H. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40687-40692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).In this study we have searched for potential cell surface receptors that could be involved in decorin signaling. Inhibitor studies indicated that the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) was a likely candidate. The IGF-IR is a ligand-activated tyrosine protein kinase highly homologous to the insulin receptor. It consists of a heterotetramer (α2β2) linked by disulfide bridges. Via its extracellular α2 units, the receptor binds IGF-I and IGF-II with high affinity. This interaction leads to autophosphorylation of the receptor and downstream proteins, including insulin receptor substrate-1. In the next step phosphoinositide 3-kinase is activated, which increases the levels of phosphoinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate. Phosphoinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate binds to the pleckstrin homology domains of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase I and Akt, thereby initiating the phosphorylation of Akt and several other signaling molecules such as protein kinases C and A. These signaling events finally lead to the inhibition of pro-apoptotic factors, the activation of survival factors, and cell differentiation or proliferation, depending on the cell type and tissue investigated (Ref. 17Vincent A.M. Feldman E.L. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 2002; 12: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar and references therein). The general importance of the IGF-IR is implicated by the phenotype of IGF-IR knock-out mouse, which exhibits severe growth retardation and dies at birth (18Liu J.P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 59-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2553) Google Scholar). IGF-I is mainly produced by the liver, but expression in other types of tissue has been shown (19Cohick W.S. Clemmons D.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 131-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The availability of IGF-I and IGF-II for receptor binding is regulated extracellularly by six high affinity-binding proteins and several low affinity-binding proteins. In addition, some of the IGF-binding proteins can exert biological functions independently of their role in the IGF system (20Mohan S. Baylink D.J. J. Endocrinol. 2002; 175: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar).In this report we show for the first time that decorin can bind the IGF-IR and also interacts with IGF-I itself. This interaction regulates IGF signaling and may be responsible for the retardation of angiogenesis in the cornea of decorin knock-out mice and for the atrophy in later stages of tubulointerstitial fibrosis observed after UUO in these mice.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Antibodies used were sc-713 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) against the β-chain of the IGF-IR, rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (T308), rabbit anti-Akt (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly MA), and rat anti-CD31 (ERMP12; BMA Biomedical, Augst, Switzerland). Secondary antibodies labeled with horseradish peroxidase used were porcine anti-rat immunoglobulin (DAKO, Hamburg, Germany), goat anti-rabbit-IgG (Bio-Rad), and horse anti-mouse IgG (Alexis, Grüneberg, Germany). Tyrphostin AG1048 and AG1478 were obtained from Alexis. IGF-I and chemicals not specifically indicated were purchased from Sigma. Decorin and its mutants were purified from conditioned medium from HEK-293 cells or human skin fibroblasts as previously described (21Kresse H. Liszio C. Schönherr E. Fisher L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18404-18410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The purity of the preparation was checked by sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and silver staining.Cell Culture—Cells of the permanent human endothelial cell line EA.hy 926 (22Edgell C.J. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3734-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar) were permanently grown in MCDB 131 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, hypoxanthin/aminopterin/thymidine supplement, and antibiotics (all from Invitrogen). Hydrophilic cell culture dishes (3 cm) were coated with a neutralized collagen mixture (7Schönherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W. Plenz G. Vischer P. Young M.F. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). After collagen gel formation (30 min, 37 °C), EA.hy 926 (500,000 cells) were plated on this substrate in 1 ml of Waymouth MAB 87/3 medium containing 1% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. After 5 h of culture, 1 ml of medium without serum was added. After 48 h, decorin and/or the respective inhibitors were added, and cells were harvested at the indicated times. Adenoviral infections were performed as previously described (7Schönherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W. Plenz G. Vischer P. Young M.F. Kresse H. Eur. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 40687-40692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Immunoblotting—For the detection of phosphorylated proteins, cells from a 3-cm-dish were harvested in 100 μl of cold lysis-buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm sodium vanadate, proteinase inhibitors) and sonicated. Aliquots (equal protein concentration/lane) were applied on SDS-PAGE gels. In addition, immunoprecipitations with sc-713 were carried out (described below), and precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose, proteins were detected as previously described (7Schönherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W. Plenz G. Vischer P. Young M.F. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For the detection and quantification of IGF-IR in mouse kidneys, homogenates of whole kidneys were prepared and applied to SDS-PAGE as previously described (12Schaefer L. Macakova K. Raslik I. Micegova M. Gröne H.J. Schönherr E. Robenek H. Echtermeyer F.G. Grässel S. Bruckner P. Schaefer R.M. Iozzo R.V. Kresse H. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 1181-1191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Western blots were performed using sc-713 according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. An antibody to β-tubulin was used as control for equal loading. Bands were quantified with the ImageQuant 5.0 software program (Amersham Biosciences).Binding Studies—Decorin (20 μg) and IGF-I (2 μg) were labeled with 125I[iodine] and IODO-BEADs (PerBio, Bonn, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Decorin had a specific activity of 375,000 cpm × mol–12 and IGF-I of 100,000 cpm × mol–12.Decorin (10 μg) with and without chondroitin ABC lyase digestion (Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan) was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked for 2 h with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 3% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mg/ml NaN3 and probed with 125I-IGF-I in binding buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) overnight at 4 °C. After washing with binding buffer the nitrocellulose was dried and exposed to x-ray films (X-OMAT; Kodak). A Sepharose CL-4B gel filtration column (20 cm long) was equilibrated with binding buffer with or without decorin, and 125I-IGF-I (500,000 cpm) was applied. The elution profiles were monitored by scintillation counting.To determine binding of decorin to the IGF-IR, the receptor was immunoprecipitated from EA.hy 926 cells (7 × 106 cells) with antibody sc-713. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer, and a complex of normal rabbit serum bound to protein A-Sepharose was added for 6 h to remove non-specifically binding proteins. Then 10 μg of the anti-IGF-IR were added, and after 16 h the antibodies were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose. As control, a similar amount of protein A-Sepharose was incubated with the antibody but without cell lysate. After washing (3 × lysis buffer, 2 × phosphate-buffered saline), the material was divided in 7 aliquots and incubated in 250 μl of Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 with labeled decorin or IGF-I (as indicated). For competition experiments unlabeled wild type decorin or mutants were added together with the labeled molecules. Immune complexes without receptor were used as controls. After washing five times with binding buffer, bound protein was removed by boiling in 1% SDS and aliquots were counted in a scintillation counter. Dissociation constants were determined with GraphPad Prism3 software using the subroutine for fitting one site binding curves (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA).Binding of decorin to IGF-I was determined with 125I-decorin in a solid phase assay. Shortly, IGF-I (4 μg/ml, 50 μl/well) was used for coating microtiter plates (Immobilon 2; Dynatec); after blocking with Tris-buffered saline, 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20 for 4 h, labeled decorin was applied in the same buffer (4 h, 37 °C). After washing, the bound material was released and measured by scintillation counting. Dissociation constants were determined as described above.Animal Experiments—All animal work was done in accordance with the German Animal Protection Law. Decorin-deficient mice were generated as described previously (23Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis assays in mice were performed by chemical cauterization of the cornea as described (11Schönherr E. Sunderkötter C. Schaefer L. Thanos S. Grässel S. Oldberg Å. Iozzo R.V. Young M.F. Kresse H. J. Vasc. Res. 2004; 41: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The eyes were removed and fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde for paraffin embedding. Unilateral uretral obstractions were done as in previous experiments (12Schaefer L. Macakova K. Raslik I. Micegova M. Gröne H.J. Schönherr E. Robenek H. Echtermeyer F.G. Grässel S. Bruckner P. Schaefer R.M. Iozzo R.V. Kresse H. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 1181-1191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). For the quantification of the IGF-IR, whole kidneys were homogenized in 1 ml of extraction buffer (final volume), and equal volumes were applied for SDS-PAGE. The protein content/aliquot of ligated kidneys was ∼50 μg, and the protein content/aliquot of unligated kidney was ∼80 μg/lane. Equal volumes were applied because the kidneys change their weight during the procedure and equal volumes reflect more accurately the situation in the organ. Western blots were carried out as described elsewhere (12Schaefer L. Macakova K. Raslik I. Micegova M. Gröne H.J. Schönherr E. Robenek H. Echtermeyer F.G. Grässel S. Bruckner P. Schaefer R.M. Iozzo R.V. Kresse H. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 1181-1191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) with the exception that the blots were incubated with the antibody sc-713 (1:500) against IGF-IR as primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Immunohistochemistry was performed as described elsewhere (11Schönherr E. Sunderkötter C. Schaefer L. Thanos S. Grässel S. Oldberg Å. Iozzo R.V. Young M.F. Kresse H. J. Vasc. Res. 2004; 41: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 12Schaefer L. Macakova K. Raslik I. Micegova M. Gröne H.J. Schönherr E. Robenek H. Echtermeyer F.G. Grässel S. Bruckner P.

Pathol. 2002; 160: 1181-1191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).RESULTSPrevious experiments have shown that decorin can induce tube formation in endothelial cells and inhibit apoptosis. The phosphorylation of Akt was one step in the pathway(s) (16Schönherr E. Levkau B. Schaefer L. Kresse H. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40687-40692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), but the cell surface receptor for decorin in endothelial cells was unknown. To analyze how decorin activates Akt, different receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors were tested. The EGF receptor inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478 (10 μm) had no effect on decorin-induced Akt phosphorylation in endothelial cells, but preincubation with tyrphostin AG1024 (10 μm), an inhibitor of the insulin receptor and the IGF-IR tyrosine kinase, was able to inhibit Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1A) and p21 expression (result not shown).IGF-I led to a dose-dependent induction of p21 mRNA in EA.hy 926 cells after 16 h with maximal expression levels (5-fold) at a concentration of 100 ng/ml (result not shown). Therefore, 100 ng/ml IGF-I were used in the following experiments. Immunoprecipitations of the IGF-IR from endothelial cells that had been stimulated for 5 min with IGF-I or decorin, followed by Western blots with an antibody recognizing phosphotyrosine residues, showed phosphorylation of the receptor after addition of decorin or IGF-I (Fig. 1B). After normalization for the amount of IGF-IR, IGF-I increased receptor phosphorylation by 42% and decorin by 47%, respectively. Reprobing the same blot with an antibody to pY1131 of the IGF-IR indicated that the receptor tyrosine kinase was active. These data demonstrate that decorin is involved in signal transduction via the IGF system in endothelial cells.To investigate whether decorin and IGF-I interfere with each other's effects on downstream signals, two types of experiments were performed. In one type, optimal concentrations of IGF-I (100 ng/ml) and decorin (80 μg/ml) were combined and added together to endothelial cells; in the second type of experiment, cells were preincubated at 4 °C with decorin or IGF-I and then the alternative ligand was added for 10 min at 37 °C. Neither of these experiments (n = 2) led to a significant decrease or increase in IGF-IR or Akt phosphorylation compared with the addition of a single ligand at optimal concentration (result not shown).To investigate whether decorin can down-regulate the IGF-IR, we used a replication-deficient adenovirus containing the human decorin cDNA to induce decorin expression. Previous studies had shown that decorin-mediated effects were observed 2 days after infection and subsequent culture of endothelial cells in a collagen lattice (16Schönherr E. Levkau B. Schaefer L. Kresse H. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40687-40692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore, endothelial cells treated with a decorin-containing adenovirus or control virus were harvested after 2 and 4 days of culture on a collagen lattice. The IGF-IR was expressed in cells treated with the control virus, whereas overexpression of decorin drastically reduced the amount of receptor found in the cells after 2 days, when the decorin expression reached its peak. There was no recovery after prolonged decorin expression for 4 days (Fig. 1C). These data show that decorin leads to a sustained down-regulation of the IGF-IR.To characterize which part of the decorin core protein is important for signaling, Akt phosphorylation and/or p21 induction were analyzed after decorin mutants were applied to endothelial cells. For these experiments the following mutants were used: DCN-Q153, a mutant that contains the N terminus and the first 5 leucine-rich repeats of decorin, and DCN-E180K, a mutant with a point mutation reducing its affinity to collagen type I (21Kresse H. Liszio C. Schönherr E. Fisher L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18404-18410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These two mutants were chosen because previous studies (15Santra M. Reed C.C. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35671-35681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) had shown that the N-terminal part of decorin is not involved in binding the EGF receptor but leucine-rich repeat 7, which contains the point mutation (DCN-E180K). Our investigation demonstrated that DCN-Q153 alone was still able to induce Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2A) and p21 expression (result not shown), albeit to a lesser extent than wild type decorin. DCN-E180K induced p21 as strongly as wild type decorin, and it also triggered its translocation to the nucleus (Fig. 2B). These results imply that a different part of the decorin core protein interacts with the IGF-IR than with the EGF receptor.Fig. 2Effects of decorin mutants on Akt and p21 in endothelial cells.A, EA.hy 926 cells were plated as in Fig. 1A. Wild type decorin (40 μg/ml ∼1 μm) or DCN-Q153 (25 μg/ml ∼2 μm) were added for 10 min. Akt phosphorylation was determined as in Fig. 1A. The fragment DCN-Q153 is sufficient to induce Akt phosphorylation. B, EA.hy 926 cells were plated as in Fig. 1A. Wild type decorin or DCN-E180K (both 80 μg/ml) was added to the cells. After 20 h, cells were harvested and nuclear (N) and cellular (C) fractions were prepared. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21, and β-tubulin were determined by Western blotting. The mutant DCN-E180K induces p21 synthesis and translocation to the nucleus as efficiently as wild type decorin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The binding properties of decorin to IGF-IR and IGF-I were investigated by using iodinated ligands. The purity of decorin for all experiments was checked by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (Fig. 3A). The binding properties of the IGF-IR from endothelial cells to decorin were not determined by direct binding to cells, because it is not known yet whether the IGF-IR is the only decorin binding receptor on the endothelial cell surface. Therefore, the receptor was immunoprecipitated with antibody against its intracellular domain (β-subunit). The same antibody was also used in the cell culture studies (Fig. 1, B and C), which confirm its specificity. 125I-IGF-I and 125I-decorin were applied as soluble ligands. Ligands bound to the receptor were quantified by scintillation counting and correlating the amount of 125I[iodine] to the protein concentration of IGF-I or decorin. KD values of 1.2 × 10–9 m and KD of 18 × 10–9 m were calculated for IGF-I and decorin, respectively. These determinations indicated that the affinity of decorin for the IGF-IR is only about 10-fold less than that of IGF-I (Fig. 3, B and C). In a further experiment, 125I-IGF-I was bound to the receptor and displaced by unlabeled IGF-I or decorin. Using IGF-I as competitor, an IC50 of 3 × 10–7 m was determined. The decorin proteoglycan and the decorin core protein without glycosaminoglycan chain (result not shown) gave the same IC50 of 5 × 10–7 m (n = 4), whereas the N-terminal fragment DCN-Q153 inhibited with an IC50 of 20 × 10–7 m (Fig. 3D). These data show that decorin and IGF-I can compete for the IGF-IR, and they corroborate the cell culture results that the N-terminal part of decorin is sufficient to bind and activate the IGF-IR.Fig. 3Interaction of decorin with the IGF-IR.A, silver-stained SDS-PAGE of purified decorin. Decorin (2 μg of protein/lane, DCN) with and without chondroitin ABC lyase (ABCase) digestion was run under reducing conditions on a SDS-gradient gel (4–12%). ABCase alone was run as control. Arrows indicate the proteoglycan (PG) and the core protein (core). B–D, IGF-IR was immunoprecipitated from EA.hy 926 cells. Each data point contained immunocomplexes with receptor from 1 × 106 cells.

Early evidence of a role for oxidative damage was based on the finding, in patients and murine models, of high levels of markers, such as free nitrotyrosine (NT). However, no comprehensive study on the protein targets of nitration in ALS has been reported. We found an increased level of NT immunoreactivity in spinal cord protein extracts of a transgenic mouse model of familial ALS (FALS) at a presymptomatic stage of the disease compared with age-matched controls. NT immunoreactivity is increased in the soluble fraction of spinal cord homogenates and is found as a punctate staining in motor neuron perikarya of presymptomatic FALS mice. Using a proteome-based strategy, we identified proteins nitrated in vivo, under physiological or pathological conditions, and compared their level of specific nitration. α- and γ-enolase, ATP synthase β chain, and heat shock cognate 71-kDa protein and actin were overnitrated in presymptomatic FALS mice. We identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry 16 sites of nitration in proteins oxidized in vivo. In particular, α-enolase nitration at Tyr43, target also of phosphorylation, brings additional evidence on the possible interference of nitration with phosphorylation. In conclusion, we propose that protein nitration may have a role in ALS pathogenesis, acting directly by inhibiting the function of specific proteins and indirectly interfering with protein degradation pathways and phosphorylation cascades.

It is sporadic in 90% and familial in 10% of cases, of which 20% are caused by mutations of the copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene. Familial and sporadic ALS cases are indistinguishable on the basis of clinical and pathological criteria, suggesting that the two forms share similar or converging pathogenetic mechanisms. Several mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to ALS pathogenesis, including excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired proteasomal function, protein aggregation, and apoptosis. However, it is not clear which is the primary event or what are the temporal relations between these pathways. Recent investigations support the notion that these mechanisms may be coordinated by oxidative stress, which can activate pathways that lead to additional oxidative stress and amplify the disease (1Rakhit R. Cunningham P. Furtos-Matei A. Dahan S. Qi X.F. Crow J.P. Cashman N.R. Kondejewski L.H. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol.

Cell Biochem. 2003; 243: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Early evidence suggesting a role for oxidative damage in ALS came from the identification of markers of oxidative stress in the cortex and spinal cord of patients with sporadic and familial ALS (4Bowling A.C. Schulz J.B. Brown Jr., R.H. Beal M.F. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2322-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 5Ferrante R.J. Browne S.E. Shinobu L.A. Bowling A.C. Baik M.J. MacGarvey U.

Neurol. 1997; 42: 644-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Among these markers, nitrotyrosine (NT) has attracted attention in view of Beckman's theory, which suggests a greater propensity of SOD1 mutants to use peroxynitrite as an enzyme substrate, leading to tyrosine nitration (7Beckman J.S. Carson M. Smith C.D. Koppenol W.H. Nature. 1993; 364: 584Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). In fact, increased levels of free NT have been found in human patients and mouse models of ALS (6Beal M.F. Ferrante R.J. Browne S.E. Matthews R.T. Kowall N.W. Brown Jr., R.H. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 42: 644-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 8Bruijn L.I. Beal M.F. Becher M.W. Schulz J.B. Wong P.C. Price D.L. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). However, in only very few studies has protein-bound NT been specifically characterized in connection with ALS.Increased levels of free or protein-bound NT were observed in several neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases (10Greenacre S.A. Ischiropoulos H. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 34: 541-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) and were usually considered a marker of peroxynitrite formation, causing irreversible protein damage (11Yamakura F. Taka H. Fujimura T. Murayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14085-14089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry studies have shown that nitrated proteins accumulate in Lewy bodies of a number of neurodegenerative synucleopathies (12Duda J.E. Giasson B.I. Chen Q. Gur T.L. Hurtig H.I. Stern M.B. Gollomp S.M. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1439-1445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Using specific antibodies that recognized only nitrated α-synuclein, it was seen that the majority of the Lewy bodies contained nitrated α-synuclein, indicating that this modification may participate in their formation (13Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Murray I.V. Chen Q. Souza J.M. Hurtig H.I. Ischiropoulos H. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Science. 2000; 290: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar).Recent findings have raised the question of whether protein nitration might also be a cellular signaling mechanism (14Schopfer F.J. Baker P.R. Freeman B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 646-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been demonstrated that protein nitration is a reversible and selective process, like protein phosphorylation (15Aulak K.S. Koeck T. Crabb J.W. Stuehr D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H30-H38Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 16Koeck T. Fu X. Hazen S.L. Crabb J.W. Stuehr D.J. Aulak K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27257-27262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The dynamic nature of the nitration was revealed by denitration and renitration of proteins in mitochondria subjected to hypoxia-anoxia and reoxygenation cycles. Characterization of the putative tyrosine denitrase activity, which has been described in preliminary reports (17Kamisaki Y. Wada K. Bian K. Balabanli B. Davis K. Martin E. Behbod F. Lee Y.C. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11584-11589Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), would give conclusive evidence of the reversibility of this biological process and its role in signal transduction.To further explore these concepts and to clarify the role of protein nitration in ALS pathogenesis, detailed and comprehensive studies of the target proteins are needed. However, from a technical point of view, it is challenging to analyze nitrated proteins in vivo. The modification is rare, and common biochemical procedures may lead to loss of NT through conversion to aminotyrosine (18Balabanli B. Kamisaki Y. Martin E. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13136-13141Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, proteomic tools based on immunoblotting techniques have been recently adapted to the analysis of nitrated proteins and applied to investigate several pathological situations (19Ghezzi P. Bonetto V. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 1145-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We used a proteomic approach to analyze the nitrated proteins in spinal cord extracts of a murine model of a familial form of ALS (FALS): a transgenic (Tg) mouse overexpressing human SOD1 carrying G93A mutation, which develops progressive motor dysfunction leading to paralysis and death (20Bendotti C. Carri M.T. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 393-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Moreover, by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry, we identified 16 sites of nitration in proteins oxidized in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODSTransgenic Mouse ModelsTg mice originally obtained from Jackson Laboratories, expressing a high copy number of mutant human SOD1 with a G93A substitution or WT human SOD1 mice, were bred and maintained in a C57BL/6 mice strain at the Consorzio Mario Negri Sud, S. Maria Imbaro (CH), Italy. Tg mice are identified by PCR (21Rosen D.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 362Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The mice were housed at a temperature of 21 ± 1 °C with a relative humidity of 55 ± 10% and 12 h of light. Food (standard pellets) and water were supplied ad libitum. Female Tg SOD1 G93A mice were killed at 9, 14, and 20 weeks of age, corresponding to presymptomatic, early symptomatic, and late stages, respectively, of the motor dysfunction (22Bendotti C. Tortarolo M. Suchak S.K. Calvaresi N. Carvelli L. Bastone A. Rizzi M. Rattray M. Mennini T. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Age-matched female Tg SOD1 WT mice were used as controls. Non-Tg C57BL/6 mice were used as further controls for immunohistochemistry. Procedures involving animals and their care were conducted in conformity with the institutional guidelines that are in compliance with national (D.L. No. 116, G.U. Supplement 40, February 18, 1992, Circolare No. 8, G.U., 14 luglio 1994) and international laws and policies (EEC Council Directive 86/609, OJ L 358, 1 DEC.12, 1987; NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, United States National Research Council, 1996).Sample PreparationSoluble Proteins—Spinal cords were suspended 1:4 (w/v) in a lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm iodoacetamide, 1 tablet of Complete™/10 ml of buffer, Mini Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 5 μm MG132 proteasome inhibitor (Sigma)) and sonicated. Homogenates were ultracentrifuged at 55,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and soluble proteins separated from the pellet.Triton-insoluble Proteins or “Aggregates”—The pellet was further processed following a published protocol with some modifications (23Ouyang Y.B. Hu B.R. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 298: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) to enrich the fraction of ubiquitinated proteins. Briefly, the pellet was resuspended in ice-cold 15 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.25 m sucrose, 150 mm KCl, and 2% of nonionic detergent Triton X-100 and shaken for 5 h at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min to obtain Triton-resistant pellets.Dot BlotThis analysis was done using a dot-blot apparatus, Minifold II Slot-Blot System (Schleicher & Schuell). A polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) was soaked in methanol for a few seconds and then in ultrapure water for 2 min and conditioned in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, prior to assembly in the apparatus. Soluble proteins were directly loaded onto the membrane, whereas Triton-insoluble proteins were first resuspended in 0.5% SDS in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and then diluted 1:10 with the same Tris-HCl buffer before application. Deposition of each sample was made on the membrane by vacuum filtration. Aliquots (2 μg) of samples from Tg SOD1 G93A or Tg SOD1 WT mice of different ages were loaded on the membrane. The membrane was probed with the anti-NT antibody as described under “Western Blotting.” NT immunoreactivity was normalized to the actual amount of proteins loaded on each spot in the membrane as detected after Coomassie staining. Values were expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test.ImmunohistochemistryMice were anesthetized with Equithesin (1% phenobarbitol, 4% (v/v) chloral hydrate, 30 μl/10 g intraperitoneal) and transcardially perfused with 20 ml of PBS followed by 50 ml of sodium phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde solution. Tissues were rapidly removed, postfixed in fixative for 2 h, transferred to 20% sucrose solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight and then to 30% sucrose solution until they sank, and finally frozen in 2-methylbutane at -45 °C. Transverse lumbar spinal cord sections at the L3–L5 level (30 μm thick) were cut on a cryostat and processed free-floating in multiwell plates. Cryosections were permeabilized with 70% methanol in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and blocked with 5% normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Then sections were incubated overnight, with constant agitation, with primary antibody (monoclonal anti-NT, clone HM.11, HyCult Biotechnology) diluted 1:100 in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% normal goat serum. Immune reactions were revealed by a 60-min incubation in goat anti-mouse biotinylated IgG diluted 1:200 (Vector Laboratories), followed by 60-min incubation in avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC; Vector), using 3′-3-diaminobenzidine as chromogen. The specificity of the NT immunostaining was evaluated in sections from control mice processed with omission of the primary antiserum or with primary antiserum that was preabsorbed with 3-NT and developed under the same conditions.Two-dimensional ElectrophoresisSoluble proteins extracted from the spinal cord of G93A or WT mice were precipitated overnight with 4 volumes of methanol at -20 °C and resuspended in 8 m urea. Two-thirds of the sample from a spinal cord was used for preparative two-dimensional electrophoresis; one-third after two-dimensional electrophoresis was examined by Western blotting (WB). Two-dimensional electrophoresis was done essentially as previously described (24Gianazza E. Eberini I. Villa P. Fratelli M. Pinna C. Wait R. Gemeiner M. Miller I. J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2002; 771: 107-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, homemade 8-cm-long immobilized pH gradient gels, which cover, with an exponential course, pH range 4–10, (25Gianazza E. LinK A.J. 2-D Proteome Analysis Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 175-188Google Scholar), were used. Aliquots of sample solution were loaded on the immobilized pH gradient gels near the anode on a stack of Paratex pads and run in a Multiphor II apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). Pairs, with a WT and a G93A sample, were mounted tail-to-end on a gradient of 4–20% polyacrylamide, SDS gel cast in a Protean II apparatus (Bio-Rad) with the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli. After completion of the run, the preparative two-dimensional electrophoresis gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the other two-dimensional electrophoresis gel was transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane.Western BlottingEach WB experiment was done on a single polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, containing WT and G93A samples run in parallel. The membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a blocking buffer (5% milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween) and probed overnight at 4 °C with a monoclonal antibody against NT diluted 1:1000 (clone HM.11; HyCult Biotechnology) in blocking buffer. The membrane was then washed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with goat anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:5000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The immunopositive spots were visualized using a sensitive chemiluminescent protein detection system, ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). To reveal false immunopositive spots, membranes were first stripped with Restore™ Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) and then chemically reduced to convert NT to aminotyrosine, with 10 mm sodium dithionite in 50 mm pyridine acetate buffer, pH 5.0, for 1 h at room temperature, as previously described (26Miyagi M. Sakaguchi H. Darrow R.M. Yan L. West K.A. Aulak K.S. Stuehr D.J. Hollyfield J.G. Organisciak D.T. Crabb J.W. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2002; 1: 293-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). After the reaction, the membranes were extensively washed with distilled water and probed again with the anti-NT antibody. The immunopositive spots detected after the reduction were not considered for further analysis.Gel/Blot Image Analysis and QuantificationThe two-dimensional electrophoresis gels and the two-dimensional WB images were captured by a high resolution scanner, Expression 1680 Pro (Epson). Densitometry and image analysis were done by Progenesis software, Workstation version 2003.03 (Nonlinear Dynamics). Gel/blot comparison was done by using the specific warping algorithm of the software in the manual mode, placing seeding points on recognizable, intense immunopositive spots. The relative immunoreactivity for each protein spot was calculated as the ratio of the pixel volume of the immunoreactive spot on the blot to the pixel volume of the matched spot on the two-dimensional electrophoresis gel. NT-immunoreactive spot pixel volumes were normalized to the total immunoreactivity of the blot, and gel spot pixel volumes were normalized to the total spot volume of the gel. The -fold increase or decrease in NT immunoreactivity was calculated as the ratio between the relative immunoreactivity in Tg SOD1 G93A and in Tg SOD1 WT mice. -Fold changes of relative NT immunoreactivity in Tg SOD1 G93A compared with Tg SOD1 WT mice in the four experiments were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was done by one-sample Student's t test, with p < 0.05 indicating -fold changes significantly greater than 1.Protein IdentificationProtein spots were excised from two-dimensional electrophoresis gels, destained for a few hours in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 40% ethanol, and washed with sequentially rising percentages of acetonitrile. Proteins were gel-digested overnight at 30 °C with trypsin (Promega) at a concentration of 12 ng/μl in a 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 10% acetonitrile solution. When necessary, tryptic digests were concentrated and desalted using ZipTip® pipette tips with C18 resin and a 0.2-μl bed volume (Millipore Corp.). Peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) was done on a ReflexIII™ MALDI mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix, as previously described (27Laragione T. Bonetto V. Casoni F. Massignan T. Bianchi G. Gianazza E. Ghezzi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14737-14741Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The mass spectra were internally calibrated with trypsin autolysis fragments, routinely obtaining accuracy better than 50 ppm. Data base (NCBInr) searches were done using the Mascot program (available on the World Wide Web at www.matrixscience.com), allowing up to one missed trypsin cleavage and a mass tolerance of ±0.1 Da. In the Mascot searching of Mus musculus sequences deposited in NCBInr, probability-based MOWSE scores (56Pappin D.J. Hojrup P. Bleasby A.J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 327-332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar) greater than 61 were considered significant (p < 0.05). In the case of a low score, the identification was confirmed by PMF analysis of endoprotease V8 (Sigma) protein digest. The enzyme was used at a concentration of 12 ng/μl in a 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 5% acetonitrile solution. Spectra originating from parallel protein digestions were compared pairwise to discard common peaks from endoprotease V8 autodigestion. Data base searches were done with the Mascot program, allowing up to two missed cleavages.RESULTSNT Immunoreactivity Is Higher in Spinal Cord of Tg SOD1 G93A Mice than Tg SOD1 WT Mice at All Stages of the Disease—We measured the total NT immunoreactivity, which comprises free and protein-bound NT, in spinal cord and hippocampus soluble protein extracts from Tg SOD1 G93A mice at presymptomatic (9 weeks), symptomatic (14 weeks), and late (20 weeks) stages of the disease and from age-matched control SOD1 WT mice. We found dot-blot analysis particularly suitable for this type of experiment, since it involves limited manipulation of the sample, and NT modification is maximally preserved, whereas in classical SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/WB analysis, boiling the sample with reducing agents may cause the conversion of NT to aminotyrosine (18Balabanli B. Kamisaki Y. Martin E. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13136-13141Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition, only a small amount of sample is required, and all of the replicates can be analyzed at the same time, allowing accurate comparison.At all ages examined, the level of NT immunoreactivity in G93A spinal cord soluble protein extracts was higher than for age-matched controls (Fig. 1A), with a peak of increase of about 2-fold at a presymptomatic stage. We performed the same experiment with soluble protein extracts from hippocampus, which is not affected by the disease. In hippocampus (Fig. 1B), the levels of NT immunoreactivity were comparable for G93A and WT samples at 14 and 20 weeks. The NT level in G93A samples was higher, but not significantly, only at 9 weeks. On the other hand, the NT level in hippocampus extracts was about 2.5-fold less than in spinal cord extracts (data not shown).Nitrated Proteins Do Not Selectively Accumulate in Protein Aggregates—We tested whether nitrated proteins participate in the formation of protein aggregates and accumulate in cell inclusions. The most widely seen inclusions in ALS immunostain for ubiquitin (both sporadic and FALS) and for SOD1 (SOD1-linked FALS cases) (28Wood J.D. Beaujeux T.P. Shaw P.J. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 2003; 29: 529-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Triton-insoluble fractions of protein extracts are rich in ubiquitinated proteins (29Hayashi T. Takada K. Matsuda M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and in SOD1 (30Cheroni C. Peviani M. Cascio P. De Biasi S. Monti C. Bendotti C. Neurobiol. Dis. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). The Triton-resistant pellet was our protein aggregate preparation. Proteins were extracted from spinal cord of six Tg SOD1 G93A or Tg SOD1 WT mice at 9, 14, and 20 weeks of age, and NT immunoreactivity was measured in the Triton-insoluble fraction by dot-blot analysis. The levels of NT immunoreactivity were not significantly different between G93A and WT samples at all ages examined (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, NT immunoreactivity was substantially lower, about 10-fold, in the aggregates from G93A and WT samples at all ages compared with soluble extracts from 9-week-old Tg SOD1 WT mice.Fig. 2Comparison of the level of NT immunoreactivity in soluble protein extracts and aggregates. NT immunoreactivity was measured by dot-blot analysis of soluble protein extracts from spinal cord of 9-week-old Tg SOD1 WT mice and of Triton-insoluble proteins extracts from the spinal cord of Tg SOD1 WT and Tg SOD1 G93A mice at 9, 14, and 20 weeks of age. Dot-blot analysis was done on a pool of three G93A and WT mice, loading on the membrane a 2-μg aliquot of each pooled sample. NT immunoreactivity was normalized to the total protein loaded as measured by densitometry of the dot-blot membrane after Coomassie staining. Values are expressed in arbitrary units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)NT Immunolabeling Appears as a Punctate Staining in the Motor Neuron Perikarya of Presymptomatic Tg SOD1 G93A Mice—The overall intensity of immunostaining was comparable in non-Tg, SOD1 WT, and presymptomatic SOD1 G93A mice (Fig. 3, A–C). However, in four of six presymptomatic SOD1 G93A mice, a peculiar punctate staining was noticed in the motor neurons with spots intensely immunolabeled (Fig. 3C). This phenomenon was observed in highly vacuolated, degenerating motor neurons as well as in apparently healthy ones. At the symptomatic stage, there was an overall increase of NT immunoreactivity throughout the gray and white matter of the whole lumbar spinal cord sections, but a punctate staining was not observed (Fig. 3D). The increase in immunoreactivity was diffuse in the neuropil and was particularly concentrated in small cells and small tissue elements. Some of them appeared as markedly shrunken neurons, whereas others showed morphology typical of hypertrophic astrocytes and reactive microglia cells.Fig. 3NT immunoreactivity in ventral horn of transverse sections of lumbar spinal cord from non-Tg (A), SOD1 WT (B), and SOD1 G93A mice at presymptomatic (C) and symptomatic (D) stages. In non-Tg and SOD1 WT mice, low NT immunostaining is distributed in the gray matter except for the motor neurons that show a higher immunolabeling (arrows; see also insets at higher magnification). In presymptomatic SOD1 G93A mice (C), some motor neurons show a remarkable, punctated staining of perikarya. This is evident in both massively vacuolated (lower inset in C) and apparently normal (upper inset in C) motor neurons. In symptomatic SOD1 G93A mice (D), a higher, diffuse NT immunoreactivity is observed in both gray and white matter. Small intensely immunolabeled cells, apparently hypertrophic astrocytes (upper inset in D), are distributed in gray and white matter. Intensely labeled shrunken motor neurons (lower inset in D) are observed.

Nitrated proteins in spinal cords of Tg SOD1 G93A or Tg SOD1 WT mice were analyzed using a proteomic approach. Soluble proteins were extracted from spinal cord of 9-week-old mutated Tg and age-matched healthy control mice. Each sample was separated in duplicate by isoelectrofocusing. The second dimension for the G93A and WT samples was run in the same gel, in duplicate. One of the two-dimensional electrophoresis gels was then transferred to a single membrane for WB analysis using anti-NT antibody, and the other was stained with Coomassie Blue. The images of blot and corresponding Coomassie-stained two-dimensional electrophoresis gel were overlaid by the Progenesis software, using the warping/matching algorithm in the manual mode. The two-dimensional electrophoresis gel spots corresponding to the immunoreactive spots were excised and subjected to PMF analysis for identification.

https://openalex.org/W2083776958,"Angiotensin II type 1a (AT1a), vasopressin V2, and neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors are seven-transmembrane receptors (7TMRs) that bind and co-internalize with the multifunctional adaptor protein, β-arrestin. These receptors also lead to robust and persistent activation of extracellular-signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) localized on endosomes. Recently, the co-trafficking of receptor-β-arrestin complexes to endosomes was demonstrated to require stable β-arrestin ubiquitination (Shenoy, S. K., and Lefkowitz, R. J. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 14498–14506). We now report that lysines at positions 11 and 12 in β-arrestin2 are specific and required sites for its AngII-mediated sustained ubiquitination. Thus, upon AngII stimulation the mutant β-arrestin2K11,12R is only transiently ubiquitinated, does not form stable endocytic complexes with the AT1aR, and is impaired in scaffolding-activated ERK1/2. Fusion of a ubiquitin moiety in-frame to β-arrestin2K11,12R restores AngII-mediated trafficking and signaling. Wild type β-arrestin2 and β-arrestin2K11R,K12R-Ub, but not β-arrestin2K11R,K12R, prevent nuclear translocation of pERK. These findings imply that sustained β-arrestin ubiquitination not only directs co-trafficking of receptor-β-arrestin complexes but also orchestrates the targeting of “7TMR signalosomes” to microcompartments within the cell. Surprisingly, binding of β-arrestin2K11R,K12R to V2R and NK1R is indistinguishable from that of wild type β-arrestin2. Moreover, ubiquitination patterns and ERK scaffolding of β-arrestin2K11,12R are unimpaired with respect to V2R stimulation. In contrast, a quintuple lysine mutant (β-arrestin2K18R,K107R,K108R,K207R,K296R) is impaired in endosomal trafficking in response to V2R but not AT1aR stimulation. Our findings delineate a novel regulatory mechanism for 7TMR signaling, dictated by the ubiquitination of β-arrestin on specific lysines that become accessible for modification due to the specific receptor-bound conformational states of β-arrestin2. Angiotensin II type 1a (AT1a), vasopressin V2, and neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors are seven-transmembrane receptors (7TMRs) that bind and co-internalize with the multifunctional adaptor protein, β-arrestin. These receptors also lead to robust and persistent activation of extracellular-signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) localized on endosomes. Recently, the co-trafficking of receptor-β-arrestin complexes to endosomes was demonstrated to require stable β-arrestin ubiquitination (Shenoy, S. K., and Lefkowitz, R. J. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 14498–14506). We now report that lysines at positions 11 and 12 in β-arrestin2 are specific and required sites for its AngII-mediated sustained ubiquitination. Thus, upon AngII stimulation the mutant β-arrestin2K11,12R is only transiently ubiquitinated, does not form stable endocytic complexes with the AT1aR, and is impaired in scaffolding-activated ERK1/2. Fusion of a ubiquitin moiety in-frame to β-arrestin2K11,12R restores AngII-mediated trafficking and signaling. Wild type β-arrestin2 and β-arrestin2K11R,K12R-Ub, but not β-arrestin2K11R,K12R, prevent nuclear translocation of pERK. These findings imply that sustained β-arrestin ubiquitination not only directs co-trafficking of receptor-β-arrestin complexes but also orchestrates the targeting of “7TMR signalosomes” to microcompartments within the cell. Surprisingly, binding of β-arrestin2K11R,K12R to V2R and NK1R is indistinguishable from that of wild type β-arrestin2. Moreover, ubiquitination patterns and ERK scaffolding of β-arrestin2K11,12R are unimpaired with respect to V2R stimulation. In contrast, a quintuple lysine mutant (β-arrestin2K18R,K107R,K108R,K207R,K296R) is impaired in endosomal trafficking in response to V2R but not AT1aR stimulation. Our findings delineate a novel regulatory mechanism for 7TMR signaling, dictated by the ubiquitination of β-arrestin on specific lysines that become accessible for modification due to the specific receptor-bound conformational states of β-arrestin2. Receptor endocytosis is an important mechanism for the movement of cell surface receptors into internal cellular compartments, facilitating receptor down-regulation and signal desensitization (1Claing A.

For the mammalian 7TMRs, agonist stimulation leads not only to initiation of G protein-dependent signaling pathways but also to receptor phosphorylation on serine-threonine residues by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (5Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Receptor activation and phosphorylation facilitate recruitment of the multifunctional adaptor proteins β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 (also called arrestin2 and arrestin3) (6Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). β-Arrestins desensitize G protein-mediated signaling by sterically blocking further receptor G protein interaction. β-Arrestins have also been demonstrated to bind proteins of the cellular trafficking machinery, such as clathrin, AP2 (adaptin protein subunit 2), NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor), and ARF6 (ADP-ribosylation factor 6), and a variety of signaling proteins such as c-Src, ERK1/2, and JNK3, thereby mediating 7TMR internalization and some aspects of signaling (7Goodman Jr., O.B.

However, it is unknown how the endocytic and signaling roles of β-arrestin are integrated and regulated.Two patterns of 7TMR interaction with β-arrestins have been described (14Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). “Class A” receptors such as the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) bind β-arrestins after agonist stimulation and traffic with them to clathrin-coated pits. However, because the interaction is of relatively low affinity, β-arrestin dissociates from the receptor as the coated pit pinches off as a coated vesicle, and the receptor internalizes without the β-arrestin. In contrast, for “Class B” receptors such as the angiotensin II type 1a receptor (AT1aR) and the vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R), agonist-activated receptors bind β-arrestins with high affinity, do not dissociate from them in the plasma membrane, and internalize together into endosomes where they remain stably associated for prolonged periods. Moreover, receptors that bind β-arrestin stably (Class B) stabilize cytosolic pERK while inhibiting nuclear pERK activity (12DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J.

McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). The time course of β-arrestin ubiquitination correlates with the stability of receptor-β-arrestin interaction, i.e. transient interaction is associated with transient ubiquitination (Class A, e.g. β2AR) and persistent interaction with sustained ubiquitination (Class B, e.g. V2R) (18Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14498-14506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Translational fusion of ubiquitin to the C terminus of β-arrestin (β-arrestin2-Ub) leads to its co-trafficking and co-localization with β2ARs (Class A) in endocytic vesicles, thus mimicking a Class B pattern.Here we set out to investigate whether β-arrestin ubiquitination might serve as a molecular link between its endocytic and signaling functions. Not only does this appear to be the case, but we uncovered the existence of a previously unsuspected heterogeneity of receptor-specific activated and ubiquitinated β-arrestin conformations. Our findings suggest a mechanism that may explain the conundrum of how only two forms of β-arrestin can mediate and modulate the disparate actions of many 7TMRs.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell lines, Reagents, and Plasmids—COS-7 and HEK-293 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin streptomycin and transiently transfected with Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). HEK-293 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum and transiently transfected with FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics). M2 anti-FLAG affinity agarose beads, isoproterenol, angiotensin peptide, arginine-vasopressin peptide, substance P, and N-ethylmaleimide were from Sigma. FK2 Ub antibody was from Biomol. Ubiquitin antibody Ub-P4D1 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal antibody 12CA5 to HA epitope was from Roche Diagnostics. Alexa-594- and Alexa-633-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences. Detection of active ERK was with a rabbit polyclonal antiphospho-p44/42 MAPK (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:2000 for Western blot and 1:200 for immunostaining). Total ERK was detected with anti-MAPK1/2 (Upstate Technology Inc). [125I](-)Iodocyanopindolol, 125I-labeled angiotensin, and 3H-labeled AVP were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.β-Arrestin2 was cloned in-frame into the pEGFPN1 and pEGFPC2 vectors (Clontech) to yield β-arrestin2-GFP and GFP-β-arrestin2, respectively. Using wild type β-arestin2 plasmid as a template, multiple lysine residues were mutated to arginine residues by utilizing the QuikChange multi-site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For single site alterations, a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used. All DNA constructs were confirmed by sequencing. HA-β2AR plasmid was a gift from Dr. Neil Freedman (Duke University), and HA-AT1aR and HA-V2R plasmid were provided by Dr. Marc Caron (Duke University). FLAG-NK1R was from Dr. Thue Schwartz (University of Denmark).Immunoprecipitation and Immunodetection—To detect ubiquitinated β-arrestin2, β-arrestin2-FLAG/pCDNA3, or β-arrestin2K11,12R-FLAG/pCDNA3.1 was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells or HEK-293 cells along with the receptor plasmid. To detect active ERK in β-arrestin immunoprecipitates, β-arrestin2-FLAG or β-arrestin2K11R,K12R-FLAG was co-expressed with RFP-ERK2 along with HA-AT1aR or HA-V2R. Cells were serum-starved for 2 h and then stimulated or not for the indicated times with the appropriate agonists. Cells were solubilized in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (5 μg/ml), aprotinin (5 μg/ml), pepstatin A (1 μg/ml), benzaminidine (100 μm) and 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide. The use of N-ethylmaleimide in lysis buffers in all co-immunoprecipitation procedures is an important technical feature because it stabilizes ubiquitinated species by preventing their deubiquitination. Soluble extracts were mixed with FLAG M2 affinity beads and rotated at 4 °C overnight. Nonspecific binding was eliminated by repeated washes with lysis buffer, and bound protein was eluted with sample buffer containing SDS. The proteins were separated on a gradient gel (4–20%, Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting. Chemiluminescent detection was performed using SuperSignal West Pico reagent (Pierce). pERK and β-arrestin signals were quantified by densitometry with a Fluor-S MultiImager (Bio-Rad). In all experiments, receptor expression levels were concurrently determined by radioligand binding for the β2AR, the V2R, and the AT1aR. Surface expression of FLAG-NK1R was measured by flow cytometry.Confocal Microscopy—HEK-293 cells have a favorable morphology for examining sections of cytoplasm and nucleus simultaneously and hence were used in these experiments. HEK-293 cells on 10-cm dishes were transiently transfected with HA-β2AR, HA-AT1aR, HA-V2R, or FLAG-NK1R along with the respective β-arrestin2-GFP construct. Twenty-four h post-transfection, cells were plated on collagen-coated 35-mm glass-bottom plates. On the following day, cells were starved for at least 2 h in serum-free medium prior to stimulation. After stimulation, cells were fixed with 5% formaldehyde diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing calcium and magnesium. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.01% Triton in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 60 min and incubated at room temperature with the appropriate primary antibody. The secondary antibody incubations were done for 1 h followed by repeated washes using phosphate-buffered saline. Confocal images were obtained on a Zeiss LSM-510 laser-scanning microscope using multitrack sequential excitation (488, 568, and 633 nm) and emission (515–540 nm GFP; 585–615 nm, Texas Red; 650 nm, Alexa-633) filter sets.RESULTSAngiotensin II-stimulated Endosomal Recruitment of β-Arrestin2 Requires β-Arrestin2 Ubiquitination at Lysines 11 and 12—When HEK-293 cells overexpressing the HA-AT1aR and β-arrestin2-FLAG were stimulated with 1 μm AngII, we could detect an agonist-dependent increase in β-arrestin ubiquitination within 1 min (Fig. 1A). As predicted for a Class B receptor, this ubiquitination signal did not decrease after 15 min of agonist, suggesting that β-arrestins do not become rapidly deubiquitinated, thus facilitating their association and co-trafficking with the AT1aRs to endocytic vesicles. The pattern of transient β-arrestin2 ubiquitination resulting from the activation of the β2ARs is shown in Fig. 1B.β-Arrestin2 contains 31 lysine residues dispersed through its primary sequence, which could serve as potential ubiquitination sites. To screen for lysines critical for ubiquitin attachment and hence for endosomal recruitment, we created five different β-arrestin2 mutants, β-arrestin2-A–E (Fig. 2A) with a GFP tag at the C terminus. These five mutants collectively contained alterations of all the 31 lysines of β-arrestin2 primary sequence to arginine residues. We tested the various lysine mutants for their recruitment to the β2AR (Class A, Fig. 2B) and the AT1aR, a prototypic Class B receptor (Fig. 2C). Prior to receptor activation, the wild type and mutant β-arrestins remained cytosolic and uniformly distributed (data not shown). All of the β-arrestin2 mutants (A, B, C, D, and E) were recruited to the plasma membrane as robustly as the wild type upon stimulation of the β2AR with 1 μm isoproterenol for 30 min (Fig. 2B). Within 5 min of AT1aR stimulation, the WT and all mutants translocated to cell surface receptors (not shown). After 30 min of AT1aR stimulation the WT and mutants A, C, D, and E were recruited to endosomes but β-arrestin2-B was not (Fig. 2C). β-Arrestin2-B mutant displays a Class A trafficking pattern with the AT1aR (a Class B receptor). This suggests that lysine(s) located within this group of seven residues (lysines 11, 12, 78, 171, 286, 398, and 401) and possibly their modification with ubiquitin can be crucial in mediating the stable association of activated AT1aRs and β-arrestin2.Fig. 2Lysine modification and β-arrestin2 trafficking.A, targeted disruption of β-arrestin2 ubiquitination. Rat β-arrestin2 sequence consists of 410 amino acid residues among which 31 are lysines (abbreviated as K). The numbers indicate the position of lysine with respect to the start codon or methionine. At the indicated positions in each mutant construct, an arginine substitution was introduced. For agonist-stimulated β-arrestin2 translocation, HEK-293 cells expressing FLAG-β2AR (B) or HA-AT1aR (C) were transfected with β-arrestin WT or mutants carrying a GFP tag at the C terminus. Confocal images represent the translocation of β-arrestin2-GFP in cells treated with 1 μm isoproterenol (B) or 1 μm AngII (C) for 30 min at 37 °C. Untreated cells show uniform cytosolic β-arrestin2-GFP distribution (not shown). Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM-510 laser-scanning microscope. GFP detection was by excitation at 488 nm, utilizing emission filters at 505–550 nm. Images represent one of four experiments with identical findings.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To elucidate the putative ubiquitination sites within β-arrestin2-B that are critical for AngII-stimulated endosomal recruitment, we created five additional mutants: β-arrestin2K11R,K12R, β-arrestin2K78R, β-arrestin2K171R, β-arrestin2K286R, and β-arrestin2K398R,K401R (Fig. 3A). When all these mutants were tested for AngII-stimulated recruitment, only β-arrestin2K11R,K12R was impaired in trafficking. All other mutants showed endosomal distribution after 30 min of AngII stimulation (Fig. 3A). To determine whether either or both of these vicinal lysines (lysines 11 and 12) are crucial for AngII-dependent recruitment of β-arrestin2, we made the point mutants β-arrestin2K11R and β-arrestin2K12R and tested trafficking upon AT1aR stimulation (Fig. 3B). As seen in Fig. 3B, after 30 min of AngII treatment, both mutants were partially impaired in their recruitment to endosomes, suggesting that alteration of both lysines is necessary to eliminate the AngII-stimulated endosomal trafficking. We utilized β-arrestin2K11R,K12R, which is not recruited to endosomes for further characterization.Fig. 3Vicinal lysines within mutant “B” are required for AngII-stimulated endosomal recruitment.A, confocal images illustrate the distribution of indicated β-arrestin2 mutant in HEK-293 cells expressing HA-AT1aR after stimulation with 1 μm AngII for 30 min at 37 °C. β-Arrestin-B carrying seven mutations and β-arrestin2K11,12R show membrane-recruited β-arrestin2. All other mutants displayed endosomal distribution of β-arrestin2. Confocal microscopy was performed as described in the legend for Fig. 2. B, the translocation patterns of β-arrestin2-GFP carrying point mutation at position 11 or 12 after a 30-min stimulation of AT1aR are portrayed. As a comparison the membrane distribution of β-arrestin2K11R,K12R is also shown. These data are representative of similar results from four separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)β-Arrestin2K11R,K12R Displays Transient Ubiquitination Pattern upon AngII Stimulation—We next tested the agonist-induced ubiquitination of the β-arrestin2K11R,K12R to determine whether the change in the trafficking pattern also affected its ubiquitination kinetics. The AT1aR was co-expressed with β-arrestin2K11R,K12R-FLAG or β-arrestin2-FLAG in HEK-293 cells. After stimulation for 0, 1, or 15 min with AngII, β-arrestins were immunoprecipitated and analyzed for ubiquitination by Western blotting. As seen in Fig. 4A, β-arrestin2K11R,K12R was ubiquitinated within a minute of AngII stimulation, but the signal decreased to basal levels at 15 min of AngII stimulation. In contrast, the ubiquitination of β-arrestin2 WT remained sustained at 15 min of AngII treatment. Thus, β-arrestin2K11R,K12R displays a transient ubiquitination pattern with AT1aR stimulation similar to ubiquitination induced by the β2AR, a prototypic Class A receptor that does not recruit β-arrestin2 to endosomes (Fig. 1B and Refs. 17Shenoy S.K.

These data suggest that AT1aR stimulation causes transient ubiquitination of as yet undesignated lysines on β-arrestin2 as well as sustained ubiquitination on lysines 11 and/or 12.Fig. 4Stable β ubiquitination correlates with robust ERK scaffolding properties.A, AngII-stimulated ubiquitination patterns of β-arrestin2 WT and β-arrestin2K11,12R in HEK-293 cells. Transiently transfected HEK-293 cells were stimulated with 1 μm AngII for the indicated time, and β-arrestin2-FLAG or β-arrestin2K11R,K12R-FLAG was isolated by utilizing anti-FLAG affinity agarose beads. Protein eluted from the beads was analyzed for ubiquitination by Western blotting (IB, immunoblot) with the ubiquitin antibody P4D1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The levels of β-arrestin2 as detected by a polyclonal FLAG antibody are also displayed. The expression levels of AT1aR as determined by [I125]Ang binding ranged from 900 to 1200 fmol/mg total cell protein. These blots are representative of similar blots from four independent experiments. B, analysis of pERK bound to β-arrestin2 WT and β-arrestin2K11R,K12R upon AngII stimulation.

Additionally in COS-7 cells, AT1aR stimulation markedly increases the phosphorylation of the β-arrestin-scaffolded GFP-ERK2 (15Tohgo A. Pierce K.L. Choy E.W. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol.

To determine whether the changes in β-arrestin ubiquitination pattern and trafficking correlate with AngII-stimulated pERK scaffolding activity of β-arrestin, we isolated β-arrestin immunoprecipitates and determined the amount of β-arrestin-bound pERK. HA-AT1aR was expressed in COS-7 cells along with RFP-ERK2 and either the β-arrestin2-FLAG or β-arrestin2K11R,K12R-FLAG; cells were stimulated with 100 nm AngII for 5 min, and FLAG immunoprecipitates were isolated and probed for the pERK content. β-Arrestin2K11R,K12R immunoprecipitates contained significantly less pERK, averaging only 45% of the levels obtained with β-arrestin2 WT (Fig. 4, B and C). This indicates that decreasing the stability of β-arrestin ubiquitination can result in a corresponding reduction in the amount of β-arrestin-scaffolded pERK.Stable β-Arrestin2 Ubiquitination Is a Prerequisite for Formation of Stable Receptor Signalosomes—We utilized immunostaining and confocal microscopy to determine whether sustained β-arrestin2 ubiquitination plays any role in the subcellular distribution of pERK stimulated by AngII. We transfected HEK-293 cells with either β-arrestin2-GFP (Fig. 5A) or β-arrestin2K11R,K12R-GFP (Fig. 5B) along with HAAT1aR and detected the presence of endogenous pERK by utilizing an antibody that specifically reacts to the activated forms of ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204-phosphorylated ERK1/2). As shown in Fig. 5A, quiescent cells did not contain active ERK, with receptors occupying the membrane (blue), and β-arrestin2 was evenly distributed in the cytosol (green). A 5-min stimulation with AngII led to the recruitment of β-arrestin2 to the membrane and robust activation of ERK in the membrane and cytosol with comparatively lesser ERK activity in the nucleus (Fig. 5A, middle row). Longer stimulation (30 min) resulted in the redistribution of receptor, pERK, and β-arrestin to endosomal vesicles (Fig. 5A, bottom row). In the presence of β-arrestin2K11R,K12R, we could detect robust ERK phosphorylation at the plasma membrane as well as in the cytosol and the nucleus after a 5-min stimulation (Fig. 5B, 2nd row), but the ERK activation was transient and no signaling endosomal complexes were detectable after 30 min of agonist treatment (Fig. 5B, 3rd row). These experiments suggest that stable ubiquitination of β-arrestin, besides being necessary for stable binding to receptors, is also pivotal for the formation of stable signaling receptor complexes and the targeting of sustained ERK activity to the endosomes.Fig. 5Stable β-arrestin ubiquitination leads to persistent signaling on endosomes. HEK-293 cells transiently expressing the HAAT1aR along with β-arrestin2-GFP (A) or β-arrestin2K11R,K12R (B) were starved in serum-free media for at least 2 h and stimulated with 1 μm AngII at 37 °C for the indicated periods of time. Fixed and permeabilized cells were then incubated with pERK polyclonal antibody followed by secondary Alexa-633-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. This was followed by treatment with 12CA5 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes the HA epitope on the receptor and Alexa-594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Fluorescent confocal images were obtained on a Zeiss LSM-510 microscope using multitrack sequential excitation (488, 568, 633 nm) and emission filter sets at 515–540 nm for detecting GFP (β-arrestin, green), at 585–615 for Alexa-594 (receptor, blue), and at 650 nm for the Alexa-633 (pERK, red).

Calcium-dependent proteases, calpains, have been intensively analyzed in relation to these pathological conditions, but in vivo experiments have been hampered by the lack of appropriate experimental systems for a selective regulation of the calpain activity in animals. Here we have generated transgenic (Tg) mice that overexpress human calpastatin, a specific and the only natural inhibitor of calpains. In order to clarify the distinct roles of these cell death-associated cysteine proteases, we dissected neurodegenerative changes in these mice together with Tg mice overexpressing a viral inhibitor of caspases after intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid (KA), an inducer of neuronal excitotoxicity. Immunohistochemical analyses using endo-specific antibodies against calpain- and caspase-cleaved cytoskeletal components revealed that preclusion of KA-induced calpain activation can rescue the hippocampal neurons from disruption of the neuritic cytoskeletons, whereas caspase suppression has no overt effect on the neuritic pathologies. In addition, progressive neuronal loss between the acute and subacute phases of KA-induced injury was largely halted only in human calpastatin Tg mice. The animal models and experimental paradigm employed here unequivocally demonstrate their usefulness for clarifying the distinct contribution of calpain and caspase systems to molecular mechanisms governing neurodegeneration in adult brains, and our results indicate the potentials of specific calpain inhibitors in ameliorating excitotoxic neuronal damages.

Diverse proteolytic enzymes have been indicated to mediate molecular processes of neurodegeneration (1Rami A. Neurobiol.

A family of nonlysosomal calcium-activated neutral cysteine proteases, referred to as calpain family (μ- and m-calpain isoforms in the present study), has been mechanistically implicated in the regulation of various cellular functions (5Melloni E.

Acute and subacute brain insults such as traumatic injury and hypoxia/ischemia involve prominent calpain activation evoked by calcium dysregulation in neurons. Moreover, several independent studies have highlighted the elevation of calpain activity in chronic neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer disease (12Saito K. Elce J.S. Hamos J.E. Nixon R.A.

However, it remains unclear whether the relationship between calpain activation and the disorganization of the neuronal cytoskeletons in these pathologies is causal or coincidental. To our knowledge, there has been a relatively small amount of in vivo information for the molecular consequences of calpain activation in neurons. Although attempts to intervene in calpain activation in experimental animal models of head trauma (15McIntosh T.K. Saatman K.E. Raghupathi R. Graham D.I. Smith D.H. Lee V.M.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q.

Neurol. 2001; 170: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and several other brain pathologies have been made, there have been the following limitations in modulating calpain activity (1): knock-out mice lacking the 30-kDa small regulatory subunit of calpain suffer embryonic lethality (17Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4781Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 18Zimmerman U.J. Boring L. Pak J.H. Mukerjee N. Wang K.K. IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), indicating difficulty in direct reverse-genetic suppression of calpain expression (2); and all synthetic peptidic, peptide-mimetic, and nonpeptidic calpain inhibitors currently available have problems in terms of specificity, metabolic stability, water-solubility, or penetration through the blood-brain barrier (19Wang K.K.W.

Möller A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2000; 10: 2187-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Calpastatin (CAST), the only natural inhibitor of both μ- and m-calpains (21Emori Y. Kawasaki H.

Sci. 1994; 15: 412-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), is a potentially valuable tool to investigate the significance of calpain activation in living animals. A recent study, utilizing adenovirus-mediated overexpression of CAST for suppressing the calpain activity in an experimental mouse model of Parkinson disease, demonstrated protective effects of locally overexpressed CAST on striatal neurons (14Crocker S.J. Smith P.D. Jackson-Lewis V. Lamba W.R. Hayley S.P. Grimm E. Callaghan S.M. Slack R.S. Melloni E. Przedborski S. Robertson G.S. Anisman H. Merali Z. Park D.S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4081-4091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, generation of genetically engineered mice carrying the CAST transgene is more advantageous in accomplishing a stable and persistent overexpression of CAST in broad areas of the mouse brain. Such transgenic (Tg) mice could also be cross-bred with numerous models of neurodegenerative disorders to examine the contribution of calpain activation to various neuropathologies. We recently generated Tg mice overexpressing a viral inhibitor of caspases (VIC), and we assessed the effects of caspase inhibition on neuronal loss induced by a local injection of kainic acid (KA), an agonist for excitatory amino acid receptors (23Tomioka M. Shirotani K. Iwata N. Lee H.J. Yang F. Cole G.M. Seyama Y. Saido T.C. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 108: 18-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A similar experimental paradigm may be applicable to investigating the pathological role of the calpain-CAST system. In the present study, we have generated Tg mice overexpressing human CAST (hCAST) and raised antibodies to calpain- and caspase-cleaved cytoskeletal constituents, which can be employed to immunohistochemically visualize the activities of these proteases using both frozen and paraffin sections. The hCAST and VIC Tg mice and these antibodies permitted us to establish an experimental paradigm that is ideal for distinctively analyzing the mechanistic roles of calpain and caspase activation. Whereas both the VIC and hCAST transgenes were driven by the same neuron-specific calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-II α subunit promoter (24Sahyoun N. LeVine H. II I Burgess S.K. Blanchard S. Chang K.J. Cuatrecasas P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 878-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), only the hCAST Tg mice showed a significant preservation of the neuritic cytoskeletons and an attenuation of progressive neuronal loss between the acute and subacute phases following the KA challenge. In contrast, there was little difference in the pathological consequences of KA injection between nontransgenic (nTg) and VIC Tg mice. These findings support the view that the calpains-CAST system is critically involved in the molecular events taking place in excitotoxicity-induced neuropathology in adult brains, and also demonstrate the usefulness of our experimental model for obtaining insights into the mechanisms governing a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders. Tg Mice Overexpressing hCAST and VIC—The hCAST cDNA (25Asada K. Ishino Y. Shimada M. Shimojo T. Endo M. Kimizuka F. Kato I. Maki M. Hatanaka M. Murachi T. J. Enzyme Inhib. 1989; 3: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Hitomi K. Yokoyama A. Maki M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was cloned into pNN265, from which the NotI fragment was subcloned into pMM403 containing the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-II α promoter (27Mayford M. Wang J. Kandel E.R. O'Dell T.J. Cell. 1995; 81: 891-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The SfiI-linearized DNA construct was microinjected into the pronucleus of C57BL/6Cr zygotes, which were transferred into foster females to create hCAST Tg founders. The genotype was determined by PCR with primers 5′-CATGAACCACAGACAGCTTGGTTGAC-3′ and 5′-GGAGGATTTGATATTCACCTGGCCCG-3′ that yield a 350-bp product. The VIC Tg mice were described previously (23Tomioka M. Shirotani K. Iwata N. Lee H.J. Yang F. Cole G.M. Seyama Y. Saido T.C. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 108: 18-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We used the line of mice with the highest expression of VIC for the present study. Intrahippocampal Injection of KA—Administration of KA (1 nmol) into the hippocampal CA1 region of 6-month-old nTg, VIC Tg (23Tomioka M. Shirotani K. Iwata N. Lee H.J. Yang F. Cole G.M. Seyama Y. Saido T.C. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 108: 18-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and hCAST Tg mice was performed as described previously (23Tomioka M. Shirotani K. Iwata N. Lee H.J. Yang F. Cole G.M. Seyama Y. Saido T.C. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 108: 18-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Transcardial perfusion of the mice for biochemical and neuropathological studies was performed 4 and 24 h and 7 days after the KA injection. All the animal experiments were performed in accordance with our institutional guidelines. Western Blot Analysis of hCAST Expression in the Brain—Levels of Tg hCAST protein in different brain regions of untreated nTg and Tg mice were examined by means of immunoblot analysis. The brain tissue samples taken from the mice were homogenized in 10 ml/g tissue ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease/phosphatase inhibitor mixture) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts (10 μg of protein) of the resultant supernatants were employed for immunoblot analysis with the monoclonal anti-hCAST antibody. Histochemical and Immunohistochemical Studies—Mice under deep anesthesia were transcardially perfused with 15 ml of ice-cold PBS, followed by 20 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (23Tomioka M.

Brain Res. 2002; 108: 18-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). 4-μm-thick paraffin sections and 20-μm-thick frozen sections of the brains were immunostained based on either a standard protocol for immunofluorescence staining (23Tomioka M.

Brain Res. 2002; 108: 18-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or the tyramide signal amplification method with a TSA-Direct kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using antibodies described below. We employed the staining techniques based on the method described by Wang et al. (28Wang G. Achim C.L. Hamilton R.L. Wiley C.A. Soontornniyomkij V. Methods. 1999; 18: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). for double or triple fluorescence labeling. Viability of the hippocampal neurons was studied by NeuN immunostaining; cell morphology and DNA fragmentation were monitored by cresyl violet staining and transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay (Apoptosis Detection System; Promega, Madison, WI), respectively. Antibodies and Dilutions—Rabbit polyclonal antibody against calpain-generated C-terminal fragment of α-spectrin, the 150-kDa fragment (1:200 dilution) (29Saido T.C. Yokota M. Nagao S. Yamaura I. Tani E. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25239-25243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used for monitoring the magnitude of the calpain activity. In addition, we developed rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the calpain-generated N-terminal fragment of α-spectrin, the 136-kDa fragment (1:2,000 dilution), and the caspase-generated actin fragment, clact32 (1:2,000 dilution), using the synthetic peptides CQQQEVY and CYELPD, respectively (30Yang F.

Tani E. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25239-25243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also raised a polyclonal antibody against mCAST using the synthetic peptide CKKTEEVSKPKAKEDARHS. We used a mouse monoclonal antibody to hCAST (CSL1–5; 1:1,000 dilution; Takara Biomed). Mouse monoclonal antibodies to tau used here include T49 (1:500 dilution; murine tau-specific, phosphorylation-independent) (32Mawal-Dewan M. Henley J. Van de Voorde A. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V. M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30981-30987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and AT8 (1:2,000 dilution; phosphorylated tau-specific; Innogenetics) (33Goedert M. Jakes R. Crowther R.A. Six J.

The following antibodies to neurofilament (NF) subunits were employed for immunostaining: mouse monoclonal RMdO9 to nonphosphorylated NFH (1:500 dilution) (34Carden M.J. Trojanowski J.Q. Schlaepfer W.W. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3489-3504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); RMO24 to phosphorylated NFH (1:500 dilution) (34Carden M.J. Trojanowski J.Q. Schlaepfer W.W. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3489-3504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); RMO189 to phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated NFM (1:500 dilution) (34Carden M.J. Trojanowski J.Q. Schlaepfer W.W. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3489-3504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and rabbit antisera against NFL (aNFL; 1:1,000 dilution) (35Tu P.H. Elder G. Lazzarini R.A. Nelson D. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1629-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Other antibodies used in the present study are as follows: mouse monoclonal antibodies to MAP2 (AP20; 1:10 dilution; Roche Diagnostics), α-tubulin (DM1A; 1:1,000 dilution; Sigma), synaptophysin (1:50 dilution; Progen Biotechnik), and NeuN (1:2,000 dilution; Chemicon); and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to SV2A (1:100 dilution; Calbiochem-Novabiochem), GluR1 (1:1,000 dilution; Chemicon), mGluR2/3 (1:1,000 dilution; Chemicon), and Cdk5 activator p25/p35 (C19; 1:1,000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Statistical Analysis—The significance of differences between groups was examined by means of either t statistics or multiple comparisons by Fisher's LSD test following ANOVA. The hCAST Tg mice robustly expressed the transgene-derived protein in the forebrain regions. One of the founders that stably expressed hCAST showed the highest copy number of transgenes and the highest level of hCAST protein expression (Fig. 1A). This line of mice (L7) was used for the following experiments. The regional distribution of the overexpressed hCAST was analyzed by immunohistochemistry with anti-hCAST antibody (Fig. 1, B and C). The brain calpastatin activity in biochemical terms, defined as the activity to inhibit purified bovine m-calpain activity (36Nagao S. Saido T.C. Akita Y. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 1178-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), was 3.05 times greater in the Tg mice than in the nTg controls. The transgene-derived hCAST was highly expressed in neurons of the hippocampal formation and neocortex (Fig. 1C). Similar to the endogenous mCAST (Fig. 1D), hCAST was present mainly in the neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, and synaptic terminals (Fig. 1E). Double immunolabeling clearly demonstrates the high level expression of hCAST in the presynaptic terminals (Fig. 1F) and dendrites (Fig. 1G). None of the hCAST Tg mice exhibited marked motor or behavioral impairments at any age up to 15 months. In addition, there was no significant difference in body weight or longevity between the Tg and nTg mice. Immunohistochemical analyses for cytoskeletal components and synaptic markers (see “Materials and Methods”) also revealed no pronounced abnormalities in the amounts and distributions of these molecules in the brain of Tg mice at any age. KA-induced calpain activation was prominently suppressed in the hippocampus of hCAST Tg mice (Fig. 2). Immunohistochemistry using antibodies to the 150-kDa fragment (data not shown) and the 136-kDa fragment (Fig. 2, A and B) of calpain-cleaved α-spectrin (fodrin) revealed calpain activation in the hippocampal CA1 neurons 4 h after the KA injection. The 136-kDa fragment immunoreactivity in the ipsilateral hippocampus of the hCAST mice was significantly decreased by 63% in comparison with that of the nTg mice (Fig. 2E). Caspase activation visualized by means of immunostaining for a 32-kDa fragment of caspase-cleaved actin, fractin (clact32), was observed primarily in the CA3 sector 4 h after the KA injection (Fig. 2B) and spread to the CA1 region by 24 h (Fig. 2, G and H). The clact32 immunoreactivity represents activation of the caspase cascade (30Yang F. Sun X. Beech W. Teter B. Wu S. Sigel J. Vinters H.V. Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 379-389PubMed Google Scholar). The calpain activation preceded the caspase activation in the CA1 region, and the hCAST Tg mice exhibited diminution of not only the 136-kDa fragment signals but also clact32 staining (Fig. 2, F and I), implying a requirement of calpain activation for the caspase activation in the CA1 neurons. The VIC Tg mice showed a marked suppression of caspase activity, but not calpain activity at all, in the hippocampus at every time point when compared with the nTg mice (Fig. 2, D–F and J). Overexpression of hCAST also halted excitotoxicity-induced progressive loss of hippocampal neurons. The majority of the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 neurons exhibited apparent atrophy and pyknosis as shown by cresyl violet staining 24 h after the KA administration (Fig. 3, A–C). No significant difference in the number of pyknotic neurons was observed among the nTg, hCAST Tg, and VIC Tg mice at this time point, although shrinkage of the neuronal cytoplasm was less severe in the hCAST Tg mice than in the nTg and VIC mice. Additionally, there was no significant difference in the number of TUNEL-positive neurons among the three groups of mice at any time point after the KA treatment (data not shown). The CA1 region of the three groups of mice also showed similar reductions of NeuN immunoreactivity (Fig. 3, D–F and J) 24 h after the KA injection. In contrast, there was a striking difference in the amount of NeuN-positive nuclei 7 days after the KA treatment (Fig. 3, G–I and J). Notably, the hCAST Tg mice did not show any progression of the NeuN decline from 24 h to 7 days, unlike the nTg and VIC Tg mice. These results indicate that inhibition of calpains, but not caspases, protected hippocampal neurons against KA-triggered subacute death, whereas the suppression of calpain or caspase activities did not modulate acute excitotoxic neuronal degeneration in the present experimental paradigm. Dendrites and axons in hCAST Tg mice retained their integrities in the course of KA-induced neurodegeneration in a manner much better than those in nTg and VIC Tg mice (Fig. 4). Although the dendritic marker, MAP2, showed a pronounced reduction in the entire hippocampal formation, except for the dentate gyrus, of the nTg and VIC Tg mice 24 h after the KA injection, the reduction of MAP2 immunoreactivity in the hCAST Tg mouse hippocampus was significantly smaller (left panels in Fig. 4). The retention of the MAP2 immunoreactivity in the hCAST Tg mice was also observed 7 days after the treatment. Although the tau immunoreactivity in the hippocampal axons on the injection side decreased to a lesser extent than the MAP2 signals (middle panels in Fig. 4), the entire hippocampal formation of the nTg and VIC Tg mice exhibited a remarkable and progressive decrease in the tau immunoreactivity after the KA treatment. In contrast to these two groups of mice, no marked reduction of the tau immunostaining was found in the hCAST Tg mice. None of the mice showed marked alterations in the tau immunoreactivity in the contralateral hippocampus 24 h after the KA administration, whereas the intensity of the tau staining was significantly attenuated 7 days after the treatment (right panels in Fig. 4). Taking these observations together, suppression of the KA-induced calpain activation is likely to have rescued neurons of the entire hippocampal formation from both acute and subacute cytoskeletal degeneration of the dendrites and axons. However, subacute loss of axonal tau in the contralateral hippocampus, presumably caused by Wallerian degeneration, was not overtly inhibited by attenuation of calpain activity. We next quantified the levels of the cytoskeletal components 24 h after the KA injection by Western blotting (Fig. 5A). The 136-kDa fragment immunoreactivity was markedly elevated in the ipsilateral hippocampal samples from the nTg and hCAST Tg mice, and the hCAST Tg mice showed 32% reduction in the 136-kDa fragment signal intensity as compared with the nTg mice, consistent with the immunohistochemical observations. The appearance of the 136-kDa fragment signal in the contralateral hippocampus was also significantly lower in the hCAST Tg mice than in the nTg mice. In accordance with the immunohistochemical data, the reduction of the MAP2 signal in the ipsilateral hippocampus was suppressed in the hCAST Tg mice. The T49 level, representing total tau, in the ipsilateral hippocampus also remained preserved in the hCAST Tg mice in comparison with the nTg mice. The levels of phosphorylated tau proteins assessed by AT8 immunostaining were elevated in both of the nTg and hCAST Tg mice, and the ratio of phosphorylated tau to total tau (AT8/T49) also showed a marked increase in the nTg mice (Fig. 5B). Consistently, the increase in the AT8/T49 ratio was ∼30% smaller in the hCAST Tg than in the nTg mice. We then investigated proteolytic cleavage of p35, the modulator of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), to p25, since Cdk5 is one of the kinases capable of phosphorylating tau (37Kusakawa G. Saito T. Onuki R. Ishiguro K. Kishimoto T. Hisanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17166-17172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 38Lee M.S. Kwon Y.T. Li M. Peng J. Friedlander R.M. Tsai L.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). The p25 signal was increased in the KA-treated mice (Fig. 5A), and the ratio of p25 to p35 was significantly elevated in the ipsilateral hippocampus (Fig. 5C). Notably, the p25/p35 ratio of the nTg mice was ∼2-fold greater than that in the hCAST Tg mice. Hence, the conversion of p35 to p25 may be promoted by the KA-induced calpain activation, giving rise to the enhanced tau phosphorylation by activated Cdk5. Consistently, cytoplasmic AT8 immunoreactivity, representing tau phosphorylation, increased in the CA1 and CA3 neurons of the KA-treated mice (Fig. 5, D and E), implying that the phosphorylated tau remained unbound to MTs and may consequently accumulate in the neuronal soma. Double immunolabeling also revealed apparent dendritic colocalization of calpain activity with MAP2 in contrast to its limited colocalization with tau only in a small subset of axons (Fig. 6), providing a plausible explanation for the observation that progression of axonal cytoskeletal disorganization was much slower than that of dendritic disruption (see Fig. 7). Furthermore, the nTg mice exhibited a remarkable KA-induced reduction of endogenous mCAST in the CA1 region, where a drastic elevation of the calpain activity and substantial loss of MAP2 took place (Fig. 6). In the hCAST Tg mice, calpain activation as well as dendritic pathology was largely suppressed in the areas where hCAST was abundantly expressed. Hence, the balance between calpain and CAST activities seems to primarily regulate cytoskeletal derangements during excitotoxic neuronal insults.Fig. 7A proposed scheme for calpain-mediated neurodegenerative processes focusing on cytoskeletal disorganization. Excitotoxic insults induce calpain and caspase activation, whereas CAST and VIC can suppress activation of these proteases in a specific manner. Reduction of CAST may arise as a consequence of the calpain activation, driving a vicious cycle that further deteriorates the balance of the calpain-calpastatin system. Calpain is activated primarily in the somato-dendritic compartments of neurons and consequently degrades dendritic MAP2 and cytoplasmic MT-unbound tau in a preferential manner. Tau in the neuronal soma also undergoes hyper-phosphorylation catalyzed by Cdk5, which can be activated by a Cdk5 activator fragment (p25) converted from its intact form (p35) as a consequence of calpain-mediated proteolysis. Dendritic cytoskeletons become deranged as well in these lo"

In mammalian systems, six different isoforms have been identified, which function in the import of exogenous fatty acids or in the activation of very long-chain fatty acids. This has led to controversy as to whether these proteins function as membrane-bound fatty acid transporters or as acyl-CoA synthetases, which activate long-chain fatty acids concomitant with transport. The yeast FATP orthologue, Fat1p, is a dual functional protein and is required for both the import of long-chain fatty acids and the activation of very long-chain fatty acids; these activities intrinsic to Fat1p are separable functions. To more precisely define the roles of the different mammalian isoforms in fatty acid trafficking, the six murine proteins (mmFATP1–6) were expressed and characterized in a genetically defined yeast strain, which cannot transport long-chain fatty acids and has reduced long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase activity (fat1Δ faa1Δ). Each isoform was evaluated for fatty acid transport, fatty acid activation (using C18:1, C20:4, and C24:0 as substrates), and accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids. Murine FATP1, -2, and -4 complemented the defects in fatty acid transport and very long-chain fatty acid activation associated with a deletion of the yeast FAT1 gene; mmFATP3, -5, and -6 did not complement the transport function even though each was localized to the yeast plasma membrane. Both mmFATP3 and -6 activated C20:4 and C20:4, while the expression of mmFATP5 did not substantially increase acyl-CoA synthetases activities using the substrates tested. These data support the conclusion that the different mmFATP isoforms play unique roles in fatty acid trafficking, including the transport of exogenous long-chain fatty acids.

Definition of the biochemical mechanisms promoting the selective import and/or export of exogenous long-chain fatty acids (C14–C20) has been the subject of considerable research. Some biophysical studies are consistent with the hypothesis that exogenous fatty acids partition into and flip between the membrane surfaces and do not require proteins to mediate translocation (1Hamilton J.A.

However, it has been recently reported that membrane flip of exogenous fatty acids decreases with membrane curvature and is fundamentally a rate-limiting process (3Kampf J.P. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol.

Using intracellular acrylodan-labeled fatty acid-binding protein to monitor fatty acid transport in 3T3F422A adipocytes, Kampf and Kleinfeld (3Kampf J.P. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol.

Additional support for a protein-mediated fatty acid transport system includes: demonstration that protease treatment decreases fatty acid uptake (6Stremmel W. Berk P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3086-3090Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), specific labeling of membrane proteins with affinity labeled fatty acid analogues (7Harmon C.M. Luce P. Beth A.H. Abumrad N.A. J.

These investigations using both genetic and biochemical methods have shown that proteins participate in fatty acid transport, which likely reflects their roles in promoting specificity and targeting into downstream metabolic pools. Therefore, the passive diffusion hypothesis does not explain the selectivity and specificity of fatty acid transport in various cells and tissues.Among the diverse protein families targeted as specific plasma membrane bound fatty acid transport proteins are the fatty acid transport proteins (FATP). 1The abbreviations used are: FATP, fatty acid transport protein; ACSL, long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase; ACSVL, very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase; C1-BODIPY-C12, 4,4-difluoro-5-methyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-dodecanoic acid; YNB, yeast nitrogen base; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; mm, Mus musculis. 1The abbreviations used are: FATP, fatty acid transport protein; ACSL, long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase; ACSVL, very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase; C1-BODIPY-C12, 4,4-difluoro-5-methyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-dodecanoic acid; YNB, yeast nitrogen base; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; mm, Mus musculis. Schaffer and Lodish (13Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) identified the first murine FATP (designated mmFATP1) in 1994 using expression cloning and suggested this protein was specifically involved in the trafficking of exogenous long-chain fatty acids across the adipocyte plasma membrane. Our laboratory subsequently identified and characterized the Saccharomyces cerevisiae FATP orthologue Fat1p and demonstrated its role in the transport of exogenous fatty acids (14Faergeman N.J. DiRusso C.C. Elberger A. Knudsen J. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8531-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that Fat1p and a cognate long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL) (either Faa1p or Faa4p) form a functional complex at the plasma membrane and are involved in the coupled transport and activation of exogenous fatty acids (15Zou Z.

Fat1p and ACSL are both necessary for fatty acid uptake when cells are grown anaerobically and require an exogenous source of unsaturated fatty acids (16Faergeman N.J. Black P.N. Zhao X.D. Knudsen J. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37051-37059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have demonstrated that mmFATP1 is fully functional in the trafficking of exogenous long-chain fatty acids when expressed in yeast (17DiRusso C.C. Connell E.J. Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Hansen J.K. Black P.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4422-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Five additional murine FATP isoforms have been identified by sequence identities and similarities to FATP1 and their fatty acid transport activities characterized (18Hirsch D. Stahl A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8625-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 19Stahl A. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 722-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Furthermore, over the past 2 years murine knock-out models for mmFATP1 (20Kim J.K. Gimeno R.E. Higashimori T. Kim H.J. Choi H. Punreddy S. Mozell R.L. Tan G. Stricker-Krongrad A. Hirsch D.J.

Studies describing the knockout of mmFATP4 are consistent with the notion this protein is essential, although those describing the mmFATP1 knock-out show more subtle perturbations in fatty acid metabolism. Mice with a deletion in mmFATP2 were evaluated for very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase activity and β-oxidation, both of which were reduced. Fatty acid transport has not yet been evaluated in mmFATP2 knock-out mice. In all three cases, the experimental evidence is consistent with specific defects in fatty acid trafficking attesting to the importance of these proteins in lipid homeostasis.In the early studies on the FATPs, it was noted that the proteins shared significant sequence homologies and domain organization to the ACSL enzymes placing the FATP proteins in the superfamily of adenylate forming acyl-CoA synthetases (13Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 14Faergeman N.J. DiRusso C.C. Elberger A. Knudsen J. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8531-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This led to the concern that apparent fatty acid transport function was due to activation coupled with metabolism rather than transport. However, our work demonstrated that the deletion of the Fat1p structural gene (FAT1) in yeast did not have any impact on the long-chain (C14:0, C16:0, and C18:1) acyl-CoA synthetase activities (14Faergeman N.J. DiRusso C.C. Elberger A. Knudsen J. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8531-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies by Watkins et al.

More recent work has shown both mmFATP1 (27Coe N.R. Smith A.J. Frohnert B.I. Watkins P.A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36300-36304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and mmFATP4 (28Herrmann T. Buchkremer F. Gosch I. Hall A.M. Bernlohr D.A. Stremmel W. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 270: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) have ACSVL activity as well. These findings presented somewhat of a quagmire, as in general fatty acid transport appeared to be restricted to long-chain fatty acids, whereas the FATP-dependent activation activity had a preference toward very long-chain fatty acids. Recent studies by Hall et al. (29Hall A.M. Smith A.J. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43008-43013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 30Hall A.M. Wiczer B.M.

The later study also showed that tissues from a FATP4 null mouse were defective in very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase activity; the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase activities were unchanged in all of the tissues examined (30Hall A.M.

An additional complication comes from studies that have characterized mmFATP5 as a bile acid-CoA ligase (31Mihalik S.J. Steinberg S.J. Pei Z. Park J. Kim do G. Heinzer A.K. Dacremont G. Wanders R.J.

Previously our laboratory constructed a yeast strain defective in fatty acid transport (fat1Δ) with reduced ACSL activity (faa1Δ), which we employed in the present work to define the biochemical properties of the murine FATP isoforms (15Zou Z.

This work is the first side-by-side comparison of the different mmFATP isoforms, which demonstrates they have unique biochemical properties that are likely to be related to their roles in trafficking of fatty acids and other hydrophobic compounds, including bile acids. More specifically these data are consistent with the notion that mmFATP1, mmFATP2, and mmFATP4 can substitute for Fat1p in the long-chain fatty acid transport pathway, whereas mmFATP3, mmFATP5, and mmFATP6 cannot.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains, Media, and Materials—The S. cerevisiae strains LS2086 (faa1Δ1.9::HIS3 fat1Δ0.48::G418) and YB525 (faa1Δ1.9::HIS3 faa4Δ0.3::LYS) used in this study have been previously described and are detailed under “Results” (15Zou Z.

Yeast-supplemented minimal media contained 0.67% yeast nitrogen base (YNB), 2% dextrose (YNBD), adenine (20 mg/liter), uracil (20 mg/liter), and amino acids as required. To induce the protein expression, cells were grown in YNB containing 2% galactose and 2% raffinose (YNBGR). Cells were grown in minimal YNBD media overnight, subcultured in minimal YNBGR liquid media, and grown to mid-log phase at 30 °C. For the experiments monitoring protein expression and acyl-CoA synthetase determination, 25 ml of cell culture was grown under inducing conditions for ∼16 h to midlogarithmic phase (optical density monitored at A600 = 0.8–1.0) and then harvested. For complementation studies, cells were grown on minimal YNBGR plates supplemented with 45 μm cerulenin and 100 μm oleate as detailed in the figure legends.Yeast extract, yeast peptone, and yeast nitrogen base were obtained from Difco. Oleic acid was obtained from Sigma. 3H- or 14C-labeled fatty acids were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and American Radiolabeled Chemicals. 4,4-Difluoro-5-methyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-dodecanoic acid (C1-BODIPY-C12) was purchased from Molecular Probes. Enzymes required for all DNA manipulations were from Promega, Invitrogen, New England BioLabs, U. S. Biochemical Corp., or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-T7 antibody was purchased from Invitrogen.Construction of mmFATP Expression Plasmids—The yeast expression vector pDB121 was generated by inserting CYC terminator (CYCt) into YEpGALSET983 cleaved with AccIII and HindIII. Like YEpGAL-SET983, pDB121 is used to generate T7-tagged chimeras. The CYC terminator allows efficient transcription termination of the mammalian coding sequences expressed from the GAL10 promoter in yeast. CYCt was amplified by PCR using pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) as template using the forward primer 5′-GTAGAAGCTTCCATCACCATTGAGTTTCTAG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GTAGTCCGGAAGTCAGTGAGCGAGGAAGCG-3′.The coding sequence of FAT1 was cloned into the SacI-KpnI sites of pDB121 to generate pDB304.

Following growth, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended to a density of 4.8 × 108 cells/ml in 10 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The resuspended cells were lysed using glass beads by vigorous vortexing on ice for 10 min; total membrane and plasma membranes were isolated as detailed by Zinser and Daum (35Zinser E. Daum G. Yeast. 1995; 11: 493-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). For the plasma membranes two discontinuous sucrose gradients were routinely used. The expression of the mmFATP isoforms in total cell lysates, total membrane, and purified plasma membranes were monitored using Western blots probed with anti-T7 antibody. Anti-Gas1p (gift from Dr. Howard Reizman) and anti-Sec61p (gift from Dr. Randy Schekman) were used as plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum markers, respectively. Oleoyl-CoA synthetase activities were determined in total membrane and plasma membrane fractions as detailed below.Fatty Acid Transport Monitored Using the Fluorescent Fatty Acid C1-BODIPY-C12—Following growth under selective conditions, cells were harvested and resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS (6 × 107 cells/ml). All steps were performed at room temperature. Cells were incubated with 5 μm C1-BODIPY-C12 for 3 min, washed with PBS containing 15 μm fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin three times, and resuspended in PBS for measurement of fluorescence on a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian Instruments, Walnut Creek, CA) (36Li H. Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 336: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). C1-BODIPY-C12 was excited at 480 nm and emission was scanned from 500 to 600 nm. The maximum emission (at 515 nm) was used to quantitatively determine the amount of C1-BODIPY-C12 taken up by cells by comparison with a standard curve generated using serial dilutions of C1-BODIPY-C12 of a known concentration. The values presented represent the average from at least three independent experiments. All experiments were subjected to analysis of variance (StatView, SAS Institute, Inc.).Accumulation of C1-BODIPY-C12 was also monitored using confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Following the fluorescence measurements detailed above, cells were placed on a poly-l-lysine-treated multiwell slide (ICN, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA) and visualized on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Inc., Thornwood, NY). The instrument settings for brightness and contrast were optimized to ensure that the confocal laser-scanning microscope was set for full dynamic range relative to cells without Fat1p (faa1Δ fat1Δ cells transformed with the vector pDB121) and those expressing yeast Fat1p (faa1Δ fat1Δ cells transformed with pDB304 (FAT1)). The same settings were used for all subsequent image collections. An argon laser source was used for imaging with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 505 nm.Quantification of Fatty Acyl-CoA Synthetase Activities—Yeast cells were diluted from overnight cultures in YNBD and subcultured to 0.1 A600 in 25 ml of YNBGR under selective conditions for the plasmid and grown to 1.0 A600. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (1800 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), washed once with PBS, and resuspended in 1.0 ml of extraction buffer (1.2 m sorbitol, 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 4 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to a density of 7.5 × 108 cells/ml. The samples were sonicated on ice for 2 min with intervals of 3 s on/off. Sonicates were clarified by centrifugation (300 × g, 3 min, 4 °C) and crude extracts were used to assess acyl-CoA synthetase activities. Standard acyl-CoA synthetase activity assays were performed as previously described (16Faergeman N.J. Black P.N. Zhao X.D. Knudsen J. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37051-37059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In the experiments defining the oleoyl-CoA synthetase activities, total membrane, and plasma membrane fractions, sorbitol was not included in the cell lysis buffer and the cells were lysed using glass beads as opposed to sonication. To preserve membrane integrity, this method of lysis is less efficient, which in turn results in lower acyl-CoA synthetase activities in these samples. These experiments were analyzed independently from those completed using whole cell extracts. Protein concentrations in the crude extracts, total membrane, and purified plasma membrane were determined using a commercial assay kit employing bovine serum albumin as standard (Bio-Rad). The values presented represent the average from at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. All experiments were subjected to analysis of variance (StatView, SAS Institute, Inc.).Fatty Acid Analysis—Cells were grown overnight in YNBD supplemented with amino acids as required and diluted to an A600 of 0.1 in 100 ml of YNBGR. When the cell density reached A600 of 0.8–1.0, cell growth and metabolism were stopped by the addition of 1/10 volume of 6.6 m perchloric acid. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 5000 × g (4 °C). The pellet was resuspended in 10 mm perchloric acid and the sample was transferred to a 15-ml glass tube. Acid-washed cells were again pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatant removed by aspiration. Total lipids extraction and fatty acid analysis were conducted as detailed (34Zou Z. DiRusso C.C.

Wnt proteins induce myogenic specification and cardiac myogenesis. Here, we elucidated the effect of Wnts on differentiation of CPCs to cardiomyogenic cells. CPCs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from healthy volunteers and co-cultured with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. 6–10 days after co-culture, cardiac differentiation was determined by α-sarcomeric actinin staining of human lymphocyte antigen-positive cells (fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis) and mRNA expression of human myosin heavy chain and atrial natriuretic peptide. Supplementation of co-cultures with Wnt11-conditioned medium significantly enhanced the differentiation of CPCs to cardiomyocytes (1.7 ± 0.3-fold), whereas Wnt3A-conditioned medium showed no effect. Cell fusion was not affected by Wnt11-conditioned medium. Because Wnts inhibit glycogen synthase kinase-3β, we further determined whether the glycogen synthase kinase-3β inhibitor LiCl also enhanced cardiac differentiation of CPCs. However, LiCl (10 mm) did not affect CPC differentiation. In contrast, Wnt11-conditioned medium time-dependently activated protein kinase C (PKC). Moreover, the PKC inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide I and III significantly blocked differentiation of CPCs to cardiomyocytes. PKC activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate significantly increased CPC differentiation to a similar extent as compared with Wnt11-conditioned medium. Our data demonstrate that Wnt11, but not Wnt3A, augments cardiomyogenic differentiation of human CPCs. Wnt11 promotes cardiac differentiation via the non-canonical PKC-dependent signaling pathway.

Cardiomyocytes have been generated from murine and human embryonic stem cells as well as from embryonic endothelial cells (1Muller M. Fleischmann B.K. Selbert S. Ji G.J. Endl E. Middeler G.

Meanwhile, increasing evidence suggests that adult stem and progenitor cells also have the capacity to differentiate to the cardiomyogenic lineage. Bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, side population cells, and cardiac stem cells showed expression of cardiac marker proteins after infusion in animal models after myocardial infarction (3Makino S.

However, very recent studies questioned whether c-kit+/lin– bone marrow-derived stem cells can acquire a cardiac phenotype after injection in a mouse model after acute myocardial infarction (8Murry C.E. Soonpaa M.H. Reinecke H. Nakajima H. Nakajima H.O. Rubart M. Pasumarthi K.B. Virag J.I. Bartelmez S.H. Poppa V. Bradford G. Dowell J.D. Williams D.A. Field L.J.

Nature. 2004; 428: 668-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). Recently, cell fusion was proposed as an additional mechanism used by bone marrow-derived cells to acquire a cardiac phenotype (10Nygren J.M. Jovinge S. Breitbach M. Sawen P. Roll W. Hescheler J. Taneera J. Fleischmann B.K. Jacobsen S.E. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some studies showed that both fusion and differentiation occur in vivo after infusion of cardiac stem cells in a model of myocardial infarction (7Oh H. Bradfute S.B. Gallardo T.D. Nakamura T. Gaussin V. Mishina Y. Pocius J. Michael L.H. Behringer R.R. Garry D.J. Entman M.L. Schneider M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12313-12318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying cardiomyogenic differentiation of adult stem or progenitor cells are mainly unclear. Recent studies provided evidence that the extracellular “niche” exerts a critical role for the developmental fate of stem and progenitor cells (11Blau H.M. Brazelton T.R. Weimann J.M. Cell. 2001; 105: 829-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Based on this concept, a co-culture system of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes was established to mimic the cardiac environment (12Condorelli G. Borello U. De Angelis L. Latronico M. Sirabella D. Coletta M. Galli R. Balconi G. Follenzi A. Frati G. Cusella De Angelis M.G. Gioglio L. Amuchastegui S. Adorini L. Naldini L. Vescovi A. Dejana E. Cossu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Circulation. 2003; 108: 2070-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) with neonatal cardiomyocytes triggered the expression of cardiac genes. In this co-culture assay, gap-junctional communication between neonatal cardiomyocytes and differentiating stem or progenitor cells was detected (12Condorelli G. Borello U. De Angelis L. Latronico M.

Functional activity of the differentiated circulating progenitor cells was further documented by showing oscillating calcium transients after pacing (13Badorff C. Brandes R.P. Popp R. Rupp S.

These data suggest that the co-culture system might be useful as an experimental model to study cardiomyogenic differentiation of adult progenitor cells. Proteins of the Wnt family are known as regulators of cardiomyogenesis. Wnt genes relate to Drosophila wingless and encode for secreted glycoproteins (15Huelsken J. Behrens J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3977-3978Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar).

Activation of the so-called canonical pathway leads to stabilization of β-catenin through inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β, to β-catenin-dependent activation of T-cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer factor transcription factors, and to induction of Wnt-responsive genes (16Olson E.N. Schneider M.D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1937-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In contrast, Wnt11 was shown to signal through a β-catenin-independent non-canonical pathway involving protein kinase C (PKC) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) (17Pandur P. Lasche M. Eisenberg L.M. Kuhl M. Nature. 2002; 418: 636-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Whereas initial studies considered Wnts as negative regulators of heart muscle formation in Xenopus and chicken embryos, more recent studies demonstrated that Wnts induced myogenic specification and mammalian cardiac myogenesis (17Pandur P.

Schneider M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5834-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Wnt11 induced cardiac differentiation in Xenopus and in murine embryonic cell lines (17Pandur P. Lasche M. Eisenberg L.M. Kuhl M.

Commun. 2004; 325: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Furthermore, combined signaling of Wnt5A, Wnt5B, and Wnt7A induced myogenic commitment of adult resident CD45+ stem cells during muscle regeneration (18Polesskaya A. Seale P. Rudnicki M.A. Cell. 2003; 113: 841-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Thus, Wnts are attractive candidates to mediate myogenic differentiation. Therefore, we investigated the effect of Wnt3A- and Wnt11-conditioned medium on cardiac differentiation of human progenitor cells and analyzed the underlying signaling mechanisms. Cell Culture Experiments—Neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated from 0- to 1-day-old Wistar rats and cultivated as described previously (13Badorff C. Brandes R.P. Popp R. Rupp S. Urbich C. Aicher A. Fleming I. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1024-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). CPCs were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers by density gradient centrifugation followed by plating onto fibronectin-coated plates using serum (20% fetal calf serum)- and growth factor-supplemented endothelial cell culture medium (13Badorff C.

After 3 days in culture, adherent CPCs were labeled with Dil-ac-LDL (2.5 μg/ml; Cell Systems, St. Katharinen, Germany) for 60 min at 37 °C followed by three washing steps with phosphate-buffered saline as described previously (13Badorff C.

Expression of endothelial markers such as von Willbrandt factor, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, and vascular endothelial-cadherin was routinely confirmed (13Badorff C. Brandes R.P. Popp R.

CPCs (1.5 × 105) were mixed with freshly isolated cardiomyocytes at a ratio of 1:3 (13Badorff C. Brandes R.P. Popp R. Rupp S. Urbich C. Aicher A. Fleming I. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1024-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). LacZ-, Wnt3A-, and Wnt11-conditioned media were generated and functionally tested as described previously (17Pandur P.

Immunostaining and Flow Cytometry Analysis—Co-cultured cells were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated antibodies recognizing human HLA-DR and HLA class I (both from Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) followed by permeabilization using the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Pharmingen) and staining with directly fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated (Pierce) anti-α-sarcomeric actinin antibody (clone EA-53; Sigma) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated (Pierce) anti-troponin I antibody (Sigma). At least 20,000 cells were analyzed on a BD FACS-Calibur cell sorter (BD Biosciences). For immunostaining, cells were fixed with PLP buffer for 15 min on ice. After permeabilization with 0.2% saponin (Sigma), cells were incubated with α-sarcomeric actinin (1:600; Sigma), followed by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:100; Jackson Laboratories). Nuclei were counterstained with TO-PRO-3 iodide (Molecular Probes). Detection of Cell Fusion—Adenoviruses coding for enhanced GFP were generated by using pAdTrack-cytomegalovirus and pShuttle-cytomegalovirus (provided by B. Vogelstein) (22He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3236) Google Scholar). 1 day after isolation, cardiomyocytes were infected (multiplicity of infection = 20). After 3 days, 98.7 ± 1.1% of cardiomyocytes were GFP+ and subsequently used for co-cultivation with Dil-ac-LDL-labeled CPCs for an additional 6 days. GFP+/Dil-ac-LDL+ fused cells were measured by FACS at the time point indicated. The data were confirmed by manual counting of double-positive cells. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR Analyses—Total RNA was isolated by using TRIzol (Invitrogen). RNA was subjected to RT-PCR by using the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR with platinium Taq (Invitrogen). Because RNAs were from different species (human and rat), we designed human-specific primers to specifically monitor expression of human genes. Primers are as follows: human ANF, 5′-CTAGGTCAGACCAGAGCT-3′ and 5′-CATTCGGCTCACTGAGCA-3′); human β-MHC, 5′-CACAGCCCTCAAAGAGGC-3′ and 5′-CAGGGTGGAAGAGCCAAC-3′); and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′ and 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′. Rat mRNA was controlled by PCR against rat ANF (data not shown). Western Blot Analysis—CPCs were incubated in LacZ-conditioned medium for 3 h. Then, the medium was changed to LacZ- or Wnt11-conditioned medium as indicated. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) containing 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation, the supernatants were collected and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and incubated with anti-phospho-PKC (pan) antibody (Cell Signaling) or anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. Bound antibody was visualized by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody or donkey anti-rabbit antibody (both from Amersham Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test was used for the comparison between groups based on the original data. Effect of Wnt3A- and Wnt11-conditioned Medium on Cardiac Differentiation—Co-culturing of human adult CPCs with rat neonatal cardiomyocytes induced cardiac differentiation of human CPCs, as demonstrated by RT-PCR directed against human MHC and ANF; immunostaining against MEF2, ANF, and α-sarcomeric actinin; and FACS analysis (Fig. 1, A and B) (13Badorff C.

A representative confocal image is shown in Fig. 1B. Moreover, human cells showed calcium transients (13Badorff C. Brandes R.P. Popp R. Rupp S. Urbich C. Aicher A. Fleming I. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1024-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) and contraction (data not shown). Human CPCs, which co-express cardiac marker proteins, may derive from fusion with cardiomyocytes. Therefore, we determined the incidence of fusion events. Fusion was evaluated by co-culture of GFP-infected cardiomyocytes with Dil-ac-LDL-labeled CPC. Cells positive for GFP and Dil-ac-LDL were considered as fused cells. To compare differentiation and fusion, we measured GFP+/Dil-ac-LDL+ fused cells and α-actinin+ human cells time-dependently (Fig. 1C). Before day 4 of the co-culture, the percentage of GFP+/Dil-ac-LDL+ fused cells and α-actinin+ human cells was comparable, suggesting that all cells, which acquired a cardiomyogenic phenotype, represent fused cells. However, after day 6 of co-culture, the percentage of α-actinin+ human cells was significantly higher than that of GFP+/Dil-ac-LDL+ fused cells, suggesting that differentiation starts after day 4 of co-culture. To test the functional effects of Wnts, Wnt3A- and Wnt11-conditioned medium was added to the co-culture system, and cardiac differentiation of CPCs was quantified by FACS analysis. Co-incubation of Wnt11-conditioned medium significantly increased the number of α-sarcomeric actinin+ human cells (Fig. 2, A and B) as well as troponin I+ human cells (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the addition of Wnt3A-conditioned medium did not alter the differentiation rate during co-culture (Fig. 2A). Although Wnt3A-conditioned medium did not affect differentiation, it activated the β-catenin target gene siamois in Xenopus animal cap cells, indicating proper function of the medium (21Sheldahl L.C. Park M. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2D). Control experiments confirmed that the Wnt11-conditioned medium did not affect survival of CPCs in the co-culture assay (Fig. 2E). Moreover, the addition of Wnt11-conditioned medium did not affect the number of GFP+/Dil-ac-LDL+ cells (Fig. 2F), indicating that Wnt11 enhances differentiation rather than fusion. In order to determine whether Wnt11 alone is sufficient to induce differentiation, CPCs were incubated with Wnt11-conditioned medium in the absence of cardiomyocytes. Although CPCs showed some morphological change (enlargement of cell size), no cardiac-specific proteins were detected at day 7 (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that Wnt11 enhances differentiation of CPCs induced by co-culture with rat cardiomyocytes but is not sufficient to induce differentiation per se. Wnt Signaling Pathways Involved in Cardiomyogenic Differentiation—Most Wnts signal via a canonical GSK-3β-dependent pathway. However, inhibition of GSK-3β by LiCl had no effect on the differentiation of CPCs to cardiomyocytes (Fig. 3A) but significantly increased the number of adherent surviving CPCs in the co-culture system (Fig. 3B). In order to test whether Wnt11 may act via a non-canonical pathway, we investigated the effect of Wnt11-conditioned medium on PKC activation. Wnt11-conditioned medium time-dependently induced phosphorylation and thus activation of PKC in CPCs (Fig. 3, C and D). Moreover, inhibition of PKC by bisindolylmaleimide I and bisindolylmaleimide III significantly reduced differentiation of CPCs to cardiomyogenic cells (Fig. 3A) and PKC phosphorylation (Fig. 3D). The enhanced differentiation induced by Wnt11-conditioned medium was also inhibited by the PKC inhibitor (70.6 ± 11.7%, p < 0.05). Controls confirmed that the inhibition of cardiac differentiation by the PKC inhibitor used was not caused by a reduced survival (data not shown). In addition, PKC activation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate significantly enhanced the CPC differentiation to 17.5 ± 4.6%. This increase was similar as compared with that of Wnt11-conditioned medium-treated cells (15.4 ± 2%). Because Wnt11 also activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase JNK, we examined the effect of the JNK inhibitor SP600125. However, addition of the JNK inhibitor did not affect cardiac differentiation of CPCs (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the combination of a PKC inhibitor with a JNK inhibitor was not superior to the PKC inhibitor alone (Fig. 3A), suggesting that JNK does not play a major role in cardiac differentiation in the co-culture assay. The data of the present study demonstrate that Wnt11 facilitates the differentiation of CPCs to cardiomyogenic cells. The addition of Wnt11 enhanced CPC differentiation. Interestingly, only Wnt11, but not Wnt3A, promoted cardiac differentiation. Wnt3A and related family members such as Wnt8a were recently shown to increase differentiation of PC19 cells to cardiomyocytes via the canonical GSK-3β signaling pathway (19Nakamura T. Sano M. Songyang Z. Schneider M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5834-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, other studies demonstrated that activation of the canonical Wnt pathway does not promote differentiation and even markedly inhibited differentiation of embryonic stem cells (23Sato N. Meijer L. Skaltsounis L. Greengard P. Brivanlou A.H. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). These conflicting reports in the literature regarding the responses of stem/progenitor cells toward Wnts may be due to the diversity of signaling cascades (canonical versus non-canonical) and possibly to the type and differentiation status of the stem/progenitor cell. Interestingly, in the present study, inhibition of GSK-3β did not affect differentiation but increased survival of CPCs, suggesting that the canonical Wnt pathway affects cell survival but not differentiation in this system. In line with these findings, Wnt11 activated the non-canonical PKC pathway in CPCs as shown previously in Xenopus embryonic pluripotent precursor cells (17Pandur P. Lasche M. Eisenberg L.M. Kuhl M. Nature. 2002; 418: 636-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). A causal contribution of the non-canonical PKC-dependent Wnt pathway for cardiac differentiation is supported by the finding that inhibition of PKC blocked cardiac differentiation, whereas activation of PKC increased cardiac differentiation of CPCs to a similar extent as compared with Wnt11-conditioned medium. In contrast, inhibition of JNK did not significantly affect differentiation. Taken together, these data indicate that the non-canonical PKC-dependent pathway plays a predominant role for cardiac differentiation, whereas JNK appears to be of minor importance. The question remains which PKC isoforms are involved? Because differentiation of CPCs to cardiac myocytes in the co-culture system is calcium-dependent (13Badorff C. Brandes R.P. Popp R. Rupp S. Urbich C. Aicher A. Fleming I. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1024-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate enhanced cardiac differentiation, it is tempting to speculate that the classical PKC isoforms, which require both calcium and lipids (α, β1, β2, and γ), are mediating the effect. Indeed, the PKC β1 and β2 isoforms are highly expressed in CPCs (data not shown). Although our study demonstrates that the non-canonical PKC pathway contributes to cardiac differentiation of CPCs, the upstream signaling remains to be determined. Wnt11 is known to act via the frizzled receptors Fz2 and Fz7. Both receptors are expressed in CPCs (data not shown). Importantly, Wnt11 was not sufficient to induce cardiac differentiation of CPCs in the absence of co-culturing with neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. Thus, Wnt11 rather amplifies cardiac differentiation induced by the physical interaction of CPCs with cardiomyocytes. Clearly, our data document that Wnt11 does not increase the number of human-derived cardiac myocytes by promoting cell fusion as assessed by co-cultivation of GFP-labeled cardiomyocytes with Dil-ac-LDL-labeled CPCs. Moreover, Wnt11 also promoted cardiac differentiation in a previously established experimental set-up (13Badorff C. Brandes R.P. Popp R. Rupp S. Urbich C. Aicher A. Fleming I. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1024-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), in which CPCs were co-cultured with fixed cardiomyocytes, which precludes fusion events (data not shown). Interestingly, previous studies showed that activation of Fz2 induces myocyte aggregation and adhesion in the presence of fibroblasts, resulting in activation and complex formation of cadherins (24Toyofuku T. Hong Z. Kuzuya T. Tada M. Hori M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 225-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, one may speculate that Wnt11 may amplify cell-to-cell aggregation and cadherin interactions, finally resulting in enhanced differentiation. Overall, the augmentation of cardiac differentiation of human adult progenitor cells may be well suited to promote cardiac regeneration by cell therapy.

These serve as docking sites for Src hyomology 2 domain-containing signal relay molecules, such as phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). PI3K is a major mediator of the metabolic actions of insulin, including its ability to promote glycogen synthesis and stimulate glucose transport (3Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Regulation of insulin action requires a balance between IR phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Several PTPs have been implicated as negative regulators of insulin signal transduction. Chief among these is protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a ubiquitously expressed, nonreceptor PTP localized on the endoplasmic reticulum (4Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A.

The physiological relevance of these observations was dramatically verified by mice lacking PTP1B (PTP1B–/– mice), which exhibit markedly increased insulin sensitivity and enhanced insulin signaling, with substantially increased IR and IRS1 tyrosyl phosphorylation in liver and muscle (16Elchebly M.

Furthermore, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies reveal enhanced whole body glucose disposal in PTP1B–/– mice (17Klaman L.D. Boss O. Peroni O.D. Kim J.K. Martino J.L. Zabolotny J.M. Moghal N. Lubkin M. Kim Y.B. Sharpe A.H. Stricker-Krongrad A. Shulman G.I. Neel B.G. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5479-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this is due to elevated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle but not in white adipose tissue. PTP1B–/– mice also showed a trend toward increased insulin-evoked suppression of hepatic glucose production (17Klaman L.D. Boss O. Peroni O.D. Kim J.K. Martino J.L. Zabolotny J.M. Moghal N. Lubkin M.

In addition to these effects on insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis, which are consistent with the earlier ex vivo studies, PTP1B–/– mice also display an unanticipated decrease in adiposity and resistance to high fat diet-induced obesity (16Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramanchandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P.

Subsequent studies showed that PTP1B could regulate leptin signaling ex vivo, most likely by dephosphorylating Jak2, and PTP1B–/– mice showed increased hypothalamic leptin sensitivity (18Zabolotny J.M.

However, other studies indicate that, also by dephosphorylating Jak2, PTP1B negatively regulates hepatic growth hormone signaling, potentially providing a peripheral (non-central nervous system) explanation for decreased adiposity and resistance to diet-induced obesity (20Gu F.

Furthermore, PTP1B antisense oligonucleotides, which lower PTP1B expression only in liver and fat, reportedly enhance insulin sensitivity in animal models of insulin resistance (21Gum R.J. Gaede L.L.

Thus, although there is general agreement that PTP1B is a major regulator of insulin sensitivity and body weight, the tissue(s) that mediate these effects have remained unclear. We utilized the high degree of hepatotropism of adenoviruses to assess the effects of restoring PTP1B expression only in the livers of PTP1B–/– mice. PTP1B–/– mice expressing human PTP1B (hPTP1B) in the liver (at activity levels ∼6-fold greater than in WT mice) exhibited dramatically decreased IR tyrosyl phosphorylation and IRS2-associated PI3K activity and reversal of their enhanced insulin sensitivity. We observed preferential site-specific dephosphorylation of the IR at Tyr-1162/1163 by PTP1B in vivo, consistent with earlier in vitro studies (15Salmeen A. Andersen J.N. Myers M.P. Tonks N.K. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1401-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Our findings confirm that PTP1B is an important negative regulator of glucose homeostasis and strongly suggest that the liver is a major site of PTP1B action in the periphery. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against IR and IRS1/2 were kindly provided by Drs. C. R. Kahn (Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA) and M. White (Children's Hospital Boston, MA), respectively. Rabbit polyclonal phosphospecific antibodies against Tyr-1162/1163 and Tyr-972 of the IR were purchased from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) and anti-human PTP1B (FG6) antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit polyclonal anti-SHP2 (C-18) and anti-human PTP1B antibodies (H-135) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—The tissues were lysed in a modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and 5 mm EDTA), containing 2 mm sodium orthovanadate and a protease inhibitor mixture (final concentrations were 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml of pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml of antipain). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). For immunoprecipitations, the lysates were incubated with the appropriate antibodies at 4 °C for 3 h to overnight. Immune complexes were collected onto protein A-Sepharose beads, washed extensively, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), which were blocked in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 with either 5% bovine serum albumin or 5% Carnation nonfat dry milk. After incubation with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies (used at the concentrations recommended by their suppliers), the blots were visualized using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification was carried out by using National Institutes of Health Image Pro Software version 1.62. Adenovirus Preparation and Animal Experiments—Adenoviruses encoding human PTP1B (AdPTP1B) and LacZ (AdLacZ) (8Venable C.L. Frevert E.U. Kim Y.B. Fischer B.M. Kamatkar S. Neel B.G. Kahn B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18318-18326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) were purified twice using the CsCl method and then titrated using cell viability assays, as described previously (25Mittal S.K. McDermott M.R. Johnson D.C. Prevec L. Graham F.L. Virus Res. 1993; 28: 67-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The viruses were suspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and injected through the tail veins of 9–12-week-old male mice at 3 × 108 plaque-forming units/g of body weight. PTP1B–/– and wild type (WT) mice were weaned onto a low fat (chow) diet (product 5010; Purina, St. Louis, MO) and maintained on this diet for ∼6 weeks. One week prior to virus injection, the mice were switched onto a high fat diet (product TD 93075; Harlan-Teklad, Madison, WI) and maintained on that diet until they were sacrificed. The low fat diet has 11.3% of calories from fat (physiological fuel value is 3.41 Kcal/g), whereas the high fat diet has 54% of calories from fat (physiological fuel value is 4.8 Kcal/g). Body weight and food intake were measured daily. For insulin tolerance tests (ITTs), the mice were fasted for 4 h and then injected with 0.65 milliunits/g (body weight) human insulin (Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals, Princeton, NJ). Blood glucose values were measured immediately before and at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min after insulin injection. To enable data comparison from different experiments, the values were expressed as percentages of change in blood glucose levels. For signaling experiments, the mice were fasted for 12–14 h and then injected intraperitoneally with 10 milliunits of insulin/g of body weight. The mice were sacrificed 10 min after injection, and insulin-responsive tissues were removed and snap frozen. Plasma insulin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay (Crystal Chem. Inc.; catalog number 90060). Plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were measured at the Department of Laboratory Medicine (Children's Hospital, Boston, MA). Because the AST assay requires 100 μlof serum, serial measurements were not possible. Thus, the AST levels were determined only at the end of the study. Adenoviral infection typically produces a mild hepatitis in mice. Accordingly, several injected animals had elevated AST levels. We excluded all infected mice (n = 6 mice for KO AdPTP1B and n = 1 mouse for WT AdLacZ) whose transaminases were more than three times elevated above the mean normal value (saline-injected WT mice). However, it should be noted that if all of the excluded mice were included, the results would not be changed, indicating that adenoviral infection of the liver itself did not alter glucose homeostasis. Generally high AST levels in KO AdPTP1B most likely reflect a role for PTP1B in mediating sensitivity to adenovirus-induced hepatitis. All of the experiments were approved by the Harvard Medical School Center for Animal Resources and Comparative Medicine and were conducted in accordance with the principles and procedures outlined in the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Enzyme Activity Assays—PTP1B activity assays were carried out using reduced, carboxamidomethylated, and maleyated lysozyme phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP, as described (26Tonks N.K. Diltz C.D. Fischer E.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The liver samples were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 0.6 m KCl, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and the protease inhibitor mixture. Phosphatase assays were initiated by the addition of 10 μl of radiolabeled carboxamidomethylated and maleyated lysozyme (10 μm) and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 750 μl of ice-cold acidic charcoal mixture (0.9 m NaCl, 90 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm NaH2PO4 and 4% (v/v) Norit A). After centrifugation for 1 min, the amount of radioactivity in 400 μl of supernatant was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. The data are represented as fold change compared with WT mice. For PI3K assays, the tissue lysates (1.5 mg protein) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibodies to IRS1 or IRS2, and immune complex PI3K activity was determined, as described previously (27Kim Y.B. Nikoulina S.E. Ciaraldi T.P. Henry R.R. Kahn B.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 733-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—Paraffin-embedded sections (5 μm) were dewaxed twice in Xylene and then rehydrated through a series of 100, 95, 80, and 70% ethanol washes for 5 min each. The sections were boiled for 25 min in 1 mm EDTA for antigen retrieval, blocked with 2% normal donkey serum and 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated in rabbit anti-human PTP1B antibodies (H-135) at 4 °C overnight. Following washing, the sections were incubated with biotin-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson Immuno Research, West Grove, PA) for 1 h. For detection of bound antibodies, the sections were incubated in ABC complex (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min, washed, and developed in 3,3′-diaminobenzidine for 5 min. The sections were then dehydrated, mounted, and dried overnight before observation. Statistical Analysis—The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. The statistical analyses were performed using the Statview program (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). ITTs were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance. Post hoc differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05 and highly significant at p ≤ 0.01 using a Fisher's protected least square difference. All of the other data were analyzed using analysis of variance. Re-expression of PTP1B in PTP1B–/– Mice by Adenovirus-mediated Gene Transfer—To assess the role of PTP1B in the liver, we selectively re-expressed hPTP1B in the livers of PTP1B–/– mice by injecting them intravenously with recombinant Ad5 category viruses (28Li Q.

Male mice (9–12 weeks old) on a low fat diet were switched to a high fat diet for 7 days, injected with the appropriate adenovirus, and then studied for an additional 7 days (Fig. 1A). hPTP1B protein expression in tissue lysates was assessed by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies against hPTP1B (FG6), which have low affinity for mouse PTP1B (31Zabolotny J.M. Haj F.G. Kim Y.B. Kim H.J. Shulman G.I. Kim J.K. Neel B.G. Kahn B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24844-24851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). As expected, and consistent with the hepatotropism of these viruses, hPTP1B protein expression was present in the liver and absent from all other insulin-responsive tissues (25Mittal S.K. McDermott M.R. Johnson D.C. Prevec L. Graham F.L. Virus Res. 1993; 28: 67-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 28Li Q. Kay M.A. Finegold M. Stratford-Perricaudet L.D. Woo S.L. Hum.

Med. 2000; 199: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Immunohistochemical analysis (using H-135 anti-hPTP1B antibodies) revealed hPTP1B expression in a large number of hepatocytes, wherein it displayed the intracellular, reticular staining pattern characteristic of PTP1B (Fig. 1C, left panel) (4Frangioni J.V.

Science. 2002; 295: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Thus, hPTP1B is expressed in the expected location in infected hepatocytes. A similar staining pattern was observed using hPTP1B monoclonal antibodies (FG6) (data not shown), whereas no immunoreactivity was detected in the livers of AdLacZ-injected PTP1B–/– mice (Fig. 1C, right panel). Because there are no antibodies available that recognize mouse and human PTP1B proteins equally, we could not easily compare the level of expressed hPTP1B to endogenous mouse PTP1B in WT mice by immunoblotting. Instead, we assessed PTP activity in liver lysates from WT AdLacZ, KO AdLacZ, and KO AdPTP1B mice. The overall PTP activity was ∼20% less in liver of KO AdLacZ mice compared with WT mice. If we assume that all of the “missing” PTP activity is PTP1B, these data indicate that PTP1B normally accounts for ∼20% of the total PTP activity in liver of WT mice. Upon re-expressing PTP1B in liver of the KO animals, the overall PTP activity was about 100% greater than that in WT mice. If all of this “extra” activity is due to (re-expressed) PTP1B, then the total PTP1B activity in the reconstituted mice is 120% of WT levels. In other words, the restored activity is 6-fold higher (120/20) than normal levels of activity. Effects of Liver PTP1B Re-expression on Body Weight—We were interested in the potential effects of liver PTP1B on both glucose homeostasis and body mass. It is optimal to determine the effects of genetic manipulations on glucose homeostasis after puberty. Because PTP1B–/– mice have lower weight than WT littermates as early as 2 weeks post-weaning onto a high fat diet, by puberty such mice would weigh considerably less than WT controls. Such a weight difference would confound assessment of the effects of liver PTP1B on glucose homeostasis. Adenovirus-mediated gene expression in the liver is sustained for a relatively short time; thus, a long term study of the effect of hepatic PTP1B re-expression on weight gain is not feasible. Therefore to facilitate detection of possible differences in body weight caused by hepatic PTP1B expression, mice were placed on low fat diet after weaning, then switched to a high fat diet 1 week before virus administration, and maintained on that diet for the rest of the study (Fig. 1A). The mice were housed individually, and food intake and body weights were measured daily. Prior to viral injection (during the first 7 days post-switch to high fat diet), no significant differences in body weights of the mice were detected. Within a few days after viral injection, a significant difference was detected between KO AdLacZ and WT mice, but for most part there was no significant weight difference between mice in any of the virally injected groups (Fig. 2A). As expected, there also was no significant difference in food intake between WT and PTP1B–/– mice prior to infection (17Klaman L.D. Boss O. Peroni O.D. Kim J.K. Martino J.L. Zabolotny J.M. Moghal N. Lubkin M. Kim Y.B. Sharpe A.H. Stricker-Krongrad A. Shulman G.I. Neel B.G. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5479-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar, 18Zabolotny J.M.

Cell. 2002; 2: 489-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Viral infection had a mild but significant anorexogenic effect on both WT and PTP1B–/– mice. Interestingly, the duration of this suppressed food intake appeared to be longer in KO AdLacZ mice than in KO mice re-expressing PTP1B. However, all of these differences were small and had little effect on body mass and thus are unlikely alone to account for altered glucose homeostasis. Re-expression of PTP1B in Liver of PTPB–/– Mice Attenuates Insulin Sensitivity—PTP1B–/– mice have increased insulin sensitivity (16Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramanchandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P.

Stricker-Krongrad A. Shulman G.I. Neel B.G. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5479-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Hyper-insulinemic euglycemic clamp studies revealed a marked enhancement of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into skeletal muscle but also a trend toward greater suppression of hepatic glucose output in PTP1B–/– mice (17Klaman L.D. Boss O. Peroni O.D. Kim J.K. Martino J.L. Zabolotny J.M. Moghal N. Lubkin M. Kim Y.B. Sharpe A.H. Stricker-Krongrad A. Shulman G.I. Neel B.G. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5479-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed glucose homeostasis in PTP1B–/– mice after re-expression of hPTP1B in the liver. Consistent with previous studies, before viral injection, fed glucose levels were lower in PTP1B–/– (KO), compared with WT groups (Table I). There was no significant difference in fed or fasting glucose or fed insulin levels between PTP1B–/– mice and their counterparts re-expressing PTP1B (Table I). Serum AST levels were used as indications of liver function. PTP1B–/– mice infected with the PTP1B virus generally had higher AST levels than mice infected with the LacZ control virus. Moreover, PTP1B–/– mice infected with adenovirus LacZ had significantly lower AST elevations than WT mice injected with the same virus. When PTP1B expression is restored (adenovirus PTP1B into PTP1B–/– mice), AST levels were increased (compared with PTP1B–/– mice infected with adenovirus LacZ). The higher level of AST in PTP1B–/– mice infected with adenovirus PTP1B than in WT mice infected with adenovirus LacZ is likely explained by the 6 times higher level of PTP1B expression (compared with WT) in reconstituted mice. The data suggest that liver PTP1B levels may affect sensitivity to adenoviral induced hepatitis (see “Discussion”).Table IBlood glucose, serum insulin, and AST levels in WT and PTP1B–/– mice infected with AdLacZ or AdPTP1B adenovirusParameterWTWT AdLacZKO AdLacZKO AdPTP1BBlood glucose (mg/dl)Fed before viral injection132 ± 3.8126 ± 4.65107 ± 7.06aSignificant difference between KO AdLacZ and WT AdLacZ (p ≤ 0.01).105 ± 4.61bSignificant difference between WT AdLacZ and KO AdPTP1B (p ≤ 0.05).Fed after viral injection135 ± 6.53136 ± 5.70122 ± 7.57128 ± 15.73Fasted after viral injection113 ± 7.296 ± 6.0583 ± 4.0680 ± 3.19Serum insulin (ng/ml)Fed before viral injection1.19 ± 0.141.60 ± 0.351.43 ± 0.340.71 ± 0.12bSignificant difference between WT AdLacZ and KO AdPTP1B (p ≤ 0.05).Fed after viral injection1.55 ± 0.441.87 ± 0.460.92 ± 0.211.26 ± 0.33AST (units/liter)264 ± 44303 ± 25216 ± 23cSignificant difference between KO AdPTP1B and KO AdLacZ (p ≤ 0.01).618 ± 72dSignificant difference between WT AdLacZ and KO AdPTP1B (p ≤ 0.01).a Significant difference between KO AdLacZ and WT AdLacZ (p ≤ 0.01).b Significant difference between WT AdLacZ and KO AdPTP1B (p ≤ 0.05).c Significant difference between KO AdPTP1B and KO AdLacZ (p ≤ 0.01).d Significant difference between WT AdLacZ and KO AdPTP1B (p ≤ 0.01).

Fig. 3A shows the percentage of change in blood glucose values following insulin injection from two independent experiments containing mice from all of the indicated groups. These data were collected after viral infection. Notably, KO AdPTP1B mice exhibited a significantly smaller decrease in blood glucose levels during ITT, compared with KO AdLacZ mice, indicating that insulin sensitivity is attenuated in PTP1B–/– mice re-expressing hPTP1B in the liver. Remarkably, the insulin sensitivity of KO AdPTP1B mice was similar to that of WT AdLacZ mice (Fig. 3A). The difference in the insulin response between KO AdLacZ and WT AdLacZ (and WT saline) was similar to the differences seen earlier in uninfected WT and PTP1B–/– mice (16Elchebly M. Payette P.

https://openalex.org/W2076505168,"Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome (SDS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by bone marrow failure with significant predisposition to the development of poor prognosis myelodysplasia and leukemia, exocrine pancreatic failure and metaphyseal chondrodysplasia. Although the SBDS gene mutated in this disorder is highly conserved in Archaea and all eukaryotes, the function is unknown. To interpret the molecular consequences of SDS-associated mutations, we have solved the crystal structure of the Archaeoglobus fulgidus SBDS protein orthologue at a resolution of 1.9 Å, revealing a three domain architecture. The N-terminal (FYSH) domain is the most frequent target for disease mutations and contains a novel mixed α/β-fold identical to the single domain yeast protein Yhr087wp that is implicated in RNA metabolism. The central domain consists of a three-helical bundle, whereas the C-terminal domain has a ferredoxin-like fold. By genetic complementation analysis of the essential Saccharomyces cerevisiae SBDS orthologue YLR022C, we demonstrate an essential role in vivo for the FYSH domain and the central three-helical bundle. We further show that the common SDS-related K62X truncation is non-functional. Most SDS-related missense mutations that alter surface epitopes do not impair YLR022C function, but mutations affecting residues buried in the hydrophobic core of the FYSH domain severely impair or abrogate complementation. These data are consistent with absence of homozygosity for the common K62X truncation mutation in individuals with SDS, indicating that the SDS disease phenotype is a consequence of expression of hypomorphic SBDS alleles and that complete loss of SBDS function is likely to be lethal.

The cumulative risk of MDS/acute leukemia among SDS patients was recently reported as 18.8 and 36.1% at 20 and 30 years, respectively (5Donadieu J. Leblanc T. Bader Meunier B. Barkaoui M.

SDS therefore represents an important model for understanding the genetic determinants underlying the multistep progression to leukemia. SDS-associated mutations were recently described in a gene designated SBDS (Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome) (6Boocock G.R. Morrison J.A. Popovic M. Richards N. Ellis L. Durie P.R. Rommens J.M. Nat.

Indirect evidence supports the hypothesis that the SBDS protein family may function in RNA metabolism. Thus, the archaeal SBDS orthologues are located in highly conserved operons containing RNA-processing genes that include orthologues of the eukaryotic exosome and RNase P complex subunits (8Koonin E.V. Wolf Y.I. Aravind L. Genome.

Cell. 2003; 12: 1353-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In SDS, recurring mutations in the SBDS gene arise from gene conversion caused by recombination between SBDS and a pseudogene copy that lies in a 305-kb paralogous duplicon located 5.8 Mb distally (6Boocock G.R. Morrison J.A. Popovic M. Richards N. Ellis L. Durie P.R. Rommens J.M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Converted gene segments consistently include at least one of two pseudogene-like sequence changes that are predicted to result in SBDS protein truncation. Specifically, the SBDS dinucleotide mutation 183-184TA → CT introduces an in-frame stop codon (K62X) whereas the 258 + 2T → C mutation is predicted to result in premature truncation of the SBDS protein by frameshift (C84fs3) (6Boocock G.R. Morrison J.A. Popovic M. Richards N. Ellis L. Durie P.R. Rommens J.M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). At least 90% of affected individuals carry one common conversion mutation, whereas 50% are compound heterozygotes with respect to the K62X and C84Cfs mutations. Strikingly, no homozygotes for the K62X mutation were identified, suggesting that this may be a lethal mutation. Alleles from affected individuals who do not have the common conversion mutations carry additional frameshift and missense mutations in the SBDS coding region (6Boocock G.R. Morrison J.A. Popovic M. Richards N. Ellis L. Durie P.R. Rommens J.M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Two further reported series have confirmed these initial findings and identified novel missense mutations in the SBDS gene (14Nakashima E. Mabuchi A. Makita Y. Masuno M. Ohashi H. Nishimura G. Ikegawa S. Hum. Genet. 2004; 114: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15Woloszynek J.R. Rothbaum R.J. Rawls A.S. Minx P.J. Wilson R.K. Mason P.J. Bessler M. Link D.C. Blood. 2004; 104: 3588-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To interpret the molecular consequences of SDS-related mutations and to begin to address the conserved function of the SBDS protein, we have determined the structure of the A. fulgidus SBDS orthologue AF0491 (herein called AfSBDS). The AfSBDS structure represents a paradigm for the SBDS protein family in view of the striking evolutionary amino acid sequence conservation. The AfSBDS structure has a three domain architecture: an N-terminal domain with a mixed α/β-fold, a central three-helical bundle and a C-terminal ferredoxin-like domain. We show that the N-terminal domain is the most frequent target for disease mutations and is structurally related to the single domain yeast protein Yhr087wp. By genetic complementation analysis in yeast, we demonstrate that the most common SDS-related predicted protein truncations are null mutations. These data are consistent with the absence of homozygosity for the common early (K62X) truncation mutation in a large cohort of families affected with SDS (6Boocock G.R. Morrison J.A. Popovic M. Richards N. Ellis L. Durie P.R. Rommens J.M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), indicating that the SDS disease phenotype is a consequence of expression of hypomorphic SBDS alleles and that complete abrogation of SBDS function is probably lethal. Protein Expression and Purification—Residues 1-234 of the A. fulgidus SBDS orthologue AF0491 (AfSBDS) were expressed with an N-terminal His6 tag in either Escherichia coli C41 (DE3) or the methionine auxotroph B834 (DE3) for selenomethionine (SeMet) incorporation as described (16Warren A.J. Bravo J. Williams R.L. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3004-3015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin (Qiagen) and Resource S ion-exchange (Amersham Biosciences), concentrated to 10 mg/ml in buffer A (20 mm citrate, pH 5.3, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA) and stored at 21 °C. His6-tagged human SBDS, residues 1-250 and yeast His6-Ylr022cp, residues 1-250 were expressed and purified as above and dialyzed into 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA. Crystallization—Crystals of SeMet-substituted His6-AfSBDS protein were grown as hanging drops against 1 ml of reservoir solution (19-20% w/v polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 mm CHES buffer pH 9.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol) at 21 °C, using 1 μl of 10 mg/ml protein solution and 1 μl of crystallization solution. Crystals grew to typical dimensions of 300 × 100 × 50 μm over 3 days, and were cryocooled in liquid nitrogen following transfer to a cryobuffer comprising reservoir solution supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol. Data Collection, Phasing, and Model Refinement—Data were collected at 100 K at the ESRF beamline ID-29 in Grenoble using an ADSC Q210 CCD detector. The SeMet-substituted AfSBDS protein crystallized in space group P1 with cell parameters a = 33.668 Å, b = 44.448 Å, c = 54.720Å, α = 75.87°, β = 85.61°, γ = 69.49° and a solvent content of 55.6%. Data sets were collected at three different wavelengths, λ1 = 0.979200 Å, λ2 = 0.979289 Å, and λ3 = 0.891971 Å, corresponding to peak, inflection, and remote points in the fluorescence spectrum of the SeMet-substituted crystal respectively. 360° of data were collected at each wavelength in 1° oscillations from a single crystal. Data were processed using MOSFLM (17Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACMB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 26. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992Google Scholar) and scaled using SCALA (18CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). SHARP (19de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) was used to locate five of the six possible selenium atoms in the asymmetric unit to generate phases. The phases were calculated by SHARP and improved by density modification, histogram matching, and solvent flattening using DM (20Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 31. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1994: 34-38Google Scholar). The phases from DM were used as the starting point for automated chain tracing and model building using ARP/wARP (21Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar). Manual model building was performed using the program O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar), and the structure refined using Refmac5 (23Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). All methionine residues were modeled and refined as SeMet. Maximum likelihood residuals restrained using Hendrickson-Lattmann coefficients from the SHARP output were used throughout refinement against the peak wavelength data. Table I lists the statistics for data collection and phase refinement. The structure has been refined to a free R factor (Rfree) of 24.9% and shows good stereochemistry with no residues in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. No density was seen for the N-terminal four amino acid residues of AfSBDS or the His6 tag.Table IData collection, structure determination, and refinement statisticsData SetPeakaData sets were collected at ESRF beamline ID29 at λ = 0.97920, 0.89197, and 0.979289 Å for the peak, remote, and inflection data sets, respectivelyRemoteaData sets were collected at ESRF beamline ID29 at λ = 0.97920, 0.89197, and 0.979289 Å for the peak, remote, and inflection data sets, respectivelyInflectionaData sets were collected at ESRF beamline ID29 at λ = 0.97920, 0.89197, and 0.979289 Å for the peak, remote, and inflection data sets, respectivelyResolution range (Å)52.7–1.952.7–1.952.7–1.9Completeness (%)95.1 (81.7)bValues in parentheses indicate the specific values in the highest resolution shell97.5 (96.7)95.0 (81.7)RmergecRmerge = ΣhklΣi|Ii(hkl) – 〈I(hkl)〉|/ΣhklΣiIi (hkl)0.0800.0790.051Redundancy5.74.83.8Observations/unique reflections123,206/21,580105,886/22,12982,224/21,561〈I/σ〉15.2 (2.2)12.5 (1.7)12.1 (1.4)Phasing statisticsPhasing powerdIsomorphous phasing power = Σ|FH|/Σ||FPHobs| – |FPHcalc||; anomalous phasing power = Σ|FH|/Σ||ADobs| – |ADcalc||acen/iso0.890.801Phasing powerdIsomorphous phasing power = Σ|FH|/Σ||FPHobs| – |FPHcalc||; anomalous phasing power = Σ|FH|/Σ||ADobs| – |ADcalc||acen/anom2.2591.3011.204Figure of meriteFigure of Merit is weighted mean of the cosine of the deviation from αbestaeenBefore density modification0.35After density modification0.86Refinement statisticsResolution range (Å)52.7–1.9Protein atoms1,838Waters66RcrystfRcryst and Rfree – Σ|Fobs – Fcalc|/ΣFobs21.1RfreefRcryst and Rfree – Σ|Fobs – Fcalc|/ΣFobs (data used)24.9 (5%)r.m.s. deviation from idealitygr.m.s. deviations for bond angles and lengths in regard to Engh and Huber parametersBonds (Å)0.024Angles (°)1.76Dihedrals (°)0.105a Data sets were collected at ESRF beamline ID29 at λ = 0.97920, 0.89197, and 0.979289 Å for the peak, remote, and inflection data sets, respectivelyb Values in parentheses indicate the specific values in the highest resolution shellc Rmerge = ΣhklΣi|Ii(hkl) – 〈I(hkl)〉|/ΣhklΣiIi (hkl)d Isomorphous phasing power = Σ|FH|/Σ||FPHobs| – |FPHcalc||; anomalous phasing power = Σ|FH|/Σ||ADobs| – |ADcalc||e Figure of Merit is weighted mean of the cosine of the deviation from αbestf Rcryst and Rfree – Σ|Fobs – Fcalc|/ΣFobsg r.m.s. deviations for bond angles and lengths in regard to Engh and Huber parameters Open table in a new tab Yeast Plasmids, Strains, and Media—The sequence encoding yeast Ylr022cp-His6 was cloned into pYC2/CT (CEN6/ARSH4/URA3) (Invitrogen) to generate pYC2[Gal10::YLR022CHis6]. The YLR022C open reading frame (ORF) was PCR-amplified with 500 bp of 5′ and 400 bp of 3′ genomic sequence and cloned into plasmids pRS314 (ARS/CEN/TRP) to generate pRS314[YLR022C]. NdeI and EcoR1 restriction sites were introduced at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, of the YLR022C ORF to generate pRS314[YLR022CNE]. Mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The human SBDS, Dictyostelium discoideum SBDS and AfSBDS ORFs were PCR-cloned as NdeI-EcoR1 fragments into pRS314[YLR022CNE] to generate pRS314[YLR022CNE_HSBDS], pRS314[YLR022CNE_DSBDS], and pRS314[YLR022CNE_AfSBDS]. The diploid yeast strain 20519D (W303; Mat a/α; ura3-1/ura3-1; his3-11/his3-11; leu2-3_112/leu2-3_112; trp1▵2/trp1▵2; ade2-1/ade2-1; can1-100/can1-100; & YLR022C (1, 753)::kanMX4/YLR022C) was purchased from Euroscarf. Genomic deletion of YLR022C in the 20519D strain was confirmed by sequencing. 20519D was transformed with plasmid pYC2[Gal10::YLR022CHis6], sporulated and tetrads dissected to give haploid strain H1 (YLR022C::kanMX4/pYC2[Gal10::YLR022CHis6]). Yeast cells were grown in YPD rich medium (1% w/v yeast extract, 2% w/v Bacto Peptone, and 2% w/v glucose). In some experiments, glucose was replaced with 2% galactose (YPG). For tetrad dissections, a Singer MSM micromanipulator was used. Yeast cells were transformed by the lithium acetate method (24Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). Western Blotting and Antibodies—Purified full-length His6-Ylr022cp protein was used to immunize rabbits. Polyclonal antisera were affinity-purified according to manufacturer's instructions (AminoLink Plus Immobilization kit, Pierce). Affinity-purified polyclonal antibody (1: 2000) was incubated overnight and visualized with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Tubulin was visualized using a mouse anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and an HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antiserum (Amersham Biosciences). Flow Cytometry—Cells were stained with propidium iodide as described (25Haase S.B. Lew D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 322-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Flow cytometry was performed with the FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences), and data analyzed using Cell Quest software. Guanidinium Unfolding Assays—Two protein stock solutions of 1 μm concentration were made in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 0.5 mm DTE with either 0 or 7.5 m guanidinium hydrochloride (MP Biochemicals Inc.). Circular dichroism measurements were recorded at 222 nm using an AVIV CD spectrophotometer in a quartz cuvette (1-cm path length), final volume 1.8 ml, at 25 °C. A minimum of ten traces were averaged per data point and fit to a two-state model to determine the denaturant concentration at which the protein is 50% unfolded (midpoint transition, [D]50%) using Kaleida-Graph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) (26Jackson S.E. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10428-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Overall Structure of the A. fulgidus SBDS Orthologue—We have determined the structure of the A. fulgidus SBDS orthologue AF0491 (NP_069327). The protein was expressed and purified from E. coli and crystallized in space group P1. The 1.9-Å structure was determined by x-ray diffraction using multiple anomalous dispersion data collected from a single crystal generated from SeMet-substituted AfSBDS protein. The crystallographic data are summarized in Table I. The current model includes residues 5-234 of AfSBDS and has been refined to a crystallographic R factor of 21.1% (Rfree = 24.9%) using data between 52.7 and 1.9 Å. AfSBDS has a three domain architecture (Fig. 1A): the N-terminal domain (I, residues 5-87), central domain (II, residues 88-161), and the C-terminal domain (III, residues 162-234) are arranged in a V-shape of overall dimensions ∼54 × 59 × 73 Å. A central cavity, ∼10 Å deep and 24 Å long, is formed at the interface between the three domains. FYSH Domain—Domain I (Asp5-Ile87) (Fig. 1, A and B) has a mixed αβ topology, comprising four β-strands and four α-helices arranged as a three stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (β1-β2-β3-β4) broken by the insertion of a hydrogen-bonded water molecule between strands β3 and β4. Helices α3 and α4 are packed against the concave surface of the β-sheet perpendicular to the long axis of the β-strands, whereas helices α1 and α2 together with the intervening loop line the face of the cleft between domains I and III. We noted close structural homology between the N-terminal domain of AfSBDS and a single domain protein from S. cerevisiae denoted Yhr087wp (AAB68927.1) whose structure was solved using NMR spectroscopy by the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium (PDB code, 1NYN) (27Savchenko A. Krogan N.J. Cort J.R. Evdokimova E. Lew J.M. Yee A.A. Sánchez-Pulido L. Andrade M.A. Bochkarev A. Watson J.D. Kennedy M.A. Greenblatt J. Hughes T. Arrowsmith C.H. Rommens J.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19213-19220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The YHR087W ORF lies within the NAM8-GAR1 intergenic region of S. cerevisiae and encodes a 111 amino acid protein belonging to a small family whose distribution is restricted to fungi. Least squares alignment of Yhr087wp and domain I of AfSBDS using Superpose (18CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar) gives an r.m.s. deviation of 1.47 Å for 59 common Cα atoms, despite a sequence identity of only 15.3%. The most significant difference between the two structures is a six-residue loop insertion between strands β3 and β4 of Yhr087wp relative to the AfSBDS structure (Fig. 2). In view of the structural homology between domain I of AfSBDS and Yhr087wp, and the restricted distribution of Yhr087wp homologues to fungi, we have denoted domain I of AfSBDS the FYSH (Fungal, Yhr087wp, Shwachman) domain. Yhr087wp is non-essential (28Giaever G. Chu A.M. Ni L. Connelly C. Riles L. Veronneau S. Dow S. Lucau-Danila A. Anderson K. Andre B. Arkin A.P. Astromoff A. El-Bakkoury M. Bangham R. Benito R.

Sky1p phosphorylates the shuttling mRNA export carrier protein Npl3 to promote efficient release of mRNA (33Yun C.Y. Fu X.D. J.

Physical interaction with Sky1p therefore supports a potential role for Yhr087wp in RNA metabolism. Central Domain—The central domain II (Thr88-Phe161) consists of a compact three-helical bundle (α5-α7). Helices α5 and α6 are connected by a conserved proline-rich loop (α5-α6 loop) (Figs. 1A and 3). The protein that is most closely related structurally to domain II is the C-terminal domain of E. coli RuvA that functions in Holliday junction recognition (35Rafferty J.B. Sedelnikova S.E. Hargreaves D. Artymiuk P.J. Baker P.J. Sharples G.J. Mahdi A.A. Lloyd R.G. Rice D.W. Science. 1996; 274: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Superposition of AfSBDS domain II with the RuvA C-terminal domain gives an r.m.s. deviation of 2.2 Å for 45 common Cα atoms. C-terminal Domain—The C-terminal domain III (Glu162-Gly234) is composed of a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (β6-β7-β5-β8) with two α-helices (α8, α9) packing against the concave surface of the sheet (Fig. 1A). The βαββαβ folding topology is typical of a ferredoxin-like fold as defined in the SCOP data base (36Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5595) Google Scholar). Of the large number of protein domains with a ferredoxin-like fold, the closest structural homologue to domain III of AfSBDS is domain V of S. cerevisiae elongation factor 2 (Eft2p/Ydr385wp) (PDB code, 1N0U, 1N0V) (37Jorgensen R. Ortiz P.A. Carr-Schmid A. Nissen P. Kinzy T.G. Andersen G.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The r.m.s. deviation is 2.36 Å over 63 Cα atoms despite no obvious homology between the protein sequences. Eft2p and its bacterial counterpart EF-G are members of the GTPase superfamily of proteins (38Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). Domain III of AfSBDS is also closely related structurally to a conserved E. coli protein of unknown function, YigZ (PDB code 1VI7) (39Park F. Gajiwala K. Eroshkina G. Furlong E. He D. Batiyenko Y.

The crystal structure of the SBDS homologue in Archaeoglobus fulgidus, AF0491, revealed a three domain protein. The N-terminal domain, which harbors the majority of disease-linked mutations, has a novel three-dimensional fold. The central domain has the common winged helix-turn-helix motif, and the C-terminal domain shares structural homology with known RNA-binding domains. Proteomic analysis of the SBDS sequence homologue in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, YLR022C, revealed an association with over 20 proteins involved in ribosome biosynthesis. NMR structural genomics revealed another yeast protein, YHR087W, to be a structural homologue of the AF0491 N-terminal domain. Sequence analysis confirmed them as distant sequence homologues, therefore related by divergent evolution. Synthetic genetic array analysis of YHR087W revealed genetic interactions with proteins involved in RNA and rRNA processing including Mdm20/Nat3, Nsr1, and Npl3.

Morrison J.A. Popovic M. Richards N. Ellis L. Durie P.R. Rommens J.M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The mRNA for SBDS is ubiquitously expressed, and its mutation has many consequences, including abnormalities of pancreatic exocrine function, skeletal defects, and hematological dysfunction (1Boocock G.R.

The predominant genetic event that underlies SBD syndrome appears to be a gene conversion event between the SBDS locus and a pseudogene that is 97% similar in sequence to SBDS, but is predicted to encode a non-functional protein (1Boocock G.R.

Sequence analysis of disease-associated alleles has identified more than 20 different mutations in affected individuals (1Boocock G.R. Morrison J.A. Popovic M. Richards N. Ellis L. Durie P.R.

Two mutations, both predicted to lead to truncated gene products, account for over 95% of these mutant alleles. The first, and most common mutation, 258 + 2T → C (84Cfs3), can be found in both homozygous and heterozygous affected individuals and is predicted to cause partial loss-of-function. The second mutation, 183-184TA → CT (K62X), is inevitably found together with other mutations and is never homozygous, suggesting that homozygosity for this allele is lethal. The remaining 5% of alleles are point mutations that map mostly to the 5′-end of the coding sequence. Although the molecular function of SBDS is unknown, the predicted SBDS protein is evolutionarily conserved and has apparent homologues in Archaea, plants, yeast, and other lower eukaryotes, suggesting that it may have a fundamental, conserved biochemical role. Several lines of circumstantial evidence suggest SBDS has a role in RNA metabolism. First, in Archaea, the gene is located in an operon that encodes, among other proteins, RNA-processing enzymes (7Koonin E.V. Wolf Y.I. Aravind L. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 240-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Second, in yeast, the gene for the SBDS homologue (YLR022C) clustered with RNA-processing enzymes in transcription profiling experiments (8Wu L.F. Hughes T.R. Davierwala A.P. Robinson M.D. Stoughton R. Altschuler S.J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Third, although the coding sequence is divided into three blocks of sequence conservation in most organisms, including humans, several plant SBDS homologues contain a fourth C-terminal region that is predicted to be an RNA binding domain (1Boocock G.R. Morrison J.A. Popovic M. Richards N. Ellis L. Durie P.R. Rommens J.M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). In an effort to determine the molecular and cellular functions of SBDS, we initiated a series of studies in model organisms. As a part of our structural genomics project, we used x-ray crystallography to determine a high resolution structure of the Archaeal SBDS homologue, AF0491 in Archaeoglobus fulgidus, and NMR to discover an unanticipated structural homologue of the N-terminal domain of SBDS in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (YHR087W). The biochemical and genetic links to RNA metabolism for both the S. cerevisiae SBDS sequence homologue, YLR022C, and the more distantly related homologue, YHR087W, suggest a common functional role for this new structural family. Cloning, Purification, and Crystallization of AF0491—The AF0491 gene was subcloned, expressed, and its product purified and screened for crystallization as described previously (9Zhang R.G. Kim Y.

Crystals for x-ray diffraction data collection were obtained from hanging drop vapor diffusion conditions containing 2 μl of Se-Met derivative of the protein plus 2 μl of 0.2 m sodium acetate, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate at pH 6.4, and 20% polyethylene glycol 3350 over 2-5 days at 21 °C. The crystals were flash-frozen with crystallization buffer completed with 17% glycerol.

The crystals contained one independent molecule per unit cell. A 2.0-Å three-wavelength MAD diffraction experiment from selenomethionine-containing crystal was collected and then processed with the HKL2000 package (10Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38600) Google Scholar). Five selenium sites (of a total of six) were found by direct methods using the SnB program (11Weeks C.M. Miller R.

This construct yields the protein with an N-terminal His6 tag and thrombin cut site. The protein expression and purification method are described by Yee et al. (17Yee A. Chang X. Pineda-Lucena A.

The His6 tag was not cleaved, leaving an extra 20 residues at the N terminus (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSH). NMR samples of ∼1.5 mm uniformly 15N/13C-labeled protein were prepared in 10 mm NaOAc, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm Zn2+, 1 mm benzamidine, 1× inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 0.01% (w/v) NaN3 in 10% (v/v) 2H2O/H2O at pH 5.0. This buffer was not optimized to determine the importance of any components. Samples were placed in 5-mm Shigemi susceptibility matched NMR tubes. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR data were collected at 25 °C using standard triple resonance pulse sequences (18Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy, Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 411-528Google Scholar). Backbone and side chain correlation experiments (HNCACB, CBCACONNH, HNCO, CBCACOCAHA, CCC-TOCSY-NNH, HCC-TOCSY-NNH, and HCCH-TOCSY) were acquired on a Varian Unity 600 spectrometer. 1H-13C HSQC, three-dimensional 15N NOESY (150-ms mixing time), four-dimensional 13C-13C HMQC-NOESY-HMQC (125-ms mixing time), HNHA, and aromatic ring side chain correlation experiments (HBCBCG-CDHD/CEHE-aro) were acquired on a Varian Inova 600 spectrometer. 1H-13C HSQC and three-dimensional 13C NOESY (120 ms mixing time) experiments were acquired on a Varian Inova 750 spectrometer. Amide proton exchange was monitored by acquiring 1H-15N HSQC spectra following dissolution of a lyophilized protein sample in D2O. Stereospecific Leu and Val side chain assignments were obtained from a 1H-13C HSQC experiment recorded on a sample that had been produced in minimal growth medium containing 10% [U-13C]glucose and 90% unenriched glucose (19Neri D. Szyperski T. Otting G. Senn H. Wuthrich K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The raw data and pulse sequences used have been deposited in the BioMagResBank (Madison, WI). Data were processed with Felix (MSI) and analyzed with Felix and Sparky (www.cgl.ucsf.edu/home/sparky). Calculation and Analysis of YHR087W Structural Ensemble—NOE distance restraints had uniform lower bounds of 1.8 Å and upper bounds of 2.8, 3.2, 4.0, or 5.0 Å. Hydrogen bond restraints were derived from amide proton D2O exchange data. Amide 1H-15N HSQC crosspeaks still present 30 min after dissolution of a lyophilized sample in D2O were given bounds of 1.8-2.5 Å for the HN-O distance and 2.8-3.5 Å for the N-O distance, provided preliminary structural ensembles clearly indicated the correct acceptor atom. Dihedral restraints for phi were derived from the HNHA experiment (20Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) and had bounds of -55 ± 30 degrees for helical residues with J < 5Hzand -120 ± 50 degrees for extended residues with J > 7.5 Hz. Dihedral restraints for psi had values of -47 ± 30 for helical residues and 140 ± 50 for extended residues. Psi restraints were added only for residues in helices and β-sheets and only after consideration of amide-α NOE ratios (HNi-Hαiversus HNi-Hαi-1), α-carbon chemical shifts, and the evident secondary structure propensities in preliminary ensembles of structures. Structures were calculated with NIH-Xplor (21Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Marius Clore G. J. Magn.

The routines dg_sub_embed, dg_ full_embed, and dgsa were used as provided except that in dgsa, an initial temperature of 2,000 K was used with 30,000 high temperature steps and 200,000 cooling steps. Sum averaging was used for methyl groups and methylene proton pairs. The structural ensemble was analyzed with PROCHECK-NMR (22Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4469) Google Scholar). Surface electrostatic features of the protein were examined using GRASP (23Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B.

Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (4102) Google Scholar). To improve the profile quality we followed two approaches: first, BLAST searches against unfinished genomes (28Cummings L. Riley L. Black L. Souvorov A. Resenchuk S. Dondoshansky I. Tatusova T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 216: 133-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and secondly, additional searches against EST databases (29Boguski M.S. Lowe T.M. Tolstoshev C.M. Nat.

Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 656-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This sequence enrichment improved the quality of the profile that was used to perform the searches against the non-redundant protein databases. The alignment in Fig. 3 was produced with HMMer (27Eddy S.R. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (4102) Google Scholar) and Belvu (www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/help/belvu_setup.shtml), and the phylogenetic tree was produced using ClustalW (31Higgins D.G.

The purified proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on gels containing 10% polyacrylamide, and the proteins were visualized by silver staining. Protein bands were digested with trypsin and peptide samples were spotted onto a target plate with a matrix of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Fluka). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis was conducted utilizing a Reflex IV instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) in positive ion reflectron mode. Tandem mass spectrometry on a Finnigan LCQ-Deca instrument was carried out as previously described (33Krogan N.J. Kim M. Ahn S.H. Zhong G. Kobor M.S. Cagney G. Emili A. Shilatifard A. Buratowski S.

Synthetic Genetic Array Analysis (SGA)—SGA analysis was carried out as previously described (34Tong A.H. Evangelista M. Parsons A.B. Xu H. Bader G.D. Page N. Robinson M. Raghibizadeh S. Hogue C.W.

Crystal Structure of AF0491, the Archaeal Homologue of SBDS—The SBDS protein is conserved in Archaea and Eukarya. A 2.0-Å structure of AF0491, the SBDS homologue from A. fulgidus, was solved from a single selenomethionine-containing crystal. The structure was refined to an Rfactor/Rfree of 21.9/27.0%. The data collection and refinement details are provided under “Experimental Procedures” and in Table I. AF0491 comprises three domains (Fig. 1). The AF0491 N-terminal domain (residues 1-86) is an αβ domain that adopts a novel fold. It consists of a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet in which strands β2 and β3, as well as β4 and β5, are connected by pairs of helices. The secondary structural elements are thus arranged as follows: β1-β2-α1-α2-β3-loop-β4-α3-α4-β5 (Fig. 2B). On strand β3 on the exposed side of the β-sheet, there is an irregular two residue β-bulge, in which the hydrogen bonding pattern of the antiparallel strands is disrupted, and the normal backbone geometry is distorted to accommodate the two additional residues. There is a loop at one end of the β-sheet that bends in the direction of the bulge, forming a cupped incursion in the surface. It appears that this fold is new, as no similar structures were identified with Dali or VAST. Structure-based sequence alignments showed that this domain corresponds to residues 10-95 in human SBDS.Fig. 2Structural comparison of YHR087W and AF0491.

B, secondary structure of the AF0491 N-terminal domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The middle domain of AF0491 (residues 87-160) is a winged helix-turn-helix, a common fold associated with DNA binding (35Luscombe N.M. Austin S.E. Berman H.M. Thornton J.M. Genome Biol. 2000; 1: 1-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the context of the human SBDS, this domain corresponds to residues 98-169. The C-terminal domain of AF0491 (residues 161-234), which corresponds to residues 170-241 in the human protein, comprises a four-stranded β-sheet that is buttressed on one side by two helices. This is also a common fold, sharing structural homology with the RNA recognition motif (RRM). More than 20 different mutations have been identified in SBD syndrome patients (1Boocock G.R.

Most of the mutations that alter surface residues are located in the N-terminal half of the protein, where many of the conserved residues are also located. An analysis of disease-linked mutations can be found in the report by Shammas et al. (6Shammas C. Menne T.F. Hilcenko C. Michell S.R. Goyenechea B. Boocock G.R.B. Durie P.R. Rommens J.M. Warren A.J.

YHR087W and the AF0491 N-terminal Domain—As part of an ongoing structural genomics project in yeast, we used NMR spectroscopy to determine the structure of YHR087W from S. cerevisiae (Fig. 2A). This protein did not have a previously known structure or function; however, the YHR087W orthologue in S. pombe is expressed during sporulation and environmental stress (36Chen D. Toone W.M. Mata J. Lyne R. Burns G. Kivinen K. Brazma A. Jones N. Bahler J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 214-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 37Mata J. Lyne R. Burns G. Bahler J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The structure of YHR087W displayed striking similarity to that of the N-terminal domain of AF0491 (Fig. 2B), a similarity that was first recognized by Alexey Murzin. 2A. Murzin, personal communication. This was confirmed using pairwise comparisons: Dali returned an alignment of 79 residues with an r.m.s.d. of 2.1 Å for the CA atoms, whereas VAST reported 68 aligned residues with an r.m.s.d. for CA atoms of 2.3, score 6.5, p value of 0.002 (Fig. 1A). Consequently, we searched for sequence similarity between the two proteins using HMMer. Profiles of the N-terminal conserved region of the SBDS family scored against the YHR087W sequence with an E-value of 0.042. Reciprocally, the profile of the YHR087W sequence with its orthologues detected the SBDS family with an E-value of 0.018. Statistically significant E-values connected all the sequences contained in both families. None of these HMMer profile searches retrieved any new unrelated sequences and, as stated above, reciprocal searches produced convergent results. Thus, YHR087W is a distant sequence homologue of the AF0491 N-terminal domain and, by extension, of both the human SBDS sequence and of YLR022C, an SBDS sequence homologue that we identified in S. cerevisiae (Figs. 1A and 3). The runs of hydrophobic residues are in good agreement between both alignments, and there are also several conserved residues. The grouping by taxonomy is in agreement with the structure of the phylogenetic tree derived from the multiple sequence alignment, with all sequences in the branch of YHR087W being found exclusively in fungi (with the exception of the Zea mais sequence, which could be either a true case of horizontal transfer or the result of a fungal contamination of the corresponding EST library). The structural similarity between YHR087W and the AF0491 N-terminal domain (AF0491-N) extends over the entire structure, including conservation of the irregular β-bulge in β3 and the loop at one end of the β-sheet. Conservation of these structural details, particularly within such an unusual fold, likely indicates a shared function. There is a 9-residue loop inserted between β3 and β4 of YHR087W; this loop contains 3 residues in AF0491-N (Fig. 1A). In the NMR structure, this loop is structurally underdetermined because of a lack of resonance assignments and NOE data, most likely because of intermediate time scale conformational exchange. The electrostatic properties of YHR087W and AF0491-N are also similar (Fig. 4). One side of both proteins, formed by the side of helix α2, the irregular bulge region in strand β3 and the edge of β4 as well as by the N-terminal end of helix α4 and the loop preceding it, is particularly rich in acidic residues and devoid of basic residues, whereas the other sides of the structures have a mixture of acidic, basic, and uncharged side chains. The conservation of electrostatic surface potential is explained by the presence of a number of conserved or identical residues. Among the conserved residues are two glutamates, which contribute to the acidic side of the structure, although additional acidic residues, which are not conserved, also contribute to this feature in both structures. Notably, there is a conserved basic region (Lys31/Lys32: YHR087W/AF0491-N), which, in AF0491, is located in the large cleft formed by the three domains. Also present are several conserved hydrophobic residues, probably involved in stabilization of the fold. Functional Analysis of YLR022C and YHR087W, SBDS Homologues in S. cerevisiae—The biochemical and cellular functions of both YLR022C and YHR087W are unknown. Strains lacking the YLR022C gene are not viable, indicating it is an essential gene, whereas strains lacking YHR087W are viable (38Giaever G. Chu A.M. Ni L. Connelly C. Riles L. Veronneau S. Dow S.

https://openalex.org/W2118214304,"The small heat shock protein, α-crystallin, plays a key role in maintaining lens transparency by chaperoning structurally compromised proteins. This is of particular importance in the human lens, where proteins are exposed to post-translational modifications over the life-time of an individual. Here, we examine the structural and functional consequences of one particular modification of αA-crystallin involving the truncation of 5 C-terminal residues (αA1–168). Using novel mass spectrometry approaches and established biophysical techniques, we show that αA1–168 forms oligomeric assemblies with a lower average molecular mass than wild-type αA-crystallin (αAWT). Also apparent from the mass spectra of both αAWT and αA1–168 assemblies is the predominance of oligomers containing even numbers of subunits; interestingly, this preference is more marked for αA1–168. To examine the rate of exchange of subunits between assemblies, we mixed αB crystallin with either αAWT or αA1–168 and monitored in a real-time mass spectrometry experiment the formation of heteroligomers. The results show that there is a significant decrease in the rate of exchange when αA1–168 is involved. These reduced exchange kinetics, however, have no effect upon chaperone efficiency, which is found to be closely similar for both αAWT and αA1–168. Overall, therefore, our results allow us to conclude that, in contrast to mechanisms established for analogous proteins from plants, yeast, and bacteria, the rate of subunit exchange is not the critical parameter in determining efficient chaperone behavior for mammalian αA-crystallin.

Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). As a member of the sHSP family of proteins, it is thought that, aside from contributing to the refractive index of the lens, α-crystallin provides protection to other resident proteins that undergo unfolding events (5Horwitz J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Such destabilization may be initiated by any number of stresses during the lifetime of the lens, such as UV light exposure, oxidation, chemical modification, and post-translational modifications (6Harding J.J. Cataract: Biochemistry, Epidemiology and Pharmacology. Chapman & Hall, London1991Google Scholar). The chaperone function of α-crystallin, and the other sHSPs, involves the formation of high molecular mass complexes with these structurally compromised substrates. In the lens, however, there is no known machinery to release and refold the trapped substrate proteins; thus, with age, the levels of free, water-soluble α-crystallin in the nucleus diminish dramatically (7Rao P.V. Huang Q.L. Horwitz J. Zigler Jr., J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1245: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The chaperone function of α-crystallin, therefore, is a finite resource in the aging human lens. α-Crystallin is comprised of two highly homologous subunits, αA and αB, which, in the adult human lens, are found at an approximate ratio of 3:1 (8Horwitz J. Bova M.P. Ding L.L. Haley D.A. Stewart P.L. Eye (Lond.). 1999; 13: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Only the production of full-length αA and αB is under direct genetic control (9Palmer W.G. Papaconstantinou J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 64: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); however, a multitude of post-translational modifications to these proteins, including phosphorylation, deamidation, and truncation, have been reported in the healthy lens (4Groenen P.J. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 10Miesbauer L.R. Zhou X. Yang Z. Sun Y. Smith D.L. Smith J.B. J. Biol.

Hanson S.R. Lampi K.J. David L.L. Smith D.L. Smith J.B. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 67: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The impact of these modifications on the chaperone function of α-crystallin has been studied for many years with, in many cases, conflicting conclusions reported. For example, phosphorylation of α-crystallin has been reported variously to have no effect on chaperone activity (13Nicholl I.D. Quinlan R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 14Carver J.A. Nicholls K.A. Aquilina J.A. Truscott R.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), to reduce chaperone activity (15Kamei A. Hamaguchi T. Matsuura N. Masuda K. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2001; 24: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), or to cause a decrease in oligomeric size (16Moroni M. Garland D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1546: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that an S45D phosphorylation mimic of recombinant αB-crystallin leads to changes in subunit organization within the oligomer and consequent loss of effective chaperone function (17Aquilina J.A. Benesch J.L.P. Ding L.L. Yaron O. Horwitz J. Robinson C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28675-28680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Among the other major modifications reported for α-crystallin is truncation of residues from the C terminus. This process was first described in the bovine lens, where it was noted that a stepwise degradation of αA-crystallin at residues 169, 168, 151, and 101, and of αB-crystallin at residue 170, occurred post-synthetically (18Van Kleef F.S. De Jong W.W. Hoenders H.J. Nature. 1975; 258: 264-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This study concluded that the degradation was unlikely to be the result of enzymatic processes as it was observed during prolonged dialysis of purified α-crystallin (18Van Kleef F.S. De Jong W.W. Hoenders H.J. Nature. 1975; 258: 264-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Subsequently, in the human lens, C-terminal truncations have been reported for αA-crystallin at residues 101, 162, 168, and 172 (11Lund A.L. Smith J.B. Smith D.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 12Ma Z. Hanson S.R. Lampi K.J. David L.L. Smith D.L. Smith J.B. Exp.

Biophys. 2002; 397: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), whereas no such degradation appears to occur in αB-crystallin. Recently, total bovine lens extracts were shown to possess protease activity toward synthetic peptides corresponding to the C termini of bovine and human αA-crystallin (22Sharma K.K. Kester K. Elser N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The cleavage sites, on the carboxyl side of residues 168, 169, and 172, suggested that the reported in vivo truncation of αA-crystallin was due to the action of proteases present in lens extracts. Very recently, the calpain Lp82, which specifically removes the first 5 C-terminal residues of αA-crystallin (23Ma H. Shih M. Hata I. Fukiage C. Azuma M. Shearer T.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 67: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Nakamura Y. Fukiage C. Shih M. Ma H. David L.L. Azuma M. Shearer T.R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 1460-1466PubMed Google Scholar), has been identified in rat and calf lenses (25Ma H. Fukiage C. Azuma M. Shearer T.R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 454-461PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ueda Y. McCormack A.L. Shearer T.R. David L.L. Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 73: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This protease, however, appears to be absent from the human lens (27Fougerousse F. Bullen P. Herasse M. Lindsay S. Richard I. Wilson D. Suel L. Durand M. Robson S. Abitbol M. Beckmann J.S. Strachan T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), raising the question of an alternative protease or a non-enzymatic process being responsible for C-terminal degradation. Intriguingly, it has been shown that even in the presence of a complete protease inhibitor, R120G αB-crystallin, a mutant that causes a desmin-related myopathy, is intrinsically unstable in solution, with unfolding of the protein over time leading to aggregation and progressive truncation from the C terminus (28Treweek T.M. Rekas R. Lindner R.A. Walker M.J. Aquilina J.A. Robinson C.V. Horwitz J. Der Perng M. Quinlan R.A. Carver J.A. Febs. J. 2005; 3: 711-724Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The occurrence of similar non-enzymatic degradation cannot be ruled out in the case of αA-crystallin. In the present study, we examined the higher order oligomeric structure of recombinant αA-crystallin by means of nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry (MS). We have recently applied this technique to the examination of αB-crystallin, determining the relative populations of the various oligomers that constitute its polydisperse assembly and how they are affected by post-translational modification (17Aquilina J.A. Benesch J.L.P. Ding L.L. Yaron O. Horwitz J. Robinson C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28675-28680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 29Aquilina J.A. Benesch J.L.P. Bateman O.A. Slingsby C. Robinson C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10611-10616Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). As αA1–168 is a degradation product found in most mammalian lenses (30de Jong W.W. van Kleef F.S. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 48: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we have also expressed and characterized this truncated protein. Here, we report that αA1–168 differs from αAWT in its oligomeric structure. Significantly, removal of the 5 C-terminal residues had a profound effect upon the subunit exchange dynamics with wild-type protein. Preparation of αA-Crystallins—PCR technology was used for generation of αA1–168. DNA of αAWT was used as a template for the PCR amplification, and the following set of oligonucleotide primers was used: forward, 5′-GAATCTCATATGGATATCGCCATTCAGCAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTATCCTCGAGTTAGCTGGGCTTCTCCT-3′. Two restriction sites were added to the PCR product, an NdeI site at the 5′ and an XhoI site at the 3′. The expression vector pET 21b(+) was linearized with NdeI and XhoI and subsequently ligated with the gel-purified PCR product using the same cohesive ends. The ligation product was then transformed into Escherichia coli One Shot cells by standard methods. After amplification of the construct, plasmid DNA was extracted using the QIAprep Spin system. The DNA was digested with NdeI and XhoI and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Clones containing the DNA insert of αA1–168 were sequenced to confirm the presence of the DNA insert. Plasmid DNA of αA1–168 was introduced into the BL 21(DE3) strain of E. coli by standard methods. The cells were grown in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C for 3 h following induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was washed with fresh Luria-Bertani medium. The bacteria were disrupted at 37 °C for 15 min with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing lysozyme at 100 μg/ml. Protein purification was by methods described previously (31Horwitz J. Huang Q.L. Ding L. Bova M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 365-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Size Exclusion Chromatography-Light Scattering—The native proteins were analyzed by using size exclusion chromatography with online light scattering, absorbance, and refractive index detectors (32Wyatt P.J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272: 1-40Crossref Scopus (1299) Google Scholar, 33Wen J. Arakawa T. Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). A Superose 6HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) was connected in line to a UV detector (Amersham Biosciences UV-900), a Dawn-EOS (Wyatt Technology Corp.) multiangle laser light scattering detector, and an Optilab-DSP (Wyatt Technology Corp.) refractive index detector. Samples were loaded onto the column at a concentration of 1.5 mg/ml and eluted with 200 mm ammonium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Approximately 1 mg of the purified and concentrated protein (50 mg/ml) was buffer-exchanged by loading onto a Superose 6 PC 3.2/30 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluting at 0.07 ml/min with 200 mm ammonium acetate, at 5 °C. Fractions corresponding to the peak elution volume were pooled and analyzed directly. Nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry experiments were performed on a Q-ToF 2 instrument (Micromass UK Ltd.) that has been modified for high mass operation (34Sobott F. Hernández H. McCammon M.G. Tito M.A. Robinson C.V. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Conditions were carefully chosen to allow the ionization and detection of the αA-crystallins without disrupting the non-covalent interactions that maintain the quaternary structure. To dissociate the oligomers, ions of the selected m/z range were collided with argon atoms in the collision cell of the mass spectrometer. The asymmetric distribution of charge between the products allowed the unambiguous identification of the products. The experimental conditions employed for the recording of these MS and tandem MS spectra were the same as those described previously (29Aquilina J.A. Benesch J.L.P. Bateman O.A. Slingsby C. Robinson C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10611-10616Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Subunit exchange analyses were performed at 43 °C using a thermo-controlled nanoelectrospray probe, designed in-house (35Benesch J.L.P. Sobott F. Robinson C.V. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 2208-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The proteins were buffer-exchanged into 200 mm ammonium acetate, and concentrations were standardized to 1.0 mg/ml by UV absorbance, assuming a molar extinction coefficient of 17,000 cm–1 m–1 for each protein in solution. Equal volumes of the proteins to be analyzed were mixed immediately prior to analysis, and acquisition of spectra was initiated within a 60-s equilibration period. Spectra were acquired as described above. Subunit exchange rates were calculated by measuring the decay of homo-oligomers as a function of time. This was achieved by monitoring the signal intensity over an m/z range 4 Thompsons wide, centered on the m/z corresponding to the maximum of the homo-oligomer peaks at the start of exchange. Regression analysis was performed using SigmaPlot software (SPSS Science). Chaperone Assay—The chaperone efficiencies of αA1–168, αAWT, and a 1:1 mixture of the two proteins toward reduced α-lactalbumin were compared by using a modified assay (17Aquilina J.A. Benesch J.L.P. Ding L.L. Yaron O. Horwitz J. Robinson C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28675-28680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Prior to the assay, a 1:1 mixture of the proteins was incubated at 43 °C for 135 min to ensure complete subunit exchange. Apo-α-lactalbumin (0.8 mg/ml final) was mixed with αA1–168, αAWT, and the 1:1 mixture at final concentrations of 0.080 and 0.032 mg/ml in the presence of 20 mm dithiothreitol. The final sample volumes were 500 μl, in 200 mm ammonium acetate. The samples, as well as a control of apo-α-lactalbumin, were placed in identical cuvettes in a heated (43 °C) multicell block. Their apparent absorbance at 360 nm was monitored in parallel over a 30-min period in a Cary 500 Scan spectrophotometer. Effect of C-terminal Truncation on Oligomeric Size of αA-Crystallin—Two separate approaches were used to investigate the oligomeric size of αAWT and αA1–168: size exclusion chromatography/multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) and nanoelectrospray-MS under non-dissociating conditions. Fig. 1A shows the SEC-MALS profiles of αAWT and the αA1–168 truncation mutant. Both proteins eluted as single symmetrical peaks, but αA1–168 eluted slightly later than αAWT. The calculated molar masses for species eluting at the top of each peak were 540 kDa for αAWT and 440 kDa for αA1–168. The slightly broader peak width at half-maximum and the corresponding SEC-MALS measurement for αAWT also suggested that it was somewhat more polydisperse than αA1–168. The mass spectra of the two proteins were acquired under non-dissociating conditions and compared (Fig. 1B). Both species exhibited broad unresolved peaks characteristic of polydisperse proteins (17Aquilina J.A. Benesch J.L.P. Ding L.L. Yaron O. Horwitz J. Robinson C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28675-28680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 29Aquilina J.A. Benesch J.L.P. Bateman O.A. Slingsby C. Robinson C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10611-10616Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Although the spectra are not directly interpretable, the signal for αA1–168 is at slightly lower m/z values than those for αAWT, suggesting that it is of lower average molecular mass. In agreement with the SEC-MALS data, αA1–168 also appeared to be slightly less polydisperse than αAWT as the signal was not spread over quite as wide an m/z range. These two experiments demonstrate that removal of the 5 C-terminal residues causes both a slight reduction in polydispersity and a decrease in the average oligomeric size of αA-crystallin. Effect of C-terminal Truncation on Oligomeric Assembly of αA-Crystallin—Neither the SEC-MALS nor the MS experiments described above are capable of distinguishing between the different species within a polydisperse sample. We have, however, recently developed a tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) approach that allows us to characterize the oligomers that constitute the overall assembly and to quantify their individual contributions (17Aquilina J.A. Benesch J.L.P. Ding L.L. Yaron O. Horwitz J. Robinson C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28675-28680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 29Aquilina J.A. Benesch J.L.P. Bateman O.A. Slingsby C. Robinson C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10611-10616Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). MS/MS involves the selection of ions in a defined m/z window, prior to collision-induced dissociation with a neutral gas. In this case, the m/z window was chosen to select the peak corresponding to all oligomeric species, in which each carries an average of two positive charges per subunit (i.e. [(n)mer](2n)+) (29Aquilina J.A. Benesch J.L.P. Bateman O.A. Slingsby C. Robinson C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10611-10616Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). During the MS/MS process, monomers dissociate asymmetrically from the oligomers, giving rise to spectra in which highly charged monomers are observed at low m/z, whereas oligomers, stripped of up to three subunits, give rise to signals at high m/z values (29Aquilina J.A. Benesch J.L.P. Bateman O.A. Slingsby C. Robinson C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10611-10616Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The region of the spectrum corresponding to oligomers from which two subunits have been dissociated in the MS/MS analysis of αAWT and αA1–168 is presented in Fig. 2B. These doubly stripped oligomers are sufficiently separated to enable the assignment of charge states to the peaks. Given that they originated from oligomers with two additional subunits, we are able to calculate the range and relative population of species in the sample (Fig. 2C). The major oligomers present in αAWT ranged from 22 to 30 with a mean oligomeric size of 25.7 subunits. αA1–168, on the other hand, consisted of oligomers in the lower range of 20–27 with an accompanying lower mean size of 23.1 subunits. This is in good agreement with the SEC-MALS data, which find αAWT and αA1–168 to be composed, on average, of 27 and 22 subunits, respectively. Moreover, both proteins exhibited a preference to form oligomers containing an even number of monomers, a characteristic we have previously observed in recombinant αB-crystallin (17Aquilina J.A. Benesch J.L.P. Ding L.L. Yaron O. Horwitz J. Robinson C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28675-28680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the level of this “dimeric preference” appears to be slightly greater in the case of αA1–168. Effect of C-terminal Truncation on Subunit Dynamics of αA-Crystallin—Previous measurements of subunit exchange in α-crystallin have been performed using fluorescence resonance energy transfer after prelabeling the protein with donor and receptor molecules (36Bova M.P. Ding L.L. Horwitz J. Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29511-29517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 37Bova M.P. McHaourab H.S. Han Y. Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1035-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This technique requires that labeling be performed for extensive periods at 22 and 37 °C prior to the initiation of subunit exchange. The use of MS in the analysis of subunit exchange has the advantage of being able to use unmodified protein without prior incubation at elevated temperature. A study of the exchange kinetics of monodisperse plant sHSPs demonstrated that MS is a powerful approach for the real-time analysis of transient species and their relative populations during the subunit exchange of multimeric protein complexes (38Sobott F. Benesch J.L.P. Vierling E. Robinson C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38921-38929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The application of this technique to the α-crystallins required a different approach due to the spectral complexity that arises from their polydispersity. Here, we have developed a technique in which the mass of the major overlapping peak in the doubly stripped oligomer region is monitored. In this way, it is possible to follow gross changes in the subunit composition of two oligomers over time. This is due to the fact that the major overlapping peak for a homo-oligomer in this region occurs at an m/z value equal to the mass of the monomer, i.e. where all oligomers carry one charge per subunit (29Aquilina J.A. Benesch J.L.P. Bateman O.A. Slingsby C. Robinson C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10611-10616Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Thus, at the first time point after preparing an equimolar mixture of αAWT and αBWT, two distinct peaks at 19790 and 20160 m/z were observed, which correspond to the monomeric mass of the two proteins, respectively (Fig. 3A). Over time, these peaks broadened and converged to a midpoint corresponding to fully exchanged hetero-oligomers of αA and αB: a single peak centered around 19 975 m/z (the average mass of the two subunits) after ∼30 min of exchange at 43 °C. This confirms that, on average, the hetero-oligomers formed contain an approximately equal number of the two different subunits. In subunit exchange experiments in which αA1–168 was mixed with either αAWT or αBWT, very different exchange dynamics were observed. Fig. 3B shows spectra acquired during the same time period for subunit exchange of αA1–168 with αAWT. Again, at the start of the experiment, peaks for each protein were present at m/z values equivalent to their monomer masses. However, unlike exchange between the full-length proteins, after 30 min, little subunit exchange had occurred. Full exchange was not achieved until ∼80 min after mixing (not shown). Similarly, exchange between αA1–168 and αBWT (Fig. 3C) was also found to be much slower than for both full-length proteins. By plotting the decrease in intensity of the various homo-oligomers, we obtained graphs that allowed us to determine the rates of subunit exchange (Fig. 4). First order rate constants of 8.9 × 10–2 min–1, 3.4 × 10–2 min–1, and 4.3 × 10–2 min–1 were calculated for the exchange of αAWT:αBWT, αA1–168:αAWT, and αA1–168:αBWT, respectively. Thus, a 2–3-fold decrease in exchange rate when αA1–168 is involved demonstrates that truncation of the αA-crystallin C terminus dramatically compromises the dynamics of this protein. Spectra recorded during the subunit exchange process, in the region corresponding to the monomers dissociated from the oligomers during the tandem MS process, were also examined (Fig. 5). The spectrum acquired after 2 min of exchange showed a clear preponderance of charge states arising from αAWT monomers. Since these protein subunits are released as a result of collisional activation of the oligomers, this observation suggests that under these gas-phase conditions, αAWT is a less stable oligomer than αBWT. Over the course of the experiment, however, a marked shift in the relative levels of dissociated species was observed such that after 24 min, αBWT monomers accounted for 75% of the monomer population (Fig. 5). Thus, as the homo-oligomers mixed to form equilibrated hetero-oligomers, the lability of αBWT relative to αAWT increased greater than 2-fold. The same trend was not observed in the case of the αA1–168:αAWT mixtures (data not shown), suggesting that αAWT and αBWT may occupy quite distinct regions in the quaternary arrangement of total α-crystallin oligomers. Effect of C-terminal Truncation on Chaperone Function of αA-Crystallin—As this truncation is found in vivo, and we have shown that it does form hetero-oligomers with the full-length α-crystallins, albeit on a slower time scale, a pertinent factor is whether these hetero-oligomers have altered chaperone function as compared with the wild-type proteins. The chaperone efficacy of αA1–168versus αAWT has been compared previously, with no difference between the two proteins reported (39Thampi P. Abraham E.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11857-11863Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We repeated these experiments in phosphate-buffered saline, and our results agree with this observation (data not shown). For completeness, however, we also performed chaperone assays in ammonium acetate, the same buffer as that used for the subunit exchange MS. These assays compared the ability of αAWT, αA1–168, or a 1:1 equilibrated mixture of the two to prevent the aggregation of reduced α-lactalbumin at 43 °C (Fig. 6). The results show that a 1:10 w/w ratio of chaperone to substrate was sufficient in all cases to provide almost complete protection against aggregation over a 30-min period. Upon reducing this ratio to 1:25 w/w, partial protection against aggregation was still conferred to the substrate as compared with the control, and no significant difference in chaperone efficacy was observed between αAWT, αA1–168, or the 1:1 equilibrated mixture. Taken together with the subunit exchange data (Figs. 4 and 5), this is an important finding that demonstrates that chaperone activity is not directly related to subunit dynamics. We have examined the effects of truncation of the 5 C-terminal residues on the oligomerization, subunit exchange, and chaperone-like function of recombinant αA-crystallin. It has been reported previously that the oligomeric state of αAWT is not affected by this truncation; however, we found αA1–168 to have an average molecular mass of ∼80 kDa less than αAWT. Moreover, the modified protein displayed a slight reduction in polydispersity and an increased preference to form oligomers with an even number of subunits as compared with wild type. It is thought that the C-terminal extensions of the mammalian sHSPs may be responsible for their relative polydispersity as compared with those of plant, yeast, and bacterial origin (40Treweek T.M. Morris A.M. Carver J.A. Aust. J. Chem. 2003; 56: 357-367Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In fact, consistent with this thesis, it has been reported that deletion of 11 or more C-terminal residues results in the formation of an octameric species of αA-crystallin (39Thampi P. Abraham E.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11857-11863Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Clearly, αA1–168 exhibited no such homogeneity, but the decrease in size and polydispersity does support the C termini as being determinants of polydispersity. We have shown previously that perturbation of the N terminus of αB-crystallin, by phosphorylation at Ser-45, leads to an increase in polydispersity and a decrease in dimeric preference (17Aquilina J.A. Benesch J.L.P. Ding L.L. Yaron O. Horwitz J. Robinson C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28675-28680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the observation here that C-terminal perturbation causes a decrease in polydispersity and an increase in dimeric preference. Taking these results together, we propose that the N termini of the α-crystallins are responsible for dimeric interactions, whereas the C termini regulate global quaternary structure and variability. Truncation was found to not only affect oligomeric organization but also to have a profound impact on the dynamics of the crystallin assemblies. Subunit exchange experiments revealed that although a mixture of αAWT and αBWT reached equilibrium within a 30-min time period, when the exchange involved αA1–168, there was a marked decrease in the rate of reaction. Thus, the C terminus of αA-crystallin plays an important role in subunit exchange dynamics. The mechanisms involved in this process are not clear, but NMR studies have shown that αA- and αB-crystallin possess highly flexible and solvent-accessible C-terminal extensions of 8 and 10 amino acid residues, respectively (41Carver J.A. Aquilina J.A. Truscott R.J. Ralston G.B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These tails may act as “keys” in opening up an exchange pathway, their hydrophilicity encouraging the detachment of suboligomeric species, which are then free to interact with different oligomers. This suggests that the retarded rate of exchange observed upon removal of the last few residues of these tails (SAPSS in the case of αAWT) is due to an increase in the activation energy of the dissociation process. Subunit exchange of the sHSPs is a first order process (36Bova M.P. Ding L.L. Horwitz J. Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29511-29517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 37Bova M.P. McHaourab H.S. Han Y. Fung B.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 38921-38929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and consequently, dissociation of the oligomers into suboligomeric species is rate-determining. This means that the reduced subunit exchange dynamics of αA1–168 relative to αAWT lead to a decrease in the concentration of these suboligomeric species in solution. The assays performed here and previously (39Thampi P. Abraham E.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11857-11863Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), however, do not reveal a difference in the chaperone efficiency among αAWT, αA1–168, or indeed a mixture of the two. This implies that there is no correlation between the concentration of free suboligomeric species and chaperone activity, and therefore, for these proteins, it is the intact oligomers that are the functional chaperoning units. This conclusion contrasts with that reached for the non-mammalian sHSPs, in which it has been proposed that dimers are the active units involved in chaperone activity (42Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 43van Montfort R. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 59: 105-156Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar). It may, however, also explain the observation that, unlike plant (35Benesch J.L.P. Sobott F. Robinson C.V. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 2208-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and yeast (42Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) sHSPs, the α-crystallins do not dissociate at heat-shock temperatures (44Vanhoudt J. Aerts T. Abgar S. Clauwaert J. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These observations highlight that despite the many similarities between members of the sHSP family, there are important differences too. The dissimilarity displayed in the chaperone mechanism between the non-mammalian sHSPs and the α-crystallins may well be due to the environmental conditions to which the host organism is exposed. Mammals have a highly evolved body temperature regulatory system in which temperatures more than a few degrees above normal are rarely attained. As a result, the α-crystallins are perfectly functioning sHSPs at 37 °C, exclusively in oligomeric forms, in which they are quite capable of recognizing and binding unfolding substrate proteins. On the other hand, bacteria and plants in particular are exposed to climatic conditions involving huge fluctuations in ambient and thus cellular temperature. It is perhaps due to this that the latter have sHSPs that can respond, through dissociative mechanisms, to extremes of temperature, whereas this function is not required for the mammalian sHSPs. The primary function of subunit exchange in α-crystallin may in fact be to obtain the optimum ratio and arrangement of αAto αB subunits (or with the other sHSPs outside of the lens) for the specific cellular conditions and requirements. Evidence for this arises from the observation that during the exchange reaction between the wild-type proteins, monomers of αAWT became less likely to be dissociated from the hetero-oligomers than αBWT. This agrees with the suggestion that αAWT subunits are incorporated predominantly in the core of these mixed assemblies (45Asselbergs F.A. Koopmans M. Van Venrooij W.J. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 91: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 46Walsh M.T. Sen A.C. Chakrabarti B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20079-20084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thus, that favored quaternary arrangements of these hetero-oligomers exist. The dynamics that we observe through subunit exchange may in fact not be required for the proper function of a specific oligomer but rather are necessary for the formation of the most efficient hetero-oligomer for a specific cellular task. The αA1–168 truncation has been found exclusively in the water-insoluble fraction of the human lens (11Lund A.L. Smith J.B. Smith D.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 19Takemoto L.J. Curr. Eye Res. 1995; 14: 837-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may compromise the function of α-crystallin due to a reduction in solubility, brought about by the removal of the hydrophilic C terminus. Furthermore, higher levels of C-terminally truncated αA-crystallin have been found in cataractous as compared with normal human lenses (47Takemoto L.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), implicating this degradation product in age-related nuclear cataract. Although αA1–168 appears to have similar chaperone function to αAWT in vitro, we have demonstrated in this study that the subunit dynamics of the oligomers are severely impaired by this truncation, and it is this that may have profound consequences in the crowded milieu of the cell interior. We thank John Carver (University of Adelaide, Australia) for helpful discussions."

These events are initiated by an α-secretase-mediated release of the extracellular domain followed by a γ-secretase-mediated intramembrane cleavage. However, the specific determinants of p75NTR cleavage events are unknown. Many other substrates of γ-secretase cleavage have been identified, including Notch, amyloid precursor protein, and ErbB4, indicating there is broad substrate recognition by γ-secretase. Using a series of deletion mutations and chimeric receptors of p75NTR and the related Fas receptor, we have identified domains that are essential for p75NTR proteolysis. The initial α-secretase cleavage was extracellular to the transmembrane domain. Unfortunately, deletion mutants were not capable of defining the requirements of ectodomain shedding. Although this cleavage is promiscuous with respect to amino acid sequence, its position with respect to the transmembrane domain is invariant. The generation of chimeric receptors exchanging different domains of noncleavable Fas receptor with p75NTR, however, revealed that a discrete domain above the membrane is sufficient for efficient cleavage of p75NTR. Mass spectrometric analysis confirmed the cleavage can occur with a truncated p75NTR displaying only 15 extracellular amino acids in the stalk region.

This family of receptors is distinguished with multiple cysteine-rich domains for ligand binding, a single transmembrane sequence, and a noncatalytic cytoplasmic domain (2Locksley R. Killeen N. Lenardo M. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3038) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic analyses show a great deal of similarity between the cysteine-rich repeats of p75NTR and the p55 TNF receptor (3Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H-J.

The intracellular region of several receptors, including the p55 TNF receptor, Fas receptor (FasR), and p75NTR, contains a death domain sequence (5Feinstein E. Kimchi A. Wallach D. Boldin M. Varfolomeev E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 342-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The death domain serves as a protein-protein docking site and is required for initiating TNF- and Fas-dependent cytotoxicity. Activation of TNF receptor members leads to the recruitment of proteins including TNF-associated factors, death domain-containing proteins TRADD (6Hsu H. Shu H-B. Pan M.-P. Goeddel D.V.

In addition, neurotrophins also initiate signaling through tropomyosin-related kinase tyrosine kinase receptors, which are capable of forming high affinity binding sites with p75NTR that potentiate responses to low concentrations of neurotrophins (11Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 19: 321-326Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (778) Google Scholar). In the absence of tropomyosin-related kinase receptors, p75NTR is capable of independent signaling that activates NF-κB or c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity (12Hempstead B. Curr. Opin.

In selected cell types, p75NTR can initiate cell death (14Frade J.M. Rodriguez-Tebar A. Barde Y-A. Nature. 1996; 383: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 15Casaccia-Bonnefil P.

Alternatively, p75NTR can serve as a co-receptor with Nogo receptor in blocking regeneration in the central nervous system (18Wang K. Kim J. Sivasankaran R. Segal R. He Z.

Intramembrane cleavage events have been described recently for p75NTR (21Kanning K. Hudson M. Amieux P. Wiley J. Bothwell M. Schecterson L. J.

Proteolysis through regulated intramembrane proteolysis has emerged as a highly conserved mechanism in receptor signaling (23Fortini M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Kopan R. Science. 2004; 305: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Presenilin-dependent γ-secretase activity is responsible for the intramembrane proteolysis of an increasing number of membrane proteins, including Notch, ErbB4 tyrosine kinase receptors, CD44, low density lipoprotein, and β-amyloid precursor protein (24Ebinu J. Yankner B. Neuron. 2002; 34: 499-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). γ-Secretase is a large protein complex with an unusual aspartyl protease activity that cleaves substrates within the transmembrane domain and requires presenilins and other components, such as nicastrin, Pen-2, and Aph-1 (26Iwatsubo T. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Prior to γ-secretase cleavage, p75NTR undergoes extracellular cleavage events that release the ectodomain of the receptor. Previous studies indicated that the γ-secretase cleavage occurs in the middle of the transmembrane domain (22Jung K-M. Landman N. Tan S. Petrova K. Murray S. Lewis R. Kim P. Kim D. Ryu S. Chao M. Kim T.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42161-42169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, the requirements for the initial α-secretase events remain unknown. In this study we defined the specific domains in p75NTR that are susceptible to α-secretase and subsequent γ-secretase cleavage. Analyses of a series of chimeric receptors identified a 15-amino acid region of p75NTR that is sufficient for inducing α-secretase cleavage. We also found that the initial α-secretase cleavage is required for the subsequent γ-secretase cleavage. Therefore, susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage is dependent upon specific regions and structural features of p75NTR. Materials—Phorbol-12 myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was purchased from Sigma. TAPI-1, GM 6001, clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (27Vecchi M. Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and compound E (γ-secretase inhibitor XVIII) were purchased from Calbiochem. Plasmids—Deletion constructs Δ204–209, Δ210–215, and Δ216–221 in p75NTR were produced by site-directed mutagenesis using rat pCDNA3-p75NTR as a template. Deletion constructs of human pIRES-p75NTRΔ168–218 and Δ187–218 were from A. Le Bivic (Faculté des Sciences de Luminy, Marseille, France). The construction of p75NTR-Δ14 was described previously (22Jung K-M. Landman N. Tan S. Petrova K. Murray S. Lewis R. Kim P. Kim D. Ryu S. Chao M. Kim T.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42161-42169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The deletion construct HA p75NTR-Δ15 lacking the entire extracellular domain except 15 amino acids proximal to the membrane was generated using a PCR strategy. Rat pCDNA3-p75NTR was used as a template, and the insert was cloned into pCDNA3.1 using XbaI and KpnI sites. The construction of the P1 and P2 chimeric receptors of p75NTR and the Fas receptor (called B9 and A7) was described previously (28Kong H. Kim A.H. Orlinick J.R. Chao M.V. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Additional chimeras in this study were produced using a similar hybrid PCR-based strategy and appropriate pairs of primers. All of the constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing. Cell Culture Treatments and Transfection—PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 10% horse serum supplemented with 2 mm glutamine. HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For transient transfection, Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) reagents were used according to the manufacturer's protocol. In cleavage experiments cells were treated for 45 min with 100 ng/ml PMA and overnight with 1 μm compound E, 20 μm TAPI-1, 10 μm GM 6001, and 5 μmclasto-lactacystin β-lactone. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline on ice, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay III buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay. Schwann Cell Culture—Schwann cells were isolated from postnatal day 3 Sprague-Dawley rat pups (29Brockes J. Fields K. Raff M. Brain Res. 1979; 165: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in the logarithmic phase of growth in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and 2 μm forskolin (Sigma). Dorsal Root Ganglion Neuronal Cultures—Dorsal root ganglion neuron cultures were prepared as described previously (30Kleitman N. Wood P. Bunge R. Goslin B. Culturing Nerve Cells. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA1991Google Scholar). Neurons were cultured on ammoniated collagen-coated 60-mm tissue culture dishes, using 30–40 ganglia per dish, in the presence of “C” medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (Harlan Bioproducts for Science), 2 mm glutamine, and 11 mm glucose). The next day, the cultures were treated with CF medium (C medium plus 2.5 μg/ml fluorodeoxyuridine and 2.5 μg/ml deoxyuridine). The cultures were alternately fed C or CF medium for 2.5 weeks to remove non-neuronal cells. Western Blot Analysis—SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis were performed following standard protocols on 4–20% or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis and protein transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), the following primary antibodies were used (dilutions in parentheses): rabbit polyclonal antisera 9992 against the intracellular domain of p75NTR (1:3000), monoclonal HA.11 (Covance) (1:2000), and the Fas receptor (M20) sc-716 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1:500) rabbit polyclonal antibody against the intracellular domain of FasR. Purification of HA-tagged p75 Extracellular Domain—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with HA-p75NTR-Δ15 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. On day 2, the medium was harvested, clarified by centrifugation, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 ml (settled resin volume) of anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche Applied Science). The anti-HA affinity matrix was collected by brief centrifugation and washed with 20 ml of washing buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Tween 20). The bound protein was eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.0. The affinity purified proteins were analyzed by the dot-blot method using monoclonal HA.11 (Covance). The fraction positive for HA immunoreactivity was analyzed by MALDI Q-TOF mass spectrometry. MALDI Q-TOF Mass Spectrometry—The concentrated affinity-purified supernatant fluid (20 μl) was dried under vacuum and redissolved in 5 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 2% acetonitrile. The reconstituted solution was desalted using a U-C18 reverse-phase ZipTip column (Millipore). The eluate (50% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was dried and redissolved in 2.5 μl of 2,6-dihydroxyacetophenone MALDI matrix solution. The 2,6-dihydroxyacetophenone matrix solution (50 mm) was prepared by dissolving 15.2 mg of 2,6-dihydroxyacetophenone in 1 ml of water/methanol (10:90, v/v) followed by the addition of 100 mm diammonium citrate in water at a ratio of 1:1 (v/v). The sample matrix mixture (1.2 μl) was spotted onto the MALDI sample stage and air-dried. Positive ion MALDI Q-TOF mass spectra were acquired with a Micromass Q-TOF Ultima MALDI mass spectrometer (Waters). The instrument was operated in V mode with a mass resolution of ∼10,000, which enabled the mass accuracy of 5–10 ppm after internal calibration. Mass spectra were acquired and processed using Masslynx 4.0 software (Micromass) with standard instrument settings. A total of 260 laser shots were averaged per mass spectrum, the background subtracted, and the spectrum smoothed using mass windows appropriate for the significant peak widths. It has been known for many years that p75NTR undergoes ectodomain shedding (31DiStefano P. Chelsea D. Brain Res. 1990; 534: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 32DiStefano P. Chelsea D. Schick C. McKelvy J. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2405-2414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ectodomain cleavage of full-length p75NTR releases the extracellular domain from an ∼28-kDa membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (CTF). The CTF is subsequently cleaved by γ-secretase to give rise to the soluble p75NTR intracellular domain, p75-ICD (21Kanning K. Hudson M. Amieux P. Wiley J. Bothwell M. Schecterson L. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Jung K-M. Landman N. Tan S. Petrova K. Murray S. Lewis R. Kim P. Kim D. Ryu S. Chao M. Kim T.-W. J. Biol.

To examine whether p75NTR is cleaved endogenously, we tested primary Schwann cells isolated from rat sciatic nerve. The mature 75-kDa receptor is abundantly expressed in Schwann cells (33Lemke G. Chao M.V. Development (Camb.). 1988; 102: 499-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34DiStefano P. Johnson E. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 231-241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blotting with an antibody directed against the cytoplasmic domain of p75NTR revealed an immature underglycosylated form at 45 kDa and fragments at ∼24 kDa consistent with the p75NTR CTF. A protein at ∼19 kDa consistent with a γ-secretase cleavage event (p75-ICD) was also observed (Fig. 1A). We examined whether these fragments were sensitive to inhibitors of γ-secretase. Synthetic γ-secretase inhibitors can block the intramembrane cleavage and cause an accumulation of the C-terminal fragments of p75NTR. Treatment of the p75NTR-expressing Schwann cells with the potent γ-secretase inhibitor compound E (35Seiffert D. Bradley J. Rominger C. Rominger D. Yang F. Meredith Jr., J. Wang Q. Roach A.

Furthermore TAPI-1, a general inhibitor of metalloproteases (36Slack B. Ma L. Seah C. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), blocked both extracellular domain shedding and γ-secretase cleavage, whereas treatment with phorbol esters such as PMA, well known activators of ectodomain shedding of several receptors (37Blobel C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar), promoted accumulation of both fragments (Fig. 1A). These experiments suggest that the removal of the bulk of the extracellular region is a necessary step to allow intramembrane proteolysis by γ-secretase. Finally inhibition of the proteasome with clasto-lactacystin β-lactone led to an accumulation of the ICD by blocking its degradation. This indicates that the γ-secretase-generated fragment is quite unstable. To test the generality of this cleavage event, PC12 cells and dorsal root ganglion neurons were tested for the proteolytic processing of p75NTR. A similar set of p75NTR fragments was detected in primary dorsal root ganglion neurons and in PC12 cells (Fig. 1B). Treatment with PMA and compound E yielded the same pattern of production of the CTF and ICD fragments (Fig. 1), indicating that cleavage of p75NTR occurs in both glial and neuronal cell backgrounds. Defining the α-Secretase Cleavage Event—To define and map the cleavage sites further, we expressed an N-terminal HA-tagged p75NTR cDNA in HEK293 cells. After treatment with PMA and compound E, p75NTR proteolytic products were observed at the expected sizes (Fig. 2A). As expected, the fragments were specifically detected with the antibody directed against the C terminus of the receptor (Fig. 2B, 9992) but not with the N-terminal HA tag (Fig. 2B). The increase in CTFs and ICD fragments obtained in the presence of PMA could be blocked by pretreatment with GM 6001, a broad range matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor (38Galardy R. Grobelny D. Foellmer H. Fernandez L. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4715-4718PubMed Google Scholar), confirming that the removal of the extracellular domain is important for intramembrane proteolysis by γ-secretase (Fig. 2C). To identify the α-secretase cleavage site, we produced a series of deletions of the stalk domain of p75NTR that extended from the transmembrane domain to the cysteine-rich repeats of the extracellular domain. This region consists of 62 amino acids and is particularly rich in serine and threonine residues. Glycosylation of p75NTR on O-linked sugars occurs in this domain (39Yeaman C. LeGall A. Baldwin A. Monlauzeur L. LeBivic A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Together with N-linked glycosylation at the N-terminal region, these posttranslational modifications account for almost half of the apparent molecular weight of the receptor. We focused on the stalk domain for a number of reasons. First, according to the apparent mass of the CTF, the cleavage is predicted to occur in the proximity of the transmembrane domain. Second, the stalk domain proximal to the transmembrane domain is very highly conserved (>89%). Also, proteolytic cleavage events by metalloproteinases have been identified in the stalk domain of other receptors. We produced three nonoverlapping deletions of six amino acids (Δ204–209, Δ210–215, and Δ216–221) that spanned this conserved region. We also tested two larger deletions (Δ168–218 and Δ187–218). All the mutants expressed in HEK293 cells produced the CTFs, as assessed by a specific antibody against p75NTR (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, even a deletion that removes most of the stalk domain except for 12 amino acids (Δ168–218) was processed. It is important to note that the CTFs generated by the deletion constructs all migrated with the same mobility, suggesting that the α-cleavage site is located below the most C-terminal deletion (Δ216–221). Another study found that the initial sequence of the transmembrane domain (NLIPV) is also not needed for α-secretase cleavage (40Weskamp G. Schlondorff J. Lum L. Becherer J. Kim T. Saftig P. Hartmann D. Murphy G. Blobel C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4241-4249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the cleavage site or the recognition site for α-secretase may not entirely be determined by sequence but by a location relative to a distance from the membrane. The enzyme-substrate recognition site may be located distal to the cleavage site. This mechanism is plausible, because it has been suggested for several transmembrane proteins undergoing extracellular domain shedding by matrix metalloproteinases, such as amyloid precursor protein and L-selectin (41Schlondorff J. Blobel C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3603-3617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Zhao L-c. Shey M. Farnsworth M. Dailey M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30631-30640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry Analysis—To identify the α-cleavage site by an independent approach, we purified the truncated fragment released in the cell medium. Because of extensive glycosylation of p75NTR in the extracellular domain, it was not feasible to use mass spectrometry to identify the glycosylated product of the full-length receptor released in the medium. We therefore generated a shortened p75NTR construct (Δ15) that lacked all four cysteine-rich repeats and a large segment of the juxtamembrane stalk. A HA epitope tag was placed at the N terminus of Δ15. Expression of the Δ15 p75NTR construct in HEK293 cells produced a full-length fragment and smaller fragments consistent with the size of the CTF and ICD, as assessed by anti-p75 antibody (Fig. 4A). Conditioned media from cells transiently expressing Δ15 were collected and purified using an HA affinity resin. The fractions were analyzed by dot blot and by MALDI Q-TOF mass spectrometry. The MALDI Q-TOF mass spectrometry analysis detected two different peptide ions with monoisotopic masses (M + H+) of 1988.9 and 1689.7 corresponding to the peptide sequences of HA-MGSSQPVVT and HA-MGSSQP, respectively (Fig. 4B). The inset to Fig. 4B shows the sequence of peptide g m/z 1988.9. The peptides were also sequenced with collision-induced dissociation (tandem mass spectrometry), which confirmed the results obtained by MALDI Q-TOF mass spectrometry. Proteolytic processing was previously observed in two deletion mutants (Δ210–215 and Δ216–221) that lacked sequences in the stalk domain (Fig. 3A). The cleavage sites that were utilized in the two deletions possess sequences that are different from the Δ15 cleavage site determined by mass spectrometry. A recent investigation of the matrix metalloproteinase TNF-α-converting enzyme cleavage of p75NTR implied that one potential cleavage occurred after the amino acid sequence MGSSQP (40Weskamp G. Schlondorff J. Lum L. Becherer J. Kim T. Saftig P. Hartmann D. Murphy G. Blobel C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4241-4249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), which is consistent with our mass spectrometry analysis. An alternative explanation is that the cleavage site is not determined by a specific sequence motif but occurs at an invariant location relative to the membrane. In this case, specificity of cleavage may be determined by sequences located at some distance away from the cleavage site. Chimeric Receptor Analysis—To assess which domains are most responsible for the initial cleavage of p75NTR, we generated a series of chimera receptors between p75NTR and the FasR, a related member of the TNF receptor superfamily. The FasR is also a type I transmembrane receptor containing canonical cysteine-rich domains followed by a short stalk region and a single membrane-spanning domain. In addition, the FasR contains a death domain in the cytoplasmic region. We first tested whether FasR is proteolytically processed in a fashion similar to p75NTR processing. The FasR was expressed in HEK293 cells and lysates probed with an antibody directed against the intracellular domain of FasR (Fig. 5A). The full-length Fas receptor (45 kDa) could be detected; however, no other fragments were detected after PMA or compound E treatment. These results imply that FasR is not an efficient substrate for α-secretase and γ-secretase proteolytic processing. Chimeric receptors were therefore generated between the extracellular portion of the FasR and the intracellular portion of p75NTR. The initial FasR chimeric receptors contained the p75NTR transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (designated P1) or only the cytoplasmic domain of p75NTR (P2). These two chimeric receptors were transiently transfected in HEK293 cells along with wild-type p75NTR. Both chimeric receptors were expressed appropriately but did not undergo processing as wild-type p75NTR (Fig. 5B). The lack of ICD production by these chimeras (P1 and P2) was not due to enhanced degradation, because treatment with lactacystin did not result in the appearance of detectable fragments (data not shown). To determine whether the extracellular and transmembrane domains of p75NTR were directly involved in α-secretase cleavage, each domain was introduced into the corresponding location in the FasR. Expression of a Fas chimera containing the p75NTR extracellular domain (F1) yielded a proteolytic product of ∼20 kDa, the expected size of a CTF produced from FasR (Fig. 6A). The FasRTM+ICD (where TM = transmembrane) calculated molecular mass is 18.5 kDa. When a Fas chimeric receptor carrying both the extracellular and transmembrane domains of p75NTR (F2) was expressed, a second product corresponding to γ-secretase cleavage was also detected, and its production was specifically inhibited by compound E (Fig. 6B). These data strongly suggest that the extracellular and the transmembrane domains of p75NTR are necessary and sufficient for promoting α- and γ-secretase processing of the receptor. To define further the domain of p75NTR that is susceptible to α- and γ-secretase cleavages, we generated a chimeric receptor in which the transmembrane domain of the FasR was introduced into p75NTR (P3). We observed a constitutively high level of CTFs produced from the P3 receptor (Fig. 7A). The level of CTFs was increased by PMA treatment but not by compound E. The absence of an ICD fragment from the P3 chimeric receptor is consistent with the role of the p75NTR transmembrane domain in processing the CTFs by γ-secretase. A greater accumulation of CTFs was therefore observed. A converse construct in which the p75NTR transmembrane domain was introduced into FasR (F3) produced no cleavage products, indicating that the p75 transmembrane sequence was not sufficient to trigger α-secretase cleavage (Fig. 7B). Finally, we exchanged the stalk domains between the two receptors. p75NTR carrying the stalk domain of FasR was no longer processed and displayed insensitivity to PMA and compound E treatments (Fig. 8A). On the other hand, when the stalk domain of p75NTR was tested in the FasR (F4), the CTF was produced. The CTF was also observed in other chimeras expressing the p75NTR extracellular domain (Fig. 6). To narrow down the sequence required for cleavage, we introduced the 15 amino acids of p75NTR proximal to the transmembrane region to the corresponding region of the FasR (F5). The CTF was observed in the F5 chimeric receptor (Fig. 8C). The production of the p75NTR CTF was inhibited by GM 6001 (Fig. 8C), indicating that a metalloproteinase-like activity catalyzed this reaction. Taken together, the analysis of the chimeric receptors together with the mass spectrometric analysis strongly suggests that the 15 amino acids of the stalk domain of p75NTR are necessary and sufficient for inducing the extracellular shedding of the receptor. Furthermore, this event is required for further processing of p75NTR by γ-secretase. Regulated intramembrane proteolysis is a conserved mechanism that has been proposed to regulate intracellular signaling events. As numerous transmembrane protein substrates for γ-secretase cleavage have been identified, an understanding of the mechanisms by which intramembrane proteases selectively recognize and cleave proteins is increasingly important. Previous studies indicate that ectodomain shedding is responsible for presenilin-dependent transmembrane cleavage (43Struhl G. Adachi A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). However, the substrate requirements for cleaving diverse membrane spanning proteins are not completely defined. The results from this study indicate that p75NTR molecules lacking the bulk of the extracellular domain serve as efficient substrates for γ-secretase action. It is worth noting that NRH2, a p75 homolog that lacks the cysteine-rich domains, is also efficiently cleaved by α-secretase activity (21Kanning K. Hudson M. Amieux P. Wiley J. Bothwell M. Schecterson L. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of NRH2 is short and does not have homology with p75NTR. Yet, NRH2 is a target of not only α-secretase but also γ-secretase activities. It is striking that the action of α-secretase does not appear to depend strictly upon a specific amino acid motif in these molecules. Deletion mutants in p75NTR indicate that α-secretase is effective in cleaving the receptor when large portions of the stalk domain are missing (40Weskamp G. Schlondorff J. Lum L. Becherer J. Kim T. Saftig P. Hartmann D. Murphy G. Blobel C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4241-4249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We have confirmed these results here with deletions in sequences above the transmembrane domain. Remarkably, we found that the sizes of the CTFs and the ICD fragments produced by each deletion mutant are nearly identical, indicating that the α-secretase is recognizing a structural feature of the receptor for its proteolytic activity. However, the structural requirements for α-secretase and γ-secretase cleavages display some degree of sequence specificity. Other related TNF receptor members, such as the Fas receptor, do not undergo cleavage like p75NTR, despite the overall similarity in structural features between the two receptors. Analysis of FasR/p75NTR chimeric receptors clearly indicated that the stalk and transmembrane domains of the two receptors behave very differently in α-secretase and γ-secretase cleavage. A 15-amino acid sequence in the stalk domain of p75NTR was sufficient to confer ectodomain shedding of the FasR. Likewise, the transmembrane sequence of p75NTR behaved as a preferred substrate for γ-secretase action over the transmembrane of FasR. Conversely, the FasR stalk and transmembrane sequences make p75NTR resistant to cleavage. Treatment of cleavage-resistant chimeric receptors with lactacystin indicated that degradation did not account for the lack of cleaved fragments (supplemental data). Because p75NTR and FasR share a similar overall structure, these chimeric receptor experiments indicate there are also sequence requirements for efficient cleavage. Cleavage of p75NTR by regulated intramembrane proteolysis is of particular importance for a number of reasons. First, each product of the cleavage may serve multiple functions. The release of the extracellular domain generates a binding protein for many potential ligands, including neurotrophins, pro-neurotrophin precursors, β-amyloid, and the rabies virus glycoprotein (13Roux P. Barker P. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 67: 203-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 44Dechant G. Barde Y-A. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1131-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Second, the ICD domain of p75NTR has the potential of binding many intracellular proteins, including TNF-associated factor 6, SC-1, NADE, NRAGE, and RhoA (12Hempstead B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 45Barker P. Neuron. 2004; 42: 529-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The p75NTR cytoplasmic domain may bring these proteins to function in different cellular compartments. The cleavage of the CTF also gives rise to a small peptide the significance of which is unknown but that is analogous to the Aβ peptides generated from amyloid precursor protein. Another compelling reason that p75NTR cleavage is important is that many cell types up-regulate p75 receptors under pathological or inflammatory conditions. For example, after seizures, there is prominent expression of p75NTR in cortical neurons (46Roux P. Colicos M. Barker P. Kennedy T. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6887-6896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of p75NTR has been observed in many cell types, including oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells, microglia, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells (10Chao M.V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 45Barker P. Neuron. 2004; 42: 529-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The early induction and cleavage of p75NTR in selective neurons that are destined to undergo intramembraneous γ-secretase cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (24Ebinu J. Yankner B. Neuron. 2002; 34: 499-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) suggests that p75NTR cleavage may be linked to other events occurring during neurodegeneration. There is currently little evidence that neurotrophin ligands of p75NTR have a major impact upon the cleavage or upon the regulation of γ-secretase activities. 2T. W. Kim, personal communication., 3N. Zampieri, unpublished results. In addition, the precise proteases responsible for the α-secretase-mediated cleavage of p75NTR have not been firmly established, although members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family are likely candidates (40Weskamp G. Schlondorff J. Lum L. Becherer J. Kim T. Saftig P. Hartmann D. Murphy G. Blobel C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4241-4249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 47Peschon J.

Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). The growing number of substrates undergoing intramembraneous cleavage raises the issue of how particular target sequences are recognized by γ-secretase. Blocking the shedding and the intramembraneous cleavage events of p75NTR using receptor sequences resistant to proteolysis will represent an important approach to defining the physiological function of these processing events.

Previous studies have indicated that both the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/checkpoint kinase (Chk) 2 and ATM- and Rad 3-related (ATR)/Chk1 checkpoint pathways are activated after treatment with these agents. The relative contributions of these two pathways to survival of cells after treatment with topoisomerase I poisons are currently unknown. To address this issue, we assessed the roles of ATR, Chk1, ATM, and Chk2 in cells treated with the topoisomerase I poisons camptothecin and 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), the active metabolite of irinotecan. Colony forming assays demonstrated that down-regulation of ATR or Chk1 sensitized cells to SN-38 and camptothecin. In contrast, ATM and Chk2 had minimal effect of sensitivity to SN-38 or camptothecin. Additional experiments demonstrated that the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, which down-regulates Chk1, also sensitized a variety of human carcinoma cell lines to SN-38. Collectively, these results show that the ATR/Chk1 pathway plays a predominant role in the response to topoisomerase I inhibitors in carcinoma cells and identify a potential approach for enhancing the efficacy of these drugs.

In response to different types of DNA damage, a number of cell cycle checkpoint pathways are activated. These pathways typically involve detection of damage by one or more DNA damage sensors followed by activation of a series of kinases that regulate cellular responses, including cell cycle arrest and DNA repair (reviewed in Refs. 1.Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar and 2.Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). One of these pathways involves the sequential action of the kinases ATM 1The abbreviations used are: ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; ATR, ATM- and Rad 3-related; Chk, checkpoint kinase; Hsp, heat shock protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; 17-AAG, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin; PDK, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; ATR, ATM- and Rad 3-related; Chk, checkpoint kinase; Hsp, heat shock protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; 17-AAG, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin; PDK, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase. and Chk2. According to current understanding, DNA double-strand breaks and other changes in chromatin structure lead to autophosphorylation of the ATM homodimer (3.Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar), which activates ATM and facilitates phosphorylation of a number of substrates (2.Abraham R.T.

Chk2 also phosphorylates members of the Cdc25 family, contributing to inhibition (Cdc25C) or degradation (Cdc25A) of these phosphatases and preventing them from activating cyclin-dependent kinase complexes that drive cell cycle progression. A second but related cell cycle checkpoint pathway involves sequential action of the kinases ATR and Chk1.

After treatment with high (micromolar) camptothecin concentrations, DNA double-strand breaks occur in the vicinity of advancing replication forks (29.Avemann K. Knipper R. Koller T. Sogo J.M. Mol.

Parallel studies in yeast have suggested that deletion of genes encoding 9-1-1 complex subunits, the 9-1-1 clamp loader, or the ATR homolog Mec1 also sensitizes cells to topoisomerase I poisoning (47.Fiorani P.

The preceding studies have implicated the ATM/Chk2 and ATR/Chk1 pathways in the response to topoisomerase I poisons but have not identified their relative contributions. To address this issue, the present study utilized siRNA, gene-deleted cells, and pharmacological manipulations to reexamine the relative roles of the ATM/Chk2 and ATR/Chk1 pathways in protecting cells from camptothecin derivatives. Results of this study not only demonstrate a more prominent role for the ATR/Chk1 pathway but also identify a potential strategy for enhancing the cytotoxicity of topoisomerase I poisons.

Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) and grown in medium A supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (medium B). T98G cells were grown in medium B supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate. HCT 116 cells from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were propagated in McCoy's 5A medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Identical results were obtained for the experiment in Fig. 5 using either HCT 116 cell isolate. siRNA Transfections—On day 1, HeLa or U2OS cells (1 × 106) were plated in 35-mm tissue culture dishes and incubated overnight.

Following addition of the lipid-siRNA complexes to the cells, the cultures were incubated for 7–9 h before addition of 1 ml of Opti-MEM containing 30% fetal bovine serum. The transfections were repeated on day 3. On day 4, the cultures were trypsinized and replated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes containing medium B. On day 5, cells were harvested for immunoblotting or exposed to drugs as described below. Clonogenic Assays—HeLa and U2OS cell clonogenic assays were performed on the siRNA-transfected cells 48 h after the second transfection. The cells were trypsinized, plated at 300 cells/plate in replicate 60-mm dishes containing medium A, allowed to adhere for 4 h, and treated with the indicated concentrations of SN-38 or camptothecin for 24 h. Following drug treatment, cells were washed with RPMI 1640 medium, cultured for 7 days in medium A, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Colonies containing ≥50 cells were counted. Colony forming assays were performed in untransfected HeLa cells and the other cell lines with the following modifications: 1) transfection was omitted; 2) cells were plated at 250 (T98G), 300 (HeLa), or 500 (HCT 116) cells/plate in 60-mm (HeLa) or 35-mm dishes (T98G and HCT 116) in their respective media and allowed to adhere for 14–16 h; and 3) after the 24-h drug exposure, cells were cultured for 7–8 (HeLa, HCT 116) or 9–10 days (T98G) to allow colonies to form. Immunoblotting—After treatment with drug or diluent as indicated in the figure legends, cells were washed three times with ice-cold RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 at 4 °C) and solubilized by addition of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride containing 250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5 at 20 °C), 10 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm freshly added phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride directly to the plates.

A Predominant Role for the ATR/Chk1 Pathways in Camptothecin Sensitivity—Previous studies demonstrated that Chk1 and Chk2 are both activated after treatment with the topoisomerase I poisons topotecan (44.Cliby W.A. Lewis K.A. Lilly K.K. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1599-1606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) or camptothecin (43.Loegering D. Arlander S.A.H.

Consistent with these results, treatment of HeLa cells with the camptothecin derivative SN-38, the active metabolite of the widely used chemotherapeutic agent irinotecan (25.Takimoto C.H. Arbuck S.G. Chabner B.A. Longo D.L. Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy: Principles and Practice. 20. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 579-646Google Scholar, 46.Slichenmyer W.J. Rowinsky E.K. Donehower R.C. Kaufmann S.H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 271-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), resulted in the concentration- and time-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 on Ser345 and Chk2 on Thr68, sites that are required for activation of the kinases (Fig. 1). Chk1 phosphorylation was detected after treatment for 6 h with SN-38 at concentrations as low as 12.5 nm (Fig. 1A) and was present within 1 h after treatment with 100 nm SN-38 (Fig. 1B). Likewise, phosphorylation of Chk2 was evident after treatment with 12.5 nm SN-38 (Fig. 1A) for 6 h or after treatment with 100 nm SN-38 for 1 h (Fig. 1B). To assess the potential importance of activating the ATR/Chk1 pathway, HeLa cells were transfected with an siRNA duplex oligonucleotide that down-regulates ATR (Fig. 2A, inset), treated for 24 h with increasing concentrations of SN-38, washed, and incubated for 7 days so that surviving cells could form colonies. Results of this analysis (Fig. 2A) demonstrated that ATR down-regulation increased SN-38 sensitivity, with a 3-fold decrease in the IC50. Likewise, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of Chk1 (Fig. 2B, inset) was accompanied by a 2-fold decrease in the SN-38 IC50 (Fig. 2B). Similar results were observed with the parent drug, camptothecin (Fig. 2C). These results are consistent with previous studies showing a comparable effect after disruption of ATR signaling by conditional expression of a dominant negative ATR construct (44.Cliby W.A. Lewis K.A. Lilly K.K. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1599-1606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) or by Rad9 deletion (43.Loegering D. Arlander S.A.H. Hackbarth J. Vroman B. Lieberman H.B. Karnitz L.M. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18641-18647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). siRNA to PDK1, a polypeptide that is discussed in greater detail below, diminished the levels of PDK1 as well as phosphorylation of the PDK1 substrate (Fig. 2D, inset) Akt on Thr308, a site phosphorylated by PDK1 and required for Akt activation. However, PDK1 siRNA did not sensitize HeLa cells to SN-38 but instead slightly decreased the antiproliferative effects of this agent (Fig. 2D). Several additional observations argue against the possibility that the sensitizing effects of siRNA targeting ATR or Chk1 are due to nonspecific toxicity. First, the cloning efficiencies of HeLa cells transfected with ATR siRNA and Chk1 siRNA were 87 ± 10% (mean ± S.D., n = 4) and 74 ± 19% (n = 9), respectively, of cells treated with control siRNA, ruling out the possibility that the siRNA was killing the bulk of the cells and allowing outgrowth of a nonrepresentative population. Second, whereas Chk1 siRNA sensitized cells to camptothecins (Fig. 2C) as well as antimetabolites such as cytarabine, 2L. M. Karnitz and K. Flatten, unpublished observations. it had no effect on sensitivity to ionizing radiation (Fig. 2E), consistent with predominant involvement of the ATM pathway in the response to DNA double-strand breaks. To rule out the possibility that the results obtained were unique to HeLa cells, U2OS human osteosarcoma cells were transfected with ATR siRNA. Once again, the cells were sensitized to SN-38 (Fig. 2F). Because U2OS cells contain an intact p53 tumor suppressor protein (60.Nghiem P. Park P.K. Kim Ys Y.S. Desai B.N. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4428-4434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), these results also rule out the possibility that ATR siRNA-induced sensitization to camptothecins occurs only in cells with an inactive p53 pathway. In contrast to ATR or Chk1 down-regulation, down-regulation of components of the ATM/Chk2 pathway had a much smaller effect on SN-38 sensitivity. Transfection of HeLa cells with ATM siRNA depleted ATM (Fig. 3A, inset) but had minimal effect on SN-38 sensitivity (Fig. 3A). In view of this surprising result, similar experiments were performed using the parent drug, camptothecin. Once again little sensitization was observed (Fig. 3B). Importantly, the same siRNA transfectants were sensitized to ionizing radiation (Fig. 3C). To further examine the effect of interrupting the ATM/Chk2 pathway, SN-38 sensitivity was compared in parental HCT 116 colon cancer cells and their Chk2−/- derivative. Once again, little difference in SN-38 (Fig. 3D) or camptothecin (Fig. 3E) sensitivity was observed. When combined with the results in Fig. 2, these observations suggest that the ATR/Chk1 pathway plays a predominant role in protecting cells from topoisomerase I poisons. Synergistic Effects of SN-38 and Hsp90 Inhibitors—In view of these results, we predicted that Chk1 depletion by other means would also sensitize cells to the antiproliferative effects of SN-38. Recent results demonstrated that Chk1 is a client of the Hsp90 chaperone complex and, correspondingly, showed that treatment with the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG resulted in selective down-regulation of Chk1 without changes in other known components of the ATR/Chk1 and ATM/Chk2 pathways (55.Arlander S.J.H. Eapen A.K. Vroman B.T. McDonald R.J. Toft D.O. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52572-52577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Examination in HeLa cells demonstrated that Chk1 down-regulation is evident at 125 nm 17-AAG (Fig. 4A), a concentration that is readily sustained for >24 h in the clinical setting (61.Goetz M. Toft D.O. Reid J.M. Ames M.M. Stensgard B. Safgren S. Adjei A.A. Sloan J. Atherton P. Vasile V. Salazaar S. Adjei A.A. Croghan G. Erlichman C. J. Clin. Oncol. 2005; 23: 1078-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Like Chk1, other Hsp90 client proteins such as PDK1 and Akt1 were depleted, whereas no change in topoisomerase I levels was observed (Fig. 4A). To assess whether loss of Hsp90 clients was accompanied by enhanced SN-38 sensitivity, cells were treated for 24 h with increasing concentrations of SN-38, 17-AAG, or a combination of both agents. To facilitate subsequent analysis, the combination consisted of the two agents at a fixed ratio determined by their respective IC50 values, and the fixed ratio was applied at a number of concentrations that included one-half, five-eighths, three-fourths, seven-eighths, and 1.5 times the individual IC50 values. This approach has been widely applied in previous analyses of new drug combinations (56.Chou T.-C. Talalay P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 27-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (5811) Google Scholar, 57.Bible K. Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3375-3380PubMed Google Scholar, 58.Adjei A.A. Budihardjo I. Rowinsky E.K.

Kaufmann S.H. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1438-1445PubMed Google Scholar). Results of this analysis showed that the combination demonstrated greater antiproliferative effects than either agent alone (Fig. 4, B and C). Formal analysis by the method of Chou and Talalay (56.Chou T.-C. Talalay P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 27-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (5811) Google Scholar) was performed under the assumption that effects of the two agents are mutually exclusive, an assumption that renders this approach equivalent to the isobologram method (62.Berenbaum M.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1989; 41: 93-141PubMed Google Scholar). This analysis (Fig. 4D) demonstrated that effects of the two agents were synergistic, as evidenced by a combination index of <1 over a wide range of concentrations (56.Chou T.-C. Talalay P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 27-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (5811) Google Scholar). In repeated experiments, the combination index was 0.75 ± 0.09 (mean ± S.D., n = 3) at the IC90. To rule out the possibility that this synergy was unique to the HeLa cell line, HCT116 colon cancer cells and T98G human glioblastoma cells were subjected to similar analyses. Immunoblotting demonstrated that 17-AAG induced down-regulation of Chk1 in these cell lines at even lower concentrations (Fig. 5, A and D), with no effect on topoisomerase I levels (data not shown). Once again, the antiproliferative effects of the SN-38/17-AAG combination were greater than those of either agent alone (Fig. 5, B and E; data not shown). Analysis by the method of Chou and Talalay (56.Chou T.-C. Talalay P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 27-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (5811) Google Scholar) indicated synergy in both cell lines (Fig. 5, C and F), with combination indices of 0.63 ± 0.12 (n = 8) and 0.65 ± .10 (n = 3), respectively, at the IC90 values. Results of the present study demonstrated that Chk1 down-regulation enhances sensitivity to the topoisomerase I poison SN-38, whereas down-regulation of ATM or deletion of Chk2 has a much smaller effect. Additional experiments showed that 17-AAG, which down-regulates Chk1, and SN-38 synergize in killing cells. These results have potentially important implications for the mechanism of action of topoisomerase I poisons and future clinical development of these agents. Early studies indicated that fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid lines from ataxia telangiectasia patients are hypersensitive to camptothecin (34.Smith P.J. Makinson T.A. Watson J.V. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1989; 55: 217-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 35.Davies S.M. Harris A.L. Hickson I.D.

Arooz T. Chow J.P. Ho H.T. Poon R.Y. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 621-632PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggested an important role for the ATM/Chk2 pathway in response to topoisomerase I poisons and provided support for a model in which the cytotoxicity of topoisomerase I poisons results from the formation of DNA double-strand breaks as a consequence of a collision between advancing replication forks and drug-stabilized topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes. More recent studies found that disruption of the ATR/Chk1 pathway also sensitizes cells to topoisomerase I poisons (43.Loegering D. Arlander S.A.H. Hackbarth J. Vroman B. Lieberman H.B. Karnitz L.M.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2483-2487PubMed Google Scholar). Because this pathway is robustly activated by agents that stall advancing replication forks (64.Chen Y. Sanchez Y. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), activation of this pathway by topoisomerase I poisons was initially somewhat surprising. The present results using siRNA constructs not only confirm that down-regulation of ATR or Chk1 sensitizes cells to topoisomerase I poisons, but they also suggest that the ATR/Chk1 pathway plays a more prominent role than the ATM/Chk2 pathway in the response to these agents. These results appear to be at odds with earlier reports suggesting that ATM inactivation enhances camptothecin sensitivity. Several differences between these studies might contribute to the disparate conclusions. First, the results may be due to cell line differences. The earlier studies utilized fibroblast and lymphoblastoid cell lines, whereas the present study employed epithelium-derived cancer cell lines. Second, the earlier studies compared cell lines from different individuals, raising the possibility that factors other than ATM status affected the results. In contrast, the present study used a single cell line treated with siRNA and an isogenic pair of cell lines differing in targeted deletion of Chk2 to reduce the number of uncontrolled variables. Third, the siRNA-mediated depletion of ATM was incomplete and, therefore, might have been less effective than the ATM inactivation seen in ataxia telangiectasia cells. It is important to point out, however, that this ATM down-regulation was sufficient to sensitize the cells to ionizing radiation (Fig. 3C). Moreover, deletion of Chk2 did not markedly alter SN-38 or camptothecin sensitivity (Fig. 3, D and E). Collectively, our results in two model systems suggest that down-regulation of the ATM/Chk2 pathway has a limited effect on sensitivity to topoisomerase I poisons. Additional experiments in a wider range of model systems might be warranted to further confirm the conclusion that the ATR/Chk1 signaling pathway plays a predominant role in response to topoisomerase I poisons. Nonetheless, the present observations suggest the interesting possibility that stalling of advancing replication forks, rather than generation of double-strand breaks, is important in the antiproliferative effect of topoisomerase I poisons at the nanomolar drug concentrations that are achieved in the clinical setting (25.Takimoto C.H. Arbuck S.G. Chabner B.A. Longo D.L. Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy: Principles and Practice. 20. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 579-646Google Scholar, 46.Slichenmyer W.J. Rowinsky E.K. Donehower R.C. Kaufmann S.H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 271-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The present results also demonstrated that the antiproliferative effects of SN-38 are enhanced in a synergistic fashion by simultaneous administration of the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG. These effects were observed in HeLa cells (Fig. 4D), which have a nonfunctional p53 pathway as a consequence of papilloma virus E6 protein expression (65.Kessis T.D. Slebos R.J. Nelson W.G. Kastan M.B. Plunkett W. Han S.M. Lorincz A.T. Hedrick L. Cho K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3988-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), as well as HCT 116 cells, which have an intact p53 pathway (66.Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5C). These synergistic effects were observed at 17-AAG concentrations in the 50–300 nm range. Recent studies have demonstrated that concentrations of 17-AAG and its active metabolite 17-aminogeldanamycin exceed 300 nm for 16 and 24 h, respectively, after drug administration in the clinical setting (61.Goetz M. Toft D.O. Reid J.M. Ames M.M. Stensgard B. Safgren S. Adjei A.A. Sloan J. Atherton P. Vasile V. Salazaar S. Adjei A.A. Croghan G. Erlichman C. J. Clin. Oncol. 2005; 23: 1078-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). At these concentrations, Chk1 down-regulation is observed in a variety of cell lines (55.Arlander S.J.H. Eapen A.K. Vroman B.T. McDonald R.J. Toft D.O. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52572-52577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) (Figs. 4A and 5, A and D). These observations provide a rationale for further preclinical and possible clinical studies of this combination. Because 17-AAG induces the down-regulation of a variety of Hsp90 clients in addition to Chk1 (67.Isaacs J.S. Xu W. Neckers L. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 213-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 68.Pratt W. Toft D. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar), it is possible that effects on other Hsp90 client proteins contribute to the observed synergy. Previous studies from other laboratories suggested that down-regulation of PDK1 (69.Fujita N. Sato S. Ishida A. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10346-10353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and Akt (70.Basso A.D. Solit D.B. Chiosis G. Giri B. Tsichlis P. Rosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39858-39866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 71.Solit D.B. Basso A.D. Olshen A.B. Scher H.I. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2139-2144PubMed Google Scholar) might contribute to the antiproliferative effects of 17-AAG alone or in drug combinations. In the present study, PDK1 siRNA blocked the activating phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 2D, inset) but did not sensitize cells to SN-38 (Fig. 2D), most likely because inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/PDK1/Akt pathway inhibits the S-phase progression required for the cytotoxic effects of topoisomerase I poisons. These observations suggest that Hsp90 clients contribute differentially to the sensitization observed in Figs. 4 and 5 and further highlight the potential importance of Chk1 down-regulation. Although the results shown in Fig. 2 strongly suggest that Chk1 depletion contributes to the effectiveness of the SN-38/17-AAG combination, additional studies are required to assess the potential role of other Hsp90 clients in this synergy. In summary, the present results highlight the importance of the ATR/Chk1 pathway in survival of cancer cells after treatment with topoisomerase I poisons. In addition, these studies demonstrate that Chk1 down-regulation by siRNA or 17-AAG can sensitize cancer cells to camptothecin derivatives. These observations raise the possibility that inhibition of the ATR/Chk1 pathway might enhance the therapeutic effects of topoisomerase I poisons.

All these results suggest that Bommo-myosuppressin functions as a prothoracicostatic hormone and plays an important role in controlling insect development. In 1922, it was shown that the insect brain secreted a diffusible factor, now known as the prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), 1The abbreviations used are: PTTH, prothoracicotropic hormone; PG, prothoracic gland; PTSP, prothoracicostatic peptide; FaRP, FMRF-amide-related peptide; BMS, Bommo-myosuppressin; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; EST, expressed sequence tag; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; NCC, nervus corporis cardiaci; BMSR, Bommo-myosuppressin receptor. necessary for the induction of larval-pupal metamorphosis (1Kopec S. Biol. Bull. 1922; 42: 323-342Crossref Google Scholar). PTTH stimulates the prothoracic glands (PGs) to synthesize and release ecdysteroids, which directly elicit molting and metamorphosis (2Williams C.M. Biol. Bull. 1947; 93: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 3Ishizaki H. Suzuki A. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 38: 301-310PubMed Google Scholar). It is now widely accepted that the insect brain thus activates the PG, thereby controlling the timing of postembryonic development (4Gilbert L.I. Rybczynski R. Warren J.T. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2002; 47: 883-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Carlisle and Ellis (5Carlisle D.B. Ellis P.E. Nature. 1968; 220: 706-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) demonstrated hormonal inhibition of the PGs by the brain of locusts in 1968. Inhibitory actions of the central nervous system on the PGs have been reported thereafter (6Mala J. Granger N.A. Sehnal F. J. Insect Physiol. 1977; 23: 309-316Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Budd E. Kauser G. Koolman J. Arch. Insect Biochem.

These observations led to our working hypothesis: the brain and other ganglia of the central nervous system exert a prothoracicostatic effect in addition to the tropic effect, thus controlling the complex pattern of the ecdysteroid titer in hemolymph during insect development. In contrast to the extensive studies on PTTH, factors with prothoracicostatic activity have been poorly examined. The prothoracicostatic peptide (PTSP) isolated from larval brains of Bombyx mori is the only cerebral factor elucidated so far to inhibit ecdysteroid synthesis in the PG (9Hua Y.J. Tanaka Y. Nakamura K. Sakakibara M. Nagata S. Kataoka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31169-31173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 10Liu X. Tanaka Y. Song Q. Xu B. Hua Y. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 2004; 56: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This peptide inhibits both the basal and the PTTH-stimulated ecdysteroidogenesis in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, but its physiological role has yet to be demonstrated. In the present study, we purified a novel prothoracicostatic factor from brains of B. mori. The purified factor is a decapeptide with the conserved structure of an insect myosuppressin, which is a member of the FMRFamide-related peptides (FaRPs), and thus named Bommo-myosuppressin (BMS). Moreover its low EC50 value, storage in neurohemal organs, and high expression of its functional receptor in the PG all indicate that BMS plays a role as a prothoracicostatic hormone. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the prothoracicostatic activity of FaRPs, proposing these extensively studied peptides as important candidates for the regulator of insect growth, molting, and metamorphosis. B. mori larvae were fed on the artificial diet “Silkmate” (Nihon Nosan Kogyo, Yokohama, Japan) at 25 °C under a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod and staged after the final (fourth) larval ecdysis. Most larvae started wandering behavior on day 6 of the fifth instar and pupated on day 10. Larvae were anesthetized in water for 10–20 min, and the PGs were dissected rapidly in sterile saline (0.85% NaCl, w/v). The paired glands were first preincubated in 100 μl of Insect Ringer's solution (154.8 mm NaCl, 12.3 mm KCl, 4.0 mm MgCl2, 4.5 mm CaCl2, 2.1 mm NaHCO3, 0.1 mm Na2HPO4, 67.1 mm glucose, 10.0 mm Hepes, pH 6.8) for 30 min after which each gland of the pair was transferred into 100 μl of the same solution containing 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine with or without samples. After 30 min of incubation, cAMP was extracted from each gland in 100 μl of acidified ethanol (0.1% 10 n HCl, v/v) with vigorous shaking at room temperature. For cAMP quantification, the gland extract was dried using a Speed Vac concentrator (GMI, Inc., Albertville, MN) and subsequently dissolved in 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). This solution was directly applied onto a DOCOSIL-B 3-μm column (2.0 × 250 mm, Senshu Kagaku Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) using a Waters 2695 Separations Module (Waters, Milford, MA). The mobile phase was composed of 90% 10 mm ammonium acetate (pH 5.0) and 10% acetonitrile/water (70:30, v/v). Each run was performed in the isocratic mode at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min for 7 min at 40 °C. cAMP was detected by an absorbance at 260 nm using a Waters 996 Photodiode Array Detector and quantified by measuring the peak area in comparison with external standards with Waters Millennium software. The prothoracicostatic activity of a sample was expressed as an inhibition/activation index calculated with the formula: inhibition/activation index = (cAMP content of PG incubated with sample/cAMP content of PG incubated without sample). Approximately 12,000 brains from Bombyx day 0 pupae were extracted in batches of 4,000 brains. Each batch of brains was homogenized in 20 ml of ice-cold 2% NaCl (w/v) with a glass-glass homogenizer, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 9,200 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was pooled, while the pellet was re-extracted three times. The resulting extracts were heated in boiling water for 5 min and cooled rapidly on ice, and then the precipitates were removed by centrifugation at 9,200 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The aqueous solution was acidified with 2.4 ml of 10% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and directly applied to the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification steps. Step 1—The acidified extract was loaded onto a PEGASIL-300 ODS-II column (20 × 150 mm, Senshu Kagaku Co. Ltd.) using a JASCO Gulliver series HPLC system (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). The elution was performed with a linear gradient of 10–60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 40 min at the flow rate of 10 ml/min. Step 2—The active fraction was aliquoted into three batches and applied onto a PEGASIL-300 C4P column (4.6 × 250 mm, Senshu Kagaku Co. Ltd.) using a Waters 2695 Separations Module. The elution was performed with a linear gradient of 10–40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 60 min at the flow rate of 1 ml/min. Step 3—The active fractions of step 2 were loaded onto a PEGASIL-300 ODS-II column (4.6 × 250 mm). The elution was performed with a linear gradient of 10–40% acetonitrile in 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid over 60 min at the flow rate of 1 ml/min. Step 4—The active fraction was further purified by passing over a PEGASIL-300 ODS-II column (4.6 × 250 mm). The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 10–40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 60 min at the flow rate of 1 ml/min. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) and MS/MS were performed using an Applied Biosystems 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid (50:49.9:0.1, v/v/v) was used as the matrix. MS/MS mode was operated without collision gas. DeNovo Explorer software (Applied Biosystems) was used for the sequence analysis. BMS, PTSP, and Manduca sexta F7G (FLRFamide II; GNSFLRF-amide) and F7D (FLRFamide III; DPSFLRFamide) were all custom synthesized and further purified by HPLC. Bombyxin-II was synthesized and purified as described earlier (11Nagata K. Maruyama K. Nagasawa H. Urushibata I. Isogai A. Ishizaki H. Suzuki A. Peptides. 1992; 13: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Recombinant PTTH was prepared as described previously (12Ishibashi J. Kataoka H. Isogai A. Kawakami A. Saegusa H. Yagi Y. Mizoguchi A. Ishizaki H. Suzuki A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5912-5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The PGs were dissected rapidly in sterile saline and preincubated in 100 μl of Grace's Insect Medium (Sigma). After 30 min, the glands were transferred into 100 μl of medium containing various concentrations of samples and further incubated for 3 h. At the end of the incubation, glands were removed, and the remaining medium was diluted with the assay buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% sodium azide in 50 mm borate buffer, pH 8.4) and analyzed using the ecdysteroid radioimmunoassay as described previously (13Mizoguchi A. J. Insect Physiol. 2001; 47: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Since 20-hydroxyecdysone was used as the standard, the secreted ecdysteroid amount was expressed in 20-hydroxyecdysone equivalents. The expressed sequence tag (EST) clone wdV40322 (GenBank™ accession no. AU005976) was obtained from the Bombyx EST project (14Mita K. Morimyo M. Okano K. Koike Y. Nohata J. Kawasaki H. Kadono-Okuda K. Yamamoto K. Suzuki M.G. Shimada T. Goldsmith M.R. Maeda S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14121-14126Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and used as the template for the probe synthesis. Digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes were synthesized using DIG RNA labeling mixture (Roche Applied Science) and T3 or T7 RNA polymerase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers' instructions. For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was extracted from brains of each stage larvae and pupae using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Ten micrograms of total RNA was loaded on each lane of a 1% formaldehyde gel. After transfer to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences), the blots were hybridized to the probe overnight at 68 °C in ULTRAhyb (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). The signal of the hybridized probe was detected using anti-digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) and CDP-Star (Roche Applied Science) according to the supplier's protocol. Imaging was performed with a LAS-1000plus imaging system (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). For in situ hybridization, whole brains were fixed overnight at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Before hybridization, brains were decolorized briefly with a commercially available bleaching solution, stored in methanol for a week at –20 °C, treated with Proteinase K (40 μg/ml) for 20 min, and postfixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. Following a 1-h prehybridization at 50 °C in a solution of 50% formamide, 5× standard saline citrate, 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 50 μg/ml heparin, and 0.1% Tween 20, brains were hybridized overnight at 50 °C with the hydrolyzed probe in the same buffer. The hybridized probe was incubated with anti-digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase and visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-in-dolyl phosphate (Roche Applied Science) and nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. [Cys11]BMS (pEDVVHSFLRFC where pE is pyroglutamate) was synthesized and conjugated with maleimide-activated bovine serum albumin (Pierce). Mice were immunized with the BMS-bovine serum albumin conjugate, splenocytes were fused with NS-I cells, and hybridomas were cultured following the methods described elsewhere (15Mizoguchi A. Oka T. Kataoka H. Nagasawa H. Suzuki A. Ishizaki H. Dev. Growth Differ. 1990; 32: 591-598Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Hybridoma culture supernatants were primarily screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the positive wells were next screened by whole-mount immunohistochemistry. Since BMS gene was expressed in two pairs of medial neurosecretory cells in the brain as demonstrated by in situ hybridization, the antibodies that could label these cells were selected, and the eight hybridomas producing these antibodies were cloned and mass cultured. Monoclonal antibodies in the culture supernatant were purified using a Protein A column, and their binding specificity was further examined by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All the antibodies bound to BMS with varying affinity, but none of them recognized Manduca F7G or F7D at all. Since these three peptides share a common C-terminal amino acid sequence (SFLRFamide), the antibodies were presumed to recognize the N-terminal portion of the BMS. One of the monoclonal antibodies with highest affinity to this peptide was used for the analysis of the projection of BMS-producing neurons by whole-mount immunohistochemistry. Whole-mount immunohistochemistry was performed on the brain and its associated nerves by two methods: fluorescent immunohistochemistry for an overall survey of immunoreactive neurons and peroxidase immunohistochemistry for a detailed analysis of their axonal pathways. For fluorescent immunohistochemistry, dissected blocks of tissues including brain, retrocerebral complex, and foregut were first fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 4 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the tissues were treated with 1% collagenase (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan) in PBS for 1 h, washed with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBS-T) for 30 min, and blocked with 5% normal goat serum in PBS-T for 30 min. The tissues were then successively incubated with anti-BMS mouse monoclonal antibody (1 μg/ml in PBS-T) for 48 h at 4 °C and with 1:500 diluted fluorescent dye-labeled secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG, Invitrogen) overnight at 4 °C. The tissues were cleared in 70% glycerol in PBS before observation. Peroxidase immunohistochemistry was conducted as reported previously (16Roller L. Tanaka Y. Tanaka S. Cell Tissue Res. 2003; 312: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) except for the application of Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) and AEC Substrate Chromogen kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for signal amplification. Approximately 100 PGs of wandering stage larvae were collected, and total RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Construction of the full-length cDNA library, named fprW, was commissioned to Hitachi Instruments Service Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Sequences from the 5′ end of each cDNA were determined, and the ESTs were compiled into a data base. 2N. Yamanaka, T. Namiki, K. Watanabe, R. Niwa, K. Mita, and H. Kataoka, unpublished. Standard BLAST analysis was performed on the data base to obtain the homologues of Drosophila myosuppressin receptors. The amino acid sequence coded by the polymorphic clones fprWP14_F_K14 and fprWP14_F_P21 (GenBank™ accession numbers AB188256 and AB188257) and the related Drosophila G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) sequences were submitted to the program ClustalW (www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/search/clustalw-j.html) for phylogenetic analysis. For reverse transcription-PCR analysis, cDNAs from various tissues were synthesized as described previously (17Niwa R. Matsuda T. Yoshiyama T. Namiki T. Mita K. Fujimoto Y. Kataoka H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35942-35949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and primers (sense primer, 5′-TAATTCGATCCTGACTGGGCTCGCCG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-TGACTGTTGTGAGTGGCTCCCTCTCC-3′), which can amplify both the polymorphic transcripts, were used. RpL3 was used as a loading control as described previously (18Matsuoka T. Fujiwara H. Dev. Genes Evol. 2000; 210: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thirty cycles (95 °C for 10 s and 68 °C for 1 min) were carried out for the amplification. The open reading frame of the BMS receptor was amplified by PCR performed on the EST clone fprWP14_F_K14. The specific primers had the following sequences: sense primer, 5′-GCAGAATTCGCCACCATGTCGGAAGACG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-GTCCTCGAGCTACGAAACAGTGACTG-3′. The sense primer incorporates an EcoRI restriction site and the Kozak sequence (“GCCACC”) (19Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar), while the antisense primer contains an XhoI restriction site. The obtained product was cloned into the pME18S mammalian expression vector and transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells with the promiscuous G protein Gα15 as described earlier (20Katada S. Nakagawa T. Kataoka H. Touhara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Ca2+ imaging analysis was performed as reported previously (20Katada S. Nakagawa T. Kataoka H. Touhara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Purification of the Prothoracicostatic Factor—As a bioassay system to evaluate the prothoracicostatic activity of the brain extracts, we developed a cAMP assay combining in vitro PG incubation and subsequent cAMP quantification because cAMP is a prerequisite second messenger for ecdysteroidogenesis (4Gilbert L.I. Rybczynski R. Warren J.T. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2002; 47: 883-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Day 4 fifth instar larvae were used in this assay. Starting from an extract of 12,000 brains from Bombyx day 0 pupae, four steps of HPLC separation were required to purify the prothoracicostatic factor as a homogeneous peak (Fig. 1). In the first step, the single fraction designated with a bar in Fig. 1 showed strong prothoracicostatic activity (inhibition/activation index = 0.13) when 10 brain equivalents per PG was applied to the assay. In the subsequent three steps, 10 brain equivalents per PG of the active fractions always suppressed the glandular cAMP level almost completely (inhibition/activation index = 0–0.13, data not shown). Identification of the Prothoracicostatic Factor as Bombyx Myosuppressin—An aliquot of the isolated fraction was subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis, and a single monoisotopic mass of 1229.7 ([M + H]+) was obtained. Further analysis of this putative peptide with MS/MS gave the sequence pEDVVHSF(L/I)RFamide (Fig. 2A). Since the sequence pEDVVHSFLRFamide was identical to Manduca FLRFamide I (21Lu D. Lee K.Y. Horodyski F.M. Witten J.L. J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 446: 377-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the cDNA sequence of the Manduca peptide was submitted to BLAST analysis using the Bombyx EST data base, named SilkBase (papilio.ab.a.u-tokyo.ac.jp/silkbase), which found a cDNA clone, wdV40322. This clone revealed an open reading frame encoding a 98-residue peptide with a putative signal peptide and the prohormone sequence containing the mature decapeptide flanked by dibasic residues (KR and RR, Fig. 2C). From the deduced amino acid sequence of this cDNA clone, the sequence of the purified peptide was determined to be pEDVVHSFLRFamide, and the synthetic peptide was prepared. The MS/MS profiles and the HPLC elution times of the purified peptide and the synthetic peptide were completely identical (Fig. 2, A and B, and data not shown). Since this peptide had the conserved structure of an insect myosuppressin (X1DVX2HX3FLRFamide) (22Nichols R. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2003; 48: 485-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we named this peptide BMS. BMS Has a Higher Prothoracicostatic Activity than PTSP— To compare the inhibitory activity of BMS and PTSP on larval PGs, various concentrations of these peptides were subjected to the cAMP assay and the ecdysone assay in the presence or absence of 10–9m PTTH (Fig. 3). Only day 4 fifth instar larvae were used in this assay because day 4 larval PGs responded well to PTTH, making it easier than any other stages to assay the prothoracicostatic activities both in the basal and the PTTH-stimulated conditions. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, BMS inhibited both the basal and the PTTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation in the PGs in a dose-dependent manner with much lower EC50 values (concentrations that produced 50% of the highest inhibitory activity) than PTSP (0.039 or 0.089 nm for BMS and 54 or 105 nm for PTSP with or without PTTH, respectively). Two relevant Manduca FaRPs (F7G and F7D) also suppressed the glandular cAMP level at higher concentrations than BMS. In the ecdysone assay, BMS inhibited ecdysteroidogenesis in a statistically significant level at around 10–9m, again much lower concentrations than the EC50 value of PTSP. Interestingly higher concentrations of BMS rather reduced the inhibitory activity both on the basal and the PTTH-stimulated PGs, inconsistent with the result of the cAMP assay (Fig. 3, C and D). BMS Inhibits Ecdysteroidogenesis via a Different Pathway from PTTH or PTSP—To elucidate the modes of action of BMS and PTSP, their inhibitory activities on ecdysteroidogenesis in the presence of PTTH were further compared (Fig. 4). First the EC50 value of PTTH in the ecdysone assay using day 4 fifth instar PGs was determined to be 2.8 pm, consistent with prior results (23Kiriishi S. Nagasawa H. Kataoka H. Suzuki A. Sakurai S. Zoolog. Sci. 1992; 9: 149-155Google Scholar). Addition of 10–9m BMS or 10–7m PTSP suppressed the amount of ecdysteroid secreted at various concentrations of PTTH, but the EC50 values of PTTH in the presence of these prothoracicostatic factors remained constant (2.5 and 3.8 pm, respectively; Fig. 4A). This result, that both BMS and PTSP inhibit the PTTH-stimulated ecdysteroidogenesis in noncompetitive manners, indicates the existence of receptors for these peptides different from the PTTH receptor. The additive effect of BMS and PTSP in the presence of 10–9 m PTTH was examined in Fig. 4B. BMS always had an “optimal” concentration for the inhibition of PTTH-stimulated PGs at around 10–9m irrespective of the concentrations of coexisting PTSP. Moreover PTSP dose dependently inhibited ecdysteroidogenesis even in the presence of 10–7m BMS, which is above the optimal concentrations. This result demonstrates that BMS regulates the PG activity via a different receptor from PTSP. BMS Is Produced in the Neurosecretory Cells of the Brain— The expression pattern of BMS in the brain was determined by Northern blot and in situ hybridization. Northern blot analysis revealed that BMS was expressed throughout the fifth larval instar to the 1st day of the pupal stage but was higher in the early half of the fifth instar (Fig. 5A). Further analysis with whole-mount in situ hybridization on day 3 fifth instar brains showed that BMS was mainly expressed in two pairs of medial neurosecretory cells (Fig. 5, B and C). To clarify the axonal projection of these neurosecretory cells, whole-mount immunohistochemistry was performed on the brain and its associated nerves from the same stage using an antibody that reacts specifically with BMS. This analysis further confirmed the existence of BMS in the medial neurosecretory cells (Fig. 5D). Several pairs of small neurons were also stained in the brain, although their signals were relatively weak, and they did not project to peripheral targets. The medial neurosecretory cells projected contralaterally (Fig. 5, D and E) into the corpora cardiaca, one of the well established neurohemal organs, via nervus corporis cardiaci (NCC) 1 + 2 (Fig. 5F; terminology according to Ref. 24Ichikawa T. Hasegawa K. Shimizu I. Katsuno K. Kataoka H. Suzuki A. Zoolog. Sci. 1995; 12: 703-712Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The strong immunoreactivity of the corpora cardiaca indicates the storage of BMS in these organs. Strong immunoreactive fibers were also found in NCC-recurrens (Fig. 5F). Weak immunoreactivity was also detected in NCC-ventralis (Fig. 5F) and the node (data not shown). In some preparations, fibers running on the corpora allata were also stained weakly, but no immunoreactive materials were observed in the corpora allata. These results suggest that BMS is produced in the two pairs of neurosecretory cells of the brain and released into the hemolymph from the corpora cardiaca and/or NCC-recurrens. Double staining analyses using antibodies against BMS and other cerebral peptides (PTSP, diuretic hormone, and bombyxin) were performed, but no coexistence of any pair of these peptides was detected (data not shown). Identification of the Functional BMS Receptor in PGs—All the above results indicate that the BMS released from the neurosecretory cells inhibits ecdysteroidogenesis via a specific BMS receptor in the PGs. To find this putative receptor, we constructed a full-length cDNA library from the PGs of wandering stage larvae, sequenced the 5′ end of each cDNA, and compiled a local data base. Standard BLAST analysis of Drosophila myosuppressin receptors (DmsR-1 and -2) (25Egerod K. Reynisson E. Hauser F. Cazzamali G. Williamson M. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9808-9813Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) using this EST data base showed that two clones (fprWP14_F_K14 and fprWP14_F_P21) share high sequence similarities with DmsR-1 and -2. Full sequencing of these clones revealed that they coded an identical predicted protein with seven putative transmembrane domains, indicating that these polymorphic genes code a GPCR for BMS (BMS receptor (BMSR)). Phylogenetic analysis of BMSR and related Drosophila GPCR sequences (reported in Ref. 26Hewes R.S. Taghert P.H. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1126-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) showed that DMSR-1 and -2 are the most closely related GPCRs of BMSR (Fig. 6A). BMSR expression in various tissues of wandering stage larvae was examined by reverse transcription-PCR. As we expected, BMSR was highly expressed in the PG (Fig. 6B). Functional characterization of BMSR was performed using a heterologous expression system. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing both BMSR and Gα15 responded to BMS dose dependently in the Ca2+ imaging analysis, demonstrating this GPCR to be a functional BMS receptor (Fig. 6, C and D). No other peptides tested at concentrations up to 10 μm (PTTH, PTSP, and bombyxin-II) activated BMSR except the two Manduca FaRPs (F7D and F7G). These two peptides, which share the common amino acid sequence at the C termini with BMS, activated BMSR weakly but dose dependently, suggesting that the C-terminal structure of BMS is recognized by BMSR. The relative EC50 values of these three FaRPs in this assay corresponded well to those in the cAMP assay (Fig. 3A). In this study, we purified and identified Bombyx myosuppressin as a novel prothoracicostatic factor. Insect myosuppressins have been isolated from cockroaches, locusts, flies, and moths, and they are now thought to occur in all insects (22Nichols R. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2003; 48: 485-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 27Holman G.M. Cook B.J. Nachman R.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C. 1986; 85: 329-333Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 28Robb S.

Hunt D.F. Peptides. 1990; 11: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As can be anticipated from their name, myosuppressins show inhibitory activities on various kinds of visceral muscles including gut, heart, oviduct, Malpighian tubule, and salivary gland (28Robb S. Packman L.C. Evans P.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 850-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 31Lange A.B. Orchard I.

Myosuppressin is a member of a larger peptide family, FaRPs, which are known to regulate a wide range of processes from behavior to physiology in invertebrates (22Nichols R. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2003; 48: 485-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 35Nelson L.S. Rosoff M.L. Li C. Science. 1998; 281: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 36Mackey S.L. Glanzman D.L. Small S.A. Dyke A.M. Kandel E.R. Hawkins R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8730-8734Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, these FaRPs including myosuppressins have never been shown to regulate invertebrate development by affecting steroid hormone secretion. Our report thus proposes these extensively studied peptides as important candidates for regulators of invertebrate development, which is a potential target for the development of effective pest management tools. Using two in vitro bioassays (cAMP assay and ecdysone assay), we demonstrated that BMS suppressed the PGs with much lower effective concentrations than PTSP. However, higher concentrations of BMS rather reduced this inhibitory activity in the ecdysone assay, inconsistent with the cAMP assay (Fig. 3). This discrepancy is not the result of the inactivation of the BMS receptor during the longer incubation in the ecdysone assay (3 h) than in the cAMP assay (30 min) because the cAMP level in the PGs remained low even after the 3-h incubation with higher concentrations of BMS (data not shown). If this phenomenon has any physiological importance, it is intriguing to speculate that BMS has different effects on the PG via different second messenger pathways, depending on its concentrations in hemolymph. We are now investigating these putative second messengers other than cAMP that are activated by higher concentrations of BMS (Ca2+, for example, has been shown to play another important role in ecdysteroidogenesis) (4Gilbert L.I. Rybczynski R. Warren J.T. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2002; 47: 883-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Its low effective concentration and storage in the corpora cardiaca and NCC-recurrens suggest that BMS functions as a hormone during insect development. The expression profile of BMS in the brain during the fifth instar (Fig. 5A) suggests that BMS is mainly produced and secreted in the feeding period during which the PGs are inactivated and thus the ecdysteroid titer is low (37Gu S.H. Chow Y.S. J. Insect Physiol. 1996; 42: 625-632Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 38Sakurai S. Kaya M. Satake S. J. Insect Physiol. 1998; 44: 867-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Since we have detected the existence of BMS in larval hemolymph by a method combining separation with HPLC and quantification by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown), measurement of the developmental changes of the BMS titer in hemolymph will give important information on the timing when BMS acts on PGs. In this study, we have also identified and characterized a receptor specific for BMS. BMSR was expressed not only in the PG but in some other tissues including midgut, hindgut, and Malpighian tubule (Fig. 6B). Since myosuppressin actions on these tissues except the PG have been documented in other insects (27Holman G.M. Cook B.J. Nachman R.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C. 1986; 85: 329-333Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 31Lange A.B. Orchard I. Peptides. 1998; 19: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 33Coast G.M. Peptides. 1998; 19: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), this result indicates that BMS also works as a multifunctional hormone in B. mori. The EC50 value of BMS determined using the heterologous expression system (32 nm) was higher than that in the cAMP assay (0.089 nm). This discrepancy, however, may be attributed to the relatively low sensitivity of the heterologous expression system because the EC50 value compares well with the concentration reported for the two Drosophila myosuppressin receptors (40 nm), determined using a similar heterologous expression system (25Egerod K. Reynisson E. Hauser F. Cazzamali G. Williamson M. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9808-9813Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore we found two additional ligands that weakly activate BMSR. Since the relative EC50 values of these three ligands in the Ca2+ imaging analysis (Fig. 6D) compares well with the cAMP assay (Fig. 3A), we can see that this receptor actually mediates the inhibitory activity of BMS on the PGs. Vertebrates including humans have also been shown to possess peptides with an RFamide C terminus (39Yang H.Y. Fratta W. Majane E.A. Costa E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7757-7761Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 40Hinuma S. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kawamata Y. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kitada C. Masuo Y. Asano T. Matsumoto H. Sekiguchi M. Kurokawa T. Nishimura O. Onda H. Fujino M. Nature. 1998; 393: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), and at least one RFamide peptide has been shown to inhibit steroid hormone release in experiments using an in vitro adrenal slice culture system (41Labrouche S. Laulin J.P. Le Moal M. Tramu G. Simonnet G. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1998; 10: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Considering the conservation of RFamide peptides throughout metazoans, our result also indicates that RFamide peptides modulate steroid hormone secretion in various kinds of species, thereby controlling their postembryonic development.

However, the mechanism for ASK1 activation is not fully understood. We have recently identified ASK1-interacting protein (AIP1) as novel signal transducer in TNFα-induced ASK1 activation by facilitating dissociation of ASK1 from its inhibitor 14-3-3. In the present study, we employed yeast two-hybrid system using the N-terminal domain of AIP1 as bait and identified homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 1 (HIPK1) as an AIP1-associated protein. Interestingly, we showed that TNFα induced HIPK1 desumoylation concomitant with a translocation from nucleus to cytoplasm at 15 min followed by a return to nucleus by 60 min. The kinetics of HIPK1 translocation correlates with those of stress-induced ASK1-JNK/P38 activation. A specific JNK inhibitor blocked the reverse but not the initial translocation of HIPK1, suggesting that the initial translocation is an upstream event of ASK1-JNK/p38 signaling and JNK activation regulates the reverse translocation as a feedback mechanism. Consistently, expression of HIPK1 increased, whereas expression of a kinase-inactive form (HIPK1-D315N) or small interference RNA of HIPK1 decreased stress-induced ASK1-JNK/P38 activation without effects on IKK-NF-κB signaling. Moreover, a sumoylation-defective mutant of HIPK1 (KR5) localizes to the cytoplasm and is constitutively active in ASK1-JNK/P38 activation. Furthermore, HIPK1-KR5 induces dissociation of ASK1 from its inhibitors 14-3-3 and thioredoxin and synergizes with AIP1 to induce ASK1 activation.

ASK1 can be activated in response to diverse stresses including proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, reactive oxygen species (ROS), death receptor Fas, disruption of microtubule structures, protein aggregation in endoplasmic reticulum, and genotoxic stress from nucleus (2Ichijo H.

ASK1 is a 170-kDa protein that functionally is composed of an inhibitory N-terminal domain, an internal kinase domain, and a C-terminal regulatory domain. The mechanism by which stress stimuli activate ASK1 is not fully understood. Several cellular factors including thioredoxin (Trx), glutaredoxin, and 14-3-3 have been reported to interacts with different ASK1 domains and inhibit ASK1 activity (6Liu Y. Yin G. Surapisitchat J.

The C-terminal domain of ASK1 binds to TNFα receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), and this association is required for ASK1 activation by TNFα (3Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 13Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Dissociation from Trx is required for ASK1 binding to TRAF2, which in turn induces ASK1 oligomerization. ASK1 oligomerization leads to autophosphorylation of ASK1 at Thr-845 within the activation loop in the kinase domain (11Liu H. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2198-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 14Tobiume K. Saitoh M. Ichijo H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Activated ASK1 subsequently recruits and activates its downstream targets mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK3/7 and MKK4/7) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (JNK and p38). Thus, ASK1 activation appears to involve several sequential steps including release of cellular inhibitors such as Trx, glutaredoxin, glutathione S-transferase Mu, heat shock proteins, and 14-3-3; ASK1 oligomerization/autophosphorylation at Thr-845; and scaffold protein-mediated association of ASK1 with downstream MKK and JNK. The release of Trx and 14-3-3 from ASK1 appears to be a critical step in ASK1 activation. Trx (cytosolic Trx1and mitochondria Trx2) in a reduced form binds to the N-terminal domain of ASK1, whereas 14-3-3 binds to the C-terminal domain of ASK1 via phosphoserine 967 to maintain ASK1 in an inactive state. Because the oxidized form (intramolecular disulfide between Cys-32 and Cys-35) nor the redox-inactive form (the double mutation at catalytic sites Cys-32 and Cys-35) of Trx binds to ASK1 (7Liu Y.

Min W. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 15Zhang R. Al-Lamki R. Bai L. Streb J.W. Miano J.M. Bradley J. Min W. Circ.

Phosphoserine-binding protein 14-3-3 associates with ASK1 via its Ser(P)-967, which is basally phosphorylated. In response to TNFα/ROS, ASK1 is dephosphorylated at Ser-967 leading to release of 14-3-3. The phosphate(s) responsible for dephosphorylation of ASK1 at Ser(P)-967 has not been identified, although a protein phosphatase 2A -like enzyme has been proposed (16Goldman E.H. Chen L. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; Google Scholar). We have recently identified a novel ASK1-interacting protein (AIP1) that plays a critical role in 14-3-3 release and ASK1-JNK activation by TNFα/ROS (17Zhang R. He X. Liu W. Lu M. Hsieh J.T. Min W. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). AIP1, a new member of Ras-GAP protein family, via its protein kinase C-conserved (C2) domain binds to a sequence surrounding the 14-3-3-binding site (Ser(P)-967) on ASK1 but preferentially to a dephosphorylated active form of ASK1. More importantly, AIP1 facilitates dissociation of 14-3-3 from ASK1 leading to an enhanced ASK1 activity (17Zhang R. He X. Liu W. Lu M. Hsieh J.T. Min W. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, how AIP1 facilitates release of 14-3-3 from ASK1 is not known. SUMO is a ubiquitin-like protein that can be covalently attached to a large number of proteins through the formation of isopeptide bonds with specific lysine residues of target proteins (18Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 19Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2922) Google Scholar). A large number of sumoylated proteins, including Ran-GAP1, PML, IκB, p53, c-Jun, Sp3, Elk-1, p300, and many nuclear receptors, have been identified (18Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S.

Sumoylation is a dynamic process that is mediated by activating, conjugating, and ligating enzymes and that is readily reversed by a family of SUMO-specific proteases (20Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Several members of SUMO-specific proteases have been reported in the mammalian system (21Gong L. Millas S. Maul G.G. Yeh E.T.

Different members of these SUMO-specific proteases appear to localize in different cellular compartments where they regulate protein function by modifying the protein stability, cellular localization, and protein-protein interactions (21Gong L.

Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 1 (HIPK1) is one of three closely related serine/threonine protein kinases that regulate the activity of a broad range of transcription factors (28Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Lee S.J. Conti M.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25875-25879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The HIPKs were originally identified as nuclear protein kinases that function as co-repressors for various homeodomain-containing transcription factors (28Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Lee S.J. Conti M.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25875-25879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Recently the growth inhibitory and tumor suppressor functions for HIPK1 and HIPK2 have been extensively studied. HIPK1 and HIPK2 appear to act cooperatively with the tumor suppressor protein p53. Further studies indicate that HIPK2 phosphorylates p53 on Ser-46, resulting in activation of p53-dependent transcription, cell growth regulation, and apoptosis initiation (29Hofmann T.G. Moller A. Sirma H. Zentgraf H. Taya Y. Droge W. Will H. Schmitz M.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 30D'Orazi G. Cecchinelli B. Bruno T. Manni I. Higashimoto Y.

However, the study from HIPK1–/– mice appears to support that HIPK1 functions as an oncogene because the mice develop few tumors than HIPK1+/+ mice (31Kondo S. Lu Y. Debbas M. Lin A.W. Sarosi I. Itie A. Wakeham A. Tuan J. Saris C. Elliott G. Ma W. Benchimol S. Lowe S.W. Mak T.W. Thukral S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5431-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). HIPKs have been shown to interact with other proteins involved in apoptosis and signal transduction in a cellular localization-dependent manner. In the nucleus, HIPK2 can promote apoptosis by down-regulating the transcriptional co-repressor CtBP (32Zhang Q. Yoshimatsu Y. Hildebrand J. Frisch S.M. Goodman R.H. Cell. 2003; 115: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In cytoplasm, HIPK1, HIPK2, and HIPK3 appear to transduce signals by death receptors through interaction with TRADD and FADD (33Li X. Wang Y. Debatin K.M. Hug H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 34Rochat-Steiner V. Becker K. Micheau O. Schneider P. Burns K. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, HIPKs are primarily localized in the nucleus where it is sumoylated (35Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Kim Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12350-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 36Ecsedy J.A. Michaelson J.S. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 950-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that HIPK translocation from nucleus to cytoplasm is involved in TNFα/Fas signaling. In the present study, we identified HIPK1 as an AIP1/ASK1-associated protein. In resting endothelial cells (EC), HIPK1, AIP1, and ASK1 are primarily localized in the nucleus, plasma membrane, and cytoplasm, respectively. TNFα induces desumoylation of HIPK1 concomitant translocation to cytoplasm where it associates with the AIP1-ASK1 complex to induce the release of Trx and 14-3-3 from ASK1. Our study suggests that HIPK1 is novel signal transducer in TNFα-induced ASK1-JNK/p38 activation. Plasmid Construction—Expression plasmids for Daxx was generously provided by Dr. Jacques Landry, Université Laval, Quebec, Canada), and SUMO was from Dr. Ronald T. Hay (University of St. Andrews, St. Andrews, Scotland, UK). Expression plasmids for ASK1 and AIP were described previously (6Liu Y. Yin G. Surapisitchat J. Berk B.C. Min W. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 17Zhang R. He X. Liu W. Lu M. Hsieh J.T. Min W. J. Clin.

For yeast expression plasmid, AIP1-N was amplified by PCR using a 5′ primer with an NdeI site and a3′ primer with SalI. The PCR product was inserted into the NdeI and SalI sites of the expression vector pGBKT7 (Clontech) to generate pGBKT-AIP1 in which AIP1 was fused in-frame with the DNA-binding domain of yeast transcriptional activator GAL4. The expression plasmids for GFP-tagged and Myc-tagged HIPK1 were generated by inserting mouse HIPK1 cDNA into pEGFP-C2 and pCS3+MTBX, respectively, as described previously for HIPK2 (28Kim Y.H.

The mutant HIPK1 (KR and D315N) were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Antibodies—A rabbit polyclonal antibody against phospho-specific antibodies against phospho-ASK1 (Ser(P)-967 and Thr(P)-845) and phospho-p38 from Cell Signaling, phospho-JNK from Bioresources. We obtained anti-ASK1 (H300), anti-p38, anti-Myc, anti-SUMO, and anti-IκBα from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-hemagglutinin was from Roche Applied Science, and anti-FLAG was from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against AIP1 and HIPK1 were generated in our laboratories. Cells, Cytokines, and Inhibitors—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and bovine aortic EC (BAEC) and were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). HUVEC were cultured in modified M199 culture medium containing 20% (v/v) heat-inactivated bovine fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml heparin sodium salt, 30 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement, 2 mm l-glutamine, 60 units/ml penicillin, and 0.5 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C, in 5% CO2 on gelatin-coated tissue culture plastic. The cells were used at passages 2–4. Human recombinant TNFα was from R & D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN) and used at 10 ng/ml. Chemical inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—AIP1-N bait was used to screen a pretransformed human heart cDNA library (Clontech). The yeast two-hybrid screening was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Clontech). In brief, the yeast strain AH109 harboring pGBKT7-AIP1 was mated with Y190 harboring a human heart cDNA library. Mating zygotes were selected on synthetic dropout agar plates lacking Trp, Leu, His, and Ade (QDO). Yeast colonies were transferred onto a nylon membrane and processed by the β-galactosidase filter assay. Plasmids from positive colonies were isolated and retransformed into the yeast strain Y190 with either pGBKT7 or pGBKT7-AIP1-N to confirm that growth on QDO and β-galactosidase was AIP1-N-dependent. The cDNA inserts from true positive clones were subjected to DNA sequencing with a dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Keck Facility at Yale). JNK and ASK1 Kinase Assays—A JNK assay was performed as described previously (6Liu Y. Yin G. Surapisitchat J. Berk B.C. Min W. J. Clin.

ASK1 assay was performed using glutathione S-transferase-MKK4 as a substrate. Transfection and Reporter Assay—Transfection of HUVEC was performed by the DEAE-dextran method as described (6Liu Y.

Luciferase activity followed by Renilla activity was measured twice in duplicate using a Berthold luminometer. All of the data were normalized as relative luciferase light units/Renilla unit. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—HUVEC or BAEC after various treatments were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1.5 ml of cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.75% Brij 96, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA) for 20 min on ice. For immunoprecipitation to analyze protein interaction in vivo, supernatant of cell lysates were precleared by incubating with normal rabbit serum plus GammaBind plus Sepharose beads on rotator at 4 °C overnight. The lysates were then incubated with the first protein-specific antiserum (e.g. HIPK1) for 2 h with 50 μl of GammaBind plus Sepharose. Immune complexes were collected after each immunoprecipitation by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min followed by three to five washes with lysis buffer. The immune complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot with the second protein (e.g. ASK1)-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The chemiluminescence was detected using an ECL kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). For detection of FLAG-tagged proteins (AIP1), hemagglutinin-tagged proteins (wild type ASK1), and Myc-tagged proteins (HIPK1), anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), anti-hemagglutinin antibody, and anti-Myc (Roche Applied Science) were used for immunoblotting, respectively. Indirect Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy—Fixation, permeabilization, and staining of cultured EC were performed as described previously (37Zhang H. Zhang R. Luo Y. D'Alessio A. Pober J.S. Min W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44955-44965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Alexa Fluor 488 (green) or 594 (red) conjugated-secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy was performed using an Olympus confocal microscope, and the acquired images were transferred to Photoshop 6.0 to generate the final figures. RNAi Constructs for HIPK1—The sequences of the oligonucleotides used to create pSh-HIPK1 are: HIPK1-A-455, GTT GCT GTA GCG GCG CTG CCT GAG CTA TGA AGC TTG ATA GTT CGG GCA GTG CCG CTA CAG CGA CCT TTT TTT T; HIPK1-B-455, GAT CAA AAA AAA GGT CGC TGT AGC GGC ACT GCC CGA ACT ATC AAG CTT CAT AGC TCA GGC AGC GCC GCT ACA GCA ACC G; HIPK1-A-1146, TTG GCG AAC TGG ATC GAC TAG CAT TAT GGA AGC TTG CGT AGT GTT AGT CGA TCC AGT TCG CTA ACC CTT TTT T; and HIPK1-B-1146, GAT CAA AAA AGG GTT AGC GAA CTG GAT CGA CTA ACA CTA CGC AAG CTT CCA TAA TGC TAG TCG ATC CAG TTC GCC AAC G. The oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into pShag vector (38Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Bernstein E. Hannon G.J. Conklin D.S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Expression of short hairpin RNA for HIPK1 is under the control of the U6 promoter. HIPK1 Is Translocated from Nucleus to Cytoplasm in Response to TNFα—We have recently identified a novel Ras-GAP as an ASK1-interacting protein (AIP1, also called DAB2-interactin protein). In response to TNFα, AIP1 binds to ASK1 and facilitates 14-3-3 dissociation from ASK1 leading to ASK1-JNK activation (17Zhang R. He X. Liu W. Lu M. Hsieh J.T. Min W. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To identify additional proteins involved in this process, we used AIP1 as bait in yeast two-hybrid and identified HIPK1 as a potential AIP1-interacting protein. The HIPK1-AIP1 interaction was also seen in EC overexpressing these molecules (see Fig. 5). However, HIPK1 is localized in the nucleus, whereas AIP1-ASK1 is in the cytoplasm in resting EC. We reasoned that HIPK1 might be translocated from nucleus to cytoplasm in response to TNFα to associate with cytoplasmic protein AIP1-ASK1 complex. To test this hypothesis, BAEC were transfected with GFP-HIPK1, and the cells were treated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 15–60 min. Localization of GFP-HIPK1 was visualized by fluorescence microscopy, and the nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. HIPK1 is localized in nucleus of resting cells. However, HIPK1 is translocated to cytoplasm upon TNFα treatment for 15 min. Interestingly, HIPK1 shuttled back to nucleus by 60 min (Fig. 1a). To determine whether HIPK1 translocation is specific, we compared HIPK1 with Daxx, a nuclear protein implicated in Fas-induced ASK1-JNK signaling. BAEC were co-transfected with HIPK1 (Myc-tagged) and Daxx followed by treatment with TNFα (10 ng/ml for 15 min). Localization of HIPK1 and Daxx were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-Myc antibody (for HIPK1) and anti-Daxx followed by Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse and Alexa 594-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. In resting cells, both HIPK1 and Daxx were localized in the nucleus. However, TNFα induced a cytoplasmic translocation of HIPK1 but not of Daxx (Fig. 1b). In contrast, Daxx is not translocated in response to TNFα (Fig. 1b).Fig. 1HIPK1 is translocated from nucleus to cytoplasm in response to TNFα. a, HIPK1 cytoplasmic translocation in response to TNFα. BAEC were transfected with GFP-HIPK1 and treated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 0 (Ctrl), 15, and 60 min. Localization of GFP-HIPK1 was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. b, Daxx is not translocated in response to TNFα. Myc-HIPK1 and Daxx were co-transfected into BAEC followed by treatment with TNFα (10 ng/ml). HIPK1 and Daxx were detected by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody (for HIPK1) and anti-Daxx rabbit polyclonal antibody followed by Alexa 488-conjugated (green) anti-mouse and Alexa 594-conjugated (red) anti-rabbit second antibodies.View Large Image F"
https://openalex.org/W2129487015,"Here we describe mass spectrometric identification, molecular cloning, and biochemical characterization of a lipid/membrane raft-associated protein that is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon Xenopus egg fertilization. This protein is homologous to mammalian uroplakin III, a member of the uroplakin family proteins (UPs) that constitute asymmetric unit membranes in the mammalian urothelial tissues, thus termed Xenopus uroplakin III (xUPIII). xUPIII contains N-linked sugars and is highly expressed in Xenopus eggs, ovary, urinary tract, and kidney. In unfertilized eggs, xUPIII is predominantly localized to the lipid/membrane rafts and exposed on the cell surface, as judged by surface biotinylation experiments and indirect immunofluorescent studies. After fertilization or hydrogen peroxide-induced egg activation, xUPIII becomes rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residue-249, which locates in the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the molecule. Raft localization and tyrosine phosphorylation of xUPIII can be reconstituted in HEK293 cells by coexpression of xUPIII, and Xenopus c-Src, a tyrosine kinase whose fertilization-induced activation in egg rafts is required for initiation of development. In mammals, UPIII is forming a complex with a tetraspanin molecule uroplakin Ib. As another tetraspanin, CD9, is known to be a critical component for sperm-egg fusion in the mouse, we have assumed that xUPIII is involved in sperm-egg interaction. An antibody against the extracellular domain of xUPIII blocks sperm-egg interaction, as judged by the occurrence of egg activation and first cell cleavage. Thus, xUPIII represents an egg raft-associated protein that is likely involved in sperm-egg interaction as well as subsequent Src-dependent intracellular events of egg activation in Xenopus.

We have previously shown that fertilization in Xenopus laevis involves activation of an egg-associated tyrosine kinase Src, the ubiquitous expression and multiple functions of which in normal cells have been well documented (12Abram C.L. Courtneidge S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 13Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

The Src activation occurs within 1 min of insemination, and the active Src interacts with, phosphorylates, and activates PLCγ (15Sato K. Tokmakov A.A. Iwasaki T. Fukami Y. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 453-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 16Sato K. Iwao Y. Fujimura T. Tamaki I. Ogawa K. Iwasaki T. Tokmakov A.A. Hatano O. Fukami Y. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 308-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Pharmacological experiments using specific inhibitors in the intact egg system as well as immunodepletion experiments in cell-free systems demonstrate that Src-dependent PLCγ activation is required for many features of egg activation: a transient calcium release, inactivation of cytostatic factor, and resumption of meiosis II (15Sato K. Tokmakov A.A. Iwasaki T. Fukami Y. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 453-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 17Sato K. Iwasaki T. Tamaki I. Aoto M. Tokmakov A.A. Fukami Y.

Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). On the other hand, artificial activation of Src by using hydrogen peroxide in both intact eggs and cell-free systems promotes events of egg activation as noted above (19Tokmakov A.A. Sato K. Iwasaki T. Fukami Y. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Sato K. Ogawa K. Tokmakov A.A. Iwasaki T. Fukami Y. Dev. Growth Differ. 2001; 43: 55-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These indicate that Src activation is sufficient for egg activation in Xenopus. Further analysis has been directed to analyze molecular mechanism related to sperm-induced activation of Src, and we have found that Src is enriched in the egg lipid/membrane rafts and that sperm activate the raft-associated Src in vivo and in vitro (18Sato K. Tokmakov A.A. He C.-L. Kurokawa M. Iwasaki T. Shirouzu M. Fissore R.A. Yokoyama S. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38413-38420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Sato K. Iwasaki T. Ogawa K. Konishi M. Tokmakov A.A. Fukami Y. Development. 2002; 129: 885-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid/membrane rafts, also called low density, detergent-insoluble membranes or detergent-resistant membranes, are kinds of microdomains in the plasma membrane and are thought to facilitate signal transduction by cell surface receptors (22Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar, 23Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar, 24Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7948) Google Scholar). Rafts are known to contain various types of transmembrane and/or signaling molecules. The dynamic arrangement and functional importance of rafts have been described in several cell systems such as lymphocytes (25Harder T. Engelhardt K.R. Traffic. 2004; 5: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), neuronal cells (26Maekawa S. Iino S. Miyata S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1610: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and platelets (27Bodin S. Tronchere H. Payrastre B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1610: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Localization of Src in egg rafts would be important for eliciting sperm-induced egg activation signaling. In fact, we have shown that sperm can activate Src in the isolated rafts prepared from unfertilized eggs (18Sato K. Tokmakov A.A. He C.-L. Kurokawa M. Iwasaki T. Shirouzu M. Fissore R.A. Yokoyama S. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38413-38420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Sato K. Iwasaki T. Ogawa K. Konishi M. Tokmakov A.A. Fukami Y. Development. 2002; 129: 885-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results suggest that the raft fractions contain a molecule(s) that can transmit sperm-binding signal to the machinery for Src activation. In the present study, we demonstrate that a 30-kDa egg raft-associated protein is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues after fertilization or hydrogen peroxide treatment of Xenopus eggs. Peptide mass fingerprinting and product ion mass fingerprinting show that the phosphorylated protein is a Xenopus homologue of uroplakin III, termed Xenopus uroplakin III (xUPIII). From the deduced amino acid sequence, xUPIII is supposed to be a single transmembrane protein that contains a large amino-terminal extracellular domain and a short carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Fertilization-induced phosphorylation occurs in the tyrosine residue 249 of the carboxyl-terminal tail, as revealed by the mass spectrometric analysis. An antibody against the extracellular domain of xUPIII blocks fertilization in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, these data suggest that xUPIII is involved in sperm-egg interaction/fusion via its extracellular domain and in the Src-dependent egg activation signaling via phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue in its cytoplasmic tail. Materials—Anti-phosphotyrosine mouse monoclonal antibody (PY99) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit antibodies against synthetic peptides that correspond to a part of xUPIII (UPIII carboxyl-terminal peptide (xUPIII-CT), residues 244–265), Xenopus Src2 (xSrc, residues 409–427), and a rabbit antibody to recombinant GST·xUPIII-extracellular domain (GST·xUPIII-ED) (see below) were prepared according to the described method (28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). All the synthetic peptides were obtained from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan) or BEX Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Antibodies against β-tubulin, PLCγ, or FLAG epitope were from BD Transduction Laboratories, Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA), or Sigma. H2O2 was from Santoku Chemical Industries (Tokyo, Japan). Lysyl endopeptidase (Achromobacter lyticus Protease I) was obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Sulfosuccinimidobiotin (EZ-Link™ sulfo-NHS-biotin) was purchased from Pierce. N-glycosidase F (catalog number 1365169) and endoglycosidase H (catalog number 1088726) were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Leupeptin was obtained from the Peptide Institute. Other chemicals were analytical grade and purchased from Sigma, Wako Pure Chemicals, or Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Animals, Gametes, Embryos, and Tissues—X. laevis were obtained from the Hamamatsu Seibutsu Kyozai (Hamamatsu, Japan) and maintained in de-chloride tap water at ambient temperature (18–22 °C). Ovulated or gently squeezed eggs were obtained by the method as described previously (21Sato K. Iwasaki T. Ogawa K. Konishi M. Tokmakov A.A. Fukami Y. Development. 2002; 129: 885-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and immediately washed three times with 1× DeBoer's buffer (DB) containing 110 mm NaCl, 1.3 mm KCl, and 0.44 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.2, by addition of NaHCO3), kept at ambient temperature, and used within 3 h of spawning. Before experiments, the jelly layer surrounding the eggs was removed by incubation with 1× DB supplemented with 2% cysteine and 0.06 n NaOH for 3–8 min. The resulting jelly coat-free eggs were washed five times with 1× DB and subjected to egg activation treatment (see below). Sperm suspension in 1× DB was prepared from testis of male frogs as described previously (18Sato K. Tokmakov A.A. He C.-L. Kurokawa M. Iwasaki T. Shirouzu M. Fissore R.A. Yokoyama S. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38413-38420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Immediately before insemination, the sperm suspension was sedimented by brief centrifugation and incubated with egg jelly water (21Sato K. Iwasaki T. Ogawa K. Konishi M. Tokmakov A.A. Fukami Y. Development. 2002; 129: 885-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After the incubation, the suspension was washed once with 1× DB, and the resulting jelly water-treated sperm were used for insemination. The concentration of sperm in the suspension was determined by counting sperm number by hematocytometer. Activation of jelly layer-free eggs was done by fertilization with jelly water-treated sperm (about 107 sperm/ml) or H2O2 (10 mm) for the times as specified under “Results.” After the activation treatments, egg/embryo samples were washed extensively with ice-cold 1× DB, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at –80 °C. To analyze proteins in adult tissues of Xenopus, several organs were surgically removed from sacrificed animals, immediately washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline, and kept at –80 °C until required. Extraction and Subcellular Fraction of Eggs—To obtain raft and non-raft fractions, egg samples prepared as above were mixed with a 5-fold volume of ice-cold extraction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μm (p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (APMSF), 150 mm NaCl, and 250 mm sucrose and homogenized with a 7-ml Dounce tissue grinder (Wheaton). The homogenates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min to remove debris and yolk platelets, and the supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 20 min. Concentrated Triton X-100 (25%) was then added to the fluffy layer of the pellet (crude membranes) to yield a final concentration of Triton X-100 at 1%. The mixtures were homogenized again, incubated on ice for 10 min, and mixed with equal volumes of ice-cold raft buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and 85% sucrose (sucrose buffer). The resulting mixtures (5 ml) were layered first with 19 ml of 30% sucrose and second with 12 ml of 5% sucrose in the same buffer. The samples were centrifuged at 144,000 × g for 20–24 h in an SW28 rotor (Beckman Instruments). After the centrifugation, 3-ml aliquots of 12 fractions were collected from the top to the bottom of the tubes. Usually, fractions 4–6 were pooled as raft fractions, whereas fraction 12 was pooled as detergent-solubilized non-raft fractions. Alternatively, egg samples were directly homogenized with the Triton X-100-containing buffer and subjected to raft fractionation as described previously (21Sato K. Iwasaki T. Ogawa K. Konishi M. Tokmakov A.A. Fukami Y. Development. 2002; 129: 885-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, raft fractions were diluted with more than 4-fold volume of water and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet fractions were regarded as concentrated rafts and resuspended with an appropriate volume of raft buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and then used for experiments. To obtain cytosolic and membrane fractions, samples were homogenized in 5-fold volume of ice-cold extraction buffer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatants were collected as the cytosolic fractions. The pellets were further homogenized with the extraction buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS. The homogenates were kept on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatants were collected as the detergent-solubilized membrane fractions. Protein concentrations were determined by means of the dye binding assay (BioRad). Calibration was made with standard bovine serum albumin (Calbiochem). Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Immunoblotting—Proteins from egg samples or cultured cells (see below) (50–500 μg, 1 μg/μl) were immunoprecipitated with an appropriate amount of antibodies as specified under “Results” for 3–6 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, the immune complexes were adsorbed onto 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads by gentle agitation for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 500 μl of buffer containing 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate sodium salt, 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μm APMSF. The washed beads were then treated with Laemmli's SDS sample buffer (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) at 98 °C for 5 min. The SDS-denatured proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting or silver stain as described previously (21Sato K. Iwasaki T. Ogawa K. Konishi M. Tokmakov A.A. Fukami Y. Development. 2002; 129: 885-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Note that silver stain was done with the use of a Bio-Rad kit (Silver Stain Plus). Also note that in immunoblotting analysis, detection of the immune complex between proteins and the primary antibodies of interest was made by enzyme-linked color development with alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase that were conjugated to the secondary antibodies (Cappel). In-gel Protein Digestion and Mass Spectrometry—Proteins in SDS-polyacrylamide gels were visualized by using the Bio-Rad Silver Stain Plus kit. The bands corresponding to proteins were excised and then were destained by treatment with 15 mm potassium hexacynoferrate (III), K3[Fe(CN)6], 50 mm sodium thiosulfate, Na2S2O3, for 10 min at room temperature. Destained proteins in gels were reduced by incubating with 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 1 h at 50 °C and alkylated by treatment with 10 mm EDTA, 40 mm iodoacetamide, 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 30 min at room temperature. They were digested in-gel with lysyl endopeptidase from A. lyticus (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.9) for 15 h at 37 °C. Resulting peptide fragments were extracted from gels and then concentrated in vacuo. After desalting with Zip-TipC18 (Millipore), peptide fragments were subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. Mass spectra were acquired by direct infusion analysis on Micromass Q-Tof2 hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-electrospray ionization source, in positive mode. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was performed by collision-induced dissociation using argon as the collision gas. Identification of EST Consensus Sequence—Identification of EST consensus sequence using mass spectrometric data was performed by peptide mass fingerprinting and product ion mass fingerprinting run by the MASCOT program (Matrix Science) in our in-house server. An EST consensus sequence data base, Tentative Consensus sequence data base of X. laevis (Version 3.1), was downloaded from the file transfer protocol server of the Institute for Genomic Research to our in-house MASCOT server. cDNA Cloning and Sequencing of Xenopus Uroplakin III Gene—Total RNA was isolated from Xenopus liver or ovary according to the described method. mRNA was enriched using poly(A) columns (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction and reverse-transcribed with a reverse transcriptase provided by a kit (SuperScript™, Invitrogen) and oligo(dT)12–18 primers. The resulting first strand DNA was used as template for PCR reactions of Xenopus uroplakin III gene. Oligonucleotides used for PCR were: the sense primer, 5′-GGG CTG CTG ATG TGA GAG TGT ACC TGA CA-3′; the antisense primer, 5′-CAC AGG GAA GGT ATT CCT CCT CCT CCG CAT-3′; each corresponds to a part of the 5′- or the 3′-untranslated regions of the Xenopus uroplakin III sequence deposited in the Tentative Consensus data base (The Institute of Genomic Research Gene Index, www.tigr.org/tigr-scripts/tgi/T_reports.cgi?species=Xenopus), respectively. Pfu polymerase was used to amplify the intervening sequence. The PCR sample mixtures were amplified on a thermal cycler using programs with annealing temperature ranges of 60–95 °C. A fragment of the expected size was excised from a 2% agarose gel, cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and sequenced. cDNA Constructs—cDNA encoding the extracellular domain (ED: amino acid residues 1–191) of xUPIII was obtained by PCR, using the pCR2.1-TOPO vector containing the full-length cDNA for xUPIII prepared as above. PCR primers used were: the sense primer, 5′-GGA TCC CCG GGA ATT CCC ATG GGT CCT TGG AGG TAA-3′ and the antisense primer, 5′-GAC AGA ATT CCC ACC ACT CCT TCT GCC AGG-3′. Both primers contained a restriction site for EcoRI as indicated by underlining. After PCR amplification, the products were digested with EcoRI and ligated into the cognate site of the bacterial expression plasmid pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) so that the products were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein (GST·xUPIII-ED). Alternatively, cDNA encoding the full-length UPIII was amplified by PCR using the pCR2.1-TOPO vector carrying xUPIII sequence. PCR primers used were: the sense primer, 5′-CTG CGA ATT CAT GGG TCC TTG GAG GTA TCT-3′ and the antisense primer, 5′-AAA AGC TTG GCC TGC TGG GTA GCC GCA TAG-3′. The sense primer contained a restriction site for EcoRI, whereas the antisense primer contained that for HindIII, each as indicated by an underline. The products were digested with EcoRI and HindIII and subcloned into the pCMV vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) that had been digested with the same restriction enzymes. Both constructs were confirmed in their orientation, length, and sequence by DNA sequencing. Preparation of cDNA encoding Xenopus Src2 gene (xSrc2) and construction of mammalian expression plasmids that will express FLAG-tagged wild type or kinase-active xSrc2 were done as described previously. 2T.

Expression of GST Fusion Xenopus Uroplakin III Extracellular Domain—Cultures of Escherichia coli strain DH5α were transfected with the pGEX-2T plasmid harboring the cDNA for the extracellular domain of xUPIII (xUPIII-ED) and grown at 37 °C in L-broth (10 mg/ml Bactotryptone, 5 mg/ml Bacto-yeast extract, 5 mg/ml NaCl) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. When the growth of bacteria reached at log phase, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1.5 mm) was added, and the cultures were further continued for 2 h. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was sonicated in the presence of extraction buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μm APMSF. The resulting insoluble material or “inclusion body” was collected, separated by SDS-PAGE on 8% gels, and used as antigen for immunization of rabbits. Indirect Immunofluorescent Study—Localization of xUPIII on the surface of Xenopus eggs was determined by using a rabbit antibody to the extracellular domain of xUPIII (anti-xUPIII-ED antibody). All the following manipulations were carried out at room temperature. Dejellied unfertilized eggs were incubated with 1× DB containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 10 min and then treated with the anti-xUPIII-ED antibody (500-fold diluted antiserum) for 20 min. After the antibody treatment, the eggs were washed several times with 1× DB containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and then treated with a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 5 μg/ml in the same buffer solution for 15 min in the dark. After the treatment, the eggs were washed several times with 1× DB and then directly examined under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Model LSM510, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). To determine the localization of xUPIII on the surface of egg plasma membranes, we manually removed vitelline envelopes from the antibody-treated egg samples and examined the vitelline envelope-free eggs under the microscope. Surface Bbiotinylation of Eggs—Dejellied unfertilized eggs were treated with 1× DB containing 2 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin for 5–10 min at room temperature. After the treatment, egg samples were washed several times with 1× DB and subjected to extraction to prepare either the cytosolic and the membrane fractions or the raft and the non-raft fractions (see above). To detect biotinylated proteins in egg samples, we performed immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with a mouse monoclonal antibody against biotin (Clone BN-34, Sigma). Fertilization Assay in the Presence of anti-xUPIII ED Antiserum— When the effect of the anti-xUPIII ED antibody on fertilization was examined, a group of 10 dejellied, unfertilized eggs was placed in a polystyrene well (diameter: 8 mm) filled with 100 μl of 0.1× modified Ringer's solution and an equal volume of the preimmune antiserum or anti-xUPIII-ED antiserum diluted with 0.1× modified Ringer's solution. The final concentrations of antiserum were dilutions of 1:100–1: 10. After the incubation for 30 min, 100 μl of serum/0.1× modified Ringer's solution was replaced with an equal volume of jelly water-treated sperm. The final concentrations of sperm were 0.5–2.0 × 107/ml. We determined the rate of successful fertilization by scoring those that underwent cortical contraction within 30 min and first cleavage within 100 min after insemination. Transfection of HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells of 20–30% confluence in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 1–2 μg of plasmid DNA/dish as specified under “Results” using Effectene™ reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's standard protocol. The transfection treatment proceeded for 24 h at 37 °C, and the resultant transfected cells were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 18 h prior to cell extraction. After the transfection treatment, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in extraction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μm APMSF. Cell lysates were vortex-mixed (10 s, 2 times), sonicated (30 s, 2 times), clarified by ultracentrifugation (300,000 × g, 10 min), diluted to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml with the extraction buffer, and used as Triton X-100-solubilized whole cell extracts. To look for egg raft-associated proteins that are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues after fertilization, we performed immunoblotting of the egg raft fractions, which had been prepared from unfertilized eggs, fertilized eggs, or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-treated eggs, with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, there were several proteins in the raft fractions to be tyrosine-phosphorylated after the egg activation treatments. They include the 57-kDa xSrc an"

The removal of the 5′ extra sequence is accomplished by RNase P, a ribonucleoprotein, in all three kingdoms. On the other hand, the mechanisms of the 3′ extra sequence removal differ among the three kingdoms. In eukaryotes, the tRNA genes do not encode the 3′-terminal CCA sequence, which is essential for aminoacylation. The eukaryotic 3′ processing is done mainly by a tRNA 3′ processing endoribonuclease named tRNase Z (EC 3.1.26.11; RNase Z or 3′-tRNase), which cuts the pre-tRNAs with the 3′ extra sequence after the discriminator base (5.Levinger L.

In Archaea, the 3′ terminus is processed by tRNase Z (9.Schiffer S. Rosch S. Marchfelder A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2769-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 14.Schierling K. Rosch S.

In Escherichia coli, all tRNA genes encode the CCA sequence, and the removal of the 3′ extra sequence is catalyzed by a combination of exo- and endoribonucleases (2.Deutscher M.P. Soll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. AMS Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 51-65Google Scholar, 16.Li Z. Deutscher M.P.

Then the exonucleolytic processing of the 3′ extra sequence is catalyzed by a combination of RNases T, PH, D, BN, and II and polynucleotide phosphorylase (16.Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) following the removal of the 5′ extra sequence. On the other hand, in Bacillus subtilis, some tRNA genes encode the CCA sequence, and others do not. tRNase Z processes only the pre-tRNAs without the CCA sequence, while an unidentified tRNase Z-independent tRNA processing pathway may exist for tRNAs with the CCA sequence (17.Pellegrini O. Nezzar J. Marchfelder A. Putzer H. Condon C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4534-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In Thermotoga maritima, the 3′-CCA sequence exists in almost all of the tRNA genes with only one exception (18.Nelson K.E. Clayton R.A. Gill S.R. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K.

The T. maritima tRNase Z can correctly process the pre-tRNAs with the CCA sequence; it cleaves the pre-tRNAs precisely after the CCA sequence, not after the discriminator base (15.Minagawa A.

The ELAC1 proteins are the short forms of tRNase Z (tRNase ZS) consisting of 300–400 amino acids and are widely distributed among the three kingdoms (9.Schiffer S. Rosch S. Marchfelder A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the ELAC2 proteins are the long forms of tRNase Z (tRNase ZL) consisting of 800–900 amino acids and are found only in eukaryotes (9.Schiffer S. Rosch S. Marchfelder A.

Both of them have the metal binding motifs conserved in the metallo-β-lactamase superfamily, although their overall sequence similarities to metallo-β-lactamases are very low. In addition, the N-terminal half of tRNase ZL shares a weak sequence homology to the C-terminal half of tRNase ZL and tRNase ZS, although it lacks the metal binding motifs (19.Tavtigian S.V.

Hence it has been suggested that the tRNase ZL gene was produced by the duplication of the tRNase ZS gene. In the present study, we determined the crystal structure of T. maritima tRNase Z at 2.6-Å resolution. Based on the structure, we constructed a local docking model that provides new insight into how tRNase Z recognizes the pre-tRNA structure. Protein Expression and Purification—The double-stranded DNA encoding the T. maritima tRNase Z gene was amplified by PCR from the plasmid pQE/Tm(WT), which produces a histidine-tagged tRNase Z protein (15.Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15688-15697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), to remove the tag-encoding sequence and was cloned between the NdeI and SalI sites of the expression vector pET26b(+) (Novagen). The T. maritima tRNase Z protein was overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Cells were grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C until the A600 was ∼0.5, and then isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a 1 mm final concentration. Cells were grown at 37 °C for an additional 3 h and were harvested by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, DNase I, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science) and was homogenized by sonication. The extract was heated for 30 min at 80 °C to denature most of the E. coli proteins. The heat-treated fraction was centrifuged, and the supernatant fraction was loaded onto an SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 50 mm NaCl and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.05–1.0 m NaCl. The protein eluate was diluted with an equal volume of 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) containing 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and the resultant solution was then loaded onto a HiTrap heparin column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) containing 500 mm NaCl and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.5–1.5 m NaCl and was purified to more than 95% homogeneity with a yield of about 1.5 mg of purified protein from 1 liter of LB medium cell culture as judged by SDS-PAGE. Crystallization of tRNase Z—Prior to crystallization, the protein fraction was dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) containing 400 mm NaCl and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and was concentrated to ∼3.5 mg/ml using a Vivaspin2 filter (Vivascience). The atomic absorption experiment revealed the presence of zinc ions in the T. maritima tRNase Z solution, although no zinc had been added. An initial screen for crystallization was accomplished by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C with Crystal Screen I, Crystal Screen II, and Natrix (Hampton Research). The volume of the reservoir solutions was 500 μl (460 μl of the screening kit reagent mixed with 40 μl of 5 m NaCl), and the drop was prepared by mixing equal volumes (1 μl each) of the protein solution and the screening kit reagent. The crystals were obtained within 3 days in drops containing 0.1 m Tris-Cl buffer (pH 8.5) with 1.25 m ammonium phosphate, and thin, large crystals grew to dimensions of 0.7 × 0.5 × 0.05 mm3 within a week. The selenomethionine (SeMet) derivative was prepared by overexpression of tRNase Z in the Met− E. coli strain B834(DE3) and was purified and crystallized by the same procedures used for the native protein. Data Collection and Structure Determination—The data set of the native protein and the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data set of the SeMet derivative protein were collected from BL41XU and BL26B1 at SPring-8 (Harima, Japan), respectively. Data processing and scaling were performed with HKL2000 (23.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P21212 with unit cell parameters a = 111.9, b = 73.6, and c = 92.0 Å for the native protein and a = 115.0, b = 72.5, and c = 90.1 Å for the SeMet derivative protein. Ten selenium sites were picked of the 12 selenium sites expected in the asymmetric unit using SnB (24.Weeks C.M. Miller R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1999; 32: 120-124Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The selenium parameters were refined, and the initial phases were calculated using SOLVE at 3-Å resolution (25.Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The resulting initial phases were extended to 2.7 Å by density modification with the program RESOLVE (25.Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The atomic model was manually built using O (26.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) and was refined using CNS (27.Adams P.D. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Brunger A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5018-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Phasing of the native crystal data set was carried out by molecular replacement using MOL-REP (28.Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4153) Google Scholar) with the 2.7-Å SeMet derivative models as a search model. The model of the native crystal was built and refined in a similar manner as that of the SeMet derivative structure. There are two molecules (A and B) in the asymmetric unit. One flexible region and two short loop regions (amino acid residues 152–174, 134–136, and 217–220 of molecule A and 152–175, 133–138, and 211–222 of molecule B) were not visible due to disorder and were excluded from the model. The crystal structure was refined to the R and Rfree factors of 22.6 and 27.9%, respectively, within the resolution range of 50–2.6 Å.

In the crystal, the asymmetric unit contains two molecules, A and B. The root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) value between these two molecules was 0.5 Å for 236 Cα atoms, indicating that they share almost identical structures. They form a dimer composed of the molecules related by the non-crystallographic symmetry 2-fold axis. Actually the gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation analyses revealed that T. maritima tRNase Z is a dimer in solution (data not shown), which is consistent with the results that other tRNase Zs are also dimers in solution (9.Schiffer S. Rosch S. Marchfelder A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2769-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 29.Vogel A. Schilling O. Niecke M. Bettmer J. Meyer-Klaucke W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29078-29085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The overall architecture of T. maritima tRNase Z is a four-layer αβ/βα sandwich fold (Fig. 1A). The structure consists of two β-sheets, each composed of seven β-strands and three α-helices on both sides (Fig. 1A). The structure is divided into two nearly equivalent domains: an N-terminal domain (β1–6, β14, and α1–3) and a C-terminal domain (β7–13 and α4–6), consisting of one β-sheet and three α-helices. In the crystal structure, there is a long disordered region between β9 and β10 (amino acid residues 152–174 of molecule A, and amino acid residues 152–175 of molecule B) that may protrude from the core structure into the solvent. Additionally two short loop regions (amino acid residues 134–136 and 218–220 of molecule A, and amino acid residues 133–138 and 211–222 of molecule B), located at the edge of the C-terminal β-sheet, are also disordered (Fig. 1A). The dimer interface is mainly composed of the N-terminal α-helices of both subunits (Fig. 1B). The non-crystallographic symmetry 2-fold axis runs approximately perpendicular to helices α2 and α3. Therefore, the direction of the α2 and α3 helices of each subunit is antiparallel. The buried surface area is about 1400 Å2/monomer, which is 13% of the total surface area. The directly interacting residues in the dimer are Phe-11 in β2, Glu-28 in the loop connecting β3 and α1, Ser-31 and Thr-32 in α1, Val-51 in the loop connecting β4 and α2, Trp-58 and Ile-63 in α2, and Glu-88 and Arg-95 in α3 within the cut-off distance of 3.5 Å. These amino acid residues are not conserved in the tRNase Z family (Fig. 2). Another dimer composed of crystallographic symmetry-related molecules is also formed in the crystal. When tRNase Z forms this type of dimer, the N and C termini of both subunits are located close to each other and are involved in the dimer interface. However, tRNase Z molecules with N- or C-terminal histidine tags are active, indicating that the crystal packing makes this type of dimer. Structural Similarity with Metallo-β-lactamases—The tRNase Z family belongs to the metallo-β-lactamase superfamily (19.Tavtigian S.V. Simard J. Teng D.H. Abtin V. Baumgard M. Beck A. Camp N.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) with known three-dimensional protein structures also revealed that the overall architecture of T. maritima tRNase Z shares a common fold with those of the metallo-β-lactamases (31.Carfi A.

Despite the modest Z score and the low level of structure-based sequence identity (less than 10%), T. maritima tRNase Z was structurally aligned with the three top scoring proteins (Fig. 3, A–D), TM0207 with an r.m.s.d. of 2.5 Å for 155 Cα atoms, B. fragilis metallo-β-lactamase with an r.m.s.d. of 2.8 Å for 121 Cα atoms, and S. maltophilia L1 metallo-β-lactamase with an r.m.s.d. of 2.5 Å for 121 Cα atoms, by the program Secondary Structure Matching (34.Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3166) Google Scholar). Active Site—The metallo-β-lactamase superfamily has five conserved motifs (20.Aravind L. In Silico Biol. 1999; 1: 69-91PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Daiyasu H. Osaka K. Ishino Y. Toh H.

Motif I consists of the conserved aspartic acid, and motif II, which is typical of the superfamily, consists of the conserved signature motif HXHXDH and is located at the edge of the N-terminal β-sheet. Motifs III, IV, and V are located at the edge of the C-terminal β-sheet. Motifs III and V each have a conserved histidine residue, and motif IV has an acidic residue or a cysteine (20.Aravind L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3592-3601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The active site of the metallo-β-lactamase superfamily comprises motifs II-V located at one edge of the β-sandwich (19.Tavtigian S.V. Simard J. Teng D.H. Abtin V. Baumgard M. Beck A. Camp N.J. Carillo A.R. Chen Y. Dayananth P. Desrochers M. Dumont M. Farnham J.M. Frank D. Frye C. Ghaffari S. Gupte J.S. Hu R. Iliev D. Janecki T. Kort E.N. Laity K.E. Leavitt A. Leblanc G.

Neuhausen S. Rommens J. Cannon-Albright L.A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). These five conserved motifs are also conserved in the tRNase Z family (Fig. 2); motif I (Asp-25) is located at the end of β3, motif II (His-48, His-50, Asp-52, and His-53) is located at the region connecting β4 and α2, motif III (His-134) is located at the loop connecting β8 and β9 but is disordered in this structure, motif IV (Asp-190) is located at the end of β10, and motif V (His-244) is located at the end of β12 (Figs. 1A and 2). A previous study revealed that Asp-25 (motif I), His-48, His-50, Asp-52, and His-53 (motif II) of T. maritima tRNase Z are essential for the activity, suggesting that these residues form a part of the active site (15.Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15688-15697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In fact, four of the residues, His-48, His-50, Asp-52, and His-53, are located close to each other and form half of the active site pocket in the tRNase Z structure (Fig. 4A). Asp-25 is located in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot and interacts with the side chain of Thr-47, which is either Thr or Ser in the tRNase Z family (Fig. 2), and may fix the active site pocket (Fig. 4A). Notably the motif I aspartate residue adopts a sterically restrained conformation in other metallo-β-lactamases (31.Carfi A. Pares S. Duee E. Galleni M. Duez C. Frere J.M. Dideberg O.

Motifs IV and V create the other half of the active site pocket (Fig. 4B), and motif III may also contribute, but it is disordered in the crystal structure. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 4B, the active site residues of T. maritima tRNase Z superimpose well on those of B. fragilis metallo-β-lactamase: His-48, His-50, Asp-52, His-53 (motif III), Asp-190 (motif IV), and His-244 (motif V) correspond to His-82, His-84, Asp-86, Ser-87 (motif II), Cys-164 (motif IV), and His-206 (motif V), respectively (Fig. 4B). In the present electron density map for the T. maritima tRNase Z crystal, a strong electron density is tightly bound to the side chain of Asp-52, Asp-190, and His-244. By analogy to the structures of metallo-β-lactamases, we assigned this electron density as a zinc ion. However, the distance between the putative zinc ion and the side chains of Asp-52, Asp-190, and His-244 are longer (3.5, 3.3, and 3.1 Å, respectively, in molecule A) than the usual distance between a zinc ion and the side chains of protein residues (2.0–2.3 Å) (37.Harding M.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). This may be because the binding of the zinc ion to T. maritima tRNase Z is weak. In fact, the zinc binding positions slightly differ between the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. In molecule B, the position of the zinc ion is slightly shifted toward Asp-190 as compared with that in molecule A, and as a result, the distances between the zinc ion and Asp-52, Asp-190, and His-244 change (3.2, 2.7, and 3.2 Å, respectively). We could not exclude the possibility that this density is due to a different metal, such as Mg2+ or Mn2+, which is required for the catalysis, although neither Mg2+ nor Mn2+ was added exogenously. Relationship with the Phosphodiesterase (PDE) Motif—A previous report suggested that tRNase Z has a PDE motif, one of the zinc binding motifs (HX2HX20–120E), in the region overlapping with that of motif II (9.Schiffer S. Rosch S. Marchfelder A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2769-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The PDE motif was originally described in cAMP phosphodiesterase (38.Francis S.H. Turko I.V. Corbin J.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 1-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of cAMP into AMP to regulate the cAMP concentration. The PDE4D2 catalytic domain has a compact structure composed of 16 α-helices and contains two metal ions (38.Francis S.H. Turko I.V. Corbin J.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 1-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is completely different from that of T. maritima tRNase Z. In the structure of PDE4D2, the two PDE motifs jointly create a single pocket for binding the two metal ions (38.Francis S.H. Turko I.V. Corbin J.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 1-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One is the zinc ion and the other may be Mg2+ or another divalent cation. When we compared the putative active site of the T. maritima tRNase Z structure with the AMP binding site of the human PDE4D2 catalytic domain-AMP complex structure, only four residues, Asp-52, His-53, Asp-190, and His-244 in T. maritima tRNase Z and Asp-201, His-200, Asp-318, and His-164 in PDE4D2, respectively, superposed well (Fig. 5). The three residues, except for His-53, may interact with a metal ion in T. maritima tRNase Z (Fig. 4B), and all four residues in PDE4D2 interact with the zinc ion (Fig. 5). In the structure of PDE4D2, Asp-318 also forms hydrogen bonds with a water molecule bridging two metal ions, and His-160 is located near the O-3′ of AMP (38.Francis S.H. Turko I.V. Corbin J.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 1-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it was suggested that Asp-318 works as a general base to activate the bridging water for a nucleophilic attack on the phosphodiester bond of cAMP, and His-160 may protonate the O-3′ of AMP (38.Francis S.H. Turko I.V. Corbin J.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 1-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since there are several histidine residues at the active site, Asp-190 may serve as a general base, and a histidine residue at the active site may serve as a proton donor in the catalysis of RNA in T. maritima tRNase Z as in PDE4D2. Although there is no second metal ion and no bridging water in the crystal structure of T. maritima tRNase Z, the previous study showed that T. maritima tRNase Z requires Mg2+ or Mn2+ for its activity, suggesting that it is bound to the tRNase Z together with the substrate RNA. RNA Binding Model—It is interesting to examine how tRNase Z may recognize the substrate tRNAs. Fig. 6A shows the residue identity mapped on the molecular surface of the dimer of T. maritima tRNase Z, based on the alignment shown in Fig. 2, ranging from pale green (70% similarity) to deep green (100% identity). The conserved residues are mainly concentrated at the active site (Fig. 6A). The electrostatic potential shows that one side of T. maritima tRNase Z is mostly negatively charged, and the other side is mostly positively charged (Fig. 6B). However, there is no clear correlation between the distribution of conserved amino acids and that of the electrostatic potential except around the active site (Fig. 6, A and B). It was reported that T. maritima tRNase Z and other tRNase ZSs require the whole tRNA structure for optimal activity, and tRNase ZLs require the acceptor stem and the T arm of tRNA (14.Schierling K. Rosch S. Rupprecht R. Schiffer S. Marchfelder A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22.Takaku H. Minagawa A. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 39.Takaku H. Minagawa A. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e91Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although the anticodon arm is not essential for the activity, the T arm and D arm are very important for the catalysis by tRNase ZS (14.Schierling K. Rosch S. Rupprecht R. Schiffer S. Marchfelder A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This implies that tRNase ZS recognizes the top half of the tRNA molecules. Taking these aspects into account, we constructed a docking model of the T. maritima tRNase Z dimer and the two whole tRNA molecules (yeast tRNAPhe) (Fig. 7). In this model, the tRNAs bind the positively charged surface of the T. maritima tRNase Z dimer, and one protomer of the dimer recognizes the 3′-CCA terminus of the tRNA, while the other protomer recognizes the remaining part of the tRNA (Fig. 7). The 2-fold axis of the T. maritima tRNase Z dimer is perpendicular to the tRNA binding surface, and the two tRNAs could bind to the enzyme at the same time without steric hindrance. The tRNase Z interacts with the acceptor stem, the D stem, and the T stem (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Docking model of T. maritima tRNase Z with tRNA (stereoview). T. maritima tRNase Z is represented by a surface model with the electrostatic potential, and the tRNAs are represented by a ribbon model. The orientation of the dimer structure is the same as in Fig. 1B. The docking model was constructed manually, avoiding steric hindrance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) On the other hand, tRNase Zs from organisms other than T. maritima cleave the pre-tRNAs after the discriminator at position 73 (3.Morl M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These pre-tRNAs enter the active site more deeply, suggesting that the structures of the common tRNase Zs are different from that of T. maritima tRNase Z. For T. maritima tRNase Z, the S31Q mutation shifts the cleavage site from position 76 to position 74 or 73, while the T33Q mutation shifts it to position 75 or 74 (15.Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15688-15697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These residues are located on or next to the dimer interface, which is formed by Phe-11, Glu-28, Ser-31, Thr-32, Val-51, Trp-58, Ile-63, Glu-88, and Arg-95 (Fig. 2). Surprisingly all of these interface amino acid residues, except for Glu-28, of T. maritima tRNase Z are different from the well conserved residues in the corresponding positions of the common tRNase Zs. For instance, the residues corresponding to Phe-11, Ser-31, and Trp-58 in T. maritima tRNase Z are commonly Pro, Gln, and Pro, respectively, in other tRNase Zs (Fig. 2). Hence the difference in the residues involved in the dimer formation appears to be correlated with the difference in the pre-tRNA cleavage site. As described above, one pre-tRNA molecule is likely to bind with the two subunits of the T. maritima tRNase Z dimer (Fig. 7). Therefore, the relative orientation of the two subunits in the dimer probably defines the cleavage site distinctly between the common tRNase Zs and T. maritima tRNase Z. Implication for the structure of tRNase ZL—Both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of tRNase ZL share sequence similarity with tRNase ZS (19.Tavtigian S.V. Simard J. Teng D.H. Abtin V. Baumgard M.

This implies that both domains also have the same metallo-β-lactamase fold, and the structure of tRNase ZL may resemble that of the tRNase ZS dimer. In the dimer structure of T. maritima tRNase Z, the C terminus of one protomer is located adjacent to the N terminus of the other protomer, although the directions of both ends are opposite (Fig. 1B). Hence only a local structural change, such as the movement of β-strands, is needed to connect the N- and C-terminal domains in the structure of tRNase ZL, and it retains the same relative orientation as that of the tRNase ZS dimer. The N- and C-terminal β-strands are located on the tRNA binding face in our model, and thus the local movement of the N and C termini may cause the different substrate specificities between tRNase ZS and tRNase ZL (22.Takaku H. Minagawa A. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To elucidate the precise mechanism of the substrate recognition of the tRNase Zs, further studies, such as the structure determination of a complex of tRNase Z and an RNA substrate or the structure determination of tRNase ZL, are necessary.

The pancreatic tissue ghrelin concentration measured by C-terminal radioimmunoassay (RIA) and plasma desacyl ghrelin concentration of RIP-G Tg were about 1000 and 3.4 times higher than those of nontransgenic littermates, respectively. The pancreatic tissue n-octanoylated ghrelin concentration measured by N-terminal RIA and plasma n-octanoylated ghrelin concentration of RIP-G Tg were not distinguishable from those of nontransgenic littermates. RIP-G Tg showed suppression of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Arginine-stimulated insulin secretion, pancreatic insulin mRNA and peptide levels, β cell mass, islet architecture, and GLUT2 and PDX-1 immunoreactivity in RIP-G Tg pancreas were not significantly different from those of nontransgenic littermates. Islet batch incubation study did not show suppression of insulin secretion of RIP-G Tg in vitro. The insulin tolerance test showed lower tendency of blood glucose levels in RIP-G Tg. Taking lower tendency of triglyceride level of RIP-G Tg into consideration, these results may indicate that the suppression of insulin secretion is likely due to the effect of desacyl ghrelin on insulin sensitivity. RGP-G Tg, in which the pancreatic tissue ghrelin concentration measured by C-RIA was about 50 times higher than that of nontransgenic littermates, showed no significant changes in insulin secretion, glucose metabolism, islet mass, and islet architecture.

Ghrelin is a 28-amino acid peptide with unique modification of acylation, which is essential for its biological action (1Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7317) Google Scholar). Ghrelin was originally identified in rat stomach as an endogenous ligand for an orphan receptor, which has been so far called growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R) 1The abbreviations used are: GHS-R, growth hormone secretagogue receptor; RIP-G Tg, rat insulin II promoter-ghrelin transgenic; RGP-G Tg, rat glucagon promoter-ghrelin transgenic mice; RIA, radioimmunoassay; C-RIA, anti-ghrelin [13–28] antiserum; N-RIA, anti-ghrelin [1–11] antiserum; RT, reverse transcription; HDL, high density lipoprotein; PP, pancreatic polypeptide.

Here we developed and analyzed two types of transgenic mice: rat insulin II promoter-ghrelin transgenic mice (RIP-G Tg) and rat glucagon promoter-ghrelin transgenic mice (RGP-G Tg). The purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of transgenic overexpression of ghrelin cDNA in pancreatic islets. Generating RIP- and RGP-ghrelin Transgenic Mice—Mouse stomach cDNA library was constructed from 1 μg of mouse stomach poly(A)+ RNA with a cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences). Mouse ghrelin cDNA was isolated from this library, using rat ghrelin cDNA as a probe. A fusion gene comprising RIP and mouse ghrelin cDNA coding sequences was designed. The purified fragment (10 μg/ml) was micro-injected into the pronucleus of fertilized C57/B6J mice (SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) eggs. The viable eggs were transferred into the oviducts of pseudopregnant female ICR mice (SLC) using standard techniques. Transgenic founder mice were identified by Southern blot analysis of tail DNAs using the mouse ghrelin cDNA fragment as a probe. RGP-G Tg was generated similarly. Transgenic mice were used as heterozygotes. Animals were maintained on standard rat food (CE-2, 352 kcal/100 g, Japan CLEA, Tokyo, Japan) on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. All experimental procedures were approved by the Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine Committee on Animal Research. Immunohistochemistry—Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were immunostained using the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex method (Vectastain “ABC” Elite kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) as described previously (36Iwakura H. Hosoda K. Doi R. Komoto I. Nishimura H. Son C. Fujikura J. Tomita T. Takaya K. Ogawa Y. Hayashi T. Inoue G. Akamizu T. Hosoda H. Kojima M. Kangawa K. Imamura M. Nakao K. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 4885-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Serial sections were used, and the thickness of each section was 5 μm. Sections were incubated with anti-C-terminal ghrelin [13–28] (1:1000 at final dilution), anti-N-terminal ghrelin [1–11] (1:2000) (1Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7317) Google Scholar), which recognizes the n-octanoylated portion of ghrelin, anti-glucagon (1:500), anti-insulin (1:500), anti-somatostatin (1:500), anti-pancreatic polypeptide (PP, 1:500, DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark), anti-PDX-1 (1:2000, kindly provided by Christopher V. E. Wright) (37Guz Y. Montminy M.R. Stein R. Leonard J. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V. Teitelman G.

Cell. 1988; 55: 281-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) antisera. Quantification of β cell area was performed in insulin-stained sections by using Axio Vision (Carl Zeiss, Hallbergmoos, Germany) and Scion Image (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Ten sections (200-μm interval) for each mouse (n = 5) were analyzed. The percentage of β cell area in the pancreas was determined by dividing the area of all insulin-positive cells in one section by the total area of the section. Measurements of Plasma and Tissue Ghrelin Concentrations— Plasma was sampled from 10-week-old RIP-G Tg and their nontransgenic littermates under ad libitum feeding states considering the promoter activity. From RGP-G Tg and their littermates, it was sampled after overnight fast. Blood was withdrawn from the retroorbital vein or the proximal end of the portal vein under ether anesthesia, immediately transferred to chilled siliconized glass tubes containing Na2EDTA (1 mg/ml) and aprotinin (1000 KIU/ml, Ohkura Pharmaceutical, Kyoto, Japan), and centrifuged at 4 °C. Hydrogen chloride was added to the samples at a final concentration of 0.1 n immediately after separation of plasma. Plasma was immediately frozen and stored at -80 °C until assay. Plasma ghrelin concentration was determined by desacyl ghrelin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit and active-ghrelin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit that recognizes n-octanoylated ghrelin (Mitsubishi Kagaku Iatron, Tokyo, Japan). As for measurement of tissue ghrelin concentration, pancreata or stomachs were taken from the 8-week-old male mice. The rumen was removed from the stomach. Samples were diced and boiled for 5 min in the 10-fold v/w of water. Acetic acid was added to each solution so that the final concentration was adjusted to 1 m, and the tissues were homogenized. The supernatants were obtained after centrifugation. Tissue ghrelin concentration was determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA) using anti-ghrelin [13–28] antiserum (C-RIA) and anti-ghrelin [1–11] antiserum (N-RIA) as described previously (39Hosoda H. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Measurements of Body Weight and Food Consumption—Mice were housed individually and were allowed free access to standard rat chow. Body weights of mice were measured weekly. Daily food intake was measured by weighing the pellets between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m. Measurements of % Body Fat and Visceral/Subcutaneous Fat Mass Ratio—Forty-week-old mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital. Percent body fat and visceral/subcutaneous fat mass ratio of mice were measured by Latheta LTC-100 (ALOKA, Tokyo, Japan). Glucose and Insulin Tolerance Tests—For the glucose tolerance test, after overnight fast, the mice were injected with 1.5 g/kg glucose intraperitoneally. For the insulin tolerance test, after a 4-h fast, mice were injected with 2.0 milliunits/g human regular insulin (Novolin R; Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) intraperitoneally. Blood was sampled from the tail vein before and 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after the injection. Blood glucose levels were determined by glucose oxidase method using Glutest sensor (Sanwa Kagaku, Kyoto, Japan). Insulin Release—After overnight fast, the mice were injected with 3.0 g/kg glucose or 0.25 g/kg l-arginine intraperitoneally. Plasma was sampled from the tail vein before and 2, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min after the injection using heparin coated tubes. The measurement of insulin concentration was carried out by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using ultra-sensitive rat insulin kit (Morinaga, Yokohama, Japan). Pancreatic Insulin Concentration—As for measurement of pancreatic insulin concentration, pancreata were obtained from the mice under the ether anesthesia and homogenized in acid-ethanol. The supernatants were used for assay after centrifugation. Batch Incubation of Islet—Under the pentobarbital anesthesia, Type IV collagenase (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) dissolved in Hanks' balanced salt solution (1.5 mg/ml) was injected into mouse pancreatic duct. Pancreas was removed and incubated at 37 °C for 14 min. After washing out collagenase by Hanks' balanced salt solution, islets were collected by Ficoll gradient and manually picked up so that the sizes of the islets were equal. Islets were incubated at 37 °C in RPMI1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum for 2 h and then in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 3.3 mm glucose and 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Five islets were incubated at 37 °C in 500 μl of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 3.3 or 8.7 or 16.7 mm glucose for 1 h. After centrifugation, the supernatants were collected. Insulin concentrations in supernatants were determined by rat insulin kit (Morinaga, Yokohama, Japan). Northern Blot Analysis and Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from pancreata using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen K.K., Tokyo, Japan). Filters containing 5 μg of total RNA were prepared. Northern blot analyses were performed as described previously (36Iwakura H. Hosoda K. Doi R. Komoto I. Nishimura H. Son C. Fujikura J. Tomita T. Takaya K. Ogawa Y. Hayashi T. Inoue G. Akamizu T. Hosoda H. Kojima M. Kangawa K. Imamura M. Nakao K. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 4885-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) using the mouse insulin II cDNA and human β-actin cDNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as probes. To confirm that approximately equal amounts of total RNA were assayed in Northern blot hybridization analysis, the density of 18 S rRNA in the gel and signal of β-actin in each lane was used. The hybridization signal intensity was quantitated using an image analyzer BAS-2500 (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). Reverse transcription (RT) was performed with random hexamer and Super-Script II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed with ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The following primers and TaqMan probes were used: mouse GHS-R (sense, 5′-CACCAACCTCTACCTATCCAGCAT-3′; antisense, 5′-CTGACAAACTGGAAGAGTTTGCA-3′; TaqMan probe, 5′-TCCGATCTGCTCATCTTCCTGTGCATG-3′); mouse ghrelin (sense, 5′-GCATGCTCTGGATGGACATG-3′; antisense, 5′-TGGTGGCTTCTTGGATTCCT-3′; TaqMan probe, 5′-AGCCCAGAGCACCAGAAAGCCCA-3′). Lipid Measurements—Blood was collected from the retroorbital vein of 35-week-old RIP-G Tg and their nontransgenic littermates. After separation of serum, total cholesterol, triglyceride, free fatty acid, and HDL-cholesterol levels in serum were determined by Cholesterol E-test Wako, Triglyceride E-test Wako, NEFA C-test Wako, and HDL-cholesterol E-test Wako (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). Statistical Analysis—All values were expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance of difference in mean values was assessed by repeated measures analysis of variance or Student's t test. Distribution of Ghrelin in Normal Mouse Pancreas—We first examined which cell type of islet cells expresses ghrelin in mouse by immunohistochemistry using anti-C-terminal ghrelin antiserum. In the most of the islets no ghrelin-like immunoreactivity was detected. C-terminal ghrelin-like immunoreactivity was observed in the periphery of minor proportion of islets of wild type mice (Fig. 1A). Most of the ghrelin-positive cells were also glucagon-positive by serial section analysis (Fig. 1B), whereas most of the glucagon-positive cells were not ghrelin-positive. Generation of RIP- and RGP-ghrelin Transgenic Mice—A fusion gene comprising RIP and mouse ghrelin cDNA coding sequences was designed so that ghrelin expression might be targeted to the pancreatic β cells (Fig. 2A). The ghrelin mRNA level of RIP-G Tg in pancreas determined by quantitative RT-PCR was about 215 times higher than that of nontransgenic littermates (215.3 ± 40.6 versus 1.0 ± 0.025 arbitrary units, n = 5, p < 0.01). There was also an increase in ghrelin mRNA levels in brain of RIP-G Tg (242.6 ± 17.6 versus 89.1 ± 27.3 arbitrary unit, n = 5, p < 0.01). To confirm the expression of ghrelin transgene in pancreatic β cells, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis using anti-C-terminal ghrelin antiserum. C-terminal ghrelin-like immunoreactivity was observed in the nearly whole area of the islets of the RIP-G Tg (Fig. 2C), whereas it was only seen in the periphery of the islets of their nontransgenic littermates (Fig. 1A). Immunohistochemical analysis using anti-N-terminal ghrelin antiserum showed the same staining pattern (Fig. 2D), indicating that n-octanoylated ghrelin may be produced in β cells of this transgenic mouse. We also stained the brain section of RIP-G Tg. No ghrelin-like immunoreactivity was detected either with anti-C-terminal or anti-N-terminal ghrelin antisera (data not shown). The pancreatic tissue ghrelin concentration of RIP-G Tg measured by C-RIA was about 1000 times higher than that of their nontransgenic littermates (1024 ± 108.9 fmol/mg versus 1.2 ± 0.1 fmol/mg, n = 5, p < 0.01). This concentration was about one third of the nontransgenic stomach concentration (3558.1 ± 51.0 fmol/mg, n = 5). The pancreatic tissue ghrelin concentration of RIP-G Tg measured by N-RIA tended to be also higher than that of their nontransgenic littermates (0.054 ± 0.017 fmol/mg versus 0.038 ± 0.006fmol/mg, n = 5, NS; not significant), but it did not reach statistical significance. Plasma desacyl ghrelin concentration of RIP-G Tg was about 3.4 times higher than that of nontransgenic littermates under the ad libitum feeding states (2805.5 ± 236.4 versus 825.9 ± 244.4 fmol/ml, n = 5, p < 0.01, Fig. 2G). We also measured desacyl ghrelin levels in portal vein of the mice. In the nontransgenic mice, the portal desacyl ghrelin level was significantly higher than that in retroorbital vein (1108.0 ± 257.3 fmol/ml versus 825.9 ± 244.4 fmol/ml, n = 5, p < 0.05, Fig. 2G). The desacyl ghrelin concentration collected from portal vein of RIP-G Tg at the same time was much higher than that of nontransgenic littermates (3671.8 ± 328.6 versus 1108.0 ± 257.3 fmol/ml, n = 5, p < 0.01, Fig. 2G). The step-up of desacyl ghrelin concentration from retroorbital vein to portal vein of RIP-G Tg was significantly higher than that of nontransgenic littermates (866.3 ± 182.2 fmol/ml versus 262.9 ± 59.8 fmol/ml, p < 0.01, Fig. 2H). Plasma n-octanoylated ghrelin levels in retroorbital and portal vein of RIP-G Tg tended to be higher than those of their nontransgenic littermates (retroorbital: 78.5 ± 13.4 versus 66.1 ± 7.1 fmol/ml, n = 5, NS; portal: 104.6 ± 15.3 versus 71.4 ± 9.0 fmol/ml, n = 5, NS), but it did not reach statistical significance. We also generated RGP-G Tg, in which ghrelin expression is targeted to the pancreatic α cells (Fig. 2B). The ghrelin mRNA level Tg in pancreas of RGP-G determined by quantitative RT-PCR was about 16 times higher than that of nontransgenic littermates (16.3 ± 1.7 versus 1.0 ± 0.24 arbitrary unit, n = 5, p < 0.01). The ghrelin mRNA level in duodenum of RGP Tg was not statistically different from that of nontransgenic littermates (520.1 ± 111.1 versus 379.1 ± 37.6 arbitrary unit, n = 5, NS). The ghrelin mRNA level in brain of RGP Tg was not distinguishable from that of nontransgenic littermates (72.0 ± 6.4 versus 71.8 ± 7.8 arbitrary unit, n = 5, NS). Immunohistochemical analysis showed ghrelin-like immunoreactivity in the periphery of the pancreatic islet of RGP-ghrelin transgenic mouse by both anti-C-terminal ghrelin and anti-N-terminal ghrelin antisera (Fig. 2, E and F). The pancreatic tissue ghrelin concentrations of RGP-G Tg measured by C-RIA were about 50 times higher than those of their nontransgenic littermates (48.9 ± 2.5 fmol/mg versus 1.2 ± 0.1 fmol/mg, n = 5, p < 0.01). The pancreatic tissue ghrelin concentration of RGP-G Tg measured by N-RIA tended to be higher than that of their nontransgenic littermates (0.076 ± 0.019 fmol/mg versus 0.038 ± 0.006 fmol/mg, n = 5, NS), but it did not reach statistical significance. The plasma desacyl ghrelin concentrations in retroorbital vein were not elevated in RGP-G Tg after over night fasting compared with nontransgenic littermates (661.6 ± 38.0 versus 1024.7 ± 27.1 fmol/ml, n = 5). The portal desacyl ghrelin concentrations of RGP-G Tg were also indistinguishable from those of their nontransgenic littermate (1320.6 ± 164.7 versus 1442.9 ± 361.5 fmol/ml, n = 5, NS). Plasma n-octanoylated ghrelin levels in retroorbital and portal vein of RGP-G Tg were indistinguishable from those of their nontransgenic littermates (retroorbital: 98.3 ± 18.7 versus 133.5 ± 25.3 fmol/ml, n = 5, NS; portal: 154.3 ± 20.7 versus 198.9 ± 34.9 fmol/ml, n = 5, NS). Body Weight, Food Consumption, and Percent Body Fat— There was no significant difference in body weight and food intake between RIP-G Tg and their nontransgenic littermates (Fig. 3). Percent body fat and visceral/subcutaneous ratio of RIP-G Tg were not different from those of nontransgenic littermates (Fig. 2, C and D). No significant changes were observed in RGP-G Tg, either (data not shown). Glucose Metabolism and Insulin Secretion—Although no significant differences in blood glucose levels were noted between RIP-G Tg and their nontransgenic littermates on the fasting state and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (Fig. 4, A and C), plasma insulin levels 2 and 30 min after the glucose injection were significantly decreased in RIP-G Tg compared with those in their nontransgenic littermates (Fig. 4D). Suppression of insulin secretion was not observed in RIP-G Tg on intraperitoneal injection of arginine (Fig. 4G). Blood glucose level of RIP-G Tg in the insulin tolerance test tended to be lower than those of their nontransgenic littermates, but it did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 4H). No significant differences in blood glucose or insulin levels were observed between RGP-G Tg and their nontransgenic littermates on the fasting state, ad libitum feeding, or intraperitoneal glucose or arginine injection (Fig. 4, B, E, and F, and data not shown). Blood glucose levels on insulin tolerance test showed no differences between RGP-ghrelin and their nontransgenic littermates (data not shown). Islet Architecture and β Cell Mass—We studied the tissue sections of RIP-G Tg to explore the effect of ghrelin on the islet architecture and β cell mass. There were no obvious abnormalities in the intra islet cytoarchitecture and cell number of insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and PP cells in the islets of the RIP-G Tg (Fig. 5A–D). The intensity of staining of these four islet hormones in the islets of the RIP-G Tg was not apparently different from those of nontransgenic littermates. The ratio of the β cell area to whole pancreas was not changed significantly (Fig. 5I). We also studied the tissue sections of RGP-G Tg and found no significant differences (Fig. 5, E–H, and J). Expression of Insulin mRNA and Insulin Content—Because RIP-G Tg showed suppression of insulin secretion, we examined pancreatic mRNA expression and peptide content of insulin in RIP-G Tg and their nontransgenic littermates by Northern blot analysis and RIA. The insulin mRNA in RIP-G Tg did not diffe"
https://openalex.org/W2081143412,"The transcriptional antiterminator protein LicT regulates the expression of Bacillus subtilis operons involved in β-glucoside metabolism. It consists of an N-terminal RNA-binding domain (co-antiterminator (CAT)) and two phosphorylatable phosphotransferase system regulation domains (PRD1 and PRD2). In the activated state, each PRD forms a dimeric unit with the phosphorylation sites totally buried at the dimer interface. Here we present the 1.95 Å resolution structure of the inactive LicT PRDs as well as the molecular solution structure of the full-length protein deduced from small angle x-ray scattering. Comparison of native (inactive) and mutant (constitutively active) PRD crystal structures shows massive tertiary and quaternary rearrangements of the entire regulatory domain. In the inactive state, a wide swing movement of PRD2 results in dimer opening and brings the phosphorylation sites to the protein surface. This movement is accompanied by additional structural rearrangements of both the PRD1-PRD1 ′ interface and the CAT-PRD1 linker. Small angle x-ray scattering experiments indicate that the amplitude of the PRD2 swing might even be wider in solution than in the crystals. Our results suggest that PRD2 is highly mobile in the native protein, whereas it is locked upon activation by phosphorylation.

Protein phosphorylation is universally used as a mechanism for signal transduction in all branches of the kingdom of life (1Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2253) Google Scholar). Despite the simplicity of this chemical modification, the impact on protein structure and dynamics can be dramatic. Over the last decade, our knowledge of the structure of protein kinases and their targets has increased tremendously. In most cases, however, knowledge of the structure of the phosphorylated state of a protein remains beyond reach. This is mainly due to the difficulty of getting enough fully homogeneously phosphorylated protein for structural studies. Questions on the structural effects of phosphorylation are therefore often addressed using mutants that mimic the phosphorylated state. The expression of many catabolic operons in bacteria is controlled by (de)phosphorylation of regulatory proteins as exemplified by transcriptional antitermination. LicT from Bacillus subtilis belongs to a family of transcriptional antiterminator proteins that control the expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. LicT modulates the induction of the licS gene and the bglPH operon involved in the utilization of aryl-β-glucosides and β-glucanes (2Kruger S. Hecker M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5590-5597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Schnetz K. Stulke J. Gertz S. Kruger S. Krieg M. Hecker M. Rak B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1971-1979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other well studied members of this family are B. subtilis SacY (4Aymerich S. Steinmetz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10410-10414Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and Escherichia coli BglG (5Mahadevan S. Wright A. Cell. 1987; 50: 485-494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the absence of the “inductor” sugar, palindromic mRNA sequences (transcription terminators) located in the leader or intercistronic regions of an operon fold as stem-loop structures, causing detachment of RNA polymerase from the mRNA matrix and leading to truncated transcripts. In the presence of the “inducer” sugar, the antiterminator proteins prevent formation of these RNA terminator stem-loop structures by interacting with an antiterminator RNA sequence (RAT), 1The abbreviations used are: RAT, ribonucleotidic antiterminator; CAT, co-antiterminator; PTS, phosphotransferase system; PRD, PTS regulation domain; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering.1The abbreviations used are: RAT, ribonucleotidic antiterminator; CAT, co-antiterminator; PTS, phosphotransferase system; PRD, PTS regulation domain; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering. which partially overlaps with the terminator, hence allowing transcription through the operon (4Aymerich S. Steinmetz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10410-10414Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Antiterminator proteins from the LicT/BglG family have a modular nature (6Manival X. Yang Y. Strub M.P. Kochoyan M. Steinmetz M. Aymerich S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5019-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The RNA binding activity resides in the N-terminal domain (termed the co-antiterminator (CAT)) comprising 55 residues. Crystallographic and NMR structural studies of the CAT domain, alone or in complex with its RAT target: showed that it folds as a β-stranded homodimer (7van Tilbeurgh H. Manival X. Aymerich S. Lhoste J.M. Dumas C. Kochoyan M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5030-5036Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 8Declerck N. Dutartre H. Receveur V. Dubois V. Royer C. Aymerich S. van Tilbeurgh H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The NMR solution structure of the CAT·RAT complex elucidated how a symmetric dimer interacts with an apparently asymmetric RNA target (9Yang Y. Declerck N. Manival X. Aymerich S. Kochoyan M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1987-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the full-length protein, the ability of CAT to bind RNA and prevent the premature arrest of transcription is controlled by two contiguous regulatory domains termed PRD1 and PRD2. These domains respond to regulation signals sent by the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) (10Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each PTS regulation domain (PRDs) comprises about 100 amino acids including two highly conserved histidines. Duplicated PRDs are also found in bacterial transcriptional activators such as LevR and MtlR, which possess not an RNA-binding but a DNA-binding domain at their N terminus (11Stulke J. Arnaud M. Rapoport G. Martin-Verstraete I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In all PRD-containing regulators, the conserved histidines are substrates for reversible phosphorylation by the PTS components, HPr, and/or the sugar specific permeases, Enzymes II. These histidines are (de)phosphorylated in response to the availability of carbon sources, and their phosphorylation state determines the activation state of the transcriptional regulators. In the case of LicT, activation needs dephosphorylation on PRD1 and phosphorylation on PRD2. We have previously determined the crystal structure of the LicT regulatory domain (LicT-PRD, comprising the CAT-PRD1 linker, PRD1 and PRD2 domains) from a constitutively active double mutant (12van Tilbeurgh H. Le Coq D. Declerck N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3789-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this activated form, the two conserved histidines of PRD2 (His207 and His269) were replaced by aspartic acids. The charges introduced by these mutations yielded a functionally active mutant that was no longer subject to regulation. Each PRD consists of a five-helix bundle and forms homodimer in the activated protein. Surprisingly in this active dimer, all of the phosphorylation sites are completely buried at the center of the PRD1/PRD1′ or PRD2/PRD2′ interfaces, hence making them not available for (de)phosphorylating partners (13van Tilbeurgh H. Declerck N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Biochemical and biophysical characterization indicated that, although both the native and the activated mutant proteins are dimeric in solution, the mutations induce considerable changes in the tertiary and quaternary structure that lead to dimer rearrangement and stabilization. It was thus proposed that the activation of LicT by phosphorylation of His207 and His269 arises from a conformational switch that stabilizes an active dimeric conformation. The hypothesis was that in the native state, the protein is essentially present as an open dimer where the phosphorylatable histidines are accessible and that upon activation, long range rearrangements would be induced, burying the phosphorylated histidines at the dimer interface and stabilizing a closed conformation efficient for RNA binding. We observed, however, that upon dilution native LicT tends to dissociate into monomers, and therefore the monomeric form may precede the dimer under physiological conditions. In the present paper we have determined the crystal structure of the native, inactive form of the LicT regulatory domain. The structure shows a dramatically modified configuration of the dimer that opens up and brings the phosphorylatable PRD2 histidines to the protein surface where they become fully accessible to phosphorylating partners. This results from a wide 180° swing movement of the PRD2, which becomes monomeric within the native LicT-PRD. The opened (native) and closed (mutant) LicT-PRD conformations as observed in the respective crystal structures were confirmed by small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments, suggesting that the PRD2 swing amplitude may be larger in solution than in the crystal. Finally the overall conformation of full-length wild type or mutant LicT was investigated by SAXS experiments. Our results suggest that wild type LicT would be present in solution as a mixture of the active form and of an open form where only PRD1 is involved in dimerization. Protein Preparation and Crystallization—The native LicT-PRD protein was essentially purified as described (8Declerck N. Dutartre H. Receveur V. Dubois V. Royer C. Aymerich S. van Tilbeurgh H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cell pellets from a 250-ml culture were resuspended in 30 ml of a buffer containing 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The cells were opened by three rounds of freeze/thaw in liquid nitrogen followed by sonication. The His-tagged proteins were purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen Inc.) column. The protein was eluted with 300 mm imidazole from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, and the pooled fractions were loaded on a Superdex™ 75 (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated in 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After gel filtration, the protein fractions were pooled and concentrated to 6 mg/ml. The purity of the protein was checked by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. The selenium-methionine-labeled protein was obtained using standard procedures and purified as the native one. The crystallization of the native LicT-PRD protein was poorly reproducible, and the quality of the crystals was usually mediocre. The native crystals were obtained with the hanging drop vapor diffusion method after 3 months from a 1/1-μl mixture of protein (at 6 mg/ml in 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and crystallization liquid (0.5–0.7 m potassium acetate, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 3.4). Selenium-methionine-modified protein crystals were grown in 1 week from a 1/1-μl mixture of protein (6 mg/ml in 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and a reservoir solution of 1.0 m ammonium phosphate, pH 5.0. All of the crystallization trials were performed at 18 °C. Determination of the Structure—The data on the native crystal were collected on the ID14-EH1 beam line at the European Synchroton Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) to a resolution of 1.9 Å. All of the data were reduced using the HKL package (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38453) Google Scholar, 29Leslie A. Joint CCP4 and EACMB Newsletter Protein Crystallography. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1992Google Scholar). Although the native protein has only two different residues from the constitutively activated H207D/H269D double mutant, the structure could not be solved entirely by molecular replacement. A slightly contrasted solution was found with only the PRD1 part of the structure as a search model, using the program CNS (30Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16949) Google Scholar). This partial structure (about 40% of the total) was not sufficient to phase for the rest of the protein. We therefore prepared a selenium-methionine-labeled LicT-PRD protein sample. The selenium-labeled version of native LicT-PRD was even harder to crystallize than the native protein, and we obtained diffraction data from only one crystal. A partial (80% completed) three-wavelength multiple anomalous diffraction data set at about 2.7 Å could be collected on the French CRG BM30A beam line (European Synchroton Radiation Facility). Analysis of the anomalous Patterson maps using the SOLVE/RESOLVE program revealed four of six possible selenium positions (31Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1937-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The selenium sites from the PRD1 were compatible with methionine positions resulting from the molecular replacement solution for this domain. The resulting maps were not of sufficient quality to construct the whole LicT-PRD, but the presence of some helical regions confirmed the molecular replacement solution found for PRD1. Clear electron density was also observed for two helices of PRD2. Multiple anomalous diffraction and MR phases were combined using the CCP4 suite of programs (32Collaborative Computing Project number 4. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19734) Google Scholar). The combined maps allowed completion of the PRD2 structure. This model was then further refined against the native data. Final refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. Only very poor density was present for the region between residues 221 and 236, and these are not present in the final model. The atomic coordinates and structure factors for the native LicT-PRD structure have been deposited into the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank under the accession number 1TLV.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsNative dataSelenium edgeSelenium peakSelenium remoteWavelength (Å)0.9340.98030.98000.9825Unit cell parameters (Å)a = b = 48.73, c = 162.47a = b = 48.8, c = 166.2Resolution (Å)99-1.9025-2.6625-2.7425-2.73Number of reflections159,14322,53219,93720,391Number of unique reflections18537663360036519Rmerge (highest resolution shell)aRsym = ΣhΣi |Ihi - 〈Ih〉 |/ΣhΣiIhi, were Ihi is the ith observation of the reflection h, while 〈Ih〉 is the mean intensity of reflection h.0.036 (0.40)0.054 (0.38)0.055 (0.41)0.039 (0.55)I/σ(I) (highest resolution shell)44.7 (5.5)14.2 (2.2)14.2 (2.0)14.2 (1.7)Overall completeness (%)99.491.390.390.3RefinementResolution (Å)10-1.95Reflections (working/test)16547/821Rcryst/RfreebRfactor = Σ||Fo| - |Fc||/|Fo|.

Open table in a new tab Small Angle X-ray Scattering—Small angle x-ray scattering experiments were performed on the D24 instrument installed on the bending magnet of the storage ring Laboratoire pour l'utilisation du Rayonnement Electromagnétique (Orsay, France). The wavelength was 1.488 Å, and the sample-to-detector distance was 1.40 m. The vertical linear-sensitive position detector was shifted upwards with respect to the incident beam so that the scattered intensity for higher scattering angles could be measured. This set-up gave access to scattering vectors q ranging from 0.015 to 0.27 Å–1. The scattering vector is defined as q = 4π/λ sinθ, where 2θ is the scattering angle. Eight to sixteen frames of 200 s were recorded depending on the protein concentration. The protein solution was continuously circulated through the evacuated quartz capillary so that no radiation-induced damage was observable, and individual frames could then be averaged. Absolute calibration was made with samples of lysozyme and bovine serum albumin of known concentrations. A series of measurements at different protein concentrations ranging from 1 to 11 mg/ml were performed for each protein to check for interparticle interaction. Background scattering (buffer was 50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.0, 100 mm Na2SO4,2mm dithiothreitol, 1% (v/v) glycerol) was measured before or after each protein sample using the corresponding buffer solution and then subtracted from the protein scattering patterns after proper normalization and correction from detector response. All of the experiments were conducted at 20 °C. The theoretical scattering functions based on the atomic coordinates of the crystal structures or of models were calculated using CRYSOL (16Svergun D. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2748) Google Scholar). They were fitted to the experimental data by taking into account the excluded volume and the scattering by a hydration shell having a slightly different density than the bulk solvent. Native and Mutant LicT-PRDs Have Radically Different Structures—Several lines of evidence raised by experiments conducted in solution converged toward the hypothesis that the conformations of wild type inactive LicT and of the constitutive active LicT-H207D/H269D double mutant (or of the corresponding LicT-PRDs) are radically different (8Declerck N. Dutartre H. Receveur V. Dubois V. Royer C. Aymerich S. van Tilbeurgh H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13van Tilbeurgh H. Declerck N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). One single crystal of native LicT-PRD allowed good quality x-ray diffraction data to a resolution of 1.9 Å to be recorded (Table I). Molecular replacement using separately the structures of PRD1 and PRD2 of the double mutant as search models only gave a solution for PRD1 (comprising residues 67–166). The complete structure of LicT-PRD was finally solved by including multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion data obtained from a selenomethionine-substituted (selenium-methionine) crystal (14Hendrickson W.A. Teeter M.M. Nature. 1981; 290: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). In the final model refined to 1.95 Å resolution, the electron density of LicT-PRD is well defined except for the region comprising residues 222–235, which corresponds to the PRD2 α3 helix in the mutant. Mass spectrometry analysis proved that the crystals contain intact protein, and therefore the poor density of this region must be due to conformational mobility. In the mutant, the α3 helix is involved in dimer packing, but, as discussed further, this interface is absent in the native structure. This region seems prone to mobility, because neither residue Glu222 nor Ser223 was visible in the mutant structure. Structural Comparison of Native and Mutant LicT-PRD Monomer—LicT-PRD is made up of duplicated five-helix bundle domains (PRD1 and PRD2) connected by a short linker. In the mutant, few interactions exist between the two modules, and the monomer has an elongated shape (longest Cα distance of about 60 Å). In the native form, PRD2 closes in upon PRD1, resulting in a more compact monomer (longest Cα of about 51 Å). As represented in Fig. 1a, the overall structure of the two modules is maintained in the present native LicT-PRD (see further), but their relative orientation and position are very different compared with the mutant. The superposition of native and mutant LicT-PRD monomer structures on PRD1 very clearly illustrates the swing movement of PRD2. This drastic reorientation of PRD2 relative to PRD1 is entirely because of a change in main chain conformation of a few residues in the short connection contained between residues 165 and 170 (Fig. 1a, bottom inset). Two main switches are clearly identified: one at residues Leu165 and Asn166 whose Ramachandran (Φ, ψ) angles change, respectively, from –61°, –15° and –81°, 3° in the mutant to –94°, –179° and 57°, 51° in the native LicT-PRD and the other at residue Met169 whose (Φ, ψ) angles change from –120°, 93° in the mutant to –40°, –54° in the native structure. Through these backbone conformational changes, PRD2 rotates by 180° compared with its position in the mutant, bringing PRD2 in closer contact to PRD1 of the same monomer (Fig. 1b). This rearrangement considerably increases PRD1-PRD2 interactions through packing of hydrophobic patches on the protein surface (Leu118, Leu125, and Leu158 on PRD1 and Met169, Ile172, Ile173, Leu183, and Val205 on PRD2) and formation of new hydrogen bonds, involving Arg124/Tyr201, Tyr126/Thr176, and Glu167/Gln213. Remodeling of the Dimer—Measurements in solution (gel filtration, ultracentrifugation, and SAX) indicated that both the native and mutant LicT-PRD are dimeric but that the native dimer is less stable and less compact (8Declerck N. Dutartre H. Receveur V. Dubois V. Royer C. Aymerich S. van Tilbeurgh H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As for the mutant crystals, the native LicT-PRD dimer is generated by a crystallographic 2-fold axis. A comparison of the native and mutant LicT-PRD dimer structures is represented in Fig. 2. The mutant LicT-PRD forms an extensive dimer burying 3400 Å2 and characterized by roughly equal PRD1/PRD1′ and PRD2/PRD2′ interaction surfaces and very few PRD1/PRD2′ interactions (prime refers to the other monomer; Fig. 2b). PRD1 and PRD2 each form a quasi-independent dimeric unit with the α2 and α5 helices (containing the phosphorylation sites) from one monomer facing the corresponding helices in the other monomer. Although the PRD1/PRD1′ association is rather loose, the PRD2/PRD2′ contacts involve tight electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (see below). Although the interface of the native dimer shrunk to a value of 1707 Å2 (Fig. 2a; 50% of the buried surface of the mutant dimer), it remains within the range observed for dimers (15Lo Conte L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar). The PRD2 swing totally removes this module from the native interface, causing a complete remodeling of the corresponding native dimer, and reduces PRD2/PRD2′ interactions to packing of a small hydrophobic patch at the N terminus of the α1 helices. The PRD1/PRD1′ dimer interface has partially opened up and is only loosely stabilized by hydrophobic packing of the α2 helices. The short PRD1-PRD2 connecting segment (residues 165–170), whose change in orientation is responsible for the LicT-PRD swing, becomes inserted between the PRD1 α5 helices and forms two intermolecular salt bridges with the PRD1 α2 helices (Glu167/Arg107′ and Glu168/His100′). To accommodate the PRD1-PRD2 connecting segment at the PRD1/PRD1′ interface, one PRD1 has pivoted relative to the other and slid toward the CAT-PRD1 linker (Fig. 3a). During this sliding movement, the C terminus of the α1 helix has moved by 13 Å, and the N-terminal of the CAT-PRD1 linker has moved by 7 Å. This repositioning of the PRD1 monomers also induced side chain movements in the immediate vicinity of the phosphorylation sites (see below). PRD1/PRD2′ interactions involve the PRD1 segment comprising residues 112–125. In the mutant this segment contacts the N termini of helices α1 and α2 in PRD2′, whereas in the native form, it contacts the turns at the N termini of helices α2 and α4. Upon this rearrangement, one PRD1/PRD2′ electrostatic interaction is lost (between Glu121 and Lys209′) and one is created (between Asn216 and Asp113′). Secondary Structure Formation at the CAT-PRD1 Linker— PRD1 is connected to the RNA-binding domain through a linker region comprising residues 56–67. The electron density map of this region is well defined in both the wild type and mutant crystal structures. In the mutant, the linker contains one helical turn (residues 57–59), whereas the remaining residues adopt an extended conformation. The entire native linker (residues 56–65), however, forms an amphipatic helix. In the dimer, both linkers form an anti-parallel helical bundle through packing of their hydrophobic surfaces (Phe59, Leu62, Leu63, and Ile66), thereby considerably stabilizing the dimer interface. The linker in fact provides 30% of the total native dimer interface. In native LicT-PRD, the two linker helices lie on top of the PRD1/PRD1′ interface, against a small hydrophobic patch comprising Met71, Tyr91, and Val95 from helices α1 and α2 of both monomers. The same hydrophobic patch is contacted by the extended linker region in the mutant, but side chain interactions are totally different. Two of the hydrophobic residues forming the amphipatic helix of the native linker (Phe59 and Leu63) are partially exposed to the solvent in the mutant, whereas Tyr64, which is exposed to the solvent in the native form, is buried and makes a hydrogen bond interaction with Asp99 in the mutant form. As illustrated in the top inset of Fig. 1a, the linker radically changes direction at residue Asp65 between native and mutant LicT-PRD, repositioning it relative to PRD1. Therefore the N-terminal residue of the linker (Glu57), corresponding to the C-terminal residue of CAT has moved over a distance of 7 Å (Fig. 3a). Undoubtedly, if the same linker configurations of native and mutant LicT-PRD are present in the corresponding intact versions of LicT, this movement will certainly affect the CAT dimer (see below). Structural Changes within PRD1 and PRD2—To gain deeper insight into the structural effects of the activating mutations, we have compared native and mutant PRD1 and PRD2 individually (Fig. 3). The backbone of the five-helix bundle forming PRD1 is almost identical between the native and mutant (RMSD value of 0.6 Å for 101 Cα positions; Fig. 3b). Relevant structural changes are limited to 1) different side chain conformations occurring at residues Asp99, Phe103, Arg107, Trp120, and Arg124 and 2) the α2/α3 loop region comprising residues 109–114. All of these residues are involved in intermolecular contacts that are not maintained between the native and mutant dimers. Although the overall structure of native and mutant PRD2 is very similar, the relative positions of its helices change considerably. The best superposition of PRD2 yields a RMSD of 1.7 Å for 95 Cα positions, mainly contributed by a rigid movement of the α1/α2 helices (carrying His207) relative to the α4/α5 helices (carrying His269). The corkscrew movement of the α1 helix is a combination of a rotation around the helical axis and a translation of about 2.5 Å along the helical axis (Fig. 3c). The movement of the α2 helix is a combination of a 4 Å translation with a 15° tilt of the helical axis, loosening the packing of the α2 and α5 helices in native compared with mutant PRD2. Relevant side chain reorientations occur at positions Arg203, Phe210, Phe211, Arg214, Asp261, Tyr265, and Arg272, all located at the PRD2/PRD2′ interface in the mutant but exposed to solvent in the native form, except Phe211, whose side chain is buried in between α2 and α5. The PRD1 and PRD2 Phosphorylation Sites—The helices α2 and α5 of PRD1 and PRD2 each carry conserved histidines that are phosphorylation targets for PTS proteins (His100/His207 and His159/His269). Folding brings the phosphorylation sites in close contact within each module. In mutant PRD2, Asp207 and Asp269, corresponding to the phosphorylation sites are buried at the dimer interface and contribute to dimer formation and stabilization. Together with Arg203′, Asp207′, and Asp269′ form a tight intermolecular interaction network. In their immediate vicinity lie conserved aromatic residues (Phe210 and Tyr265), and on the edge, there is a large hydrophobic patch comprising Leu264 and Ile268 from the α5 helix and Phe227, Leu228, Val232, and Tyr235 from helix α3, whose side chains also contribute to dimer stabilization (Fig. 3c).

It is the target of the naturally occurring, broad-spectrum antibiotic fosfomycin. Fosfomycin, an epoxide, is a relatively poor drug because an ever-increasing number of bacteria have developed resistance to fosfomycin. Thus, there is a critical need for the development of novel drugs that target MurA by a different molecular mode of action. We have identified a new scaffold of potent MurA inhibitors, derivatives of 5-sulfonoxy-anthranilic acid, using high-throughput screening. T6361 and T6362 are competitive inhibitors of MurA with respect to the first substrate, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UNAG), with a Ki of 16 μm. The crystal structure of the MurA·T6361 complex at 2.6 Å resolution, together with fluorescence data, revealed that the inhibitor targets a loop, Pro112 to Pro121, that is crucial for the structural changes of the enzyme during catalysis. Thus, this new class of MurA inhibitors is not active site-directed but instead obstructs the transition from the open (unliganded) to the closed (UNAG-liganded) enzyme form.

Survival of bacteria depends on the activity of the enzyme MurA (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase, EC 2.5.1.7) (1.Brown E.D. Vivas E.I. Walsh C.T. Kolter R. J.

Hackenbeck R. Bacterial Cell Wall. 27. Elsevier, Amsterdam1994: 39-54Google Scholar, 4.van Heijenoort J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2001; 18: 503-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Because this pathway is absent from mammals, MurA is an attractive target for the development of novel antibacterial agents (5.El Zoeiby A. Sanschagrin F. Levesque R.C. Mol.

The reaction catalyzed by MurA proceeds through the chemically unusual transfer of the enolpyruvyl moiety of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) 1The abbreviations used are: PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; UNAG, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine; ANS, 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; FMOC-N-Me-l-Asp (OTBU)-OH, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-N-methyl-l-t-butoxyaspartate; FMOC-N-Me-l-Glu (OTBU)-OH, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-N-methyl-l-t-butoxyglutamate. to UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UNAG) (Fig. 1). Unlike most PEP-dependent enzymes, which use PEP as a phosphoryl donor through cleavage of the high-energy P-O bond, in this reaction the C-O bond of PEP is cleaved to transfer the enolpyruvyl moiety to a second substrate. The only other enzyme known to catalyze a similar reaction is 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EC 2.5.1.19), also known as EPSPS or AroA. 5-Enolpyruvyl shikimate-3-phosphate synthase is the sixth enzyme in the shikimate pathway toward the synthesis of aromatic amino acids in microorganisms and plants (7.Bentley R.

Widespread antibiotic resistance in many common bacterial pathogens has prompted extensive research toward the development of novel antibiotics that act by new inhibitory mechanisms. The enzymes involved in bacterial cell wall biosynthesis are ideal targets for the design of new inhibitors. The only known antibacterial drug targeting MurA is fosfomycin, the active ingredient of Monurol™ (14.Kahan F.M. Kahan J.S. Cassidy P.J. Kropp H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1974; 235: 364-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). This epoxide forms a covalent adduct with a cysteine residue, Cys115 (numbering according to Escherichia coli MurA). Cys115 is located in a solvent-exposed loop that undergoes a large conformational change upon UNAG binding; this in turn allows inactivation by fosfomycin to occur. There are three ways in which pathogenic bacteria can develop resistance to fosfomycin: (i) the resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Chlamydia to fosfomycin has been primarily attributed to the lack of Cys115 (15.De Smet K.A. Kempsell K.E. Gallagher A. Duncan K. Young D.B. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3177-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 16.Kim D.H. Lees W.J. Kempsell K.E. Lane W.S. Duncan K. Walsh C.T.

Sequencing alignments of the murA gene from other organisms suggest that the enzymes from Actinomycetales, Actinomyces, Nocardia, Streptomyces, and Borrelia also have a Cys to Asp change and are therefore suspected to be resistant to fosfomycin, too. (ii) A second mechanism of resistance is due to chromosome-encoded changes in the organisms that result in a decrease in transport of fosfomycin into the cell (18.Venkateswaran P.S. Wu H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 110: 935-944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). (iii) The plasmid-encoded fosfomycin resistance protein (FosA) is a glutathione S-transferase that inactivates fosfomycin by forming an adduct of glutathione with the epoxide (19.Arca P. Rico M.

Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11001-11003Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A small number of novel inhibitors of MurA were discovered recently by various high-throughput screening efforts in the pharmaceutical industry. Procter & Gamble compound PGE-553828 was reported to have an IC50 value of 38 μm (21.Dai H.J. Parker C.N. Bao J.J. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. App. 2001; 799: 123-132Google Scholar). Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. identified four compounds from an array of target-specific screening strains that inhibit MurA with IC50 values between 1.4 and 6.2 μm (22.DeVito J.A. Mills J.A. Liu V.G. Agarwal A. Sizemore C.F. Yao Z. Stoughton D.M. Cappiello M.G. Barbosa M.D. Foster L.A. Pompliano D.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 478-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). R. W. Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute identified three inhibitors of MurA (RWJ-3981, RWJ-110192, and RWJ-140998) with IC50 values of 0.2, 0.3, and 0.9 μm, respectively (23.Baum E.Z. Montenegro D.A. Licata L. Turchi I. Webb G.C. Foleno B.D. Bush K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 3182-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). All three compounds showed unspecific inhibition DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and apparently were not developed further. Here we elucidate the molecular mode of action of a new class of MurA inhibitors, derivatives of 5-sulfonoxy-anthranilic acid, that are not active site-directed but instead target the conformational changes of the enzyme required for catalysis. UNAG and PEP (potassium salt) were purchased from Sigma. Solvents and reagents for chemical syntheses were purchased from Aldrich, Fluka, and Fisher Scientific and used without further purification. FMOC-N-Me-l-Asp (OTBU)-OH and FMOC-N-Me-l-Glu (OTBU)-OH were from Bachem; WANG resin (theoretical load, 1.11 mmol/g) was from Novabiochem. Pierce Coomassie Blue reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard was used to determine protein concentrations. Enzyme Preparation—The plasmid containing Enterobacter cloacae MurA (pET 9d from Novagen) was transformed into BL21 DE3 E. coli competent cells. Overexpression was carried out using standard procedures at 37 °C. MurA was purified at 4 °C with an ÄKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) essentially as described previously (24.Schonbrunn E. Eschenburg S. Krekel F. Luger K. Amrhein N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2164-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). High-throughput Screening—For detection of inhibitors by high-throughput screening, 1 μg/ml recombinant MurA was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 200 μm UNAG, 50 μm PEP, and compounds from the chemical library in a 100 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) buffer, including 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5% Me2SO. The reaction was carried out in 384-well plates in a 40-μl volume. The amount of phosphate produced during the reaction was determined using the Biomol Green™ reagent (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) as recommended by the manufacturer. Chemical Syntheses—The syntheses of T6361 and T6362 (Fig. 2) were performed with 5-triisopropylsilyloxy-anthranilic acid as the scaffold. Details of the procedures are provided on-line as supplementary material. Inhibition Kinetics—Inhibition studies were performed with recombinant E. cloacae MurA at 20 °C using a Shimadzu 1650PC spectrophotometer. Kinetic data were fit to the appropriate equations using SigmaPlot. The activity of MurA was assayed by determining the amount of inorganic phosphate produced in the reaction, using the Lanzetta reagent (25.Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1819) Google Scholar). The enzyme (0.45 μm in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris, 2 mm dithiothreitol) was allowed to react for 3 min before the Lanzetta reagent (800 μl) was added, thereby stopping the reaction. Color development was stopped after 5 min by addition of 100 μl of 34% (w/v) sodium citrate. Change in optical density was measured at 660 nm, and the amount of inorganic phosphate was determined by comparison to phosphate standards. The specific activity of MurA using this assay was 4.5 μmol/min/mg. For determination of the Ki value, enzyme activities at increasing UNAG, PEP, and inhibitor concentrations were recorded, and the data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation v=Vmax×[S]Km(obs)+[S] (Eq. 1) where v is the initial velocity, Vmax is the maximum velocity, Km(obs) is the observed Michaelis constant, and [S] is the substrate concentration. The Ki value for T6362 was determined by linear regression of the replot of the Km(obs) values versus the concentration of the inhibitor [I], Km(obs)=(KmKi)×[I]+Km (Eq. 2) where Km is the true Michaelis constant and Ki is the inhibition constant. Assaying MurA pre-incubated with the inhibitor prior to the addition of substrates accounted for possible time-dependent inhibition. ANS Fluorescence Experiments—The dynamics of MurA were monitored by fluorescence using the extrinsic probe ANS essentially as described previously (11.Schonbrunn E. Svergun D.I. Amrhein N. Koch M.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24.Schonbrunn E. Eschenburg S. Krekel F. Luger K. Amrhein N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2164-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Experiments were conducted at 20 °C with a Quanta Master spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, Brunswick, NJ). The buffer used for all measurements was 50 mm sodium/potassium phosphate (pH 6.9) with 1 mm dithiothreitol. Fluorescence of ANS was excited at 366 nm, and emission spectra were recorded between 400 and 600 nm. The ANS concentration was 100 μm, the MurA concentration was 140 μg/ml (3 μm), and those of UNAG, PEP, or T6362 were varied as indicated in Figs. 4 and 5. To determine the dissociation constant of T6362, the quenched fraction (1 - FL/F0) was plotted as a function of ligand concentration (Fig. 5), where FL and F0 are the maxima of the ANS spectra in the presence and absence of ligand, respectively. Data were fit to (1−FLF0)=Ymax×[L]Kd+[L] (Eq. 3) where Ymax is the fluorescence quench at infinite ligand concentration (L), and Kd is the dissociation constant.Fig. 5Determination of the dissociation constant of T6362 by ANS fluorescence. T6362-induced fluorescence quenching is concentration-dependent. The quenching effect as a function of T6362 concentration reveals a saturation curve (inset). Data were fit to Eq. 3, yielding a Kd of 13 ± 2.7 μm, which is in the range of the Ki of 16 μm (Fig. 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) X-ray Crystallographic Analysis—MurA was concentrated to 100 mg/ml using Centricon 30 devices (Amicon) at 4 °C for crystallization. Crystals were grown at 19 °C in hanging droplets from 5% polyethylene glycol 8000, 5% polyethylene glycol 1000, 50 mm calcium acetate, 25 mm MES (pH 6.1), and 4 mm T6361. Diffraction data were recorded at -180 °C using the rotation method on a single flash-frozen crystal of MurA liganded with T6361 (detector, Mar image plate; x-rays, CuKα, focused by mirror optics; generator, Rigaku RU300 (Molecular Structure Corp., The Woodlands, TX)). Indexing, data reduction, and scaling were performed with XDS (26.Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3233) Google Scholar). The crystal lattice was indexed as space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions a = 84.1 Å, b = 134.6 Å, and c = 175.0 Å. A complete data set was collected from 16 to 2.6 Å resolution. Whereas the high-resolution data (5 to 2.6 Å) are completely consistent with the indexed space group, the low-resolution data (<5 Å) showed surprisingly bad self-consistency as reflected in the relatively high overall Rmerge/meas values (Table I) and the Wilson statistics (see supplementary material). However, the successful structure solution and refinement confirmed the chosen space group and unit cell.Table ISummary of data collection and structure refinement Values in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.Data setMurA·T6361Space groupP212121Unit cell dimensions (Å)a = 84.1, b = 134.6, c = 175.0 α = β = γ = 90°Molecules/asymmetric unit4Protein atoms12572 (average B value = 26.1 Å2)Ligand atoms184 (average B value = 43.5 Å2)Solvent molecules461 (average B value = 23.6 Å2)r.m.s.d.ar.m.s.d. from ideal values bond lengths (Å)0.01r.m.s.d. angles (°)1.53Resolution range (Å)16.0–2.6 (2.8–2.6)Measured reflections224166 (44381)Unique reflections61378 (12133)Completeness (%)99.3 (99.9)I/σ I8.7 (3.7)Rmrgd-F bRmeas and Rmrgd-F as defined by Diederichs and Karplus (38) are quality measures of the individual intensity observations and the reduced structure factor amplitudes, respectively (%)15.2 (31.0)Rmeas bRmeas and Rmrgd-F as defined by Diederichs and Karplus (38) are quality measures of the individual intensity observations and the reduced structure factor amplitudes, respectively (%)17.2 (42.1)Rcryst cRcryst = 100 × Σ|Fobs – Fmodel|/ΣFobs, where Fobs and Fmodel are observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes (%)20.9Rfree dRfree = Rcryst calculated for 1842 randomly chosen unique reflections, which were excluded from the refinement (%)25.3a r.m.s.d. from ideal valuesb Rmeas and Rmrgd-F as defined by Diederichs and Karplus (38.Diederichs K.

Sci. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement, using unliganded MurA (Protein Data Bank code 1EJC, Ref. 34.Eschenburg S. Schonbrunn E. Proteins. 2000; 40: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), stripped of solvent, as search model. Diffraction data were limited to low-resolution reflections 16.0 to 6.0 Å in the cross-rotation and translation search. From the 20 highest peaks of the cross-rotation function, one MurA molecule was placed into the asymmetric unit, and an automated translation search located a second molecule. With the generated “dimer” as search model in cross-rotation and translation searches, we could locate two other MurA molecules in the asymmetric unit. The finding of four tightly packed molecules in the asymmetric unit is a crystallization artifact; the enzyme is known to function as a monomer. Ten rounds of minimization, simulated annealing (2500 K starting temperature), and restrained individual B-factor refinement were carried out using data to highest resolution with no σ cut-off applied. Most of the protein regions were restrained exploiting the non-crystallographic symmetry between the four molecules, except for the inhibitor binding site and intermolecular contact regions. Solvent molecules were added to the model at chemically reasonable positions. The ligands were modeled according to the clear electron density map (Fig. 6). Residue 67 of each of the four MurA molecules was modeled as iso-aspartate (34.Eschenburg S. Schonbrunn E. Proteins. 2000; 40: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The protein model showed good stereochemistry with 90.6% of the 4*419 residues having ϕ/Ψ values in the most favored regions. Only two residues, Cys115 of chain B and Val122 of chain G, have values in the disallowed regions. The Ramachandran plot is shown in the supplementary material. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. Figs. 6, 7, 8 were drawn using the final coordinates of MurA (chain identifier A) with Molscript and Raster3D (29.Kraulis P.J. J.

The backbone structures of MurA liganded with T6361 (red) and UNAG (blue) are displayed. The alignment of both structures was performed using Cα atoms 300–400 of the C-terminal domain (bottom domain) with LSQKAB (39.Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; A32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2358) Google Scholar). Large differences occur in the upper, N-terminal domain of MurA, suggesting that T6361 suspends the open-closed transition that occurs as a result of the interaction of MurA with UNAG. The r.m.s.d. of all 419 Cα atoms is 2.4 Å, the r.m.s.d. of the bottom globular domain (residues 230–419) is 0.6 Å, and the r.m.s.d. of the upper globular domain (residues 20–229) is 2.1 Å.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 8Conformational flexibility of MurA.

The loop hosting Cys115 (magenta), residues Arg91 and Lys22 (cyan), and the ligands of the respective structures (yellow) is highlighted. All three ligands only bind to the open form of MurA. ANS is readily displaced by low concentrations of T6361 or UNAG, whereas T6361 is displaced by UNAG only. PEP only binds to the UNAG-liganded MurA. Note that the structural changes of the loop are unique for each of these enzyme-ligand interactions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inhibition Kinetics and Dynamics—By high-throughput screening we have discovered novel potent inhibitors of MurA. T6361 and T6362 are derivatives of 5-sulfonoxy-anthranilic acid that inhibit MurA with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. Steady-state inhibition kinetics and the dynamics of MurA were studied in detail with T6362. Inhibition is competitive with respect to UNAG (Ki = 16 μm) (Fig. 3). The influence of T6362 on the kinetics of PEP utilization was not determined because the Km of PEP is <1 μm, making kinetic evaluation with the assay employed herein unreliable. Incubation of MurA with inhibitor prior to assaying did not result in time-dependent inhibition, suggesting that it is a purely reversible inhibitor of the forward reaction of the E. cloacae MurA (data not shown). Inhibition by T6361 was competitive with respect to UNAG, too (data not shown). Next, we asked whether T6362 affects the global structural changes known to occur in MurA, i.e. the induced fit mechanism, a hallmark of the MurA reaction (11.Schonbrunn E. Svergun D.I. Amrhein N. Koch M.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 32.Schonbrunn E. Eschenburg S. Luger K. Kabsch W. Amrhein N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6345-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Using the extrinsic fluorophore ANS, we can monitor parts of the structural changes that occur during the binding of substrates (11.Schonbrunn E. Svergun D.I. Amrhein N. Koch M.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24.Schonbrunn E. Eschenburg S. Krekel F. Luger K. Amrhein N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2164-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The ANS-binding site in MurA is known in atomic detail (32.Schonbrunn E. Eschenburg S. Luger K. Kabsch W. Amrhein N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6345-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It is solvent-exposed in the open enzyme state, located at the interface of the loop hosting Cys115 and the side chain of Arg91, the latter being a strictly conserved residue. The binding of high affinity ligands, such as UNAG, destroys the ANS-binding site due to substantial conformational changes of the loop; this results in a quenching of the MurA·ANS fluorescence spectra. A series of fluorescence experiments revealed that T6362 induces structural changes in MurA similar to those observed for UNAG. The data indicate competitive binding of T6362 and UNAG to the open form of the enzyme (Fig. 4, A-D). The dissociation constant of MurA·T6362 interaction was determined to be 13 μm (Fig. 5). The second substrate, PEP, did not exert any effect on the MurA·inhibitor complex (Fig. 4, E and F), unlike the action of PEP on the MurA·UNAG complex (11.Schonbrunn E. Svergun D.I. Amrhein N. Koch M.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, upon displacement of T6362 with UNAG, the PEP-binding site becomes available again. This indicates that the enzyme either is closed (as in the MurA·UNAG·PEP complex), with some moiety of the inhibitor overlapping with the PEP-binding site, or that the enzyme·T6362 complex remains in the open state, where no PEP-binding site exists. Thus, kinetic and fluorescence data corroborate each other, in that UNAG and T6362 target the same binding site. However, the inhibitor-induced alterations are different from those induced by UNAG because PEP cannot interact with the enzyme·inhibitor complex. The data suggested that this inhibitor class binds to the open MurA form, exerting its inhibitory action by obstructing the structural changes of the enzyme needed for catalysis. We addressed this issue by determining the structure of the MurA·T6361 complex. MurA·Inhibitor Complex—E. cloacae MurA crystallized with four molecules of the MurA·T6361 complex in the asymmetric unit, and the structure was determined at 2.6 Å resolution. T6361 binds to the open form of MurA in a solvent-exposed region, spanning the loop Pro112-Pro121, which hosts the fosfomycin target Cys115 (40.Eschenburg S. Priestman M.A. Schonbrunn E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3757-3763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and residues of the interdomain section (Figs. 6, 7, 8). The electron density of T6361 is well defined in all four MurA molecules, except for part of its carboxylate side chain, which is solvent-exposed and does not interact with enzyme residues. All residues interacting with T6361 belong to the N-terminal (upper) globular domain of MurA (Fig. 6). T6361 appears to bind to the enzyme primarily through hydrophobic forces (criterion: distance = 4 ± 0.4 Å): the two naphthalene rings interact with Arg91/Pro121/Val122/Ile94/Pro112 and Asn23/Trp95/Val163, respectively. The benzene ring interacts with Trp95 and Arg91. The side chains of Lys22, Arg91, and His125 are involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with T6361 oxygen atoms. In addition, two water molecules appear to bridge T6361 oxygen atoms and the main chain amides of Arg91, Ala92, and Gly164. The mode of binding of T6361 to the loop is similar to that observed for the interaction of MurA with ANS, notably, the simultaneous existence of hydrophobic and electrostatic forces with Arg91 (32.Schonbrunn E. Eschenburg S. Luger K. Kabsch W. Amrhein N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6345-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Whereas the hydrophobic interaction of the one naphthalene moiety with Arg91 and a proline (Pro112) is also realized in the MurA·ANS structure, the hydrophobic interaction capacity of the other naphthalene with Asn23 was unexpected (Fig. 6) Like ANS, T6361 induces a conformational change in the Pro112-Pro121 loop (Figs. 7 and 8). Thus, T6361-dependent quenching of ANS fluorescence may be interpreted as competition for binding to Arg91. Arg91 is not involved in substrate binding once the active site has been created (33.Eschenburg S. Kabsch W. Healy M.L. Schonbrunn E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49215-49222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), but it is possibly involved in the open-closed transition of the enzyme (32.Schonbrunn E. Eschenburg S. Luger K. Kabsch W. Amrhein N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6345-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thus, T6361 might prevent Arg91 from forming a collision complex with UNAG and conducting its role in the induced fit mechanism. The other strictly conserved residue interacting with T6361 is Lys22. The precise role of Lys22 in catalysis is not understood and is a matter of debate (33.Eschenburg S. Kabsch W. Healy M.L. Schonbrunn E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49215-49222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 35.An M. Toochinda T. Bartlett P.A. J. Org.

Biochem. 2004; 271: 2682-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the ligand-free state of MurA, Lys22 electrostatically interacts with Asp49 (10.Schonbrunn E. Sack S. Eschenburg S. Perrakis A. Krekel F. Amrhein N. Mandelkow E. Structure. 1996; 4: 1065-1075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This salt bridge is disrupted upon the transition of the enzyme to the closed state, and Lys22 instead interacts with the UNAG and PEP moieties of the genuine tetrahedral intermediate (33.Eschenburg S. Kabsch W. Healy M.L. Schonbrunn E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49215-49222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, Lys22 may have a dual function in the enzymatic reaction, the triggering of the open-closed transition upon substrate binding, followed by its participation in catalysis. Apparently, T6361 obstructs the side chain conformational changes of Lys22 that occur during the reaction with substrates. In essence, T6361 appears to block the induced fit mechanism of the enzyme, and the enzyme remains in its open state (Figs. 7 and 8). As a result, interaction of PEP with the MurA·T6361 complex does not occur (Fig. 5) because the inhibitor blocks the formation of the PEP-binding site, which is present only in the closed enzyme state (33.Eschenburg S. Kabsch W. Healy M.L. Schonbrunn E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49215-49222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The molecular mode of action of this new class of inhibitors on MurA provides valuable insights with respect to the structural prerequisites for the induced fit mechanism in catalysis. T6361 appears to inhibit the structural changes leading to the closed MurA state, primarily through its interaction with Lys22, Arg91, and the loop around Cys115. Because T6361 binding to MurA is competitive with UNAG yet not active site-directed, its binding site may represent part of the collision complex between MurA and UNAG that must exist in the open enzyme. Therefore, T6361 bound to MurA may present an attractive starting point for the design of small molecules specifically targeting the conformational switch. However, a major obstacle in the rational design of such inhibitors is that the loop and the side chains of Lys22 and Arg91 undergo drastic conformational changes as a result of different enzyme-ligand interactions. Such structural alterations cannot be predicted by commonly employed computational methods, thus reinforcing the need for the continual structure elucidation of various MurA·inhibitor complexes for future rational drug design approaches."

We have reported that expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is increased in the myocardium of diabetic mice. Now we showed that the increase in CTGF expression in cardiac tissues of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats was reversed by captopril and islet cell transplantation. Infusion of AngII in rats increased CTGF mRNA expression by 15-fold, which was completely inhibited by co-infusion with AT1 receptor antagonist, candesartan. Similarly, incubation of cultured cardiomyocytes with AngII increased CTGF mRNA expression by 2-fold, which was blocked by candesartan and a general PKC inhibitor, GF109203X. The role of PKC isoform-dependent action was further studied using adenoviral vector-mediated gene transfer of dominant negative (dn) PKC or wild type PKC isoforms. Expression of dnPKCα, -ϵ, and -ζ isoforms suppressed AngII-induced CTGF expression in cardiomyocytes. In contrast, expression of dominant negative PKCδ significantly increased AngII-induced CTGF expression, whereas expression of wild type PKCδ inhibited this induction. This inhibitory effect was further confirmed in the myocardium of transgenic mice with cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of PKCδ (δTg mice). Thus, AngII can regulate CTGF expression in cardiomyocytes through a PKC activation-mediated pathway in an isoform-selective manner both in physiological and diabetic states and may contribute to the development of cardiac fibrosis in diabetic cardiomyopathy.

In contrast, expression of dominant negative PKCδ significantly increased AngII-induced CTGF expression, whereas expression of wild type PKCδ inhibited this induction. This inhibitory effect was further confirmed in the myocardium of transgenic mice with cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of PKCδ (δTg mice). Thus, AngII can regulate CTGF expression in cardiomyocytes through a PKC activation-mediated pathway in an isoform-selective manner both in physiological and diabetic states and may contribute to the development of cardiac fibrosis in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Myocardial pathologies in diabetic patients include diastolic dysfunction, microvascular disease, and interstitial fibrosis, which could be the result of active tissue remodeling that can contribute to the reduced cardiac contractility (1Bell D.S. Diabetes Care. 1995; 18: 708-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The increase in myocardial fibrosis is part of a pro-fibrotic state associated with the pathogenesis of diabetic complications (2Roy S. Sala R. Cagliero E. Lorenzi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 3Spiro M.J. Crowley T.J.

We have reported that the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is increased in the myocardium of rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes and in mice engineered to overexpress PKCβ2 in the myocardium, preceding the increased expression of TGFβ1 (4Way K.J. Isshiki K. Suzuma K. Yokota T. Zvagelsky D. Schoen F.J. Sandusky G.E. Pechous P.A. Vlahos C.J. Wakasaki H. King G.L. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2709-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). CTGF has been implicated to have diverse biological actions including the regulation of fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis, and cellular apoptosis (5Brigstock D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 189-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Its role in the regulation of fibrosis in tissues such as the retina, heart, aorta, lung, and kidney, in diabetes, and in other pathological conditions is beginning to be recognized (6Blom I.E. Goldschmeding R. Leask A. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that CTGF is an essential mediator for the biological actions of TGFβ1 and bone morphogenetic protein (7Abreu J.G. Ketpura N.I. Reversade B. De Robertis E.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), possibly via the modulation of the cytokine interaction with their cell surface receptors (7Abreu J.G. Ketpura N.I. Reversade B. De Robertis E.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Although a cell surface receptor mediating CTGF-induced biological responses has not been identified, tyrosine phosphorylation of low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein after its binding by CTGF with high affinity has been reported (8Segarini P.R.

Increased expression of CTGF has been reported in multiple fibrotic diseases such as renal (10Wang S. Denichilo M. Brubaker C. Hirschberg R.

Multiple extracellular stimuli have been reported to regulate the expression of CTGF including mechanical stretch, growth factors, and cytokines such as TGFβ1 (6Blom I.E. Goldschmeding R. Leask A. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), vascular endothelial cell growth factor (15Suzuma K. Naruse K. Suzuma I. Takahara N. Ueki K. Aiello L.P. King G.L. J. Biol.

Ruiz-Ortega M. Circulation. 2003; 108: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Suppression of AngII action is beneficial in preserving cardiac or renal functions after myocardial ischemia and chronic hyperglycemia in diabetes (17Zuanetti G. Latini R. Maggioni A.P. Franzosi M. Santoro L. Tognoni G. Circulation. 1997; 96: 4239-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). AngII, a vasotropic hormone generated by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) from angiotensinogen (18Feener E.P. Johnstone M.T. Veves A. Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 103-121Google Scholar), may play an active role in tissue remodeling and the regulation of fibrosis. AngII binds to two types of G protein-coupled cell membrane receptors, AT1R and AT2R (19Berry C. Touyz R. Dominiczak A.F. Webb R.C. Johns D.G. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 281: 2337-2365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to elicit biological actions such as vasoconstriction, myocyte apoptosis and hypertrophy, sodium and water retention, and gene expression (20Pratt R.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 120-128PubMed Google Scholar). Among the multiple signaling pathways that are known to mediate AngII action, protein kinase C (PKC) has been shown to be activated in cardiomyocytes, although the specificities of the various PKC isoforms to propagate AngII effects are yet to be determined (21Malhotra A. Kang B.P. Cheung S. Opawumi D. Meggs L.G. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1918-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22Shimoni Y. Liu X.F. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ.

Cardiol. 2003; 35: 1349-1358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). AngII has been shown to increase the expression of CTGF in vivo, potentially through a calcineurin-mediated pathway (16Ruperez M. Lorenzo O. Blanco-Colio L.M. Esteban V. Egido J. Ruiz-Ortega M. Circulation. 2003; 108: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 24Finckenberg P. Inkinen K. Ahonen J. Merasto S. Louhelainen M. Vapaatalo H. Muller D. Ganten D. Luft F. Mervaala E. Am.

The regulation of CTGF expression by PKC activation has not been fully characterized except for studies showing that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), an analogue of DAG and activator of conventional and novel PKC isoforms, can suppress CTGF expression in cultured fibroblasts (25Fan W.H. Karnovsky M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have reported that CTGF expression was increased in the myocardium of the cardiac PKCβ2 transgenic mice, preceding the increases of TGFβ2 expression (4Way K.J. Isshiki K. Suzuma K. Yokota T. Zvagelsky D. Schoen F.J. Sandusky G.E. Pechous P.A. Vlahos C.J. Wakasaki H. King G.L. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2709-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that PKC isoforms may have different effects on CTGF expression at basal states or after its activation by AngII. We have, therefore, investigated the role for a PKC isoform-dependent pathway in AngII-induced CTGF expression in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, the regulation of CTGF expression specifically by PKCδ isoform activation after AngII stimulation was also examined directly in vivo and in vitro by using transgenic mice with targeted overexpression of PKCδ to the myocardium and adenoviral vectors overexpressing a wild type or a dominant negative isoform of PKCδ in cardiomyocytes. Isolation and Culture of Neonatal Rat Cardiomyocytes—Primary culture of neonatal rat cardiomyocyte were prepared as described previously (26Chou E. Suzuma I. Way K.J. Opland D. Clermont A.C. Naruse K. Suzuma K. Bowling N.L. Vlahos C.J. Aiello L.P. King G.L. Circulation. 2002; 105: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). A total of 8 × 106 cells was plated onto 100-mm culture dishes precoated with gelatin in DMEM-F-12 medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% horse serum and 100 μmol/liter bromodeoxyuridine (Sigma). Cardiomyocytes were allowed to attach to the plate wall and were then serum-deprived for 48 h in DMEM-F-12 media containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Cells were then stimulated with 100 nm AngII (Sigma) dissolved in serum free DMEM-F-12 media containing 0.1% BSA with or without pretreatment with 1 μm candesartan (CV 11974, kindly provided by Dr. Peter Morsing, Astra Hassle AB, Mölndal, Sweden) or 5 μm GF109203X (Calbiochem) 30 min before the addition of AngII. Adenovirus Infection and AngII Stimulation—Adenoviral vectors containing green fluorescent protein (GFP, Ad-GFP) and dominant negative PKC isoforms including -α (dnPKCα), -β2 (dnPKCβ2), -δ (dnPKCδ), ϵ (dnPKCϵ), and ζ (dnPKCζ) were constructed and used to infect cardiomyocytes as we have reported previously in various vascular cells and pancreatic β cells (27Suzuma K.

Briefly, cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were infected with Ad-GFP, dnPKCα, dnPKCβ2, dnPKCδ, dnPKCϵ, and dnPKCζ at a multiplicity of infection of 2 in serum-free media for 2 h in a 37 °C incubator supplemented with 5% CO2. The cells were then grown in media containing 5% horse serum for an additional 16 h in the incubator. Media containing adenovirus were removed and cells rinsed with ice-cold PBS twice and grown in serum-free DMEM-F-12 media supplemented with 0.1% BSA for an additional 48 h. Cells were then incubated with 100 nm AngII dissolved in serum-free DMEM-F-12 media containing 0.1% BSA for 2 h. Infectivity of these adenoviruses was evaluated by the percentage of green light-emitting cells under a fluorescent microscope (Nikon, Avon, MA). The presence of ∼80% of GFP-positive cells was considered to be a successful infection and used for further experimentation. Generation of Transgenic Mice Overexpressing PKCδ in the Myocardium—Mice were engineered to overexpress PKCδ using a method described previously (29Wakasaki H. Koya D. Schoen F.J. Jirousek M.R.

A 2031-bp BamH1-EcoR1 (blunted with Klenow) human PKCδ cDNA fragment was inserted in the BamH1-ScaI site of the pBK-CMV vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The vector was linearized with SalI (blunted) and ligated downstream to a 3.3-kilobase EagI-SalI fragment (blunted) containing the rat α-myosin heavy chain promoter (p-2936++, provided by Dr. G. I. Fishman) (29Wakasaki H. Koya D. Schoen F.J. Jirousek M.R. Ways D.K. Hoit B.D. Walsh R.A. King G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9320-9325Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). This in turn was located upstream of the SV40 poly(A) site. The recombinant plasmid pBK-CMV-αMHC-PKCδ was digested with SacI and MluI to generate a linear fragment for microinjection into pronuclei of fertilized FVB/NCrl mouse eggs that were then implanted into pseudo-pregnant FVB foster mother mice (29Wakasaki H.

Successful gene transfer was determined by Southern blot analysis of tail genomic DNA using a full-length NheI PKCδ cDNA fragment from pSVHNX-neo-PKCδ expression vector (provided by Dr. A. E. Reifel-Miller) labeled with [α32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (29Wakasaki H. Koya D. Schoen F.J. Jirousek M.R. Ways D.K. Hoit B.D. Walsh R.A. King G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Heterozygous transgenic mice and non-transgenic littermate control mice were used at ages indicated under “Results.” Histological Analysis—Hearts were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, bisected transversely at the midventricular level, and embedded in paraffin. Sections (∼5 μm thick) were made from the mid-ventricle and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and with Masson's trichrome stain at the Histology core of Joslin Diabetes Center. Ventricular fibrosis was measured using sections stained with Masson's trichrome. AngII Infusion in Vivo—A catheter was securely inserted into the left jugular vein of male Sprague-Dawley rats (pentobarbital 0.5 mg/10 g of body weight, intraperitoneal) and mice (0.1 ml/10 g of body weight of a mixture of 10 mg/ml xylazine and 20 mg/ml ketamine, intramuscular). Animals were allowed to recover for at least 18 h, and awakened animals were then administered an intravascular infusion of saline alone (control) or saline containing AngII and/or candesartan. The infusion rates were 100 ng·kg–1·min–1 AngII and 25 μg· kg–1·min–1 candesartan (a 50-fold molar excess over Ang II) at 10 μl/min for the rats and 0–25 ng·kg–1·min–1 AngII for the mice. After 2 h of infusion, animals were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation. The ventricles of these animals were quickly excised and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and immediately stored at –80 °C until use. Induction of Diabetes—Diabetes was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by single intraperitoneal STZ injection (60 mg/kg) as described (4Way K.J. Isshiki K. Suzuma K. Yokota T. Zvagelsky D. Schoen F.J.

After 4 weeks of diabetes, islet cell transplantation (ICT) was performed by Jennifer Lock in Dr. Gordon Weir's laboratory at the Joslin Diabetes Center. Briefly, islet cells (3000) were isolated from healthy donor rats and transplanted under the left kidney capsule of a recipient rat (30Napoli R. Davalli A.M. Hirshman M.F. Weitgasser R. Weir G.C.

RNA was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nylon membrane that was subsequently probed with a cDNA probe against CTGF as described (4Way K.J. Isshiki K. Suzuma K. Yokota T.

Expression of acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein (36B4) or TATA-binding protein (TBP) RNA levels was determined by Northern blot analysis with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. Levels of mRNA were visualized and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences). In some experiments real time reverse transcription-PCR was used to assess the mRNA expression of CTGF and collagen IV. cDNA sequence of rodent CTGF (NM_022266) and collagen IV (J04694) were used to design primers and probes labeled with FAM at its 5′ end and TAMRA at its 3′ end (Proligo). The primer and probe sequences used to amplify CTGF and collagen IV are shown as follows: CTGF 5′ primer (5′-GAGGAAAACATTAAGAAGGGCAAA-3′), probe (5′-6FAM-TTTGAGCTTTCTGGCTGCACCAGTGT-TAMRA-3′), and 3′ primer (5′-CGGCACAGGTCTTGATGA-3′); collagen IV 5′ primer (5′-GCAACGGTACAAAGGGAGAGAG-3′), probe (5′-6FAM-CGCTCGGTCCTCCTGGCTTGC-TAMRA-3′), and 3′ primer (5′-CTTCATTCCTGGTAACCCTGGTG-3′). Quantitative real time PCR was performed using the ABI Prism™ 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primers and probes were used at a concentration of 200 and 100 nm, respectively for sequence amplification. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed using the following parameters: 48 °C for 30 min, 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. Relative quantifications of gene expression were calculated using internal control normalization to 18 S ribosomal RNA (Applied Biosystems). Protein Extraction and Fractionation—Proteins were extracted from tissues and cells according to previously established methods (29Wakasaki H. Koya D. Schoen F.J. Jirousek M.R. Ways D.K. Hoit B.D. Walsh R.A. King G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9320-9325Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Briefly, tissues were crushed into frozen powder and homogenized in a pre-chilled buffer containing 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.33 m sucrose, 25 μg/ml leupeptin with a Polytron and further with a Dounce homogenizer. Tissue lysates were spun at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was retained as the cytosolic fraction, and the pellets were re-suspended in 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% Triton X-100 to extract membranous fraction. After rotating for 45 min at 4 °C, soluble membrane fractions were obtained by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Both the cytosolic and membranous fractions were further examined for protein expression of different isoforms of PKC and PKC kinase activity. PKC Kinase Assay—PKC activity was measured in proteins isolated from both the membranous and cytosolic fractions of the myocardium as previously described (29Wakasaki H. Koya D. Schoen F.J. Jirousek M.R. Ways D.K. Hoit B.D. Walsh R.A. King G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9320-9325Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 31Oliver F.J. de la Rubia G. Feener E.P.

Proteins were concentrated using a DEAE Sephacel column (Amersham Biosciences) and then eluted with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% Triton X-100. PKC kinase activity was measured and defined as the transfer of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP into the Thr residue of a synthetic peptide (Arg-Lys-Arg-Thr-Leu-Arg-Arg-Leu), mimicking the substrate sequence specific to PKC stimulated by Ca2+, phosphatidylserine, and diacylglycerol (31Oliver F.J. de la Rubia G.

Western Blotting Analysis—Fifty μg of denatured proteins were electrophoresed on pre-casted 10% Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen) for 2 h by 200 volts and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). The membranes were then blocked with 5% BSA at 4 °C overnight and then hybridized with polyclonal antibodies against different isoforms of PKC including α, β1, β2, ϵ, and ζ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for at least 1 h at room temperature. After three consecutive washings of 10 min using PBS-T buffer, the membranes were further incubated with secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for another hour. The blot was then washed three times with PBS for 10 min each, and a hybridization signal was visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—All results were expressed as mean ± S.D. Differences between groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance with a post-hoc test using Student-Newman-Keul analysis. Comparison of the mean values between two groups was performed using unpaired Student t test. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Effect of ACEI on CTGF Gene Expression in the Myocardium of Diabetic Rats—The effect of ACEI inhibition on CTGF mRNA expression was assessed in myocardium from STZ-induced diabetic rats since we have previously reported that CTGF expression in the myocardium of diabetic rodents was increased (4Way K.J. Isshiki K. Suzuma K. Yokota T. Zvagelsky D. Schoen F.J. Sandusky G.E. Pechous P.A. Vlahos C.J. Wakasaki H. King G.L. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2709-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). After 4 weeks of diabetes, subsets of diabetic rats were randomly assigned to an untreated group, ACEI (captopril 1 mg/ml in drinking water)-treated group, or ICT group for an additional 4 weeks. At the end of this study, a 2.8-fold increase in CTGF expression was observed in the myocardium from rats with 8 weeks duration of diabetes as compared with the control rats receiving injections of vehicle solutions (p < 0.01 versus CTL, n = 6, Fig. 1). ICT, which maintained euglycemic control in diabetic rats, reversed the increased CTGF mRNA expression (p < 0.05 versus DM; p > 0.05 versus CTL, n = 6, Fig. 1). Treatment with ACEI for 4 weeks significantly reduced cardiac CTGF expression to a level comparable with that achieved by ICT (p < 0.05 versus DM, Fig. 1) without reducing blood glucose levels (538 ± 187 mg/dl) as compared with the untreated diabetic rats (456 ± 279 mg/dl, p > 0.05, n = 6). ACEI did not alter body weights in diabetic rats (212.5 ± 39.9 g) when compared with untreated diabetic rats (224.9 ± 38.7g, p > 0.05, n = 6). However, ACEI reduced systolic blood pressure from 132.8 ± 4.7 mm Hg (CTL) to 112.5 ± 10.6 mm Hg (ACEI, p < 0.005, n = 6), whereas neither DM (137.5 ± 3.9 mmHg) nor ICT (129.3 ± 4.5 mmHg) altered blood pressure as compared with that of the control rats (p > 0.05, n = 6). Regulation of CTGF Expression by AngII through a AT1 Receptor-dependent Pathway in Vivo—The direct effect of AngII on the induction of CTGF mRNA expression in the myocardium was studied in vivo in both mice and rats without diabetes. AngII, which was infused into mice intrajugularly at increasing doses of 0–25 ng·kg–1 ·min–1 for 2 h, enhanced the expression of CTGF mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner with a 4-fold induction at 25 ng·kg–1·min–1 (p < 0.05 versus 0ng· kg–1·min–1, n = 4, Fig. 2A). Similarly, intrajugular infusion of AngII to rats at a rate of 100 ng·kg–1·min–1 for 2 h also increased the expression of CTGF by ∼15-fold (p < 0.001 versus vehicle-infused control, n = 4, Fig. 2B). Cell membrane receptors mediated the AngII effect on CTGF expression were examined further using candesartan, an AT1 receptor-selective inhibitor. Co-infusion of candesartan at a rate of 25 mg·kg–1·min–1 abolished AngII-induced CTGF gene expression (Fig. 2B), whereas infusion of candesartan alone did not alter basal CTGF expression in the myocardium (p > 0.05 versus saline-infused controls, Fig. 2B). Effect of AngII on CTGF Expression in Cultured Cardiomyocytes—To determine whether AngII can directly regulate CTGF expression independent of its effect on blood pressure regulation, we characterized the AngII effect on cultured cardiomyocytes. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM) were isolated and stimulated with AngII (100 nm) for 2 h in culture after serum starvation. As shown in Fig. 3, CTGF mRNA expression increased by 2-fold (p < 0.05, n = 4) after AngII stimulation. The induction of ctgf gene expression was prevented by preincubating cells with 1 μm candesartan (p < 0.05 versus AngII, n = 4, Fig. 3), similar to that observed in vivo. Candesartan alone did not affect basal CTGF mRNA expression in cardiomyocytes (Fig. 3). Effect of PKC Activation on AngII-induced CTGF Expression in Cardiomyocytes—Because we have previously reported that targeted overexpression of PKCβ2 in the myocardium induced CTGF expression and severe fibrosis (4Way K.J.

https://openalex.org/W2075834144,"Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) has been identified as a Wnt co-receptor involved in the activation of the β-catenin signaling pathway. To improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which LRP5 triggers the canonical Wnt signaling cascade, we have screened for potential partners of LRP5 using the yeast two-hybrid system and identified Frat1 as a protein interacting with the cytoplasmic domain of LRP5. We demonstrate here that LRP5/Frat1 interaction is involved in β-catenin nuclear translocation and TCF-1 transcriptional activation. The addition of Wnt3a or overexpression of constitutively active truncated LRP5 (LRP5C) induces Frat1 recruitment to the cell membrane. Overexpression of a dominant negative form of disheveled (Dvl) shows that this protein positively affects LRP5/Frat1 interaction. Furthermore, the fact that dominant negative Dvl does not interfere with LRP5C/Frat1 interaction can explain how LRP5C is capable of acting independently of this major Wnt signaling player. Axin, which has been shown to interact with LRP5 and to be recruited to the membrane through this interaction, was found to co-immunoprecipitate with Frat1 and LRP5. We propose that recruitment of Axin and Frat1 to the membrane by LRP5 leads to both Axin degradation and Frat1-mediated inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3. As a consequence, β-catenin is no longer bound to Axin or phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3, resulting in TCF-1 activation.

Wnts are cysteine-rich secreted proteins involved in a wide range of developmental processes such as embryonic axis specification and organogenesis (1.Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). Wnts appear to activate a variety of signaling pathways both in vertebrates and in invertebrates. In the so-called “canonical” Wnt/β-catenin pathway, the interaction between Wnt and frizzled receptors leads to inactivation of the kinase GSK-3β. 1The abbreviations used are: GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; Y2H, yeast two-hybrid; Wnt3a-CM, Wnt3a-conditioned medium; IP, immunoprecipitation; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; Y2H, yeast two-hybrid; Wnt3a-CM, Wnt3a-conditioned medium; IP, immunoprecipitation; GFP, green fluorescent protein. Genetic epistasis experiments suggest that disheveled lies upstream and represses the activity of GSK-3β. As a consequence, β-catenin is stabilized in the cytoplasm and then forms a complex with TCF/LEF to activate transcription of target genes. Frizzled proteins have been shown to function as Wnt receptors (2.Bhanot P. Brink M. Samos C.H. Hsieh J.C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar), and they constitute a large family of seven transmembrane receptors with at least 10 members in mammals (2.Bhanot P. Brink M.

Schioth H.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1256-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar). All frizzled receptors have a conserved extracellular cysteine-rich domain followed by seven putative transmembrane segments. Their cytoplasmic regions differ in length and sequence. Functional analyses in Drosophila and Xenopus embryos indicate that frizzled proteins have distinct functions in Wnt/β-catenin signaling (4.Sheldahl L.C. Park M. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). More recently, members of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein family (LRP) have been shown to be co-receptors for Wnt ligands (5.Mao J. Wang J. Liu B. Pan W. Farr G.H. Flynn C.

The two closely related proteins LRP5 and LRP6 are single-pass transmembrane receptors that associate with frizzled receptors in a Wnt-dependent manner. There is an increasing body of evidence showing that LRP5/6 are required for Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Beside Wnts, dickkopf proteins (Dkk), mainly Dkk1, Dkk2, and Dkk4, were also shown to bind with high affinity to LRP5/6 and to inhibit Wnt canonical signaling (6.Mao B. Wu W. Li Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 10.Semenov M.V. Tamai K. Brott B.K. Kuhl M. Sokol S. He X. Curr.

Nature. 1998; 391: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that modulating LRP5/6 receptor activity by extracellular ligands like Wnts or Dkks leads respectively to the activation or inhibition of β-catenin signaling pathway, it is unclear how these receptors triggers the signaling cascade in the intracellular compartment. Although it has been previously demonstrated that LRP5/6 interacts with Axin (5.Mao J. Wang J. Liu B. Pan W. Farr G.H. Flynn C. Yuan H. Takada S. Kimelman D. Li L. Wu D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 801-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), this interaction only in part explains the mechanism by which this receptor regulates the β-catenin pathway. In the present report we have used the intracellular cytoplasmic domain of LRP5 to screen for potential partners using the yeast two-hybrid system. Our screen led us to the identification of Frat1 as an LRP5-interacting protein. We demonstrate that LRP5 and Frat1 interact in cells and cooperate to induce β-catenin signaling. In addition, we present data suggesting that Frat1 activity is dependent on LRP5 expression. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The Matchmaker yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system and the mouse 11- and 19-day embryo cDNA libraries were purchased from Clontech. The bait for library screening was the intracellular domain of LRP5 (1419–1615 residues). Y2H screening was carried out as suggested by the manufacturer. The interaction of the target proteins was determined phenotypically by growing of yeast clones on His-deficient medium and by measuring β-galactosidase activity. For a first confirmation of interaction with target proteins both bait and prey constructs were retrieved from the yeast clone of interest (as described by the manufacturer), reintroduced again in the same yeast strain, and assayed for their ability to grow on His-deficient medium and to induce β-galactosidase activity. To further confirm interactions, bait and prey cDNAs were removed from their original plasmids, recloned using appropriate restriction sites in prey and bait plasmids, respectively, reintroduced in the same yeast strain, and confirmed for their ability to grow on His-deficient medium and to induce β-galactosidase activity. Wnt3a-conditioned Medium Preparation—Wnt3a-conditioned medium (Wnt3a-CM) was prepared as described by Shibamoto et al. (13.Shibamoto S. Higano K. Takada R. Ito F. Takeichi M. Takada S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Briefly, Wnt3a-producing L cells were seeded at a density of 6 × 106 cells in a 125-cm2 flask containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. 24 h after this, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% fetal calf serum, and cells were cultured for 3 days. After harvesting, Wnt3a-CM was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min and filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane. The activity of Wnt3a-CM was assayed on L cells by examining the increase in β-catenin as described by Willert et al. (14.Willert K. Shibamoto S. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1768-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Wnt3a-CM was added to cells at a 20% final concentration in all experiments. Plasmids and Constructs—Myc-tagged LRP5 was previously described (15.Gong Y. Slee R.B. Fukai N. Rawadi G. Roman-Roman S. Reginato A.M. Wang H. Cundy T. Glorieux F.H. Lev D. Zacharin M. Oexle K.

LRP5- and LRP6-derived truncated constructs were amplified by PCR and fused to the indicated tag-epitope into pcDNA3.1 vector. β-Catenin, disheveled, and Wnt3a cDNAs were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR and confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Isolated sequences were tagged with the appropriate epitope and subcloned into the expression plasmid pcDNA3.1. The dominant negative form of disheveled (Xdd) was generated as described previously (16.Sokol S. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1456-1467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 17.Yanagawa S. van Leeuwen F. Wodarz A. Klingensmith J. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Stable mutant β-catenin (β-catenin*) was generated as described by Morin et al. (18.Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3501) Google Scholar). Axin expression vector was kindly provided Dr. D. L. Shi (CNRS, France). The Flag-Frat1 expression construct was kindly provided by Dr. E. Fraser (Institute of Cancer Research, United Kingdom), and the dominant negative form, Frat1N, was generated as described by Li et al. (19.Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J. Farr III, G.H. Sussman D.J. Jonkers J. Kimelman D. Wu D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4233-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The expression of all tagged expression constructs was confirmed by Western blotting. Cell Cultures and Transfection—COS-7 monkey kidney cells (ATCC) and mouse fibroblast L cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Mesenchymal mouse C3H10T1/2 cells were grown in α-modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated in 24-well plates at 4 × 10 cells/well 24 h prior to transfection, then transiently transfected with the indicated construct (1-μg total DNA) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 18 h after transfection, cells were washed and cultured in medium at 2% fetal calf serum for an additional 48 h under the indicated conditions. Cells were then collected for luciferase assays, immunoprecipitation, or Western blotting. When luciferase reporters were used, 20 ng of pRL-TK (Promega) encoding a Renilla luciferase gene downstream of a minimal herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase promoter was systematically added to the transfection mix to assess transfection efficiency. Luciferase was determined by using Dual Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western Blot and Immunoprecipitation Assay—For Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation (IP), transiently transfected cells were harvested and lysed with M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce). Total protein content in cell lysates was estimated using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). To control protein expression, 10 μg of total protein were loaded on NuPAGE 4–12% (Invitrogen). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred on Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and revealed with either horseradish peroxidase anti-FLAG (Sigma), horseradish peroxidase anti-c-Myc (Roche Diagnostics), horseradish peroxidase anti-GFP (Abcam), or anti-disheveled (rabbit polyclonal antibody, Chemicon). Anti-disheveled was detected using a secondary horseradish peroxidase anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection according to the manufacturer (ECL+ Amersham Biosciences). IP was carried out on 500 μg of total protein. Total proteins were incubated with 50 μl of μMacsprotein G microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) and 2 μg of indicated anti-epitope antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the microcolumn with hot denaturant gel loading buffer and then subjected to Western blotting as described above. Confocal Microscopy Assay—C3H10T1/2 cells were plated at 40,000 cells/well in a 6-wells plate with each well containing a sterile microcover glass, which can be removed for observation. 48 h after transfection or treatment, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (Sigma) for 10 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.025% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 5 min, and blocked with phosphate-buffered saline, 3% bovine serum albumin for 15 min. After this, cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody, a mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (Santa Cruz), a rabbit polyclonal anti-β-catenin (Upstate Biotechnology), or a rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Myc (Santa Cruz) at the concentration of 5 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline. After being washed twice, cells were incubated with the secondary antibody, a goat anti-rabbit conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Santa Cruz, 2012), or a goat anti-mouse conjugated to rhodamine (Santa Cruz, sc2092) at 1/100 for 1 h at room temperature. The cover glasses were washed three times, mounted on glass slides, and viewed with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM510, Carl-Zeiss, Germany). Isolation of Fibroblastic Cells from Knock-out Lrp5 Mouse—Murine fibroblastic calvaria cells were obtained from the calvariae of Lrp5–/– or their corresponding wild type littermate mice 1–2 days after birth by sequential collagenase digestion at 37 °C as described by Garcia et al. (20.Garcia T. Roman-Roman S. Jackson A. Theilhaber J. Connolly T. Spinella-Jaegle S. Kawai S. Courtois B. Bushnell S. Auberval M. Call K. Baron R. Bone (NY). 2002; 31: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fibroblastic cells were transfected with indicated plasmids as described under “Cell Cultures and Transfection.” LRP5 Interacts with Frat1—It has been clearly established that LRP5/6 receptor is required for Wnt to induce the canonical β-catenin signaling pathway (7.Pinson K.I. Brennan J. Monkley S. Avery B.J. Skarnes W.C. Nature. 2000; 407: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 8.Tamai K. Semenov M. Kato Y. Spokony R. Liu C. Katsuyama Y. Hess F. Saint-Jeannet J.P. He X. Nature. 2000; 407: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar, 9.Wehrli M. Dougan S.T. Caldwell K. O'Keefe L. Schwartz S. Vaizel-Ohayon D. Schejter E. Tomlinson A. DiNardo S. Nature. 2000; 407: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the absence of Wnt, overexpression of LRP5 lacking either the extracellular or both the transmembrane and extracellular domains leads to the activation of the canonical signaling pathway (data not shown (5.Mao J. Wang J. Liu B. Pan W. Farr G.H. Flynn C. Yuan H. Takada S. Kimelman D. Li L. Wu D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 801-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar)). These data strongly suggest that the cytoplasmic tail of LRP5 is able to interact with intracellular players resulting in the activation of Wnt pathway. We have therefore performed a Y2H screen to identify proteins that interact with the LRP5 cytoplasmic domain using two mouse embryo cDNA libraries (11 and 19 days). From each library, ∼20 million clones were screened; clones showing interaction with LRP5 bait in the primary screen were confirmed in secondary screen (see “Experimental Procedures”). Prey from confirmed clones were selected for the specificity of interaction with LRP5 cytoplasmic tail by testing for interaction with two other unrelated baits (i.e. Id3 and Sprouty2) and for the absence of autoactivation. In summary, 35 and 77 clones were confirmed, respectively, from the 11-day and the 19-day embryo cDNA library. Prey from confirmed clones were sequenced to identify the corresponding cDNA. Sequence analysis led to the identification of 45 distinct cDNAs, from which 85% were found in both libraries. Among them we identified frequently rearranged in advanced T-cell lymphoma 1 (Frat1) as a new potential partner for LRP5 and further investigated the physiological significance of LRP5-Frat1 interaction. It is worth noting that Axin, which has been shown to interact with LRP5 (Ref. 5.Mao J. Wang J. Liu B. Pan W. Farr G.H. Flynn C. Yuan H. Takada S. Kimelman D. Li L. Wu D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 801-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar and our data in Fig. 7, was not pulled out from our two-hybrid screen. LRP5 cytoplasmic domain (LRP5tail) and murine Frat1 were cloned in expression vectors as Myc or FLAG-tagged, respectively, and expression in COS-7 cells was verified by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). To confirm the interaction identified in Y2H, Myc-LRP5tail and Flag-Frat were co-expressed in COS-7 cells and found to co-immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1A). In addition, Flag-Frat1 was shown to co-immunoprecipitate with the Myc-LRP5 full-length protein (see Fig. 6C). We also tested whether Frat1 interacts with LRP6, a close and functionally related homologue of LRP5. As shown in Fig. 1B, LRP6tail constructs also immunoprecipitated with Frat1 when both were co-expressed in COS-7 cells indicating that Frat1 interaction is not restricted to LRP5 but also occurs with LRP6. Co-expression of Flag-Frat1 with two other unrelated Myc-tagged proteins (i.e. Id3, Sprouty2) did not allow co-immunoprecipitation (data not show). To further investigate the LRP5 cytoplasmic tail domain involved in the interaction with Frat1 and to test whether the PPT/SP motif that was implicated in Axin interaction (5.Mao J. Wang J. Liu B. Pan W. Farr G.H. Flynn C. Yuan H. Takada S. Kimelman D. Li L. Wu D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 801-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar) is also involved in Frat1 interaction, we generated truncated LRP5tail Myc-tag constructs deleted of 28, 47, or 78 C-terminal residues named, respectively, LRP5tailΔ28, LRP5tailΔ47, and LRP5tailΔ78. These constructs were assessed for interaction with Frat1 by co-IP assay, and data clearly show that Frat1 interacts with LRP5tailΔ28 (Fig. 1A) but not with LRP5tailΔ47 (data not shown) and LRP5tailΔ78 (Fig. 1A). These data strongly suggest that the interaction domain with Frat1 is located in the last 47 amino acid residues of the LRP5 between residues 1569 and 1588 of the cytoplasmic tail. This interaction domain contains one PPSP motif, so this motif was mutated to PPAP to determine whether it is involved in the interaction with Frat1 or not. The mutated LRP5tailΔ28 construct, named LRP5tailΔ28*, retained its ability to interact with Frat1 indicating that the PPSP motif is not required for the interaction with Frat1 (Fig. 1C). Interaction data obtained with the different constructs of LRP5 and Frat1 are summarized in Fig. 1D. Altogether, we demonstrated that Frat1 specifically interacts with the LRP5/6 cytoplasmic domain raising the question of the biological significance of this interaction and its potential role in the activity of both LRP5 and Frat1.Fig. 6Effect of disheveled dominant negative mutant on Frat1/LRP5C activity and association. A, C3H10T1/2 cells were transfected with TCF-1 expression construct, TOPflash, and pTK-Renilla. Where indicated LRP5C, LRP5CΔ28, or LRP5CΔ78 was added in the presence or absence of disheveled dominant negative (Xdd). When indicated, cells were treated with Wnt3a-CM (Wnt3a). 18 h after transfection the medium was replaced by fresh culture medium, and 24 h later luciferase activity was determined in cell lysates and normalized to Renilla signal. All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated three times. Data ± S.D. from one representative experiment are presented (*, p < 0.01). Cells were co-transfected with Frat1-Flag and LRP5C-Myc (B) or LRP5-Myc (C) in absence or presence of the Xdd expression construct. Immunoprecipitation (IP) on total cell lysates using anti-Myc antibody was performed. Total cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using indicated antibodies. Arrows indicate the expected band size.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) LRP5 and Frat1 Interaction Is Necessary for Wnt Signaling—To evaluate the potential role of LRP5 and Frat1 interaction on Wnt signaling, we co-transfected cells with LRP5 lacking the extracellular domain (LRP5C) and Frat1. We used LRP5C instead of wild type LRP5, because overexpression of LRP5, unlike LRP6, does not induce significant Wnt signaling (Refs. 6.Mao B. Wu W. Li Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar and 21.Liu G. Bafico A. Harris V.K. Aaronson S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5825-5835Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar and data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2A, LRP5C acts as a constitutively active receptor and triggers the β-catenin pathway in the absence of Wnt proteins. In contrast, LRP5C with its last 78 amino acids deleted (LRP5CΔ78) failed to activate the TCF transcriptional activity, whereas LRP5CΔ28 was as active as LRP5C. LRP5CΔ47 displays some activity but significantly less than LRP5C (Fig. 2A). Then, we tested the effect of overexpression of Frat1 on the activity of LRP5C and its derivative truncated constructs. As expected, the overexpression of Frat1 alone is able to induce TCF-1 activation (Fig. 2A and Ref. 19.Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J. Farr III, G.H. Sussman D.J. Jonkers J. Kimelman D. Wu D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4233-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 2A, an additive effect was found when LRP5C and Frat1 were overexpressed together. LRP5CΔ28 did not cooperate with Frat1 to induce TCF-1 activation, and surprisingly, Frat1 activity was found to be inhibited by LRP5CΔ78 (Fig. 2A). In concordance with the transcriptional analysis, overexpression of either LRP5C or Frat1 induced β-catenin nuclear translocation (Fig. 2B, II and IV). LRP5CΔ78 had no effect on β-catenin localization (Fig. 2B, III), but it completely blocked Frat1-induced β-catenin nuclear translocation (Fig. 2B, VI). These data indicate that LRP5 and Frat1 contribute to the same signaling pathway. To further support these findings, we prepared primary fibroblastic cells from wild type Lrp5+/+ and homozygous Lrp5–/– mice. As shown in Fig. 3, Wnt3a was able to strongly induce TCF-1 transcriptional activity in primary cells from Lrp5+/+ mice, whereas cells from Lrp5–/– mice displayed no response (Fig. 3A). As expected, overexpression of Frat1 in cells derived from wild type mice (Lrp5+/+) induced TCF-1 transcriptional activity, whereas it failed to affect this activity in cells derived either from Lrp5–/– animals (Fig. 3A). To test whether the intracellular Wnt signaling pathway is still functional in Lrp5–/– cells, we stimulated cells with LiCl, a GSK-3β inhibitor, or overexpressed a β-catenin constitutively active form (18.Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3501) Google Scholar). In both cases, we obtained a strong increase in TCF-1 activity (Fig. 3B). These data provide evidence of an intact Wnt signaling pathway in the Lrp5–/– cells and strongly suggest that LRP5 is required for Frat1 to induce canonical Wnt signaling. We next addressed whether Frat1 is involved in the constitutive activity of LRP5C. To answer this question we made a Frat1 construct with the C-terminal region deleted (Frat1N) that has been described to be capable of inhibiting Wnt activity (19.Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J. Farr III, G.H. Sussman D.J. Jonkers J. Kimelman D. Wu D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4233-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). As expected, Frat1N almost completely inhibited Wnt3a activity (Fig. 4A) and in addition it significantly inhibited LRP5C activity (Fig. 4B). Co-IP assays clearly indicate that Frat1N is no longer able to interact with LRP5C (Fig. 4C) or LRP5 (data not shown). Furthermore, overexpression of Frat1N blocked β-catenin nuclear translocation induced by LRP5C (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the Frat1 interaction domain is located in the C-terminal part and suggest that Frat1 is necessary for the constitutive activity of LRP5C.Fig. 4Frat1 is required for LRP5C activity. A and B, COS-7 cells were transiently co-transfected with TCF-1 expression construct, TOPflash, and pTK-Renilla. Empty vector (Vector) or LRP5C was combined to Frat1 or Frat1N. 18 h after transfection the medium was replaced by fresh culture medium. In A, cells were either treated with Wnt3a-CM (Wnt3a) or left untreated (CTRL). Transfected cells were cultured for 24 h, and luciferase activity was determined in cell lysates and normalized to the Renilla signal. All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated three times. Data ± S.D. from one representative experiment are presented (p < 0.01). C, LRP5C-Myc with either Frat1-Flag or Frat1N-Flag expression constructs were transfected into COS-7 cells. Control consists of untransfected cells (CTRL). Expression of FLAG- or Myc-tagged proteins was verified on total cell lysates by Western blotting with corresponding antibodies. Immunoprecipitation (IP) on total cell lysates was performed using an anti-Myc antibody. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) LRP5 Signaling Controls Frat1 Cellular Localization—Frat1 has been shown to be able to localize into different cell compartments (22.Franca-Koh J.

We tested the effect of LRP5C on Frat1 cell distribution by immunohistochemistry using confocal microscopy. Overexpressed Frat1 predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, yet a significant fraction (∼25%) was also found on the cell membrane (Fig. 5, AI and B). The stimulation of cells with Wnt3a induced a shift in Frat1 cell localization from the cytoplasm to the membrane, where over 80% of Frat1 could be localized (Fig. 5, A II and B). A similar effect was obtained when LRP5C or LRP5CΔ28 were overexpressed in the presence of Frat1"
https://openalex.org/W1970052822,"Mouse fibroblasts, deficient in DNA polymerase β, are hypersensitive to monofunctional DNA methylating agents such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Both wild-type and, in particular, repair-deficient DNA polymerase β null cells are highly sensitized to the cytotoxic effects of MMS by 4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide (4-AN), an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity. Experiments with synchronized cells suggest that exposure during S-phase of the cell cycle is required for the 4-AN effect. 4-AN elicits a similar extreme sensitization to the thymidine analog, 5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxyuridine, implicating the requirement for an intermediate of DNA repair. In PARP-1-expressing fibroblasts treated with a combination of MMS and 4-AN, a complete inhibition of DNA synthesis is apparent after 4 h, and by 24 h, all cells are arrested in S-phase of the cell cycle. Continuous incubation with 4-AN is required to maintain the cell cycle arrest. Caffeine, an inhibitor of the upstream checkpoint kinases ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related), has no effect on the early inhibition of DNA synthesis, but cells are no longer able to maintain the block after 8 h. Instead, the addition of caffeine leads to arrest of cells in G2/M rather than S-phase after 24 h. Analysis of signaling pathways in cell extracts reveals an activation of Chk1 after treatment with MMS and 4-AN, which can be suppressed by caffeine. Our results suggest that inhibition of PARP activity results in sensitization to MMS through maintenance of an ATR and Chk1-dependent S-phase checkpoint.

Removal of unnatural bases or single base lesions from DNA is predominantly by a glycosylase-initiated base excision repair (BER) 1The abbreviations used are: BER, base excision repair; β-pol, DNA polymerase β; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; hmdUrd, 5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxyuridine; TMZ, temozolomide; 4-AN, 4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide; 3-AB, 3-aminobenzamide; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; PI, propidium iodide; MNU, methylnitrosourea; PP1, protein phosphatase 1; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated; ATR, ATM and Rad3-related; APH, aphidicolin; P-Chk1, phosphorylated Chk1; dRP, deoxyribose phosphate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. 1The abbreviations used are: BER, base excision repair; β-pol, DNA polymerase β; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; hmdUrd, 5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxyuridine; TMZ, temozolomide; 4-AN, 4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide; 3-AB, 3-aminobenzamide; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; PI, propidium iodide; MNU, methylnitrosourea; PP1, protein phosphatase 1; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated; ATR, ATM and Rad3-related; APH, aphidicolin; P-Chk1, phosphorylated Chk1; dRP, deoxyribose phosphate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. pathway. Methylated bases are excised by N-methylpurine-DNA glycosylase, a monofunctional glycosylase. In the preferred “single-nucleotide” BER pathway, this is followed by strand cleavage on the 5′ side of the sugar by apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease, gap filling and cleavage on the 3′ side by the DNA synthesis and deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) lyase activities, respectively, of DNA polymerase β (β-pol), and finally sealing of the nick by a DNA ligase (1Srivastava D.K.

The essential role of β-pol in this pathway has been established using extracts from wild-type and β-pol null mouse fibroblasts (2Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). The requirement for β-pol, more specifically the dRP lyase activity of β-pol, in protection of cells against the cytotoxicity of methyl DNA lesions, has been demonstrated by the hypersensitivity of β-pol null cells to the monofunctional methylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) (2Sobol R.W.

Horton J.K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). It is thought that the MMS hypersensitivity phenotype of β-pol null cells reflects accumulation of cytotoxic repair intermediates, such as the 5′ dRP group after removal of methylated bases from DNA (4Horton J.K. Joyce-Gray D.F. Pachkowski B.F. Swenberg J.A. Wilson S.H. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Repair of oxidative DNA damage occurs by an alternate sub-pathway of single-nucleotide BER utilizing bifunctional glycosylases that have an associated lyase activity that nicks the DNA strand 3′ to the abasic site after base removal. Single-nucleotide BER is still preferred (5Pascucci B. Maga G. Hubscher U. Bjoras M. Seeberg E. Hickson I.D. Villani G. Giordano C. Cellai L. Dogliotti E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2124-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), but the 5′ dRP group is not an intermediate of repair, and there is no longer a requirement for the dRP lyase activity of β-pol. Less efficient repair of oxidized bases has been demonstrated in β-pol deficient cell extracts (6Fortini P. Parlanti E. Sidorkina O.M. Laval J. Dogliotti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15230-15236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 7Dianov G. Bischoff C. Piotrowski J. Bohr V.A. J. Biol.

DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and β-pol null cells are hypersensitive to oxidative damage (8Horton J.K. Baker A. Vande Berg B.J. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H.

Presumably it is the DNA synthesis activity of β-pol that is required under these circumstances. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 is the first described member of a family of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ating enzymes. It comprises an N-terminal DNA binding domain, an automodification domain, and a C-terminal catalytic domain and can detect and bind to nicks and strand breaks in cellular DNA, including those formed during BER. Binding to damaged DNA results in rapid activation of PARP-1 leading to poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of numerous nuclear proteins, including itself, using NAD+ as substrate. As a consequence of self-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, PARP-1 is released from its DNA binding site, allowing repair to continue (10Lindahl T. Satoh M.S. Poirier G.G. Klungland A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 405-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 11D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). As early as 1980 it was proposed that PARP-1 plays a role in BER (12Durkacz B.W. Omidiji O. Gray D.A. Shall S. Nature. 1980; 283: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar), but the mechanism of its involvement still remains unclear. In an examination of the interaction of BER proteins with DNA repair intermediates and utilizing a photoaffinity labeling technique, it was revealed that the amount of DNA probe cross-liked to PARP-1 was much greater than that of any other BER protein (13Lavrik O.I. Prasad R. Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Ackerman E.J. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25541-25548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Extracts from PARP-1 –/– cells are deficient in BER (14Dantzer F. de la Rubia G. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Hostomsky Z. de Murcia G. Schreiber V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7559-7569Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), and PARP-1 –/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts are moderately hypersensitive to methylating agents and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (15Trucco C. Oliver F.J. de Murcia G. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2644-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 16Dantzer F. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Trucco C. Flatter E. De La Rubia G. Oliver J. Rolli V. Ménissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In addition, inhibition of PARP activity in mouse fibroblasts by 4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide (4-AN) or 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB) results in tremendous sensitization to MMS (8Horton J.K. Baker A. Vande Berg B.J. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 13Lavrik O.I. Prasad R. Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Ackerman E.J. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25541-25548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of PARP-1 with 4-AN shows that the inhibitor binds to the nicotinamide subsite of the NAD+ binding pocket of the enzyme (17Ruf A. de Murcia G. Schulz G.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3893-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Similarly, trans-dominant inhibition of PARP activity by overexpression of the PARP-1 DNA binding domain blocks repair synthesis induced by N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and results in a marked reduction in cell survival (18Molinete M. Vermeulen W. Burkle A. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Kupper J.H. Hoeijmakers J.H. de Murcia G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2109-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 19Schreiber V. Hunting D. Trucco C.

Inhibited PARP-1 protein can still detect and bind to strand breaks in DNA, but it cannot be automodified and may remain irreversibly bound to damaged DNA, perhaps entirely preventing repair. In the present study we extend our initial observations of the enhancement of the growth inhibitory effect of MMS after a block of cellular PARP activity and demonstrate that this effect is S-phase-dependent. We describe perturbations in the cell cycle that occur after exposure of mouse fibroblasts to a sublethal concentration of MMS and a non-toxic PARP inhibitor. We then analyze cell signaling proteins in extracts from treated cells and propose that an ATR- and Chk1-dependent signaling pathway is involved in the cellular response to PARP inhibition after DNA damage by MMS. Cell Cultures—Clones of the originally characterized wild-type and β-pol null SV40-transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MB16.3 and MB19.4, respectively) have been described previously (4Horton J.K. Joyce-Gray D.F. Pachkowski B.F. Swenberg J.A. Wilson S.H. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cells were routinely grown at 34 °C in a 10% CO2 incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with GlutaMAX-1 (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, Logan, UT), and hygromycin (80 μg/ml; Roche Applied Science). PARP-1 +/+ and PARP-1 –/– spontaneously immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts were obtained from Dr. Josianne Ménissier-de Murcia (CNRS, Illkirch-Graffenstaden, France). These cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 10% CO2 incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing l-glutamine and 10% FBS. All cells were routinely tested and found to be free of mycoplasma contamination. Cytotoxicity Studies—Cytotoxicity was determined by growth inhibition assays as described previously (4Horton J.K. Joyce-Gray D.F. Pachkowski B.F. Swenberg J.A. Wilson S.H. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Wild-type and β-pol null mouse fibroblasts or PARP-1 +/+ and PARP-1 –/– mouse fibroblasts were seeded at a density of 40,000 cells/well in six-well dishes. The following day they were treated with a range of concentrations of DNA-damaging agent in growth medium, without hygromycin in the case of the β-pol cells. MMS, methylnitrosourea (MNU), H2O2, bleomycin, and 5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxyuridine (hmdUrd) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and peroxynitrite was from Upstate (Lake Placid, NY). Temozolomide (TMZ) was obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. The MMS and H2O2 were added directly to the medium at the time of the experiment, stock solutions of MNU and TMZ were made in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), bleomycin and hmdUrd were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before adding to medium. Peroxynitrite solution in 0.3 m NaOH was added to medium immediately before dosing the cells, and the pH returned to 7.4 by the addition of HCl. After 1 h of exposure to MMS, MNU, or H2O2 or 4 h for TMZ and 24 h for hmdUrd, cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HyClone), and fresh medium was added. For UV irradiation (254 nm), cell monolayers were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution before UV exposure (0–20 J/m2) in a Stratalinker model 1800 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and then the growth medium was replaced after exposure. Dishes were incubated for 4–5 days in a 10% CO2 incubator until untreated control cells were ∼80% confluent. Cells (triplicate wells for each drug concentration) were counted by a cell lysis procedure (20Butler W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and results were expressed as the number of cells in drug-treated wells relative to control wells (% control growth). In many studies cells were treated with DNA-damaging agents in the presence of the PARP inhibitors 4-AN or 3-AB, and the incubation with inhibitor was continued after washing. In general, cells were treated with 4-AN (10 μm) or 3-AB (10 mm) for a total of 24 h, but for 4-AN, other concentrations and times of exposure were also utilized in the experiments described in Figs. 2, 3, and 8. Stock solutions of the inhibitors were prepared in Me2SO and were diluted to the appropriate concentration in medium just before use. In some studies cells were treated with caffeine (1 mm) as well as 4-AN during the 1-h MMS exposure and for the following 23 h. The IC90 for MMS is the concentration that results in 90% growth inhibition.Fig. 3Effect of 4-AN on MMS sensitivity in synchronized cells.A, wild-type or β-pol null cells were treated for 48 h with medium containing 0.2% FBS followed by APH in complete medium for 16 h to arrest cell growth.

Joyce-Gray D.F. Pachkowski B.F. Swenberg J.A. Wilson S.H. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes at a density equivalent to that used in the cytotoxicity experiments. The following day cells were treated for 1 h with MMS (0.25 mm for β-pol wild-type cells, 0.5 mm for PARP cells) with and without 4-AN (10 μm). Incubation with 4-AN was continued for up to 24 h. In some studies cells were treated with 1 mm caffeine in addition to 4-AN during and after the 1-h MMS exposure. Before the times specified (2–24 h) after the beginning of exposure to MMS, 10 μm BrdUrd (Sigma) was added to the dishes for 30 min (β-pol wild-type cells) or 2 h (PARP cells) to pulse-label the cells. Cells were washed with PBS, harvested by trypsinization, and then washed a second time with PBS. The cell pellet obtained after centrifugation was resuspended in 100 μl of cold PBS, and the cells were dropped slowly into 70% ethanol and allowed to fix at 4 °C overnight. The samples were washed then suspended in 2 n HCl containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated for 30 min at room temperature to denature DNA. The cell samples were pelleted, resuspended in 0.1 m sodium borate, pH 8.5, to neutralize the acid, and then washed with PBS. Cells were then incubated at 4 °C overnight with 20 μl of anti-BrdUrd-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antibody (BD Biosciences) in PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin and 5 μl of 10 mg/ml RNase (Sigma) stock solution. The following day the cells were pelleted, washed with PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 5 μg/ml PI (Sigma). The samples were analyzed by flow cytometry using Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences), and cell cycle histograms of PI fluorescence (DNA content) versus BrdUrd incorporation were generated. Cell cycle populations are designated G0/G1 (2 N DNA content with no BrdUrd incorporation), S (variable DNA content with BrdUrd incorporation), and G2/M (4N DNA content without BrdUrd incorporation). Data represent the mean of at least two independent experiments. For some samples data were also analyzed using ModFit LT software (Verity Software House, Inc., Topsham, ME). Alternatively, after appropriate treatment, cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed with PBS then resuspended in 1 ml PBS. An equal volume of Nuclear Isolation and Staining Solution (nuclear isolation media-4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; NPE Systems, Inc., Pembroke Pines, FL) was added. The NPE DNA reference calibrator solution was mixed by gently turning the vial upside down a few times; two drops (∼100 μl) were added to the cell sample, and the solution was filtered with a 25-μm NPE filter tip into another tube. The fluorescence peak and volume peak were set, and optical alignments were performed on a NPE Quanta flow cytometer. Analysis was performed using ModFit LT software. Cell Synchronization—Wild-type or β-pol null cells were seeded at equivalent cell density in 100-mm dishes for cell cycle analysis or six-well dishes for cytotoxicity studies as required. The following day the cells were washed one time with Hanks' balanced salt solution, one time with medium containing 0.2% FBS, and then incubated with medium containing 0.2% FBS for 48 h in a 10% CO2 incubator at 34 °C. The medium was then aspirated, and the cells were incubated with 2.5 μm aphidicolin (APH; Sigma) in growth medium with 10% FBS for 16 h. At this time the cells were washed, and drug-free 10% FBS-containing medium was added. For cell cycle analysis, cells were incubated with BrdUrd at the appropriate time to pulse-label the cells, and the samples were analyzed as described above. For cytotoxicity studies cells were treated with MMS with and without 4-AN as described earlier beginning 30 min after release from the APH block. Cell Lysate Preparation and Western Blotting—Wild-type mouse fibroblasts were seeded in 145-mm dishes at a cell density of 6.9 × 106 cells/dish. The following day the cells were treated with MMS (0.25 mm) or 4-AN (10 μm) or a combination of the two agents as described previously. In some studies cells were treated with 1 mm caffeine in addition to 4-AN during and after the 1-h MMS exposure. After 2 or 24 h, treated and control untreated cells were harvested by scraping and washed with PBS. Cell lysates were prepared in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.3% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin as described previously (21Kedar P.S.

Cells in lysis buffer were incubated on ice for 30 min, then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction was transferred to another tube. The protein concentration in the extract was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay, with bovine serum albumin as standard. Equal amounts (100 μg) of total protein were loaded on gels and separated by 4–12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane in a transblot apparatus for 3 h or overnight at 25 V. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBS-T) and then first probed with anti-Chk1 polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling) was used as the secondary antibody, and immobilized horseradish peroxidase activity was detected using either Phototope-horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling) or Renaissance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) chemiluminescence detection kits for Western blotting. The blot was stripped by incubating with buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1% SDS for 30 min at 50 °C followed by 2 washes with TBS-T at room temperature. Detection of phosphorylated Chk1 (P-Chk1) was with rabbit polyclonal anti-P-Chk1 (serine 345) antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling). The membrane was stripped again and, as a loading control, probed for actin using anti-actin mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); the secondary antibody was goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:5000, Bio-Rad). Co-immunoprecipitation and Protein Phosphatase Reactions—For co-immunoprecipitations, equal amounts (1 mg of protein) of cell lysates were mixed with 1 μg of anti-ATR goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) or goat non-immune IgG. The mixture was incubated with rotation for 4 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplex was adsorbed onto protein A-Sepharose and protein G-agarose beads by incubating the mixture overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Finally, the beads were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and heated for 5 min, and the soluble proteins were separated by 4–12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane as described above. After blocking, the membrane was probed with the anti-Chk1 mouse monoclonal antibody. The blot was stripped and probed for ATR using anti-ATR mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1000; GeneTex, San Antonio, TX). Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a Mn2+-dependent protein phosphatase with activity against phosphoserine/threonine residues (22Mazurek N. Conklin J. Byrd J.C. Raz A. Bresalier R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36311-36315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). For reactions with PP1, cells were pelleted and lysed with lysis buffer that did not contain protease inhibitors, NaF, or sodium orthovanadate. The lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-ATR polyclonal antibody as described above, the immunocomplex was washed three times with the same lysis buffer, and the pellet was made as dry as possible. It was then resuspended and digested with 2 units of PP1 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in 25 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.025% Tween 20) for 2 h at 30 °C.The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer and heating for 5 min, and soluble proteins were separated by 4–12% SDS-PAGE together with a control sample prepared as previously with phosphatase inhibitors and without PP1. The proteins were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane as described above. After blocking, the membrane was probed as described above with the anti-P-Chk1 rabbit polyclonal antibody. Effect of PARP Inhibitors on MMS-induced Cytotoxicity in Mouse Fibroblasts—It is well documented that β-pol null cells, deficient in β-pol-dependent BER, are hypersensitive to a wide range of monofunctional methylating and ethylating agents (2Sobol R.W.

Swenberg J.A. Wilson S.H. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, it is known that both wild-type and β-pol null cells can be extremely sensitized to MMS by the PARP inhibitors 3-AB and, in particular, 4-AN (8Horton J.K. Baker A. Vande Berg B.J. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 13Lavrik O.I. Prasad R. Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Ackerman E.J. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25541-25548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Our observation that treatment of cells with MMS for 1 h along with exposure to 4-AN (10 μm) for 24 h results in extreme sensitization to this methylating agent is illustrated in Fig. 1A. In this experiment, in the presence of 4-AN and, therefore, in the absence of PARP activity, we find that β-pol null cells are still hypersensitive to MMS compared with wild-type cells, as shown in the left panel of Fig. 1A. Here, when comparing IC90 for MMS, an ∼40- and 80-fold sensitization is seen in wild-type and β-pol null cells, respectively. Thus, under conditions where PARP activity is inhibited, β-pol null cells demonstrate twice the hypersensitivity to MMS relative to wild-type cells than under control conditions (5.2- and 2.6-fold, respectively). The results demonstrate that PARP activity is critical in protection of the cells against cytotoxic methyl DNA adducts both in the presence and absence of β-pol-dependent repair pathways. The more widely used PARP inhibitor, 3-AB, can also sensitize both wild-type and β-pol null cells (Fig. 1B), but the effect is not so dramatic even when using a concentration of 10 mm 3-AB (1000 times the maximally effective concentration of 4-AN). Inhibitor studies in vitro had shown the IC50 for 4-AN and 3-AB to be 0.18 and 33 μm, respectively (23Banasik M. Komura H. Shimoyama M. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1569-1575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and studies in cells demonstrated that 4-AN was 1000-fold more potent than 3-AB at inhibiting PARP activity (24Schlicker A.

https://openalex.org/W2054426881,"Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG, Siglec-4) is one of several endogenous axon regeneration inhibitors that limit recovery from central nervous system injury and disease. Molecules that block such inhibitors may enhance axon regeneration and functional recovery. MAG, a member of the Siglec family of sialic acid-binding lectins, binds to sialoglycoconjugates on axons and particularly to gangliosides GD1a and GT1b, which may mediate some of the inhibitory effects of MAG. In a prior study (Blixt, O., Collins, B. E., van den Nieuwenhof, I. M., Crocker, P. R., and Paulson, J. C. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 31007-31019), we identified potent monovalent sialoside inhibitors of MAG using a novel screening platform. In the current study, the most potent of these were tested for their ability to reverse MAG-mediated inhibition of axon outgrowth from rat cerebellar granule neurons in vitro. Monovalent sialoglycans enhanced axon regeneration in proportion to their MAG binding affinities. The most potent glycoside was disialyl T antigen (NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–3[NeuAcα2–6]GalNAc-R), followed by 3-sialyl T antigen (NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–3GalNAc-R), structures expressed on O-linked glycoproteins as well as on gangliosides. Prior studies indicated that blocking gangliosides reversed MAG inhibition (Vyas, A. A., Patel, H. V., Fromholt, S. E., Heffer-Lauc, M., Vyas, K. A., Dang, J., Schachner, M., and Schnaar, R. L. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99, 8412–8417). In the current study, blocking O-linked glycoprotein sialylation with benzyl-α-GalNAc had no effect. The ability to reverse MAG inhibition with monovalent glycosides encourages further exploration of glycans and glycan mimetics as blockers of MAG-mediated axon outgrowth inhibition.

Berry M. Barrett L.B. Butt A. Logan A. Glia. 2004; 46: 225-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 2Filbin M.T. Nat. Rev.

The inhibitors include three myelin proteins, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), Nogo, and oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (OMgp), and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, which are found on the astrocytic scar and on residual myelin. Axon regeneration inhibitors, on myelin and astrocytes, bind specifically to targets on the axon surface, initiating a signaling cascade that ultimately activates RhoA and halts axon outgrowth by modulating actin dynamics. Detailed knowledge of axon regeneration inhibitors, their axonal ligands, and the signaling pathways leading to changes in the actin cytoskeleton promises to provide opportunities to enhance axon regeneration after CNS injury (e.g. spinal cord injury) and in diseases involving axon loss, such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, and Alzheimer disease. MAG has two classes of well-defined axonal targets: sialylated glycans, specifically gangliosides GD1a and GT1b (4Vyas A.A. Patel H.V. Fromholt S.E. Heffer-Lauc M. Vyas K.A. Dang J. Schachner M.

Although the relative roles of gangliosides and NgRs as MAG ligands have yet to be resolved, in some systems MAG inhibition is completely reversed by sialidase, suggesting that, at least in those systems, MAG uses sialylated glycans as its major axonal ligands. In those systems, or in combination with blockers of NgR (9GrandPre T. Li S. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2002; 417: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), it is anticipated that potent glycan inhibitors of MAG may be valuable tools to enhance axon regeneration. MAG (Siglec-4), a member of the Siglec (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin) family (10Crocker P.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), binds preferentially to the terminal sequence “NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–3GalNAc” (11Crocker P.R. Kelm S. Hartnell A. Freeman S. Nath D.

Trans. 1996; 24: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), especially in the context of larger glycan structures bearing additional anionic groups (see Fig. 1). In the brain, this structure is most abundant as the terminus of gangliosides GD1a and GT1b, which are high-affinity MAG ligands and mediate MAG inhibition of axon outgrowth in vitro (4Vyas A.A.

Glycan structures with an additional sialic acid 6-linked to the GalNAc residue, “NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–3(NeuAcα2–6)GalNAc,” bind to MAG with an order of magnitude higher affinity than the corresponding structure without the 6-linked NeuAc (13Collins B.E.

Because they were discovered as extensions of the disaccharide “Galβ1–3GalNAc,” which is called core 1 or the T antigen on glycoproteins, we denote the above structures as 3-sialyl T and disialyl T, respectively (see Fig. 1). Ganglioside nomenclature is that of Svennerholm (52Svennerholm L. Prog. Brain Res. 1994; 101: xi-xivCrossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A screen of synthetic sialoglycans for their ability to inhibit MAG-sialic acid binding in vitro (15Blixt O. Collins B.E. van den Nieuwenhof I. Crocker P.R. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31007-31019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) revealed that threonine methyl ester glycosides of disialyl T, 3-sialyl T, and 6-sialyl T (Galβ1–3(NeuAcα2–6)GalNAc) were potent inhibitors of MAG-sialoside binding, with IC50 values of 0.3, 1.6, and 10 μm, respectively. We report here that these glycans, when added to live neurons in vitro, effectively reverse MAG-mediated inhibition of axon outgrowth with the same relative potencies. Materials—Glycosides of 3-sialyl T, 6-sialyl T, and disialyl T, each bearing an α-linked N-acetyl carboxymethyl threonine as aglycone, were prepared as described previously (20Blixt O. Allin K. Pereira L. Datta A. Paulson J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 5739-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the disialyl T glycoside was further purified to remove a minor cytotoxic contaminant by sequential adsorption to DEAE-Sepharose (Cl-; 0.25 ml) elution with 0.5 ml each of 10, 25, 50, 100, and 250 mm ammonium acetate; lyophilization of fractions containing sialoside; and P4-gel filtration chromatography (10-ml column; 5 mm sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl). β-Azidoethyl 3-sialyllactoside was prepared as described previously (21Blixt O. Brown J. Schur M.J. Wakarchuk W. Paulson J.C. J. Org. Chem. 2001; 66: 2442-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Benzyl-α-GalNAc and GAP-43 monoclonal antibody (mAb) were purchased from Sigma. Peanut agglutinin was from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Other reagents were of the highest purity commercially available. Cerebellar Granule Neurons—Neurons were isolated from postnatal day 5–7 Sprague-Dawley rats. Cerebella were isolated and thoroughly cleared of meninges under a dissecting microscope and dissociated enzymatically using a papain dissociation kit (Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ). Dissociated cells were collected, washed, and resuspended in culture medium containing minimal essential medium (MEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 25 mm Hepes, 25 mm KCl, 1.5 g/liter NaHCO3, 10% heat-inactivated equine serum, 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), and 1:100 penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine mixture (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured on 96-well poly-d-lysinecoated microwells at a density of 60,000 cells/well in 100 μl of medium or in 100-mm tissue culture plates at a density of 9 × 106 cells/plate in 9 ml of medium. As indicated, sialosides (1 μm to 1 mm), benzyl-α-GalNAc (2.5 mm), sialidase (from Vibrio cholerae; Calbiochem), or anti-MAG mAb 513 (22Poltorak M. Sadoul R. Keilhauer G. Landa C. Fahrig T. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1893-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) was added 45 min after cells were plated. Neurite Outgrowth Inhibition Assays—MAG-containing substrata were prepared using a detergent extract of rat brain myelin as described previously (4Vyas A.A. Patel H.V. Fromholt S.E. Heffer-Lauc M. Vyas K.A. Dang J. Schachner M. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8412-8417Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Briefly, myelin membranes (1 mg of protein) were extracted in 1 ml of extraction buffer (0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 0.1 m Na2SO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 1% octylglucoside) at 4 °C for 16 h and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was diluted 2-fold with detergent-free extraction buffer and adsorbed on poly-d-lysine-coated tissue culture wells at a concentration of 75 μg/cm2 (based on the original myelin protein content). After 4 h at ambient temperature, the plates were washed extensively with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then washed with culture medium. Cells were plated on control and experimental surfaces and cultured for 48 h, after which the wells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were permeabilized with methanol (-20 °C, 2 min) and immunostained with GAP-43 mAb (1:800; Sigma) followed by Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:120; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) mixed with 300 nm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes). The cells were washed, and multiple random fields from replicate wells were captured for morphometric analysis (see below) using a Nikon TE300 epifluorescent microscope fitted with a Sony charge-coupled device camera. Cells plated on control surfaces show little or no clumping and have long fine axons that form a lacy network (e.g. Fig. 2A), whereas on substrata adsorbed with myelin proteins, the cells clumped together and extended highly fasciculated axons (e.g. Fig. 2B), leaving large areas of the substratum bare. Axon outgrowth inhibition was determined using an objective semi-automated morphometric analysis method using Metamorph image analysis software (Universal Imaging Systems, Downington, PA) as described previously (4Vyas A.A. Patel H.V. Fromholt S.E. Heffer-Lauc M. Vyas K.A. Dang J. Schachner M. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8412-8417Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pixels of each image collected were classified according to their intensity, and then the number of pixels (relative image area) having the intensity of independent single axons was quantified and compared between control and experimental cultures in the same experiment. Results are expressed as percentage of inhibition. To ensure analyses were from comparable cell numbers, cell densities on control and inhibitory substrata were determined by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining of nuclei and found to be statistically indistinguishable (data not shown). On average, for each experimental condition, 24 images were analyzed (four random images from each of six independent wells from three different experiments). Statistical p values were obtained using Student's t test. Selective Disruption of O-Linked Glycan Sialylation—Neurons were treated with benzyl-α-GalNAc to selectively disrupt O-linked glycan sialylation (23Huet G. Hennebicq-Reig S. De Bolos C. Ulloa F. Lesuffleur T. Barbat A. Carriere V. Kim I. Real F.X. Delannoy P. Zweibaum A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1311-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 24Gouyer V. Leteurtre E. Zanetta J.P. Lesuffleur T. Delannoy P. Huet G. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D1235-D1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neurons were treated with 2.5 mm benzyl-α-GalNAc diluted from a 0.4 m stock (in Me2SO) for 48 h. To test the efficacy of benzyl-α-GalNAc treatment, cells grown on 100-mm dishes (with and without inhibitor) were washed with PBS, suspended in PBS using a rubber policeman, and collected by centrifugation (500 × g). The pellet was washed with PBS and lysed in boiling 2× Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). Lysate proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using precast 10% acrylamide gels (Gradipore, Frenchs Forest, Australia) according to manufacturer's instructions. The proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a semidry transfer cell (Bio-Rad) and then blotted with biotinylated peanut agglutinin as described previously (26Sato Y. Kimura M. Endo T. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 1133-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), except that membranes were blocked for 2 h at ambient temperature, incubated with peanut agglutinin (10 μg/ml) for 16 h at 4 °C and then with streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (1:1500; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h at ambient temperature, and finally developed using nitro blue tetrazoliumbromochloroindolyl phosphate (Sigma). To test the specificity of benzyl-α-GalNAc treatment, gangliosides were extracted from inhibitor-treated and control cells in chloroform-methanol-water (4:8:3), resolved by silica gel TLC using chloroform-methanol-0.25% aqueous KCl (60:35:8) as developing solvent, and then stained with resorcinol reagent as described previously (27Schnaar R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 348-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 28Schnaar R.L. Needham L.K. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 371-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Glycoside Enhancement of Axon Outgrowth on Myelin-adsorbed Surfaces Correlates with MAG Binding Affinity—Neonatal rat cerebellar granule neurons extend axons when plated on polylysine-coated wells (29Powell S.K. Rivas R.J. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Hatten M.E. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 32: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), forming a dense axon meshwork within 48 h (Fig. 2A). When the same cells are plated on a substratum adsorbed with extracted myelin proteins, they clump together, extend fasciculated axon bundles between clumps, and leave much of the substratum bare (Fig. 2B). Addition of 10 μm disialyl T glycoside (for glycoside structures, see Fig. 1) had no effect on neurons plated on control surfaces (Fig. 2C) but largely reversed the effect of adsorbed myelin proteins, restoring an extensive axon meshwork (Fig. 2D). Addition of the same concentration of 6-sialyl T glycoside had little effect, whereas addition of 3-sialyl T glycoside resulted in a significant reversal (Fig. 3). None of the glycosides had a significant effect on axon outgrowth on control surfaces, and addition of lactose at up to 100-fold higher concentrations had no affect on axon outgrowth on control or inhibitory substrata (data not shown). Quantification of axon outgrowth on control and myelin-adsorbed substrata via image analysis revealed that monovalent sialoglycans reversed myelin-mediated inhibition in proportion to their affinity for MAG (Fig. 4, Table I). Whereas 3-sialyl lactose did not cause significant reversal of inhibition at any concentration tested (up to 100 μm), 6-sialyl T caused statistically significant, although quantitatively modest, reversal only at the highest concentration tested (100 μm). The highest affinity MAG-binding glycans, 3-sialyl T and disialyl T (15Blixt O. Collins B.E. van den Nieuwenhof I. Crocker P.R. Paulson J.C. J. Biol.

Berry M. Barrett L.B. Butt A. Logan A. Glia. 2004; 46: 225-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In the experimental system used in this study (cerebellar granule neurons plated on detergent-extracted myelin proteins), axon outgrowth inhibition is primarily MAG-mediated (4Vyas A.A. Patel H.V. Fromholt S.E. Heffer-Lauc M. Vyas K.A. Dang J. Schachner M. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8412-8417Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), in that addition of an anti-MAG mAb reverses inhibition ∼80% (Fig. 5). Likewise, MAG has multiple ligands, including sialoglycoconjugates and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored NgR proteins. In the experimental system used in this study (4Vyas A.A. Patel H.V. Fromholt S.E. Heffer-Lauc M. Vyas K.A. Dang J. Schachner M. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8412-8417Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), inhibition is dependent on sialoglycoconjugates, in that sialidase treatment results in complete reversal of inhibition (Fig. 5). Anti-MAG antibody and sialidase had no effect on axon outgrowth on control substrata (data not shown). Although other axon regeneration inhibitors and other MAG ligands function in vivo and in other experimental systems, the system used in this study isolates MAG and sialoglycoconjugates as the functional receptor-ligand pair inhibiting axon regeneration, consistent with the finding that the most potent MAG-binding sialoglycan, disialyl T, reverses inhibition >75% (Fig. 4). O-Linked Glycoprotein Glycans Are Not Functional MAG Ligands on Cerebellar Granule Neurons—In the brain, the 3-sialyl T sequence, NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–3GalNAc, is found most abundantly as the terminal trisaccharide of gangliosides GD1a and GT1b. However, it is also found as a trisaccharide linked to Ser or Thr on O-linked glycans of glycoproteins (19Van den Steen P. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Opdenakker G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 151-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Likewise, the disialyl T sequence, NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–3[NeuAcα2–6] GalNAc, is found as the terminus of “α-series” gangliosides (14Collins B.E. Ito H. Sawada N. Ishida H. Kiso M. Schnaar R.L. J. Biol.

Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 151-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicated that gangliosides are functional ligands for MAG-mediated inhibition of axon outgrowth from cerebellar granule neurons and hippocampal neurons (4Vyas A.A. Patel H.V. Fromholt S.E. Heffer-Lauc M. Vyas K.A. Dang J. Schachner M. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8412-8417Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 12Vinson M. Strijbos P.J.

The finding that threonine glycosides bind MAG with high affinity (15Blixt O. Collins B.E. van den Nieuwenhof I. Crocker P.R. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31007-31019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) led us to test the role of O-linked sialoglycans on glycoproteins of cerebellar granule cells as functional MAG ligands. Benzyl-α-GalNAc was used to disturb O-linked sialoglycan biosynthesis (24Gouyer V. Leteurtre E. Zanetta J.P. Lesuffleur T. Delannoy P. Huet G. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D1235-D1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Axon outgrowth on control substrata was unaffected by the presence of 2.5 mm benzyl-α-GalNAc, and axon outgrowth inhibition by myelin proteins was also unaffected (Fig. 6). The efficacy of benzyl-α-GalNAc treatment was confirmed by noting a characteristic increase in peanut agglutinin binding (>4-fold) to glycoproteins resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (data not shown), indicative of a decrease in α2–3 sialylation of O-linked glycans of glycoproteins as reported previously (23Huet G. Hennebicq-Reig S. De Bolos C. Ulloa F. Lesuffleur T. Barbat A. Carriere V. Kim I. Real F.X. Delannoy P. Zweibaum A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1311-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Treatment with benzyl-α-GalNAc had no effect on the quantity or expression pattern of cerebellar granule neuron gangliosides, as determined by TLC (data not shown). The lack of effect of benzyl-α-GalNAc, combined with prior data implicating gangliosides as functional MAG ligands (4Vyas A.A. Patel H.V. Fromholt S.E. Heffer-Lauc M. Vyas K.A. Dang J. Schachner M. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8412-8417Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), implies that gangliosides, rather than O-linked glycoprotein glycans, are functional MAG ligands on cerebellar granule neurons. The key finding reported here is that low molecular weight monovalent glycans enhance axon regeneration in vitro by reversing axon outgrowth inhibition by MAG and do so in proportion to their MAG binding affinities as previously measured in a competitive assay involving MAG binding to sialoglycans (15Blixt O. Collins B.E. van den Nieuwenhof I. Crocker P.R. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31007-31019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This finding encourages further high-throughput screening of glycans, glycan mimetics, and other small molecules that may provide yet better agents to reverse MAG-mediated axon outgrowth inhibition. Multiple endogenous axon regeneration inhibitors on myelin and the astrocytic scar combine to limit recovery from CNS injury and disease (1Sandvig A. Berry M. Barrett L.B. Butt A. Logan A. Glia. 2004; 46: 225-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 2Filbin M.T. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 3He Z. Koprivica V. Annu. Rev.

MAG, Nogo, OMgp, and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans may each contribute to the highly inhibitory environment of the injured CNS. Enzymes, antibodies, and small molecules that block any one axon regeneration inhibitor have been reported to significantly, although often only modestly, enhance recovery from experimental axonal injury (9GrandPre T. Li S. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2002; 417: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 32Bradbury E.J. Moon L.D. Popat R.J. King V.R. Bennett G.S. Patel P.N. Fawcett J.W. McMahon S.B.

Likewise, mice genetically engineered to lack a particular axon regeneration inhibitor (or inhibitor ligand) typically show only limited recovery from experimental CNS injuries (34Kim J.E. Li S.

To overcome axon regeneration inhibitors, two general approaches appear feasible: (i) block the common signaling pathways downstream of axon regeneration inhibitors (40Dergham P. Ellezam B. Essagian C. Avedissian H. Lubell W.D. McKerracher L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6570-6577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Spencer T. Filbin M.T. J. Anat. 2004; 204: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); or (ii) block multiple axon regeneration inhibitors simultaneously. Small molecules that block each of the axon regeneration inhibitors will contribute to the latter approach. In that light, we have initiated a search for low molecular weight inhibitors of MAG. MAG has two classes of functional axonal ligands, gangliosides (4Vyas A.A. Patel H.V. Fromholt S.E. Heffer-Lauc M. Vyas K.A. Dang J. Schachner M. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Strittmatter S.M. Science. 2002; 297: 1190-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 6Domeniconi M. Cao Z. Spencer T. Sivasankaran R. Wang K. Nikulina E. Kimura N. Cai H. Deng K. Gao Y. He Z. Filbin M. Neuron. 2002; 35: 283-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), a more recent study indicates that MAG binds to NgR1 and NgR2 in a sialic acid-dependent manner (7Venkatesh K. Chivatakarn O. Lee H. Joshi P.S. Kantor D.B. Newman B.A. Mage R. Rader C. Giger R.J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 808-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The functional role of sialic acids (if any) in MAG-NgR-mediated axon outgrowth inhibition has yet to be determined. MAG binding to gangliosides is fully dependent on terminal α2–3-linked sialic acid residues (13Collins B.E. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Tropak M.B. Roder J.C. Crocker P.R. Schnaar R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16889-16895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Gangliosides and NgR proteins may both contribute to the inhibitory effects of MAG on different axons. Whereas MAG-binding sialoglycoconjugates are widely distributed on neurons and axons (45Kotani M. Kawashima I. Ozawa H. Terashima T. Tai T.

Trifunovski A. Widmer H.R. Widenfalk J. Olson L. Spenger C. J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 453: 292-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Genetic ablation of NgR1 does not enhance regeneration in the cortical spinal tract, a major spinal cord pathway, although certain other descending pathways may be positively impacted (37Kim J.E. Liu B.P. Park J.H. Strittmatter S.M. Neuron. 2004; 44: 439-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 39Zheng B. Atwal J. Ho C. Case L. He X.L. Garcia K.C. Steward O. Tessier-Lavigne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Genetic ablation of NgR2 has yet to be reported. MAG ligands other than the NgRs are likely to be responsible for inhibition in many important axonal pathways (3He Z. Koprivica V. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 341-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and gangliosides may be those other ligands (4Vyas A.A. Patel H.V. Fromholt S.E. Heffer-Lauc M. Vyas K.A. Dang J. Schachner M.

Prior studies implicate sialoglycans, particularly the major brain gangliosides GD1a and GT1b, as functional ligands for MAG-mediated inhibition of axon regeneration (4Vyas A.A. Patel H.V.

Sialidase treatment reverses MAG inhibition of axon outgrowth from cerebellar granule neurons (Fig. 5) (4Vyas A.A. Patel H.V. Fromholt S.E. Heffer-Lauc M. Vyas K.A. Dang J. Schachner M. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8412-8417Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and dorsal root ganglion neurons (49DeBellard M-E. Tang S. Mukhopadhyay G. Shen Y.-J. Filbin M.T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) in vitro. More limited reversal of MAG inhibition of axon outgrowth from cerebellar granule neurons plated on MAG-expressing cells was reported using 9 mm 3-sialyl lactose (49DeBellard M-E. Tang S. Mukhopadhyay G. Shen Y.-J. Filbin M.T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The role of sialoglycoconjugates was later questioned when MAG engineered to lack a primary sialic acid-binding amino acid, MAG-R118A, still displayed inhibitory activity (50Tang S. Shen Y.J. de Bellard M.E. Mukhopadhyay G. Salzer J.L. Crocker P.R. Filbin M.T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1355-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, subsequent studies demonstrated that the residual inhibitory activity of MAG-R118A was also sialic acid-dependent (12Vinson M. Strijbos P.J. Rowles A. Facci L. Moore S.E. Simmons D.L. Walsh F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20280-20285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In that latter study, neurite outgrowth inhibition of hippocampal neurons by MAG-R118A was effectively reversed by micromolar concentrations of NeuAc and 3-sialyl lactose. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to demonstrate that monovalent high-affinity MAG-binding sialoglycans reverse axon outgrowth inhibition by immobilized native MAG and the first to correlate reversal of MAG inhibition by sialoglycans with their MAG binding affinities. The results support the conclusion that high-throughput screening of inhibitors of MAG-glycan interactions is warranted to identify molecules with potential for blocking MAG-mediated axon outgrowth inhibition. The concentrations of 3-sialyl T and disialyl T required to reverse the inhibitory effects of MAG on axon outgrowth in vitro were 20–50-fold higher than the IC50 measured in the sialoside binding inhibition assay (Table I). This suggests that monovalent inhibitors must be present at saturating levels to disrupt the interactions of cell surface sialoglycans with immobilized MAG. This may result from a high sialoside ligand concentration on the axon cell membrane, shifting the inhibition curve to higher concentrations of the monovalent glycan inhibitors to compete. Regardless, a 10 μm concentration of disialyl T antigen was efficacious, and the toxicity of saccharides is characteristically low. Thus, testing of sialoglycans for their ability to enhance axon regeneration in nerve injury models in vivo may be feasible and provides impetus for identifying further structural refinements that may generate yet higher affinity sialoglycan inhibitors (51Zaccai N.R. Maenaka K. Maenaka T. Crocker P.R. Brossmer R. Kelm S. Jones E.Y. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 557-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Screening of sialoglycans for high-affinity MAG ligands revealed that the aglycone affects MAG affinity. Notably, aryl glycosides of 3-sialyl T antigen were up to 150-fold less potent in binding MAG than the N-acetyl carboxymethyl threonine glycoside. Because the latter is akin to the 3-sialyl T antigen on O-linked glycoproteins, it raised the possibility that O-linked glycans, in addition to the more abundant gangliosides GD1a and GT1b, may be functional MAG ligands. However, benzyl-α-GalNAc, which inhibits O-linked glycan sialylation (23Huet G. Hennebicq-Reig S. De Bolos C. Ulloa F. Lesuffleur T. Barbat A. Carriere V. Kim I. Real F.X. Delannoy P. Zweibaum A. J.

Biosci. 2001; 6: D1235-D1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), failed to affect MAG inhibition of axon outgrowth from cerebellar granule neurons. Given prior evidence that glycosphingolipid biosynthesis inhibitors and anti-ganglioside antibodies reverse the inhibition of axon outgrowth by MAG (4Vyas A.A. Patel H.V. Fromholt S.E. Heffer-Lauc M. Vyas K.A. Dang J. Schachner M. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8412-8417Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), we conclude that gangliosides rather than O-linked glycoproteins are the major MAG ligands on these cells. Whether other sialoglycans have the same function in other types of neurons has yet to be determined. The results reported here establish that monovalent sialoglycans with high MAG binding affinity effectively enhance axon outgrowth in vitro by reversing MAG-mediated inhibition. In combination with other small molecules, antibodies, or enzymes that reverse other axon regeneration inhibitors, sialoglycans may eventually provide a means to improve recovery after CNS injury."

Neurospora Tom5 crosses the outer membrane with its carboxyl terminus facing the intermembrane space like the other small Tom components. The temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of the yeast TOM5 deletion was rescued by overexpression of Neurospora Tom5. On the other hand, Neurospora cells deficient in tom5 did not exhibit any defect in growth. The structural stability of TOM complexes from cells devoid of Tom5 was significantly altered in yeast but not in Neurospora. The efficiency of protein import in Neurospora mitochondria was not affected by deletion of tom5, whereas in yeast it was reduced as compared with wild type.

It is a multimeric complex that mediates recognition of preproteins and their transfer across the outer membrane via a general transport pore. Studies on the isolated TOM complex from Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae have provided detailed information about the structure and function of this translocase (7Künkele K.P.

The holocomplex consists of two receptor subunits, Tom70 and Tom20, and the proteins Tom40, Tom22, Tom7, and Tom6. The receptor subunits recognize different subsets of mitochondrial precursor proteins, whereas the other components form the protein-conducting channel complex (13Kassenbrock C.K. Cao W. Douglas M.G.

Hegerl R. Typke D. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Nussberger S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). An additional small subunit of the TOM complex, Tom5, was identified in S. cerevisiae (18Dietmeier K. Hönlinger A. Bömer U. Dekker P.J.T. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Kübrich M. Pfanner N. Nature. 1997; 388: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This protein is associated with the protein-conducting channel. Yeast mitochondria lacking Tom5 were reported to have severe defects in the import of proteins destined for the outer membrane (19Müller A. Rassow J. Grimm J. Machuy N. Meyer T. Rudel T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1916-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), intermembrane space (20Kurz M. Martin H. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Ryan M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2461-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), inner membrane, and matrix compartment (18Dietmeier K. Hönlinger A. Bömer U. Dekker P.J.T. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Kübrich M. Pfanner N. Nature. 1997; 388: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This was taken to suggest that Tom5 is crucial for protein import to all mitochondrial subcompartments. In yeast mitochondria, Tom5 is anchored in the outer membrane by a single transmembrane segment. Its primary structure revealed a cytosolic domain that carries a net negative charge. This feature led to the hypothesis that Tom5 guides positively charged mitochondrial targeting sequences from the surface receptors to the protein-conducting channel (18Dietmeier K. Hönlinger A. Bömer U. Dekker P.J.T. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Kübrich M. Pfanner N. Nature. 1997; 388: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). A detailed structural analysis of the cytosolic domain of yeast Tom5 was performed using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The cytosolic domain was found to exhibit an α-helical fold with alternating positive and negative charges (21Hammen P.K. Weiner H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The charge topology did not present a pattern complementary to typical amino-terminal mitochondrial presequences. In addition, the structure did not provide a hydrophobic surface that could favorably interact with the hydrophobic face of amphiphilic mitochondrial presequences. In view of the different concepts derived from functional and structural studies we decided to investigate the role of Tom5 in mitochondrial protein import in Neurospora and yeast. We cloned the Neurospora gene and tested whether Tom5 is interchangeable between S. cerevisiae and N. crassa. Although the amino acid sequence of Neurospora Tom5 shares only moderate sequence similarity with the yeast protein, it could substitute for its counterpart in yeast. In contrast to what was observed in yeast, Neurospora Tom5 deletion strains did not exhibit any growth defect. In line with this finding, mitochondria isolated from a N. crassa strain with an inactivated tom5 gene were unimpaired in their capacity to import mitochondrial preproteins. A role of Tom5 as a preprotein receptor was not observed in either organism. Rather our results point to a non-essential structural role of Tom5 in the TOM complex of Neurospora. In yeast, Tom5 appears to be required for maintaining the stability of the TOM complex at higher temperatures. This in turn is a prerequisite for functionality of preprotein import of the mitochondrial outer membrane protein translocation machinery. Strains and Growth Conditions—Growth and manipulation of N. crassa was performed as described previously (22Davis R.H. De Serres F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 79-143Crossref Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Standard procedures were used for the growth of S. cerevisiae cultures. The cells were grown at 30 °C and 37 °C on YP agar plates (1% (w/v) yeast extract and 2% (w/v) Bacto-peptone) containing either 2% (w/v) glucose (YPD) or 3% (v/v) glycerol (YPG). Isolation of Mitochondria and Outer Membrane Vesicles—The preparations of mitochondria and mitochondrial outer membrane vesicles from S. cerevisiae and N. crassa were carried out as described previously (7Künkele K.P. Heins S. Dembowski M. Nargang F.E. Benz R. Thieffry M. Walz J. Lill R. Nussberger S. Neupert W.

Mitochondria used for protein import studies were isolated from the N. crassa wild-type strain 74A, the N. crassa tom5RIP mutant strain, the S. cerevisiae wild-type strain YPH499, the S. cerevisiae tom5Δ mutant strain (a kind gift from Dr. N. Pfanner, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany) and the S. cerevisiae tom5Δ strain rescued by a plasmid carrying the sequence information for a Fis1-Tom5C fusion protein (24Habib S.J. Vasiljev A. Neupert W. Rapaport D. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Isolation of the TOM Core Complex—Large scale purification of TOM core complex was performed according to Ahting et al. (8Ahting U. Thun C. Hegerl R. Typke D. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Nussberger S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) from N. crassa strain GR-107 that carries a hexahistidinyl-tagged tom22 gene instead of the wild-type copy (7Künkele K.P.

After a clarifying by centrifugation the supernatant was passed through a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen), and the resin was washed with 40 mm imidazole. Specifically bound material was eluted with 300 mm imidazole, 50 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2. For further purification, the TOM complex-containing fractions were pooled and transferred to a Resource Q anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% n-dodecyl β-maltoside. TOM core complex was then eluted by a linear 0–500 mm KCl gradient. The protein solution was stored at 4 °C at a concentration between 2 and 5 mg/ml. Mass Spectrometry—Individual subunits of isolated TOM core complex were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Tom5 was prepared for mass spectrometry by in-gel digestion according to procedures described previously (25Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 26Jeno P. Mini T. Moes S. Hintermann E. Horst M. Anal.

Trans. 1996; 24: 893-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Peptides were dried and stored at –20 °C. Salts and detergents were removed by Zip-Tip™ chromatography (C18 reverse phase, Millipore). Wetting, equilibration of the column, peptide binding, washing, and elution of the peptides were performed as described in the Zip-Tip™ user's manual. All mass spectrometric analyzes were carried out on a Micromass™ Q-TOF-1.5 hybrid mass spectrometer (Micromass, UK). The instrument was equipped with a z-electrospray ionization source and a quadrupole and a time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzer as well as a hexapole collision cell. All spectra were acquired in electrospray positive ion mode. For sample introduction, a “medium” nanoelectrospray capillary was used (Micromass Q-TOF, Protana, Denmark). No electrospray ionization gas (nitrogen) or desolvation gas was applied to the capillary. The flow rate was regulated by alteration of the capillary voltage. The quadrupole was set in wide bandpass mode to 300–1500 m/z. Data were acquired in continuum mode. Duration of data collection was about 1 min. 25 scans were averaged at a rate of 2.0 s/scan. For electrospray MS/MS experiments, argon was used as collision gas, and the collision energy varied between 16 and 42 eV depending on the peptide analyzed. For representative spectra, data from 25–50 scans were summed. For optimized spectra the following conditions were applied: electrospray capillary voltage was set to 650–850 V; cone voltage was set to 45 V, and the microchannel plate was set to 2700 V when collecting MS data and to 2850 V for collecting MS/MS data. At first, the MS1 resolution was set to 10 to obtain optimal resolution. In later measurements the resolution was set to 15. MS1 and MS2 were maintained as recommended in the user's guide. Acquired mass spectra were processed using software Mass-Lynx versions 3.4 and 3.5. For calibration, standard solutions of sodium iodide (2 μg/μl) and rubidium iodide (0.05 μg/μl) were dissolved in 50% propan-2-ol (Q-TOF user's guide). Calibration data were acquired over a mass range from 50 to 2000 m/z. Cloning of N. crassa tom5—Based on parts of the Tom5 amino acid sequence, a 153-base genomic sequence was identified from the White-head Institute Neurospora crassa sequence data base (Cambridge, MA; N. crassa contig 3.132). A cDNA version of the N. crassa tom5 gene was amplified from a λ Bluescript cDNA library by the PCR using T5up (5′-CGCGGATCCCGACTTCCATATCAAAATGTTCGG-3′) and T5low (5′-CCCAAGCTTCGAATATTTAGAGAACCTTGCTAACGGC-3′) as primers and cloned into pGEM-T (Promega). The PCR was performed using Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA sequencing was performed using automated fluorescent sequencing technology (MediGenomix). To improve the detection of [35S]methionine-labeled Tom5 by auto-radiography, a tom5 gene encoding two additional methionine residues at the carboxyl terminus was cloned in pGEM-T with its expression under the control of the T7 promoter. The PCRs were carried out using T5up and T5lowMM (5′-CCCAAGCTTTTACATCATGAGAACCTTGCTAACGGCGTCGATAACGAA-3′) as primers. For expression of N. crassa Tom5 in S. cerevisiae, N. crassa tom5 was cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pYX132 under the control of the constitutively active triose-phosphate isomerase promoter (Novagen). The construct and empty vector were transformed into yeast tom5Δ cells that were derived from the isogenic wild-type strain YPH-501 (18Dietmeier K. Hönlinger A. Bömer U. Dekker P.J.T. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Kübrich M. Pfanner N. Nature. 1997; 388: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Antibodies against Tom5 were raised in rabbits using an oligopeptide corresponding to 20 amino-terminal amino acid residues of Tom5 as the antigen (NH2-FQPPALSREELQAAEAEATF-COOH coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin; Pineda Antikörper Service, Berlin, Germany). Construction of an N. crassa Strain Deficient in Tom5—The report of a severe phenotype in tom5 mutants of S. cerevisiae (18Dietmeier K. Hönlinger A. Bömer U. Dekker P.J.T. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Kübrich M. Pfanner N. Nature. 1997; 388: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) suggested that inactivation of tom5 in N. crassa might also cause severe import and growth defects. For this reason, we chose to inactivate the gene using the procedure of “sheltered repeat-induced point mutation (RIP).” This procedure utilizes the natural phenomenon of RIP to inactivate genes in N. crassa (28Selker E.U. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 579-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) and also allows for the maintenance of nuclei containing non-functional alleles of an essential gene in a heterokaryon that also contains nuclei with a wild-type copy of the gene. The rationale and methodology of the procedure have been described previously (29Harkness T.A. Metzenberg R.L. Schneider H. Lill R. Neupert W. Nargang F.E. Genetics. 1994; 136: 107-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tom5 gene was found on chromosome I by examination of the sequence at the N. crassa genome sequencing website (www-genome.wi.mit.edu/annota-tion/fungi/neurospora). A duplication of tom5 was created in the Host I strain by transformation with plasmid pTom5RIPhyg, which contains a 2.5-kb PCR product of the tom5 region of the genome cloned into the hygromycin resistance vector pCSN44. The sheltered RIP cross-yielded several heterokaryotic strains. DNA from these strains was subjected to the PCR using primers specific for the tom5 gene. Heterokaryon Tom5RIPed-35 was chosen as a strain that contained mutations characteristic of RIP in the tom5 gene. Conidiospores from the heterokaryon were streaked onto medium containing all the requirements of the two nuclei that were components of the heterokaryon. Individual colonies were isolated and tested for nutritional requirements. Surprisingly many robust cultures were found to be nicotinamide-requiring, a trait that was diagnostic for the nucleus predicted to carry tom5 genes that had been inactivated by RIP. Analysis of these cultures with antiserum raised against Tom5 revealed a total absence of the protein. Strain Tom5RIPed-35-5 (abbreviated tom5RIP) was chosen for further work. Cross-linking—For cross-linking experiments outer membrane vesicles (50 μg) and purified TOM core complex (1.5 μg) were suspended in 25 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and incubated with 0.1–0.4% (v/v) freshly prepared paraformaldehyde at 25 °C for 20–40 min. Aliquots were removed before and after the addition of the cross-linking reagent. Proteins were directly analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Outer membrane vesicles (100 μg) isolated from wild-type and tom5RIP mitochondria were solubilized in 0.2% n-dodecyl β-maltoside with 50 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 10% glycerol. After clarifying by centrifugation, detergent-solubilized proteins were loaded onto a Superose 6 PC 3.2/20 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the solubilization buffer using the Ettan-LC chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). Protein was eluted at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.04 ml min–1. Individual fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The molecular masses of TOM complexes were calculated using UV spectra of chromatographs of thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (155 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa) as protein standards. Stoichiometry—For the determination of the stoichiometry of Tom5, Tom6, and Tom7, the TOM core complex was isolated from strain GR-107 that had been grown in the presence of [35S]sulfate as described previously (8Ahting U. Thun C. Hegerl R. Typke D. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Nussberger S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The purified TOM core complex was subjected to high Tris/urea SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Radiolabeled proteins were extracted from the gel by incubation of 1-mm gel slices in 10% SDS and quantified by scintillation counting (Tri-Carb 2100TR liquid scintillation analyzer, Canberra-Packard GmbH). The molar ratio between the individual subunits of the TOM complex was calculated based on their number of methionine and cysteine residues. Import of Preproteins into Isolated Mitochondria—Preproteins were synthesized using the TnT® T7/SP6 coupled reticulocyte lysate transcription/translation system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. In vitro transcription from pGEM4 vectors containing the gene of interest was performed with SP6 polymerase. Radiolabeled precursor proteins (2% reticulocyte lysate) were incubated at room temperature with 50 μg of Neurospora or S. cerevisiae mitochondria in 250 mm sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 13 mm ATP, 4.4 mm NADH, 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, for 1–10 min. Import reactions were stopped by addition of ice-cold SEM buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2). Mitochondria were reisolated by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,500 × g, resuspended in SEM buffer, and incubated with proteinase K for 15 min on ice followed by addition of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Import was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and blotting to nitrocellulose membranes. Alternatively reisolated mitochondria were solubilized in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 0.25% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-maltoside at 4 °C, subjected to blue native (BN)-PAGE and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Gel Electrophoresis—BN-PAGE was carried out essentially as described previously (30Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar). Mitochondria (50 μg) were solubilized in 100 mm bis-Tris, pH 7.2, 0.25% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-maltoside. After clarifying by centrifugation, the supernatants (40 μl) were supplemented with 5 μl of sample buffer (5% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, 0.5 m ϵ-amino-n-caproic acid, 100 mm bis-Tris, pH 7.0) and electrophoresed through 6–13% polyacrylamide gradient gels. The cathode and anode buffers for performing the electrophoresis were as described previously (30Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotting were performed according to standard procedures. To achieve a higher resolution of the smaller TOM components high Tris/urea gels were used (7Künkele K.P. Heins S. Dembowski M. Nargang F.E. Benz R. Thieffry M. Walz J. Lill R. Nussberger S. Neupert W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1009-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The chemiluminescence ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were used for immunostaining. Radiolabeled precursor proteins were detected by autoradiography and quantified using the TINA software of the BAS 1500 phosphorimaging system (Fuji Medical Systems). Identification of Neurospora Tom5—Analysis of purified TOM core complex of Neurospora by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a previously unidentified subunit of the TOM complex of ∼5-kDa molecular mass (Fig. 1A). To determine its amino acid sequence the protein was extracted from the gel and sequenced by mass spectrometry. Using parts of the amino acid sequence as queries, the genomic sequence encoding the protein was identified in the N. crassa nucleotide sequence data base (Fig. 1B). The tom5 gene contains two introns and encodes a protein consisting of 50 amino acid residues. The Tom5 sequence can be viewed in GenBank™ under accession number CAE76411. The protein shares 34% sequence identity with Tom5 of S. cerevisiae and 44% sequence identity with an open reading frame of the fungus Botryotinia fuckeliana. The amino acid sequence of Tom5 exhibits a hydropathy profile with one predicted transmembrane segment near the carboxyl terminus, a feature conserved in the proteins of B. fuckeliana and S. cerevisiae (Fig. 1C). The amino-terminal domain of Neurospora Tom5 contains four negatively charged amino acid residues. However, the positions of only two of them are conserved among the three organisms mentioned above. N. crassa Tom5 Is Located Close to the Main Subunit of the Protein-conducting Channel Tom40—Treatment of outer membrane vesicles and of purified TOM core complex with the short length cross-linker formaldehyde yielded adducts between Tom5 and Tom40 (Fig. 2, A and B). This points to a direct contact between Tom5 and the main component of the protein-conducting channel, Tom40. Proteinase K efficiently degraded the large hydrophilic domain of Tom22 exposed to the cytosol, but Tom5 became accessible to degradation only at proteinase K concentrations higher than those required for degradation of Tom40 and Tom22 (Fig. 2C). Thus, Tom5 appears to be shielded by other Tom components. Furthermore we could not detect any fragments of Tom5. As the antibody recognizes an epitope within the amino-terminal part of the protein we conclude that the amino terminus is facing the cytosol. To estimate the molar relationship of Tom5 to the other Tom components we purified TOM core complex from N. crassa cells that were grown in the presence of [35S]sulfate. Analysis of isolated core complex by SDS-PAGE and scintillation counting of extracted protein (Fig. 2D) yielded a molar ratio between Tom5 and the other Tom components Tom40, Tom22, Tom7, and Tom6 of roughly 1:1:1:1:1. To confirm that the newly identified protein is a real subunit of the TOM complex radiolabeled Tom5 was imported into mitochondria isolated from Neurospora. As controls, we studied the integration of the radiolabeled precursors of Tom7, Tom22, and Tom40 into the TOM complex. Imported Tom5 was shown to be present in the mature 400-kDa TOM core complex (Fig. 2E). In contrast to imported Tom40 no low molecular mass import intermediate was observed indicating that Tom5 inserted into a largely assembled TOM complex. Neurospora Tom5 Is a Functional Homolog of Yeast Tom5—To test whether Neurospora Tom5 can substitute for yeast Tom5 we transformed the Neurospora tom5 cDNA into a yeast TOM5 deletion mutant that was described to exhibit a characteristic temperature-sensitive growth defect (18Dietmeier K. Hönlinger A. Bömer U. Dekker P.J.T. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Kübrich M. Pfanner N. Nature. 1997; 388: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Yeast cells lacking tom5 stopped growing when the temperature was raised from 30 to 37 °C (Fig. 3). Expression of Neurospora Tom5 in these cells restored growth. This indicated that the Tom5 proteins in the two fungi are functional equivalents. Depletion of Tom5 in Neurospora Does Not Affect Growth—We used the procedure of sheltered RIP to inactivate the tom5 gene (tom5RIP strain) and found that homokaryotic strains lacking Tom5 could be derived from the sheltered heterokaryons. Mitochondria isolated from the homokaryon were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The expression levels of the other Tom components were similar in mutant and wild-type cells (Fig. 4A). The apparent molecular mass of the complex lacking Tom5 did not differ from that of the wild-type complex (Fig. 4B). In contrast to what was reported for yeast, Neurospora cells deficient in Tom5 did not exhibit a growth defect at either 25 or 42 °C (data not shown). To determine whether a possible suppressor of the inactivated tom5 gene was present in the tom5RIP strain, we crossed it with the standard wild-type strain 74A.Of 36 random progeny examined, 19 were devoid of Tom5, and 17 had normal levels of the protein. No differences in growth rate between the Tom5-deficient strains and the normal strains were observed either from ascospores or during vegetative propagation (not shown). Thus, the possibility of a mutation in another gene suppressing the phenotypic consequences of the Tom5 deficiency was unlikely unless the suppressing gene was very closely linked to the tom5 gene. The most probable suppressors of a Tom5 deficiency might be expected to be other components of the TOM complex that had be"
https://openalex.org/W2126459623,"c-Jun is a transcription factor that plays an important role in regulating cell growth, apoptosis, differentiation, and transformation. The transcriptional activity of c-Jun can be regulated by both phosphorylation and sumoylation. It has also been shown that c-Jun transcription can be regulated by SuPr-1, an alternatively spliced form of SUMO-specific protease 2 (SENP2). However, the ability of SuPr-1 to enhance c-Jun transcription is dependent on promyelocytic leukemia but is independent of the desumoylation activity of SuPr-1. Here, we show that SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1) also markedly enhances the transcription activity of c-Jun. The action of SENP1 on c-Jun transcription is independent of the sumoylation and phosphorylation status of c-Jun but is critically dependent on the desumoylation activity of SENP1. We further show that p300 is essential for SENP1 to enhance c-Jun-dependent transcription because SENP1 can desumoylate the CRD1 domain of p300, thereby releasing the cis-repression of CRD1 on p300. Thus, two SUMO-specific proteases regulate c-Jun-dependent transcription through entirely different mechanisms. c-Jun is a transcription factor that plays an important role in regulating cell growth, apoptosis, differentiation, and transformation. The transcriptional activity of c-Jun can be regulated by both phosphorylation and sumoylation. It has also been shown that c-Jun transcription can be regulated by SuPr-1, an alternatively spliced form of SUMO-specific protease 2 (SENP2). However, the ability of SuPr-1 to enhance c-Jun transcription is dependent on promyelocytic leukemia but is independent of the desumoylation activity of SuPr-1. Here, we show that SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1) also markedly enhances the transcription activity of c-Jun. The action of SENP1 on c-Jun transcription is independent of the sumoylation and phosphorylation status of c-Jun but is critically dependent on the desumoylation activity of SENP1.

Recent studies indicate that SENP1 and SENP2 can regulate the transcriptional activity of transcription factors. SENP1 is a nuclear protease that can enhance androgen receptor-dependent transcription through the desumoylation of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) (39Cheng J. Wang D. Wang Z. Yeh E.T. Mol. Cell.

A spliced isoform of mouse SENP2, called SuPr1, acts as a transcriptional regulator to induce c-Jun and Sp3 activity (29Ross S. Best J.L. Zon L.I. Gill G. Mol.

In this study, we show that SENP1 can induce c-Jun-dependent transcription. In contrast to that of SuPr1, the desumoylation activity of SENP1 is absolutely required for its ability to induce c-Jun-dependent transcription. We show that p300 is essential for the activation of c-Jun-dependent transcription by SENP1. Furthermore, SENP1 can desumoylate p300 and release the repression of SUMO-CRD1, leading to an increase in p300 transactivation. Our findings demonstrate a difference between SENP1 and SENP2 in the regulation of c-Jun-dependent transcription and provide a novel mechanism for regulating c-Jun-dependent transcription.

The SENP1 and nonspecific siRNA oligonucleotides were inserted into the pSuppressorNeo vector (IMGENEX Corporation) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PC-3 cells were grown in 6-well plates and transfected with the siRNA plasmid (1 μg) three times at 12-h intervals using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The cells were harvested 72 h after transfection. Expression of SENP1 and c-Jun was detected by using real-time PCR (for SENP1) and Western blot (for c-Jun). SENP1 Is a Stronger Activator of c-Jun than SENP2—Best et al. (32Best J.L. Ganiatsas S. Agarwal S. Changou A. Salomoni P. Shirihai O. Meluh P.B. Pandolfi P.P. Zon L.I. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 843-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) reported that SuPr-1, an alternatively spliced form of SENP2, could induce c-Jun-dependent transcription. Because both SENP1 and SENP2 belong to the SUMO-specific protease family with broad substrate specificity (41Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), we speculated that SENP1 might also be an activator of c-Jun. To test this hypothesis, we performed a luciferase reporter gene assay by using Gal4 fused to the transactivation domain (1–223) of c-Jun (G4-c-Jun) and the Gal4-luciferase reporter plasmid. When expressed in PC-3 cells, SENP1 markedly induced G4-c-Jun-dependent transcription (Fig. 1A). SENP1 exhibited stronger activation of c-Jun-dependent transcription than SENP2. Titration of SENP1 showed a dose-dependent effect of SENP1 on c-Jun-dependent transcription (Fig. 1B). The effects of SENP1 in different cell lines, such as 293, MCF-7, HeLa, and U-2OS cells, were tested, and cell type specificity was not observed (data not shown). These results suggest that SENP1 can function as a strong activator of c-Jun-dependent transcription. A previous study indicated that desumoylation activity was not required for SuPr-1, a splice variant of SENP2, to induce c-Jun activity (32Best J.L. Ganiatsas S. Agarwal S. Changou A. Salomoni P. Shirihai O. Meluh P.B. Pandolfi P.P. Zon L.I. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 843-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We similarly observed that the catalytic mutant of SENP2 actually induces more c-Jun activity than wild-type SENP2 (Fig. 1A). However, these two proteases SENP1 and SENP2 diverged in their effects on c-Jun-dependent transcription. In contrast to SENP2, the action of SENP1 on c-Jun is dependent on its catalytic activity, as the catalytic inactive mutation markedly reduced the effect of SENP1 on c-Jun-dependent transcription (Fig. 1A). We confirmed this result by increasing the amount of SENP1 mutant transfected, which did not prompt any significant change in c-Jun-dependent transcription (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis insured that the wild-type and mutant SENP1 were expressed at similar levels and did not alter G4-c-Jun expression (Fig. 1C). Collectively, these data suggest that the action of SENP1 on c-Jun-dependent transcription, unlike that of SENP2, is mediated through a desumoylation mechanism. To determine whether SENP1 could affect transcription of an endogenous promoter, we examined the effect of SENP1 on the c-Jun promoter (–79/+170), which contains AP-1 binding sites in the –72 position (53Han T.H. Lamph W.W. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4472-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 54Angel P. Hattori K. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, SENP1 induced c-Jun promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. The catalytic activity of SENP1 is also required for this effect. We also examined whether the effect of SENP1 on the c-Jun promoter is through the AP-1 binding site. The mutation of the AP-1 binding site markedly abolished the activity of the c-Jun promoter by SENP1 (Fig. 1D). To further confirm the effect of SENP1 on c-Jun-dependent transcription, we used siRNA to silence endogenous SENP1 and then examined whether the expression of endogenous c-Jun, a target dependent on c-Jun transactivation, was affected. The transfection of the SENP1-specific siRNA plasmid into PC-3 cells decreased endogenous SENP1 expression by 53% (real-time PCR analysis, data not shown), whereas expression of SENP1-siRNA reduced endogenous c-Jun expression by 60% (Fig. 1E). Collectively, these data indicate that SENP1 can strongly activate c-Jun-dependent transcription through its desumoylation activity. SENP1 Activation of c-Jun Is Independent of Phosphorylation—c-Jun is a transcription factor involved in the JNK signaling pathway (2Eferl R. Wagner E.F. Nat. Rev.

Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 199-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). JNK modulates c-Jun-dependent transcription through phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser-63 and Ser-73 (8Minden A. Lin A. Smeal T. Derijard B. Cobb M. Davis R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism underlying c-Jun activation by SENP1, we first examined whether SENP1 could indirectly induce phosphorylation of c-Jun. Anti-phosphorylated c-Jun antibody was used to identify G4-c-Jun phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 2A, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a stimulator of the JNK pathway, strongly induced c-Jun phosphorylation; however, co-expression of SENP1 and the SENP1 mutant could not induce the phosphorylation of G4-c-Jun (Fig. 2A). We also used the G4-c-Jun S63A, S73A construct in which Ser-63 and Ser-73 are mutated to Ala to perform the luciferase reporter assay. Mutation of both Ser-63 and Ser-73 to Ala did not affect the ability of SENP1 to induce G4-c-Jun activity (Fig. 2B), whereas PMA induction of c-Jun was abolished by the mutation (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the action of SENP1 on c-Jun-dependent transcription is not mediated through a phosphorylation mechanism. SENP1-Inducing c-Jun Transcriptional Activity Occurs Independently of c-Jun Desumoylation—c-Jun could be conjugated by SUMO at amino acid 229 (40Muller S. Berger M. Lehembre F. Seeler J.S. Haupt Y. Dejean A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13321-13329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Although the G4-c-Jun plasmid used in the above experiments only contained amino acids 1–223 of the c-Jun transactivation domain and thus could not be sumoylated, it is still possible that c-Jun transcriptional activity induced by SENP1 is dependent on its sumoylation status in vivo. To test this possibility, we generated G4-c-Jun full-length and G4-c-Jun full-length sumoylation mutant (K229R) plasmids. The mutant was then compared with the wild-type p"

The closely related ERM proteins (ezrin, radixin, and moesin) act as linkers between the cell membrane and cytoskeleton, and have also been implicated as active actin reorganizers. We report here that merlin and the ERMs can interact with and regulate N-WASP, a critical regulator of actin dynamics. Merlin and moesin were found to inhibit N-WASP-mediated actin assembly in vitro, a function that appears independent of their ability to bind actin. Furthermore, exogenous expression of a constitutively active ERM inhibits N-WASP-dependent Shigella tail formation, suggesting that the ERMs may function as inhibitors of N-WASP function in vivo.

Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). ERMs bind membrane proteins through their N-terminal FERM (band 4.1, ERM) domain and actin filaments through their C terminus, thus linking the cell membrane to the underlying cytoskeleton. Merlin, the protein product of the Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene, is closely related to the ERMs (2.Trofatter J.A. MacCollin M.M. Rutter J.L. Murrell J.R. Duyao M.P. Parry D.M.

The FERM domain of merlin and ERMs is the region of highest homology and can interact with various membrane proteins. The C terminus of ERMs contains a high affinity actin-binding site that is not conserved in merlin. However, merlin also directly binds F-actin through its FERM domain and stabilizes actin filaments in vitro (4.Brault E. Gautreau A. Lamarine M. Callebaut I. Thomas G. Goutebroze L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1901-1912PubMed Google Scholar, 5.James M.F. Manchanda N. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Hartwig J.H. Ramesh V. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). ERMs and merlin are regulated by an intramolecular head-to-tail association between the FERM domain and the C terminus that prevents binding of membrane partners as well as F-actin (6.Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The autoinhibited conformation of the ERMs can be disrupted by polyphosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) binding or phosphorylation at a conserved C-terminal threonine. The role of ERMs and merlin in actin cytoskeleton reorganization has been well documented. In cultured cells, they localize to actin-rich regions such as microvilli, lamellipodia, filopodia, and neuronal growth cones. Antisense suppression of ERMs can disrupt microvilli and slow growth cone advancement (7.Takeuchi K. Sato N. Kasahara H. Funayama N. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 8.Paglini G. Kunda P. Quiroga S. Kosik K. Caceres A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 443-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The absence of merlin, either in schwannoma cells from NF2 patients, or mouse embryo fibroblasts from NF2-deficient mice, results in increased membrane ruffling and cell motility (9.Shaw R.J. Paez J.G. Curto M. Morse Pruit W. Saotome I. O'Bryan J.P. Gupta V. Ratner N. Der C.J. Jacks T. McClatchey A.I. Dev.

Biol. 2002; 22: 1150-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus merlin may negatively regulate actin remodeling in vivo. These cellular phenotypes caused by merlin or ERM loss can be partially explained by their structural role as membrane-cytoskeleton linkers. In addition, merlin and ERMs are regulated by Rho family GTPases via phosphorylation and also alter GTPase function through a negative feedback mechanism, thereby regulating the actin cytoskeleton indirectly (9.Shaw R.J. Paez J.G. Curto M. Morse Pruit W. Saotome I. O'Bryan J.P. Gupta V. Ratner N. Der C.J. Jacks T. McClatchey A.I. Dev.

Nature. 2003; 421: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown whether these proteins can directly alter actin nucleation and assembly downstream of Rho, Rac, or Cdc42. We examined whether merlin and ERMs could directly regulate the actin polymerization pathway downstream of these GTPases. The WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) family proteins, upon activation by Rac and Cdc42, are capable of activating actin assembly by the actin nucleating Arp2/3 complex (12.Millard T.H. Sharp S.J. Machesky L.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Cdc42 binds and activates N-WASP, a ubiquitously expressed member of the WASP family, which in turn stimulates Arp2/3 complex activity. WIP (WASP interacting protein) interacts with the WH1 domain of N-WASP and inhibits its function in vitro and in vivo (13.Martinez-Quiles N. Rohatgi R. Anton I.M. Medina M. Saville S.P. Miki H.

Furthermore, merlin and ERMs can regulate N-WASP function in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating a novel, direct mechanism for their effect on actin reorganization and a new mode of N-WASP regulation. Materials and Antibodies—HA-radixin full-length (FL) and N-term and C-term plasmids were a gift from F. Solomon (MIT, Cambridge, MA). Mutants FL HA-radixin (T564E and T564A) were provided by S. Tsukita (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). Myc-tagged N-WASP constructs were described previously (15.Rohatgi R. Ho H.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Mini-N-WASP was provided by W. Lim (University of California, San Francisco, CA). The anti-WAVE, anti-N-WASP, and anti-WIP antibodies have been described (13.Martinez-Quiles N. Rohatgi R. Anton I.M. Medina M. Saville S.P. Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Takenawa T. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S.

Anti-Nck and anti-Myc 9E10 antibodies were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories and Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, respectively. Phospho-ERM antibody 3141 and anti-HA antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies and Covance, respectively. Pull-down Assays—Merlin and moesin GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described (18.Gonzalez-Agosti C. Wiederhold T. Herndon M.E. Gusella J. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34438-34442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). 293T lysates were incubated with 200pmol of immobilized merlin or moesin GST fusion protein. Lysate lane shows 10% of input. For pull-down assays using in vitro transcribed and translated N-WASP truncations, the SP6 Quick Coupled kit (Promega) was used with 2 μg of each N-WASP plasmid. The lysate lane shows 5% of input. Direct binding in solution was carried out with recombinant N-WASP (0.32 μg) and GST-purified moesin constructs (10 μg) as described (15.Rohatgi R. Ho H.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The input N-WASP lane contains 40% of total input. Immunoprecipitation—IP was performed using 293T lysate and 5 μg of merlin antibody 1C4 or mouse IgG followed by Western blotting with anti-N-WASP antibody. Merlin IP was detected by anti-merlin C26H antibody. The reverse IP used 5 μg affinity purified N-WASP rabbit antibody or normal rabbit serum as a control and was detected by merlin antibody. For phospho-ERM interaction, HeLa cells were treated for 5 min with calyculinA (50 nm) before harvesting in lysis buffer (as above with 100 nm calyculinA). The N-WASP IP was performed with 8 μg of affinity-purified N-WASP or rabbit IgG, followed by Western blotting with the phospho-ERM and N-WASP antibodies. Actin Polymerization Assays—N-WASP and Cdc42 were purified as described (16.Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Actin from rabbit skeletal muscle and purified Arp2/3 complex were a generous gift of F. Nakamura and J. H. Hartwig (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA). G-actin was freshly thawed at 4 °C and centrifuged at 400,000 × g for 1 h to remove F-actin. Polymerization assays were carried out as described (16.Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Briefly, actin was mixed with pyrene-labeled actin at a ratio of 3:2 and was used at a final concentration of 1 μm in a total volume of 80 μl of Xenopus buffer. Merlin and moesin proteins were preincubated with other proteins such as N-WASP, Arp2/3 complex, and Cdc42-GTPγS before the reaction was initiated by addition of actin mixture. The increase in fluorescence was measured by a spectrofluorimeter. Shigella Infections and Immunofluorescence—SV40 transformed mouse embryo fibroblast-like cells from N-WASP-deficient animals (28.Snapper S.B. Takeshima F. Anton I. Liu C.H. Thomas S.M. Nguyen D.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) were transduced with pLNCX-GFP-N-WASP retrovirus and sorted to enrich rescued cells. 18 h after radixin transfection, cells were infected with Shigella flexneri strain 2457T as described by Shibata et al. (33.Shibata T. Takeshima F. Chen F. Alt F.W. Snapper S.B. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 341-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence analysis was performed after lysis with 0.1% Nonidet P-40, using anti-HA antibody to detect transfected radixin, followed by incubation with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories) and Alexa-fluor 488-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) to detect actin. Coverslips were mounted in ProFade Gold medium containing DAPI (Molecular Probes) to visualize bacteria. Infected cells (with at least five bacteria) were examined and scored for transfection and at least one actin comet tail. The percentage of transfected cells with actin tails was normalized to untransfected cells with tails on the same coverslip. Values were means from three independent experiments in which a total of >150 transfected cells were examined for each construct (except for the constitutively active radixin T564E where 346 transfected cells were counted). The samples were analyzed by Olympus Provis AX70 microscope, 100× oil immersion lens, Magna-Fire S99806 camera, using MagnaFIRE acquisition software and pseudo-colored using Adobe Photoshop. To investigate the potential interaction between merlin/ERMs and proteins involved in Rac/Cdc42 signaling to actin, we performed pull-down assays using GST fusions encoding various merlin and moesin domains. Both merlin and moesin precipitated endogenous N-WASP from fibroblast and 293T cell lysates (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). WAVE, another WASP family member, and the Arp2/3 complex were not detected in these precipitates (not depicted). The full-length (FL) and N-terminal FERM domains (N-term) of both merlin and moesin precipitated N-WASP, whereas the C-terminal domains (C-term) and GST alone did not. The reduced binding of FL moesin is presumably a result of its closed conformation. The intramolecular association of merlin, unlike moesin, is more dynamic, which allows greater accessibility (1.Bretscher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). We compared binding to NHE-RF, an established FERM interactor, in the same assay. As expected, both merlin and moesin FERM domains precipitated NHE-RF, whereas C-term and GST alone did not (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, NHE-RF and N-WASP bind the FERM domain in distinct ways. NHE-RF displayed higher affinity for moesin FERM, as has been reported previously (18.Gonzalez-Agosti C. Wiederhold T. Herndon M.E. Gusella J. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34438-34442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). On the contrary, N-WASP bound both FERM domains similarly, suggesting that it probably binds different residues than NHE-RF, which are highly conserved between the two FERM domains. We also tested whether other proteins that associate with N-WASP precipitated in the same assay. Nck, an adaptor protein that regulates N-WASP function through its proline-rich domain (20.Rohatgi R. Nollau P. Ho H.Y. Kirschner M.W. Mayer B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26448-26452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 21.Frischknecht F. Moreau V. Rottger S. Gonfloni S. Reckmann I. Superti-Furga G. Way M. Nature. 1999; 401: 926-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), did not precipitate along with N-WASP (Fig. 1A, lower panel). WIP exists in a complex with N-WASP but is expressed mostly in hematopoietic cells, and we could not detect a significant amount in the cells used in this assay (not depicted). N-WASP integrates signals from various sources by interacting with distinct partners through each of its domains. To investigate which of these domains mediates the FERM domain interaction, we used in vitro transcribed and translated (IVTT) N-WASP peptides in a GST pull-down assay. Three Myc-tagged N-WASP IVTT products were tested for binding to the merlin FERM domain GST fusion protein (Fig. 1B). WH1 and WGP (WH1, G protein-binding region, proline-rich domain) polypeptides were capable of binding, whereas the VCA (verprolin homology, cofilin homology, acidic) was not, indicating that the WH1 domain is sufficient. This is a region conserved between N-WASP and WASP, but not WAVE/Scar proteins, which supports our finding that WAVE does not interact with merlin or moesin. To determine whether the FERM-N-WASP interaction is direct, we performed a solution binding assay using purified GST-moesin and purified, untagged N-WASP, followed by precipitation of GST fusion proteins. Both moesin FERM domain and FL moesin showed direct binding as compared with C-term alone (Fig. 1C) and FERM moesin bound FL N-WASP in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). To examine the interaction between merlin and N-WASP in vivo, we performed co-immunoprecipitation using 293T cell lysates. Anti-merlin antibody specifically precipitated endogenous N-WASP along with endogenous merlin and conversely, the N-WASP antibody precipitated both merlin and N-WASP (Fig. 1E). Although moesin and merlin were both capable of interacting with N-WASP in pull-down assays, we were unable to detect any ERMs in N-WASP immunoprecipitates, suggesting that their tightly closed conformation in vivo renders them inaccessible. Phosphorylation of a conserved C-terminal threonine has been shown to stabilize the open conformation of ERMs (22.Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J.

Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). To enrich phosphorylated ERMs, we treated HeLa cells with a Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitor (calyculinA) and used an ERM antibody that recognizes the conserved C-terminal phospho-Thr. Using the N-WASP antibody for immunoprecipitation, we detected a significant association between the phosphorylated, active ERMs and N-WASP in vivo (Fig. 1F). We also performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using FLAG-merlin FERM domain and Myc-N-WASP WH1 domain, which confirmed that these regions were sufficient to mediate the interaction in vivo. 2N. Manchanda and V. Ramesh, unpublished data. The ERMs are more similar to each other within the FERM domain (87% identity) than to merlin (63%). Given this high degree of similarity, and the fact that two ERMs and merlin can co-immunoprecipitate with N-WASP, it is likely that all three ERMs interact similarly with N-WASP. Therefore, we assume that any functional consequence of FERM domain-N-WASP binding will apply to ezrin, radixin, and moesin. To assess the relevance of the interaction between merlin/ERMs and N-WASP, we examined the effect of these proteins on N-WASP induced Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization in vitro. The kinetics of actin polymerization can be monitored using pyrene-labeled actin, which displays an increase in fluorescence intensity when incorporated into filaments. Full-length N-WASP, being auto-inhibited in vitro, requires binding of activators such as Cdc42 or PIP2 (16.Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of merlin/ERMs on full-length N-WASP activated by Cdc42 and found that merlin and moesin proteins that contained the FERM domain inhibited the rate of actin assembly. The merlin FERM domain caused a dose-dependent decrease in the rate of actin polymerization when added to actin, Arp2/3 complex, N-WASP, and Cdc42 (Fig. 2A). FERM domain and FL moesin also functioned similarly in this assay (Fig. 2B) as did FL merlin (not depicted). Despite FERM domain binding N-WASP more robustly than FL proteins in the pull-down assays, their effect appears similar in kinetics, probably due to the higher sensitivity of the actin polymerization assay. Thus, all proteins that demonstrated binding to N-WASP in the pull-down assay were able to inhibit N-WASP-mediated actin polymerization. The C termini of moesin (Fig. 2C) and merlin (not depicted), which cannot bind N-WASP, had no effect, confirming the specificity of this result. The C terminus of the ERMs contains the F-actin-binding site. The fact that we observed no effect of this region in our assay indicates that F-actin binding does not contribute to the inhibition we observed, and indeed it is the FERM domain binding to N-WASP that mediates this function. To determine whether interaction with the WH1 domain mediated this inhibition, we utilized a mini-N-WASP protein. This protein lacks the WH1 and proline-rich domains but is still capable of auto-inhibitory binding of the GBD to the VCA, which is relieved by Cdc42, enabling Arp2/3 complex activation (24.Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Mullins R.D. Lim W.A. Science. 2000; 290: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Unlike full-length N-WASP which was inhibited strongly (Fig. 2, A and B), mini-N-WASP was unaffected by the same concentration of FERM merlin and FL moesin (Fig. 2D). We also tested the ability of merlin and moesin to inhibit VCA domain function and found none (not depicted), confirming that N-WASP polypeptides that are able to activate Arp2/3 complex but lack the WH1 domain are not inhibited. This also demonstrates that merlin and moesin have no effect on other components including Cdc42, the Arp2/3 complex, and actin itself in this assay. Interestingly, WIP and its related proteins (CR16 and WICH) also bind the WH1 domain and WIP inhibits N-WASP mediated actin polymerization in a similar assay (13.Martinez-Quiles N. Rohatgi R. Anton I.M. Medina M. Saville S.P. Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Takenawa T. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Ramesh N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 25.Kato M. Miki H.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11306-11311Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In summary, merlin and moesin inhibit N-WASP function in actin assembly in vitro through binding of their FERM domains to the WH1 domain of N-WASP. These results provide the first example of proteins unrelated to WIP binding the WH1 domain and suppressing N-WASP activity. The enteroinvasive pathogen S. flexneri uses host cell actin polymerization machinery to propel itself within and between cells. The Shigella surface protein IcsA recruits host cell N-WASP to activate the Arp2/3 complex and form an actin comet tail (27.Egile C. Loisel T.P. Laurent V. Li R. Pantaloni D. Sansonetti P.J. Carlier M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). This process is completely dependent on the presence of N-WASP as N-WASP-deficient cells permit Shigella entry but not subsequent tail formation and motility (28.Snapper S.B. Takeshima F. Anton I. Liu C.H. Thomas S.M. Nguyen D. Dudley D. Fraser H. Purich D. Lopez-Ilasaca M. Klein C. Davidson L. Bronson R. Mulligan R.C. Southwick F. Geha R. Goldberg M.B. Rosen F.S. Hartwig J.H. Alt F.W. Nat.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) providing a reliable assay to study the effect of ERMs on N-WASP function in vivo. Ezrin, a member of the ERM family, is required for Shigella entry into HeLa cells. Overexpressing its FERM domain, which exerts a dominant negative effect on ezrin function, causes a decrease in Shigella entry (30.Skoudy A. Nhieu G.T. Mantis N. Arpin M. Mounier J. Gounon P. Sansonetti P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2059-2068PubMed Google Scholar). We evaluated the in vivo relevance of the ERM-N-WASP interaction by examining the effect of exogenous ERMs on actin tail formation. ERMs were chosen because merlin and moesin FERM domains behaved similarly in binding and inhibiting N-WASP in vitro. Moreover, the physical separation of N-WASP and actin-binding domains in ERMs, unlike merlin, ensured that any effect of direct actin binding on tail formation would be evident. Radixin was chosen as we had access to several expression constructs and because we observed no difference between the various FERM domains with respect to N-WASP binding and regulation (Figs. 1 and 2). We used HA-tagged FL, N-term, C-term, and active and inactive mutants of radixin. Constitutively active radixin T564E is a phosphomimetic mutant that renders the protein open, whereas the inactive T564A mutant cannot be phosphorylated and is closed. After transfection of radixin constructs into fibroblasts and infection with Shigella, cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence. Due to the marked inhibition of Shigella entry caused by FERM domain overexpression (30.Skoudy A. Nhieu G.T. Mantis N. Arpin M. Mounier J. Gounon P. Sansonetti P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2059-2068PubMed Google Scholar), which we also confirmed in our experiments, we were unable to evaluate whether this construct inhibited tail formation. All other radixin constructs did not significantly alter Shigella entry and were evaluated for their effect on tail formation. We found that constitutively active radixin T564E inhibited actin tail formation by 60% (Fig. 3A). Constitutively inactive T564A had no such inhibitory effect (Fig. 3B). FL, wild-type radixin, which is probably in the closed conformation in vivo, did not significantly inhibit tail formation (Fig. 3C). Our co-immunoprecipitation results indicated that only phosphoERMs bind N-WASP (Fig. 1F), suggesting that the phosphomimetic ERM is the only transfected construct able to bind N-WASP and thereby inhibit tail formation. The free radixin C-term, which binds actin had no effect despite co-localizing with F-actin in the tails (supplemental Fig. S2), supporting our conclusion that the inhibition is probably mediated through N-WASP binding. To confirm that the active mutant inhibited tail formation by inhibiting N-WASP, we co-transfected it with N-WASP and observed a large increase in tail formation compared with mutant T564E alone (Fig. 3C). Exogenous N-WASP alone has been shown to have no significant effect on Shigella tail formation (31.Moreau V. Frischknecht F. Reckmann I. Vincentelli R. Rabut G. Stewart D. Way M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Thus the inhibition we observe is likely a consequence of ERM inhibition of N-WASP and not an indirect effect of overexpressing active radixin. Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 activity is dispensable for tail formation (32.Mounier J. Laurent V. Hall A. Fort P. Carlier M.F. Sansonetti P.J. Egile C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2069-2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Shibata T. Takeshima F. Chen F. Alt F.W. Snapper S.B. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 341-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), supporting the conclusion that active ERM is not functioning by altering the activity of these GTPases. Together, these results suggest that constitutively active radixin inhibits N-WASP dependent Shigella tail formation through their interaction in vivo. These results confirm the observations made using the actin assembly assays. The in vitro assays facilitated our ability to assess free FERM domain function because the dominant negative effect seen in vivo was eliminated. Interestingly, FL ERM was able to inhibit N-WASP in vitro (Fig. 2B), whereas FL wild-type ERM did not have a significant effect in vivo. This apparent contradiction can be explained by the fact that GST fusion ERMs can be less tightly closed than ERMs in vivo. Therefore, we observe GST-FL ERM binding and inhibiting N-WASP in vitro, whereas in vivo, there is no detectable effect on tail formation due to the inability of N-WASP to bind FL ERMs unless they are phosphorylated. We were able to address this problem by using the phosphomimetic, active FL ERM, which was found to inhibit tail formation. Use of this T564E mutant also enabled us to assess the effect of the FERM domain on tail formation because, unlike the free FERM domain, this construct does not inhibit bacterial entry. N-WASP recruitment to the surface of Shigella is mediated through the interaction of its WH1 and GBD domains with IcsA (29.Lommel S. Benesch S. Rottner K. Franz T. Wehland J. Kuhn R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Since the FERM domains of merlin/ERMs bind the WH1 domain of N-WASP, we examined whether active radixin disrupted the recruitment of N-WASP, thereby inhibiting tail formation. However, N-WASP was still able to localize correctly to the pole of bacteria in cells transfected with active mutant.2 This does not, therefore, appear to be the mechanism of ERM inhibition. It is possible that FERM domain binding causes a conformational change within N-WASP and/or interferes with binding of specific activators. N-WASP activity was previously thought to be regulated by the auto-inhibitory interactions between the GBD and VCA domains. It has recently emerged, however, that WIP-WH1 interaction negatively regulates N-WASP function in vivo, indicating that N-WASP is subject to additional levels of regulation through the WH1 domain (13.Martinez-Quiles N. Rohatgi R. Anton I.M. Medina M. Saville S.P. Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Takenawa T. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Ramesh N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 14.Ho H.Y.

To our knowledge, this report represents the first example of a protein unrelated to WIP functioning as an N-WASP inhibitor. Our finding that merlin/ERM inhibition of N-WASP function may also be mediated through this domain raises the possibility that the WH1 domain may serve as a general negative regulatory module for N-WASP. Most mutations in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome patients map to the WH1 domain of WASP, suggesting that loss of the inhibition imposed by this domain may be the mechanism of disease initiation. Previously, the effect of merlin and ERMs on the actin cytoskeleton was attributed to either binding to actin or to an indirect effect on Rho GTPase signaling. Here, we report that direct binding between the FERM domain of merlin/ERMs and N-WASP can regulate actin assembly independent of their actin binding and GTPase regulation functions. Thus our finding that merlin and ERM proteins can directly regulate N-WASP provides a novel mechanism by which these proteins effect actin reorganization and also represents an alternate means of N-WASP regulation.

https://openalex.org/W1999026765,"RppA is a type III polyketide synthase (PKS) that catalyzes condensation of five molecules of malonyl-CoA to form 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene (THN). In Streptomyces antibioticus IFO13271 and several other Streptomyces species, an open reading frame, named momA, is present as a neighbor of rppA. MomA belonged to the “cupin” superfamily because it contained a set of two motifs that is responsible for binding one equivalent of metal ions. MomA catalyzed monooxygenation of the THN produced from malonyl-CoA by the action of RppA to form flaviolin. In addition, it used several polyketides as substrates and formed the corresponding quinones. MomA required redox-active transition metal ions (Ni2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Fe2+, Mn2+, and Co2+) for its activity, whereas it was inhibited by a redox-inert transition metal ion (Zn2+). MomA neither possessed any flavin prosthetic group nor required nicotinamide cofactors for monooxygenation, which shows that MomA as a member of the cupin superfamily is a novel monooxygenase. Consistent with the catalytic property of MomA, WhiE-ORFII showing similarity in amino acid sequence to MomA and containing a cupin domain also catalyzed monooxygenation of THN. whiE-ORFII is located immediately upstream of the “minimal PKS” gene within the whiE type II PKS gene cluster for biosynthesis of a gray spore pigment in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), and a number of whiE-ORFII homologues are present in the biosynthetic gene cluster for polyketides of type II in various Streptomyces species. These findings show that a novel class of quinone-forming monooxygenases is involved in modification of aromatic polyketides synthesized by PKSs of types II and III.

These findings show that a novel class of quinone-forming monooxygenases is involved in modification of aromatic polyketides synthesized by PKSs of types II and III. Aromatic polyketides are widely distributed in bacteria, fungi, and plants, and their structural diversity reflects the variety of pharmacological and veterinary properties (1O'Hagen D. Mellor J. The Polyketide Metabolites. Ellis Horwood, NY1991Google Scholar). The synthesis of this class of natural products is comprised of the carbon skeleton synthesis by three distinct classes of PKSs 1The abbreviations used are: PKS, polyketide synthase; THN, 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene; DHN, 1,3-dihydroxynaphthalene; EA, emodin anthrone; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ICP-AES, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy; ARD, acireductone dioxygenase; IFO, Institute of Fermentation; BLAST, Basic Local Alignment Search Tool.1The abbreviations used are: PKS, polyketide synthase; THN, 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene; DHN, 1,3-dihydroxynaphthalene; EA, emodin anthrone; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ICP-AES, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy; ARD, acireductone dioxygenase; IFO, Institute of Fermentation; BLAST, Basic Local Alignment Search Tool. (types I–III) and post-PKS tailoring enzymes including oxidation, reduction, glycosylation, halogenation, and so on (2Rix U. Fischer C. Remsing L.L. Rohr J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 542-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In bacteria, the genes for PKS and modification enzymes are usually clustered, forming a polyketide biosynthetic gene cluster. Type I PKSs are multifunctional enzymes that are organized into modules, each of which harbors a set of distinct catalytic domains (3Rawlings J.B. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2001; 18: 190-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 4Rawlings J.B. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2001; 18: 231-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). AviM from Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü57 is an unusual type I PKS, which uses its active site iteratively for the synthesis of the aromatic polyketide moiety of avilamycin A (5Gaisser S. Trefzer A. Stockert S. Kirschning A. Bechthold A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6271-6278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Type II PKSs, exemplified by WhiE for the biosynthesis of a gray polyketide spore pigment of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) (6Davis N.K. Chater K.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1679-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), contain a single set of iteratively used active sites that are carried on separate proteins. Type II PKSs consist of a “minimal PKS” and auxiliary subunits (7Carreras C.W. Khosla C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2084-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 8Bao W. Wendt-Pienkowski E. Hutchinson C.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8132-8138Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The pivotal component of the minimal PKS is a ketosynthase, which is responsible for condensation of acetate building blocks. Type III PKSs are ketosynthases with a homodimeric form, which act iteratively for polyketide chain extension (9Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). RppA, which catalyzes the condensation of five molecules of malonyl-CoA to synthesize THN and is responsible for melanin synthesis in Streptomyces griseus, is a member of type III PKSs (10Funa N. Ohnishi Y. Fujii I. Shibuya M. Ebizuka Y. Horinouchi S. Nature. 1999; 400: 897-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Within a gene cluster for a given polyketide, several enzymes involved in modification of the polyketide skeleton are in most cases encoded. These modification enzymes or post-PKS tailoring enzymes usually play a critical role in contributing to the biological properties exhibited by a variety of polyketide compounds (11Hutchinson C.R. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Therefore, studying the modifications by these enzymes of aromatic polyketides that are synthesized by types II and III PKSs is important and would sometimes lead to discoveries of their novel catalytic properties. These modification enzymes could be employed as a member in so-called combinatorial biosynthesis for the purpose of synthesizing “unnatural” natural compounds. We focused on an open reading frame (momA) that lies immediately downstream of rppA encoding a type III PKS in Streptomyces antibioticus IFO13271. Because RppA synthesizes THN from malonyl-CoA and because momA is located near rppA in several other Streptomyces species, we expected that MomA might be involved in modification of THN. In bacteria, functionally related genes are often organized as an operon or located as neighbors. As expected, MomA was found to catalyze monooxygenation of THN to yield flaviolin. MomA was also found to be necessary to convert flaviolin into mompain, a certain protein in the cell lysate of Streptomyces lividans that, together with MomA, converted flaviolin into mompain. We also characterized WhiE-ORFII, which shows similarity in amino acid sequence to MomA and is encoded within the whiE gene cluster responsible for the synthesis of a gray spore pigment in S. coelicolor A3(2) (6Davis N.K. Chater K.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1679-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The spore pigment is synthesized by a “minimal PKS” (type II PKS) encoded within the gene cluster. In agreement with the sequence similarity between the two enzymes, WhiE-ORFII catalyzed monooxygenation of THN and several other aromatic polyketides to yield the corresponding quinones. MomA and WhiE-ORFII contained a sequence conserved in “cupin” proteins and required redox-active transition metal ions. We therefore propose that MomA and WhiE-ORFII are members of a novel monooxygenase family that is responsible for post-PKS tailoring reactions in polyketide synthesis of both types II and III.

Construction of pET26b-MomA—The nucleotide sequence (TGACTC) covering the TGA stop codon of MomA was changed to CTCGAG to create an XhoI site by PCR with primer I and primer III, 5′-GCGGAATTCCTCGAGGCTCCCACTCTGGTTCGCGT-3′ (the italic letters indicate nucleotides to be changed; the underlined letters indicate an EcoRI site). The amplified 0.6-kb momA fragment was cloned between the HindIII and EcoRI sites of pUC19, resulting in pUC19-C-MomA. The absence of undesired alterations was checked by nucleotide sequencing. The NdeI-XhoI fragment excised from pUC19-C-MomA was cloned between the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET26b, resulting in pET26b-MomA. Construction of pET26b-WhiE-ORFII—The whiE-ORFII gene was amplified by PCR with primer IV, 5′-GCGGAATTCCATATGACAGACCAGCAGGTACGCATCG-3′ (the italic letters indicate nucleotides to be changed; the underlined letters indicate an EcoRI site), and primer V, 5′-GCGAAGCTTGGATCCCATGACACCACCTCGGCCGCGGG-3′ (the italic letters indicate nucleotides to be changed; the underlined letters indicate a HindIII site). The template was the chromosomal DNA of S. coelicolor A3(2) M130. The sense primer IV was designed to change the ATG start codon of whiE-ORFII to an NdeI site, and the antisense primer V was designed to replace the stop codon with a BamHI site. The amplified product was cloned between the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pUC19, and the absence of undesired alterations was checked by nucleotide sequencing. The whiE-ORFII sequence was then excised as a NdeI-BamHI fragment and inserted between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET-26b, resulting in pET26b-WhiE-ORFII. Isolation and Identification of Polyketides Produced by S. lividans Harboring pMF1—S. lividans TK21 harboring pMF1, pMF2, or pMF3 was inoculated to 2 liters of yeast extract malt extract liquid medium containing 5 μg/ml kanamycin and grown at 30 °C. After 17 h, 5 μg/ml of thiostrepton was added to induce the tipA promoter, and the culture was continued for further 24 h. The culture broth was adjusted to pH 1.0 with 6 m HCl, extracted with ethyl acetate, and then passed through a pad of Celite. The Celite was washed with ethyl acetate. The organic layers were combined, washed with brine, and dried with Na2SO4. After evaporation to dryness, the crude material was dissolved in methanol and passed through a Sep-Pak column (Waters) for removal of undesired aliphatic compounds. The sample was lyophilized and dissolved in Me2SO for reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Conditions of HPLC are as follows: ODS-80Ts column (Tosoh) was eluted with a linear gradient from 5 to 40% CH3CN in water (each containing 2% acetic acid) over 30 min and then 100% CH3CN within 10 min at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. UV absorbance was detected at 330 nm. Mompain in the crude sample was purified by reverse phase preparative HPLC (Docosil B, C22, 20 × 250 mm) by a linear gradient from 10 to 40% CH3CN in water (each containing 1% acetic acid) within 60 min at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The collected fractions were lyophilized to give 27 mg of mompain as a purple solid. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CD3OD) δ 6.31 (s, 2H, ArH); 13C NMR (125 MHz, CD3OD) δ 105.1 (C-4a), 112.2 (C-3, C-6), 112.9 (C-8a), 159.1 (C-2, C-7), 168.4 (C-4, C-5), 174.7 (C-1, C-8); high resolution electrospray ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrum was m/z 221.00913 (calculated for C10H5O6, 0.52 mmu error). Production of Recombinant MomA and WhiE-ORFII in E. coli—For production of MomA with a His tag at its N terminus, E. coli BL21 (DE3) harboring pET16b-MomA was grown at 26 °C overnight in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and the cells were collected by centrifugation. For expression of WhiE-ORFII with a His tag at its C terminus, E. coli BL21 (DE3) harboring pET26b-WhiE-ORFII was grown at 37 °C for 3 h in LB medium containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin, followed by induction of the T7 promoter with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After further growth at 37 °C for 2 h, the cells were collected by centrifugation. The cleared cell lysates containing MomA and WhiE-ORFII were prepared by sonication, and removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 10,000 × g was for 30 min. A nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) was used for purification of MomA and WhiE-ORFII from the cleared cell lysates. Protein concentrations were measured with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Gel Filtration and SDS-PAGE Analysis—SDS-PAGE was carried out using the buffer system of Laemmli in 15% polyacrylamide gel, and protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The molecular sizes of recombinant MomA and WhiE-ORFII were determined by gel filtration on a PROTEIN KW-802.5 column (Shodex) that had been equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 150 mm K2SO4. The molecular size standards used are as follows: albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa), and ribonuclease (13.7 kDa). Glutaraldehyde Cross-coupling Analysis—MomA or WhiE-ORFII (10 μg each) was mixed with glutaraldehyde (final concentration, 0.01–0.1%) in 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0) in a total volume of 50 μl and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The reactions were stopped by adding 4 μl of 2 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and applied to SDS-PAGE. Prosthetic Group Investigation of MomA and WhiE-ORFII—For determination of the prosthetic group and metal ion, the standard reaction mixture contained THN (1 μm for MomA and 100 μm for WhiE-ORFII), 500 μm each of organic cofactors or 100 μm each of metal ions in 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), and 0.59 μg of MomA or 56 μgof WhiE-ORFII in a total volume of 400 μl. After the reaction mixture had been preincubated at 30 °C for 5 min, the reaction was initiated by adding THN and incubated for 15 s for MomA and 1 min for WhiE-ORFII. Reactions were stopped by adding 80 μl of 6 m HCl, and the material in the mixture was extracted with 400 μl of ethyl acetate. The organic layer was evaporated, and the residual material was dissolved in 10 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide for HPLC analysis. Reverse phase HPLC conditions were as follows: ODS-80Ts (C18) column (4.6 × 150 mm; Tosoh), maintained at 40 °C, eluted with 25% CH3CN in H2O (each contained 2% acetic acid) with detection at 260 nm; flow rate, 1.0 ml/min. UV spectra were detected on a Waters 996 photodiode array detector. The amount of flaviolin was quantified with the standard curve established using authentic flaviolin, which was prepared by a large scale reaction of MomA using synthetic THN as the substrate. Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) Analysis—The metal contents of MomA and WhiE-ORFII were determined by using ICP-AES (Seiko). For preparation of metal ion-free enzymes, 1,10-phenanthroline (500 μm) or 8-quinolinol (500 μm) was added to MomA (5.5 nm in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0)) or WhiE-ORFII (24 nm in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0)). After 2 h of incubation, the residual chelators were removed by dialysis four times against 2 liters of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). For preparation of metal ion-substituted MomAs, the 1,10-phenanthroline-treated MomAs (1.66 nm) were incubated with 125 μm of metal ions at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by desalting column chromatography (PD-10, Amersham Biosciences) for eliminating unbound metals. Binding of the metals was confirmed by analyzing ICP-AES for each sample. Determination of Kinetic Parameters of MomA and WhiE-ORFII— The reactions, containing 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) and 0.59 μg of MomA or 56 μg of WhiE-ORFII, were performed in a total volume of 400 μl, except for the reaction of THN by MomA, which was performed with 0.29 μg of MomA in 200 μl. The concentrations of THN were 0.1–1.0 μm for MomA and 50–500 μm for WhiE-ORFII. The concentrations of EA and DHN were 10–100 μm. After the reaction mixture had been preincubated at 30 °C for 2–5 min (differed depending on the substrate), the reactions were initiated by adding the substrate and were continued for 15 s for THN, 1 min for DHN, and 5 min for EA for the MomA reactions, and 1 min for THN for the WhiE-ORFII reaction. The reactions were stopped with 40 or 80 μlof6 m HCl, and the material in the mixture was extracted with an equal volume of ethyl acetate. The organic layer was collected and evaporated. The residual material was dissolved in 10 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide for HPLC analysis. The products were separated and quantified by HPLC using the standard curve. Steady-state parameters were determined by the Hanes plot. Identification of the rppA-momA Operon in S. antibioticus—We reported previously (10Funa N. Ohnishi Y. Fujii I. Shibuya M. Ebizuka Y. Horinouchi S. Nature. 1999; 400: 897-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) that rppA, a type III polyketide synthase catalyzing the synthesis of THN from malonyl-CoA, is responsible for melanin biosynthesis in S. griseus. Our preliminary data showed that a gene, named P-450mel, located just upstream of rppA was responsible for the biosynthesis of a dark brown, THN-derived melanin in this strain (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, introduction of a DNA fragment containing rppA and its downstream gene, later named momA, from S. antibioticus IFO13271 in S. lividans resulted in production of a diffusible red pigment. A similar red pigment was found in the culture broth of S. antibioticus IFO13271. The red pigment, which gave a UV spectrum similar to that of the chromophore of flaviolin (data not shown), was distinct from the THN-derived melanin. We therefore supposed that the THN produced by the action of RppA might be converted into melanin by the catalytic activity of P-450mel in S. griseus and into a flaviolin-like compound by the activity of MomA in S. antibioticus. We determined the nucleotide sequence of momA and deduced the amino acid sequence of MomA, as described below. In Saccharopolyspora erythraea, rppA is also required for the biosynthesis of a diffusible pigment (18Cortés J. Velasco J. Foster G. Blackaby A.P. Rudd B.A. Wilkinson B. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The gene organization in the downstream region of rppA in this strain revealed the presence of both P-450mel and momA homologues (Fig. 1A). A similar arrangement of the genes was also found in both S. coelicolor A3(2) (19Bently S.D. Chater K.F. Cerdeño-Tárraga A-M. Challis G.L. Thomson N.R. James K.D. Harris D.E. Quail M.A. Kieser H.

Nakazawa H. Osonoe T. Kikuchi H. Shiba T. Sakaki Y. Hattori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12215-12220Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), in which the complete genome sequences have been reported. A BLAST search predicted that the deduced amino acid sequence of momA from S. antibioticus shares overall similarity among the functionally uncharacterized gene products, SCO1208 in S. coelicolor A3(2) and SAV7129 in S. avermitilis (Fig. 1, A and C). The overall identity in the amino acid sequence of SCO1208, SAV7129, and ORF3 in S. erythraea to S. antibiotics MomA is 57, 58, and 58%, respectively. Another protein (SAV1496) of S. avermitilis was also found as a MomA homologue (43% identity), whereas SAV1496 is not located close to rppA. The gene organizations around momA in S. coelicolor A3(2) and S. avermitilis are the same; P-450mel and momA are present in this order downstream of rppA, as in S. erythraea, and three other genes, assigned as aldehyde dehydrogenase, unknown, and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase genes, are present in the same orientation. We therefore assumed that MomA and P-450mel were physiologically important for pigmentation and melanin synthesis in streptomycetes, although little was known about the functions of these RppA-associated proteins. Thus, we set out to characterize the catalytic properties of MomA in pigment biosynthesis in S. antibioticus, because no P-450mel homologues, which might hamper the characterization of the compound converted from THN by competitively converting it into melanin, were found near the rppA-momA operon. The nucleotide sequence of the 3.2-kb SalI-SphI DNA fragment from S. antibioticus IFO13271 was determined, and open reading frames were predicted by the FramePlot analysis (14Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Schrempf H. Genetic Manipulation in Streptomyces: A Laboratory Manual. John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK1985: 1-356Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B and C). Within the fragment, three open reading frames, rppA, momA, and a gene for a σ factor of RNA polymerase, were encoded. Because the space between the termination codon of rppA and the initiation codon of momA was only 31 bp, these two genes appeared to be transcribed as a single transcriptional unit. The BLAST analysis of MomA toward the conserved domain data base predicted the presence of a barrel domain of the cupin superfamily (Fig. 1C). The characteristic conserved sequences of motif 1 and motif 2 of cupin proteins were designated as G(X)5HXH(X)3–4E(X)6G (X indicates any amino acid) and G(X)5PXG(X)2H(X)3N, respectively (21Dunwell J.M. Purvis A. Khuri S. Phytochemistry. 2004; 65: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The two His residues and the Glu residue in motif 1, together with the His residue in motif 2, act as ligands for the active site metal ion (21Dunwell J.M. Purvis A. Khuri S. Phytochemistry. 2004; 65: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). These residues were all conserved among the MomA sequences in Fig. 1C, suggesting that MomA is a metalloprotein. Although the cupin-fold proteins are widely distributed in Archaea, Eubacteria, and Eukaryota, we could not predict the catalytic function from the results of homology searching. Expression of MomA and RppA in S. lividans—We constructed three plasmids, pMF1 carrying both rppA and momA, pMF2 carrying rppA alone, and pMF3 carrying momA alone (Fig. 1B), by using pIJ6021, and we introduced them by transformation into S. lividans TK21. The genes were all under the control of the thiostrepton-inducible tipA promoter in pIJ6021. After induction of the tipA promoter with thiostrepton, cell extracts were prepared and analyzed by HPLC. S. lividans harboring pMF1 produced two polyketides, neither of which was observed in the control extract prepared from the S. lividans harboring the vector (Fig. 2A). Further fermentation of S. lividans harboring pMF1 resulted in the accumulation of a polar product, which was identified as mompain by proton and carbon NMR spectra, with the aid of heteronuclear multiple bond correlation analysis and a high resolution electrospray ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrum. Mompain was not detected in the extract of S. lividans harboring pMF2. Moreover, whereas THN is an unstable compound"
https://openalex.org/W2141560357,"Antimicrobial peptide structure has direct implications for the complexity of functions and mechanisms of action. The penaeidin antimicrobial peptide family from shrimp is divided into multiple class designations based on primary structure. The penaeidin classes are not only characterized by variability in primary sequence but also by variation in target specificity and effectiveness. Whereas class 4 exhibits low isoform diversity within species and is highly conserved between species, the primary sequence of penaeidin class 3 is less conserved between species and exhibits considerable isoform diversity within species. All penaeidins, regardless of class or species, are composed of two dramatically different domains: an unconstrained proline-rich domain and a disulfide bond-stabilized cysteine-rich domain. The proline-rich domain varies in length and is generally less conserved, whereas the spacing and specific residue content of the cysteine-rich domain is more conserved. The structure of the synthetic penaeidin class 4 (PEN4-1) from Litopenaeus setiferus was analyzed using several approaches, including chemical mapping of disulfide bonds, circular dichroism analysis of secondary structural characteristics, and complete characterization of the solution structure of the peptide by proton NMR. L. setiferus PEN4-1 was then compared with the previously characterized structure of penaeidin class 3 from Litopenaeus vannamei. Moreover, the specificity of these antimicrobial peptides was examined through direct comparison of activity against a panel of microbes. The penaeidin classes differ in microbial target specificity, which correlates to variability in specific domain sequence. However, the tertiary structure of the cysteine-rich domain and indeed the overall structure of penaeidins are conserved across classes.

This is true for many multicellular organisms including both vertebrate and invertebrate animals (1Hoffmann J.A. Nature. 2003; 426: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar, 2Hoffmann J.A.

Ganz T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Many families of AMPs have been identified, and some are of particular interest for direct application to human health (5Jacob L. Zasloff M. Ciba Found. Symp. 1994; 186 (discussion 216 –123): 197-216PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ge Y. MacDonald D. Henry M.M. Hait H.I. Nelson K.A. Lipsky B.A. Zasloff M.A. Holroyd K.J. Diagn. Microbiol. Infect.

Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 782-788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to direct therapeutic application of native AMPs, the potential exists for the enhancement of activity through the use of synthetic peptide derivatives that incorporate atypical or nonnative amino acids, so as to resist natural metabolic proteases, enhance pathogen specificity, and increase effectiveness (8Hamamoto K. Kida Y. Zhang Y. Shimizu T. Kuwano K. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 46: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 9Patch J.A. Barron A.E. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Penaeidins are known to be a diverse family of cationic peptides that, despite their extensive variability in primary structure, target in an almost exclusive manner Gram(+) bacteria and fungi (11Bachère E. Gueguen Y. Gonzalez M. de Lorgeril J. Garnier J. Romestand B. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 198: 149-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 12Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Loew D. Van Dorsselaer A. Rodriguez J. Bachère E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28398-28406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Variability in primary structure has been noted in the form of multiple classes (designated 1/2, 3, and 4) and multiple isoforms of some classes (13Cuthbertson B.J. Shepard E.F. Chapman R.W. Gross P.S. Immunogenetics. 2002; 54: 442-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The typical penaeidin molecule is composed of two domains, an unconstrained proline-rich N-terminal domain (PRD) and a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) with a stable α-helical structure (14Yang Y. Poncet J. Garnier J. Zatylny C. Bachere E. Aumelas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36859-36867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Classes 3 and 4 are the most dissimilar representatives from this peptide family, being distinguished by differences in length and amino acid composition, with class 4 being the shortest and class 3 being the longest member of the family (15Cuthbertson B.J. Büllesbach E.E. Fievet J. Bachere E. Gross P.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Class 4 does not share the conserved Pro-Arg-Pro motif found in many members of classes 2 and 3 across species, and the PRD of class 4 exhibits an independent antimicrobial function not seen in the PRD of class 3 (15Cuthbertson B.J. Büllesbach E.E. Fievet J. Bachere E. Gross P.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Bachère E. Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Aquaculture. 2000; 191: 71-88Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, penaeidin class 3 is characterized by the addition of a 9-amino acid linker region between the PRD and the CRD that is not found in class 4 (Fig. 1). Pairwise comparisons and alignments of many penaeidin family members (PEN4, -3, and -2) from multiple species were the subjects of several descriptions of penaeidin sequences (15Cuthbertson B.J. Büllesbach E.E. Fievet J. Bachere E. Gross P.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Bachère E. Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Aquaculture. 2000; 191: 71-88Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These alignments revealed that PEN4 had a significantly shorter PRD and CRD, mainly due to two deletions of 9 and 6 residues at their C-terminal parts, respectively, resulting in a 47-residue peptide rather than a 63-residue peptide as in PEN3. The common PRD segment of 21 residues displayed only a 47.6% identity with conservation of 4 of 5 proline and 2 of 3 arginine residues. Divergence in primary structure between penaeidin classes is most pronounced in the PRD, but enough sequence dissimilarity exists between the CRD of each penaeidin class to permit phylogenetic classification into the three distinct and accepted classes across the taxonomic family, Penaeidae (17.Cuthbertson, B. J. (2004) Multiple Classes of Penaeidin Antimicrobial Peptides Expressed in Individual Shrimp Exhibit Microbial Target Specificity and a Class-Specific Gain of Function in a Single Domain. Ph.D. dissertation, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SCGoogle Scholar). All penaeidins characterized thus far are generally inactive against Gram(–) bacteria in vitro, including known representatives of marine bacteria that are either normal components of shrimp gut flora or specific aquaculture-related shrimp pathogens (18Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Strub J.M. Van Dorsselaer A. Bachère E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As a group, penaeidins exhibit class-specific activity against specific microbes, with each class having a unique level of effectiveness against certain Gram(+) bacteria and fungi (15Cuthbertson B.J. Büllesbach E.E. Fievet J. Bachere E. Gross P.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), suggesting a partitioning of function in the shrimp immune system that relies on diversification of penaeidin sequence. For example, penaeidin class 4 (PEN4), a recently discovered family member, has a high relative effectiveness against fungal species and certain Gram(+) bacterial species (15Cuthbertson B.J. Büllesbach E.E. Fievet J. Bachere E. Gross P.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), whereas PEN3 exhibits greater effectiveness against other Gram(+) bacterial species. Microbial target specificity may relate to structural characteristics that cannot be deduced directly from primary amino acid sequence comparisons between penaeidin isoforms. In light of this, complete structural characterization of PEN4 was undertaken for comparison with the recently characterized PEN3 (14Yang Y. Poncet J. Garnier J. Zatylny C. Bachere E. Aumelas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36859-36867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Reported here is the chemical determination of the disulfide pattern and complete solution structure as determined by 1H NMR of synthetic PEN4. The PEN4 structure is also compared with that of PEN3, the shortest and longest sequences in this family, respectively. Overall distribution of positively charged and hydrophobic side chains both in the PRD and in the CRD are discussed in terms of antimicrobial activity. Chemical Synthesis—PEN4 was synthesized and initially characterized as described by Cuthbertson et al. (15Cuthbertson B.J. Büllesbach E.E. Fievet J. Bachere E. Gross P.S. Biochem.

Briefly, the proline-rich segment (1–22 residues) was constructed through tert-butyloxycarbonyl chemistry on 3-thiopropionic acid-4-methylbenzhydrylamine resin by solid phase peptide synthesis (19Dawson P.E. Muir T.W. Clark-Lewis I. Kent S.B. Science. 1994; 266: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (3211) Google Scholar, 20Tam J.P. Lu Y.A. Liu C.F. Shao J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12485-12489Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The crude peptide was extracted with 20% acetic acid, desalted, and lyophilized. The cysteine-rich segment (23–47 residues) was synthesized via conventional fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl chemistry and HPLC-purified. The two segments were joined using native chemical ligation following published protocols (19Dawson P.E. Muir T.W. Clark-Lewis I. Kent S.B. Science. 1994; 266: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (3211) Google Scholar, 20Tam J.P. Lu Y.A. Liu C.F. Shao J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12485-12489Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). All products were monitored for purity and mass identity using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Mass to charge ratios (m/z) of each product were calculated directly from the observed spectra and compared with predicted values for each peptide produced. Chemical Determination of PEN4 Disulfide Arrangement—The disulfides of PEN4 were partially reduced, cyanylated, and cleaved at the modified cysteine residues (21Wu J. Watson J.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the fragments were fully reduced at the remaining disulfides, each peptide in separate reactions. Briefly, 10 nmol of the peptide was resuspended in denaturing buffer at pH 3.0, partially reduced with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and the free sulfhydryls were modified with 1-cyano-4-dimethylaminopyridium tetrafluoroborate with all steps done under inert argon gas atmosphere. The modified isomers were subjected to HPLC separation using an ABI-130A chromatography instrument in combination with an Aquapore 300 column (C8, 2.1 × 30 mm). The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% acetonitrile (solvent B), applying a 60-min linear gradient from 20 to 60% B at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. The UV absorbance of the effluent was measured at 230 nm and recorded. The eluted peptides were lyophilized and resuspended in 2 μl of 6 m guanidine HCl, 1 m NH4OH solution, followed by 5 μl of 1 m NH4OH for 1 h resulting in cleavage of the peptide backbone. The solvent was removed by lyophilization, and fragments were resuspended in 2 μl of 0.2 m tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (1 h at 37 °C) for complete reduction of remaining disulfide bonds and diluted with 18 μl of solution A in preparation for analysis by MALDI-TOF MS. Mass Spectrometry—MALDI-TOF MS analysis was performed at the Medical University of South Carolina mass spectrometry facility, and spectra were recorded on either a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager DR instrument or an Applied Biosystems (ABI) Voyager DR-STE instrument using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the ionization matrix. For peptide sequencing of the native PEN4, the ABI 4700 proteomics analyzer was used. For each experiment, peptide was dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (1 μg/μl) and dilution with 3 volumes of 50 mm α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 80% acetonitrile. m/z values are presented directly from the observed spectra in comparison with predicted values for each peptide examined. Circular Dichroism—Molecular ellipticity was measured in the far UV (190 –250 nm) using a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter. The protein was dissolved in water, and the concentration was determined by UV spectroscopy (the calculated extinction coefficient for PEN4 based on the presence of 3 tyrosine residues is 4020 cm–1m–1). The peptide was diluted (1:1, v/v) to a final concentration of 5–50 μm with 50 mm phosphate buffer to assess the effect of concentration on secondary structural characteristics. The structural stabilizing reagent trifluoroethanol (TFE) was added to the 5 μm concentration up to 70% TFE. Measurements were performed using a cell of 0.1-cm path length, at a resolution of 0.2 nm and a bandwidth of 2 nm, and 10 spectra were averaged. NMR Spectroscopy—Solution structure of PEN4 was obtained through proton NMR using the exact method that was used previously for PEN3 (14Yang Y. Poncet J. Garnier J. Zatylny C. Bachere E. Aumelas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36859-36867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). D2O (99.95%) was purchased from the Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique (Saclay, France). The pH values were measured at room temperature with a 3-mm electrode and are given uncorrected for the deuterium isotopic effect. 1H chemical shifts were referenced with respect to sodium 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate according to the IUPAC recommendations. Two samples containing PEN4 (1.0 mm) were prepared in 95:5 H2O/D2O and in 99.98% D2O, respectively. The pH was adjusted to 3.6 by the addition of DCl or NaOD. Proton NMR experiments were performed on both Bruker Avance 600 and Avance 500 spectrometers equipped with a triple resonance probe and with a cryoprobe, respectively. In all experiments, the carrier frequency was set at the center of the spectrum at the water frequency. To identify overlapping spin systems, three sets of spectra were recorded at 12, 20, and 25 °C. Double quantum-filtered correlated spectroscopy (DQF-COSY) (22Rance M. Sorensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar), z-filtered total correlated spectroscopy (z-TOCSY) (23Rance M. J. Magn. Reson. 1987; 74: 557-564Google Scholar), and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) (24Macura S. Huang Y. Suter D. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1981; 43: 259-281Google Scholar) spectra were acquired in the phase-sensitive mode using the States-time proportional phase incrementation method (25Marion D. Ikura M. Tschudin R. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 85: 393-399Google Scholar). For spectra recorded in H2O, and except for the DQF-COSY spectra (where low power irradiation was used), the water resonance was suppressed by the WATERGATE method (26Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3536) Google Scholar). The z-TOCSY spectra were obtained with a mixing time of 90 ms, and NOESY spectra were obtained with mixing times of 100, 150, and 300 ms. Slowly exchanging amide protons were identified from successive TOCSY and NOESY spectra recorded at 25 °C following the solubilization of PEN4 in D2O from 15 min to 24 h. Data were processed by using the same software packages utilized for PEN3 structural analysis (14Yang Y. Poncet J. Garnier J. Zatylny C. Bachere E. Aumelas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36859-36867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The full sequential assignment was achieved using the general strategy described by Wüthrich (27Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Structure Calculation—The NOESY cross-peaks were measured from the NOESY spectrum acquired at 25 °C with a mixing time of 150 ms and were subsequently divided into five classes, according to their intensities. Very strong, strong, medium, weak, and very weak NOEs were then converted into 1.8 –2.4-, 1.8 –2.8-, 1.8 –3.6-, 1.8–4.4-, and 1.8 –5.0-Å distance constraints, respectively. For equivalent protons or nonstereospecifically assigned protons, pseudoatoms were introduced. The ϕ angle restraints were derived from the 3JNH-CαH coupling constants, and the χ1 angle restraints were derived from the combined analysis of the 3JHα-Hβ,β′ coupling constants and intraresidue NOEs, respectively. To calculate three-dimensional structures, distance and dihedral angle restraints were used as input in the standard distance geometry/simulated annealing refinement and energy minimization protocol using X-PLOR 3.8 (28Rice L.M. Brunger A.T. Proteins. 1994; 19: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In the first stage of the calculation, an initial ensemble of 60 structures was generated from a template structure with randomized ϕ, φ dihedral angles and extended side chains. In preliminary calculations, neither hydrogen bond nor disulfide bond was used as restraint. Analyzing the obtained structures and comparing them with the NMR data permitted identification of more additional NOE restraints, which were introduced into the subsequent calculation. Analysis of the average Cβ–Cβ distances between cysteines in the lowest energy structures permitted unambiguous determination of the arrangement of the three disulfide bonds. After a number of these processes, 511 NOE-derived distance restraints (103 medium range and 53 long range) and 25 dihedral angles (8 ϕ, 14 χ1, and 3 χ3) were used as final input data. Finally, a calculation of 40 conformers including the disulfide bonds was carried out, and the resulting 20 structures with a minimum of restrained violations were submitted to 5000 cycles of restrained Powell energy minimization. Structure Analysis—The visual display and the calculation of r.m.s. deviation were performed with INSIGHT 97 (Molecular Simulation Inc., San Diego, CA). Hydrogen bonds were considered as present if the distance between heavy atoms was less than 3.5 Å and the donor-hydrogen-acceptor angle was greater than 120°. The Ramachandran analysis was performed with PROCHECK (29Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and the limits of the secondary structure elements and the van der Waals surfaces were determined with the STRIDE (30Frishman D. Argos P. Proteins. 1995; 23: 566-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (2067) Google Scholar) and PROMOTIF (31Chan A.W. Hutchinson E.G. Harris D. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1574-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) programs. The chemical shifts and coordinates of the energy-minimized conformers of PEN4 are deposited in the BioMagResBank (BMRB entry 6388) and the Protein Data Bank (PDB entry 1xv3), respectively. Antimicrobial Assays—A variety of microorganisms were used to measure antimicrobial activity of the synthetic PEN4 (see Table II). Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined in triplicate by the liquid growth inhibition assay as described previously (18Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Strub J.M. Van Dorsselaer A. Bachère E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Poor broth nutrient medium (1% bactotryptone, 0.5% NaCl (w/v), pH 7.5) or saline peptone water (1.5% peptone, 1.5% NaCl (w/v), pH 7.2) was used for the standard bacterial strains and the marine bacteria, respectively. An identical liquid growth inhibition assay as that used to measure antibacterial activity was used to measure antifungal activity in half-strength potato dextrose broth (Difco) medium (18Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Strub J.M. Van Dorsselaer A. Bachère E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). After incubation for 48 h at 25 °C in the dark without shaking and in a moist chamber, growth inhibition of the fungus was measured at 600 nm.Table IIAntimicrobial spectrum of activity of the chemically synthesized PEN4 and PRD PEN4 compared with PEN3 and PRD PEN3 expressed as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range (μm) (updated from Ref.15Cuthbertson B.J.

Open table in a new tab Chemical Synthesis—The oxidative folding of PEN4 (full-length sequence shown in Fig. 1) was assessed under a variety of conditions in the presence of 10% Me2SO and monitored by analytical HPLC. Oxidation at pH 7.0 yielded a robust peak at 17.8 min (Fig. 2), indicating a single predominant isomer, and these conditions were used to scale up the reaction for the preparation of PEN4. The same conditions were used to attempt to fold and oxidize the cysteine-rich fragment alone; however, a mixture of disulfide isomers was generated without the appearance of a dominant product over the pH range tested (data not shown). The PEN4 PRD appears to be necessary for the proper folding of the CRD. The pure oxidized full-length PEN4 isoform was characterized by MALDI-TOF MS, revealing an accurate mass (m/z = 5298.80 found, 5298.16 calculated) and a highly pure disulfide isomer. Amino acid analysis and N-terminal peptide sequencing confirmed the predicted sequence of the full-length PEN4 oxidized peptide (15Cuthbertson B.J. Büllesbach E.E. Fievet J. Bachere E. Gross P.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Chemically Determined Disulfide Arrangement—The disulfide bonds for PEN4 were identified by partial reduction of the cysteines followed by cyanylation (21Wu J. Watson J.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The reduction and cyanylation were performed under weakly acidic conditions in order to suppress thiol-disulfide exchange reactions. HPLC of the reaction mixture indicated that ∼90% of the material eluted at the same time as the starting material. Only ∼10% of the peptides appeared slightly more hydrophobic, and these isomers eluted as a second peak. MALDI-TOF MS indicated that this second peak contained PEN4 in which two cysteines were cyanylated (mass increase of 52). We assumed that all three isomers with one disulfide bond partially reduced had been formed but have very similar chromatographic properties. After cleavage with ammonium hydroxide of the peptide bond preceding the cyanylated cysteine, the peptide mixture was fully reduced, diluted, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. The identification of the fragment pairs containing the modified cysteines allowed us to determine the initial disulfide pairing. A selected mass spectrum is displayed in Fig. 3, showing the fragments corresponding to disulfide bonds between Cys23 and Cys37 (labeled A), between Cys26 and Cys44 (B), and between Cys38 and Cys45 (C). The theoretical masses and the mass units for the identified fragments are listed in Table I. These results clearly indicated the existence of only one disulfide arrangement for the synthetic PEN4 and the identical location of the disulfides when compared with the reported disulfide bonds for PEN3 (14Yang Y.

https://openalex.org/W2049056182,"Abstract Escherichia coli ZiPD is the best characterized protein encoded by the elaC gene family and is a model for the 3′-pre-tRNA processing endoribonucleases (tRNase Z). A metal ligand-based sequence alignment of ZiPD with metallo-β-lactamase domain proteins of known crystallographic structure identifies a ZiPD-specific sequence insertion of ∼50 residues, which we will refer to as the ZiPD exosite. Functionally characterized ZiPD homologs from Bacillus subtilis, Methanococcus janaschii, and human share the presence of the ZiPD exosite, which is also present in the amino-terminal, but not in the carboxyl-terminal, domain of ElaC2 proteins. Another class of functionally characterized tRNase Z enzymes from Thermotoga maritima and Arabidopsis thaliana lack characteristic motifs in the exosite but possess a sequence segment with clustered basic amino acid residues. As an experimental attempt to investigate the function of the exosite we constructed a ZiPD variant that lacks this module (ZiPDΔ). ZiPDΔ has almost wild-type-like catalytic properties for hydrolysis of the small, chromogenic substrate bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate. Removal of the ZiPD exosite only affects kcat, which is reduced by less than 40%, whereas both K′ andthe Hill coefficient (measures of the substrate affinity and cooperativity, respectively) remain unchanged. Hence, the exosite is not required for the intrinsic phosphodiesterase activity of ZiPD. Removal of the exosite also does not affect the dimerization properties of ZiPD. In contrast to the wild-type enzyme, ZiPDΔ does not process pre-tRNA, and gel shift assays demonstrate that only the wild-type enzyme, but not ZiPDΔ, binds mature tRNA. These findings show that the exosite is essential for pre-tRNA recognition. In conclusion, we identify a ZiPD exosite that guides physiological substrate recognition in the ZiPD/ElaC protein family."
https://openalex.org/W2091316116,"Processing of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a key role in Alzheimer disease neuropathogenesis. APP is cleaved by β- and α-secretase to produce APP-C99 and APP-C83, which are further cleaved by γ-secretase to produce amyloid β-protein (Aβ) and p3, respectively. APP adaptor proteins with phosphotyrosine-binding domains, including X11α (MINT1, encoded by gene APBA1) and X11β (MINT2, encoded by gene APBA2), can bind to the conserved YENPTY motif in the APP C terminus. Overexpression of X11α and X11β alters APP processing and Aβ production. Here, for the first time, we have described the effects of RNA interference (RNAi) silencing of X11α and X11β expression on APP processing and Aβ production. RNAi silencing of APBA1 in H4 human neuroglioma cells stably transfected to express either full-length APP or APP-C99 increased APP C-terminal fragment levels and lowered Aβ levels in both cell lines by inhibiting γ-secretase cleavage of APP. RNAi silencing of APBA2 also lowered Aβ levels, but apparently not via attenuation of γ-secretase cleavage of APP. The notion of attenuating γ-secretase cleavage of APP via the APP adaptor protein X11α is particularly attractive with regard to therapeutic potential given that side effects of γ-secretase inhibition due to impaired proteolysis of other γ-secretase substrates, e.g. Notch, might be avoided.

This cleavage by β-secretase generates a 99-residue membrane-associated C-terminal fragment (APP-C99). APP-C99 is further cleaved to release 4-kDa Aβ and the β-APP intracellular domain.

In tyrosine kinase receptors, the tyrosine residue of this motif is phosphorylated upon tyrosine kinase activation, and the YENPTY motif functions as a docking site for the phosphotyrosine-binding domain present in several adaptor proteins, including the X11 family. X11α (MINT1) and X11β (MINT2), encoded by genes APBA1 and APBA2, respectively, bind to the YENPTY motif of APP (Refs. 19Borg J-P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell.

Overexpression of X11α and X11β has been shown previously to inhibit APP catabolism. Borg et al. (22Borg J-P. Yang Y. De Taddéo-Borg M. Margolis B. Turner R.S. J. Biol.

Like X11α, X11β also stabilizes cellular APP and diminishes the levels of APPs and Aβ (24McLoughlin D.M. Irving N.G. Brownlees J. Brion J.P. Leroy K. Miller C.C. Eur. J.

X11α and X11β can interact with presenilin-1 via their PDZ domains (26Lau K.F. McLoughlin D.M. Standen C. Miller C.C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that overexpression of X11α can impair APP trafficking and may inhibit Aβ production (27King G.D. Perez R.G. Steinhilb M.L. Gaut J.R. Turner R.S. Neuroscience. 2003; 120: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, King et al. (28King G.D. Cherian K. Turner R.S. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 971-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) suggested that X11α may specifically interfere with γ-secretase (but not β-secretase)-mediated cleavage of APP and Aβ production. To date, the effects of reduced expression of APBA1 and APBA2 or X11α and X11β on APP processing and Aβ production have not been assessed. For this purpose, we established RNA interference (RNAi) for APBA1 and APBA2 in H4 cells overexpressing either full-length APP (APP-FL) or APP-C99 and evaluated the effects of RNAi-mediated silencing of APBA1 and APBA2 on APP processing and Aβ production. Cell Lines—We used H4 naïve human neuroglioma cells and H4 cells stably transfected to express either APP-FL or APP-C99. APP-C99 is the product of β-secretase and therefore contains α- and γ-cleavage (but not β-cleavage) sites. This cell line provides a valid system to assess whether any effects on APP processing are dependent on γ-secretase-mediated APP processing and independent of β-secretase-mediated APP processing. All cell lines were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 9% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Stably transfected H4 cells were additionally supplemented with 200 μg/ml G418. RNAi and DAPT Treatment—Small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes designed against human APBA1, the gene encoding X11α (5′-GGATGCTCAGCTGATTGCA-3′), and APBA2, the gene encoding X11β (5′-GGTGAAGCTCAACATTGTC-3′), were obtained from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). Scrambled siRNA (5′-AAATGTGTGTACGTCTCCTCC-3′) (29Luo W.J. Wang H. Li H. Kim B.S. Shah S. Lee H.J. Thinakaran G. Kim T.W. Yu G. Xu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7850-7854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) was used as the control siRNA. siRNAs were transfected into cells by electroporation (Amaxa Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). We mixed 1 million cells, 100 μl of amaxa electroporation transfection solution, and 10 μl of 20 μm siRNA together, and we used the C-9 program in the amaxa electroporation device for cell transfection. The transfected cells were placed in a 6-well plate containing 1.5 ml of cell culture medium. The cells were harvested 48 h after siRNA treatment. The γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT (250 nm, 18-h treatment) was employed in the experiments as a positive control. Cell Lysis and Protein Quantification—Cell pellets were detergent-extracted on ice using 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 plus protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). The lysates were collected, centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, and quantified for total proteins using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Western Blot Analysis of APP Processing—Western blot analysis was performed as described by Xie et al. (30Xie Z. Moir R. Romano D.M. Tesco G. Kovacs D. Tanzi R. Neurodegenerative Dis. 2004; 1: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, 40 μg of total protein from each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE using 4–20% gradient Tris/glycine gels (Invitrogen) under reducing conditions. Next, the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (BioRad) using a semidry electrotransfer system (Amersham Biosciences). Nonspecific proteins were blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween for 1.5 h. Blots were then incubated with a primary antibody, followed by a secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody, 1:10,000 dilution; Pierce). Blots were washed with 1× Tris-buffered saline/Tween for 30 min between steps. Antibody H-265 (1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was used to recognize X11α (105 kDa), and antibody N-20 (1:100 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was used to detect X11β (135 kDa). Antibody A8717 (1:1000 dilution; Sigma) was used to visualize APP-FL (110 kDa), APP-C83 (12 kDa), and APP-C99 (10 kDa) in Western blot analysis. The intensity of signals was analyzed using the NIH Image Program (Version 1.62). We quantified the Western blots as follows. We used the levels of β-actin to normalize the levels of X11α, X11β, APP-FL, and the APP C-terminal fragment (APP-CTF) (i.e. determining the ratio of the X11α amount to the β-actin amount) to control for loading differences in total protein amounts. We present the changes in the protein levels of X11α, X11β, APP-FL, APP-C99, and APP-C83 in the cells treated with APBA1 or APBA2 siRNA as a percentage of those in the cells treated with control siRNA. Quantitation of Aβ Using Sandwich Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Following treatment with saline, electroporation, and treatment with siRNA (control, APBA1, or APBA2), the conditioned medium was collected, and secreted Aβ was measured by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described by Xie et al. (30Xie Z. Moir R. Romano D.M. Tesco G. Kovacs D. Tanzi R. Neurodegenerative Dis. 2004; 1: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with mouse monoclonal antibody specific to Aβ40 (antibody 266) or Aβ42 (antibody 21F12). Following blocking with bovine serum albumin, the wells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with test samples of the conditioned cell culture medium, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-Aβ antibody HR1 was added. The plates were then developed with tetramethylbenzidine reagent, and absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Aβ levels in test samples were determined by comparison with the signal from unconditioned medium supplemented with known quantities of Aβ40 and Aβ42. Statistics—Analysis of variance with repeated measurements was employed to compare the difference from the control group. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. APBA1 RNAi Increases APP-CTF Levels and Decreases Aβ Levels in APP-FL-overexpressing H4 Cells—We first established conditions under which APBA1 siRNA treatment would successfully reduce X11α protein levels in H4 cells overexpressing APP-FL (H4-APP-FL cells). The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection with either control or APBA1 siRNA and then subjected to Western blot analyses in which antibody H-265 was used to visualize the protein levels of X11α. As shown in Fig. 1A, X11α immunoblotting revealed a visible reduction in the protein levels of X11α following APBA1 siRNA treatment (lanes 4–6) compared with control siRNA treatment (lanes 1–3). There was no significant difference in the amount of β-actin in control siRNA- or APBA1 siRNA-treated cells. We then quantified all Western blots using the NIH Image program. As shown in Fig. 1B, APBA1 siRNA treatment significantly reduced X11α protein levels by 61% (normalized to β-actin) compared with control siRNA treatment. These results indicated that RNAi for APBA1 significantly knocked down the protein levels of X11α. We next assessed the effects of RNAi-mediated silencing of APBA1 on APP processing in H4-APP-FL cells by measuring the protein levels of APP-FL, APP-C99, and APP-C83 following APBA1 siRNA treatment. 48 h after transfection of APBA1 or control siRNA, the cells were harvested and subjected to Western blot analyses in which antibody A8717 was used to detect APP-FL, APP-C99, and APP-C83. The protein levels of APP-C99 and APP-C83 were increased in the cells treated with APBA1 siRNA (Fig. 1A, lanes 4–6) compared with those treated with control siRNA (lanes 1–3). As a positive control, the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT was employed to induce the accumulation of APP-C99 and APP-C83 (lanes 7–9) compared with the control treatment (lanes 1–3). To confirm bands corresponding to APP-C99 and APP-C83, synthetic forms of APP-C99 and APP-C83 were employed as markers. No significant difference in the protein levels of APP-FL was observed in APBA1 siRNA-, control siRNA-, or DAPT-treated cells. We also assessed the protein levels of APP-FL, APP-C99, and APP-C83 in H4 naïve cells and found that they were less than those in H4-APP-FL cells. There was no significant difference in the amount of β-actin in control siRNA-, APBA1 siRNA-, or DAPT-treated H4-APP-FL cells and H4 naïve cells. Quantification of APP-FL, APP-C99, and APP-C83 (normalized to β-actin) revealed that APBA1 siRNA treatment led to a 270% increase in the ratio of APP-C99 to APP-FL (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1C) and a somewhat smaller increase (205%) in the ratio of APP-C83 to APP-FL (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1D) compared with control siRNA treatment. Used as a control, the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT led to 310% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1C) and 250% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1D) increases in the ratios of APP-C99 and APP-C83 to APP-FL, respectively. We next measured Aβ levels in the conditioned medium 48 h after treatment with control siRNA, APBA1 siRNA, or DAPT. Because Aβ42 was too low to be detected in many samples, we present only the changes in Aβ40 production from these experiments. As shown in Fig. 1E, both APBA1 siRNA (black bar) and DAPT (gray bar) treatment decreased Aβ levels to a similar extent compared with control siRNA treatment (white bar): 75 pg/ml (APBA1 siRNA) and 70 pg/ml (DAPT) versus 116 pg/ml (control siRNA). Collectively, these data indicated that RNAi silencing of APBA1 affected APP processing and Aβ production in a manner similar to that of DAPT. APBA2 RNAi Decreases Aβ Levels but Does Not Alter APP Processing in H4-APP-FL Cells—We next investigated whether the other X11 family protein, X11β (encoded by gene APBA2), can similarly affect APP processing and Aβ production in H4-APP-FL cells. For this purpose, we established APBA2 RNAi in H4-APP-FL cells. 48 h after transfection of H4-APP-FL cells with APBA2 or control siRNA, the cells were harvested and subjected to Western blot analyses in which antibody N-20 was used to detect the protein levels of X11β. As shown in Fig. 2A, X11β immunoblotting revealed a visible decrease in the protein levels of X11β in the cells treated with APBA2 siRNA (lanes 4–6) compared with those treated with control siRNA (lanes 1–3). Quantification of the Western blots (normalized to β-actin) revealed that APBA2 siRNA treatment decreased the protein levels of X11β by 46% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B) compared with control siRNA treatment. We then assessed the effects of RNAi-mediated silencing of APBA2 on APP processing in H4-APP-FL cells. 48 h after transfection with either APBA2 or control siRNA, the cells were harvested and subjected to Western blot analyses. As shown in Fig. 2A, immunoblotting with antibody A8717 revealed no significant difference in the protein levels of APP-FL in APBA2 siRNA-treated (lanes 4–6), control siRNA-treated (lanes 1–3), or DAPT-treated (lanes 7–9) cells. In addition, APBA2 siRNA treatment (lanes 4–6) did not alter the protein levels of APP-C99 or APP-C83, whereas DAPT treatment (lanes 7–9), used as a positive control in the experiment, increased the protein levels of both APP-C99 and APP-C83 compared with control siRNA treatment (lanes 1–3). We also assessed the protein levels of APP-FL, APP-C99, and APP-C83 in H4 naïve cells and found that they were less than those in H4-APP-FL cells. Quantification of the protein levels of APP-FL, APP-C99, and APP-C83 in the Western blot revealed that DAPT treatment (gray bars) led to 270% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2C) and 245% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2D) increases in the ratios of APP-C99 and APP-C83 to APP-FL, respectively, compared with control treatment (white bars). However, APBA2 siRNA treatment (Fig. 2C, Fig. 2D, black bar) did not alter the ratios of APP-C99 and APP-C83 to APP-FL compared with control siRNA treatment. We next measured Aβ levels in the conditioned medium 48 h following treatment with control siRNA, APBA2 siRNA, or DAPT. As shown in Fig. 2E, both APBA2 siRNA (black bar) and DAPT (gray bar) treatment significantly decreased Aβ production compared with control siRNA treatment (white bar): 68 pg/ml (APBA2 siRNA) and 48 pg/ml (DAPT) versus 109 pg/ml (control siRNA) (p < 0.05). Taken together, these findings indicated that, in contrast to APBA1 siRNA treatment, APBA2 siRNA treatment did not alter APP processing. However, APBA2 siRNA treatment also decreased Aβ production in H4-APP-FL cells. As discussed above, β-secretase cleaves APP-FL to produce APP-C99, and then γ-secretase cleaves APP-C99 to produce Aβ. Therefore, the changes in APP processing and Aβ production following treatment with APBA1 and APBA2 siRNAs could conceivably be due to alterations in either β-secretase and/or γ-secretase activity. In the following experiments, we set out to determine whether the changes in APP processing and Aβ production following treatment with APBA1 or APBA2 siRNA were independent of β-secretase-mediated APP processing and dependent on γ-secretase-mediated APP processing, employing H4 cells overexpressing APP-C99 (H4-APP-C99 cells). APBA1 RNAi Increases APP-CTF Levels and Decreases Aβ Levels in H4-APP-C99 Cells—To eliminate increased β-secretase cleavage of APP-FL as a possible explanation for increased APP-C99, we employed H4-APP-C99 cells. APP-C99 is the product of β-secretase and harbors α- and γ-cleavage (but not β-cleavage) sites. 48 h after transfection of H4-APP-C99 cells with APBA1 or control siRNA, the cells were harvested and subjected to Western blot analyses in which antibody H-265 was used to detect X11α. As shown in Fig. 3A, X11α immunoblotting revealed a visible reduction in the protein levels of X11α (encoded by gene APBA1) in the cells treated with APBA1 siRNA (lanes 5–7) compared with those treated with control siRNA (lanes 2–4). There was no significant difference in the amount of β-actin in control siRNA- or APBA1 siRNA-treated cells. Quantification of X11α in the Western blot (normalized to β-actin) showed that APBA1 siRNA treatment decreased the protein levels of X11α by 50% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3B). We next assessed the effects of RNAi-mediated silencing of APBA1 on processing of APP-C99. 48 h after transfection with APBA1 or control siRNA, the cells were harvested and subjected to Western blot analyses with antibody A8717. APBA1 siRNA treatment (Fig. 3A, lanes 5–7) did not alter the protein levels of APP-FL compared with control siRNA treatment (lanes 2–4). APP-CTF immunoblotting revealed visible increases in the protein levels of both APP-C99 and APP-C83 in the H4-APP-C99 cells treated with APBA1 siRNA (lanes 5–7) compared with those treated with control siRNA (lanes 2–4). We also assessed the protein levels of APP-C99 and APP-C83 in H4 naïve cells and found that they were less than those in H4-APP-C99 cells. There was no significant difference in the amount of β-actin in control siRNA- or APBA1 siRNA-treated H4-APP-C99 cells and H4 naïve cells. Quantification of APP-FL, APP-C99, and APP-C83 revealed that APBA1 siRNA treatment led to a 224% increase in the ratio of APP-C99 to APP-FL (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3C) and a 273% increase in the ratio of APP-C83 to APP-FL (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3D) compared with control siRNA treatment. We then measured Aβ levels in the conditioned medium from H4-APP-C99 cells 48 h after treatment with either control or APBA1 siRNA. As shown in Fig. 3E, APBA1 siRNA decreased Aβ production compared with control siRNA treatment: 110 pg/ml (APBA1 siRNA) versus 164 pg/ml (control siRNA) (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that APBA1 RNAi inhibits γ-secretase (but not β-secretase)-mediated cleavage of APP. APBA2 RNAi Does Not Alter APP Processing or Aβ Levels in H4-APP-C99 Cells—Finally, we assessed the effects of APBA2 RNAi on APP processing and Aβ production in H4-APP-C99 cells. 48 h after transfection with APBA2 or control siRNA, the cells were harvested and subjected to Western blot analyses in which antibody N-20 was used to detect the protein levels of X11β. X11β immunoblotting revealed a visible reduction in the protein levels of X11β (encoded by gene APBA2) in the cells treated with APBA2 siRNA (Fig. 4A, lanes 6–8) compared with those treated with control siRNA (lanes 3–5). There was no significant difference in the amount of β-actin in control siRNA- or APBA2 siRNA-treated cells. Quantification of X11β (normalized to β-actin) revealed that APBA2 siRNA treatment decreased the protein levels of X11β by 86% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4B) compared with control siRNA treatment. Immunoblotting with anti-APP antibody A8717 revealed no detectable difference in the protein levels of APP-FL, APP-C99, and APP-C83 in the cells treated with APBA2 siRNA (Fig. 4A, lanes 6–8) compared with those treated with control siRNA (lanes 3–5). We also assessed the protein levels of APP-C99 and APP-C83 in H4 naïve cells and found that they were less than those in H4-APP-C99 cells. There was no significant difference in the amount of β-actin in control siRNA- or APBA2 siRNA-treated H4-APP-C99 cells and H4 naïve cells. Quantification of APP-FL, APP-C99, and APP-C83 revealed that APBA2 siRNA treatment did not significantly alter the ratios of APP-C99 (Fig. 4C) and APP-C83 (Fig. 4D) to APP-FL. We next measured Aβ levels in the conditioned medium from H4-APP-C99 cells 48 h after treatment with control or APBA2 siRNA. As shown in Fig. 4E, APBA2 siRNA treatment did not significantly alter Aβ production compared with control siRNA treatment: 173 pg/ml (control siRNA) versus 167 pg/ml (APBA2 siRNA). Collectively, these results suggest that, in contrast to APBA1 RNAi, APBA2 RNAi does not alter APP processing or Aβ production in H4-APP-C99 cells. Control siRNA or Electroporation Does Not Affect APP Processing or Aβ Levels in H4-APP-FL and H4-APP-C99 Cells—In a control experiment, we also assessed the effects of control siRNA or electroporation on APP processing and Aβ levels in H4-APP-FL and H4-APP-C99 cells. We found that control siRNA or electroporation did not affect APP processing or alter Aβ levels compared with saline treatment in H4-APP-FL and H4-APP-C99 cells (data not shown). These results confirmed that the effects of APBA1 or APBA2 RNAi on APP processing and Aβ levels in our experiments were not due to electroporation or control siRNA (scrambled siRNA), but to the reduction in the protein levels of X11α and X11β. Aβ, the key component in senile plaques, is derived from APP via cleavage by two proteases, β- and γ-secretase (4Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S.

The latter reflects possible oxidative stress to biological macromolecules, yielding supporting data to the pathological role of these soluble Aβ fragments.

This kinetic profile is consistent with metal-centered redox chemistry for the action of CuAβ. A mechanism is proposed by the use of the catalytic cycle of dinuclear catechol oxidase as a working model. Trihydroxylbenzene is also oxidized by CuAβ aerobically without H2O2, affording rate constants of 6.50 × 10–3 s–1 and 3.25 m–1s–1. This activity is also consistent with catechol oxidase action in the absence of H2O2, wherein the substrate binds and reduces the Cu2+ center first, followed by O2 binding to afford the μ-η2:η2-peroxo intermediate, which oxidizes a second substrate to complete the catalytic cycle.

Because high cytoplasmic concentrations of free metal ions are toxic and potentially lethal, intricate physiological pathways have evolved to transport and distribute metal ions to their targets, which include enzymes and proteins (5Culotta V.C.

With aging, physiological processes responsible for accurate delivery of metal ions break down and “leakage” of free metal ions can cause toxic effects to cells (6Roche E. Romero-Alvira D. Med. Hypotheses. 1993; 40: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 7Shinobu L.A. Beal M.F. Conner J.R. Metals in Oxidative Damage in Neurological Disorders. Plenum, New York1997Google Scholar). Divalent ions of redox-active transition metals have often been associated with oxidative stress and closely involved in the chemistry of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including hydrogen peroxide as well as superoxide and hydroxyl radicals (8Bush A. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Because increase in intracellular concentrations of metal ions is closely related to the effects of aging, oxidative stress, and AD, there is considerable interest in investigating the connection between malfunction of regulatory processes such as metal transport and the presence of ROS with the pathology of AD. The chemistry of redox-active metal complexes of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) has been an area of intense focus in the study of AD. The aggregation of Aβ within the neocortex is closely related to the pathology of AD and has been shown to be induced by metal binding (9Bush A. Pettingell W.H. Multhaup G. Paradis M. Vonsattel J. Gusella J.F. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Tanzi R.E. Science. 1994; 265: 1464-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar, 10Miura T. Suzuki K. Kohata N. Takeuchi H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7024-7031Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The Aβ peptides are generated by the cleavage of the ubiquitous amyloid precursor protein by α, β, and γ secretases (11Ling Y. Morgan K. Kalsheker N. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1505-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Aβ in the form of insoluble plaques contains up to millimolar amounts of Zn2+, Cu2+, and Fe3+ in the neocortical region of the brain (8Bush A. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar); however, the cause/effect connection of the metallo-Aβ plaques with AD is still under debate (12Kontush A. Berndt C. Weber W. Akopian V. Arlt S. Schippling S. Beisiegel U. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The metal coordination environment of the 1–40 and 1–42 peptides has been previously studied and their pH-dependent aggregation reported (10Miura T. Suzuki K. Kohata N. Takeuchi H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7024-7031Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 13Curtain C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R Beyreuther S.K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Bush A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20466-20473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The results showed that the metal binding seemed to be non-stoichiometric with ∼3.5 metal ions per pair of aggregated peptides and a cooperative binding pattern as the amount of aggregates increases (8Bush A. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Because Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–40 have been shown to bind Zn2+, Fe3+, and Cu2+ with extremely low apparent dissociation constants by means of quantitative determination of the metal-complex precipitates (8Bush A. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar), understanding of the metal-binding domain and its structure may shed light on the chemistry related to the neuropathology of AD. Although the coagulation of the peptide plaques leaves little doubt that interaction with cytoplasmic molecules is unlikely, smaller fragments of the amyloid peptide are soluble and Aβ fibrils extend across membranes, exposing them to the cytoplasm. Recently, insulin-degrading enzyme has been shown to digest the longer Aβ peptides (40–42 amino acids) into smaller soluble fragments (14Evin G. Weidemann A. Peptides. 2002; 23: 1285-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Moreover, the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by α- and β-secretases produces the Aβ1–16 fragment of amyloid precursor protein (15Evin G. Zhu A. Holsinger D. Masters C.L. Li Q. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 74: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These soluble fragments and intra-membrane spanning fibrils still possess possible metal binding sites such as histidines, glutamate, aspartate, and tyrosine within the 1–20 fragment of Aβ in the sequence 1DAEFRHDSGYEVHHNKLVFF20. Redox chemistry of Aβ has been previously reported, wherein Met35 was suggested as a “built-in” reducing agent required for the redox cycling hypothesis (16Schőneich C. Pogocki D. Hug G.L. Bobrowski K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 13700-13713Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The lack of sufficient data on the redox chemistry of and the oxidative stress caused by metallo-Aβ and the discrepancies in previous studies such as the presence or absence of free-radicals and the nature of the metal-Aβ interaction seem often to be the shortcoming in Aβ research. Understanding of the chemical processes associated with metallo-Aβ may provide insight into the upstream and/or downstream regulatory processes that lead to AD. Herein, we describe the oxidation chemistry of CuAβ in the presence and absence of H2O2, showing conclusive metal-centered pre-equilibrium kinetics toward the oxidation of a simple substrate and the oxidative cleavage of double-stranded plasmid DNA. The 1–20 and 1–16 fragments of Aβ were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or synthesized at the Peptide Center of the University of South Florida. The identities of the peptides have been confirmed with a Bruker matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The substrate 1,2,3-trihydroxylbenzene (THB) and all buffers were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich; 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone hydrochloride monohydrate from Acros (Fairlawn, NJ); the plasmid pQE30Xa was from Qiagen (Valencia, CA); EDTA, Me2SO, mannose, H2O2, Cu(NO3)2, ZnCl2, and NiSO4 were from Fisher (Swanee, GA); and CoCl2 was from Mallinckrodt (Paris, KY). All plastic ware was demetallized with EDTA and extensively rinsed with 18-MΩ water to remove the chelator. The water used for the studies of DNA cleavage was autoclaved to remove ubiquitous nucleases. DNA Cleavage Assay—The metal derivatives of Aβ were prepared by dissolving the peptide in 18-MΩ water and separated into aliquots followed by addition of corresponding metal ions at 1:1 stoichiometric ratio, which was further diluted into aliquots of working concentrations. The derivatives were freshly prepared in all experiments. A typical reaction contained 150 ng of plasmid DNA, 4.0%, 2.0%, or 0.2% H2O2, and 5.0 μm of metallo-Aβ derivatives in 100 mm HEPES at pH 7.00 in a volume of 15.0 μl. A time-course experiment was performed, and results were analyzed in a 1.0% agarose gel stained with ethydium bromide and then photographed on a transilluminator. Catechol Oxidase (THB Oxidation) Assay—Several concentrations of THB ranging from 0.10 to 5.0 mm were incubated with 7.5 μm of CuAβ and 1.60, 3.20, 16.2, 32.3, or 70.0 mm H2O2 and buffered with 100 mm HEPES at pH 7.00 in a final volume of 1.0 ml. The formation of product was monitored at 420 nm (ϵ = 4,583 m–1 cm–1) on a Varian CARY50 Bio-UV-Vis spectrophotometer for 5 min, and the rates were determined by the change in absorbance over time. The background oxidation of THB was conducted in the same manner without CuAβ in the assay solution. Rates were fitted to appropriate rate laws and rate constants determined by the use of SigmaPlot 8.0. The dependence of H2O2 on THB oxidation by CuAβ was determined by measuring the oxidation rate at several different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of 6.0 mm THB. The initial rates were determined and then fitted as a function of [H2O2] to an appropriate rate law to reveal the rate constants. The catechol oxidase assay was also performed as previously reported with minor changes to fit current studies (17Srivatsan S.G. Nigam P. Rao M.S. Verma S. Applied Catal. A. 2001; 209: 327-334Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The same molar concentrations of THB and 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone (which serves as an ortho-quinone indicator) were mixed in 100 mm HEPES at pH 7.00 in the presence of 3.5 μm CuAβ. The red adduct of the ortho-quinone product was monitored at 500 nm (ϵ = 32,500 m–1 cm–1), and rates were calculated. The auto-oxidation rate of THB was determined under the same conditions in the absence of CuAβ. Metal Titration—Apo-Aβ was dissolved in 100 mm HEPES at pH 7.00 to a final concentration of 1.0 mm. Cu2+ binding was monitored by titrating the metal into the apo-Aβ solution, and the electronic spectra were collected after each addition of the metal. Cu2+ binding was also determined through the oxidative activity of CuAβ complex toward THB. In this case, Cu2+ was titrated into a fixed amount of the peptide in 100 mm HEPES at pH 7.00 in the presence of 10.0 mm of THB and 70.0 mm H2O2. The oxidation rates were determined as a function of [Cu2+], then fitted to a simple equilibrium of metal:peptide = 1:1 or a cooperative binding pattern using the Hill equation. NMR Spectroscopy—All the NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker DPX250 spectrometer at 1H resonance of 250 MHz. The metal binding was monitored through the changes in the NMR spectra. The peptides Aβ1–16 and Aβ1–20 and the paramagnetic shift reagent Co2+ were prepared in d6-Me2SO. The metal ion was gradually titrated into the peptide, and the paramagnetically shifted 1H NMR signals were detected. A typical spectrum of a ∼2 mm sample showing the paramagnetically shifted 1H NMR signals consists of ∼80,000 transients from accumulation of several spectra of 10,000–20,000 transients with a recycle time of ∼50 ms and a spectral window of ∼250 ppm. Solvent-exchangeable signals were determined by adding a drop (∼25 μl) of D2O into the sample, which disappear after the addition. Molecular Mechanics—The primary sequence of Aβ1–16 peptide was entered into BioCAChe 6.0 (Fujitsu, Beaverton, Oregon), and the energy of its structure under solvation using a simulated water droplet was minimized with the MM3 molecular mechanics method. Histidine side chains were considered the ligands in the calculations on the basis of the NMR data. Oxidative Double-stranded DNA Cleavage—Although the bulk of the amyloid plaques in AD brain is membrane-bound, proteolytic processing of amyloid has been shown to yield soluble fragments (13Curtain C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R Beyreuther S.K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Bush A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20466-20473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that the neuropathology of AD may directly affect DNA, eventually leading to apoptosis (18Jang J.H. Surh Y.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 973: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As metal ions are involved in the formation of amyloid plaques, the oxidative activity of metallo-Aβ derivatives against plasmid DNA was probed in vitro with gel electrophoresis. The oxidative activities of the Zn2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+ complexes of Aβ1–20 (ZnAβ1–20, NiAβ1–20, and CuAβ1–20) toward the cleavage of plasmid DNA were determined by incubating several different concentrations of the complexes with plasmid DNA in the presence of 4.0% H2O2 at room temperature for 30 min (Fig. 1). Here, ZnAβ1–20 serves as the control, because Zn2+ is oxidative inactive. The plasmid in the presence of metallo-Aβ1–20 at lower concentrations shows a middle band that is not present in the reference (lane R, Fig. 1). Comparing the middle band with the DNA markers gives an approximate size of 3.5 kbp, consistent with the size of linearized plasmid from the manufacturer. The activities of the derivatives follow the trend CuAβ1–20 > NiAβ1–20 > ZnAβ1–20, demonstrating the involvement of metal in the oxidative cleavage of double-stranded (ds) DNA. One interesting result is shown in the H2O2 plus DNA and the H2O2 plus DNA plus Aβ1–20 control experiments. An amount of 4.0% H2O2 shows a significant damage toward plasmid dsDNA (lanes 1, Fig. 1), whereas Aβ1–20 decreased the H2O2 damage of plasmid dsDNA and perhaps acted as a scavenger of ROS species (lane 2, Fig. 1). The role of Aβ as an antioxidant has been previously reported (19Walter M.F. Mason P.E. Mason R.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), wherein the presence of Met35 was proposed to prevent lipid peroxidation, whereas the M35L mutant showed reduced antioxidant activity. In a similar study, Aβ1–40 was found to prevent the oxidation of the lipoproteins from cerebral spinal fluid and plasma (12Kontush A. Berndt C. Weber W. Akopian V. Arlt S. Schippling S. Beisiegel U. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Moreover, Aβ1–42 was shown to exhibit an antioxidant activity more effective than ascorbic acid in cerebral spinal fluid (20Lonrot K. Metsa K.T. Molnar G. Ahonen J.P. Latvala M. Peltola J. Pietila T. Alho H. Free Rad. Med. Biol. 1996; 21: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The antioxidant activity of Aβ was also demonstrated in the decrease of cytoplasmic amounts of 8-hydroxyguanosine, a major product of nucleic acid oxidation present in elevated amounts in the brains of AD patients (21Nunomura A. Perry G. Zhang J. Montine T. Takeda A. Chiba S. Smith M.A. J. Anti-Aging Med. 1999; 2: 227-230Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These observations implied that the production of Aβ could be related to prevention of oxidative stress. We have demonstrated here that even shorter fragments of Aβ without a Met can serve as a protective agent against oxidative damage of DNA, corroborating with some previous reports (12Kontush A. Berndt C. Weber W. Akopian V. Arlt S. Schippling S. Beisiegel U. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 20Lonrot K. Metsa K.T. Molnar G. Ahonen J.P. Latvala M. Peltola J. Pietila T. Alho H. Free Rad. Med. Biol. 1996; 21: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 21Nunomura A. Perry G. Zhang J. Montine T. Takeda A. Chiba S. Smith M.A. J. Anti-Aging Med. 1999; 2: 227-230Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and supporting the hypothesis that apo-Aβ might be an effect of the oxidative stress in AD brains and might serve a specific purpose to protect from any damage by ROS. This antioxidant activity is also observed in all concentrations of ZnAβ1–20 (lanes 3–6, Fig. 1), consistent with the lack of redox chemistry of Zn2+ and a protection role against dsDNA cleavage as in the case of apo-Aβ1–20. Although Ni2+ is redox active and some of its complexes have been shown to exhibit oxidative damage toward DNA (22Burrows C.J. Lepentsiotis V. Domagala J. Grgic I. van Eldik R. Muller J.G. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 38: 3500-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), NiAβ1–20 does not show such “chemical nuclease” activity, probably attributed to its low redox potential. Conversely, like apo-Aβ and ZnAβ1–20 discussed above, NiAβ1–20 shows a concentration-dependent protection against oxidative damage of dsDNA by H2O2, with better protection at higher concentrations while no significant protection at [NiAβ1–20] < 80 μm (lanes 7–12, Fig. 1). NiAβ has not been shown to be associated with AD pathology; however, it may serve as a structural and mechanistic probe in future studies of metallo-Aβ or similar systems. The activity of 5.0 μm CuAβ1–20 is exceedingly higher than that of ZnAβ1–20 at all concentrations tested in the presence of 4.0% H2O2 (lanes 3–6, Fig. 1), which effectively oxidizes the entire dsDNA plasmid sample into fragments that are too small to be resolved with the agarose gel electrophoresis (empty lanes not shown). Cu2+ ion has been demonstrated in the literature to be active toward DNA cleavage in the presence of H2O2 (23Aruoma O.I. Halliwell B. Gajewski E. Dizdaroglu M. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 601-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 24Sagripanti J. Kraemer K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1729-1734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Chiu S-m. Xue L.-y.

The use of Cu2+ (5.0 μm) in the presence of 3.6% H2O2 as control shows a much slower cleavage rate as the plasmid is not completely digested after 2 h of incubation (lanes 1′–6′). To monitor the catalytic activity of CuAβ1–20 toward plasmid dsDNA, the concentration of H2O2 was reduced to 2.0% and a time course experiment conducted (Fig. 2). CuAβ1–20 completely oxidizes plasmid DNA within 5.0 min in the presence of 2.0% H2O2, leaving only a faint streak in the gel (lane 7, Fig. 2). The ability of apo-Aβ1–20 to act as a protector against oxidation of dsDNA in the presence of H2O2 is once again demonstrated here. Further reducing the concentration of H2O2 to 0.2% allows a clearer monitoring of plasmid cleavage patterns (Fig. 3). Within 10 min of incubation, 5.0 μm of CuAβ1–20 shows double-stranded DNA cleavage as evident in the appearance of a middle band ∼3.5 kbp (lane 6, Fig. 3). Within 20–30 min, complete conversion of the supercoiled plasmid into linear and nick-circular conformations is observed, evident in the changes in the intensity of the different forms of the plasmid compared with the reference (lanes 3 and 4, respectively, Fig. 3). After 30 min, plasmid is cleaved into small pieces leaving a streak of oligonucleotide products (lanes 1–3). The different and quite opposite activities between apo-Aβ1–20 and CuAβ1–20 toward dsDNA damage may hint a physiological role of small fragments of apo-Aβ.Fig. 3Time course reactivity assay toward the cleavage of 150 ng of dsDNA.R is the reference DNA; lanes 1–6, DNA plus 5.0 μm CuAβ1–20 plus 0.2% H2O2 (60, 40, 30, 20, 15, and 10 min, respectively); lanes 7–10, DNA plus 5.0 μm CuAβ1–20 (peroxide free 60, 40, 20, and 10 min, respectively); and lanes 11–15, DNA plus 0.2% H2O2 (40, 30, 20, 15, and 10 min, respectively). The standard DNA ladder starts with 1 kbp from the bottom with 1-kbp increments upward. The cleavage of plasmid by 5.0 μm Cu2+ ions and 3.6% H2O2 is shown in Fig. 1, which exhibits a much lower activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the role of the oxidizing agent in these reactions, the same concentration of CuAβ1–20 was incubated with the plasmid in the absence of H2O2 up to 60 min, which shows negligible cleavage (lane 7, Fig. 3). The low activity of CuAβ1–20 without H2O2 indicates a metal-centered activation of peroxide, such as the formation of a Cu2-peroxo center found in many copper complexes (28Kitajima N. Koda T. Iwata Y. Morooka Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 8833-8839Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 29Lewis E.A. Tolman W.B. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 1047-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar, 30Tolman W.B. Acc. Chem. Res. 1997; 30: 227-237Crossref Scopus (446) Google Scholar), which subsequently results in oxidative damage to dsDNA. To distinguish the reaction pathways of oxidative DNA cleavage by H2O2 in the presence and absence of CuAβ1–20, a time-course experiment was established (lanes 11–15, Fig. 3). The reaction patterns of dsDNA cleavage in these two cases are clearly different. In the absence of Aβ1–20, dsDNA is cleaved into small fragments without formation of a linear intermediate as evident by the faint band at 2.0 kbp. The nature of the band is not clear at this stage and is not associated with Aβ. The dsDNA cleavage by CuAβ1–20 in the presence of H2O2 is conformation-dependent, most active toward supercoiled dsDNA as evident by the accumulation of nicked-circular and linear forms with time in the reaction, likely due to the structural constraints of the supercoiled form. The accumulation of the linearized form (middle bands) is indicative of double-stranded DNA cleavage, rather than a random single-stranded cleavage, which is a key trigger that can result in cell apoptosis (31Stanulla M. Wang J. Chervinsky D.S. Thandla S. Aplan P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4070-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The linearization of the plasmid via cleavage of dsDNA is also characteristic of the cleavage pattern by DNA-recognizing agents such as Cu-bleomycin (32Ehrenfeld G.M. Rodriguez L.O. Hecht S.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). False regulation of metal homeostasis and ROS physiology is closely related to aging and oxidative stress (7Shinobu L.A. Beal M.F. Conner J.R. Metals in Oxidative Damage in Neurological Disorders. Plenum, New York1997Google Scholar), wherein apo-Aβ1–20 seems to serve as a scavenger of metal ions due to its large affinity constant with metal ions and a protective agent against oxidative damage of biological macromolecules by H2O2 based on the observations in this and other studies (33Zou K. Gong. J.S. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4833-4841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kontush A. Free Radic. Med. Biol. 2001; 31: 1120-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, the presence of H2O2 can result in severe damage toward dsDNA and presumably other redox-sensitive biomolecules as well by metallo-Aβ when the metal ions are redox active as demonstrated herein. The mechanism of oxidative “chemical nucleases” has been thoroughly studied and reviewed (35Sigman D.S. Mazumder A. Perrin D. Chem. Rev. 1993; 93: 2295-2316Crossref Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). According to the studies of some simple chemical nucleases such as Cu-1,10-phenanthroline, a reduced state of the metal center (by a reducing agent) is required for catalysis in the presence of O2. In our experiments, however, the absence of a reducing agent to convert Cu2+ to Cu+ and the use of H2O2 as the oxidation agent suggest a different oxidative pathway. Moreover, the free radical scavenger (36Rao P.S. Luber J.M. Milinowicz J. Lalezari P. Mueller H.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) Me2SO did not inhibit the reaction, suggesting the absence of free radicals to induce the oxidative damage. On the basis of the results shown here, we propose a peroxo-bridged dinuclear Cu2+ active center for CuAβ1–20 as observed in a number of dinuclear chemical model systems (28Kitajima N. Koda T. Iwata Y. Morooka Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 8833-8839Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and in catechol oxidase, tyrosinase, and hemocyanin (37Bertini I. Lippard S.J. Gray H.B. Valentine J.S. Bioinorganic Chemistry. University Science Books, Sausalito, CA1994Google Scholar, 38Gerdemann C. Eicken C. Krebs B. Acc. Chem. Res. 2002; 35: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The nature of this transient peroxo-bridging species and its attack on the substrates, although thoroughly studied, still has key mechanistic questions to be answered, such as the true structure of reaction intermediates, the role of substrate in the reaction mechanism, rate determining steps in catalysis, and specificity of metal cofactor for the function of enzymes like catechol oxidase, tyrosinase, peptidylglycine monooxygenase, methane monooxygenase, fatty acid desaturase, and ribonucleotide reductase (39Blackburn N.J. Rhames F.C. Ralle M. Jaron S. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 341-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 40Que Jr, L. Tolman W.B. Angew. Chem. 2002; 41: 1114-1137Crossref Google Scholar, 41Seo S.Y. Sharma V.K. Sharma N. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2003; 51: 2837-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that substrate accessibility in the active site after O2 binding plays a key role in the action of these proteins (39Blackburn N.J. Rhames F.C. Ralle M. Jaron S. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 341-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 42Chen P. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 15: 4991-5000Crossref Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Consequently, a reversible O2 binding has been demonstrated in hemocyanin because of the lack of substrate accessibility, wherein bulky substrates such as aromatic systems and the ribose moiety of DNA may not easily gain access to the O2-binding active center of the proteins. However, studies of catechol oxidase and tyrosinase have shown the production of hydroxylated phenols and ortho-quinones, reflecting that substrates bind"
https://openalex.org/W1981361706,"TcTex-1, one of three dynein light chains of the dynein motor complex, has been implicated in targeting and binding cargoes to cytoplasmic dynein for retrograde or apical transport. Interactions between TcTex-1 and a diverse set of proteins such as the dynein intermediate chain, Fyn, DOC2, FIP1, the poliovirus receptor, CD155, and the rhodopsin cytoplasmic tail have been reported; yet, despite the broad range of targets, a consensus binding sequence remains uncertain. Consequently, we have solved the crystal structure of the full-length Drosophila homolog of TcTex-1 to 1.7 A resolution using MAD phasing to gain insight into its function and target specificity. The structure is homodimeric with a domain swapping of β-strand 2 and has a fold similar to the dynein light chain, LC8. Based on structural alignment, the TcTex-1 and LC8 sequences show no identity, although the root mean square deviation between secondary structural elements is less than 1.6 A. Moreover, the N terminus, which is equivalent to β-strand 1 in LC8, is splayed out and binds to a crystallographic dimer as an anti-parallel β-strand at the same position as the neuronal nitric-oxide synthase peptide in the LC8 complex. Similarity to LC8 and comparison to the LC8-neuronal nitricoxide synthase complex suggest that TcTex-1 binds its targets in a similar manner as LC8 and provides insight to the lack of strict sequence identity among the targets for TcTex-1."
https://openalex.org/W1988499895,"Gonadotropins are the major regulators of ovarian function and may be involved in the etiology of ovarian cancer. In this study, we report a new mechanism whereby gonadotropins regulate the survival of human ovarian surface epithelium (OSE), the tissue of origin of epithelial ovarian carcinomas. Our results indicate that disruption of N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is an important molecular event in the apoptosis of human OSE. Treatment with surge serum concentrations of gonadotropins reduced the amount of N-cadherin with a concomitant induction of apoptosis, and this effect was mediated by a cAMP/protein kinase A pathway but not the ERK1/2 and protein kinase C cascades. We further demonstrated that activation of the gonadotropins/cAMP signaling pathway in human OSE led to a rapid down-regulation of N-cadherin protein level followed by a reduction at the level of N-cadherin mRNA, indicating that expression of N-cadherin was regulated by post-translational and transcriptional mechanisms. The former mechanism was mediated by increased turnover of N-cadherin protein and could be reversed by inhibition of proteasomal or matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-2) activity. On the other hand, at the transcriptional level, the addition of actinomycin D abolished the cAMP-mediated decrease in N-cadherin mRNA but did not change its stability. Inhibition of protein kinase A or expressing a dominant negative mutant of cAMP-response element-binding protein blocked this decrease of N-cadherin mRNA. Together, the combined operation of post-translational and transcriptional mechanisms suggests that regulation of N-cadherin is a crucial event and emphasizes the important role that N-cadherin has in controlling the survival capability of human OSE.

The surface of the human ovary is covered with a single layer of flat-to-cuboidal mesothelial cells, the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE). 1The abbreviations used are: OSE, ovarian surface epithelium; FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone; LH/hCG, luteinizing hormone/human chorionic gonadotropin; Bt2cAMP, dibutyryl cAMP; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ConA, concanavalin A; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PI, propidium iodide; DAPI, diamidino-2-phenylindole; TUNEL, terminal dUTP nick-end labeling; RT, reverse transcription; ACI, adenylyl cyclase inhibitor. During each reproductive cycle, the OSE takes part in the cyclical ovulatory ruptures and repair. OSE on the preovulatory follicle undergoes apoptosis at the time of ovulation and then proliferates rapidly to repair the ruptured follicle and reconstitutes an intact mesothelium (1Murdoch W.J. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1995; 105: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, factors regulating cell death and growth in human OSE are poorly understood. Because OSE is the source of epithelial ovarian carcinomas, which is the leading cause of death among all the human gynecological neoplasms, understanding the mechanisms that regulate OSE cell survival, apoptosis, and cell growth is of great clinical importance because an aberrant signaling of any of these pathways is likely to be involved in epithelial ovarian cancer. The cadherins are a family of cell surface glycoproteins that function in promoting calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion and play crucial roles in the maintenance of structure, differentiation, and function of reproductive tissues (reviewed in Ref. 2Rowlands T.M. Symonds J.M. Farookhi R. Blaschuk O.W. Rev. Reprod. 2000; 5: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In general, cadherins are expressed in a cell-specific manner within specific compartments of the ovary, and their expression shows changes during different differentiation or stages related to functions of ovarian cells (3Sundfeldt K. Piontkewitz Y. Billig H. Hedin L. J. Reprod. Fertil. 2000; 118: 375-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Machell N.H. Farookhi R. Reproduction. 2003; 125: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Numerous types of cadherins were identified in ovarian tissues of different mammalian species. N-cadherin, the most abundant member of the classical cadherin family, has been observed on the surface of granulosa cells and OSE. In contrast to cultured rat OSE, which expresses both N- and E-cadherin together, human OSE only expresses N-cadherin (5Hoffman A.G. Burghardt R.C. Tilley R. Auersperg N. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 54: 828-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6Wong A.S. Maines-Bandiera S.L. Rosen B. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Leung P.C. Roskelley C.D. Auersperg N. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Such differences in cadherin expression may be related to the structural and physiological differences among OSE from different species. N-cadherin has been shown to protect rat OSE from apoptosis (7Trolice M.P. Pappalardo A. Peluso J.J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 8Peluso J.J. Biol. Signals Recept. 2000; 9: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but whether N-cadherin has a similar function in human OSE cells is not known. Numerous papers have dealt with the regulation of E-cadherin expression in OSE and ovarian epithelial carcinogenesis and specifically with the acquisition of this marker as an early event in transformation (6Wong A.S. Maines-Bandiera S.L. Rosen B. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Leung P.C. Roskelley C.D. Auersperg N. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 9Maines-Bandiera S.L.

Several lines of evidence prompted us to investigate the possibility that one of the mechanisms regulating N-cadherin expression might involve cAMP. First, pituitary gonadotropins are the major regulators of ovarian function, and the responses to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH)/human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) are mediated mainly by cAMP signaling. Normal OSE and ovarian carcinomas have specific receptors for gonadotropins, indicating a role of these factors in normal OSE physiology and in the transformation and progression of ovarian cancers (12Cheng P.C.

A number of epidemiological studies have demonstrated increased occurrence of ovarian cancer with exposure to high levels of gonadotropins during menopause or infertility therapy, whereas a reduced risk of ovarian cancer is associated with multiple pregnancy, breast feeding, and oral contraceptive use, which results in reduced exposure to gonadotropins (16Shushan A.

Second, studies of granulosa cells have shown that cAMP plays a critical role in promoting apoptosis (19Keren-Tal I. Suh B.S. Dantes A. Lindner S. Oren M. Amsterdam A. Exp.

Additionally, cAMP has the capability to enhance the expression of E-cadherin, an epithelial cadherin (23Revillion F. Vandewalle B. Hornez L. Lefebvre J. Anticancer Res. 1993; 13: 1625-1629PubMed Google Scholar, 24Brabant G. Hoang-Vu C. Behrends J. Cetin Y. Potter E. Dumont J.E. Maenhaut C. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3113-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, we first intended to verify the anti-apoptotic effect of N-cadherin in human OSE cells and, more significantly, to address potential molecular mechanisms involved in regulation of the gene. Our experiments revealed that expression of N-cadherin is an important mediator of cell survival in human OSE cells. The findings also demonstrate a potentially important role for gonadotropins and cAMP in regulating N-cadherin at multiple levels, and the findings identify components of a molecular mechanism by which this adhesion protein is regulated in human OSE. These results are physiologically and clinically important in understanding the regulation and function of human OSE. Experimental Reagents—Compounds added to culture experiments included the following: FSH, hCG, and MDL12330, which were purchased from Sigma; Bt2cAMP was from Roche Applied Science; and (Rp)-cAMPs, H89, GF109203X, PD98059, MMP-2 inhibitor I (OA-Hy), and actinomycin D were obtained from Calbiochem. Cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma. Annexin V-FLUOS staining kit was from Roche Applied Science. Protein A/G-agarose beads were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. An antibody against N-cadherin (mouse) was from Zymed Laboratories Inc., and antibodies against CREB (rabbit) and MMP-2 (mouse) were purchased from Calbiochem. The antibody against phospho-CREB (mouse) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-ubiquitin (P4D1) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-N-cadherin neutralizing antibody (GC4) (mouse) and polyclonal antibodies against β-actin (rabbit) were from Sigma, and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Bio-Rad. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotide targeting human N-cadherin was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. cDNA for dominant negative CREB (Ser-133 was replaced by Ala) was a kind gift from Dr. S. Lin (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong). Cell Culture and Transfection—Normal human OSE was isolated from women undergoing biopsies or laparoscopies for nonmalignant gynecological diseases. These cells were transfected with SV40 large T antigen to increase the proliferative life span of the cells but remained nontransformed (25Maines-Bandiera S.L. Kruk P.A. Auersperg N. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1992; 167: 729-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Three “immortalized” human OSE cell lines, IOSE-29, IOSE-397, and IOSE-398, were used in this study. The human epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in 1:1 Media 199/MCDB105 supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% fetal bovine serum. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 95% room air and 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Cells transfected with siRNA duplex oligonucleotides were incubated for 24 h prior to N-cadherin levels determination or apoptosis assay. To express cDNA construct, 1.5 μg of plasmid DNA was used per 35-mm dish. Treatments—Cells were seeded into a 6-well dish at 2 × 105 cells/well and serum-starved for 24 h before the treatment by replacing with normal growth medium, and different concentrations of FSH, hCG, or Bt2cAMP were added. Cells were then maintained in the medium for indicated times of the experiment. To inhibit adenylyl cyclase, cAMP, PKA, PKC, and MAPK activity, MDL12330, (Rp)-cAMPs, H89, GF109203X, and PD98059, respectively, was added to the culture medium for 30 min prior to the addition of 1.5 mm Bt2cAMP. To inhibit protein synthesis, cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml cycloheximide in the presence or absence of 1.5 mm Bt2cAMP for 2, 4, and 6 h. Protein was isolated from the cells at the indicated time points and analyzed by immunoblotting. To determine the stability of N-cadherin mRNA with Bt2cAMP, cells were treated for 16 h with 1.5 mm Bt2cAMP and then in the presence or absence of 4 μg/ml actinomycin D for 1, 2, 4, and 6 h. For the inhibition of transcription, 4 μg/ml of actinomycin D was added to the culture for 30 min before adding 1.5 mm Bt2cAMP. Total RNA was isolated from the cells at the indicated times. Every experiment was repeated at least twice in either duplicate or triplicate with different cell preparations to ensure consistency of the findings. Trypan Blue Exclusion Assay—OSE cells treated as indicated were harvested by trypsinization. Both attached and floating cells were combined and stained with 0.2% trypan blue solution (Sigma). Cell death was expressed as the percentage of trypan blue-stained cells. At least 250 cells per treatment were counted, and assays were performed in duplicate at least three times. Hoechst and DAPI Staining—Cells were trypsinized and fixed with Carnoy's fixative (methanol/acetic acid, 1:3) for 10 min at room temperature and then washed once with PBS. Hoechst 33258 (50 ng/ml) (Molecular Probes) or 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (1.5 μg/ml) (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) was added to the fixed cells and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Cell suspensions were mounted on slide glasses and subjected to fluorescence microscopic examination. Apoptotic cells were identified by chromatin condensation and nuclei fragmentation. The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated from the ratio of apoptotic cells to total cells counted. At minimum, 500 cells were counted in five different fields for each treatment. TUNEL Assay—Further characterization of apoptosis was achieved using a commercially available In Situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche Applied Science) to find DNA strand breaks according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were grown on glass coverslips until confluent, fixed in cold (-20 °C) methanol, and incubated with the TUNEL reaction mixture at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by rinsing slides with PBS. Omission of the enzyme in the TUNEL reaction was used as the negative control, and cells treated with DNase I were used as the positive control. The number of TUNEL-positive cells was also counted in five different fields, and representative fields were photographed. Annexin V/Propidium Iodide (PI) Staining—To confirm the findings of TUNEL assay, apoptotic cells were also detected by annexin V staining, as instructed by the manufacturer. Briefly, unfixed cells were pelleted in annexin V binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2) containing FITC-conjugated annexin V (1:100). PI at 1 μg/ml was then added, and samples were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark and analyzed by a EPICS Elite flow cytometer (Beckman Instruments). The experiment was performed in duplicate and repeated three times. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—For immunoprecipitation of ubiquitinated N-cadherin, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, supplemented with protease inhibitors of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). Cell lysates (400 μg) were precleared by incubation with 20 μl of 1:1 slurry of protein A/G-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with 1 μg of monoclonal anti-N-cadherin antibody overnight at 4 °C under constant agitation and followed by the addition of 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads for an additional 2 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with lysis buffer. The immune proteins were recovered by boiling in sample buffer, separated on SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblotting. For Western blot analysis, proteins were extracted with RIPA buffer containing complete protease inhibitor mixture. 20 μg of total proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and then incubated with the following primary antibodies: monoclonal anti-N-cadherin (1:1000), anti-phospho-CREB (0.5 μg/ml), rabbit anti-CREB (1:1000), polyclonal anti-ubiquitin (1:1000), or anti-β-actin (1:1000), in the same solution at 4 °C overnight. Bound antibodies were detected by anti-IgG conjugated with peroxidase, and proteins were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). The density of the bands was quantified by densitometric analysis using an Image Tool (version 3.0) System. Results were expressed as the ratio of N-cadherin/β-actin. Subcellular Fractionation—Crude purification of membrane-bound and -unbound fractions of cadherin was performed as described essentially in Gottardi et al. (26Gottardi C. Wong E. Gumbiner B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). In brief, control and treated cells were extracted in a non-ionic detergent buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA), and equal amounts of total protein (10 μg) were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 50 μl (∼300 μg) of concanavalin A (ConA)-Sepharose (Sigma). ConA-bound proteins were washed, and equivalent protein portions of the ConA-bound and -unbound proteins were subjected to standard SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA was extracted by the Trizol reagent, and reverse transcription (RT) was performed using the SuperScript II kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instruction. Quantitative analysis of cDNA amplification was assessed by incorporation of SYBR Green (Bio-Rad) into double-strand DNA. PCR primers for N-cadherin are as follows: forward primer, 5′-CACTGCTCAGGACCCAGAT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-TAAGCCGAGTGATGGTCC-3′. All samples were analyzed for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression (forward, 5′-ATGTTCGTCATGGGTGTGAACCA-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGGCAGGTTTTTCTAGACGGCAG-3′) in the same run as internal controls. The authenticity of the PCR products was verified by melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. Relative mRNA expression was determined by dividing the threshold of each sample by the threshold of the internal control GAPDH. These experiments were carried out in duplicate and independently repeated three times. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—0.5 μl of the RT products was amplified in a 25-μl PCR reaction mixture containing 1× buffer A, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dNTPs, and 2.5 units of DNA Taq polymerase (Promega), with 10 pmol of each set of 20–21-mer oligonucleotide primers either for N-cadherin, as described above, or MMP-2 (sense, 5′-GGCCCTGTCACTCCTGAGAT-3′, and antisense, 5′-GGCATCCAGGTTATGGGGGA-3′). The corresponding cDNA fragments were denatured at 94 °C for 45 s, annealed at 60 °C for 45 s, and extended at 72 °C for 90 s. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was conducted using the housekeeping gene GAPDH as an internal standard. The number of amplification cycles, during which PCR product formation was limited by template concentration, was determined in pilot experiments. After 21 (for N-cadherin and GAPDH) and 28 (for MMP-2) cycles of amplification, the PCR products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel. Gelatin Zymography—Equal total protein (10 μg) from conditioned media collected from control and Bt2cAMP-treated cell cultures were loaded on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels containing 0.1% gelatin under nonreducing conditions. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed twice with renaturing buffer containing 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature to remove SDS and three times with H2O to remove Triton X-100. The gels were then incubated overnight at 37 °C in the developing buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl and 20 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. The proteinase activity was visualized by staining the gel with 0.5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 30% (v/v) methanol, 10% acetic acid (v/v) for 6 h and, subsequently, destaining the gel until the bands became clear. To test the effect of the MMP-2 inhibitor, OSE cells were preincubated with the inhibitor before stimulation, and conditioned media were analyzed by zymography as described. Statistical Analysis—All experiments were performed using all three immortalized human OSE lines in duplicate and repeated at least two to three times with each experiment yielding essentially identical results. Data were expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical comparisons of control groups with treated groups were carried out using the paired sample t test. Comparisons among three or more groups were made by one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's least significant difference t test for post hoc analysis (GraphPad software, San Diego). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Blocking N-cadherin-mediated Cell-Cell Adhesion Promotes Apoptosis in OSE—We first determined whether calcium-dependent cell-cell interactions were involved in regulating OSE survival. OSE cells were cultured with serum in the presence of the calcium chelator EGTA (final concentration, 4 mm). Treatment of cells with EGTA caused cells to detach from one another (data not shown) and clearly decreased N-cadherin expression in immortalized OSE cell lines (Fig. 1A). Along with decreases in N-cadherin expression, apoptotic activity was observed. The activity occurred as early as 3 h and with peak time at 24 h after EGTA treatment (Fig. 1, B and C). To ascertain that apoptosis was attributable to interference with N-cadherin-mediated interactions, we then examined whether an adhesion blocking anti-N-cadherin antibody, GC4, which recognizes the extracellular domain of N-cadherin, could induce apoptosis in human OSE cells. Fig. 2 shows that untreated OSE cells displayed a low percentage of apoptotic cells (5.5 ± 2.2%). Treatment with GC4 (1:100) resulted in a significant reduction in cell-cell contact, and these cultures had an increased number of single cells, compared with the IgG-treated controls (Fig. 2B, left panel). Consistent with this, GC4-treated cells had a higher rate of apoptosis (47.5 ± 7.6%), a rate nearly 10-fold that of freshly harvested cells (data not shown) or cells incubated with IgG (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2), as manifested by Hoechst 33258 (data not shown), DAPI (Fig. 2A), and TUNEL staining (Fig. 2B). The apoptotic processes observed in the three immortalized OSE lines were similar. To substantiate further the conclusion that expression of N-cadherin protects OSE from apoptosis, we chose to deplete N-cadherin using small interfering RNA (siRNA). Treatment of cells with the N-cadherin siRNA, but not nonspecific-siRNA, resulted in a significant decrease in N-cadherin levels (Fig. 2C). Most importantly, treatment with N-cadherin siRNA induced apoptosis, whereas treatment with nonspecific siRNA did not (Fig. 2C). Together, these data confirm that expression of N-cadherin functions as a survival factor in human OSE.Fig. 2Apoptosis of OSE induced by N-cadherin blocking antibody GC4. IOSE-29, IOSE-397, and IOSE-398 cells were grown to confluence and then incubated in the presence of control IgG or GC4 antibody (1:100). After 24 h, cells were stained with DAPI (A) and TUNEL (B) and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Left panel, apoptotic cells exhibiting condensed or fragmented nuclei were positive for TUNEL staining. No DNA fragmentation and nuclear abnormalities were observed in the control IgG. Right panel, the histograms summarize the mean percentage of apoptotic cells counted in four fields in replicate wells from one experiment. C, OSE cells were transfected with N-cadherin (N-cad) siRNA or a nonspecific (NS)-siRNA for 1 day and then subjected to immunoblotting with indicated antibodies (left) or harvested for DAPI and TUNEL (right) assays.

Baker T.G. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1981; 63: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), in modulating N-cadherin-mediated survival signals in human OSE. Cells were grown in a number of concentrations of FSH and hCG, spanning systemic levels at low, mid, and high doses found in humans during the ovulatory cycle (16Shushan A. Paltiel O. Iscovich J. Elchalal U. Peretz T. Schenker J.G. Fertil. Steril. 1996; 65: 13-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FSH was used at 2, 20, and 200 ng/ml, and hCG was used at 0.01, 0.1, and 1 IU/ml. As shown in Fig. 3, we found that low or mid doses of FSH (2–20 ng/ml) and hCG (0.01–0.1 IU/ml) had no significant effect on N-cadherin protein expression, whereas high doses of FSH (200 ng/ml) and hCG (1 IU/ml) significantly decreased N-cadherin protein expression. The levels of N-cadherin were decreased to 18 (p < 0.05 versus control) and 41% (p < 0.05 versus control), respectively, in response to treatment with 200 ng/ml FSH and 1 IU/ml hCG (Fig. 3). In accordance with this, trypan blue exclusion assay showed a 2–3-fold increase in cell death compared with the control (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4A). To determine whether apoptosis accounted for the loss of viability in FSH- or hCG-treated cells, we first examined the presence of nuclear and DNA fragmentation using DAPI and TUNEL assays. Fig. 4 shows that the percentage of DAPI- and TUNEL-positive cells was significantly higher in FSH- or hCG-treated cultures compared with cells grown in control medium. We also examined the reactivity to annexin V-FITC in conjunction with PI to detect exposure of dislocated phosphatidylserine to the external face of the plasma membrane, a process regarded as a marker of apoptosis. In view of the cells that are positive for both annexin V and PI may also be cells that are undergoing necrosis, only the percentage of early apoptotic cells (annexin V-positive and PI-negative) was quantified from three individual experiments and shown in Fig. 4A. Treatment of cells increased the fraction of apoptotic cells to 18.7% (p < 0.05 versus control) (Fig. 4A). This magnitude of change was comparable with the fold induction detected by DAPI and TUNEL assays. The slight variation using different techniques can be accounted for by their different sensitivity and detection of specific markers in the apoptotic pathway. Together, these data demonstrate that gonadotropins can induce apoptosis of human OSE by down-regulating N-cadherin.Fig. 4Gonadotropins and cAMP induce"
https://openalex.org/W2029897520,"MBD2 and MBD3 are two proteins that contain methyl-CpG binding domains and have a transcriptional repression function. Both proteins are components of a large CpG-methylated DNA binding complex named MeCP1, which consists of the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase complex Mi2-NuRD and MBD2. MBD3L2 (methyl-CpG-binding protein 3-like 2) is a protein with substantial homology to MBD2 and MBD3, but it lacks the methyl-CpG-binding domain. Unlike MBD3L1, which is specifically expressed in haploid male germ cells, MBD3L2 expression is more widespread. MBD3L2 interacts with MBD3 in vitro and in vivo, co-localizes with MBD3 but not MBD2, and does not localize to methyl-CpG-rich regions in the nucleus. In glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, MBD3L2 is found associated with several known components of the Mi2-NuRD complex, including HDAC1, HDAC2, MTA1, MBD3, p66, RbAp46, and RbAp48. Gel shift experiments with nuclear extracts and a CpG-methylated DNA probe indicate that recombinant MBD3L2 can displace a form of the MeCP1 complex from methylated DNA. MBD3L2 acts as a transcriptional repressor when tethered to a GAL4-DNA binding domain. Repression by GAL4-MBD3L2 is relieved by MBD2 and vice versa, and repression by MBD2 from a methylated promoter is relieved by MBD3L2. The data are consistent with a role of MBD3L2 as a transcriptional modulator that can interchange with MBD2 as an MBD3-interacting component of the NuRD complex. Thus, MBD3L2 has the potential to recruit the MeCP1 complex away from methylated DNA and reactivate transcription.

Thus, MBD3L2 has the potential to recruit the MeCP1 complex away from methylated DNA and reactivate transcription. DNA methylation has the capacity to inhibit gene expression through proteins that can bind specifically to methylated CpG sequences in critical regulatory sequences (1.Wade P.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3166-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 2.Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P.

The prototype methyl-CpG-binding protein is MeCP2, a polypeptide capable of binding selectively to a single symmetrically methylated CpG sequence (4.Lewis J.D. Meehan R.R. Henzel W.J. Maurer-Fogy I. Jeppesen P. Klein F. Bird A. Cell. 1992; 69: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 5.Nan X. Meehan R.R. Bird A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4886-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). MeCP2 is physically associated with the transcriptional corepressor Sin3 and histone deacetylases in both mammalian cells and Xenopus oocytes (6.Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2781) Google Scholar, 7.Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar). This suggests that MeCP2 may play a role in the assembly of a specialized chromatin structure at methylated CpG sequences. Recruitment of MeCP2 to a promoter leads to transcriptional repression that can be partially relieved by inhibitors of histone deacetylases (6.Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2781) Google Scholar, 7.Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat.

In 1998, four additional genes, which encode methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) 1The abbreviations used are: MBD, methyl-CpG binding domain; GST, glutathione-S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TSA, trichostatin A; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole; CMV, cytomegalovirus. proteins, were identified (8.Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). These proteins were named MBD1, MBD2, MBD3, and MBD4. The five MBD-containing proteins (MBD1 to -4 and MeCP2) are most similar within their MBDs (1.Wade P.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3166-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 2.Bird A.P.

In fact, the similarity is very limited outside of the MBD with the exception of MBD2 and MBD3, which share >65% identity over most of the length of the entire MBD3 protein. Expression studies indicated that these MBD proteins are expressed in all tissues analyzed. MBD4 is a G/T mismatch-specific DNA glycosylase functioning in DNA repair by removing deaminated 5-methylcytosine bases from DNA (9.Hendrich B. Hardeland U. Ng H.H. Jiricny J. Bird A. Nature. 1999; 401: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2, and MBD3 are involved in gene silencing imposed by methylated DNA (6.Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). However, the MBD2 mRNA codes for an additional N-terminal 140 amino acids, which are not found in MBD3. This region of MBD2 contains a glycine arginine-rich repeat region of unknown function (Fig. 1). There are two translated protein products of the MBD2 mRNA: MBD2a and MBD2b. MBD2b is a shorter version of MBD2a lacking the amino-terminal 140 amino acids due to usage of a different start codon. The recombinant MBD2b protein has been reported to possess DNA demethylase activity (17.Bhattacharya S.K. Ramchandani S. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Nature. 1999; 397: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), although this finding has so far not been repeated in other laboratories (11.Ng H.-H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A.

Genet. 1999; 23: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). The recruitment of MBD2 to a promoter via a GAL4 DNA binding domain results in transcriptional repression that is, at least for certain promoters, sensitive to the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (11.Ng H.-H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In cotransfection experiments, MBD2b increased transcriptional repression with methylated reporter constructs (16.Boeke J. Ammerpohl O. Kegel S. Moehren U. Renkawitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34963-34967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). There is evidence showing that MBD2 is the methyl-CpG binding component of a larger complex named MeCP1, a methylated DNA binding complex identified a decade earlier (11.Ng H.-H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 19.Meehan R.R. Lewis J.D. McKay S. Kleiner E.L.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Whereas MBD2 is associated with HDAC1 and with RbAp48/RbAp46 by coimmunoprecipitation analysis, it is not a direct component of the previously defined Sin3 and Mi2-NuRD complexes (but see below). The coding sequence of MBD3 is highly similar to that of MBD2 throughout its entire length (8.Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). MBD3 mRNA is widely expressed in most mouse and human tissues. There are several splice variants of MBD3, including some that have a disrupted MBD. All mammalian splice variants of MBD3 fail to bind to methylated DNA in vitro (8.Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 18.Wade P.A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 35434-35439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This suggests that MBD3 may possess at least some functions that are independent of DNA methylation. However, Xenopus and zebrafish MBD3 proteins can bind to methylated DNA, presumably due to an amino acid difference in the MBD (1.Wade P.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3166-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both zebrafish (22.Macleod D. Clark V.H. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 139-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and Xenopus (23.Stancheva I. Meehan R.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 313-327PubMed Google Scholar) lack the global demethylation event characteristic of early mammalian development (24.Oswald J. Engemann S. Lane N. Mayer W. Olek A. Fundele R. Dean W. Reik W. Walter J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 475-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). NuRD-Mi2 is a multisubunit complex containing nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase activities (25.Xue Y. Wong J. Moreno G.T. Young M.K. Cote J. Wang W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 26.Wade P.A. Jones P.L. Vermaak D. Wolffe A.P. Curr.

Nature. 1998; 395: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 and the histone-binding proteins RbAp46 and RbAp48 form a core complex shared between NuRD and Sin3-histone deacetylase complexes. MBD3 was found to be a subunit of the NuRD complex (20.Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar, 21.Saito M. Ishikawa F. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 8: 843-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A protein called MTA2 modulates the enzymatic activity of the histone deacetylase core complex. MBD3 mediates the association of MTA2 with the core histone deacetylase complex. The MeCP1 complex contains 10 major polypeptides including MBD2 and all of the known NuRD components (29.Feng Q. Zhang Y. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 827-832PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, NuRD may provide an important link between gene silencing and DNA methylation. The MBD3-containing NuRD complex in mammals can be targeted to methylated DNA by MBD2 (29.Feng Q. Zhang Y. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 827-832PubMed Google Scholar). In other words, MBD2 may interact with the NuRD complex and direct the complex to methylated DNA. Recently, we have identified and cloned MBD3L1 and MBD3L2 (methyl-CpG-binding protein 3-like-1 and -2, respectively), two proteins with substantial homology to MBD2 and MBD3 (30.Jiang C.L. Jin S.G. Lee D.H. Lan Z.J. Xu X. O'Connor T.R. Szabo P.E. Mann J.R. Cooney A.J. Pfeifer G.P. Genomics. 2002; 80: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Whereas MBD3L1 is expressed predominantly in round spermatids, expression of MBD3L2 is seen in many different tissue types. Given their homology with MBD3/MBD2, it is likely that these new proteins may also play an important role in transcriptional gene silencing or regulation of silencing. Here we have characterized the biological function of MBD3L2. Cell Culture and Transfection—AD293, HeLa, NIH3T3, and COS7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 standard incubator. DNA transfections were carried out in Opti-MEM I medium (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine or Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cloning of Human MBD3L2—A search of the human EST data base using the amino acid sequences of MBD2 and MBD3 as a query revealed several human EST clones, including clone BE281376. The full-length cDNA for MBD3L2 was PCR-amplified from BE281376 and from human embryonal carcinoma cell lines (NT2 and PA1) by reverse transcription-PCR (30.Jiang C.L. Jin S.G. Lee D.H. Lan Z.J. Xu X. O'Connor T.R. Szabo P.E. Mann J.R. Cooney A.J. Pfeifer G.P. Genomics. 2002; 80: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Plasmids—For the yeast two-hybrid system, the cDNA fragments of MBD2a, MBD2b, MBD2t, MBD3, and MBD3L2 were subcloned into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pAS2–1 (baits) and pACT2 (preys) (Clontech). For the expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli, the cDNAs of MBD2b and MBD3 were subcloned in frame into the BamHI-SalI and BamHI-HindIII sites of pET-28a(+) (Novagen), respectively. The FLAG-tagged MBD3L2 construct was made by insertion of the cDNA of MBD3L2 into the EcoRI-BglII sites of pT7-FLAG (Sigma). The cDNAs encoding MBD3 or its deletion constructs (amino acids 1–80, 1–150, 1–220, 1–260, 60–120, and 81–291) and MBD3L2 or its deletion constructs (amino acids 1–89, 1–115, 1–172, and 90–204) were cloned into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences) for glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays. For the mammalian expression vectors, Myc-tagged constructs were generated by insertion of the cDNAs of MBD2a, MBD2b, MBD3, and MBD3L2 into pCMV-Tag1 (Stratagene). The GFP-MBD3L2 construct was made by inserting the cDNA of MBD3L2 into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of pEGFP-N2 (Promega). In this construct, the GFP moiety is on the N terminus, but a C-terminal-GFP-tagged protein showed identical localization patterns. Constructs fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain were generated by inserting the cDNAs of full-length MBD3L2, MBD2b, or MBD3 into the BamHI-KpnI sites or the N-terminal portion (amino acids 1–72), the central portion (amino acids 70–135), or the C-terminal portion (amino acids 134–204) of MBD3L2 into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pFA-CMV (Stratagene). All recombinant clones were verified by DNA sequencing. Northern Blot and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Northern blot was performed as previously described (30.Jiang C.L. Jin S.G. Lee D.H. Lan Z.J. Xu X. O'Connor T.R. Szabo P.E. Mann J.R. Cooney A.J. Pfeifer G.P. Genomics. 2002; 80: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Human multiple tissue poly(A+) Northern blots were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The membranes were hybridized with a 245-bp probe made with primers MBD3L2-U25 (5′-GTGGGGTCAGCAGGAGGAACTCTACA) and MBD3L2-L270 (5′-TGACCTGGTTGTCAGGATGAGACCTG). Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed with the Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System 2 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). GAL4-DNA-binding domain fusions (baits) in the pAS2–1 plasmid and GAL4-activation domain fusions (preys) in the pACT2 plasmid were expressed in the PJ69-4A yeast strain, and the transformants were cultured on synthetic dropout (SD)-Ade-His-Leu-Trp plates. Luciferase Assays—The luciferase assays were performed as previously described (30.Jiang C.L. Jin S.G. Lee D.H. Lan Z.J. Xu X. O'Connor T.R. Szabo P.E. Mann J.R. Cooney A.J. Pfeifer G.P. Genomics. 2002; 80: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). On the day before transfection, 2.5 × 105 AD293 cells were seeded per well in 24-well plates and transfected with luciferase reporter (α-globin promoter, pG5-α-Luc or pG0-α-Luc; VHL promoter, pG6-VHL-Luc or pG0-VHL-Luc) and effectors containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain and an internal control reporter for Renilla luciferase expression (pRL-TK). At 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was detected using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). For trichostatin A (TSA) (Cell Signaling) treatment, TSA was added to the culture medium (final concentration 100 ng/ml) 24 h after transfection, and cells were harvested after an additional 24 h of incubation. Values are the means with S.D. of the results obtained from three independent experiments. GST Pull-down Assays—GST protein or GST fusion proteins of MBD3L2 in the pEBG expression vector were expressed in AD293 cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection, whole cell extracts were prepared with lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 200 mm sucrose, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and adsorbed onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). After washing with lysis buffer, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS gel loading buffer and were fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The interacting proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against components of the Mi2-NuRD complex. Anti-Mi2 (1:500) and anti-p66 (1:600) antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Antibodies directed against HDAC1 (H-51, 1:1,000), HDAC2 (H-54, 1:800), mSin3A (AK-11, 1:1,000), MTA1 (A18, 1:800), RbAp46 (N-19, 1:1,000), and RbAp48 (N-19, 1:800) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-MBD2a (1:1,000) was from Abcam. Anti-MBD3 (1:1,000) was a gift from Fuyuki Ishikawa (Kyoto University). Anti-Mi2 (1:1,000) was a gift from Paul Wade (Emory University). In Vitro Binding Assays—Bacterially expressed GST and GST fusion proteins (2 μg) were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with His- or FLAG-tagged proteins (2 μg) in a binding buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitors for 90 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with binding buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with SDS gel loading buffer, fractionated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred onto nylon membranes. The membranes were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-His antibody (1:1,500) (Amersham Biosciences) or anti-FLAG antibody (1:1,500) (Stratagene) in blocking buffer and washed three times with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20. The membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies, anti-mouse IgG-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (1:4,000) (Promega), in blocking buffer and washed three times in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20. Immunoreactive bands were detected with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gel Mobility Shift Assays—Gel mobility shift assays were performed with modifications from a published procedure (11.Ng H.-H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 20.Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). The CG11 probe and anti-MBD2 antibody were gifts from Dr. Adrian Bird (Edinburgh, UK). The MCG11 probe, methylated CG11, was made by complete methylation of CG11 with SssI methylase (New England Biolabs). These probes were 32P-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Approximately 200 ng of recombinant protein was added, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature in binding buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 250 ng of E. coli DNA followed by a 30 min incubation on ice. 0.1 ng of probe and 5 μg of HeLa cell nuclear extract were added in each binding reaction. The protein-DNA complexes were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel in 0.5% TBE buffer and visualized by autoradiography. Immunofluorescence Studies—2.5 × 105 NIH3T3 or COS7 cells were cultured directly on coverslips in a 6-well plate. The transfection of these cells was achieved using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions by using 2 μg of plasmids. At 48 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS and then fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature. Then cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and washed twice with PBS. After blocking for 1 h at room temperature using 2.5% goat serum (Sigma) and 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS, the cells were incubated with the primary antibody, mouse anti-c-Myc IgG (5 μg/ml) (Sigma), for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer. The cells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 and were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 1 h in blocking buffer. The cells were washed again, stained with 0.25 μg/ml 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma), and mounted with 90% glycerol in PBS. Images were visualized with a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM310) or an Olympus IX81 fluorescence microscope. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—To test the methylation-dependent recruitment of proteins to transiently transfected reporter plasmids, AD293 cells were transfected with methylated and unmethylated pM1-luciferase constructs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were carried out largely as described previously (31.Li H. Kim J.H. Koh S.S. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4212-4220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed with 2 μg of rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-MBD2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or anti-HDAC2 (Abcam). PCR amplification was performed with DNA extracted from the immunoprecipitates, using 30 cycles of PCR. Primers used for PCR amplification of the CMV promoter were 5′-CAAGTCTCCACCCCATTGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGGTCAAAACAGCGTGGAT-3′ (reverse). For all chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, varying amounts of input and precipitated DNA samples were tested in PCRs to determine the linear range of the reaction, and the data shown are from PCRs performed with a DNA amount in the linear range. Among the family of human methyl-CpG binding domain proteins, MBD2 and MBD3 are the most closely related. We previously reported the identification of two mammalian homologues of MBD2 and MBD3, which were named MBD3L1 and MBD3L2 (30.Jiang C.L. Jin S.G. Lee D.H. Lan Z.J. Xu X. O'Connor T.R. Szabo P.E. Mann J.R. Cooney A.J. Pfeifer G.P. Genomics. 2002; 80: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the homology among MBD2, MBD3, MBD3L1, and MBD3L2. Both MBD3L1 and MBD3L2 lack the MBD. All four proteins contain a coiled-coil domain at the C terminus (Fig. 1A). The longer form of MBD2, MBD2a, contains an N-terminal glycine-arginine-rich repeat, which is absent from the shorter form, MBD2b. MBD2t is a truncated testis-specific variant of MBD2. We have focused here on the characterization of MBD3L2. Expression analysis by Northern blotting showed that the gene is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues (Fig. 2). This is in contrast to MBD3L1, which is expressed predominantly in testis, specifically in postmeiotic haploid cells (30.Jiang C.L. Jin S.G. Lee D.H. Lan Z.J. Xu X. O'Connor T.R. Szabo P.E. Mann J.R. Cooney A.J. Pfeifer G.P. Genomics. 2002; 80: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Since MBD3L1 has been shown to act as a transcriptional repressor (30.Jiang C.L. Jin S.G. Lee D.H. Lan Z.J. Xu X. O'Connor T.R. Szabo P.E. Mann J.R. Cooney A.J. Pfeifer G.P. Genomics. 2002; 80: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we analyzed the effects of MBD3L2 on the transcription of a reporter gene (Fig. 3). We conducted assays in which the MBD3L2 protein was tethered to a promoter via a fused GAL4 DNA binding domain. Two promoters having five or six tandem GAL4 DNA binding sites were chosen, the α-globin promoter and the VHL gene promoter (Fig. 3). These promoters drive the expression of a luciferase reporter gene. AD293 cells were co-transfected with the MBD3L2-GAL4 fusion constructs and the luciferase reporter plasmids. In these assays, the MBD3L2 construct inhibited expression of the α-globin promoter even more strongly than the MBD2b construct (more than 80% inhibition) (Fig. 3B). With the VHL promoter, MBD3L2 caused a 40% inhibition of promoter activity (Fig. 3D). Three parts of the MBD3L2 gene were fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. The N-terminal portion of the protein (amino acids 1–72) showed the strongest inhibition, but also the central part of the protein (amino acids 70–135) and the C-terminal portion (amino acids 134–204) inhibited reporter activity (Fig. 3B), indicating that this protein has several independent transcriptional repression domains. We next investigated whether transcriptional repression by MBD3L2 could be released by the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA (Fig. 3, C and D). TSA did not relieve transcriptional repression of the α-globin promoter, and there was an apparent further repression of this promoter by TSA. This effect of TSA may be explained by the fact that TSA affects acetylation on a global scale, and indirect effects (e.g. activation of an additional repressor) cannot be excluded. On the other hand, TSA relieved repression of the VHL promoter, indicating that the repressive effect imposed by MBD3L2 on this promoter is associated with histone deacetylation. The presence of coiled-coil domains in MBD2, MBD3, and MBD3L2 suggested that these proteins may have the potential to heterodimerize through this type of motif, which is often involved in protein-protein interactions. In order to test interactions between these proteins, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid analysis (Fig. 4A). The sequences were cloned into the GAL4 activation domain and GAL4-DNA binding domain vectors, respectively. For MBD2, we used the longer and shorter forms, MBD2a and MBD2b, as well as the testis-specific variant, MBD2t. Two-hybrid interactions were observed between MBD2a/b and MBD3. An interaction between MBD2 and MBD3 has been reported previously (32.Tatematsu K.I. Yamazaki T. Ishikawa F. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and we confirmed these findings. Binding between MBD2 and MBD3 may form the basis for the recruitment of a larger transcriptional repressor complex, NuRD-MeCP1, containing MBD3 to methylated DNA, since mammalian MBD3 alone cannot bind to CpG-methylated DNA"
https://openalex.org/W2087676473,"Gene inactivation studies have suggested that the product of the retinoblastoma gene, Rb, is particularly limiting in pituitary pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing cell lineages. Indeed, in Rb knock-out mice, these cells develop tumors with high frequency. To understand the implication of limiting Rb expression in these cells, we investigated the action of Rb and its related pocket proteins, p107 and p130, on POMC gene transcription. This led to the identification of the neurogenic basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, NeuroD1, as a target of Rb action. Rb and to a lesser extent p107, but not p130, enhance NeuroD1-dependent transcription, and this activity appears to depend on direct protein interactions between the Rb pocket and the helix-loop-helix domain of NeuroD1. In vivo, NeuroD is found in a complex that includes Rb and also the orphan nuclear receptor NGFI-B, which mediates corticotropin-releasing hormone activation of POMC transcription. The formation of a similar complex in vitro requires the presence of Rb as a bridge between NeuroD and NGFI-B. In POMC-expressing AtT-20 cells, Rb and p107 are present on the POMC promoter and inhibition of their expression through small interfering RNA decreases POMC mRNA levels. The action of Rb and its related proteins on POMC transcription may contribute to the establishment and/or maintenance of the differentiation phenotype.

Current models propose that the anti-oncogenic functions of Rb result from its ability to arrest the cell cycle by the inhibition of E2F activity (1Morris E.J. Dyson N.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 82: 1-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). However, Rb and the related “pocket” proteins p107 and p130 are not only negative cell cycle regulators; they also act positively on differentiation of many cell types. By its capacity to interact and to enhance activities of cell-specific transcription factors such as MyoD, NF-IL6, c/EBPα/β, Cbfa-1, and AP-2, Rb acts as positive regulator of differentiation in myoblasts, adipoblasts, osteoblasts, and epithelial cells (1Morris E.J. Dyson N.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 82: 1-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In this context, it is noteworthy that the anti-oncogenic activity of Rb has been more often associated with late stage rather than onset of tumor progression, because Rb is mutated more frequently in dedifferentiated tumor cells (i.e. in carcinomas rather than adenomas), in several tissues, and particularly in the human pituitary gland (2Hinton D.R. Hahn J.A. Weiss M.H. Couldwell W.T. Cancer Lett. 1998; 126: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 3Suhardja A. Kovacs K. Rutka J. J. Neurooncol. 2001; 52: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Mice heterozygous for Rb mutations always develop pituitary tumors that arise from the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing melanotroph cells (3Suhardja A. Kovacs K. Rutka J. J. Neurooncol. 2001; 52: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4Hu N. Gutsmann A. Herbert D.C. Bradley A. Lee W.H. Lee E.Y. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1021-1027PubMed Google Scholar). p107 and p130 also participate in developmental processes during limb development and osteogenesis (5Cobrinik D. Lee M.H. Hannon G. Mulligan G. Bronson R.T. Dyson N. Harlow E. Beach D. Weinberg R.A. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1633-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 6van Gurp M.F. Pratap J. Luong M. Javed A. Hoffmann H. Giordano A. Stein J.L. Neufeld E.J. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. van Wijnen A.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5980-5988PubMed Google Scholar). The POMC gene is expressed in two different pituitary lineages. In corticotrophs, POMC processing leads to synthesis of ACTH, whereas in melanotrophs, it produces α-melanotropin-stimulating hormone by an additional step of proteolytic cleavage (7Lundblad J.R. Roberts J.L. Endocr. Rev. 1988; 9: 135-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Within human pituitary adenomas, the ACTH-producing ones are the most frequent to progress to aggressive stages characterized by poorly differentiated invasive and non-secreting cells (8Asa S.L. Ezzat S. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 798-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). This was correlated with the loss of Rb expression in corticotroph carcinomas (2Hinton D.R. Hahn J.A. Weiss M.H. Couldwell W.T. Cancer Lett. 1998; 126: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus and because we found that Rb can activate POMC transcription (50Batsché E. Desroches J. Bilodeau S. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (March 11, 10.1074/jbcM41328200)Google Scholar), we hypothesized that part of Rb function in corticotroph cells, including some anti-oncogenic activity, may be dependent on a positive effect on differentiation. To assess the role of Rb in the differentiation of POMC-expressing cells, we investigated the mechanisms by which Rb acts on transcriptional regulation of the POMC gene that is the hallmark of corticotroph function. Corticotroph-specific transcription of the POMC gene results from synergistic interactions between the homeobox factor Pitx1, the neurogenic bHLH factor NeuroD1/Beta2, and the T-box factor Tpit (10Lamonerie T.

Cell. 2001; 104: 849-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The factors Tpit and NeuroD1 are restricted to the POMC lineages and are required for appropriate cell differentiation (13Pulichino A.M. Vallette-Kasic S. Tsai J.P.Y. Couture C. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14Lamolet B. Poulin G. Chu K. Guillemot F. Tsai M.J. Drouin J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The Pitx1 factor is more widely expressed during early development (15Lanctôt C. Lamolet B. Drouin J. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 2807-2817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is important for craniofacial and limb patterning (16Lanctôt C. Moreau A. Chamberland M. Tremblay M.L. Drouin J. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 1805-1810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, together with Pitx2, for early pituitary organogenesis (17Suh H. Gage P.J. Drouin J. Camper S.A. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 329-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In corticotrophs, Pitx1 is implicated in cell-specific activity of the POMC promoter by direct interactions resulting in transcriptional synergism with Tpit (12Lamolet B. Pulichino A.M. Lamonerie T. Gauthier Y. Brue T. Enjalbert A. Drouin J. Cell. 2001; 104: 849-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), and with the NeuroD1 heterodimerization partners (11Poulin G. Lebel M. Chamberland M. Paradis F.W. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4826-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). POMC transcription also depends on the balance of stimulatory signals elicited by hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and negative signals produced by glucocorticoids and their receptors. We have shown that a binding site for orphan nuclear receptors of the NGFI-B subfamily (which includes NGFI-B/Nur77, Nurr1, and NOR-1) is responsive to CRH (18Philips A. Lesage S. Gingras R. Maira M.H. Gauthier Y. Hugo P. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5946-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). This Nur response element (NurRE) is a palindrome constituted of two half-sites with partial homology to a binding site for Nur monomers known as the NGFI-B-binding response element (19Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Johnston M. Milbrandt J. Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The POMC NurRE is recognized by Nur factor homo- or heterodimers (20Maira M.H. Martens C. Philips A. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7549-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and it was shown to be much more responsive to CRH than the NGFI-B-binding response element (18Philips A. Lesage S. Gingras R. Maira M.H. Gauthier Y. Hugo P. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5946-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). We showed recently that in response to CRH the p160/SRC coactivators are recruited to Nur dimers at the NurRE and also to Tpit (21Maira M.H. Martens C. Batsche E. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 763-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 22Maira M.H. Couture C. Le Martelot G. Pulichino A.M. Bilodeau S. Drouin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46523-46532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The SRC/p160 coactivator family consists of three proteins designated SRC-1/NCoA-1, SRC-2/TIF2/GRIP1/NCoA-2, and SRC-3/p/CIP/RAC3/ACTR/AIB-1/TRAM-1 (23McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). SRC coactivators interact with transcription factors and mediate their transcriptional effects through their histone acetyltransferase activity or their interactions with other transcriptional regulators, such as CBP/p300, p/CAF, histone methyltransferase CARM1, and the SWI/SNF complex (23McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). We showed recently that Rb or related proteins also associate with nuclear receptor-SRC complexes, and particularly with the NGFI-B-SRC2 complex, to enhance the transcriptional response of the POMC promoter to CRH (50Batsché E. Desroches J. Bilodeau S. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (March 11, 10.1074/jbcM41328200)Google Scholar). In this present study, we show that Rb activates POMC transcription through its interaction with NeuroD1, in addition to its previously reported interaction with NGFI-B. Both Rb and the related p107, but not p130, can enhance NeuroD1-dependent POMC promoter activity. The transcriptional synergism between NeuroD1 and NGFI-B may be explained by the action of Rb as a protein bridge allowing co-recruitment of NeuroD1 and NGFI-B within the same protein complex. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was performed as described (13Pulichino A.M. Vallette-Kasic S. Tsai J.P.Y. Couture C. Gauthier Y. Drouin J.

Expression vectors for CMV-Rb, pSG5L-hemagglutinin-Rb and tumor-derived mutants were described by Kaelin and co-workers (27Sellers W.R. Novitch B.G. Miyake S. Heith A. Otterson G.A. Kaye F.J. Lassar A.B. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), whereas CMV-mRbΔp34 (Δp34) vector was described by Hamel et al. (28Hamel P.A. Gill R.M. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 693-701PubMed Google Scholar), and CMV-p107 and CMV-p130 was obtained from Dr. Sylvain Meloche. GST-Rb plasmids were described previously (50Batsché E. Desroches J. Bilodeau S. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (March 11, 10.1074/jbcM41328200)Google Scholar). The CVM-RbΔ22 expression vectors were constructed by insertion of the BamH1 cDNA insert from SV-RbΔ22 (29Batsche E. Muchardt C. Behrens J. Hurst H.C. Cremisi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3647-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) into pcDNA1 vector. Transfection experiments with pcDNA1-Rb gave similar results as with CMV-Rb. Cell Culture and Transfection—Cell culture and transfection of AtT-20 cells were described previously (22Maira M.H. Couture C. Le Martelot G. Pulichino A.M. Bilodeau S. Drouin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46523-46532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Wild type and triple knockout (TKO) mouse embryo fibroblasts (30Sage J. Mulligan G.J. Attardi L.D. Miller A. Chen S. Williams B. Theodorou E. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3037-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) used at passages 3–10 were transfected with Effectene (Qiagen), and C33A cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method. Luciferase activities were assayed 2 days after transfection. Transfection efficiencies were normalized using a co-transfected CMV-β-galactosidase plasmid (10 ng). Each transfection in duplicate was repeated 3–10 times using different plasmid preparations. RNA Interference—siRNA against mouse Rb and p107 genes were designed to target the following sequences, cttgacaagagaaatgata and ccatgcttaaatcagaaga for Rb and CAAGCTAATAGTCACGTAT and CGAAATGACTATTATCGTT for p107. The siRNA control targeted the GCAGCACGACTTCTTCAAG sequences in green fluorescent protein mRNA. All duplexes were synthesized at Proligo as 21-mers with dTdT 3′ overhangs. Each transfection was repeated at least 3 times in duplicate. AtT-20 cells were platted in 6-well plates and transfected with 400 pmols of siRNA green fluorescent protein or with 100 pmol of each siRNA for Rb and p107 using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Two days after transfection, cells were harvested, and total RNA was extracted using phenol/chloroform method. RNA were treated 1 h with RNase-free DNase I (Roche Diagnostics), which was then heat-inactivated by a 10-min incubation at 70 °C. Reverse transcription was done with 2 μg of this RNA, random hexanucleotides, and SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen) during 1 h. An aliquot of this reaction mixture was used for quantitative real time PCR. GST Pull-down Assays—GST fusion proteins and 35S-labeled Rb, NGFI-B, and NeuroD1/Beta2 mutants were produced as described (29Batsche E. Muchardt C. Behrens J. Hurst H.C. Cremisi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3647-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Labeled proteins were incubated with 1 μg of immobilized GST or GST-Rb constructs in 150 μl of TNEN50 (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed at 4 °C twice in TNEN250 and twice in TNEN125. Bound proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue to ensure that similar amounts of fusion proteins were recovered, and then autoradiographed. Co-immunoprecipitation Assays and Western Blots—C33A cells (10-cm plate) were transfected with 7 μg of each expression plasmid and harvested 48 h later. These and AtT-20 cells were harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline and extracted for 30 min at 4 °C in TNEN250 with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitors. After centrifugation, supernatants corresponding to 107 cells were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 4 h with α-FLAG M2 (Sigma), α-hemagglutinin (sc-805, Santa Cruz), α-Rb, α-p107 (C-18, Santa Cruz), α0NeuroD1/Beta2 (rabbit polyclonal (26Poulin G. Turgeon B. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6673-6682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and isotype-matched non-immune IgG (Sigma) as a control. Immunoprecipitates obtained after 1 h of incubation with protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz) saturated with bovine serum albumin were washed twice with TNEN250 and thrice with TNEN125. After SDS-PAGE, Western blots were revealed with antibodies against FLAG M2, hemagglutinin, Rb, NGFI-B (554088, Pharmingen) and NeuroD1/Beta2. Western blot analysis was performed as described (29Batsche E. Muchardt C. Behrens J. Hurst H.C. Cremisi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3647-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—AtT-20 cell extracts were prepared for ChIP as described (31Thomas D.M. Carty S.A. Piscopo D.M. Lee J.S. Wang W.F. Forrester W.C. Hinds P.W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 303-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Supernatants corresponding to 107 cells were subjected to overnight immunoprecipitation at 4 °C with 3 μg of antibodies against NGFI-B, Rb, p107, NeuroD1, and isotype-matched non-immune IgG as the negative control. Immunoprecipitates were collected with protein A/G-agarose beads saturated with bovine serum albumin and tRNA. Beads were washed as described by Upstate Biotechnology. Quantitative PCR was performed by quantitative real time PCR or on serial 4-fold dilutions of DNA extracted from immunoprecipitates. These PCR products were separated on agarose gels and revealed by hybridization with appropriate DNA probes. Quantification of signals for different dilutions was performed with PhosphorImager. Primers and Quantitative Real Time PCR—Quantitative real time PCR (Stratagene MX-4000 or Applied Abiprism7000) was used with the SYBR Green kit (Qiagen or Applied). The primers used were as follows: POMC promoter 5′-TCCATTGCCCACCACAGAGCGC (–703) and 5′-GCCTAGTTCTGAGATCTTGCAG (–332); POMC exon 3 5′-ACCGGGTGGAGCACTTCCGCTG (+5375) and 5′-GGGGCAAGGAGGTTGAGAAATG (+5746); POMC 5′-untranslated region-exon 1 5′-ACCCACCCAACCCTGCAAGTATAA and 5′-TGGCCTCTCTTAGTCACTGCTCTT; β-actin (exon 3) 5′-TGATGGTGGGAATGGGTCAGAA and 5′-TCCATGTCGTCCCAGTTGGTAA; β2-μglobulin TGCTATCCAGAAAACCCCTCA (+109) and 5′-GCGGGTGGAACTGTGTTACG (+209); Rb1 exon 18-exon 19 5′-ATGGAATCCCTTGCATGGCT (+1612) and 5′-AGGACAAGCAGGTTCAAGGT (+1710); p107 exon 21-exon 22 5′AGCGCACTGCTGTACAAGTT (+3047) and 5′-TTTGGCAGGTGAGTCTGCAT (+3181). PCR efficiency and comparative quantification were calculated as described previously (32Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2003-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (24564) Google Scholar, 33Ramakers C. Ruijter J.M. Deprez R.H. Moorman A.F. Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 339: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2824) Google Scholar) and are expressed relative to the β-actin transcript or DNA template, for real time or ChIP assays, respectively. Rb Enhancement of POMC Promoter Is Cell-specific—We have previously shown that Rb enhances the activity of the POMC promoter, and a part of this action was ascribed to interactions with the orphan nuclear receptor NGFI-B (50Batsché E. Desroches J. Bilodeau S. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (March 11, 10.1074/jbcM41328200)Google Scholar). When the effect of Rb was tested on the intact POMC promoter, it was found that Rb enhances POMC promoter activity in POMC-expressing AtT-20 cells (Fig. 1A) but not in other cells (Fig. 1B). This effect was observed with reporters containing the upstream regulatory sequences of the POMC promoter (34Therrien M. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3492-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 35Therrien M. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2342-2353Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) but not with reporters devoid of these sequences (Fig. 1A), suggesting that cell-specific recognition elements of the POMC promoter are required for Rb action. To determine whether endogenous Rb or related proteins such as p107 contribute to basal POMC expression, we used siRNAs complementary to Rb and p107 (two oligonucleotides complementary to each) to inhibit their expression in AtT-20 cells. Reduction of Rb and p107 expression was accompanied by a decrease in POMC mRNA but not of β2-microglobulin mRNA used as control (Fig. 1C). Thus, constitutive POMC expression is partly dependent on Rb-related protein. We next ascertained that Rb is expressed in normal pituitary corticotroph cells. Previous work had shown co-expression of Rb and p107 throughout pituitary development (36Jiang Z. Zacksenhaus E. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1789-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We therefore used double immunohistochemistry against Rb and ACTH to reveal co-expression of these two proteins in corticotrophs. At day 14.5 of mouse embryonic development, the pattern of Rb-positive cells partly overlapped with ACTH immunoreactivity (Fig. 1C). This indicates that POMC-expressing corticotrophs express Rb. However, strong Rb expression was also observed in the rostral tip of the pituitary that contains αGSU-expressing cells and these were also shown by co-labeling to be Rb-positive (Fig. 1D). These results show wide Rb expression in the pituitary and particularly in corticotrophs. Corticotroph-specific Sequences Are Targets of Rb—Using a panel of POMC promoter deletion constructs, Rb enhancement was only observed with reporters containing cell-specific regulatory sequences (Fig. 2A). Cell-specific activity requires regulatory sequences present in the distal and central regions of the promoter (34Therrien M. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3492-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To define more precisely the Rb-response elements, we used a series of linker-scanning mutations of the POMC promoter (26Poulin G. Turgeon B. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6673-6682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Therrien M. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3492-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This analysis showed that binding sites for the cell-restricted factors Pitx1, Tpit, and NeuroD1 (Eboxneuro) were essential for Rb enhancement (Fig. 2B). It showed that the NurRE and distal region-1 regulatory elements are also essential for Rb action. The loss of Rb responsiveness is not always associated with loss of promoter activity, because other POMC promoter mutants (with decreased basal activity) are still responsive to Rb. Thus, previously described factors, which act on cell-specific regulatory sequences, such as Pitx1, Tpit, and NeuroD1 (26Poulin G. Turgeon B. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6673-6682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Therrien M. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3492-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), are potential targets of Rb action. In addition, the Nur factors that recognize the NurRE may also be Rb targets. The role of distal region-1 binding transcription factors in this regulatory complex remains unexplored. Rb Targets NeuroD1—To identify POMC transcription factor(s) targeted by Rb, we used reporter constructs dependent on individual regulatory elements in transfection experiments. This analysis (Fig. 3A) confirmed the action of Rb on the composite distal regulatory element containing the NurRE and Eboxneuro (construct 3) and also showed that the Eboxneuro on its own conferred Rb responsiveness (construct 4). In contrast, an Eboxneuro mutant (construct 5) and the distal region-1 element (construct 2) were unresponsive to Rb as was the central region of the promoter that contains the binding sites for Pitx1 and Tpit (Fig. 3A, construct 1). Because the Eboxneuro is targeted by heterodimers of NeuroD1 and ubiquitous bHLH factors such as Pan1 (11Poulin G. Lebel M. Chamberland M. Paradis F.W. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4826-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we assessed more directly in a reconstituted system the action of Rb on NeuroD1-dependent activity. The Rb-deficient C33A cells used in these experiments do not express Tpit, Pitx1, or NeuroD1 (data not shown). Although Rb had no effect in absence of NeuroD1, it enhanced NeuroD1-dependent activity on the POMC promoter (Fig. 3B) and on the Eboxneuro reporter (Fig. 3E). An EboxUbi reporter, which is dependent on ubiquitous bHLH factors (11Poulin G. Lebel M. Chamberland M. Paradis F.W. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4826-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 26Poulin G. Turgeon B. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6673-6682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), did not exhibit Rb responsiveness even in presence of Pan1, the ubiquitous dimerization partner of NeuroD1 (Fig. 3D). Moreover, Rb did not affect the synergistic action of Pitx1 on the Pan1-dependent activity (Fig. 3D) (11Poulin G. Lebel M. Chamberland M. Paradis F.W. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4826-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Similarly, and in accordance with results obtained with the central region-containing promoter (Fig. 3A), a Pitx1-Tpit reporter plasmid did not exhibit responsiveness to Rb (Fig. 3C). NeuroD1 was the only factor whose activity was enhanced by Rb (Fig. 3E). These results strongly suggest that NeuroD1 itself is the target of Rb action within the POMC cell-specific regulatory complex. Rb-related Protein p107, but Not p130, also Potentiates POMC Promoter Activity—Rb is the founding member of the pocket protein family that also includes p107 and p130 (37Lipinski M.M. Jacks T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7873-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). We assessed in AtT-20 cells the ability of these proteins to activate the POMC promoter or a multimer construct containing all regulatory elements required for corticotroph-specific transcription. Fig. 4 shows that only p107, but not p130, is able to stimulate activity of these promoters. Although p130 potentiates NGFI-B activity as well as Rb or p107 (50Batsché E. Desroches J. Bilodeau S. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (March 11, 10.1074/jbcM41328200)Google Scholar), the ability to enhance corticotroph-specific transcription of the POMC promoter is strongest for Rb followed by p107 (50Batsché E. Desroches J. Bilodeau S. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (March 11, 10.1074/jbcM41328200)Google Scholar), probably reflecting the ability of these two proteins to enhance NeuroD1 activity. Rb Activation of POMC Transcription Depends on the Pocket Domain, but Not on Rb Phosphorylation Status—To test whether Rb mutations found in tumors also affect the activation of the POMC promoter by Rb, we tested in AtT-20 cells the effect of the Δex22 pocket mutant, which is unable to bind E2F, to arrest cells in G1 and to promote differentiation (27Sellers W.R. Novitch B.G. Miyake S. Heith A. Otterson G.A. Kaye F.J. Lassar A.B. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). This mutation reduced by ∼50% the capacity of Rb to induce the POMC promoter (Fig. 4) suggesting that the pocket domain of Rb is implicated at least in part in this action of Rb. Also, considering the importance of Rb phosphorylation for cell cycle control, we assessed the activity of the Δp34 mutant that has mutations in eight p34cdc-dependent Rb phosphorylation sites and that is no longer subject to phosphorylation-dependent E2F derepression (28Hamel P.A. Gill R.M. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 693-701PubMed Google Scholar). Because AtT-20 cells have mostly hyperphosphorylated Rb as a result of the loss of p16 expression (38Frost S.J. Simpson D.J. Clayton R.N. Farrell W.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), a requirement for dephosphorylated Rb for activation o"

Studies in murine models of acute inflammation and experimental arthritis demonstrated that TSG-6 has a strong anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective effect. TSG-6 protein is composed of the N-terminal link module that binds hyaluronan and a C-terminal CUB domain, present in a variety of proteins. Interactions between the isolated link module and hyaluronan have been studied extensively, but little is known about the binding of full-length TSG-6 protein to hyaluronan and other glycosaminoglycans. We show that TSG-6 protein and hyaluronan, in a temperature-dependent fashion, form a stable complex that is resistant to dissociating agents. The formation of such stable complexes may underlie the activities of TSG-6 protein in inflammation and fertility, e.g. the TSG-6-dependent cross-linking of hyaluronan in the cumulus cell-oocyte complex during ovulation. Because adhesion to hyaluronan is involved in cell trafficking in inflammatory processes, we also studied the effect of TSG-6 on cell adhesion. TSG-6 binding to immobilized hyaluronan did not interfere with subsequent adhesion of lymphoid cells. In addition to immobilized hyaluronan, full-length TSG-6 also binds free hyaluronan and all chondroitin sulfate isoforms under physiological conditions. These interactions may contribute to the localization of TSG-6 in cartilage and to its chondroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in models of arthritis.

More recently, it has become clear that TSG-6 also plays an essential role in female fertility (1Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15: 129-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11Fülöp C. Szanto S. Mukhopadhyay D. Bardos T. Kamath R.V. Rugg M.S. Day A.J. Salustri A. Hascall V.C. Glant T.T. Mikecz K. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 2253-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The protein consists of two domains, the N-terminal link module and the C-terminal CUB domain. The link module has long been recognized as a hyaluronan (HA)-binding domain (12Goetinck P.F. Stirpe N.S. Tsonis P.A. Carlone D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Perin J-P. Bonnet F. Thurieau C. Jolles P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13269-13272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the link module is a characteristic feature of members of the family of HA-binding proteins known as hyaladherins (14Toole B.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 839-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 15Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Although the link module is shared by all hyaladherins, TSG-6 is the only known member of this protein family containing a CUB domain. The CUB domain is present in a variety of proteins with diverse functions (16Bork P. Beckmann G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 17Topfer-Petersen E. Romero A. Varela P.F. Ekhlasi-Hundrieser M. Dostalova Z. Sanz L. Calvete J.J. Andrologia. 1998; 30: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The CUB domain of spermadhesins, a family of proteins involved in fertilization, has been characterized as a glycosaminoglycan (GAG)- and oligosaccharide-binding module (17Topfer-Petersen E. Romero A. Varela P.F. Ekhlasi-Hundrieser M. Dostalova Z. Sanz L. Calvete J.J. Andrologia. 1998; 30: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The study of the interactions between proteins and GAGs has been hampered by limitations of the assays used for their analysis. Adsorptive binding of GAGs to microtiter plates is not sufficiently stable to permit the application of stringent binding and washing conditions and, in particular, the use of dissociating agents. Adsorptive binding of GAG-binding proteins to the surface of microtiter plates, due to the differential hydrophobicity of the protein surface, may result in binding of these proteins in a preferred orientation. This may affect, and in extreme cases prevent, their interaction with GAGs. Another method used to investigate GAG-protein interactions, precipitation of GAG-protein complexes by cetyl pyridinium chloride (3Lee T.H. Wisniewski H-G. Vilcek J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 18Scott J.E. Biochemistry. 1961; 81: 418-424Google Scholar), may result in the nonspecific coprecipitation of some proteins and does not provide quantitative data. These technical limitations may also have affected our understanding of the interactions of TSG-6 with HA and other GAGs. In addition, virtually all detailed studies addressing the binding of TSG-6 to HA have been carried out with the isolated link module, i.e. the N-terminal domain of TSG-6, and not with the full-length protein (19Blundell C.D. Mahoney D.J. Almond A. DeAngelis P.L. Kahmann J.D. Teriete P. Pickford A.R. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, the CUB domain, known as a GAG-binding domain from studies with other proteins, may also affect the binding of TSG-6 to GAGs (17Topfer-Petersen E. Romero A. Varela P.F. Ekhlasi-Hundrieser M. Dostalova Z. Sanz L. Calvete J.J. Andrologia. 1998; 30: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 24Calvete J.J. Dostalova Z. Sanz L. Adermann K. Thole H.H. Topfer-Petersen E.

Dev. 1993; 35: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, the binding of full-length, glycosylated TSG-6 protein to GAGs deserves additional study. In the present study, we used covalently coupled HA to analyze the interactions between full-length recombinant TSG-6 protein and HA or chondroitin sulfate (CS). The use of coupled HA permits the use of a wide range of binding and washing conditions, thereby reducing or eliminating nonspecific interactions and facilitating the testing of the stability of protein-GAG complexes with the aid of dissociating agents. We show that both full-length TSG-6 and the TSG-6 link module, in a temperature-dependent fashion, form a stable complex with HA. We further demonstrate that TSG-6 binds to HA and all common forms of CS under physiological conditions. We also show that covalently coupled HA can be used to analyze the adhesion of cells to HA. The formation of a stable bond between TSG-6 and HA is likely to have important functional implications in inflammation and fertility.

Chondroitin 4,6-sulfate (C-4,6-S) and chondroitin 6-sulfate (C-6-S) were purchased from Sigma, and chondroitin 4-sulfate (C-4-S) was purchased from Calbiochem. According to information from the suppliers, C-4,6-S (Sigma C6737, lot 43K1125) contains 57% C-4-S and 43% C-6-S; C-6-S (Sigma C4384, lot 42K1434) contains 85% C-6-S and 15% C-4-S, and C-4-S (Calbiochem 230687, lot B27594) contains 80% C-4-S and 20% C-6-S. Dextran sulfate from Leukonostoc spp. with an average molecular weight of 10,000 was from Sigma (D6924). N-Dodecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propanesulfonate (lauryl sulfobetaine (LSB), zwittergent), p-nitrophenyl phosphate, Trizma, and Tween 20 were purchased from Sigma. The biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody was from Dako, and the streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate was purchased from Invitrogen. For the detection of TSG-6, a rabbit antibody raised against native recombinant TSG-6 was used. TSG-6 Protein—TSG-6 protein was expressed in BTI-TN-5B1-4 insect cells after infection with recombinant nuclear polyhedrosis virus (baculovirus) and purified as described (6Mindrescu C.

TSG-6 Link Module—The link module of TSG-6 was expressed, using the baculovirus expression system, similar to the expression of full-length TSG-6. From a construct containing a full-length TSG-6 cDNA in pGEM-7Zf, an SphI/HindIII fragment was isolated and digested with HgaI, and the SphI/HgaI fragment (470 bp) was isolated. After filling in with T4 polymerase and digestion with EcoRI, the fragment was cloned into the EcoRI/SmaI-digested pBacPAK8 transfer vector. This construct encodes the link module of TSG-6 with a C-terminal extension that consists of the amino acid residues Tyr128 to Glu134 connecting the link module with the CUB domain of TSG-6, followed by the sequence WGGRLIN. Recombinant nuclear polyhedrosis virus was generated using standard techniques (26Wisniewski H-G. Burgess W.H. Oppenheim J.D. Vilcek J.

The TSG-6 link module was expressed in BTI-TN-5B1-4 insect cells, and the recombinant link module was purified as described for TSG-6 (6Mindrescu C. Thorbecke G.J. Klein M.J. Vilcek J. Wisniewski H-G. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 2668-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Wisniewski H-G. Burgess W.H. Oppenheim J.D. Vilcek J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), resulting in a similar purity. Biotinylation of HA and Coupling of HA to Plates—HA from rooster comb was biotinylated as described (27Frost G.I. Stern R. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). HA and biotinylated HA (HA-bio) were coupled to Cov-NH plates as described (27Frost G.I. Stern R. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In short, HA at a concentration of 100 μg/ml in double distilled H2O containing N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide at 92 μg/ml and N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide at 61.5 μg/ml was incubated in Cov-NH (100 μl/well) for 2 h at ambient temperature and overnight at 4 °C. Thereafter, the wells were washed three times with 2 m NaCl and three times with double distilled H2O. Cov-NH plates containing coupled HA are referred to as Cov-HA. Based on competition experiments with HA in solution, the approximate amount of HA coupled to the Covalink plates can be calculated. Our calculations indicated that 8 to 9.6 μg of HA is actually coupled per well of Cov-HA. TSG-6 Binding Assay—Cov-HA and Cov-NH plates were blocked with 0.1% casein in Tris-buffered saline (TTBS: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) before any binding experiments were carried out. Unless indicated otherwise, TSG-6 protein was diluted in TTBS for binding experiments. After incubation with TSG-6 protein at 37 °C, or as indicated in individual experiments, Cov-HA or Cov-NH was washed three times with TTBS, followed by incubation with a rabbit anti-TSG-6 antiserum (dilution 1:1000 in TTBS), a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody (dilution 1:1000 in TTBS), a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (dilution 1:1000 in TTBS), and finally p-nitrophenyl phosphate (2 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris, pH 9.5). Between every incubation step with antibodies, etc., the wells were washed three times with 200 μl of TTBS. The amount of dephosphorylated substrate was determined by measuring the absorbance at 410 nm, using the wave length of 750 nm as reference. Binding of BW 5147 Cells to Immobilized HA—BW 5147 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum. In order to evaluate their binding to immobilized HA, 2 × 105 BW 5147 cells were plated into wells of Cov-HA or Cov-NH plates blocked with 0.1% casein in TTBS. After 15 min to 2 h, the medium of the wells was aspirated, and the wells were washed three times with 200 μl of PBS. Remaining cells were fixed for 15 min in 10% formalin (in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 3.5) and stained for 30 min in 0.05% naphthol blue black in the same buffer. Thereafter, the wells were washed extensively with distilled water, and the dye was eluted from the stained cells with 150 μlof50mm NaOH. Finally, the concentration of the eluted dye was determined by measuring the absorbance at 615 nm. The wavelength of 800 nm was used as reference wavelength. The concentration of the eluted dye thus provides a measure of the number of cells adhering to immobilized HA. Coupling of HA to Cov-NH—In order to evaluate the covalent binding of HA to Cov-NH, we coupled increasing amounts of biotinylated HA (HA-bio) to Cov-NH. Significant amounts of HA-bio were coupled if HA-bio concentrations of 100–500 μg/ml were used (Fig. 1A). Because the 5-fold increase in the HA-bio concentration from 100 to 500 μg/ml resulted in only a modest increase in the amount of bound HA-bio, 100 μg/ml HA, equivalent to a total of 10 μg of HA per well, was used for the covalent coupling of HA to Cov-NH in all experiments reported here. HA-bio coupled to Cov-NH proved to be resistant to treatment with 6 m guanidine HCl (Fig. 1B). In contrast, a significant part of HA-bio coupled covalently to Cov-NH was susceptible to treatment with hyaluronidase from Streptomyces hyalurolyticus, with ∼70% of the bound HA-bio removed by treatment with 1 unit/ml hyaluronidase for 1 h (Fig. 1C). Treatment with up to 100 units/ml hyaluronidase did not result in further degradation of the immobilized HA-bio (data not shown). Binding of TSG-6 to Immobilized HA—Next, we determined the binding of recombinant TSG-6 to Cov-HA. Purified recombinant TSG-6 bound to Cov-HA in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 2A). Binding of TSG-6 to immobilized HA at 37 °C was clearly detectable at a TSG-6 protein concentration of 2 nm and increased up to 50 nm without indication of reaching saturation of binding. Even at a concentration of 50 nm TSG-6, there was very little HA-independent binding of TSG-6 to Cov-NH (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B shows the kinetics of TSG-6 binding to immobilized HA at a concentration of 5 nm TSG-6 at 37 °C. TSG-6 binding was detectable within 5 min and increased steadily over a 2-h period. Little additional binding could be detected thereafter (data not shown). Although TSG-6 bound to immobilized HA much faster at the physiological temperature of 37 °C, binding was detected at 4 °C (Fig. 2C). In order to determine whether TSG-6 binds not only to immobilized HA, but also to HA in solution, we conducted competition experiments by adding increasing amounts of HA to the wells of a Cov-HA plate together with recombinant TSG-6. Fig. 2D shows that free HA efficiently competed, in a concentration-dependent fashion, with immobilized HA for the binding of 10 nm TSG-6. TSG-6 Forms a Stable Bond with HA in a Temperature-dependent Fashion—In order to determine the stability of the bond between TSG-6 and immobilized HA, we incubated TSG-6 with immobilized HA at 37 °C for 2 h, removed unbound TSG-6 by washing with TTBS, and subjected bound TSG-6 to various dissociating agents for 15 min. Fig. 3A shows that most of the bound TSG-6 proved to be resistant to treatment with 6 m guanidine HCl containing 8% LSB, reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer, or 25 mm NaOH. These findings show that much of the bound TSG-6 formed a stable complex with immobilized HA. About the same percentage of HA-bound TSG-6 that was resistant to treatment with 6 m guanidine HCl containing 8% LSB also resisted treatment with reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer or 25 mm NaOH. The latter findings suggest that the same fraction of TSG-6 that resisted washing with guanidine HCl also resisted the other stringent washing conditions and is likely to represent the fraction of TSG-6 that formed a stable complex with HA (Fig. 3A). Treatment of TSG-6 bound to Cov-HA with guanidine HCl for up to 60 min did not affect the amount of TSG-6 that remained bound to Cov-HA (data not shown). In contrast, binding of TSG-6 to immobilized HA at 4 °C did not result in the formation of a similarly stable bond. TSG-6 was incubated in Cov-HA at 4 °C overnight and washed with TTBS before an additional wash under various stringent conditions was carried out for 15 min at ambient temperature. Fig. 3B shows that TSG-6 bound to immobilized HA at 4 °C was not only sensitive to treatment with dissociating agents such as 6 m guanidine HCl containing 8% LSB, 4 m guanidine HCl, or SDS-PAGE sample buffer but even to incubation at pH 2.5. Even incubation with 2 m NaCl resulted in a partial loss of the bound TSG-6 (Fig. 3B). A significant amount of the TSG-6 bound at 4 °C could be removed by washing at pH 4.5 (Fig. 3C). 0.5 m guanidine HCl was sufficient to remove most of the bound TSG-6, and even 250 mm guanidine HCl removed a significant part of TSG-6 bound to immobilized HA at 4 °C (Fig. 3C). Whereas TSG-6 that bound to immobilized HA at 4 °C formed a complex that was resistant to washing with TTBS, it did not withstand washing under more stringent conditions. This is in contrast to TSG-6 that bound to Cov-HA at 37 °C, which formed a stable complex that withstood the most stringent washing conditions (Fig. 3A). This result demonstrates that TSG-6 binding to HA and the formation of a stable complex are separate and most likely sequential events. At low temperature, e.g. 4 °C, the formation of a complex that is sensitive to dissociating agents is the end point of the reaction. At physiological temperature this binding reaction is followed by the transition of the initial complex into a complex that is resistant to dissociating agents. In order to investigate the roles of link module and CUB domain to the formation of the stable complex, we expressed and purified the isolated TSG-6 link module. A comparison of the stability of the complexes formed by full-length TSG-6 and TSG-6 link module at 37 °C showed that both form a complex stable to treatment with 6 m guanidine HCl containing 8% LSB at almost exactly the same ratio relative to total binding (Fig. 3D). Binding of TSG-6 to Chondroitin Sulfates—Our first study addressing the binding of TSG-6 to GAGs, using coprecipitation of GAG-TSG-6 complexes with cetyl pyridinium chloride, concluded that TSG-6 binds to HA but not to C-4,6-S or any other GAGs, with the possible exception of heparan sulfate (3Lee T.H. Wisniewski H-G. Vilcek J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). A later analysis of the binding of the isolated link module of TSG-6 to GAGs, based on the adsorptive binding of GAGs or protein to microtiter plates, demonstrated that the isolated link module, at pH 5.8, bound to HA and C-4-S with similar affinities (22Parkar A.A. Day A.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This study determined that the link module of TSG-6 did not interact with C-6-S (22Parkar A.A. Day A.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Most significantly, binding of the TSG-6 link module to HA or C-4-S at more physiological pH was not demonstrated (22Parkar A.A. Day A.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because of these intriguing data and the physiological significance of the interaction of TSG-6 with different isoforms of CS, we examined the binding of full-length TSG-6 to CSs, at the physiological pH of 7.5, using an assay based on competition between free CS and immobilized HA for the binding of TSG-6. Fig. 4A shows that C-4-S in solution competed efficiently with immobilized HA for the binding of TSG-6, comparable with HA in solution (Fig. 2D). Fig. 4, B and C, shows the same experiment with C-6-S and C-4,6-S, again demonstrating efficient competition with HA for the binding of TSG-6. An overlay of the data from these competition experiments (Fig. 4D) shows that the competition of C-4-S and C-4,6-S for the binding of TSG-6 is very similar to the competition by free HA, suggesting similar affinities of TSG-6 for HA and C-4-S or C-4,6-S. About 5-fold higher concentrations of free C-6-S were needed to achieve a 50% decrease in the binding of TSG-6 to immobilized HA (Fig. 4D), suggesting that TSG-6 binds to C-6-S with a slightly lower affinity than to either HA, C-4-S, or C-4,6-S. Nevertheless, the data clearly show that TSG-6 binds to all isoforms of CS without regard to the position of the sulfate groups and at physiological pH. In order to test the structural specificity of the binding of TSG-6, we employed a sulfated but otherwise unrelated polyglycan, dextran sulfate. In contrast to either free HA or chondroitin sulfates, dextran sulfate had little effect on the binding of TSG-6 to immobilized HA even at high concentrations (Fig. 4E). The major advantage of the competitive assay system that we employed for the analysis of TSG-6 binding to CSs is that it does not require any modification of the GAG and that it analyzes binding to CS in solution. An additional advantage is that it can easily be used to analyze the interaction between TSG-6 and other GAGs like heparan sulfate, keratan sulfate, or dermatan sulfate, for which only limited TSG-6 binding data or no data at all are currently available. Effects of pH, Ionic Strength, and Metal Ions on the Binding of TSG-6 to HA—It was reported earlier that, in contrast to other members of the hyaladherin family such as aggrecan or link protein, the link module of TSG-6 does not bind to HA at neutral pH (23Parkar A.A. Kahmann J.D. Howat S.L. Bayliss M.T. Day A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). TSG-6 link module binding to HA peaked at pH 5.5 to 6.0, and little binding was observed above pH 6.5 (23Parkar A.A. Kahmann J.D. Howat S.L. Bayliss M.T. Day A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This unique pH dependence of HA binding by TSG-6 suggested that in tissues TSG-6 would bind to HA only under inflammatory conditions associated with a lower pH and that this characteristic might contribute to the dissociation of aggrecan-link protein-HA aggregates in cartilage during inflammation (23Parkar A.A. Kahmann J.D. Howat S.L. Bayliss M.T. Day A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, several other studies have demonstrated that TSG-6 binds to HA in vivo under noninflammatory conditions (9Glant T.T. Kamath R.V. Bardos T. Gal I. Szanto S. Murad Y.M. Sandy J.D. Mort J.S. Roughley P.J. Mikecz K. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 2207-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 28Carrette O. Nemade R.V. Day A.J. Brickner A. Larsen W.J. Biol.

Thorbecke G.J. Klein M.J. Vilcek J. Wisniewski H-G. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 2668-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 7Mindrescu C. Dias A.A.M. Olszewski R.J. Klein M.J. Reis L.F.L.

Mikecz K. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 2207-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the pH dependence of binding of full-length TSG-6 to HA. Our data indicate that TSG-6 binds to immobilized HA equally well between pH 6.5 and pH 8.5, a range covering most physiological and many pathophysiological conditions (Fig. 5, A and B). Decreased HA-specific binding of TSG-6 was observed at and below pH 5.5, whereas nonspecific, HA-independent binding was increased at pH 4.5 (Fig. 5A). If not indicated otherwise, all TSG-6 binding experiments were carried out in the presence of 500 mm NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20, i.e. under conditions that can be considered more stringent than physiological conditions. If the binding reaction was carried out in PBS, followed by washing with PBS, nonspecific, HA-independent binding of TSG-6 was considerably increased, and the binding of TSG-6 to HA was increased accordingly (Fig. 5C). The addition of EDTA did not prevent the binding of TSG-6 to HA, although it decreased the binding of TSG-6 to Cov-HA by about 20% (Fig. 5D). This finding is surprising insofar as no metal ion-binding site has been identified on the link module or the CUB domain. Binding of BW 5147 Cells to Immobilized HA—The thymoma cell line BW 5147 ha"
https://openalex.org/W2015966309,"CD44 is an adhesion molecule in the extracellular matrix that shows various functions, including tumor genesis and metastasis. A recent study showed that CD44 expression level was strongly correlated with the generation of papillary thyroid carcinomas, the most prevalent malignancy of the thyroid gland. We report here that CD44 is negatively regulated by thyroid hormone (T3) through a novel mechanism. We demonstrate that nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) enhances thyroid hormone receptor (TR)-mediated basal transactivation by a weak TR·DNA interaction in the absence of T3, which is repressed by T3 through a transient TR ·DNA interaction. Initially, we identified that CD44 was negatively directly transcriptionally T3 -responsive. Deletion and mutation analysis indicated that both a weak TR and a GAGA-binding factor (GAF) binding sites on the CD44 promoter were required for negative regulation by T3. The weak TR·DNA interaction was further confirmed by electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and transfection assays using a non-DNA-binding TRα1 mutant. More interestingly, NCoR acted as a co-activator to enhance TR-mediated basal transactivation in the absence of T3. This effect was eliminated by removal of TR or NCoR binding. Most strikingly, T3 induced a remarkable increase in TR·DNA binding at 40–60 min after T3 exposure that rapidly returned to basal levels, suggesting a T3-induced remodeling of chromatin structure at the early stage of T3 stimulation resulting in repression. Therefore, we propose a mechanism by which NCoR, GAF, and TR interact with the CD44 negative T3-responsive element to enhance basal transactivation, whereas T3 induces the remodeling of chromatin structure for repression.

Thyroid hormone affects important biological functions such as growth, development, and metabolism.

The P-box of the zinc fingers within the DBD of TR recognizes the AGGTCA sequence of the thyroid hormoneresponsive element (TRE), which is diversely arranged in direct repeat (DR+4), palindrome, and inverted palindrome forms (1Brent G.A.

On the other hand, T3 binding to TR induces conformational changes in TR to release co-repressors and recruit co-activators such as CBP/p300, pCAF, and SRC-1 for transactivation (3Lazar M.A. Endocr.

Thus, although the mechanism of transcriptional regulation for the positive TRE (pTRE) is relatively well studied, T3-dependent negative gene regulation is still poorly understood and is limited to a few genes. It has not been possible to identify a consensus sequence of negative TRE (nTRE).Recently, Wondisford and colleagues (9Shibusawa N. Hashimoto K. Nikrodhanond A.A. Liberman M.C. Applebury M.L. Liao X.H. Robbins J.T. Refetoff S. Cohen R.N. Wondisford F.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) provided evidence that direct binding of hTRβ2 to nTRE is required for T3-dependent negative regulation. This group generated a non-TRE binding hTRβ2 mutant (TRβ2-GS125) in which two amino acids (EG at 125 and 126 in the zinc finger region of DBD of TRβ2) were mutated to GS, preventing recognition of the TRE sequence. When TRβ2-GS125 was transfected into 293T cells, T3-dependent negative regulation of the hTSHβ gene was abolished (9Shibusawa N. Hashimoto K. Nikrodhanond A.A. Liberman M.C. Applebury M.L. Liao X.H. Robbins J.T. Refetoff S. Cohen R.N. Wondisford F.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Wondisford et al. showed that TRβ2 bound to the TRE sequence in the hTSHβ fragment elicited a negative response to T3. The physiological significance of TR·DNA binding was further confirmed by the finding that TRβ2-GS125 knock-in homozygous mutant (TRβGS/GS) mice displayed abnormal T3 regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary thyroid axis and retina, identical to abnormalities previously observed in TRβ KO (TRβ–/–) mice, although TRβGS/GS mutant mice showed much less severe defects in hearing and outer hair cell loss than do TRβ–/–mice (9Shibusawa N.

However, no nTRE consensus sequence distinct from pTRE was clearly identified, raising the possibility of a novel nTRE different in sequence from these positively regulated genes.On the other hand, there are also data that T3-dependent negative regulation can occur without direct TR·DNA interaction. Kushner and colleagues (21Lopez G. Schaufele F. Webb P. Holloway J.M. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3042-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 22Lazar M.A. J. Clin.

Another recent study from our group indicated that JEG-3 cell-specific transcription factor-DNA binding induced T3-dependent negative regulation without direct TR·DNA binding (23Kim S.W. Hong S.J. Min Kim K. Ho S.C. So E.C. Harney J.W. Reed Larsen P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; Google Scholar). Jameson and colleagues indicated that TSHα gene expression might be negatively regulated by T3 through a squelching mechanism (24Tagami T. Madison L.D. Nagaya T. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell.

This model proposed that, in the absence of T3, unliganded TR bound to co-repressors, forming a complex that was subsequently sequestered from the promoter region, resulting in increased histone acetylation and transactivation through the recruitment of more co-activators to the promoter. However, in the presence of T3, T3-TR formed a complex with co-activators such as CBP/p300 that was segregated from the TSHβ promoter, giving co-repressors NCoR/SMRT and histone deacetylases easy access to the promoter region for histone deacetylation and repression (25Tagami T. Park Y. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22345-22353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). When NCoR or SMRT was overexpressed in the presence of TRH and TSHα and -β promoter-Luc, TR-mediated basal transactivation of these promoters was enhanced by TR·NCoR interaction (9Shibusawa N. Hashimoto K. Nikrodhanond A.A. Liberman M.C. Applebury M.L. Liao X.H. Robbins J.T. Refetoff S. Cohen R.N. Wondisford F.E. J. Clin.

Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22345-22353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, this model did not explain how the specificity of negative regulation is conferred. Thus, the question of whether TR·DNA interaction with the negatively regulated genes is essential for T3-dependent negative regulation is still not resolved.We approached this problem by screening the rat genome for other genes whose expression is suppressed by T3. We determined that CD44 is negatively responsive to T3 at a directly transcriptional level in various tissues and cell types. CD44 is a cell adhesion molecule involved in diverse biological processes, including angiogenesis, lymphogenesis, wound healing, inflammation, and cancer metastasis (26Castellone M.D. Celetti A. Guarino V. Cirafici A.M. Basolo F. Giannini R. Medico E. Kruhoffer M. Orntoft T.F. Curcio F. Fusco A. Melillo R.M. Santoro M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2188-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate that CD44 plays an important role in generation of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), the most prevalent malignancy of the thyroid gland. Some PTCs are thought to be initiated by the RET/PTC chimeric oncogene, which is generated by rearrangements of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase (26Castellone M.D. Celetti A. Guarino V. Cirafici A.M. Basolo F. Giannini R. Medico E. Kruhoffer M. Orntoft T.F. Curcio F. Fusco A. Melillo R.M. Santoro M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2188-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). RET/PTC signaling induces up-regulation of osteopontin and CD44, resulting in proliferation and invasion of transformed PC Cl 3 thyrocytes (26Castellone M.D. Celetti A. Guarino V. Cirafici A.M. Basolo F. Giannini R. Medico E. Kruhoffer M. Orntoft T.F. Curcio F. Fusco A. Melillo R.M. Santoro M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2188-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Another interesting and relevant finding is that Alzheimer's disease-associated γ-secretase cleaves CD44, generating intracellular domains for nuclear signaling and CD44 β-peptides, whose functions are unknown. This cleavage pattern is similar to that of β-amyloid precursor protein by the γ-secretase, which produces an amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain for nuclear signaling and an amyloid β-peptide for β-amyloid plaque formation (27Lammich S. Okochi M. Takeda M. Kaether C. Capell A. Zimmer A.K. Edbauer D. Walter J. Steiner H. Haass C. J. Biol.

All of these results suggest a correlation between regulation of CD44 expression and progress of these diseases.Here we provide evidence that, during negative regulation by T3, TR binds weakly but directly to a novel CD44 nTRE different from the pTRE. In addition, we identified two proteins (GAF and NCoR) required for T3-dependent negative regulation of CD44 gene expression. Of special note, cooperative interaction among TR, NCoR, and GAF was essential for enhanced unliganded TR-mediated basal expression, whereas repression was induced by T3 through a transient, but strong in vivo TR·DNA interaction, probably also bringing about remodeling of the chromatin structure. These results suggest a novel mechanism for T3-dependent negative regulation.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Cells were cultured as described previously (23Kim S.W. Hong S.J. Min Kim K. Ho S.C. So E.C. Harney J.W. Reed Larsen P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; Google Scholar, 37Kim S.W. Ahn I.M. Larsen P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4465-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7, JEG-3, and HeLa cells were maintained in Ham's F-10 media containing 14 mm sodium bicarbonate (pH 7.4) and 2 mml-glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) until cells were 70–80% confluent (29Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). For stimulation with T3, culture medium was removed, the cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and Ham's F-10 medium containing charcoal-stripped 10% fetal bovine serum was added. The medium was changed after 1 day, and incubation continued for another 2 days. T3 (50 nm) was diluted in Ham's F-10 medium, and charcoal-stripped 10% fetal bovine serum was added to cells for the times indicated in figure legends.Plasmid Constructions and Mutagenesis—Standard techniques were used for all plasmid constructions, as described previously. A 5-kb 5′-FR genomic fragment, PCR-amplified 0.1- to 1.8-kb DNA fragments of 5′-FR, or synthesized double-stranded oligonucleotides were subcloned into KpnI and XhoI restriction sites of the pGL3-basic luciferase-expressing reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). A 177-bp CD44 promoter in pGL3BS-Luc (177-bp CD44-Luc) was mutated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as indicated in figure legends. To generate a non-TRE binding GS71 sequence as already described in JEG-3 cells (23Kim S.W. Hong S.J. Min Kim K. Ho S.C. So E.C. Harney J.W. Reed Larsen P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; Google Scholar), mTRα1 cDNA was inserted in a CDM expression vector in which two bases from TSS of the mTRa1 cDNA were mutated: 614 (A to G) and at 616 (G to A). All constructs were confirmed by automated sequencing.Constructs for siRNA expression were generated by cloning hairpin siRNA sequences into pSilencer2 vectors (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Target sequences for the expressed siRNA were 814–834 (5′-AAAGGAGTGATTCTCGATCAC-3′) for NCoR, 377–398 (5′-AACCAGAACGGCGCCGAAGGC-3′) for GAF, 343–361 (5′-GGTTATGTACAGGAACGCA-3′) for GFP, and 5′-AAGATCGATCGATCGATCGAT-3′ for random sequence siRNA. All sequences of cloned constructs were also confirmed by automated sequencing.Transfection and Luciferase (Luc) Assay—Transfections were performed as previously described (23Kim S.W. Hong S.J. Min Kim K. Ho S.C. So E.C. Harney J.W. Reed Larsen P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; Google Scholar) with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) in COS-7 cells. Each plate was transfected with 2 μg of Luciferase reporter plasmids and 0.5 μg of TKGH, which constitutively expresses human growth hormone (hGH), as a control for transfection efficiency. 0.1 μg of CDM8 vector expressing mouse TRα1 (wild-type or mutant) or pCDNA3 vector expressing NCoR were transfected with and without 0.1–0.3 μg of pSilencer 2.1-U6 neo (Ambion) expressing siRNAs of NCoR and GAF, as described in the figure legends. CDM8 and pCDNA3 empty vectors or GFP and random oligonucleotide siRNA-expressing vectors were used as controls. After transfection, cells were incubated in 60-mm culture dishes in the absence of thyroid hormone for 2 days and then exposed to 50 nm T3 for 0–24 h at 37 °C. A luciferase assay was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega) and was normalized to hGH expression in the absence and presence of T3 to calculate T3 responsiveness. Transfection data are mean ± S.D. of a minimum of triplicate samples.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—EMSA was performed as described previously (23Kim S.W. Hong S.J. Min Kim K. Ho S.C. So E.C. Harney J.W. Reed Larsen P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides of wild-type and mutant CD44 nTRE were radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by fill-in reaction using Klenow DNA polymerase, which was subsequently gel-purified (23Kim S.W. Hong S.J. Min Kim K. Ho S.C. So E.C. Harney J.W. Reed Larsen P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; Google Scholar). Chicken TRα1 and human retinoid X receptor α were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (23Kim S.W. Hong S.J. Min Kim K. Ho S.C. So E.C. Harney J.W. Reed Larsen P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; Google Scholar). Radiolabeled probes were reacted with bacterially expressed cTRα and/or human retinoid X receptor and resolved by non-denaturing PAGE.Methylation Interference Assay—Dimethyl sulfate methylation interference assay was performed using a standard protocol as described previously (23Kim S.W. Hong S.J. Min Kim K. Ho S.C. So E.C. Harney J.W. Reed Larsen P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; Google Scholar).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—ChIP assay was performed according to manufacturer's protocol (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) (38Sharma D. Fondell J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7934-7939Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 39Ishizuka T. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5122-5131Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Briefly, 177-bp wild-type (177-bp CD-Luc) and mutant (177-bp CD-Dbl-Luc) constructs were co-transfected with TR and/or NCoR expression vectors into COS-7 cells and incubated in the presence or absence of 50 nm T3 for 0–24 h as represented in Fig. 8. Cells were cross-linked by 1% formaldehyde for 10 min and harvested in the presence of protease inhibitor (EDTA-free Complete, Roche Applied Science). These cells were then lysed and sonicated to generate 200- to 500-bp DNA fragments, which were subsequently confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. TR and NCoR binding fragments were immunoprecipitated using rabbit polyclonal anti-TR and goat polyclonal anti-NCoR antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). As a control, immunoglobulin G (IgG) was used to determine the background level. Nonspecific interaction was minimized by thorough washing. Specifically bound DNA fragments were purified and quantified by real-time PCR using specific primers. The sense primer was pGL3P-4952S1 (pGL3 Promoter-Luc vector, –4952 to –4971: 5′-CTAGCAAAATAGGCTGTCCC-3′), and the antisense primer was 31CD described in Fig. 8 (CD44, –31 to –51: 5′-CCAGGCTTTGAAAGAGTGACC-3′).Miscellaneous—All chemicals were of reagent grade and obtained from commercial sources. Rat tissues were obtained under a protocol approved by the Brigham and Women's Hospital animal care and use committee and in compliance with National Institutes of Health guidelines.RESULTSThe CD44 Gene Is Negatively Responsive to T3 at a Transcriptional Level—To study the general mechanism of regulation of negatively T3-responsive genes, we performed screens to identify genes directly and transcriptionally negatively regulated by T3. First, we identified a group of negatively T3-responsive genes using mRNA from T3-deprived pituitary tumor (GC) cells grown in medium containing thyroid hormone-free serum (hypothyroid) and serum supplemented with normal (euthyroid) or excessive quantities of T3 (hyperthyroid). T3-dependent mRNA expression was examined for 7000 known genes using the Affymetrix GeneChip (Rat Genome U34A), in which the most abundantly expressed genes were primarily selected and confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Cyclophilin was used as an internal control for normalization of mRNA expression. Amplified DNA was quantitated using the standard curve generated with serially diluted DNA after triplicate PCR as described under “Materials and Methods.”The eight genes identified as strongly negatively regulated by T3 were tested to determine whether they are transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally regulated by T3. To identify which of the cDNAs were transcriptionally regulated by T3,2 μm actinomycin D was used to block transcription, and the half-life of the mRNA was measured in the presence and absence of T3. Genes that showed no changes in mRNA half-life by T3 and actinomycin D exposure were categorized as transcriptionally regulated (data not shown). To identify those directly responsive to T3, 30 μm cycloheximide was added to hypothyroid GC cells 1 h prior to T3 treatment. Cells were taken for RNA isolation after 0, 3, and 6 h of exposure to T3, and the changes in the specific RNAs were compared with control cells not exposed to cycloheximide. Genes that showed no changes in mRNA level by T3 and cycloheximide exposure were categorized as directly responsive to T3 (data not shown). Four genes met both criteria.To identify which of these four genes was negatively regulated by T3 in a general, as opposed to a tissue-specific fashion we examined mRNA of nine tissues from hypothyroid, euthyroid, and hyperthyroid (4-h and 24-h T3-treated) rats. These included blood, lung, anterior pituitary (AP), large intestine (L. Int.), stomach (STM), kidney, liver, heart, and hypothalamus (HPT) (Fig. 1). Serum T4 and T3 measurements were also performed to confirm the thyroid status of these animals. Examination of T3-dependent mRNA expression of the four genes in these tissues by quantitative real-time PCR showed that two were generally negatively regulated, whereas the other two were negatively regulated in a tissue-specific manner (data not shown). Because the CD44 gene was negatively regulated in most tissues (Fig. 1), it was selected as a model gene with which to study the T3-dependent negative regulation mechanism.Fig. 1T3-dependent negative regulation of CD44 mRNA in various tissues of rats. CD44 mRNAs were obtained from tissues of hypothyroid, euthyroid, and hyperthyroid rats (treated with T3 for 4 and 24 h) and evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR normalized to rat cyclophilin mRNA.

https://openalex.org/W1992007773,"UDP-galactose 4′-epimerase (GALE) catalyzes the final step in the Leloir pathway of galactose metabolism, interconverting UDP-galactose and UDP-glucose. Unlike its Escherichia coli counterpart, mammalian GALE also interconverts UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. Considering the key roles played by all four of these UDP-sugars in glycosylation, human GALE therefore not only contributes to the Leloir pathway, but also functions as a gatekeeper overseeing the ratios of important substrate pools required for the synthesis of glycosylated macromolecules. Defects in human GALE result in the disorder epimerase-deficiency galactosemia. To explore the relationship among GALE activity, substrate specificity, metabolic balance, and galactose sensitivity in mammalian cells, we employed a previously described GALE-null line of Chinese hamster ovary cells, ldlD. Using a transfection protocol, we generated ldlD derivative cell lines that expressed different levels of wild-type human GALE or E. coli GALE and compared the phenotypes and metabolic profiles of these lines cultured in the presence versus absence of galactose. We found that GALE-null cells accumulated abnormally high levels of Gal-1-P and UDP-Gal and abnormally low levels of UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcNAc in the presence of galactose and that human GALE expression corrected each of these defects. Comparing the human GALE- and E. coli GALE-expressing cells, we found that although GALE activity toward both substrates was required to restore metabolic balance, UDP-GalNAc activity was not required for cell proliferation in the presence of otherwise cytostatic concentrations of galactose. Finally, we found that uridine supplementation, which essentially corrected UDP-Glc and, to a lesser extent UDP-GlcNAc depletion, enabled ldlD cells to proliferate in the presence of galactose despite the continued accumulation of Gal-1-P and UDP-Gal. These data offer important insights into the mechanism of galactose sensitivity in epimerase-impaired cells and suggest a potential novel therapy for patients with epimerase-deficiency galactosemia.

GALE therefore not only catalyzes an essential step in the Leloir pathway, but also serves as a gatekeeper overseeing the ratios of key substrate pools required for the synthesis of glycogen, glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, glycoproteins, and glycolipids in mammals. Defects in human GALE (hGALE) result in the inherited metabolic disorder epimerase-deficiency galactosemia (OMIM 230350) (7.Holton J.B. Walter J.H. Tyfield L.A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly S.W.

Although the basis for this biochemical and clinical spectrum of epimerase deficiency remains unknown, studies of patient GALE sequences have demonstrated significant variability (11.Quimby B.B.

Nonetheless, the precise role of human GALE in mediating both galactose metabolism and the pathophysiology of galactose sensitivity in epimerase deficiency remains unclear. As one approach toward addressing this question, both we and others have developed and applied yeast model systems in which GALE (GAL10) is either deleted or impaired (11.Quimby B.B. Alano A.

GALE-deficient yeast are not only unable to grow on media containing galactose as the sole carbon source; they also fail to grow on media containing alternate carbon sources, such as glycerol/ethanol or raffinose, if even trace amounts of galactose are added (e.g. 0.0025%) (19.Ross K.L. Davis C.N. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Mol. Gen. Metab. 2004; 83: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that GALE-null yeast are not only Gal– or unable to metabolize galactose fully, they are also galactose-sensitive (15.Wohlers T. Fridovich-Keil J.L. J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 2000; 23: 713-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18.Douglas H.C. Hawthorne D.C. Genetics. 1964; 49: 837-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Ross K.L. Davis C.N. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Mol. Gen. Metab. 2004; 83: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Prior and ongoing studies have helped to identify potential factors mediating galactose sensitivity in GALE-null yeast (15.Wohlers T. Fridovich-Keil J.L. J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 2000; 23: 713-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18.Douglas H.C. Hawthorne D.C. Genetics. 1964; 49: 837-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Ross K.L. Davis C.N. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Mol. Gen. Metab. 2004; 83: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); nonetheless, how these results relate to galactose metabolism and sensitivity in GALE-deficient mammalian cells has remained unknown. With the experiments presented here we have begun to address the mechanism of galactose sensitivity in GALE-impaired mammalian cells utilizing a strain of Chinese hamster ovary cells called ldlD. ldlD cells were originally isolated more than 20 years ago on the basis of impaired low density lipoprotein receptor function (20.Krieger M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 150: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), a phenotype later revealed as secondary to a complete absence of GALE activity, which resulted in the aberrant processing of both N- and O-linked glycoproteins, including the low density lipoprotein receptor (21.Kingsley D. Kozarsky K.F. Hobbie L. Krieger M. Cell. 1986; 44: 749-759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). It is important to note that although ldlD cells are viable in standard glucose-containing media despite their lack of GALE, no other truly GALE-null mammalian cells have been reported. In particular, cells derived from even the most severely affected epimerase-deficient patients are not fully GALE-null (14.Wohlers T.M. Christacos N.C. Harreman M.T. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Am. J. Hum. Gen. 1999; 64: 462-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15.Wohlers T. Fridovich-Keil J.L. J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 2000; 23: 713-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22.Kingsley D.M. Krieger M. Holton J.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 314: 1257-1258PubMed Google Scholar). This observation stands in stark contrast to transferase deficiency, in which patients demonstrating no detectable activity, and even large genomic deletions, have been reported (23.Berry G.T. Leslie N. Reynolds R. Yager C.T. Segal S. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 72: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although viable, ldlD cells clearly exist in a precarious balance. Because of their lack of GALE, they cannot synthesize endogenous galactose or GalNAc and therefore depend on exogenous sources of these sugars for normal glycosylation (21.Kingsley D. Kozarsky K.F. Hobbie L. Krieger M. Cell. 1986; 44: 749-759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). These same cells, however, exhibit impaired growth when exposed to greater than 0.125 mm galactose (24.Krieger M. Reddy P. Kozarsky K. Kingsley D. Hobbie L. Penman M. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 57-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The mechanism behind this impaired growth phenotype has remained unclear and is addressed in part by the experiments presented here. In particular, we have asked three questions: 1) What are the metabolic changes associated with galactose sensitivity in ldlD cells? 2) How much hGALE activity is required to relieve the apparent galactose sensitivity of ldlD cells? 3) What is the relationship among GALE substrate specificity, metabolic imbalance, and galactose sensitivity in ldlD-derived cells? To address these questions, we first characterized both ldlD and wild-type CHO cells cultured in the presence or absence of 0.25 mm galactose. As expected, we observed a number of galactose-specific abnormalities in the ldlD cells, including impaired cell growth, elevated Gal-1-P and UDP-Gal, and depressed UDP-Glc, UDP-GlcNAc, and UDP-GalNAc. To define the level of wild-type human GALE activity required to complement the ldlD cell growth impairment and metabolic abnormalities, we generated transfectants stably expressing either low (5–10%) or near normal levels of hGALE activity. The near normal hGALE-expressing cells (ldlD[hGALE-wt]) demonstrated full complementation of some abnormalities, including the growth, Gal-1-P, and UDP-Gal phenotypes and significant complementation of others, including the UDP-Glc, UDP-GlcNAc, and UDP-GalNAc phenotypes. In contrast, the 5–10% hGALE-expressing cells (ldlD[hGALE-low]) exhibited only marginal complementation of each of these abnormalities. To probe the role of GALE substrate specificity in galactose sensitivity, we generated ldlD transfectants expressing E. coli GALE, which completely lacks UDP-GalNAc activity. As expected, both galactose consumption and internal metabolite levels, including Gal-1-P, UDP-Gal, UDP-Glc, and UDP-GlcNAc, were complemented as well in these ldlD[eGALE] cells as in the ldlD[hGALE-wt] cells, although UDP-GalNAc remained undetectable. Nonetheless, the ldlD[eGALE] cells grew as well in the presence of 0.25 mm galactose as did their hGALE-expressing counterparts, demonstrating that the apparent growth impairment of GALE-null cells exposed to galactose was independent of UDP-GalNAc deficiency and therefore likely independent of O-linked glycosylation defects. Finally, as a first step toward addressing the issue of mechanism, we tested the impact of nucleoside supplementation and found that uridine alone was sufficient to relieve the galactose-specific growth impairment of ldlD cells. It is particularly interesting to note that although uridine supplementation did correct the UDP-Glc and, to a lesser extent, UDP-GlcNAc depletion of galactose-exposed ldlD cells, both the Gal-1-P and UDP-Gal levels in these cells remained abnormally high. These results suggest that it is not the dramatic accumulation of Gal-1-P or UDP-Gal, but rather the depletion of uridine that is cytostatic to ldlD cells exposed to galactose. Combined, these results provide a first step toward understanding the mechanism of galactose sensitivity in GALE-impaired mammalian cells and suggest a potential novel therapy for epimerase-deficiency galactosemia. Plasmids—HA-tagged forms of both the human GALE (hGALE, JF4169-4170) and E. coli GALE (eGALE, JF4387) enzymes were expressed in ldlD cells using a derivative of the pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) vector in which the cytomegalovirus promoter had been removed and replaced with the mouse galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (mGALT) promoter. The mGALT promoter sequence (25.Leslie N. Bai S. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 72: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) was generated through PCR amplification of wild-type mouse genomic DNA (kind gift from Dr. David Weinshenker, Emory University) using the following primers, which contained the restriction sites MluI and HindIII for ease of subcloning: mGALTproMluIf1, 5′-CGCGACGCGTATCCGTGGCGGGACGAATGGACACAGCAAC-3′; and mGALTproHindIIIr1, 5′-CGCGAAGCTTATCGGCTCCGCTATGCGACGTGAGGCC-3′. The wild-type E. coli GALE sequence was obtained via PCR amplification from genomic E. coli DNA using the following primers, which engineered an HA tag onto the 3′-end of the open reading frame: eGALEf2, 5′-GCGCGAATTCCCAAGGTGCCATGAGAGTTCTGGTTACCGGTGG-3′; and eGALEHAr1, 5′-GCGCTCGAGTCAAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTAATCGGGATATCCCTGTGGATG-3′. All amplified, subcloned alleles were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Cell Culture and Generation of Transfected Cell Lines—All mammalian cell lines used in these studies are listed in Table I. The control cell line, CHO-K1 (kind gift from Dr. Curt Hagedorn, Emory University), and mutant ldlD cell line were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium containing glutamine and 10 mm glucose (Cellgro) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen). All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator (NuAire) and harvested for splitting or analysis by standard protocols using trypsin/EDTA.Table IEnzyme activities in ldlD cells stably expressing human GALE (hGALE) or E. coli GALE (eGALE)Strain (comments)GALE activity (UDP-Gal)GALE activity (UDP-GalNAc)pmol / μg / minpmol / μg / minCHO-K1 (wild-type GALE)2.08 ± 0.212.27 ± 0.54ldlD (GALE-null, from CHO-K1)UndetectableUndetectableJFm342 (ldlD[hGALE-wt])1.64 ± 0.132.54 ± 0.49JFm348 (ldlD[hGALE-low])0.10 ± 0.050.28 ± 0.03JFm361 (ldlD[eGALE])0.82 ± 0.06Undetectable Open table in a new tab Cells were transfected in 6-well dishes using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 24 h after transfection, cultures were trypsinized and replated at >1:10 dilution into Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. G418 selection was initiated 24 h later by the addition of appropriate levels of drug (200 μg/ml G418, Cellgro). After ∼14 days of drug selection, individual clones were isolated by trypsinization within cloning rings and purified by further subculture in medium containing G418. Expression of GALE in each clone was confirmed by Western blot analysis against the HA tag and by GALE activity assays. Clonal lines of transfectants were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium containing glutamine and 10 mm glucose, supplemented with 10% FBS and 200 μg/ml G418. Generation of Lipoprotein-deficient Serum (LPDS)—Newborn calf LPDS was prepared according to methods described by Goldstein et al. (26.Goldstein J. Basu S. Brown M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar) and modified by Krieger (27.Krieger M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole newborn calf serum (Invitrogen) was adjusted to a final density of 1.215 g/ml with solid KBr (Sigma). The serum was separated by ultracentrifugation at 59,000 rpm for 36 h at 4 °C in a Beckman 70 Ti rotor. The top, lipoprotein-rich fraction was removed through aspiration. The lipoprotein-deficient fraction was then subjected to five sequential rounds of dialysis against a total of 30 liters of 150 mm NaCl over 72 h at 4 °C. The thoroughly dialyzed LPDS was then sterilized by filtration (0.45 μ Millipore) and adjusted to a protein concentration of 60 mg/ml by dilution with sterile 150 mm NaCl. Cell Viability Assays—ldlD and wild-type CHO cells were plated in triplicate into Ham's F-12 medium containing glutamine, 10 mm glucose, and 2% LPDS. After cells reached 90% confluence (48 h), the medium was removed and replaced by fresh medium either with or without 0.25 mm galactose. After 72 h, cells were harvested and tested for viability by exclusion of the vital stain, trypan blue (Sigma), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a 0.2-ml cell suspension in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was added to 0.5 ml of 0.4% trypan blue and 0.3 ml of PBS. The suspension was incubated for 5 min before microscopic examination, in which both stained and unstained cells were counted using a hemacytometer. A minimum of 100 cells were counted. Uridine Rescue—ldlD cells were plated into the wells of a 24-well plate at 10,000 cells/well in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10 mm glucose and supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 3% LPDS. After 1 day of culture the medium from each well was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing 0, 0.125, or 0.25 mm galactose with or without the addition of 100 μm uridine, thymidine, guanosine, adenosine, or cytidine. After an additional 5 days of culture, monolayers were fixed and stained with crystal violet, as described previously (28.Krieger M. Cell. 1983; 33: 413-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Metabolite studies on ldlD cells grown in the presence and absence of 100 μm uridine were performed as described below. Preparation of Protein Lysates and Enzyme Assays—Proteins were extracted by repeated freeze/thaw in 100 mm glycine buffer containing protease inhibitors (0.3 mm aprotinin, 0.63 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 mm antipain, 1 mm phosphoramidon, 0.2 μg/ml chymostatin, 8 mm E64, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.50 μg/ml leupeptin). Crude protein extracts were fractionated over P-30 Bio-Spin columns (Bio-Rad) to remove small metabolites prior to further analysis. Protein determinations were made using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, as recommended by the manufacturer, and quantified using a standard curve of bovine serum albumin. Individual Leloir pathway enzyme activities were measured using standard enzymatic assay procedures with quantification of reactants and products by HPLC. In brief, all enzymatic reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min, essentially as described previously (19.Ross K.L. Davis C.N. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Mol. Gen. Metab. 2004; 83: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with appropriate levels of protein included to remain within the linear range of the assay. Enzyme activity in each assay is defined as pmol of product formed per μg of protein/min. The following mobile phase buffers were used for separation of carbohydrate substrates and products: Buffer A, 15 mm NaOH; Buffer B, 50 mm NaOH, 1 m sodium acetate; and Buffer C, 15 mm NaOH, 1 mm Na2B4O7·10H2O. The following procedures were used for HPLC separation and quantification of enzymatic substrates and products. For galactokinase: 98% A and 2% B (–5 to 3 min), a linear increase of B to 25% (3 to 25 min), hold at 75% A and 25% B (25 to 27 min), and a linear decrease of B to 2% (27 to 30 min). For GALT: 85% A and 15% B (–10 to 5 min), a linear increase of B to 25% (5 to 10 min), a linear increase of B to 70% (10 to 15 min), hold at 30% A and 70% B (15 to 30 min), and a linear decrease of B to 15% (30 to 32 min). For GALE, UDP-Gal: 35% C and 65% B for 20 min. For GALE, UDP-GalNAc: 45% C and 55% B for 30 min. The flow rate was maintained at 1 ml/min for all separation procedures. BrdUrd Incorporation Assay—The colorimetric Cell Proliferation ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science), which monitors incorporation of BrdUrd into newly synthesized DNA, was used according to the manufacturer's recommendations to quantify the proliferation of cells grown in the presence versus absence of galactose. Briefly, cells were plated at 100 cells/200 μl of medium into each well of a 96-well plate, using medium containing 2% LPDS, and grown for 72 h. As described under “Results,” some wells also contained small amounts of galactose or mannose. At the end of the 72-h growth period, cells were exposed to BrdUrd for 8 h and then fixed for 30 min with the provided solution. Next, cells were incubated for 1.5 h with a monoclonal peroxidase-labeled antibody directed against BrdUrd, provided by the manufacturer. After removal, cells were washed three times with 200 μl of 1× washing solution. Finally, the substrate was allowed to develop for 10 min before 1 m H2SO4 was added to stop the reaction. The plate was incubated for 30 s on low shake in an EL 808 Ultra Microplate Reader (Bio-tek Instruments) before absorbance was read at 450 nm (reference wavelength, 690 nm). In all cases, background was defined as BrdUrd signal detected in wells on the plate that did not contain cells. Metabolite Analysis—Cultures were split 1:6 from confluent 10-cm plates into normal growth medium. After reaching confluence, cells were collected, washed once with sterile PBS, and divided equally into 26 plates of medium containing 2% LPDS. After reaching >90% confluence (∼48 h), the growth medium was removed. Two plates of cells were harvested at this step and used to determine metabolites at a 0 time point. The remaining plates were fed with fresh medium supplemented with 2% LPDS ± 0.25 mm galactose. Duplicate plates were then harvested using trypsin/EDTA at the time points specified in each figure. A 250-μl sample of medium from each plate was also collected at each time point for analysis of external galactose consumption. Trypsinized cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,500 rpm for 5 min, after which the supernatant was aspirated, and the cells were washed once with 5 ml of cold PBS before further manipulation. Analysis of Internal Metabolites—Metabolite samples from cells were prepared using a modified form of the procedure originally described by Smits et al. (29.Smits H.P. Cohen A. Buttler T. Nielsen J. Olsson L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In brief, each cell pellet was resuspended in 11 ml of cold PBS, of which 1 ml was used for protein determination via the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay, as recommended by the manufacturer. The remaining 10 ml of cell suspension was quenched in 20 ml of 60% MeOH (–20 °C), after which cells were collected by 20-min centrifugation at 2,000 rpm, 4 °C in an Eppendorf 5810R centrifuge. Intracellular metabolites were extracted by vigorous agitation for 45 min at 4 °C in a 4:2:1 mixture of CHCl3/MeOH/water, with a final volume of 875 μl. The aqueous layer was collected after high speed centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C. The remaining organic phase was extracted a second time with 125 μl of MeOH and 125 μl of water. Aqueous layers were combined and dried under vacuum without heat (∼10 h). Finally, dried metabolites were rehydrated with sterile Milli-Q water to a concentration corresponding to 1.5–2.75 μg of protein/μl, using protein values determined in parallel samples as described above. Rehydrated samples were filtered through 0.2-μm nylon filters (Alltech) before HPLC fractionation. Analysis of External Galactose Consumption—Each 250-μl sample of culture medium was added directly into 500 μl of 60% MeOH (–20 °C). External metabolites were extracted as described above from a 375-μl fraction of the medium/MeOH mixture. After drying, metabolite pellets were rehydrated in 390 μl of sterile Milli-Q water and filtered before HPLC fractionation. Small Metabolite Analysis by HPLC—HPLC analysis was performed using a DX600 HPLC system (Dionex) consisting of a Dionex AS50 autosampler, a Dionex GP50 gradient pump, and a Dionex ED50 electrochemical detector, as described previously (19.Ross K.L. Davis C.N. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Mol. Gen. Metab. 2004; 83: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In brief, carbohydrates were separated on a CarboPac PA10 column (250 × 4 mm) with an amino trap (50 × 4 mm) placed before the analysis column and a borate trap (50 × 4 mm) placed before the injector port to remove trace amounts of borate f"
https://openalex.org/W2052430651,"Vitellogenins (Vtg) are ancient lipid transport and storage proteins and members of the large lipid transfer protein (LLTP) gene family, which includes insect apolipophorin II/I, apolipoprotein B (apoB), and the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). Lipidation of Vtg occurs at its site of synthesis in vertebrate liver, insect fat body, and nematode intestine; however, the mechanism of Vtg lipid acquisition is unknown. To explore whether Vtg biogenesis requires the apoB cofactor and LLTP family member, MTP, Vtg was expressed in COS cells with and without coexpression of the 97-kDa subunit of human MTP. Expression of Vtg alone gave rise to a ∼220-kDa apoprotein, which was predominantly confined to an intracellular location. Coexpression of Vtg with human MTP enhanced Vtg secretion by 5-fold, without dramatically affecting its intracellular stability. A comparison of wild type and a triglyceride transfer-defective form of MTP revealed that both were capable of promoting Vtg secretion, whereas only wild type MTP could promote the secretion of apoB41 (amino-terminal 41% of apoB). These studies demonstrate that the biogenesis of Vtg is MTP-dependent and that MTP is the likely ancestral member of the LLTP gene family.

As Vtg exists in species whose last common ancestor diverged over 550 million years ago, they may have played a pivotal role in the evolutionary development of hepatic and intestinal lipid transport pathways observed in present day vertebrates (1.Byrne B.M. Gruber M. AB G. Prog. Biophys. Molec. Biol. 1989; 53: 33-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 2.Mann C.J. Anderson T.A. Read J. Chester S.A. Harrison G.B. Köchl S. Ritchie P.J. Bradbury P.

Indeed, in recent years it has become apparent that Vtgs are members of a larger gene family termed the large lipid transfer proteins (LLTP). Members of this family include Vtg, insect apolipophorin II/I, apolipoprotein B (apoB), and the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) (3.Babin P.J. Bogerd J. Kooiman F.P.

Although these proteins are homologous, they perform rather distinct functions, suggesting that they are paralogs rather than orthologs. Lamprey lipovitellin, the processed form of Vtg, is the only known LLTP family member whose crystal structure has been solved (4.Anderson T.A. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J.

Lamprey lipovitellin contains an amino-terminal β barrel, an extended α helical region, and a C-terminal domain, which sequesters ∼20–40 molecules of mainly phospholipid within a funnel-shaped lipid binding cavity (4.Anderson T.A.

The primary structure of Vtg is partially conserved within the amino-terminal ∼750–1000 amino acids of apoB, apolipophorin-II/I, and MTP, suggesting that the amino termini of all LLTP family members assume a Vtg-like tertiary structure (2.Mann C.J.

On the other hand, the amounts and types of lipids carried by various LLTP family members varies considerably, suggesting that the lipid binding domains of these proteins may have evolved distinct structural and functional properties consistent with their disparate roles in lipid transport. Until recently, it was assumed that Vtg is the primordial member of the LLTP gene family, evolutionarily preceding the appearance of both apoB and MTP. As such, the sequestration of lipid by Vtg was presumed to be MTP-independent and probably the result of autonomous lipid recruitment (8.Canavoso L.E. Jouni Z.E. Karnas K.J. Pennington J.E. Wells M.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 23-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 9.Hui T.Y. Olivier L.M. Kang S. Davis R.A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 785-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It was recently shown, however, that MTP exists both in insects and nematodes, neither of which express a known apoB ortholog (10.Sellers J.A. Hou L. Athar H. Hussain M.M. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20367-20373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11.Shibata Y. Branicky R. Landaverde I.O. Hekimi S. Science. 2003; 302: 1779-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although Drosophila MTP was shown to be capable of lipidating human apoB41 in a cotransfection assay, the endogenous substrate(s) of insect MTP have not been identified (10.Sellers J.A. Hou L. Athar H. Hussain M.M. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20367-20373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The current studies reveal that the biogenesis of what had previously appeared to be the oldest member of the LLTP gene family, Vtg, is in fact MTP-dependent. Hence, MTP is likely the ancestral member of the LLTP gene family and may function in the biogenesis of all of its evolutionary descendants. Construction of Plasmids—A clone containing full-length Xenopus laevis Vtg-A1 cDNA in the pCDV-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) was produced as described (12.Batistuzzo de Medeiros S.R.

Institute de Biologie Animale, Université de Lausanne-Faculté des Sciences, Lausanne-Suisse (Switzerland)1993Google Scholar). For expression, the entire cDNA insert was ligated into the expression vector pCMV5 (13.Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlbäck H. Jörnvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MTP-N780Y was constructed by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis as described by Ohashi et al. (14.Ohashi K. Ishibashi S. Osuga J. Tozawa R. Harada K. Yahagi N. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Tamura Y. Nagai R. Illingworth D.R. Gotoda T. Yamada N. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1199-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Metabolic Radiolabeling—COS-1 cells were grown in 100-mm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 mg/liter glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FBS. (Mediatech). Cells were transfected at 50–60% confluence with a total of 9 μg of DNA/dish by the FuGENE 6 method (Roche Applied Science), using a 2:1 (vol:mass) ratio of FuGENE 6:DNA. For coexpression, cells were transfected with 6 μg of Vtg or apoB41 plasmid (15.Sellers J.A. Shelness G.S. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1897-1904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 3 μg of truncated human placental alkaline phosphatase (AP), wild-type human MTP 97-kDa subunit, or MTP-N780Y. Cells were incubated with transfection mixture for 24 h and then radiolabeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys (EasyTag Express Protein Labeling Mix, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in Met/Cys-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN Biomedicals) for the indicated times. Following labeling, media were recovered, and the cells washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed on the plates with 1 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and pepstatin A). Media samples were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min and adjusted to lysis buffer conditions. Media and cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation by addition of 1 μl of sheep anti-Xenopus Vtg antiserum (diluted 1:5 in phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) or 5 μl of rabbit anti-human apoB (Academy Biomedical, Houston, TX). Immune complexes were recovered with a 15-μl bed volume of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), as described (15.Sellers J.A. Shelness G.S. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1897-1904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis of the lipidation state of Vtg, 2 150-mm dishes of cells were transfected with 15 μg of total DNA. For pulse-chase protocols, 60-mm dishes of cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method (16.Shelness G.S. Morris-Rogers K.C. Ingram M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9310-9318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 3 μg of total DNA. For all transfections the same 2:1 mass ratio of Vtg-A1 and MTP or AP was employed. ApoB and Vtg-A1 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by 6% SDS-PAGE. Xenopus Vtg was transfected in duplicate with either AP or the human MTP 97-kDa subunit (17.Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell. Biol. Lipids. 2000; 1486: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 18.Hussain M.M. Shi J. Dreizen P. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 22-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Cells were radiolabeled with [35S]Met/Cys for 4 h, and cell lysates and media samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Xenopus Vtg antibodies. Cotransfection with AP and Vtg gave raise to a protein of ∼220 kDa, not present when cells were transfected with AP alone. (Fig. 1, compare lane 1 with lanes 3 and 5). The gel mobility was consistent with a calculated molecular mass of 200 kDa and some covalent modification, including N-linked glycosylation and phosphorylation within the Vtg phosvitin domain (19.Nardelli D. van het Schip F.D. Gerber-Huber S. Haefliger J.A. Gruber M. AB G. Wahli W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15377-15385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, only trace amounts of Vtg were detected in media, unless cotransfection was performed with MTP (compare lanes 4 and 6 with lanes 8 and 10). These data suggest that MTP might be required to promote the efficient secretion of Vtg. To explore the MTP dependence of Vtg secretion more quantitatively, a pulse-chase experiment was performed. Triplicate dishes of cells cotransfected with Vtg and either AP or MTP were pulse radiolabeled with [35S]Met/Cys for 1 h and then chased with complete media containing 1 mm excess of Met and Cys for 4 h. Vtg was immunoprecipitated from cell and media samples and subjected to SDS-PAGE. In Vtg and MTP cotransfected cells, a coimmunoprecipitating band was observed whose size corresponds to that of MTP (Fig. 2A, lanes 13–15 and 19–21). Similar interactions have been observed between human MTP and apoB and further suggest the possibility of a functional interaction between MTP and Vtg (20.Wu X.J. Zhou M.Y. Huang L.S. Wetterau J. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10277-10281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 21.Patel S.B. Grundy S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18686-18694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Further, cotransfection with MTP resulted in a dramatic increase in the percentage of Vtg recovered from media and a reduction recovered from cells (compare lanes 7–12 with lanes 19–24). Band intensities from this and an additional pulse-chase experiment (data not shown) were quantitated by phosphorimaging analysis and used to calculate secretion efficiency and total recovery. As observed in Fig. 2B, coexpression of Vtg with MTP increased Vtg secretion efficiency by 5-fold. However, the percentage of Vtg recovered from both cells and media after the 4-h chase (∼50%) was relatively unaffected by MTP expression (Fig. 2C), suggesting that MTP exerts a dramatic effect on Vtg secretion but not intracellular stability. To compare the MTP requirement for Vtg secretion, relative to the requirement for apoB, wild type and a missense abetalipoproteinemia allele of MTP were tested for their ability to promote Vtg and apoB41 secretion. The abetalipoproteinemia missense mutation (N780Y) has been reported to accumulate to wild type levels; however, it displays only background triglyceride transfer activity (14.Ohashi K. Ishibashi S. Osuga J. Tozawa R. Harada K. Yahagi N. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Tamura Y. Nagai R. Illingworth D.R. Gotoda T. Yamada N. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 30372-30377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As observed in Fig. 3, and observed previously (15.Sellers J.A. Shelness G.S. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1897-1904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Leiper J.M. Bayliss J.D. Pease R.J. Brett D.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21951-21954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the secretion of apoB41 is fully dependent upon MTP coexpression (compare lanes 2 and 4). The ability of MTP-N780Y to promote apoB41 secretion is severely reduced and approaches the background observed with no MTP coexpression (compare lanes 2 and 6). However, unlike apoB41, the secretion of Vtg was nearly identical using both the wild type and the N780Y forms of MTP (Fig. 3, compare lanes 10 and 12). These data suggest that the requirements for Vtg and apoB biogenesis contributed by MTP are overlapping but not identical. To explore whether MTP-mediated stimulation of Vtg secretion is accompanied by its acquisition of lipid, equilibrium density gradient centrifugation at d = 1.25 g/ml KBr was performed as described (24.Shelness G.S. Hou L. Ledford A.S. Parks J.S. Weinberg R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44702-44707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Vtg recovered from AP- or MTP-transfected cells was recovered in the d > 1.25 g/ml, lipid-poor bottom gradient fraction (Fig. 4, lanes 1–8). We also observed that Vtg was incapable of floatation at d = 1.29 g/ml using CsCl gradients (data not shown). These results suggest that even in the presence of MTP, Vtg does not acquire sufficient lipid to form a buoyant lipoprotein. As a positive control, apoB20.1 was analyzed. This form of apoB was shown previously to form a small emulsion particle with a density of ∼1.24 g/ml when coexpressed with MTP (24.Shelness G.S. Hou L. Ledford A.S. Parks J.S. Weinberg R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44702-44707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Under the same conditions used for the Vtg analysis, MTP coexpression converted ∼20% of the total secreted apoB20.1 into a form that floated at d < 1.25 g/ml (Fig. 4, compare lanes 9 and 11 with lanes 13 and 15). Together these data suggest that the amount of lipid added to Vtg by MTP is insufficient to create a buoyant lipoprotein or that the effects of MTP on Vtg secretion competence are mediated by events other than bulk lipidation. The stimulation of Vtg secretion by MTP observed in the current study is reminiscent of the effects of MTP on apoB. In the absence of MTP, apoB fails to acquire lipid during translation, causing misfolding and intracellular retention and degradation (25.Shelness G.S. Sellers J.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 26.Fisher E.A. Pan M. Chen X.L. Wu X.Y. Wang H.X. Jamil H. Sparks J.D. Williams K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27855-27863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In contrast, coexpression of apoB with MTP promotes nascent lipoprotein formation, which stabilizes apoB and promotes anterograde transport and secretion (23.Leiper J.M. Bayliss J.D. Pease R.J. Brett D.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21951-21954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Sharp D. Mullaney D. Yao Z. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7628-7632Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Under the conditions employed here, a dramatic increase in Vtg secretion was observed upon coexpression with MTP (Figs. 1 and 2). However, this increased secretion was not accompanied by a detectable degree of Vtg lipidation as judged by density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 4). This is to be expected given that the small amount of lipid (20–40 molecules/monomer) associated with lipovitellin forms a very high density lipoprotein, which is difficult to resolve from lipid-poor proteins based on density alone (5.Thompson J.R. Banaszak L.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9398-9409Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 28.Chapman M.J. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 789-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence additional methods beyond those commonly used to study buoyant lipoprotein assembly will be required to monitor Vtg lipidation in cell-based systems. Despite the inability to detect lipid associated with Vtg, MTP exerted a profound stimulatory effect on Vtg secretion, which is comparable to that seen for apoB41. This raises the possibility that MTP functions by loading lipid into the Vtg lipid-binding cavity, perhaps during or shortly after translation. On the other hand, it is intriguing that a triglyceride transfer-defective abetalipoproteinemia allele of MTP (N780Y) is also effective in promoting Vtg secretion, suggesting that a non-bulk lipid transfer-related activity of MTP may be important for Vtg assembly. A chaperone-like activity of MTP has long been proposed to play a role in the folding dynamics of apoB, and perhaps by analogy, Vtg (29.Gordon D.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It has also been noted that the MTP-dependent addition of chaperone-like lipids to apoB may facilitate subsequent folding and bulk lipid acquisition (30.Wetterau J.R. Lin M.C.M. Jamil H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Lipids Lipid Metab. 1997; 1345: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In this regard, it of interest that the crystal structure of lipovitellin revealed a single molecule of lipid fully surrounded by protein atoms at a site far removed from the main lipid-binding cavity (5.Thompson J.R. Banaszak L.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9398-9409Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). An intriguing possibility is that MTP, utilizing an activity distinct from its ability to engage in bulk lipid transfer, deposits a single phospholipid molecule in this site, which then facilitates the formation of the native tertiary structure of Vtg. By analogy, the CD1 major histocompatibility complex lipid antigen-presenting proteins acquire a single phospholipid molecule in the ER, which may facilitate their assembly and transport to endosomes (31.Park J.J. Kang S.J. De Silva A.D. Stanic A.K. Casorati G. Hachey D.L. Cresswell P. Joyce S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, recent studies in MTP knock-out mice revealed that antigenic glycolipid transfer to CD1d in hepatocytes and intestinal epithelial cells, is MTP-dependent (32.Brozovic S. Nagaishi T. Yoshida M. Betz S. Salas A. Chen D. Kaser A. Glickman J. Kuo T. Little A. Morrison J. Corazza N. Kim J.Y. Colgan S.P. Young S.G. Exley M. Blumberg R.S. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The finding that Vtg is a substrate for MTP has important implications for understanding the evolutionary origins and mechanisms of apoB-containing lipoprotein formation. Until recently, it was presumed that so-called “primitive lipoproteins”, such as Vtg and insect lipophorins, were formed by autonomous lipid recruitment (8.Canavoso L.E. Jouni Z.E. Karnas K.J. Pennington J.E. Wells M.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 23-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 9.Hui T.Y. Olivier L.M. Kang S. Davis R.A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 785-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The studies here, however, clearly demonstrate that even Vtg-containing lipoprotein formation cannot proceed without the participation of MTP. As Vtg and MTP are highly conserved in most oviparous animals, the observed capacity of human MTP to promote the secretion of X. laevis Vtg-A1, probably extends to invertebrates as well. Indeed, genetic studies in Caenorhabditis elegans have drawn an indirect functional connection between MTP and Vtg. Mutations or silencing of dsc-4, the C. elegans ortholog of MTP, partially suppressed a pleiotropic phenotype caused by disruption of the ubiquinone biosynthetic gene, CLK-1. siRNA-mediated silencing of some Vtg genes created a similar phenotype, suggesting the possibility that suppression of clk-1 by dsc-4 is related to disruption of Vtg-containing lipoprotein assembly (11.Shibata Y. Branicky R. Landaverde I.O. Hekimi S. Science. 2003; 302: 1779-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the present studies demonstrate that MTP is the progenitor member of the LLTP gene family and likely acts on all LLTP family descendants, including Vtg, apoB, and perhaps apolipophorin-II/I. Its differential interactions with multiple substrates has numerous implications for understanding the evolution of MTP and its many acquired roles in intracellular lipid mobilization, lipoprotein assembly and secretion, antigenic lipid presentation, and perhaps other as yet unknown functions."

NAD plays further roles in processes as diverse as calcium mobilization, DNA repair, and post-translational modification of proteins in eukaryotes. The final step of NAD biosynthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme NAD synthetase (NADS) and involves the conversion of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD) to NAD (1Rizzi M. Schindelin H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). NAD synthetase activity was first described in the late 1950s (2Preiss J. Handler P. J. Biol.

Two types of NADS enzymes have been discovered; the first using preferentially ammonia as the amide donor, the second employing glutamine instead.

Eukaryotic NADSs confer an additional N-terminal domain with nitrilase activity, which enables them to use glutamine as an amide donor (10Bieganowski P. Pace H.C. Brenner C. J. Biol.

At first, the crystal structures of the bsuNADS apoenzyme, the complex of bsuNADS with ATP, and the complex of bsuNADS with the reaction intermediate NAD-adenylate had been reported (12Rizzi M.

More recently, a 1.0-Å resolution structure of bsuNADS in complex with the NAD-adenylate intermediate has been described (16Symersky J. Devedjiev Y. Moore K. Brouillette C. DeLucas L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 1138-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The combined structural studies unraveled the overall architecture of a NADS and delineated its mode of substrate binding. They defined separate binding sites for the ATP co-substrate (ATP binding pocket) and the substrate NAAD (NAAD/NAD binding pocket), and they revealed some details of the catalytic mechanism. NADS blocking agents have been suggested to be promising antibiotics for pathogens, such as Bacillus anthracis, which may be developed employing the bsu-NADS crystal structures (17Sutherland S. Drug Discov. Today. 2003; 8: 335-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 18Velu S.E. Cristofoli W.A. Garcia G.J. Brouillette C.G. Pierson M.C. Luan C.H. DeLucas L.J. Brouillette W.J. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 3371-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide high resolution crystal structures of NADS from E. coli, which shed light on evolutionary relationships among the enzymes ecoNADS and bsuNADS. In addition to the structure of the apoenzyme and complexes of the enzyme with AMP, NAAD, and AMP+PPi, we present also the structure of NADS in association with its reaction product, NAD. This structure exhibits some unexpected rearrangements both in the active site and in the product molecules upon conversion of NAAD to NAD. The results reveal novel dynamical aspects for the reaction mechanism for ammonia-dependent NADSs. This work should also aid in the design of species-specific inhibitors for this class of enzymes. Cloning, Expression and Purification—The E. coli nadE gene encoding NADS was PCR-amplified with E. coli DH5α cells as the template source and was inserted into the EcoRI site of the expression plasmid pRSETHE (derived from pRSET6d (19Schoepfer R. Gene. 1993; 124: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar)). The expression product was designed to contain an N-terminal hexahistidine tag (tag sequence MAHHHHHHEF). The DNA construct was verified by automated sequencing, which predicted a protein product in accordance with SwissProt accession number P18843. The protein was expressed in shaking cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells at 32 °C overnight by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside during the mid-log phase of growth. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by sonification (Branson sonifier, Schwäbisch Gmünd, Germany). The His-tagged protein was captured on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen, Düsseldorf, Germany) in buffer A, washed with buffer B (50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and eluted in a linear gradient to buffer C (50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 800 mm imidazole, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The NADS-containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer D (30 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA) and applied to a DEAE-cellulose column (DE-52, Whatman, Brentford, UK), washed with buffer E (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and eluted in a linear gradient to buffer F (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl). NADS eluted in the first of two peaks. The enzyme fractions were pooled, dialyzed against crystallization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA), and concentrated by ultrafiltration (10-kDa molecular mass cutoff membrane; Amicon, Billerica, MA) to ∼19 mg/ml. Crystallization and Data Collection—E. coli NADS apoenzyme was crystallized in hanging drops by vapor equilibration at room temperature against 12.5–18.5% polyethylene glycol 400, 50 mm MgCl2, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0–5.4, with a drop volume ratio of 2:1 (protein solution:reservoir). The addition of 1 μl of a suspension of lithium-meta-tantalate significantly increased the nucleation rate and quality of the crystals. Crystals appeared and grew within a period of 1–14 days. NADS-ligand complexes were obtained by co-crystallization, adding 1.5–2 mm AMP (form II), ATP (form III), NAAD (form IV), or NAD (form V) to the setup (Table I).Table ICrystallographic data Data in parentheses for the last 0.05 Å (for form I last 0.1 Å).CrystalsFormIIIIIIIVVCofactor-c-, not determinedAMPAMP + PPiNAADNADSpace groupP3121C2C2C2P3121Unit cell parametersa (Å)91.992.592.492.492.2b (Å)91.967.867.967.892.2c (Å)76.348.348.448.276.2α (°)9090909090β (°)90104.5104.2104.490γ (°)120909090120PDB ID code1WXF1WXE1WXI1WXG1WXHData collectionResolution (Å)30.0-2.330.0-1.830.0-1.730.0-1.930.0-1.9Unique reflections16,08125,73429,22921,52629,775Redundancy5.43.73.83.63.8Completeness (%)95.1 (97.7)95.9 (92.1)91.6 (87.6)94.5 (91.7)99.5 (95.3)I/σ(I)14.4 (3.0)13.0 (2.9)14.7 (2.7)11.9 (2.3)19.6 (3.0)RsymaRsym(I) = (ΣhklΣi[|Ii(hk l) - 〈I(hkl)〉|]/ΣhklΣi[Ii(hkl)]; Ii(hkl) - intensity of the ith measurement of hkl; 〈I(hkl)〉 - average value of hkl for all i measurements (%)8.8 (45.9)10.8 (41.8)7.4 (42.8)11.7 (58.6)5.4 (36.7)RefinementResolution30.0-2.330.0-1.830.0-1.730.0-1.930.0-1.9Reflections used1608025734292292152629758Protein molecules/asymmetric unit11111Protein atoms20082029205120082008Solvent atoms165257277227302Nucleotide atoms-46554444Mg2+-1211Rwork/RfreebRwork = Σhkl[||Fobs| - k|Fcalc||]/Σhkl[|Fobs|]; Rfree = Σhkl⊂T[||Fobs| - k|Fcalc||]/Σhkl⊂T[|Fobs|]; hkl⊂T - test set (%)18.3/21.719.1/21.117.6/20.519.9/22.317.1/19.1Average temperature factors (Å2)Protein36.418.718.920.328.2Water oxygens47.833.938.134.250.4Nucleotide (NAD/ATP sites)-/-19.5/45.117.1/38.629.0/-38.3/-Mg2+-42.959.233.5-Wilson B-factor38.926.526.824.533.3Root mean square deviation from ideal valuesBond length (Å)0.0050.0050.0050.0050.005Bond angle (°)1.081.201.101.131.15Ramachandran analysisPreferred (%)93.693.993.994.592.3Additionally allowed (%)6.05.75.35.07.3Disallowed (%)0.40.40.80.50.4a Rsym(I) = (ΣhklΣi[|Ii(hk l) - 〈I(hkl)〉|]/ΣhklΣi[Ii(hkl)]; Ii(hkl) - intensity of the ith measurement of hkl; 〈I(hkl)〉 - average value of hkl for all i measurementsb Rwork = Σhkl[||Fobs| - k|Fcalc||]/Σhkl[|Fobs|]; Rfree = Σhkl⊂T[||Fobs| - k|Fcalc||]/Σhkl⊂T[|Fobs|]; hkl⊂T - test setc -, not determined Open table in a new tab Diffraction data were recorded at room temperature with a Rigaku (Tokyo, Japan) rotating anode x-ray generator equipped with a MarResearch (Hamburg, Germany) image plate. For data collection, crystals were mounted in thin walled special glass capillaries (Charles Supper Company, Natick, MA) with mother liquor on one side. Data were processed using the HKL software package (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38572) Google Scholar). Structure Solution and Refinement—The E. coli NADS-NAD co-crystal structure was solved by molecular replacement with the AMoRe software program (21Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) using the B. subtilis NADS coordinates (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1NSY) as a search model. The molecular replacement solution was subjected to rigid body refinement and simulated annealing using crystallography and NMR system (CNS) software package (22Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). The model was further improved by alternating cycles of manual model building using the XtalView software program (23McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) and positional and temperature factor refinement steps (CNS). During refinement, clear difference density appeared for the cofactor, which was manually inserted (XtalView). During the last cycles of refinement, water molecules were built automatically (CNS) into spherical peaks of the Fo - Fc difference electron density and verified by manual inspection. During all refinement steps, 5% of the reflections were set aside to monitor the free R-factor. All other NADS structures were subsequently solved by molecular replacement using the E. coli NADS coordinates as a search model and refined as outlined above. The final geometries of the models were evaluated using the PROCHECK program (24Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). For structure analyses, various programs from the Uppsala software factory (x-ray.bmc.uu.se/usf/) and from the Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 (CCP4) program package (25Collaborative Computational Project N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar) were employed. Coordinates and structure factors have been submitted to the Protein Data Bank (PDB codes 1WXE, 1WXF, 1WXG, 1WXH, 1WXI) and will be released upon publication. Structure Solution and Quality of the Models—Recombinant ecoNADS was produced, purified, and crystallized as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The crystal structures of the ecoNADS apoenzyme (form I; Table I) as well as four co-crystal structures with natural substrates and catalytic products (AMP, form II; AMP+PPi, form III; NAAD, form IV; and NAD, form V; Table I) were solved by Patterson rotation/translation searches, using the structure coordinates of bsuNADS (PDB code 1NSY). The crystals of the enzyme complexes were obtained by co-crystallization and pertained to two different crystal systems (Table I). Employing diffraction data to maximum resolutions between 1.7 and 2.3 Å without intensity cutoffs, the models were refined to Rwork and Rfree values between 17.1 and 22.3%, maintaining good stereochemistry (Table I). All crystals comprised the full-length protein (residues 2–275), excluding the first methionine. No residues for the N-terminal hexahistidine affinity tag could be located in the electron densities. The short flexible loop P1 (residues 88–90) was not visible in the structures in which the ATP binding site is empty (forms I, IV, and V). A large loop P2 (residues 208–224; Fig. 2) could not be traced in either of the five crystal structures. Arg-186, located in a loop between β5 and α8 (see below for a description of the topology), exhibited a disallowed dihedral angle conformation in all five models, which was maintained because of unambiguous 2Fo - Fc electron density for this residue. The unusual conformation is stabilized through hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions with Glu-22, Ser-26, Pro-183, and Leu-184. Global Structure and Comparison to the B. subtilis Enzyme— ecoNADS exhibits an α/β fold similar to the B. subtilis enzyme (Figs. 3 and 4A). 55% of all residues are found in α-helical conformation, 15% belonging to β-structures. A twisted five-stranded parallel β-sheet is sandwiched between the two large helices α3 and α6. All β-strands are separated by single α-helices, with the exception of β3 and β4, which are disrupted by two α-helices (α5 and α6). Thus, the core of ecoNADS comprises a typical Rossmann fold nucleotide binding motif.Fig. 4Phylogenetic comparison.A, stereo view of a superpositioning of the NAAD co-crystal structures of E. coli NADS (ecoNADS) (left subunit in light blue and right subunit in black) and B. subtilis NADS (bsuNADS) (both subunits in red; PDB code 1IFX). The NADS homodimers are shown in the same orientation as in Fig. 3. Cofactors are indicated by broad sticks (color-coded by atom type: oxygen in red, nitrogen in blue, and phosphorus in pink). Carbons for ligands of the left subunit are light blue, and those for ligands of the right subunit are gray). Besides NAAD, which was co-crystallized with the enzymes shown, AMP and PPi from the form III crystal structure are superimposed to indicate the ATP binding pockets. Regions with a C-α root mean square deviation >1 Å between the two enzymes are colored in green in the left subunit of ecoNADS (region 1, residues 36–41; region 2, residues 70–75; region 3, residues 124–128). B, detailed stereo view of a similar superpositioning of ecoNADS (NAD complex) with bsuNADS (NAD-adenylate complex), indicating residues for the P2 loop in yellow (bsuNADS) and for residues neighboring the P2 loop in green (ecoNADS). Other coloring and the orientation of the figure are identical to those of the left subunit in A. C, comparison of region 1 from the two enzymes, which contains residues close to the NAAD/NAD binding site after global superpositioning of the molecules. Atoms are color-coded by type as above. Carbons and backbone traces of ecoNADS are shown in light blue, and those of bsu-NADS are in red. Residues of ecoNADS are labeled in single letter style. The NAAD molecules superimpose almost perfectly; therefore, only one (from ecoNADS) is shown for clarity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In both space groups, C2 and P3121, ecoNADS or its complexes crystallized with one protein molecule per crystallographic asymmetric unit. It has been well established that bacterial NADSs form homodimers (7Willison J.C. Tissot G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3400-3402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Rizzi M. Nessi C. Mattevi A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Galizzi A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5125-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the present crystals, ecoNADS monomers are positioned close to crystallographic two-fold axes, which generate the functional dimers. The globular NADS homodimer has approximate dimensions of 77 × 60 × 56 Å. Based on an analysis with the protein-protein interaction server (26Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar), ∼2500 Å2 of combined surface area are buried in the dimer interface, encompassing 18% of the solvent-exposed surface area of the molecules. Contacts between the protomers are principally mediated by the α5–α6 region. The two pairs of helices align homotypically in an antiparallel fashion (Fig. 3). The dimer interface is predominantly nonpolar (75% of the participating residues) and involves 14 hydrogen bonds but lacks intervening water molecules. Therefore, ecoNADS qualifies as an obligatory dimer. ecoNADS and bsuNADS are 55% identical in their amino acid sequences (Fig. 2). Consistently, they exhibit quite similar overall folds. Fig. 4A shows an overlay of the NAAD-containing models from both organisms, which exhibit an average root mean square deviation of 0.55 Å for 241 aligned C-α atoms. Five regions in the E. coli protein contain more than one residue deviating by >1 Å from the B. subtilis structure (Fig. 4A): region 1 (residues 37–42) (E. coli numbering), region 2 (residues 71–76), region 3 (residues 125–129), the far C terminus, and the C-terminal continuation of the P2 loop. Regions 1 and 2 exhibit single or double amino acid insertions in ecoNADS. Significantly, region 1 is intimately involved in binding of the adenylyl moiety in the NAAD/NAD binding pocket (see below). In contrast, the deviating regions 2, 3, and the far C terminus are distant from the substrate binding sites and are therefore not expected to exhibit effects on the substrate or product binding characteristics of the enzymes. The P2 loop has a fundamental impact on the catalytic mechanism (see “Architecture of the NAAD/NAD Binding Site”). Design of the ATP Binding Site—In the present ensemble of crystal structures, the ATP binding sites of form II and III crystals contained AMP and AMP+PPi, respectively, whereas the site was empty in the apoenzyme (form I), in the NAAD complex (form IV), and in the NAD complex (form V). Crystal form III was obtained by the addition of ATP to the crystallization drops, but the crystals contained AMP and pyrophosphate, indicating that hydrolysis of ATP took place during crystallization. Each of the two ATP binding sites in the ecoNADS dimer is formed exclusively from one subunit. In crystal forms II and III, the ribose portions of the adenine nucleotides are engaged in hydrogen bonding interactions with the backbone oxygen of Gly-46 (to ribose O-2′) and the side chain hydroxyl group of Thr-160 (to ribose O-3′). The AMP adenine ring is held in place through stacking interactions with Arg-142, Ile-47, and Ser-48 (Fig. 5A). A hydrogen bond between N-6 of the adenine moiety and Gln-88 leads to a stabilization of loop P1, as indicated by clear 2Fo - Fc electron density for this protein region. In contrast, no electron density developed for loop P1 in the apoform or in other crystals with unoccupied ATP binding sites (forms I, IV, and V). Flexibility in loop P1 is the only recognizable mechanism to yield access to the ATP binding site. Thus, the P1 loop serves as a lid, which is flexibly designed to allow ATP access but closes the ATP pocket upon substrate binding. The side chain of Arg-82 exists in two conformations in the AMP co-crystal structures. In the major conformation, it interacts either with Gln-88 of the P1 loop and with N-1 of the adenine moiety. In the minor conformation, it interacts with the side chains of Glu-91 and Gln-95 from helix α4 (Fig. 5A). The latter conformation of Arg-82 is the only form seen in crystal structures with unoccupied ATP binding sites (forms I, IV, and V). The conformation of Arg-82, in which it interacts with Gln-88 and the adenine of the nucleotide, thus seems to be induced upon ATP/AMP binding. Because the other conformation of Arg-82, in which it interacts with helix α4 residues and which is characteristic of the nucleotide-free state, is seen as a minor conformation in the AMP and AMP+PPi co-crystal structures; a small portion of the protein molecules in these latter crystals presumably have no nucleotide bound. Taken together, Arg-82 in ecoNADS seems to play the role of a substrate sensor or gate keeper for the ATP binding pocket. As in most ATP-binding proteins, several magnesium ion binding sites have been reported for bsuNADS (14Rizzi M. Bolognesi M. Coda A. Structure (Camb.). 1998; 6: 1129-1140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the present ecoNADS structures, a Mg2+ binding site (site I) is clearly occupied as well in crystal forms II (AMP), III (AMP+PPi), and IV (NAAD), i.e. in structures that contain at least AMP at the ATP binding site or NAAD at the NAAD/NAD binding site. The Mg2+-I ions show a typical octahedral coordination sphere, which in the AMP+PPi co-crystal structure (form III) is composed of oxygens from the AMP α-phosphate, the two phosphate groups of the pyrophosphate moiety (former β- and γ-phosphates of ATP), the side chain carboxyls of Asp-51 and Glu-165 and a water molecule (Fig. 5C). In the AMP co-crystal structure (form II), which lacks the pyrophosphate molecule, and in the NAAD co-crystal structure (form IV), in which the ATP binding pocket is unoccupied, missing phosphate oxygens are replaced by water molecules in the coordination sphere. In crystals of form IV (NAAD co-crystal), the nicotinysyl portion of NAAD is oriented toward Mg2+-I. The nicotinysyl carboxyl group of NAAD is engaged in a hydrogen bond with a water oxygen, which belongs to the octahedral coordination sphere of Mg2+-I (Fig. 5C). The latter water oxygen coincides with the position of an α-phosphate oxygen in forms II (AMP) and III (AMP+ PPi) structures. In contrast, the form V structure (NAD co-crystal) does not contain the Mg2+-I ion. Correlating with this observation, the nicotinysyl moiety of NAD is differently oriented from the corresponding portion of NAAD and is pointing away from the Mg2+-I binding site (see “Architecture of the NAAD/NAD Binding Site”). Therefore, in the NAAD co-crystal structure, Mg2+-I is seen as a direct link between the ATP binding pocket and the NAAD/NAD binding pocket. This direct interaction is lost upon formation of the product NAD. A second magnesium ion (Mg2+-II) has been reported in bsuNADS crystal structures (14Rizzi M. Bolognesi M. Coda A. Structure (Camb.). 1998; 6: 1129-1140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 15Devedjiev Y. Symersky J. Singh R. Jedrzejas M. Brouillette C. Brouillette W. Muccio D. Chattopadhyay D. DeLucas L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 806-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), where it is coordinated by the AMP α-phosphate, two pyrophosphate oxygens, two water molecules, and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Thr-208 (B. subtilis numbering). In the present ensemble of structures, the Mg2+-II ion is only seen in form III crystals (AMP+PPi complex). Because Mg2+-II is present only in the AMP+PPi complex, the pyrophosphate (or by inference the β- and γ-phosphate groups of ATP) is required to capture a magnesium ion at site II in ecoNADS. Comparison of the ATP Binding Sites of E. coli and B. subtilis NADS—Ordering of the P1 loop upon occupation of the ATP binding site has also been seen in bsuNADS. Therefore, loop P1 seems to be a conserved flexible element, the function of which is to close the ATP binding site upon the addition of a nucleotide. In ecoNADS, we have observed an additional conformational change in the side chain of Arg-82 upon AMP+PPi binding, which is consistent with Arg-82 constituting a sensor for the occupation of the ATP pocket (Fig. 5A). In contrast, according to available models for the B. subtilis protein, the Arg-82 conformation of the nucleotide-bound forms is preformed in the bsuNADS apoenzyme. Thus, despite a high degree of similarity in the chemical composition of the ATP binding pockets, ecoNADS and bsuNADS seem to respond differently to nucleotide binding. Significantly, in bsuNADS, the N-terminal part of loop P2 contributes the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Thr-208 (B. subtilis numbering) for coordination of Mg2+-II in the ATP binding pocket. Loop P2 is ordered in structures of the Bacillus enzyme, in which nucleotides occupy the ATP pocket, portraying how this region can fold back onto the bulk of the protein (Fig. 4B). In contrast, loop P2 is disordered in the present structures of ecoNADS. The sequence of"

Because PSAC is permeant to small metabolic precursors essential for parasite growth and is present on red blood cells infected with geographically divergent parasite isolates, it may be an ideal target for future antimalarial development. Here, we used chemically induced mutagenesis and known PSAC antagonists that inhibit in vitro parasite growth to examine whether resistance mutations in PSAC can be readily induced. Stable mutants resistant to phloridzin were generated and selected within 3 weeks after treatment with 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine. These mutants were evaluated with osmotic lysis and electrophysiological transport assays, which indicate that PSAC inhibition by phloridzin is complex with at least two different modes of inhibition. Mutants resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of phloridzin expressed PSAC activity indistinguishable from that on sensitive parasites, indicating selection of resistance via mutations in one or more other parasite targets. Failure to induce mutations in PSAC activity is consistent with a highly constrained channel protein less susceptible to resistance mutations; whether this protein is parasite- or host-encoded remains to be determined.

This channel, the plasmodial surface anion channel (PSAC), has a number of unusual functional properties that distinguish it from known human channels. First, it accounts for increases in permeability to a range of solutes identified in many previous studies. PSAC is permeant to both anions (2Kirk K. Horner H.A. Elford B.C. Ellory J.C. Newbold C.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3339-3347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and organic solutes such as sugars (3Ginsburg H. Kutner S. Krugliak M. Cabantchik Z.I. Mol. Biochem.

Acta. 2000; 1463: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Amazingly, although broadly permeant, it effectively excludes Na+ by >100,000-fold relative to Cl–. This combination, unparalleled in other known channels, permits osmotic stability of the infected RBC in serum while permitting the acquisition of diverse essential nutrients (8Divo A.A. Geary T.G. Davis N.L. Jensen J.B. J. Protozool. 1985; 32: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). PSAC achieves its stringent exclusion of Na+ through the combined effects of extracellular pore mouth cationic amines to repel extracellular cations and at least one weak binding site in its pore to favor bulky dehydrated ions over smaller ions (9Cohn J.V. Alkhalil A. Wagner M.A. Rajapandi T. Desai S.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 132: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Another unusual feature of PSAC is its small single channel conductance of ∼20 pS in 1.15 molar Cl– solutions (10Alkhalil A. Cohn J.V. Wagner M.A. Cabrera J.S. Rajapandi T. Desai S.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); most other channels with broad selectivity profiles exhibit larger single channel conductances. A channel's chord conductance, calculated from measured current amplitudes at a range of imposed membrane potentials, quantitatively corresponds to the number of ions passing through the open channel per unit time. In terms of Eyring rate theory, this channel's small conductance reflects the one or more energetic barriers that each solute molecule must overcome to traverse the length of the channel pore. These barriers may function to additionally fine tune the selectivity properties of PSAC. Finally, despite the nearly invariant membrane potential of human RBCs after infection, permeation through PSAC is voltage-dependent. Both whole cell and single channel recordings reveal significantly smaller absolute currents at membrane potentials (Vm) of +100 millivolts than of –100 millivolts despite equal but opposite driving forces for ion movement. Historically, channels exhibiting this phenomenon were often referred to as “inward rectifying” voltage-dependent channels. Although voltage-dependent channels are most well known as mediators of electrical signals on excitable cells, they are also present on many non-excitable cells (11Anderson P.A. Greenberg R.M. Comp Biochem. 2001; 129: 17-28Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The voltage dependence of PSAC results from a reduced frequency and duration of openings at increasingly positive Vm values, presumably because of charged residues on the channel protein that move during transitions between the open and closed states. Although the physiological relevance of this voltage dependence is unknown, it represents an important functional marker of PSAC activity. There are other complex and unusual features of PSAC gating, the process of opening and closing, that suggest additional structural constraints on the protein (12Desai S.A. Nanomedicine. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the unusual properties of PSAC and because of polymorphisms in channel gating apparent when RBCs from a single human donor are infected with genetically distinct parasite isolates (10Alkhalil A. Cohn J.V. Wagner M.A. Cabrera J.S. Rajapandi T. Desai S.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we proposed that PSAC is a parasite-encoded ion channel. Although several reports have suggested that PSAC activity results from the modification of host RBC proteins (13Huber S.M. Uhlemann A.C. Gamper N.L. Duranton C. Kremsner P.G. Lang F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 14Egee S. Lapaix F. Decherf G. Staines H.M. Ellory J.C. Doerig C. Thomas S.L. J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 10316-10322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), none of these mutually exclusive proposals has been independently confirmed. In particular, we were unable to reproduce these reports despite intensive efforts (10Alkhalil A. Cohn J.V. Wagner M.A. Cabrera J.S. Rajapandi T. Desai S.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Homology searches using known anion channel genes have not revealed obvious candidates for PSAC gene(s) in the completed Plasmodium falciparum genome sequence (16Gardner M.J. Hall N. Fung E. White O. Berriman M. Hyman R.W. Carlton J.M. Pain A. Nelson K.E. Bowman S. Paulsen I.T. James K. Eisen J.A. Rutherford K. Salzberg S.L. Craig A. Kyes S. Chan M.S. Nene V. Shallom S.J. Suh B. Peterson J.

It appears that PSAC genes differ sufficiently from known channels to render bioinformatic approaches ineffective. Here, we used an alternative approach with the goal of identifying these elusive genes. We used the potent mutagen 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) to increase the frequency of random mutations in parasite genes. We followed mutagenesis with the selection of in vitro resistance to growth inhibition by known PSAC antagonists. These antagonists are believed to kill parasites by preventing PSAC-mediated uptake of essential nutrients. This approach selected for unambiguous and stable resistance to growth inhibition by 100 μm phloridzin, a nonspecific antagonist of PSAC (17Kutner S. Breuer W.V. Ginsburg H. Cabantchik Z.I. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Osmotic lysis and electrophysiological studies with phloridzin revealed that resistance did not result from either an altered mechanism or an affinity for PSAC inhibition. Effects of phloridzin on other parasite activities are implicated. We also used single channel studies to determine that phloridzin inhibition of PSAC is complex, with at least two separate mechanisms. Comparison to inhibition by furosemide revealed additional important insights into the conformational changes required for PSAC gating. These detailed studies should help guide the design of novel and specific PSAC antagonists that may become future antimalarial drugs. Chemical Mutagenesis—Phloridzin-resistant mutants were generated and selected using a protocol based on that developed by Inselburg (18Inselburg J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 10: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Up to 2 × 109 ring stage parasites (Indo 1 strain) were synchronized with the sorbitol lysis method (19Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2773) Google Scholar) and cultured for 24 h in the presence of 150 μg/ml aphidicolin to produce a DNA replication block and to maximize the mutagenic effect of MNNG. After washing, these trophozoite-infected RBCs were incubated in culture medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 50 mg/liter hypoxanthine and 10% human serum) for 2 h before adding 0.5–1.5 μg/ml MNNG from a freshly prepared Me2SO stock of 1.5 mg/ml. Parasites were cultured at 37 °C for 24 h, washed to remove MNNG, and followed with daily microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained smears. Under our experimental conditions, MNNG treatment killed >90% of the parasites through the random and high-frequency introduction of mutations throughout the genome. Surviving parasites were cultured for 3–14 days to allow clonal increases in desired mutants. When parasitemias had recovered to ≥1%, 100 μm phloridzin was added as a selective pressure. Phloridzin was typically removed or applied at lower concentrations for several days when parasites were not visible upon microscopic examination of smears to allow for the selection of incompletely resistant mutants. In separate experiments, other PSAC antagonists such as 100 μm furosemide (10Alkhalil A. Cohn J.V. Wagner M.A. Cabrera J.S. Rajapandi T. Desai S.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), 100 μm glibenclamide (20Kirk K. Horner H.A. Spillett D.J. Elford B.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), or 50 μm 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoic acid (2Kirk K. Horner H.A. Elford B.C. Ellory J.C. Newbold C.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3339-3347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were also used for selection but have not, to date, generated unambiguous drug-resistant mutants. In light of the probable role of PSAC in nutrient acquisition (1Desai S.A. Bezrukov S.M. Zimmerberg J. Nature. 2000; 406: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), some selections were also performed in media with reduced concentrations of essential nutrients and only 2% dialyzed serum to improve the likelihood of identifying PSAC mutants (not shown). Growth Inhibition Studies—Wild-type and the phloridzin-resistant mutant parasites were synchronized by sorbitol lysis, subcultured to 0.5% parasitemia, and grown at 2% hematocrit in culture medium with and without 100 μm phloridzin. At 24-h intervals the culture medium was replaced. At these same intervals an aliquot was removed, washed, and grown without phloridzin in culture medium containing [3H]hypoxanthine (25 μCi/ml) and no unlabeled hypoxanthine. Incorporation of [3H]hypoxanthine into parasite DNA and RNA, a direct measure of parasite viability (21Chulay J.D. Haynes J.D. Diggs C.L. Exp. Parasitol. 1983; 55: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), was measured in 96-well format using a plate reader and standard β-scintillation counting. Osmotic Lysis Assays—The kinetics of infected RBC osmotic lysis in sorbitol solutions were followed as described previously (22Wagner M.A. Andemariam B. Desai S.A. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 116-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In brief, trophozoite-infected RBCs were grown by standard culture methods, enriched to 95–99% by Percoll/sorbitol separation (23Aley S.B. Sherwood J.A. Howard R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), washed in phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5), and resuspended to 0.5% hematocrit in sorbitol lysis solution (280 mm sorbitol, 20 mm sodium HEPES, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) at 37 °C. The transmittance of 700-nm light through this cell suspension was then followed continuously as a marker of osmotic swelling and lysis. This method produces estimates of permeation rates through PSAC that quantitatively match those obtained with both radioisotope flux and patch clamp (22Wagner M.A. Andemariam B. Desai S.A. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 116-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Because phloridzin inhibits host RBC membrane permeability through one or more binding sites on the intracellular face of PSAC (1Desai S.A. Bezrukov S.M. Zimmerberg J. Nature. 2000; 406: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), some experiments included a preincubation in the final phloridzin concentration before the addition of sorbitol lysis solution; the resulting levels of inhibition were comparable with those without preincubation, indicating that phloridzin uptake into intact infected RBCs is not rate-limiting. Electrophysiology—Cell-attached patch clamp recordings of infected RBCs were obtained as described previously (1Desai S.A. Bezrukov S.M. Zimmerberg J. Nature. 2000; 406: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, these experiments utilized symmetrical bath and pipette solutions of 1000 mm choline chloride, 115 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm sodium HEPES, pH 7.4. Pipettes with tip diameters of <0.5 μm and resistances of 1–4 megaohms were pulled from quartz glass. Recordings were filtered at 5 kHz with an eight-pole Bessel filter and digitized at 100 kHz. Seal resistances were typically ≥100 gigaohms. To determine mean single channel open probabilities (Po) for wild-type and phloridzin-resistant mutants, we collected single channel molecule recordings from patches on RBCs infected with each parasite in the presence of 0, 25, or 100 μm phloridzin added to both bath and pipette. For each condition, we used a home-written code that identifies transitions between channel open and closed states by the 50% threshold-crossing technique and normalized the results to the measured Po in the absence of phloridzin, 43 ± 2% (10Alkhalil A. Cohn J.V. Wagner M.A. Cabrera J.S. Rajapandi T. Desai S.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Dwell time distributions were obtained using a code that detects mid-threshold crossings, uses linear interpolation of adjacent sample times (24Sigworth F.J. Sine S.M. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), and corrects for a Gaussian filter rise time of 66.4 μs as described (25Colquhoun D. Sigworth F.J. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single Channel Recording. Plenum Press, New York1983: 191-263Google Scholar). Histogram ordinate values were normalized to the percentage of the total number of events detected under each condition and are displayed on a square root logarithmic plot (24Sigworth F.J. Sine S.M. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Burst analysis was performed with these corrected durations by defining inhibitor-induced closings as periods of inactivity ≥10 ms. Using this threshold, we tallied the durations of opening bursts defined as clusters of openings between consecutive inhibitor-induced closings. The resulting distributions were normalized and displayed in the same manner as the dwell time distributions. This approach to defining opening bursts is justified by the >100-fold difference between the mean durations of block by phloridzin or furosemide and those of intrinsic closings, as analyzed previously (12Desai S.A. Nanomedicine. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Varying the threshold that defines inhibitor-induced closings within the range of 5 and 20 ms did not produce significant changes in the burst distributions (not shown). Fig. 1A shows our algorithm for generating and selecting mutants resistant to PSAC antagonists. As reasoned previously (18Inselburg J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 10: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), ring stage parasite cultures were synchronized by growth with aphidicolin, which blocks DNA replication and stalls parasites at the early trophozoite stage. When it is removed, DNA replication ensues with a more synchronized population of parasites. At this point, we added MNNG (Fig. 1A, green-shaded area). Because MNNG is unstable in aqueous solutions and may have other deleterious effects on cell cultures (26Wang Z. Wang G. Yang J. Guo L. Yu Y. Mutat. Res. 2003; 528: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), timing its addition with the onset of DNA replication, achieved through the use of aphidicolin, should maximize its mutagenic potential. We varied the MNNG concentration to obtain ∼95% killing of parasites, as judged by microscopic examination after 24 h. At this level there should be both a high frequency of introduced mutations and yet sufficient numbers of viable parasites to allow identification of mutants. Surviving parasites were then cultured for several days before applying selective pressure with 100 μm phloridzin (Fig. 1A, red-shaded areas). With this algorithm, resistant parasites that exhibited replication rates of 5–7-fold every 48 h in the continued presence of phloridzin were identified within 3 weeks. We tested whether these mutant parasites represented stable genetic changes by culturing them under standard conditions without phloridzin for 5 weeks before performing the experiment in Fig. 1B. In the absence of phloridzin, growth rates of the selected mutants and the parent wild-type parasites were indistinguishable. In contrast, the addition of 100 μm phloridzin to the culture revealed a marked difference; within 3 days wild-type parasites were essentially eliminated, but the growth of the mutant continued unabated. The prolonged culture of these parasites in the absence of phloridzin before this experiment indicates that phloridzin resistance resulted from the acquisition of stable mutations in one or more parasite genes. We then evaluated whether resistance resulted from a lowered phloridzin affinity for PSAC inhibition. We used a recently developed a light-scattering method that tracks the kinetics of osmotic lysis in sorbitol and produces quantitative estimates of PSAC permeability (22Wagner M.A. Andemariam B. Desai S.A. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 116-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fig. 2, A and B, shows the resulting lysis time courses for wild-type and mutant parasites, respectively. The rates of lysis without and with a range of phloridzin concentrations were not statistically different within the two populations of parasites. Because there may be subtle changes in the gating, conductance, or interaction of PSAC with phloridzin that are not detectable with the macroscopic lysis assay, we performed cell-attached patch clamp of infected cells and obtained single PSAC recordings on both parasite isolates. We successfully identified single PSAC activity on mutant parasites (Fig. 2C); these PSAC molecules exhibited voltage-dependent gating and conductance resembling those seen previously on unmutagenized parasites (1Desai S.A. Bezrukov S.M. Zimmerberg J. Nature. 2000; 406: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Based on the levels of inhibition seen in the osmotic lysis experiments (Fig. 2, A and B), we chose two phloridzin concentrations (25 and 100 μm) for inclusion in separate single channel studies with both wild-type and mutant parasites (Fig. 2D, left and right columns, respectively). Phloridzin produced concentration-dependent reductions in PSAC gating on RBCs infected with each of these two parasites. We tallied our osmotic lysis experiments with a range of phloridzin concentrations and normalized them relative to the lysis rates without inhibitor (Fig. 2E, open symbols). We also collected between 94 and 254 s of single PSAC recordings at each phloridzin concentration on both wild-type and mutant parasites, determined channel open probability at a Vm of –100 mV, and normalized these results to the open probability without phloridzin. When these independent transport measurements were plotted together, the effects of phloridzin on both sorbitol-mediated lysis and single PSAC recordings were concordant, consistent with a single channel for the uptake of diverse solutes (10Alkhalil A. Cohn J.V. Wagner M.A. Cabrera J.S. Rajapandi T. Desai S.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We also found that the dose response for the inhibition of phloridzin-resistant mutants was not measurably changed from that of wild-type parasites (Fig. 2E, compare triangles to circles); both were adequately fitted by a decaying Hill equation with a dissociation constant, K0.5, of 24 μm. Thus, resistance to the growth inhibitory effects of phloridzin was mediated through mutations in one or more parasite genes not responsible for the expression of PSAC. Previous whole cell patch clamp with phloridzin added to either the cytosolic or extracellular compartments revealed that inhibition by phloridzin occurs primarily at the intracellular face of PSAC (1Desai S.A. Bezrukov S.M. Zimmerberg J. Nature. 2000; 406: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Here, we analyzed our single channel recordings to examine the mechanism of this inhibition. The addition of either 25 or 100 μm phloridzin to both the bath and pipette solutions did not affect the durations of PSAC openings (Fig. 3A), which are adequately described by a single exponentially decaying state with a mean duration of 0.2–0.4 ms (12Desai S.A. Nanomedicine. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, phloridzin altered the distribution of closed times by adding a population of closings with a mean duration of 46 ± 2 ms (Fig. 3B, smooth curve). The mean duration of these imposed closings was not affected by changes in phloridzin concentration. This collection of observations is conservatively explained by simple allosteric inhibition of PSAC through a single phloridzin binding site on the channel protein's intracellular face. Our analysis of dwell durations in the presence of phloridzin shows marked similarities to the recent characterization of PSAC inhibition by furosemide, which also produces allosteric inhibition at a single site with a mean block duration of 85 ms. Because furosemide has an ∼10-fold higher affinity for PSAC inhibition (K0.5 = 2.7 μm) (10Alkhalil A. Cohn J.V. Wagner M.A. Cabrera J.S. Rajapandi T. Desai S.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we were surprised by the similar mean block durations for furosemide and phloridzin. It is generally assumed that access to binding sites on ion channels is diffusion-limited. If furosemide and phloridzin both satisfied this assumption, then the mean closed duration of phloridzin should have been some 10 times shorter than that of furosemide because of the direct inverse relationship between the K0.5 for an inhibitor and the measured mean closed duration in single channel recordings. If the model of a single reversible binding site for each inhibitor is correct, the only explanation for this discrepancy would be that access to the binding site on PSAC is not diffusion-limited for at least one of the two inhibitors. Specifically, the rate constant for phloridzin binding would need to be significantly lower than that for furosemide binding to compensate for their similar unbinding rates. Visual examination of recordings in the presence of either 25 μm phloridzin or 25 μm furosemide (Fig. 4A, left and right columns, respectively) reveals that both compounds produce relatively long and similar periods of inhibition, apparent as regions devoid of downward channel openings. Although these compounds impose similar closed channel durations, channel openings in their presence differ markedly. Clusters of channel openings in the presence of phloridzin were visibly longer than those with the same concentration of furosemide. This observation, made in the context of the identical concentrations of the two inhibitors, is qualitatively consistent with slower binding rates for PSAC-phloridzin interactions than for PSAC-furosemide interactions. We next quantified this observation to test whether it can account for the differing macroscopic affinities of phloridzin and furosemide. We defined bursts of PSAC activity as clusters of openings flanked by closings of ≥10 ms. This cutoff value is some 10-fold greater than the longest mean duration for intrinsic PSAC closings (12Desai S.A. Nanomedicine. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) and substantially less than the mean inhibition durations imposed by phloridzin or furosemide. Thus, this cutoff value minimizes the erroneous assignment of intrinsic and inhibitor-associated bursts. Fig. 4B shows the resulting distribution of burst durations; each of the 8,534 bursts tallied here results from measurable PSAC activity between consecutive inhibition events by phloridzin or furosemide (red and green histograms, respectively). The simplest scheme for interaction between an inhibitor (I) and PSAC is shown in Reaction 1, I+P⇌koffkonIP REACTION 1 where P represents the unbound channel and IP represents a bound and inhibited channel; kon and koff represent the forward and reverse rate constants for the binding process. If the interactions of the two inhibitors with PSAC obey this scheme, then the burst distributions shown in Fig. 4B should follow Equation 1, f(t)={a×exp[ln(t)−b−exp(ln(t)−b)]}0.5 (Eq. 1) in which t represents the duration of individual bursts and a and b are constants. The distribution's mean value is given by exp(b) and is visible as a peak on this plot (12Desai S.A. Nanomedicine. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sigworth F.J. Sine S.M. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). We found that the burst distribution for 25 μm phloridzin was well fitted by Equation 1 (Fig. 4B, smooth red line) with a mean value of 21 ± 0.6 ms. The forward rate constant, kon, is then inversely related to this mean value. With 25 μm furosemide, our algorithm for identifying bursts between consecutive inhibition events produced a distribution peaking at substantially shorter durations (Fig. 4B, green histogram). Here, the best fit to Equation 1 (Fig. 4B, smooth green line) yielded a mean burst duration of 2.9 ms. Because this estimate is nearly 10-fold less than that for phloridzin, access to their respective binding sites predominantly accounts for the differing affinities of furosemide and phloridzin. In contrast, the mean durations of inhibitor-induced closings (Fig. 3B), a direct measure of koff, plays a relatively minor role in determining the relative affinities of these two agents. Our model for interactions between PSAC and these two"
https://openalex.org/W2070637336,"Neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1), a Ca2+-binding protein of the calcium sensor family, modulates various functions in intracellular signaling pathways. The N-terminal glycine in this protein is myristoylated, which is presumably necessary for its physiological functions. In order to understand the structural role of myristoylation and calcium on conformational stability, we have investigated the equilibrium unfolding and refolding of myristoylated and non-myristoylated NCS-1. The unfolding of these two forms of NCS-1 in the presence of calcium is best characterized by a five-state equilibrium model, and multiple intermediates accumulate during unfolding. Calcium exerts an extrinsic stabilizing effect on both forms of the protein. In the absence of calcium, the stability of both forms is dramatically decreased, and the unfolding follows a four-state equilibrium model. The equilibrium transitions are fully reversible in the presence of calcium. Myristoylation affects the pattern of equilibrium transitions substantially but not the number of intermediates, suggesting a structural role. Our data suggest that myristoylation reduces the stiffening of the protein during initial unfolding in the presence of calcium. The effects of myristoylation are more pronounced when calcium is present, suggesting a relationship between them. Inactivating the third EF-hand motif (E120Q mutant) drastically affects the equilibrium unfolding transitions, and calcium has no effect on these transitions of the mutants. The unfolding transitions of both forms of the mutant are similar to the transitions followed by the apo forms of myristoylated and non-myristoylated NCS-1.

Chem. 2001; 276: 39501-39504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In proteins, this lipid modification is performed by an enzyme, myristoyl CoA-protein N-myristoyltransferase. The various physiological functions of the proteins of this subfamily largely depend on myristoylation that participates in a variety of signal transduction cascades. Various functions of NCS-1, such as neurotransmitter release and modulation of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, depend on myristoylation (7Burgoyne R.D. O'Callaghan D.W. Hasdemir B. Haynes L.P. Tepikin A.V. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 203-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In some proteins, such as guanylate cyclase-activating proteins, myristoylation is required for the fine-tuning of their activity (8Hwang J.Y. Koch K.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1600: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the actual structural and functional role of N-terminal myristoylation is not known. These calcium sensor proteins function via two interrelated switches, a calcium switch and a myristoyl switch (5Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Although the structural role of calcium in these proteins has been studied in modulating conformational transitions from one form to another, the role of myristoylation has not been defined clearly. NCS-1 is a multifunctional protein (9Hilfiker S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31 (Pt 4): 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and is expressed not only in neuronal tissues but also in other non-neuronal tissues. It is a high affinity Ca2+-binding protein with three functional sites (10Jeromin A. Muralidhar D. Parameswaran M.N. Roder J. Fairwell T. Scarlata S. Dowal L. Mustafi S.M. Chary K.V. Sharma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27158-27167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It participates in neurotransmitter release, is a modulator of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase β (11Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and potassium channels (12Guo W. Malin S.A. Johns D.C. Jeromin A. Nerbonne J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26436-26443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and modulates short-term plasticity (13Sippy T. Cruz-Martin A. Jeromin A. Schweizer F.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1031-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although the three-dimensional structures of non-myristoylated frequenin from Drosophila and human NCS-1 were solved recently (14Ames J.B. Hendricks K.B. Strahl T. Huttner I.G. Hamasaki N. Thorner J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12149-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15Bourne Y. Dannenberg J. Pollmann V. Marchot P. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11949-11955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), the structure of myristoylated NCS-1 has not yet been solved. The presence of a functional calcium-myristoyl switch in NCS-1 or its functional role is not yet known. The conformation and structure of the myristoylated form of NCS-1 are not precisely characterized. It is also not clear whether N-terminal myristoylation influences the conformational stability or structure of the protein. The role of Ca2+ on the stability of NCS-1 is also not understood. To understand the role of myristoylation and Ca2+ and the interplay between them, it would be pertinent to study the unfolding behavior of NCS-1 under various conditions. Apart from our interest in the NCS-1 structure and mechanism, the protein folding studies are of general interest as an example of a complex unfolding process as well as of the interaction of calcium and the myristoyl group. With this objective, we have studied the equilibrium unfolding of myristoylated NCS-1 and compared it to non-myristoylated protein. We have studied the role of calcium on the conformational stability of both forms of the protein and folding pathways. We have shown that holo NCS-1 undergoes multistate (five-state) unfolding transitions, whereas in the absence of Ca2+, there is four-state transition. In the presence of calcium, the stability of protein increases, suggesting an extrinsic stabilization effect. There are substantial differences in the pattern of folding of myristoylated and non-myristoylated NCS-1, particularly in the presence of calcium. Myristoylation appears to decrease protein stiffening, thereby increasing the flexibility. The equilibrium unfolding transitions of apo forms of myristoylated and non-myristoylated NCS-1 are similar to both forms of a mutant (in calcium-bound form) in which EF3 was disabled by replacing E120Q. Guanidinium chloride was purchased from Serva, phenyl-Sepharose was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and standard calcium chloride solution was obtained from Sigma. Preparation of Myristoylated and Non-myristoylated NCS-1 and E120Q Mutants—Myristoylated and non-myristoylated NCS-1 were prepared by overexpressing rat cDNA cloned in pET21a vector. For preparation of the myristoylated protein, it was co-transformed with pBB131 (kindly provided by Dr. Jeffery Gordon, Washington University, St. Louis, MO) to express N-myristoyltransferase as described previously (9Hilfiker S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31 (Pt 4): 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Fisher J.R. Sharma Y. Iuliano S. Piccioti R.A. Krylov D. Hurley J. Roder J. Jeromin A. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The third EF-hand (EF3) was disabled by site-directed mutation in amino acid 120 replacing Glu with Gln (E120Q) using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutated gene was subcloned in pET21a vector. Proteins were purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography using a phenyl-Sepharose column. The proteins were bound to the column in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2) and eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris, 3 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MgCl2). Proteins were concentrated and made Ca2+-free by exchange with Chelex-treated buffer in ultrafiltration concentrator (Amicon). CD Measurements—All CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter, using the appropriate path length for near- and far-UV CD. All spectra were recorded in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7), containing 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the appropriate concentration of GdmCl, in the presence of calcium or EDTA. Spectra were corrected for the buffer baseline. Equilibrium Unfolding Experiments—Unfolding experiments were performed by denaturation in GdmCl. An 8 m stock solution of GdmCl was prepared, and the concentration of this solution was determined by a digital refractometer. Protein solutions containing 0–7 m GdmCl in the presence of 5 mm calcium chloride or 3 mm EDTA were prepared and incubated overnight. Far-UV CD spectra of these solutions were recorded in 0.02-cm-path length cell, and ellipticity at 222 nm was measured. Equilibrium unfolding was monitored by following changes in the intrinsic Trp emission fluorescence, measured at 340 nm upon exciting the sample at 295 nm. Fluorescence intensity of native protein (without denaturant) was taken as 100% native, and the fraction of unfolded molecules was calculated accordingly. Fluorescence intensity (at 340 nm) was plotted as a function of GdmCl concentration, and the data were fitted to the equation described below, which relates fluorescence intensity to the extent of unfolding. Data Analysis of the Unfolding Transitions of NCS-1—The unfolding transitions of NCS-1 were quantitatively analyzed according to four- or five-state transition model: N↔ I1↔ I2↔ I3↔ D, where N and D are the native and unfolded states, and I1, I2, and I3 are the three unfolding intermediates. The equation for multistate folding-unfolding transition has been described previously (17Hung H.C. Chen Y.H. Liu G.Y. Lee H.J. Chang G.G. Bull. Math. Biol. 2003; 65: 553-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 18Dignam J.D. Qu X. Chaires J.B. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1724-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We fitted the data to three-, four-, five-, and six-state models. Equations 1 and 2 were used for the four-state and five-state model, respectively. Similarly, equations for three- and six-state models were used by decreasing or increasing the terms in the above equation (17Hung H.C. Chen Y.H. Liu G.Y. Lee H.J. Chang G.G. Bull. Math. Biol. 2003; 65: 553-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In case of data best fitting to two models, F-test using statistical hypothesis testing and Akaike Information Criterion (20.Akaike, H. (1973) in Second International Symposium on Information Theory (Petrov, B. N., and Csaki, F., eds) pp. 261–281, Akademiai Kiado, Budapest, HungaryGoogle Scholar) were used to choose the best model. The values of parameters ΔG10, ΔG20, ΔG30, ΔG40, m1, m2, m3, and m4 were determined using the non-linear least square fitting (GRAPHPAD Prism) to the unfolding data using the above equation. ΔG10, ΔG20, ΔG30, and ΔG40 represent the free energy change of each step and m1, m2, m3, and m4 represent the free energy dependences on denaturant concentration [D] associated with each step. The values of YN, Y1, Y2, Y3, and YU representing signal from each species were estimated graphically and set as constant during the fit. For a good fit, it is suggested that at least 60 data points are required (17Hung H.C. Chen Y.H. Liu G.Y. Lee H.J. Chang G.G. Bull. Math. Biol. 2003; 65: 553-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar); we have therefore collected 88 data points for fitting the above equations. The fractions of various intermediate states were calculated as described previously (17Hung H.C. Chen Y.H. Liu G.Y. Lee H.J. Chang G.G. Bull. Math. Biol. 2003; 65: 553-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Patel S. Chaffotte A.F. Goubard F. Pauthe E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1724-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Refolding Experiments—Protein was unfolded in 6 m GdmCl for 4 h in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, containing 100 mm KCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Protein was refolded for 4 h in the desired concentration of GdmCl by diluting the solution. Refolding was monitored by exciting the samples at 280 nm and recording the fluorescence emission spectra. 8-Anilino-1-naphthalene Sulfonic Acid (ANS) Binding Experiments—For ANS binding experiments, a 10 mm stock solution of ANS (Eq. 1) (Eq. 2) was prepared in methanol. ANS was added to final concentration of 100 μm in protein solutions prepared for unfolding experiments in GdmCl. The samples were incubated for 30 min, and fluorescence emission spectra were recorded with the excitation wavelength set at 365 nm. ANS spectra were corrected for ANS fluorescence taken in buffer. The spectra were analyzed by intensity and wavelength. Controlled Trypsin Digestion—Partial trypsin digestion was carried out at room temperature with protein:enzyme ratio maintained at 100:1. Proteolysis was stopped at the desired time by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. Purification of Myristoylated and Non-myristoylated NCS-1— NCS-1 was overexpressed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Myristoylation was catalyzed by N-myristoyl transferase co-expressed with NCS-1 in bacterial cells. The expressed proteins were purified by single-step hydrophobic interaction chromatography using phenyl-Sepharose. The purity and proper folding of the recombinant protein were checked by SDS-PAGE and far-UV CD. In case of any impurity, a final step of purification on Superose 12 was employed. NCS-1 was myristoylated, which was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis; the mass of the myristoylated protein is 210 Da more than that of the non-myristoylated protein. Unfolding of NCS-1 Monitored by Trp Fluorescence—To study the transitions of unfolding and the influence of myristoylation and calcium, we performed equilibrium unfolding of myristoylated and non-myristoylated NCS-1 monitored by Trp fluorescence. NCS-1 has two Trp residues at positions Trp30 and Trp103, probably each located in a separate domain. The emission maximum of NCS-1 is about 336 nm, suggesting that these are not deeply buried inside the protein core. Fig. 1 shows the fluorescence emission spectra of myristoylated and non-myristoylated NCS-1 at various concentrations of GdmCl in the presence and absence of calcium. As seen in Fig. 1, a–d, there are substantial differences in the spectra of myristoylated and non-myristoylated NCS-1. The fluorescence intensity increased to a greater degree in the holo myristoylated protein than in the holo non-myristoylated NCS-1, before decreasing at higher concentrations of GdmCl. In the absence of calcium, there is no increase in the fluorescence intensity. This is clearly seen when the fluorescence intensity of myristoylated and non-myristoylated NCS-1 at emission maxima in the absence and presence of excess calcium is plotted against the GdmCl concentration (Fig. 2). At subdenaturing concentrations of GdmCl (up to 1.5 m), there was an increase in the emission intensity followed by a decrease at a higher denaturant concentration (Fig. 2). There was a sharp increase in the intensity maximum followed by decrease at a higher concentration of GdmCl in the case of non-myristoylated protein in its holo form (Fig. 2a). The increase in the intensity was greater and remained at a higher value than the original intensity in the case of myristoylated NCS-1 with up to 1.5 m of GdmCl. The difference between these two proteins was also seen in the absence of calcium (Fig. 2b). These results suggest that myristoylation influences the unfolding of NCS-1, indicating that myristoylation plays an important structural role.Fig. 2Change in fluorescence intensity (at wavelength maxima) of myristoylated and non-myristoylated NCS-1 with various GdmCl concentrations in the presence (a) and absence (b) of calcium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Unfolding Transitions of EF3 Mutants E120Q and Apo Wild Type NCS-1 Are Similar—EF3 is known to be the strongest calcium-binding site; hence, it was disabled by mutation to a non-functional site (E120Q). The effect of this point mutation was studied by equilibrium unfolding. The fluorescence and CD spectral properties of mutants were similar to those of wild type proteins, indicating that E120Q mutants have similar global secondary structures comparable to wild type proteins (10Jeromin A. Muralidhar D. Parameswaran M.N. Roder J. Fairwell T. Scarlata S. Dowal L. Mustafi S.M. Chary K.V. Sharma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27158-27167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Fig. 3a shows the changes in wavelength maxima versus GdmCl concentration of myristoylated and non-myristoylated NCS-1. From the graph, it appears to be a multiphasic transition. Although plots for both proteins in the presence of calcium follow similar patterns, there are minor differences in the presence of 1–2 and 4–5 m GdmCl. In the absence of calcium, there was a sharp shift in the wavelength maxima, and the spectra of both proteins overlapped (Fig. 3a). In this case, the mutant proteins were unfolded at lower concentrations of GdmCl (3.5 m). These results suggest that disabling EF3 decreases the protein stability and that calcium or myristoylation does not influence the unfolding of mutant proteins. Fig. 3b shows the unfolding of myristoylated and non-myristoylated E120Q mutant in the presence of calcium. There was apparently no effect of calcium or myristoylation on the equilibrium unfolding transitions of both forms of the mutant, suggesting that mutating this residue alone severely reduces the stability of the protein and that calcium no longer exerts its extrinsic stabilizing effect. As seen from this figure, the unfolding pattern of mutants is similar to the unfolding transition of wild type proteins in the absence of calcium (Fig. 3a). In the absence of calcium, the unfolding transitions of myristoylated and non-myristoylated NCS-1 and the E120Q mutant followed a similar pattern, suggesting that calcium and the third EF-hand in the E120Q mutant play important roles in modulating the unfolding pathways. Unfolding of NCS-1 in Ca2+-bound Form Follows the Five-state Equilibrium Model—The equilibrium unfolding transitions of myristoylated and non-myristoylated NCS-1 were studied by measuring the intensity of emission fluorescence at 340 nm. We quantitated the equilibrium transitions by fitting them to the equations as described under “Materials and Methods.” The fit was not satisfactory when we performed the unfolding experiments with 30 data points between 0 and 6 m GdmCl (residual value was >30%). Increasing the number of data points improved the fit. It was suggested previously that if the number of data points was lower, there is a possibility of missing some intermediates (17Hung H.C. Chen Y.H. Liu G.Y. Lee H.J. Chang G.G. Bull. Math. Biol. 2003; 65: 553-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We therefore performed the unfolding experiment with a large data set of 88 points between 0 and 7 m GdmCl for apo and holo myristoylated and non-myristoylated NCS-1. This way, we could take care of any anomaly in the fitting, which could occur in the unfolding of a complex protein such as NCS-1. In the case of myristoylated and non-myristoylated proteins in their holo forms, the unfolding data best fitted a five-state transition model (Fig. 4, a and b). For the apo form, the data were best fitted to the four-state transition model (Fig. 4, c and d), suggesting that calcium influences the transitions significantly. However, we did not see an effect of myristoylation on the number of intermediates during unfolding transitions in the absence of calcium. The thermodynamic parameters for unfolding process are shown in Table I. We did notice the significant differences in free energy change (ΔG0) of unfolding of myristoylated and non-myristoylated NCS-1; the ΔG20 and ΔG30 were comparatively higher in case of holo myristoylated (3.35 and 6.65 kcal mol–1) than non-myristoylated (1.3 and 4.2 kcal mol–1) NCS-1, suggesting higher conformational stability of these intermediates in the case of myristoylated protein (Table I). ΔG10 is smaller for holo myristoylated protein, suggesting the lower stability of its first intermediate as compared with non-myristoylated NCS-1. The differences were also obvious when the unfolding of apo and holo proteins was compared (Table I). The global ΔG0 for N to D transition was greater in case of holo myristoylated NCS-1 (19.1 kcal mol–1) than non-myristoylated (14.5 kcal mol–1) protein, suggesting that myristoylation increases protein stability and complements the extrinsic stabilizing effect of calcium. When myristoylated and non-myristoylated NCS-1 were compared, we found that myristoylation increased the free energy of unfolding, suggesting that it plays an important role in protein stability.Table IThermodynamic parameters for GdmCl-induced unfolding of myristoylated (Myr) and non-myristoylated (nonmyr) NCS-1 in the presence or absence of calcium monitored by fluorescenceApo-Myr-NCS-1Holo-Myr-NCS-1Apo-nonmyr-NCS-1Holo-nonmyr-NCS-1ΔG102.42 ± 0.26810.3468 ± 0.057762.983 ± 0.32511.013 ± 0.2255m14.758 ± 0.51762.32 ± 0.39355.789 ± 0.61859.888 ± 3.484ΔG205.967 ± 0.79053.355 ± 0.89154.542 ± 0.44871.311 ± 0.5633m21.937 ± 0.25532.397 ± 0.62711.556 ± 0.15281.507 ± 0.6243ΔG307.301 ± 2.246.658 ± 0.71345.41 ± 1.5454.264 ± 0.2441m31.156 ± 0.36012.636 ± 0.27480.8563 ± 0.25371.752 ± 0.09903ΔG408.789 ± 0.69827.922 ± 0.6986m41.614 ± 0.12781.491 ± 0.131Global ΔGN→D015.68 ± 1.4519.14 ± 1.8512.93 ± 0.7114.51 ± 1.6 Open table in a new tab To determine the fractional accumulation of the different species upon GdmCl-induced unfolding, the equilibrium distribution of the four or five species, N, I1, I2, I3 and U, as a function of GdmCl concentration could be reconstituted using the fitted values of ΔG10, ΔG20, ΔG30, m1, m2, and m3 (Fig. 5). As seen from this figure, there was no apparent difference between the apo form of myristoylated and non-myristoylated NCS-1. However, noticeable differences were seen in the f1 and f2 fractions, which were obviously greater in the case of the holo form of myristoylated NCS-1; fn was less in case of myristoylated NCS-1. These results suggest that myristoylation influences the unfolding transitions when calcium is present, whereas myristoylation has a minimal effect on unfolding in the absence of calcium. Sharp Increase in Negative Ellipticity of Holo Non-myristoylated NCS-1 at Subdenaturing GdmCl Concentrations Monitored by Far-UV CD—The unfolding transitions were also followed by monitoring the changes in the far-UV CD spectra of myristoylated and non-myristoylated wild type and their E120Q mutants. In the presence of Ca2+, the negative ellipticity of myristoylated and non-myristoylated NCS-1 increased at a subdenaturing concentration of GdmCl (up to 1 m), with a greater increase in the case of the non-myristoylated protein (25% at 222 nm) as compared with myristoylated NCS-1 (4% at 222 nm) (Fig. 6). The increase in optical activity is seen at the ultra-subdenaturing concentrations (in lower micromolar limits) of GdmCl (Fig. 7a, inset). This increase in the negative value of ellipticity at subdenaturing concentrations of GdmCl was not seen in the absence of calcium (data not shown). The increase in negative value of far-UV CD is also seen in case of E120Q non-myristoylated NCS-1 mutants, albeit comparatively very low (3–4%) (Fig. 7). At higher concentrations of GdmCl, the ellipticity decreased, and finally, the protein was converted to random coil at 6 m GdmCl. In the absence of calcium, the protein is completely unfolded at a much lower concentration (3.5 m).Fig. 7Percentage change in ellipticity at 222 nm with GdmCl in the presence of calcium.a, wild type myristoylated and non-myristoylated NCS-1.

Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). ANS is also used to investigate whether unfolding intermediates are formed. We monitored the change in ANS fluorescence during unfolding (Fig. 8). The fluorescence of the dye in the presence of protein increased with increasing concentration of GdmCl (Fig. 8a) and then declined at higher concentrations with no change in the emission maximum (480 nm). At a concentration of up to 1 m GdmCl, ANS fluorescence increased in both myristoylated and non-myristoylated proteins, suggesting that intermediates with more hydrophobic patches are formed during early unfolding. The increase in fluorescence emission was significantly greater in the non-myristoylated protein than in myristoylated NCS-1 (Fig. 8a), suggesting a greater exposure of hydrophobic residues in the case of non-myristoylated NCS-1 than in myristoylated protein. Because this variation in ANS fluorescence is solely due to myristoylation, it suggests that myristoylation plays a"

However, there are conflicting data concerning the effects of caveolin on insulin receptor expression and function. To help clarify this issue, we created a gain of function situation by expressing caveolin-1 at various levels in HEK-293 cells where the endogenous level of caveolin-1 is very low. We generated four permanent lines of this cell expressing amounts of caveolin-1 ranging from 10 to 40 times that of parental cells. The amount of caveolin-1 in the human embryonic kidney cells expressing the highest caveolin levels is comparable with that of adipocytes, cells that naturally express one of the highest levels of caveolin-1. We measured insulin receptor amount and insulin-dependent receptor autophosphorylation as well as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) tyrosine phosphorylation as an index of insulin signaling. We found that the insulin receptor level was essentially the same in the parental and all four derived cell lines. Likewise, we determined that insulin-dependent insulin receptor and IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation was not significantly different in the four cell lines representing parental, low, medium, and high levels of caveolin-1 expression. We conclude that insulin receptor expression and ligand-dependent signaling is independent of caveolin-1 expression.

Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). An important biochemical feature of caveolae is that they are enriched in free cholesterol by virtue of the fact that caveolin-1 is a cholesterol-binding protein (8.Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 210-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Caveolae are particularly abundant in adipocytes (9.Fan J.Y. Carpentier J.L. van Obberghen E. Grunfeld C. Gorden P. Orci L. J. Cell Sci. 1983; 61: 219-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where they have been postulated to serve as a major site for the initiation of insulin signaling (10.Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). This is a controversial finding, as insulin receptors have been found to be localized in adipocyte caveolae and/or associate with caveolin by some investigators (11.Gustavsson J. Parpal S. Karlsson M. Ramsing C. Thorn H. Borg M. Lindroth M. Peterson K.H. Magnusson K.E. Stralfors P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1961-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 12.Kimura A. Mora S.

Also, caveolin/caveolae have been suggested to play a role in the regulation of insulin signaling by affecting the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) 1The abbreviations used are: IRS1, insulin receptor substrate 1; IR, insulin receptor; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: IRS1, insulin receptor substrate 1; IR, insulin receptor; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. (15.Yamamoto M. Toya Y. Schwencke C. Lisanti M.P. Myers Jr., M.G. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26962-26968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 knock-out animals have been generated that are viable despite vascular abnormalities and, interestingly, have abnormal adipocytes and develop insulin resistance as they age (16.Razani B. Combs T.P. Wang X.B. Frank P.G. Park D.S. Russell R.G. Li M. Tang B. Jelicks L.A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8635-8647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Consequently, Lisanti and colleagues have generated adipocytes from caveolin-1 null fibroblasts in order to better understand the phenotype of the caveolin-1 null animals with regard to their insulin responsiveness and the development of insulin resistance (17.Cohen A.W. Razani B. Wang X.B. Combs T.P. Williams T.M. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C222-C235Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). They found that such adipocytes had reduced insulin receptor levels compared with those of wild type, and they showed that these levels could be restored to normal levels by transfection of caveolin-1. They also determined that this relationship between insulin receptor levels and caveolin might be a more general phenomenon by showing that transient transfection of caveolin-1 in HEK-293 cells leads to an up-regulation of insulin receptor expression (17.Cohen A.W. Razani B. Wang X.B. Combs T.P. Williams T.M. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C222-C235Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However, in similar experimental protocols other investigators have not observed a relationship between caveolin expression and insulin receptor amounts (15.Yamamoto M. Toya Y. Schwencke C. Lisanti M.P. Myers Jr., M.G. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26962-26968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Caveolae are thought to be formed by the tissue-specific expression of three caveolin isoforms (caveolin-1, -2, and -3), and they can be induced to form in tissues lacking caveolae by the ectopic expression of caveolin-1, for example (18.Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 19.Lipardi C. Mora R. Colomer V. Paladino S. Nitsch L. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Zurzolo C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK-293, expresses low to negligible levels of caveolin-1 (20.Wang L. Connelly M.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen H.H. Williams D.L. Brown D.A. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 807-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, we sought to help clarify the relationship of insulin receptor expression/function to that of caveolin-1 expression by creating a number of permanent HEK cell lines with levels of caveolin-1 varying from undetectable to approximately that found in adipocytes. We then determined insulin receptor expression levels and ligand-dependent function. Antibodies and Western Blotting—Antibodies to caveolin-1, flotillin-1, and phosphotyrosine PY20 were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnologies, Lake Placid, NY. Anti-insulin receptor (21.Kublaoui B. Lee J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 59-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and anti-IRS1 antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Jongsoon Lee of the Joslin Diabetes Center, Harvard Medical School. Following SDS-PAGE (22.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206597) Google Scholar), primary antibodies were detected using appropriate secondary antibodies obtained from Sigma and conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) and a chemiluminescence substrate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Quantitative analysis of gel bands was performed by scanning blots with the NIH Image 1.63 software program. Generation of HEK-293 Cell Lines—Mouse caveolin-1α cDNA was produced by reverse transcription PCR from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The cDNA was then inserted into the pcDNA3.1 Hygro vector and transfected into HEK-293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Single colonies were selected using cloning rings (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and each line of HEK-293 cells produced was tested for levels of caveolin-1 expression. Four cell lines were developed from this procedure, each with different expression levels of caveolin-1. The five cell lines used, ranging from those with little to no expression of caveolin-1 to those with high expression of caveolin-1, are parent, D20, D7, A4, and B8 (see Fig. 1). The HEK-293 cell lines expressing different levels of caveolin-1 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA) containing a mixture of penicillin (5000 units/ml) and streptomycin (5000 μg/ml) (Invitrogen). The media were supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), and 5% calf serum (Invitrogen). Isolation of Cell Membranes—A postnuclear membrane preparation from the HEK-293 cells was obtained using the method described previously (23.Schlegel A. Schwab R.B. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22660-22667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lines were grown to confluence, scraped into cold PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4 and 5 mm benzamidine), and pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g. The cells were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors, 1 μm aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, and 5 mm benzamidine. The lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and passed through a 21-gauge needle 10 times and centrifuged at 1000 × g to remove nuclear debris. The postnuclear lysate was then centrifuged at 133,000 × g for 30 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended in PBS with the protease inhibitors noted above. An adipocyte plasma membrane was obtained following the enzymatic isolation of epididymal fat pads as we have described (14.Souto R.P. Vallega G. Wharton J. Vinten J. Tranum-Jensen J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18321-18329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), following the protocol of Simpson et al. (24.Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was estimated using a BCA kit (Pierce). Cholesterol Determination—The assays were performed as outlined previously (25.Tercyak A. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1991; 2: 282-292Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, total and free cholesterol were determined by extracting lipids from HEK cells by the Folch method (26.Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lipid phase was hydrolyzed by KOH and ethanol, and a colorimetric assay was used for quantitative analysis. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed for the insulin receptor (IR) (21.Kublaoui B. Lee J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 59-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and IRS1 (27.Whiteman E.L. Birnbaum M.J. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 83: 119-126PubMed Google Scholar) as described in the respective references. Cell membranes (IR) or cell lysates (IRS1) were incubated in buffer (30 mm Hepes and 150 mm NaCl supplemented with 3 μm aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, 5 μm pepstatin, 5 mm benzamidine, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm ammonium molybdate, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 30 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, and 5 mm EGTA, all adjusted to pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and an anti-IR or anti-IRS1 antibody for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by a 1-h incubation with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. Pellets were washed and eluted with 1× Laemmli sample buffer containing 2% SDS and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Blots were probed with a mixture of 4G10 and PY20 or anti-IR and anti-IRS1. Immunofluorescence—HEK cells were grown in 6-well tissue culture plates containing poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips (BD Biosciences) for 48 h. Cells were then washed one time with PBS and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and then washed two more times with PBS. Cells were blocked and permeabilized by incubation with buffer P (5% donkey serum (Sigma), 5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 20 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were incubated for 2 h with rabbit anti-caveolin-1 antibody at a dilution of 1:250 in buffer P at room temperature. Four more washes with buffer P were then performed, and the cells were covered in aluminum foil and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with an anti-rabbit Cy3 secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove PA) at a dilution of 1:250. Again, the cells were washed four times with PBS and then mounted with a glycerol/PBS solution (component A of the SlowFade antifade kit from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The stained cells were observed with a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu Photonics camera for standard immunofluorescence. Fig. 1A shows, by Western blotting, the expression levels of caveolin-1, the insulin receptor, and the lipid raft protein flotillin in parental HEK cells and in four cell lines transfected with caveolin-1 cDNA and then selected for different levels of caveolin-1 expression. Caveolin-1 expression varies from 10- to 40-fold higher in these four cell lines than in the parental cells (Fig. 1B), which contain barely detectable levels of caveolin. On the other hand, the insulin receptor levels are essentially the same in all five cell lines, as is the expression of flotillin (Fig. 1, A and B), which was included as a control for the possible effects of caveolin-1 expression on another protein known to be a component of lipid rafts (28.Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E. Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13793-13802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). To determine the localization of expressed caveolin-1, immunofluorescence was performed using an anti-caveolin-1 antibody. Fig. 2 shows the immunofluorescence of HEK cell line B8 expressing a relatively high level of caveolin-1 as compared with that of parental HEK cells. The caveolin-1-expressing HEK cell line, B8, shows expression of caveolin-1 on the surface of cells, whereas the parental HEK cells show no detectable caveolin-1 expression by this technique. To determine whether there was a functional consequence of caveolin-1 expression in the transfected cells, we measured free cholesterol as shown in Table I. All transfected cells show increased free cholesterol with the two highest expressers exhibiting a statistically significant 78 and 69% increase, respectively, in free cholesterol as compared with the parental cell line. Because caveolin-1 is a cholesterol-binding protein (8.Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 210-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and free cholesterol is predominantly present at the plasma membrane (29.Pichler H. Riezman H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1666: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), these results are consistent with expectations and with the caveolin-1 fluorescence data of Fig. 2.Table IFree cholesterol content of HEK cellsCell lineFree cholesterolμg/mg proteinParental23.7 ± 2.1D2026.4 ± 1.0D726.6 ± 2.3A442.3 ± 3.9ap < 0.05; Student's t test.B840.1 ± 6.5ap < 0.05; Student's t test.a p < 0.05; Student's t test. Open table in a new tab We next determined if the level of caveolin-1 in HEK cells expressing the highest amount of caveolin-1 was comparable with caveolin levels in adipocytes, the cell type in which most studies of the relationship between insulin receptors and caveolae have been performed. Using Western blotting with an anti-caveolin-1 antibody, we compared total membrane preparations from the HEK cells with a rat adipocyte plasma membrane preparation. As shown in Fig. 3, caveolin-1 expression in a 25-μg sample from HEK cells is the same as that in a 5-μg sample from rat adipocytes. The purity of the membrane preparation with regard to cell surface markers is >90% for adipocytes (24.Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and ∼30% for the HEK cells shown. This corresponds to cell surface caveolin-1 levels in the HEK cell line B8 that are at least 60% of that in adipocytes; in other words, a high level of caveolin-1 expression is consistent with its possible biochemical/physiological significance. We measured receptor autophosphorylation following cellular exposure to insulin in four of the cell lines corresponding to low, medium, and high levels of caveolin-1 expression, as well as in the parental cells. As shown in Fig. 4, following immunoprecipitation of phosphorylated receptor and blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, there are no significant differences in receptor autophosphorylation in the cell lines tested and no differences in the overall levels of the insulin receptor (see also Fig. 1). Finally, we measured insulin-dependent phosphorylation of IRS1 to determine whether downstream receptor signaling was affected by caveolin as has been suggested (15.Yamamoto M. Toya Y. Schwencke C. Lisanti M.P. Myers Jr., M.G. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26962-26968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Again we found this not to be the case (Fig. 5), indicating that the cell surface kinase activity of the receptor was not affected by any presumptive interaction with caveolin-1.Fig. 5Insulin-dependent IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation is the same in cells expressing different levels of caveolin-1. HEK cells were treated with insulin (100 nm) or vehicle for 5 min before total membranes were isolated. Proteins were immunoprecipitated using an anti-IRS1 antibody as described under “Materials and Methods,” separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with a mixture of the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies PY20 and 4G10 (P-tyr-IR; top) or IRS1 (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The association with and phosphorylation of caveolin-1 by the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Src, was the basis of the discovery of caveolin-1 as Vip21 (30.Glenney Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20163-20166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the putative association of caveolin with and phosphorylation by other non-receptor and receptor tyrosine kinases has been described in many studies (reviewed in Ref. 31.Pike L.J. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 655-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). The association of non-receptor tyrosine kinases of the Src family with lipid raft domains, including caveolae, is likely to be a result of their myristoylation, which allows their association with relatively structured lipid raft membrane domains, whereas the transmembrane sequences of receptor tyrosine kinases are likely to be excluded from lipid rafts such as caveolae, as has been predicted by studies of model systems (32.Fastenberg M.E. Shogomori H. Xu X. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12376-12390Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Indeed, in cultured adipocytes, which express robust levels of caveolin-1, the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 observed upon activation of the insulin receptor was first described as indirect and resulting from the action of Fyn, a member of the Src kinase family, and not directly by insulin receptors (13.Mastick C.C. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). This paper describes cell fractionation protocols to biochemically purify caveolae and reports that the majority of the insulin receptor was excluded from the “floating” fraction of the caveolae enriched in caveolin (13.Mastick C.C. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, this result was reassessed by some of the same investigators who subsequently reached the opposite conclusion that the interaction of caveolin and the insulin receptor was direct based on their co-fractionation in discontinuous sucrose gradients (12.Kimura A. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30153-30158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Additional biochemical and/or morphological studies in adipocytes have also provided conflicting results favoring or not favoring a direct interaction between caveolae and the insulin receptor. Morphological (electron microscopy) and biochemical analysis of rat adipocytes suggested the co-localization of insulin receptor with caveolae (11.Gustavsson J. Parpal S. Karlsson M. Ramsing C. Thorn H. Borg M. Lindroth M. Peterson K.H. Magnusson K.E. Stralfors P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1961-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we also used both electron microscopy and an immunoaffinity protocol to rapidly isolate caveolae, and we did not detect any insulin receptor in caveolae by either method (14.Souto R.P. Vallega G. Wharton J. Vinten J. Tranum-Jensen J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18321-18329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We speculate that the reasons for these discrepancies in biochemical analysis most likely lie in the methods used in these various studies, as we have discussed in detail (14.Souto R.P. Vallega G. Wharton J. Vinten J. Tranum-Jensen J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18321-18329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). That is, the time and manipulations required in many protocols of caveolae isolation are factors that are likely to produce artifacts concerning caveolae protein content. The discrepancies in the morphological results are more difficult to explain, although the association of membrane proteins with caveolae can be an artifact of the techniques used (33.Maxfield F.R. Mayor S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 419: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Moreover, the observation that transmembrane sequences such as those found in the insulin receptor do not partition into the lipid raft domains characteristic of caveolae (32.Fastenberg M.E. Shogomori H. Xu X. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12376-12390Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and the observation that caveolae are non-dynamic structures (34.Thomsen P. Roepstorff K. Stahlhut M. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) in the time frame of the trafficking/endocytosis of the insulin receptor through clathrin-coated pits (14.Souto R.P. Vallega G. Wharton J. Vinten J. Tranum-Jensen J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18321-18329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 35.Pilch P.F. Shia M.A. Benson R.J. Fine R.E.

Traffic. 2001; 2: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) makes it seem unlikely to us that adipocyte insulin receptors are localized or associate with caveolae Nevertheless, as an independent means addressing the relationship between caveolin-1 and insulin receptors independent of adipocytes, experiments have been performed in cell lines where one can alter the amount of caveolin-1 and determine the functional consequences, if any, of these alterations for signaling from the insulin receptor. In this context, the recent report by Cohen et al. (17.Cohen A.W. Razani B. Wang X.B. Combs T.P. Williams T.M. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C222-C235Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) documenting effects of caveolin-1 expression on insulin receptor levels was surprising. These investigators showed that insulin receptor levels are diminished in an adipocyte cell line derived from caveolin-1 null animals but that the receptor levels could be increased by the re-introduction of caveolin-1. We have measured the levels of insulin receptors and caveolin-1 in various adipocyte cell lines such as those described in Refs. 37.El-Jack A.K. Hamm J.K. Pilch P.F. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar and 38.Gross D.N. Farmer S.R. Pilch P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7151-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, which express these proteins to different extents, and we see no correlation between the two (data not shown). These researchers observed similar results using HEK cells transfected with caveolin-1, albeit they employed transient transfection protocols and described a single result that confirmed their data obtained with caveolin-1 null adipocytes. On the other hand, Yamamoto et al. (15.Yamamoto M. Toya Y. Schwencke C. Lisanti M.P. Myers Jr., M.G. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26962-26968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) previously found no effect of caveolin-3 expression on insulin receptor levels or receptor autophosphorylation in transiently transfected HEK cells but did observe a small increase in IRS1 phosphorylation in the transfected cells that they considered significant. Peptides derived from caveolins-1 and -3 were also found to stimulate insulin-dependent IRS1 phosphorylation. These authors (15.Yamamoto M. Toya Y. Schwencke C. Lisanti M.P. Myers Jr., M.G. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26962-26968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) attributed these results to a direct interaction of caveolin with the insulin receptor's kinase domain. However, the receptor sequences they mapped as interacting with caveolin are not obviously accessible to other proteins based on the crystal structure of the kinase domain (39.Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar), thus clouding the interpretation of these studies. Thus, we report here the use of four stable cell lines expressing caveolin-1 at various levels, the highest two approaching that seen in adipocytes. The insulin receptor amount and ligand-dependent activation of its kinase activity, as well as the phosphorylation of its major substrate IRS1, is essentially the same in all of the cell lines and in the non-transfected parental cells. As noted previously, there is no obvious reason why caveolin levels should effect the expression of insulin receptors. These receptors are highly expressed and function perfectly well in the important insulin target cells of the liver where caveolin expression is minimal (40.Vainio S. Heino S. Mansson J.E. Fredman P. Kuismanen E. Vaarala O. Ikonen E. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We conclude that caveolin-1 expression has no effect on insulin receptor expression or function as determined by gain of function experiments in HEK cells, and, for reasons noted above, we believe this is likely to be true for the real insulin target cells of fat and muscle. We thank Dr. Jongsoon Lee, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA for reagents and help with immunoprecipitation assays."
https://openalex.org/W2010703316,"In this paper, we show that in vitro xanthosine does not enter any of the pathways known to salvage the other three main natural purine nucleosides: guanosine; inosine; and adenosine. In rat brain extracts and in intact LoVo cells, xanthosine is salvaged to XMP via the phosphotransferase activity of cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase. IMP is the preferred phosphate donor (IMP + xanthosine → XMP + inosine). XMP is not further phosphorylated. However, in the presence of glutamine, it is readily converted to guanyl compounds. Thus, phosphorylation of xanthosine by cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase circumvents the activity of IMP dehydrogenase, a rate-limiting enzyme, catalyzing the NAD+-dependent conversion of IMP to XMP at the branch point of de novo nucleotide synthesis, thus leading to the generation of guanine nucleotides. Mycophenolic acid, an inhibitor of IMP dehydrogenase, inhibits the guanyl compound synthesis via the IMP dehydrogenase pathway but has no effect on the cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase pathway of guanine nucleotides synthesis. We propose that the latter pathway might contribute to the reversal of the in vitro antiproliferative effect exerted by IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors routinely seen with repletion of the guanine nucleotide pools. In this paper, we show that in vitro xanthosine does not enter any of the pathways known to salvage the other three main natural purine nucleosides: guanosine; inosine; and adenosine. In rat brain extracts and in intact LoVo cells, xanthosine is salvaged to XMP via the phosphotransferase activity of cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase. IMP is the preferred phosphate donor (IMP + xanthosine → XMP + inosine). XMP is not further phosphorylated. However, in the presence of glutamine, it is readily converted to guanyl compounds. Thus, phosphorylation of xanthosine by cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase circumvents the activity of IMP dehydrogenase, a rate-limiting enzyme, catalyzing the NAD+-dependent conversion of IMP to XMP at the branch point of de novo nucleotide synthesis, thus leading to the generation of guanine nucleotides. Mycophenolic acid, an inhibitor of IMP dehydrogenase, inhibits the guanyl compound synthesis via the IMP dehydrogenase pathway but has no effect on the cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase pathway of guanine nucleotides synthesis. We propose that the latter pathway might contribute to the reversal of the in vitro antiproliferative effect exerted by IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors routinely seen with repletion of the guanine nucleotide pools. A wealth of in vitro and in vivo evidence supports the idea that some cell types and districts, such as human red cells and brain, rely more heavily on the salvage pathway rather than on de novo pathway synthesis of nucleotides (1.Allsop J.

In addition, the salvage pathway is responsible for the activation of many purine and pyrimidine analogs to cytotoxic compounds (5.Chabner B.A. Chabner B.A. Longo D.L. Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotheraphy. Lippincot-Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA1995: 235-252Google Scholar). Even though some differences might exist among different cell types, it can be assumed that, in mammals, inosine and guanosine must undergo prior phosphorolysis by purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) 1The abbreviations used are: PNP, purine nucleoside phosphorylase; HGPRT, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase; Xao, xanthosine; cN-II, cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase; IMPDH, IMP dehydrogenase; 2,3-BPG, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate; MPA, mycophenolic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PEI, polyethyleneimine; XMP, xanthosine 5′-monophosphate; IMP, inosine 5′-monophosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: PNP, purine nucleoside phosphorylase; HGPRT, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase; Xao, xanthosine; cN-II, cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase; IMPDH, IMP dehydrogenase; 2,3-BPG, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate; MPA, mycophenolic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PEI, polyethyleneimine; XMP, xanthosine 5′-monophosphate; IMP, inosine 5′-monophosphate. in order to be salvaged to their respective nucleoside monophosphates by the PRPP-mediated hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) reaction (the PNP-HGPRT pathway). Adenosine is either directly phosphorylated to AMP by a specific kinase or salvaged as inosine after deamination at low and high micromolar levels, respectively (6.Latini S. Pedata F. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 463-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). No kinase activity exists for inosine and guanosine (7.Stone T.W. Simmonds H.A. Purine: Basic and Clinical Aspects. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1991: 8-22Google Scholar). To our knowledge, the possible anabolic salvage route(s) of the fourth natural purine nucleoside, xanthosine (Xao), have not been equally extensively studied. Our interest on the salvage of this nucleoside was raised by recent reports (8.Gille A. Wenzel-Seifert K. Doughty M.B. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7822-7828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 9.Liu H.Y. Seifert R. Biochem.

Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 348-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), indicating that Xao phosphates interact with β2-adrenergic G protein-coupled receptors. In this paper, we show that in vitro Xao is not phosphorylated by any ATP-mediated nucleoside kinase present in rat brain cytosolic extract. Neither can it be salvaged via the PNP-HGPRT pathway. Rather, it is anabolyzed through a new salvage synthesis where the phosphotransferase activity of the IMP-GMP-specific cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase (cN-II) (IMP + H2O → inosine + Pi) plays a pivotal role and circumvents that of IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH). Materials—[8-14C]IMP (53 mCi/mmol), [8-14C]inosine (52 mCi/mmol), and [8-14C]Xao (55 mCi/mmol) were from Moravek Biochemicals. [8-14C]Adenosine (58 mCi/mmol), [8-14C]guanine (53.3 mCi/mmol), 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG), glutamine, mycophenolic acid (MPA), dithiothreitol (DTT), bases, nucleosides, and nucleotides were from Sigma. Ham's F-12 medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) without glucose, and fetal calf serum were from Invitrogen. [8-14C]Guanosine was prepared from [8-14C]guanine. 1.9 mm [8-14C]guanine (50,000 dpm/nmol) was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 8 mm ribose 1-phosphate, 1.5 units of PNP, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 in a final volume of 300 μl. After 2 h of incubation, the reaction was stopped by heating the mixture for 5 min at 100 °C. The mixture then was applied to a polyethyleneimine (PEI)-cellulose-precoated thinlayer plastic sheet and developed with 0.1 mm (NH4)2SO4. The zone corresponding to guanosine was excised and eluted with 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Cold guanosine then was added to reach a final concentration of 3.67 mm. The final [8-14C]guanosine prepared had a specific activity of 5000 dpm/nmol. Bovine recombinant cN-II was prepared as described previously (11.Allegrini S. Pesi R. Tozzi M.G. Fiol C.J. Johnson R.B. Eriksson S. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The human colon carcinoma cell line, LoVo, was provided by Dr. O. Sanfilippo (Milan, Italy). Hi Safe II scintillation liquid was purchased from Wallac. PEI-cellulose-precoated thin-layer plastic sheets (0.1-mm thick) were purchased from Merck and pre-washed once with 10% NaCl and three times with deionized water before use. All of the other chemicals were of reagent grade. Preparation of Rat Brain Extracts—Three-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (250 g) were sacrificed by decapitation. Procedures involving animals and their care were conducted in conformity with the institutional guidelines that are in compliance with national and international laws and policies. The brains were removed and kept frozen at –80 °C until needed. Storage times did not exceed 3 months. The brain was cut in small pieces, washed with cold saline, and gently homogenized with a hand-driven Potter homogenizer in 3 volumes of 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, with 20 mm KCl and 1 mm DTT. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4 °C at 39,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant fluid obtained was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in dialysis bags against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with 1 mm DTT, and is referred to as crude extract. The preparation, which is devoid of plasma membranes, nuclei, and mitochondria, proved to be extremely useful in studies on rat brain purine and pyrimidine salvage synthesis (3.Cappiello M. Mascia L.

Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2214-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the Coomassie Blue binding assay using bovine serum albumin as standard (14.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214515) Google Scholar). Cell Cultures and Preparation of Cell Extracts—Cells were routinely grown as a monolayer in Ham's F-12 medium with 7% fetal calf serum and antibiotics at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere (standard medium). The doubling time was 32 h. For the preparation of cell extracts, when cells were in the logarithmic phase of growth, the monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and the cells were scraped off with a cell scraper, collected, and centrifuged at 800 × g for 3 min. The pellets were resuspended in ∼3 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, subjected to ultrasonic treatment, and then centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant, the cell extract, was kept at –80 °C. cN-II-mediated XMP and Guanine Nucleotide Synthesis—To follow XMP formation from Xao, the reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 1.4 mm [8-14C]Xao (9000 dpm/nmol), 2 mm IMP, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2,3-BPG, and brain extract (2 mg of protein/ml) or LoVo cell extract (1 mg of protein/ml). To follow also guanine nucleotide synthesis, 2,3-BPG was substituted with ATP, which acts as cN-II activator and as substrate of GMP synthetase and nucleoside monophosphokinase and diphosphokinase. Modifications of the incubation mixtures are indicated in the figure legends. The reaction was started by the addition of crude extract. At different time intervals, the reaction was stopped by rapidly drying portions of 10 μl of the incubation mixture on PEI-cellulose-precoated thin-layer plastic sheets and a chromatogram was developed in n-propyl alcohol/NH3/trichloroacetic acid (100%)/H2O (75:0.7:5:20, v/v) to separate XMP, GMP, and GDP + GTP. In the separation, appropriate standards were used and detected as UV absorbing areas, which were excised and counted for radioactivity with 8 ml of scintillation liquid. IMPDH-mediated XMP and Guanine Nucleotides Synthesis—To follow XMP formation, the reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 2 mm [8-14C]IMP (3,000 dpm/nmol), 1 mm NAD+, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm KCl, and rat brain extract (2 mg of protein/ml) or LoVo cell extract (1 mg of protein/ml). When guanine nucleotide synthesis was also followed, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, and 5 mm glutamine were added. Modifications of the incubation mixture are indicated in the figure legends. The reaction was started by the addition of crude extract. At different time intervals, the reaction was stopped by rapidly drying portions of 10 μl of the incubation mixture on PEI-cellulose-precoated thin-layer plastic sheets and the chromatogram was developed in n-propyl alcohol/NH3/trichloroacetic acid (100%)/H2O (75:0.7:5: 20, v/v) to separate Xao, GMP, and GDP + GTP and with (NH4)2SO4 0.1 mm to identify XMP. In the separation, appropriate standards were used and detected as UV-absorbing areas, which were excised and counted for radioactivity with 8 ml of scintillation liquid. Incorporation of Xao and Analysis of Intracellular Metabolites in LoVo Cells—The experiments of Xao incorporation were performed in 35-mm culture plates (∼900,000 cells). Each plate was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and 500 μl of serum-free DMEM with 10 mm glucose were added. LoVo cells were incubated in triplicate with 50 μm [8-14C]Xao (30,000 dpm/nmol). After the incubations, the cells were washed twice with 2 ml of cold physiological solution containing 1 mm Xao. 100 μl of 0.5 mm trichloroacetic acid were added to each plate, and cells were maintained at 4 °C. Subsequently, cells were harvested using a cell scraper and the suspension was heated at 70 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 2 min. The supernatants (∼100 μl) were all spotted on PEI-cellulose-precoated thin-layer plastic sheets. Xao, XMP, GMP, and GDP + GTP were separated and detected as described under “cN-II-mediated XMP and Guanine Nucleotide Synthesis.” Xao Is Phosphorylated by IMP, Not by ATP, in Rat Brain—A possible step, which would account for Xao salvage, is Xao phosphorylation as catalyzed by ATP-mediated cytosolic nucleoside kinases. However, at least in rat brain, this does not appear to be the case. Fig. 1 shows that the formation of XMP in the presence of 3.6 mm ATP, a physiological concentration (15.Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar), was preceded by a lag period. A possible explanation is that a phosphorylated catabolite of ATP, rather than ATP itself, acts as phosphate donor and that an enzyme distinct from nucleoside kinases catalyzes the reaction. The most likely candidates are IMP and cN-II, respectively. This hypothesis, which we had put forward in a previous study on purine salvage in rat brain (4.Barsotti C. Tozzi M.G. Ipata P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9865-9869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), is in accord with the following observations. (i) When ATP was substituted with IMP at equimolar concentration, the time course of XMP formation did not show any appreciable lag period and a larger amount of XMP was formed. (ii) At ATP concentrations as high as 100 μm (Fig. 1), compatible with the Km values of nucleoside kinases (16.Yamada Y. Goto H. Ogasawara N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 616: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17.Momparler R.L. Fischer G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 4298-4304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no Xao phosphorylation could be detected. Interestingly, at these relatively low concentrations, ATP breakdown follows the “adenosine pathway” with little if any IMP formation, whereas at a concentration of 3.6 mm, ATP breakdown follows the “IMP pathway,” with IMP itself as the major final product (13.Barsotti C. Ipata P.L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2214-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). XMP was not further phosphorylated by the ATP present in the reaction mixture. We propose that Xao should be added to guanosine and inosine among those nucleosides that do not act as kinase substrates in mammals (7.Stone T.W. Simmonds H.A. Purine: Basic and Clinical Aspects. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1991: 8-22Google Scholar, 18.Barsotti C. Pesi R. Felice F. Ipata P.L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 786-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The cN-II possesses both a phosphatase activity (IMP + H2O → inosine + Pi) and a purine nucleoside phosphotransferase activity (IMP + a purine-nucleoside → inosine + a purine-nucleoside monophosphate). Even though the molecular, kinetic, and regulatory properties of cN-II have been extensively studied in our laboratory (19.Pesi R. Turriani M. Allegrini S. Scolozzi C. Camici M. Ipata P.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20.Pesi R. Baiocchi C. Tozzi M.G. Camici M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1294: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the physiological role of its phosphotransferase activity remains an enigma. The enzyme is responsible for the in vivo and in vitro activation of a series of antineoplastic and antiviral nucleoside analogs such as 2′-3′-dideoxyinosine, acyclovir, and 8-azaguanosine (21.Turriani M. Pesi R. Nardone A. Turchi G. Sgarrella F. Ipata P.L. Tozzi M.G. J. Biochem. Toxicol. 1994; 9: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but its activity on intracellular natural nucleosides has not been documented. Our results suggest that the phosphotransferase activity of cN-II is responsible for the IMP-mediated Xao salvage in rat brain (the cN-II pathway). As shown in Table I, IMP-mediated Xao phosphorylation is strongly dependent on 2,3-BPG and ATP, the two allosteric activators of cN-II, and on Mg2+ ions. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2, IMP and GMP were the best phosphate donors followed by UMP and CMP, in accord with the substrate specificity of the enzyme (19.Pesi R. Turriani M. Allegrini S. Scolozzi C. Camici M. Ipata P.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Most probably, AMP acts as phosphate donor after being deaminated to IMP. Finally, the availability of bovine recombinant cN-II in our laboratory (11.Allegrini S. Pesi R. Tozzi M.G. Fiol C.J. Johnson R.B. Eriksson S. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) allowed us to show that indeed Xao is a substrate of this enzyme (data not shown).Table IIMP-mediated Xao phosphorylation requirementsAdditionXMP10 min30 minnmol/mg proteinComplete systemaThe complete system contained 1.4 mm [8-14C]Xao, 2 mm IMP, 5 mm 2,3-BPG, 10 mm MgCl2, 1mm DTT, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and rat brain extract (2 mg of protein/ml).2.247.57No 2,3-BPG0.641.77No MgCl20.291.75No 2,3-BPG, no MgCl20.450.65ATP instead of 2,3-BPG2.708.29a The complete system contained 1.4 mm [8-14C]Xao, 2 mm IMP, 5 mm 2,3-BPG, 10 mm MgCl2, 1mm DTT, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and rat brain extract (2 mg of protein/ml). Open table in a new tab Xao Is Not Salvaged via the PNP-HGPRT Pathway—Another possible pathway for Xao salvage would be that catalyzed by the PNP-HGPRT pathway. Fig. 3 shows that, contrary to inosine, adenosine, and guanosine, Xao cannot be salvaged via this pathway. We notice that (ii) Xao is a substrate of rat brain PNP (12.Giorgelli F. Bottai C. Mascia L. Scolozzi C. Camici M. Ipata P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1335: 16-22Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) but that any xanthine formed was not anabolyzed to XMP by the PRPP present in the reaction mixture (22.Jardim A. Bergeson S.E. Shih S. Carter N. Lucas R.W. Merlin G. Myler P.J. Stuart K. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34403-34410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), (ii) the low amount of GMP formed from guanine is probably due to the high guanase activity in rat brain (23.Berger S.J. Carter J.G. Lowry O.H. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 1736-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 24.Paletzki R.F. Neuroscience. 2002; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which prevents guanine from being anabolyzed to its nucleoside monophosphate, and iii) the main product of adenosine salvage was IMP, not AMP, due to the presence of adenosine deaminase in rat brain (6.Latini S. Pedata F. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 463-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). The absence of adenosine phosphorylase (7.Stone T.W. Simmonds H.A. Purine: Basic and Clinical Aspects. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1991: 8-22Google Scholar) prevents any formation of AMP from adenine by adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, and the virtual absence of xanthine oxidase (25.Markley H.G. Faillace L.A. Mezey E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 309: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) prevents the further catabolic breakdown of xanthine to uric acid. We propose that any xanthine produced in the central nervous system via Xao phosphorolysis or guanine deamination is exported to other tissues and organs to be further catabolyzed. Xao Can Be Anabolyzed to GTP via the cN-II-mediated Pathway—The major source of XMP in mammalian cells is the NAD+-mediated reduction of IMP catalyzed by IMPDH, an enzyme targeted for human antiviral, immunosuppressive, and antineoplastic chemotherapy (26.Zimmermann A.G. Gu J.J. Laliberte J. Mitchell B.S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 181-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Pankiewicz K.W. Patterson S.E. Black P.L. Jayaram H.N. Risal D. Goldstein B.M. Stuyver L.J. Schinazi R.F. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 887-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Indeed, Fig. 4A shows that rat brain extract can efficiently convert IMP into XMP in the presence of NAD+. Dephosphorylation of XMP to Xao follows. However, as shown in Fig. 4B, the addition of glutamine and ATP in the reaction mixture considerably prevented XMP dephosphorylation. Rather, XMP was mainly converted to GMP, and GDP + GTP, via IMPDH, GMP synthetases, and nucleoside monophosphokinase and diphosphokinase. There is no doubt that this is the main pathway for the synthesis of guanine nucleotides in rat brain. Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. 5, the simple substitution of NAD+ with Xao resulted into XMP formation followed by GMP and GDP + GTP. In this pathway, cN-II bypasses IMPDH activity. Fig. 6 shows the interplay between the cN-II pathway and the IMPDH pathway for the synthesis of guanine nucleotides in rat brain. The in vitro efficiency of the cN-II pathway as judged from the amount of nucleotides formed ([XMP] + [guanine nucleotides]) at 60 min of incubation was ∼20% as that of the IMPDH pathway. We emphasize that, in our experimental conditions, ATP acts both as an allosteric activator of cN-II and a substrate of GMP synthetase and of nucleoside monophosphokinase and diphosphokinase.Fig. 5Time course of cN-II-mediated Xao salvage into guanine nucleotides catalyzed by rat brain extract.

Moreover, whereas the IMPDH-mediated synthesis of guanyl compounds is considerably lowered by MPA, an inhibitor of the IMPDH (28.Eugui E.M. Almquist S.J. Muller C.D. Allison A.C. J.

The Xao salvage pathway proposed by us works in cultured cells. Fig. 8 shows that Xao can be transported into LoVo cells via an apparent equilibrative mechanism where it is converted into XMP and guanine nucleotides as just seen with cell extract (Fig. 7). The amount of purine nucleotide metabolites (XMP + GMP + GDP + GTP) formed intracellularly was ∼20% Xao transported.Fig. 8[8-14C]Xao incorporation into LoVo cells at different times. LoVo cells were incubated in triplicate with 50 μm [8-14C]Xao at the time intervals indicated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Up to 90 min of incubation, nucleotide production was proportional to Xao uptake with r2 factor for a regression curve (least square) of 0.939.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Reversal of the in vitro antiproliferative effect exerted by IMPDH inhibitors has been observed with repletion of the guanine nucleotide pools as catalyzed by the HGPRT reaction (guanine + PRPP → GMP + PPi), which indirectly circumvents the action of IMPDH (Fig. 6). We propose that, in addition to this enzyme activity, also the phosphotransferase activity of cN-II on Xao might circumvent the activity of IMPDH. The IMPDH pathway may also be bypassed by the phosphotransferase activity of cN-II with IMP as phosphate donor and guanosine as phosphate acceptor (IMP + guanosine → GMP + inosine) (Fig. 6) (19.Pesi R. Turriani M. Allegrini S. Scolozzi C. Camici M. Ipata P.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Xao is present in human serum at a concentration comparable to that of adenosine (30.Niwa T. Takeda N. Yoshizumi H. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 1801-1806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Its level specifically increases in patients with chronic renal failure (30.Niwa T. Takeda N. Yoshizumi H. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 1801-1806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Moreover, as observed for other purine nucleosides (31.Phillis J.W. O'Regan M.H. Estevez A.Y. Song D. VanderHeide S.J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1525-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), its level might well increase in anoxic conditions since Xao accumulates in rat brain extract during GTP (13.Barsotti C.

It is noteworthy that IMP, the preferred phosphate donor to Xao, accumulates during ATP breakdown in anoxic-like conditions (4.Barsotti C. Tozzi M.G. Ipata P.L. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2214-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It might be speculated that, as it occurs for the other purine and pyrimidine nucleosides, the process of Xao salvage is particularly active during the reperfusion period. Moreover, Stoychev et al. (33.Stoychev G. Kierdaszuk B. Shugar D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4048-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have recently shown that, even at 8 mm Pi, phosphorolysis of Xao levels off at 83% conversion because of the equilibrium with the reverse synthetic pathway (33.Stoychev G. Kierdaszuk B. Shugar D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4048-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that still unexplored pathways might exist for salvaging nucleosides, which might circumvent the activity of enzymes targeted for antiproliferative therapy."

Mutation of β3 tyrosine residue 747, previously shown to disrupt cell adhesion, results in sustained activation of Cdc42 and diminished Rac and Rho activity. We investigated the role of the hematopoietically restricted guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav1 in αvβ3-mediated adhesion. We find that Vav1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac and Rho, associates with αvβ3 upon cell adhesion to vitronectin and that this association requires β3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Expression of exogenous Vav1 demonstrates that Y160F, but not wild type or the Vav1Y174F mutant, inhibits Rac and Rho activation during αvβ3-mediated cell adhesion to vitronectin. Cells expressing Vav1Y160F exhibit a sustained Cdc42 activation similar to nonphosphorylatable β3 mutants. In addition, cytoskeletal reorganization and cell adhesion are severely suppressed in Vav1Y160F-transfected cells, and Vav1Y160F fails to associate with β3 integrins. Furthermore, Vav1 itself is selectively phosphorylated upon tyrosine 160 after αvβ3-mediated adhesion, and the association between Vav1 and β3 occurs in specific response to adhesion to substrate. These studies describe a phosphorylation-dependent association between β3 integrin and Vav1 which is essential for cell progression to a Rho-dominant phenotype during cell adhesion.

These studies describe a phosphorylation-dependent association between β3 integrin and Vav1 which is essential for cell progression to a Rho-dominant phenotype during cell adhesion. The ultimate fate of integrin receptor complexes in adherent cells is their association with the actin cytoskeleton. Although enzymatically inactive, integrins sequester and/or recruit several classes of signaling and adaptor molecules to interaction domains within their cytoplasmic tails, forming functional signaling complexes. One purpose of these complexes is initiation of actin cytoskeletal linkage. In cells that circulate in the vasculature or in tissues during immune surveillance, the assembly of integrin signaling complexes is regulated to prevent unwarranted adhesion that could lead to inappropriate inflammation or thrombosis. We have previously defined one such regulated signal pathway in the αvβ3-mediated adhesion of hematopoietic cells (1Butler B. Williams M.P. Blystone S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5264-5270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Adhesion to vitronectin mediated by the integrin αvβ3 in hematopoietic cells requires phosphorylation of tyrosine 747 of the β3 cytoplasmic tail (2Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This signaling event leads to activation of the small GTPase Rho in a Syk- and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent manner (1Butler B. Williams M.P. Blystone S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5264-5270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Rho activation is required for hematopoietic αvβ3-mediated adhesion and the corresponding formation of actin stress fibers. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 747 of β3 is also required for localization of the actin nucleation complex Arp2/3 to β3 adhesion sites (3Chandhoke S.K. Williams M. Schaefer E. Zorn L. Blystone S.D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1431-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Blockade of Rho activity or its downstream effector ROCK prevents both cell adhesion and the formation of actin stress fibers (1Butler B. Williams M.P. Blystone S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5264-5270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 4Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 285: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). It has been reported and is well characterized that activation of Rho family GTPases is involved in the formation of cytoskeletal structures. For example, Rho activation induces stress fiber formation, Rac activation induces lamellipodia formation, and Cdc42 activation induces filopodia formation (5Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3682) Google Scholar). Rho family GTPases execute their functions by regulating downstream effector proteins such as ROCK and PAK and are themselves subject to upstream regulation. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; EGFP, enhanced GFP; GDI, GDP dissociation inhibitor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBD, p21 binding domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PSSA, phospho-site-specific antibody; RBD, Rho binding domain; Vn, vitronectin.1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; EGFP, enhanced GFP; GDI, GDP dissociation inhibitor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBD, p21 binding domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PSSA, phospho-site-specific antibody; RBD, Rho binding domain; Vn, vitronectin. participate in the regulation of Rho activity by accelerating the exchange reaction rate between the nucleotide-free and nucleotide-occupied states of these GTPases (6Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Among the GEFs that have been identified thus far, the Vav protein family is a novel group that can promote the Rho/Rac, but not the Cdc42, family transition from the inactive state to the active state (7Movilla N. Dosil M. Zheng Y. Bustelo X.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8057-8065Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Vav proteins contain seven domains, including a calponin homology domain, an acidic domain, Dbl homology region in which the catalytic activity resides, an adjacent pleckstrin domain, one zinc finger domain, two Src homology 3 domains, and an Src homology 2 domain (8Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The Vav family of GEFs has three members: Vav1, Vav2, and Vav3 (9Bustelo X.R. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1996; 7: 65-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 10Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Vav1 expression is only detected in cells of hematopoietic origin, whereas Vav3 has broader tissue expression, and Vav2 is expressed ubiquitously (10Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 11Katzav S. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2283-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 12Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). It has been reported that extracellular stimuli can modify Vav by tyrosine phosphorylation and that Vav proteins have been shown to associate with multiple growth factor receptors upon activation (13Moores S.L. Selfors L.M. Fredericks J. Breit T. Fujikawa K. Alt F.W. Brugge J.S. Swat W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6364-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Integrin engagement also leads to Vav1 activation through tyrosine phosphorylation (14Yron I. Deckert M. Reff M.E. Munshi A. Schwartz M.A. Altman A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1999; 7: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the amino terminus of Vav has been implicated in its function (8Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The Vav1 acidic domain contains three tyrosine residues (tyrosine 142, 160, and 174). Biochemical and structural evidence suggests that tyrosine 174 of the Vav1 acidic region contributes to an autoinhibitory event via intramolecular interaction with the catalytic Dbl homology domain (15Lopez-Lago M. Lee H. Cruz C. Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1678-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 16Aghazadeh B. Lowry W.E. Huang X.Y. Rosen M.K. Cell. 2000; 102: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). This autoinhibitory interaction is released upon phosphorylation of tyrosine 174 (16Aghazadeh B. Lowry W.E. Huang X.Y. Rosen M.K. Cell. 2000; 102: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In this paper, utilizing K562 stable transfection cell lines, we carried out a detailed study of Rho family GTPase activity during integrin αvβ3-mediated cell adhesion to vitronectin (Vn). To determine further the requirement for β3 integrin tyrosine phosphorylation in the activation of Rho family GTPases, we assessed the role of a Rac/Rho GEF, Vav1, in αvβ3-mediated adhesion of hematopoietic cells. We found a specific association between αvβ3 and Vav1 which depends upon the tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 at tyrosine 747. Expression of wild type Vav1 and the Vav1 tyrosine mutants Vav1Y160F and Vav1Y174F in Kαvβ3 cells, demonstrates that the tyrosine 160 mutation disrupts cytoskeletal organization formation and impairs activation of Rho and Rac in vivo and inhibits cell adhesion. Association of Vav1 and β3 integrin is also perturbed by the tyrosine 160 mutation. Further, specific phosphorylation of Vav1 is induced by αvβ3-mediated adhesion, and cell adhesion is required for optimal Vav1-β3 association. These results suggest that tyrosine 160 of Vav1 plays a unique role in αvβ3-mediated cell adhesion and subsequent cytoskeletal reorganization and possibly involvement in translocation of Vav1 to the β3 integrin adhesion complex. It is our belief that successful tyrosine 160 phosphorylation of Vav1 and its translocation to β3 are key components of the β3 tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent adhesion mechanism of hematopoietic cell types. Cells and Materials—K562 cells were stably transfected with cDNA encoding wild type β3, Y747F β3, Y759F β3, and Y747F/Y759F β3 together with the αV subunit and maintained as described previously (2Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). αVβ3 expression in K562 cells (Kαvβ3, Kαvβ3 Y747F, Kαvβ3Y759F, Kαvβ3Y747F/Y759F) was equivalent between cell lines and monitored by flow cytometry. Vav1Y160F and Vav1Y174F were created using standard PCR mutagenesis from pEGFPN3-Vav1, a gift from Dr. R. Kawahara, University of Nebraska. The Y160F mutation was introduced using 5′-GGA TGA GGA CCT GTT TGA CTG CGT GG-3′ and 5′-CCA CGC AGT CAA ACA GGT CCT CAT CC-3′; the Y174F mutation was introduced using 5′-GGA GGC GGA AGG CGA CGA GAT CTT TGA GG-3′ and 5′-GCT GGC TGA CTC CAC CTG GCT GCA GTA GCG GCC-3′. A 5′-noncoding EcoRI site was introduced for transfer of Vav1 and Vav1Y160F to pGEX-2T for production of full-length Vav1 fusion proteins in BL21 bacteria. GFP-Vav1, GFP-Vav1Y160F, and GFP-Vav1Y174F used for transfections were removed from pEGFPN3-Vav1 and subcloned to pcDNA3.1+/zeo (Invitrogen). All PCR-replicated cDNA was verified by sequencing. Kαvβ3 cells were stably transfected with GFP-Vav1, GFP-Vav1Y160F, and GFP-Vav1Y174F; expression of GFP-Vav1, GFP-Vav1Y160F, and GFP-Vav1Y174F was monitored by flow cytometry. Vn was prepared as described previously (17Blystone S.D. Graham I.L. Lindberg F.P. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Anti-β3 antibody 7G2 was a gift from Dr. E. J. Brown, UCSF. Phospho-sitespecific antibodies (PSSAs) to tyrosine 160 of Vav1 (Vav1Y160p) and tyrosine 747 of β3 integrin (β3Y747p) were developed in collaboration with BIOSOURCE International (Hopkinton, MA). Anti-Vav1, anti-Rho (A, B, C) polyclonal antibodies, and anti-actin monoclonal antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Rac and anti-Cdc42 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO). Anti-GFP polyclonal antibody was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Immunoprecipitation—6-well plates were coated with 1.0 μg/ml Vn in PBS at 4 °C overnight. Plates were washed twice with PBS followed by the addition of 2 × 106 cells treated with 40 μm NaVO4 and permitted to adhere for 1 h. All cells in the well were lysed with solubilization buffer (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μm NaVO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin in cold PBS). For the indicated experiments, some cells were lysed while in suspension or treated with 1 μg/ml cytochalasin D. For β3 integrin immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were precleared with gelatin-Sepharose and then immunoprecipitated with goat anti-mouse-Sepharose, preincubated with anti-β3 antibody (7G2) for 2 h at 4 °C. For Vav1 and GFP immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose followed by incubation with anti-Vav1 and anti-GFP antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C and precipitated with protein A-Sepharose. Sample buffer was added, and samples were boiled for 5 min. After centrifugation, supernatants were loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and subjected to Western blotting. Antibodies used for Western blotting were monoclonal antibody 7G2 (anti-β3), monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10, polyclonal β3 PSSA recognizing phosphorylated tyrosine 747, polyclonal Vav1 PSSA recognizing phosphorylated Vav1 tyrosine 160, and polyclonal anti-Vav1 antibody. β3 Phosphorylation—2 × 106 K562 cells expressing wild type or Y747F/Y759F β3 were suspended in 1 ml of PBS and incubated with or without 2 mm Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro (GRGDSP) peptide, in the presence of 40 μm NaVO4 for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, cells were lysed, and immunoprecipitation of β3 was performed as described previously. Phosphorylation of β3 tyrosine 747 was detected by Western blotting using a PSSA against phosphorylated tyrosine 747 of β3. Rho GTPase Activity Assay—6-well plates were coated with 1 μg/ml Vn, and cells were plated at 2 ×106 cells/well and allowed to adhere for the indicated times at 37 °C. Rho GTPase activity was assayed as described previously (1Butler B. Williams M.P. Blystone S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5264-5270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were then clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. GTP-bound Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 were affinity purified from lysates using a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion construct of the Rho binding domain of rhotekin (GST-RBD) and the p21 binding domain (GST-PBD) of the target PAK1 (kindly provided by M. A. Schwartz, Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA). Lysates were incubated with GST-RBD/GST-PBD (∼25 μg) beads for 1 h at 4 °C. GTP-bound Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 were separated using 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. Total Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 were determined by loading 1/10 total volume of cell lysate on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and subjected to Western blotting. Antibodies used for Western blotting were polyclonal anti-Rho, anti-Rac, and anti-Cdc42. Fluorescent Microscopy—12-mm glass coverslips were coated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml Vn in PBS. 8 × 104 KαVβ3 cells or GFP-Vav1-, GFP-Vav1Y160F-, or GFP-Vav1Y174F-transfected KαVβ3 cells were adhered to coverslips for 1 h at 37 °C in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium. Cells were washed twice with PBS. After fixation with 3.7% formaldehyde for 1 h, cells were permeabilized with 0.005% Nonidet P-40 for 15 s at 4 °C followed by two washes with PBS. For actin filament staining, rhodamine-phalloidin (1:1,200) was diluted in PBS and added to the cells for 30 min at 37 °C followed by five washes in PBS. Coverslips were reversed onto o-phenylenediamine in glycerol. Fluorescence was visualized on a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescent microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY). Images were digitally captured with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER digital camera (Bridgewater, NJ) and processed with Simple PCI and Adobe PhotoShop 5.5 software. Cell Adhesion Assays—96-well microtiter plates (Immulon II, Dynatech, Chantilly, VA) were coated with 1 μg/ml Vn in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Wells were washed twice in PBS and postcoated with 1.0% casein in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. KαVβ3, KαVβ3Y747F/Y759F, or GFP-Vav1-, GFP-Vav1Y160F-, or GFP-Vav1Y174F-transfected KαVβ3 cells were added at 1 ×105 cells/well in Hanks' buffered saline solution containing 1.0 mm Ca2+ and Mg2+ and allowed to adhere for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were rinsed three times in Hanks' buffered saline solution without Ca2+ or Mg2+, and adherent cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 1 h at 4 °C and stained with 0.05% crystal violet for 30 min at room temperature. Crystal violet was dispersed in methanol, and adhesion was quantified by absorbance at 570 nm using an Emax microplate reader (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Actin Sedimentation Assays—6-well plates were coated with 1 μg/ml Vn, and cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/well and allowed to adhere for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm KCl, 20 mm imidazole, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2; fresh EGTA was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm and fresh dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 2 mm, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml phalloidin). Cell lysates were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Proteins from ultracentrifuge supernatant were trichloroacetic acid precipitated and loaded along with pellets from ultracentrifuged sample on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Total actin was determined by loading 10% total volume cell lysates. Actin was detected by Western blotting with anti-actin monoclonal antibody. In Vitro Tyrosine Phosphorylation and Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Assay—GST-Vav1 and GST-Vav1Y160F were incubated with 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated Kαvβ3 lysate for 20 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of 6 units of Src (Sigma). After glutathione-Sepharose pull-down, proteins were blotted with polyclonal antibody recognizing phosphorylated Vav1 at tyrosine 160 to reveal Vav1 phosphorylation. For guanine nucleotide exchange assay, GST, GST-Vav1, GST-Vav1Y160F, and GST-Vav1Y174F were incubated with Kαvβ3 lysate described above. GST-RBD or GST-PBD was added to the reactions and pull-downs blotted for Rho, Rac, and Cdc42. Antibodies used for Western blotting were polyclonal anti-Rho, anti-Rac, and anti-Cdc42. Parallel samples of lysates used were blotted to visualize equality of total Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 in cell lysates. Rho Family GTPases Activation and β3 Integrin Phosphorylation—Integrin engagement has been shown previously to regulate Rho GTPase activation, and β3 integrin phosphorylation plays a critical role in Rho activation during αvβ3 integrin-mediated cell adhesion to Vn (1Butler B. Williams M.P. Blystone S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5264-5270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this study, we carried out a detailed examination of the three major Rho family GTPases activation during αvβ3 integrin-mediated cell adhesion to Vn. To investigate the relationship between Rho family GTPases activation and β3 integrin phosphorylation, we adhered KαVβ3, KαVβ3Y747F, KαVβ3Y759F cells, and KαVβ3Y747F/Y759F cells to Vn for 10, 30, and 60 min and examined Cdc42 activity in all four cell types by GST-PBD pull-down, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Distinct responses of Cdc42 activation were observed among these cells during their adhesion time course (Fig. 1A). In KαVβ3 and KαVβ3Y759F cells, Cdc42 activity reached its peak at 30 min and declined afterward. Contrastingly, in KαVβ3Y747F and KαVβ3Y747F/Y759F cells, with nonphosphorylatable tyrosine 747, Cdc42 displayed continually increasing activity through 60 min of adhesion, as seen in Fig. 1A. We also examined Rho and Rac activity in adhering KαVβ3 and KαVβ3Y747F/Y759F cells at 10, 30, and 60 min. We found that Rac was activated as early as at 10 min in both KαVβ3 and KαVβ3Y747F/Y759F cells. In KαVβ3 cells, Rac activity kept increasing for 60 min. In contrast, Rac activity was diminished in KαVβ3Y747F/Y759F cells at both 30 and 60 min (Fig. 1B). We also found that Rho was not activated until late in adhesion in KαVβ3 cells, corresponding to organization of actin stress fibers in these cells (3Chandhoke S.K. Williams M. Schaefer E. Zorn L. Blystone S.D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1431-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). At 60 min, we were able to detect Rho activity in KαVβ3 cells, whereas in KαVβ3Y747F/Y759F cells, Rho activity was inhibited throughout the time course (Fig. 1C). Vav1 Association with β3 Integrins—Rho GEFs play an important role in the pathway from extracellular stimuli to Rho GTPase activation. Given the dependence of Rho GTPases activation on β3 tyrosine phosphorylation, we investigated whether activation of their upstream regulators, Rho GEFs, was also dependent upon the phosphorylation status of β3. Because it has been reported that Vav1 of the Vav family of GEFs is hematopoietically restricted (11Katzav S. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2283-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), we evaluated the role of Vav1 in β3-dependent Rho GTPase activation. To investigate the relationship between αVβ3 and Vav1 activation, we utilized a Vav1 polyclonal antibody to immunoprecipitate Vav1 from KαVβ3 and KαVβ3Y747F/Y759F cells after their adhesion to Vn for 1 h. Western blotting analysis for associated β3 showed that Vav1 associated with αvβ3 only under conditions where β3 was tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 2, A and B). Phosphorylation of β3 was detected with a PSSA against β3 tyrosine 747 (3Chandhoke S.K. Williams M. Schaefer E. Zorn L. Blystone S.D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1431-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Vav1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated both in KαVβ3 and KαVβ3Y747F/Y759F cells, as shown in Fig. 2A by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10. These results suggest that although association between Vav1 and β3 depends on the status of β3 tyrosine phosphorylation, Vav1 tyrosine phosphorylation is not disturbed in the absence of β3 tyrosine residues. Rho Family GTPase Activity and Vav1 Phosphorylation— Previous studies have shown that the activation of Vav1 GEF activity is mediated by its tyrosine phosphorylation (15Lopez-Lago M. Lee H. Cruz C. Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1678-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at Vav1 tyrosine 174 has been shown previously to relieve an inhibition to the Vav1 Dbl homology domain and expose this catalytic domain to Rho GTPases (16Aghazadeh B. Lowry W.E. Huang X.Y. Rosen M.K. Cell. 2000; 102: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Little work has been done to determine the roles that other tyrosine residues play in Vav1 activity regulation. Some reports suggest that tyrosine 142 and tyrosine 160 might have synergistic effects on Vav1 activity inhibition because of proximity (15Lopez-Lago M. Lee H. Cruz C. Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1678-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism of Vav1 activation and also to address the roles of critical tyrosine residue 174 and its adjacent tyrosine residue 160 during αvβ3-mediated adhesion, we created single tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations at Vav1 tyrosine 160 and 174, stably expressed wild type GFP-Vav1, GFP-Vav1Y160F, and GFP-Vav1Y174F in Kαvβ3 cells, and examined several aspects of cytoskeletal organization in these cells. To study further the requirement of Vav1 tyrosine phosphorylation for Rho GT-Pases activity during αvβ3-mediated cell adhesion, we examined the activation status of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 in Kαvβ3 cells expressing wild type and tyrosine mutant Vav1. Surprisingly, activation of Rho and Rac was not observed in Vav1Y160F cells after 60 min of adhesion (Fig. 3, A and B). Wild type Vav1 and Vav1Y174F-transfected cells exhibited Rho and Rac activation comparable with Kαvβ3 cells (Fig. 1), suggesting the requirement of Vav1 tyrosine 160 presence for Rho and Rac activation. Unlike Rho and Rac, Cdc42 activity in Vav1Y160F-expressing cells remained at a high level after 60 min of cell adhesion (Fig. 3C). Cells expressing Vav1Y160F displayed a pattern of Rho GTPase activation similar to that observed in Kαvβ3Y747F/Y759F cells where the β3 cytoplasmic tail cannot become tyrosine-phosphorylated. This suggests that for αvβ3 adhesion in hematopoietic cells, the requirement for β3 tyrosine 747 and Vav1 tyrosine 160 may be mechanistically related. Vav1 Tyrosine Phosphorylation and Cytoskeletal Reorganization—Having determined that the mutation of Vav1 tyrosine 160 alters GTPase activity during αvβ3-dependent adhesion, we examined whether cells expressing this mutant Vav1 exhibited a phenotype that corresponded with elevated levels of Cdc42 activity and reduced Rac and Rho activity. Kαvβ3 and Kαvβ3 cells expressing GFP-conjugated wild type, Y160F, or Y174F Vav1 were permitted to adhere to Vn for 1 h, and the degree of cell spreading, cellular morphology, and arrangement of the actin cytoskeleton were visualized by rhodamine-phalloidin staining. As shown in Fig. 4A, cells expressing wild type Vav1 or Vav1Y174F exhibited spreading and overall morphology equivalent to the parent cell line Kαvβ3. In contrast, and in keeping with the Cdc42 dominant activity demonstrated in Fig. 3, cells expressing Vav1Y160F exhibited reduced cell spreading, decreased actin organization, and increased filopodia. In agreement with actin visualization studies using rhodamine-phalloidin, sediment of cell lysates from adherent Kαvβ3 or Kαvβ3 cells expressing wild type, Y160F, or Y174F Vav1 revealed that the Y160F mutation resulted in a large increase in soluble actin and a reduction in polymerized actin compared with cells expressing wild type Vav1 (Fig. 4C). This suggested that tyrosine 160 phosphorylation of Vav1 is an important step in the mechanism leading to actin cytoskeletal organization during αvβ3-mediated leukocyte adhesion. To determine whether or not the abnormal GTPases profile and deficient actin organization exhibited by the Vav1Y160F mutant cells were reflected in cell adhesion, Kαvβ3 and Kαvβ3 cells expressing wild type, Y160F, or Y174F Vav1 or β3 containing a double tyrosine mutation in the cytoplasmic tail which prevented Vav1 association with β3 (Fig. 2) were permitted to adhere to Vn in a quantitative adhesion assay (Fig. 4B). Mutation of tyrosine 160 of Vav1, but not tyrosine 174, dramatically reduced cell adhesion in this assay. As shown previously (18Blystone S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46886-46890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), mutation of the β3 cytoplasmic tyrosines also reduced cell adhesion. These results demonstrate that tyrosine 160 of Vav1 is important to αvβ3-mediated adhesion and may relate to the defective adhesion, Rho activation, and cytoskeletal organization demonstrated previously in tyrosine mutant β3 integrins. Disturbance of Vav1 Association with β3 Integrin by Vav1Y160F Mutation—To determine further the function of Vav1 tyrosine 160 phosphorylation and its role in β3 integrin-mediated adhesion, we permitted Kαvβ3 cells expressing wild type Vav1, Vav1Y160F, or Vav1Y174F to adhere to Vn for 1 h and immunoprecipitated both endogenous and exogenous Vav1 from these cells. As shown in Fig. 5, β3 association with Vav1 was not disturbed in either wild type Vav1 or Vav1Y174F cells, whereas in cells expressing Vav1Y160F, expression of this Vav1 mutant led to reduced association between β3 integrin and Vav1. Using an anti-GFP antibody to pull down the exogenous GFP-Vav1 proteins, we found that mutation of Vav1 tyrosine 160 obliterates the association between Vav1 and β3 integrin. These results suggest a possible role for Vav1 tyrosine 160 in Vav1 recruitment to the β3 integrin adhesion complex. Examination of total Vav1 recovery from these cells showed reduced levels of β3 association in Vav1Y16"

A cellular requirement for MetAP activity is likely due to dysfunction of MetAP substrates that require methionine removal for proper protein function. Glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase (Gfa1) is an essential enzyme in yeast that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in hexosamine biosynthesis. The α-amino group of Gfa1 Cys-1 has been proposed to act as a nucleophile in the catalytic mechanism. We used two mutational strategies to evaluate whether removal of initiator methionine, catalyzed by MetAP, is required for Gfa1 function. Our results demonstrate that exposure of the α-amino group of Cys-1 is required for normal Gfa1 function as failure to do so results in decreased enzyme activity and slow growth. Further, either isoform of MetAP in yeast is sufficient for Gfa1 processing in vivo. These results are the first demonstration of an endogenous yeast protein that requires the exposure of the α-amino group by MetAP action for normal function. Additionally, Gfa1 will be a relevant target in therapeutic or physiological applications in which MetAP activity is inhibited.

The amino acid methionine is used almost universally to initiate protein synthesis. In eubacteria and in the organelles of eukaryotes, the initiator methionine is modified by the addition of a formyl group, which is subsequently removed, co-translationally, by peptide deformylase (1.Adams J.M. Capecchi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 2.Adams J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 571-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 3.Bianchetti R. Lucchini G. Crosti P. Tortora P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2519-2523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, following peptide deformylase action, nearly all nascent proteins begin with an initiating methionine residue. However, a large subset of mature proteins have the initiator methionine removed, a process that occurs co-translationally and is catalyzed by the enzyme methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP). 1The abbreviations used are: MetAP, methionine aminopeptidase; Gfa1, glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase; Ub, ubiquitin. There are two types of MetAPs, designated as type 1 and type 2 (4.Arfin S.M. Kendall R.L. Hall L. Weaver L.H. Stewart A.E. Matthews B.W. Bradshaw R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7714-7718Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 5.Li X. Chang Y.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12357-12361Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Although not an absolute rule, prokaryotes, which include eubacteria and archaebacteria, will typically express a single isoform of MetAP, whereas eukaryotes typically express both MetAP1 and MetAP2. Additionally, organellar versions of MetAP have been identified in multiple organisms, including plants, fruit flies, and humans (6.Giglione C. Serero A. Pierre M. Boisson B. Meinnel T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5916-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 7.Serero A. Giglione C. Sardini A. Martinez-Sanz J. Meinnel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52953-52963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). MetAP activity is essential, as demonstrated by several deletion experiments, including deletion of the single MetAP in Escherichia coli (8.Chang S.Y. McGary E.C. Chang S. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4071-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and Salmonella typhimurium (9.Miller C.G. Kukral A.M. Miller J.L. Movva N.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5215-5217Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and deletion of both MetAP1 and MetAP2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (5.Li X. Chang Y.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12357-12361Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), all of which result in lethality. Additionally, deletion of MetAP1 (map1Δ) in yeast results in a severe slow growth phenotype and decreased processing of a model protein substrate in vivo (10.Chang Y.H. Teichert U. Smith J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8007-8011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Chen S. Vetro J.A. Chang Y.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 398: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Deletion of yeast MetAP2 (map2Δ) has little or no effect on cell growth and model protein substrate processing. Despite the lack of phenotype observed with deletion of MetAP2 in yeast, MetAP2 has been demonstrated to be important for the growth of endothelial cells, some tumor cells, and some microorganisms (12.Kusaka M. Sudo K. Matsutani E. Kozai Y. Marui S. Fujita T. Ingber D. Folkman J. Br. J. Cancer. 1994; 69: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 13.Yamamoto T. Sudo K. Fujita T. Anticancer Res. 1994; 14: 1-3PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Zhang P. Nicholson D.E. Bujnicki J.M. Su X. Brendle J.J. Ferdig M. Kyle D.E. Milhous W.K. Chiang P.K. J. Biomed. Sci. 2003; 9: 34-40Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, the relative importance of either MetAP isoform may be cell type-specific. The importance of MetAP2 for the growth of endothelial cells and some cancer cells has made human MetAP2 an attractive target for cancer therapy, both by inhibition of angiogenesis and by direct inhibition of tumor cell growth. Recently, inhibition of growth of some cancer cells by treatment with bengamides, which are analogs of natural marine products that inhibit both MetAP1 and MetAP2 with similar potency, has potentially implicated MetAP1 in the growth of cancer cells (15.Towbin H. Bair K.W. DeCaprio J.A. Eck M.J. Kim S. Kinder F.R. Morollo A. Mueller D.R. Schindler P. Song H.K. van Oostrum J. Versace R.W. Voshol H. Wood J. Zabludoff S. Phillips P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52964-52971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The specific MetAP substrates that may be important targets for cancer therapy have yet to be identified. Failure to remove initiator methionine may have several effects on proteins that are detrimental to protein function. Methionine removal is required for subsequent N-terminal modifications, including N-myristoylation and N-acetylation, the lack of which may alter protein stability, localization, or functional interactions. Multiple examples have demonstrated that inappropriate retention of initiator methionine can, in some circumstances, result directly in decreased protein stability, albeit in unpredictable ways (11.Chen S. Vetro J.A. Chang Y.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 398: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16.Giglione C. Vallon O. Meinnel T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that removal of initiator methionine may be required to expose a mature N-terminal residue involved in catalysis. An example is the case of some N-terminal nucleophile aminotransferases, which have a nucleophilic N-terminal cysteine. To date, specific characterization of downstream targets of MetAP that directly require methionine removal for function has been elusive. The identification of these targets will be important not only in understanding why MetAP activity is essential but also in identifying targets for treatment of cancer, both via anti-angiogenesis strategies and through direct inhibition of tumor cell growth. The essential yeast gene GFA1 codes for glutamine fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase, which catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway. Also known as glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase, the enzyme catalyzes the formation of glucosamine-6-phosphate and glutamate from fructose-6-phosphate and glutamine (17.Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hexosamine biosynthesis pathway is responsible for generating the precursors for N- and O-linked glycosylation. Further, Gfa1 and the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway are involved in yeast in the biosynthesis of chitin, a cell wall component (18.LaGorce A. Le Berre-Anton V. Aguilar-Uscanga B. Martin-Yken H. Dagkessamanskaia A. Francois A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1697-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and resistance to methyl mercury (19.Miura N. Kaneko S. Hosoya S. Furuchi T. Miura K. Kuge S. Naganuma A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The hexosamine biosynthesis pathway is also suggested to contribute to the negative effects of high glucose in mammalian cells (17.Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aminotransferases consist of two domains, a glutaminase domain, responsible for hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate, and a synthase domain, responsible for amination of a substrate (20.Isupov M.N. Obmolova G. Butterworth S. Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. Polikarpov I. Littlechild J.A. Teplyakov A. Structure. 1997; 4: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Gfa1 is part of the N-terminal nucleophile family of aminotransferases, which have an N-terminal catalytic cysteine as part of the glutaminase domain (20.Isupov M.N. Obmolova G. Butterworth S. Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. Polikarpov I. Littlechild J.A. Teplyakov A. Structure. 1997; 4: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Gfa1 is one of the more intriguing N-terminal nucleophile aminotransferases with respect to MetAP activity for several reasons. These include its requirement for yeast viability, the fact that the α-amino group of the catalytic N-terminal cysteine is exposed by the activity of MetAP, and the fact that the Gfa1 N-terminal sequence is conserved from yeast to humans. In the reaction mechanism, the cysteine α-amino group serves as a general base catalyst. Experiments with a Gly0 mutant of E. coli Gfa1 demonstrate the importance of exposure of the cysteine α-amino amino group as revealed by a >100-fold decrease in enzyme activity (20.Isupov M.N. Obmolova G. Butterworth S. Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. Polikarpov I. Littlechild J.A. Teplyakov A. Structure. 1997; 4: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The conservation of the N-terminal sequence of Gfa1 suggests that the importance of the cysteine α-amino group is also likely conserved; however, this has not been evaluated, nor has the impact on the function of the enzyme in vivo. The identification of MetAP substrates that contribute to the dependence of the cell on MetAP activity for normal growth and viability and that further require MetAP activity to perform their essential functions is a long-standing goal of our laboratory. Gfa1, for the aforementioned reasons, is one such candidate. We used the yeast system to evaluate the extent to which Gfa1 relies on MetAP action to perform its essential function. The results indicated that failure to expose the α-amino group of the N-terminal cysteine results in decreased enzyme activity and slow growth. Further, in yeast, either isoform of MetAP appeared sufficient to process Gfa1. These results validated Gfa1 as a downstream MetAP target that requires methionine removal for proper function. General Methods—Yeast transformation was performed by the lithium acetate procedure (21.Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kumura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein assays were performed according to the method of Bradford (22.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. UV measurements were made on a DU-70 spectrophotometer (Beckman). Vectors and Strains—Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. BY4743 (gfa1::KanMX/GFA1), BY4741 (map1::KanMX), and BY4741 (map2::KanMX) were obtained from ATCC. A haploid yeast strain carrying a null allele of gfa1 was constructed by sporulation and subsequent tetrad dissection of BY4743. gfa1Δ cells were selected by resistance to G418 coupled with glucosamine auxotrophy. gfa1Δ cells were maintained in medium supplemented with 5 mg/ml glucosamine. GFA1 coding sequence was obtained by PCR from yeast genomic DNA using the primers 5′-GCGAACTAGTA TGTGTGGTATCTTTGGTTACTG-3′ and 5′-CGCAGAATTCTTATTCGACGGTAA CAGATTTAGCC-3′, adding an SpeI site at the 5′ end and an EcoRI site at the 3′ end. The resulting PCR product was subcloned into p426GPD, a high copy plasmid that places the gene of interest under the strong glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. Gfa1-Ala0, a Gfa1 mutant with an alanine insertion between the initiation codon and Cys-1 of the mature wild type protein was created by standard PCR mutagenesis, using the primers 5′-ATGGCTTGTGGTATCTTTGGTTACTGC-3′ and 5′-CTTATTCGACGGTAACA GAT-3′. The PCR product was TOPO-TA subcloned into PCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen), digested with EcoRI, and then subcloned to p426GPD. To create ubiquitin-Cys-Gfa1 (Ub-cys-Gfa1), the coding sequence for yeast ubiquitin was amplified using genomic DNA as a template with the primers 5′-ATGCAGATTTTCGTCAAGACTT-3′ and 5′-ATAATTGCAGTAACCAAAGATACC ACAACCACCTCTTAGCCTTAGCA-3′. The resulting PCR product shares 27 bp of overlap at the 3′ end with the 5′ end of a PCR product generated by the primers 5′-TGTGGTATCTTTGGTTACTGC-3′ and 5′-CTTATTCGACGGTAACAGAT-3′, which amplifies the entire GFA1 coding sequence with the exception of the AUG initiation codon. The two PCR products were gel-purified, and then equimolar amounts were annealed by heating at 95 °C for 3 min followed by cooling on ice for 2 min, in 1× PCR buffer. Then, the annealed PCR products were mixed with dNTPs in 1× PCR buffer, with the primers 5′-ATGCAGATTTTCGTCAAGACTT-3′ and 5′-CTTATTCGACGGTAACAGAT-3′. Fusion PCR product was generated with Phusion high fidelity polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland), TOPO-TA cloned to PCR2.1-TOPO, digested with SpeI/XhoI, and then subcloned to p426GPD. A similar strategy was used to create a Ub-Met-Gfa1 fusion protein. The sequences of all constructs were confirmed using the automated DNA sequencing facility at St. Louis University.Table IYeast strainsStrainGenotypeReferenceBY4743MATα/MATa ura3Δ0/ura3Δ0 his3Δ1/his3Δ1 met15Δ0/met15Δ0 lys2Δ0/lys2Δ0 gfa1::KanMX/GFA1Ref. 26.Giaever G.

Tanner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8753-8758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications. Yeast cells were grown in 50–100 ml of growth medium (SD –Ura for plasmid carrying strains, YPD for endogenous Gfa1 activity) to an A600 nm of 1.0. The cells were washed once with water and then resuspended in 4 ml of breaking buffer (200 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). 4 g of glass beads were added, and the cells were broken by vortexing eight times for 30 s each with 30-s intervals on ice. The supernatants were centrifuged at 18,000 rpm in an SS-34 rotor and then concentrated to 100–200 μl final volume (10–20 mg/ml) with Centricon Plus-20, 10,000 molecular weight cut-off spin columns. The resulting extract was then applied to a Bio-Spin 6 column pre-equilibrated in Gfa1 assay buffer (60 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA). The eluent was mixed 1:1 with 2× Gfa1 assay solution (30 mm glutamine, 30 mm fructose-6-phosphate in 1× Gfa1 assay buffer). Reactions were continued for 30–60 min and were terminated by boiling for 2 min. The protein precipitate was separated by centrifugation. The supernatant was then assayed for glucosamine-6-phosphate using the AccQ-Tag method (Waters, Milford, MA). Portions of the extract eluted from the Bio-Spin 6 column were also subjected to Western blot analysis to determine relative expression levels of Gfa1. Western Blotting—Polyclonal antibodies to the Gfa1 C terminus peptide were generated in rabbits by standard procedures (24.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 72-113Google Scholar). Antibodies were affinity-purified and used at a 1:1000 dilution for Western blotting. Proteins were separated by 7.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters overnight in the cold. Western blotting was performed according to the ECL protocol (Amersham Biosciences). N-terminal Sequencing—To immunoprecipitate Gfa1, cells were grown in 200-ml cultures to an A600 nm of 1.0. Cell pellets were washed once with water, resuspended in 4 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× Compete mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm EDTA), and broken with glass beads. The extracts were centrifuged, and the supernatant (6–8 mg) was precleared with protein-G agarose beads for 1 h. The supernatant was then mixed with 30 μg of anti-Gfa1 antibody for 1 h. Gfa1-antibody complexes were collected by incubation for 1 h with protein-G agarose beads. The beads were washed four times with radioimmune precipitation buffer. Bound Gfa1 was eluted by boiling in sample buffer. The eluent was separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. N-terminal sequencing was performed by Midwest Analytical (St. Louis, MO). Generation of Growth Curves—Cells were grown overnight in SD –Ura and then diluted in 25 ml of total volume to an A600 nm of ∼0.1. Growth was then continued, and aliquots were taken at 1-h intervals for determination of A600 nm Experiments were repeated at least three times. Shown is a representative growth curve. To evaluate whether removal of initiator methionine and subsequent exposure of the α-amino group of N-terminal cysteine is required for Gfa1 to perform its essential function, we used two strategies (Fig. 1). The first involved insertion of a codon specifying for alanine between the initiator methionine codon and the codon for mature N-terminal cysteine. The resulting Gfa1-Ala0 mutant will be a substrate for MetAP and will have an alanine residue at the mature N terminus, blocking the cysteine α-amino group, mimicking the effect of the failure to process initiator methionine, independent of MetAP activity. The second strategy was to utilize the ubiquitin fusion protein approach (25.Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). When ubiquitin is fused to the N terminus of a protein, ubiquitin hydrolases will cleave the attached ubiquitin co-translationally (25.Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of this system allows for the creation of proteins with unique N termini by simply manipulating the identity of the residue at the ubiquitin-protein junction. We created two ubiquitin fusion proteins with codons specifying for either cysteine or methionine at the fusion junction by fusion PCR in an attempt to create mature Gfa1 proteins with either methionine or cysteine residues at the N terminus. Although GFA1 is an essential gene in yeast, the lethal phenotype is conditional. Haploid gfa1Δ cells can be maintained by supplementing the medium with glucosamine (23.Watzele G. Tanner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8753-8758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We generated haploid gfa1Δ cells by sporulation and tetrad dissection of a diploid strain heterozygous for the GFA1 gene followed by selection of glucosamine auxotrophs. To assay the ability of the various mutant forms of Gfa1 to perform the essential function, each Gfa1 mutant was cloned to a high copy yeast expression vector, which was then used to transform gfa1Δ cells. Cells were then assayed for growth in medium lacking glucosamine. All of the plasmids supported cell viability in medium lacking glucosamine, whereas a vector control was inviable (data not shown). The growth of strains expressing wild type Gfa1, Ub-Cys-Gfa1, or Ub-Met-Gfa1 were essentially indistinguishable, whereas the growth of cells expressing the Gfa1-Ala0 mutant was significantly slower (Fig. 2). These results indicated that exposure of the α-amino group of N-terminal cysteine was not required for the essential function of Gfa1; however, the difference in results obtained between cells expressing the Gfa1-Ala0 mutant versus Ub-Met-Gfa1 was unexpected and precluded further conclusions. The addition of an epitope tag at the C terminus of Gfa1 resulted in a protein that was unable to complement the gfa1Δ lethal phenotype. Thus, to compare the expression levels of different Gfa1 mutants, we developed Gfa1-specific polyclonal antibodies. Western blotting with these antibodies demonstrated that expression of the Gfa1-Ala0 mutant was as high as wild type Gfa1 (Fig. 3), thus ruling out decreased Gfa1 expression as the reason for the slow growth of this strain.Fig. 3Expression and activity levels of Gfa1 variants. Shown at the top is a representative Western blot using Gfa1-specific antibodies, from gfa1Δ cells expressing the indicated Gfa1 proteins. The graph shows relative Gfa1 activity levels measured from total cell extracts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the growth rate of the cells correlated with cellular Gfa1 activity, we assayed activity in the various strains. The activity from strains expressing Ub-Cys-Gfa1 versus Ub-Met-Gfa1 was approximately equal, although less than in cells expressing wild type Gfa1. This decrease likely results from a lower expression level of both ubiquitin fusion proteins revealed by Western blotting (Fig. 3). The blot also shows that ubiquitin is processed from both ubiquitin fusion proteins as expected. In agreement with a reduced growth rate, cells expressing Gfa1-Ala0 had dramatically reduced Gfa1 activity, less than 10% of the activity from cells expressing wild type Gfa1 (Fig. 3). These results were unexpected. The simplest explanation for the lack of effect on Gfa1 activity seen with the Ub-Met-Gfa1 mutant is that the methionine is still processed, despite the ubiquitin fusion approach. We performed N-terminal sequencing on the three mutant proteins. The results are shown in Table II. As expected, N-terminal sequencing of Ub-Cys-Gfa1 and Gfa1-Ala0 indicated cysteine and alanine, respectively, as the N-terminal residues of the mature proteins. Surprisingly, the sequencing results from the Ub-Met-Gfa1 fusion protein also indicated that cysteine was the mature N-terminal residue of this protein. No laddering effect was apparent in the chromatograms. Although we did not test it, the enzyme most likely to process the methionine is MetAP; thus, it appears that MetAP can still cleave the N-terminal methionine residue at some point after ubiquitin is cleaved. Together, these results indicate that exposure of the α-amino group of N-terminal cysteine of Gfa1 is required for full activity and normal cell growth. Considering that these proteins are overexpressed, the effect on growth is likely underestimated.Table IIN-terminal sequence of Gfa1 mutantsProtein expressedN-terminal sequenceGfa1 wild typeaThe predicted wild type N-terminal sequence of Gfa1 is CGIFGNot DeterminedUb-Met-Gfa1bCysteine is not detected by standard N-terminal sequencing, so the symbol X replaces cycles that gave no peak and are assumed to represent cysteineXGIFGUb-Cys-Gfa1bCysteine is not detected by standard N-terminal sequencing, so the symbol X replaces cycles that gave no peak and are assumed to represent cysteineXGIFGGfa1-Ala0bCysteine is not detected by standard N-terminal sequencing, so the symbol X replaces cycles that gave no peak and are assumed to represent cysteineAXGIFa The predicted wild type N-terminal sequence of Gfa1 is CGIFGb Cysteine is not detected by standard N-terminal sequencing, so the symbol X replaces cycles that gave no peak and are assumed to represent cysteine Open table in a new tab Based on several lines of evidence, we thought it likely that MetAP1 would be the major enzyme responsible for processing Gfa1. MetAP1 is clearly the dominant isoform in yeast cells both in terms of cell growth and in terms of in vivo protein processing of a model substrate (11.Chen S. Vetro J.A. Chang Y.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 398: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Secondly, a model substrate with cysteine at the mature N terminus was only 3% processed in the presence of endogenous MetAP2 alone (11.Chen S. Vetro J.A. Chang Y.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 398: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The processing of peptides with penultimate cysteine by MetAP cannot be assayed in vitro, presumably because the cobalt required for the assay interacts with the cysteine. We used Gfa1 activity assays in isogenic wild type, map1Δ, or map2Δ strains to infer the extent of initiator methionine processing of Gfa1. We measured endogenous Gfa1 activity because the overexpression of Gfa1 in wild type cells resulted in a significant growth defect (data not shown). Surprisingly, the Gfa1 activity level was the same in all three strains, indicating that likely either MetAP enzyme is sufficient to process Gfa1 in vivo (Fig. 4). Our results demonstrate a requirement for exposure of the α-amino group of N-terminal cysteine for full activity of Gfa1 and for normal growth of yeast cells. Gfa1 is thus far the first endogenous yeast protein shown to be directly reliant upon MetAP activity for function. Although we excluded effects on Gfa1 as contributing to the slow growth of the map1Δ yeast strain, it is nevertheless likely one factor leading to a cellular requirement for MetAP activity for normal growth. Additionally, Gfa1 activity will likely be modulated in physiological and therapeutic applications in which MetAP activity is inhibited. One such application currently is inhibition of tumor cell growth by inhibiting the combined activities of MetAP1 and MetAP2 using bengamides (15.Towbin H. Bair K.W. DeCaprio J.A. Eck M.J. Kim S. Kinder F.R. Morollo A. Mueller D.R. Schindler P. Song H.K. van Oostrum J. Versace R.W. Voshol H. Wood J. Zabludoff S. Phillips P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52964-52971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Whether Gfa1 will be relevant in endothelial cell growth or other situations featuring modulation of MetAP activity awaits further characterization of the relative roles of MetAP isoforms in various cell types. We propose that the alanine insertional strategy outlined in this report can be used to generally test other potentially important downstream MetAP targets. Although alanine insertion does not directly mimic methionine retention, it is probably the closest approximation possible, due to the persistence of methionine processing using the ubiquitin fusion approach demonstrated in this report. The commercial availability of heterozygous deletions of all of the essential yeast genes should greatly facilitate these endeavors, and the yeast system is ideal for quick screening of potential candidates by complementation analysis. Likely candidates will include myristoylated proteins, acetylated proteins, and other proteins similar to Gfa1 that in some way depend upon their mature N-terminal residue for function, such as yeast 5′-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) aminotransferase, encoded by the ADE4 gene. Screening of these candidates will rapidly identify those MetAP substrates that rely upon MetAP activity for their functions, to more specifically explain the cellular requirement for MetAP activity, and potentially may lead to identification of substrates important for the growth of mammalian tumor and/or endotheslial cells."

The R2 protein forms a tight dimer, whereas the strength of the R1 dimer differs between organisms, being monomeric in mouse R1 and dimeric in Escherichia coli. We have used the known E. coli R1 structure as a framework for design of eight different mutations that affect the helices and proximal loops that comprise the dimer interaction area. Mutations in loop residues did not affect dimerization, whereas mutations in the helices had very drastic effects on the interaction resulting in monomeric proteins with very low or no activity. The monomeric N238A protein formed an interesting exception, because it unexpectedly was able to reduce ribonucleotides with a comparatively high capacity. Gel filtration studies revealed that N238A was able to dimerize when bound by both substrate and effector, a result in accordance with the monomeric R1 protein from mouse. The effects of the N238A mutation, fit well with the notion that E. coli protein R1 has a comparatively small dimer interaction surface in relation to its size, and the results illustrate the stabilization effects of substrates and effectors in the dimerization process.

Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) 1The abbreviations used are: RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; DTT, dithiothreitol.1The abbreviations used are: RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; DTT, dithiothreitol. is a multimeric enzyme that uses long range electron transfer from the metal center in the R2 protein to the active site in the R1 protein to perform the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides by help of radical chemistry. Being the only provider of these essential components for de novo synthesis of DNA, RNR is expressed ubiquitously in the cytosol of all living cells. The active enzyme is a tetramer (α2β2) formed by two structurally and functionally different homodimeric proteins, denoted R1 (α2) and R2 (β2) (1Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). RNR reduces all four common ribonucleotides, thus a strict control system is required to maintain a balanced supply of deoxyribonucleotides. This control is mediated by a sophisticated allosteric regulation via two functionally different nucleotide binding sites in the R1 protein: the specificity site that dictates substrate selection by binding of effectors (dTTP, dGTP, dATP, or ATP), and the activity site that determines global enzymatic activity via effector (ATP or dATP) binding (2Reichard P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition to the allosteric regulation, activity is also controlled via cell cycle regulation (3Chabes A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 4Sun L. Jacobson B.A. Dien B.S. Srienc F. Fuchs J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2415-2426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Differences in structure, mechanism of catalysis, oxygen dependence, and substrate phosphorylation level divide ribonucleotide reductases into three classes (1Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Class I, which is the focus of this study, is found in all Eukaryota (except Euglena) and in many Eubacteria (5Eklund H. Uhlin U. Färnegårdh M. Logan D.T. Nordlund P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 177-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 6Poole A.M. Logan D.T. Sjöberg B-M. J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 55: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 7Stubbe J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Differences in allosteric regulation further divide the class I RNRs into two subclasses, Ia and Ib. The eukaryotic and approximately half of the sequenced eubacterial enzymes groups in class Ia. A few closely related γ-proteobacterial genomes, including that of Escherichia coli, encode both a class Ia and a class Ib operon. Only class Ia can support proliferation of E. coli under a variety of laboratory growth conditions (8Jordan A. Aragall E. Gibert I. Barbé J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The E. coli class Ia RNR is a well studied system in aspects of structure, allosteric regulation, and catalytic mechanism, and it serves as a model for class I RNRs in other organisms. The E. coli R1 monomer has a molecular mass of 85.7 kDa and consists of 761 amino acids, arranged in three domains: one mainly helical N-terminal domain (∼220 residues), a 10-stranded α/β barrel domain (∼480 residues), and a 70-residue αβααβ domain, which covers the bottom of the barrel (9Uhlin U. Eklund H. Nature. 1994; 370: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 10Uhlin U. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 358-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The active site is located in a cleft across the protein between the N-terminal and the barrel domain. The interaction area between the two R1 polypeptides is formed by the barrel helices αA (residues 234–250) and αB (residues 279–289), which are connected to the βB strand (residues 253–257) via two loop regions (residues 251–252 and 258–278). The longer of these loop regions (called loop 1) and part of the loop region subsequent to αB (residues 290–297, called loop 2) may also contribute to the dimer interaction as well as to the interaction of R1 with protein R2 (cf. Fig. 1). The dimer interaction is stabilized mainly by van der Waals contacts (Fig. 1B). Only a few interprotein hydrogen bonds and charged interactions can be found. Compared with the size of the R1 dimer (110 × 75 × 75 Å) these interactions are weak, and the buried surface area of 2600 Å2 (corresponding to 4% of the accessible surface of the monomers) is relatively small. Because of this it is obvious that the domains of the subunits can change their localization in relation to each other. The E. coli R2 monomer of 43.4 kDa comprises 375 amino acids (11Nordlund P. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 123-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Each monomer is made up of 13 α helices and two β strands (Fig. 1A). Tyr-122 that harbors the radical is buried within each monomer close to a di-iron center (Fig. 1A). Compared with R1, the dimer interaction in R2 is much tighter and has 18.5% of the accessible surface of the monomers buried in the dimer (11Nordlund P. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 123-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The interaction area has a hydrophobic patch in the center, which is surrounded by polar and charged interactions. Homology studies of different species have shown that neither the R2 protein-protein interactions nor the homologously interacting residues at the interface are conserved (11Nordlund P. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 123-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The interaction between R1 and R2 has been shown both biochemically (12.Uppsten, M. (2004) Crystallographic Studies on the Subunits and Holocomplex of Class Ib Ribonucleotide Reductase. Ph.D. thesis, Department of Molecular Biology, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, pp. 52, Uppsala, SwedenGoogle Scholar) and in the crystal structure (9Uhlin U. Eklund H. Nature. 1994; 370: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) to be dependent on the C-terminal part of protein R2. The crystal structure further revealed that the dimeric structure of R1 is complementary to a part of the R2 dimer, which led Uhlin and Eklund (9Uhlin U. Eklund H. Nature. 1994; 370: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) to build a model of the α2β2 holoenzyme (Fig. 1A). So far no crystal structure of the E. coli holoenzyme complex could be obtained; however, the holoenzyme from Salmonella typhimurium was recently solved at a resolution of 4 Å (12.Uppsten, M. (2004) Crystallographic Studies on the Subunits and Holocomplex of Class Ib Ribonucleotide Reductase. Ph.D. thesis, Department of Molecular Biology, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, pp. 52, Uppsala, SwedenGoogle Scholar). It partly supports the Uhlin and Eklund model. RNR from S. typhimurium belongs to class Ib, which lacks the 50 N-terminal residues and consequently has lost the allosteric activity site (2Reichard P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The Uhlin and Eklund model of the E. coli class Ia RNR (9Uhlin U. Eklund H. Nature. 1994; 370: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) provides a structural basis for theories concerning the allosteric regulation and catalytic mechanisms of the holoenzyme. Notably, the active site cysteine residues sit in the inner parts of the substrate pocket of R1, and the rigid structure of the α/β barrel makes it impossible to move them closer to the stable tyrosyl free radical in R2 by modeling (5Eklund H. Uhlin U. Färnegårdh M. Logan D.T. Nordlund P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 177-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). These points led to the theory of a long range radical transfer pathway (7Stubbe J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 9Uhlin U. Eklund H. Nature. 1994; 370: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 13Himo F. Siegbahn P.E.M. Chemical Rev. 2003; 103: 2421-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Such a reaction mechanism was substantiated by the observation that nine highly conserved amino acid residues constitute this pathway and that mutation in any of the nine residues inactivates the radical transfer (14.Ekberg, M. (2000) Radical Transfer in Ribonucleotide Reductase from Escherichia coli. Ph.D. thesis, Department of Molecular Biology, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, pp. 55, Uppsala, SwedenGoogle Scholar). This means that a complex of R1-R2 is necessary to form an active holoenzyme. Sequence alignments between E. coli and mouse R1 proteins show an overall high homology and therefore suggest a structural similarity. Nevertheless, the monomer-dimer equilibrium in solution seems to be different between the two. Purification of R1 protein from E. coli showed that its predominant structure is dimeric in the absence of any ligands or effectors (15Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 39-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), which led to the assumption that the α2β2 tetramer is the major active form of the enzyme in E. coli (9Uhlin U. Eklund H. Nature. 1994; 370: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Purification of R1 protein from mammalian sources, e.g. mouse (16Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 17Scott C.P. Kashlan O.B. Lear J.D. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1651-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), calf thymus (18Thelander L. Eriksson S. Åkerman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7426-7432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Ehrlich tumor cells (19Cory J.G. Fleischer A.E. Munro J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2898-2901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), showed that the protein appeared mostly in the monomeric form (20Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Further studies showed that the oligomerization status of mouse R1 is dependent on ligand binding to the allosteric specificity site (18Thelander L. Eriksson S. Åkerman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7426-7432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kashlan O.B. Scott C.P. Lear J.D. Cooperman B.S.

This is concordant with structural studies on E. coli, placing the specificity site at the R1 dimer (α2) interface (23Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramaswamy S. Ekberg M. Regnström K. Sjöberg B-M. Eklund H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). It also indicates that oligomerization and formation of an active holoenzyme is regulated by effectors close to the interface, which is supported by the fact that this area is sensitive to structural changes. In general, binding to R2 could also stabilize a loose dimer formation between R1 monomers (20Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant for the initial binding event between E. coli R1 and R2 (i.e. between one polypeptide of each homodimer) is 13 μm, whereas the KD of the fully associated holoenzyme is 0.2 μm (24Climent I. Sjöberg B-M. Huang C.Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4801-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to investigate how the dimer interaction area of protein R1 is constructed to gain a better understanding of the assembly process of RNR in E. coli and to explain differences in oligomerization status of R1 proteins from different species. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—NovaBlue E. coli (recA, endA, laclq) from Novagen were used for site-directed mutagenesis. E. coli BL21DE3 (B F–, dcm, ompT, hsdS(rB–mB–), gal (DE3)) from Novagen were used for overexpression. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments were performed on wild type pTB1 plasmid (Cbr), which is a pTZ18R plasmid derivative and contains the nrdA gene (25Åberg A. Hahne S. Karlsson M. Larsson A.

Growth Medium—Both strains were grown in Luria or Terrific Broth (TB) medium. The BL21DE3/pLysS strain used for overproduction of mutant R1 protein was grown in the presence of carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) and 2 drops of antifoam. Site-directed Mutagenesis on Double-stranded DNA—The site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pTB1 plasmids using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit by Stratagene with proofreading Pfx-DNA polymerase and standard oligonucleotide primers obtained from Invitrogen (Table I).Table IList of R1 mutations and primer sequencesMutationMutagenesis primer sequencesaUnderlined nucleotides denotes mismatches.N238A5′-GGT GAC AGC CTG GAT TCC ATC GCT GCC ACC TCC AGC GCG-3′V245K5′-CCT CCA GCG CGA TTA AAA AAT ACG TTT CCC AGC-3′A273N5′-CG ATT CGC GGT GGT GAA AAC TTC CAT ACC GGC TGC-3′T276Q5′-GGT GGT GAA GCG TTC CAT CAG GGC TGC ATT CC-3′A273N/T276Q5′-CG ATT CGC GGT GGT GAA AAC TTC CAT CAG GGC TGC ATT CCG TTC-3′H284F5′-GC ATT CCG TTC TAC AAG TTT TTC CAA ACA GCG GTG AAA TCC TGC-3′H284V5′-GC ATT CCG TTC TAC AAA GTT TTC CAG ACA GCG GTG AAA TCC-3′T287N5′-CG TTC TAC AAA CAT TTC CAG AAC GCG GTG AAA TCC TGC-3′a Underlined nucleotides denotes mismatches.

Sequencing gels were run at the Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology at the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm. No secondary mutations were found in the nrdA gene of any of the mutated pTB1 plasmids. Expression of Mutant Protein—Each modified R1 protein was expressed from its pTB1 plasmid in BL21DE3/pLysS cells. Typically, 1-liter cultures in LB or TB medium were grown at 37 °C with shaking in 5-liter flasks for at least three doublings. At an A600 of 0.4 protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm (26Sjöberg B.M. Hahne S. Karlsson M. Jörnvall H. Göransson M.

The protein content in 0.1 mg of cells was analyzed on SDS-PAGE using the Amersham Biosciences Phast system. Protein Extraction and Purification—Frozen cells were disintegrated in a X-press and resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Nucleic acids in the crude extracts were precipitated by addition of neutralized streptomycin sulfate to a final concentration of 2%. After centrifugation the proteins of the supernatant were precipitated by addition of ammonium sulfate to a saturation of 60% and collected by centrifugation. The pellet of ammonium sulfate precipitated protein was dissolved in 60% of buffer A (0.75 m (NH4)2SO4 and 5 mm DTT) and 40% of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 5 mm DTT) and loaded onto a 20-ml bed volume HiLoad® 16/10 Phenyl-Sepharose® High Performance column from Amersham Biosciences equilibrated with 0.75 m (NH4)2SO4. At a flow rate of 1 ml/min, the washing step was performed with 60 ml 0.75 m (NH4)2SO4 buffer followed by a 100-ml gradient from 0 to 100% of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm DTT. The 100% buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm DTT was then continued for another 140 ml. The R1 protein eluted, when the gradient reached 100% of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm DTT. Protein-containing fractions were analyzed on SDS-PAGE. R1-containing fractions were concentrated in a Millipore Amicon 8050-stirred cell, using a Biomax High Flow Ultrafiltration polyethersulfone membrane, and then stored at –80 °C. Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis under Native Conditions—The molecular mass and oligomerization status of wild type and mutant R1 proteins at different protein concentrations were estimated from native polyacrylamide gels (10–15%) using the Amersham Biosciences Phast system. A high molecular weight marker was run alongside each R1 protein to estimate the molecular mass and the oligomerization status of the sample. Gel Filtration—The molecular weight of mutant and wild type R1 proteins were analyzed by gel filtration on a 2-ml bed volume Superdex 200 column in a running buffer composed of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm DTT. Concentrations of R1 protein were varied as required between 0.025 and 25 mg/ml. Molecular mass markers (cytochrome c, 12.4 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 66 kDa; β-amylase, 200 kDa; and blue dextran, 2000 kDa) were run on the column to obtain a standard curve for determination of molecular masses. Gel Filtrations in the presence of Effectors—Wild type R1 and N238A proteins were analyzed in the same running buffer as above supplemented with one of the following nucleotides: 100 μm dTTP, 0.1 μm dATP, 1 μm dATP, 1.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GDP, or with a combination of 100 μm dTTP and. 0.5 mm GDP. Standard curves for each nucleotide(s) condition were performed as described above. Activity Assays—Ribonucleotide reductase activity was measured by the spectrophotometric assay or by the [3H]CDP assay as described previously (27Thelander L. Sjöberg B-M. Eriksson S. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Typically, assays contained 1.5 mm ATP, 11 mm Mg(Ac)2, 0.4 mm NADPH, 13 μm thioredoxin, 0.5 μm thioredoxin reductase, 30 μm EDTA, 34 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, and 10–15 μm R2 protein. The R1 concentration was varied between 0.06 and 0.8 μm, and the enzyme reaction was started by addition of cold or tritiated CDP substrate to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The consumption of NADPH was monitored during 5–10 min in the spectrophotometric assay, whereas the [3H]CDP assay was stopped after 10 min reaction time by addition of perchloric acid to 0.5 m and the production of tritiated dCDP measured as described (27Thelander L. Sjöberg B-M. Eriksson S. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin reductase and NADPH could be substituted by 10 mm DTT in the [3H]CDP assays without change in specific enzyme activity. The ribonucleotide reductase activity is defined in units/mg protein, which is the amount of protein R1 that converts 1 nmol of substrate per minute in the presence of an excess of R2 protein at 25 °C. The specific activity is expressed as units/mg of protein R1 or nmol/min·mg. Extinction coefficients were ϵ280–310 = 180,000 m–1 cm–1 for protein R1 and ϵ280–310 = 120,000 m–1 cm–1 for protein R2. Determination of R1-R2 Dissociation Constants—The R1-R2 protein interaction was measured by the [3H]CDP assay or by surface plasmon resonance measurements. In the [3H]CDP assay the KD for interaction of wild type or N238A R1 proteins with the R2 protein was determined according to the method by Climent et al. (28Climent I. Sjöberg B-M. Huang C.Y. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5164-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The R1 protein concentration was kept constant at 0.033 μm, and the concentration of the R2 protein was varied between 0.033 and 2 μm. KD values were calculated from plots of enzyme activity versus R2 protein concentration and non-linear curve fitting to Equation 1 (28Climent I. Sjöberg B-M. Huang C.Y. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5164-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).υ=Vmax⋅[KM+R2+R12R1−(KM+R2+R12R1)2−R2R1](Eq. 1) In the surface plasmon resonance assay the interaction of wild type or N238A R1 proteins with the R2 protein was studied using the Amersham Biosciences Biosensor (BIAcore) method. The KD of R1 protein N238A interacting with protein R2 in the presence of 100 μm positive allosteric effector (dTTP) and 1 mm substrate (GDP) was compared with R1 wild type as described previously (29Kasrayan A. Birgander P.L. Pappalardo L. Regnström K. Westman M. Slaby A. Gordon E. Sjöberg B-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31050-31057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). R1 (analyte) concentrations was varied between 0.05 and 4 μm, and the amount of R2 (ligand) coupled to the carboxymethylated dextran matrix membrane was varied between 679 and 1253 resonance units, corresponding to 0.68–1.25 ng of R2/mm2 surface. Nucleotide Binding Assay—The experimental procedure was carried out as described by Ormö and Sjöberg (30Ormö M. Sjöberg B-M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In experiments with dTTP, concentrations of 0.1–10 μm of the nucleotide and 3.7 μm of the R1 protein were used. Binding of dTTP in the presence of substrate was carried out as with dTTP but in the presence of 1 mm of GDP or 1 mm CDP. Binding experiments on the R1-R2 complex were performed in the presence of 7.5 μm of enzymatically inactive Y122F-R2 protein. All experiments were carried out at room temperature in Ultrafree-MC filter units with polysulfone membranes, molecular cut-off 30,000, obtained from Millipore. Labeled [methyl-3H]dTTP and cold dTTP was purchased from Amersham Biosciences (GE Healthcare). Kinetic data were obtained from a plot of the concentration of bound ligand per concentration of protein (V) versus concentration of free ligand (L). Fitting Equation 2 to the curve gives the dissociation constant (KD) and number of binding sites (n). All calculations were performed using KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software).V=n⋅L/(KD+L)(Eq. 2) In general all mutated proteins behaved like the wild type protein in the overproduction and purification procedures and were obtained in good yields, suggesting that the mutated proteins were stable under the same conditions as the wild type protein. R1 α-Polypeptide Interactions in Mutant R1 Proteins—Two complementary methods were used to compare the strength of the α-polypeptide interaction in the mutant proteins to that of wild type R1. In native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the electric force induces separation of weakly associated multimeric complexes and polypeptides are principally separated according to size. When loaded onto a native gel wild type R1 migrates solely as a monomer at concentrations below 1 mg/ml and in equilibrium between monomers and dimers at concentrations above 2 mg/ml. Three of the mutant R1 proteins (A273N, T276Q, and the double mutant A273N/T276Q) behaved as wild type R1 on the native gels, whereas the remaining five mutants (N238A, V245K, H284F/V, and T287N) all migrated principally as monomers even at the highest protein concentrations tested (8–20 mg/ml). Fig. 2 shows the behavior of wild type, N238A and V245K proteins, and Table II summarizes the behavior of all R1 proteins.Table IIQuaternary structure, enzyme activity, and protein R2 interaction of mutant R1 proteinsR1 proteinPosition in structureConcentration for dimer formationkcatKD R1-R2Native PAGEGel filtration[3H]CDPSPRaDissociation constant obtained using surface plasmon resonance.
