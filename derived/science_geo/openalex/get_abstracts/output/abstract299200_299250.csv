They invariably oviposited solo, emitting eggs in various developmental stages. Both juvenescent and senescent fish have functional ovotestes. Progeny (F3) were obtained via a selfed great grandparent, grandparent, and parent, the last two in isolation ab ovo."

It constitutes up to one-third of the labeled metabolic products of radiosulfate uptake by roots of sulfur-deficient corn, barley, and sunflower plants. This neutral, nonabsorbed zwitterion appears to be a useful reservoir for sulfur in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2028006972,"A series of histochemical tests performed on the mantle of the northern quahog Mercenaria mercenaria L. suggest that the epithelium of the inner surface of the first fold and the underlying secretory cells function together in the formation of the periostracum in this mollusk. The secretory cells supply a phenolic substrate which, when oxidized, provides quinones capable of tanning the periostracum."

On the other hand, the trapping of nonwetting phase in dead-end pores is a major influence on the shape of the nonwetting phase relative permeability curve. Laboratory experiments on porous media are suggested to test these network model predictions."

Data on yields indicate the average content of luciferin and luciferase to be, at best, about 1 microg of each in a single living organism."

The effects of nuclear orientation on alpha -, beta -, and gamma - emission angular distributions are outlined. Attention is devoted to beta decay and parity nonconservation. The achievement of nuclear cooling'' by a method analogous to that used in the isentropic demagnetization of paramagnetic salts is described. (T.F.H.)"

https://openalex.org/W1966217709,"For convenience, we summarize below some of the main advantages of the IGM concept. 1) Most organizations can mount and support intensive field operations for short periods. 2) High-quality data would be obtained, and the data could be processed more promptly than in long-term projects. 3) Laboratory equipment could in many instances be mnade available for field operations. 4) Top-caliber researchers would be available for field operations. 5) The participation of small research groups and of research workers from government and industry would be fostered. 6) Student participation would improve educational programs in, and attract needed talent to, the geophysical sciences. 7) Ship, satellite, and rocket observations could be scheduled for IGM's. 8) International scientific conferences scheduled to follow IGM's would attract working scientists. It is not suggested that these short-term exercises should replace the long synoptic programs characteristic of the IGY. Rather it is proposed that they supplement and guide any such future long-term program. If adopted, they would produce many data of value for the planning and timing of the International Year of the Quiet Sun. To bring emphasis on special observations during the IQSY, International Geophysical Months might well be scheduled to coincide with the June and December solstices, to be followed by an IGM at an equinoctial period. This would provide periods for concentrated sampling-periods in somewhat the same category as the Regular World Intervals adopted during the IGY. The more elaborate experiments could be confined to the International Geophysical Months, so that only those studies for which continuous observations are essential would be scheduled for the entire period. The duration of an International Geophysical Month would be sufficient for carrying out experiments requiring moving platforms such as ships, rockets, or satellites. It is recommended that every effort be made to schedule the first IGM during the June solstice in 1962. This initial effort could well be followed by the scheduling of IGM's during the December solstice in 1962 and the March equinox in 1963. These exercises would provide information important to the planning and scheduling of the IQSY (1)."
