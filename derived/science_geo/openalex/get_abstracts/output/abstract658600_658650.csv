https://openalex.org/W3081073771,"Coronaviruses are prone to transmission to new host species, as recently demonstrated by the spread to humans of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic1. Small animal models that recapitulate SARS-CoV-2 disease are needed urgently for rapid evaluation of medical countermeasures2,3. SARS-CoV-2 cannot infect wild-type laboratory mice owing to inefficient interactions between the viral spike protein and the mouse orthologue of the human receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)4. Here we used reverse genetics5 to remodel the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and mouse ACE2 and designed mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 MA), a recombinant virus that can use mouse ACE2 for entry into cells. SARS-CoV-2 MA was able to replicate in the upper and lower airways of both young adult and aged BALB/c mice. SARS-CoV-2 MA caused more severe disease in aged mice, and exhibited more clinically relevant phenotypes than those seen in Hfh4-ACE2 transgenic mice, which express human ACE2 under the control of the Hfh4 (also known as Foxj1) promoter. We demonstrate the utility of this model using vaccine-challenge studies in immune-competent mice with native expression of mouse ACE2. Finally, we show that the clinical candidate interferon-λ1a (IFN-λ1a) potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human airway epithelial cells in vitro-both prophylactic and therapeutic administration of IFN-λ1a diminished SARS-CoV-2 replication in mice. In summary, the mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 MA model demonstrates age-related disease pathogenesis and supports the clinical use of pegylated IFN-λ1a as a treatment for human COVID-196."

To study how spectral representation is transformed through modular subsystems of successive cortical areas, we undertook simultaneous optical imaging of intrinsic signals in macaque V1, V2, and V4, supplemented by higher-resolution electrophysiology and two-photon imaging in awake macaques. We find a progressive evolution in the scale and precision of chromotopic maps, expressed by a uniform blob-like architecture of hue responses within each area. Two-photon imaging reveals enhanced hue-specific cell clustering in V2 compared with V1. A phenomenon of endspectral (red and blue) responses that is clear in V1, recedes in V2, and is virtually absent in V4. The increase in mid- and extra-spectral hue representations through V2 and V4 reflects the nature of hierarchical processing as higher areas read out locations in chromatic space from progressive integration of signals relayed by V1.

Understanding how the spectral reflectance of a surface ultimately results in the perception of a color has been the remit of both scientists and artists over the centuries (Conway, 2012Conway B.R.

Human and macaque perceptual color space is three dimensional, inherent in the trichromatic sampling of the spectrum by long-, medium-, and short-wavelength (L, M, and S) sensitive cones in the retina. The chromatic plane of color space (Figure 1A) derives from two forms of cone opponency: L versus M, and S versus L+M, that are transmitted from retinal ganglion cells through parvocelluar and koniocellular neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) before entering the early visual cortex for further processing (Chatterjee and Callaway, 2002Chatterjee S.

The cytochrome oxidase (CO) blobs of V1 are the first cortical site of parvo and konio convergence. Single-unit electrophysiological studies of CO blobs have reported cell classes sensitive to either red/green or blue/yellow color contrast, the latter in a minority (Livingstone and Hubel, 1984Livingstone M.S. Hubel D.H. Anatomy and physiology of a color system in the primate visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 1984; 4: 309-356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with some suggestion that individual blobs are dominated by one or the other (Landisman and Ts’o, 2002aLandisman C.E. Ts’o D.Y.

The canonical color pathway (Figure 1B) then relays from the CO blobs of V1 through CO thin stripes of V2 to color-specialized domains of V4 and posterior inferotemporal cortex (PIT) referred to as “globs” (Chen et al., 2008Chen G.

Conway B.R. Parallel, multi-stage processing of colors, faces and shapes in macaque inferior temporal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1870-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). How this integration of chromatic information is subserved by anatomical color pathways has yet to be fully resolved. Hue is a quantitative perceptual attribute of color commonly used to describe the stimulus position within the visible spectrum (Figure 1A). As “color processing,” broadly defined, can incorporate a contribution to cue-invariant form vision, we refer more narrowly to spectral hue processing that, empirically, we attribute to modules better activated by chromatic contrast than achromatic luminance contrast. Previous optical imaging of intrinsic signal (OIS) studies adopting this criterion have confirmed the co-localization of chromatic response domains with CO blobs in V1 and thin CO stripes in V2 (Landisman and Ts’o, 2002bLandisman C.E.

A spatially organized representation of colour in macaque cortical area V2.Nature. 2003; 421: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and the segregation of such modules in V4 (Tanigawa et al., 2010Tanigawa H. Lu H.D. Roe A.W. Functional organization for color and orientation in macaque V4.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Hue maps have been separately recorded in V1 blobs (Xiao et al., 2007Xiao Y. Casti A. Xiao J. Kaplan E. Hue maps in primate striate cortex.Neuroimage. 2007; 35: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), V2 thin stripes (Lim et al., 2009Lim H. Wang Y. Xiao Y. Hu M. Felleman D.J.

Tsao D.Y. Color-tuned neurons are spatially clustered according to color preference within alert macaque posterior inferior temporal cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 18034-18039Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar; Li et al., 2014Li M. Liu F. Juusola M. Tang S. Perceptual color map in macaque visual area V4.J.

Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These hue maps appear to be organized in a chromotopically structured manner; i.e., similar hues activate neighboring cortical positions, but how they reflect perceptual color space is unknown. In addition, the response of intrinsic signals are heavily biased in favor of red and blue hues, particularly in V1 (Valverde Salzmann et al., 2012Valverde Salzmann M.F. Bartels A. Logothetis N.K. Schüz A. Color blobs in cortical areas V1 and V2 of the new world monkey Callithrix jacchus, revealed by non-differential optical imaging.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 7881-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar; Xiao et al., 2007Xiao Y. Casti A. Xiao J. Kaplan E. Hue maps in primate striate cortex.Neuroimage. 2007; 35: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This endspectral response within V1 and its CO blobs, first reported utilizing the 2DG technique even after equating relative saturation (Tootell et al., 1988Tootell R.B.H. Silverman M.S. Hamilton S.L. De Valois R.L. Switkes E. Functional anatomy of macaque striate cortex. III. Color.J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 1569-1593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was also reported in human fMRI (Nasr and Tootell, 2018Nasr S. Tootell R.B.H. Columnar organization of mid-spectral and end-spectral hue preferences in human visual cortex.Neuroimage. 2018; 181: 748-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). A recent study using 2-photon calcium imaging confirms the preponderance of cells preferring red and blue hues in V1, while failing to identify chromatic heterogeneity among blobs (Garg et al., 2019Garg A.K. Li P. Rashid M.S. Callaway E.M. Color and orientation are jointly coded and spatially organized in primate primary visual cortex.Science. 2019; 364: 1275-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We may conceive of an idealized cortical hue map as isometrically organized, whereby hue responses are equally weighted and the spatial organization of cortical hue-response loci approximates the planar metric of perceptual color space. What remains unclear is how hue maps within the anatomical color modules evolve with hierarchical processing from V1 to V4—given that single units sampled at a still higher level (PIT cortex) do appear to provide a more uniform representation of perceptual color space (Bohon et al., 2016Bohon K.S. Hermann K.L. Hansen T. Conway B.R. Representation of Perceptual Color Space in Macaque Posterior Inferior Temporal Cortex (the V4 Complex).eneuro. 2016; 3 (0039-0016.2016)Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Does the chromotopic pattern of response in V1 persist or transform into something closer to the idealized isometric organization defined above? To address these questions, we probed spectrally specific responses with various chromatic stimuli (Figures 1A, 1C, and 1D), performing simultaneous intrinsic optical imaging of V1, V2, and V4 in the same anesthetized macaque preparation, allied to electrophysiological recordings (V1, V2, and V4) and 2-photon imaging (V1 and V2) in awake macaques. Deploying multiple techniques across these cortical areas enables us to quantify the similarities and differences at both cellular and population levels, examining how spectral responses develops progressively along the primate ventral visual pathway. We first used either red/green (RG) or blue/yellow (BY) gratings matched to achromatic gratings to reveal chromatic response domains (Figures 2A–2C and S1). Figure S1A shows an example where RG stimulation strongly activated blob shaped color-response domains in V1, V2 thin stripes, and V4, avoiding direct, concentric overlap with orientation-response domains, as previously reported (An et al., 2012An X. Gong H. Qian L. Wang X. Pan Y. Zhang X. Yang Y. Wang W. Distinct functional organizations for processing different motion signals in V1, V2, and V4 of macaque.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 13363-13379Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar; Lu and Roe, 2008Lu H.D. Roe A.W.

Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Similar segregated activations in V2 and V4 are shown for a second example with the orientation responses displayed as a polar orientation map (some fainter orientation responses are visible within the color domains; Figure S1B). In summary, our results are consistent with earlier single-unit recordings and optical imaging data (Landisman and Ts’o, 2002bLandisman C.E. Ts’o D.Y.

Segregation and convergence of functionally defined V2 thin stripe and interstripe compartment projections to area V4 of macaques.Cereb. Cortex. 1999; 9: 792-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), in demonstrating modular subsystems for processing color across macaque V1, V2, and V4. The color-response domains concurrently activated by RG gratings are blob-like, notably larger, and more widely spaced in V2 than in V1 (Figure 2A). Likewise, Figure 2B shows co-activated color-response blobs across V1, V2, and V4. The domain size of unprocessed V4 color responses (Figure 2C) was substantially larger, roughly equating in scale to the color “globs” measured at several millimeters in diameter by fMRI (Conway et al., 2007Conway B.R. Moeller S. Tsao D.Y. Specialized color modules in macaque extrastriate cortex.Neuron. 2007; 56: 560-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The smaller foci that we refer to as color-response blobs emerged after further processing. This finding of the color-response blobs within each area was common to all animals examined (Figures S2A and S2B). The sum activation achieved by our set of seven single-hue stimuli (red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple) should theoretically provide a better index of color-response domain size than the partial activation revealed by RG gratings alone. These single-hue stimuli were square-wave gratings coupled to an achromatic grating of matching luminance contrast and spatial frequency (SF; Figure 1D) aiming to elicit maximal neural responses from the surface of cortex containing single- and double-opponent color-sensitive cells (Friedman et al., 2003Friedman H.S.

Chromatic mechanisms in striate cortex of macaque.J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 649-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sizes of color-response blobs were compiled from the envelope of the response domains elicited by single-hue stimuli, where all pixels exceeded a threshold response level at three standard deviations (SDs) above the baseline (see STAR Methods). This criterion of physiological measurements was verified for V1 in conjunction with V1 histological CO-staining from three hemispheres (an example case is shown in Figure 2D). CO blob boundaries were determined by standard image-processing methods (An et al., 2012An X. Gong H. Qian L. Wang X. Pan Y. Zhang X. Yang Y. Wang W.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10087-10093Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The average diameter of blobs was 292 ± 5 μm (mean ± SE), consistent with previous reports (Farias et al., 1997Farias M.F. Gattass R. Piñón M.C. Ungerleider L.G. Tangential distribution of cytochrome oxidase-rich blobs in the primary visual cortex of macaque monkeys.J. Comp. Neurol. 1997; 386: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar; Solomon, 2002Solomon S.G. Striate cortex in dichromatic and trichromatic marmosets: neurochemical compartmentalization and geniculate input.J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 450: 366-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The image alignment gave an average shift of 91 ± 36 μm (mean ± SD) between a CO blob and the corresponding color-response blob (attributable to differential histological shrinkage)—comparable to a previous study using the same method (Valverde Salzmann et al., 2012Valverde Salzmann M.F. Bartels A. Logothetis N.K. Schüz A. Color blobs in cortical areas V1 and V2 of the new world monkey Callithrix jacchus, revealed by non-differential optical imaging.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 7881-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). After correcting for histological shrinkage of the imaged tissue, CO blobs were similar in size to color-response blobs set at the 3-SD criterion. Figure 2E shows that there was no statistical difference in their mean area size (CO blob: 0.109 ± 0.003 mm2, V1 response blob: 0.105 ± 0.004 mm2, mean ± SE), empirically validating our procedure for measurement of color-response blob size in V1. Applying the same criterion, we found that the sizes of color blobs in V2 (0.268 ± 0.013 mm2) and V4 (0.235 ± 0.014 mm2) were comparable, and that both were significantly larger than those in V1 (Figure 2F). We note, in addition, that the cortical organization of orientation preference domains obeys a similar size principle. The sizes of concurrently recorded orientation domains are equivalent in V2 and V4 but significantly larger than those in V1 (Figure S2C). In summary, the functional architecture of color-response blobs in V1 is retained hierarchically across V2 and in V4, with a larger blob size in both areas. A major aim of this study was to investigate how color signals are transformed across three successive visual areas. Previous studies have demonstrated endspectral response bias in V1 (Garg et al., 2019Garg A.K. Li P. Rashid M.S. Callaway E.M.

Brain Res. 1996; 76: 71-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), so we asked whether this response asymmetry extends to V2 and V4. To examine the same population of color-response blobs identified by the procedures described above (151 blobs in V1, 80 in V2, and 86 in V4), we defined the individual hue response power as the product of the strength and the size of response to each hue within each color-response blob (i.e., the mean pixel signal strength multiplied by the number of pixels activated by each hue). We then computed the power ratio of each hue as the response power for that hue divided by the sum of all the response powers within the same color-response blob. Finally, averaging across all color-response blobs within each area, we obtained mean response power ratios for V1, V2, and V4, shown as a rose plot in Figure 3A. As expected, in V1 the priority of red, followed by blue is obvious. However, this endspectral response lessens in V2 and is further diminished in V4 where the hue response profile is statistically more uniform than V1 and V2. Boxplots verify that the mean response power ratio is significantly greater to red than to other hues in both V1 and V2 and that this precedence wanes in V4 (Figure 3B). The priority of blue to the five hues other than red is notable in V1 but absent from V2 and V4 (Figure S3A). Intrigued by this outcome, we added a complementary analysis of spectral variation of LFP responses recorded in a separate study of alert animals. Figures 3C and S3C show average rectified current traces obtained in LFP recordings from supragranular layers in V1, V2, and V4. Statistical comparison (Figure 3D) of current amplitude between red and other hues shows the current amplitude to red is largest in V1 and V2 but attains parity with most other hues in V4. Similar to intrinsic signals, in V1 we find that blue is inferior to red while ranking above the other hues but loses this status in V2 and V4 (Figures S3B and S3D). A sample of single unit data from the same awake monkey recordings (Figure S4) reflects the same pattern observed in population recordings from both intrinsic signals and LFP responses, demonstrating that the population hue response changes from one of endspectral dominance in V1 to a markedly more uniform distribution in V4. To establish population responses at single-cell resolution, we applied 2-photon calcium imaging in V1 and V2 of two alert monkeys. Experiments were conducted using the identical set of seven test hues, here taking the form of small, static patches isoluminant to the achromatic background. In 2-photon imaging, we recorded 3,608 visual-responsive V1 neurons (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05) and 233 visual-responsive V2 neurons from one monkey, and 6,202 visual-responsive V2 neurons from a second monkey. Figure 4A illustrates the calcium responses of six cells sampled from a color blob in either area, showing various forms of spectral tuning. The population of cells recorded at each site, coded by preferred hue, is shown in Figure 4B. Cell counts of preferred hues across all sampled sites in either area show that the frequency of cells preferring red and blue is larger than for all other hues (Figure S5A). For V1, these results are consistent with our findings above and previous population (Tootell et al., 1988Tootell R.B.H. Silverman M.S. Hamilton S.L. De Valois R.L. Switkes E.

https://openalex.org/W3081414515,"The mammalian genome has hundreds of nuclear-encoded tRNAs, but the contribution of individual tRNA genes to cellular and organismal function remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that mutations in a neuronally enriched arginine tRNA, n-Tr20, increased seizure threshold and altered synaptic transmission. n-Tr20 expression also modulated seizures caused by an epilepsy-linked mutation in Gabrg2, a gene encoding a GABAA receptor subunit. Loss of n-Tr20 altered translation initiation by activating the integrated stress response and suppressing mTOR signaling, the latter of which may contribute to altered neurotransmission in mutant mice. Deletion of a highly expressed isoleucine tRNA similarly altered these signaling pathways in the brain, suggesting that regulation of translation initiation is a conserved response to tRNA loss. Our data indicate that loss of a single member of a tRNA family results in multiple cellular phenotypes, highlighting the disease-causing potential of tRNA mutations."
https://openalex.org/W3080438153,"Black soldier fly (BSF) (Hermetia illucens L.) is one of the most efficient bio-waste recyclers. Although, waste substrate amendments with biochar or gypsum during composting process are known to enhance nutrient retention, their impact on agro-industrial waste have not been documented. Hence, this study focuses on a comparative effect of agro-industrial waste amended with biochar and gypsum on BSF larval performance, waste degradation, and nitrogen (N) and potassium retention in frass fertilizer. Brewery spent grain was amended with biochar or gypsum at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20% to determine the most effective rates of inclusion. Amending feedstock with 20% biochar significantly increased wet (89%) and dried (86%) larval yields than the control (unamended feedstock). However, amendment with 15% gypsum caused decrease in wet (34%) and dried (30%) larval yields but conserved the highest amount of N in frass. Furthermore, the inclusion of 20% biochar recorded the highest frass fertilizer yield and gave a 21% increase in N retention in frass fertilizer, while biomass conversion rate was increased by 195% compared to the control. Feedstock amendment with 5% biochar had the highest waste degradation efficiency. Potassium content in frass fertilizer was also significantly enhanced with biochar amendment. At maturity, frass compost with more than 10% inclusion rate of biochar had the highest cabbage seed germination indices (>100%). The findings of this study revealed that initial composting of biochar amended feedstocks using BSF larvae can significantly shorten compost maturity time to 5 weeks with enhanced nutrient recycling compared to the conventional composting methods."
https://openalex.org/W3081828789,"Background Maternity continuum of care is a model of integrated components of maternal health service from pregnancy to the post-partum period to improve maternal, neonatal and child health. In Ethiopia, the magnitude of antenatal care, skilled delivery, and post-natal care have shown improvement. However, there is limited evidence of the woman who attends continuing from antenatal care to post-partum care. Objective To assess completion of maternity continuum of care and its associated factors among women, in Motta town and Hulet Eji Enese district, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A community based cross-sectional study with a stratified cluster sampling technique was conducted among 819 women 6week-6month post-partum period in Motta town and Hulet Eji Enese district. The data were collected from March 12, 2019 to April1, 2019 by face to face interviews, using a pretested structured questionnaire. Binary logistic regression (bi-variable and multivariable) model was done. Adjusted odds ratio with respect to 95% confidence interval was employed in the strength and direction of the association between covariates and outcome variable. Besides, a P value<0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. Results A total of 819 women with100% response rate participated and Completion of maternity continuum of care was found to be 47% (43.2%-50.2%) in the study. Educational attainment of Secondary school and above (adjusted odds ratio(AOR) = 3.5; 1.9–6.3), urban residence (AOR = 4.6; 95%CI 2.5–8.5), women reach to a health facility within 30minute(AOR = 2.1; 95%CI 1.2–3.7), a woman was the primary decision maker for attending maternity continuum of care(AOR = 3.5;95%CI 1.9–6.3), index pregnancy-related complication(AOR = 2.4;95%CI 1.1–5.3), starting antenatal care within second trimester (AOR = 3.4;95%CI 2.1–5.6) and antenatal care visit 3–4 times(AOR = 2.1;95%CI 1.2–3.8) were statistically significant with completion of maternity continuum of care. Conclusions The completion of maternity continuum of care is low in the study area. Improving the educational status of women, engaging the rural community, physical accessibility of health facility, woman empowerment for decision making, emphasis on giving care for pregnancy-related complication, and early gestational age antenatal care at least 3 or more visits suggested to increase completion of maternity continuum of care."

The highest levels of circulating DPP3 (cDPP3) are found in non-survivor septic shock patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefits of inhibiting cDPP3 by a specific antibody, Procizumab (PCZ), on cardiac function in an experimental model of sepsis, the caecal ligature and puncture (CLP) model. Rats were monitored by invasive blood pressure and echocardiography. Results are presented as mean ± SD, with p <0.05 considered significant. PCZ rapidly restored left ventricular shortening fraction (from 39 ± 4% to 51 ± 2% before and 30 min after PCZ administration (p = 0.004)). Cardiac output and stroke volume were higher in the CLP + PCZ group when compared to the CLP + PBS group (152 ± 33 mL/min vs 97 ± 25 mL/min (p = 0.0079), and 0.5 ± 0.1 mL vs 0.3 ± 1.0 mL (p = 0.009), respectively) with a markedly reduced plasma DPP3 activity (138 ± 70 U/L in CLP + PCZ group versus 735 ± 255 U/L (p = 0.048) in the CLP + PBS group). Of note, PCZ rapidly reduced oxidative stress in the heart of the CLP + PCZ group when compared to those of the CLP + PBS group (13.3 ± 8.2 vs 6.2 ± 2.5 UI, p = 0.005, 120 min after administration, respectively). Our study demonstrates that inhibition of cDPP3 by PCZ restored altered cardiac function during sepsis in rats."
https://openalex.org/W3028713215,"In the article a virus transmission model is constructed on a simplified social network. The social network consists of more than 2 million nodes, each representing an inhabitant of Slovenia. The nodes are organised and interconnected according to the real household and elderly-care center distribution, while their connections outside these clusters are semi-randomly distributed and undirected. The virus spread model is coupled to the disease progression model. The ensemble approach with the perturbed transmission and disease parameters is used to quantify the ensemble spread, a proxy for the forecast uncertainty. The presented ongoing forecasts of COVID-19 epidemic in Slovenia are compared with the collected Slovenian data. Results show that at the end of the first epidemic wave, the infection was twice more likely to transmit within households/elderly care centers than outside them. We use an ensemble of simulations (N = 1000) and data assimilation approach to estimate the COVID-19 forecast uncertainty and to inversely obtain posterior distributions of model parameters. We found that in the uncontrolled epidemic, the intrinsic uncertainty mostly originates from the uncertainty of the virus biology, i.e. its reproduction number. In the controlled epidemic with low ratio of infected population, the randomness of the social network becomes the major source of forecast uncertainty, particularly for the short-range forecasts. Virus transmission models with accurate social network models are thus essential for improving epidemics forecasting."
https://openalex.org/W3080181216,"Background Sri Lanka diagnosed its first local case of COVID-19 on 11 March 2020. The government acted swiftly to contain transmission, with extensive public health measures. At the end of 30 days, Sri Lanka had 197 cases, 54 recovered and 7 deaths; a staged relaxing of the lockdown is now underway. This paper proposes a theoretical basis for estimating the limits within which transmission should be constrained in order to ensure that the case load remains within the capacity of Sri Lanka’s health system. Methods We used the Susceptible, Infected, Recovered (SIR) model to explore the number of new infections and estimate ICU bed requirement at different levels of R0 values after lifting lockdown restrictions. We developed a web-based application that enables visualization of cases and ICU bed requirements with time, with adjustable parameters that include: population at risk; number of identified and recovered cases; percentage identified; infectious period; R0 or doubling time; percentage critically ill; available ICU beds; duration of ICU stay; and uncertainty of projection. Results The three-day moving average of the caseload suggested two waves of transmission from Day 0 to 17 (R0 = 3.32, 95% CI 1.85–5.41) and from Day 18–30 (R = 1.25, 95%CI: 0.93–1.63). We estimate that if there are 156 active cases with 91 recovered at the time of lifting lockdown restrictions, and R increases to 1.5 (doubling time 19 days), under the standard parameters for Sri Lanka, the ICU bed capacity of 300 is likely to be saturated by about 100 days, signaled by 18 new infections (95% CI 15–22) on Day 14 after lifting lockdown restrictions. Conclusion Our model suggests that to ensure that the case load remains within the available capacity of the health system after lifting lockdown restrictions, transmission should not exceed R = 1.5. This model and the web-based application may be useful in other low and middle income countries which have similar constraints on health resources."
https://openalex.org/W3081637008,"Background Vaccination is the most important preventive measure for protection against infectious diseases in humans and companion animals. Nevertheless, scepticism about the safety and importance of vaccines is increasing in human and in veterinary medicine. Although owner attitudes towards vaccination have been investigated in cats, there are no similar studies in dogs. The goals of this study were therefore to investigate the vaccination status of dogs in Germany, to determine owner compliance with vaccination and to identify factors that play a role in owners’ decisions to have their dogs vaccinated. Methods Data were collected from August 2018 to February 2019 using an online survey targeting dog owners in Germany. A total of 3,881 questionnaires were evaluated, and factors associated with the vaccination status of dogs were determined by a linear logistic regression model using Akaike information criterion. Cohen's kappa statistic was used to evaluate agreement between questionnaire and 340 vaccination passports submitted voluntarily by owners. Results A total of 46.8% (n = 1,818/3,881) of dogs were vaccinated with core vaccines according to current guidelines with the lowest vaccination rate for leptospirosis (50.1%; n = 1,941/3,874). Dog’s age (16 weeks to 15 months) (odds ratio (OR): 3.08; 95% CI: 2.05–4.68), type (working dog) (OR: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.22–3.53) and travelling abroad within previous 36 months (OR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.12–2.96) had the strongest ‘positive’ association with the vaccination status. Recommendation from a veterinarian not to vaccinate against leptospirosis had the strongest ‘negative’ association (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.04–0.18). Conclusion The study revealed a need for improvement in vaccination compliance because of inadequate vaccination coverage, especially for leptospirosis, in dogs. Factors influencing owner compliance were numerous. Vaccination recommendations made by the veterinarian had a strong association with the vaccination status and should be used to increase canine vaccination rates."
https://openalex.org/W3080586706,"Moving Bed Biofilm Reactors (MBBRs) can efficiently treat wastewater by incorporating suspended biocarriers that provide attachment surfaces for active microorganisms. The performance of MBBRs for wastewater treatment is, among other factors, contingent upon the characteristics of the surface area of the biocarriers. Thus, novel biocarrier topology designs can potentially increase MBBR performance in a significant manner. The goal of this work is to assess the performance of 3-D-printed biofilter media biocarriers with varying surface area designs for use in nitrifying MBBRs for wastewater treatment. Mathematical models, rendering, and 3D printing were used to design and fabricate gyroid-shaped biocarriers with a high degree of complexity at three different levels of specific surface area (SSA), generally providing greater specific surface areas than currently available commercial designs. The biocarriers were inoculated with a nitrifying bacteria community, and tested in a series of batch reactors for ammonia conversion to nitrate, in three different experimental configurations: constant fill ratio, constant total surface area, and constant biocarrier media count. Results showed that large and medium SSA gyroid biocarriers delivered the best ammonia conversion performance of all designs, and significantly better than that of a standard commercial design. The percentage of ammonia nitrogen conversion at 8 hours for the best performing biocarrier design was: 99.33% (large SSA gyroid, constant fill ratio), 94.74% (medium SSA gyroid, constant total surface area), and 92.73% (large SSA gyroid, constant biocarrier media count). Additionally, it is shown that the ammonia conversion performance was correlated to the specific surface area of the biocarrier, with the greatest rates of ammonia conversion (99.33%) and nitrate production (2.7 mg/L) for manufactured gyroid biocarriers with a specific surface area greater than 1980.5 m2/m3. The results suggest that the performance of commercial MBBRs for wastewater treatment can be greatly improved by manipulation of media design through topology optimization."
https://openalex.org/W3081099400,"Prematurity has been identified as a risk factor for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The link between Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and birth-week has not been strongly evidenced. We evaluated the correlation between the degree of prematurity and the incidence of autism in a cohort of 871 children born prematurely and followed from birth. The cohort was reduced to 416 premature infants born between 2011-2017 who were followed for 2-14 years, and analyzed according to birth week (degree of prematurity), and according to gender.43 children (10.3%) received a definite diagnosis of ASD. There was a significant correlation between birth week and the risk of ASD, with 22.6% of children diagnosed with ASD when born at 25 weeks, versus 6% of ASD diagnoses at 31 weeks of prematurity. For children born after 32 weeks, the incidence decreased to 8-12.5%. A strong link was found between earlier birth week and increased autism risk; the risk remained elevated during near-term prematurity in boys. A correlation between early birth week and an elevated risk for ASD was seen in all children, but accentuated in females, gradually decreasing as birth week progresses; in males the risk for ASD remains elevated for any birth week.A statistically significant increase in rates of autism was found with each additional week of prematurity. Females drove this direct risk related to degree of prematurity, while males had an elevated risk throughout prematurity weeks, even at near-term. We recommend including ASD screening in follow up of infants born prematurely, at all levels of prematurity."
https://openalex.org/W3033151968,"Climate change has become intertwined with the global economy. Here, we describe the importance of inertia to continued growth in energy consumption. Drawing from thermodynamic arguments, and using 38 years of available statistics between 1980 to 2017, we find a persistent time-independent scaling between the historical time integral $W$ of world inflation-adjusted economic production $Y$, or $W\left(t\right) = \int_0^t Y\left(t'\right)dt'$, and current rates of world primary energy consumption $\mathcal E$, such that $\lambda = \mathcal{E}/W = 5.9\pm0.1$ Gigawatts per trillion 2010 US dollars. This empirical result implies that population expansion is a symptom rather than a cause of the current exponential rise in $\mathcal E$ and carbon dioxide emissions $C$, and that it is past innovation of economic production efficiency $Y/\mathcal{E}$ that has been the primary driver of growth, at predicted rates that agree well with data. Options for stabilizing $C$ are then limited to rapid decarbonization of $\mathcal E$ through sustained implementation of over one Gigawatt of renewable or nuclear power capacity per day. Alternatively, assuming continued reliance on fossil fuels, civilization could shift to a steady-state economy that devotes economic production exclusively to maintenance rather than expansion. If this were instituted immediately, continual energy consumption would still be required, so atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations would not balance natural sinks until concentrations exceeded 500 ppmv, and double pre-industrial levels if the steady-state was attained by 2030."
https://openalex.org/W3080336541,"An essential aspect of medical research is the prediction for a health outcome and the scientific identification of important factors. As a result, numerous methods were developed for model selections in recent years. In the era of big data, machine learning has been broadly adopted for data analysis. In particular, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) has an excellent performance in classifications and predictions with the high-dimensional data. In this research, a novel model selection strategy is carried out, named as the Stepwise Support Vector Machine (StepSVM). The new strategy is based on the SVM to conduct a modified stepwise selection, where the tuning parameter could be determined by 10-fold cross-validation that minimizes the mean squared error. Two popular methods, the conventional stepwise logistic regression model and the SVM Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE), were compared to the StepSVM. The Stability and accuracy of the three strategies were evaluated by simulation studies with a complex hierarchical structure. Up to five variables were selected to predict the dichotomous cancer remission of a lung cancer patient. Regarding the stepwise logistic regression, the mean of the C-statistic was 69.19%. The overall accuracy of the SVM-RFE was estimated at 70.62%. In contrast, the StepSVM provided the highest prediction accuracy of 80.57%. Although the StepSVM is more time consuming, it is more consistent and outperforms the other two methods."

Cigarette smoking is closely associated with cardiovascular disease and cancers; however, there is a lack of evidence to prove that smoking is harmful for kidney health. Therefore, we aimed to determine the relationship between cigarette smoking and CKD among healthy middle-aged adults.Using the database from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study, we analyzed 8,661 participants after excluding those with baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)<60 ml/min/1.72 m2 or proteinuria. Exposure of interest was smoking status: never-, former-, and current-smokers. Primary outcome was incident CKD defined as eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or newly developed proteinuria.The mean age of the subjects was 52 years, and 47.6% of them were males. There were 551 (6.4%) and 1,255 (14.5%) subjects with diabetes and hypertension, respectively. The mean eGFR was 93.0 ml/min/1.73 m2. Among the participants, 5,140 (59.3%), 1,336 (15.4%), and 2,185 (25.2%) were never-smokers, former-smokers, and current-smokers, respectively. During a median follow-up of 11.6 years, incident CKD developed in 1,941 (22.4%) subjects with a crude incidence rate of 25.1 (24.0-26.2) per 1,000 person-years. The multivariable Cox regression analysis after adjustment of confounding factors showed hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of 1.13 (0.95-1.35) and 1.26 (1.07-1.48) for CKD development in the former- and current-smokers, compared with never-smokers.This study showed that smoking was associated with a higher risk of incident CKD among healthy middle-aged adults."

The proposed family is called type-I heavy tailed family. A special model of the proposed class, named Type-I Heavy Tailed Weibull (TI-HTW) model is studied in detail. We adopt the approach of maximum likelihood estimation for estimating its parameters, and assess the maximum likelihood performance based on biases and mean squared errors via a Monte Carlo simulation framework. Actuarial quantities such as value at risk and tail value at risk are derived. A simulation study for these actuarial measures is conducted, proving that the proposed TI-HTW is a heavy-tailed model. Finally, we provide a comparative study to illustrate the proposed method by analyzing three real data sets from different disciplines such as reliability engineering, bio-medical and financial sciences. The analytical results of the new TI-HTW model are compared with the Weibull and some other non-nested distributions. The Baysesian analysis is discussed to measure the model complexity based on the deviance information criterion."
https://openalex.org/W3080442081,"The influence of water content on mode I fracture toughness (KIc) of mudstones has been studied using semi-circular bend (SCB) specimens subject to three-point bendings. And the mudstone SCB specimens are divided into three types, including Type-A, Type-B and Type-C, corresponding to the three configurations of the bedding planes, including divider direction, arrester direction, and transverse direction, respectively. The test results show that the values of KIc for the three types of specimens are different due to the bedding structure, the Type-A specimens have the largest value of KIc for the same soak period, while the Type-C specimens possess the smallest value. As the soak period increases, the KIc of the three kinds of mudstone specimens decreases, and the fracture mechanisms of the specimens change gradually from the brittle failure form to the ductile failure form. Moreover, the standard deviation was used to quantify the anisotropy degree of the KIc of the mudstone samples. As the water content increases, the standard deviation increases from 0.057 to 0.139, which indicates a significant increase in anisotropy of the KIc of the mudstone specimens. In addition, the acoustic emission (AE) system was used to detect the AE events associated with the fracture initiation and propagation in the mudstone specimens for the different water content, with the raising water content, the cumulative AE events decrease, and the standard deviation of AE events increases, repesenting that the anisotropy of the AE events of the three types of specimens becomes more prominent. Further, the relationship between the tensile strength (σt) and the KIc of the three types of mudstone specimens for different water contents has been proved to be the linear relation."
https://openalex.org/W3082077916,"Objective Auricular stimulation (AS) is a promising method in the treatment of situational anxiety. Expressive writing (EW) is an established psychological method, which reduces test anxiety and improves exam results. The aim of this crossover trial was to compare AS with EW, and with the no intervention (NI) condition, for treatment of exam anxiety. Methods Healthy medical students underwent 3 comparable anatomy exams with an interval of one month, either performing EW, receiving AS or NI prior to the exam; the order of interventions was randomized. AS was applied using indwelling fixed needles bilaterally at the areas innervated mostly by the auricular branch of the vagal nerve on the day before the exam. Anxiety level, measured using State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory (STAI) before and after the interventions and immediately before exam, was the primary outcome. Quality of night sleep, blood pressure, heart rate and activity of salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) were analyzed across 3 conditions. Results All 37 included participants completed the study. Anxiety level (STAI) decreased immediately after AS in comparison with baseline (P = 0.02) and remained lower in comparison with that after EW and NI (P<0.01) on the day of exam. After EW and NI anxiety increased on the day of exam in comparison with baseline (P<0.01). Quality of sleep improved after AS in comparison with both control conditions (P<0.01). The activity of sAA decreased after EW and after AS (P<0.05) but not after NI condition. Conclusion Auricular stimulation, but not expressive writing, reduced exam anxiety and improved quality of sleep in medical students. These changes might be due to reduced activity of the sympathetic nervous system."

While engraftment at both sites generates laminated intestinal structures, a direct comparison between models has not yet been performed. Embryonic stem cells were differentiated into HIOs, as previously described. HIOs from the same batch were transplanted on the same day into either the RSS or mesentery. 10 weeks were allowed for engraftment and differentiation, at which time they were harvested and assessed. Metrics for comparison included: mortality, engraftment rate, gross size, number and grade of lumens, and expression of markers specific to epithelial differentiation, mesenchymal differentiation, and carbohydrate metabolism. Mortality was significantly increased when undergoing mesentery transplantation, however engraftment was significantly higher. Graft sizes were similar between groups. Morphometric parameters were similar between groups, however m-tHIOs presented with significantly fewer lumens than k-tHIO. Transcript and protein level expression of markers specific to epithelial differentiation, mesenchymal differentiation, and carbohydrate metabolism were similar between groups. Transplantation into both sites yields viable tissue of similar quality based on our assessments with enhanced engraftment and a dominant lumen for uniform study benefiting the mesenteric site and survival benefiting RSS."
https://openalex.org/W3081820537,"Body image disorders in anorexia nervosa (AN) patients and recovered AN (RAN) patients have been suggested to stem from aberrant integration of sensory information. Previous research by Case et al. (2012) used the size-weight illusion (SWI) to study multisensory integration in AN. Their results showed a diminished SWI in AN patients, which they interpreted as evidence of decreased integration of visual and proprioceptive information. However, their method did not distinguish between visual and haptic size information, which was presented concurrently while making weight judgements. Therefore, the reported effect might be attributed to integrating visual, haptic size cues, or a combination of both processes with proprioceptive input. Here, we use the SWI to investigate the integration of visual and haptic object-related sensory information in a sample of AN patients (n = 30), RAN patients (n = 29) and healthy controls (HC) (n = 29). We aimed to distinguish the contribution of visual and haptic object size by including separate visual and haptic SWI conditions. In addition to explicit measures, we included grip force measurements to assess implicit expectations about object weight. We further analysed the correlation between the SWI and a visual body size estimation (VSE) task. In contrast to Case et al. (2012), we found no evidence of differential SWI experience between groups. All participants reported a stronger visual SWI compared to haptic SWI. Grip force rate (but not peak) showed evidence of motor adaptation for the larger object in the visual condition. Furthermore, there was no correlation between the VSE and SWI, indicating no relation between perceived object weight and body size estimation. These results do not support the hypothesised impairment of visual-haptic object related integration in AN."

Adaptation of treatments should be based on explanatory models of depression and other elements within the given context.This study aimed to examine explanatory models of depression and acceptable approaches for implementation of group IPT in Northwest Ethiopia.Qualitative data were collected from April to May 2019 from case managers, adherence supporters and service users using focus group discussion and analysed thematically.PLWHA attributed depression to psychosocial problems, spiritual factors and biological factors. Depression had several impacts at individual and family level. Group-based interpersonal therapy (IPT) was acceptable if provided by trained peer counselors.The current study findings informed how to conduct feasibility and acceptability trials of group IPT in the HIV population in Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W3081086350,"The aging process affects the entire human body, including the stomatognathic system, and can trigger not only occlusal but also postural imbalances involving other muscular chains. Hippotherapy has been used to promote cervical, postural, and balance control in individuals with diverse impairments. The present study used electromyography to evaluate the masseter and temporal muscles in an elderly population pre- and post-hippotherapy. Participants included 17 individuals, mean age 66,5±7 years. Electromyographic recording of the bilateral masseter and temporal muscles was performed during the postural resting condition and activities that involved the active participation of these muscles in different conditions. The practitioner performed no other type of activity or exercise during the intervention because the objective is to evaluate the effect of the three-dimensional movement provided by the horse. Raw electromyographic data were tabulated using commercially available software (IBM® SPSS® Statistics 234.0) and subjected to statistical analysis, in which p ≤ 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Post-hippotherapy, there was lower electromyographic activity for the masseter and temporalis muscles in all the static mandibular tasks, with significant effect for time for the right temporal muscle (p = 0.038), the left temporal muscle (p = 0.028) and in the all dynamic mandibular tasks for the left temporal muscle (p = 0.025) and the left masseter muscle (p = 0.027). Hippotherapy promotes a reduction in the myoelectric activity of the masticatory muscles of elderly individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3082054702,"Efforts to promote male partner involvement in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) may inadvertently exploit gender power differentials to achieve programme targets.We explored women's relative power and perceptions of male partner involvement through interviews with postpartum Zambian women living with HIV (n = 32) using a critical discourse analysis.Women living with HIV reported far-reaching gender power imbalances, including low participation in household decision-making, economic reliance on husbands, and oppressive gendered sexual norms, which hindered their autonomy and prevented optimal mental and physical health during and after their pregnancy. When the husband was HIV-negative, sero-discordance exacerbated women's low power in these heterosexual couples. Male involvement in HIV care was both helpful and hurtful, and often walked a fine line between support for the woman and controlling behaviours over her. Inequities in the sexual divisions of power and labour and gender norms, combined with HIV stigma created challenging circumstances for women navigating the PMTCT cascade.Future programmes should consider the benefits and risks of male partner involvement within specific relationships and according to women's needs, rather than advocating for universal male involvement in PMTCT. This work highlights the persistent need for gender transformative approaches alongside PMTCT efforts."
https://openalex.org/W3082277296,"In the North China Plain, coal mining subsided lakes are surface water bodies that form after the conclusion of coal mining. In China, mining subsided lakes are often transformed into artificial wetland parks for ecological restoration. While many studies have focused on evaluating coal mining subsidence lake ecosystem service value and water pollution, little attention has been paid to changes in ecological regimes and ecological spillover effects before and after the reclamation of mining areas. This paper examines the Pan'an Lake artificial wetland in Jiawang District, Xuzhou, as a case study. Changes in the ecological regime of the mining subsidence area before and after land reclamation and corresponding spatial spillover effect on land prices are assessed based on remote sensing, GIS raster calculations and geostatistical methods. The results show that the ecosystem service value and ecological storage capacity changed significantly after the mining subsided lake was transformed into an artificial wetland and the wetland ecosystem has been developing well with significantly positive spillover effects on surrounding land prices. From 2008 to 2017, service functions of the artificial wetland ecosystem of Pan'an Lake increased by 81.95%, and the system’s ecological storage capacity increased from RMB 6,754 yuan/hm2 in 2008 to RMB 12,289 yuan/hm2 in 2017. The average impact of the Pan'an Lake artificial wetland on the spillover effects of surrounding residential land prices was measured at RMB 195.18 yuan/m2, and the total spillover value of planned residential land in the study area was measured at RMB 805,422,100 yuan. The present study can serve as a useful guide for evaluating the economic feasibility of land reclamation planning and ecological restoration in mining subsidence areas."
https://openalex.org/W3082279256,"Introduction Exercise modalities offered as part of traditional pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) do not always translate to successful performance of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and may hinder gains in patient’s sense of well-being. Data is lacking on the efficacy of incorporation of ADL-focused training in PR. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of incorporation of ADL simulation and energy-conservation training in PR as part of a quality-initiative on health-related-quality-of-life (HRQOL), dyspnea, fatigue, and six-minute-walk-test among PR patients. Methods Retrospective study where medical records of consecutive patients with chronic respiratory diseases who completed PR from 2016 to 2018 were reviewed. ADL-focused energy-conservation training was added to traditional PR in September 2017 by replacing three monthly sessions of traditional PR with energy-conservation training as a quality-improvement-initiative. The change from baseline on HRQOL measured by COPD assessment test (CAT), six-minute-walk-test, MMRC dyspnea score and CRQ-dyspnea and CRQ-fatigue questionnaires, were compared between patients who received traditional PR versus energy-conservation PR. Within and between group differences were calculated via repeated-measures ANOVA. Results The baseline characteristics of 91 patients who participated in traditional PR versus energy-conservation PR (n = 85) were similar (mean age = 68.6±10.4 years, 49% men). While improvement from baseline was similar and significant for both groups for MMRC, CRQ-dyspnea and CRQ-fatigue scores, and six-minute walk test, patients who participated in energy-conservation PR had significantly higher improvement in HRQOL CAT scores (p = 0.01) than those who completed traditional PR. Conclusion Tailoring patient’s training programs to include energy-conservation training exercises specific to ADL in PR improved HRQOL over traditional PR in patients with chronic respiratory diseases despite no significant change in functional status. Future randomized-controlled trials will be needed to confirm these initial findings."
https://openalex.org/W3082592396,"Contextual and individual risk factors of veterinarians' professional quality of life are being debated. Research suggests that attachment styles are relevant predictors of professional quality of life; however, their role in work-related well-being of veterinarians is yet to be ascertained. In the present study, self-report measures on exposure to animal suffering, adult attachment styles, and professional quality of life were administered to 1,445 Italian veterinarians (70% females) aged 24 to 74 years old; sociodemographic information and information on workload were also collected. Female gender, higher levels of ordinary workload, on-call hours per week, exposure to animal suffering, together with fearful and preoccupied attachment styles were significantly associated with lower levels of veterinarians' quality of life. This suggests that work-related factors may combine with individual psychological features in promoting or disadvantaging the professional quality of life of veterinarians. Implications of these findings for promoting veterinarians' quality of life and directions for future research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3080441255,"Functional and enduring mammary structure is pivotal for producer profitability, and animal health and welfare in beef production. Genetic evaluations for teat and udder score in Canadian Angus cattle have previously been developed. The aim of this study was to identify genomic regions associated with teat and udder structure in Canadian Angus cows thereby enhancing knowledge of the biological architecture of these traits. Thus, we performed a weighted single-step genome wide association study (WssGWAS) to identify candidate genes for teat and udder score in 1,582 Canadian Angus cows typed with the GeneSeek® Genomic Profiler Bovine 130K SNP array. Genomically enhanced estimated breeding values (GEBVs) were converted to SNP marker effects using unequal variances for markers to calculate weights for each SNP over three iterations. At the genome wide level, we detected windows of 20 consecutive SNPs that explained more than 0.5% of the variance observed in these traits. A total of 35 and 28 windows were identified for teat and udder score, respectively, with two SNP windows in common for both traits. Using Ensembl, the SNP windows were used to search for candidate genes and quantitative trait loci (QTL). A total of 94 and 71 characterized genes were identified in the regions for teat and udder score, respectively. Of these, 7 genes were common for both traits. Gene network and enrichment analysis, using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), signified key pathways unique to each trait. Genes of interest were associated with immune response and wound healing, adipose tissue development and morphology, and epithelial and vascular development and morphology. Genetic architecture from this GWAS confirms that teat and udder score are distinct, polygenic traits involving varying and complex biological pathways, and that genetic selection for improved teat and udder score is possible."
https://openalex.org/W3082913887,"Water deficit is one of the major limitations to food production worldwide and most climate change scenarios predict an aggravation of the situation. To face the expected increase in drought stress in the coming years, breeders are working to elucidate the genetic control of barley growth and productivity traits under water deficit. Barley is known as a relatively drought tolerant crop and genetic variability was observed for drought tolerance traits. The objectives of the present study were the quantification of morphological and physiological responses in a collection of 209 spring barley genotypes to drought stress, and the genetic analysis by genome-wide association study to find quantitative trait loci (QTL) and the allele contributions for each of the investigated traits. In six pot experiments, 209 spring barley genotypes were grown under a well-watered and water-limited regime. Stress phases were initiated individually for each genotype at the beginning of tillering and spiking for the vegetative- and the generative stage experiments, respectively, and terminated when the transpiration rates of stress treatments reached 10% of the well-watered control. After the stress phase, a total of 42 productivity related traits such as the dry matter of plant organs, tiller number, leaf length, leaf area, amount of water soluble carbohydrates in the stems, proline content in leaves and osmotic adjustment of corresponding well-watered and stressed plants were analysed, and QTL analyses were performed to find marker-trait associations. Significant water deficit effects were observed for almost all traits and significant genotype x treatment interactions (GxT) were observed for 37 phenotypic traits. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed 77 significant loci associated with 16 phenotypic traits during the vegetative stage experiment and a total of 85 significant loci associated with 13 phenotypic traits during the generative stage experiment for traits such as leaf area, number of green leaves, grain yield, harvest index and stem length. For traits with significant GxT interactions, genotypic differences for relative values were analysed using one way ANOVA. More than 110 loci for GxT interaction were found for 17 phenotypic traits explaining in many cases more than 50% of the genetic variance."
https://openalex.org/W3082932727,"Damage to grasses and cereals by phloem-feeding herbivores is manifest as nutrient and chlorophyll loss, desiccation, and a gradual decline in host vigour. Chlorophyll loss in particular leads to a succession of colour changes before eventual host death. Depending on the attacking herbivore species, colour changes can be difficult to detect with the human eye. This study used digital images to examine colour changes of rice seedlings during feeding by the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) and whitebacked planthopper, Sogatella furcifera (Horváth). Values for red (580 nm), green (540 nm) and blue (550 nm) reflectance for 39 rice varieties during seedling seed-box tests were derived from images captured with a digital camera. Red and blue reflectance gradually increased as herbivore damage progressed until final plant death. Red reflectance was greater from plants attacked by the brown planthopper than plants attacked by the whitebacked planthopper, which had proportionately more green and blue reflectance, indicating distinct impacts by the two planthoppers on their hosts. Analysis of digital images was used to discriminate variety responses to the two planthoppers. Ordination methods based on red-green-blue reflectance and vegetation indices such as the Green Leaf Index (GLI) that included blue reflectance were more successful than two-colour indices or indices based on hue, saturation and brightness in discriminating between damage responses among varieties. We make recommendations to advance seed-box screening methods for cereal resistance to phloem feeders and demonstrate how images from digital cameras can be used to improve the quality of data captured during high-throughput phenotyping."
https://openalex.org/W3080584979,"This paper proposes an alternative approach to extract transformer’s winding parameters of resistance (R), inductance (L), capacitance (C) and conductance (G) based on Finite Element Method (FEM). The capacitance and conductance were computed based on Fast Multiple Method (FMM) and Method of Moment (MoM) through quasi-electrostatics approach. The AC resistances and inductances were computed based on MoM through quasi-magnetostatics approach. Maxwell's equations were used to compute the DC resistances and inductances. Based on the FEM computed parameters, the frequency response of the winding was obtained through the Bode plot function. The simulated frequency response by FEM model was compared with the simulated frequency response based on the Multi-conductor Transmission Line (MTL) model and the measured frequency response of a 33/11 kV, 30 MVA transformer. The statistical indices such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Absolute Sum of Logarithmic Error (ASLE) were used to analyze the performance of the proposed FEM model. It is found that the simulated frequency response by FEM model is quite close to measured frequency response at low and mid frequency regions as compared to simulated frequency response by MTL model based on RMSE and ASLE analysis."

We present the first comprehensive geographic mobility study of Scandinavia’s earliest emporium, Ribe, which emerged around AD 700 in the North Sea region of Denmark. This article presents the results of strontium isotope analyses of 21 individuals buried at Ribe, combined with an in-depth study of the varied cultural affinities reflected by the burial practices. In order to investigate geographic mobility in early life/childhood, we sampled multiple teeth and/or petrous bone of individuals, which yielded a total of 43 strontium isotope analyses. Most individuals yielded strontium isotope values that fell within a relatively narrow range, between 87Sr/86Sr = 0.709 to 0.711. Only two individuals yielded values >87Sr/86Sr = 0.711. This suggests that most of these individuals had local origins but some had cultural affinities beyond present-day Denmark. Our results raise new questions concerning our understanding of the social and cultural dynamics behind the urbanization of Scandinavia."
https://openalex.org/W3081618079,"Every nation prioritizes the inclusive economic growth and development of all regions. However, we observe that economic activities are clustered in space, which results in a disparity in per-capita income among different regions. A complexity-based method was proposed by Hidalgo and Hausmann [PNAS 106, 10570-10575 (2009)] to explain the large gaps in per-capita income across countries. Although there have been extensive studies on countries' economic complexity using international export data, studies on economic complexity at the regional level are relatively less studied. Here, we study the industrial sector complexity of prefectures in Japan based on the basic information of more than one million firms. We aggregate the data as a bipartite network of prefectures and industrial sectors. We decompose the bipartite network as a prefecture-prefecture network and sector-sector network, which reveals the relationships among them. Similarities among the prefectures and among the sectors are measured using a metric. From these similarity matrices, we cluster the prefectures and sectors using the minimal spanning tree technique.The computed economic complexity index from the structure of the bipartite network shows a high correlation with macroeconomic indicators, such as per-capita gross prefectural product and prefectural income per person. We argue that this index reflects the present economic performance and hidden potential of the prefectures for future growth."
https://openalex.org/W3081653271,"Purpose Discrepancies between subjective and objective measures of total sleep time (TST) are frequent among insomnia patients, but this issue remains scarcely investigated in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We aimed to evaluate if sleep perception is affected by the severity of OSA. Methods We performed a 3-month cross-sectional study of Brazilian adults undergoing overnight polysomnography (PSG). TST was objectively assessed from PSG and by a self-reported questionnaire (subjective measurement). Sleep perception index (SPI) was defined by the ratio of subjective and objective values. Diagnosis of OSA was based on an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 5.0/h, being its severity classified according to AHI thresholds: 5.0–14.9/h (mild OSA), 15.0–29.9/h (moderate OSA), and ≥ 30.0/h (severe OSA). Results Overall, 727 patients were included (58.0% males). A significant difference was found in SPI between non-OSA and OSA groups (p = 0.014). Mean SPI values significantly decreased as the OSA severity increased: without OSA (100.1 ± 40.9%), mild OSA (95.1 ± 24.6%), moderate OSA (93.5 ± 25.2%), and severe OSA (90.6 ± 28.2%), p = 0.036. Using logistic regression, increasing SPI was associated with a reduction in the likelihood of presenting any OSA (p = 0.018), moderate/severe OSA (p = 0.019), and severe OSA (p = 0.028). However, insomnia was not considered as an independent variable for the presence of any OSA, moderate/severe OSA, and severe OSA (all p-values > 0.05). Conclusion In a clinical referral cohort, SPI significantly decreases with increasing OSA severity, but is not modified by the presence of insomnia symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3082180406,"In this study we attempted to assess whether seasonal upwelling or a steady thermocline persisted at the western margin of the Tethys Ocean during the late Turonian–early Coniacian interval. For this scope, we employed novel and published stable oxygen isotope (δ18O) data of various organisms (bivalves, bivalves, brachiopods, fish and belemnites). New seasonally resolved temperature estimates were based on the δ18O record of sequentially sampled inoceramid (Inoceramus sp.) and rudist (Hippurites resectus) shells from the Scaglia Rossa and Gosau deposits of northern Italy and western Austria, respectively. Diagenetic screening was performed using reflected light, cathodoluminescence (CL), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and stable isotope analysis. Originally preserved δ13C and δ18O values were used to characterize the lifestyle of the bivalves and detect vital effects that could have biased oxygen isotope-based temperature reconstructions. Inoceramid δ18O values provide–for the first time–information on temperatures of Tethyan benthic waters, which were, on average, 14.4 ± 0.6 °C and fluctuated seasonally within a range of less than 2 °C. Such a thermal regime is in line with the temperatures postulated for late Turonian boreal water masses and support the existence of a cold water supply from the North Atlantic to the Tethyan bottom. Bottom cooling, however, did not affect the shallow water environment. In fact, the rudist-based temperature estimates for shallow water environment revealed a mean annual range of 11 °C, between 24 and 35 °C (assuming a seasonally constant δ18Ow = 1.0 ‰), which are among the warmest temperatures recorded over the entire Late Cretaceous. Our findings, thus, suggest a strong thermal and food web decoupling between the two environments. The absence of a seasonal vertical homogenization of different water bodies suggests the existence of a steady thermocline and, therefore, contrasts with the presence of an active coastal upwelling in the region as hypothesized by previous authors."
https://openalex.org/W3082899691,"Spatiotemporal dynamics of EEG/MEG (electro-/magneto-encephalogram) have typically been investigated by applying time-frequency decomposition and examining amplitude-amplitude, phase-phase, or phase-amplitude associations between combinations of frequency bands and scalp sites, primarily to identify neural correlates of behaviors and traits. Instead, we directly extracted global EEG spatiotemporal dynamics as trajectories of k-dimensional state vectors (k = the number of estimated current sources) to investigate potential global rules governing neural dynamics. We chose timescale-dependent measures of trajectory instability (approximately the 2nd temporal derivative) and speed (approximately the 1st temporal derivative) as state variables, that succinctly characterized trajectory forms. We compared trajectories across posterior, central, anterior, and lateral scalp regions as the current sources under those regions may serve distinct functions. We recorded EEG while participants rested with their eyes closed (likely engaged in spontaneous thoughts) to investigate intrinsic neural dynamics. Some potential global rules emerged. Time-averaged trajectory instability from all five regions tightly converged (with their variability minimized) at the level of generating nearly unconstrained but slightly conservative turns (~100° on average) on the timescale of ~25 ms, suggesting that spectral-amplitude profiles are globally adjusted to maintain this convergence. Further, within-frequency and cross-frequency phase relations appear to be independently coordinated to reduce average trajectory speed and increase the variability in trajectory speed and instability in a relatively timescale-invariant manner, and to make trajectories less oscillatory. Future research may investigate the functional relevance of these intrinsic global-dynamics rules by examining how they adjust to various sensory environments and task demands or remain invariant. The current results also provide macroscopic constraints for quantitative modeling of neural dynamics as the timescale dependencies of trajectory instability and speed are relatable to oscillatory dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W3080524729,"In this study, we examined the effect of differing gap lengths on regeneration of transected recurrent laryngeal nerves using silicon tubes containing type I collagen gel and the ability of this regeneration to result in restoration of vocal fold movements in rats. We simulated nerve gaps in Sprague-Dawley rats by transecting the left recurrent laryngeal nerves and bridged the nerve stumps using silicon tubes containing type 1 collagen gel. Three experimental groups, in which the gap lengths between the stumps were 1, 3, or 5 mm, were compared with a control group in which the nerve was transected but was not bridged. After surgery, we observed vocal fold movements over time with a laryngoscope. At week 15, we assessed the extent of nerve regeneration in the tube, histologically and electrophysiologically. We also assessed the degree of atrophy of the thyroarytenoid muscle (T/U ratio). Restoration of vocal fold movements was observed in 9 rats in the 1-mm group, in 6 rats in the 3-mm group, and in 3 rats in the 5-mm group. However, in most rats, restoration was temporary, with only one rat demonstrating continued vocal fold movements at week 15. In electromyograph, evoked potentials were observed in rats in the 1-mm and 3-mm groups. Regenerated tissue in the tube was thickest in the 1-mm group, followed by the 3-mm and 5-mm groups. The regenerated tissue showed the presence of myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers. In assessment of thyroarytenoid muscle atrophy, the T/U ratio was highest in the 1-mm group, followed by the 3-mm and 5-mm groups. We successfully regenerated the nerves and produced a rat model of recurrent laryngeal nerve regeneration that demonstrated temporary recovery of vocal fold movements. This rat model could be useful for assessing novel treatments developing in the future."

Methods After obtaining approval from our institutional research ethics committee and appropriate informed consent, we performed 34 examinations in 32 pediatric patients. The examinations were anonymized and analyzed by two radiologists with at least 10 years’ experience. Results The sensitivity and specificity findings, respectively, were as follows: 100% and 100% for primary tumor; 100% and 86% for bone metastasis; 33% and 100% for lung metastasis; 85% and 100% for lymph node metastasis; and 100% and 62% for global investigation of primary or secondary neoplasias. We observed excellent interobserver agreement for WBMRI and excellent agreement with standard staging examination results. Conclusions Our results suggest that pediatric patients can be safely imaged with WBMRI, although not as the only tool but in association with low-dose chest CT (for subcentimeter pulmonary nodules). However, additional exams with ionizing radiation may be necessary for patients who tested positive to correctly quantify and locate the lesions."
https://openalex.org/W3081220227,"Introduction Preterm birth is defined as all births before 37 completed weeks of gestation. Globally, the prevalence rate of preterm birth ranges from 47.5 to 137 per 1000 live births. In Ethiopia, the prevalence of preterm birth is 10.1%. Several anthropometric parameters, particularly, head circumference and foot length(FL) have been used as a proxy measure for gestational age(GA). Objective To assess the use of newborn foot length as a screening tool to identify preterm newborns and correlation factors at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital (UOG CSH), Northwest Ethiopia. Methods Institutional based cross-sectional study design was conducted on 205 newborns admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit, UOG CSH. Systematic sampling technique was employed. Optimal cutoff newborn foot length and area under the curve (AUC) was calculated by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to assess the power of foot length measurement to diagnosis prematurity. Results The mean foot length was 7.41±0.67 cm with a range of 5.4–8.6 cm. Gestational age had a significant strong positive correlation with foot length(r = 0.865). The regression equation derived was GA = 4.5*FL + 3.61. Foot length had strong power (AUC = 0.99) to differentiate preterm from term newborns. A threshold newborn foot length of ≤7.35 cm had a sensitivity and specificity of 98.5% and 96.3%, respectively to predict prematurity. Conclusion Foot length had a high sensitivity and specificity in identifying preterm newborns, making it a reliable tool to identify preterm birth in a rural setting."

The current prevalence of myopia among disadvantaged school children in Australia has not been reported. Therefore, this study analyses refractive data for children from rural and outer suburban areas. Methods The records of 4,365 children aged 6–15 visiting a city-based government-school respite care center during the years 2014/2016/2018 were analyzed for right eye non-cycloplegic spherical equivalent refraction (SER). The prevalence of myopia (SER≤-0.50D) was compared with historical data. Results The prevalence of myopia was 3.5%, 4.4% and 4.3% in 2014, 2016 and 2018, respectively. The prevalence of myopia increased with age (P<0.0001), but was not related to sex or year of testing (all P >0.05). The overall mean SER was 0.89±0.86D, 0.62±0.89D and 0.56±0.95 in 2014, 2016 and 2018, respectively. Mean SER was associated with year of testing, age (all P <0.0001) and sex (P = 0.03). Mean SER decreased slightly from 2014 to 2018 and demonstrated a significant shift towards less hyperopia with increasing age. Mean SER of females was higher than that of males and decreased faster than in males with age (P interaction = 0.03). Conclusions Myopia prevalence increased with age. The mean SER decreased slightly from 2014 to 2018. Sex differences in the rate of change with age was observed. Compared with 40 years ago, the prevalence of myopia has doubled, but it remains significantly lower than in school children of a similar age living in established urban areas that are regarded as having a higher socioeconomic status."
https://openalex.org/W3080365806,"The benefits of involving patients as partners in research across diverse medical and psychiatric settings are well established in the literature. However, researchers continue to struggle to access, engage and retain participants from hard-to-reach populations. The main objective of this study was to co-create pet therapy activities with patients admitted for serious and complex mental illness to a large urban mental health and addiction hospital. Informed by the principles of participatory action research methodology, we conducted focus group discussions with 38 inpatients in seven different clinical units. An experienced volunteer handler and a certified therapy dog helped facilitate our discussions. Participating researchers, recreational therapists, volunteer handlers and our participants all reported that the presence of a certified therapy dog at each of our discussions was integral to their success. Certified therapy dogs increased the motivation to participate in our study, helped to build rapport with participants and created connections in our discussions that enriched our data. To our knowledge our study is the first to demonstrate the value of using a therapy dog as a participatory research tool in a healthcare setting. The authors believe that therapy dogs are a low-tech intervention that could be used effectively to engage hard-to-reach populations in research about their treatment and care in a diverse range of medical settings. These findings support the creation of a pilot study to test the value of including therapy dogs in patient-centered research with vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations."
https://openalex.org/W3081425326,"Essential for successful interaction with the environment is the human capacity to resolve events in time. Typical event timing paradigms are judgements of simultaneity (SJ) and of temporal order (TOJ). It remains unclear whether SJ and TOJ are based on the same underlying mechanism and whether there are fixed thresholds for resolution. The current study employed four visual event timing task versions: horizontal and vertical SJ and TOJ. Binary responses were analysed using multilevel binary regression modelling. Modulatory effects of potential explanatory variables on event timing perception were investigated: (1) Individual factors (sex and age), (2) temporal factors (SOA, trial number, order of experiment, order of stimuli orientation, time of day) and (3) spatial factors (left or right stimulus first, top or bottom stimulus first, horizontal vs. vertical orientation). The current study directly compares for the first time, performance on SJ and TOJ tasks using the same paradigm and presents evidence that a variety of factors and their interactions selectively modulate event timing functions in humans, explaining the variance found in previous studies. We conclude that SJ and TOJ are partially independent functions, because they are modulated differently by individual and contextual variables."

We apply SSMD to Spain, based on affiliation to the Social Security system prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and conclude that 98.37% of the population could be affected. The proposed system makes it possible to accurately identify the target population for serological IgG antibody tests in the work field, as well as those affected by special income replacement measures due to lockdown being maintained over a longer period."

Therefore, we aimed to assess the incidence and risk factors for these illnesses and measure the utilization of healthcare services. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 784 postpartum women and their 772 neonates in three randomly selected kebeles in rural southern Ethiopia. Eight home follow-up visits were conducted during the first 42 postpartum days, and six neonate follow-ups were conducted at the same home over the first 28 days of life. The Prentice, Williams, and Peterson’s total time Cox-type survival model was used for analysis. We recorded 31 episodes of postpartum illness per 100 women-weeks (95% confidence interval [CI]: 30%, 32%) and 48 episodes of neonatal illness per 100 neonate-weeks (95% CI: 46%, 50%). Anemia occurred in 19% of women (95% CI: 17%, 22%) and low birth weight (<2,500g) in 15% of neonates (95% CI: 13%, 18%). However, only 5% of postpartum women (95% CI: 4%, 7%) and 4% of neonate (95% CI: 3%, 5%) reported utilizing healthcare services. Walking over 60 minutes to access healthcare was a factor of both postpartum illnesses (AHR = 2.61; 95% CI: 1.98, 3.43) and neonatal illnesses (AHR = 2.66; 95% CI: 2.12, 3.35)). Birth weight ≥2500g was identified factor of neonatal illnesses (AHR = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.33, 0.46). Compared with younger mothers, older mothers with sick newborns (AHR = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.50) or postpartum illnesses (AHR = 1.40; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.89) were more likely to seek healthcare. Reasons for not utilizing healthcare services included a belief that the illnesses were not serious or would resolve on their own, little confidence in the healthcare institutions, and the inability to afford the cost. The burden of postpartum and neonatal illnesses in rural communities of southern Ethiopia remains high. Unfortunately, few participants utilized healthcare services. We recommend strengthening the health system that enables identifying, managing, treating, and referring maternal and neonatal illnesses and provide reasonable healthcare at the community level."
https://openalex.org/W3080640318,"Acidovorax citrulli, a seedborne bacterium and quarantine pest, causes the devastating bacterial fruit blotch disease in cucurbit plants. Immunological assays such as ELISA are widely used in routine field inspections for this bacterium. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the currently available monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) can detect all common A. citrulli strains. We therefore aimed to produce a panel of MAbs and to develop an ELISA-based method capable of detecting all A. citrulli strains. We used a high-throughput bead array technique to screen and characterize A. citrulli-specific MAbs produced from hybridoma clones. The hybridoma library was simultaneously screened against five A. citrulli strains (PSA, KK9, SQA, SQB and P) and the closely related bacterium, Delftia acidovorans. Three MAbs exhibiting different binding patterns to A. citrulli were used to develop an ELISA-based method called “double antibody pairs sandwich ELISA” (DAPS-ELISA). DAPS-ELISA employing mixtures of MAbs was able to specifically detect all 16 A. citrulli strains tested without cross-reactivity with other bacteria. By contrast, our previously developed MAb capture-sandwich ELISA (MC-sELISA) and a commercial test kit detected only 15 and 14 of 16 strains, respectively. The sensitivity of the DAPS-ELISA ranged from 5×105 to 1×106 CFU/mL, while those of the MC-sELISA and the commercial test kit ranged from 5×104 to 1×107 CFU/mL and 5×104 to 5×105 CFU/mL, respectively. DAPS-ELISA thus represents an alternative method enabling rapid, accurate, and inexpensive detection of all A. citrulli strains. The method can be applied to seed testing prior to planting as well as to routine field inspections."

Identifying the movement intention of the wearer to control the gait planning of the exoskeleton robot can effectively improve the man-machine interaction experience after the exoskeleton. This paper uses a support vector machine (SVM) to realize wearer's motion posture recognition by collecting sEMG signals on the human surface. The moving gait of the exoskeleton is planned according to the recognition results, and the decoding intention signal controls gait switching. Meanwhile, the stability of the planned gait during the movement was analyzed. Experimental results show that the sEMG signal decoding human motion intentional, and control exoskeleton robot gait switching has good accuracy and real-time performance. It helps patients to complete rehabilitation training more safely and quickly."
https://openalex.org/W3081541215,"Being delivered as a low birthweight (LBW) infant is a risk factor for elevated blood pressure and future problems with cardiovascular and cerebellar diseases. Although premature babies are reported to have low numbers of nephrons, some unclear questions remain about the mechanisms underlying elevated blood pressure in full-term LBW infants. We previously reported that glucocorticoids increased miR-449a expression, and increased miR-449a expression suppressed Crhr1 expression and caused negative glucocorticoid feedback. Therefore, we conducted this study to clarify the involvement of pituitary miR-449a in the increase in blood pressure caused by higher glucocorticoids in LBW rats. We generated a fetal low-carbohydrate and calorie-restricted model rat (60% of standard chow), and some individuals showed postnatal growth failure caused by growth hormone receptor expression. Using this model, we examined how a high-fat diet (lard-based 45kcal% fat)-induced mismatch between prenatal and postnatal environments could elevate blood pressure after growth. Although LBW rats fed standard chow had slightly higher blood pressure than control rats, their blood pressure was significantly higher than controls when exposed to a high-fat diet. Observation of glomeruli subjected to periodic acid methenamine silver (PAM) staining showed no difference in number or size. Aortic and cardiac angiotensin II receptor expression was altered with compensatory responses. Blood aldosterone levels were not different between control and LBW rats, but blood corticosterone levels were significantly higher in the latter with high-fat diet exposure. Administration of metyrapone, a steroid synthesis inhibitor, reduced blood pressure to levels comparable to controls. We showed that high-fat diet exposure causes impairment of the pituitary glucocorticoid negative feedback via miR-449a. These results clarify that LBW rats have increased blood pressure due to high glucocorticoid levels when they are exposed to a high-fat diet. These findings suggest a new therapeutic target for hypertension of LBW individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3048970424,"Drug-induced long QT syndrome (diLQTS), characterized by a prolongation of the QT-interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG), is a serious adverse drug reaction that can cause the life-threatening arrhythmia Torsade de Points (TdP). Self-monitoring for diLQTS could therefore save lives, but detecting it on the ECG is difficult, particularly at high and low heart rates. In this paper, we evaluate whether using a pseudo-colouring visualisation technique and changing the coordinate system (Cartesian vs. Polar) can support lay people in identifying QT-prolongation at varying heart rates. Four visualisation techniques were evaluated using a counterbalanced repeated measures design including Cartesian no-colouring, Cartesian pseudo-colouring, Polar no-colouring and Polar pseudo-colouring. We used a multi-reader, multi-case (MRMC) receiver operating characteristic (ROC) study design within a psychophysical paradigm, along with eye-tracking technology. Forty-three lay participants read forty ECGs (TdP risk n = 20, no risk n = 20), classifying each QT-interval as normal/abnormal, and rating their confidence on a 6-point scale. The results show that introducing pseudo-colouring to the ECG significantly increased accurate detection of QT-interval prolongation regardless of heart rate, T-wave morphology and coordinate system. Pseudo-colour also helped to reduce reaction times and increased satisfaction when reading the ECGs. Eye movement analysis indicated that pseudo-colour helped to focus visual attention on the areas of the ECG crucial to detecting QT-prolongation. The study indicates that pseudo-colouring enables lay people to visually identify drug-induced QT-prolongation regardless of heart rate, with implications for the more rapid identification and management of diLQTS."
https://openalex.org/W3081155444,"To reduce the incidence of safety accidents during the construction of all-steel-type attached lifting scaffolds and address the research gaps in related fields, in this study a theoretical model of trajectory crossing accidents was coupled with an analysis of similar safety accidents to determine the causes of accidents in the construction of high-rise buildings using steel-type attached lifting scaffolds. To do so, a safety evaluation index system covering all steel-type attached lifting scaffolds that comprises five first-level indicators and 17 second-level indicators was established. The first-level indicators cover three risk dimensions: unsafe human behavior (personal operations), unsafe conditions (material performance, structural calculation, components and connections), and lack of management (safety management). A combined multi-agent-based modeling (MABM) method and structural entropy weight were used to calculate a comprehensive weight for better alignment of the weight calculation results with objective laws. A safety assessment model for an all-steel-type attached lifting scaffolding was constructed using grey relative Euclidean weighted correlation theory to enable the calculation of a grey-to-Euclidean weighted correlation degree that directly correlates with the degree of security. Using the established assessment model, four projects were subjected to a safety evaluation, with the results validating the model by revealing that its output was consistent with the actual security situation."
https://openalex.org/W3082562306,"Background/Aim To our knowledge, no case–control study has investigated the relationships between stealing, clinical implications, and psychiatric diagnosis among child and adolescent psychiatric patients with or without a history of stealing. Thus, the associations between child and adolescent psychiatric disorders and a history of stealing remain unclear. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationships between stealing, clinical implications, and psychiatric diagnosis among child and adolescent psychiatric patients with or without a history of stealing. Methods In this retrospective case–control study, the proportions of clinical implications among child and adolescent psychiatric patients with and without a history of stealing were compared. Data regarding age, sex, primary diagnosis, junior high school student or not, both father and mother are the caregivers or not, family history, abuse history, school refusal, depressive state, and obsessive–compulsive symptoms were retrieved from medical records. Participants consisted of Japanese junior high school students and younger patients (maximum age, 15 years) at the first consultation. All patients were examined and diagnosed by psychiatrists according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, or the Fifth Edition. Stealing was reported by the patients or caregivers to the psychiatrist, or the psychiatrist had inquired about a history of stealing at the first consultation. Results Among 1972 patients who consulted the clinic, at the first consultation, 56 (2.84%) had a history of stealing (cases), and 1916 (97.16%) did not (controls). Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that the proportions of males, junior high school students, abuse history, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and conduct disorder were significantly higher, and the proportions of adjustment disorders and school refusal were significantly lower in cases than in controls. The multivariate adjusted odds ratio increased further when the two factors were considered together, such as ASD with abuse history and attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with abuse history. Conclusions Children with a history of stealing were more likely to be diagnosed with ASD or ADHD with abuse history. Child and adolescent psychiatric outpatients with a history of stealing were more likely to be older and male. Our study should be understood without prejudice because this study is reporting associations, not causality. Therefore, a prospective study to investigate causality among ADHD, ASD, abuse history, and stealing is needed. If ADHD and ASD with abuse history can be correlated to a history of stealing, interventions can be more effective by understanding the mechanisms underlying these connections."
https://openalex.org/W3082623707,"Somatic structural variants are an important contributor to cancer development and evolution. Accurate detection of these complex variants from whole genome sequencing data is influenced by a multitude of parameters. However, there are currently no tools for guiding study design nor are there applications that could predict the performance of somatic structural variant detection. To address this gap, we developed Shiny-SoSV, a user-friendly web-based calculator for determining the impact of common variables on the sensitivity, precision and F1 score of somatic structural variant detection, including choice of variant detection tool, sequencing depth of coverage, variant allele fraction, and variant breakpoint resolution. Using simulation studies, we determined singular and combinatoric effects of these variables, modelled the results using a generalised additive model, allowing structural variant detection performance to be predicted for any combination of predictors. Shiny-SoSV provides an interactive and visual platform for users to easily compare individual and combined impact of different parameters. It predicts the performance of a proposed study design, on somatic structural variant detection, prior to the commencement of benchwork. Shiny-SoSV is freely available at https://hcpcg.shinyapps.io/Shiny-SoSV with accompanying user’s guide and example use-cases."
