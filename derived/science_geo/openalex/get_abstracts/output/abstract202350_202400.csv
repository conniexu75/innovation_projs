https://openalex.org/W2006113261,"Aurora family kinases contribute to regulation of mitosis. Using RNA interference in synchronized HeLa cells, we now show that Aurora-A is required for mitotic entry. We found that initial activation of Aurora-A in late G2 phase of the cell cycle is essential for recruitment of the cyclin B1-Cdk1 complex to centrosomes, where it becomes activated and commits cells to mitosis. A two-hybrid screen identified the LIM protein Ajuba as an Aurora-A binding protein. Ajuba and Aurora-A interact in mitotic cells and become phosphorylated as they do so. In vitro analyses revealed that Ajuba induces the autophosphorylation and consequent activation of Aurora-A. Depletion of Ajuba prevented activation of Aurora-A at centrosomes in late G2 phase and inhibited mitotic entry. Overall, our data suggest that Ajuba is an essential activator of Aurora-A in mitotic commitment."
https://openalex.org/W2127113850,"Presenilin1 (PS1), a protein implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), forms complexes with N-cadherin, a transmembrane protein with important neuronal and synaptic functions. Here, we show that a PS1-dependent gamma-secretase protease activity promotes an epsilon-like cleavage of N-cadherin to produce its intracellular domain peptide, N-Cad/CTF2. NMDA receptor agonists stimulate N-Cad/CTF2 production suggesting that this receptor regulates the epsilon-cleavage of N-cadherin. N-Cad/CTF2 binds the transcription factor CBP and promotes its proteasomal degradation, inhibiting CRE-dependent transactivation. Thus, the PS1-dependent epsilon-cleavage product N-Cad/CTF2 functions as a potent repressor of CBP/CREB-mediated transcription. Importantly, PS1 mutations associated with familial AD (FAD) and a gamma-secretase dominant-negative mutation inhibit N-Cad/CTF2 production and upregulate CREB-mediated transcription indicating that FAD mutations cause a gain of transcriptional function by inhibiting production of transcriptional repressor N-Cad/CTF2. These data raise the possibility that FAD mutation-induced transcriptional abnormalities maybe causally related to the dementia associated with FAD."

In control mice of the same subline, the incidence of spontaneous lymphoma is about 1 percent. No leukemogenic activity could be detected in filtrates from thymi harvested at 2 to 32 days following completion of x-ray treatment. Activity was evident at 64 days and was perhaps somewhat greater at 128 days. Serial cell-free passage of filtrates in newborn F(1) hybrid mice resulted in a marked increase in lymphoma incidence (69 percent), coupled with a shortening of the median latency. Supplementary x-irradiation failed to enhance the activity of filtrates after neonatal injection."

Extracts of Fundulus interrenal tissue, carp corpuscles of Stannius, and hog renin were ineffective. Injection of whole rat-pituitary brei was partially successful. Highly purified prolactin maintained survival, although the recipients did not eat normally. A synergic action of prolactin with some unidentified pituitary hormone is suspected."
https://openalex.org/W2056357374,"Current biochemical characterizations of cystic fibrosis (CF) sputum do not address the high degree of microheterogeneity in the rheological properties of the mucosal matrix and only provide bulk-average particle diffusion coefficients. The viscoelasticity of CF sputum greatly reduces the diffusion rates of colloidal particles, limiting the effectiveness of gene delivery to underlying lung cells. We determine diffusion coefficients of hundreds of individual amine-modified and carboxylated polystyrene particles (diameter 100–500 nm) embedded in human CF sputum with 5 nm and 33 ms of spatiotemporal resolution. High resolution multiple particle tracking is used to calculate the effective viscoelastic properties of CF sputum at the micron scale, which we relate to its macroscopic viscoelasticity. CF sputum microviscosity, as probed by 100- and 200-nm particles, is an order of magnitude lower than its macroviscosity, suggesting that nanoparticles dispersed in CF sputum are transported primarily through lower viscosity pores within a highly elastic matrix. Multiple particle tracking provides a non-destructive, highly sensitive method to quantify the high heterogeneity of the mucus pore network. The mean diffusion coefficient becomes dominated by relatively few but fast-moving particles as particle size is reduced from 500 to 100 nm. Neutrally charged particles with a diameter <200 nm undergo more rapid transport in CF sputum than charged particles. Treatment with recombinant human DNase (Pulmozyme®) reduces macroviscoelastic properties of CF sputum by up to 50% and dramatically narrows the distribution of individual particle diffusion rates but surprisingly does not significantly alter the ensemble-average particle diffusion rate.

Transport of viral particles, bacteria, and gene delivery vehicles to the lung epithelial cells is greatly limited by the respiratory sputum that sits on the apical surface of the cells (1.Hanes J. Dawson M. Har-el Y. Suh J. Fiegel J. Hickey A.J. Pharmaceutical Inhalation Aerosol Technology. 2nd Ed. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York2003: 489-539Google Scholar). Sputum forms a complex biological barrier composed of highly branched and strongly negatively charged mucus glycoproteins (∼10–40 MDa), water, lipids, salts, macromolecules, and cellular debris, which form a dense, highly viscoelastic protective barrier over epithelial cells in the conductive airways (2.Sanders N. De Smedt S. Demeester J. J. Pharm. Sci. 1999; 89: 835-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The viscoelasticity of the mucosal layer is believed to be largely due to a high number of physical entanglements between mucus glycoproteins and the other mucosal constituents. These entanglements are stabilized by covalent and non-covalent interactions, including hydrogen bonding and electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (3.Norris D.A. Puri N. Sinko P.J. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 1997; 63: 1481-1492Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 4.Khanvilkar K. Donovan M.D. Flanagan D.R. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2001; 48: 173-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar).

The permeability of normal mucus is inversely related to its viscoelasticity (6.Bhat P.G. Flanagan D.R. Donovan M.D. J. Pharm. Sci. 1996; 85: 624-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, increasing viscoelasticity of CF sputum correlates with an increase in overall transport rates of 100–200-nm particles (5.Sanders N.N. De Smedt S.C. Van Rompaey E. Simoens P. De Baets F. Demeester J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 162: 1905-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Current methods, such as fluorescent recovery after photobleaching and fluorescent imaging, used to determine the rate of diffusion of particles in CF sputum provide only the ensemble-averaged transport of particles through a non-physiologically thick sputum slab (5.Sanders N.N.

Fluorescent recovery after photobleaching and fluorescent imaging do not provide individual particle transport rates and do not allow measurement of local heterogeneities in transport rates, which limits insight into complex transport phenomena that control particle diffusion in CF sputum. To elucidate the mode and rate of transport of individual particles in CF sputum, fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles of controlled size and surface charge were embedded in CF sputum obtained from human volunteers. Particle size was varied from 100 to 500 nm, which is the relevant size range for adenovirus, liposomal, and polymer-mediated transfection (5.Sanders N.N. De Smedt S.C. Van Rompaey E. Simoens P.

Modification of surface charge was tested with amine-modified and carboxylated polystyrene particles, which have neutral and negative surface charges at physiological pH, respectively. The spontaneous, thermally excited motion of dozens of nanoparticles was simultaneously monitored with 5-nm spatial resolution and 33-ms temporal resolution via high resolution time-resolved epifluorescence microscopy (9.Apgar J.

Mucolytic agents currently used clinically to reduce mucus viscosity and increase mucociliary clearance rates may be important adjuvants to gene delivery (13.Ferrari S. Kitson C. Farley R. Steel R. Marriott C. Parkins D.A. Scarpa M. Wainwright B. Evans M.J. Colledge W.H. Geddes D.M. Alton E.W. Gene Ther. 2001; 8: 1380-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 14.Mrsny R. Daugherty A. Short S. Widmer R. Siegel M. Keller G. J. Drug Target. 1996; 4: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Previous studies have focused on the effects of these agents on the transfection of cultured cells covered by non-physiological mucus gels. Because nanoparticle transport in CF sputum is typically very slow, an improved understanding of the relationship between CF mucus viscoelastic properties, which can be manipulated by mucolytic agents, and the transport of particles with a variety of surface chemistries may be critical to the design of DNA carriers for delivery in the central airways of the lung (15.Rubin B. J. Aerosol Med. 1996; 9: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). CF sputum was treated with DNase, and the effects on macroviscoelasticity and microviscoelasticity and particle transport were assessed. The viscoelasticity of CF sputum was significantly reduced after the addition of DNase, but the ensemble-averaged diffusion rate remained unchanged. However, the distribution of transport rates of individual particles was more homogeneous, demonstrating that a reduction in viscoelasticity may correspond to a reduction in heterogeneities in transport rates in CF sputum. Sputum Collection from CF Patients—Human respiratory sputum was expectorated from male and female CF patients ages 18–21 and collected by Dr. Pamela Zeitlin at the Johns Hopkins Cystic Fibrosis Research Development Center. Samples were transported on ice from the hospital to the laboratory for same day rheological characterization and particle tracking (see below). Sample collection was performed carefully to avoid contamination with salivary enzymes. Macrorheological Characterization of CF Sputum—To allow comparison with our microrheological characterization by MPT, macrorheological characterization of CF sputum was performed with a strain-controlled cone and plate rheometer (ARES-100, Rheometrics, Piscataway, NJ) using techniques described previously (16.Tseng Y. Fedorov E. McCaffery J.M. Almo S.C. Wirtz D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 17.Ma L. Xu J. Coulombe P.A. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19145-19151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Small oscillatory deformations of controlled amplitude and frequency were applied to specimens to extract the frequency-dependent viscoelastic properties of CF sputum. We report the frequency-dependent elastic and viscous moduli, G′(ω) and G″(ω), which are the in-phase and out-of-phase components of the stress induced in CF sputum samples divided by the maximum amplitude of the applied deformation (typically 1%), respectively. These dynamic measurements were conducted at low deformation amplitudes to test the linear rheological properties of CF sputum, for which viscous and elastic moduli are independent of the deformation amplitude (see Fig. 1B). To test the shear viscosity of CF sputum, the rheometer was switched to steady mode and specimens were subjected to shear deformations at controlled shear rates (see Fig. 1C). The steady viscosity, η, is the ratio of the measured stress induced within the specimen and the shear rate. Error bars in Fig. 1, A–C, were computed using the mean ± S.E. for the six samples included in the macrorheological characterization of CF sputum. Multiple Particle Tracking in CF Sputum: Particle Transport Rates and Microrheology—Mode of transport (diffusive versus subdiffusive) and time-dependent diffusion coefficients of individual particles embedded in CF sputum were determined by the method of multiple particle tracking recently described for solutions of F-actin and DNA (9.Apgar J.

A. 2003; 100: 3878-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 19.Tseng Y. Kole T.P. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3162-3176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Hundreds of fluorescently labeled carboxylated (Molecular Probes catalog numbers F8803, F8810, and F8813 for 100-, 200-, and 500-nm beads, respectively) or amine-modified (catalog number F8764) polystyrene microspheres (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) with highly uniform diameters of 100, 200, and 500 nm were embedded in CF sputum, and their trajectories were recorded using a silicon-intensified target camera (VE-1000, Dage-MTI, Michigan City, IN) mounted on an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Nikon) equipped with ×100 oil-immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.3). Detailed information such as particle size distributions and excitation and emission wavelengths is available from Molecular Probes. The intensity-weighted centroid of each particle was tracked with 33-ms temporal resolution and ∼5-nm spatial resolution as independently determined by tracking the apparent displacements of microspheres immobilized on a glass coverslip with a strong adhesive (9.Apgar J. Tseng Y. Fedorov E. Herwig M.B. Almo S.C. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1095-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). High spatial resolution of particle displacements (<1 pixel) is obtained by tracking the intensity-weighted centroid of individual particles (9.Apgar J. Tseng Y. Fedorov E. Herwig M.B. Almo S.C. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1095-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Nanotracking was performed by monitoring the spontaneous, thermally excited motion of the probe nanospheres in the plane of focus of the objective. Trajectories in the focal plane are two-dimensional projections of three-dimensional displacements, i.e. we assume that CF sputum is isotropic but not necessarily homogenous. In this case, displacements of the particles along the x, y-, and z axes are uncorrelated; hence, 〈Δr2(τ)〉2D = 〈Δx2〉 + 〈Δy2〉 is simply equal to two-thirds of 〈Δr2(τ)〉3D = 〈Δx2〉 + 〈Δy2〉 + 〈Δz2〉 because 〈Δx2〉 = 〈Δy2〉 = 〈Δz2〉 (20.Berg H.C. Random Walks in Biology. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ1993Google Scholar). While particles may travel sometimes outside the plane of focus, it is a rare occurrence because capture times are relatively short (20 s) and mucus is a high viscosity fluid. The apparent size of particles increases as they move away from the plane of focus, but this is of no consequence since our microscope is well aligned and these out-of-plane movements do not translate into (artificial) x-y movements of the centroid of the particles. 100–150 particles were tracked for each sample with 5–20 particles in each field of view. High resolution 20-s movies of microsphere displacements were captured with a custom routine incorporated in the particle tracking software (Metamorph) as described previously (9.Apgar J. Tseng Y.

J. 2002; 83: 3162-3176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The mean squared displacements of individual particles were computed from microsphere trajectories using an Excel Macros routine (9.Apgar J. Tseng Y. Fedorov E. Herwig M.B. Almo S.C. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1095-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 21.Tseng Y. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1643-1656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). All of the MPT measurements were conducted in a temperature-controlled microscope chamber maintained at 37 °C. The coordinates of the microsphere centroids were transformed into families of time-averaged mean squared displacements (MSD), 〈Δr2(τ)〉 = 〈[x(t + τ) – x(t)]2 + [y(t + τ) – y(t)]2〉 (τ = time scale or time lag), from which distributions of MSDs, time-dependent particle diffusion coefficients, and apparent local microviscosities of the sputum samples were calculated (10.Tseng Y. An K.M. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18143-18150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22.Mason T.G. Ganesan K. van Zanten J.H. Wirtz D. Kuo S.C. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1997; 79: 3282-3285Crossref Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Recombinant Human DNase Treatment—CF sputum was treated ex vivo with a mucolytic agent, recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase), at a concentration of 7 μg/ml, which is the estimated in vivo concentration (14.Mrsny R. Daugherty A. Short S. Widmer R. Siegel M. Keller G. J. Drug Target. 1996; 4: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Particle tracking (providing particle transport rates and CF sputum microrheology) and macrorheological characterization of CF sputum were performed before and 30 min after the administration of rhDNase. Four-dimensional (x, y, z, and t) Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy—Confocal images of particles embedded in CF sputum were captured with an AxioCAM HR camera attached to a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta laser-scanning confocal microscope. The stock solution is 1% by volume of particles, which was diluted 100-fold. The final concentration by volume of the particles in mucus was 0.03%. Sputum was placed in a Bioptechs thermal regulated chamber (Bioptechs, Butler, PA) maintained at 37 °C and imaged before and 30–120 min after treatment with rhDNase. To assess qualitatively particle mobility in CF sputum after the addition of mucolytic agents, particles dispersed throughout sputum samples were imaged in four dimensions (with a time interval of ∼5 min). ζ Potential Measurements—The surface potentials of amine-modified and carboxylated polystyrene particles (pH 4–8) were measured by particle electrophoresis (Zetasizer 2000, Malvern, PA). The pH of particle suspensions (100 μl of solution, 0.02% particles diluted in 3 ml of 150 mm NaCl) was adjusted prior to measuring the ζ potentials with hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide solutions. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Specimens were prepared by diluting (1:10) fresh CF sputum with sputum buffer (pH 7.4) (5.Sanders N.N. De Smedt S.C. Van Rompaey E. Simoens P. De Baets F. Demeester J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 162: 1905-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and allowing to stir at 4 °C for 1 h prior to imaging. Sputum was adsorbed to ionized Formvar grids, negatively stained with uranyl acetate, and observed using a Philips LS420 transmission electron microscope. Macrorheological Properties of CF Sputum—To allow a comparison with the novel characterization of the microrheological properties of CF sputum by MPT, the overall macroscopic viscoelasticity of CF sputum was first characterized using a sensitive strain-controlled cone and plate rheometer. The dynamic response of CF sputum to shear was tested by applying oscillatory deformations of small amplitude (see “Experimental Procedures”). The viscous modulus, G″(ω), of CF sputum remained relatively independent of frequency over a range of 0.01–100 rad/s while the elastic modulus, G′(ω), increased steadily with frequency over the same range (Fig. 1A). Therefore, the elastic resistance of CF sputum to shear deformation increased when subjected to increasing rates of deformation. The elastic modulus of CF sputum was much higher than the viscous modulus over the entire tested range of frequency (Fig. 1A), indicating that CF sputum behaves as a viscoelastic solid when probed by macrorheological techniques. Interestingly, the elastic modulus at low and intermediate frequency adopted approximately a power law behavior as determined by the slope of G′(ω) on a log-log plot, G′(ω)∼ω½ (Fig. 1A). This characteristic exponent suggests that sputum macromolecules behave like flexible polymers (G′(ω)∼ωn; n = 1 for a rigid polymer, n = 0.75 for a semi-rigid polymer, and n = 0.5 for a flexible polymer) (23.Palmer A. Xu J. Kuo S.C. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1063-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The mechanical response of CF sputum to shear was assayed by subjecting specimen to shear deformations of fixed frequency and increasing deformation amplitudes (Fig. 1B). Elastic and viscous moduli of CF sputum were independent of deformations up to strain amplitudes of ∼10% and progressively softened beyond that threshold amplitude (Fig. 1B). The macroscopic viscoelastic character of CF sputum may be characterized by computing the phase angle, δ = tan–1(G″/G′). A phase angle of δ = 0, 90°, or between 0 and 90° indicates that a material behaves like a Hookean solid, viscous liquid, or viscoelastic gel, respectively. The phase angle of human CF sputum (n = 6) was 16.2 ± 0.6° (at ω = 1 rad/s). This result confirms that CF mucus is significantly more elastic than viscous, a signature of viscoelastic-solid behavior. The steady state viscosity of CF sputum was measured by subjecting specimen to steady state deformations of controlled shear rate (Fig. 1C). At shear rates of <1 s–1, CF sputum displayed slight shear thickening behavior with a (mean) maximum sputum macroviscosity of ∼700 Poise or 7 × 104 times the viscosity of water (Fig. 1C at a shear rate of 0.2 s–1). CF sputum samples varied from patient to patient, as illustrated by variations in the steady state viscosities (Fig. 1C, inset). Transport of Individual Particles in CF Sputum—The coordinates of the centroids of hundreds of fluorescent microspheres embedded in CF sputum were captured and transformed into families of time-averaged MSDs, 〈Δr2(τ)〉 = 〈[x(Δt + τ) – x(Δt)]2 + [y(Δt+τ) –y(Δt)]2〉 (τ = time scale or time lag; t = elapsed time), from which distributions of MSDs, time-dependent particle diffusion coefficients, and apparent local microviscosities of the sputum samples were calculated (10.Tseng Y. An K.M. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18143-18150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22.Mason T.G. Ganesan K. van Zanten J.H. Wirtz D. Kuo S.C. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1997; 79: 3282-3285Crossref Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Individual particle MSDs were used to determine averaged (or “ensemble-averaged”) MSD, allowing variation in particle transport rates in CF sputum to be directly measured for the first time. The ensemble MSD of 100, 200, and 500 nm particles in CF sputum samples (n = 3 sputum samples/particle size; n ≥ 100 particles/sample) did not have a linear dependence on time (Fig. 2A) as would occur in a purely viscous medium. Particle transport rates in CF sputum decreased with time (Fig. 2B). The product of particle size, a, and its MSD as a function of time scale was approximately the same for 100-, 200-, and 500-nm particles (with the exception of the slope of the MSD*a for 500-nm particles), indicating that the diffusion coefficient varies approximately as the inverse of the particle diameter as predicted by the classical Stokes-Einstein relation (Fig. 2C) (see “Discussion”). A large variation in transport rates for individual particles was observed in CF sputum, especially for 100- and 200-nm particles (Fig. 3, A, C, and E). The distributions of individual particle MSDs at Δt = 0.1 s for 100-, 200-, and 500-nm-diameter particles (Fig. 3, B, D, and F) were used to quantify the heterogeneity of particle transport rates as a function of bead size. In addition to being slower on average, particle transport became more homogeneous with increasing bead size. The percentage of 100-, 200-, and 500-nm particles with transport rates within 2% of their ensemble averaged MSDs were 28, 36, and 56%, respectively (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the majority of 100- and 200-nm particles (80 and 85%, respectively) had transport rates that were less than their ensemble average, whereas only 30% of 500-nm particles transported more slowly than their ensemble average. However, a small fraction of 100- and 200-nm particles (1.6 and 2.1%) had transport rates 10–40-fold higher than their ensemble averages, whereas 0% of 500-nm particles exhibited rates faster than 8-fold higher than their ensemble average. Microviscosities versus Macroviscosities—Although nanoparticle transport rates are time-dependent in CF sputum, transport rates of 100- and 200-nm particles at Δt = 10 s are primarily diffusive as determined by the linearity of the slope of the MSD (Fig. 2A). This observation allowed us to calculate an effective microviscosity encountered by 100- and 200-nm particles in CF sputum from their diffusion coefficients, D(Δt), at Δt = 10 s using the Stokes-Einstein equation. The microviscosity of CF sputum probed by 100- and 200-nm particles was 15- and 7-fold lower, respectively, than its macroviscosity, as measured by a cone and plate rheometer (Fig. 4A). This difference indicates that particle transport is significantly more rapid than would be expected from standard macrorheological measurements of viscosity. The microviscosity of CF sputum may, therefore, reflect the viscosity encountered by particles moving in fluid-filled pores of the CF sputum mesh (Fig. 4B). Effects of rhDNase Treatment on Particle Transport Rate and Macrorheology in CF Sputum—The high DNA concentration in CF sputum is known to increase the viscosity of the gel and may potentially decrease particle transport rates. Therefore, rhDNase (Pulmozyme) was added (7 μg/ml) to human CF sputum (14.Mrsny R. Daugherty A. Short S. Widmer R. Siegel M. Keller G. J. Drug Target. 1996; 4: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and the macrorheological properties of and 200-nm particle transport rates within CF sputum were determined. The macroscopic elasticity (Fig. 5A) was reduced ∼50%, and the macroscopic viscosity (at a shear rate of 1 s–1) was reduced by ∼40% (Fig. 5B). Surprisingly, the average rate of particle transport was not altered for 200-nm particles despite the dramatic decrease in the macrorheological properties of CF sputum 30 min after the addition of rhDNase (Fig. 5C). However, randomly selected MSDs of 200-nm particles (n = 20 of 120 total) before (Fig. 6A) and 30 min after (Fig. 6C) the addition of rhDNase showed that particle transport rates were more homogeneous after the addition of rhDNase. These arbitrarily selected MSDs constituted an accurate representation of the distributions of MSDs, because the number of particles with MSDs close to the ensemble-averaged MSD increased by ∼20% (same results for Δt = 0.1 s) (Fig. 6, B and D). As expected, we observed similar results with 100-nm nanoparticles, whereas 500-nm nanoparticles saw little change in the heterogeneity of their diffusivities, perhaps because those particles are much larger than the average pore size whose microviscosity is increased by rhDNase treatment (data not shown).Fig. 6A–D, effect of rhDNase (Pulmozyme) treatment (7 μg/ml) on the transport properties of individual 200-nm carboxylated polystyrene particles in CF mucus (120 particles for each condition). 20 MSD profiles of a subset (20 of 120) of individual particles for no treatment (A) and 30 min after rhDNase treatment (C) are shown. The distributions of normalized MSDs for no rhDNase treatment (B) and 30 min after rhDNase treatment (D) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effects of Surface Charge on Particle Transport Rates—The adhesivity of amine-modified and carboxylated 200-nm-diameter polystyrene particles to CF sputum was assessed qualitatively by confocal microscopy. Both amine-modified and carboxylated particles were partly adhesive to CF sputum (Fig. 7A), which may be due in part to the hydrophobicity of the polystyrene core. Note that these interactions affect mostly the nature of transport (diffusive versus subdiffusive) at short time scales, but transport remains diffusive at long time scales albeit with much smaller diffusion coefficients than expected in buffer. Despite the similarities in adhesivity of these particles, the surface chemistry imparted large differences in the particle surface charge with the amine-modified particles having a more neutral charge (–4.6 ± 0.4 mV) at physiological pH than the negatively charged carboxylated polys"
https://openalex.org/W2172089648,"During CNS development, combinatorial expression of transcription factors controls neuronal subtype identity and subsequent axonal trajectory. Regulatory genes designating the routing of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons at the optic chiasm to the appropriate hemisphere, a pattern critical for proper binocular vision, have not been identified. Here, we show that the zinc finger transcription factor Zic2, a vertebrate homolog of the Drosophila gene odd-paired, is expressed in RGCs with an uncrossed trajectory during the period when this subpopulation grows from the ventrotemporal retina toward the optic chiasm. Loss- and gain-of-function analyses indicate that Zic2 is necessary and sufficient to regulate RGC axon repulsion by cues at the optic chiasm midline. Moreover, Zic2 expression reflects the extent of binocularity in different species, suggesting that Zic2 is an evolutionarily conserved determinant of RGCs that project ipsilaterally. These data provide evidence for transcriptional coding of axon pathfinding at the midline."

While the repolarization phase of the AP can be wrought by the kinetics of the principal currents, small and sustained outward currents also define this phase, rendering this region prone to irregular membrane excitation. In humans, delineation of the outward currents that confer the late repolarization phase of the cardiac AP is crucial for our understanding of the etiology of arrhythmias. We provide a novel report that demonstrates that the repolarization phase of cardiac AP shows marked sensitivity toward apamin, an exclusive ligand for a small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel (2.Ishii T.M.

However, functional significance of KCa in the heart has not previously been documented. KCa channels can be divided into three main subfamilies (3.Vergara C. Latorre R. Marrion N.V. Adelman J.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 5.Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. Curr. Opin. Chem.

These include the large-conductance Ca2+- and voltage-activated K+ channels (BK), the intermediate-conductance KCa channels (IK), and the small-conductance KCa channels (SK), which are sensitive to apamin and scyllatoxin. Among the SK channels, they are encoded by at least three genes, SK1, SK2, SK3 (4.Stocker M. Pedarzani P. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 476-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 6.Kohler M. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Kinzie J.M. Marrion N.V. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), with differential sensitivity toward apamin. SK2 is highly sensitive to apamin, with a half-blocking concentration (IC50) of 60 pmol/liter, whereas SK1 channels are not affected by 100 nmol/liter apamin (2.Ishii T.M. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23195-23200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). SK3 channels are intermediate. Here, we report for the first time, the presence of IK,Ca (Ca2+-activated K+ current) in cardiac myocytes that plays a crucial role in cardiac AP profile. Using a combination of electrophysiological recordings and biochemical and molecular biological techniques, we have identified the presence of SK2 isoform in the heart. Importantly, there is differential expression of SK2 channel with more abundant SK2 channel in the atria compared with the ventricles. Thus, specific ligands for IK,Ca may offer a unique therapeutic opportunity to directly modify the atrial cells without interfering with ventricular myocytes. The human study protocol was approved by the University of California, Davis, Institutional Review Board. All animal care and procedures were approved by the University of California, Davis, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Electrophysiologic Recordings—Twelve-week-old male CD-1 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories, Inc. (Wilmington, MA). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Single mouse atrial and ventricular and human atrial myocytes were isolated as described previously (8.Ahmmed G.U. Xu Y. Hong Dong P. Zhang Z. Eiserich J. Chiamvimonvat N. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1005-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9.Van Wagoner D.R. Pond A.L. McCarthy P.M. Trimmer J.S. Nerbonne J.M. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 772-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Briefly, for human atrial myocytes, atrial appendages were collected in ice cold cardioplegic solution and transferred to the laboratory. Tissue was rinsed in a dissection buffer containing (mm/liter): NaCl, 140; KCl, 5.4; MgCl2, 1.2; HEPES, 5; glucose, 5; and 2,3-butanedione monoxime, 30; pH 7.0. The tissue was cut into small chunks (<1 mm3) and washed with oxygenated buffered solution three times. Chunks were transferred to a 50-ml Falcon tube containing 10 ml of Ca2+-free buffer with a composition similar to that of dissection buffer, supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin, collagenase (Worthington, type II (225 units/mg), 0.64 mg/ml), and protease (Sigma, type XXIV, 0.4 mg/ml) but without 2,3-butanedione monoxime. The tube was placed in a water bath (32–33 °C) mounted over a magnetic stirrer (about 60 rpm) for 45 min. During a period of 45 min, fresh enzyme buffer was replaced at an interval of 10 or 15 min. After 45 min of enzyme treatment, the supernatant was aspirated and discarded. Fresh enzyme solution (collagenase only, 0.48 mg/ml) was added for an additional 10 min. From this step, the supernatant was collected and centrifuged for 2 min at 300 rpm (about 18 g) after every additional 10 min. The resulting supernatant was then discarded and the myocytes were stored using a high-K+ solution containing (mmol/liter) potassium glutamate, 120; KCl, 25; MgCl2, 1, EGTA, 0.1; glucose, 10; and HEPES, 10, pH 7.4, with KOH at room temperature. Cells were used for electrophysiologic recording within 7–8 h after isolation. This isolation procedure yields ∼80% of Ca2+-tolerant ventricular myocytes with clear striations. APs were recorded at room temperature using the perforated-patch technique (10.Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15195) Google Scholar, 11.Korn S. Marty A. Connor J. Horn R. Methods Neurosci. 1991; 4: 264-373Google Scholar, 12.Ahmmed G.U. Dong P.H. Song G. Ball N.A. Xu Y. Walsh R.A. Chiamvimonvat N. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 558-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The patch pipettes were backfilled with amphotericin (200 μg/ml). Pipette solution contained (mmol/liter) potassium glutamate 120, KCl; 25, MgCl2; 1, CaCl2; 1, HEPES; 10, pH 7.4 with KOH. The external solution contained (mmol/liter) NaCl, 138, KCl, 4, MgCl2, 1, CaCl2, 2, NaH2PO4, 0.33, glucose, 10, HEPES, 10, pH 7.4, with NaOH. All data were corrected for the liquid junction potentials as described previously (13.Neher E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Whole-cell IK,Ca was recorded using conventional voltage clamp protocol. The extracellular solution contained (in mmol/liter): N-methylglucamine (NMG), 140; KCl, 4; MgCl2, 1; glucose, 5; and HEPES, 10 (pH 7.4 using HCl). The internal solution consisted of (in mmol/liter): potassium gluconate, 144; MgCl2, 1.15; EGTA, 5; HEPES, 10; and CaCl2 yielding a free (unchelated) [Ca2+] of 0.1–1000 nmol/liter using Calcium Titration Software (14.Robertson S. Potter J.D. Methods Pharmacol. 1984; 5: 63-75Google Scholar) to calculate free [Ca2+], bound and dissociated. Where a zero free internal Ca2+ solution was employed, no CaCl2 was added, and the EGTA concentration was maintained at 5 mm. The pH was adjusted to 7.25 using KOH. The Ca2+ dependence activation of the apamin-sensitive currents was assessed using a voltage clamp step to +60 mV in control and after apamin (50 pmol/liter) and intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) of 1 and 1000 nmol/liter (Fig. 2C). We further documented the presence of the IK,Ca using the two-pulse voltage clamp protocol in human atrial myocytes (Fig. 2D). Composition of the external and internal solution was as follows (in mmol/liter): internal: potassium glutamate, 15; NMG, 120; K2(ATP), 2.5; EGTA, 0.01; HEPES, 10, pH 7.4 with glutamic acid; external: sodium glutamate, 10; 4-AP, 5; E4031 (10 μmol/liter, Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel); KCl, 1; NMG, 120; niflumic acid, 0.05; HEPES, 10; glucose, 10; CaCl2, 2; MgCl2, 1, pH 7.4 with glutamic acid. A voltage-ramp protocol was used to elicit whole-cell current to simulate AP to further illustrate the dependence of the SK current on intracellular Ca2+. The experiments were carried out using the perforated-patch technique to preserve intracellular milieu using external solution as in Fig. 1 during AP recordings in the absence of external K+, Ca2+, or Na+ channel blockers (Fig. 2E). The pulse protocol used is shown in the inset. For assessment of dose-response curve to apamin, the solid lines in Fig. 2F represent the least squares fit to the data points using the function: I/I0 = 1/{1+([blocker]/IC50)n}, where I and I0 is the current in the presence and absence of apamin, respectively, and [blocker] represents the concentration of apamin in pmol/liter. Numbers in parentheses represent the number of cells for each group. For single-channel current recordings, excised inside-out patches were used to allow application of Ca2+ or Ca2+ chelator to the internal side of the channels. The bath solution contained (in mmol/liter): potassium glutamate, 120; KCl, 20; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 1; glucose, 10; and HEPES, 10; pH 7.4 with KOH. The pipette solution contained (in mmol/liter): KCl, 5; NMG, 125; tetraethyl ammonium chloride, 20; 4-AP, 5; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 2; HEPES, 10; glucose, 10; pH 7.4 with HCl with a calculated Nernst potential for K+ ion (EK) of –83 mV. Amplitude histograms at a given test potential were generated and fitted to a single Gaussian distribution to obtain the mean unitary currents. Leak-subtracted current records were idealized using a half-height criterion (15.Colquhoun D. Sigworth F. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-Channel Recording. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 483-585Crossref Google Scholar). Idealized records were used to construct the open probability (Po). The single channel activity could not be recorded from all the inside-out patches. The probability of successful recording of the SK channel activity was estimated to be ∼15% (7/45 patches). Where appropriate, pooled data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were performed using the Student's t test with p < 0.05 considered significant. Western Blot Analysis—Immunoblots were performed as described previously (12.Ahmmed G.U. Dong P.H. Song G. Ball N.A. Xu Y. Walsh R.A. Chiamvimonvat N. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 558-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Protein samples were prepared from atria and ventricles of mice, cats and rats. Human heart lysate was obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Human atrial tissue was obtained during cardiac aortocoronary bypass graft surgery. The following primary antibodies were used: 1) anti-SK2 (Alomone Laboratories), a polyclonal antibody raised in rabbit against a purified peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 542–559 of rat SK2 located in COOH terminus (6.Kohler M. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Kinzie J.M. Marrion N.V. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar); 2) monoclonal mouse anti-rabbit glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, Research Diagnostics, Inc., Flanders, NJ); and 3) anti-cyclophilin antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) were used as internal control for loading. Following incubation in the primary antibody, membranes were probed with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Calbiochem). The protein bands were detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The signal obtained from atrial and ventricular tissues were compared. Quantification of the signals was performed by densitometry (ImageQuant). Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—Total RNA was prepared from human atria obtained during cardiac aortocoronary bypass graft surgery as well as from mouse brain and heart using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized from total RNA samples by oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription (Superscript II RNase H-Reverse Transcriptase, Invitrogen). cDNA was then subjected to PCR amplification using HotStarTaq DNA Polymerase (Qiagen). Full-length SK2 coding sequences were obtained from human atria and mouse atria and ventricles using the following primers: 1) for human atria, 5′-ATGAGCAGCTGCAGGTACAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTAGCTACTCTCTGATGAGG-3′ (reverse) according to the published sequence of human myometrial SK2 (accession number AF397175) and 2) for mouse atria and ventricles, 5′-ATGAGCAGCTGCAGGTACAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTAGCTACTCTCTGATGAAG-3′ (reverse) according to the published sequence of mouse colonic myocyte SK2 (accession number AF357240). The primers used to amplify GAPDH from human tissue were 5′-CGTGTCAGTGGTGGACCTGACCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAAAGGTGGAGGAGTGGGT-3′ (reverse). The absence of genomic contamination in the RNA samples was confirmed with reverse transcription-negative controls (no RT) for each experiment. Amplified products were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO and pCRII-TOPO plasmid vector (Invitrogen) and analyzed by DNA sequencing of both forward and reverse strands. Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy—Immunofluorescence labeling was performed as described previously (16.Gao T. Bunemann M. Gerhardstein B.L. Ma H. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25436-25444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with anti-SK2 antibody (1:20 dilution in 10% goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C). Immunofluorescence labeling for confocal microscopy were done by treatment with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Calbiochem, 1:30 dilution). Immunofluorescence-labeled samples were examined using a Pascal Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscopy. Control experiments performed by preincubation of the primary antibody with the respective antigenic peptide (1:1) did not show positive staining under the same experimental conditions used. Identical settings were used for all the specimens. The nucleotide sequences of the mouse and human cardiac SK2 channels have been submitted to GenBank™, and the accession numbers are AF533008 and AY258141, respectively. The following are the accession numbers of the published full-length SK2 coding sequences: mouse colon (accession number AF357240), rat brain (6.Kohler M. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Kinzie J.M. Marrion N.V. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) (accession number U69882), mouse cochlea (accession number AY123778), human myometrium (accession number AF397175), and human leukemic Jurkat T cells (17.Desai R. Peretz A. Idelson H. Lazarovici P. Attali B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39954-39963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (accession number AF239613). Existence of IK,Ca in Human Atrial and Mouse Atrial and Ventricular Myocytes—To directly examine the functional role of IK,Ca, perforated-patch techniques were used to record AP from human atrial and mouse atrial and ventricular myocytes. Fig. 1 A shows examples of AP recorded from an isolated human atrial myocyte in control and after application of a low concentration of a SK channel-specific blocker, apamin (50 pmol/liter). A significant prolongation of the terminal portion of the AP was observed after the toxin. The effect could be reversed upon wash out. Summary data for action potential duration at 50 and 90% repolarization (APD50, APD90) is shown in the right panel in control and after application of 50 pmol/liter apamin. Fig. 1, B and C, show examples of mouse atrial AP (left panels) and ventricular myocytes (right panels) in control and after application of apamin (50 pmol/liter, Fig. 1B) and dequalinium chloride (DQ, 1 μmol/liter, Fig. 1C), another known blocker of SK channels. Mouse atrial APs were exquisitely sensitive to apamin at picomolar concentration with significant prolongation of the APs. The effects were much more moderate in ventricular cells (right panels). Bar graphs in the inset show summary data for APD50, APD90 in control, and after application of apamin or DQ (*, p < 0.05). Close examination of the data shows significant differences in the AP duration in the mouse atrial and ventricular myocytes. This is most likely due to a smaller K+ current density in atrial cells compared with ventricular cells, which has been described previously (18.Bou-Abboud E. Li H. Nerbonne J.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 345-358Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19.Xu H. Guo W. Nerbonne J.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 661-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Ca2+Dependence of the Apamin-sensitive Currents—To further document the presence of IK,Ca in cardiac myocytes, whole-cell current was recorded using voltage steps from a holding potential of –55 mV to inactivate the transient outward K+ currents, which were known to be present in mouse atrial and ventricular myocytes (18.Bou-Abboud E. Li H. Nerbonne J.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 345-358Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19.Xu H. Guo W. Nerbonne J.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 661-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Na+ and Ca2+ ions were eliminated from the external solution. The interior of the cells was dialyzed using pipette solutions containing known concentrations of Ca2+ as described under “Materials and Methods.” Using the above recording condition, a time-independent inward rectifier K+ current (IK1) could be recorded (Fig. 2A). In addition, a component of both inward and outward current could be blocked by application of apamin (50 pmol/liter). This inhibition could be reversed upon washout. The apamin-sensitive traces were obtained using digital subtraction. The current density-voltage relation of the apamin-sensitive component is shown in B showing inward rectification similar to SK current previously reported for rat brain SK channels (20.Xia X.M. Fakler B. Rivard A. Wayman G. Johnson-Pais T. Keen J.E. Ishii T. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Lutsenko S. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). In addition, we demonstrated the Ca2+ dependence of the apamin-sensitive current (50 pmol/liter) using [Ca2+]i of 10 and 1000 nmol/liter showing a significant difference in the apamin-sensitive current density (presented as percentage of the total sustained current) at the two different [Ca2+]i. Importantly, no appreciable apamin-sensitive component could be demonstrated when [Ca2+]i was lowered to or beyond 0.1 nmol/liter (Fig. 2C). To further document the presence of IK,Ca in single isolated human atrial myocytes, we used a two-pulse voltage clamp protocol to record IK,Ca while minimizing contamination from Ca2+ current (Fig. 2D). We first depolarized the cells from a holding potential of –55 to 0 mV for 10 ms to activate Ca2+ current and to initiate the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The cells were then stepped to +40 mV to increase the driving force for K+ while decreasing the driving force for Ca2+ current. The outward current identified was found to be exquisitely sensitive to apamin. Traces shown are in control, after application of apamin (50 pmol/liter) and after wash out. Composition of the external and internal solutions used are different from Fig. 2, A–C, and are indicated under “Materials and Methods.” Calculated EK in this recording condition was –76 mV. The contribution of SK current should parallel the variations in internal Ca2+ concentration during AP. To further illustrate the dependence of the SK current on intracellular Ca2+, we performed experiments using voltage-ramp protocol to simulate AP. The experiments were carried out using perforated-patch technique to preserve intracellular milieu using external solution as in Fig. 1 during AP recordings in the absence of external K+, Ca2+, or Na+ channel blockers (Fig. 2E). A holding potential of –50 mV was used to inactivate the inward Na+ current and a large component of the 4-aminopyridine-sensitive transient outward K+ current (Ito), which is known to be present in mouse cardiac myocytes, without significant inactivation of the l-type Ca2+ channels. We observed a component of the outward current, which was Ca2+-dependent and could be blocked by application of low concentration of apamin (100 pmol/liter) (Fig. 2E). This inhibition could be reversed upon washout. Moreover, the same component was found to be sensitive to DQ. In contrast to the current density-voltage relation in Fig. 2B showing inward rectification, the current elicited by the voltage-ramp protocol was mainly outward likely mirroring changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, which is voltage-dependent (21.Mitcheson J.S. Hancox J.C. Levi A.J. Pflügers Arch. 1997; 433: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We compared the dose-response curves of the outward current to inhibition by apamin from mouse ventricular and atrial myocytes (Fig. 2F). IK,Ca from atrial myocytes showed a marked sensitivity toward SK channel blocker, apamin, with an IC50 of 42.3 pmol/liter. In contrast, the IC50 obtained from the ventricular myocytes was 95.9 pmol/liter (Fig. 2F). Direct Demonstration of the Existence of IK,Ca Using Single-channel Recordings—Single-channel currents were recorded using excised inside-out patches (Fig. 3, A–D). A shows single-channel openings in the presence of 1 mmol/liter Ca2+ in the bath solution. Single-channel activities were rapidly abolished after addition of 10 mmol/liter EGTA (a Ca2+ chelator) into the bath solution. We have previously documented the presence of aCa2+-activated Cl– current (ICl,Ca) in mouse ventricular myocytes (22.Xu Y. Dong P.H. Zhang Z. Ahmmed G.U. Chiamvimonvat N. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H302-H314Google Scholar). However, the single channel activities identified here were insensitive to niflumic acid, in contrast to the previously identified ICl,Ca (22.Xu Y. Dong P.H. Zhang Z. Ahmmed G.U. Chiamvimonvat N. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H302-H314Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). The single-channel current-voltage relation showed a single-channel conductance of ∼3 picosiemens with a reversal potential of –84 mV, close to the calculated Nernst potential for K+ (EK) of –83 mV, suggesting that the channel is a K+-selective channel (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the channel was completely voltage-independent (D). It has previously been documented that several features distinguish members of the SK family from their closest phenotypic neighbors, the BK channels, and these include the low single-channel conductance of the SK channels and the absence of voltage dependence and their sensitivities toward apamin (3.Vergara C. Latorre R. Marrion N.V. Adelman J.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Our biophysical data agree well with the pharmacological data obtained using whole-cell recordings and suggest that the channel identified in the heart represents a small-conductance IK,Ca (SK family) and most likely the SK2 isoform as a result of its high sensitivity toward apamin. Molecular Correlates of IK,Ca and Quantitative Immunoblots—To identify the channel proteins, we performed immunoblots using antibodies generated against different types of KCa channels. We demonstrated the presence of a protein, which reacts to a specific antibody against SK2 isoform with an expected size of 60 kDa in mouse, cat, and human myocytes, respectively (Fig. 4, A–C). Whole human heart lysate (mainly ventricular tissue) as well as human atria obtained during cardiac aortocoronary bypass graft surgery were used for the experiments. Consistent with the functional data, the SK2 isoform is differentially expressed at the protein level in human as well as mouse atria versus ventricles (Fig. 4). Cyclophylin or GAPDH antibodies were used in these experiments as internal control for amount of total protein loaded. Immunodetection of SK2 Channels in Dissociated Human and Mouse Atrial and Ventricular Myocytes—To directly rule out the possibility that the immunoreactivity observed in the Western blots may reflect the presence of SK channel in other cell types in the cardiac homogenate, e.g. vascular smooth muscle cells, we performed a immunofluorescence study using single isolated mouse atiral and ventricular myocytes and human atrial myocytes. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy data showed specific reactivity to SK2 antibodies in isolated atrial and ventricular myocytes. Fig. 4, E–G, show specific labeling with SK2 antibody in isolated mouse atrial, mouse ventricular, and human atrial myocytes, respectively. Preincubation of the primary antibodies with the antigenic peptide in control experiments eliminated the positive labeling further confirming that the labeling seen in E–G was epitope-specific (Fig. 4H). In addition, the mouse atrial myocytes were more intensely labeled compared with ventricular myocytes. Cloning of the Full-length Human and Mouse Heart SK2 cDNA Using RT-PCR Amplification—We further probed for the existence of SK2 channel in the human and mouse cardiac myocytes using RT-PCR and previously published primers. Fig. 5 shows representative RT-PCR amplified products of full-length coding regions from mouse ventricles and atria (Fig. 5A) and human atria (Fig. 5B). Mouse brain was used as a positive control (lane 4 in panel A). Fig. 5C shows RT-PCR amplified product from the corresponding total RNA sample from human atria using primers specific for human GAPDH as positive control. The SK2 cDNA from human atria and mouse atria and ventricles were 1740 and 1722 bp long, respectively. The sequences obtained have been deposited in GeneBank™ (accession numbers are AY258141 and AF533008, respectively). The deduced SK2 protein sequences contain the functional domains that have been described previously in the SK channels. These domains include transmembrane segments S1–S6 and the pore region, characteristic of the K+ channel family of proteins, as well as the calmodulin binding domain (CaMBD). Fig. 5D shows the best alignment (ClustalW 1.8) of SK2 channels human and mouse cardiac myocytes in comparison with SK2 from human myometrium (accession number AF397175), human leukemic Jurkat T cells (accession number AF239613) (17.Desai R.

https://openalex.org/W1976544913,"p53-mediated increase in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1 protein is thought to be the major mediator of cell cycle arrest after DNA damage. Previously p21 protein levels have been reported to increase or to decrease after UV irradiation. We show that p21 protein is degraded after irradiation of a variety of cell types with low but not high doses of UV. Cell cycle arrest occurs despite p21 degradation via Tyr15 inhibitory phosphorylation of cdk2 and differs from the classical p21-dependent checkpoint elicited by ionizing radiation. In contrast to the basal turnover of p21, degradation of p21 switches to ubiquitin/Skp2-dependent proteasome pathway following UV irradiation. ATR activation after UV irradiation is essential for signaling p21 degradation. Finally, UV-induced p21 degradation is essential for optimal DNA repair. These results provide novel insight into regulation of p21 protein and its role in the cellular response to DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2164577098,"Inositol phosphates are well-known signaling molecules, whereas the inositol pyrophosphates, such as diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (InsP7/IP7) and bis-diphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate (InsP8/IP8), are less well characterized. We demonstrate physiologic regulation of Dictyostelium chemotaxis by InsP7 mediated by its competition with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 for binding pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing proteins. Chemoattractant stimulation triggers rapid and sustained elevations in InsP7/InsP8 levels. Depletion of InsP7 and InsP8 by deleting the gene for InsP6 kinase (InsP6K/IP6K), which converts inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6/IP6) to InsP7, causes rapid aggregation of mutant cells and increased sensitivity to cAMP. Chemotaxis is mediated by membrane translocation of certain PH domain-containing proteins via specific binding to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. InsP7 competes for PH domain binding with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 both in vitro and in vivo. InsP7 depletion enhances PH domain membrane translocation and augments downstream chemotactic signaling activity."

https://openalex.org/W2110691897,"RecBCD enzyme is a heterotrimeric helicase/nuclease that initiates homologous recombination at double-stranded DNA breaks. Several of its activities are regulated by the DNA sequence chi (5'-GCTGGTGG-3'), which is recognized in cis by the translocating enzyme. When RecBCD enzyme encounters chi, the intensity and polarity of its nuclease activity are changed, and the enzyme gains the ability to load RecA protein onto the chi-containing, unwound single-stranded DNA. Here, we show that interaction with chi also affects translocation by RecBCD enzyme. By observing translocation of individual enzymes along single molecules of DNA, we could see RecBCD enzyme pause precisely at chi. Furthermore, and more unexpectedly, after pausing at chi, the enzyme continues translocating but at approximately one-half the initial rate. We propose that interaction with chi results in an enzyme in which one of the two motor subunits, likely the RecD motor, is uncoupled from the holoenzyme to produce the slower translocase."
https://openalex.org/W2126918645,"Mcm4,6,7 is a ring-shaped heterohexamer and the putative eukaryotic replication fork helicase. In this study, we examine the mechanism of Mcm4,6,7. Mcm4,6,7 binds to only one strand of a duplex during unwinding, corresponding to the leading strand of a replication fork. Mcm4,6,7 unwinding stops at a nick in either strand. The Mcm4,6,7 ring also actively translocates along duplex DNA, enabling the protein to drive branch migration of Holliday junctions. The Mcm4,6,7 mechanism is very similar to DnaB, except the proteins translocate with opposite polarity along DNA. Mcm4,6,7 and DnaB have different structural folds and evolved independently; thus, the similarity in mechanism is surprising. We propose a “pump in ring” mechanism for both Mcm4,6,7 and DnaB, wherein a single-stranded DNA pump is situated within the central channel of the ring-shaped helicase, and unwinding is the result of steric exclusion. In this example of convergent evolution, the “pump in ring” mechanism was probably selected by eukaryotic and bacterial replication fork helicases in order to restrict unwinding to replication fork structures, stop unwinding when the replication fork encounters a nick, and actively translocate along duplex DNA to accomplish additional activities such as DNA branch migration.

Mcm (minichromosome maintenance) proteins 2–7 are required for the initiation and elongation steps of replication in eukaryotes (1.Labib K. Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F.X.

These Mcm proteins are components of the prereplicative complex that assembles on replication origins before S phase (4.Labib K. Kearsey S.E. Diffley J.F.X. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Mcm proteins can form various complexes, but only the Mcm4,6,7 complex has been shown to contain DNA helicase activity (7.Ishimi Y. J. Biol.

Thus, Mcm4,6,7 may serve as the eukaryotic cellular replication fork helicase, and the other Mcms may have an essential regulatory function. Mcms share a common ancestor with the Superfamily 3 family of helicases, which includes the SV40 large T antigen, a eukaryotic viral replication fork helicase (11.Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Mcms, like T antigen, are members of the AAA+ (ATPase associated with a variety of cellular activities) family of proteins, a diverse family of proteins that share a common protein fold (12.Li D.

The bacterial replication fork helicase, DnaB, is from a different helicase family, called the Family 4 or the DnaB family (13.Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). DnaB shares a common ancestor with RecA and thus contains the RecA fold (14.Sawaya M.R. Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1999; 99: 167-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Thus, the eukaryotic replication fork helicases have a different evolutionary origin and a different protein fold compared with the bacterial replication fork helicases. Mcm4,6,7 forms a ring-shaped hexamer with a large central channel (10.Sato M. Gotow T. You Z. Komamura-Kohno Y. Uchiyama Y. Yabuta N. Nojima H. Ishimi Y. J. Mol.

In one model, a double-ringed Mcm4,6,7 complex is bound to the replication fork with one ring on the 3′ single strand extension (3′ tail) and one ring on the 5′ single-strand extension (5′ tail; Fig. 1A) (24.Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 148-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25.Lee J.-K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In this model, both rings are required for processive unwinding. In a second model, the Mcm ring encircles duplex DNA and twists it, which results in unwinding at a distance (Fig. 1B) (26.Laskey R.A. Madine M.A. EMBO Rep. 2003; 22: 704-712Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For the bacterial cellular and phage replication fork helicases, a consensus has emerged that these helicases unwind DNA by having one strand pass through the central channel of the ring-shaped protein, whereas the second strand passes outside of the central channel (Fig. 1C) (21.Hacker K.J. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14080-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 27.Ahnert P. Patel S.S. J. Biol.

These helicases unwind DNA with 5′ to 3′ polarity (28.Kaplan D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29.LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol.

The bacterial replication fork helicases require a DNA substrate that resembles a replication fork in order to unwind DNA. In other words, the duplex DNA must have both 5′ and 3′ single-stranded extensions, or “tails,” at one end of the duplex (27.Ahnert P. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32267-32273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 31.Kaplan D.L. Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6889-6897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thermus aquaticus DnaB binds to the 5′ tail but not the 3′ tail during unwinding (28.Kaplan D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The 3′ tail is a bulky attachment that stimulates unwinding by forcing steric exclusion of this strand from the central channel of the helicase. As one strand is pulled through the central channel and the other strand is excluded and remains outside the ring, the duplex becomes unwound. DnaB translocates on the 5′ ssDNA 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNAsingle-stranded DNAAMP-PNPadenylyl imidophosphatedTdeoxythymidylates. tail, and if the 3′ tail is absent, the DnaB ring continues on the duplex by sliding up over both strands such that they pass through the central channel of the protein (28.Kaplan D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, DnaB only tracks on the one strand during its action on double-stranded DNA. Further, unwinding does not occur when two strands pass through the central channel. While encircling two DNA strands, DnaB actively translocates in the 5′ to 3′ direction with sufficient force to accomplish several functions, including displacing tightly bound proteins, driving branch migration of a Holliday junction, and unwinding a downstream 3′-tailed DNA strand (32.Kaplan D.L. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 647-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). single-stranded DNA adenylyl imidophosphate deoxythymidylates. In this study, we investigate the unwinding mechanism of Mcm4,6,7 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Surprisingly, we find that Mcm4,6,7 helicase modulates DNA structure by a mechanism that is very similar to that of DnaB, although the proteins are not related. A mechanism is proposed, which we refer to as a “pump in ring” model, which explains the diverse actions catalyzed by both Mcm4,6,7 and DnaB. In this model, the helicase ring encircles ssDNA and translocates along it with force in a single direction (5′ to 3′ for DnaB, 3′ to 5′ for Mcm4,6,7). If the second strand contains a bulky group, it is sterically excluded from the protein ring, and unwinding is observed. If the second strand does not have a bulky group attached, it passes through the central channel along with the first strand, and no unwinding is observed. Mcm4,6,7 can actively translocate along DNA while encircling two DNA strands, like bacterial DnaB, a function that may be used in vivo to accomplish additional functions such as DNA branch migration. Proteins and DNA—Proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified as described: Mcm2p, Mcm4p, Mcm6p, and Mcm7p (33.Davey M.J. Indiani C. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 606-612Google Scholar), except an additional purification step was added to Mcm2p and Mcm7p. Mcm2p was dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol, and then applied to an ssDNA-agarose column equilibrated in the same buffer. The solution that flowed directly through the column contained pure Mcm2p. Mcm7p was diluted in Buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) until its conductivity was equal to that of Buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl. Mcm7p was then loaded onto a MonoS column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated in Buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl. Mcm7p was eluted with Buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. Mcm4,6,7 was reconstituted, and the complex was purified from free subunits as follows. 44 nmol (monomer) each of Mcm4p, Mcm6p, and Mcm7p were incubated in 1 ml of buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl at 15 °C for 30 min. The proteins were then applied to a 1-ml MonoQ column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in Buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl. Proteins were eluted from the column with a 20 ml, 50–500 mm NaCl gradient in buffer A. Mcm4,6,7 complex elutes later than any of the free subunits (∼350–400 mm NaCl). DNA oligonucleotides used to construct the substrates in this report are listed in Supplemental Table I and were synthesized as described (28.Kaplan D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide strands were labeled with 32P at the 5′-end as described (28.Kaplan D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Unwinding and Branch Migration Assays—All manipulations were performed in microcentrifuge tubes on ice and then shifted to 37 °C unless otherwise stated. Oligonucleotides were annealed to form DNA substrates as described (32.Kaplan D.L. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 647-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Enzyme reactions were incubated at 37 °C for the time indicated, and they contained (unless otherwise stated) 1 nm DNA substrate (concentration of labeled strand), 586 nm Mcm4,6,7 complex, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 20 μg/ml creatine kinase, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 20% glycerol, 100 μm EDTA, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5, in a final volume of 6 μl. Reactions were quenched upon adding 1 μl of Proteinase K (10 mg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 1 min, followed by the addition of 5 μl of 2% SDS and 80 mm EDTA. For gel analysis, 5 μl of 15% Ficoll (Type 400; Amersham Biosciences) and 0.25% xylene cyanol FF was added. Samples were snap frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath and stored at –20 °C until electrophoretic analysis was performed. Prior to gel electrophoresis, each reaction tube was incubated in a room temperature water bath for 5 min to reduce intrastrand base pairing. Assays containing DnaB, UvrD, or RuvAB were identical to those using Mcm4,6,7, except that Mcm4,6,7 was replaced with 500 nm DnaB (hexamer), 50 nm UvrD (monomer), or 300 nm RuvA (monomer) and 1 μm RuvB (monomer). RuvA was preincubated with substrate DNA for 1 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of RuvB for the indicated time. For assays containing streptavidin, streptavidin was pre-equilibrated with substrate DNA before adding to the assay mixture. The concentration of the streptavidin tetramer in the final reaction mixture was 100 nm. DNA products were separated from DNA substrate in an 8% polyacrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) using 1× TBE (90 mm Tris-HCl-borate, 2 mm EDTA), 175 V, and room temperature until the unannealed labeled strand was near the bottom of the gel. Gels were dried at 80 °C for 1 h and then exposed to a phosporimaging screen (Amersham Biosciences). Band intensities were quantified, and background counts were subtracted using the IQMac software package, version 1.2 (Amersham Biosciences). For all reactions, unwinding is defined as the fraction of radiolabeled DNA species that is single-stranded. The percentage product in an unreacted sample varied from 0 to 5%. To normalize for the slight variability in these values, the percentage of product was calculated using the equation,&percnt;Unwound=(&percnt;Us-&percnt;U0)/(1-&percnt;U0)(Eq. 1) where %Us represents the percentage unwound in the sample lane of interest, and %U0 is the percentage unwound in the unreacted substrate. Representative experiments are shown in each figure, each performed under standard conditions. Each experiment was performed at least twice. The data were not averaged, because the conditions in some of the repeat experiments differed from the standard conditions. Mcm4,6,7 from S. cerevisiae Unwinds Duplex DNA—In human, mouse, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Mcm4,6,7 exhibits helicase activity in vitro (7.Ishimi Y. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have reconstituted the S. cerevisiae Mcm4,6,7 complex from pure subunits expressed in E. coli and study the resulting Mcm4,6,7 complex for helicase activity. To test the ability of Mcm4,6,7 from S. cerevisiae to unwind DNA, the protein complex was incubated with radiolabeled duplex DNA and ATP (Fig. 2A). The DNA substrate contains a duplex region of 31 base pairs and two single-stranded extensions to form a “forked duplex” (see Fig. 2A). Each single strand extension or “tail” was composed of 60 deoxythymidylates (60 dT). The products of Mcm4,6,7 on this substrate were analyzed on a native polyacrylamide gel, which separates single-stranded product from double-stranded substrate. Mcm4,6,7 converted almost all of the substrate to product (Fig. 2A, top left gel). In a previous study, S. cerevisiae Mcm4,6,7 did not show unwinding activity (37.Schwacha A. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1093-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The Mcm proteins were overexpressed using baculovirus in the previous study, which may result in post-translational modifications that inhibit helicase activity. In many experiments of this report, we perform side-by-side comparisons of Mcm4,6,7 with E. coli DnaB under identical conditions to compare Mcm4,6,7 to DnaB action. DnaB also unwinds the forked DNA duplex in Fig. 2A (top right gel). The total extent of DnaB unwinding is not as great as with Mcm4,6,7, in part because DnaB is optimally active in unwinding at higher pH (31.Kaplan D.L. Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6889-6897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mcm4,6,7 unwinding is inhibited by pre-incubation with Mcm2p (Fig. 2A, bottom left gel), consistent with previous studies (8.Lee J.-K. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18871-18878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 9.You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Unwinding is not inhibited by the buffer solution that Mcm2p is stored in, showing that the inhibition is due to the Mcm2p protein, and not by salt or other solution components. Incubation of Mcm4,6,7 with ATP or dATP yields product, but no product is observed when Mcm4,6,7 is incubated with AMP-PNP, ADP, or no nucleotide (Fig. 2A, bottom middle graph). Thus, the protein complex requires a hydrolyzable NTP or dNTP to unwind DNA, consistent with the energy requirement of an active helicase and with other studies (7.Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 8.Lee J.-K. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18871-18878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To determine whether AMP-PNP is bound to the active site in the experiment described above, we incubated the forked substrate with Mcm4,6,7, ATP (fixed concentration), and increasing amounts of AMP-PNP (Fig. 2A, bottom right gel). AMP-PNP inhibits unwinding in a concentration-dependent manner (lanes 2 and 3). AMP-PNP may be inhibiting unwinding by competing for Mg2+. Thus, the experiment was also conducted with additional Mg+ to compensate for the increased AMP-PNP (Mg2+ added in a 1:1 molar ratio with additional AMP-PNP). Again, AMP-PNP inhibited unwinding in a concentration-dependent manner (lanes 4 and 5), suggesting that AMP-PNP is competing directly with ATP. Taken together, the data suggest that Mcm4,6,7 requires NTP hydrolysis for unwinding. Mcm4,6,7 Requires Two Single-stranded Extensions (“Tails”) for Unwinding—Processive unwinding catalyzed by Mcm4,6,7 from S. pombe requires a DNA substrate that bears two single-stranded tail extensions, called a “forked” DNA substrate (25.Lee J.-K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Next we examined Mcm4,6,7 from S. cerevisiae for activity on DNA substrates bearing either a 5′ and 3′ tail (fork) or only a 3′ tail or 5′ tail (Fig. 2B). Mcm4,6,7 requires a forked structure for activity, consistent with the previous study (25.Lee J.-K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). DnaB also shares this same dependence for a fork, as illustrated in Fig. 2B, and described previously (29.LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Kaplan D.L. Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6889-6897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mcm4,6,7 Binds to the 3′ Tail, not the 5′ Tail during Unwinding—The observation that a forked DNA structure is required for processive Mcm4,6,7 unwinding, combined with data indicating that as many as two Mcm4,6,7 complexes may bind to forked DNA, led to the previous model shown in Fig. 1A (24.Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 148-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25.Lee J.-K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In this model, two Mcm4,6,7 rings bind to the two DNA tails for processive unwinding. To test this model, we replaced each single-stranded DNA tail extension with a biotin-streptavidin group (Fig. 3A). Replacement of the 5′ tail with biotin/streptavidin stimulated unwinding, suggesting that Mcm4,6,7 does not need to bind to the 5′ tail during unwinding. Replacement of the 3′ tail with biotin/streptavidin completely abolished activity, suggesting that Mcm4,6,7 binds to the 3′ tail during unwinding. Thus, Mcm4,6,7 binds to the 3′ tail and does not need to bind a 5′ tail for unwinding. Since Mcm4,6,7 typically requires a forked DNA for activity, it would appear that the biotin/streptavidin moiety can substitute for the 5′ tail. It will be demonstrated below that the 5′ tail acts as a steric factor to stimulate Mcm4,6,7 unwinding. For comparison, DnaB unwinding was abolished by replacement of the 5′ tail with biotin/streptavidin, whereas activity was stimulated by replacement of the 3′ tail with biotin/streptavidin. These data suggest that DnaB binds to the 5′ tail, but not the 3′ tail, during unwinding, as previously proposed (28.Kaplan D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). DnaB, like MCM4,6,7, was more active on the substrate containing a biotin/streptavidin in place of an ssDNA tail (except on the 3′ instead of the 5′ end). Mcm4,6,7 Unwinds DNA with 3′ to 5′ Polarity—The polarity of Mcm4,6,7 from human and S. pombe has been examined previously using a long ssDNA substrate with a short duplex region on either end and determining which duplex end was unwound. These studies indicated that Mcm4,6,7 unwinds DNA 3′ to 5′ (7.Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 8.Lee J.-K. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18871-18878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, later studies demonstrated that processive unwinding requires a forked structure, in which case unwinding may occur with either 3′ to 5′ or 5′ to 3′ polarity (25.Lee J.-K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3B, we examined the polarity of Mcm4,6,7 unwinding using a different system. Forked DNA substrates were constructed that have “reverse polarity” linkages on one or the other ssDNA tail. To reverse the polarity of the 3′ tail, a 3′-3′ connection was incorporated at the junction of single- and double-stranded DNA. This generates a DNA substrate with two 5′ tails. To reverse the polarity of the 5′ tail, a 5′ to 5′ connection was incorporated at the single-stranded/double-stranded DNA junction, thus making a DNA substrate with two 3′ tails. We also reversed the polarity of both tails to produce a DNA substrate with a 5′ tail and a 3′ tail, but the polarity of both strands reverses at the duplex junction. Mcm4,6,7 is active on the substrate with two 3′ tails, but not on the substrate with two 5′ tails. This confirms that Mcm4,6,7 unwinds DNA with 3′ to 5′ polarity. It also confirms that Mcm4,6,7 is insensitive to the chemistry of the 5′ tail, since it can be flipped around backward with no substantial loss in activity. As one might expect, Mcm4,6,7 cannot unwind the DNA with two reverse tails. This shows that the protein recognizes the polarity of the DNA strand to which it is bound during binding and unwinding. It also demonstrates that the protein cannot switch strands during the course of the reaction. DnaB unwinds the substrate with two 5′ tails but not two 3′ tails or two reverse tails. This is consistent with the known 5′ to 3′ polarity of DnaB and further supports the conclusion that Mcm4,6,7 has opposite polarity to that of DnaB. The 3′ Tail Passes through the Central Channel of Mcm4,6,7 during Unwinding, whereas the 5′ Tail Is Sterically Excluded— For DnaB, the 5′ tail passes through the central channel during unwinding, whereas the 3′ tail passes on the outside of the protein because it is sterically excluded from the central channel. The polarity of unwinding for Mcm4,6,7 is opposite to that of DnaB. Thus, if the mechanism of unwinding is similar for these two ring-shaped helicases except for the reversal of polarity, one would expect the 3′ tail to pass through the central channel of Mcm4,6,7, whereas the 5′ tail is sterically excluded from entering the central channel. To test this prediction, we used biotin/streptavidin as a steric block. The diameter of streptavidin is ∼45 Å, which is likely to be larger than the central channel of Mcm4,6,7. Thus, streptavidin bound to a DNA strand should prevent it from passing through the central channel of Mcm4,6,7, and movement should be blocked. In contrast, when streptavidin is bound to the DNA strand that passes on the outside of the Mcm4,6,7 ring, activity should not be inhibited. In the experiment in Fig. 3C, a dT was replaced with a biotin-dT within the duplex region of the test strand, and then excess streptavidin was added to the reaction to create a steric block. Biotin-dT pairs with dA on the complementary strand and has a spacer arm connecting biotin to dT. When biotin-dT/streptavidin is present on the strand bearing the 3′ tail, Mcm4,6,7 activity is abolished. However, when biotin-dT/streptavidin is present on the strand bearing the 5′ tail, activity is slightly stimulated. Thus, the tail bearing the 3′ tail probably passes through the central channel of Mcm4,6,7, whereas the strand bearing the 5′ tail passes on the outside of the protein. As a control, biotin/streptavidin blocks DnaB when it is positioned on the strand bearing the 5′ tail but not the 3′ tail (Fig. 3C). This is consistent with previous studies of Thermus aquaticus DnaB showing that the strand bearing the 5′ tail, but not the 3′ tail, passes through the central channel of the protein during unwinding (28.Kaplan D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). There is some weak unwinding activity when biotin/streptavidin is positioned on the strand bearing the 5′ tail, probably because the protein has some abil"

The acidic environment of the endosome triggers a membrane fusion reaction that is mediated by the E1 glycoprotein. During fusion, E1 rearranges from an E1/E2 heterodimer to a highly stable, membrane-inserted E1 homotrimer (E1HT). In this study, we analyzed E1HT by a combination of electron cryomicroscopy, electron crystallography of negatively stained 2D crystals, and fitting of the available X-ray structure of the monomeric E1 ectodomain into the resulting 3D reconstruction. The visualized E1HT reveals that the ectodomain has reoriented vertically and inserted the distal tip of domain II into the lipid bilayer. Our data allow the visualization of a viral fusion protein inserted in its target membrane and demonstrate that insertion is a cooperative process, resulting in rings composed of five to six homotrimers."

Although all Plasmodium SERA enzyme domain sequences share considerable homology, phylogenetic studies revealed two distinct clusters across the genus, separated according to whether they possess an active site serine or cysteine. All Plasmodia appear to have at least one member of each group. Consistent with separate biological roles for members of these two clusters, molecular modeling studies revealed that SERA5 and SERA6 enzyme domains have dramatically different surface properties, although both have a characteristic papain-like fold, catalytic cleft, and an appropriately positioned catalytic triad.

SERA5 is expressed at much greater levels than other family members and is indeed highly abundant generally.

Mitamura T. Horii T. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1821-1827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that SERA5 plays a key role in egress and/or invasion of merozoites into host erythrocytes. All SERA proteins possess a central domain that shows strong homology to the papain family of cysteine proteases. However, some SERAs, including P. falciparum SERA5, have a serine substituted in place of the active site cysteine residue (2Bzik D.J. Li W.B. Horii T. Inselburg J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 30: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 6Kiefer M.C. Crawford K.A. Boley L.J. Landsberg K.E. Gibson H.L. Kaslow D.C. Barr P.J. Mol. Biochem.

In P. falciparum, six of the nine SERAs have an active site serine (SERA1–5 and SERA9), whereas the other three have an active site cysteine. This non-conventional substitution has led to questions as to whether SERAs with an active site serine retain enzymic function (6Kiefer M.C. Crawford K.A. Boley L.J. Landsberg K.E. Gibson H.L. Kaslow D.C. Barr P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this study, we have expressed and re-natured a recombinant form of the SERA5 protease-like domain. This protein cleaved substrates downstream of aromatic residues and demonstrated autolytic activity that was reversible with a serine protease inhibitor providing the first indication that this protein has retained proteolytic activity. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the cysteine to serine substitution predates speciation and that the current SERA family is separated into two distinct phylogenetic groups possessing either SERA5-like (active site serine) or SERA6-like (active site cysteine) enzyme domains. Molecular modeling further supported the notion of distinct proteolytic roles for the enzyme domains of SERA5 and SERA6. Expression, Purification, and Folding of SERA 5PE—The enzyme domain of SERA5 was amplified from P. falciparum (D10) genomic DNA using the oligonucleotides: 5′-GGCGCGGATCCACAGAAGATGATGATGAAGATGATTATACTG-3′ and 5′-GGCCGCTCGAGCTAATTATTCATAGGTAAATCAACATTGAATATAAC-3′. PCR products were digested with BamHI and XhoI (underlined above), ligated into pPROEXHTb (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 cells (Stratagene, CA). Washed inclusion bodies were solubilized in 6 m guanidine-HCl/250 mm NaCl/10 mm imidazole/20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, buffer containing 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The solution was clarified by filtration through a 1-μm glass filter (Pall-Gelman, Ann Arbor, MI) then incubated in batch mode overnight with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Ni-NTA) resin (Qiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany). After washes (10 column volumes each) with 6 m guanidine-HCl/250 mm NaCl/20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 8 m urea/250 mm NaCl/20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, the bound 5PE was eluted with 8 m urea/1 m imidazole/20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The Ni-NTA-purified 5PE was refolded by dilution into 2 m urea/100 mm NaCl/20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm reduced glutathione and 0.25 mm oxidized glutathione. The refolded protein was concentrated and purified by anion-exchange chromatography. Bound protein was eluted from a 1-ml Hitrap Q strong anion-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) using a linear gradient from 1% to 100% buffer B over 30 min at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Buffer A comprised 20 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.50, and buffer B comprised 1 m NaCl and 20 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.50. All solvents were 0.22-μm-filtered prior to use. Gel permeation chromatography was used as a final polishing step to remove traces of aggregate. A Hiload 16/60 Superdex 200 preparative column (Amersham Biosciences) was used throughout. Gel permeation chromatography was performed using 500 mm NaCl/50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.50 buffer. Gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA) were used to construct a calibration curve for the subsequent determination of the relative molecular weight of sera 5PE. Reversed-phase HPLC—Reversed-phase HPLC was performed using a Hewlett-Packard (Waldbronn, Germany) 1050 modular HPLC. Buffer A comprised 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (HPLC/Spectro grade, Pierce, Rockford, IL) in Milli-Q grade water (Millipore, Bedford, MA); buffer B comprised 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (ChromAR HPLC grade, Malinckrodt, Paris, KY) in Milli-Q grade water. Aliquots from the refold mixture were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C prior to loading onto a C8 column (2.1-mm inner diameter × 100-mm (Brownlee) columns, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Norwalk, CT) in the presence of buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of 0–100% B over 12 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting of Parasite Proteins—Parasite cultures were synchronized by treatments with sorbitol then enriched by Percoll purification. The parasitized erythrocytes were washed in phosphate-buffered saline then placed into sample buffer with or without β-mercaptoethanol prior to snap freezing and storage at -70 °C. Parasite proteins were fractionated on 10% discontinuous gels and were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotting was performed using procedures described previously (14Hodder A.N. Crewther P.E. Anders R.F. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3286-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Limited Proteolysis—A 5 mg/ml solution of Elastase (porcine pancreas, Roche Applied Science) in 50% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Tris, pH 8.25, was diluted progressively in a 3-fold series using a stock solution of 300 mm NaCl/60 mm Tris, pH 8.25. To each 5-μl aliquot of enzyme from the dilution series was added 5 μg of 5PE in 10 μl (total vol. = 15 μl). The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, placed immediately into an ice bath before fractionation by SDS-PAGE. To identify the major fragments generated by limited proteolysis, the procedure was scaled up 5-fold, and elastase concentrations of 1.6 and 0.06 mg/ml were used to generate 5PEb and 5PEa plus 5PEb, respectively. These reactions were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Further elastase activity was inhibited by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a 2 mm final concentration. Fragments of SERA 5PE were purified by RP-HPLC as described above except that a gradient profile of 0–24 min, 0–100%B at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min was used. The 5PEa and 5PEb elastase fragments co-eluted using these RP-HPLC conditions. Disulfide Bond Determination—Disulfide-linked peptides were identified by comparing the RP-HPLC chromatographic profiles for dithiothreitol-reduced and non-reduced tryptic digests of SERA 5PE, in a manner similar to that described previously (15Hodder A. Crewther P. Matthew M. Reid G. Moritz R. Simpson R. Anders R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29446-29452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). A preparative run using 60 μg of tryptic digest was then fractionated under identical chromatographic conditions, and the peaks identified as containing disulfide-linked peptides were subjected to Edman sequencing for identification. RP-HPLC was performed as described above, however, a Vydac (The Nest Group, Southborough, MA) C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm inner diameter) was used throughout, and the elution profile was 0–25 min, 0% B, 25–115 min, 0–60% B, 115–120 min, 100% B. Fractions were collected manually at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. N-terminal Sequence Analysis—N-terminal sequence analyses were performed using a Hewlett-Packard biphasic N-terminal protein sequencer (Model G1005A, Hewlett-Packard) using version 3.0 chemistry as described previously (16Moritz R.L. Eddes J.S. Reid G.E. Simpson R.J. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 907-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Electrospray Mass Spectrometry—On-line mass spectrometric analysis of 5PE preparations was performed using a Micromass QTof2 hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with a nanoelectrospray ionization source. Multiply charged mass spectra obtained were processed using MaxEnt 1 built into the MassLynx software package to obtain parent molecular weights (Micromass, UK) Zymograms—Samples were separated in 12% discontinuous SDS-PAGE gels with or without the presence of 0.4% (w/v) Bloom 300 gelatin (Sigma). Gels were rinsed in water and incubated for 30 s in 10% (v/v) acetic acid, rinsed again in water, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. Gels were left overnight at 37 °C in 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 7.5, buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2. Protein bands were visualized after the staining of gels with a solution of Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad). Enzyme Solution Assays—Solution assays were performed in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH7.5, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. The fluorescent substrates Succinyl-AAPF-4-amino-7-methyl coumarin (Suc-AAPFAMC) and Suc-LLVY-AMC were obtained from a commercial source (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). Stock substrate solutions (1 mm in Me2SO) were diluted to 10 μm in the above buffer. Fluorescence readings were taken every 90 s over a 2-h period using an excitation wavelength of 370 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Molecular Modeling—A three-dimensional model was first constructed for the putative enzyme domain of P. falciparum SERA6. To select the most appropriate structural template, this sequence was threaded against a data base of 4258 structural templates using the fold recognition module of the program ProCeryon (17Flockner H. Braxenthaler M. Lackner P. Jaritz M. Ortner M. Sippl M. Proteins. 1995; 23: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Default values were used for the gap opening and gap extension penalty parameters. The program Modeler (18Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar), which builds homology models from the satisfaction of spatial restraints derived from the alignment of the target with the template, as implemented within the InsightII (version 98.0) Homology software package (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA), was used to construct the homology model. Twenty structural models of SERA6 enzyme were built using the following parameter values or options: library_schedule of 1, max_var_iterations of 500, md_level of “refine1′,” repeat_optimization of 2, and max_molpdf of 106. The sub-routine “special_patches” was used to constrain the formation of disulfide bonds absent in the template. The model with the lowest value of the Modeler objective function (i.e. -1.0xln (molecular probability density function)) was selected as the best model structure. The structural and stereochemical quality of this model was checked and confirmed with the programs PROSAII version 3.0 (19Sippl M. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar), Profiles-3D (20Luethy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2616) Google Scholar), and PROCHECK version 3.5 (21Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). For example, ProsaII gave a total Z-score of -7.64 for the best SERA6 model compared with -9.86 for the template structure Caricain. The same approach was subsequently used to model the enzyme domain of SERA5, which gave a ProsaII Z-score of -7.01. Phylogenetic Analysis—Sequences for 28 presumptive SERA enzyme domains were obtained from the Plasmodium data base (www.PlasmoDB.org) and aligned using ClustalW, with default parameters (22Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56003) Google Scholar). P. falciparum SERA8, a suspected pseudogene (9Miller S.K. Good R.T. Drew D.R. Delorenzi M. Sanders P.R. Hodder A.N. Speed T.P. Cowman A.F. de Koning-Ward T.F. Crabb B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47524-47532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), was excluded from the analysis. Initially, pairwise distances were computed as maximum likelihood estimates of the expected number of substitutions per site, under the Dayhoff PAM matrix substitution model. These distances were calculated with PROTDIST, and trees were constructed with the neighbor-joining algorithm as implemented in NEIGHBOR, both in the PHYLIP package (23Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar, 24Felsenstein J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 418-427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The trees were bootstrapped, and the input order of the sequences was randomized in the process. Subsequent comparison of the resulting unrooted gene tree with hypothesized evolutionary relationships among the six Plasmodium species produced a list of implied speciation, duplication, and deletion events. Rooting the gene tree (see below) and selecting two alternative configurations over two low confidence internal edges in the original neighbor-joining tree dramatically reduced the number of duplication and, in particular, deletion events required to reconcile the gene and species trees. 3R. Bourgon, M. Delorenzi, A. N. Hodder, B. S. Crabb, and T. P. Speed, manuscript in preparation. Expression and Refolding of the Enzyme Domain of P. falciparum SERA5—To determine if the SERA5 enzyme domain possessed proteolytic activity, we expressed most of the 50-kDa fragment in E. coli (Fig. 1). The N terminus of 5PE is the same as the native 50-kDa species (11Debrabant A. Maes P. Delplace P. Dubremetz J.F. Tartar A. Camus D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 53: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), whereas the location of the C terminus of 5PE was based on sequence alignments and the known termini of numerous other papain family proteases. These alignments were also used to predict the location of the N terminus of the enzyme domain 187 residues downstream from the beginning of 5PE (Fig. 1). E. coli-expressed 5PE was deposited exclusively as insoluble inclusion bodies (Fig. 2A). These were solubilized under reducing and denaturing conditions and purified by Ni-NTA-agarose chromatography (Fig. 2A). 5PE was then refolded in vitro by dilution into refolding buffer in the presence of a glutathione redox pair. Refolding was monitored by RP-HPLC until the majority of the starting material had converted to an earliereluting, Gaussian-shaped peak (Fig. 2B), consistent with appropriate internalization of hydrophobic groups. Refolded SERA 5PE was further purified using one or more chromatographic steps. The observed differential migration under reduced versus non-reduced SDS-PAGE supports the existence of a disulfide bond-stabilized conformation within the refolded SERA 5PE (Fig. 2, A and C). Also consistent with appropriate refolding: only 5PE that was refolded and not exposed to reducing agent, either prior to or during electrophoresis, reacted strongly with IgG from malaria-immune donors, which recognizes native SERA5 epitopes (Fig. 2C, lane 6). By gel filtration chromatography, the vast majority of the refolded 5PE appeared to be monomeric with a molecular mass determined from the calibration curve estimated at 49,545 Da, consistent with the calculated mass of 54,150 Da (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Re-folded 5PE is predominantly monomeric. A preparative gel filtration plot (part of the purification process) showing the major peak eluting at a retention time consistent with a molecular weight of ∼50 kDa (circled on a standard curve). The molecular weight standards used were thyroglobulin (Mr 670,000), bovine gamma globulin (Mr 158,000), chicken ovalbumin (Mr 44,000), equine myoglobulin (Mr 17,000), and vitamin B12 (Mr 1,350) numbered 1 to 5, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Limited proteolysis with elastase was used to investigate the structural stability of refolded 5PE. Treatment with different concentrations of elastase revealed a moderately stable and a highly stable fragment termed 5PEa and 5PEb, respectively (Fig. 4A). The identities of these species, presumed to represent tightly folded, homogeneous species, were determined using a combination of Edman degradation and mass spectrometry on RP-HPLC-purified products (15Hodder A. Crewther P. Matthew M. Reid G. Moritz R. Simpson R. Anders R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29446-29452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Both fragments correspond to the full putative protease domain with a small N-terminal extension of either 32 (5PEa) or 20 (5PEb) amino acids and no processing at the C terminus (Fig. 4, B–E, and see Fig. 1B). Only very slight variations were observed, and the predicted masses for all fragments (including 5PE itself) perhaps reflected differences in the oxidative state of the numerous internal methionine residues within these fragments. Studies on the structures of zymogens have shown the Pro-sequences of some of these proteases prevent premature activity by inserting into the catalytic cleft of the enzyme domain (25Coll M. Guasch A. Aviles F. Huber R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 26Cygler M. Sivaraman J. Grochulski P. Coulombe R. Storer A. Mort J. Structure. 1996; 4: 405-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It is possible that the C-terminal region of the SERA5 Pro domain associates with the catalytic cleft and is held in position via a hairpin loop that is stabilized by a disulfide bond between cysteine residues 3 and 4. Both disulfide linkages found in the Pro region of 5PE were determined by disulfide-mapping techniques as described elsewhere (15Hodder A. Crewther P. Matthew M. Reid G. Moritz R. Simpson R. Anders R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29446-29452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). Tryptic digestion of the refolded 5PE revealed two disulfide-linked peptides, which were purified by RP-HPLC. Edman degradation of these peptides established a disulfide-linkage between C1 and C2 and between C3 and C4 (Fig. 5). Providing support for the hypothesis that the C terminus of the Pro domain associates with the catalytic cleft is the finding that SERA 5PE undergoes autolytic breakdown upon storage to generate a stable species of similar molecular weight to the highly elastase-resistant 5PEb species (see below). This species, termed 5PEc, was shown by Edman sequencing/mass spectrometry to comprise the protease domain with an N-terminal extension of 18 amino acids (Fig. 4, B and F, and see Fig. 1B).Fig. 5Determination of disulfide bonds in the SERA5 Pro domain.A, RP-HPLC of 5PE tryptic digest. Expanded regions of the chromatogram are shown for identification of the peaks containing disulfide-linked tryptic peptides (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). B, Edman degradation results determined for the peptides found in peaks 1 and 2 of the tryptic digest. C, schematic of the disulfide connectivity pattern for 5PE. The solid lines portray connectivities determined via biochemical techniques, whereas the bonds in the enzyme domain depicted with broken lines were predicted by modeling (see Fig. 9).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further test if 5PE resembled the native SERA5 50/56-kDa domain, polyclonal rabbit antisera and a panel of mouse polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were raised to this recombinant protein.

Although the winged helix fold is often found in DNA-binding proteins, we show that TFE is not a typical DNA-binding winged helix protein, because its putative DNA-binding face shows a negatively charged groove and an unusually long wing, and because the domain lacks DNA-binding activity in vitro.

II requires five general transcription factors, called TFIIB, -D, -E, -F, and -H, to initiate mRNA transcription. The general transcription factors assemble with pol II into a large initiation complex on promoter DNA (1Kornberg R.D.

According to in vitro reconstitution experiments, initiation complex assembly starts with recognition of the promoter DNA by TFIID (4Buratowski S. Hahn S. Guarente L. Sharp P.A.

The TFIID subunit TATA box-binding protein (TBP) binds to the TATA box, a frequently occurring promoter element located about 30 bp upstream of the transcription start site. The TBP·DNA complex is stabilized by specific binding of TFIIB to TBP and to promoter DNA sequences adjacent to the TATA box (6Lagrange T. Kapanidis A.N. Tang H. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The TBP·TFIIB·DNA complex can be further stabilized by binding of the optional factor TFIIA.

Biochem. 1997; 122: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Binding of TFIIE to the pol II complex apparently recruits TFIIH (29Maxon M.E. Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). TFIIH contains helicase activities that unwind DNA and form a transcription bubble (30Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.M.

TFIIH also comprises a kinase that phosphorylates the pol II C-terminal repeat domain during the transition from initiation to elongation. Both enzymatic activities of TFIIH are stimulated by TFIIE (32Ohkuma Y. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1994; 368: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In keeping with a role of TFIIE as a bridging factor between pol II and TFIIH, TFIIE has been shown to bind to pol II and to TFIIH (29Maxon M.E. Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest a role of TFIIE in promoter DNA binding and melting. First, TFIIE can bind single-stranded DNA (33Kuldell N.H. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5288-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Second, TFIIE function is influenced by the helical stability of promoter DNA, and the requirement for TFIIE during initiation can be bypassed by premelted promoter sequences (34Holstege F.C.P. Tantin D. Carey M. van der Vliet P.C. Timmers H.T.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 810-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Finally, site-specific cross-linking located TFIIE near DNA around the active center of pol II. One study observed cross-linking of TFIIE to DNA within the transcription bubble and just downstream of it (35Kim T.K. Ebright R.H. Reinberg D. Science. 2000; 288: 1418-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Another cross-linking study located TFIIE adjacent to promoter DNA just upstream of the transcription start site (36Robert F. Forget D. Li J. Greenblatt J. Coulombe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8517-8520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). TFIIE consists of a large and a small subunit, referred to as α and β, respectively, in higher eukaryotes. From N to C termini, the TFIIEβ sequence shows a serine-rich region with little predicted secondary structure, a region with sequence similarity to a DNA-binding domain in the small TFIIF subunit, a region with similarity to the bacterial σ factor, and a presumably helical region with clusters of basic residues. NMR has shown that the TFIIEβ region with homology to TFIIF forms a winged helix domain (37Okuda M. Watanabe Y. Hashimoto Okamura H. Hanaoka F. Ohkuma Y. Nishimura Y. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1346-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structural information on TFIIEα is, however, lacking. The C-terminal half of TFIIEα is likely unstructured and is dispensable for yeast viability (33Kuldell N.H. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5288-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, the N-terminal half of TFIIEα is essential for cell growth (33Kuldell N.H. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5288-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and contains a leucine-rich region with weak sequence similarity to the bacterial σ factor, followed by a zinc-binding domain (38Ohkuma Y. Hashimoto S. Hoffmann A. Shimasaki S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 398-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In agreement with in vivo data, the N-terminal half of TFIIEα is required for basal and activated transcription in vitro (39Ohkuma Y. Hashimoto S. Wang C.K. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4856-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and interacts with TBP and pol II (29Maxon M.E. Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Archaea contain a TFIIE homolog, called TFE, that corresponds to the essential N-terminal half of TFIIEα (40Hanzelka B.L. Darcy T.J. Reeve J.N. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1813-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 41Bell S.D. Brinkman A.B. van der Oost J. Jackson S.P. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Also found in archaea are homologs of TBP and TFIIB, but not of TFIIF and TFIIH (42Bell S.D. Magill C.P. Jackson S.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Whereas the archaeal TBP and TFIIB homologs are essential for transcription initiation, TFE is not absolutely required but stimulates transcription in vitro (40Hanzelka B.L. Darcy T.J. Reeve J.N. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1813-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 41Bell S.D. Brinkman A.B. van der Oost J. Jackson S.P. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Because mutagenesis of the TATA box or low concentrations of TBP sensitize a promoter to TFE in vitro, TFE apparently stabilizes the archaeal TBP·DNA complex (41Bell S.D. Brinkman A.B. van der Oost J. Jackson S.P. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). TFE also interacts directly with archaeal TBP and RNA polymerase (41Bell S.D. Brinkman A.B. van der Oost J. Jackson S.P. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here we have defined and crystallized the N-terminal domain of TFE from the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus. X-ray analysis reveals that this domain adopts an extended winged helix fold with unusual features. Analysis of surface properties, comparisons with other winged helix domains, and biochemical data suggest that the function of the TFE winged helix domain is not primarily DNA binding. The available data are, however, consistent with a role of this domain as an adapter between RNA polymerase and general transcription factors. Cloning and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The TFE DNA fragments TFEΔC and TFEΔΔC, which encode for TFE residues 1–110 and 1–97, respectively, were subcloned using as template DNA pET-ssTFE, which encodes for full-length S. solfataricus TFE (41Bell S.D. Brinkman A.B. van der Oost J. Jackson S.P. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Plasmid pET-ssTFE was a generous gift of Stephen Bell. For cloning of fragment TFEΔΔC, oligonucleotide primers TFEf1 (5′-TATATCATATGATGGTTAACGCAGAGGATCTGTTTA-3′) and TFEr1 (5′-TATCTGCGGCCGCTAATCTTTTCCTATTTAACAG-3′) were used in PCR amplification. Primer TFEf1 adds an NdeI restriction site upstream of the start codon. For amplification of TFE fragment TFEΔC, primer TFEr1 was replaced by TFEr2 (5′-TATCTGCGGCCGCTTTCTCATATTCCAATCTTGTC-3′). Primers TFEr1 and TFEr2 encoded an overhang for a NotI restriction site downstream but did not introduce a stop codon. Ligation of the restriction digested PCR products into pET21b (Novagen) added to the gene codons for a C-terminal hexahistidine tag followed by a stop codon. Cloning was performed according to standard procedures. To introduce additional methionine residues into the polypeptide chain encoded by gene TFEΔC, codons for hydrophobic residues were changed by site-directed mutagenesis using the two-step PCR overlap extension method, as described in a previous study (43Meinhart A. Silberzahn T. Cramer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15917-15921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Several mutant forms of TFEΔC have been constructed, including the single mutant F76M, the double mutant I39M/F76M, and the triple mutant I39M/F62M/F76M. Protein Expression, Selenomethionine Labeling, and Purification—Plasmid-DNA encoding for wild-type TFEΔC or TFEΔΔC protein was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)RIL (Stratagene). Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin and chloramphenicol at concentrations of 100 mg/liter each. Induction was performed during logarithmic growth by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and bacteria were grown for an additional 3.5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). For selenomethionine labeling of TFEΔC mutants F76M, I39M/F76M, and I39M/F62M/F76M, plasmid DNA was transformed into the methionine auxotroph E. coli strain B834(DE3) (Novagen). Bacteria were grown in LB medium with 100 mg/liter ampicillin at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6. Cells were harvested and resuspended in the same amount of New Minimal Medium (44Budisa N. Steipe B. Demange P. Eckerskorn C. Kellermann J. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 788-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), supplemented with selenomethionine and ampicillin at concentrations of 100 mg/liter each. The optical density was measured, and cells were grown until the optical density at λ = 600 nm increased by 0.2 unit, to deplete the cells from any residual methionine from the standard LB medium. Protein expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and cells were grown for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer A. Native and selenomethionine-labeled proteins were purified according to the same procedure. Cells were broken with a French press, and the suspension was clarified by centrifugation. The cleared supernatant was incubated for 20 min at 72 °C, to denature the majority of E. coli proteins. After centrifugation, the cleared lysate was loaded onto a 1-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen), equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 20 ml of buffer A, followed by 4 ml of buffer A containing additionally 40 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole and were judged to be 99% pure by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then applied to a Superose-12 HR gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μm ZnCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol). Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to 15 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were measured using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Whereas TFEΔC and its variants remained soluble during purification, TFEΔΔC was found in the insoluble pellet after centrifugation. Crystallization and Data Collection—Purified protein samples were subjected to commercial crystal screens (Hampton Research) using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. In initial screens, TFEΔC formed large clusters of thin needles within a week under three different conditions. The reservoir solutions were (i) 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 200 mm LiSO4, 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000, (ii) 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 200 mm NaOAc, 30% (w/v) PEG4000, and (iii) 20% (v/v) ethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol. Optimization around the second condition yielded thicker needles (smallest dimension, 30 μm). Removal of the hexahistidine tag did not improve crystal quality. Exchange of PEG4000 in the reservoir solution by PEG1000 resulted in very large, cigar-shaped single crystals (smallest dimension, ≤200 μm). Crystals of selenomethionine-labeled proteins were grown under the same conditions. Crystals were harvested in mother liquor and were transferred to a solution containing additionally 15% (v/v) PEG400. Crystals were incubated for 10 min, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored for data collection at the synchrotron. Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) experiments were performed on crystals from selenomethionine-labeled proteins. X-ray diffraction data from protein crystals of native TFEΔC and selenomethionine-labeled TFEΔC variant I39M/F76M were collected at the Swiss Light Source (Table I). Further MAD experiments on protein crystals of TFEΔC variants F76M and I39M/F62M/F76M were performed at beam line ID14-4 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble (Table I).Table ICrystal structure determinationCrystalTFE triple mutant I39M/F62M/F76M (SeMet MAD)TFE wild type (native)Data collectionaMutant MAD data were processed with XDS (46); native data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (45) Synchrotron sourceESRF ID14—4SLS X06SA Space groupP6122P6122 Unit cell axes (Å)a1 = 67.0, c = 91.4a1 = 66.1, c = 92.7 Wavelength (Å)0.9792 (peak)0.9795 (inflection)0.9337 (remote)0.9793 Resolution (Å)20—3.0 (3.18—3.0)20—3.0 (3.18—3.0)20—3.0 (3.18—3.0)20—2.9 (3.0—2.9) Completeness (%)99.2 (98.9)95.1 (96.1)94.3 (92.2)98.7 (100) Unique reflections2692 (408)2605(404)2610 (391)3025 (292) Anomalous unique reflections4568 (721)4370 (699)4382 (676) Redundancy11.37.97.99.1 Rsym (%)6.4 (18.2)5.8 (23.2)6.1 (31.4)7.7 (28.5) 〈I/σI〉24.0 (14.0)20.8 (9.4)19.4 (6.0)19.2 (9.1)bCalculated with the CCP4 program TRUNCATE f′cCalculated with the CCP4 program CHOOCH for peak and inflection data sets, estimated for the remote data set—7.9—10—2.8 f″cCalculated with the CCP4 program CHOOCH for peak and inflection data sets, estimated for the remote data set5.23.23.64MAD phasingdMAD phasing statistics were calculated with program SOLVE (47, 48) Number of Se sites4 Z-score23.5 Mean figure of merit0.55RefinementeRefinement statistics were calculated with program CNS (52) Resolution range (Å)6.5—3.06.5—2.9 Rcryst (%)32.031.5 Rfree (%)31.832.1 Number of residues8285a Mutant MAD data were processed with XDS (46Kabsch W.

Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). MAD data from protein crystals of variant I39M/F62M/F76M were reduced using the program XDS (46Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). Selenium sites were found by using the program SOLVE (47Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1937-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 48Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The obtained selenium sites were used in phasing with SHARP (50de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar) and were refined with RESOLVE (47Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1937-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 48Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar) with automated model building turned off. Additional methionines were introduced at positions of conserved hydrophobic residues, some of which are methionines in TFE homologs. After introduction of one methionine in addition to the natural M1 and M34 (TFEΔC variant F76M), we could consistently identify two selenium peaks with SnB, but no interpretable electron density was obtained after refinement with SHARP. Structure determination was tried in both enantiomorphic space groups (P6122 and P6522). Introduction of a second additional methionine (double mutant I39M/F76M) and further MAD experiments led to the detection of three selenium peaks by SnB and SOLVE (Z-score 13.3), of which two matched the peaks in variant F76M. After phasing with SHARP, a noisy electron density was obtained that showed segments of α-helices. However, no continuous Cα trace could be built into this density. Finally, a third additional methionine was introduced. MAD data from crystals of the triple mutant I39M/F62M/F76M gave rise to an additional selenium peak but still resulted in a poor electron density map. The known three selenium sites could be identified, the Z-score increased to 23.5 (mean figure of merit = 0.55, CCNat. Fourier = 0.17), and the electron density improved dramatically. However, a fourth selenium site was still missing, and no continuous Cα trace could be built into the density. A breakthrough was achieved when a fourth selenium site was identified with SHARP, and the obtained phases were further improved with RESOLVE. The resulting electron density, in combination with the selenium atom positions used as sequence markers, allowed for building of an atomic model with program O (51Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) that included TFE residues 3–88 except residues 70–72 in a flexible loop region (Fig. 1). After one round of refinement against the remote dataset, the initial model was repositioned and reoriented in the slightly different unit cell of the native crystal by rigid body refinement with CNS (52Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). After positional and B factor refinement, model-phased maps allowed for building of the N-terminal residues 1–2, but still there was no electron density observed for the flexible residues 70–72 and for the C-terminal region. Several cycles of model rebuilding and refinement with CNS were performed. Refinement by simulated annealing was used in the beginning, but later only positional refinement was carried out. Before each refinement cycle, all atomic temperature factors were set to 50 Å2 and were refined again before calculation of a new electron density map. During refinement, the automated solvent correction in CNS failed, most likely due to the high Rsym values at low resolution. We therefore used only data in the resolution range 6.5–2.9 Å during refinement. The model refinement converged with a free R factor of 32.1% (33.9% if the problematic low resolution data are included). The relatively high model R factors may be explained by the moderate resolution of our data, a high overall B factor, and by the high percentage of disordered residues (29%). Except residues Val-2 and Trp-75, which have high B factors, all residues fall within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (PDB accession code 1Q1H). To ensure that the relatively high R factors are not due to low quality of the native data set, we have also refined the structure against the remote wavelength of the MAD data set. To this end, the free R factor flags were transferred and three residues were mutated to methionines. Several cycles of slight manual adjustment of the structure and refinement of atomic positions and B factors with CNS quickly converged on a refined model that has very similar R factors (Table I). A superposition of the two refined models revealed that they are essentially identical within the experimental error, except for minor differences around the sites of mutation. DNA-binding Assay—Band shift assays were carried out essentially as in a previous study (53Wilson K.S. Conant C.R. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1179-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified TFEΔC was added to 100 pmol of DNA in a 100- and 200-fold molar excess in buffer TGEM (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 380 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA, 4% (w/v) PEG6000, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 16 mm magnesium acetate). The reaction mixture was incubated at 20 °C for 30 min before 10 μl of sample loading buffer (TGEM with 30% glycerol and bromphenol blue) was added. The mixtures were then separated on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel (95 V for 90 min at 20 °C). The gels were stained with the highly sensitive DNA stain SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands). TFE Contains a Stable N-terminal Domain—The modular and flexible nature of TFIIE has hampered crystallization so far. To obtain structural information for the essential N-terminal region of TFIIEα we turned to the homolog TFE from the archaeon S. solfataricus. Full-length S. solfataricus TFE was expressed in E. coli and purified as described (41Bell S.D. Brinkman A.B. van der Oost J. Jackson S.P. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), with minor modifications (see “Experimental Procedures”). Because initial crystallization screens with the full-length protein were unsuccessful, we conducted partial proteolysis of purified TFE with four proteases of different specificity (trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, and subtilisin). These experiments always resulted in a stable N-terminal fragment (verified by Edman sequencing, not shown), which lacks a C-terminal region that includes a potential zinc-binding domain that is apparently not well structured in S. solfataricus TFE (Fig. 2A). Although binding of zinc ions by this domain is essential for function of TFE (40Hanzelka B.L. Darcy T.J. Reeve J.N. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1813-1818Crossref PubMed Scop"

https://openalex.org/W1969434750,"The S. cerevisiae SCFCdc4 is a prototype of RING-type SCF E3s, which recruit substrates for polyubiquitination by the Cdc34 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Current models propose that Cdc34 ubiquitinates the substrate while remaining bound to the RING domain. In contrast, we found that the formation of a ubiquitin thiol ester regulates the Cdc34/SCFCdc4 binding equilibrium by increasing the dissociation rate constant, with only a minor effect on the association rate. By using a F72VCdc34 mutant with increased affinity for the RING domain, we demonstrate that release of ubiquitin-charged Cdc34-S∼Ub from the RING is essential for ubiquitination of the SCFCdc4-bound substrate Sic1. Release of ubiquitin-charged E2 from E3 prior to ubiquitin transfer is a previously unrecognized step in ubiquitination, which can explain both the modification of multiple lysines on the recruited substrate and the extension of polyubiquitin chains. We discuss implications of this finding for function of other ubiquitin ligases."

https://openalex.org/W2105202657,"<i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> (the pneumococcus) is a major cause of bacterial pneumonia, middle ear infection (otitis media), sepsis, and meningitis. Our previous study demonstrated that the choline-binding protein A (CbpA) of <i>S. pneumoniae</i> binds to the human polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) and enhances pneumococcal adhesion to and invasion of cultured epithelial cells. In this study, we sought to determine the CbpA-binding motif on pIgR by deletional analysis. The extra-cellular portion of pIgR consists of five Ig-like domains (D1–D5), each of which contains 104–114 amino acids and two disulfide bonds. Deletional analysis of human pIgR revealed that the lack of either D3 or D4 resulted in the loss of CbpA binding, whereas complete deletions of domains D1, D2, and D5 had undetectable impacts. Subsequent analysis showed that domains D3 and D4 together were necessary and sufficient for the ligand-binding activity. Furthermore, CbpA binding of pIgR did not appear to require Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Finally, treating pIgR with a reducing agent abolished CbpA binding, suggesting that disulfide bonding is required for the formation of CbpA-binding motif(s). These results strongly suggest a conformational CbpA-binding motif(s) in the D3/D4 region of human pIgR, which is functionally separated from the IgA-binding site(s)."

https://openalex.org/W1980647042,"Ephrins (EFN) are cell-surface ligands of Ephs, the largest family of cell-surface receptor tyrosine kinases. The function of EFNs in the immune system has not been well studied, although some EFNs and Ephs are expressed at high levels on certain leukocytes. We report here that EFNB3 and its receptors (collectively called EFNB3Rs, as EFNB3 binds to multiple EphBs) were expressed in peripheral T cells and monocytes/macrophages, with T cells being the dominant EFNB3+ and EFNB3R+ cell type. Solid-phase EFNB3-Fc in the presence of suboptimal anti-CD3 crosslinking enhanced T-cell responses in terms of proliferation, activation marker expression, interferon-γ but not interleukin-2 production, and cytotoxic T-cell activity. EFNB3R costimulation in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13- acetate was insensitive to cyclosporin A, similar to CD28 costimulation, suggesting they might share a part of the signaling pathway. After crosslinking, T-cell receptor and EFNB3R congregated into aggregated rafts, and this provided a morphological basis for signaling pathways of T-cell receptor and EFNB3R to interact. Solidphase EFNB3-Fc augmented p38 and p44/42 MAPK activation further downstream of the signaling pathway.

EFNB3R costimulation in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13- acetate was insensitive to cyclosporin A, similar to CD28 costimulation, suggesting they might share a part of the signaling pathway. After crosslinking, T-cell receptor and EFNB3R congregated into aggregated rafts, and this provided a morphological basis for signaling pathways of T-cell receptor and EFNB3R to interact. Solidphase EFNB3-Fc augmented p38 and p44/42 MAPK activation further downstream of the signaling pathway. These data suggest that EFNB3 is important in T-cell/T-cell and T-cell/antigen-presenting cell collaboration to enhance T-cell activation and function. Full T-cell activation requires costimulation in addition to T-cell receptor (TCR) 1The abbreviations used are: TCRT-cell receptorEFNephrinPBSphosphate-buffered salineNHIgGnormal human IgGMLRmixed lymphocyte reactionPEphycoerythrinFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateCTLcytotoxic T lymphocyteILinterleukinIFNinterferonmAbmonoclonal antibodyMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinasePMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateCTcholera toxin. ligation. Costimulation can be conferred by cell-surface molecules. For example, the well studied B7.1 and B7.2 are two prototype costimulatory molecules expressed on antigen-presenting cells (1Hathcock K.S. Laszlo G. Pucillo C. Linsley P. Hodes R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Additional members of the B7 family with costimulatory function have been documented recently (2Carreno B.M. Collins M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 29-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Certain cell-surface adhesion molecules (3Sims T.N. Dustin M.L. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 186: 100-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and some membrane-bound tumor necrosis factor family members (4Fotin-Mleczek M. Henkler F. Samel D. Reichwein M. Hausser A.

Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar) are capable of costimulation as well. In general, the costimulation increases the affinity and prolongs the interaction between T cells and antigen-presenting cells; it also allows the integration of costimulation-triggered signaling pathways with that of TCR. As a result, the T-cell response threshold to Ag is reduced, and the response to Ag is enhanced.

Ephrins (EFN) are cell-surface ligands of Eph receptor tyrosine kinases. EFNs are classified into A and B subfamilies; the former consists of six glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane proteins (EFNA1–6), and the latter consists of three transmembrane proteins (EFNB1–3) (6Eph Nomenclature Committee Cell. 1997; 90: 403-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). EFNBs are capable of reverse transmission of signals into cells, although they are ligands (7Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Mbamalu G. Yancopoulos G.D. Henkemeyer M. Pawson T. Nature. 1996; 383: 722-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). EFNAs bind to EphAs with loose specificity, and, likewise, EFNBs bind to EphBs (8Wilkinson D.G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 196: 177-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception of EphA4, which binds both EFNAs and EFNBs (9Gale N.W. Holland S.J. Valenzuela D.M. Flenniken A. Pan L. Ryan T.E.

Because both EFNs and Ephs are cell-surface proteins, they interact with each other in proximity and control cell patterning as well as directional growth. Such functions are well demonstrated in the central nervous system (10Flanagan J.G. Vanderhaeghen P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 309-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar), during angiogenesis (11Wang H.U. Chen Z.F. Anderson D.J.

We have reported previously that EphB6 crosslinking by mAb leads to signal transduction and apoptosis of Jurkat T cells (26Luo H. Wan X. Wu Y. Wu J. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1362-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) as well as to augmentation of normal human T-cell responses (20Luo H. Yu G. Wu Y. Wu J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1141-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Preliminary examination of EphB6-/- mice shows no gross anomaly in the thymic structure and thymocyte populations (21Shimoyama M. Matsuoka H. Tamekane A. Ito M. Iwata N. Inoue R. Chihara K. Furuya A. Hanai N. Matsui T. Growth Factors. 2000; 18: 63-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), suggesting compensatory mechanisms at work. In this study, we investigated the expression of EFNB3 and its receptors in immune cells and explored its function in regulating T-cell activity. In Situ Hybridization—A 522-bp cDNA fragment of mouse EFNB3 cDNA from positions 160 to 681 (accession number AF025288) was fetched with PCR from a mouse embryonic tissue cDNA library and cloned into pGEM-4Z (Invitrogen). The resulting construct, pGEM-4Z-mB3, served to transcribe antisense probes with SP6 RNA polymerase or to transcribe sense probes with T7 RNA polymerase using digoxigenin RNA labeling kits (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, Quebec, Canada). In situ hybridization was carried out according to instructions from the kit manufacturer. Generation of Mouse EFNB3-Fc—The coding sequence of the extracellular domains of mouse EFNB3 from positions 34 to 717 was cloned in-frame upstream of the human IgG1-Fc coding sequence in expression vector pCMVhFc. The constructs and pcDNA3 were then transfected into Chinese hamster ovary/dhfr- cells with LipofectAMINE. The cells were cultured in selection medium (α-minimum Eagle's medium without ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides containing 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 0.01 mm methotrexate, 0.8 mg/ml G418, and 0.1 mg/ml gentamycin). Stably transfected clones were handpicked after 2 weeks of culture. Fusion proteins were isolated from supernatants by protein A columns and verified by N-terminal peptide sequencing (Sheldon Biotechnology Center, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Lymphocyte Preparation and Culture—Cells were flushed out from the BALB/c mouse spleen, and red blood cells were lysed with 0.84% NH4Cl, as described elsewhere (30Chen H. Luo H. Xu D. Loh D.Y. Daloze P.M. Veillette A. Qi S. Wu J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4297-4308PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting cells were referred to as spleen cells. Spleen T cells were purified by deleting mouse IgG (H+L)-positive cells from spleen cells with T-cell columns according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cedarlane, Hornby, Ontario, Canada). In some experiments, CD4 and CD8 cells were positive-selected from the spleen cells by magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. Solid-phase EFNB3 and anti-CD3 were prepared by coating 96-well Costar 3595 plates overnight with anti-mouse CD3 (clone 2C11) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C, followed by incubating EFNB3-Fc or, as a control, normal human IgG (NHIgG) (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL) of different concentrations at 37 °C for 2 h, followed by an additional 2-h incubation on ice. In some experiments, CD4 and CD8 cells were positive-selected from the spleen cells by magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech). For mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), spleen cells from BALB/c mice were treated with mitomycin C and mixed with C57BL/6 spleen cells at a 1:1 ratio (8 × 105 cells at 200 μl/well). The cells were cultured in the presence of NHIgG or Ephs (Eph A4, EphB3, and EphB4; R&D Research, Minneapolis, MN) for 5 days before being harvested. [3H]Thymidine Uptake Assay—Lymphocytes were cultured in 96-well Costar 3595 plates coated with different mAbs, recombinant proteins, or reagents in solution. The cells were pulsed with [3H]thymidine for the last 16 h of culture, and [3H]thymidine uptake was measured, as described previously (31Luo H. Chen H. Daloze P. Chang J.Y. St Louis G. Wu J. Transplantation. 1992; 53: 1071-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometry was employed for the measurement of EFNB3 expression as well as EFNB3R expression in T-cell populations. BALB/c spleen cells were stained with goat anti-EFNB3 (R&D Systems) followed by donkey anti-goat IgG-PE (Cedarlane) or with biotinylated EFNB3-Fc followed by streptavidin-PE. Anti-Thy1.2-FITC (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used for the second color. To measure the expression of activation markers on T cells, spleen T cells were stained with anti-Thy1.2-PE in combination with anti-CD25-FITC (clone M-A251), anti-CD44-FITC (clone IM7), anti-CD54-FITC (clone HA58), or anti-CD69-FITC (clone FN50). All of these mAbs were obtained from PharMingen, unless indicated otherwise. Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL) Assay—The assay was performed as detailed earlier (32Zhang J. Salcedo T.W. Wan X. Ullrich S. Hu B. Gregorio T. Feng P. Qi S. Chen H. Cho Y.H. Li Y. Moore P.A. Wu J. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1459-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) using transgenic 2C mouse spleen cells (in H-2b background with most of their T cells specific to Ld, 0.4 × 106 cells/well) as responders, mitomycin C-treated BALB/c mouse spleen cells (H-2d) as stimulators, and 51Cr-labeled P815 cells (H-2d) as targets. This system is very sensitive and has a high signal-to-noise ratio because of the high frequency of Ld-specific precursor T cells (30Chen H. Luo H. Xu D. Loh D.Y. Daloze P.M. Veillette A. Qi S. Wu J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4297-4308PubMed Google Scholar). The lysis percentage of the test sample was calculated as follows: % lysis = (cpm of the test sample - cpm of spontaneous release)/(cpm of maximal release - cpm of spontaneous release). Cytokine Measurement—Culture supernatants of T cells placed in anti-CD3-coated and/or EFNB3-Fc-coated wells were harvested 1–3 days after the initiation of culture. IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-γ in the supernatants were quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Confocal Microscopy—Five million BALB/c T cells were reacted on ice for 30 min with 5 μg of EFNB3-Fc and 1 μg of biotinylated anti-CD3 (clone 2C11, hamster mAb). After washing, the cells were incubated with goat anti-hamster IgG (5 μg/sample) for 30 min on ice. They were then washed with cold PBS and transferred to warm PBS to start the crosslinking process at 37 °C for different time periods; this was followed by immediate fixation with 3.7% formalin. For TCR and EFNB3R staining, the cells were reacted with streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 594 (1 μg/sample) and goat anti-human IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 (1 μg/106 cells) on ice for 30 min. For raft and EFNB3R staining, the procedure was similar to that described above, but cholera toxin-Alexa Fluor 594 (0.5 μg/sample) was used in place of streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 594. The slides were examined under a confocal microscope. Immunoblotting—Twelve-well plates were coated overnight with anti-CD3 (0.8 μg/ml, 500 μl/well) at 4 °C. After washing, the wells were incubated with EFNB3-Fc or NHIgG, both at 10 μg/ml and 500 μl/well at 37 °C for 1 to 2 h and then at 0 °C for another 2 h. BALB/c spleen T cells were seeded in the pre-coated plates at 5 × 106 cells/well, and the plates were centrifuged at 228 × g for 5 min to achieve rapid contact between the cells and the bottom of the culture wells. The cells were then cultured at 37 °C for 2 h before being harvested. The remainder of the procedure is detailed in our previous publication (30Chen H. Luo H. Xu D. Loh D.Y. Daloze P.M. Veillette A. Qi S. Wu J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4297-4308PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the harvested cells were washed and lysed in lysis buffer for 10 min; the cleared lysates were resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE with 50 μg protein/lane and were then blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were sequentially hybridized with rabbit anti-phosphop38 MAPK Ab followed by rabbit anti-p38 MAPK Ab or with rabbit anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK Ab followed by anti-p44/42 MAPK Ab. All of the Abs used in immunoblotting were obtained from New England Biolab (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Signals were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence. EFNB3 and EFNB3R Expression in Leukocytes—EFNB3 expression at the mRNA level in the spleen was examined by in situ hybridization with the liver serving as a negative control (Fig. 1). In the spleen, the EFNB3 signal was detected in the white pulp, suggesting that lymphocytes express EFNB3. The expression of EFNB3 and EFNB3Rs on resting and activated Thy1+ T cells was investigated with flow cytometry by anti-EFNB3/anti-Thy1 or EFNB3-Fc/anti-Thy-1 two-color staining (Fig. 2A). EFNB3 was detectable in 18.8% resting T cells (cultured in medium), and 24-h activation of T cells with solid-phase anti-CD3 did not significantly change the level of EFNB3 expression (24.0%). EFNB3R was expressed on 30.4% resting T cells; no apparent modulation of expression (30.1%) 24 h after T-cell activation was observed. The expression of EFNB3 and EFNB3R in resting CD4 and CD8 cells (cultured in medium for 24 h) was determined by anti-EFNB3 or EFNB3-Fc one-color staining of magnetic bead-purified CD4 and CD8 cells (Fig. 2C). The expression of EFNB3 on CD4 and CD8 cells was similar (26.1 and 22.1%, respectively), although CD4 cells expressed more EFNB3Rs than CD8 cells (45.4 and 21.3%, respectively). EFNB3 and EFNB3R were barely detectable in B cells (5.7 and 3.2%, respectively) but were expressed in a significant percentage of monocytes/macrophages (20.4 and 35.5%, respectively) (Fig. 2B). EFNB3 Enhances T-cell Proliferation and Modulates Activation Marker Expression—Because EFNB3Rs are expressed in a significant portion of T cells, it is likely that EFNB3 plays a role in modulating T-cell function. Solid-phase EFNB3, in the presence of solid-phase anti-CD3, was used to assess this possibility. EFNB3-Fc, but not a control protein (normal human IgG), dose-dependently induced T-cell proliferation in the presence of a suboptimal concentration of anti-CD3 (Fig. 3A). When T cells were stimulated with an optimal amount of EFNB3-Fc and various amounts of anti-CD3, they proliferated dose-dependently in response to the latter (Fig. 3B). We also compared the costimulation by EFNB3-Fc with that by anti-CD28 mAb (Fig. 3C). Costimulation mediated by EFNB3Rs was at a moderately lower level than that mediated by the classical costimulatory molecule CD28. Anti-CD3 (at a suboptimal concentration) or EFNB3-Fc (at an optimal concentration) alone caused low level or no T-cell proliferation, respectively (last two columns of Fig. 3C). The response of CD4 and CD8 cells to EFNB3 costimulation was similar (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, the costimulation via EFNB3R was insensitive to cyclosporin A (CyA). As shown in Fig. 3E, CyA, which inhibits Ca2+ flux-dependent T-cell activation (33Ghosh P. Buchholz M.A. Yano S. Taub D. Longo D.L. Blood. 2002; 99: 4517-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 34Almawi W.Y. Assi J.W. Chudzik D.M. Lazarovits A.I. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 381: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), could effectively suppress ionomycin and PMA-induced T-cell proliferation but failed to do so for T cells activated by PMA plus solid-phase anti-CD28 or PMA plus solid-phase EFNB3. This finding suggests that CD28 and EFNB3R costimulation both utilize the Ca2+-independent pathway. Next, we assessed whether the EFNB3 can augment anti-CD28 costimulation in the presence of anti-CD3. At optimal CD28 concentration (10 μg/ml for coating), solid-phase EFNB3 had no additional effect (Fig. 3F). However, at suboptimal anti-CD28 concentration (5 or 2.5 μg/ml), EFNB3 could moderately enhance the costimulation. This finding suggests again that CD28 and EFNB3R do not employ two totally separate pathways. EFNB3 is known to interact with three Eph receptors, i.e. EphA4, EphB3, and EphB4 (35Kullander K. Croll S.D. Zimmer M. Pan L. McClain J. Hughes V. Zabski S. DeChiara T.M. Klein R. Yancopoulos G.D. Gale N.W. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 36Brambilla R. Bruckner K. Orioli D. Bergemann A.D. Flanagan J.G. Klein R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 199-209Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 37Helbling P.M. Saulnier D.M. Robinson V. Christiansen J.H. Wilkinson D.G. Brandli A.W. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 216: 361-373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated which of these mediated EFNB3-triggered costimulation. Soluble EphA4, EphB3, or EphB4 alone (3 μg/ml) or in combination were added to MLR, and thymidine uptake was measured 5 days later. As shown in Fig. 3G, EphA4 and EphB4, but not EphB3, was able to suppress MLR, suggesting the possible involvement of the former two in the EFNB3-triggered costimulation. The expression of certain activation markers on T cells after EFNB3 costimulation was then assessed. T cells were stimulated with solid-phase anti-CD3 alone (at a suboptimal amount) or solid-phase anti-CD3 plus EFNB3-Fc (at an optimal amount). As shown in Fig. 4, anti-CD3 alone (shaded area) was unable to up-regulate the activation markers examined, i.e. CD25, CD44, CD54, and CD69. After combined stimulation with anti-CD3 and EFNB3-Fc, CD69 was significantly up-regulated and CD54 was moderately increased, although CD25 and CD44 were not. In contrast, all of these markers were drastically up-regulated when T cells were costimulated by solid-phase anti-CD28. These results indicate that EFNB3Rs can enhance T-cell activation to TCR stimulation, but such enhancement seems qualitatively different from that of CD28. EFNB3 Enhances Lymphokine Production and CTL Activity—We next examined the effect of EFNB3 on T-cell effector functions, such as lymphokine production and CTL activity. Again, T cells were stimulated with solid-phase anti-CD3 alone (at a suboptimal amount) or in combination with EFNB3-Fc or anti-CD28 (both at optimal amounts and on solid-phase). NHIgG was used as a negative control for EFNB3-Fc. Three representative lymphokines, IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-γ, were measured from day 1 to day 3 after stimulation (Fig. 5A). Anti-CD3 with or without NHIgG (i.e. PBS) did not trigger lymphokine production. Anti-CD28 costimulation drastically induced IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-γ, as expected. EFNB3-Fc led IFN-γ production to a level comparable with but moderately lower than that caused by anti-CD28 costimulation but did not stimulate IL-4 and IL-2 production. The lack of IL-2 and IL-4 production after EFNB3 costimulation was not caused by a shift of secretion kinetics, because no production of IL-2 or IL-4 was observed at any time between days 1 and 3 after culture. This result demonstrates that EFNB3 and anti-CD28 costimulation have qualitative differences. When mixed lymphocyte reaction was elicited in EFNB3-Fc-coated wells, CTL development was greatly enhanced (Fig. 5B), whereas control normal human IgG had no such effect. This finding indicates that EFNB3 costimulation positively regulates an important effector function of T cells, i.e. CTL activity. Signaling Events in T Cells Stimulated by EFNB3—To understand the mechanisms of EFNB3 costimulation, we first examined the translocation of EFNB3Rs and TCR on the T-cell surface and their relationship to membrane lipid rafts immediately after TCR-crosslinking (Fig. 6). TCR was crosslinked by biotinylated anti-CD3 followed by goat anti-hamster IgG. The TCR complex was stained by streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 594 in red; EFNB3Rs, by EFNB3-Fc followed by anti-human IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 in green; the lipid rafts in the T-cell membrane, by cholera toxin (CT)-Alexa Fluor 594 in red. In resting T cells, rafts, TCR, and EFNB3Rs were evenly distributed throughout the cell surface (0 min). After 10-min crosslinking with anti-CD3, TCR rapidly polarized and formed a cap in one end of the cell. EFNB3Rs also congregated, and they co-localized with TCR (Fig. 6A). After CD3 crosslinking, the rafts underwent congregation and formed caps as well. EFNB3Rs translocated into the raft caps (Fig. 6B). This indicated that the TCR complex (as detected by anti-CD3), EFNB3Rs (as detected by EFNB2-Fc), and the raft (as detected by CT) all clumped together. This provides a morphological base for EFNB3Rs to enhance TCR signaling, because now both TCR and EFNB3Rs are closely associated and located in aggregated rafts, and their respective signaling pathways can interact closely. In EFNB3-Fc-costimulated T cells, we examined MAPK activity, which is modulated in other cell types when some Eph kinases are activated (38Freywald A. Sharfe N. Roifman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3823-3828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 39Salojin K.V. Zhang J. Delovitch T.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 844-853PubMed Google Scholar, 40Dustin M.L.

Cell. Bio. 2001; 3: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7A, a combination of solid-phase EFNB3-Fc and suboptimal anti-CD3 stimulation for 2 h led to increased p38 MAPK and p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation, a sign of their activation, whereas anti-CD3 at suboptimal concentration had little effect, according to immunoblotting. The membranes were reprobed with anti-p38 MAPK Ab and anti-p44/42 MAPK Ab, respectively. Total p38 MAPK and p44/42 MAPK protein levels were similar with various treatments. Therefore, these MAPKs were activated after EFNB3R-crosslinking. To test whether such MAPK activation was relevant and necessary in EFNB3 costimulation, we used p38 and p44/42 MAPK-specific inhibitors (SB203580 and PD98059, respectively) to treat T cells costimulated by EFNB3. Both inhibitors, but not their nonfunctional structural analogue (SB202474), inhibited EFNB3R costimulation in terms of proliferation (Fig. 7B), indicating that p38 and p44/42 MAPK activation is an integral and necessary part of the EFNB3R signaling pathway. We have reported that EFNB3 and EFNB3Rs were expressed in T cells and monocytes/macrophages. T cells costimulated by solid-phase EFNB3-Fc in the presence of suboptimal anti-CD3 showed enhanced proliferation and CTL activity, production of IFN-γ but not IL-2, and expression of certain T-cell activation markers, such as CD69. Upon TCR activation, EFNB3Rs translocated into the raft caps, to which TCR also congregated. Further downstream, MAPK activity was enhanced by EFNB3-Fc costimulation. These results suggest that EFNB3 and its receptors play important roles in T-cell activation and function. The inherent difficulty in studying the receptors and functions of EFNs is that each of them binds to multiple Eph family members. In the case of EFNB3, it is known to interact with EphA4 (35Kullander K. Croll S.D. Zimmer M. Pan L. McClain J. Hughes V. Zabski S. DeChiara T.M. Klein R. Yancopoulos G.D. Gale N.W. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), EphB3 (36Brambilla R. Bruckner K. Orioli D. Bergemann A.D. Flanagan J.G. Klein R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 199-209Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and EphB/4 (37Helbling P.M. Saulnier D.M. Robinson V. Christiansen J.H. Wilkinson D.G. Brandli A.W. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 216: 361-373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its interaction with additional Eph members is also possible. We attempted to identify the receptors mediating the ligation of EFNB3. Soluble EphA4, EphB3, and EphB4 were added to MLR. EphA4 and EphB4, but not EphB3, were able to partially inhibit the T-cell proliferation. This suggests that the former two might mediate the effect of EFNB3. However, as Ephs and EFNs are capable of two-way signaling, and the EphA4 and EphB4 can potentially interact with EFNs in addition to EFNB3, we cannot exclude the possibility that the observed inhibitory effect is due to the binding of EphA4 and EphB4 to certain EFNs (including EFNB3), which transduce negative signals into T cells. Therefore, the receptors responsible for the binding or functions of EFNB3 cannot be conclusively pinpointed until specific mAbs to (and conditional gene knockout mice of) each and every Eph (especially EphBs) become available. However, our study is significant, because the effect of EFNB3 detected here reflects combinatory functions of all receptors triggered by EFNB3, and this is perhaps a true picture of what EFNB3 can achieve in vivo. Although the EFNB3 signal was initially not found in the spleen by Northern blotting (42Gale N.W. Flenniken A. Compton D.C. Jenkins N. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Davis S. Wilkinson D.G. Yancopoulos G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1343-1352PubMed Google Scholar), we demonstrated that spleen white pulp expressed EFNB3 mRNA according to in situ hybridization, and this result was supported by detection of EFNB3 expression on T cells and monocytes/macrophages at the protein level by flow cytometry. The discrepancy between the previous report and our current findings is probably because of the sensitivity of the tests employed. Because EFNB3 is expressed on T cells and monocytes/macrophages implies that all these cells can enhance responsiveness or reduce the response threshold of EFNB3R+ T cells to antigens. This fact might explain the advantage for T cells to be activated in lymphoid organs where leukocytes are tightly packed. Although costimulation from antigen-presenting cells to T cells is well studied, we now can understand that the signaling between T-cells is equally important for T-cell activation. A typical proof of this concept can be found in any T-cell culture system, in which minimal cell density is normally required for optimal T-cell activation. Although autocrine is often quoted as a reason for such a requirement, interaction through cell-surface receptors and ligands on the T cells is likely a more fundamental mechanism. Recently, Wang et al. (43Wang J. Lo J.C. Foster A. Yu P. Chen H.M. Wang Y. Tamada K. Chen L. Fu Y.X. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1771-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that LIGHT, which is a cell-surface ligand belonging to the tumor necrosis factor family member and is predominantly expressed on T cells, can stimulate T-cell activation both in vivo and in vitro through its receptor HveA on T cells. We have shown that in pure T-cell culture, the interaction between EphB6 and its T-cell surface ligand can enhance T-cell response to TCR stimulation (20Luo H. Yu G. Wu Y. Wu J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1141-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The expression of both EFNB3 and EFNB3R on T cells and the effect of EFNB3 on T-cells costimulation, as documented in this study, suggests the possibility that these two molecules are also involved in T-cell/T-cell co-operation. We compared T-cell costimulations mediated by CD28 and EFNB3R. The former induced vigorous production of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-γ, but the latter only triggered IFN-γ secretion, showing a qualitative difference. T cells can be activated experimentally through Ca2+-dependent or -independent pathways; the former but not the latter is sensitive to CyA inhibition (33Ghosh P. Buchholz M.A. Yano S. Taub D. Longo D.L. Blood. 2002; 99: 4517-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 34Almawi W.Y. Assi J.W. Chudzik D.M. Lazarovits A.I. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 381: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). CD28 costimulation in the presence of PKC activator, PMA, utilizes the Ca2+-independent pathway and is resistant to CyA (33Ghosh P. Buchholz M.A. Yano S. Taub D. Longo D.L. Blood. 2002; 99: 4517-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 34Almawi W.Y. Assi J.W. Chudzik D.M. Lazarovits A.I. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 381: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the same model, EFNB3R costimulation was also resistant to CyA, suggesting that it also activates the Ca2+-independent pathway. When anti-CD28 was used at suboptimal but not optimal concentrations, EFNB3 was able to moderately further enhance the T-cell proliferation, suggesting a certain overlap between CD28 and EFNB3R functions. Taken together, these data show that the signaling pathways of CD28 and EFNB3R are distinct but not totally separated. A recent study showed that plasma membrane compartmentalization plays an essential role in T-cell activation and costimulation. On the T-cell membrane, detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched rafts contain proteins, such as Src kinases that are highly relevant for T-cell signaling (44Xavier R. Seed B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Strong TCR ligation induces the association of TCR and the rafts, and this association is correlated with TCR signaling and T-cell activation (40Dustin M.L. Cooper J.A. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). In our case, EFNB3R migrated into the rafts after TCR crosslinking (as seen in Fig. 6) by anti-CD3. Therefore, it is possible that EFNB3Rs works in concert with TCR: TCR crosslinking leads to raft reorganization, EFNB3R congregates into the capped rafts where it co-localizes with TCR, and the EFNB3R signaling pathway interacts with that of TCR and enhances the latter. For proper T-cell activation, Ras and Rac signaling pathways need to be mobilized. Ras activation leads to activation of p44/42 MAPK kinases, which, in turn, results in the synthesis and activation of various transcription factors. On the other hand, activation of Rac and Cdc42 small G proteins elicits p38 MAPK activation, which is essential for cytoskeleton reorganization. Such reorganization is now known to be pivotal for T-cell signaling (40Dustin M.L. Cooper J.A. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). We have found that the activities of both p44/42 and p38 MAPK are enhanced in the presence of EFNB3 costimulation, and this is consistent with the roles of these MAPK in T-cell activation. Recently, it has been reported that EphB2 activation results in the inhibition of p44/42 MAPK in neuronal cells (45Elowe S. Holland S.J. Kulkarni S. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7429-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and that EphA activation leads to inhibition of this kinase in several cell lines of endothelial and epithelial origin (41Miao H. Wei B.R. Peehl D.M. Li Q. Alexandrou T. Schelling J.R. Rhim J.S. Sedor J.R. Burnett E. Wang B. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2001; 3: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Obviously, these reports deal with cell types that are different from those in our study, but the consequence is different as well. Our study demonstrates the role of EFNB3 in regulating T-cell function. Similar functions were found with EFNB1 and EFNB2 (data not shown), suggesting that these molecules have overlapping but essential functions in T-cell activation. These findings represent an initial step toward understanding the biological significance of ephrins and Ephs in the immune system.

https://openalex.org/W1972874234,"Ribonuclease E (RNase E) has a key role in mRNA degradation and the processing of catalytic and structural RNAs in E. coli. We report the discovery of an evolutionarily conserved 17.4 kDa protein, here named RraA (regulator of ribonuclease activity A) that binds to RNase E and inhibits RNase E endonucleolytic cleavages without altering cleavage site specificity or interacting detectably with substrate RNAs. Overexpression of RraA circumvents the effects of an autoregulatory mechanism that normally maintains the RNase E cellular level within a narrow range, resulting in the genome-wide accumulation of RNase E-targeted transcripts. While not required for RraA action, the C-terminal RNase E region that serves as a scaffold for formation of a multiprotein degradosome complex modulates the inhibition of RNase E catalytic activity by RraA. Our results reveal a possible mechanism for the dynamic regulation of RNA decay and processing by inhibitory RNase binding proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2035500342,"Polysialic acid attached to the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) is thought to play a critical role in development. NCAM in muscle tissue contains a muscle-specific domain (MSD) to which mucin type O-glycans are attached. In the present study, using the C2C12 myoblast system, we show that NCAM containing MSD is increasingly expressed on the cell surface as myotubes form. Polysialic acid is primarily attached to N-glycans of NCAM, and polysialylated NCAM is expressed on the outer surface of myotube bundles. By transfecting cDNAs encoding wild type and mutant forms of NCAM, we found that NCAM containing MSD facilitates myoblast fusion, and this effect is diminished by mutating O-glycosylation sites at MSD. By contrast, forced expression of polysialic acid in early differentiation stages reduces myotube formation and delays the expression of NCAM containing the MSD domain. Strikingly, inhibition of polysialic acid synthesis by antisense DNA approach induced differentiation in both human rhabdomyosarcoma cells, which overexpress polysialic acid, and C2C12 cells. These results indicate that polysialic acid and mucin type O-glycans on NCAM differentially regulate myoblast fusion, playing critical roles in muscle development.

These results indicate that polysialic acid and mucin type O-glycans on NCAM differentially regulate myoblast fusion, playing critical roles in muscle development. During mammalian embryonic development, muscle development is initiated once mesenchymal cells commit to become myoblasts. Myoblasts then align and fuse, forming multinucleated myotubes, and mature myotubes are bundled together, forming sarcolemma. In parallel, each myotube starts contraction, receives innervation from motor and sensory neurons, and eventually forms muscle tissue. In this process, one of the most intriguing steps is myoblast fusion. Myoblast fusion consists of multiple steps: expression of the fusion competent phenotype, specific myoblast-myoblast recognition and alignment, cell adhesion and electrical coupling, and fusion of lipid bilayer membrane (1.Knudsen K.A. Wilschut J. Hoekstral D. Membrane Fusion. Dekker, New York1991: 601-626Google Scholar).

McElwee S.A. Smith L. Dev. Biol. 1990; 138: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), indicating that cell-cell adhesion via NCAM apparently initiates myoblast fusion. In addition, integrins, N-cadherin, VCAM, and VLA4 are thought to be involved (see Ref. 3.Schwander M. Leu M. Stumm M. Dorchies O.M. Ruegg S.T. Schittny J. Muller U. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 673-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar and references herein).NCAM is found in several isoforms due to alternative mRNA splicing of more than 19 exons. In mammalian brain, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored 120-kDa isoform and transmembrane 140- and 180-kDa isoforms are primarily expressed. In muscles, three isoforms have been reported: a GPI-anchored 125-kDa isoform and transmembrane 140- and 155-kDa isoforms (4.Walsh F.S. Parekh R.B. Moore S.E. Dickson G. Barton C.H. Gower H.J. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Development. 1989; 105: 803-811PubMed Google Scholar). Muscle-specific domain (MSD) was identified in the cDNA of the 125-kDa NCAM isoform obtained from human skeletal muscle (5.Dickson G. Gower H.J. Barton C.H. Prentice H.M. Elsom V.L. Moore S.E. Cox R.D. Quinn C. Putt W. Walsh F.S. Cell. 1987; 50: 1119-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). MSD is encoded by four different exons, MSD1a, MSD1b, MSD1c, and codon AAG. The full-length MSD sequence consists of 35 amino acids inserted between two fibronectin type III domains of NCAM. MSD insertion is observed only in skeletal muscle and heart and not in other tissues. O-Glycosylation of MSD was shown by peanut agglutinin (PNA) lectin affinity column chromatography and structural analysis (4.Walsh F.S. Parekh R.B. Moore S.E. Dickson G. Barton C.H. Gower H.J. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Development. 1989; 105: 803-811PubMed Google Scholar)Transfection studies using in vitro myoblast culture systems indicated that NCAM containing MSD promotes myoblast fusion. Dickson et al. transfected GPI-anchored human NCAM with (125 kDa) or without (120 kDa) MSD into C2 myoblast cells and found that 125-kDa NCAM enhanced myoblast fusion, whereas the 120-kDa isoform did not (6.Dickson G. Peck D. Moore S.E. Barton C.H. Walsh F.S. Nature. 1990; 344: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Similarly, in transgenic mice overexpressing the human 125-kDa NCAM that contains MSD, secondary myotube formation is enhanced (7.Fazeli S. Wells D.J. Hobbs C. Walsh F.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These results suggest that MSD motif promotes myoblast fusion. However, it is not known whether O-glycans attached to MSD or the amino acid sequence of MSD contribute to this activity.It has been reported that polysialic acid, another modification of NCAM, plays a critical role in neural development. Polysialic acid is a homopolymer of α2,8-linked sialic acid, which can be extended as many as 60 units in the developing nervous system. Polysialic acid is synthesized by two polysialyltransferases, ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV (8.Angata K. Fukuda M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22685-22688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). NCAM is the most prominent acceptor molecule of polysialic acid, and the fifth and sixth N-glycosylation sites in the immunoglobulin-like domain 5 of NCAM are known to be preferentially polysialylated (14.Nelson R.W. Bates P.A. Rutishauser U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17171-17179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15.Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

Gene inactivation of ST8Sia IV is associated with impaired long term potentiation in Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses of the adult hippocampus (17.Eckhardt M. Bukalo O. Chazal G. Wang L. Goridis C. Schachner M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Cremer H. Dityatev A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5234-5244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This defect is apparently due to a substantial decrease of polysialic acid in the CA1 region. These and other studies suggest that polysialic acid attenuates NCAM-NCAM homophilic interaction, allowing cells expressing polysialic acid to migrate and/or extend.In the present study, we employed the C2C12 mouse myoblast culture system to determine the roles of NCAM glycosylation in muscle development. C2C12 cells were derived from so-called satellite muscle cells and can be maintained as myoblast cells. When C2C12 cells are cultured in a low concentration of horse serum, they differentiate and form myotubes within 5-7 days (6.Dickson G. Peck D. Moore S.E. Barton C.H. Walsh F.S. Nature. 1990; 344: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Using this system, we observed that expression of NCAM precedes the expression of polysialic acid. By transfecting various forms of NCAM, we found that NCAM containing MSD in particular facilitates myoblast fusion and that this activity is diminished by mutation of potential O-glycosylation sites within MSD. On the other hand, abolition of N-linked polysialylation sites in NCAM facilitated myoblast fusion, whereas overexpression of polysialic acid inhibited myoblast fusion. These results indicate that the O-glycans on the MSD of NCAM facilitate myoblast fusion, whereas polysialic acid attenuates this process.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—Anti-mouse NCAM antibody H.28-123 and anti-skeletal myosin heavy chain antibody MY-32 were purchased from Immunotech and Sigma, respectively. Cyan fluorescence protein (CFP) was detected using anti-GFP peptide antibody (Clontech). Human NCAM was stained with anti-CD56 antibody (ERIC-1, Leinco Technologies), which does not react with mouse NCAM. A hybridoma of anti-polysialic acid antibody 5A5 (18.Dodd J. Morton S.B. Karagogeos D. Yamamoto M. Jessell T.M. Neuron. 1988; 1: 105-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) was purchased from the University of Iowa Hybridoma Bank.Plasmid Construction and Transfection—cDNA encoding human NCAM containing MSD and NCAM without MSD was cloned into pcDNA3.1 as described previously (19.Franceschini I. Angata K. Ong E. Hong A. Doherty P. Fukuda M. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding GPI anchoring domain was excised from human NCAM 120 in pHβAPr-1-neo by KpnI-PvuII digestion and inserted into KpnI-EcoRV sites of pcDNA3.1-NCAM, resulting in pcDNA3.1-NCAM-GPI. The HindIII-EcoRI fragment of NCAM, of which the fourth, fifth, and sixth N-glycosylation site asparagines were mutated to glutamine (15.Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), replaced the corresponding region of pcDNA3.1-NCAM-GPI. By these constructions, we could obtain four isoforms of NCAM (M+N-, M-N-, M+N+, and M-N+). NCAM (M+N+) and NCAM (M-N+) are equivalent to 125- and 120-kDa wild type human NCAM isoforms, respectively.Mutation of the O-glycosylation site threonine to alanine was introduced by PCR using mutated primers: TA1-forward, TCTGCTAGCTCGTCTGCACCTGTTCCATT; TA2-f, TCTGCTAGCTCGTCTGCACCTGTTCCATTGTCTCCACCAGATGCAACT; TA3-f, TCTGCTAGCTCGTCTGCACCTGTTCCATTGTCTCCACCAGATGCAACTTGGCCTCTTCCTGCCCTTGCAGCCACA (NheI site in boldface type; codon for Ala underlined). GPI-reverse, AAGAGTCACCGCAGAGAAAAGC was used as the 3′ primer. The mutated fragment was amplified and introduced into the NheI-KpnI site of pcDNA3-NCAM (M+N-)-GPI.Cloning of cDNAs encoding human ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV was described previously (11.Nakayama J.

Fukuda M. J. Biol.

Briefly, the PstI-AgeI PCR product of ST8Sia IV or ST8Sia II was introduced into the pECFP-N1 vector (Clontech), and then the entire ST8SiaIV-CFP chimera was transferred to pcDNA3. Both immunostaining and immunoblots showed that NCAM was extensively polysialylated by chimeric enzymes, indicating that modification of the C terminus of polysialyltransferases by CFP did not affect their activity as reported for ST8Sia IV-GFP (21.Angata K. Yen T.Y. El-Battari A. Macher B.A. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15369-15377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).cDNA encoding ST8Sia IV-CFP was introduced to PstI-NotI sites of the pIND vector of the ecdysone-inducible expression system (Invitrogen).Antisense DNA of ST8Sia II or ST8Sia IV was amplified by PCR. cDNAs encoding full-length ST8Sia II or ST8Sia IV were flipped, and KpnI and HindIII sites were attached and then ligated to the N terminus of GFP in pcDNA3.1. Primers used for PCR were as follows: hST8SiaIVa-f, CGGGGTACCAACCAGGACTTTCTCGGGCAC; hST8SiaIVa-r, GTGCCCAAGCTTGTGCATATTGTTTGTTTC; hST8SiaIIa-f, CGGGGTACCGGTCCTGGCGGGCGAACCCACCATG; hST8SiaIIa-r, GTGCCCAAGCTTCTACGTGGCCCCATCGCACT. All cDNA sequences were confirmed by sequencing.Establishment of C2C12 Stable Transfectants—C2C12 cells and rhabdomyosarcoma TE671 and RD cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. C2C12 cells were routinely maintained in DME-high glucose with 20% fetal calf serum. To induce differentiation, the medium was changed to DME-high glucose with 2% horse serum when cells reached confluence, and the medium was changed every day (6.Dickson G. Peck D. Moore S.E. Barton C.H. Walsh F.S. Nature. 1990; 344: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).NCAM or polysialyltransferase plasmids were transfected into C2C12 cells at myoblast stages using LipofectAmine PLUS (Invitrogen) as described previously (20.Angata K. Nakayama J. Fredette B. Chong K. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7182-7190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants of NCAM were selected in hygromycin or G418 (O-glycosylation mutants), and ST8Sia II or ST8Sia IV transfectants were selected by G418. Each stable cell clone apparently exhibited different fusion competency, probably due to difference in the locus of integration of transfected DNA and number of integrated DNA. Also, by immunostaining and immunoblot, we found that expression level of NCAM or polysialic acid varies among clones. We could observe that integrated DNA induced or inhibited fusion depending on transfected cDNAs. To avoid clonal variation, we decided to use a mixture of clones expressing NCAM or polysialic acid.Transfected cells were detached from dishes by cell dissociation buffer (Specialty Media Inc.), and stained with anti-NCAM (ERIC-1) or anti-polysialic acid (5A5) antibody followed by secondary antibody conjugated with FITC. After staining, cells were incubated in DME medium for 20 min at 37 °C to internalize fluorescence-tagged antibodies into cells. The cells were then washed with PBS, digested with trypsin at 37 °C for 8 min, suspended in sorting buffer (5% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, in PBS), filtered through 40-μm nylon mesh, and sorted by FACStar (Becton Dickinson). This procedure was necessary, since C2C12 cells dissociated without trypsin tend to aggregate. Expression of transfected proteins on sorted cells was confirmed by immunoblot and immunostaining as described previously (22.Yeh J.C. Hiraoka N. Petryniak B. Nakayama J. Ellies L.G. Rabuka D. Hindsgaul O. Marth J.D. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. Cell. 2001; 105: 957-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar).ST8SiaIV-CFP/pIND ecdysone-inducible vector and pVgRXR ecdysone receptor were transfected into C2C12 sequentially according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). The ST8Sia IV-positive clone was selected by G418 and Zeocin resistance, and cells were stained with anti-CFP antibody before and after induction to confirm expression of ST8Sia IV-CFP. The expression of ST8Sia IV-CFP was induced by addition of the inducer, ponasterone A.Cell Fusion Assay—For each NCAM mutant, three or four independent series of transfection, cell sorting, and cell fusion assays were performed. Cells were plated at a density of 8 × 105 cells on coverslips in each well of 6-well plates, and 40 h after plating, medium was changed from growth (20% fetal calf serum in DME) to differentiation (2% horse serum in DME) medium (6.Dickson G. Peck D. Moore S.E. Barton C.H. Walsh F.S. Nature. 1990; 344: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). After every 24 h, a coverglass was sampled and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. From day 0 to 7, a total of eight coverglasses were collected for each cell line. Cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and the cells were stained with anti-myosin antibody followed by secondary antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or rhodamine, treated with 0.0005% Hoechst 33258 for 5 min. Staining was analyzed using a Nikon ECLIPSE TE300 microscope connected with a SPOT CCD camera or Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal laser-scanning microscope. After counting the number of nuclei in four fields for each coverslip at 40 × 10 magnification (∼200 cells in one field), the average ratio (percentage) of nuclei in myosin-positive cells/total nuclei was calculated as a fusion index. The S.D. is shown for a variation among four fields.Immunoblotting—Cells were scraped and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS in PBS) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) by trituration through 26G⅜-gauge needles. Cell lysates were subjected to sonication in ice-cold water for 15 min and left on ice for another 15 min, and cell debris was removed by brief centrifugation. The protein concentration of cell extracts was determined by a micro-BCA kit (Pierce). Twenty μg of protein was applied to each lane of SDS-PAGE (6% gel) and then blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and conventional immunoblotting was performed.Polysialylated proteins were immunoprecipitated from C2C12 cell lysates or [3H]glucosamine-labeled cell lysates by using 5A5 anti-polysialic acid antibody and goat anti-mouse IgM antibody conjugated to agarose beads (Sigma). The immune complex was washed by radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and PBS and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting using NCAM antibody (nonradioactive) or fluorography (radioactive).RT-PCR—Following the manufacturer's protocol, 100-200 μg of total RNA was isolated from C2C12 cells using the TRIZOL RNA extraction reagent (Invitrogen). After treatment with DNase I, 20 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed by SuperScript II (Invitrogen) using an oligo(dT) primer. The cDNA sample was dissolved in 100 μl of water, and 2.5 μl was used for each PCR. Competitive PCR for mouse ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV was carried out essentially as described with a slight modification (23.Ong E. Nakayama J. Angata K. Reyes L. Katsuyama T. Arai Y. Fukuda M. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).Since PCR products for NCAM showed several bands, these bands were separately excised, cloned into TA vector (pGEM-5Zf(+), Promega) and sequenced. Primers used to detect NCAM variants in PCR were as follows: MSD-f, GGTGCAGTTTGATGAGCCAGAGG; MSD-r, GATAGTGTCTGATGGGGGAGCC; GPI/TMD-f, CAGGTAGATATTGTTCCCAGCC; GPI-reverse; TMD-r, AGTCCGTTCTTCCTCCGTTC. PCR using MSD-f and MSD-r yields PCR products from transcripts encoding MSD. PCR using GPI/TMD-f and GPI-reverse yields PCR products for GPI-anchored NCAM, whereas PCR with TMD-f and TMD-r yields products for transmembrane domain-containing NCAM.Oligosaccharide Structure Analysis—C2C12 cells were metabolically labeled with 40 μCi/ml of [3H]glucosamine in 10 ml of glucose-free DME medium for 4 h on day 2, and then 10 ml of DME-high glucose, 2% horse serum was added and incubated for an additional 20 h at 37 °C. Labeled cells were scraped on day 3 and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as described above.The same amount of protein derived from control and ST8Sia IV-transfected C2C12 cells was subjected to immunoprecipitation by anti-NCAM antibody (H.28-123). Ten μl out of 300 μl of immunoprecipitate suspension were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography, using Amplify (Amersham Biosciences). The rest of the samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After staining polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, bands corresponding to each NCAM isoform were excised and subjected to N-glycanase digestion (N-glycosidase F; Calbiochem). Supernatants of the N-glycanase digest were purified and subjected to Mono-Q anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (15.Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).RESULTSNCAM-MSD and Polysialic Acid Are Sequentially Expressed on the Cell Surface of C2C12 Cells—Differentiation of C2C12 cells can be induced by substitution of culture medium containing 20% fetal calf serum with 2% horse serum (day 0, D0). Fig. 1A shows that NCAM and polysialic acid were sequentially expressed on the cell surface after induction of differentiation. Myosin represents a marker of differentiated cells (day 3 and later). Before induction, neither NCAM nor polysialic acid was clearly detected on the cell surface. At the onset of myoblast fusion at around day 1-3, NCAM first appeared on the cell surface, followed by polysialic acid. Fig. 1B shows confocal images at day 5. On mature myotubes, both polysialic acid and NCAM were expressed. Whereas NCAM was expressed mostly at the outer surface of myotubes (see red color), polysialic acid was almost exclusively expressed on the outside surface of myotube bundles (Fig. 1B, green). The latter finding is consistent with previous observation of chick myoblast development that outer surface of myotube bundle is decorated by polysialic acid (24.Fredette B. Rutishauser U. Landmesser L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1867-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Strong staining of polysialic acid can be occasionally observed on fused cells at day 3, but its function is unknown.Four Isoforms of NCAM Are Expressed in C2C12 Cells—To determine how NCAM expression is regulated during C2C12 cell differentiation, we examined the amount of NCAM and its transcription. First we could observe several isoforms of NCAM protein by immunoblotting (Fig. 2B). The top band corresponds to the TM form of NCAM with MSD (155 kDa), and the middle thick band consists of two bands, the TM form without MSD (140 kDa) and GPI form with MSD (125 kDa). The lower band is the GPI form without MSD. These four isoforms were clearly separated after sialidase digestion (Fig. 2B, second row). The blot of sialidase-treated NCAM shows switching in the synthesis of NCAM from the TM form to the GPI + MSD form as differentiation progresses, consistent with the developmental change of NCAM isoforms in chick embryonic muscle (25.Yoshimi T. Mimura N. Aimoto S. Asano A. Cell Struct. Funct. 1993; 18: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Lectin blots using PNA, which is specific for O-linked Galβ1-3GalNAc, showed that the GPI + MSD isoform is O-glycosylated during days 2-8 (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, O-glycosylation of TM+MSD and soluble forms of NCAM were also observed. We then examined the transcription of NCAM mRNAs by RT-PCR. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that NCAM was expressed as both GPI-anchoring and transmembrane (TM) isoforms, and that both isoforms contain various forms of MSD insertion (Fig. 2C). At the onset of myoblast fusion at around day 2, MSD began to be transcribed, and the levels of NCAM isoforms with MSD insertion (abcK, abK, and a) gradually increased. To characterize polysialylated NCAM expressed in C2C12 cells, polysialic acid-containing glycoproteins were immunoprecipitated from [3H]glucosamine-labeled C2C12 cells at day 6. The anti-polysialic acid antibody 5A5 immunoprecipitated NCAM and a smaller molecule with relative molecular mass around 40 kDa (Fig. 2D, lane 1). Polysialic acid is attached to N-glycans, since it was released by N-glycanase digestion (Fig. 2D, lane 2). Polysialic acid is mostly attached to the transmembrane form, NCAM-140 (Fig. 2D, lanes 4 and 5). From these analyses, it can be concluded that the GPI+MSD isoform of NCAM is O-glycosylated during the fusion process, whereas polysialylation is restricted to the transmembrane form of NCAM that does not contain MSD.Fig. 2Expression of NCAM muscle-specific domain during in vitro differentiation of C2C12 cells.A, schematic structures of mouse NCAM. MSD is flanked by two fibronectin type III domains (FNIII) and encoded by four exons. Ig, immunoglobulin-like domains. B, total cell lysate was separated by SDS-PAGE before and after sialidase treatment and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blot was reacted with anti-NCAM antibody. O-glycans of immunoprecipitated NCAM were visualized using PNA. NCAM containing TM, MSD, GPI-anchored NCAM, and soluble NCAM (sol) are shown. C, RT-PCR of MSD and GPI-anchored and TM-containing NCAM during differentiation of C2C12 cells. abcK, abK, acK, a, and no correspond to those in A, D, lanes 1-3, C2C12 cells were metabolically labeled with [3H]glucosamine at days 5-6 and immunoprecipitated with anti-polysialic acid antibody. Aliquots were treated without (lane 1) or with N-glycanase (lane 2) or with endoneuroaminidase-N (lane 3). Fluorography of [3H]-glucosamine-labeled proteins after separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gels is shown. Lanes 4 and 5, total proteins of C2C12 cells immunoprecipitated with anti-polysialic antibody (lane 4) or total cell lysate (lane 5) were separated on SDS-PAGE, blotted, and reacted with anti-NCAM antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Abolition of MSD and Polysialic Acid on NCAM Differentially Alters Myoblast Fusion Rate—To examine the effect of NCAM glycosylation on myoblast fusion, we constructed NCAM mutants lacking N-glycosylation sites that are preferentially polysialylated, or O-glycosylation sites in the MSD (Fig. 3A). In our previous study, we found that the fourth, fifth and sixth N-glycosylation sites of NCAM are preferentially polysialylated (15.Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). On the other hand, from the results shown above (Fig. 2B) and from previous reports (4.Walsh F.S.

Angata K. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18182-18190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), it can be concluded that O-glycans are attached to the MSD. Therefore, based on the structure of GPI anchoring isoforms present in nature, we constructed cDNAs encoding chimeric proteins of NCAM with and without N-glycosylation sites for polysialylation and with and without the MSD (Fig. 3A). Stable cell lines expressing each NCAM isoform were established, and the expression of transfected human NCAM was confirmed by immunoblot (Fig. 3B) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. The results shown in Fig. 3C indicate that C2C12 cells expressing NCAM+MSD (M-) tend to fuse faster, forming elongated mature myotubes at day 5, than cells expressing NCAM without MSD (M-) when they do not contain polysialylated N-glycans (N-). By contrast, C2C12 cells expressing polysialylated NCAM (N+) tend to fuse more slowly, and fused cells form round and short myotubes. Graphical representation of these results (Fig. 3D) indicates that C2C12 cells expressing NCAM containing the MSD (M+) showed enhanced fusion, whereas this MSD activity is not prominent when N-glycan polysialylation sites are intact (N+). These results clearly demonstrate that the MSD on NCAM has a positive effect, whereas have N-glycans containing polysialic acid on NCAM have a negative effect on myoblast fusion.Fig. 3Effect of MSD and N-glycan polysialylation on C2C12 cell differentiation.A, schematic structure of NCAM with MSD (M+) or without MSD (M-) or w"

https://openalex.org/W1988644745,Certain characteristic patterns of physiologic sex determination are not causally linked with types of genic and chromosomal constitution (XX-XY or ZW-ZZ). The observed widespread but not universal parallelism in the distribution of genetic and physiologic patterns among vertebrate groups expresses genealogic relationship. On the basis of this interpretation one may estimate the approximate evolutionary age of the mechanism of genetic sex determination. It is concluded that in all tetrapod vertebrates these mechanisms originated during the Jurassic period. Environmental conditions seem to affect the progress of this evolution.

In this study, we identify another RNA-binding protein ElrA, the Xenopus homolog of HuR, as an interacting protein of xCIRP2 by yeast two-hybrid screening. As ElrA stabilizes the RNA body in the in vitro mRNA stability system, we examine the role of xCIRP2 in the stabilization of mRNA and find that xCIRP2 inhibits deadenylation of AU-rich element-containing mRNA. These results suggest that xCIRP2 and ElrA may be involved in the regulation of mRNA stability at different steps. By immunoprecipitation with anti-xCIRP2 antibody, we find that xCIRP2 interacts with several mRNAs including mRNA encoding the centrosomal kinase Nek2B in oocytes. xCIRP2 also inhibits deadenylation of the mRNA substrate containing the 3′-untranslated region of Nek2B mRNA in the in vitro system.

Our results suggest that xCIRP2 associates with specific mRNAs and can regulate the length of poly(A) tail in Xenopus oocytes. In Xenopus, a full-grown stage VI oocyte contains the large quantities of maternal mRNAs for later use, through oocyte maturation to the egg and during the cleavage divisions of early embryogenesis (1Davidson E.H. Gene Activity in Early Development. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1986Google Scholar, 2Dumont J.N. J. Morphol. 1972; 136: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). The process of Xenopus oogenesis, from stage I to stage VI, requires at least several months, and the mass of maternal mRNAs found in stage VI oocytes is already accumulated by the end of stage II. All maternal mRNAs are assembled into messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs), 1The abbreviations used are: mRNPmessenger ribonucleoprotein particleCIRPcold-inducible RNA-binding proteinxCIRP2Xenopus cold-inducible RNA-binding protein 2CPEcytoplasmic polyadenylation elementUTRuntranslated regionAREAU-rich elementeCPEembryonic cytoplasmic polyadenylation elementRRMRNA recognition motifGSTglutathione S-transferaseRT-PCRreverse transcriptase-mediated PCR.1The abbreviations used are: mRNPmessenger ribonucleoprotein particleCIRPcold-inducible RNA-binding proteinxCIRP2Xenopus cold-inducible RNA-binding protein 2CPEcytoplasmic polyadenylation elementUTRuntranslated regionAREAU-rich elementeCPEembryonic cytoplasmic polyadenylation elementRRMRNA recognition motifGSTglutathione S-transferaseRT-PCRreverse transcriptase-mediated PCR. most of which are stably stored for a long period of time in a translationally repressed state (3Spirin A.S. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1966; 1: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Elongation or shortening of poly(A) tail length at the 3′ end is an essential mechanism to regulate the translational activity of mRNA (4Sachs A. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 447-465Google Scholar, 5de Moor C.H. Richter J.D. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 203: 567-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In general, polyadenylation of a cytoplasmic mRNA leads to its translational up-regulation, whereas deadenylation reduces translational activity. Several translationally repressed mRNAs in Xenopus oocytes that contain a specific cis-element, the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE), in their 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) have short poly(A) in the oocytes (6Fox C.A. Sheets M.D. Wickens M.P. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2151-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 7McGrew L.L. Dworkin-Rastl E. Dworkin M.B. Richter J.D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Upon oocyte maturation, these mRNA receives elongated poly(A), which in turn results in translational activation. Molecular mechanisms mediated by specific association of a trans-acting factor CPEB with CPEs to regulate translational repression in oocytes and activation in matured oocytes have been extensively studied (5de Moor C.H. Richter J.D. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 203: 567-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hake L.E. Richter J.D.

Some of these mRNAs are again deadenylated in early embryos, also dependent on a specific element, the embryonic deadenylation element, in their 3′-UTR (11Bouvet P. Omilli F. Arlot-Bonnemains Y. Legagneux V. Roghi C. Bassez T. Osborne H.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1893-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Paillard L. Omilli F. Legagneux V. Bassez T. Maniey D. Osborne H.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). On the other hand, many housekeeping mRNAs that are actively translated in the oocytes become deadenylated upon maturation and possibly thereby translationally repressed (13Fox C.A. Wickens M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2287-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 14Varnum S.M. Wormington W.M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2278-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it is known that this deadenylation takes place as a default pathway (i.e. a pathway independent of specific cis-elements).Maintenance of poly(A) tail is important for mRNA stability, since mRNAs in eukaryotes are usually deadenylated before turnover of the body of the transcript. Deadenylation is the rate-limiting step of mRNA decay. It has been shown using in vitro systems that a major degradation pathway of the mRNA body following the deadenylation in higher eukaryotes is mediated by a complex of 3′-5′ exonucleases called the exosome (15Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34770-34774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Ong S.E. Chan E.L. Raijmakers R. Pruijn G.J. Stoecklin G. Moroni C.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). As described above for the translational control, it is well established that the lifetime of mRNA can also be specified by specific cis-acting elements within mRNA sequences. The most studied cis-acting elements are the AU-rich elements (AREs), usually found in the 3′-UTR of many short lived mRNAs encoding proto-oncogene products and cytokines (19Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). These AREs consist of reiterations of the AUUUA or oligo(U) sequences in an AU-rich context and are partly responsible for the rapid degradation of the mRNAs that contain them. Among a number of proteins that bind to the AREs, HuR has been identified as a trans-acting factor that stabilizes ARE-containing mRNAs (20Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Many studies have established that HuR up-regulates gene expression by stabilizing ARE-containing mRNAs in vitro and in vivo (21Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 22Peng S.S. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 23Ford L.P.

Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Xenopus homolog of HuR, ElrA, was identified as an RNA-binding protein that binds to a cis-acting element, the embryonic CPE or eCPE, required for cytoplasmic polyadenylation occurring during early embryogenesis (25Wu L. Good P.J. Richter J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6402-6409Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).We previously identified an RNA-binding protein, xCIRP2, which is highly expressed in Xenopus oocytes and eggs (26Matsumoto K. Aoki K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Tsujimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4689-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). xCIRP2 is a relatively small RNA-binding protein consisting of an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a C-terminal glycine-rich region. It is a homolog of mammalian cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP). The expression level of CIRP in cultured mouse cells increases upon temperature downshift, and CIRP mediates the cold-induced cell growth suppression presumably by prolonging the G1 phase of the cell cycle (27Nishiyama H. Itoh K. Kaneko Y. Kishishita M. Yoshida O. Fujita J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Although we previously demonstrated the cytoplasmic localization of xCIRP2 in stage VI oocytes and its possible association with ribosomes, its functional roles in oocytes and early embryos are still elusive (26Matsumoto K. Aoki K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Tsujimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4689-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recently, we revealed that xCIRP2 shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm when expressed in cultured cells (28Aoki K. Ishii Y. Matsumoto K. Tsujimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5182-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of how xCIRP2 is involved in RNA metabolism, a search for proteins and RNA interacting with it should be helpful. In this study, we identified ElrA as an xCIRP2-interacting protein. Using an in vitro mRNA stabilization system, we have shown that xCIRP2 inhibits deadenylation of ARE-containing mRNA substrate but not that of nonspecific substrates. By searching for mRNAs that interact with xCIRP2 in Xenopus oocytes, we identified several mRNAs including cyclin B1 and Nek2B mRNAs. Deadenylation of the mRNA substrate containing the Nek2B 3′-UTR sequence was inhibited by the addition of xCIRP2 protein in the in vitro system. Our results suggest that xCIRP2 participates in the regulation of mRNA stability or translational control in the oocytes, eggs, and early embryos.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast Two-hybrid Assay—Yeast two-hybrid screening for proteins that interact with xCIRP2 was performed as described previously (28Aoki K. Ishii Y. Matsumoto K. Tsujimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5182-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Recombinant Proteins—Overexpression and purification of the C-terminal His6-tagged xCIRP2 and glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion xCIRP2 were performed essentially as described previously, except that the purification was performed under native conditions (26Matsumoto K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5182-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The C-terminal His6-tagged FRGY2 protein was also prepared as described previously (26Matsumoto K. Aoki K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Tsujimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4689-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).A partial ElrA cDNA fragment was prepared by PCR from Xenopus oocyte total RNA and used as a probe to screen a Xenopus oocyte cDNA library (29Matsumoto K. Nagata K. Miyaji-Yamaguchi M. Kikuchi A. Tsujimoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6940-6952Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To obtain the C-terminal His6-tagged ElrA (ElrA-His6) protein, the ElrA coding sequence was amplified by PCR from ElrA cDNA with a primer set, CGGGATCCGATGTCTAACGGTTATGAAGATC and CGACCAGCGTCGACTTTGTGTGACTTGCTGGTTTTG. The PCR fragment was then digested with BamHI and SalI and cloned into pET24b vector (Novagen). Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with the resulting expression plasmid, and ElrA-His6 protein was overexpressed by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the bacterial culture. Bacterial cells were sonicated in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl), and the cell lysates were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was suspended in buffer A containing 6 m guanidine HCl and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science), followed by the application to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen). ElrA-His6 protein was eluted with buffer A containing 8 m urea and 100 mm imidazole and dialyzed against buffer A containing 4 m urea and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. To obtain GST-ElrA protein, the ElrA coding sequence was amplified by PCR from ElrA cDNA with a primer set, CGGGATCCATGTCTAACGGTTATGAAGATC and CGACCAGCGTCGACTTTGTGTGACTTGCTGGTTTTG. The PCR fragment was then digested with BamHI and SalI and cloned into pGEX 4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences). GST-ElrA protein was expressed in E. coli as above and purified using glutathione-Sepharose column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturer.GST Pull-down Assay—For the GST pull-down assay with purified recombinant proteins, ElrA-His6 protein was incubated with GST or GST-xCIRP2 bound to glutathione-Sepharose in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 1% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C for 1 h. After extensive washes with buffer B, the bound materials were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione.To determine the domains of ElrA interacting with xCIRP2, fulllength and deletion constructs of ElrA were generated by PCR amplification of the respective cDNA sequences and subcloning them into pTNT vector (Promega). ElrA proteins were expressed in the TNT-T7 quick coupled in vitro transcription-translation system (Promega) using each construct in the presence of [35S]methionine. GST pull-down assay using aliquots of the reactions was performed as above.Antibody Production, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Polyclonal antiserum against ElrA was produced following standard procedures by injecting a rabbit with the purified ElrA-His6, which had been renatured by dialysis against phosphate buffered-saline. Preparation of rabbit polyclonal antiserum containing antibodies against the recombinant xCIRP2 protein has been described (26Matsumoto K. Aoki K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Tsujimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4689-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).For immunoprecipitation, Xenopus oocytes were homogenized in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 100 mm KCl and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The oocyte lysates were incubated with anti-xCIRP2 antibody bound to protein A-agarose in buffer C containing 100 mm KCl at 4 °C for 30 min. After extensive washing with buffer C containing 175 mm KCl, the bound materials were analyzed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel.Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (29Matsumoto K. Nagata K. Miyaji-Yamaguchi M. Kikuchi A. Tsujimoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6940-6952Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum against the recombinant xCIRP2 protein, mouse anti-HuR monoclonal antibodies (3A2; Santa Cruz), and anti-His6 monoclonal antibodies (Clontech) were used as primary antibodies.Identification of xCIRP2 Targets—Immunoprecipitation of oocyte lysates with anti-xCIRP2 or anti-ElrA antibodies was performed as above, and the coprecipitated RNA was purified. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript Plasmid System (Invitrogen) and ligated to SalI- and NotI-digested pGEM-11Zf(+) vector (Promega). Individual clones were identified by DNA sequencing. The binding specificity of each mRNA to xCIRP2 or ElrA was determined by reverse transcriptase-mediated PCR (RT-PCR) using specific primer sets.In Vitro mRNA Stabilization Assay—To create pGEM-pA+ plasmid, oligonucleotides AGCTTA60TGCATTACCTCGAGCACTC and GAGTGCTCGAGGTAATGCAT60A were annealed, digested with NsiI, and inserted into HindIII- and NsiI-digested pGEM-11Zf(+). To prepare template DNA for ARE, NS1, and NS2 mRNAs, linkers (AGCTTCATTATTTATTATTTATTTATTATTTATTTATTTA, AGCTTCCCCAACGGGCCCTCCTCCCCTCCTTGCACCATCATCGCATCACGA, and AGCTTAAAGAAATCAATAGTAAACAAAGAATATCTAACGA, respectively) were inserted into HindIII-digested pGEM-pA+ in the sense orientation. A DNA fragment containing Nek2B 3′-UTR was amplified by PCR from Nek2B cDNA using a primer set, GCTCTAGAAGCTTTGTTTTTTGTTTCTGTGGGTAAC and GCTCTAGAAGCTTCACTTTAAAAAAACACAAC, digested with HindIII, and subcloned into HindIII-digested pGEM-pA+. The templates for in vitro mRNA synthesis were prepared by PCR from each plasmid using M13 forward and reverse primers and gel-purified. In vitro mRNA synthesis was performed using SP6 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion) in the presence of [α-32P]UTP, and the products were gel-purified.An in vitro mRNA stabilization assay was performed essentially as described by Ford et al. (23Ford L.P. Watson J. Keene J.D. Wilusz J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 188-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 fmol of mRNA was incubated at 30 °C in 14.25 μl of reaction mixture containing 0.88 mm ATP, 17.5 mm phosphocreatine, 500 ng of poly(A), and 8 μl of HeLa S100 fraction. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 90 μl of stop buffer (1.1 m ammonium acetate, 27.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 11 mm EDTA, 1.1% SDS, 0.44 mg/ml proteinase K, and 10 μg of tRNA) and further incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. The RNA was purified and analyzed in a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. Deadenylated mRNA as a marker was prepared by annealing the poly(A)60-tailed RNA with oligo(dT), followed by digestion with RNase H. The gel was dried and exposed to an imaging plate for analysis by a BioImaging Analyzer (BAS2500; Fuji Film).Gel Retardation Assay—Fifty fmol of mRNA was incubated with the recombinant xCIRP2 and ElrA at 30 °C for 10 min under the same conditions that were used for the in vitro mRNA stabilization assay, except that HeLa S100 fraction was omitted. The mixture was then electrophoresed in a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer at room temperature.RESULTSInteraction of xCIRP2 with ElrA—To explore cellular functions of xCIRP2, we tried to identify proteins interacting with it by yeast two-hybrid screening. As we reported previously, one of the positive clones encodes Xenopus protein arginine methyltransferase 1, which methylates the arginine- and glycine-rich region of xCIRP2 and thereby regulates its nucleocytoplasmic distribution (28Aoki K. Ishii Y. Matsumoto K. Tsujimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5182-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Another clone, 1.6.3, which was confirmed to interact with xCIRP2 bait, encoded an RNA-binding protein, ElrA (Fig. 1A). ElrA was originally isolated as one of cDNAs encoding Xenopus ELAV-like RNA-binding proteins (30Good P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4557-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). ElrA shows highest homology with mammalian HuR protein, the ubiquitously expressed member among ELAV-like proteins. The ElrA cDNA clone that we isolated by the two-hybrid screening included the partial sequence encoding amino acids 165-326, which deleted the N-terminal domain (data not shown).To confirm the results of the two-hybrid screening, we examined whether ElrA could directly interact with xCIRP2 by an in vitro binding assay. We prepared recombinant ElrA protein and performed a GST pull-down assay with GST and GST-xCIRP2 (Fig. 1B). In agreement with the results of the twohybrid assay, ElrA interacted with GST-xCIRP2 but not with GST. To determine whether xCIRP2 is indeed associated with ElrA in the oocytes, we conducted immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 1C). Previous experiments revealed that both xCIRP2 and ElrA proteins are present predominantly in the oocyte cytoplasm (25Wu L. Good P.J. Richter J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6402-6409Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26Matsumoto K. Aoki K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Tsujimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4689-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Xenopus oocyte lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-xCIRP2 antibodies. The presence of ElrA was examined by subsequent immunoblotting with anti-HuR antibodies. ElrA was coimmunoprecipitated when anti-xCIRP2 antibody was used but not when preimmune serum was used for immunoprecipitation. We therefore concluded that ElrA could interact with xCIRP2 both in vitro and in vivo.Mapping of the Domain of ElrA Involved in Interaction with xCIRP2—ElrA/HuR contains three RRMs and the hinge region located between its second and third RRMs (Fig. 2A). To determine the xCIRP2-binding region of ElrA, we performed a GST pull-down assay using several deletion mutants of ElrA. Fulllength ElrA and ElrAΔN containing the hinge region and RRM3 bound to GST-xCIRP2 (Fig. 2B). In contrast, ElrAΔC and ElrAΔRRM3 did not bind to GST-xCIRP2. These results suggest that RRM3 of ElrA is required for the complex formation with xCIRP2. These findings are consistent with the results of yeast two-hybrid screening in which the ElrA cDNA clone containing the hinge region and RRM3 was isolated.Fig. 2RRM3 of ElrA is involved in interaction with xCIRP2.A, schematic diagrams of ElrA deletion mutants used for mapping of the domain involved in interaction with xCIRP2. B, ElrA deletion mutants were synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine. Each reaction mixture was incubated with GST or GST-xCIRP2 bound to glutathione-Sepharose. The bound materials were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (lanes 1-8). An aliquot of each reaction was electrophoresed in parallel (lanes 9-12).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)xCIRP2 Inhibits Deadenylation of ARE-containing mRNA in the in Vitro Stabilization System—ElrA shows high homology to Drosophila ELAV and mammalian Hu proteins. It has been established that binding of mammalian Hu proteins to ARE of mRNA results in the RNA stabilization both in vivo and in vitro (21Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 24Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Therefore, identification of ElrA as a protein interacting with xCIRP2 prompted us to test whether xCIRP2 could be involved in the turnover of ARE-containing mRNAs. To test this possibility, we employed an in vitro mRNA stabilization system using HeLa cell S100 extract, which was developed by Ford et al. (23Ford L.P. Watson J. Keene J.D. Wilusz J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 188-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In this system, the general pathways and many of the regulatory aspects of mRNA degradation can be reproduced (18Mukherjee D. Gao M. O'Connor J.P. Raijmakers R. Pruijn G. Lutz C.S. Wilusz J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 31Gao M. Fritz D.T. Ford L.P. Wilusz J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The rate of both deadenylation and degradation of exogenous capped and polyadenylated RNA substrates is up-regulated by the presence of ARE in the body of the RNA substrates (23Ford L.P. Watson J. Keene J.D. Wilusz J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 188-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).First we examined the effects of xCIRP2 protein on the stability of an artificial RNA substrate containing ARE, which is derived from tumor necrosis factor α mRNA, with a poly(A)60 tail (Fig. 3). By incubating in S100 extract supplemented with ATP, the ARE-A60 RNA was first deadenylated, and then the body of the RNA substrate was degraded (Fig. 3A). The addition of xCIRP2 in this system resulted in the inhibition of deadenylation in a dose-dependent manner (e.g. compare lanes 2, 4, and 6 in Fig. 3A). As shown previously with Hu proteins (23Ford L.P. Watson J. Keene J.D. Wilusz J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 188-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), ElrA failed to affect deadenylation of the ARE-A60 RNA but stabilized the deadenylated RNA (Fig. 3B; also see Fig. 4). Another RNA-binding protein, FRGY2, did not affect either deadenylation or degradation of the ARE-A60 RNA. Although FRGY2 belongs to the Y-box protein family, whose members are involved in general and specific mRNA stabilization, we did not observe any protective roles of FRGY2 in this system. These results indicate that xCIRP2 stabilizes mRNA by inhibiting deadenylation.Fig. 3xCIRP2 inhibits deadenylation of ARE-containing mRNA in the in vitro stabilization system.A, ARE-A60 RNA was prepared by in vitro transcription in the presence of [α-32P]UTP. AREA60 RNA was then incubated in the in vitro mRNA stability system in the presence of the increasing amounts of xCIRP2 for the times indicated (lanes 1-7). RNA products were purified and analyzed in a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. ARE-A0 RNA was prepared and electrophoresed in parallel (lane 8). The positions of ARE-A60 and ARE-A0 RNA are indicated. B, ARE-A60 RNA was incubated in the in vitro system in the presence of 0.5 μm xCIRP2, ElrA, or FRGY2 for the times indicated (lanes 1-9). RNA was analyzed as above. ARE-A0 RNA was electrophoresed in parallel (lane 10). C, ARE-A60 RNA (lanes 1-4) and two unrelated RNAs with an A60 tail (NS1, lanes 5-8; NS2, lanes 9-12) were incubated in the in vitro system in the presence of increasing amounts of xCIRP2 for 0 or 60 min. RNA was analyzed as above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4ElrA and xCIRP2 cooperate to stabilize mRNA.A, ARE-A60 RNA was incubated in the in vitro mRNA stability system in the presence of 0.5 μm xCIRP2 and ElrA for the times indicated. RNA products were purified and analyzed in a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. The positions of ARE-A60 and ARE-A0 RNA are indicated. Radioactivity of RNA in the range between ARE-A60 and the ARE-A0, indicated by a bracket on the left, was quantified. Relative values normalized by the value of time 0 (lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10) as 100% are shown at the bottom. B, ARE-A60 RNA was incubated in the in vitro system in the presence of increasing amounts of xCIRP2 and 0.5 μm ElrA for 0 h (lane 1) or 3 h (lanes 2-6). RNA was analyzed as above. ARE-A0 RNA was prepared and electrophoresed in parallel (lane 7).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To test the sequence requirement of the RNA substrate for the inhibitory effect of xCIRP2, we compared degradation of ARE-A60 RNA with that of nonspecific transcripts that lack AREs but possess the 5′-cap and 3′-poly(A)60 tail (Fig. 3C). During a 60-min incubation, ARE and nonspecific RNAs were similarly degraded, and the deadenylated intermediate was detected. Remarkably, inhibition of deadenylation by xCIRP2 was only observed with ARE-A60 RNA. xCIRP2 barely affected the stability and deadenylation of nonspecific RNAs. These data suggest that xCIRP2 specifically inhibited deadenylation of ARE-containing mRNA in this in vitro system.ElrA and xCIRP2 Cooperate to Stabilize mRNA—The results with ARE-A60 RNA imply that xCIRP2 inhibited deadenylation, whereas ElrA stabilized the deadenylated RNA (Fig. 3B), suggesting that these proteins are involved in stabilization of ARE-A60 RNA at distinct steps. We next examined RNA stabilization by the addition of both xCIRP2 and ElrA into the in vitro system (Fig. 4). For this set of experiments, we used another batch of HeLa S100 extract than that used in the previous experiments, in order to clarify the effect of ElrA on stabilization of deadenylated RNA. This extract shows relatively slow deadenylation activity, but no accumulation of deadenylated RNA was observed without exogenous ElrA protein (e.g. compare Fig. 4A, lane 3, with Fig. 3A, lane 3). Consistent with the data shown above, xCIRP2 inhibited the deadenylation in this extract as well. When radioactivity of RNA in the range between ARE-A60 and the deadenylated ARE (AREA0) was quantified to measure the stability of the mRNA, xCIRP2 seemed to modestly affect the RNA stability. Our results suggest that RNA that had once escaped from the inhibitory effect of xCIRP2 on deadenylation could be degraded in the absence of exogenous ElrA. When ElrA was added to the system, deadenylated RNA was acc"

We have determined the crystal structures of Rpi from Thermus thermophilus HB8 in complex with the open chain form of the substrate R5P and the open chain form of the C2 epimeric inhibitor arabinose-5-phosphate as well as the apo form at high resolution. The crystal structures of both complexes revealed that these ring-opened epimers are bound in the active site in a mirror symmetry binding mode. The O1 atoms are stabilized by an oxyanion hole composed of the backbone amide nitrogens in the conserved motif. In the structure of the Rpi·R5P complex, the conversion moiety O1-C1-C2-O2 in cis-configuration interacts with the carboxyl oxygens of Glu-108 in a water-excluded environment. Furthermore, the C2 hydroxyl group is presumed to be highly polarized by short hydrogen bonding with the side chain of Lys-99. R5P bound as the ring-opened reaction intermediate clarified the high stereoselectivity of the catalysis and is consistent with an aldose-ketose conversion by Rpi that proceeds via a cis-enediolate intermediate.

Rpi acts as a key enzyme in the oxidative pentose-phosphate cycle where it catalyzes the reversible conversion of ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) to ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P). Rpi additionally plays a central role in the reductive pentose-phosphate cycle (Calvin cycle) of photosynthetic organisms. Rpi catalyzes the final step of the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate into ribose-5-phosphate, which is required for the synthesis of nucleotides. It also converts R5P to Ru5P in the final step to regenerate ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate as the acceptor of CO2 in the Calvin cycle. In the non-oxidative pathway of the pentose-phosphate cycle, R5P is the precursor of 5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate, which is utilized for syntheses of amino acids such as histidine and tryptophan, purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, and NAD (1.Hove-Jensen B. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1148-1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Ru5P is the riboflavin precursor (2.Volk R. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20610-20618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the Calvin cycle, it has been shown that Rpi forms a functional multienzyme complex with five other enzymes, including ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), to catalyze the consecutive reactions on chloroplast thylakoid membranes in situ (3.Suss K.H. Arkona C. Manteuffel R. Adler K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5514-5518Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The direction of the reaction catalyzed by Rpi is essentially driven by the R5P and Ru5P concentrations. ribose-5-phosphate isomerase Thermus thermophilus rpi ribose-5-phosphate arabinose-5-phosphate ribulose-5-phosphate triosephosphate isomerase phosphoglucose isomerase selenomethionine 2-(N-formyl-N-hydroxy)-aminoethylphosphate dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The catalytic mechanism of Rpi (Fig. 1A) is believed to initiate with a ring opening of the substrate followed by isomerization of the open chain form. Isotope exchange studies have suggested that the isomerization between ketose and aldose by triosephosphate isomerase (TIM), phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), and Rpi involves a proton transfer between the C1 and C2 positions of the substrate via the cis-enediol(ate) intermediate (4.Rose I.A. Edward L.O.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 42: 159-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 5.Topper Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 225: 419-425Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The transferred proton in catalysis remains on the same side of the plane in the enediol(ate) structure (6.Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman, New York1999: 251-252Google Scholar). Then, the proton abstracted by a single base is given back to the C1 or C2 position, resulting in the conversion of Ru5P to R5P and vice versa (Fig. 1A). Recently, the crystal structures of Escherichia coli Rpi in both the apo form and in complex with the β-anomer furanose form of arabinose-5-phosphate (A5P) have been determined (7.Rangarajan E.S. Sivaraman J. Matte A. Cygler M. Proteins. 2002; 48: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 8.Zhang R. Andersson C.E. Savchenko A. Skarina T. Evdokimova E. Beasley S. Arrowsmith C.H. Edwards A.M. Joachimiak A. Mowbray S.L. Structure. 2003; 11: 31-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Based on this structure, a ring-opening mechanism was proposed. In addition, the crystal structures of a tetrameric Rpi from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Pyrococcus horikoshii in the apo form and in complex with the inhibitor 4-phosphoerythronic acid have also been reported and have elucidated aspects of the thermostability of this protein (25.Ishikawa K.

However, to date, there is little structural information on the aldose-ketose isomerization mechanism of Rpi. Here we report on the first crystal structures of Rpi from the extreme thermophile, Thermus thermophilus HB8, in complex with the ring-opened form of substrate R5P at 2-Å resolution and the open chain form of the C2 epimer inhibitor A5P (Fig. 1B) at 1.7-Å resolution (hereafter referred to as the ttRpi·R5P and ttRpi·A5P complexes, respectively) as well as the apo form at 1.8-Å resolution. The high resolution crystal structure of ttRpi·R5P complex suggests that the isomerization of Rpi proceeds via a cis-enediolate intermediate with the negatively charged O1 (Fig. 1C) stabilized by the oxyanion hole. Protein Expression and Purification—Rpi with selenium-substituted methionine (SeMet) was prepared for structural determination by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) phasing. The plasmid pET-11a (Novagen), which carries a gene encoding ttRpi under the T7 promoter, was supplied from the RIKEN Structurome Project (Kuramitsu and Yokoyama). The protein was over-expressed in the methionine auxotrophic E. coli strain B834(DE3)plysS (Novagen) grown in LeMaster medium with SeMet. After cell disruption (14 g) and removal of debris by centrifugation, the supernatant was heat-treated at 70 °C in 11.5 min. Then, ttRpi was purified with the SuperQ Toyopearl (Tosoh), Resource Q (Amersham Biosciences), and hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) column chromatography and followed by a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences). Twenty-nine milligrams of purified protein was obtained. The sample showed a single band at 24 kDa on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and was also verified with N-terminal sequence analysis. Rpi in solution was detected as a homo-dimer with Superose 12 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration and dynamic light scattering (Protein Solution) analysis. The native proteins used in the R5P-bound complex were purified and verified in a similar way as the SeMet proteins. Enzymatic Characterization—Reversible isomerization (R5P to Ru5P) enzymatic activity was observed from the absorption changes at 290 nm as described previously by Wood (9.Wood T. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 33: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contains 5 nm Rpi, 0.1 m NaCl, and 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5). The increase of absorption was measured using R5P (Fluka) ranging from 0.5 to 30 mm at 50 °C. The kinetic parameters were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots and obtained by averaging three independent measurements. The inhibition by A5P was assayed at 50 °C in assay solution containing the various concentrations of A5P. The Ki value was calculated from Dixon plots. Crystallization and Data Collections—The screening of the crystallization conditions of SeMet Rpi was performed with the oil batch method (10.Chayen N.E. Shaw-Stewart P.D. Maeder D.L. Blow D.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 23: 297-302Crossref Google Scholar) using the recently developed fully automatic protein crystallization and observation system “TERA” installed at the Highthroughput Factory at RIKEN Harima institute (11.Sugahara M. Miyano M. Tanpakushitsu Kakusan Koso. 2002; 47: 1026-1032PubMed Google Scholar). The crystals were obtained from a solution containing 10 mg/ml protein, 27.5% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), and 1 m LiCl. The crystals grew within 1 week at 18 °C. Crystals were flash-cooled in the cryoprotectant 20% (v/v) glycerol. X-ray diffraction data of the crystals was collected at 100 K up to 1.8 Å resolution using a charged coupled area detector (Rigaku Jupitor 210) at the beam line BL45XU-PX (12.Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Fujisawa T. Ueki T. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 1998; 5: 222-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) at SPring-8. The wavelength was set to 0.900 Å (remote), 0.9791 Å (peak), and 0.9795 Å (edge) with a crystal-detector distance of 200 mm. The crystals belonged to the space group C2221 with the unit-cell parameters a = 62.10 Å, b = 61.97 Å, and c = 131.34 Å and one molecule in the asymmetric unit with a Vm value (13.Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7926) Google Scholar) of 2.6 Å3/Da. Crystals of R5P- or A5P-bound Rpi were obtained after soaking native or SeMet derivative crystals in solution containing 10 mm R5P (Fluka) or 10 mm A5P (Sigma), for 14 h at 15 °C. Data collections of two complexes were performed at a wavelength of 1 Å. The crystals of ttRpi·R5P and ttRpi·A5P complexes were isomorphous compared with unsoaked crystal and diffracted to 2- and 1.7-Å resolution, respectively. All diffraction images were processed, integrated, and scaled using the program HKL2000 (14.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38609) Google Scholar). Structural Determination and Refinement—All selenium sites except for the N-terminal were found and refined, and initial phases were calculated with the programs SOLVE (15.Terwilliger T.C.

Water molecules were assigned during refinement, and chloride ions were identified as judged by peak heights and positions in the electron density map. The final model of the apo form has a working R factor of 19.2% and a free R factor of 21.5% at 1.8-Å resolution. Ten percent of the data set was selected for free R factor calculations. The crystal structures of the ttRpi·R5P and ttRpi·A5P complexes were solved by the molecular replacement method with the program AMoRe (20.Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) using the apo form structure as the search model. The ligand models generated using the program Quanta (Accelrys) were fitted initially to electron density maps with coefficients Fo–Fc. Refinement of the ttRpi·R5P complex was performed at 2-Å resolution with a working R factor of 18.8% and a free R factor of 23.9%. The ttRpi·A5P complex was finally refined at a resolution of 1.7 Å to a working R factor of 20.0% and a free R factor of 21.5%. The model quality for the three structures was verified by the program PROCHECK (21.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

The kinetic parameters of ttRpi in the forward reaction using R5P as the substrate at 50 °C were kcat of 1072 ± 78 s-1, Km of 1.63 ± 0.24 m, and kcat/Km of (6.64 ± 0.91) × 105m-1 s-1. The Ki value was 0.89 ± 0.14 mm. The enzyme characteristics are consistent with those reported previously for E. coli and spinach Rpis. Overall Structure of ttRpi—The crystal structure demonstrated that ttRpi exists as a homo-dimer (Fig. 2A), which is consistent with the molecular weights determined for the protein in solution by both gel filtration (Mr = 47,300) and dynamic light scattering measurement (Mr = 50,000). The two monomers are related by a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry. The close interaction between the two monomers is stabilized by two chloride ions (Fig. 2A). There are also many hydrophobic interactions, four side chain salt bridges between the side chains of Arg-193 and Glu-197 and between Asp-75 and Arg-146, and a water molecule-mediated hydrogen bond network. The buried solvent-accessible surface is 2,547 Å2 as calculated using the program GRASP (24.Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). Each monomer of ttRpi (Fig. 2B) is composed of two α/β domains with dimensions of ∼45 Å × 35 Å × 25 Å as seen in E. coli and P. horikoshii Rpis (7.Rangarajan E.S. Sivaraman J. Matte A. Cygler M. Proteins. 2002; 48: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 8.Zhang R. Andersson C.E. Savchenko A. Skarina T. Evdokimova E. Beasley S. Arrowsmith C.H. Edwards A.M. Joachimiak A.

Roussel A. Structure. 2002; 10: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The larger domain (residues 3–130 and 206–227) comprises a seven-stranded mixed β-sheet formed by six parallel (S3, S2, S1, S4, S7, and S13) and one anti-parallel β-strands (S14), four α helices (H1–4), and a three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (S5, S6, and S12). The active site is located within the larger domain with the architecture formed by loops S1-H2, S4-S5, and S6-H4 and H4. The small domain consists of a four-stranded, anti-parallel β-sheet (S9, S11, S8, and S12) and two helices (H5 and H6). The structure of the larger domain of ttRpi is overlaid with those of E. coli and P. horikoshii with root mean square deviations of 1.3 Å for 140 Cα and 1.2 Å for 150 Cα, respectively. When the larger domains are superimposed, the small domain of ttRpi moves substantially with respect to the larger domain by a 3-Å shift of the H5 helix. The Active Site Architecture with an Oxyanion Hole—Three highly conserved motifs (Fig. 2C) form the active site, i.e. the phosphate (P) and sugar (S) recognition motifs as well as the catalytic (C) motif over all the organisms. The P-, S-, and C-motifs are located in the loops of S1-H2, S4-S5, and S6-H4, respectively (Fig. 2, B and C). The active cavity is shallow and binds the dehydrated pentose-phosphates without any water molecules around C1 to C3 in both complex structures (Figs. 3 and 4, B and C). Most of the molecular surfaces of the ligand binding cavity are negatively charged with a noticeable positive patch formed by Lys-9 and Lys-126, which are important for allowing accommodation of the negatively charged phosphate moiety (Fig. 3). In the apo ttRpi structure, a chloride ion (Cl- in Fig. 2B) is bound at the bottom of the active site cavity. The side chains of the residues positioned within the active site, including Asp-86, Asp-89, Lys-99, Glu-108, and Glu-112, form hydrogen bond networks with 10 bound water molecules (Fig. 4, A and D). The bound chloride anion interacts with five backbone amide nitrogens (Gly-100 to Leu-105) located at the center of the C-motif, the most conserved stretch of amino acids among the Rpis. Distances between the chloride anion and the amide nitrogens are in the range of 3.3–4.2 Å. Thus, this loop makes an oxyanion hole to stabilize the negatively charged atoms of the reaction intermediate during catalysis (Fig. 1A). Moreover, both the carboxyl oxygen atoms of Glu-108 form a bidentate interaction with the chloride ion (3 Å and 3.7 Å). Bound R5P Interaction as Reaction Intermediate—In the structure of ttRpi·R5P complex, an extended ring-opened form of R5P provided the best fit to the electron density. This conformation differs from the ring-closed furanose form of A5P observed in the E. coli Rpi·A5P complex structure (Figs. 3 and 4, B and E). The torsion angle of O1-C1-C2-O2 of R5P is almost 0°, and it may represent the cis-enediolate intermediate (Fig. 1A). Contrarily, that of A5P is 93°. However, the possibility cannot be excluded that other forms, including aldose and/or ketose in addition to the enediolate, contribute to the electron density map of R5P, because we could not determine very accurate geometric parameters of the form of R5P from the 2-Å resolution data due to the model bias of the crystallographic refinement. In the best refined current model, the C1-O1, C2-O2, and C1-C2 bond lengths of R5P are 1.37, 1.39, and 1.51 Å, respectively, whereas those of A5P are 1.19, 1.38, and 1.61 Å. The atoms of O1-C1-C2(-O2)-C3 of R5P are in a plane with the bond angles of C1-C2-C3 (113°), C1-C2-O2 (124°), and C3-C2-O2 (123°), suggesting that the C2 orbital acquires hybridization between sp2 (120°) and sp3 (109.5°), whereas those of A5P are obviously in off-plane with the bond angles of C1-C2-C3 (115°), C1-C2-O2 (108°), and C3-C2-O2 (108°). The O1 atom of the bound R5P displaces the chloride ion from the oxyanion hole with distances between backbone amide nitrogens and O1 of 3.5 Å (Gly-100), 3.5 Å (Gly-102), 3.4 Å (Gly-103), 3 Å (Ala-104), and 3.6 Å (Leu-105). A prominent feature of the interaction between ttRpi and R5P is that the O1 of R5P should carry either a full or partial negative charge. Another notable feature is the interaction between both the carboxyl groups of Glu-108 and O1-C1-C2-O2 of the bound R5P. The Oϵ2 carboxyl oxygen of Glu-108 is unusually close to both C1 (3.3 Å) and C2 (3.2 Å), whereas Oϵ1 forms hydrogen bond interactions with O1 (3.1 Å) and O2 (2.8 Å) (Fig. 4E). The O2 oxygen of the bound R5P forms the short hydrogen bond with the side chain of Lys-99 (2.5 Å) as well as the backbone amide nitrogen of Gly-100 (3.0 Å). The distances between atoms indicate a tight C–H···O hydrogen bond between C1-C2 and the syn orbital of Oϵ2, including the putative hydrogen attached to C2 of R5P. This close interaction suggests the idea that Glu-108 acts in the proton transfer from C2 to C1 in the active site. Although the negatively charged end of R5P requires Rpi to have the most conserved residues, the O3 and O4 atoms of R5P are recognized by Asp-86 and Asp-89 (S-motif) and Lys99 (C-motif) (Fig. 4, B and E). The O3 oxygen atom forms hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Lys-99 (3 Å) and Asp-86 (3.1 Å) and the backbone carbonyl of Thr-30 in the P-motif (2.7 Å) (Fig. 4, B and E). O4 also interacts with Asp-89 (2.7 Å), the backbone amide nitrogen of Gly-102 (3.4 Å) of the C-motif, and the water molecule W1 (2.6 Å). Binding Mode of the C2 Epimer Inhibitor A5P—As for the ttRpi·R5P structure, it was possible to fit an extended ring-opened form of A5P to the electron density with the O1 atom situated in the oxyanion hole (Fig. 4, C and F). The O2 of the inhibitor is recognized similarly to the O2 of R5P forming hydrogen bonds with both the carboxyl oxygens of Glu-108 and the amino nitrogen of the Lys-99 side chain. The binding mode of A5P displays an inverse conformation with respect to R5P so that the interactions with O3 and O4 differ. The O4 and O3 of A5P form hydrogen bond interactions with the side chains of Asp-86 and Asp-89, respectively. Recognition of the Phosphate Group of C2 Epimers, R5P and A5P—The phosphate groups of both C2 epimers, R5P and A5P, bind at identical positions in ttRpi and are recognized by residues of the P-motif. The recognition manner of the phosphate group of the ligands is similar and involves hydrogen bonds to ordered water molecules bound at the same positions in both complex structures (Fig. 4, B and C). The phosphate group of R5P or A5P is situated at the N terminus of the H2 helix (Fig. 2, B and C), and a positive dipole moment from this helix may stabilize the negative charge of the phosphate group. The phosphate group of R5P or A5P forms direct hydrogen bonds with the side"

(3)). Preliminary experiments by the inverse carrier isotope dilution technique (4,5) indicated that 6-hydroxy-2-FAA might also be a metabolite of 2-FAA, since a sample retained radioactivity even after repeated crystallizations and conversion to derivatives. However, in view of the close similarity of the various hydroxylated metabolites of 2-FAA, it was possible that this finding constituted an artifact owing to cocrystallization. An unambiguous demonstration that 6-hydroxy-a-FAA was actually produced by rats injected with 2-FAA was therefore desirable. This was achieved by modifying the usual technique (1) for separating the metabolites of 2-FAA by the use of a long column (approximately 2 meters) of silicic acid. Systematic examination by ultraviolet spectroscopy of the fractions obtained in this fashion revealed one with the characteristic features of the spectrum of 6-hydroxy-2-FAA. Carrier crystallization subsequently proved definitely that this sample contained 6-hydrosy-a-FAA, thereby establishing that this compound was a metabolite of 2-FAA in rats."

https://openalex.org/W2144647581,"The two leitmotifs of my scientific research were synthetic polymeric models of proteins and the structure of proteins as reflected by the three-dimensional conformation controlled by their amino acid sequence. This in turn led me to synthetic polypeptide antigens and to investigation of antibodies, ultimately resulting in the discovery of the determinant-specific genetic control of immune response and to the development of a therapeutic vaccine against the exacerbating-remitting form of multiple sclerosis. In protein chemistry I had two great teachers who became very close friends, Ephraim Katchalski-Katzir and Christian B. Anfinsen (Fig. 1), but in immunology I lacked the benefit of a great mentor, and so to some extent I was self-taught. Thus, I had to “figure out” many things myself. In my childhood I grew up in the courtyard of a textile factory, and I later intended to study fibers, mainly the new synthetic ones. However, I first started studying macromolecules when, as a Ph.D. student, in 1950 I joined the laboratory of Ephraim Katchalski at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Ephraim first synthesized polylysine in the early 1940s and was successfully exploring the use of polyamino acids as protein models. With his collaborators he prepared and studied many physical, chemical, and biological properties of several polymers of trifunctional amino acids such as polyarginine, polyaspartic acid, polyhistidine, and polyserine, as well as the polyamino acids polyproline and polyhydroxyproline (1.Katchalski E. Sela M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1958; 13: 243-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 2.Sela M. Katchalski E. Adv. Protein Chem. 1959; 14: 391-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Among the early syntheses was the one of poly-l-tyrosine, which was part of the subject of my Ph.D. thesis. My thesis research included also the synthesis of poly-3,5-diiodotyrosine and poly-p-amino-l-phenylalanine. Later on I was directly involved with the synthesis of polytryptophan and polycyclohexylalanine. Of special interest was the spectrophotometric titration of polytyrosine and of copolymers of tyrosine with positively or negatively charged amino acids; this showed the influence of the vicinal electrostatic field on the ease of ionization of the phenolic hydroxyl groups (2.Sela M. Katchalski E. Adv. Protein Chem. 1959; 14: 391-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 3.Sela M. Katchalski E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1956; 78: 3986-3989Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We were very touched when John Edsall included figures from this study in his book Biophysical Chemistry with Jeffreys Wyman. Actually Proteins, Peptides and Amino Acids as Dipolar Ions (Cohn and Edsall's book) served as a basis for intense seminars with both of the Katchalski-Katzir brothers, Ephraim and Aharon. The accent was on physicochemical properties of proteins, polyamino acids, and polyelectrolytes in general. Ephraim was a remarkable teacher—stimulating, inspiring, patient, and always friendly. Today I still cherish his friendship. For the preparation of poly-l-tyrosine, I remember that I tried 40 times to synthesize the monomer, N-carboxy-O-benzyloxycarbonyl-l-tyrosine anhydride, before I was successful. This taught me the need for perseverance and optimism in research. Of course, serendipity (defined as luck meeting the prepared mind) also helps. I mention this because much of the story that follows actually depended on the availability of this monomer (4.Katchalski E. Sela M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1953; 75: 5284-5289Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). My first paper was on the titration of N-carboxy-α-amino acid anhydrides in nonaqueous solvents (5.Berger A. Sela M. Katchalski E. Anal. Chem. 1953; 25: 1554-1555Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These are the monomers in the synthesis of amino acid polymers, and the titration was useful for the determination of unreacted anhydride at any instant. My Ph.D. thesis was on the azo derivatives of some aromatic poly-α-amino acids (6.Sela M. Katchalski E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955; 77: 3662-3663Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). One could even diazotize poly-p-aminophenylalanine and couple it to polymers containing tyrosine, resulting in colored water-insoluble compounds. I shall describe later how the work with polyamino acids brought me into immunology. What I would like to mention here is that we could use as initiators of polymerization of N-carboxyamino acid anhydrides (the monomers from which polyamino acids were built) not only monofunctional small molecules but also macromolecules possessing several amino groups. If proteins were used as such polyvalent initiators, we ended up with polypeptidyl proteins, whereas when polylysine or polyornithine were used, we had for the first time multichain polyamino acids, which became so important for me later as synthetic antigens. Mark Stahmann also prepared such polypeptidyl proteins in Wisconsin. We summarized in Advances in Protein Chemistry in 1958 (1.Katchalski E. Sela M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1958; 13: 243-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and 1959 (2.Sela M. Katchalski E. Adv. Protein Chem. 1959; 14: 391-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) the early studies on the synthesis and the chemical and biological properties of poly-α-amino acids. In 1955 I was back in Europe as a young scientist presenting the work on multichain polyamino acids at the International Congress of Chemistry in Zurich, and a week later, the work on spectrophotometric titration of polymers and copolymers of amino acids at the International Congress of Biochemistry in Bruxelles. This was a wonderful occasion to meet scientists whom until then I had known only by reputation and through their papers. Among the many I want to mention two, Hans Neurath and Bill Harrington, who later became close friends of mine. During the same trip I went to see Sir Charles Harington in London. Harington was the man who elucidated the structure of thyroxine and predicted that it is formed from two diiodotyrosine residues by oxidation rather than simple dismutation. I wanted to tell him that the availability of polytyrosine had permitted us (7.Sela M. Sarid S. Nature. 1956; 178: 540-541Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) to find out that, following alkaline incubation of iodinated polytyrosine, the hydrolysate contained 2% thyroxine and 2% serine. We had, thus, proved the validity of his prediction. Later I shall discuss our work on linear and multichain polyamino acids as synthetic polypeptide antigens, but now I want to mention that ultimately we developed a therapeutic drug/vaccine against the exacerbating-remitting stage of multiple sclerosis, denoted copolymer 1, named glatiramer acetate and Copaxone by the industry. This drug, approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1996 and used by tens of thousands of patients, is the first polymeric drug/vaccine in which the active ingredient is the polymer itself, in contrast to polymers used earlier in pharmacopeia for slow release of drugs or for wrapping them. As a result of studying the mechanism of polymerization of N-carboxyamino acid anhydrides with Arieh Berger, I was involved in an interesting story that I want to relate here while discussing polyamino acids. On my second visit to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1960, Marshall Nirenberg came one day and asked me whether I had some poly-l-phenylalanine and whether I knew its solubility properties. I did not have the polymer in Bethesda, but I did ask Nirenberg why he was interested. Through these conversations I became one of the first to know about the breaking of the genetic code, UUU encoding Phe. Although I was somewhat skeptical of the story, I immediately looked for and found, hidden somewhere in an experimental section of a paper in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, that poly-l-phenylalanine was insoluble in all the solvents we had tested with the exception of a saturated solution of anhydrous hydrogen bromide in glacial acetic acid (8.Sela M. Berger A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955; 77: 1893-1898Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because on that very day I was preparing just such a solution (used to remove carbobenzoxy groups) in the laboratory, I gladly gave the reagent to Nirenberg and was touched and surprised when he acknowledged this in the classical paper that resulted in his receiving the Nobel Prize. The real point of the story lies elsewhere. Why did we try to use such a peculiar solvent? The truth of the matter is that years earlier, together with the late Arieh Berger in Rehovot, we were investigating the mechanism of polymerization leading to linear and multichain polyamino acids. One day I had two test tubes, one with polyphenylalanine and one with polycarbobenzoxylysine, stuck in a beaker on my desk. Arieh came to decarbobenzoxylate the lysine polymer, a reaction with hydrogen bromide in glacial acetic acid during which carbon dioxide is released. He took the wrong test tube away with him and returned, puzzled because the material had dissolved and he could not see any evolution of carbon dioxide. At once we realized the mistake and I noted in my laboratory book that, at long last, we had found a solvent for poly-l-phenylalanine. After 5 years of working with protein models, I felt ready to go abroad for a postdoctoral period to work with proteins. Thus, I arrived in 1956 in the laboratory of Chris Anfinsen at the NIH in Bethesda. The friendship between us resulted in prolonged stays in Bethesda in 1956–1957, 1960–1961, and 1973–1974. On his part, Chris came to Rehovot on sabbaticals on several occasions and was an active, extremely valuable member of the Board of Governors of the Weizmann Institute of Science, serving for many years as the Chairman of its Scientific Advisory Committee. His death in May 1995 was for me personally a deeply felt loss. Chris was a great friend, helpful to all those who surrounded him, full of charm and modesty, and actually a great romantic. From the NIH we sent out our first joint paper, which Chris was in a hurry to prepare for a Festschrift honoring Linderstrom-Lang. The topic was the selective splitting of protein chains by trypsin at arginine residues after lysine residues were reversibly blocked by carbobenzoxy groups. Oxidative opening of the four disulfide bridges of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease to permit its sequencing was possible only because tryptophan was absent in this protein. A more general method, which could be used also for a protein containing tryptophan, such as lysozyme, was reductive cleavage, followed by blocking of the sulfhydryl groups with iodoacetic acid (9.Sela M. White Jr., F.H. Anfinsen C.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 31: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). I was fortunate to participate with Chris in these studies and left part of the reduced ribonuclease without blocking its sulfhydryl groups to see if it could reoxidize properly and whether the enzymatic activity would come back. The results of these experiments (10.Sela M. White Jr., F.H. Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1957; 125: 691-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) showed a total recovery of the activity even though statistical considerations pointed to 105 various ways in which the four disulfide bridges could reform. Thus, we demonstrated that no additional information was needed for the correct, unique architecture of a protein molecule and that it is the genetic code dictating the amino acid sequence that is responsible for the conversion of the randomly coiled structure. It is for this most important observation that in 1972 Chris was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry, which he shared with Stanford Moore and William Stein, who established the amino acid sequence of ribonuclease. I learned a lot from Chris, a dedicated scientist, who had an incredible flair for attacking the right protein and the most elegant experiment to solve it, a flair matched only by his literary talent. During my visits to Bethesda, I tried in two ways to combine my previous experience with polyamino acids and research on enzymes. One was the use of copolymers of glutamic acid with aromatic amino acids to efficiently inhibit ribonuclease (11.Sela M. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 418-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lysozyme, or trypsin. The other series of studies had to do with poly-dl-alanylation of proteins. In contrast to poly-l-alanine and poly-d-alanine, poly-dl-alanine, which is a random copolymer of l-alanine and d-alanine, is well soluble in water and may serve as a solubilizer. Poly-dl-alanyl ribonuclease could be reduced and reoxidized properly. Poly-dl-alanylation renders gliadin water-soluble (12.Sela M. Lupu N. Yaron A. Berger A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 62: 594-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and converts myosin into a derivative soluble in distilled water and with all its ATPase activity preserved (13.Edelman I.S. Hoffer E. Bauminger S. Sela M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 123: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). On a lighter level, when I arrived in Bethesda everybody was writing the sequences of amino acids in straight lines; the disulfide bridges (at straight angles to the chain) occupied as much space as 10 residues. I found a huge hole puncher with which I made round pieces of paper, wrote the name of 1 residue on each piece of paper, and played with them until the half-cystines of a bridge were able to touch each other. This gave rise to the well known “swan” shape of ribonuclease, and it delights me to see that proteins are still often schematically presented like this. After returning from my first visit to the NIH (1956–1957), I embarked on a collaboration with Nathan Citri on two conformationally different states of penicillinase. The enzyme changes from an iodine-resistant to an iodine-sensitive state in urea or guanidine hydrochloride. The change in conformation was followed by optical rotatory measurements. This, in 1960, was my first of many papers published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry (14.Citri N. Garber N. Sela M. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 3454-3459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During my second stay at the NIH (1960–1961), I continued studies on oxidation of reduced ribonuclease (15.Anfinsen C.B. Haber E. Sela M. White Jr., F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1961; 47: 1309-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar) and started investigating the enzymatic properties of poly-dl-alanyl derivatives of ribonuclease (16.Anfinsen C.B. Sela M. Cooke J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 1825-1831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Wellner D. Silman J.I. Sela M. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 1324-1331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), trypsin, and chymotrypsin (18.Epstein C.J. Anfinsen C.B. Sela M. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3458-3463Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Alanylated ribonuclease with as many as 4 or 5 alanine residues per chain kept its enzymatic activity and regenerated its full activity after reduction of its disulfide bridges and subsequent reoxidation (16.Anfinsen C.B. Sela M. Cooke J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 1825-1831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We later learned that alanylation affected the enzymatic activity toward RNA but not toward the low molecular weight substrates (17.Wellner D. Silman J.I. Sela M. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 1324-1331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Poly-dl-alanyl trypsin, with an average polyalanine chain length of 6–9 residues, was resistant to autolysis at temperatures up to 38 °C and reacted normally with soybean and serum inhibitors. Poly-dl-alanyl chymotrypsin had similar stability and activity properties (18.Epstein C.J. Anfinsen C.B. Sela M. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3458-3463Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Several years later, Roger Acher visited us from Paris and investigated poly-dl-alanyl Kunitz trypsin inhibitor (19.Acher R. Chauvet J. Arnon R. Sela M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 3: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Only when the alanine residues were attached exclusively to the α-amino group was the inhibitor active. Upon alanylation of all the amino groups, the derivative was virtually inactive, demonstrating the crucial role of ϵ-amino groups for its activity. While still in Bethesda, I checked the inhibition of ribonuclease by copolymers of glutamic acid and aromatic amino acids (11.Sela M. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 418-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Copolymers of tyrosine (or phenylalanine) and glutamic acid are much more efficient inhibitors of ribonuclease than polyaspartic acid, and in this case the attachment to the enzyme occurs not only through electrostatic interactions but also through short range urea-labile bonds. The digestion of ribonucleic acid by pancreatic ribonuclease was stopped completely, at pH 5.0, by relatively small amounts of the inhibitory copolymer. We tested these copolymers also for inhibition of lysozyme (20.Sela M. Steiner L.A. Biochemistry. 1963; 2: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and trypsin (21.Rigby M. Sela M. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) with similar results. As my Ph.D. thesis was concerned with polytyrosine (a polymeric chain of phenols) and poly-p-aminophenylalanine (a polymeric chain of anilines), it was natural to produce polypeptidic azo dyes from them. I reasoned that these might serve as synthetic models for azoproteins, of which one rare example, provided by Landsteiner, was the attachment of haptens including peptides, via an azo bond, to proteins. Reading Landsteiner's book The Specificity of Serological Reactions, I came across the statement that gelatin probably is not antigenic because it contains no tyrosine. This led me to study the possibility of increasing the antigenicity of gelatin by attachment of tyrosine peptides. To do these studies, the amino groups of the protein were used to initiate the polymerization of the tyrosine monomer, as mentioned earlier. The continuation of this study was the Ph.D. thesis of Ruth Arnon, and we showed that limited tyrosylation enhanced immunogenicity without significantly changing specificity, whereas more extensive tyrosylation converted gelatin into a potent immunogen provoking antibodies mainly to tyrosyl peptides (22.Sela M. Arnon R. Biochem. J. 1960; 75: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It was at this time that we first promoted the notion of immunogen and immunogenicity and distinguished it from antigenic specificity. I was delighted to describe the results on the increase in immunogenicity of gelatin upon its polytyrosylation to Sir Charles Harington on the same visit in 1954, as it was in his laboratory that John Humphrey some 15 years earlier had tried to increase the antigenicity of gelatin by attaching it chemically to carbobenzoxy-l-tyrosine. It was several years later that we started collaborating with John Humphrey and his colleagues on several aspects of synthetic polypeptide antigens, contributing to a better understanding of immunology. As a result of the studies on tyrosylated gelatin, we assumed that gelatin was not necessary for immunogenicity. We, therefore, replaced the gelatin with multichain poly-dl-alanine (23.Sela M. Bull. Res. Counc. Isr. 1954; 4: 109-110Google Scholar, 24.Sela M. Katchalski E. Gehatia M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1956; 78: 746-751Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) as the carrier for peptides of tyrosine and glutamic acid and showed that the resulting copolymer, denoted (T,G)-A-L, led to specific, precipitable antibodies in experimental animals. At that stage Sara Fuchs joined us, and we synthesized numerous linear and multichain polyamino acids and tested them for immunogenicity. Our preliminary communication on a “synthetic antigen” was rejected by Nature under the pretext that the journal does not publish papers that are part of a series, so we published it elsewhere (25.Sela M. Arnon R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 40: 382-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The final paper (26.Sela M. Fuchs S. Arnon R. Biochem. J. 1962; 85: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) became a Citation Classic (Current Contents, 1986). The availability of synthetic antigens permitted a systematic elucidation of the molecular basis of antigenicity (27.Fuchs S. Sela M. Biochem. J. 1963; 87: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28.Sela M. Adv. Immunol. 1966; 5: 29-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 29.Sela M. Science. 1969; 166: 1365-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). We could learn a lot about the role of size, composition, and shape as well as about the accessibility of those parts of the molecule crucial for immunogenicity. As a matter of fact, we learned that it was possible (provided one was prepared to invest the necessary effort) to prepare synthetic immunogens leading to antibodies of essentially any specificity. Although in most cases a good immunogen had a molecular mass of at least several thousand daltons, dinitrophenyl-hexalysine and arsanil-trityrosine were by themselves capable of triggering an efficient immune response. The minimal size for a molecule to be immunogenic depends, therefore, largely on its chemical nature. Although electrical charge may be important in defining the antigenic specificity of an epitope, charge is not a minimum necessary cause for immunogenicity; we could prepare water-soluble amino acid copolymers devoid of charge that were immunogenic. Polymers of d-amino acids were immunogenic only when they were administered in minute amounts and they led to no secondary response. Their immunogenicity was thymus-independent, as was that of several other polymers such as linear (Pro-Gly-Pro)n and multichain polymers of l-proline locked in with terminal polymeric side chains of d-Phe and d-Glu. The common denominator of all these “thymus-independent” antigens was that they not only possessed repeating antigenic determinants but they also were metabolized slowly, if at all. Even though polymers composed exclusively of d-amino acids are “thymus independent,” we were able to show more recently that they are capable of inducing the formation of T cell hybridomas. The different roles of d-amino acids had intrigued me for many years, and I summarized the topic recently (30.Sela M. Zisman E. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Most of the above studies on the molecular basis of antigenicity were carried out before the crucial role of T lymphocytes in immune response was realized. Only later the central question of immunology became: T-B or not T-B? In the early days there was a wonderful feeling working on synthetic antigens because practically nobody else was working on the subject, but later on it was as pleasant and satisfying to know that so many laboratories had become interested in the synthetic approach to immunological phenomena. One of the most fascinating aspects of our studies with synthetic antigens had to do with the steric conformation of the immunogen and of its epitopes. We distinguished between conformational (conformation-dependent) and sequential determinants (31.Sela M. Schechter B. Schechter I. Borek F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1967; 32: 537-545Crossref Google Scholar) and showed how the same peptide (Tyr-Ala-Glu) may lead to antibodies recognizing the sequence (when attached to multichain poly-dl-alanine) or recognizing an epitope defined by conformation (when the tripeptide was polymerized to give an α-helical structure). In addition, we could demonstrate for the first time, by circular dichroism, how antibodies to the α-helical polymer could help transconform into a helical shape a small polymer that was not yet helical (32.Schechter B. Conway-Jacobs A. Sela M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 20: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These studies led us directly to study proteins and to synthesize a macromolecule in which a synthetic “loop” peptide derived from hen egg white lysozyme was attached to branched polyalanine (33.Arnon R. Maron E. Sela M. Anfinsen C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 1450-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The resulting antibodies reacted with intact lysozyme through the “loop” region, but the reaction was totally abolished when the disulfide bond within the “loop” was opened, and thus the three-dimensional structure was collapsed. In this connection, it should be remembered that partial degradation products of proteins may still be immunogenic. Furthermore, the sera we were investigating might have contained a myriad of antibodies against degradation products derived from the original immunogen. In later years we showed that a peptide of 20 amino acid residues derived from the coat protein of MS2 bacteriophage induced, after conjugation with an appropriate carrier, the formation of antibodies that cross-reacted with the intact virus (34.Langbeheim H. Arnon R. Sela M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 4636-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). More recently, tens of peptides analogous to segments of proteins have been prepared that may lead to antibodies cross-reactive with the intact protein. Nevertheless, one should remember that many similar peptides have been prepared that were not capable of provoking anti-protein responses. The extent of cross-reactivity will depend entirely on the probability that the free peptide will be able to attain the conformation that it possesses in the native protein. This capability may be prevented either when the segment is too short, not yet able to possess a stabilized correct conformation, or when it is too long and possesses a preferred stabilized conformation different from the one capable of cross-reaction. If the protein segment is more flexible, the chance of cross-reaction is higher, even though there will be cases when a small peptide is capable of manifesting a relatively rigid conformation similar to the one it possesses within a native protein. Thus, antibodies to the rigid helix (Pro-Gly-Pro)n cross-reacted with collagen (35.Maoz A. Fuchs S. Sela M. Biochemistry. 1973; 9: 4246-4252Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The exposure to the outside (hydrophilicity) is also very important to immunopotency: “Whatever sticks out most, is most immunopotent.” Synthetic antigens allowed the study of antibody specificity, immunological tolerance, the role of net electrical charge in defining the nature of antibodies, and delayed hypersensitivity. The results led us to the inevitable conclusion that an immunogen is much more than an antigenic determinant attached to an inert carrier. Unfortunately, we did not know that the separate recognition of antigen by T and B cells was the explanation for our results. However, we did clearly state that the “carrier” had a crucial role in defining the nature of the immune response toward an epitope. Similar to the cooperation between T and B cells for antibody formation, delayed hypersensitivity might be the result, we suggested, of cooperation between two distinct sets of T cells. Recently, I came back to this problem when reviewing together with Israel Pecht, “The Nature of Antigen” (36.Sela M. Pecht I. Adv. Protein Chem. 1996; 49: 289-328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Being interested in methods for isolating antibodies we purified antibodies to gelatin from antigen-antibody complex by proteolysis (37.Arnon R. Sela M. Science. 1960; 132: 86-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In another case (38.Givol D. Fuchs S. Sela M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 222-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we isolated on columns of Sephadex antibodies to such low molecular weight antigens as lysozyme and a synthetic polypeptide. With Ruth Arnon we succeeded in preparing an analog of the Fab dimer by splitting the IgG molecule with cyanogen bromide rather than with proteolytic enzymes (39.Cahnmann H.J. Arnon R. Sela M. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3247-3255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Lahav M. Arnon R. Sela M. J. Exp. Med. 1967; 125: 787-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Poly-dl-alanylation of immunoglobulin because of its great solubilization effect permitted the total reduction of all the disulfide bridges within the molecule without insolubilizing the light and heavy chain products. This allowed for controlled reoxidation, leading to the correct association of light and heavy chains and the recovery of both antigenic and antibody activity (41.Freedman M.H. Sela M. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2383-2396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Freedman M.H. Sela M. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5225-5232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It also confirmed the hypothesis that no genetic information other than that present in the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide chains is required for the correct conformation of a protein molecule as complex as immunoglobulin G. When Israel Pecht returned to Rehovot from Manfred Eigen's laboratory, he extended the interest in the antibody-combining site to its kinetic aspects. Using temperature-jump methodologies, Pecht was able to resolve the hapten-recognition process with the first homogeneous antibody available at that time, namely a dinitrophenyl specific IgA myeloma (43.Pecht I. Givol D. Sela M. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 68: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Of great interest to me was the observation we made with Edna Mozes on the inverse electrical net charge relationship between an antigen and the antibodies it provoked (44.Sela M. Mozes E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 45.S"
