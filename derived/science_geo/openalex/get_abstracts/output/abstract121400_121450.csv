https://openalex.org/W2160205444,"We have found that, during the early stages of cortical neurogenesis, both GABA and glutamate depolarize cells in the ventricular zone of rat embryonic neocortex. In the ventricular zone, glutamate acts on AMPA/kainate receptors, while GABA acts on GABAA receptors. GABA induces an inward current at resting membrane potentials, presumably owing to a high intracellular Cl- concentration maintained by furosemide-sensitive Cl- transport. GABA and glutamate also produce increases in intracellular Ca2+ in ventricular zone cells, in part through activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Furthermore, GABA and glutamate decrease the number of embryonic cortical cells synthesizing DNA. Depolarization with K+ similarly decreases DNA synthesis, suggesting that the neurotransmitters act via membrane depolarization. Applied alone, GABAA and AMPA/kainate receptor antagonists increase DNA synthesis, indicating that endogenously released amino acids influence neocortical progenitors in the cell cycle. These results demonstrate a novel role for amino acid neurotransmitters in regulating neocortical neurogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1969483526,"Neocortical pyramidal cells possess voltage-dependent dendritic sodium channels that promote propagation of action potentials into the dendritic tree but paradoxically may fail to originate dendritic spikes. A biophysical model was constructed to reconcile these observations with known anatomical and physiological properties. When dendritic and somatic sodium channel densities compatible with electrophysiological measurements were combined with much higher densities in the axon initial segment then, regardless of the site of stimulation, spikes initiated at the initial segment and subsequently invaded the dendrites. The lower initial segment threshold arose from high current density and electrical isolation from the soma. Failure of dendritic channels to initiate spikes was due to inactivation and source-load considerations, which were more favorable for conduction of back-propagated spikes."

https://openalex.org/W1998885927,"The locus coeruleus (LC), the main noradrenergic center in the brain, participates in many neural functions, as diverse as memory and motor output, and is severely affected in several neurodegenerative disorders of the CNS. GDNF, a neurotrophic factor initially identified as dopaminotrophic, was found to be expressed in several targets of central noradrenergic neurons in the adult rat brain. Grafting of genetically engineered fibroblasts expressing high levels of GDNF prevented > 80% of the 6-hydroxydopamine-induced degeneration of noradrenergic neurons in the LC in vivo. Moreover, GDNF induced a fasciculated sprouting and increased by 2.5-fold both tyrosine hydroxylase levels and the soma size of lesioned LC neurons. These findings reveal a novel and potent neurotrophic activity of GDNF that may have therapeutic applications in neurodegenerative disorders affecting central noradrenergic neurons, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases."

https://openalex.org/W1986212704,"The role of the cAMP pathway in LTP was studied in the CA1 region of hippocampus. Widely spaced trains of high frequency stimulation generated cAMP postsynaptically via NMDA receptors and calmodulin, consistent with the Ca2+/calmodulin-mediated stimulation of postsynaptic adenylyl cyclase. The early phase of LTP produced by the same pattern of high frequency stimulation was dependent on postsynaptic cAMP. However, synaptic transmission was not increased by postsynaptic application of cAMP. Early LTP became cAMP-independent when protein phosphatase inhibitors were injected postsynaptically. These observations indicate that in early LTP the cAMP signaling pathway, instead of transmitting signals for the generation of LTP, gates LTP through postsynaptic protein phosphatases."

https://openalex.org/W2022191664,"We find that calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels causes extensive neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. The calcium signal transduction pathway promoting neurite outgrowth causes the rapid activation of protein tyrosine kinases, which include Src. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation results in the formation of an Shc/Grb2 complex, leading to Ras activation, MAP kinase activation, and the subsequent induction of the immediate early gene NGFI-A. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation, gene induction, and neurite outgrowth are inhibited by the expression of dominant negative forms of both Src and Ras, indicating a requirement for both proto-oncoproteins in calcium signaling. Our results suggest that a signaling cassette which includes Src and Ras is likely to underlie a broad range of calcium of actions in the nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2085893808,"The MAG-deficient mouse was used to test whether MAG acts as a significant inhibitor of axonal regeneration in the adult mammalian CNS, as suggested by cell culture experiments. Cell spreading, neurite elongation, or growth cone collapse of different cell types in vitro was not significantly different when myelin preparations or optic nerve cryosections from either MAG-deficient or wild-type mice were used as a substrate. More importantly, the extent of axonal regrowth in lesioned optic nerve and corticospinal tract in vivo was similarly poor in MAG-deficient and wild-type mice. However, axonal regrowth increased significantly and to a similar extent in both genotypes after application of the IN-1 antibody directed against the neurite growth inhibitors NI-35 and NI-250. These observations do not support the view that MAG is a significant inhibitor of axonal regeneration in the adult CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2011571192,"Mechanically gated ""transduction"" channels in inner ear hair cells are thought to be connected to tip links stretched between adjacent stereocilia. To locate active channels, calcium-green fluorescence in single stereocilia was measured with two-photon laser scanning microscopy. Bundle deflection increased fluorescence in many but not all stereocilia; the increase was blocked by depolarization. The number of stereocilia responding was proportional to the transduction current, consistent with Ca2+ influx through transduction channels. Fluorescence rose first in the tips of stereocilia and then in the bases, in agreement with channel localization at the tips. Some of the shortest stereocilia in a bundle showed a fluorescence increase, as did some of the tallest, indicating that transduction channels can be at either or both ends of tip links."
https://openalex.org/W2053961818,"Using primary cultures and immortalized multipotential stem cell lines derived from wild-type and Mash1 mutant neural crest cells, we have analyzed the cellular function of MASH1 in autonomic neurogenesis. We present evidence for the existence of a precursor expressing MASH1 and neuronal markers such as neurofilament, neuron-specific tubulin, and tetanus toxin receptor. This cell has a nonneuronal morphology. Differentiation of this precursor to neurons that express markers such as SCG10, peripherin, and neuron-specific enolase is dependent upon MASH1 function. These data imply that the differentiation of autonomic neurons from uncommitted neural crest cells occurs in several sequential steps. Moreover, they suggest that MASH1 does not commit multipotent cells to a neural fate, like its Drosophila achaete-scute counterparts, but rather promotes the differentiation of a committed neuronal precursor."
https://openalex.org/W2005490867,"Xenopus laevis possess a gene repertoire encoding two distinct classes of olfactory receptors: one class related to receptors of fish and one class similar to receptors of mammals. Sequence comparison indicates that the fish-like receptors represent closely related members of only two subfamilies, whereas mammalian-like receptors are more distantly related, most of them representing a different subfamily. The fish-like receptor genes are exclusively expressed in the lateral diverticulum of the frog's nose, specialized for detecting water-soluble odorants, whereas mammalian-like receptors are expressed in sensory neurons of the main diverticulum, responsible for the reception of volatile odors."
https://openalex.org/W2068131693,"Inwardly rectifying K+ channels are distantly related to their voltage-gated counterparts and possess a structural motif of only two putative transmembrane segments in each subunit. They are formed by the assembly of an unknown number of subunits. We have examined the subunit stoichiometry of a strongly rectifying K+ channel, IRK1, by linking together the coding sequence of three or four subunits and distinguishing channels with different numbers of subunits carrying a double mutation that alters inward rectification and single-channel properties. We find that IRK1 channels, like voltage-gated K+ channels, are tetrameric channels. Interestingly, the high sensitivity to Mg2+ and polyamines, cations that produce inward rectification by blocking the channel pore from the cytoplasmic side is largely retained in a channel containing only one wild-type subunit and three subunits bearing mutations that abolish high affinity Mg2+ and polyamine block."

https://openalex.org/W2010078877,"Episodic ataxia (EA) is an autosomal dominant human disorder that produces persistent myokymia and attacks of generalized ataxia. Recently, familial EA has been linked to the voltage-dependent delayed rectifier, Kv1.1, on chromosome 12. Six EA families have been identified that carry distinct Kv1.1 missense mutations; all individuals are heterozygous. Expression in Xenopus oocytes demonstrates that two of the EA subunits form homomeric channels with altered gating properties. V408A channels have voltage dependence similar to that of wild-type channels, but with faster kinetics and increased C-type inactivation, while the voltage dependence of F184C channels is shifted 20 mV positive. The other four EA subunits do not produce functional homomeric channels but reduce the potassium current when coassembled with wild-type subunits. The results suggest a cellular mechanism underlying EA in which the affected nerve cells cannot efficiently repolarize following an action potential because of altered delayed rectifier function."
https://openalex.org/W1998862379,"The stereotyped positions occupied by individual classes of neurons are a fundamental characteristic of CNS cytoarchitecture. To study the regulation of neuronal positioning, we injected genetically labeled neural precursors derived from dorsal and ventral mouse forebrain into the telencephalic vesicles of embryonic rats. Cells from both areas were found to participate in the generation of telencephalic, diencephalic, and mesencephalic brain regions. Donor-derived neurons populated the host brain in distinct patterns and acquired phenotypic features appropriate for their final location. These observations indicate that neuronal migration and differentiation are predominantly regulated by non-cell-autonomous signals. Exploiting this phenomenon, intrauterine transplantation allows generation of controlled chimerism in the mammalian brain."
https://openalex.org/W1999696388,"The developmental potential of neural progenitors derived from the E13.5-E14 lateral or medial ganglionic eminences (LGE and MGE, respectively) or the E12 ventral mesencephalon (VM) was examined in cross-species transplantation model. After injection into the E15 rat forebrain ventricle, mouse LGE progenitors (unlike those of the MGE or VM) were consistently integrated into the host striatum, expressing neurochemical phenotypes and axonal projections characteristic of striatal projection neurons. Additionally, both LGE and MGE precursors displayed widespread incorporation into distinct forebrain and midbrain structures, whereas the more caudally derived VM cells were largely confined to midbrain structures. These results suggest that many LGE precursors are positionally specified for striatal incorporation, while a portion also possess greater potential reflected in more widespread integration following intraventricular injection."
https://openalex.org/W1978236018,"The three-dimensional structure of intact human rhinovirus 14 (HRV-14) complexed with Fab fragments (Fab17-IA) from a strongly neutralizing antibody that binds bivalently to the virion has been determined to 4.0 angstrom resolution by a combination of X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. In contradiction to the most commonly held model of antibody-mediated neutralization, Fab17-IA does not induce a conformational change in the HRV-14 capsid. Instead, the paratope of the antibody undergoes a large conformational change to accommodate the epitope. Unlike any previously described antibody-antigen structure, the conserved framework region of the antibody makes extensive contact with the viral surface. Fab17-IA penetrates deep within the canyon in which the cellular receptor for HRV-14 binds. Hence, it is unlikely that viral quaternary structure evolves merely to evade immune recognition. Instead, the shape and position of the receptor-binding region on a virus probably dictates receptor binding and subsequent uncoating events and has little or no influence on concealing the virus from the immune system."

https://openalex.org/W2011416373,"Autosomal dominant myotonia congenita (Thomsen's disease) is caused by mutations in the muscle chloride channel CIC-1. Several point mutations found in affected families (I29OM, R317Q, P480L, and Q552R) dramatically shift gating to positive voltages in mutant/WT heterooligomeric channels, and when measurable, even more so in mutant homooligomers. These channels can no longer contribute to the repolarization of action potentials, fully explaining why they cause dominant myotonia. Most replacements of the isoleucine at position 290 shift gating toward positive voltages. Mutant/WT heterooligomers can be partially activated by repetitive depolarizations, suggesting a role in shortening myotonic runs. Remarkably, a human mutation affecting an adjacent residue (E291K) is fully recessive. Large shifts in the voltage dependence of gating may be common to many mutations in dominant myotonia congenita."

https://openalex.org/W2001632160,"Neurotrophin 3 (Nt3) is one of five neurotrophin growth factors which shape the development of the nervous system by regulating neuronal survival and differentiation. Peripheral neuronal subpopulations expressing the TrkC receptor tyrosine kinase respond to Nt3 with enhanced survival, mitogenesis or cell migration1–3 and these neurons are lost in homozygous Nt3 null (−/−) mutant mice4–7. The unexplained perinatal lethality in the Nt3−/− mice, however, suggests a wider function for this neurotrophin. Here we report that Nt3 is essential for the normal development of atria, ventricles, and cardiac outflow tracts. Histological and echocardiographic image analysis of Nt3−/− animals reveal severe cardiovascular abnormalities including atrial and ventricular septal defects, and tetralogy of Fallot, resembling some of the most common congenital malformations in humans. The observed defects are consistent with abnormalities in the survival and/or migration of cardiac neural crest early in embryogenesis8 and establish an essential role for neurotrophin 3 in regulating the development of the mammalian heart."
https://openalex.org/W2015051410,"We have studied spatial Ca2+ distribution in hair cells filled with the low affinity fluorescent indicator Calcium Green 5N using real-time confocal microscopy and whole-cell recording. During depolarizations lasting several hundred milliseconds, Ca2+ fluorescence increased at a number of hotspots around the base of the cell but changed little near the hair bundle. The hotspots required influx of Ca2+ through voltage-dependent channels, and they expanded during the pulse from an initial diameter of < 1 micron. Strong Ca2+ buffers like BAPTA slowed their growth rate. On repolarization, the fluorescence decayed with two time constants: approximately 0.1 s, which may represent Ca2+ diffusion away from the entry sites, and 10 s, probably reflecting Ca2+ extrusion. Extrusion occurs mainly via a CaATPase that can be blocked by vanadate. We suggest the hotspots are microdomains of Ca2+ attaining a concentration of at least 85 microM near assemblies of synaptic release sites."
https://openalex.org/W2001630331,"Proteins of the synaptic basal lamina are important in directing the differentiation of motor nerve terminals. One synaptic basal lamina protein, agrin, which influences postsynaptic muscle differentiation, has been suggested to influence nerve terminals as well. To test this hypothesis, we cocultured chick ciliary ganglion neurons with agrin-expressing CHO cells. Ciliary ganglion neurons, but not sensory neurons, adhered five times as well to agrin-expressing cells as to untransfected cells. Further, ciliary ganglion neurites were growth inhibited upon contact with agrin-expressing cells. Finally, the synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin became concentrated at contacts between ciliary ganglion neurites and agrin-expressing cells. These activities were shared by neuronal and muscle-derived agrin isoforms, consistent with the hypothesis that muscle agrin may influence the presynaptic axon. Our results suggest that agrin influences the growth and differentiation of motoneurons in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1998880191,"Cerebellar long-term depression (LTD) may be reliably induced in the cultured Purkinje neuron when glutamate pulses and Purkinje neuron depolarization are applied together 6 times. When the number of these conjunctive stimuli was reduced to 2, a short-term depression (STD) lasting 20-40 min was induced in 4/12 cells. The enzyme phospholipase A2 cleaves membrane phospholipids causing liberation of free unsaturated fatty acids, which in turn synergistically activate protein kinase C when present with diacylglycerol and Ca. Application of free unsaturated fatty acids with 2 conjunctive stimuli resulted in an apparent conversion of STD cases to LTD. Application of phospholipase A2 inhibitors during 6 conjunctions converted LTD to STD. These findings suggest a model in which liberation of unsaturated fatty acids by phospholipase A2 contributes to a synergistic activation of protein kinase C, the full activation of which results in LTD induction, and the partial activation of which results in STD induction."
https://openalex.org/W1988120560,"Voltage-gated K+ channels are localized to juxtaparanodal regions of myelinated axons. To begin to understand the role of normal compact myelin in this localization, we examined mKv1.1 and mKv1.2 expression in the dysmyelinating mouse mutants shiverer and Trembler. In neonatal wild-type and shiverer mice, the focal localization of both proteins in axon fiber tracts is similar, suggesting that cues other than mature myelin can direct initial K+ channel localization in shiverer mutants. In contrast, K+ channel localization is altered in hypomyelinated axonal fiber tracts of adult mutants, suggesting that abnormal myelination leads to channel redistribution. In shiverer adult, K+ channel expression is up-regulated in both axons and glia, as revealed by immunocytochemistry, RNase protection, and in situ hybridization studies. This up-regulation of K+ channels in hypomyelinated axon tracts may reflect a compensatory reorganization of ionic currents, allowing impulse conduction to occur in these dysmyelinating mouse mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2034612318,"Oligodendrocytes have been recently claimed to originate from bilateral columns of precursors whose extension is limited to the ventral region of the neuroepithelium. We designed an experiment in which the developmental capabilities of the different regions of the ventricular epithelium could be tested. We exchanged isotopically and isochronically defined sectors of the E2 spinal cord between quail and chick embryos and followed the production and migration of oligodendrocytes by using a quail-specific cDNA probe encoding the oligodendrocyte marker Schwann cell myelin protein. We showed that oligodendrocytes are generated in vivo from both ventral and dorsal halves of the neural tube. Moreover, extensive ventrodorsal, as well as dorsoventral, migrations of oligodendrogenic cells take place during spinal cord differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2094037670,"In mouse, retinal axon divergence takes place within a cellular specialization localized at the midline of the optic chiasm. To test whether the cells in this locus present cues for differential retinal axon growth, retinal explants were cocultured with cells dissociated from the chiasmatic midline, both taken from day 14-15 embryos, during the principal period of retinal axon divergence. Compared with crossed axons from other retinal regions, axons from ventrotemporal retina, the sole source of uncrossed axons, were shorter, more fasciculated, and fewer in number when growing on chiasm cells. Furthermore, uncrossed axons avoided clusters of chiasm neurons and glia having the composition and arrangement of the midline specialization, but crossed axons readily grew over them. In contrast to the clusters of chiasm cells, however, individual neurons and glia did not elicit differential retinal axon growth. These data demonstrate that cues for divergence derive from cells resident to the chiasm and suggest that cellular interactions among resident midline cells are required to produce these cues."
