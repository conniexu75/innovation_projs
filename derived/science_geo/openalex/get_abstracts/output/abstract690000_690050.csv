https://openalex.org/W4221129344,"Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) is one of the most used polymers for drug delivery systems (DDSs). It shows excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and allows spatio-temporal control of the release of a drug by altering its chemistry. In spite of this, few formulations have reached the market. To characterize and optimize the drug release process, mathematical models offer a good alternative as they allow interpreting and predicting experimental findings, saving time and money. However, there is no general model that describes all types of drug release of polymeric DDSs. This study aims to perform a statistical comparison of several mathematical models commonly used in order to find which of them best describes the drug release profile from PLGA particles synthesized by nanoprecipitation method. For this purpose, 40 datasets extracted from scientific articles published since 2016 were collected. Each set was fitted by the models: order zero to fifth order polynomials, Korsmeyer-Peppas, Weibull and Hyperbolic Tangent Function. Some data sets had few observations that do not allow to apply statistic test, thus bootstrap resampling technique was performed. Statistic evidence showed that Hyperbolic Tangent Function model is the one that best fit most of the data."

Therefore, it is necessary to establish the effectiveness of available vaccines as this group of patients was not represented in the randomized trials. Design, setting, participants, &amp; measurements A total of 707 consecutive adult kidney transplant recipients in a single center in the United Kingdom were evaluated. 373 were confirmed to have received two doses of either the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or AZD1222 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) and subsequently had SARS-COV-2 antibody testing were included in the final analysis. Participants were excluded from the analysis if they had a previous history of SARS-COV-2 infection or were seropositive for SARS-COV-2 antibody pre-vaccination. Multivariate and propensity score analyses were performed to identify the predictors of antibody response to SARS-COV-2 vaccines. The primary outcome was seroconversion rates following two vaccine doses. Results Antibody responders were 56.8% (212/373) and non-responders 43.2% (161/373). Antibody response was associated with greater estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) rate [odds ratio (OR), for every 10 ml/min/1.73m 2 = 1.40 (1.19–1.66), P&lt;0.001] whereas, non-response was associated with mycophenolic acid immunosuppression [OR, 0.02(0.01–0.11), p&lt;0.001] and increasing age [OR per 10year increase, 0.61(0.48–0.78), p&lt;0.001]. In the propensity-score analysis of four treatment variables (vaccine type, mycophenolic acid, corticosteroid, and triple immunosuppression), only mycophenolic acid was significantly associated with vaccine response [adjusted OR by PSA 0.17 (0.07–0.41): p&lt;0.001]. 22 SARS-COV-2 infections were recorded in our cohort following vaccination. 17(77%) infections, with 3 deaths, occurred in the non-responder group. No death occurred in the responder group. Conclusion Vaccine response in allograft recipients after two doses of SARS-COV-2 vaccine is poor compared to the general population. Maintenance with mycophenolic acid appears to have the strongest negative impact on vaccine response."
https://openalex.org/W4220968900,"Background COVID-19 has inundated the entire world disrupting the lives of millions of people. The pandemic has stressed the healthcare system of India impacting the psychological status and functioning of health care workers. The aim of this study is to determine the burnout levels and factors associated with the risk of psychological distress among healthcare workers (HCW) engaged in the management of COVID 19 in India. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from 1 September 2020 to 30 November 2020 by telephonic interviews using a web-based Google form. Health facilities and community centres from 12 cities located in 10 states were selected for data collection. Data on socio-demographic and occupation-related variables like age, sex, type of family, income, type of occupation, hours of work and income were obtained was obtained from 967 participants, including doctors, nurses, ambulance drivers, emergency response teams, lab personnel, and others directly involved in COVID 19 patient care. Levels of psychological distress was assessed by the General health Questionnaire -GHQ-5 and levels of burnout was assessed using the ICMR-NIOH Burnout questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the risk of psychological distress. The third quartile values of the three subscales of burnout viz EE, DP and PA were used to identify burnout profiles of the healthcare workers. Results Overall, 52.9% of the participants had the risk of psychological distress that needed further evaluation. Risk of psychological distress was significantly associated with longer hours of work (≥ 8 hours a day) (AOR = 2.38, 95% CI(1.66–3.41), income≥20000(AOR = 1.74, 95% CI, (1.16–2.6); screening of COVID-19 patients (AOR = 1.63 95% CI (1.09–2.46), contact tracing (AOR = 2.05, 95% CI (1.1–3.81), High Emotional exhaustion score (EE ≥16) (AOR = 4.41 95% CI (3.14–6.28) and High Depersonalisation score (DP≥7) (AOR = 1.79, 95% CI (1.28–2.51)). About 4.7% of the HCWs were overextended (EE&gt;18); 6.5% were disengaged (DP&gt;8) and 9.7% HCWs were showing signs of burnout (high on all three dimensions). Conclusion The study has identified key factors that could have been likely triggers for psychological distress among healthcare workers who were engaged in management of COVID cases in India. The study also demonstrates the use of GHQ-5 and ICMR-NIOH Burnout questionnaire as important tools to identify persons at risk of psychological distress and occurrence of burnout symptoms respectively. The findings provide useful guide to planning interventions to mitigate mental health problems among HCW in future epidemic/pandemic scenarios in the country."
https://openalex.org/W4220927460,"COVID-19 severely impacted world health and, as a consequence of the measures implemented to stop the spread of the virus, also irreversibly damaged the world economy. Research shows that receiving the COVID-19 vaccine is the most successful measure to combat the virus and could also address its indirect consequences. However, vaccine hesitancy is growing worldwide and the WHO names this hesitancy as one of the top ten threats to global health. This study investigates the trend in positive attitudes towards vaccines across ten countries since a positive attitude is important. Furthermore, we investigate those variables related to having a positive attitude, as these factors could potentially increase the uptake of vaccines. We derive our text corpus from vaccine-related tweets, harvested in real-time from Twitter. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), we derive the sentiment and emotions contained in the tweets to construct daily time-series data. We analyse a panel dataset spanning both the Northern and Southern hemispheres from 1 February 2021 to 31 July 2021. To determine the relationship between several variables and the positive sentiment (attitude) towards vaccines, we run various models, including POLS, Panel Fixed Effects and Instrumental Variables estimations. Our results show that more information about vaccines' safety and the expected side effects are needed to increase positive attitudes towards vaccines. Additionally, government procurement and the vaccine rollout should improve. Accessibility to the vaccine should be a priority, and a collective effort should be made to increase positive messaging about the vaccine, especially on social media. The results of this study contribute to the understanding of the emotional challenges associated with vaccine uptake and inform policymakers, health workers, and stakeholders who communicate to the public during infectious disease outbreaks. Additionally, the global fight against COVID-19 might be lost if the attitude towards vaccines is not improved."
https://openalex.org/W4220981557,"This study was conducted to examine the relationship between fear of COVID-19, psychological well-being, and satisfaction with life in nursing students.A descriptive and cross-sectional design was used in this study. The study was carried out at a university Faculty of Health Sciences Department of Nursing between May 17 and June 25, 2021. The JASP 0.14.1. Software was used for statistical analysis. Kruskal-Wallis test was used for the comparison of three or more groups, Mann-Whitney U test was used for the comparisons of two groups, and Bonferroni-corrected Mann-Whitney U test was used for post hoc analysis. To determine the risk factors for ""The Fear of COVID-19 Scale,"" linear regression analysis with backward stepwise modeling was used.The mean score of the students was 18.48±6.87 from the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, 38.42±12.60 from the Psychological Well-Being Scale, and 13.12±4.97 from the Satisfaction with Life Scale. According to the results of the regression model established, independent variables explained 12.5% of the dependent variables, but the regression model established was found to be statistically significant. A one-unit increase in the satisfaction with life scale increased the fear of COVID-19 scale score by 0.224 units, and this increase was found statistically significant (p = 0.030) as a result of linear regression analysis used with backward stepwise modeling.In conclusion, it was found that the students' fear of COVID-19 was below the medium level, their psychological well-being was above the medium level, and that their life satisfaction was below the medium level."
https://openalex.org/W4220840182,"Song is produced by a variety of terrestrial and marine animals and is particularly common among baleen whales. Fin whale ( Balaenoptera physalus ) song is comprised of relatively simple 20 Hz pulses produced at regular intervals. The timing of these intervals, in addition to the presence and frequency of overtones, appears to be unique to each population. The purpose of this study was to characterize Western Antarctic Peninsula fin whale song and describe temporal pattern variations in song type and occurrence. Recordings were collected in the area from 2001–2004 and again 2014–2016. One song type was identified with a primary inter-pulse interval (IPI) of approximately 14 s and secondary IPI of 12.5 s. This song occurred in three pattern variants: singlet, doublet, and long triplet. The interval between pulses increased by 1.5 s between recording periods while the frequency of the overtones decreased from 89 Hz to 86 Hz. Song was never recorded in August and while it was recorded at other times in some years, it was consistently present in recordings from April through June across all years. While multiple pattern variants were present each year, singlets were generally the most prevalent variant. Doublets and triplets occurred from February through June, with highest levels of variants in February. In later years the triplet variant presence increased and in 2016 it comprised 53% of recorded song bouts. Further research is needed to understand the reasons why song changes over time and to examine the feasibility of using song to delineate and identify populations."
https://openalex.org/W4220824022,"Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors allow for site-specific and time-dependent genetic manipulation of neurons. However, for successful implementation of AAV vectors, major consideration must be given to the selection of viral serotype and route of delivery for efficient gene transfer into the cell type being investigated. Here we compare the transduction pattern of neurons in the somatosensory system following injection of AAV9 or AAV2retro in the parabrachial complex of the midbrain, the spinal cord dorsal horn, the intrathecal space, and the colon. Transduction was evaluated based on Cre-dependent expression of tdTomato in transgenic reporter mice, following delivery of AAV9 or AAV2retro carrying identical constructs that drive the expression of Cre/GFP. The pattern of distribution of tdTomato expression indicated notable differences in the access of the two AAV serotypes to primary afferent neurons via peripheral delivery in the colon and to spinal projections neurons via intracranial delivery within the parabrachial complex. Additionally, our results highlight the superior sensitivity of detection of neuronal transduction based on reporter expression relative to expression of viral products."
https://openalex.org/W4220902591,"In this study, we developed gelatin-based films for active packaging with the ability to inhibit E. coli. We created these novel biodegradable gelatin-based films with a nisin-EDTA mix. FT-IR, TGA, and SEM analysis showed that nisin interacted with the gelatin by modifying its thermal stability and morphology. The use of nisin (2,500 IU/mL) with concentrations of Na-EDTA (1.052 M stock solution) distributed in the polymer matrix generated a significant decrease in the growth of E. coli when compared to the control. In freshly made films (t0), the growth of E. coli ATCC 25922 was reduced by approximately 3 logarithmic cycles. Two weeks after the films were made, a reduction in antimicrobial activity was observed in approximately 1, 1 and 3 logarithmic cycles of the films with 5%, 10% and 20% of the compound (nisin/Na-EDTA) distributed in the polymer matrix, respectively. This evidences an antimicrobial effect over time. Also, biodegradation tests showed that the films were completely degraded after 10 days. With all these results, an active and biodegradable packaging was successfully obtained to be potentially applied in perishable foods. These biodegradable, gelatin-based films are a versatile active packaging option. Further research on the barrier properties of these films is needed."
https://openalex.org/W4220938041,"Inter-satellite optical wireless communication (Is-OWC) links can become promising solutions to realize the next-generation high-speed communication services. The operation of Global Navigation Satellite Systems can be improved with the use of Is-OWC links through ranging and communication services. However, the key challenge in Inter-satellite link (ISL) is its effective range which is limited due to pointing errors. In this work, we propose to develop a high-capacity and long-reach Is-OWC link by incorporating hybrid mode division multiplexing (MDM) and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) schemes to transmit ten independent channels over 40000kms Is-OWC link. Each channel is capable of carrying 400Gbps data which is encoded by the dual polarization quadrature phase shift key technique with required signal to noise ratio (SNR) and received power. The proposed Is-OWC link satisfies the enhanced communication within Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. The proposed Is-OWC is further evaluated under the impact of space turbulences, particularly transmitter and receiver pointing errors. The result reported that the proposed Is-OWC link can transmit 4Tbps data over 16000kms with the transmitter pointing error of 2μrad and receiver pointing error of 1μrad."
https://openalex.org/W4220830980,"Trichinellosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the ingestion of the Trichinella nematode. With a worldwide incidence of approximately 10,000 cases per year, Trichinella spiralis is responsible for most human infections. There are no specific signs or symptoms of this parasitic infection. Muscle biopsy is the gold diagnostic standard for trichinellosis, but the technique is invasive and unable to detect the early stage of infection. Although immunodiagnostics are also available, antibody detection usually occurs after 3 weeks and prolonged up to 19 years after the acute phase. Therefore, additional diagnostic biomarkers must be identified to improve trichinellosis diagnosis. This study aimed to measure concentration changes in mouse serum proteins prior to T. spiralis infection and 2, 4 and 8 weeks after infection, and to identify T. spiralis circulating proteins and antigens using mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Mouse muscle-related proteins including inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H2, a protein involved in the response to muscle tissue damage, were up-regulated in mouse sera during the T. spiralis larvae invasion. Additionally, 33 circulatory parasite proteins were identified in infected mouse sera. Notably, T. spiralis long-chain fatty acid transport protein 1 could be detected in the early stage of infection and peroxidasin-like protein was identified 2, 4 and 8 weeks after infection. Seventeen T. spiralis circulating antigens were detected in mouse immune complexes, with PX domain protein being found 2, 4 and 8 weeks after infection. Because peroxidasin-like protein and PX domain protein were detected at all post-infection time points, sequence alignments of these proteins were performed, which showed they are conserved among Trichinella spp. and have less similarity to the human and murine sequences. Integrative analysis of T. spiralis biomarkers throughout the course of infection may reveal additional diagnostic targets to improve early diagnosis of trichinellosis."
https://openalex.org/W4220879749,"Background People experiencing homelessness who live in congregate shelters are at high risk of SARS-CoV2 transmission and severe COVID-19. Current screening and response protocols using rRT-PCR in homeless shelters are expensive, require specialized staff and have delays in returning results and implementing responses. Methods We piloted a program to offer frequent, rapid antigen-based tests (BinaxNOW) to residents and staff of congregate-living shelters in San Francisco, California, from January 15 th to February 19 th , 2021. We used the Reach-Effectiveness-Adoption-Implementation-Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to evaluate the implementation. Results Reach: We offered testing at ten of twelve eligible shelters. Shelter residents and staff had variable participation across shelters; approximately half of eligible individuals tested at least once; few tested consistently during the study. Effectiveness: 2.2% of participants tested positive. We identified three outbreaks, but none exceeded 5 cases. All BinaxNOW-positive participants were isolated or left the shelters. Adoption: We offered testing to all eligible participants within weeks of the project’s initiation. Implementation: Adaptations made to increase reach and improve consistency were promptly implemented. Maintenance: San Francisco Department of Public Health expanded and maintained testing with minimal support after the end of the pilot. Conclusion Rapid and frequent antigen testing for SARS-CoV2 in homeless shelters is a viable alternative to rRT-PCR testing that can lead to immediate isolation of infectious individuals. Using the RE-AIM framework, we evaluated and adapted interventions to enable the expansion and maintenance of protocols."
https://openalex.org/W4220653263,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of chronic liver disease and mortality worldwide. Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy leads to high cure rates. However, persons who inject drugs (PWID) are at risk for reinfection after cure and may require multiple DAA treatments to reach the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of HCV elimination by 2030. Using an agent-based model (ABM) that accounts for the complex interplay of demographic factors, risk behaviors, social networks, and geographic location for HCV transmission among PWID, we examined the combination(s) of DAA enrollment (2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, 10%), adherence (60%, 70%, 80%, 90%) and frequency of DAA treatment courses needed to achieve the WHO's goal of reducing incident chronic infections by 90% by 2030 among a large population of PWID from Chicago, IL and surrounding suburbs. We also estimated the economic DAA costs associated with each scenario. Our results indicate that a DAA treatment rate of >7.5% per year with 90% adherence results in 75% of enrolled PWID requiring only a single DAA course; however 19% would require 2 courses, 5%, 3 courses and <2%, 4 courses, with an overall DAA cost of $325 million to achieve the WHO goal in metropolitan Chicago. We estimate a 28% increase in the overall DAA cost under low adherence (70%) compared to high adherence (90%). Our modeling results have important public health implications for HCV elimination among U.S. PWID. Using a range of feasible treatment enrollment and adherence rates, we report robust findings supporting the need to address re-exposure and reinfection among PWID to reduce HCV incidence."
https://openalex.org/W4220866353,"Sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas [L.] Lam) is a widely cultivated food crop with generally good adaptability. However, drought stress can cause a significant decline in yield. To reveal the response mechanism of sweetpotato to drought stress, an integrated physiological, proteomic and metabolomic investigation was conducted in leaves of two sweetpotato varieties with differing responses to drought stress, drought-resistant Wanzishu56 (WZ56) and a more sensitive variety, Ningzishu2(NZ2). Physiological analysis showed that the variety with better drought tolerance had superior performance in water retention capacity and photosynthetic efficiency under drought stress. A total of 1140 proteins were identified within the two varieties. Among them, 192 differentially expressed proteins were detected under drought conditions, including 97 that were up-regulated. Functional analysis showed that these up-regulated proteins were primarily involved in photosynthesis, reactive oxygen species metabolism, organonitrogen compound metabolism, and precursor metabolite catabolism and energy generation. All differentially expressed proteins in WZ56 that were involved in photosynthetic and glutathione metabolic processes were up-regulated. Enzyme activity assays were carried out to validate the proteomics data. Moreover, 75 metabolites were found to have a higher expression level in WZ56 than NZ2 under drought stress. The higher concentration of carbohydrates, amino acids, flavonoids and organic acids found in drought-stressed leaves of WZ56 suggested that these metabolites may improve the drought resistance of sweetpotato. This study uncovered specific-proteins and metabolites associated with drought resistance, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance in sweetpotato."

In the present study, a high sucrose content sugarcane mutant clone, GXB9, has been studied in comparison to the low sucrose mother clone B9 on morphological, agronomical and physiological level in order to scrutinize the variation because of mutation in GXB9 in field under normal environmental condition. The results showed that GXB9 has less germination, tillering rate, stalk height, leaf length, leaf width, leaf area, number of internodes, internode length and internode diameter than B9. Qualitative traits of leaf and stalk displayed significant variation between GXB9 and B9. Endogenous hormones quantity was also showed variation between the two clones. The relative SPAD reading and chlorophyll a, b concentrations also showed variation between GXB9 and B9. The photosynthetic parameter analysis indicated that the GXB9 has significantly higher net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs) and transpiration rate (Tr) than B9. The qRT-PCR analysis of genes encoding enzymes like SPS, SuSy, CWIN, and CeS showed upregulation in GXB9 and downregulation in B9. However, these genes were significantly differentially expressed between the immature and maturing internodes of GXB9. The cane quality trait analysis showed that GXB9 had higher juice rate, juice gravity purity, brix, juice sucrose content and cane sucrose content than B9. The yield and component investigation results indicated that GXB9 had lower single stalk weight, however higher number of millable stalks per hectare than B9, and GXB9 had lower theoretical cane yield than B9. SSR marker analysis showed genetic variation between GXB9 and B9. This study has shown significant variation in the traits of GXB9 in comparison to B9 which advocates that GXB9 is a high sugar mutant clone of B9 and an elite source for future breeding."
https://openalex.org/W4220683398,"The generation of surrogate potential energy functions (PEF) that are orders of magnitude faster to compute but as accurate as the underlying training data from high-level electronic structure methods is one of the most promising applications of fitting procedures in chemistry. In previous work, we have shown that transition state force fields (TSFFs), fitted to the functional form of MM3* force fields using the quantum guided molecular mechanics (Q2MM) method, provide an accurate description of transition states that can be used for stereoselectivity predictions of small molecule reactions. Here, we demonstrate the applicability of the method for fit TSFFs to the well-established Amber force field, which could be used for molecular dynamics studies of enzyme reaction. As a case study, the fitting of a TSFF to the second hydride transfer in Pseudomonas mevalonii 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase ( Pm HMGR) is used. The differences and similarities to fitting of small molecule TSFFs are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4220727945,"South Africa has one of the lowest breastfeeding rates on the African continent. Globally, just 44% of infants are breastfed soon after birth, and 40% of those less than six months old are exclusively breastfed. To improve infant nutrition by 2025, the United Nations established targets to eliminate malnutrition and increase exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) rates to at least 50%. Despite the WHO Code regulations endorsed by the World Health Assembly since 1981, breaches continue to be prevalent due to a combination of weak implementation, monitoring and enforcement in low-to-middle income countries. Over the years, infant formula sales in LMICs (including South Africa) have skyrocketed contributing to excess infant morbidity and mortality. To that end, the specific aims of this study was to gain an understanding of priority actions and strategies necessary to improve breastfeeding outcomes in South Africa in the context of the HIV pandemic. The team used a qualitative study design based on a semi-structured interview guide. The guide consisted of eight open-ended questions addressing the WHO HIV-related infant feeding guidelines, the WHO International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes, political will, and advocacy. Of the 24 individuals contacted, 19 responded and 15 agreed to participate. The Breastfeeding Gear Model guided the thematic analysis. The three main themes identified were 1) WHO guidelines on HIV and infant feeding, 2) Improving exclusive breastfeeding, and 3) Advocacy. Key informants identified issues that need to be addressed to improve breastfeeding outcomes in South Africa. Strong political will is a key ingredient to harness the resources (human, financial) needed to implement, monitor, and act against Code violators. South Africa and other countries with similar challenges should consider using the WHOs Network for Global Monitoring and Support for Implementation of the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes and Subsequent relevant World Health Assembly Resolutions (NetCode) methodology."
https://openalex.org/W4221069708,"An increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) with the widely prescribed piperacillin-tazobactam(PTZ)-vancomycin combination in hospitalized patients has recently been reported, but evidence in ICU patients remain uncertain. This study evaluates the association between the exposure of various broad-spectrum antibiotic regimens with Pseudomonas and/or methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) coverage and the risk of AKI in critically ill patients.A retrospective cohort study based on the publicly available MIMIC-III database reporting hospitalization data from ICU patients from a large academic medical center between 2001 and 2012. Adult patients receiving an anti-pseudomonal or an anti-MRSA agent in the ICU for more than 24-hours were included. Non-PTZ anti-pseudomonal agents were compared to PTZ; non-vancomycin agents covering MRSA were compared to vancomycin; and their combinations were compared to the PTZ-vancomycin combination. The primary outcome was defined as new or worsening AKI within 7 days of the antibiotic exposure using an adjusted binomial generalized estimating equation. Overall, 18 510 admissions from 15 673 individual patients, cumulating 169 966 days of antibiotherapy were included. When compared to PTZ, exposure to another anti-pseudomonal agent was associated with lower AKI risk (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.80-0.91; p < .001). When compared to vancomycin, exposure to another anti-MRSA was also associated with lower AKI risk (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.64-0.80; p < .001). Finally, when compared to the PTZ-vancomycin combination, exposure to another regimen with a similar coverage was associated with an even lower risk (OR, 0.63; 95% CI; 0.54-0.73; p < .001). A sensitivity analysis of patients with high illness severity showed similar results.These results suggest that the risk of AKI in ICU patients requiring antibiotherapy may be partially mitigated by the choice of antibiotics administered. Further clinical trials are required to confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W4220660321,"The significant adverse social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has cast broader light on the importance of addressing social determinants of health (SDOH). Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (MMCOs) have increasingly taken on a leadership role in integrating medical and social services for Medicaid members. However, the experiences of MMCOs in addressing member social needs during the pandemic has not yet been examined.The purpose of this study was to describe MMCOs' experiences with addressing the social needs of Medicaid members during the COVID-19 pandemic.The study was a qualitative study using data from 28 semi-structured interviews with representatives from 14 MMCOs, including state-specific markets of eight national and regional managed care organizations. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.Four themes emerged: the impact of the pandemic, SDOH response efforts, an expanding definition of SDOH, and managed care beyond COVID-19. Specifically, participants discussed the impact of the pandemic on enrollees, communities, and healthcare delivery, and detailed their evolving efforts to address member nonmedical needs during the pandemic. They reported an increased demand for social services coupled with a significant retraction of community social service resources. To address these emerging social service gaps, participants described mounting a prompt and adaptable response that was facilitated by strong existing relationships with community partners.Among MMCOs, the COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the importance of addressing member social needs, and the need for broader consideration of what constitutes SDOH from a healthcare delivery standpoint."
https://openalex.org/W4220718136,"Once numbering in the tens of millions, bison (Bison bison) have faced a broad range of challenges over the past century, including genetic impacts from the population bottleneck in the 1800s, and significant loss and fragmentation of habitat resulting in little opportunity for population growth on remaining small, geographically isolated reserves. To identify best practices for bison stewardship against this backdrop, managers must understand the genetic composition of existing conservation herds. This study characterized 14 plains bison (Bison bison bison) herds managed by the U.S. Department of Interior and Parks Canada Agency based on complete mtDNA control region sequences. Among 209 bison, we detected 11 major mtDNA control region haplotypes based on nucleotide substitutions and 23 sub-haplotypes where indels are considered. We determined matrilineal relationships between the herds and compared our genetic findings to historic records. The recent common ancestry of modern bison deriving from small, scattered groups combined with gene flow through foundation and translocation events between herds during the last 100 years, is reflected in Fst value (0.21), haplotype (0.48 ± 0.04) and nucleotide (0.004 ± 0.002) diversities, and mean number of pairwise differences (3.38 ± 1.74). Genetic diversity was distributed unevenly among herds, with 21.41% of genetic variation observed between herds. Median joining network, together with trends in the Tajima's D and Fs tests, revealed two patterns in the recent evolution of mtDNA sequences in bison: mutational process has generated diversity with a Hap 1 haplotype epicenter, and missed mtDNA haplotypes exist in the network due to bottleneck, loss through management practices, or incomplete sampling of specimens across conservation herds. This work significantly expands characterization of the genetic diversity among bison conservation herds, providing additional decision support for managers considering restoring gene flow to achieve long-term species viability."

This study aims to evaluate the capacity of BOLD-MRI, which is possible to evaluate the oxygenation state of kidneys with renal artery stenosis (RAS).We performed BOLD-MRI for 40 patients with RAS and for 30 healthy volunteers. We then performed post-scan processing and analysis of manually drawn regions of interest to determine R2* values (relaxation rates) for the renal cortex and medulla. We compared R2* values in patients with RAS with those in the control group, and also compared these values for subgroups with varying degrees of stenosis.Medulla R2* values were higher than cortex R2* values in the control group. There was no significant difference in R2* values for different segments (upper, middle, lower) of the kidneys. Both cortex and medulla R2* values in patients with RAS were significantly higher than corresponding R2* values in the control group (P < 0.05), and BOLD-MRI was more sensitive to changes in the R2* values in the medulla than in the cortex. Among different subgroups in the RAS group, the medulla R2* values were significantly higher in kidneys with severe stenosis than in those with no obvious obstruction, mild stenosis, or moderate stenosis (P < 0.05).BOLD-MRI is an effective, noninvasive method for evaluating kidney oxygenation, which is important for proper treatment in RAS. It is sufficiently sensitive for detecting medulla ischemia and anoxia of the kidneys."

However, chromosome therapy has been developed to correct the extra chromosome in cultured patient cells, and it was recently reported that during reprogramming into iPSCs, fibroblasts from a Down syndrome patient lost the extra chromosome 21 due to a phenomenon called trisomy-biased chromosome loss. To gain preliminary insights into the underlying mechanism of trisomy rescue during the early stages of reprogramming, we reprogrammed skin fibroblasts from patients with trisomy syndromes 21, 18, 13, and 9 to iPSC, and evaluated the genomes of the individual iPSC colonies by molecular cytogenetic techniques. We report the spontaneous correction from trisomy to disomy upon cell reprogramming in at least one cell line examined from each of the trisomy syndromes, and three possible combinations of chromosomes were selected in the isogenic trisomy-rescued iPSC clones. Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis showed that the trisomy-rescued clones exhibited either heterodisomy or segmental uniparental isodisomy, ruling out the possibility that two trisomic chromosomes were lost simultaneously and the remaining one was duplicated, suggesting instead that one trisomic chromosome was lost to generate disomic cells. These results demonstrated that trisomy rescue may be a phenomenon with random loss of the extra chromosome and subsequent selection for disomic iPSCs, which is analogous to the karyotype correction in early preimplantation embryos. Our finding is relevant for elucidating the mechanisms of autonomous karyotype correction and future application in basic and clinical research on aneuploidy disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4220829325,"In Indonesia, a significant number of tuberculosis (TB) cases may be missed, due to the low sensitivity and specificity of the currently used diagnostic algorithm. In this regard, the rapid molecular test using Xpert MTB/RIF, which has recently been introduced in Indonesia, can improve case detection. Thus, this study determined the cost and affordability of incorporating Xpert MTB/RIF testing for TB diagnosis. For this purpose, we estimated the costs (from the health system and societal perspectives) of reaching the TB detection target in Depok municipality, and applied the findings to the West Java province of Indonesia. The resources available for the health and TB program were also analyzed to support the decision to scale up the TB diagnosis using Xpert MTB/RIF testing. According to the results, the unit cost for TB diagnosis per person was USD 27.22 and USD 70.16 from the health system and societal perspectives, respectively. To reach the target of 109,843 TB cases for the 2020-2024 time period, Depok municipality would need USD 2,989,927 and USD 2,549,455 from the health system viewpoint, assuming the machine's lifespan of five and 10 years, respectively. Extrapolating these results to the West Java province, USD 56,353,833 would be necessary to test 2,076,413 cases from 2019 to 2024. However, in order to accelerate the case detection target up to 2024, West Java requires additional funds. The implication of the findings is that the central government must consider local capacity to accelerate TB case detection and ensure that the installation of Xpert MTB/RIF machines is included in the overall costs."
https://openalex.org/W4220846871,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is an important public health concern. Limited information exists on disparities in the quality of HCV care. We examine disparities in genotype or quantitative HCV ribonucleic acid testing before and after starting HCV treatment, and screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in HCV patients with cirrhosis.This national study included Medicare beneficiaries with HCV between 2014 and 2017. We used bivariate probit to estimate the probability of receiving recommended tests before and after HCV treatment by patient race/ethnicity, urban/rural residence, and socioeconomic status. We used multivariate logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of HCC screening among beneficiaries with cirrhosis by patient factors.Of 41,800 Medicare patients with HCV treatment, 93.47% and 84.99% received pre- and post-treatment testing. Patients in racial minority groups had lower probabilities of pre- and post-treatment testing than whites. Rural residents were less likely to receive a post-treatment test (Coef. = -0.06, 95% CI: -0.11, -0.01). Among HCV patients with cirrhosis, 40% (24,021) received at least one semi-annual HCC screening during the study period. The odds of HCC screening were 14% lower in rural than in urban patients (aOR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.80, 0.92), lower in African Americans (aOR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.90, 0.96), but higher among Hispanics than in whites (aOR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.15). There was no significant association between ZIP-level income or education and HCC screening.Disparities in the quality of HCV care existed by patient race/ethnicity, urban/rural residence, and socioeconomic status. Continued efforts are needed to improve the quality of care for all HCV patients-especially rural patients and racial/ethnic minorities."
https://openalex.org/W4220992501,"This study investigated the associations between socio-economic deprivation and tuberculosis (TB) treatment outcomes, alongside well-known TB risk factors. The effects of healthcare expenditures and their growth on trends in TB incidence from 2009 to 2013 were also assessed.Secondary data analysis was performed on data obtained from various sources including governmental, non-governmental and research institutions. Indicators for TB treatment outcomes included TB death rate, TB rate among the household contacts of the Index TB cases, TB treatment failure, HIV associated TB death rate, TB defaulter rate, and new TB smear positive cases. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Turkey's tests for post-hoc analysis were used to compare means of variables of interest considering a type I error rate of 0.05. Regression models and canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) were used to explore the associations between trends in TB incidence and independent TB predictors. During CDA, Fischer's linear functions, Eigen values, and Mahalanobis distances were determined with values of Wilk's Lambda closer to zero being the evidence for well discriminated patient groups. Data analysis was performed using SPSS® statistical software version 23.0 (Chicago, IL).In total, 62 400 records of TB notification were analyzed for the period 2009-2013. The average TB incidence rate over a 5-year period was 298 cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year. The incidence of TB was reduced by 79.70% at the end of the evaluation as compared to the baseline data in 2009. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the Expenditure per patient day equivalent (PDE) and PHC expenditure per capita were significantly and independently associated with the decline of TB incidence (adjusted R2 = 60%; ρ = 0.002) following the equation: Y = (- 209× Expenditure per PDE) + (- 0.191 × PHC expenditure per capita). CDA showed that in the most socio-economically deprived communities (quintile 1), HIV associated TB death rates were significantly more likely to be higher as compared to the least socio-economically deprived group (quintile 5) [Eigen value (12.95), function coefficient (1.49) > (.77); Wilk's Lambda = .019, p < .0001].Although TB control programs in OR Tambo district have averted thousands of TB incident cases, their effects on HIV associated TB deaths among the most deprived communities remain insignificant. There is an urgent need for strengthening integration of TB/HIV services in most deprived settings."
https://openalex.org/W4221051633,"Gestational diabetes (GDM) is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease. It is uncertain whether GDM is independently associated with the risk of chronic kidney disease. The aim was to examine the association between GDM and maternal CKD and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and to determine whether this depends on progression to overt T2DM.A population-based cohort study was designed using Swedish national registry data. Previous GDM diagnosis was the main exposure, and this was stratified according to whether women developed T2DM after pregnancy. Using Cox regression models, we estimated the risk of CKD (stages 3-5), ESKD and different CKD subtypes (tubulointerstitial, glomerular, hypertensive, diabetic, other).There were 1,121,633 women included, of whom 15,595 (1·4%) were diagnosed with GDM. Overall, GDM-diagnosed women were at increased risk of CKD (aHR 1·81, 95% CI 1·54-2·14) and ESKD (aHR 4·52, 95% CI 2·75-7·44). Associations were strongest for diabetic CKD (aHR 8·81, 95% CI 6·36-12·19) and hypertensive CKD (aHR 2·46, 95% CI 1·06-5·69). These associations were largely explained by post-pregnancy T2DM. Among women who had GDM + subsequent T2DM, strong associations were observed (CKD, aHR 21·70, 95% CI 17·17-27·42; ESKD, aHR 112·37, 95% CI 61·22-206·38). But among those with GDM only, associations were non-significant (CKD, aHR 1·11, 95% CI 0·89-1·38; ESKD, aHR 1·58, 95% CI 0·70-3·60 respectively).Women who experience GDM and subsequent T2DM are at increased risk of developing CKD and ESKD. However, GDM-diagnosed women who never develop overt T2DM have similar risk of future CKD/ESKD to those with uncomplicated pregnancies."
https://openalex.org/W3206683977,"Just like the scientific data they generate, simulation workflows for research should be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). However, while significant progress has been made towards FAIR data, the majority of science and engineering workflows used in research remain poorly documented and often unavailable, involving ad hoc scripts and manual steps, hindering reproducibility and stifling progress. We introduce Sim2Ls (pronounced simtools) and the Sim2L Python library that allow developers to create and share end-to-end computational workflows with well-defined and verified inputs and outputs. The Sim2L library makes Sim2Ls, their requirements, and their services discoverable, verifies inputs and outputs, and automatically stores results in a globally-accessible simulation cache and results database. This simulation ecosystem is available in nanoHUB, an open platform that also provides publication services for Sim2Ls, a computational environment for developers and users, and the hardware to execute runs and store results at no cost. We exemplify the use of Sim2Ls using two applications and discuss best practices towards FAIR simulation workflows and associated data."
https://openalex.org/W4220655538,"Kinetics of copeptin and mid regional proadrenomedullin (MR-proADM) during febrile pediatric lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are unknown. We aimed to analyze kinetic profiles of copeptin and MR-proADM and the impact of clinical and laboratory factors on those biomarkers.This is a retrospective post-hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial, evaluating procalcitonin guidance for antibiotic treatment of LRTI (ProPAED-study). In 175 pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department plasma copeptin and MR-proADM concentrations were determined on day 1, 3, and 5. Their association with clinical characteristics and other inflammatory biomarkers were tested by non-linear mixed effect modelling.Median copeptin and MR-proADM values were elevated on day 1 and decreased during on day 3 and 5 (-26%; -34%, respectively). The initial concentrations of MR-proADM at inclusion were higher in patients receiving antibiotics intravenously compared to oral administration (difference 0.62 pmol/L, 95%CI 0.44;1.42, p<0.001). Intensive care unit (ICU) admission was associated with a daily increase of MR-proADM (increase/day 1.03 pmol/L, 95%CI 0.43;1.50, p<0.001). Positive blood culture in patients with antibiotic treatment and negative results on nasopharyngeal aspirates, or negative blood culture were associated with a decreasing MR-proADM (decrease/day -0.85 pmol/L, 95%CI -0.45;-1.44), p<0.001).Elevated MR-proADM and increases thereof were associated with ICU admission suggesting the potential as a prognostic factor for severe pediatric LRTI. MR-proADM might only bear limited value for decision making on stopping antibiotics due to its slow decrease. Copeptin had no added value in our setting."
https://openalex.org/W4220692508,"Diabetes is a chronic disease requiring extensive self-care. Different impulsivity constructs, including choice-based and self-report personality measures are associated with decreasing diabetes self-care adherence. However, both choice-based and self-report impulsivity have never been measured for individuals diagnosed with either Type 2 or prediabetes in the same study. The current study examined the relationship between impulsivity and diabetes self-care in 101 adults diagnosed with either Type 2 or prediabetes. Results indicated that increasing self-reported impulsiveness was significantly correlated with decreasing Type 2 diabetic self-care, whereas the choice-based measure was not associated with any self-care measure. No association between impulsivity and self-care was significant for individuals diagnosed with prediabetes. Path analyses showed that self-reported impulsiveness directly and positively predicted problems controlling blood sugar levels in individuals diagnosed with either prediabetes or Type 2 diabetes. However, self-reported impulsiveness only indirectly and negatively predicted exercise and diet adherence via diabetes management self-efficacy for individuals diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. These results show what specific impulsivity constructs and diabetes management self-efficacy may be incorporated into interventions for increasing specific self-care behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W4220698776,"This study investigates how research data contributes to non-academic impacts using a secondary analysis of high-scoring impact case studies from the UK's Research Excellence Framework (REF). A content analysis was conducted to identify patterns, linking research data and impact. The most prevalent type of research data-driven impact related to ""practice"" (45%), which included changing how professionals operate, changing organizational culture and improving workplace productivity or outcomes. The second most common category was ""government impacts"", including reducing government service costs and enhancing government effectiveness or efficiency. Impacts from research data were developed most frequently through ""improved institutional processes or methods"" (40%) and developing impact via pre-analyzed or curated information in reports (32%), followed by ""analytic software or methods"" (26%). The analysis found that research data on their own rarely generate impacts. Instead they require analysis, curation, product development or other forms of significant intervention to leverage broader non-academic impacts."
https://openalex.org/W4220915117,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic early in 2020 forced universities to shut down their campuses and transition to emergency remote instruction (ERI). Students had to quickly adapt to this new mode of instruction while dealing with all other distractions caused by the pandemic. This study integrates extensive data from students' institutional records at a large Historically Black College and University (HBCU) institution with data from a students' survey about the impact of COVID-19 on learning during the Spring 2020 semester to examine the impact of the transition to ERI on students' performance and identify the main factors explaining variations in students' performance. The main findings of our analysis are: (a) students' university experience was positively correlated with performance (continuing students who spent at least one academic year at the university prior to the outbreak had better performance than freshman and new transfer students), (b) students' perceived change in performance after the transition was positively associated with actual performance (students who perceived a decline in their performance after transition to ERI had significantly worse performance than other students), and (c) students' prior online learning experiences and students' emotional experiences with the COVID-19 disease were not significantly associated with performance. These results suggest that the approaches adopted by higher education institutions to support students during times of crisis should pay special attention to certain groups of students."
https://openalex.org/W4220936591,"Inappropriate and excessive antibiotic use fuels the development of antibiotic resistance. Determinants of antibiotic use, including knowledge and attitudes, are manifold and vary on different spatial scales. The objective of this study was to examine the associations between socio-spatially diverse urban areas and knowledge, attitudes, practices and antibiotic use within a metropolitan city. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the general population in socio-spatially different areas in Dortmund, Germany, in February and March 2020. Three urban areas were chosen to represent diverse socio-spatial contexts (socio-spatially disadvantaged: A, intermediate: B, socio-spatially disadvantaged: C). Participants were selected via simple random sampling. The questionnaire comprised knowledge and attitude statements and questions around antibiotic use and handling practices. Differences between the areas were examined by estimating odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals by multiple logistic regression. Overall, 158 participants were included. Participants of Area C showed the lowest proportions of correct knowledge statements, indicated more often attitudes contrary to common recommendations, lower risk awareness and reported more often antibiotic use (C: 40.8%; A: 32.7%; B: 26.5%) and potential mishandling practices (C: 30.4%; A: 9.6%; B: 17.3%). The multiple logistic regression confirmed these differences. Around 42.3% (C), 33.3% (A) and 20.0% (B) of the diseases mentioned for which an antibiotic was used are mainly caused by viral pathogens. A common misconception across all areas was the perception of antibiotic resistance as an individual rather than a universal issue. This study reveals distinct differences between socio-spatially diverse urban areas within a metropolitan city, regarding knowledge, attitudes and practices around antibiotics and ABR. Our findings confirm that enhanced efforts are required to better inform the population about the adequate use and handling of antibiotics. This study emphasizes the need for future interventions to be tailored to the specific local socio-economic context."

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of wearing a mask in the general population of a developing country at three major tertiary care hospital.Participants of this cross-sectional study were patients and attendants at three major tertiary care hospital of Karachi Pakistan. Selected participants, through non-probability convenient sampling technique, were interviewed regarding knowledge, attitude, and practice of wearing mask using an Urdu translated version of a questionnaire used in an earlier study. Three summary scores (0 to 100) were computed to indicate participants' mask wearing practice, technique of putting it on, and technique of taking if off. Collected data were analyzed with the help of IBM SPSS version 19.A total of 370 selected individuals were interviewed, out of which 51.9% were male and mean age was 37.65±11.94 years. For more than 90% of the participants, wearing a face mask was a routine practicing during the pandemic. The mean practice score was 65.69±25.51, score for technique of putting on a face mask was 67.77±23.03, and score of technique of taking off a face mask was 51.01±29.23. Education level of participant tends to have positive relationship with all three scores, while presence of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as co-morbid had negative impact on mask wearing practice.We have observed suboptimal knowledge, attitude and practice of wearing mask among the selected individuals. There is a continued need to spread awareness and educate general population about the importance of using a face mask, as well as the proper technique of wearing and taking off a face mask."

Despite the great benefits of herbal medicine, quality assessment methods for these medicinal herbs are lacking. The young leaves from Artemisia species are generally used, and most of the species have similar morphology, which often leads to adulteration and misuse. This study assembled five complete chloroplast genomes of three Artemisia species, two accessions of A . gmelinii and A . capillaris , and one A . fukudo . Through comparative analysis, we revealed genomic variations and phylogenetic relationships between these species and developed seven InDel-based barcode markers which discriminated the tested species from each other. Additionally, we analyzed specialized metabolites from the species using LC-MS and suggested chemical markers for the identification and authentication of these herbs. We expect that this integrated and complementary authentication method would aid in reducing the misuse of Artemisia species."

PWH were on stable ART for six-months or more. Vascular assessments included flow-mediated dilation (FMD), aortic, radial and femoral arterial stiffness (cAIx, crPWV, cfPWV), and thigh and calf arterial compliance (Vmax50). Endothelial repair was indexed by endothelial progenitor cell colony forming units (EPC-CFU). Traditional CVD risk measures included blood pressure, central adiposity, lipids, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), CRP and ASCVD score. Analyses controlled for demographics (age, sex, education), medications (antihypertensive, statin/fibrate, antipsychotic), and substance abuse (ASSIST).No group differences were observed in central adiposity, HOMA-IR, CRP, or ASCVD risk score. However, the ABC- group displayed greater dyslipidemia. The ABC+ group displayed no difference on FMD, cAIx, cfPWV or calf Vmax50 compared with other groups. When CD4 count and viral load were controlled, no additional differences between the ABC+ and ABC- groups emerged. Analyses of crPWV and thigh Vmax50 suggested supported by a trend toward lower EPC-CFU in the HIV+ groups than the HIV- group.Findings indicate that ABC treatment of 30-50 year-old PWH on stable ART is not likely to contribute in a robust way to higher CVD risk."
https://openalex.org/W4220827309,"Eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides W. Bartram ex Marshall) and hybrid poplars are well-known bioenergy crops. With advances in tree breeding, it is increasingly necessary to find economical ways to identify high-performing Populus genotypes that can be planted under different environmental conditions. Photosynthesis and leaf nitrogen content are critical parameters for plant growth, however, measuring them is an expensive and time-consuming process. Instead, these parameters can be quickly estimated from hyperspectral leaf reflectance if robust statistical models can be developed. To this end, we measured photosynthetic capacity parameters (Rubisco-limited carboxylation rate (Vcmax), electron transport-limited carboxylation rate (Jmax), and triose phosphate utilization-limited carboxylation rate (TPU)), nitrogen per unit leaf area (Narea), and leaf reflectance of seven taxa and 62 genotypes of Populus from two study plantations in Mississippi. For statistical modeling, we used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and principal component analysis (PCA). Our results showed that the predictive ability of LASSO and PCA models was comparable, except for Narea in which LASSO was superior. In terms of model interpretability, LASSO outperformed PCA because the LASSO models needed 2 to 4 spectral reflectance wavelengths to estimate parameters. The LASSO models used reflectance values at 758 and 935 nm for estimating Vcmax (R2 = 0.51 and RMSPE = 31%) and Jmax (R2 = 0.54 and RMSPE = 32%); 687, 746, and 757 nm for estimating TPU (R2 = 0.56 and RMSPE = 31%); and 304, 712, 921, and 1021 nm for estimating Narea (R2 = 0.29 and RMSPE = 21%). The PCA model also identified 935 nm as a significant wavelength for estimating Vcmax and Jmax. Therefore, our results suggest that hyperspectral leaf reflectance modeling can be used as a cost-effective means for field phenotyping and rapid screening of Populus genotypes because of its capacity to estimate these physicochemical parameters."

The clinical relevance of the ABI, especially in patients with known clinically manifest cardiovascular disease (CVD), is unknown. The authors set out to investigate the relationship between a screen-detected ABI and the risk for future cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with clinically manifest CVD.Patients with clinically manifest CVD were selected from the UCC-SMART cohort (n = 8360) and divided into four groups: normal ABI (0.91-1.39), screen-detected low ABI ≤ 0.9, screen-detected high ABI ≥ 1.4, and patients with known PAD irrespective of their ABI. Adjusted Cox Proportional Hazard Ratios (HRs) for Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE), Major Adverse Limb Events (MALE), and all-cause mortality were calculated. In addition, stratified analyses for women and men and for the presence of diabetes were performed.During a median follow-up of 8.3 years (IQR 7.7) 1646 MACE, 601 MALE and 1958 all-cause mortalities were observed. Compared with normal ABI patients, patients with a screen-detected low ABI and patients with manifest PAD had a higher risk of MACE, MALE, and all-cause mortality with HRs of 1.9 (95% CI 1.6-2.2) for MACE, 7.6 (95% CI 5.7-10.1) for MALE, 1.7 (95% CI 1.5-2.0) for mortality and 1.3 (95% CI 1.2-1.5) for MACE, 13.8 (95% CI 11.1-17.1) for MALE, 1.7 (95% CI 1.5-1.9) for mortality, respectively. Screen-detected high ABI did not increase the risk of either MACE or MALE, however, was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality with a HR of 0.6 (95% CI 0.5-0.9). Stratified analyses for women & men and for diabetes status were comparable for all three outcomes.In patients with manifest CVD but without PAD, a screen-detected low ABI is a powerful risk indicator for cardiovascular events, limb events, and all-cause mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4220948009,"Having a large receptive vocabulary benefits speech-in-noise recognition for young children, though this is not always the case for older children or adults. These observations could indicate that effects of receptive vocabulary size on speech-in-noise recognition differ depending on familiarity of the target words, with effects observed only for more recently acquired and less frequent words. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate effects of vocabulary size on open-set speech-in-noise recognition for adults with normal hearing. Targets were words acquired at 4, 9, 12 and 15 years of age, and they were presented at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of -5 and -7 dB. Percent correct scores tended to fall with increasing age of acquisition (AoA), with the caveat that performance at -7 dB SNR was better for words acquired at 9 years of age than earlier- or later-acquired words. Similar results were obtained whether the AoA of the target words was blocked or mixed across trials. Differences in word duration appear to account for nonmonotonic effects of AoA. For all conditions, a positive correlation was observed between recognition and vocabulary size irrespective of target word AoA, indicating that effects of vocabulary size are not limited to recently acquired words. This dataset does not support differential assessment of AoA, lexical frequency, and other stimulus features known to affect lexical access."

The method used was a Mix Methods Research Approach, which is a combination of qualitative descriptive and quantitative exploratory approaches. There were 150 respondents for the three research locations at Palu City, Sigi Regency and Donggala Regency. Respondents were selected by considering the event conditions experienced, physical damage to their house and their educational background. Media sources of disaster information analyzed were TV, internet, mobile phone (WA/SMS), radio, mosque/church, surau, community leaders and word of mouth. The data used was Likert scale analyses for perception tested with Rank Spearman Correlation. The results showed that the most significant panic level (α<0.01) was when the internet was not working, cellphones could not be used, and radio broadcasts could not be received. The most effective sources of disaster information in promoting a resilience attitude were guidance and advice from community leaders and ecological communication that was built from word of mouth. The exposure to natural disasters was shown to unite peoples' hearts in friendship. despite some did not communicate with each other before the disaster, some were even hostile. As many as 78.6% of respondents admitted that the affection between them as victims actually appeared when natural disasters destroyed the joints of their lives, even amongst those who did not communicate with each other, or were even hostile, before the disaster. Out of ecological communication, a ""strong hug due to natural disasters"" was born."

In Japan, VDD is quite prevalent in all age groups, with its high risk in young women. Furthermore, its association during pregnancy with gestational hypertension and low birth weight has also been reported. VDD can be diagnosed by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels, which, however, is not suited for screening. Therefore, we will create a predictive model for serum 25(OH)D concentration and prevalence of VDD based on such data as region, sun exposure habit, and vitamin D intake in young women.From 2020 to 2022, we conduct a cross-sectional study of 600 young women in four regions of Japan, identify the indices associated with serum 25(OH)D concentrations such as sun exposure habits, habitual vitamin D intake, ultraviolet-B irradiation, seasons (summer and winter) and latitude, and construct prediction models for serum 25(OH)D concentrations and VDD risk. This study has been registered with UMIN-CTR (ID: UMIN000041527).One hundred and fifteen subjects have been collected from 6 institutions in winter as of May 2021. When data from more than 200 subjects have become available, we will conduct the interim analysis, summarize the data by region and facility, review the inclusion criteria for analysis, and check for missing values and outliers. Prediction models for serum 25(OH)D concentration and VDD will be determined in the final analysis when all cases have been collected.A screening tool for VDD risk to be developed in our study based on the predictive model would help the public and medical professionals prevent lifestyle-related diseases through improving VDD.

Nevertheless, MV is associated with numerous complications and increased mortality. The aim of this study is to define the effects of MV on gene expression of direct and peripheral human tissues.Classification models were applied to Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) gene expression data of six representative tissues-liver, adipose, skin, nerve-tibial, muscle and lung, for performance comparison and feature analysis. We utilized 18 prediction models using the Random Forest (RF), XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) decision tree and ANN (Artificial Neural Network) methods to classify ventilation and non-ventilation samples and to compare their prediction performance for the six tissues. In the model comparison, the AUC (area under receiver operating curve), accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were used to evaluate the predictive performance of each model. We then conducted feature analysis per each tissue to detect MV marker genes followed by pathway enrichment analysis for these genes.XGBoost outperformed the other methods and predicted samples had undergone MV with an average accuracy for the six tissues of 0.951 and average AUC of 0.945. The feature analysis detected a combination of MV marker genes per each tested tissue, some common across several tissues. MV marker genes were mainly related to inflammation and fibrosis as well as cell development and movement regulation. The MV marker genes were significantly enriched in inflammatory and viral pathways.The XGBoost method demonstrated clear enhanced performance and feature analysis compared to the other models. XGBoost was helpful in detecting the tissue-specific marker genes for identifying transcriptomic changes related to MV. Our results show that MV is associated with reduced development and movement in the tissues and higher inflammation and injury not only in direct tissues such as the lungs but also in peripheral tissues and thus should be carefully considered before being implemented."

We sought to obtain an overview and the attributable effect of impaired glomerular filtration on multiple domains in cognition and dimensions of quality of life for community-based healthy older adults in Taiwan.The study was derived from the Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan (NAHSIT) 2013-2016, a nationwide cross-sectional study conducted to sample healthy, community-based older adults aged ≥65 years in Taiwan. Participants were categorized into four CKD groups: CKD stage 1, stage 2, stages 3a and 3b, and stages 4-5. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the QoL questionnaire derived from the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) were measured. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) and principal component regressions were employed for the analysis and validation, respectively.Participants with moderate CKD (stages 3a and 3b) showed deficits in global MMSE, domain orientation to time, calculation, complex commands, and role-physical and vitality in QoL questionnaires. In GLMMs, impaired eGFR per 30 mL/min/1.73 m² was associated with lower global MMSE scores (β = -0.807, standard error [SE] = 0.235, P = 0.0007), domain orientation to time (β = -0.155, SE = 0.047, P = 0.0011), calculation (β = -0.338, SE = 0.109, P = 0.0020), complex commands (β = -0.156, SE = 0.079, P = 0.0494), and role-physical (β = -2.219, SE = 0.779, P = 0.0046) dimensions of QoL.Elderly Han Chinese adults with moderately impaired renal filtration could manifest cognitive deficits in orientation to time, calculation, and impaired quality of life in physical role functioning."
https://openalex.org/W4220758641,"The precursor of heme, protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), accumulates abundantly in the uteri of birds, such as Japanese quail, Coturnix japonica, which has brown-speckled eggshells; however, the molecular basis of PPIX production in the uterus remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the cause of low PPIX production in a classical Japanese quail mutant exhibiting white eggshells by comparing its gene expression in the uterus with that of the wild type using transcriptome analysis. We also performed genetic linkage analysis to identify the causative genomic region of the white eggshell phenotype. We found that 11 genes, including 5'-aminolevulinate synthase 1 (ALAS1) and hephaestin-like 1 (HEPHL1), were specifically upregulated in the wild-type uterus and downregulated in the mutant. We mapped the 172 kb candidate genomic region on chromosome 6, which contains several genes, including a part of the paired-like homeodomain 3 (PITX3), which encodes a transcription factor. ALAS1, HEPHL1, and PITX3 were expressed in the apical cells of the luminal epithelium and lamina propria cells of the uterine mucosa of the wild-type quail, while their expression levels were downregulated in the cells of the mutant quail. Biochemical analysis using uterine homogenates indicated that the restricted availability of 5'-aminolevulinic acid is the main cause of low PPIX production. These results suggest that uterus-specific transcriptional regulation of heme-biosynthesis-related genes is an evolutionarily acquired mechanism of eggshell pigment production in Japanese quail. Based on these findings, we discussed the molecular basis of PPIX production in the uteri of Japanese quails."
https://openalex.org/W4220783297,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a prevalent disease throughout the world. The extent of TB illness in childhood is not clear; recent data shows that 10-20% of the cases are found in children under 15 years old. In 2017, 1 million children developed the disease, of which 9% were co-infected with HIV.A cross-sectional study that analyzed 48 children diagnosed with HIV-infection in Guadalajara, Mexico. The tuberculin skin test (TST) and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT) were performed and compared to diagnose latent TB infection (LTBI).The average age was 9 years old (± 4), with an age range of 1-16 years; the 6-12-year-old group predominated with 50% of cases. 27 patients (56%) were male; 83% had received the BCG vaccination and 23% had a history of being contacts of TB cases. In the study, 40 patients (83%) were without immunosuppression; seven (15%) with moderate immunosuppression, and only one patient had severe immunodeficiency. Overall, 3 of the 48 children (6.2%) had a positive TST, while 8 out of 48 (16.6%) had a positive QFT. The concordance between the two tests was 89.6% (43/48) with Kappa = 0.5 (95% CI, 0.14-0.85).The QFT test represents an opportunity in the diagnosis of LTBI, particularly in pediatric HIV- patients. This is the first study that compares the two tests (TST and QFT) in children with HIV-infection in Guadalajara, Mexico."
https://openalex.org/W4220813789,"The relationship between salivary α-amylase activity (ssAAa) and the risk of metabolic disorders remains equivocal. We aimed to assess this relationship in adults from Qatar, where obesity and type 2 diabetes are highly prevalent. We cross-sectionally quantified ssAAa in saliva and estimated AMY1 CN from whole-genome sequencing data from 1499 participants. Linear regression was used to assess the relationship between ssAAa and adiposity and glycemic markers. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between ssAAa and occurrence of obesity or diabetes. The mean and median ssAAa were significantly lower in obese individuals. There were significant inverse associations between ssAAa and BMI, and fat mass. We detected a marked effect of ssAAa on reduced odds of obesity after adjusting for age and sex, glucose, LDL, HLD, total cholesterol, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (OR per ssAAa unit 0.998 [95% CI 0.996–0.999], p = 0.005), with ssAAa ranging between 6.8 and 422U/mL. The obesity odds were significantly lower in the upper half of the ssAAa distributional (OR 0.58 [95% CI 0.42–0.76], p&lt;0.001) and lower in the top versus the bottom decile of the ssAAa distribution (OR 0.46 [95% CI 0.23–0.92], p = 0.03). Our findings suggest a potential beneficial relationship between high sAAa in saliva and low odds of obesity in Qatari adults."
https://openalex.org/W4220875478,"Italy records very alarming levels antimicrobial resistance (AMR), so a National Action Plan on Antimicrobial resistance (PNCAR) was developed, adopting the AMR European Union's recommendations based on the results of the ECDC site visit of January 2017. For achieving PNCAR objectives, it is necessary to support and harmonize the implementation of recommendations in all the different healthcare levels (regional authorities and local trusts), so the SPiNCAR project was launched to create a tool for reaching this goal.We developed a framework based on a scientific literature and national and international guidelines. Firstly, we identified the major intervention areas for tackling AMR, then, for each area, we built a set of standards, both for regional authorities than for local trusts. Every standard is composed by a set of essential and additional criteria, which refer to a minimum or supplemental performance level respectively. The contents were firstly discussed by the project's team during face-to-face kick-off meetings, then confirmed with Delphi methodology and finally validated through a pilot study.The final framework consists of seven different areas that reflect the PNCAR structure: Governance, Surveillance and Monitoring, Appropriate Use of antimicrobials, Healthcare-associated Infections (HAIs) control and prevention, Education and Training, Alliance among Stakeholders, Implementation. The total number of standards for the regional framework was 34 with 264 criteria and for the local version 36 criteria with 279 standards.The ongoing use of this tool, developed on international evidences and recommendations that were tailored on the Italian specific context, allows monitoring the improvement achieved over time and plan the next steps."
https://openalex.org/W4220877432,"This study aimed to explore the effect of education on subjective well-being (SWB) of Chinese rural dwellers who just shook off poverty in 2019 and to investigate the mediating role of social support and moderating role of age on the association.Social support rating scale (SSRS) and General Well-Being Schedule (GWBS) were administrated among 1094 Chinese rural dwellers from Anqing, Anhui Province, China. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and multi-group SEM were performed to examine the mediating role of social support and moderating role of age in the link between education and SWB, respectively.The findings indicated that social support fully mediated the relationship between education and SWB in rural residents. Age moderated the indirect relationship between education and SWB (first stage moderation model) such that the effect of education on social support would be strengthened with aging process.The results add to our understanding of the protective role of education in SWB among Chinese rural dwellers, and shed new light on the potential mechanisms underlying the association between education and SWB with respect to the mediating role of social support and moderating role of age."
https://openalex.org/W4220880347,"The underlying genetic mechanisms affecting turkey growth traits have not been widely investigated. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is a powerful approach to identify candidate regions associated with complex phenotypes and diseases in livestock. In the present study, we performed GWAS to identify regions associated with 18-week body weight in a turkey population. The data included body weight observations for 24,989 female turkeys genotyped based on a 65K SNP panel. The analysis was carried out using a univariate mixed linear model with hatch-week-year and the 2 top principal components fitted as fixed effects and the accumulated polygenic effect of all markers captured by the genomic relationship matrix as random. Thirty-three significant markers were observed on 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 12 chromosomes, while 26 showed strong linkage disequilibrium extending up to 410 kb. These significant markers were mapped to 37 genes, of which 13 were novel. Interestingly, many of the investigated genes are known to be involved in growth and body weight. For instance, genes AKR1D1, PARP12, BOC, NCOA1, ADCY3 and CHCHD7 regulate growth, body weight, metabolism, digestion, bile acid biosynthetic and development of muscle cells. In summary, the results of our study revealed novel candidate genomic regions and candidate genes that could be managed within a turkey breeding program and adapted in fine mapping of quantitative trait loci to enhance genetic improvement in this species."
https://openalex.org/W4220882791,"Background Healthy life expectancy (HLE) is becoming an important indicator of population health. While actuarial estimates of HLE are frequently studied, there is scarcity of research on the subjective expectations of people about their HLE. The objective of this study is to compare actuarial and subjective HLE (sHLE) estimates in the ≥50-year-old Hungarian general population. Furthermore, we assessed subjective life expectancy (sLE) and explored determinants of the individual variance of sHLE and sLE. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in 2019. Subjective health expectations were measured at 60, 70, 80 and 90 years of age via the Global Activity Limitation Indicator (GALI). Point-estimates of sLE and background variables were also recorded. sHLE was estimated from GALI and sLE responses. Actuarial estimates of life expectancy (LE) and HLE for 2019 were provided by the Central Statistical Office of Hungary. Results Five hundred and four respondents (female 51.6%) were included. Mean (±SD) age was 63 (±7.5) years. Median LE (81.5 years, 95%CI 81.1–81.7) and sLE (82 years, 95%CI 80–85) were similar ( p = 0.142), while median sHLE (66.8 years, 95%CI 65.5–68.3) was lower than HLE (72.7 years, 95%CI 82.4–82.9) by 5.9 years ( p&lt; 0.001). Despite the greater median actuarial LE of women compared to men ( p&lt; 0.001), we found no gender differences between the median sLE ( p = 0.930), HLE ( p = 0.417) and sHLE ( p = 0.403) values. With less apparent gender differences among the predictors when compared to sLE, sHLE was mainly determined by self-perceived health, age and place of residence, while self-perceived health, close relatives’ longevity, social conditions, happiness and perceived lifestyle influenced sLE. Conclusions Along subjective life expectancy, subjective healthy life expectancy may be a feasible indicator and provide insights to individuals’ subjective expectations underlying the demographic estimates of the healthy life expectancy of the population."
https://openalex.org/W4221019215,"Dipyrone (metamizol) is regularly used in critical care for pain and fever treatment, especially in Germany and Spain. However, indication for antipyretic therapy in critically ill patients is currently unclear and data for both the risk and benefit of dipyrone treatment in the intensive care environment are scarce. We hypothesized that antipyretic efficiency of dipyrone would not exceed antipyretic efficiency of acetaminophen. We therefore aimed to compare temperature courses in critically ill patients receiving either intravenous dipyrone, acetaminophen or no antipyretic medication.We included 937 intensive care unit (ICU) patients with body temperature recordings of at least 37.5°C. We investigated temperature decrease associated with dipyrone or acetaminophen and additionally compared it to an untreated control group.Within the eight-hour study interval, maximum body temperature decrease in patients without antipyretic medication was -0.6°C (IQR: -1.0 to -0.4°C; n = 315). Maximal decrease in body temperature was higher both with dipyrone (-0.8°C (IQR: -1.2 to -0.4°C); p = 0.016; n = 341) and acetaminophen (-0.9°C (IQR: -1.6 to -0.6°C); p<0.001; n = 71), but did not differ between dipyrone and acetaminophen (p = 0.066). As compared to untreated patients, dipyrone only led to a marginal additional decrease in body temperature of only -0.1°C. Maximum of antipyretic effectiveness was reached four hours after administration.Antipyretic effectiveness of dipyrone in ICU patients may be overestimated. Given the lack of prospective data, clinical evidence for antipyretic dipyrone therapy in the ICU is insufficient and warrants further critical evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W4221123442,"Extracellular vesicles have become a research focus for their potential as therapeutic vehicles that carry cargo substances. Extracellular vesicles may origin from the endosomal compartment and share several characteristics with the envelope of lentiviruses. A previous study reported that constitutive expression of the tetraspanin CD9, an extracellular vesicle marker, not only increases vesicle secretion from cells, but has also a positive effect on lentiviral transduction efficiency. Moreover, it was shown that expression of CD9 on the viral envelope in absence of viral glycoproteins was sufficient for the transduction of mammalian cells. In this study, we investigate the effect of CD9 and folate receptor alpha, a GPI-anchored protein, on biosynthesis and transduction efficiency of vesicles carrying lentiviral vectors. We demonstrate that neither CD9 nor FRα nor the combination of both were able to mediate a significant transduction of therapeutic vesicles carrying lentiviral RNA. Further studies are required to identify endogenous mammalian proteins that can be used for pseudotyping of viral envelopes to improve viral targeting without inducing immune responses."
