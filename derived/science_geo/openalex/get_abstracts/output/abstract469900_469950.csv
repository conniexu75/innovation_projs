https://openalex.org/W1980485314,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) comprises several molecular subtypes, including proneural GBM. Most therapeutic approaches targeting glioma cells have failed. An alternative strategy is to target cells in the glioma microenvironment, such as tumor-associated macrophages and microglia (TAMs). Macrophages depend on colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) for differentiation and survival. We used an inhibitor of the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) to target TAMs in a mouse proneural GBM model, which significantly increased survival and regressed established tumors. CSF-1R blockade additionally slowed intracranial growth of patient-derived glioma xenografts. Surprisingly, TAMs were not depleted in treated mice. Instead, glioma-secreted factors, including granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ), facilitated TAM survival in the context of CSF-1R inhibition. Expression of alternatively activated M2 markers decreased in surviving TAMs, which is consistent with impaired tumor-promoting functions. These gene signatures were associated with enhanced survival in patients with proneural GBM. Our results identify TAMs as a promising therapeutic target for proneural gliomas and establish the translational potential of CSF-1R inhibition for GBM."

Here, we investigate the relationship between respiratory function and mitochondrial ultrastructure and provide evidence that cristae shape determines the assembly and stability of RCS and hence mitochondrial respiratory efficiency. Genetic and apoptotic manipulations of cristae structure affect assembly and activity of RCS in vitro and in vivo, independently of changes to mitochondrial protein synthesis or apoptotic outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. We demonstrate that, accordingly, the efficiency of mitochondria-dependent cell growth depends on cristae shape. Thus, RCS assembly emerges as a link between membrane morphology and function.

Mitochondria are key organelles in intermediate cellular metabolism, energy conversion, and calcium homeostasis (Dimmer and Scorrano, 2006Dimmer K.S. Scorrano L. (De)constructing mitochondria: what for?.Physiology (Bethesda). 2006; 21: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). They also integrate and amplify apoptosis induced by intrinsic stimuli, releasing cytochrome c and other proapoptotic factors required for the activation of caspases (Green and Kroemer, 2004Green D.R. Kroemer G. The pathophysiology of mitochondrial cell death.Science. 2004; 305: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2811) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c release is regulated by proteins of the BCL-2 family that control the permeabilization of the outer membrane (OMM) (Danial and Korsmeyer, 2004Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell death: critical control points.Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar). Energy conversion occurs at the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) that can be further divided into two subcompartments: the so-called “boundary membrane” and the cristae, separated from the former by narrow tubular junctions (Frey and Mannella, 2000Frey T.G. Mannella C.A. The internal structure of mitochondria.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 319-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The cristae shape is dynamic: upon activation of mitochondrial respiration, “orthodox” mitochondria become “condensed,” with an expanded cristae space (Hackenbrock, 1966Hackenbrock C.R.

Cell Biol. 1966; 30: 269-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). During apoptosis, the curvature of the cristae membrane is inverted in a remodeling process required for the complete release of cytochrome c, normally confined in the cristae (Scorrano et al., 2002Scorrano L.

Cristae remodeling occurs in response to proapoptotic BH3-only BCL-2 family members, such as BID, BIM-S, and BNIP3, and independently of the outer membrane multidomain BCL-2 family members BAX and BAK (Scorrano et al., 2002Scorrano L.

Whether changes in morphology of the cristae, where respiratory chain complexes (RCCs) mainly localize (Vogel et al., 2006Vogel F. Bornhövd C. Neupert W. Reichert A.S. Dynamic subcompartmentalization of the mitochondrial inner membrane.J.

Cell Biol. 1966; 30: 269-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), is unclear. This issue is further complicated by the assembly of RCC in supercomplexes (RCS) (Schägger, 1995Schägger H.

Such a supramolecular organization is common in cristae: also, the mitochondrial ATP synthase is assembled into dimers with greater adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity (Campanella et al., 2008Campanella M. Casswell E. Chong S. Farah Z. Wieckowski M.R. Abramov A.Y. Tinker A. Duchen M.R.

Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cristae shape and ATPase dimers are linked: in yeast mutants where the ATPase cannot dimerize, cristae are disorganized (Paumard et al., 2002Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B.

Dimer ribbons of ATP synthase shape the inner mitochondrial membrane.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1154-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), whereas in mammalian cells, increased cristae density favors ATPase dimerization during autophagy (Gomes et al., 2011Gomes L.C. Di Benedetto G. Scorrano L. During autophagy mitochondria elongate, are spared from degradation and sustain cell viability.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). On the contrary, despite their importance in mitochondrial bioenergetics, the relationship between RCS and cristae shape remains unclear. Mitochondrial morphology and ultrastructure depends on “mitochondria-shaping” proteins that regulate organellar fusion and fission (Griparic and van der Bliek, 2001Griparic L. van der Bliek A.M. The many shapes of mitochondrial membranes.Traffic. 2001; 2: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Mitofusins (MFN) 1 and 2, highly homologous dynamin-related proteins of the OMM, orchestrate fusion (Santel and Fuller, 2001Santel A. Fuller M.T.

Mitofusin-1 protein is a generally expressed mediator of mitochondrial fusion in mammalian cells.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2763-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). MFN1 primarily participates in fusion, cooperating with the IMM dynamin-related protein optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) (Cipolat et al., 2004Cipolat S. Martins de Brito O. Dal Zilio B. Scorrano L. OPA1 requires mitofusin 1 to promote mitochondrial fusion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 15927-15932Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar), whereas MFN2 also tethers mitochondria to the endoplasmic reticulum (de Brito and Scorrano, 2008de Brito O.M. Scorrano L. Mitofusin 2 tethers endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria.Nature. 2008; 456: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial fission is regulated by the cytoplasmic dynamin-related protein 1 that, upon calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation, translocates to mitochondria (Yoon et al., 2001Yoon Y. Pitts K.R.

Genetic depletion of OPA1 leads to disorganization of the cristae (Frezza et al., 2006Frezza C. Cipolat S. Martins de Brito O. Micaroni M. Beznoussenko G.V. Rudka T. Bartoli D. Polishuck R.S.

OPA1 controls apoptotic cristae remodeling independently from mitochondrial fusion.Cell. 2006; 126: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar), and oligomers that contain a soluble and a membrane-bound form of OPA1 keep the cristae junctions tight, independently from OPA1 role in fusion (Frezza et al., 2006Frezza C.

During apoptosis, these oligomers are early targets of BID, BIM-S, and BNIP3, as well as of intrinsic death stimuli (Frezza et al., 2006Frezza C. Cipolat S. Martins de Brito O. Micaroni M.

Mitochondrial fission and cristae disruption increase the response of cell models of Huntington’s disease to apoptotic stimuli.EMBO Mol Med. 2010; 2: 490-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Whereas our knowledge of the molecular determinants of cristae shape and their role in apoptosis is increasing, the relationship between cristae morphology and mitochondrial function remains unexplored. We therefore set out to genetically dissect whether and how cristae shape regulates mitochondrial respiration. We show that cristae morphology determines assembly and stability of RCS and hence optimal mitochondrial respiratory function during life and death of the cell. Whether apoptotic cristae remodeling that maximizes cytochrome c release from mitochondria affects mitochondrial function is unclear, mainly because it occurs around the same time as outer membrane permeabilization (Scorrano et al., 2002Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. A distinct pathway remodels mitochondrial cristae and mobilizes cytochrome c during apoptosis.Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). In order to genetically dissociate the two processes, we inspected the primary structure of the prototypical cristae remodeling inducer BCL-2 family member BID for homology with peptides known to perturb the mitochondrial inner membrane, like mastoparan, a 14 amino acid wasp venom component (Pfeiffer et al., 1995Pfeiffer D.R. Gudz T.I. Novgorodov S.A. Erdahl W.L. The peptide mastoparan is a potent facilitator of the mitochondrial permeability transition.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4923-4932Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Interestingly, BID membrane inserting α6 helix as well as the transmembrane domains of Bnip3 and BimS that also remodel cristae (Yamaguchi et al., 2008Yamaguchi R. Lartigue L. Perkins G. Scott R.T. Dixit A. Kushnareva Y. Kuwana T. Ellisman M.H. Newmeyer D.D. Opa1-mediated cristae opening is Bax/Bak and BH3 dependent, required for apoptosis, and independent of Bak oligomerization.Mol.

The BH3-only Bnip3 binds to the dynamin Opa1 to promote mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis by distinct mechanisms.EMBO Rep. 2010; 11: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) displayed homology to mastoparan (Figures S1A and S1B available online). To exploit the role of this homologous sequence in cristae remodeling, we mutagenized the two highly conserved 157 and 158 Lys H. sapiens BID residues to Ala (BIDKKAA) (Figure S1C). Because this mutation did not impair caspase-8 cleaved recombinant BID (cBID) integration in purified mouse liver mitochondria (MLM) (Wei et al., 2000Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. tBID, a membrane-targeted death ligand, oligomerizes BAK to release cytochrome c.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Figure S1D), we could measure its biological activity using an established quantitative, specific cytochrome c release ELISA (Scorrano et al., 2002Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. A distinct pathway remodels mitochondrial cristae and mobilizes cytochrome c during apoptosis.Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). cBID efficiently released cytochrome c from purified mitochondria, whereas a BH3 domain G94E mutant was, as expected, inactive (Wei et al., 2000Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. tBID, a membrane-targeted death ligand, oligomerizes BAK to release cytochrome c.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the cBIDKKAA mutant released ∼25%–30% more cytochrome c than the baseline (Figure 1A), a figure close to the amount of free intermembrane space cytochrome c (Scorrano et al., 2002Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. A distinct pathway remodels mitochondrial cristae and mobilizes cytochrome c during apoptosis.Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). BAK oligomerization was superimposable in cBID or cBIDKKAA-treated mitochondria (Figure 1B); conversely, two established assays of intramitochondrial cytochrome c redistribution, the cytochrome b5-dependent extramitochondrial NADH oxidation and the ratio of ascorbate-driven over tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD)-driven respiration (Scorrano et al., 2002Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. A distinct pathway remodels mitochondrial cristae and mobilizes cytochrome c during apoptosis.Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar), indicated that cBIDKKAA mobilized the cristae cytochrome c pool less efficiently than cBID (Figures 1C and 1D). Indeed, cBIDKKAA was unable to remodel mitochondrial cristae, as indicated by morphometric analysis of electron micrographs of mitochondria treated with the BID mutants (Figures 1E and 1F) (Scorrano et al., 2002Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. A distinct pathway remodels mitochondrial cristae and mobilizes cytochrome c during apoptosis.Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Cristae remodeling is associated with the disruption of high molecular weight (HMW) OPA1 oligomers (Frezza et al., 2006Frezza C. Cipolat S. Martins de Brito O. Micaroni M. Beznoussenko G.V. Rudka T. Bartoli D. Polishuck R.S. Danial N.N. De Strooper B. Scorrano L. OPA1 controls apoptotic cristae remodeling independently from mitochondrial fusion.Cell. 2006; 126: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). Western blots of blue native gel electrophoresis (BNGE) of mitochondrial proteins revealed four major OPA1-containing complexes. Upon treatment with cBID, OPA1 rapidly disappeared from ∼720 kDa HMW complexes (Figures 1G, S1E, and S1F). These HMW forms of OPA1 were similarly targeted by cBIDG94E but significantly less by cBIDKKAA, as determined by BNGE (Figure 1H, quantification in [I]). Chemical crosslinking experiments (Frezza et al., 2006Frezza C. Cipolat S. Martins de Brito O. Micaroni M. Beznoussenko G.V. Rudka T. Bartoli D. Polishuck R.S. Danial N.N. De Strooper B. Scorrano L. OPA1 controls apoptotic cristae remodeling independently from mitochondrial fusion.Cell. 2006; 126: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar) further confirmed that the OPA1-containing oligomer is disrupted by the mutants of cBID able to induce cristae remodeling (Figures S1G and S1H). Finally, we measured the killing efficiency of these truncated BID (tBID) mutants expressed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Only tBID efficiently killed MEFs: tBIDKKAA and tBIDG94E elicited comparable low levels of cell death, whereas the double tBIDKKAA,G94E mutant appeared completely ineffective (Figure 1J), suggesting that both outer membrane permeabilization and mitochondrial cristae remodeling are required for BID-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, BIDKKAA is deficient in cristae remodeling, cytochrome c release, and induction of apoptosis.Figure 1Two Conserved Lys in BID α6 Helix Are Required for Cristae RemodelingShow full caption(A) Mitochondria were treated for the indicated times with the indicated mutants of cBID, and cytochrome c release was measured by ELISA.

The BIDKKAA mutant dissociates outer membrane permeabilization from cristae remodeling and can be used to investigate the relationship between the latter and mitochondrial function. We therefore measured the effect of the BID mutants on the respiratory control ratio (RCR), an index of respiratory efficiency, of mitochondria incubated with excess exogenous cytochrome c and NADH (to compensate for the potential effects of inner membrane or outer membrane [OM] permeabilization). cBID reduced RCR only when mitochondria were energized with substrates for complex I (glutamate/malate) but not when they were fed with substrates entering the electron transport chain at complex II (succinate) or complex IV (ascorbate + TMPD) (Figure 2A; data not shown). Interestingly, these changes were recapitulated by the BH3 domain mutant cBIDG94E that does not permeabilize the OM but not by the cristae remodeling-deficient mutants cBIDKKAA and cBIDKKAA,G94E (Figure 2B). Maximal (uncoupled) respiration was similarly affected by the cBID mutants tested, ruling out that BID alters RCR, because it affects ATPase or activity or ATP/ADP exchange (Figure S2A). These experiments suggest that cristae remodeling causes complex I-dependent changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics.Figure S2Cristae Remodeling Impairs Glutamate-Supported Uncoupled Respiration, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Mitochondria isolated from mouse liver were treated with the indicated mutants of cBID for 10 min and 3uncoupled respiration rate was determined.

The 2009 H1N1 pandemic (pH1N1) provided a unique natural experiment to determine whether crossreactive cellular immunity limits symptomatic illness in antibody-naive individuals. We followed 342 healthy adults through the UK pandemic waves and correlated the responses of pre-existing T cells to the pH1N1 virus and conserved core protein epitopes with clinical outcomes after incident pH1N1 infection. Higher frequencies of pre-existing T cells to conserved CD8 epitopes were found in individuals who developed less severe illness, with total symptom score having the strongest inverse correlation with the frequency of interferon-γ (IFN-γ)(+) interleukin-2 (IL-2)(-) CD8(+) T cells (r = -0.6, P = 0.004). Within this functional CD8(+)IFN-γ(+)IL-2(-) population, cells with the CD45RA(+) chemokine (C-C) receptor 7 (CCR7)(-) phenotype inversely correlated with symptom score and had lung-homing and cytotoxic potential. In the absence of crossreactive neutralizing antibodies, CD8(+) T cells specific to conserved viral epitopes correlated with crossprotection against symptomatic influenza. This protective immune correlate could guide universal influenza vaccine development."

Emerging evidence suggests that some sirtuins display substrate specificity toward other acyl groups attached to the lysine ϵ-amine. SIRT6 was recently reported to preferentially hydrolyze long-chain fatty acyl groups over acetyl groups. Here we investigated the catalytic ability of all sirtuins to hydrolyze 13 different acyl groups from histone H3 peptides, ranging in carbon length, saturation, and chemical diversity. We find that long-chain deacylation is a general feature of mammalian sirtuins, that SIRT1 and SIRT2 act as efficient decrotonylases, and that SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3, and SIRT4 can remove lipoic acid. These results provide new insight into sirtuin function and a means for cellular removal of an expanding list of endogenous lysine modifications. Given that SIRT6 is a poor deacetylase in vitro, but binds and prefers to hydrolyze long-chain acylated peptides, we hypothesize that binding of certain free fatty acids (FFAs) could stimulate deacetylation activity. Indeed, we demonstrate that several biologically relevant FFAs (including myristic, oleic, and linoleic acids) at physiological concentrations induce up to a 35-fold increase in catalytic efficiency of SIRT6 but not SIRT1.

Here, we show that the single transcription factor SOX2 is sufficient to reprogram resident astrocytes into proliferative neuroblasts in the adult mouse brain. These induced adult neuroblasts (iANBs) persist for months and can be generated even in aged brains. When supplied with BDNF and noggin or when the mice are treated with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, iANBs develop into electrophysiologically mature neurons, which functionally integrate into the local neural network. Our results demonstrate that adult astrocytes exhibit remarkable plasticity in vivo, a feature that might have important implications in regeneration of the central nervous system using endogenous patient-specific glial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2038254017,"After fertilization, maternal factors direct development and trigger zygotic genome activation (ZGA) at the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). In zebrafish, ZGA is required for gastrulation and clearance of maternal messenger RNAs, which is in part regulated by the conserved microRNA miR-430. However, the factors that activate the zygotic program in vertebrates are unknown. Here we show that Nanog, Pou5f1 (also called Oct4) and SoxB1 regulate zygotic gene activation in zebrafish. We identified several hundred genes directly activated by maternal factors, constituting the first wave of zygotic transcription. Ribosome profiling revealed that nanog, sox19b and pou5f1 are the most highly translated transcription factors pre-MZT. Combined loss of these factors resulted in developmental arrest before gastrulation and a failure to activate >75% of zygotic genes, including miR-430. Our results demonstrate that maternal Nanog, Pou5f1 and SoxB1 are required to initiate the zygotic developmental program and induce clearance of the maternal program by activating miR-430 expression. This study investigates how zygotic transcription is initiated and the maternal transcripts cleared in the zebrafish embryo: using loss-of-function analyses, high-throughput transcriptome sequencing and ribosome footprinting, the important roles of pluripotency factors Nanog, Pou5f1 and SoxB1 during these processes are identified. This paper identifies key factors responsible for the initiation of the zygotic program of development during embryogenesis. Following fertilization, maternal factors direct development and trigger zygotic genome activation at the maternal-to-zygotic transition. Antonio Giraldez and colleagues use loss-of-function analyses, high-throughput transcriptome sequencing and ribosome footprinting to identify the important roles of pluripotency factors Nanog, Pou5f1 and SoxB1 in the initiation of zygotic transcription and the clearance of maternal transcripts in the zebrafish embryo. These findings point to possible linkage between mechanisms of embryonic development, induction of pluripotency and reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W1985681303,"Rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep correlates with neuronal activity in the brainstem, basal forebrain and lateral hypothalamus. Lateral hypothalamus melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-expressing neurons are active during sleep, but their effects on REM sleep remain unclear. Using optogenetic tools in newly generated Tg(Pmch-cre) mice, we found that acute activation of MCH neurons (ChETA, SSFO) at the onset of REM sleep extended the duration of REM, but not non-REM, sleep episodes. In contrast, their acute silencing (eNpHR3.0, archaerhodopsin) reduced the frequency and amplitude of hippocampal theta rhythm without affecting REM sleep duration. In vitro activation of MCH neuron terminals induced GABAA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents in wake-promoting histaminergic neurons of the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN), and in vivo activation of MCH neuron terminals in TMN or medial septum also prolonged REM sleep episodes. Collectively, these results suggest that activation of MCH neurons maintains REM sleep, possibly through inhibition of arousal circuits in the mammalian brain."

(p. 1399 ; see the Perspective by Benilova and De Strooper ) found that murine-paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB) and its human ortholog, leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B2 (LilrB2) both bound to oligomerized Aβ. Early in mouse development, ocular dominance plasticity was affected by interactions between oligomeric Aβ and PirB. In hippocampal brain slices from a mouse model of AD, reductions in long-term potentiation induced by Aβ required PirB. Furthermore, the memory defects characteristic of a mouse model of AD were dependent on function of PirB. Many binding partners for Aβ have been identified, and so the extent to which these findings can be exploited therapeutically remains unclear."
https://openalex.org/W2033461532,"PRDM9 directs human meiotic crossover hot spots to intergenic sequence motifs, whereas budding yeast hot spots overlap regions of low nucleosome density (LND) in gene promoters. To investigate hot spots in plants, which lack PRDM9, we used coalescent analysis of genetic variation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Crossovers increased toward gene promoters and terminators, and hot spots were associated with active chromatin modifications, including H2A.Z, histone H3 Lys4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), LND and low DNA methylation. Hot spot-enriched A-rich and CTT-repeat DNA motifs occurred upstream and downstream, respectively, of transcriptional start sites. Crossovers were asymmetric around promoters and were most frequent over CTT-repeat motifs and H2A.Z nucleosomes. Pollen typing, segregation and cytogenetic analysis showed decreased numbers of crossovers in the arp6 H2A.Z deposition mutant at multiple scales. During meiosis, H2A.Z forms overlapping chromosomal foci with the DMC1 and RAD51 recombinases. As arp6 reduced the number of DMC1 or RAD51 foci, H2A.Z may promote the formation or processing of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks. We propose that gene chromatin ancestrally designates hot spots within eukaryotes and PRDM9 is a derived state within vertebrates."

The mammalian hematopoietic system is considered the paradigmatic and best-understood model for how multilineage diversity is achieved by stepwise lineage restriction of a multipotent stem cell (Orkin and Zon, 2008aOrkin S.H.

Although multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) possessing all blood-lineage potentials have been unequivocally established to reside at the top of the hematopoietic hierarchy (Osawa et al., 1996Osawa M.

However, earlier in vitro findings demonstrating that clonal lineage outputs of heterogeneous fetal hematopoietic progenitors excluded combined B and T cell generation in the absence of myeloid cells, challenged the classical hematopoietic hierarchy, and led to the proposal that the first lineage decisions of HSCs might rather result in a separation into a CMP and a lymphomyeloid progenitor pathway (Katsura and Kawamoto, 2001Katsura Y.

More recently, lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors (LMPPs) were prospectively isolated and shown at the single-cell level to possess combined granulocyte-macrophage (GM) and B and T lymphocyte potential but little or no megakaryocyte-erythroid (MkE) potential (Adolfsson et al., 2005Adolfsson J.

However, the revised hematopoietic hierarchy has been challenged by studies implying that LMPPs possess considerable MkE potential in vivo (Boyer et al., 2011Boyer S.W. Schroeder A.V. Smith-Berdan S.

Lineage-fate decisions of multipotent stem and progenitor cells take place for the first time during early embryonic development. Blood cells appear in the mouse embryo at embryonic day (E) 7 in the yolk sac (YS). This first wave of primitive hematopoiesis is myeloerythroid-restricted and transient (Medvinsky et al., 2011Medvinsky A. Rybtsov S. Taoudi S. Embryonic origin of the adult hematopoietic system: advances and questions.Development. 2011; 138: 1017-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In addition, resident tissue macrophages, such as brain microglia, liver Kupffer cells, and epidermal Langerhans cells, develop between E8.5 and E9.5 independently of definitive HSCs (Schulz et al., 2012Schulz C. Gomez Perdiguero E. Chorro L. Szabo-Rogers H. Cagnard N. Kierdorf K. Prinz M. Wu B. Jacobsen S.E. Pollard J.W. et al.A lineage of myeloid cells independent of Myb and hematopoietic stem cells.Science. 2012; 336: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). The first definitive multipotent HSCs, defined as cells capable of long-term repopulation of all myeloerythroid and lymphoid lineages in adult recipient mice are not found until after E10.5 (Medvinsky and Dzierzak, 1996Medvinsky A. Dzierzak E. Definitive hematopoiesis is autonomously initiated by the AGM region.Cell. 1996; 86: 897-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). These HSCs, first generated in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region, subsequently at E11 seed the fetal liver (FL), the main fetal hematopoietic site (Kumaravelu et al., 2002Kumaravelu P. Hook L.

Because the first lymphoid-restricted embryonic progenitors have been identified after definitive HSCs seed the FL (Douagi et al., 2002Douagi I. Vieira P. Cumano A.

However, there are several findings compatible with lymphoid lineage commitment potentially initiating earlier. Progenitors possessing all myeloerythroid and lymphoid lineage potentials have been identified before emergence of definitive HSCs and FL hematopoiesis (Kieusseian et al., 2012Kieusseian A.

However, the earliest IL7Rα-expressing progenitors have rather been suggested to be fully B or T lymphocyte-restricted and to lack myeloid lineage potential (Kawamoto et al., 2000Kawamoto H. Ikawa T.

Herein we prospectively identified an IL7Rα-expressing lymphomyeloid-restricted embryonic progenitor as early as E11.5 that sustains combined lymphoid and GM transcriptional lineage priming and potential at the single-cell level but lacks MkE potential. We tracked this lymphomyeloid progenitor back to E9.5 YS, preceding both hematopoietic colonization of the FL and the establishment of definitive HSCs. Through in vivo fate mapping, we confirmed the inability of Rag1-expressing early embryonic progenitors to significantly contribute to the MkE lineage while unequivocally and robustly contributing to the myeloid innate, as well as lymphoid adaptive, immune systems of the mammalian embryo. These findings identify the developmentally earliest immune-restricted progenitor and establish the lymphomyeloid restriction as a physiologically important lineage-commitment step in embryonic mammalian hematopoiesis, preceding the emergence of definitive HSCs. Expression of IL7Rα has been suggested to be restricted to lymphoid progenitors. We investigated IL7Rα expression in FL at E11.5 and in agreement with previous findings (Kawamoto et al., 2000Kawamoto H. Ikawa T. Ohmura K. Fujimoto S. Katsura Y. T cell progenitors emerge earlier than B cell progenitors in the murine fetal liver.Immunity. 2000; 12: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) we found IL7Rα+ cells coexpressing the pan-hematopoietic marker CD45 and the progenitor cell receptor c-Kit (Kit) but negative for mature lineage markers (Lin−) (Figure 1A). A large fraction of Lin−Kit+IL7Rα+ cells also expressed the myeloid colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (Csf1r) and the thrombopoietin receptor (ThpoR) (Figure 1A), also expressed by HSCs (Solar et al., 1998Solar G.P. Kerr W.G. Zeigler F.C. Hess D. Donahue C. de Sauvage F.J. Eaton D.L. Role of c-mpl in early hematopoiesis.Blood. 1998; 92: 4-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most IL7Rα+ cells (>70%) coexpressed c-fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor (Flt3) (0.20% of FL cells; Figure 1B), highly expressed on early lymphomyeloid progenitors in adult bone marrow (Adolfsson et al., 2005Adolfsson J. Månsson R. Buza-Vidas N. Hultquist A. Liuba K. Jensen C.T. Bryder D. Yang L. Borge O.J.

Single-cell assays demonstrated that Lin−Kit+Flt3+IL7Rα+ E11.5 FL cells possess considerable GM potential with as many as 43% of single cells forming GM clones, whereas virtually no cells (<1%) possessed Mk or E potential (Figures 1C–1F). Single Lin−Kit+Flt3+IL7Rα+ cells generated 31% and 35% of B and T cell progeny, respectively (Figures 1G and 1H). In vitro cytokine response experiments with the ligands for Flt3 and IL7Rα demonstrated that Flt3 and IL7Rα are expressed at functionally relevant levels on Lin−Kit+Flt3+IL7Rα+ progenitors (see Figure S1A available online). However, in contrast to later emerging B and T lymphoid-restricted progenitors critically dependent on Flt3 and IL7Rα signaling (Sitnicka et al., 2003Sitnicka E. Brakebusch C. Martensson I.L. Svensson M. Agace W.W. Sigvardsson M. Buza-Vidas N. Bryder D. Cilio C.M.

Med. 2003; 198: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), investigation of embryos genetically deleted for expression of both Flt3 ligand and the common gamma chain of the IL7R demonstrated that E11.5 Lin−Kit+Flt3+IL7Rα+ progenitors emerge independently of Flt3 and IL7R signaling (Figures S1B and S1C). Investigation of single Lin−Kit+Flt3+IL7Rα+ E11.5 FL cells demonstrated that more than 70% coexpressed lymphoid (Il7r, Rag1, and sIgh) and GM (Csf3r [Gcsfr] and Mpo), but not the MkE (Vwf, Epor, and Gata1) transcripts typically expressed by multipotent progenitors with MkE potential (Figures 2A and 2B )(Månsson et al., 2007Månsson R. Hultquist A. Luc S. Yang L. Anderson K. Kharazi S. Al-Hashmi S. Liuba K. Thorén L. Adolfsson J. et al.Molecular evidence for hierarchical transcriptional lineage priming in fetal and adult stem cells and multipotent progenitors.Immunity. 2007; 26: 407-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). When compared to Lin−Kit+Flt3−IL7Rα− cells, the downregulation of MkE-affiliated and upregulation of lymphoid genes expressed prior to B and T cell commitment was further verified through single-cell quantitative gene expression analysis (Figure 2C). Notably, this single-cell analysis demonstrated that every Lin−Kit+Flt3+IL7Rα+ progenitor cell expressing these lymphoid genes coexpressed myeloid lineage genes, whereas none of them expressed signature genes of the earliest B (Pax5) and T (Ptcra) cell restricted progenitors. Clones derived from single Lin−Kit+Flt3+IL7Rα+ E11.5 FL cells were analyzed for the combined potential for generation of GM, B, and T cells (Figures 2D and 2E). Of the single cell-derived clones that gave a lineage readout, as many as 45% produced mature cells of all three GM, B, and T cell lineages (GM/B/T; Figures 2F and 2G). Natural killer (NK) cells, a third lymphoid lineage and part of the innate immune system, were generated in the majority of the single cell-derived GM/B/T clones (Figure 2H). Virtually no erythroid cells were produced even upon inclusion of erythroid-promoting cytokines (Figure 2I), which stimulated erythropoiesis from the more heterogeneous Lin−Kit+Flt3−IL7Rα− progenitors (Figures S2A and S2B). Paired immunoglobulin like receptor (PIR) expression has been shown to separate T and B cell progenitors later in embryonic development. Specifically, in E13.5, FL T cell restricted progenitors were found to coexpress IL7Rα and PIR, whereas B cell progenitors were IL7Rα+PIR− (Masuda et al., 2005Masuda K. Kubagawa H. Ikawa T. Chen C.C. Kakugawa K. Hattori M. Kageyama R. Cooper M.D. Minato N. Katsura Y. Kawamoto H. Prethymic T-cell development defined by the expression of paired immunoglobulin-like receptors.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4052-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We found that only a small fraction (11%) of E11.5 FL Lin−Kit+Flt3+IL7Rα+ progenitors expressed cell surface PIR (Figure 2J). The PIR expression was confirmed by quantitative PCR and shown to coincide with upregulation of other early lymphoid transcripts, whereas both PIR+ and PIR− Lin−Kit+Flt3+IL7Rα+ cells expressed myeloid genes (Figure 2K). In agreement with representing the E11.5 FL lymphomyeloid-restricted progenitors with combined GM, B, and T cell potential, Lin−Kit+Flt3+IL7Rα+PIR− cells showed robust readout of all three lineage potentials, whereas the small fraction of Lin−Kit+Flt3+IL7Rα+PIR+ cells showed reduced T and undetectable B cell potential (Figure 2L). Thus, at the time of its first seeding by definitive HSCs, the FL contains Lin−Kit+Flt3+IL7Rα+ progenitors with combined lymphomyeloid, but no MkE transcriptional priming or potential. A large number of Lin−Kit+Flt3+IL7Rα+ immune-restricted progenitors (1,200 ± 200 cells/FL) were already present by E11.5. In contrast, we did not detect any long-term multilineage reconstitution activity in E10.5 or E11.5 FL (whether transplanted intravenously or directly into the bones), whereas considerable HSC activity was found in E12.5 FL (Figure 3A; Figures S3A–S3D). These findings are in agreement with previous studies, which suggest that there is at most only one definitive HSC in the FL at E11.5 (Kumaravelu et al., 2002Kumaravelu P. Hook L. Morrison A.M. Ure J. Zhao S. Zuyev S. Ansell J. Medvinsky A. Quantitative developmental anatomy of definitive haematopoietic stem cells/long-term repopulating units (HSC/RUs): role of the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region and the yolk sac in colonisation of the mouse embryonic liver.Development. 2002; 129: 4891-4899PubMed Google Scholar). To enhance the possibility to identify rare lymphoid-primed progenitors in the early FL, and because expression of Flt3 and Rag1-GFP highly overlap in Lin−Kit+Flt3+IL7Rα+ E11.5 progenitors (Figure 3B), we used a Rag1-GFP reporter to identify a distinct population of Lin−Kit+Rag1GFP+IL7Rα+ E10.5 FL progenitors (Figure 3C), which possessed GM, B, and T cell, but no MkE potential, as in the E11.5 FL (Figures 3D–3G; Figure S3E), establishing that immune-restricted progenitors are present in the FL already prior to and independently of definitive HSCs. We next explored how early Lin−Kit+Rag1GFP+IL7Rα+ lymphomyeloid-primed progenitors emerge in the embryo. In whole E8.5 concepti, virtually no Rag1GFP+IL7Rα+-positive cells were found, neither in the CD45− nor in the small CD45+ fraction (Figure 3H). Because the first hematopoietic cells to colonize the FL at E10 might come from the YS, we analyzed YS at E9.5 and observed a small but distinct Lin−Kit+Rag1GFP+IL7Rα+ cell population (30 ± 4 cells/YS; Figure 3I). Notably, whereas most hematopoietic cells at E9.5 have yet to upregulate expression of the pan-hematopoietic marker CD45, virtually all Lin−Kit+Rag1GFP+IL7Rα+ cells were CD45+ although most also expressed CD41, and a small fraction the endothelial marker VE-Cadherin (Figure 3J). The placenta and the para-aortic-splanchnopleura (PAS, to become the AGM) region from E9.5 embryos were also investigated, but no Rag1GFP+IL7Rα+ cells were detected above background level (Figure 3I). Almost 80% of the rare purified E9.5 YS Lin−Kit+Rag1GFP+IL7Rα+ cells expressed combined lymphoid GM but no MkE transcriptional priming at the single-cell level (Figures 3K and 3L), similar to E11.5 FL Lin−Kit+Flt3+IL7Rα+ cells (Figures 2A–2B), demonstrating that lymphomyeloid-primed progenitors emerge as early as E9.5. To further investigate the embryonic site of origin of the lymphoid-primed immune-restricted progenitors, whole-mount imaging of Rag1GFP+ embryos was performed. In agreement with the fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, Rag1GFP+ cells coexpressing CD45 and the endothelial marker CD31 were localized in the YS at E9.5 in all embryos investigated (14/14; Figure 3M; Figure S3F), whereas in the PAS region Rag1GFP+ cells were rarely observed (Figure 3N). Notably, the majority of Rag1GFP+ cells in the YS were predominantly located in close proximity to the primitive vascular plexus, rather than in large vessels (Figures 3M–3N; Figure S3F). In line with these data, we also observed transcriptional expression of Rag2 and Il7r in E9.5 YS but little or no expression in E8.5 embryos or E9.5 PAS (Figure 3O). These data are most compatible with Lin−Kit+Rag1GFP+IL7Rα+ cells originating in E9.5 YS. However, because the connection between the YS and intraembryonic blood vessels occurs already at E8.5, we next dissected the YS and PAS regions from Rag1GFP+ embryos before circulation was established (≤6 somite pairs [sp]), short-term cultured the whole explants, and performed whole-mount immunolabeling (Cumano et al., 1996Cumano A. Dieterlen-Lievre F. Godin I. Lymphoid potential, probed before circulation in mouse, is restricted to caudal intraembryonic splanchnopleura.Cell. 1996; 86: 907-916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Strikingly, in six out of ten YS explants, Rag1GFP+ cells coexpressing CD45 and CD31 emerged after 48 hr, as did expression of Il7r and sIgh (Figures 3P and 3Q), whereas at the same time no Rag1GFP+ cells were generated by the precirculation PAS explants (seven embryos) (Figure S3G), supporting that Rag1GFP+IL7Rα+ lymphomyeloid-restricted progenitors arise de novo in the YS at E9.5. It is important to establish to what degree early lymphoid progenitors with sustained myeloid lineage potential in vitro contribute toward generation of myeloid cells under in vivo physiologically relevant conditions. Recent studies exploring this in adult hematopoiesis have questioned the physiological relevance of the residual myeloid potential of early lymphomyeloid progenitors (Boyer et al., 2011Boyer S.W.

Thus, although our in vitro experiments demonstrated that embryonic immune-restricted progenitors sustain lymphoid and GM but little or no MkE lineage potentials, they could not establish the contribution of these Rag1-expressing progenitors to different hematopoietic cell lineages during embryonic development. Thus, we applied a Rag1-Cre fate mapping in which only cells expressing Rag1 or their progeny will express a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). As expected, virtually all B and T cells emerging later in the fetus were positive for YFP in E14.5 FL (Figures 4A–4B) as in adult BM (Figure S4A). Moreover, Rag1 expressin"

It acts by potentiating GABAA (γ-aminobutyric acid type A) receptors, but where it binds to this receptor is not known and has been a matter of some debate. We synthesized a new propofol analog photolabeling reagent whose biological activity is very similar to that of propofol. We confirmed that this reagent labeled known propofol binding sites in human serum albumin that have been identified using X-ray crystallography. Using a combination of protiated and deuterated versions of the reagent to label mammalian receptors in intact membranes, we identified a new binding site for propofol in GABAA receptors consisting of both β3 homopentamers and α1β3 heteropentamers. The binding site is located within the β subunit at the interface between the transmembrane domains and the extracellular domain and lies close to known determinants of anesthetic sensitivity in the transmembrane segments TM1 and TM2."
https://openalex.org/W2064853491,"Endothelial secretion of von Willebrand factor (VWF) from intracellular organelles known as Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) is required for platelet adhesion to the injured vessel wall. Here we demonstrate that WPBs are often found near or within autophagosomes and that endothelial autophagosomes contain abundant VWF protein. Pharmacological inhibitors of autophagy or knockdown of the essential autophagy genes Atg5 or Atg7 inhibits the in vitro secretion of VWF. Furthermore, although mice with endothelial-specific deletion of Atg7 have normal vessel architecture and capillary density, they exhibit impaired epinephrine-stimulated VWF release, reduced levels of high-molecular weight VWF multimers and a corresponding prolongation of bleeding times. Endothelial-specific deletion of Atg5 or pharmacological inhibition of autophagic flux results in a similar in vivo alteration of hemostasis. Thus, autophagy regulates endothelial VWF secretion, and transient pharmacological inhibition of autophagic flux may be a useful strategy to prevent thrombotic events."

https://openalex.org/W1981390911,"Background Transition metal–catalyzed alkene metathesis has revolutionized organic synthesis during the last two decades, even though the commonly used catalysts do not provide kinetic control over the stereochemistry of the newly formed double bonds. It is of utmost importance to fix this shortcoming, because the olefin geometry not only determines the physical and chemical properties of the alkene products but is also innately linked to any biological activities that the olefins may have. Advances Recent progress in catalyst design led to the development of a first set of metal alkylidene complexes of ruthenium, molybdenum, and tungsten that allow a host of inter- and intramolecular alkene metathesis reactions to be performed with good to excellent levels of Z selectivity (see the figure). This marks a considerable advancement over prior art, even though inherently E -selective catalysts remain elusive. In the case of disubstituted olefins, this gap in coverage can be filled by a sequence of alkyne metathesis followed by stereoselective semi-reduction of the resulting acetylene derivatives, which provides highly selective access to either geometrical series. Because the required alkylidyne catalysts have also been greatly improved in terms of activity, functional group tolerance, and user-friendliness, this method constitutes a valuable preparative complement. Outlook It is expected that the new catalysts will be rapidly embraced by the synthetic community. Because the as-yet limited number of published case studies is very encouraging, it is reasonable to believe that more sophisticated applications to polyfunctionalized and/or industrially relevant targets will follow shortly. Such investigations will allow the selectivity and performance of the stereoselective metathesis catalysts to be scrutinized in great detail. In parallel, growing mechanistic insights into their mode of action will almost certainly be forthcoming that can then be translated into refined ligand design. The resulting feedback loops will likely result in the evolution of ever more selective and practical catalysts, the long-term impact of which on organic synthesis and materials science will surely be profound and lasting."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly, with more than five million patients in the U.S. alone. The greatest known risk factor for AD is advanced age, with incidence doubling every decade after 60 years of age. The second greatest risk factor for AD is family history. Heritability for AD is estimated to be as high as 80% (Gatz et al., 2006Gatz M. Reynolds C.A. Fratiglioni L. Johansson B. Mortimer J.A. Berg S. Fiske A. Pedersen N.L. Role of genes and environments for explaining Alzheimer disease.Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 2006; 63: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Early-onset familial AD (EO-FAD) can be caused by fully penetrant mutations in three genes, APP and the two presenilins (PSEN1 and PSEN2). The most well-established late-onset AD (LOAD) gene is apolipoprotein E (APOE), in which the ε4 variant increases risk by 3.7-fold (one copy) to >10-fold (two copies) (Bertram et al., 2010Bertram L. Lill C.M. Tanzi R.E. The genetics of Alzheimer disease: back to the future.Neuron. 2010; 68: 270-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). AD is characterized by the cerebral neuronal loss and deposition of amyloid-β protein (Aβ) in senile plaques. Vast amounts of clinical and biochemical data, in addition to the four established AD genes, support the hypothesis that abnormal processing of APP and the accumulation of its metabolite, Aβ, play key roles in the etiology and pathogenesis of AD (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease: progress and problems on the road to therapeutics.Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (11002) Google Scholar). APP is a type one transmembrane protein that can be processed into a variety of proteolytic fragments. Aβ, a 4-kDa-sized fragment, is generated via serial cleavage of APP by β-secretase (BACE1) at ectodomain and γ-secretase at intramembranous sites. In contrast, cleavage of APP at the juxtamembrane by α-secretase precludes Aβ generation. α- versus β-secretase cleavage of APP may also lead to different functional consequences. The secreted APP ectodomain generated by α-secretase, sAPPα, has neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties in vivo and in vitro (Mattson et al., 1993Mattson M.P. Cheng B. Culwell A.R. Esch F.S.

In contrast, the β-secretase-derived product sAPPβ is not as neuroprotective, and upon further processing, can render proapoptotic and neurodegenerative effects on neuronal cells (Nikolaev et al., 2009Nikolaev A.

Several members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family proteases, including ADAM9, ADAM10, and ADAM17, have been reported to possess α-secretase activity at least under in vitro conditions. However, recent evidence indicates that ADAM10 is the major α-secretase responsible for the ectodomain shedding of APP in the mouse brain (Jorissen et al., 2010Jorissen E. Prox J. Bernreuther C.

Nascent ADAM10 is produced as a zymogen and matures into an active protease only after the liberation of its prodomain by furin or proconvertase 7 in the trans-Golgi secretory pathway (Lammich et al., 1999Lammich S.

USA. 1999; 96: 3922-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). After maturation, the majority of the ADAM10 is transported to the plasma membrane, where it acts as a sheddase for cell surface proteins, such as APP. Recent studies have shown that ADAM10 itself is also subject to shedding in cultured cells (Parkin and Harris, 2009Parkin E. Harris B.

Numerous studies of metalloprotease family proteins suggest that the prodomain of ADAM10 plays critical roles in the maturation of the enzyme.

Chem. 2007; 282: 35712-35721Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), thereby preventing autocatalysis during biosynthesis. Another function of the prodomain is to serve as an intramolecular chaperone, facilitating the proper folding of other domains of the protein (Cao et al., 2000Cao J. Hymowitz M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. The propeptide domain of membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase acts as an intramolecular chaperone when expressed in trans with the mature sequence in COS-1 cells.J. Biol.

Protein memory through altered folding mediated by intramolecular chaperones.Nature. 1997; 389: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). While recombinant ADAM10 lacking the prodomain upon initial synthesis is catalytically inactive, coexpression of the prodomain in trans has been shown to restore the α-secretase activity of the enzyme (Anders et al., 2001Anders A. Gilbert S. Garten W. Postina R. Fahrenholz F. Regulation of the alpha-secretase ADAM10 by its prodomain and proprotein convertases.FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1837-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In addition to function as a major α-secretase for APP, ADAM10 plays an essential role in embryonic neurogenesis and brain development (Jorissen et al., 2010Jorissen E. Prox J. Bernreuther C.

Both ADAM10 knockout (KO) and conditional KO mice are lethal in early developmental stages (Hartmann et al., 2002Hartmann D. de Strooper B. Serneels L. Craessaerts K. Herreman A. Annaert W. Umans L.

Neurosci. 2010; 30: 4833-4844Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), potentially due to the lack of ectodomain shedding of Notch and its ligands by ADAM10. Recent studies have shown that neurogenesis in adult hippocampus plays an essential role in learning and memory (Zhao et al., 2008Zhao C. Deng W. Gage F.H. Mechanisms and functional implications of adult neurogenesis.Cell. 2008; 132: 645-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2433) Google Scholar). Whether ADAM10 plays a role in adult hippocampal neurogenesis has yet to be addressed. To assess the candidacy of ADAM10 as a LOAD susceptibility gene, we previously genotyped 30 SNPs that span the gene to test for genetic association with AD. These analyses, followed by targeted resequencing of ADAM10, ultimately led to the identification of two nonsynonymous mutations, Q170H and R181G, in seven LOAD families (Kim et al., 2009Kim M. Suh J. Romano D. Truong M.H. Mullin K. Hooli B. Norton D. Tesco G. Elliott K. Wagner S.L. et al.Potential late-onset Alzheimer’s disease-associated mutations in the ADAM10 gene attenuate alpha-secretase activity.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 3987-3996Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Overexpression of both mutant forms of ADAM10 in cell cultures significantly increased Aβ levels as compared to wild-type (WT) ADAM10 controls (Kim et al., 2009Kim M. Suh J. Romano D. Truong M.H. Mullin K. Hooli B. Norton D. Tesco G. Elliott K. Wagner S.L. et al.Potential late-onset Alzheimer’s disease-associated mutations in the ADAM10 gene attenuate alpha-secretase activity.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 3987-3996Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Here, we set out to demonstrate the pathogenicity of the two ADAM10 mutations in transgenic mouse models. For this purpose, we generated transgenic mice that express either WT or LOAD mutant forms of human ADAM10 and compared the differences in APP processing among the multiple lines of WT and mutant transgenic mice expressing similar levels of ADAM10 in brain. The impact of the mutations on Aβ accumulation and plaque deposition was further assessed by crossing these ADAM10 transgenic mice with Tg2576 mice, a well-characterized AD mouse model that overexpresses human APP Swedish mutation (APPswe) and is known to cause an APP ectodomain cleavage shift that favors the β- over the α-site. We also assessed the effect of the LOAD mutations on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and, finally, we explored the underlying molecular mechanisms by which the LOAD mutations in the ADAM10 prodomain attenuate α-secretase activity. To test the in vivo effects of the two LOAD-associated ADAM10 mutations on α-secretase activity, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing human WT ADAM10, ADAM10 harboring the LOAD-associated mutations Q170H or R181G, and an artificial dominant-negative (DN) mutation, E384A. All transgenes were driven by the mouse prion protein promoter (MoPrP) and tagged with hemagglutinin (HA) at the C terminus of the protein (Figures S1A and S1B available online). For each ADAM10 genotype, we obtained three WT, three Q170H, eight R181G, and three DN F1 transgenic mice, which were bred with nontransgenic littermates to maintain mouse lines. The brains from F2 and F3 progenies of each line were analyzed for ADAM10 expression and APP processing. Western blot analysis of 12-week-old mouse brains revealed that a WT transgenic line (WT-58) expressed ∼2.5-fold higher level of mature ADAM10 in brain than nontransgenic control (Figure S1C). In addition to the pro and mature forms of ADAM10, high levels of ADAM10-CTF (∼10 kDa) were detected in the membrane fraction (Figures 1A–1C and S1D). Previous studies have shown that these ADAM10-CTFs are generated by ectodomain shedding of ADAM10 mature forms (Parkin and Harris, 2009Parkin E. Harris B. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)-mediated ectodomain shedding of ADAM10.J. Neurochem. 2009; 108: 1464-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, Tousseyn et al., 2009Tousseyn T. Thathiah A. Jorissen E. Raemaekers T. Konietzko U. Reiss K. Maes E. Snellinx A. Serneels L. Nyabi O. et al.ADAM10, the rate-limiting protease of regulated intramembrane proteolysis of Notch and other proteins, is processed by ADAMS-9, ADAMS-15, and the gamma-secretase.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11738-11747Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Interestingly, as compared to the ADAM10-WT transgenic mice, the levels of ADAM10-CTF were significantly reduced in mice expressing either of the two LOAD mutations and were undetectable in mice expressing DN mutation (Figures 1A and 1C). This pattern of reduced ADAM10-CTF was consistently observed in all the ADAM10 LOAD and DN mutant lines as compared to WT transgenic lines (two WT, three Q170H, six R181G, and three DN ADAM10 transgenic lines) and in the three single F1 mice (one WT and two R181G, which failed to produce progeny). The decrease in ADAM10-CTF generation was also detected in primary cortical neurons derived from the LOAD mutant mice (Figure S1E). These results indicate that both the LOAD and DN ADAM10 mutations decreased ectodomain shedding of the metalloprotease. Consistent with our findings, previous studies have shown that artificial mutations at the prodomain cleavage or catalytic sites, which block enzyme activity of the corresponding ADAM proteases (ADAM13 and ADAM19), also result in the prevention of its own ectodomain shedding at their cysteine-rich domains (Gaultier et al., 2002Gaultier A. Cousin H. Darribère T. Alfandari D. ADAM13 disintegrin and cysteine-rich domains bind to the second heparin-binding domain of fibronectin.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23336-23344Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, Kang et al., 2002Kang T. Park H.I. Suh Y. Zhao Y.G. Tschesche H. Sang Q.X.

Chem. 2002; 277: 48514-48522Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have previously suggested that ectodomain shedding of ADAM10 depends on the activity of ADAM family proteins, including ADAM9 and ADAM17 (Parkin and Harris, 2009Parkin E. Harris B. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)-mediated ectodomain shedding of ADAM10.J. Neurochem. 2009; 108: 1464-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, Tousseyn et al., 2009Tousseyn T. Thathiah A. Jorissen E. Raemaekers T. Konietzko U. Reiss K. Maes E. Snellinx A. Serneels L. Nyabi O. et al.ADAM10, the rate-limiting protease of regulated intramembrane proteolysis of Notch and other proteins, is processed by ADAMS-9, ADAMS-15, and the gamma-secretase.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11738-11747Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Conversely, ADAM10 activity was found to be essential for the ADAM9 function (Taylor et al., 2009Taylor D.R. Parkin E.T. Cocklin S.L. Ault J.R. Ashcroft A.E. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Role of ADAMs in the ectodomain shedding and conformational conversion of the prion protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 22590-22600Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To further investigate the ectodomain shedding of ADAM10, we assessed the expression and processing of endogenous ADAM9 in each genotype of ADAM10 transgenic mice. Levels of pro and mature ADAM9 and ADAM9-CTF were unaffected by the expression of WT or mutant forms of ADAM10 (Figure S1F). In addition, overexpression of ADAM10-DN did not interfere with the generation of ADAM10-CTF from either transgenic or endogenous ADAM10 proteins (Figure S1G). Taken together, these results suggest that the decrease in ADAM10-CTF levels observed in mice expressing LOAD mutations is due to the reduced autoproteolytic activity of the mutant ADAM10. A reduced ratio of pro versus mature ADAM10 in the Q170H mutant lines suggested that the mutation might also affect the liberation of its prodomain (Figure S1H). However, the marked variability of the ratio of pro versus mature ADAM10 in mice expressing the other ADAM10 mutations, R181G and DN, indicates that ADAM10 prodomain cleavage does not depend on the enzyme activity of the metalloprotease. To examine the effect of the LOAD ADAM10 mutations on endogenous APP processing, we selected two mouse lines from each of the four genotypes, expressing comparable levels of mature ADAM10 (Figures 1A and 1B), and analyzed the levels of APP and its cleavage products in the brain. Compared to nontransgenic control, ADAM10 WT transgenic mice exhibited lower levels of mature APP and sAPPβ and higher levels of APP-CTFα and sAPPα (Figures 1A and 1D–1G). Mature APP is cleaved primarily by α-secretase at the cell surface into APP-CTFα and sAPPα, and accumulating evidence supports that APP is cleaved competitively by α- and β-secretase in neural cells (Colombo et al., 2012Colombo A. Wang H. Kuhn P.H. Page R. Kremmer E. Dempsey P.J. Crawford H.C. Lichtenthaler S.F.

Invest. 2004; 113: 1456-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Thus, overexpression of ADAM10-WT increased α-secretase cleavage while decreasing β-secretase cleavage of endogenous APP. In contrast, expression of ADAM10-DN had an opposite effect on APP processing. Compared to the WT transgenic controls, both Q170H and R181G mutant transgenic mice exhibited significant attenuation of APP processing, i.e., less of an increase in APP-CTFα levels and less of a decrease in mature APP and sAPPβ levels. Interestingly, however, the level of sAPPα in the two LOAD mutant mice was not reduced when compared to that of ADAM10-WT mice (Figures 1A and 1F). This is likely due to the enhanced degradation of sAPPα in the brains expressing ADAM10-WT over the other mutant forms. In support of this hypothesis, we observed higher levels of ∼70 kDa sAPP degradation products in the brains of ADAM10-WT as compared to the two LOAD mutant mice (Figure 1A). Moreover, compared to the nontransgenic control, the amount of total sAPP was barely different in ADAM10 transgenic mice expressing either WT or any mutant forms. These data suggest a presence of a potential compensatory mechanism that maintains the total level of sAPP in the brain regardless of ADAM10 expression levels. We also measured the levels of secreted APP (sAPPα, sAPPβ, and total sAPP) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and found similar patterns depending on the ADAM10 genotypes (Figure S2A). Levels of endogenous Aβ40 and Aβ42 (measured by ELISA) were significantly lower in ADAM10-WT mice compared to the nontransgenic controls, while the levels were dramatically higher in ADAM10-DN mice (Figure S2B). For mice expressing either Q170H or R181G mutations, a trend was observed in which endogenous Aβ levels were increased compared to ADAM10-WT mice. Taken together, these data reveal that both ADAM10 LOAD prodomain mutations attenuate but do not entirely abolish α-secretase activity of ADAM10 on APP. Next, we asked whether the prodomain mutations affect the cleavage of other ADAM10 substrates besides APP (Pruessmeyer and Ludwig, 2009Pruessmeyer J. Ludwig A. The good, the bad and the ugly substrates for ADAM10 and ADAM17 in brain pathology, inflammation and cancer.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; 20: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We examined the processing of candidate ADAM10 substrates in the brain including APLP2, Notch1, and N-cadherin. The processing of APLP2 showed very similar patterns to those of APP in that ADAM10-WT overexpression resulted in the increased cleavage of mature APLP2, while this was attenuated in mice expressing either of the two LOAD mutations (Figure S2C). Interestingly, ∼57-kDa-sized C terminus-truncated soluble APLP2, analogous to the soluble APP cleavage product, was detected more abundantly in ADAM10-WT than the LOAD mutant mouse brains. In contrast, western blot analysis of adult brains and primary neurons derived from ADAM10 transgenic mice showed ADAM10 overexpression barely affected N-cadherin level or N-cadherin-CTF generation (Figure S2D). In contrast to embryonic brains, most of Notch1 protein in adult brains is cleaved and present as extracellular truncated forms in the membrane. We found that neither WT nor mutant ADAM10 overexpression changed the level of full-length or truncated forms of Notch1 (Figure S2E). Together, these data suggest that the processing of APP family proteins is particularly vulnerable to loss-of-function mutations in ADAM10. To evaluate the effects of the two LOAD ADAM10 mutations on AD pathogenesis, we crossed transgenic mice expressing WT or mutant forms of ADAM10 with Tg2576 AD mice and assessed APP processing, Aβ levels, and amyloid plaque load. As in the ADAM10 transgenic mice, the prion protein promoter was utilized in the Tg2576 mice to express human APPswe. Western blot analysis of mouse brain lysates revealed that APP expression was several-fold higher in Tg2576 mice than in nontransgenic control. However, ADAM10 expression in Tg2576/ADAM10 double-transgenic mice was maintained at similar levels to those in parental ADAM10 single-transgenic mice (Figures 2A and S3A). Attenuation of α-secretase activity by the LOAD mutations was clearly evident in the mutant Tg2576/ADAM10 double-transgenic mice. Compared to the double-transgenic mice expressing ADAM10-WT (Tg2576/WT), the decrease of mature APP and increase of APP-CTFα were significantly reduced in 3-month-old brains expressing either Q170H (Tg2576/Q170H) or R181G (Tg2576/R181G) ADAM10 mutations (Figures 2A and 2B). Moreover, the levels of sAPPβ and APP-CTFβ were elevated by both LOAD mutations in comparison to Tg2576/WT mice. Quantitative analysis of brain sAPPα and sAPPβ by ELISA revealed similar patterns as compared to the results from western blots (Figure 2C). The ratios of both APP-CTFα:APP-CTFβ and sAPPα:sAPPβ indicate that both the LOAD mutations shifted more than 50% of the APP processing from the α-secretase to β-secretase pathway. While the ratio of α- versus β-cleavage was still higher in Tg2576/Q170H and Tg2576/R181G mice than Tg2576, the DN mutation modestly shifted APP processing toward β-cleavage. However, the increase in β-secretase cleavage of APP by mutant ADAM10 expression was not caused by altered BACE1 expression (Figure 2A). Notably, as observed in the ADAM10 single-transgenic mice, no differences were found in sAPPα levels among Tg2576/WT, Tg2576/Q170H, and Tg2576/R181G double-transgenic mice (Figures 2A and 2B). Instead, C-terminal truncated sAPP were detected more abundantly in mice expressing the WT form (Figures 2A, S3B, and S3C). Given the robust increase of APP-CTFα and concurrent decrease of APP-CTFβ by ADAM10-WT expression, the C terminus truncated sAPP are probably generated from sAPPα. Next, we examined Aβ levels in the Tg2576/ADAM10 double-transgenic mice. In the brains of 3-month-old Tg2576/WT mice, both TBS-soluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels were reduced ∼35% compared to Tg2576 control (Figure 3A). However, the ADAM10-mediated decrease in Aβ40 and Aβ42 was significantly attenuated in both Tg2576/Q170H and Tg2576/R181G mice. Tg2576/DN mice exhibited higher Aβ levels than Tg2576 alone, which indicates decreased nonamyloidogenic processing of APP in the presence of the DN form. In 3-month-old brains, TBS-insoluble Aβ was barely detectable in Tg2576 or Tg2576/ADAM10 mice (data not shown). As the deposition of insoluble Aβ occurs at 7–8 months in the brains of Tg2576 mice (Kawarabayashi et al., 2001Kawarabayashi T. Younkin L.H. Saido T.C. Shoji M. Ashe K.H. Younkin S.G. Age-dependent changes in brain, CSF, and plasma amyloid (beta) protein in the Tg2576 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 372-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the total Aβ levels at 12 months were hundreds-fold higher than those at 3 months (Figure 3B). Correspondingly, in 12-month-old mice, the reduction of Aβ levels in Tg2576/WT was dramatically amplified in both TBS-soluble (>90%) and insoluble (>99%) Aβ fractions (Figure 3B). Compared to the Tg2576/WT, there was much less of a decrease in Aβ levels in Tg2576/Q170H mice. However, Tg2576/Q170H mice also showed a robust decrease in brain Aβ levels as compared to Tg2576. This decrease was most likely due to partial, but not complete, loss of α-secretase activity by the LOAD mutation. Combined with endogenous ADAM10, transgenic mice overexpressing the LOAD mutation still had overall higher α-secretase activity than ADAM10 nontransgenic control (Figures 1 and 2). The decrease in Aβ levels by ADAM10-WT or -Q170H overexpression was also confirmed by western blot analysis of 12-month-old AD mouse brain (Figure 3C). The Tg2576/R181G mice were examined only in small numbers (n < 3) at 12 months of age, due to the similarities noted in the patterns of APP processing and Aβ generation with Tg2576/Q170H mice at 3 months of age (Figure 2A and 2B). These mice also exhibited an increase in Aβ levels as compared to the Tg2576/WT (data not shown). Other APP cleavage fragments remained at similar levels between 3 and 12 months old (Figures 2A and S3D). Thus, the enhanced impact of ADAM10 on cerebral Aβ amount at 12 months, compared to 3 months, might be the result of accumulated effect of APP processing change (amyloidogenic versus nonamyloidogenic) and Aβ deposition over the several months time period. We did not detect changes in the ratio of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in brains expressing either WT or mutant forms of ADAM10 (Figure 3A, 3B, and S2B). This suggests that the change in ADAM10 activity did not affec"

Here the authors show that in subjects who have learned to associate an odor with an electric shock, re-exposure to the odor during slow-wave sleep promotes extinction of the memory for the odor-shock association. Sleep can strengthen memory for emotional information, but whether emotional memories can be specifically targeted and modified during sleep is unknown. In human subjects who underwent olfactory contextual fear conditioning, re-exposure to the odorant context in slow-wave sleep promoted stimulus-specific fear extinction, with parallel reductions of hippocampal activity and reorganization of amygdala ensemble patterns. Thus, fear extinction may be selectively enhanced during sleep, even without re-exposure to the feared stimulus itself."

Overprediction and database annotation errors in genome-sequencing projects have caused much confusion because of the difficulty of assigning valid functions to the proteins identified. These authors use structure-guided approaches for predicting the substrate specificities of several enzymes encoded by a bacterial gene cluster to correctly predict the in vitro activity of an enzyme of unknown function and identify the catabolic pathway in which it participates in cells. The substrate-liganded pose predicted by virtual library screening was confirmed experimentally, enzyme activities in the predicted pathway were confirmed by in vitro assays and genetic analyses, the intermediates were identified by metabolomics, and repression of the genes encoding the pathway by high salt concentrations was established by transcriptomics. This study establishes the utility of structure-guided functional predictions for the discovery of new metabolic pathways. Assigning valid functions to proteins identified in genome projects is challenging: overprediction and database annotation errors are the principal concerns1. We and others2 are developing computation-guided strategies for functional discovery with ‘metabolite docking’ to experimentally derived3 or homology-based4 three-dimensional structures. Bacterial metabolic pathways often are encoded by ‘genome neighbourhoods’ (gene clusters and/or operons), which can provide important clues for functional assignment. We recently demonstrated the synergy of docking and pathway context by ‘predicting’ the intermediates in the glycolytic pathway in Escherichia coli5. Metabolite docking to multiple binding proteins and enzymes in the same pathway increases the reliability of in silico predictions of substrate specificities because the pathway intermediates are structurally similar. Here we report that structure-guided approaches for predicting the substrate specificities of several enzymes encoded by a bacterial gene cluster allowed the correct prediction of the in vitro activity of a structurally characterized enzyme of unknown function (PDB 2PMQ), 2-epimerization of trans-4-hydroxy-l-proline betaine (tHyp-B) and cis-4-hydroxy-d-proline betaine (cHyp-B), and also the correct identification of the catabolic pathway in which Hyp-B 2-epimerase participates. The substrate-liganded pose predicted by virtual library screening (docking) was confirmed experimentally. The enzymatic activities in the predicted pathway were confirmed by in vitro assays and genetic analyses; the intermediates were identified by metabolomics; and repression of the genes encoding the pathway by high salt concentrations was established by transcriptomics, confirming the osmolyte role of tHyp-B.

We have noted that as basic experimental biomedical researchers, we face unique challenges to the incorporation of sex and gender in our work, and that these have remained largely unarticulated, misunderstood, and unaddressed in the literature. Here, we describe some of the specific challenges to the incorporation of sex and gender considerations in research involving cell cultures and laboratory animals. In our view, the mainstreaming of sex and gender considerations in basic biomedical research depends on an approach that will allow scientists to address these issues in ways that do not undermine our ability to pursue our fundamental scientific interests. To that end, we suggest a number of strategies that allow basic experimental researchers to feasibly and meaningfully take sex and gender into account in their work."
https://openalex.org/W2065183541,"Nucleic-acid-binding proteins are generally viewed as either specific or nonspecific, depending on characteristics of their binding sites in DNA or RNA. Most studies have focused on specific proteins, which identify cognate sites by binding with highest affinities to regions with defined signatures in sequence, structure or both. Proteins that bind to sites devoid of defined sequence or structure signatures are considered nonspecific. Substrate binding by these proteins is poorly understood, and it is not known to what extent seemingly nonspecific proteins discriminate between different binding sites, aside from those sequestered by nucleic acid structures. Here we systematically examine substrate binding by the apparently nonspecific RNA-binding protein C5, and find clear discrimination between different binding site variants. C5 is the protein subunit of the transfer RNA processing ribonucleoprotein enzyme RNase P from Escherichia coli. The protein binds 5' leaders of precursor tRNAs at a site without sequence or structure signatures. We measure functional binding of C5 to all possible sequence variants in its substrate binding site, using a high-throughput sequencing kinetics approach (HITS-KIN) that simultaneously follows processing of thousands of RNA species. C5 binds different substrate variants with affinities varying by orders of magnitude. The distribution of functional affinities of C5 for all substrate variants resembles affinity distributions of highly specific nucleic acid binding proteins. Unlike these specific proteins, C5 does not bind its physiological RNA targets with the highest affinity, but with affinities near the median of the distribution, a region that is not associated with a sequence signature. We delineate defined rules governing substrate recognition by C5, which reveal specificity that is hidden in cellular substrates for RNase P. Our findings suggest that apparently nonspecific and specific RNA-binding modes may not differ fundamentally, but represent distinct parts of common affinity distributions."
https://openalex.org/W2020429579,"High-throughput operant conditioning systems for rodents provide efficient training on sophisticated behavioral tasks. Combining these systems with technologies for cellular resolution functional imaging would provide a powerful approach to study neural dynamics during behavior. Here we describe an integrated two-photon microscope and behavioral apparatus that allows cellular resolution functional imaging of cortical regions during epochs of voluntary head restraint. Rats were trained to initiate periods of restraint up to 8 s in duration, which provided the mechanical stability necessary for in vivo imaging while allowing free movement between behavioral trials. A mechanical registration system repositioned the head to within a few microns, allowing the same neuronal populations to be imaged on each trial. In proof-of-principle experiments, calcium-dependent fluorescence transients were recorded from GCaMP-labeled cortical neurons. In contrast to previous methods for head restraint, this system can be incorporated into high-throughput operant conditioning systems."
https://openalex.org/W1971444034,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi membrane transport and autophagy are intersecting trafficking pathways that are tightly regulated and crucial for homeostasis, development and disease. Here, we identify UVRAG, a beclin-1-binding autophagic factor, as a phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P)-binding protein that depends on PtdIns(3)P for its ER localization. We further show that UVRAG interacts with RINT-1, and acts as an integral component of the RINT-1-containing ER tethering complex, which couples phosphoinositide metabolism to COPI-vesicle tethering. Displacement or knockdown of UVRAG profoundly disrupted COPI cargo transfer to the ER and Golgi integrity. Intriguingly, autophagy caused the dissociation of UVRAG from the ER tether, which in turn worked in concert with the Bif-1-beclin-1-PI(3)KC3 complex to mobilize Atg9 translocation for autophagosome formation. These findings identify a regulatory mechanism that coordinates Golgi-ER retrograde and autophagy-related vesicular trafficking events through physical and functional interactions between UVRAG, phosphoinositide and their regulatory factors, thereby ensuring spatiotemporal fidelity of membrane trafficking and maintenance of organelle homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1993538497,"The androgen receptor (AR), a member of the nuclear receptor family, is a transcription factor involved in prostate cell growth, homeostasis, and transformation. AR is a key protein in growth and development of both normal and malignant prostate, making it a common therapeutic target in prostate cancer. AR is regulated by an interplay of multiple post-translational modifications including ubiquitination. We and others have shown that the AR is ubiquitinated by a number of E3 ubiquitin ligases, including MDM2, CHIP, and NEDD4, which can result in its proteosomal degradation or enhanced transcriptional activity. As ubiquitination of AR causes a change in AR activity or stability and impacts both survival and growth of prostate cancer cells, deubiquitination of these sites has an equally important role. Hence, deubiquitinating enzymes could offer novel therapeutic targets. We performed an siRNA screen to identify deubiquitinating enzymes that regulate AR; in that screen ubiquitin-specific protease 12 (Usp12) was identified as a novel positive regulator of AR. Usp12 is a poorly characterized protein with few known functions and requires the interaction with two cofactors, Uaf-1 and WDR20, for its enzymatic activity. In this report we demonstrate that Usp12, in complex with Uaf-1 and WDR20, deubiquitinates the AR to enhance receptor stability and transcriptional activity. Our data show that Usp12 acts in a pro-proliferative manner by stabilizing AR and enhancing its cellular function."

The functional consequences of insulator-mediated chromosomal interactions depend on the location of their binding sites relative to different regulatory elements, epigenetic features, and the presence of other nuclear factors. For example, looping between two insulator sites that separate an enhancer from the promoter of a gene will abolish enhancer-promoter communication and block transcription (Guo et al., 2011Guo C.

In addition to, or as a consequence of, their role in regulating specific transcription processes, insulators may also have a more general role in the three-dimensional organization of the genome. Results from high-resolution mapping of intrachromosomal interactions using chromosome conformation capture (3C)-related techniques suggest that the genome may be spatially organized into large topologically associating domains (TADs) (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R.

Each TAD is demarcated by relatively sharp domain borders and is defined by high frequency of intradomain interactions with limited contacts to other domains across the genome. Insulator proteins are enriched at TAD borders, suggesting that they may play a role in their establishment and thus the physical organization of chromosomes during interphase. In Drosophila, TAD borders contain clusters of different insulator proteins named “aligned insulators,” whereas discrete insulator sites are enriched inside TADs (Hou et al., 2012Hou C. Li L.

In vertebrates, in addition to CTCF, TAD borders are enriched in SINE elements and tRNA genes (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M. Liu J.S. Ren B. Topological domains in mammalian genomes identified by analysis of chromatin interactions.Nature. 2012; 485: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (3983) Google Scholar), which contain binding sites for the insulator protein TFIIIC (Van Bortle and Corces, 2012Van Bortle K. Corces V.G. tDNA insulators and the emerging role of TFIIIC in genome organization.Transcription. 2012; 3: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is then possible that aligned insulators play a role in organizing the genome into domains, whereas single insulator sites inside TADs regulate interactions between regulatory sequences to control the expression of individual genes. CTCF is the main insulator protein characterized in vertebrates, although recent results suggest that tRNA genes may also have insulator function in human cells (Raab et al., 2012Raab J.R. Chiu J.

CTCF binds to specific sequences in the genome and mediates interactions among CTCF insulator sites in a process that is stabilized by cohesin (Parelho et al., 2008Parelho V. Hadjur S. Spivakov M.

In Drosophila, there are several sequence-specific DNA-binding insulator proteins that bind distinct genomic sites, including the Drosophila homolog of CTCF (dCTCF), Suppressor of Hairy-wing [Su(Hw)], and boundary element-associated factor (BEAF-32). These DNA-binding proteins recruit two common factors, centrosomal protein 190 (CP190) and Modifier of mdg4 [Mod(mdg4)], which are necessary for insulator activity (Gerasimova et al., 2007Gerasimova T.I.

Ghosh D. Corces V.G. The centrosomal protein CP190 is a component of the gypsy chromatin insulator.Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 737-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). CP190 and Mod(mdg4) contain BTB domains that mediate protein-protein interactions, thereby serving as a bridge to bring together distant insulator sites. Contacts between distant insulator sites via distinct chromatin loops result in clustering of these sites; a subset of clusters containing a large number of insulator sites can be visualized as “insulator bodies” in the nucleus (Gerasimova et al., 2000Gerasimova T.I. Byrd K. Corces V.G. A chromatin insulator determines the nuclear localization of DNA.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Many insulator bodies are present close to the nuclear periphery, and the attachment of insulator complexes to the nuclear lamina has been shown to be important for insulator activity in Drosophila (Capelson and Corces, 2005Capelson M. Corces V.G. The ubiquitin ligase dTopors directs the nuclear organization of a chromatin insulator.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that insulator function can be controlled, in principle, by regulating the binding of Su(Hw), dCTCF, or BEAF-32 to DNA, by modulating the interactions between these proteins and CP190 and/or Mod(mdg4), or by controlling their interaction with the nuclear matrix, but the mechanisms by which these interactions are regulated have not been explored in detail. It is plausible that posttranslational modification of insulator proteins may allow them to control interactions between specific sites in the genome in order to regulate different patterns of gene expression. Indeed, the activity of insulator proteins in Drosophila has been shown to be modulated by SUMO conjugation and ubiquitination (Capelson and Corces, 2005Capelson M. Corces V.G.

Similarly, vertebrate CTCF undergoes phosphorylation (El-Kady and Klenova, 2005El-Kady A. Klenova E.

Biol. 2009; 29: 714-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) (Yu et al., 2004Yu W. Ginjala V. Pant V. Chernukhin I. Whitehead J. Docquier F. Farrar D.

PARylation is the catalysis of a negatively charged polymer, poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), from the donor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) onto a target protein by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Although the activity of the CTCF insulator has been shown to be regulated by PARylation in mammalian cells, the underlying mechanism of this effect and the extent of its consequences on the establishment of inter- and intrachromosomal interactions remain unclear. For example, at the H19 imprinting control region (ICR), inhibition of PARylation impairs CTCF-mediated maternal imprinting without affecting its DNA binding (Yu et al., 2004Yu W. Ginjala V. Pant V. Chernukhin I. Whitehead J. Docquier F. Farrar D. Tavoosidana G. Mukhopadhyay R. Kanduri C. et al.Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation regulates CTCF-dependent chromatin insulation.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 1105-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). On the other hand, epigenetic silencing of the p16INK4a tumor suppressor gene is associated with defective PARylation of CTCF and the loss of CTCF binding (Witcher and Emerson, 2009Witcher M. Emerson B.M. Epigenetic silencing of the p16(INK4a) tumor suppressor is associated with loss of CTCF binding and a chromatin boundary.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 271-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyze the role of PARylation in the function of Drosophila insulator proteins. We find that CP190, dCTCF, Mod(mdg4)2.2, and Su(Hw) are PARylated in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of PARylation leads to weaker interactions between CP190 and dCTCF, as well as their association with the nuclear lamina. Furthermore, intrachromosomal interactions and nuclear clustering of CP190 are disrupted in Parp mutant cells, suggesting that PARylation stabilizes chromatin looping between distant insulator sites. Taken together, the results suggest that PARylation regulates the ability of insulators to organize the Drosophila genome by facilitating interactions among insulator sites. To explore the possibility that Drosophila insulator proteins are modified by PARylation, we immunoprecipitated CP190, Su(Hw), Mod(mdg4)2.2, and dCTCF proteins from Drosophila S2 cell extracts. Precipitated fractions were then subjected to western blot analysis, probing first with antibodies that recognize the PAR modification, followed by antibodies against each of the insulator proteins. We detected 190 kDa and 130 kDa PARylated products that correspond to the CP190 and Su(Hw) proteins, respectively (Figures 1A and 1B ). Similarly, we observed a 120 kDa PARylated product that corresponds to dCTCF (Figure S1A available online). These results suggest that CP190, dCTCF, and Su(Hw) insulator proteins are PARylated in vivo. Consistent with this finding, dCTCF could be immunoprecipitated with 10H antibody, which specifically recognizes PAR moieties on modified proteins (Figure S1A). Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitated Mod(mdg4)2.2 protein with PAR antibody produced a smear with several distinct bands. One of these bands migrates at about 120 kDa and corresponds to a minor product observed in the western blot probed with antibody to the Mod(mdg4)2.2 isoform, also known as Mod(mdg4)67.2 (Figure 1C, top arrowhead). This result suggests that, unlike CP190 and dCTCF proteins, Mod(mdg4)2.2 may undergo multiple rounds of PARylation. Next, we sought to find whether these insulator proteins can be PARylated in vitro. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged insulator proteins purified from E. coli were subjected to in vitro PARylation using biotinylated NAD+ as a substrate. As a control, GST tag could not be PARylated in vitro (Figure S1B). Both GST-CP190 and GST-dCTCF proteins were PARylated only in the absence of the PARP inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide (3AB) (Figure 1D). The presence of PARylated products that migrate closely to the unmodified proteins (middle and lower panels) suggests that, unlike mammalian CTCF, both CP190 and dCTCF proteins only undergo a single round of PARylation (Figure 1D). Consistent with in vivo data, GST-Mod(mdg4)2.2 and GST-Su(Hw) proteins can also be PARylated in vitro (Figure S1B).Figure S1Drosophila Insulators Undergo In Vivo and In Vitro PARylation, Related to Figures 1 and 2Show full caption(A) dCTCF is PARylated in S2 cells.

Chi-square test between wild-type and K566A transgenic lines is p < 0.0001 (left). Western analyses of the level of CP190 and Lamin Dm0 proteins in different transgenic lines (right). PARylation was previously shown to occur at a novel poly(ADP-ribose)-binding zinc finger (PBZ) motif in a number of eukaryotic proteins that are involved in the DNA damage response and checkpoint regulation (Ahel et al., 2008Ahel I. Ahel D. Matsusaka T. Clark A.J. Pines J. Boulton S.J. West S.C. Poly(ADP-ribose)-binding zinc finger motifs in DNA repair/checkpoint proteins.Nature. 2008; 451: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Analyses of insulator protein sequences suggest that CP190, and to a lesser extent dCTCF, may contain similar PBZ motifs (Figure S1C). To test whether this putative PBZ domain plays an active role in PARylation of CP190 and dCTCF, we substituted lysine 566 (K566) of CP190 and lysine 434 (K434) of dCTCF with alanine residues by site-directed mutagenesis. In vitro PARylation of CP190 is severely impaired when K566 is mutated, indicating that CP190 contains a similar PBZ motif crucial for this posttranslational modification (Figure 1E). On the other hand, mutation of K434 of dCTCF has no consequence on PARylation (data not shown), consistent with the report that PARylation of CTCF occurs specifically in the N-terminal region (Farrar et al., 2010Farrar D. Rai S. Chernukhin I. Jagodic M. Ito Y. Yammine S. Ohlsson R. Murrell A. Klenova E. Mutational analysis of the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation sites of the transcription factor CTCF provides an insight into the mechanism of its regulation by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 1199-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The in vivo role of the K566 residue was then examined by studying the biochemical properties of transiently expressed myc-tagged wild-type (WT) and K566A mutant CP190 in S2 cells (Figure S1D). Comparable expression of WT and K566A myc-tagged CP190 protein was observed in S2 cells 48 hr after calcium phosphate transfection (Figure S1D). Consistent with in vitro assays (Figure 1E), the PAR moiety was detected on WT, but not on K566A CP190, protein after immunoprecipitation (IP) with myc antibody (Figure 1F), confirming that lysine 566 is required for PARylation in vivo. We next tested whether a mutation of the Parp gene in ParpCH1/+ flies alters insulator function using two reporter mutant strains, yellow-2 (y2) and cut-6 (ct6). These strains were generated by the insertion of the gypsy retrotransposon, which contains multiple Su(Hw) binding sites, between the enhancer and promoter sequences of the yellow and cut genes. Binding of Su(Hw), Mod(mdg4)2.2 and CP190 proteins to the gypsy transposon blocks the communication between these regulatory elements. As a result, adult y2ct6 flies have light abdominal pigmentation and cut wing margins (Figures 2A and 2B ). Normal pigmentation is partially restored in hypomorphic CP1904-1/CP190H312 mutant flies (Pai et al., 2004Pai C.Y. Lei E.P. Ghosh D. Corces V.G. The centrosomal protein CP190 is a component of the gypsy chromatin insulator.Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 737-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), which show darker pigmentation owing to intermediate y2 expression (Figure 2A). In y2 flies that are heterozygous ParpCH1/+, the majority of the animals also exhibit darker abdominal pigmentation. Combination of either the CP1904-1/CP190H312 or mod(mdg4)T6 mutations with ParpCH1/+ further reduces insulator activity, with more flies exhibiting the darkest pigmentation (Figures 2A and S1E). Similarly, expression of the cut gene is partially rescued in mod(mdg4)T6 mutants, which show one or multiple notches in the wing margin (Figure 2B). Although ParpCH1/+ did not suppress the ct6 phenotype, the majority of mod(mdg4)T6/mod(mdg4)T6;ParpCH1/+ double mutants have round wing margins, indicative of impaired insulator activity (Figure 2B). Taken together, these results show that PARylation is required for proper Su(Hw) insulator function in vivo. We next asked whether mutation of the Parp gene would also affect the activity of the Fab-8 insulator, which requires the dCTCF and CP190 proteins for function (Gerasimova et al., 2007Gerasimova T.I.

https://openalex.org/W2027396434,"Activation of G protein-coupled receptors by their associated ligands has been extensively studied, and increasing structural information about the molecular mechanisms underlying ligand-dependent receptor activation is beginning to emerge with the recent expansion in GPCR crystal structures. However, some GPCRs are also able to adopt active conformations in the absence of agonist binding that result in the initiation of signal transduction and receptor down-modulation. In this report, we show that the CC-type chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1) exhibits significant constitutive activity leading to a variety of cellular responses. CCR1 expression is sufficient to induce inhibition of cAMP formation, increased F-actin content, and basal migration of human and murine leukocytes. The constitutive activity leads to basal phosphorylation of the receptor, recruitment of β-arrestin-2, and subsequent receptor internalization. CCR1 concurrently engages Gαi and β-arrestin-2 in a multiprotein complex, which may be accommodated by homo-oligomerization or receptor clustering. The data suggest the presence of two functional states for CCR1; whereas receptor coupled to Gαi functions as a canonical GPCR, albeit with high constitutive activity, the CCR1·β-arrestin-2 complex is required for G protein-independent constitutive receptor internalization. The pertussis toxin-insensitive uptake of chemokine by the receptor suggests that the CCR1·β-arrestin-2 complex may be related to a potential scavenging function of the receptor, which may be important for maintenance of chemokine gradients and receptor responsiveness in complex fields of chemokines during inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2058078854,"There is currently no effective treatment for infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, a neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease that occurs in childhood. Here the authors show that a small molecule thioesterase-mimetic can alleviate neuropathology and extend lifespan in an animal model of the disease. Infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (INCL) is a devastating childhood neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease (LSD) that has no effective treatment. It is caused by inactivating mutations in the palmitoyl-protein thioesterase-1 (PPT1) gene. PPT1 deficiency impairs the cleavage of thioester linkage in palmitoylated proteins (constituents of ceroid), preventing degradation by lysosomal hydrolases. Consequently, accumulation of lysosomal ceroid leads to INCL. Thioester linkage is cleaved by nucleophilic attack. Hydroxylamine, a potent nucleophilic cellular metabolite, may have therapeutic potential for INCL, but its toxicity precludes clinical application. We found that a hydroxylamine derivative, N-(tert-Butyl) hydroxylamine (NtBuHA), was non-toxic, cleaved thioester linkage in palmitoylated proteins and mediated lysosomal ceroid depletion in cultured cells from INCL patients. In Ppt1−/− mice, which mimic INCL, NtBuHA crossed the blood-brain barrier, depleted lysosomal ceroid, suppressed neuronal apoptosis, slowed neurological deterioration and extended lifespan. Our findings provide a proof of concept that thioesterase-mimetic and antioxidant small molecules such as NtBuHA are potential drug targets for thioesterase deficiency diseases such as INCL."
https://openalex.org/W2016233397,"Type I polyketide synthases often use programmed β-branching, via enzymes of a 'hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HCS) cassette', to incorporate various side chains at the second carbon from the terminal carboxylic acid of growing polyketide backbones. We identified a strong sequence motif in acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) where β-branching is known to occur. Substituting ACPs confirmed a correlation of ACP type with β-branching specificity. Although these ACPs often occur in tandem, NMR analysis of tandem β-branching ACPs indicated no ACP-ACP synergistic effects and revealed that the conserved sequence motif forms an internal core rather than an exposed patch. Modeling and mutagenesis identified ACP helix III as a probable anchor point of the ACP-HCS complex whose position is determined by the core. Mutating the core affects ACP functionality, whereas ACP-HCS interface substitutions modulate system specificity. Our method for predicting β-carbon branching expands the potential for engineering new polyketides and lays a basis for determining specificity rules."

Two appear to be connected with a subgroup of galaxies at 650 kpc radius that is merging into the cluster, implying coherence over several hundred Myr. Such long lifetime implies that strong isotropic turbulence and conduction are suppressed in the core, despite the unrelaxed state of the cluster. Magnetic fields are presumably responsible.

Significance: These findings have relevance for therapeutic approaches aimed at targeting the TGF-β pathway in disease conditions. The mammalian genome contains three related isoforms of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) proteins known as TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3. The TGF-β isoforms are multifunctional cytokines that influence cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix deposition. Because of these activities, the TGF-β isoforms play important physiological roles in regulating embryonic development, controlling immunity, and maintaining epithelial homeostasis (1.Massagué J.

With such potent attributes, TGF-β signaling is tightly regulated where each TGF-β is secreted as a dimer that must undergo further processing to dissociate the LAP 2The abbreviations used are: LAPlatency associated peptideWATwhite adipose tissueauarbitrary unitBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolBMSCbone mesenchymal stem cell. from the receptor-binding ligand. Upon activation, the mature ligand binds to the type I and type II receptors to induce cellular changes through Smad-dependent or Smad-independent signaling pathways (3.Shi Y. Massagué J. Mechanisms of TGF-β signaling from cell membrane to the nucleus.Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4800) Google Scholar). The inhibitory LAP domains display only 40% homology between the three isoforms, but the mature TGF-β ligands, in contrast, share about 80% homology in amino acid sequence and a common hallmark of nine conserved cysteines (4.Mittl P.R.

In the mature region, sequence variation between the TGF-β isoforms is primarily found in the amino-terminal α-helix and in the loops between the β-sheets (6.Kingsley D.M.

Differential expression of the TGF-β isoforms in embryogenesis suggests specific roles in developing and adult tissues.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1992; 32: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the developing embryo, for example, all three TGF-β proteins have distinct cell-specific expression patterns that reflect the differences in the promoters located within each homologue's gene (9.Millan F.A. Denhez F. Kondaiah P. Akhurst R.J.

Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1091-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). In general, TGF-β1 expression is induced by immediate early genes in response to signals such as injury and stress, whereas TGF-β2 and TGF-β3 appear to be more hormonally and developmentally regulated (8.Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Differential expression of the TGF-β isoforms in embryogenesis suggests specific roles in developing and adult tissues.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1992; 32: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The distinct pattern of expression for each homologue suggests that the TGF-β isoforms may play differing roles in processes such as development and organogenesis. In agreement with this notion, each TGF-β isoform null mouse has unique phenotypes. The TGF-β1−/− mice have defects in hematopoiesis and vasculogenesis that result in embryonic lethality for 50% of TGF-β1 knock-out mice with a mixed genetic background (11.Dickson M.C. Martin J.S. Cousins F.M. Kulkarni A.B. Karlsson S. Akhurst R.J. Defective haematopoiesis and vasculogenesis in transforming growth factor β1 knock out mice.Development. 1995; 121: 1845-1854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β1−/− pups that survive to birth are born developmentally normal but exhibit multifocal autoimmune inflammation by 2 weeks of age that result in organ failure and premature death (12.Shull M.M.

U.S.A. 1993; 90: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). In contrast to the TGF-β1−/− mice, the TGF-β2−/− mice exhibit perinatal mortality with multiple developmental defects in the heart, lung, and skeleton (14.Sanford L.P. Ormsby I. Gittenberger-de Groot A.C. Sariola H. Friedman R. Boivin G.P. Cardell E.L. Doetschman T. TGF-β2 knockout mice have multiple developmental defects that are non-overlapping with other TGF-β knockout phenotypes.Development. 1997; 124: 2659-2670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Targeted deletion of TGF-β3 also displays a unique phenotype wherein TGF-β3−/− mice die shortly after birth with a cleft palate defect and delayed pulmonary development (15.Proetzel G. Pawlowski S.A. Wiles M.V. Yin M. Boivin G.P. Howles P.N. Ding J. Ferguson M.W. Doetschman T. Transforming growth factor-β3 is required for secondary palate fusion.Nat.

Abnormal lung development and cleft palate in mice lacking TGF-β3 indicates defects of epithelial-mesenchymal interaction.Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). The unique phenotypes for each TGF-β null mouse suggest that the isoforms are not interchangeable, but it is difficult to use the pathological manifestations seen in these knock-out mice to ascribe any nonredundant attributes to each TGF-β homologue, particularly when the loss of an isoform's spatiotemporal expression, in addition to its active/absolute concentrations, contributes to the phenotype of the null mouse. Although the TGF-β proteins have differing knock-out phenotypes and patterns of expression, some isoform-specific roles have been identified between the ligands with in vivo testing and organ culture. For example, in conjunction with the cleft palate phenotype of TGF-β3 null mice, only TGF-β3 can induce full palate fusion, a function that cannot be rescued by addition of either TGF-β1 or TGF-β2 (17.Brunet C.L. Sharpe P.M. Ferguson M.W. Inhibition of TGF-β3 (but not TGF-β1 or TGF-β2) activity prevents normal mouse embryonic palate fusion.Int. J. Dev.

Biol. 2007; 312: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Additionally, TGF-β3 does not promote scarring like the other two homologues, and it may have a unique role in the orchestration of dermal and epidermal cell motility (19.Shah M. Foreman D.

So, although seemingly similar in vitro, studying the complex physiological activities of each TGF-β in an in vivo setting seems necessary to fully identify any isoform-specific niche for each homologue. With these previous studies suggesting isoform-specific functions, we exchanged the murine TGF-β1 ligand with its TGF-β3 homologue to fully test the degree of redundancy among these TGF-β isoforms, essentially generating a TGF-β1Lβ3/Lβ3 knock-in mouse. As mentioned, these TGF-β1Lβ3/Lβ3 knock-in mice will provide further insight into the conserved heterology that exists between the TGF-β isoforms, with particular attention paid to the similarities and differences between the well studied TGF-β1 protein and the less characterized isoform TGF-β3. The TGF-β1Lβ3/Lβ3 knock-in mouse will provide a better understanding about the isoform-specific functions linked to TGF-β3, which is needed because this TGF-β homologue, although less studied, still appears to possess significant physiological activity. First, we engineered a chimeric TGF-β1/3 protein wherein the TGF-β1 LAP was combined with an HA-tagged TGF-β3 ligand. This chimeric strategy allows for sequestration and activation via the TGF-β1 LAP in its normal physiological context but for signaling to occur through the TGF-β3 ligand. Once tested for proper folding and latency, the chimeric TGF-β1/3 sequence was knocked into the TGF-β1 genetic locus. The resulting TGF-β1Lβ3/Lβ3 knock-in mice did not manifest any phenotype typical of the TGF-β1−/− mouse, such as embryonic lethality from vasculogenesis defects in utero, nor any signs of multifocal inflammation. Although this appears to show redundancy between the isoforms, physiological alterations in metabolism along with abnormal bone and tooth mineralization suggest that certain physiological functions of TGF-β1 cannot be replaced through knock-in of TGF-β3. Chimeric TGF-β cDNAs were generated by ligating PCR products of the TGF-β1 LAP with sequence for the mature HA-tagged ligands of murine TGF-β3, murine TGF-β2, and porcine TGF-β1 (21.Wolfraim L.A. Alkemade G.M. Alex B. Sharpe S. Parks W.T. Letterio J.J. Development and application of fully functional epitope-tagged forms of transforming growth factor-β.J. Immunol.

The resulting chimeric TGF-β cDNAs were subcloned into the pSG5 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) vector to study proper expression and secretion. The chimeric TGF-β1/3 cDNA was selected for further study to test latency and activation. After confirming proper folding latency and activation, TGF-β1 promoter-driven expression vectors were constructed using a clone of the TGF-β1 gene derived from a BALB/c liver genomic library (22.Geiser A. Kim S. Roberts A. Sporn M. Characterization of the mouse transforming growth factor-β1 promoter and activation by the Ha-ras oncogene.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 84-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the E2β1/3 expression vector, the chimeric TGF-β1/3 cDNA was subcloned into a BsaBI site located within exon 2 of the TGF-β1 gene, where placement of the chimeric cDNA would minimize any potential perturbations to the TGF-β1 promoter. The E2β1/3 vector contains about 10.5 kb of the TGF-β1 gene, including both TGF-β1 transcriptional start sites as well as the first exon and intron. For stable transfections, the E2β1/3 expression vector also included a floxed neomycin resistance (Neor) gene downstream of the chimeric cDNA that is driven by the thymidine kinase promoter (gift from H. Gu). The E2β1/3 expression vector was transfected into NIH-3T3 cells that contain active Ras, to induce expression via the TGF-β1 promoter. Stable cell lines were established, and the secreted HA epitope-tagged TGF-β1/3 protein was detected in the supernatants. After confirmation that the chimeric protein could be expressed with the TGF-β1 promoter, a targeting construct was generated wherein the E2β1/3 vector was combined with a 1.8-kb 3′ homology arm from the TGF-β1 genomic clone, as well as the HSV-thymidine kinase gene from pPNT (23.Tybulewicz V.L. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Neonatal lethality and lymphopenia in mice with a homozygous disruption of the c-abl proto-oncogene.Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar), for negative selection. COS7 cells were transfected with the pSG5-TGF-β1/3 expression vector to study secretion, latency, and activation of the chimeric protein. COS7 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen), and after overnight incubation, the medium was replaced with serum-free Opti-MEM supplemented with MITO plus (BD Biosciences). Supernatants were then collected after 48 h and tested with Western blot using both reducing and nonreducing conditions to examine the expression and latency of the chimeric TGF-β1/3 (see below for Western blots). To study the signaling capability of the epitope-tagged TGF-β3 ligand, cell-free supernatants from the transfected COS7 cells were diluted 1:3 with fresh serum-free medium and added onto 5 × 105 HepG2 cells in a 6-cm culture dish. HepG2 cells were tested with either unaltered supernatant or with medium from the transfected cells that had been heated at 80 °C for 5 min, which releases the TGF-β3 ligand from the LAP without denaturing/inactivating the receptor-binding mature domain. The cells were lysed after 30 min, and the lysates were run on a Western blot to determine the level of Smad2 phosphorylation. Before proceeding with a targeting vector, TGF-β1 promoter-driven expression vectors were transfected into NIH-3T3 cells using Lipofectamine. These NIH-3T3 cells were previously infected with Harvey Sarcoma virus and expressed Ha-Ras, an oncogene that would stimulate the TGF-β1 promoter (22.Geiser A. Kim S. Roberts A. Sporn M. Characterization of the mouse transforming growth factor-β1 promoter and activation by the Ha-ras oncogene.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 84-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were treated with G418 to derive stable cell lines, and serum-free supernatants were collected within 48 h after plating. With confirmation that the TGF-β1 promoter could drive expression of the chimeric TGF-β1/3, a targeting vector was constructed and electroporated into R1 embryonic stem cells, a cell line derived from a 129/Sv mouse strain. Twenty four hours after electroporation, the cells were treated with G418 and gancyclovir. Individual clones were selected after 10 days of drug treatment. Some stem cells used to generate knock-in mice were allowed to differentiate in culture, and supernatants were collected to test for secretion of the tagged chimeric TGF-β1/3 protein. Southern blot analysis and PCR were performed to identify which clones had undergone proper homologous recombination in the R1 cells. The DNA from drug-resistant stem cell clones was purified through phenol and chloroform extraction and digested with BamHI. A 0.5-kb TGF-β1 PCR fragment derived from ES cell genomic DNA was used as a flanking probe for the Southern analysis. An 8-kb band was detected for the wild type allele, whereas a 6-kb band appeared if proper homologous recombination occurred. PCR for homologous recombination was performed using a primer located in the Neor marker (GTTCGAGGCCACACGCGTCA) and a primer downstream of any TGF-β1 genetic sequence used in the 3′ homology arm of the targeting construct (GCCTCTGCCTCACAAGCGCA). Two positive clones were injected into C57Bl/6 mouse blastocysts that underwent germ line transmission. The male chimeras were then crossed with C57Bl/6 females to generate F1 offspring. The offspring were bred to homozygosity and were genotyped by PCR using the following primers: In-B3For (GTTTGGTTTTGTTTGAGGCGTG), In-B3Rev (ACACAGCAGTTCTCCTCCAGGTTG), and Ex2 Rev (GGGCTGACCTGTGTGCCACC). The PCR was run for 40 cycles at an annealing temperature of 60 °C. A 1-kb PCR product was generated in this reaction for the knock-in allele, whereas only a 0.6-kb band was produced if the wild type TGF-β1 allele was present. All care to the mice was given in compliance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines on the use of laboratory and experimental animals, and the studies were approved by the NIDCR Animal Care and Use Committee. Food and water were provided ad libitum. Because of defects noticed in the teeth of the mice, animals were supplemented with a transgenic dough diet (Bio Serv, Frenchtown, NJ). Tissues were carefully dissected from the mice and fixed overnight in 10% buffered formalin. The tissues were primarily embedded in paraffin, and 5-μm sections were used for histopathological analysis. Pathology was examined using slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E); mast cells were detected using toluidine blue staining, and fat accumulation was examined using Oil Red O staining from frozen sections of the liver. For immunohistochemistry, sections were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated with descending grades of ethanol, blocked for 30 min, and incubated with primary antibody (see below) prepared in background-reducing antibody diluent (Dako, Carpenteria, CA). Next, the sections were treated with either rabbit on rodent HRP-polymer (Biocare, Concord, CA) or with a biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), followed by treatment with the Vectastain ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories). Antibody complexes were detected using liquid 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Biogenex, Fremont, CA). For immunohistochemistry of the bone, femurs and tibias of the mice were decalcified using 0.1 m EDTA for 2 weeks. For antigen retrieval, slides were heated overnight at 60 °C in target retrieval solution (Dako). Primary antibody dilutions are as follows: a 1:50 dilution for F4/80 (Invitrogen); 1:150 anti-Smad2, phospho-specific (Ser-465/467) (AB3849 Millipore, Billerica, MA); 1:200 TGF-β3 (24.Figueroa J.D.

Protein lysates were generated from cultured cells and mouse tissues using T-PER (Thermo Scientific Pierce) with a complete mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). To study secretion of the TGF-β proteins, serum-free medium from the cultured cell lines was collected, treated with 200 mm PMSF (Sigma), and concentrated using an Amicon ultracentrifugal filter device (Millipore). Activation of the chimeric TGF-β1/3 protein was achieved by heating supernatants at 80 °C for 5 min or through incubation with two known TGF-β activators, either plasmin (0.001 unit/ml, Sigma) or thrombospondin (0.04 mg/ml, Sigma) at 37 °C for 2 h. For Western blot, about 50 μg of protein were denatured and separated with electrophoresis on NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris precast gels using XCell SureLock Mini-Cell (Invitrogen). Nonreducing Western blot was performed using conditions specified for the NativePAGE Novex BisTris gel system (Invitrogen). Proteins were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked for 1 h, and incubated with primary antibodies overnight. The bound primary antibodies were then visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by chemiluminescence detection (Pierce). The following primary antibody dilutions were used: 1:1000 anti-actin (Millipore MAB1501); 1:100 anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Abcam ab9485); 1:500 TGF-β1 (Promega G1221); 1:500 TGF-β2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); 1:500 TGF-β3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); 1:1000 anti-HA (Cell Signaling); 1:200 TGF-β1 LAP (R&D Systems); 1:500 anti-Smad2 (Invitrogen 51-1300); and 1:500 anti-Smad2, phospho-specific (Ser-465/467) (Millipore AB3849). RNA was extracted from tissues of the mice using miRNeasy (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Using random primers (Invitrogen), about 500 ng of RNA were reverse-transcribed into cDNA through Super Script III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). To examine for any TGF-β1 expression, 40 cycles of RT-PCR were performed using TGF-β1 primers from exon 2 to 7 (25.Jakowlew S. Moody T. You L. Mariano J. Transforming growth factor-β expression in mouse lung carcinogenesis.Exp. Lung Res. 1998; 24: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). RT-PCR for GAPDH (TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG and GATGCAGGGATGATGTTC) was used as a control. For gene expression analysis of white adipose tissue, total RNA was isolated from epididymal WAT by using the RNeasy kit, and cDNA was transcribed using high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen catalog no. 4368814) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quantitative gene expression was measured by real time PCR in Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real Time PCR System using Fast SYBR® Green Master Mix (catalog no. 4385612). The expression of several adipose tissue- and lipid-related gene markers were determined by performing 40 cycles as follows: Cidea, AGCTCGCCCTTTTCGAGTTTC and GGCCAGTTGTGATGACTAAGAC; PRDM16, TGCTGACGGATACAGAGGTGT and CCACGCAGAACTTCTCGCTAC; Cox8b, TGTGGGGATCTCAGCCATAGT and AGTGGGCTAAGACCCATCCTG; DiO2, ACACTGGAATTGGGAGCATC and ATGCTGACCTCAGAAGGGCT; UCP-1, AGGCTTCCAGTACCATTAGGT and CTGAGTGAGGCAAAGCTGATTT; PGC1a, TATGGAGTGACATAGAGTGTGCT and CCACTTCAATCCACCCAGAAAG; ELOVL3, CCGCGTTCTCATGTAGGTCT and CTTAAGGCCCTTTTTGGAGG; Tgfbr1, CAACCCAGGTCCTTCCTAAA and GGAGAGCCCTGGATACCAAC; Tgfbr2, CCGCTGCATATCGTCCTGTG and AGTGGATGGATGGTCCTATTACA; ID1, GGTGAACGTCCTGCTCTACGA and AGACTCCGAGTTCAGCTCCAG; Jun-B, TGCGGACGGTTTTGTCAA and GCGTCACGTGGTTCATCTTG; Serpine1, CAGAGCAACAAGTTCAACTACACTGA and CAGCGATGAACATGCTGAGG; Smad7, GGCCGGATCTCAGGCATTC and TTGGGTATCTGGAGTAAGGAGG. Gene expression was analyzed by adopting the standard ΔΔCT method of real time PCR, and results were expressed as a relative fold change in gene expression compared with wild type/control. Mice were euthanized with CO2, and blood samples were collected by intracardiac puncture into microtainer tubes. Blood samples were left on ice for 15 min and spun at 3500 × g for 25 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge at room temperature. Serum was collected, aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C. The level of TGF-β1 in the serum was determined by ELISA using the mouse/rat/porcine TGF-β1 immunoassay kit (R&D Systems). Serum was diluted 60-fold after acid activation, and total TGF-β1 was determined according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the glucose tolerance test (26.Yadav H. Quijano C. Kamaraju A.K.

Tail blood was collected at given time intervals for automated glucose measurement using Alphatrak glucometer and glucose strips (catalog no. 32006-06). For adipokine measurement, mice were fasted for 12 h; a tail bleed was performed, and serum was analyzed using the Mouse Adipokine Panel- 7 Plex (Millipore MADPK-71K-07) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

https://openalex.org/W2034868654,"FE65 is an adaptor protein that binds to the amyloid precursor protein (APP). As such, FE65 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In addition, evidence suggests that FE65 is involved in brain development. It is generally believed that FE65 participates in these processes by recruiting various interacting partners to form functional complexes. Here, we show that via its first phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, FE65 binds to the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6). FE65 preferentially binds to ARF6-GDP, and they colocalize in neuronal growth cones. Interestingly, FE65 stimulates the activation of both ARF6 and its downstream GTPase Rac1, a regulator of actin dynamics, and functions in growth cones to stimulate neurite outgrowth. We show that transfection of FE65 and/or ARF6 promotes whereas small interfering RNA knockdown of FE65 or ARF6 inhibits neurite outgrowth in cultured neurons as compared to the mock-transfected control cells. Moreover, knockdown of ARF6 attenuates FE65 stimulation of neurite outgrowth and defective neurite outgrowth seen in FE65-deficient neurons is partially corrected by ARF6 overexpression. Notably, the stimulatory effect of FE65 and ARF6 on neurite outgrowth is abrogated either by dominant-negative Rac1 or knockdown of Rac1. Thus, we identify FE65 as a novel regulator of neurite outgrowth via controlling ARF6-Rac1 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2118168256,"Localization of mRNAs contributes to the generation and maintenance of cellular asymmetry in a wide range of organisms. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the so-called locasome complex with its core components Myo4p, She2p, and She3p localizes more than 30 mRNAs to the yeast bud tip. A significant fraction of these mRNAs encodes membrane or secreted proteins. Their localization requires, besides the locasome, a functional segregation apparatus of the cortical endoplasmic reticulum (ER), including the machinery that is involved in the movement of ER tubules into the bud. Colocalization of RNA-containing particles with these tubules suggests a coordinated transport of localized mRNAs and the cortical ER to the bud. Association of localized mRNAs to the ER requires the presence of the locasome component She2p. Here we report that She2p is not only an RNA-binding protein but can specifically bind to ER-derived membranes in a membrane curvature-dependent manner in vitro. Although it does not contain any known curvature recognizing motifs, the protein shows a binding preference for liposomes with a diameter resembling that of yeast ER tubules. In addition, membrane binding depends on tetramerization of She2p. In an in vivo membrane-tethering assay, She2p can target a viral peptide GFP fusion protein to the cortical ER, indicating that a fraction of She2p associates with the ER in vivo.

In budding yeast, mRNA localization has been studied mainly using ASH1 mRNA as a model RNA. ASH1 encodes a transcriptional repressor and cell fate determinant and is localized to the tip of the mature bud (the daughter cell). Its local translation at the tip of the daughter cell ensures the repression of the HO endonuclease after cell division only in the daughter cell (4.Long R.M. Singer R.H. Meng X. Gonzalez I.

The RNA-binding protein She2p is a core component of mRNPs containing ASH1 (5.Böhl F. Kruse C. Frank A. Ferring D. Jansen R.P.

In addition to the Myo4p-She3p-She2p core complex, three additional RNA-binding proteins (Loc1p, Puf6p, and Khd1p) are needed for efficient ASH1 mRNA localization and translational silencing of the mRNA (12.Gu W.

These tubular structures move in an actin-dependent manner into the bud, followed by spreading of the cER along the bud cortex (20.Du Y. Ferro-Novick S. Novick P. Dynamics and inheritance of the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2871-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Movement, but not spreading, of the cER along the plasma membrane is required for the localization of a subset of mRNAs to the bud tip (18.Fundakowski J. Hermesh O. Jansen R.-P. Localization of a subset of yeast mRNAs depends on inheritance of endoplasmic reticulum.Traffic. 2012; 13: 1642-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These mRNAs encode membrane proteins and are expressed at the time when ER tubules move into the bud. Cotransport of mRNAs with the ER might, therefore, support an efficient synthesis at the cortical ER. Although the RNA-binding protein She2p is not essential for cER segregation (24.Estrada P. Kim J.

Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1255-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), it is necessary for association of some of its target mRNAs with ER tubules (19.Schmid M. Jaedicke A. Du T.-G. Jansen R.-P. Coordination of endoplasmic reticulum and mRNA localization to the yeast bud.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1538-1543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). She2p has been shown to cofractionate with the ER, but the nature of the association remained obscure. Here we demonstrate that She2p can specifically bind to ER-derived microsomes in vitro even in the absence of other components of the locasome or associated mRNAs. Furthermore, it can bind to protein-free liposomes with a preference for highly curved membranes. In vivo, it can direct a viral peptide tag to the cortical ER, consistent with the idea that She2p is not only an RNA- but also a membrane-binding protein that could directly link its target mRNAs to ER membranes with high curvature, as present in the cER. Plasmids for expression of GST fusions to wild-type She2p and She2p Asn-36 → Ser/Arg-63 → Lys have been described (8.Du T.-G. Jellbauer S. Müller M. Schmid M. Niessing D. Jansen R.-P.

To generate expression vectors for She2p mutants Ser-120 → Tyr and Lys-130 → Tyr, site-directed mutagenesis of pGEX-TEV-SHE2 was performed using the oligonucleotide pair RJO2003 and RJO2004 (Ser-120 → Tyr) or RJO2035 and RJO2036 (Lys-130 → Tyr), respectively. Generation of GST-She2pΔhelixE has been described elsewhere (26.Müller M. Heym R.G. Mayer A. Kramer K. Schmid M. Cramer P. Urlaub H. Jansen R.-P. Niessing D.

The GFP-TGB3(25–52) plasmid allowing the expression of GFP fused to a peptide from the plant potexvirus TGB3 protein (27.Wu C.-H. Lee S.-C. Wang C.-W.

To introduce the SHE2 or MS2 coat protein (MS2-CP) coding regions, they were amplified with primers RJO4320, RJO4321, RJO4405, and RJO4406 and cloned between GFP and the signal sequence of TGB3(25–52) to create the corresponding fusion proteins. The resulting plasmids RJP1848 and RJP1850 were transformed into BY4741 WT yeast cells. GST was expressed from plasmid pET-23a and purified according to the instructions of the manufacturer (GE Healthcare). Wild-type She2p and all She2p mutants were expressed as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)/pRIL (Invitrogen). Purification to > 95% homogeneity was reached using standard chromatography techniques (25.Niessing D. Hüttelmaier S. Zenklusen D. Singer R.H. Burley S.K.

The GST tag was removed by cleavage with tobacco etch virus protease (Invitrogen) or, in the case of She2pΔhelixE, by cleavage using PreScission protease (GE Healthcare). After addition of glycerol to 20%, She2p was quickly cooled in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. Cell lysis was performed from yeast spheroplasts generated from strains BY4742 (SHE2) or RJY2053 (she2Δ::kanMX4) to maximally preserve subcellular integrity. Velocity gradient centrifugation of cell lysates on 18–60% sucrose gradients was performed as described (19.Schmid M. Jaedicke A. Du T.-G. Jansen R.-P.

In brief, cells corresponding to 400 A600 units were harvested, spheroplasted, lysed with a needle, and cleared from cell debris as described above. 1 ml of the homogenate (corresponding to 66 A600 units) was then loaded onto a linear 18–60% gradient of sucrose in 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 6.8), 140 mm potassium acetate, and 1 mm magnesium acetate. Gradients were spun in a SW40 rotor for 2.3 h at 38,000 × g. 12 × 1-ml fractions were collected starting close to the bottom of the gradient. The remaining pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer. Fractions were precipitated with TCA and resuspended in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer. 20 μl of these were used for Western blot analysis, except for the top three fractions, where only 7 μl were used to avoid overloading of the gel. Western blots were performed using ECL, scanned, and quantified by using ImageJ. For in vitro binding experiments, yeast lysate was prepared from the she2Δ strain RJY2053. 1 ml of lysate (corresponding to 66 A600 units) was preincubated with recombinant She2p or She2p mutant protein (50 pmol protein/binding reaction) for 30 min on ice. The suspension was loaded on an 18–60% gradient and treated as described above. Quick subcellular fraction of yeast cells to separate heavy membranes (nuclei and ER) from free polysomes and cytosolic proteins was performed according to Frey et al. (30.Frey S. Pool M. Seedorf M. Scp160p, an RNA-binding, polysome-associated protein, localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a microtubule-dependent manner.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15905-15912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In short, yeast cells were lysed with glass beads, and three centrifugation steps at 4 °C were performed (20 min at 6000 × g to pellet heavy membranes, 20 min at 18, 000 × g to pellet light membranes and heavy polysomes, and 20 min at 20,0000 × g to pellet ribosomes). To follow the distribution of She2p or marker proteins, commercial antibodies against GFP (Covance, Princeton); Dpm1 (Molecular Probes); Pgk1p (Invitrogen); GST (Novagen); maltose binding protein (Novagen); or custom antibodies against Sec61p, She2p, OM45p, or Mcr1p were used in Western blot analyses. Mitochondria of yeast cells were isolated by differential centrifugation as described previously (31.Daum G. Gasser S.M. Schatz G. Import of proteins into mitochondria. Energy-dependent, two-step processing of the intermembrane space enzyme cytochrome b2 by isolated yeast mitochondria.J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13075-13080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further purification of mitochondria was achieved via a self-generated Percoll or sucrose step gradients (32.Graham J.M. Purification of a Crude Mitochondrial Fraction by Density-Gradient Centrifugation. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ2001Google Scholar). Preparation of yeast microsomes from the she2Δ strains RJY2053 (she2Δ) or RJY2370 (she2Δ HMG1-GFP::URA3) was essentially performed as described previously (33.Brodsky J.L. Schekman R.

In brief, yeast spheroplasts were lysed by Dounce homogenization with a tight-fitting pestle. To collect a membrane fraction enriched in microsomes (yeast rough membranes), 15 ml of lysate was loaded onto a 15-ml 1 m sucrose cushion, followed by 10-min centrifugation at 3000 × g and 4 °C. The upper layer was recovered avoiding the interface, and membranes were pelleted (21, 000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The membrane pellet was resuspended in buffer 88 (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 6.8), 150 mm potassium acetate (pH 7.4), 250 mm sorbitol, and 5 mm magnesium acetate), pelleted again, and resuspended in 2 ml of buffer 88 to a final concentration of about A260 = 40/ml (corresponding to a protein concentration of 10–12 mg/ml). For flotation purification, membranes were mixed with 2.5 m sucrose in flotation buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 5 mm magnesium acetate, 150 mm potassium acetate, and 1.5 mm DTT). This mixture was layered at the bottom of an ultraclear SW55 tube and carefully covered by a cushion of 1.9 m sucrose in flotation buffer (cushion II), followed by a second cushion of flotation buffer only (cushion I). Centrifugation was carried out at 4 °C for 90 min at 240,000 × g, and the membrane fraction was collected at the interface between cushions I and II. If binding assays were performed with protease-treated membranes, yeast rough membranes were adjusted to 10 mm CaCl2 and treated for 30 min at 37 °C with a combination of 2 mg/ml pronase E and 2 mg/ml proteinase K. Subsequently, proteases were inhibited with an excess of EGTA, EDTA, and 1 mm PMSF. Membrane preparations were washed two times with buffer 88, and the same buffer was used to resuspend membranes to a final concentration of about A260 = 40/ml. The size distribution of prepared membrane vesicles was verified by dynamic light scattering in a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments, Herrenberg, Germany). For the binding assay, flotation-purified ER membranes and pure mitochondria corresponding to 100 μg of protein were diluted with 2 volumes of flotation buffer and mixed with recombinant protein (10 pmol She2p). After 15 min of incubation on ice, the binding mixture was then layered over a 400-μl sucrose cushion (1.2 m sucrose in flotation buffer). Subsequent to centrifugation (60 min at 530,000 × g and 4 °C), 200 μl of the supernatant and of the bottom fraction were collected. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of binding assay buffer, and all samples were TCA-precipitated, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted using antibodies against GST, maltose binding protein, She2p, Sec61p, OM45p, and Mcr1p. Liposomes were prepared from lipid mixtures as described (35.Qbadou S. Tien R. Soll J. Schleiff E. Membrane insertion of the chloroplast outer envelope protein, Toc34. Constrains for insertion and topology.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For most binding studies, including analysis of liposome size dependence, a phospholipid extract from soybeans was used (Sigma) that contains as main phospholipids 55% phosphatidylcholine (PC) and 25% phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). To investigate the influence of lipid headgroup packing, increasing amounts of DOPC (1,2-di-(9Z-octadecenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) were added to yield final concentrations of 20% or 40% DOPC in the lipid mixture. To compare protein binding to liposomes with or without phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), a lipid mixture resembling lipid composition of the yeast ER (36.Tuller G. Nemec T.

Lipids were dissolved in chloroform, and organic solvent was removed by evaporation under an N2 atmosphere. Lipids were completely dissolved to a final total lipid concentration of 10 mg/ml in degassed liposome buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 100 mm NaCl), and the emulsion was passed 21 times through a polycarbonate filter membrane mounted in a mini extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids) to create unilamellar liposomes. Liposomes with different diameters were generated using filter membranes with 30-nm, 80-nm, 200-nm, or 400-nm pore size. Liposome size distribution was verified by dynamic light scattering in a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments). Liposomes were used immediately for flotation assays or stored at 4 °C for a maximum of 1 week. 50 μl of liposomes were mixed with 50 pmol She2p, GST, MBP-Mim1p, or OM45p in 190 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Hepes/KOH, 150 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT) and incubated for 15 min on ice. 40 μl of the sample were kept as input control. 200 μl were mixed with 3 ml of binding buffer containing 70% sucrose and added to the bottom of a SW40 polycarbonate tube. The sample was then covered with three cushions of 3 ml of binding buffer containing 50, 40, and 0% sucrose. After centrifugation to equilibrium (70,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C), the liposome-containing interface between the 40 and 0% sucrose cushions was harvested, precipitated by TCA, and dissolved in 45 μl of SDS sample buffer. Flotation samples and input controls were analyzed as described above. She2p signals were analyzed densitometrically using ImageJ. For the RNA competition assay, She2p was preincubated with 500 pmol (10× excess) or 1 nmol (20× excess) of in vitro-transcribed ASH1 E3 localization element (28.Müller M. Richter K. Heuck A. Kremmer E. Buchner J. Jansen R.-P. Niessing D. Formation of She2p tetramers is required for mRNA binding, mRNP assembly, and localization.RNA. 2009; 15: 2002-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) for 15 min at room temperature and 10 min on ice in binding buffer containing RNasin. Subsequently, liposomes were added, and the mixture was treated as described above. Input control and flotation samples were either processed for Western blot analysis or phenol/chloroform-extracted for RNA recovery. After ethanol precipitation, RNA was resuspended in 25 μl of Tris/EDTA (pH 7.5) and applied to 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Yeast cells were scraped from a fresh selective plate, resuspended in 2 ml of synthetic complete medium, grown for 3–4 h at 30 °C, dropped onto a thin agarose layer of synthetic complete medium, and covered with a coverslip. Images were captured as image stacks on a Zeiss AxioObserver.Z1 fluorescence microscope operated by AxioVision software (Zeiss) and deconvolved using the same software package. Imaging data were analyzed using AxioVision Rel 4.8. Because localization of mRNAs such as WSC2 depends on functional cER segregation but is independent of cotranslational targeting (18.Fundakowski J. Hermesh O. Jansen R.-P. Localization of a subset of yeast mRNAs depends on inheritance of endoplasmic reticulum.Traffic. 2012; 13: 1642-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), localization might require mRNA attachment to the ER via RNA-binding proteins like its cognate partner She2p. We have demonstrated previously that a fraction of She2p comigrates with ER-derived membranes (microsomes) in sucrose gradient centrifugation (19.Schmid M. Jaedicke A. Du T.-G. Jansen R.-P.

https://openalex.org/W2050652817,"Memo is a widely expressed 33-kDa protein required for heregulin (HRG)-, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-induced cell motility. Studies in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, wild-type or knockout for Memo, were performed to further investigate the role of Memo downstream of FGFR. We demonstrated that Memo associates with the FGFR signalosome and is necessary for optimal activation of signaling. To uncover Memo's physiological role, Memo conditional-knockout mice were generated. These animals showed a reduced life span, increased insulin sensitivity, small stature, graying hair, alopecia, kyphosis, loss of subcutaneous fat, and loss of spermatozoa in the epididymis. Memo-knockout mice also have elevated serum levels of active vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D), and calcium compared to control littermates expressing Memo. In summary, the results from in vivo and in vitro models support the hypothesis that Memo is a novel regulator of FGFR signaling with a role in controlling 1,25(OH)2D production and normal calcium homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2015457839,"Dragon is one of the three members of the repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) family, i.e. RGMa, RGMb (Dragon), and RGMc (hemojuvelin). We previously identified the RGM members as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) co-receptors that enhance BMP signaling. Our previous studies found that Dragon is highly expressed in the tubular epithelial cells of mouse kidneys. However, the roles of Dragon in renal epithelial cells are yet to be defined. We now show that overexpression of Dragon increased cell death induced by hypoxia in association with increased cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and cleaved caspase-3 levels in mouse inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD3) cells. Dragon also inhibited E-cadherin expression but did not affect epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition induced by TGF-β in IMCD3 cells. Previous studies suggest that the three RGM members can function as ligands for the receptor neogenin. Interestingly, our present study demonstrates that the Dragon actions on apoptosis and E-cadherin expression in IMCD3 cells were mediated by the neogenin receptor but not through the BMP pathway. Dragon expression in the kidney was up-regulated by unilateral ureteral obstruction in mice. Compared with wild-type mice, heterozygous Dragon knock-out mice exhibited 45-66% reduction in Dragon mRNA expression, decreased epithelial apoptosis, and increased tubular E-cadherin expression and had attenuated tubular injury after unilateral ureteral obstruction. Our results suggest that Dragon may impair tubular epithelial integrity and induce epithelial apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2036108407,"The exact molecular mechanisms governing articular chondrocytes remain unknown in skeletal biology. In this study, we have found that ESET (an ERG-associated protein with a SET domain, also called SETDB1) histone methyltransferase is expressed in articular cartilage. To test whether ESET regulates articular chondrocytes, we carried out mesenchyme-specific deletion of the ESET gene in mice. ESET knock-out did not affect generation of articular chondrocytes during embryonic development. Two weeks after birth, there was minimal qualitative difference at the knee joints between wild-type and ESET knock-out animals. At 1 month, ectopic hypertrophy, proliferation, and apoptosis of articular chondrocytes were seen in the articular cartilage of ESET-null animals. At 3 months, additional signs of terminal differentiation such as increased alkaline phosphatase activity and an elevated level of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13 were found in ESET-null cartilage. Staining for type II collagen and proteoglycan revealed that cartilage degeneration became progressively worse from 2 weeks to 12 months at the knee joints of ESET knock-out mutants. Analysis of over 14 pairs of age- and sex-matched wild-type and knock-out mice indicated that the articular chondrocyte phenotype in ESET-null mutants is 100% penetrant. Our results demonstrate that expression of ESET plays an essential role in the maintenance of articular cartilage by preventing articular chondrocytes from terminal differentiation and may have implications in joint diseases such as osteoarthritis."

Membrane TWEAK is processed by a protease of the furin family resulting in a soluble ligand containing the THD.

The Fn14 receptor contains a single cysteine-rich domain (CRD) in the extracellular ligand-binding region and a short cytoplasmic tail possessing a single TNFR-associated factor-binding site (1.Wiley S.R.

Site-directed mutagenesis has demonstrated that TWEAK binding to the Fn14 CRD requires evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues (Asp45, Lys48, and Met50) and all three of the predicted disulfide bonds (10.Brown S.A.

Optimal TWEAK-mediated activation of Fn14 is important for promoting productive tissue responses after injury, but excessive TWEAK-Fn14 activation can induce pathological tissue responses, leading to progressive damage and degradation (11.Burkly L.C.

In glioblastoma, Fn14 mRNA and protein expression are unregulated in migratory cells in vitro and invading cells in vivo (17.Tran N.L. McDonough W.S. Savitch B.A. Fortin S.P. Winkles J.A. Symons M.

Fn14 expression increases with increasing tumor grade with the highest expression observed in glioblastoma multiforme (grade IV). In contrast, the expression of Fn14 is minimal to absent in normal brain tissue. Moreover, TWEAK binding to Fn14 triggers glioma cell invasion and survival (17.Tran N.L. McDonough W.S.

TWEAK-Fn14 signaling plays a key role in various disease states and therefore holds significant therapeutic potential as a novel molecular target for developing anti-cancer and anti-autoimmune therapeutic agents in humans. It has been shown that this interaction plays a pivotal role in various immunological conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, renal injury, ischemic stroke, as well as cardiac dysfunction and failure (18.Burkly L.C.

Several studies have confirmed the therapeutic potential of this pathway in human esophageal and pancreatic cancers (21.Yoriki R. Akashi S. Sho M. Nomi T. Yamato I. Hotta K. Takayama T. Matsumoto S.

Schiffer L. Michaelson J.S. Putterman C. Proinflammatory effects of TWEAK/Fn14 interactions in glomerular mesangial cells.J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 1889-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The ever increasing knowledge and data on various downstream reactions stimulated by TWEAK-Fn14 interaction has recently been compiled into a complete repository (25.Bhattacharjee M. Raju R. Radhakrishnan A. Nanjappa V. Muthusamy B. Singh K. Kuppusamy D. Lingala B.T. Pan A. Mathur P.P. Harsha H.C. Prasad T.S. Atkins G.J. Pandey A. Chatterjee A. A bioinformatics resource for TWEAK-Fn14 signaling pathway.J. Signal Transduct. 2012; 2012: 376470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This paves the way for identification of yet unknown components of the signaling pathways. To date, there are five anti-TNF antibody-based drugs already on the market, and 16 out of ∼22 ligand/receptor pairs under clinical development, constituting one of the most successful classes of biological therapeutics (26.Tansey M.G. Szymkowski D.E. The TNF superfamily in 2009: new pathways, new indications, and new drugs.Drug Discov. Today. 2009; 14: 1082-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These protein-based therapeutics have some notable disadvantages, including problems associated with drug delivery, stability, and cost. However, very few small molecule inhibitors targeting TNFR family members have been identified. Known small molecule inhibitors for the TNFR family act by disrupting trimerization of their respective ligands, as is the case for TNFα (27.He M.M. Smith A.S. Oslob J.D. Flanagan W.M. Braisted A.C. Whitty A. Cancilla M.T. Wang J. Lugovskoy A.A. Yoburn J.C. Fung A.D. Farrington G. Eldredge J.K. Day E.S. Cruz L.A. Cachero T.G. Miller S.K. Friedman J.E. Choong I.C. Cunningham B.C. Small-molecule inhibition of TNF-α.Science. 2005; 310: 1022-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and CD40 (28.Silvian L.F. Friedman J.E. Strauch K. Cachero T.G. Day E.S. Qian F. Cunningham B. Fung A. Sun L. Shipps G.W. Su L. Zheng Z. Kumaravel G. Whitty A. Small molecule inhibition of the TNF family cytokine CD40 ligand through a subunit fracture mechanism.ACS Chem. Biol. 2011; 6: 636-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Benicchi et al. (29.Benicchi T. Iozzi S. Svahn A. Axelsson H. Mori E. Bernocco S. Cappelli F. Caramelli C. Fanti P. Genesio E. Maccari L. Markova N. Micco I. Porcari V. Schultz J. Fecke W. A homogeneous HTRF assay for the identification of inhibitors of the TWEAK-Fn14 protein interaction.J. Biomol. Screen. 2012; 17: 933-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) have also focused on the development of a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence assay for identification of small molecule inhibitors for the TWEAK-Fn14 interaction and reported the identification of hits at a rate of 0.007%. Currently, the potential therapeutic benefit of inhibiting key nodes of the TWEAK-Fn14 signaling pathway remains unclear and untapped due to the absence of small molecule tools to interrogate this pathway. In this study, we initiated the discovery of small molecules targeting the TWEAK-Fn14 pathway by determining the molecular basis of the interaction between TWEAK and Fn14 and elucidating key structural elements of this interaction. The ultimate goal of this work is to employ the structural information on TWEAK-Fn14 binding to identify potential inhibitors of this interaction. The importance of the Fn14 CRD has been established utilizing an NMR solution structure of this domain and functional mutation studies (10.Brown S.A. Hanscom H.N. Vu H. Brew S.A. Winkles J.A. TWEAK binding to the Fn14 cysteine-rich domain depends on charged residues located in both the A1 and D2 modules.Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To further characterize the TWEAK-Fn14 interaction, six structural models of TWEAK were built based on experimental structures of low homology templates from the TNF superfamily. Protein-protein docking, followed by data-driven prioritization, yielded two promising TWEAK-Fn14 binding hypotheses. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed one hypothesis providing a structural basis for target-based identification of small molecule inhibitors of the TWEAK-FN14 interaction. Validated models served as a basis for in silico library design. A targeted library of molecules was assembled and screened iteratively, leading to enrichment in activity for compounds with similar scaffolds. These results support the TWEAK-Fn14 interaction as a target of interest for the treatment of cancer, including glioblastoma and other deadly diseases. The templates for homology modeling were selected from the RCSB PDB database (30.Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. The Protein Data Bank.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27327) Google Scholar). Consensus alignment based on three-dimensional structures was performed in MOE to obtain a structure-derived sequence alignment (version 2010.10, Chemical Computing Group Inc.) (31.Molecular Operating Environment Molecular Operating Environment. Chemical Computing Group Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada2010Google Scholar). All template structures were superimposed in three dimensions, with an initial main-chain atom root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 2.49 Å. In the corresponding sequence alignment, a consensus set of residues was defined based on two criteria as follows: 1) residue identity, retaining those residues with at least 50% of sequence identity per alignment column; and 2) r.m.s.d. of main-chain atoms. The former parameter was kept fixed, and the latter parameter was decremented, starting at the initial value of 2.49 Å and decreasing by increments of 0.5 Å until reaching 1 Å. At each step, the structural superimposition of the proteins was refined using only the consensus residues, and the sequence alignment was subsequently refined to reflect the structural alignment changes. The resulting sequence alignment was utilized as a fixed template to align the sequence of TWEAK. Homology modeling was performed using MOE with the options of disabling C- and N-terminal outgap modeling and enabling automatic disulfide bond detection. A maximum of 10 intermediate models were created. Model refinement was performed at a medium setting for both intermediate and final models. AMBER99 forcefield was used for all energy minimizations, and the GB/VI scoring method was used for model scoring. One final refined model was created per template. Protein-protein docking simulations were performed using well vetted methodologies implemented in ICM Pro Version 3.7–2b (2012), MolSoft LLC (32.Abagyan R. Totrov M. Kuznetsov D. ICM–A new method for protein modeling and design: Applications to docking and structure prediction from the distorted native conformation.J. Comput. Chem. 1994; 15: 488-506Crossref Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). The epitopes were selected on the basis of available biological knowledge of the interacting interfaces from April-TACI (PDB code 1XU1) and April-BCMA (PDB code 1XU2) complexes and knowledge from Fn14 residues required for binding, as established by Winkles and co-workers (10.Brown S.A. Hanscom H.N. Vu H. Brew S.A. Winkles J.A. TWEAK binding to the Fn14 cysteine-rich domain depends on charged residues located in both the A1 and D2 modules.Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For the receptor protein, pre-calculated grid maps were generated involving van der Waals, electrostatic, and desolvation terms using ECEPP/3 molecular mechanics force field (33.Nemethy G. Gibson K.D. Palmer K.A. Yoon C.N. Paterlini G. Zagari A. Rumsey S. Scheraga H.A. Energy parameters in polypeptides. 10. Improved geometrical parameters and nonbonded interactions for use in the ECEPP/3 algorithm, with application to proline-containing peptides.J. Phys. Chem. 1992; 96: 6472-6484Crossref Scopus (633) Google Scholar). For the ligand protein, a number of starting conformations were sampled and optimized using a pseudo-Brownian Monte-Carlo-based method, followed by local energy minimizations (32.Abagyan R. Totrov M. Kuznetsov D. ICM–A new method for protein modeling and design: Applications to docking and structure prediction from the distorted native conformation.J. Comput. Chem. 1994; 15: 488-506Crossref Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). All the conformations accumulated were merged into a single conformational set compressed by comparison of the atomic coordinates and removal of geometrically similar conformations. The resulting conformations were further optimized by allowing flexibility of the ligand side chains. The interaction energy function uses the internal energy of the ligand and intermolecular energy based on the optimized potential maps. The multiple levels of optimization performed in this approach reduce the possibility of being trapped in local minima. A single docking run was performed for each receptor-ligand complex, and 30–40 poses were obtained for each individual docking run. The peptidomimetic set of ChemDiv (version of May 2011; 13,137 compounds) was prepared using LigPrep version 2.5 in Schrodinger Version 2011 (Schrodinger LLC, New York) by adding hydrogen atoms and calculating protonation states corresponding to pH 7.4. This resulted in generation of 21,682 structures. A conformational search was performed using ConfGen Standard search (default parameters), with ConfGen Version 2.3 in Schrodinger (34.Watts K.S. Dalal P. Murphy R.B. Sherman W. Friesner R.A. Shelley J.C. ConfGen: a conformational search method for efficient generation of bioactive conformers.J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2010; 50: 534-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), generating a database of 145,995 conformations. Receptor-based pharmacophore generation was performed using Phase version 3.4 implemented in Maestro 9.3 of Schrodinger suite Version 2011 (35.Dixon S.L. Smondyrev A.M. Rao S.N. PHASE: a novel approach to pharmacophore modeling and 3D database searching.Chem. Biol. Drug Des. 2006; 67: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The ligand was defined as the ensemble of TWEAK residues involved in inter-molecular interactions with Fn14. The pharmacophore features were then identified exhaustively for these interacting residues. The features that were not located at the direct protein-protein interaction interface were manually removed. Excluded volumes were included to capture the Fn14 receptor geometry when preparing the pharmacophore model; these were calculated using a scaling factor of 0.9. The conformational ligand database was interrogated for hits matching the generated pharmacophore hypothesis. Pharmacophoric points involving the TWEAK anchoring residue were required, and matching of other pharmacophoric points was set as optional. The protein preparation workflow of Maestro 9.3, Version 2011, was employed to prepare the Fn14 receptor by adding missing H-atoms and refining the structure using default parameters. A grid-enclosing box was centered at the centroid of the three binding site residues involved in TWEAK binding as indicated by mutation data from Winkles and co-workers (10.Brown S.A. Hanscom H.N. Vu H. Brew S.A. Winkles J.A. TWEAK binding to the Fn14 cysteine-rich domain depends on charged residues located in both the A1 and D2 modules.Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), i.e. Asp45, Lys48, and Asp62. Structure-based virtual screening was performed with the conformational ligand database, and the ligands were kept flexible during the docking stage. A three-step docking process was executed as follows. 1) A first parsing was performed by docking of compounds with the fastest HTVS algorithm of Glide (Version 2011, Schrodinger LLC) (36.Friesner R.A. Banks J.L. Murphy R.B. Halgren T.A. Klicic J.J. Mainz D.T. Repasky M.P. Knoll E.H. Shelley M. Perry J.K. Shaw D.E. Francis P. Shenkin P.S. Glide: a new approach for rapid, accurate docking and scoring. 1. Method and assessment of docking accuracy.J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 1739-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (6228) Google Scholar) and scoring of compounds. 2) The top 50% of the virtual hits from step 1 were docked using the standard precision algorithm of Glide and were subsequently scored. 3) Lastly, 10% of the top scoring compounds of step 2 were re-docked using XP algorithm, scored, and considered as hits. The human astrocytoma cell line T98G and human HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For assays involving TWEAK treatment, cells were cultured in reduced serum (0.5% FBS) for 16 h prior to TWEAK stimulation. The coding sequence for the soluble form of TWEAK, designated sTWEAK, encoding amino acids Lys97–His249 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and ligated in-frame either downstream of a 3× FLAG epitope in p3×FLAG-CMV (Sigma) or upstream of a 3× HA epitope in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The sTWEAK Y176D, Y176A, Y176F, and W231G variants were generated using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All substitutions were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Expression constructs for in vitro transcription were generated using Gateway Technology (Invitrogen). The coding sequences for sTWEAK and sTWEAK variants were first amplified by polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotide primers containing the appropriate aatB recombination sequences and the aatB-flanked PCR products transferred to the ent"
https://openalex.org/W2082997720,"OsCaM61 is one of five calmodulins known to be present in Oryza sativa that relays the increase of cytosolic [Ca(2+)] to downstream targets. OsCaM61 bears a unique C-terminal extension with a prenylation site. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy we studied the behavior of the calmodulin (CaM) domain and the C-terminal extension of OsCaM61 in the absence and presence of Ca(2+). NMR dynamics data for OsCaM61 indicate that the two lobes of the CaM domain act together unlike the independent behavior of the lobes seen in mammalian CaM and soybean CaM4. Also, data demonstrate that the positively charged nuclear localization signal region in the tail in apo-OsCaM61 is helical, whereas it becomes flexible in the Ca(2+)-saturated protein. The extra helix in apo-OsCaM61 provides additional interactions in the C-lobe and increases the structural stability of the closed apo conformation. This leads to a decrease in the Ca(2+) binding affinity of EF-hands III and IV in OsCaM61. In Ca(2+)-OsCaM61, the basic nuclear localization signal cluster adopts an extended conformation, exposing the C-terminal extension for prenylation or enabling OsCaM61 to be transferred to the nucleus. Moreover, Ser(172) and Ala(173), residues in the tail, interact with different regions of the protein. These interactions affect the ability of OsCaM61 to activate different target proteins. Altogether, our data show that the tail is not simply a linker between the prenyl group and the protein but that it also provides a new regulatory mechanism that some plants have developed to fine-tune Ca(2+) signaling events."
