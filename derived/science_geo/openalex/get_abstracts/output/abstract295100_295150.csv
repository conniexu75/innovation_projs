https://openalex.org/W1986095510,"Pneumonia contributes to between 750 000 and 1.2 million neonatal deaths and an unknown number of stillbirths each year world wide. The aetiology depends on time of onset. Gram negative bacilli predominate in the first week of life, and Gram positive bacteria after that. Streptococcus pneumoniae probably causes about 25% of neonatal pneumonia. Interventions that would reduce mortality from this condition would have a large range of beneficial effects: improved maternal health, better management of other common neonatal conditions, and reduced long term childhood and adult morbidity."

https://openalex.org/W2064069839,"Abstract Chain scission during the oxidation of polymeric 1,5-dirnethyl-l,5-dienes occurs nearly quantitatively through the scission of an unusual peroxidic intermediate, followed ultimately by evolution of a group of fragments of low molecular weight at each scission. The composition of this group depends on the reaction conditions. The first known stable intermediates to be formed subsequent to scission are levulinaldehyde and formaldehyde: Bolland's kinetic and analytic studies combined with the requirements of the observed stoichiometry of scission form the basis on which it is possible to write a detailed mechanism for the transformation represented by Equation 1. Nothing is known in detail of the sequence of reactions resulting in Equation 2. It has been suggested that scission is associated with propagation rather than initiation—that is, with decomposition of a peroxy radical rather than of a hydroperoxide as is indicated in this scheme. This is still a moot point. It is now known, for example, th..."

https://openalex.org/W1966759298,"In the present article three distinct methods will be given to show that the penetrating radiation which produces part of the ionization in closed vessels is not due to γ rays from radium in the ground itself. It seems quite probable that the penetrating radiation must be due to radioactive products in the air and it is quite probable that the origin of these products is in the ground as Elster and Geitel's theory indicates.

The first method is based upon the radium content of the various rocks as analyzed by Strutt and Eve. The highest value for the radium content of sedimentary rocks was found to be 2.92 (10)−12 grams of radium per gram of rock. The mean value found by Strutt for sedimentary rocks was 1.1 (10)−12 grams and by Eve 0.8 (10)−12 gram. The value of the radium content varies greatly with the locality, but for surface soils which are subjected to all the various kinds of weather changes the radium content is probably smaller than that found above. For instance Strutt found a radium content for chalk at the bottom of a cliff to be 0.39 (10)−12 gram and at the top of the same cliff 0.12 (10)−12 gram."
