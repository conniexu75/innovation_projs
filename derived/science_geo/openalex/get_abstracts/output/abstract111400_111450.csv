https://openalex.org/W2081758458,"Mutations in the human APC gene are linked to familial adenomatous polyposis and to the progression of sporadic colorectal and gastric tumors. To gain insight into APC function, APC-associated proteins were identified by immunoprecipitation experiments. Antibodies to APC precipitated a 95-kilodalton protein that was purified and identified by sequencing as β-catenin, a protein that binds to the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin. An antibody specific to β-catenin also recognized the 95-kilodalton protein in the immunoprecipitates. These results suggest that APC is involved in cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W1967243795,"Mutations of APC appear to initiate sporadic and inherited forms of human colorectal cancer. Although these mutations have been well characterized, little is known about the function of the APC gene product. Two cellular proteins that associate with APC were identified by nucleotide sequence analysis and peptide mapping as the E-cadherin-associated proteins α- and β-catenin. A 27-residue fragment of APC containing a 15-amino acid repeat was sufficient for the interaction with the catenins. These results suggest an important link between tumor initiation and cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2154181923,"A subset of sporadic colorectal tumors and most tumors developing in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer patients display frequent alterations in microsatellite sequences. Such tumors have been thought to manifest replication errors (RER+), but the basis for the alterations has remained conjectural. We demonstrate that the mutation rate of (CA)n repeats in RER+ tumor cells is at least 100-fold that in RER- tumor cells and show by in vitro assay that increased mutability of RER+ cells is associated with a profound defect in strand-specific mismatch repair. This deficiency was observed with microsatellite heteroduplexes as well as with heteroduplexes containing single base-base mismatches and affected an early step in the repair pathway. Thus, a true mutator phenotype exists in a subset of tumor cells, the responsible defect is likely to cause transitions and transversions in addition to microsatellite alterations, and a biochemical basis for this phenotype has been identified."

https://openalex.org/W1973916539,"Specific recognition and pairing of the 5' and 3' splice sites are critical steps in pre-mRNA splicing. We report that the splicing factors SC35 and SF2/ASF specifically interact with both the integral U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP U1-70K) and with the 35 kd subunit of the splicing factor U2AF (U2AF35). Previous studies indicated that the U1 snRNP binds specifically to the 5' splice site, while U2AF35-U2AF65 heterodimer binds to the 3' splice site. Together, these observations suggest that SC35 and other members of the SR family of splicing factors may function in splice site selection by acting as a bridge between components bound to the 5' and 3' splice sites. Interestingly, SC35, SF2/ASF, and U2AF35 also interact with the Drosophila splicing regulators Transformer (Tra) and Transformer-2 (Tra2), suggesting that protein-protein interactions mediated by SR proteins may also play an important role in regulating alternative splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2014059004,"A general strategy is described for the de novo design of proteins. In this strategy the sequence locations of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues were specified explicitly, but the precise identities of the side chains were not constrained and varied extensively. This strategy was tested by constructing a large collection of synthetic genes whose protein products were designed to fold into four-helix bundle proteins. Each gene encoded a different amino acid sequence, but all sequences shared the same pattern of polar and nonpolar residues. Characterization of the expressed proteins indicated that most of the designed sequences folded into compact α-helical structures. Thus, a simple binary code of polar and nonpolar residues arranged in the appropriate order can drive polypeptide chains to collapse into globular α-helical folds."

https://openalex.org/W2074204387,"Transmission of an external signal from receptors to downstream targets is often mediated by a conserved set of protein kinases that act in sequence (a kinase cascade). In haploid strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a signal initiated by peptide pheromones is transmitted through this kinase cascade to a transcription factor STE12, which is required for the expression of many mating-specific genes. Here it was shown that in diploids some of the same kinases and STE12 are required for filamentous growth, but the pheromone receptors and guanosine triphosphate-binding protein are not required for filament formation. Thus, a similar kinase cascade is activated by different signals in haploids and diploids and mediates different developmental outcomes in the two cell types."

https://openalex.org/W2045739426,"We present the first isolation of the terminal DNA of an intact Drosophila telomere. It differs from those isolated from other eukaryotes by the lack of short tandem repeats at the terminus. The terminal 14.5 kb is composed of four tandem elements derived from two families of non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons and is subject to slow terminal loss. One of these transposon families, TART (telomere-associated retrotransposon), is described for the first time here. The other element, HeT-A, has previously been shown to transpose to broken chromosome ends. Our results provide key evidence that these elements also transpose to natural chromosome ends. We propose that the telomere-associated repetitive DNA is maintained by saltatory expansions, including terminal transpositions of specialized retrotransposons, which serve to balance terminal loss."
https://openalex.org/W2029684104,"Disulfide bonds are rarely found in cytoplasmic proteins. Mutations were selected for in Escherichia coli that allow disulfide bond formation in the cytoplasm. In the presence of these mutations, export-defective versions of alkaline phosphatase and mouse urokinase were able to fold into their enzymatically active conformations in the cytoplasm because their disulfide bonds were formed. The mutations were mapped to the gene for thioredoxin reductase and diminish or eliminate the activity of this enzyme. Thioredoxin itself was found to be unnecessary for this disulfide bond formation. Thioredoxin reductase, but not thioredoxin, is thus implicated in keeping cysteines reduced in cytoplasmic proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1559792721,"Peroxisome proliferators are postulated to elicit predictable pleiotropic responses in the liver by activating a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR). PPARs from mouse liver (mPPAR), rat liver (rPPAR), and Xenopus liver (xPPAR gamma) have been cloned recently. We now report the cloning of a new member from mouse liver which we designate mPPAR gamma. mPPAR gamma cDNA contained an open reading frame encoding a 475-amino acid protein exhibiting 75% amino acid similarity to xPPAR gamma, while it showed only 55% identity with mPPAR. The ligand-binding and DNA-binding domains are best conserved between mPPAR gamma, mPPAR, and xPPAR gamma. Like rPPAR, mPPAR gamma is able to impart peroxisome proliferator responsiveness to the promoter of peroxisomal bifunctional gene, which encodes the second enzyme of the peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation system. Northern blot analysis revealed high expression of mPPAR gamma gene in mouse liver, kidney, and heart and low expression in the lung, testis, brain, skeletal muscle, and spleen. In mice treated with ciprofibrate, a peroxisome proliferator, a 2-fold increase in mPPAR gamma mRNA was observed in the liver and kidney. The presence of two PPARs in the mouse liver suggests the possibility of multiple signaling pathways for the peroxisome proliferator-induced pleiotropic responses."

https://openalex.org/W2059535670,"DNA damage induces the expression of many genes proposed to enhance DNA repair capacities. We investigated the mechanism by which DNA damage induces transcription of RNR3, a subunit of ribonucleotide reductase. Five complementation groups of DNA-damage uninducible (dun) mutants were identified. Each is sensitive to DNA damage. dun1 mutants are also defective for RNR1 and RNR2 induction but are proficient for induction of other genes, defining the existence of at least two distinct DNA damage induction pathways. DUN1 encodes a nuclear protein kinase that is also a phosphoprotein. Phosphorylation of Dun1 increases in response to DNA damage in a Dun1-dependent manner, suggesting an increase in autophosphorylation activity. These results establish the existence of a eukaryotic SOS response regulated by protein phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W2058100090,"Neurotransmitter receptors alter membrane excitability and synaptic efficacy by generating intracellular signals that ultimately change the properties of ion channels. Through expression studies in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells, we found that the G protein-coupled m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor potently suppresses a cloned delayed rectifier K+ channel through a pathway involving phospholipase C activation and direct tyrosine phosphorylation of the K+ channel. Furthermore, analysis of neuroblastoma cells revealed that a similar tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway links endogenous G protein-coupled receptors to suppression of the native RAK channel. These results suggest a novel mechanism by which neurotransmitters and hormones may regulate a specific type of K+ channel that is widely expressed in the mammalian brain and heart."

https://openalex.org/W2058054032,"The assemblage of protein multilayers induced by molecular recognition, as seen, for example, in the immune cascade, has been mimicked by using streptavidin as a docking matrix. For these experiments, this protein matrix was organized on liposomes, monolayers at the air-water interface, and self-assembled layers on gold, all three containing biotin lipids. The docking of streptavidin to biotin at liposomal surfaces was confirmed by circular dichroism. Mixed double and triple layers of streptavidin, concanavalin A, antibody Fab fragments, and hormones are prepared at the air-water interface and on gold surfaces and were characterized by fluorescence microscopy and plasmon spectroscopy. With the use of biotin analogs that have lower binding constants it has been possible to achieve multiple formation and competitive replacement of the oriented protein assemblages."
https://openalex.org/W1986908628,"We have previously shown that the DNA of the unicellular eukaryote T. brucei contains about 0.1% of a novel modified base, called J. The presence of J correlates with a DNA modification associated with the silencing of telomeric expression sites for the variant surface antigens of trypanosomes. Here we show that J is 5-((beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-methyl)-uracil (shortened to beta-D-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil), a base not previously found in DNA. We discuss putative pathways for the introduction of this base modification at specific positions in the DNA and the possible contribution of this modification to repression of surface antigen gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1511192707,"Receptor-mediated activation of human platelets by thrombin initiates a series of rapid biochemical events that include activation of phospholipase A2 to liberate arachidonic acid for further conversion to thromboxane A2. The identity of the phospholipase A2 involved has not been clear. Here we show by immunochemical analysis that human platelets contain significant amounts (60 ng/10(9) platelets) of the recently identified Ca(2+)-sensitive cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). Metabolic labeling of human platelets with 33Pi revealed that the extent of phosphorylation of cPLA2 was greatly increased after thrombin treatment. Upon stimulation of platelets with thrombin, cPLA2 exhibits enhanced catalytic activity, as well as a change in its electrophoretic and chromatographic properties compared with cPLA2 in resting platelets. These alterations of cPLA2 are reversed by treatment with phosphatase, demonstrating that they are the consequence of thrombin-stimulated phosphorylation. Thrombin-induced phosphorylation and activation of cPLA2 is rapid (half-maximal by 1 min at 1 unit/10(9) platelets) and dose-dependent. Agonist-induced phosphorylation of cPLA2 is more sensitive to thrombin than the generation of thromboxane A2, suggesting that it may be an early event in the sequence of steps leading to the mobilization and further metabolism of arachidonic acid. By comparing the functional properties of cPLA2 from control versus thrombin-stimulated platelets, we found that while activated cPLA2 exhibits the same Ca2+ requirement and apparent substrate affinity (Km), its catalytic activity (Vmax) is increased compared with control cPLA2. We conclude that 1) cPLA2 is likely to play an important role in agonist-induced mobilization of arachidonic acid and 2) thrombin elicits rapid and full activation of cPLA2 not only by promoting a rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ but also by inducing phosphorylation of cPLA2 thereby improving its catalytic activity."

https://openalex.org/W1978072288,"To understand better how the packing of side chains within the core influences protein structure and stability, the crystal structures were determined for eight variants of T4 lysozyme, each of which contains three to five substitutions at adjacent interior sites. Concerted main-chain and side-chain displacements, with movements of helical segments as large as 0.8 angstrom, were observed. In contrast, the angular conformations of the mutated side chains tended to remain unchanged, with torsion angles within 20 degrees of those in the wild-type structure. These observations suggest that not only the rotation of side chains but also movements of the main chain must be considered in the evaluation of which amino acid sequences are compatible with a given protein fold."
https://openalex.org/W2023109256,"Cytosine methylation has been implicated in epigenetic control of gene expression in animals, plants, and fungi. It has been assumed that all methylation in eukaryotes is at symmetrical sequences such as CpG/GpC, because this can explain perpetuation of methylation states. Here the bisulfite genomic sequencing method was used to examine methylation in DNA from a Neurospora gene exposed to repeat-induced point mutation. 5-Methylcytosine was not limited to symmetrical sites and individual molecules showed different patterns and amounts of modification. The methylation extended beyond the mutated region and even beyond the edge of the duplicated segment."

https://openalex.org/W1974654218,"Replication of eukaryotic chromosomes involves initiation at origins spaced an average of 50 to 100 kilobase pairs. In yeast, potential origins can be recognized as autonomous replication sequences (ARSs) that allow maintenance of plasmids. However, there are more ARS elements than active chromosomal origins. The possibility was examined that close spacing of ARSs can lead to inactive origins. Two ARSs located 6.5 kilobase pairs apart can indeed interfere with each other. Replication is initiated from one or the other ARS with equal probability, but rarely (< 5%) from both ARSs on the same DNA molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1561376991,"A novel serine kinase, named nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) kinase, has been shown to be associated with the NF kappa B.I kappa B complex in the cytosol of human primary T lymphocytes. It activates the DNA binding activity of NF kappa B by directly phosphorylating its p65 and p50 subunits. There is no evidence that it phosphorylates I kappa B. Experiments with inhibitors and antisera showed that it is distinct from other known serine kinases such as mitogen-activated protein kinase or Mos. It has an apparent molecular size of 43 kDa determined by the substrate binding assay. This kinase might have a central role in mediating various signals to NF kappa B."
https://openalex.org/W1520976404,"Phosphoseryl/threonyl protein phosphatase inhibitors, viz. okadaic acid and calyculin-A, failed to induce nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) nuclear translocation in several primary human cells although a marked and rapid induction was observed in their simian virus 40 transformed counterparts. Inability to induce NF-kappa B cannot be due to a non-activatable system since NF-kappa B was strongly activated by tumor necrosis factor in all the five primary cell types tested. It is also unlikely that the differential induction was due to differential sensitivity of primary and transformed cells to phosphatase inhibitors as the intracellular phosphatase activities of both cell types were equally inhibited by these inhibitors. However, pretreatment with hydrogen peroxide or buthionine sulfoximine, chemicals known to directly or indirectly elevate the intracellular free-radical levels, enabled okadaic acid to induce nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B in primary cells. Conversely cysteine, an antioxidant and precursor of the free radical scavenger, glutathione, inhibited the induction of NF-kappa B by tumor necrosis factor in primary cells, and by okadaic acid or tumor necrosis factor in transformed cells. These data, taken together, suggest that free radical-dependent oxidation and protein phosphorylation are not independent modes of NF-kappa B induction, but are both required for the release of NF-kappa B from I kappa B. Furthermore, the differential induction of NF-kappa B nuclear translocation by okadaic acid in primary and transformed human cells, reported herein, reflects intrinsic differences in the intracellular oxidative state between the two groups of cells. The induction of NF-kappa B by tumor necrosis factor in primary cells suggests that this cytokine fulfills the requirement for oxidation, possibly by inducing the production of free radicals."

https://openalex.org/W1590820833,"The outer surface of the cells of the hyperthermophile Methanothermus fervidus is covered by crystalline glycoprotein subunits (S-layer). From the purified S-layer glycoprotein, a heterosaccharide was isolated. The heterosaccharide consists of D-3-O-methylmannose, D-mannose, and D-N-acetylgalactosamine in a molar ratio of 2:3:1 corresponding to a relative molecular mass of 1061.83 Da. 3-O-methylmannose could be partly replaced by 3-O-methylglucose. The primary structure of the glycan was revealed by methylation analysis, by plasma desorption mass spectrometry, and by high field NMR spectroscopy. The purified heterosaccharide is linked via N-acetylgalactosamine to an asparagine residue of the peptide moiety. The following structure is proposed for the heterosaccharide: alpha-D-3-O-MetManp-(1-->6)-alpha-D-3-O-MetManp-((1-->2)-alp ha-D-Manp)3-(1-->4) - D-GalNAc."
https://openalex.org/W1573063310,"We report that expansion of thioether biosynthesis in Escherichia coli generates sulfur-containing amino acids that can replace meso-diaminopimelate, the essential amino acid used for cross-linking the cell wall. This was accomplished by jointly overexpressing the metB gene coding for L-cystathionine gamma-synthase and disrupting the metC gene, whose product, L-cystathionine beta-lyase, is responsible for the destruction of L-cystathionine and other L-cysteine thioethers. As a result, meso-lanthionine and L-allo-cystathionine were produced endogenously and incorporated in the peptidoglycan, thereby enabling E. coli strains auxotrophic for diaminopimelate to grow in its absence. Thus, current techniques of metabolic engineering can be applied to evolving the chemical constitution of living cells beyond its present state."
https://openalex.org/W1592054362,"The effects of different levels of inorganic mercury (Hg2+) on depolarization- or agonist-stimulated Ca2+ signals were studied in PC12 cells. Exposure to 50-300 nM Hg2+ did not alter the resting cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), but enhanced the Ca2+ response to KCL-induced depolarization. Patch-clamp experiments revealed that these Hg2+ concentrations increased the voltage-dependent Ca2+ current through L-type channels. Also, Hg2+ treatment amplified the intracellular [Ca2+]i transients elicited by extracellular ATP. In contrast, the Ca2+ increase stimulated by bradykinin was unaffected. At slightly higher concentrations (1 to 2 microM), Hg2+ caused a sustained rise of the resting [Ca2+]i. This increase did not occur in Ca(2+)-free medium and was prevented by pretreatment with NiCl2 or with the L-type Ca2+ channel blockers, verapamil and nifedipine. Hg2+ did not mobilize Ca2+ from intracellular stores sensitive to thapsigargin, 2,5-di-(tert-butyl)-benzohydroquinone, or caffeine. At 2 microM, Hg2+ inhibited the [Ca2+]i transients elicited by bradykinin, ATP, or KCl-induced depolarization. The loss of the intracellular Ca2+ response to bradykinin was independent from the Ca2+ overload elicit by Hg2+; instead, it was associated with inhibition of polyphosphoinositide generation. Exposure to the lower Hg2+ concentrations (0.3-0.5 microM) greatly potentiated NGF-induced PC12 cell differentiation. Conversely, treatment with 2 microM Hg2+ caused cell death. Our results show that inorganic mercury has selective and different effects on Ca2+ signaling in PC12 cells depending on the concentration, within a narrow range."
https://openalex.org/W1585509587,"The regulation of the extramitochondrial fatty acid oxidation pathways located in the peroxisomes and the endoplasmic reticulum is not fully understood. Although both long-chain dicarboxylic fatty acids, which are poorly metabolized in hepatocytes, and non-beta-oxidizable fatty acid analogs induce peroxisomal beta-oxidation and liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) by a pretranslational mechanism, monocarboxylic long-chain fatty acids, which are rapidly esterified and oxidized, do not. To establish whether impaired utilization and, hence, sustained intracellular levels of monocarboxylic long-chain fatty acids increase their efficacy as inducers, the effect of oleic acid on cytochrome P-450 4A1, peroxisomal beta-oxidation, and L-FABP during inhibition of mitochondrial beta-oxidation was determined. In primary hepatocyte cultures, oleic acid had no inducing effect, but in the presence of 2-tetradecylglycidic acid (TDGA), an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, it induced P-450 4A1, peroxisomal beta-oxidation, and L-FABP pretranslationally. An increase in peroxisomal beta-oxidation was also noted in the presence of etomoxir, another inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I. Exposure of hepatocytes to TDGA for 1 h led to an expected decrease in incorporation of radiolabel from [1-14C]oleate into CO2 and water-soluble products. In contrast, long-term exposure to TDGA increased incorporation of [1-14C]oleate into oxidation products, most likely due to an adaptive induction of peroxisomal beta-oxidation. Both acute and long-term exposure of hepatocytes to TDGA decreased incorporation of oleic acid into triglycerides, an effect that may have contributed to the intracellular accumulation of fatty acids. These results provide support for a mechanism by which long-chain fatty acids or specific metabolites, including long-chain acyl-CoA esters and long-chain dicarboxylic acids, act as signals in the induction of P-450 4A1, peroxisomal beta-oxidation, and L-FABP under conditions in which long-chain fatty acids accumulate due to impaired entry into the mitochondrial beta-oxidation pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2090697468,"Maturation of nuclear pre-mRNAs in nematodes requires both cis- and trans-splicing. Both processing pathways involve analogous two-step phosphotransfer reactions and both are dependent upon the integrity of U6 snRNA. We have developed a functional reconstitution assay to assess the U6 snRNA sequence requirements for cis- and trans-splicing. Branch formation between the splicing substrates and U6 snRNA was observed. The frequency of this event was greatly enhanced when a highly conserved sequence in U6 snRNA was altered by mutation. In cis- and trans-splicing reactions reconstituted with this mutant U6 snRNA the liberated exon of U6 proceeded through the second step of splicing using the appropriate splice acceptor sites. These results demonstrate covalent interactions between a U snRNA required for splicing and a splicing substrate, and they provide evidence for an unexpected degree of catalytic flexibility within the spliceosome."
https://openalex.org/W1600760271,"Escherichia coli carrying the optional locus prr harbor a latent, tRNA(Lys)-specific anticodon nuclease, activated by the product of phage T4 stp. Anticodon nuclease latency is ascribed to the masking of prrC, implicated with the enzymatic activity, by flanking, type Ic DNA restriction modification genes (prrA, B&D-hsdM, S&R). Overexpression of plasmid-borne prrC elicited anticodon nuclease activity in uninfected E. coli. In vitro, the prr-C-coded core activity was indifferent to a synthetic Stp polypeptide, GTP, ATP, and endogenous DNA, effectors that synergistically activate the latent enzyme. Several facts suggested that PrrC is highly labile in the absence of the masking proteins. The core activity decayed with t1/2 below 1 min at 30 degrees C, and the PrrC portion of a fusion protein was unstable. Moreover, expression of prrC from its own promoter at low plasmid copy number did not allow detection of core activity. Yet, it sufficed for establishment of a latent, T4-inducible enzyme when complemented by the masking Hsd proteins, which were provided by another replicon. Interaction between the antagonistic components of latent anticodon nuclease was also demonstrated immunochemically. The coupling of anticodon nuclease with a DNA restriction modification system may serve to ward off its inadvertent toxicity and maintain it as an antiviral contingency."

Based on its hydropathy profile and the application of von Heijne's positive inside rule (von Heijne, G. (1992) J. Mol.

This model was tested by the creation of random beta-lactamase (Bla) fusions. The data from 33 unique, randomly generated, RhaT-Bla fusions and from 5 site-specific fusions supported the proposed topology between transmembrane helices 2-10. However, the localization of the putative first hydrophilic loop and the NH2 terminus was not possible because the beta-lactamase fusions in this region were shown to be unreliable indicators of the topology of RhaT."
