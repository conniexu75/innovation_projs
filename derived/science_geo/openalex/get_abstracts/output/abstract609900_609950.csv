https://openalex.org/W2802312498,"High-risk human papillomaviruses (hrHPVs) are the most prevalent viruses in human diseases including cervical cancers. Expression of E6 protein has already been reported in cervical cancer cases, excluding normal tissues. Continuous expression of E6 protein is making it ideal to develop therapeutic vaccines against hrHPVs infection and cervical cancer. Therefore, we carried out a meta-analysis of multiple hrHPVs to predict the most potential prophylactic peptide vaccines. In this study, immunoinformatics approach was employed to predict antigenic epitopes of hrHPVs E6 proteins restricted to 12 Human HLAs to aid the development of peptide vaccines against hrHPVs. Conformational B-cell and CTL epitopes were predicted for hrHPVs E6 proteins using ElliPro and NetCTL. The potential of the predicted peptides were tested and validated by using systems biology approach considering experimental concentration. We also investigated the binding interactions of the antigenic CTL epitopes by using docking. The stability of the resulting peptide-MHC I complexes was further studied by molecular dynamics simulations. The simulation results highlighted the regions from 46-62 and 65-76 that could be the first choice for the development of prophylactic peptide vaccines against hrHPVs. To overcome the worldwide distribution, the predicted epitopes restricted to different HLAs could cover most of the vaccination and would help to explore the possibility of these epitopes for adaptive immunotherapy against HPVs infections."
https://openalex.org/W2802121422,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Systems (UAV or UAS) have become increasingly popular in recent years for agricultural research applications. UAS are capable of acquiring images with high spatial and temporal resolutions that are ideal for applications in agriculture. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a UAS-based remote sensing system for quantification of crop growth parameters of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) including leaf area index (LAI), fractional vegetation cover (fc) and yield. The study was conducted at the Texas A&M Research Farm near College Station, Texas, United States. A fixed-wing UAS equipped with a multispectral sensor was used to collect image data during the 2016 growing season (April-October). Flight missions were successfully carried out at 50 days after planting (DAP; 25 May), 66 DAP (10 June) and 74 DAP (18 June). These flight missions provided image data covering the middle growth period of sorghum with a spatial resolution of approximately 6.5 cm. Field measurements of LAI and fc were also collected. Four vegetation indices were calculated using the UAS images. Among those indices, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) showed the highest correlation with LAI, fc and yield with R2 values of 0.91, 0.89 and 0.58 respectively. Empirical relationships between NDVI and LAI and between NDVI and fc were validated and proved to be accurate for estimating LAI and fc from UAS-derived NDVI values. NDVI determined from UAS imagery acquired during the flowering stage (74 DAP) was found to be the most highly correlated with final grain yield. The observed high correlations between UAS-derived NDVI and the crop growth parameters (fc, LAI and grain yield) suggests the applicability of UAS for within-season data collection of agricultural crops such as sorghum."
https://openalex.org/W2802402246,"All lung cancers patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation inevitably develop acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). In up to 30% of cases, the mechanism underlying acquired resistance remains unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) is a group of small non-coding RNAs commonly dysregulated in human cancers and have been implicated in therapy resistance. The aim of this study was to understand the roles of novel miRNAs in acquired EGFR TKI resistance in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we reported the evidence of miR-483-3p silencing and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype in both in vitro and in vivo EGFR-mutant NSCLC models with acquired resistance to gefitinib. In those tumor models, forced expression of miR-483-3p efficiently increased sensitivity of gefitinib-resistant lung cancer cells to gefitinib by inhibiting proliferation and promoting apoptosis. Moreover, miR-483-3p reversed EMT and inhibited migration, invasion, and metastasis of gefitinib-resistant lung cancer cells. Mechanistically, miR-483-3p directly targeted integrin β3, and thus repressed downstream FAK/Erk signaling pathway. Furthermore, the silencing of miR-483-3p in gefitinib-resistant lung cancer cells was due to hypermethylation of its own promoter. Taken together, our data identify miR-483-3p as a promising target for combination therapy to overcome acquired EGFR TKI resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2951506323,"Fluorescent staining is a common tool for both quantitative and qualitative assessment of pro- and eukaryotic cells sub-population fractions by using microscopy and flow cytometry. However, direct cell counting by flow cytometry is often limited, for example when working with cells rigidly adhered either to each other or to external surfaces like bacterial biofilms or adherent cell lines and tissue samples. An alternative approach is provided by using fluorescent microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), which enables the evaluation of fractions of cells subpopulations in a given sample. For the quantitative assessment of cell fractions in microphotographs, we suggest a simple two-step algorithm that combines single cells selection and the statistical analysis. To facilitate the first step, we suggest a simple procedure that supports finding the balance between the detection threshold and the typical size of single cells based on objective cell size distribution analysis. Based on a series of experimental measurements performed on bacterial and eukaryotic cells under various conditions, we show explicitly that the suggested approach effectively accounts for the fractions of different cell sub-populations (like the live/dead staining in our samples) in all studied cases that are in good agreement with manual cell counting on microphotographs and flow cytometry data. This algorithm is implemented as a simple software tool that includes an intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface for the initial adjustment of algorithm parameters to the microphotographs analysis as well as for the sequential analysis of homogeneous series of similar microscopic images without further user intervention. The software tool entitled BioFilmAnalyzer is freely available online at https://bitbucket.org/rogex/biofilmanalyzer/downloads/."
https://openalex.org/W2800009949,"Human immunodeficiency virus/Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome associated morbidity and mortality has reduced significantly since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy. As a result of increasing access to highly active antiretroviral therapy, the survival and quality of life of the patients has significantly improved globally. Despite this promising result, regular monitoring of people on antiretroviral therapy is recommended to ensure whether there is an effective treatment response or not. This study was designed to assess virological and immunological failure of highly active antiretroviral therapy users among adults and adolescents in the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, where scanty data are available.A retrospective follow up study was conducted from September 1 to December 30, 2016 to assess the magnitude and factors associated with virological and immunological failure among 260 adults and adolescents highly active antiretroviral therapy users who started first line ART between January 1, 2008 to March 1, 2016. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic and clinical data. SPSS Version21 statistical software was used for analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated to virological and immunological failure. Statistical association was declared significant if p-value was ≤ 0.05.A total of 30 (11.5%) and 17 (6.5%) participants experienced virological and immunological failure respectively in a median time of 36 months of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Virological failure was associated with non-adherence to medications, aged < 40 years old, having CD4+ T-cells count < 250 cells/μL and male gender. Similarly, immunological failure was associated with non-adherence, tuberculosis co-infection and Human immunodeficiency virus RNA ≥1000 copies/mL.The current result shows that immunological and virological failure is a problem in a setting where highly active antiretroviral therapy has been largely scale up. The problem is more in patients with poor adherence. This will in turn affect the global targets of 90% viral suppression by 2020. This may indicate the need for more investment and commitment to improving patient adherence in the study area."
https://openalex.org/W2800647072,"DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) has been recognised as a key element of epigenetic regulation in normal development, and the aberrant regulation of DNMT3A is implicated in multiple types of cancers, especially haematological malignancies. However, its clinical significance and detailed functional role in solid tumours remain unknown, although abnormal expression has gained widespread attention in these cancers. Here, we show that DNMT3A isoform b (DNMT3Ab), a member of the DNMT3A isoform family, is critical for directing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated metastasis in gastric cancer (GC). DNMT3Ab is positively linked to tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis in GC patients. Overexpression of DNMT3Ab promotes GC cell migration and invasion as well as EMT through repression of E-cadherin. Meanwhile, DNMT3Ab promotes lung metastasis of GC in vivo. Mechanistic studies indicate that DNMT3Ab mediates the epigenetic inaction of the E-cadherin gene via DNA hypermethylation and histone modifications of H3K9me2 and H3K27me3. Depletion of DNMT3Ab effectively restores the expression of E-cadherin and reverses TGF-β-induced EMT by reducing DNA methylation, H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 levels at the E-cadherin promoter. Importantly, DNMT3Ab cooperated with H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 contributes to the transcriptional regulation of E-cadherin in a Snail-dependent manner. Further, gene expression profiling analysis indicates that multiple metastasis-associated genes and oncogenic signalling pathways are regulated in response to DNMT3Ab overexpression. These results identify DNMT3Ab as a crucial regulator of metastasis-related genes in GC. Targeting the DNMT3Ab/Snail/E-cadherin axis may provide a promising therapeutic strategy in the treatment of metastatic GC with high DNMT3Ab expression."
https://openalex.org/W2802676107,"LncRNAs are regulatory noncoding RNAs that play crucial roles in many biological processes. The dysregulation of lncRNA is thought to be involved in many complex diseases; lncRNAs are often the targets of miRNAs in the indirect regulation of gene expression. Numerous studies have indicated that miRNA-lncRNA interactions are closely related to the occurrence and development of cancers. Thus, it is important to develop an effective method for the identification of cancer-related miRNA-lncRNA interactions. In this study, we compiled 155653 experimentally validated and predicted miRNA-lncRNA associations, which we defined as basic interactions. We next constructed an individual-specific miRNA-lncRNA network (ISMLN) for each cancer sample and a basic miRNA-lncRNA network (BMLN) for each type of cancer by examining the expression profiles of miRNAs and lncRNAs in the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database. We then selected potential miRNA-lncRNA biomarkers based on the BLMN. Using this method, we identified cancer-related miRNA-lncRNA biomarkers and modules specific to a certain cancer. This method of profiling will contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of cancers at the level of gene regulatory networks."
https://openalex.org/W2799811249,"Gene fusion is a chromosomal rearrangement event which plays a significant role in cancer due to the oncogenic potential of the chimeric protein generated through fusions. At present many databases are available in public domain which provides detailed information about known gene fusion events and their functional role. Existing gene fusion detection tools, based on analysis of transcriptomics data usually report a large number of fusion genes as potential candidates, which could be either known or novel or false positives. Manual annotation of these putative genes is indeed time-consuming. We have developed a web platform FusionHub, which acts as integrated search engine interfacing various fusion gene databases and simplifies large scale annotation of fusion genes in a seamless way. In addition, FusionHub provides three ways of visualizing fusion events: circular view, domain architecture view and network view. Design of potential siRNA molecules through ensemble method is another utility integrated in FusionHub that could aid in siRNA-based targeted therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2802041462,"Spermatogenesis is precisely controlled by complex gene expression programs and involves epigenetic reprogramming, including histone modification and DNA methylation. SET domain–containing 2 (SETD2) is the predominant histone methyltransferase catalyzing the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me3) and plays key roles in embryonic stem cell differentiation and somatic cell development. However, its role in male germ cell development remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate an essential role of Setd2 for spermiogenesis, the final stage of spermatogenesis. Using RNA-seq, we found that, in postnatal mouse testes, Setd2 mRNA levels dramatically increase in 14-day-old mice. Using a germ cell–specific Setd2 knockout mouse model, we also found that targeted Setd2 knockout in germ cells causes aberrant spermiogenesis with acrosomal malformation before step 8 of the round-spermatid stage, resulting in complete infertility. Furthermore, we noted that the Setd2 deficiency results in complete loss of H3K36me3 and significantly decreases expression of thousands of genes, including those encoding acrosin-binding protein 1 (Acrbp1) and protamines, required for spermatogenesis. Our findings thus reveal a previously unappreciated role of the SETD2-dependent H3K36me3 modification in spermiogenesis and provide clues to the molecular mechanisms in epigenetic disorders underlying male infertility."
https://openalex.org/W2799624054,"Zoonotic diseases continue to be a public health burden globally. Uganda is especially vulnerable due to its location, biodiversity, and population. Given these concerns, the Ugandan government in collaboration with the Global Health Security Agenda conducted a One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization Workshop to identify zoonotic diseases of greatest national concern to the Ugandan government.The One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization tool, a semi-quantitative tool developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was used for the prioritization of zoonoses. Workshop participants included voting members and observers representing multiple government and non-governmental sectors. During the workshop, criteria for prioritization were selected, and questions and weights relevant to each criterion were determined. We used a decision tree to provide a ranked list of zoonoses. Participants then established next steps for multisectoral engagement for the prioritized zoonoses. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated how criteria weights impacted disease prioritization.Forty-eight zoonoses were considered during the workshop. Criteria selected to prioritize zoonotic diseases were (1) severity of disease in humans in Uganda, (2) availability of effective control strategies, (3) potential to cause an epidemic or pandemic in humans or animals, (4) social and economic impacts, and (5) bioterrorism potential. Seven zoonotic diseases were identified as priorities for Uganda: anthrax, zoonotic influenza viruses, viral hemorrhagic fevers, brucellosis, African trypanosomiasis, plague, and rabies. Sensitivity analysis did not indicate significant changes in zoonotic disease prioritization based on criteria weights.One Health approaches and multisectoral collaborations are crucial to the surveillance, prevention, and control strategies for zoonotic diseases. Uganda used such an approach to identify zoonoses of national concern. Identifying these priority diseases enables Uganda's National One Health Platform and Zoonotic Disease Coordination Office to address these zoonoses in the future with a targeted allocation of resources."
https://openalex.org/W2801357372,"Background In low and middle-income countries, reliable data on the epidemiology of childhood acute kidney injury (AKI) is lacking. The Global Snapshot, conducted by the ISN “0by25” AKI initiative, was a world-wide cross-sectional, observational study to evaluate AKI in hospitalized patients. Here we report the pediatric results of this study. Patients and methods We prospectively collected data on children who met the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes AKI criteria during a 10-week window in late 2014. AKI risk factors, etiological factors, management and outcomes were recorded using standardized forms and protocols. Countries were classified according to their 2014 gross national income (GNI) per person into high-income countries (HIC), upper-middle income countries (UMIC) and low and low-middle income countries (LLMIC). Need for renal replacement therapy, mortality, and renal recovery were assessed 7 days after AKI diagnosis or at hospital discharge, whichever came first. Results 92 centers from 41 countries collected data on 354 pediatric AKI patients; 53% of the children developed AKI while hospitalized and 47% in the community. The most common etiological factors for AKI differed across GNI categories as well as between patients with community-acquired vs. hospital-acquired AKI. Children from HIC were younger, and larger proportion of AKI in this group were due to post-surgical complications vs. other etiologies when compared to other income categories. In patients with hypotension as the cause of AKI, the adjusted risk of death was almost 10-fold higher compared to patients without hypotension as an etiological factor for AKI development. Mortality was similar within AKI stages in HIC and UMIC. In LLMIC, patients with the highest AKI level of severity had higher mortality than patients in higher income categories. Patients from LLMIC and UMIC had a 57-fold and 11 fold higher adjusted risk of death, respectively, compared to patients from HIC. Conclusion In resource-limited countries, pediatric AKI-associated mortality is disproportionately higher when compared to high-resource areas, especially among patients with more severe AKI."
https://openalex.org/W2802504099,"G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) can be differentially activated by ligands to generate multiple and distinct downstream signaling profiles, a phenomenon termed biased agonism. The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is a class B GPCR and a key drug target for managing metabolic disorders; however, its peptide agonists display biased signaling that affects their relative efficacies. In this study, we combined mutagenesis experiments and mapping of surface mutations onto recently described GLP-1R structures, which revealed two major domains in the GLP-1/GLP-1R/Gs protein active structure that are differentially important for both receptor quiescence and ligand-specific initiation and propagation of biased agonism. Changes to the conformation of transmembrane helix (TM) 5 and TM 6 and reordering of extracellular loop 2 were essential for the propagation of signaling linked to cAMP formation and intracellular calcium mobilization, whereas ordering and packing of residues in TMs 1 and 7 were critical for extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 (pERK) activity. On the basis of these findings, we propose a model of distinct peptide–receptor interactions that selectively control how these different signaling pathways are engaged. This work provides important structural insight into class B GPCR activation and biased agonism."
https://openalex.org/W2800649638,"Acquiring high quality RNA is the basis of plant molecular biology research, plant genetics and other physiological investigations. At present, a large number of nucleotide isolation methods have been exploited or modified, such as commercial kits, CTAB, SDS methods and so on. Due to the nature of different plants, extraction methods vary. Moreover, efficiency of certain approach cannot be guaranteed due to composition of different plants and extracting high quality RNA from plants rich in polysaccharides and polyphenols are often difficult. The physical and chemical properties of polysaccharides which are similar to nucleic acids and other secondary metabolites will be coprecipitated with RNA irreversibly. Therefore, how to remove polysaccharides and other secondary metabolites during RNA extraction is the primary challenge. Dendrobium huoshanense is an Orchidaceae perennial herb that is rich in polysaccharides and other secondary metabolites. By using D. huoshanense as the subject, we improved the method originated from CHAN and made it suitable for plants containing high amount of polysaccharides and polyphenols. The extracted total RNA was clear and non-dispersive, with good integrity and no obvious contamination with DNA and other impurities. And it was also evaluated by gel electrophoresis, nucleic acid quantitative detector and PCR assessment. Thus, as a simple approach, it is suitable and efficient in RNA isolation for plants rich in polysaccharides and polyphenols."
https://openalex.org/W2800191686,"A key event required for effective resolution of inflammation is efferocytosis, which is defined as phagocytic removal of apoptotic cells mostly by macrophages acquiring an alternatively activated phenotype (M2). c-Myc has been reported to play a role in alternative activation of human macrophages and is proposed as one of the M2 macrophage markers. We found that M2-like peritoneal macrophages from zymosan A-treated mice exhibited a marked accumulation of Myc-nick, a truncated protein generated by a Calpain-mediated proteolytic cleavage of full-length c-Myc. Further, ectopic expression of Myc-nick in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages promoted the M2 polarization and, consequently, enhanced their efferocytic capability. Notably, Myc-nick-induced efferocytosis was found to be tightly associated with α-tubulin acetylation by K acetyltransferase 2a (Kat2a/Gcn5) activity. These findings suggest Myc-nick as a novel proresolving mediator that has a fundamental function in maintaining homeostasis under inflammatory conditions.-Zhong, X., Lee, H.-N., Kim, S.

https://openalex.org/W2799564615,"Intrinsically disordered regions are present in one-third of eukaryotic proteins and are overrepresented in cellular processes such as signaling, suggesting that intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) may have a functional advantage over folded proteins. Upon interacting with a partner macromolecule, a subset of IDPs can fold and bind to form a well-defined three-dimensional conformation. For example, disordered BH3-only proteins bind promiscuously to a large number of homologous BCL-2 family proteins, where they fold to a helical structure in a groove on the BCL-2-like protein surface. As two protein chains are involved in the folding reaction, and the structure is only formed in the presence of the partner macromolecule, this raises the question of where the folding information is encoded. Here, we examine these coupled folding and binding reactions to determine which component determines the folding and binding pathway. Using Φ value analysis to compare transition state interactions between the disordered BH3-only proteins PUMA and BID and the folded BCL-2-like proteins A1 and MCL-1, we found that, even though the BH3-only protein is disordered in isolation and requires a stabilizing partner to fold, its folding and binding pathway is encoded in the IDP itself; the reaction is not templated by the folded partner. We suggest that, by encoding both its transition state and level of residual structure, an IDP can evolve a specific kinetic profile, which could be a crucial functional advantage of disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2799547519,"The rapid diffusion of farming technologies in the western Mediterranean raises questions about the mechanisms that drove the development of intensive contact networks and circulation routes between incoming Neolithic communities. Using a statistical method to analyze a brand-new set of cultural and chronological data, we document the large-scale processes that led to variations between Mediterranean archaeological cultures, and micro-scale processes responsible for the transmission of cultural practices within farming communities. The analysis of two symbolic productions, pottery decorations and personal ornaments, shed light on the complex interactions developed by Early Neolithic farmers in the western Mediterranean area. Pottery decoration diversity correlates with local processes of circulation and exchange, resulting in the emergence and the persistence of stylistic and symbolic boundaries between groups, while personal ornaments reflect extensive networks and the high level of mobility of Early Neolithic farmers. The two symbolic productions express different degrees of cultural interaction that may have facilitated the successful and rapid expansion of early farming societies in the western Mediterranean."
https://openalex.org/W2799945934,"This work presents an alternative device for cancer screening in liquid biopsies. It combines a biomimetic film (i) with electrochemical detection (ii). The biomimetic film (i) was obtained by electro-polymerizing amine-substituted benzene rings around a CA 15–3 target. This protein target was previously adsorbed on a gold (Au) support and incubated in charged monomers (4-Styrenesulfonate sodium and 3-Hydroxytyraminium chloride). The protein was further eliminated by enzymatic activity, leaving behind vacant sites for subsequent rebinding. Electrochemical detection (ii) was achieved on an Au working electrode, designed on commercial screen-printed electrodes. Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and ellipsometric readings were used to follow the chemical modification of the Au surface. The ability of the material to rebind CA15-3 was monitored by electrochemical techniques. The device displayed linear responses to CA15-3 ranging from 0.25 to 10.00 U/mL, with detection limits of 0.05 U/mL. Accurate results were obtained by applying the sensor to the analysis of CA15-3 in PBS buffer and in serum samples. This biosensing device displayed successful features for the detection of CA 15–3 and constitutes a promising tool for breast cancer screening procedures in point-of-care applications. Moreover, its scale-up seems feasible as it contains a plastic antibody assembled in situ, in less than 1 minute, and the analysis of serum takes less than 30 minutes."
https://openalex.org/W2799416243,"To discuss the dual energy spectral computer tomography (CT) imaging features of the pathological grading of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and the correlation between spectral CT imaging features and pathology.We performed analyses of 62 patients with confirmed diagnosis of ccRCC. All patients underwent non-enhanced CT and dual-phase (cortex phase, CP and parenchyma phase, PP) contrast-enhanced CT with dual energy spectral mode. The subjects were pathologically divided into two groups: low-grade group (Fuhrman 1/2) and high-grade group (Fuhrman 3/4). The CT value of each lesion was measured on the monochromatic image at 70 keV. The normalized iodine concentrations (NIC) and the slope of the spectrum curve were calculated. The qualitative morphological parameters, including tumor shape, calcification, pseudocapsule, necrosis, and enhancement mode, were compared between the two groups. The quantitative data were compared using Student's t-test, and the enumeration data were analyzed using the chi-square test between low-grade and high-grade ccRCC.Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the quantitative parameters in two groups.The CT value, NIC, and mean slope of the low-grade group were increased compared with the high-grade group during CP (P = 0.001, P = 0.043, and P<0.001, respectively). The CT did not differ significantly during PP (P = 0.134); however, the NIC and mean slope varied considerably in the low grade compared with the high-grade group (P = 0.048, P = 0.017, respectively). The CT threshold value, NIC, and slope had high sensitivity and specificity in differentiating low-grade ccRCC from high-grade ccRCC. The tumor shape, pseudocapsule, and necrosis differed significantly between the two groups (P<0.05).Dual energy spectral CT with the quantitative analysis of iodine concentration and qualitative analysis of morphological characteristics increases the accuracy of diagnosing the pathological grade of ccRCC."
https://openalex.org/W2799630667,"Most of the angiogenesis inhibitors clinically used in cancer treatment target the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) pathway. However, the current strategies for treating angiogenesis have limited efficacy. The issue of how to treat angiogenesis and endothelial dysfunction in cancer remains a matter of substantial debate. Here we demonstrate a glycosylation-dependent regulatory mechanism for tumor angiogenesis. St6gal1−/− mice, lacking the α2,6-sialylation enzyme, were shown to exhibit impaired tumor angiogenesis through enhanced endothelial apoptosis. In a previous study, St6gal1−/− endothelial cells exhibited a reduction in the cell surface residency of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM). In this study, we found that cooperative functionality of PECAM-VEGFR2-integrin β3 was disturbed in St6gal1−/− mice. First, cell surface PECAM-VEGFR2 complexes were lost, and both VEGFR2 internalization and the VEGFR-dependent signaling pathway were enhanced. Second, enhanced anoikis was observed, suggesting that the absence of α2,6-sialic acid leads to dysregulated integrin signaling. Notably, ectopic expression of PECAM increased cell surface integrin-β3, indicating that the reduction of cell surface integrin-β3 involves loss-of-endothelial PECAM. The results suggest that the cell surface stability of these glycoproteins is significantly reduced by the lack of α2,6-sialic acid, leading to abnormal signal transduction. The present findings highlight that α2,6-sialylation is critically involved in endothelial survival by controlling the cell surface stability and signal transduction of angiogenic molecules, and could be a novel target for anti-angiogenesis therapy."

ADPKD is primarily caused by mutations in two genes, PKD1 and PKD2. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA), defined by a length >200 nucleotides and absence of a long ORF, have recently emerged as epigenetic regulators of development and disease; however, their involvement in PKD has not been explored previously. Here, we performed deep RNA-Seq to identify lncRNAs that are dysregulated in two orthologous mouse models of ADPKD (kidney-specific Pkd1 and Pkd2 mutant mice). We identified a kidney-specific, evolutionarily conserved lncRNA called Hoxb3os that was down-regulated in cystic kidneys from Pkd1 and Pkd2 mutant mice. The human ortholog HOXB3-AS1 was down-regulated in cystic kidneys from ADPKD patients. Hoxb3os was highly expressed in renal tubules in adult WT mice, whereas its expression was lost in the cyst epithelium of mutant mice. To investigate the function of Hoxb3os, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out its expression in mIMCD3 cells. Deletion of Hoxb3os resulted in increased phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream targets, including p70 S6 kinase, ribosomal protein S6, and the translation repressor 4E-BP1. Consistent with activation of mTORC1 signaling, Hoxb3os mutant cells displayed increased mitochondrial respiration. The Hoxb3os mutant phenotype was partially rescued upon re-expression of Hoxb3os in knockout cells.

https://openalex.org/W2799877020,"We compared the clinical characteristics, treatments, and prognoses of fungal keratitis in patients with and without diabetes. Patients diagnosed with fungal keratitis at Shandong Eye Institute between January 2010 and December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed and classified as diabetic and nondiabetic groups. One-hundred-and-eleven patients (111 eyes) with diabetes and 740 patients (740 eyes) without diabetes were included. The diabetic patients showed significantly older (p< 0.05) and lower male:female ratio (p<0.05). Plants trauma was the primary risk factor in both groups, and there was no significant difference of pathogen type (the most common was Fusarium genus, followed by Alternaria and Aspergillus genera). Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that diabetes and topical glucocorticoid use were the independent risk factors for the severity of fungal keratitis. The recurrent infection rate between the diabetic and nondiabetic patients during the follow-up (6 to 24 months) after penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) was not significantly different. Although the recurrent epithelial defect, rejection, and best-corrected visual acuity were similar between the patients with matched bed/graft size (7.75/8.0 mm) in the two groups 1 year after PKP, the incidence of delayed re-epithelialization (>7 days) was significantly higher in diabetic patients (3/10 versus 2/43 in nondiabetic patients, p<0.05). More specially, the diabetic patients with the duration ≥10 years showed more significantly delayed re-epithelialization than those with the diabetic duration less than 10 years (3/5 versus 1/26, p<0.05).

Corneal re-epithelialization was significantly delayed after PKP in the diabetic patients, especially with the duration ≥10 years."
https://openalex.org/W2802062281,"The leukocyte chemosensory pathway detects attractant gradients and directs cell migration to sites of inflammation, infection, tissue damage, and carcinogenesis. Previous studies have revealed that local Ca2+ and PIP3 signals at the leading edge of polarized leukocytes play central roles in positive feedback loop essential to cell polarization and chemotaxis. These prior studies showed that stimulation of the leading edge Ca2+ signal can strongly activate PI3K, thereby triggering a larger PIP3 signal, but did not elucidate the mechanistic link between Ca2+ and PIP3 signaling. A hypothesis explaining this link emerged, postulating that Ca2+-activated PKC displaces the MARCKS protein from plasma membrane PIP2, thereby releasing sequestered PIP2 to serve as the target and substrate lipid of PI3K in PIP3 production. In vitro single molecule studies of the reconstituted pathway on lipid bilayers demonstrated the feasibility of this PKC-MARCKS-PI3K regulatory module linking Ca2+ and PIP3 signals in the reconstituted system. The present study tests the model predictions in live macrophages by quantifying the effects of: (a) two pathway activators-PDGF and ATP that stimulate chemoreceptors and Ca2+ influx, respectively; and (b) three pathway inhibitors-wortmannin, EGTA, and Go6976 that inhibit PI3K, Ca2+ influx, and PKC, respectively; on (c) four leading edge activity sensors-AKT-PH-mRFP, CKAR, MARCKSp-mRFP, and leading edge area that report on PIP3 density, PKC activity, MARCKS membrane binding, and leading edge expansion/contraction, respectively. The results provide additional evidence that PKC and PI3K are both essential elements of the leading edge positive feedback loop, and strongly support the existence of a PKC-MARCKS-PI3K regulatory module linking the leading edge Ca2+ and PIP3 signals. As predicted, activators stimulate leading edge PKC activity, displacement of MARCKS from the leading edge membrane and increased leading edge PIP3 levels, while inhibitors trigger the opposite effects. Comparison of the findings for the ameboid chemotaxis of leukocytes with recently published findings for the mesenchymal chemotaxis of fibroblasts suggests that some features of the emerging leukocyte leading edge core pathway (PLC-DAG-Ca2+-PKC-MARCKS-PIP2-PI3K-PIP3) may well be shared by all chemotaxing eukaryotic cells, while other elements of the leukocyte pathway may be specialized features of these highly optimized, professional gradient-seeking cells. More broadly, the findings suggest a molecular mechanism for the strong links between phospho-MARCKS and many human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2799353450,"Many studies have reported that hydraulic properties vary considerably between tree species, but little is known about their intraspecific variation and, therefore, their capacity to adapt to a warmer and drier climate. Here, we quantify phenotypic divergence and clinal variation for embolism resistance, hydraulic conductivity and branch growth, in four tree species, two angiosperms (Betula pendula, Populus tremula) and two conifers (Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris), across their latitudinal distribution in Europe. Growth and hydraulic efficiency varied widely within species and between populations. The variability of embolism resistance was in general weaker than that of growth and hydraulic efficiency, and very low for all species but Populus tremula. In addition, no and weak support for a safety vs. efficiency trade-off was observed for the angiosperm and conifer species, respectively. The limited variability of embolism resistance observed here for all species except Populus tremula, suggests that forest populations will unlikely be able to adapt hydraulically to drier conditions through the evolution of embolism resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2799283663,"With the rising of e-hailing services in urban areas, ride sharing is becoming a common mode of transportation. This paper presents a mathematical model to design an enhanced ridesharing system with meet points and users’ preferable time windows. The introduction of meet points allows ridesharing operators to trade off the benefits of saving en-route delays and the cost of additional walking for some passengers to be collectively picked up or dropped off. This extension to the traditional door-to-door ridesharing problem brings more operation flexibility in urban areas (where potential requests may be densely distributed in neighborhood), and thus could achieve better system performance in terms of reducing the total travel time and increasing the served passengers. We design and implement a Tabu-based meta-heuristic algorithm to solve the proposed mixed integer linear program (MILP). To evaluate the validation and effectiveness of the proposed model and solution algorithm, several scenarios are designed and also resolved to optimality by CPLEX. Results demonstrate that (i) detailed route plan associated with passenger assignment to meet points can be obtained with en-route delay savings; (ii) as compared to CPLEX, the meta-heuristic algorithm bears the advantage of higher computation efficiency and produces good quality solutions with 8%~15% difference from the global optima; and (iii) introducing meet points to ridesharing system saves the total travel time by 2.7%-3.8% for small-scale ridesharing systems. More benefits are expected for ridesharing systems with large size of fleet. This study provides a new tool to efficiently operate the ridesharing system, particularly when the ride sharing vehicles are in short supply during peak hours. Traffic congestion mitigation will also be expected."
https://openalex.org/W2802609765,"Despite increasing clinical adoption, biologic influences of ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) remain insufficiently elucidated. The aim of the current study was to investigate biomolecular changes induced by EVLP in rat lungs. EVLP was maintained for 180 min. Hyaluronan, mediators, and cells were assessed in the perfusate. Gene expression, signaling pathways, and ATP content were investigated in lung tissue. EVLP induced the release of medium-high molecular weight hyaluronan and transcription of hyaluronan synthases ( P < 0.001). Increasing concentrations of inflammatory mediators were detected in the perfusate ( P < 0.001). Perfused lungs exhibited a distinctive transcriptional signature compared with organs examined before or after surgery/procurement ( P = 0.003). Up-regulated genes were involved in inflammation and its regulation, apoptosis/survival, heat shock, and oxidative stress response ( q = 0). Down-regulated genes were related to lymphocyte function ( q = 0). The NF-κB, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, ERK1/2, p38, Akt, and stress-activated protein kinase/JNK signaling pathways were modulated by EVLP ( P < 0.05). Most of these biomolecular changes were examined and confirmed in additional experiments that were performed in lungs procured from donation after cardiocirculatory death after 180 min of warm ischemia. The current study demonstrates that EVLP broadly affects the lung biomolecular phenotype. These findings improve our comprehension of the effects exerted by the procedure and encourage additional research in preclinical models to implement therapeutic interventions.-Lonati, C., Bassani, G.

https://openalex.org/W2801512183,"The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum proliferates in red blood cells following repeated cycles of invasion, multiplication, and egress. P. falciparum serine repeat antigen 5 (PfSERA5), a putative serine protease, plays an important role in merozoite egress. However, regulation of its activity leading to merozoite egress is poorly understood. In this study, we show that PfSERA5 undergoes phosphorylation prior to merozoite egress. Immunoprecipitation of parasite lysates using anti-PfSERA5 serum followed by MS analysis identified calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 (PfCDPK1) as an interacting kinase. Association of PfSERA5 with PfCDPK1 was corroborated by co-sedimentation, co-immunoprecipitation, and co-immunolocalization analyses. Interestingly, PfCDPK1 phosphorylated PfSERA5 in vitro in the presence of Ca2+ and enhanced its proteolytic activity. A PfCDPK1 inhibitor, purfalcamine, blocked the phosphorylation and activation of PfSERA5 both in vitroas well as in schizonts, which, in turn, blocked merozoite egress. Together, these results suggest that phosphorylation of PfSERA5 by PfCDPK1 following a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ levels activates its proteolytic activity to trigger merozoite egress."
https://openalex.org/W2800805293,"Radiation therapy is the primary intervention for nearly half of the patients with localized advanced prostate cancer and standard of care for recurrent disease following surgery. The development of radiation-resistant disease is an obstacle for nearly 30-50% of patients undergoing radiotherapy. A better understanding of mechanisms that lead to radiation resistance could aid in the development of sensitizing agents to improve outcome. Here we identified a radiation-resistance pathway mediated by CD105, downstream of BMP and TGF-β signaling. Antagonizing CD105-dependent BMP signaling with a partially humanized monoclonal antibody, TRC105, resulted in a significant reduction in clonogenicity when combined with irradiation. In trying to better understand the mechanism for the radio-sensitization, we found that radiation-induced CD105/BMP signaling was sufficient and necessary for the upregulation of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in contributing to p53 stabilization and PGC-1α activation. Combining TRC105 with irradiation delayed DNA damage repair compared to irradiation alone. However, in the absence of p53 function, combining TRC105 and radiation resulted in no reduction in clonogenicity compared to radiation alone, despite similar reduction of DNA damage repair observed in p53-intact cells. This suggested DNA damage repair was not the sole determinant of CD105 radio-resistance. As cancer cells undergo an energy deficit following irradiation, due to the demands of DNA and organelle repair, we examined SIRT1's role on p53 and PGC-1α with respect to glycolysis and mitochondrial biogenesis, respectively. Consequently, blocking the CD105-SIRT1 axis was found to deplete the ATP stores of irradiated cells and cause G2 cell cycle arrest. Xenograft models supported these findings that combining TRC105 with irradiation significantly reduces tumor size over irradiation alone (p value = 10-9). We identified a novel synthetic lethality strategy of combining radiation and CD105 targeting to address the DNA repair and metabolic addiction induced by irradiation in p53-functional prostate cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2801332391,"Introduction Neonatal inflammation, mediated in part through Toll-like receptor (TLR) and inflammasome signaling, contributes to adverse outcomes including organ injury. Pentoxifylline (PTX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor which potently suppresses cytokine production in newborn cord blood, is a candidate neonatal anti-inflammatory agent. We hypothesized that combinations of PTX with other anti-inflammatory agents, the steroid dexamethasone (DEX) or the macrolide azithromycin (AZI), may exert broader, more profound and/or synergistic anti-inflammatory activity towards neonatal TLR- and inflammasome-mediated cytokine production. Methods Whole newborn and adult blood was treated with PTX (50–200 μM), DEX (10−10–10−7 M), or AZI (2.5–20 μM), alone or combined, and cultured with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (TLR4 agonist), R848 (TLR7/8 agonist) or LPS/adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (inflammasome induction). Supernatant and intracellular cytokines, signaling molecules and mRNA were measured by multiplex assay, flow cytometry and real-time PCR. Drug interactions were assessed based on Loewe's additivity. Results PTX, DEX and AZI inhibited TLR- and/or inflammasome-mediated cytokine production in newborn and adult blood, whether added before, simultaneously or after TLR stimulation. PTX preferentially inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines especially TNF. DEX inhibited IL-10 in newborn, and TNF, IL-1β, IL-6 and interferon-α in newborn and adult blood. AZI inhibited R848-induced TNF, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10, and LPS-induced IL-1β and IL-10. (PTX+DEX) synergistically decreased LPS- and LPS/ATP-induced TNF, IL-1β, and IL-6, and R848-induced IL-1β and interferon-α, while (PTX+AZI) synergistically decreased induction of TNF, IL-1β, and IL-6. Synergistic inhibition of TNF production by (PTX+DEX) was especially pronounced in newborn vs. adult blood and was accompanied by reduction of TNF mRNA and enhancement of IL10 mRNA. Conclusions Age, agent, and specific drug-drug combinations exert distinct anti-inflammatory effects towards TLR- and/or inflammasome-mediated cytokine production in human newborn blood in vitro. Synergistic combinations of PTX, DEX and AZI may offer benefit for prevention and/or treatment of neonatal inflammatory conditions while potentially limiting drug exposure and toxicity."

https://openalex.org/W2800335084,"Arsenic (As), a highly toxic metalloid, naturally present in Camarones River (Atacama Desert, Chile) is a great health concern for the local population and authorities. In this study, the taxonomic and functional characterization of bacterial communities associated to metal-rich sediments from three sites of the river (sites M1, M2 and M3), showing different arsenic concentrations, were evaluated using a combination of approaches. Diversity of bacterial communities was evaluated by Illumina sequencing. Strains resistant to arsenic concentrations varying from 0.5 to 100 mM arsenite or arsenate were isolated and the presence of genes coding for enzymes involved in arsenic oxidation (aio) or reduction (arsC) investigated. Bacterial communities showed a moderate diversity which increased as arsenic concentrations decreased along the river. Sequences of the dominant taxonomic groups (abundances ≥1%) present in all three sites were affiliated to Proteobacteria (range 40.3-47.2%), Firmicutes (8.4-24.8%), Acidobacteria (10.4-17.1%), Actinobacteria (5.4-8.1%), Chloroflexi (3.9-7.5%), Planctomycetes (1.2-5.3%), Gemmatimonadetes (1.2-1.5%), and Nitrospirae (1.1-1.2%). Bacterial communities from sites M2 and M3 showed no significant differences in diversity between each other (p = 0.9753) but they were significantly more diverse than M1 (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). Sequences affiliated with Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi and Actinobacteria at M1 accounted for more than 89% of the total classified bacterial sequences present but these phyla were present in lesser proportions in M2 and M3 sites. Strains isolated from the sediment of sample M1, having the greatest arsenic concentration (498 mg kg-1), showed the largest percentages of arsenic oxidation and reduction. Genes aio were more frequently detected in isolates from M1 (54%), whereas arsC genes were present in almost all isolates from all three sediments, suggesting that bacterial communities play an important role in the arsenic biogeochemical cycle and detoxification of arsenical compounds. Overall, results provide further knowledge on the microbial diversity of arsenic contaminated fresh-water sediments."
https://openalex.org/W2799490158,"Flavonoids, a class of natural compounds with variable phenolic structures, have been found to possess anti-cancer activities by modulating different enzymes and receptors like CDK6. To understand the binding behavior of flavonoids that inhibit the active CDK6, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on six inhibitors, chrysin (M01), fisetin (M03), galangin (M04), genistein (M05), quercetin (M06) and kaempferol (M07), complexed with CDK6/cyclin D. For all six flavonoids, the 3'-OH and 4'-OH of B-ring were found to be favorable for hydrogen bond formation, but the 3-OH on the C-ring and 5-OH on the A-ring were unfavorable, which were confirmed by the MD simulation results of the test molecule, 3', 4', 7-trihydroxyflavone (M15). The binding efficiencies of flavonoids against the CDK6/cyclin D complex were mainly through the electrostatic (especially the H-bond force) and vdW interactions with residues ILE19, VAL27, ALA41, GLU61, PHE98, GLN103, ASP163 and LEU152. The order of binding affinities of these flavonoids toward the CDK6/cyclin D was M03 > M01 > M07 > M15 > M06 > M05 > M04. It is anticipated that the binding features of flavonoid inhibitors studied in the present work may provide valuable insights for the development of CDK6 inhibitors."

The objective of this study was to describe the burden of acute respiratory infections (ARI) in Ecuador between 2011 and 2015. Methods Five-year period morbidity and mortality data available from national agencies of statistics was analyzed to estimate the burden of disease attributable to acute respiratory infections. Cases and deaths registered were grouped according to their ICD-10 code into three diagnostic groups: Acute upper respiratory infections (J00-J06), Influenza and pneumonia (J09-J18), and Bronchitis and other acute lower respiratory infections (J20-J22, J85, J86). Disability-adjusted life years stratified by diagnostic and age group were calculated using the “DALY” package for R. The productivity loss in monetary terms was estimated using the human capital method. Results Over the 5-year period studied there were a total of 14.84 million cases of acute respiratory infections, with 17 757 deaths reported (0.12%). The yearly burden of disease ranged between 98 944 to 118 651 disability-adjusted life years, with an estimated average loss of productivity of US$152.16 million (±19.6) per year. Approximately 99% of the burden can be attributed to years life lost due to premature mortality in population under 5 years old and over 60 years-old. Conclusions The burden of acute respiratory infections remained steady during the analyzed period. Evidence-based prevention and control policies to tackle acute respiratory infections in Ecuador should focus on the population at extreme ages of life."
https://openalex.org/W2799788871,"Universal access to Primary Eye Care (PEC) is a key global initiative to reduce and prevent avoidable causes of visual impairment (VI). PEC can address minor eye conditions, simple forms of uncorrected refractive error (URE) and create a referral pathway for specialist eye care, thus offering a potential solution to a lack of eye health specialists in low-income countries. However, there is little information on the population need for PEC, including prevalence of URE in all ages in Sub-Saharan Africa.A national survey was conducted of people aged 7 and over in Rwanda in September-December 2016. Participants were selected through two-stage probability proportional to size sampling and compact segment sampling. VI (visual acuity<6/12) was assessed using Portable Eye Examination Kit (PEEK); URE was detected using a pinhole and presbyopia using local near vision test. We also used validated questionnaires to collect socio-demographic and minor eye symptoms information. Prevalence estimates for VI, URE and need for PEC (URE, presbyopia with good distance vision, need for referrals and minor eye conditions) were age and sex standardized to the Rwandan population. Associations between age, sex, socio-economic status and the key outcomes were examined using logistic regression.4618 participants were examined and interviewed out of 5361 enumerated (86% response rate). The adjusted population prevalence of VI was 3.7% (95%CI = 3.0-4.5%), URE was 2.2% (95%CI = 1.7-2.8%) and overall need for PEC was 34.0% (95%CI = 31.8-36.4%). Women and older people were more likely to need PEC and require a referral.Nearly a third of the population in Rwanda has the potential to benefit from PEC, with greater need identified in older people and women. Universal access to PEC can address unmet eye health needs and public health planning needs to ensure equitable access to older people and women."

Methods We enrolled 1238 WLHIV (BF = 615; SA = 623) aged 25–50 years and followed them at three time points (6, 12 and 16 months) after enrolment. Presence of AGW was assessed during gynaecological examination. Cervico-vaginal swabs for enrolment and month 16 follow-up visits were tested for HPV infection by Inno-LiPA® genotyping. Logistic regression was used to assess risk factors for prevalent infection or AGW. Cox regression was used to assess risk factors for incident AGW. Results Women in SA were more likely than those in BF to have prevalent LR-HPV infection (BF: 27.1% vs. SA: 40.9%; p<0.001) and incident LR-HPV infection (BF: 25.8% vs. SA: 31.6%, p = 0.05). Prevalence of persistent LR-HPV was similar in the two countries (BF: 33.3% vs. SA: 30.4%; p = 0.54), as were prevalence and incidence of AGW (Prevalence: BF: 7.5% vs. SA: 5.7%; p = 0.21; Incidence: BF: 2.47 vs. SA: 2.33 per 100 person-years; p = 0.41). HPV6 was associated with incident AGW (BF: adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR) = 4.88; 95%CI: 1.36–17.45; SA: aHR = 5.02; 95%CI: 1.40–17.99). Prevalent LR-HPV (BF: adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR = 1.86]; 95%CI: 1.01–3.41; SA: aOR = 1.75; 95%CI: 0.88–3.48); persistent LR-HPV (BF: aOR = 1.92; 95%CI: 0.44–8.44; SA: aOR = 2.81; 95%CI: 1.07–7.41) and prevalent AGW (BF: aOR = 1.53; 95%CI: 0.61–3.87; SA: aOR = 4.11; 95%CI: 1.20–14.10) were each associated with low CD4+ counts (i.e. <200 vs. >500 cells/μL). Duration of ART and HIV plasma viral load were not associated with any LR-HPV infection or AGW outcomes. Conclusion LR-HPV infection and AGW are common in WLHIV in sub-Saharan Africa. Type-specific HPV vaccines and effective ART with immunological reconstitution could reduce the burden of AGW in this population."

We aimed to analyse the impact of reduced pulmonary function on non-respiratory impairments and mobility activity limitations in an elderly population with COPD and to elucidate which specific limitations on mobility are related to reduced pulmonary function Methods Cross-sectional study of 110 patients with COPD, recruited from public and university hospital. The effect of impaired pulmonary function on the risk of non-respiratory impairments and mobility limitations was analysed using validated measures, including: the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), skeletal muscle strength, the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), and self-reported mobility questionnaire. Multivariate analysis was used to control for confounders such as age, sex, height, education, and cigarette smoking. Results Greater impairment of pulmonary function was associated with less distance walked during the 6MWT, poorer SPPB scores, and greater risk of self-reported mobility limitations (p<0.05). Lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s was also associated with a greater risk of limitations in carrying items under 10 pounds (4.54 kg), walking alone up and down a flight of stairs, and walking two or three neighbourhood blocks. There was no clear statistical relationship between pulmonary function impairment and skeletal muscle strength. Conclusions Impaired pulmonary function was associated with the 6MWT score and limitations on performance-based and self-reported mobility activities, but not with skeletal muscle strength among elderly COPD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2801958395,"The enzymatic functionalization of hydrocarbons is a central step in the global carbon cycle initiating the mineralization of methane, isoprenes, and monoterpenes, the most abundant biologically produced hydrocarbons. Also, terpene-modifying enzymes have found many applications in the energy-economic biotechnological production of fine chemicals. Here, we describe a limonene dehydrogenase that was purified from the facultatively anaerobic betaproteobacterium Castellaniella defragrans 65Phen grown on monoterpenes under denitrifying conditions in the absence of molecular oxygen. The purified limonene:ferrocenium oxidoreductase activity hydroxylated the methyl group of limonene (1-methyl-4-(1-methylethenyl)-cyclohex-1-ene) yielding perillyl alcohol ([4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-en-1-yl]methanol). The enzyme had a DTT:perillyl alcohol oxidoreductase activity yielding limonene. Mass spectrometry and molecular size determinations revealed a heterodimeric enzyme comprising CtmA and CtmB. Recently, the two proteins had been identified by transposon mutagenesis and proteomics as part of the cyclic terpene metabolism (ctm) in C. defragrans and are annotated as FAD-dependent oxidoreductases of the protein domain family phytoene dehydrogenases and related proteins (COG1233). CtmAB is the first heterodimeric enzyme in this protein superfamily. Flavins in the purified CtmAB are oxidized by ferrocenium and are reduced by limonene. Heterologous expression of CtmA, CtmB, and CtmAB in Escherichia coli demonstrated that limonene dehydrogenase activity required both subunits, each carrying a flavin cofactor. Native CtmAB oxidized a wide range of monocyclic monoterpenes containing the allylic methyl group motif (1-methyl-cyclohex-1-ene). In conclusion, we have identified CtmAB as a hydroxylating limonene dehydrogenase and the first heteromer in a family of FAD-dependent dehydrogenases acting on allylic methylene or methyl CH-bonds. We suggest placing in Enzyme Nomenclature as new entry EC 1.17.99.8."
https://openalex.org/W2802203073,"Isomaltodextrin (IMD) is a novel dietary fiber-like polysaccharide: a type of α-glucan produced from starch using enzymes derived from microorganisms. The results of cohort studies show that dietary fiber can prevent cardiovascular disorders caused by lifestyle-related diseases such as metabolic syndrome. Inhibition of excess fat absorption by dietary fiber is known to be one of the mechanisms, and it is also known that the actions of dietary fiber vary depending on factors such as its structure or origin. Thus, we investigated the inhibitory actions of IMD on fat absorption, and analyzed its mechanism of action. In rats, the absorption of fat given by gavage was significantly lower at 1, 2, and 6 hours after IMD administration than after vehicle administration. In humans, IMD was associated with a lesser increase in blood triglycerides in subjects whose blood triglycerides were otherwise apt to rise. We also found by in vitro emulsion studies that IMD, which had no effect on digestive enzyme activity or emulsion formation, stabilized the micro size micelle by inducing enlarged micelle particle size and increased zeta potential. In conclusion, the mechanism of inhibition of fat absorption by IMD may be a delay in micelle particles accessing the intestinal epithelium through changes in the surface structure and the physical properties of the micelle particles."
https://openalex.org/W2801483496,"Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is reported to be a vascular inflammation marker providing prognostic information of vasculopathy. Until today, however, the effect of aldosterone or oxidative stress on the regulation of PTX3 is unknown. In present study, we investigated to find regulative factors, especially aldosterone and oxidative stress, on PTX3. Serum PTX3 levels were measured in 75 patients (45 male and 30 women, aged 55.1±13.4 year-old (mean±SD)) with various endocrine disorders including 47 with diabetes, 24 with primary aldosteronism (PA). All participants were free from cardio vascular diseases and diabetic retinopathy. Serum PTX3 level was significantly lower in patients with PA than without PA and was significantly higher in patients with diabetes than without diabetes. PTX3 was significantly correlated with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) (r = 0.431, P<0.001; r = 0.313, P = 0.009; r = -0.375, P = 0.004). A stepwise multiple regression analysis chose HbA1c and UAE as independent determinants of PTX3 (β = 0.282, P<0.001; β = 0.783, P<0.001). On the other hand, PTX3 was not significantly correlated with HbA1c and UAE but significantly negatively correlated with PAC in patients with diabetes. Therefore, it might be suggested that PTX3 is positively regulated by chronic hyperglycemia but negatively regulated by aldosterone, and is associated with urinary albumin excretion as a micro vasculopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2802261026,"Mycobacteria synthesize intracellular, 6-O-methylglucose-containing lipopolysaccharides (mGLPs) proposed to modulate bacterial fatty acid metabolism. Recently, it has been shown that Mycobacterium tuberculosis mGLP specifically induces a specific subset of protective γ9δ2 T cells. Mild base treatment, which removes all the base-labile groups, reduces the specific activity of mGLP required for induction of these T cells, suggesting that acylation of the saccharide moieties is required for γ9δ2 T-cell activation. On the basis of this premise, we used analytical LC/MS and NMR methods to identify and locate the acyl functions on the mGLP saccharides. We found that mGLP is heterogeneous with respect to acyl functions and contains acetyl, isobutyryl, succinyl, and octanoyl groups and that all acylations in mGLP, except for succinyl and octanoyl residues, reside on the glucosyl residues immediately following the terminal 3-O-methylglucose. Our analyses also indicated that the octanoyl residue resides at position 2 of an internal glucose toward the reducing end. LC/MS analysis of the residual product obtained by digesting the mGLP with pancreatic α-amylase revealed that the product is an oligosaccharide terminated by α-(1→4)-linked 6-O-methyl-d-glucosyl residues. This oligosaccharide retained none of the acyl groups, except for the octanoyl group, and was unable to induce protective γ9δ2 T cells. This observation confirmed that mGLP induces γ9δ2 T cells and indicated that the acylated glucosyl residues at the nonreducing terminus of mGLP are required for this activity."
https://openalex.org/W2802506641,"Watershed planning can lead to policy innovation and action toward environmental protection. However, groups often suffer from low engagement with communities that experience disparate impacts from flooding and water pollution. This can limit the capacity of watershed efforts to dismantle pernicious forms of social inequality. As a result, the benefits of environmental changes often flow to more empowered residents, short-changing the power of watershed-based planning as a tool to transform ecological, economic, and social relationships. The objectives of this paper are to assess whether the worldview of watershed planning actors are sufficiently attuned to local patterns of social vulnerability and whether locally significant patterns of social vulnerability can be adequately differentiated using conventional data sources. Drawing from 35 in-depth interviews with watershed planners and community stakeholders in the Milwaukee River Basin (WI, USA), we identify five unique definitions of social vulnerability. Watershed planners in our sample articulate a narrower range of social vulnerability definitions than other participants. All five definitions emphasize spatial and demographic characteristics consistent with existing ways of measuring social vulnerability. However, existing measures do not adequately differentiate among the spatio-temporal dynamics used to distinguish definitions. In response, we develop two new social vulnerability measures. The combination of interviews and demographic analyses in this study provides an assessment technique that can help watershed planners (a) understand the limits of their own conceptualization of social vulnerability and (b) acknowledge the importance of place-based vulnerabilities that may otherwise be obscured. We conclude by discussing how our methods can be a useful tool for identifying opportunities to disrupt social vulnerability in a watershed by evaluating how issue frames, outreach messages, and engagement tactics. The approach allows watershed planners to shift their own culture in order to consider socially vulnerable populations comprehensively."

In this study, we found a new crystal form of catechol oxidase from Aspergillus oryzae (AoCO4) and solved two new structures from two different crystals at 1.8-Å and at 2.5-Å resolutions. These structures showed different copper site forms (met/deoxy and deoxy) and also differed from the copper site observed in the previously solved structure of AoCO4. We also analysed the electron density maps of all of the 56 CBC enzyme structures available in the protein data bank (PDB) and found that many of the published structures have vague copper sites. Some of the copper sites were then re-refined to find a better fit to the observed electron density. General problems in the refinement of metalloproteins and metal centres are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2802088567,"We previously reported the microarray-based selection of three ovulation-related genes in zebrafish. We used a different selection method in this study, RNA sequencing analysis. An additional eight up-regulated candidates were found as specifically up-regulated genes in ovulation-induced samples. Changes in gene expression were confirmed by qPCR analysis. Furthermore, up-regulation prior to ovulation during natural spawning was verified in samples from natural pairing. Gene knock-out zebrafish strains of one of the candidates, the starmaker gene (stm), were established by CRISPR genome editing techniques. Unexpectedly, homozygous mutants were fertile and could spawn eggs. However, a high percentage of unfertilized eggs and abnormal embryos were produced from these homozygous females. The results suggest that the stm gene is necessary for fertilization. In this study, we selected additional ovulation-inducing candidate genes, and a novel function of the stm gene was investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2800822983,"The normal studies on air traffic departure scheduling problem (DSP) mainly deal with an independent airport in which the departure traffic is not affected by surrounded airports, which, however, is not a consistent case. In reality, there still exist cases where several commercial airports are closely located and one of them possesses a higher priority. During the peak hours, the departure activities of the lower-priority airports are usually required to give way to those of higher-priority airport. These giving-way requirements can inflict a set of changes on the modeling of departure scheduling problem with respect to the lower-priority airports. To the best of our knowledge, studies on DSP under this condition are scarce. Accordingly, this paper develops a bi-objective integer programming model to address the flight departure scheduling of the partly-restricted (e.g., lower-priority) one among several adjacent airports. An adapted tabu search algorithm is designed to solve the current problem. It is demonstrated from the case study of Tianjin Binhai International Airport in China that the proposed method can obviously improve the operation efficiency, while still realizing superior equity and regularity among restricted flows."
https://openalex.org/W2801293893,"Previous research has shown an age-related decline in Useful Field of View (UFOV) test performance, which measures the duration required to extract relevant information from a scene in three subtasks. However, these results are mostly based on data that may have been confounded by (age-related) ocular diseases. We examined UFOV performance in subjects aged 19.5 to 70.3 years to investigate how UFOV performance changes throughout adulthood. All subjects underwent a thorough ophthalmological examination to exclude ocular disorders. We also examined some elementary visual functions, i.e., near and far visual acuity, crowding and contrast sensitivity. We investigated whether these functions were related to age and whether they could explain a possible age-related decline in UFOV performance. The subjects (n = 41) performed very well on almost every measure and reached far better UFOV and visual acuity scores than those reported by other studies that relied on self-reported absence of ocular pathology. We did not find significant relationships between age and any of the elementary visual functions or the first two UFOV subtasks (R2UFOV1 = 0.03, p = 0.25; R2UFOV2 = 0.07, p = 0.10). However, we found an age-related decline in performance on the third UFOV subtask (R2UFOV3 = 0.36, p < 0.001), which was unrelated to performance on the elementary visual function tasks. Our results show that performance on the first two UFOV subtasks as well as central elementary visual functions may remain high in the absence of obvious ophthalmological pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2801692368,"While advances in laboratory automation has dramatically increased throughout of compound screening efforts, development of robust cell-based assays in relevant disease models remain resource-intensive and time-consuming, presenting a bottleneck to drug discovery campaigns. To address this issue, we present a modified gene trap approach to efficiently generate pathway-specific reporters that result in a robust ""on"" signal when the pathway of interest is inhibited. In this proof-of-concept study, we used vemurafenib and trametinib to identify traps that specifically detect inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in a model of BRAFV600E driven human malignant melanoma. We demonstrate that insertion of our trap into particular loci results in remarkably specific detection of MAPK pathway inhibitors over compounds targeting any other pathway or cellular function. The accuracy of our approach was highlighted in a pilot screen of ~6000 compounds where 40 actives were detected, including 18 MEK, 10 RAF, and 3 ERK inhibitors along with a few compounds representing previously under-characterized inhibitors of the MAPK pathway. One such compound, bafetinib, a second generation BCR/ABL inhibitor, reduced phosphorylation of ERK and when combined with trametinib, both in vitro and in vivo, reduced growth of vemurafenib resistant melanoma cells. While piloted in a model of BRAF-driven melanoma, our results set the stage for using this approach to rapidly generate reporters against any transcriptionally active pathway across a wide variety of disease-relevant cell-based models to expedite drug discovery efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2799978092,"Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease, with considerable genetic contribution. Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified a number of genomic regions for the risk of psoriasis. However, it is challenging to pinpoint the functional causal variants and then further decipher the genetic mechanisms underlying each region. In order to prioritize potential functional causal variants within psoriasis susceptibility regions, we integrated the genetic association findings and functional genomic data publicly available, i.e. histone modifications in relevant immune cells. We characterized a pervasive enrichment pattern of psoriasis variants in five core histone marks across immune cells/tissues. We discovered that genetic alleles within psoriasis association regions might influence gene expression levels through significantly affecting the binding affinities of 17 transcription factors. We established a catalog of 654 potential functional causal variants for psoriasis and suggested that they significantly overlapped with causal variants for autoimmune diseases. We identified potential causal variant rs79824801 overlay with the peaks of five histone marks in primary CD4+ T cells. Its alternative allele affected the binding affinity of transcription factor IKZF1. This study highlights the complex genetic architecture and complicated mechanisms for psoriasis. The findings will inform the functional experiment design for psoriasis."
https://openalex.org/W2801065522,"[18F]FAC (2’-deoxy-2’-[18F]fluoro-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, 1) is a versatile probe for imaging deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) expression levels in vivo. dCK is responsible for phosphorylation of deoxycytidine (dC, 2) and other nucleoside analogs, plays a key role in immune activation and has demonstrated to be one of the key enzymes in activating nucleoside based drugs including gemcitabine. Reported synthesis of [18F]FAC is high yielding but is quite challenging requiring bromination using HBr and careful drying of excess HBr which is critical for successful synthesis. Here in we report a simplified trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf) assisted synthesis of [18F]FAC eliminating the need of bromination and drying. [18F]FAC (β-anomer) was synthesized with average isolated decay corrected yield of 10.59 + 4.2% (n = 6) with radiochemical purity of >98% and total synthesis time of 158 + 19 min."
https://openalex.org/W2802114456,"Pyrrole-imidazole (Py–Im) polyamides are synthetic non-genotoxic minor groove-binding small molecules. We hypothesized that Py–Im polyamides can modulate the cellular response to ionizing radiation. Pre-treatment of cells with a Py-Im polyamide prior to exposure to ionizing radiation resulted in a delay in resolution of phosphorylated γ-H2AX foci, increase in XRCC1 foci, and reduced cellular replication potential. RNA-sequencing of cell lines exposed to the polyamide showed induction of genes related to the ultraviolet radiation response. We observed that the polyamide is almost 10-fold more toxic to a cell line deficient in DNA ligase 3 as compared to the parental cell line. Alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis reveals that the polyamide induces genomic fragmentation in the ligase 3 deficient cell line but not the corresponding parental line. The polyamide interferes directly with DNA ligation in vitro. We conclude that Py-Im polyamides may be further explored as sensitizers to genotoxic therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2801601300,"Fluoropyrimidines, including 5-fluororacil (5FU) and its pro-drug Capecitabine, are the common treatment for colorectal, breast, neck and head cancers—either as monotherapy or in combination therapy. Adverse reactions (ADRs) to the treatment are common and often result in treatment discontinuation or dose reduction. Factors contributing to ADRs, including genetic variation, are poorly characterized. We performed exome array analysis to identify genetic variants that contribute to adverse reactions. Our final dataset consisted of 504 European ancestry individuals undergoing fluoropyrimidine-based therapy for gastrointestinal cancer. A subset of 254 of these were treated with Capecitabine. All individuals were genotyped on the Illumina HumanExome Array. Firstly, we performed SNP and gene-level analyses of protein-altering variants on the array to identify novel associations the following ADRs, which were grouped into four phenotypes based on symptoms of diarrhea, mucositis, and neutropenia and hand-and-foot syndrome. Secondly, we performed detailed analyses of the HLA region on the same phenotypes after imputing the HLA alleles and amino acids. No protein-altering variants, or sets of protein-altering variants collapsed into genes, were associated with the main outcomes after Bonferroni correction. We found evidence that the HLA region was enriched for associations with Hand-and-Foot syndrome (p = 0.023), but no specific SNPs or HLA alleles were significant after Bonferroni correction. Larger studies will be required to characterize the genetic contribution to ADRs to 5FU. Future studies that focus on the HLA region are likely to be fruitful."
