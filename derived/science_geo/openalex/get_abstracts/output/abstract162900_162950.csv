https://openalex.org/W1989133472,"The dystrophin-associated protein complex (DPC) is required for the maintenance of muscle integrity during the mechanical stresses of contraction and relaxation. In addition to providing a membrane scaffold, members of the DPC such as the α-dystrobrevin protein family are thought to play an important role in intracellular signal transduction. To gain additional insights into the function of the DPC, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen for dystrobrevin-interacting proteins. Here we describe the identification of a dysbindin, a novel dystrobrevin-binding protein. Dysbindin is an evolutionary conserved 40-kDa coiled-coil-containing protein that binds to α- and β-dystrobrevin in muscle and brain. Dystrophin and α-dystrobrevin are co-immunoprecipitated with dysbindin, indicating that dysbindin is DPC-associated in muscle. Dysbindin co-localizes with α-dystrobrevin at the sarcolemma and is up-regulated in dystrophin-deficient muscle. In the brain, dysbindin is found primarily in axon bundles and especially in certain axon terminals, notably mossy fiber synaptic terminals in the cerebellum and hippocampus. These findings have implications for the molecular pathology of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and may provide an alternative route for anchoring dystrobrevin and the DPC to the muscle membrane.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy dystrophin-associated protein complex GenBank identifier neuromuscular junction neuronal nitric oxide synthase kilobase pair(s) 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid polymerase chain reaction Tris-buffered saline phosphate-buffered saline radioimmune precipitation assay Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)1 is the most common inherited muscle disease and is often associated with cognitive impairment. The DMD gene encodes dystrophin, a large membrane-associated protein that is expressed at highest levels in skeletal and cardiac muscle and in brain (1Blake D.J. Kroger S. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 92-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Dystrophin is a component of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DPC), a membrane-spanning oligomeric complex whose assembly is a prerequisite for normal muscle function (2Ozawa E. Yoshida M. Suzuki A. Mizuno Y. Hagiwara Y. Noguchi S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1711-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 3Straub V. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin.

The loss of the DPC from the sarcolemma reduces the mechanical stability of the membrane compromising muscle function and eventually leading to muscle degeneration (5Menke A. Jockusch H. Nature. 1991; 349: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 6Petrof B.J. Shrager J.B. Stedman H.H. Kelly A.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition to their mechanical roles, dystrophin and the DPC are also involved in intracellular signaling, transducing extracellular cues to the cytoskeleton. This process is thought to play in important role in the molecular pathology of muscular dystrophy (8Bredt D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E89-E91Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Recent experimental evidence has shown that α-dystrobrevin, a component of the DPC, may be involved in intracellular signaling (9Grady R.M. Grange R.W. Lau K.S. Maimone M.M. Nichol M.C. Stull J.T. Sanes J.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). α-Dystrobrevin-deficient mice develop mild muscular dystrophy without disturbing the assembly of the DPC at the sarcolemma and altering the structural integrity of the muscle fiber (9Grady R.M. Grange R.W. Lau K.S. Maimone M.M. Nichol M.C. Stull J.T. Sanes J.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). These mice have reduced levels of intracellular cGMP and have less neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) at the sarcolemma (9Grady R.M. Grange R.W. Lau K.S. Maimone M.M. Nichol M.C. Stull J.T. Sanes J.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The role of nNOS in the pathology of muscular dystrophy is unclear since similar alterations in nNOS have been described in α-syntrophin-deficient mice; however, these mice do not develop muscular dystrophy (10Kameya S.

The dystrobrevins are a family of dystrophin-related proteins that form, together with the syntrophins, the cytoplasmic component of the DPC. Two genes encode the dystrobrevins (11Wagner K.R.

A. 1998; 95: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). α-Dystrobrevin is expressed at high levels in cardiac and skeletal muscle and the brain. Three major α-dystrobrevin isoforms, α-dystrobrevin-1, -2, and -3, representing successive C-terminal truncations are expressed in muscle (13Sadoulet-Puccio H.M. Khurana T.S. Cohen J.B. Kunkel L.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 16Nawrotzki R. Loh N.Y. Ruegg M.A. Davies K.E. Blake D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2595-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α-Dystrobrevin-1 and -2 form complexes with dystrophin and the dystrophin-related protein utrophin in muscle. α-dystrobrevin-1 is concentrated at the NMJ, whereas α-dystrobrevin-2 is strongly expressed at the sarcolemma (16Nawrotzki R. Loh N.Y. Ruegg M.A. Davies K.E. Blake D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2595-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Peters M.F. Sadoulet-Puccio H.M. Grady M.R. Kramarcy N.R. Kunkel L.M. Sanes J.R. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1269-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The second gene β-dystrobrevin is not expressed in adult muscle, but forms DPC-like complexes with dystrophin and the dystrophin isoform Dp71 in neurons (18Blake D.J. Hawkes R. Benson M.A. Beesley P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 645-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). β-Dystrobrevin is enriched in the neuronal postsynaptic density along with dystrophin and is also found in axons and neuronal nuclei (18Blake D.J. Hawkes R. Benson M.A. Beesley P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 645-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The dystrobrevins are therefore a widely expressed family of binding partners for dystrophin, its isoforms, and the dystrophin-related protein utrophin. The dystrobrevins bind to the C terminus of dystrophin through a reciprocal coiled-coil interaction involving the first putative helix of both proteins (19Blake D.J. Tinsley J.M. Davies K.E. Knight A.E. Winder S.J. Kendrick-Jones J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 133-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20Sadoulet-Puccio H.M. Rajala M. Kunkel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12413-12418Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Dystrobrevin and dystrophin also bind directly to the syntrophin family of PDZ-containing proteins. This interaction is mediated by a short motif that is found in all dystrophin-related proteins and is adjacent to the first coiled-coil region (21Newey S.E. Benson M.A. Ponting C.P. Davies K.E. Blake D.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1295-1298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The PDZ domains of the syntrophin protein family bind to a variety of membrane-associated proteins, such as nNOS (22Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z.

To determine the functional role of the dystrobrevins in muscle and brain, we have performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify dystrobrevin-binding partners. In this paper, we describe the cloning and characterization of dysbindin, a 40-kDa coiled-coil-containing protein that binds to both α- and β-dystrobrevin in muscle and brain. The entire β-dystrobrevin coding region was amplified by PCR and cloned into theEcoRI/SalI sites of the bait plasmid pHybLex/Zeo (Invitrogen). Transforming this plasmid into S. cerevisaeL40 created a bait strain that was then co-transformed with an adult mouse brain cDNA library in pJG4–5 (Origene) or a mouse H2Kb-tsA58 myotube cDNA library in pYESTrp2 (26Newey S.E. Howman E.V. Ponting C.P. Benson M.A. Nawrotzki R. Loh N.Y. Davies K.E. Blake D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6645-6655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) as described elsewhere (27Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 5: 255-269Google Scholar). Potential interacting clones were identified by plating the transformation on minimal media lacking histidine, tryptophan, lysine, and uracil containing 5 mm3-aminotriazole and 300 μg/ml Zeocin. Yeast clones that grew on histidine-deficient media were assayed for β-galactosidase activity as per manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The α-syntrophin prey (amino acids 272–503) was made by cloning theSacI/EcoRI fragment from a mouse α-syntrophin cDNA clone into pYesTrp2. The Fos and Jun bait and prey control plasmids were supplied by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Prey plasmids were isolated from yeast and transformed by electroporation intoEscherichia coli XL1-Blue using standard methods. The 5′ and 3′ ends of each clone were sequenced using vector primers. The dysbindin cDNA sequence (EMBL accession no. AJ404859) was obtained by sequencing the largest cDNA clone (m10) identified in the screen (Fig.1 B). Protein sequence alignments were made using the program PSI-BLAST (28Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar), and coiled-coils were predicted using the program COILS (29Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar) using a window of 28 residues and no weighting. Mouse multiple tissue Northern blots were purchased from Origene and were hybridized with the m10 cDNA or a β-actin cDNA in Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The hybridized blots were processed as described previously (30Blake D.J. Love D.R. Tinsley J. Morris G.E. Turley H. Gatter K. Dickson G. Edwards Y.H. Davies K.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1992; 1: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were prepared for Western blotting by homogenizing fresh tissue or cells in SDS/urea buffer (4 m urea, 3.8% SDS, 20% glycerol, 75 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol). 40 μg of protein were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described previously (15Blake D.J. Nawrotzki R. Loh N.Y. Gorecki D.C. Davies K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Proteins were detected with the appropriate antibody using a BM chemiluminescence detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Blot densitometry was performed on radiographic film using an Alpha Imager and software (Alpha Innotech Corp.). The region encoding amino acids 196–352 was amplified by PCR, cloned into pET32(a) (Novagen), and transformed intoE. coli BL21(DE3) Gold (Stratagene). The fusion protein was purified using Talon resin (CLONTECH) as per manufacturer's instructions. The fusion partner was removed by thrombin digestion and affinity chromatography. The remaining protein was used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits using standard protocols. All antisera were immunoaffinity-purified as described previously (18Blake D.J. Hawkes R. Benson M.A. Beesley P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 645-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Antibody specificity was determined by pre-absorption of the m10CT-FP antisera diluted 1:25 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) with 100 μg/ml (2 μm) of the immunizing fusion protein for 1 h at room temperature. The pre-absorbed serum was used as described below. The dystrobrevin antibodies, β521 (which only detects β-dystrobrevin) and βCT-FP (which detects β-dystrobrevin and α-dystrobrevin-1 and -2), the anti-dystrophin antibody 2166, and the anti-utrophin antibody URD40 have been described elsewhere (15Blake D.J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 645-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The 9E10 monoclonal anti-Myc antibody was purchased from Covance. The anti-dystrobrevin monoclonal antibody, clone 23, was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. The anti-syntrophin monoclonal antibody SYN1351 was kindly provided by Prof. Stanley C. Froehner (31Froehner S.C. Murnane A.A. Tobler M. Peng H.B. Sealock R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1633-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The MANDRA1 anti-dystrophin monoclonal antibody was kindly supplied by Prof. Glenn Morris (32Nguyen T.M. Ginjaar I.B. van Ommen G.J. Morris G.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The mammalian expression constructs used in this study are listed in Table I. m10:pCIneo was made by cloning the entire dysbindin cDNA into theEcoRI/SalI sites of pCIneo. A c-Myc epitope tag was introduced into the N terminus dysbindin by PCR with the following primers; m10myc (5′-TGAATCATGGAGCAAAAGCTCATTTCTGAAGAGGACTTGCTGGAGACCCTGCGCGA) and m10–1310R (5′-ATCTCGAGCCATAAGCTTTATTGTGAGC). The 1.2-kb PCR product was subcloned into pCIneo to produce myc-m10:pCIneo. The BetaG expression construct and derivatives thereof (Table I) were made from a full-length β-dystrobrevin cDNA clone. BetaG was made by subcloning the entire β-dystrobrevin cDNA into theNotI site of pCIneo. The same insert was subcloned into theNotI site of pGEM-13Zf(+) to produce a recombinant intermediate plasmid (BetaG:pGEM13) that was used to make the following deletion constructs. BetaGΔH1 was made by digesting BetaG:pGEM13 withNheI, removing the 201-base pair stuffer fragment and re-circularizing. The insert from this plasmid was cloned into pCIneo. BetaGΔH1+2 was produced by digesting BetaG:pGEM13 withNheI and BstEII. The stuffer was removed and replaced with the annealed primers CC2F (5′-CTAGCGCTAAAGGAGGAAGAGCAAAAGCAGGCAGCTCAAGCCACAGG) and CC2R (5′-GTGACCCTGTGGCTTGAGCTGCCTGCTTTTGCTCTTCCTCCTTTAGCG). This sequence replaces the alternatively spliced “b-site” of β-dystrobrevin that is immediately adjacent to the second coiled-coil (15Blake D.J. Nawrotzki R. Loh N.Y. Gorecki D.C. Davies K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The insert was excised and subcloned into pCIneo. BetaGΔH2 was made by ligating the 201-base pair NheI fragment into the NheI site of BetaGΔH1+2. The α-dystrobrevin-1 expression construct m24:pCIneo was made by subcloning the 2.8-kbNotI/SpeI restriction fragment from m24 (12Blake D.J. Nawrotzki R. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Davies K.E. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab The protein encoded by β-dystrobrevin clone BetaG is 555 amino acids and corresponds to amino acids 1–579 of the published sequence (GI 6681235) but lacks the alternatively spliced amino acids (360) and (580). COS-7 cells were grown on glass coverslips and transfected with between 0.5 and 2 μg/3.5-cm2 well of plasmid DNA using Fugene-6 (Roche). After 24 h, the transfected cells were washed thoroughly in PBS, fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were washed thoroughly in PBS and blocked in 10% normal donkey serum. Primary antibodies were applied for 1 h at room temperature in PBS. After washing, the coverslips were incubated with the secondary antibody for an additional 1 h. After several washes, the coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and viewed under a Leica TCS confocal microscope. Images were captured using Leica TCS Powerscan software. Immunocytochemistry on frozen muscle sections was carried out as described previously (16Nawrotzki R. Loh N.Y. Ruegg M.A. Davies K.E. Blake D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2595-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sections were labeled with m10CT-FP at a dilution of 1:50 or βCT-FP at a dilution of 1:200 in TBS. Neuromuscular junctions were identified with Alexa 488-conjugated α-bungarotoxin (Molecular Probes). Double immunofluorescence on muscle sections was performed using 10-fold excess of Rhodamine Red-X-labeled donkey anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 fragments as described by the supplier (Jackson Immunoresearch). After extensive washing in TBS, the second antibody was applied as described above. Sections were examined by fluorescence microscopy using a Leica DMRE microscope or by confocal microscopy using a Leica TCS microscope. For brain immunocytochemistry, tissue was processed as described previously (18Blake D.J. Hawkes R. Benson M.A. Beesley P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 645-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Sections were cut at 10–20 μm in the transverse or sagittal planes, mounted on gelatin-coated slides, and stained with m10CT-FP at a dilution of 1:200. Indirect peroxidase immunocytochemistry was performed on the slide as described previously (36Armstrong C.L. Krueger-Naug A.M. Currie R.W. Hawkes R. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 416: 383-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Photomicrographs were captured with a SPOT Cooled Color digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc.) and assembled in Adobe Photoshop 4.0. The images were cropped and corrected for brightness and contrast but not otherwise manipulated. Fresh rat muscle and brain (2 g) were homogenized in CSK buffer (300 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, plus protease inhibitors (Sigma)). After incubation on ice for 30 min, the homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 141,000 ×g. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with 4 μg of m10CT-FP or 4 μg of the anti-dystrobrevin monoclonal antibody as described previously (18Blake D.J. Hawkes R. Benson M.A. Beesley P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 645-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were washed extensively in CSK buffer, eluted in SDS/urea buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting. For immunoprecipitation of heterologously expressed proteins, 2 × 106 COS-7 cells were co-transfected with 10 μg of myc-m10:pCIneo and 2 μg of the β-dystrobrevin-encoding plasmids (Table I) or 10 μg of m24:pCIneo using Fugene-6. After 24 h the cells were washed in PBS and lysed with 5 ml of RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2.5 mm EDTA, plus protease inhibitors). Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 30 min. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with either 4 μg of m10CT-FP or 4 μg of 9E10 as described above. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted in SDS/urea buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. In order to identify proteins that interact with the dystrobrevins in muscle and in the brain, yeast two-hybrid screens were performed with a bait plasmid containing the entire mouse β-dystrobrevin coding sequence. Approximately 6 × 105 and 2 × 106 independent transformants were screened from the mouse brain and H2K mouse myotube cDNA libraries, respectively. This screen resulted in the isolation of 10 clones from the brain library and 52 clones from the muscle library. End sequencing of these clones revealed that four and nine clones from each library were derived from the same gene. To reflect the binding capabilities of the protein encoded by these cDNA clones, we have named this protein dysbindin. Several dysbindin cDNAs were also identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen of the H2K library using α-dystrobrevin-2 as a bait. In addition, the two-hybrid screens identified all the known dystrobrevin-binding proteins, dystrophin, utrophin, and the syntrophins, confirming the efficacy of the technique. Interestingly, no clones encoding signaling proteins such as kinases and guanine nucleotide exchange factors were identified in any of the screens. The specificity of the protein:protein interactions in yeast was confirmed by co-transforming different bait and prey plasmids (Fig. 1 A). Dysbindin interacts with both and β- and α-dystrobrevin-2 but does not trans-activate reporter gene expression when co-transformed with the empty bait plasmid pYesTrp2. In control experiments, β-dystrobrevin also interacted with the C terminus of α-syntrophin an interaction that is known to occur physiologically (37Ahn A.H. Kunkel L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 38Dwyer T.M. Froehner S.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The transcription factors Fos and Jun were used as additional positive control for interacting proteins while the empty bait and prey vectors failed to transactivate reporter gene expression when co-transformed (Fig. 1 A). The yeast two-hybrid system identified several similar clones that were sequenced (Fig. 1 B). The largest clone m10 was 1.4 kb and had a poly(A) tail at the 3′ end. The complete sequence of the m10 cDNA and the deduced amino acid sequence is shown in Fig.2 A. The m10 cDNA encodes dysbindin, a protein of 352 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 39.7 kDa and a pI of 4.6. To determine whether dysbindin was part of previously characterized protein family and to identify any known domains, an unfiltered PSI-BLAST data base search (28Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) was initiated. Two proteins in the data base were found to be significantly similar to dysbindin. These are the human hypothetical protein CAB83042 (E-value, 3e-20) and the Drosophila predicted protein CG6856 (E-value, 2e-19). The sequence similarity between dysbindin and these proteins is depicted in Fig. 2 B. The percentage sequence identities between dysbindin and CAB3042 and CG6856 are 45.5% over 135 amino acids and 31.5% over 211 amino acids, respectively. CAB83042 encodes a dysbindin-related protein that has been described in several unpublished cDNA sequencing projects (GI 7689032, uncharacterized hypothalamus protein HSMNP1; GI 7340749, hypothetical protein STRAIT; GI 7020689, unnamed protein encoded by KAT10570). In addition to these proteins, dysbindin orthologues are present in Danio rerio and Xenopus laevis. No documented protein domains were identified in dysbindin however, computer-aided sequence analysis demonstrated that dysbindin contains a predicted coiled-coil region between amino acids 88 and 177 (Fig. 2 C). This prediction is also true of the proposed Drosophila orthologue of dysbindin, CG6856 (Fig. 2 C). An alternatively spliced cDNA (m3) corresponding to a deletion of amino acids 171–222 was also identified in the two-hybrid screen. This clone interacts robustly with dystrobrevin (Fig. 1 B). It is possible that the expression of this splice variant gives rise to the additional lower molecular weight band seen on Western blots (Fig.3 B). To determine the expression pattern of the dysbindin transcript, a multiple tissue Northern blot was hybridized with the complete m10 cDNA clone. A 1.4-kb transcript was detected at varying levels in all of the tissues examined (Fig. 3 A, upper panel). The highest levels of dysbindin expression were in testes, liver, kidney, brain, heart, and lung. The dysbindin mRNA is also expressed in skeletal muscle and in the stomach and small intestine, two tissues that contain significant amounts of smooth muscle. Hybridization of the same blot with a β-actin cDNA probe showed that each lane contains similar amounts of mRNA (Fig.3 A, lower panel). To determine the tissue distribution of dysbindin, an antibody (m10CT-FP) was raised against the last 156 amino acids of the protein. The anti-dysbindin antibody was affinity-purified and used for Western blotting. A 50-kDa protein is detected at varying levels in all the tissues examined (Fig. 3 B). Dysbindin is resolved as a protein doublet in the different tissues presumably reflecting alternative splicing within the gene (see above). The doublet is only resolved on shorter exposures or when longer electrophoresis times are used. The relative mobility of dysbindin expressed in COS-7 cells is identical to the protein detected with m10CT-FP detected in the tissue extracts (Fig. 3 B). The high relative mobility of dysbindin is probably due to the content of acidic amino acids in the primary sequence. To determine whether dysbindin binds directly to the dystrobrevins and other members of the dystrophin protein family, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with myc-m10:pCIneo in combination with other expression constructs encoding dystrophin-related proteins and mutants thereof (Table I). Prior to these studies, the cellular distribution of β-dystrobrevin and dysbindin was determined in cells transfected with only the cognate plasmids. β-Dystrobrevin is located in intensely staining punctae distributed throughout the cell (Fig. 4 A). β-Dy"

Here, we describe human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines that differ in the responsiveness to the topoisomerase-2 inhibitors VP16 (20 μM) and doxorubicin (0.3 μM): Highly sensitive BxPC-3 and PT45-P1 cells, and Capan-1 and A818-4 cells that were almost resistant to both anti cancer drugs. VP16, but not doxorubicin, transiently induced NF-κB activity in all cell lines, whereas basal NF-κB binding was nearly undetectable in BxPc-3 and PT45-P1 cells, but rather high in Capan-1 and A818-4 cells, as demonstrated by gel-shift and luciferase assays. Treatment with various NF-κB inhibitors (Gliotoxin, MG132 and Sulfasalazine), or transfection with the IκBα super-repressor, strongly enhanced the apoptotic effects of VP16 or doxorubicin on resistant Capan-1 and 818-4 cells. Our results indicate that under certain conditions the resistance of pancreatic carcinoma cells to chemotherapy is due to their constitutive NF-κB activity rather than the transient induction of NF-κB by some anti-cancer drugs. Blockade of basal NF-κB activity by well established drugs efficiently reduces chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer cells and offers the potential for improved therapeutic strategies."

https://openalex.org/W2016237448,"Rearrangements of the human ALL-1 gene are frequently encountered in acute lymphocytic leukemias (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemias (AML). These rearrangements are mostly due to chromosome translocations and result in production of chimeric proteins composed of the N-terminal fragment of ALL-1 and the C-terminal segments of the partner proteins. The most common chromosome translocation involving ALL-1 is the t(4 : 11) associated with ALL. ALL-1 is the human homologue of Drosophila trithorax and directly activates transcription of multiple Hox genes. A preliminary DNA microarray screen indicated that the Meis1, HoxA9 and AC133 genes were overexpressed in ALLs with t(4 : 11), compared to ALLs with very similar phenotype but without the chromosomal abnormality. These genes, as well as additional five Hox genes, were subjected to comprehensive semi-quantitative or quantitative RT-PCR analysis in 57 primary ALL and AML tumors. Meis1 and HoxA9 were found expressed in 13/14 of ALLs with the t(4 : 11) and in 8/8 of AMLs with ALL-1 rearrangements. The two genes were not consistently transcribed in other types of ALL. AC133 was transcribed in 13/14 of ALLs with t(4 : 11), but in only 4/8 of AMLs with ALL-1 rearrangements. HoxA10 was expressed in most leukemias with ALL-1 alterations, but was also transcribed in PrePreB CD10(-) ALLs lacking the t(4 : 11). Expression of HoxA5, HoxA7, HoxC8 and HoxC10 did not correlate with ALL-1 rearrangements. Coexpression of Meis1 and HoxA9, overexpression of HoxA10, and overexpression or fusion of HoxA9 were previously implicated in certain acute myeloid leukemias in mice and humans. The present work suggests that upregulation of Meis1, HoxA9, and possibly HoxA10 might also play a role in pathogenesis of acute lymphocytic and acute myeloid leukemias associated with ALL-1 fusions."
https://openalex.org/W1970941955,"The INK4a/ARF locus which is frequently inactivated in human tumours encodes two different tumour suppressive proteins, p16(INK4a) and ARF. p16(INK4a) is a major component of the RB pathway. ARF is part of an ARF-mdm2-p53 network that exerts a negative control on hyperproliferative signals emanating from oncogenic stimuli. Among these is the transcription factor E2F1, a final effector of the RB pathway, that induces ARF expression. Recent data suggest that ARF function is not restricted to the p53 pathway. However, ARF target(s) implicated in this p53-independent function remains to be identified. We show that ARF is able to inhibit the proliferation of human cell lines independently of their p53 status. In this context, we demonstrate that ARF interacts physically with E2F1 and inhibits its transcriptional activity. Moreover, we show that mdm2 is required for the modulation of E2F1 activity by ARF. Beside the well-known p53 and mdm2 partners, these results identify E2F1 as a new ARF target. Thus, ARF can be viewed as a dual-acting tumour suppressor protein in both the p53 and RB pathways, further emphasizing its role in tumour surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2069295237,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleitrophic cytokine that not only regulates growth and differentiation of many cell types, but also induces production of acute phase proteins (AAP) in hepatocytes. Our previous works have demonstrated that both PI 3-K/Akt and STAT3 pathways were concomitantly activated and cooperatively mediated the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-6. This investigation reports that IL-6 protected cells against apoptosis induced by a variety of agents including, TGF-beta, UV and retinoic acid (RA) in Hep3B cells, suggesting that IL-6 is a fundamental determinant of hepatic cell survival. Mcl-1, but not other Bcl-2 family members, was rapidly up-regulated by IL-6, with a peak (approximately 3-4-fold) appearing at 4 h. Transient transfection of cells with a mcl-1 antisense vector, resulting in a 50-60% reduction of the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-6, indicating that Mcl-1 is a downstream effector of IL-6. Which signaling pathway transduced by IL-6 responsible for the Mcl-1 up-regulation was further investigated. In Hep3B cells, the JAK/STAT3, ERK, and PI 3-K/Akt pathways were activated by IL-6 stimulation. Blocking JAK/STAT3 activation with a dominant-negative mutant STAT3F or a JAK inhibitor AG490 could not influence IL-6-mediated Mcl-1 up-regulation. Similarly, PD98059 treatment, a MEK specific inhibitor, also failed to inhibit Mcl-1 expression. However, the IL-6-induced Mcl-1 up-regulation was effectively attenuated in the presence of PI 3-K inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin. Expression of dominant-negative Akt, but not Etk, could abrogate the IL-6-induced increase of Mcl-1. In conclusion, our results suggest that the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-6 is mediated, at least in part, by Mcl-1 expression and that is mainly through the PI 3-K/ Akt-dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2312485874,"In this study, we examined the effect of the stable expression of Smad7 in two different cell lines on apoptosis induced by various stimuli including TGF-β, serum withdrawal, loss of cell adhesion (anoikis) and TNF-α. Smad7 increased TGF-β-mediated apoptosis in Mv1Lu cells as well as anoikis and/or serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis in Mv1Lu and MDCK cells. Smad7 markedly decreased the activity of the survival NF-κB transcription factor in MDCK cells. Interestingly, the stable expression of oncogenic Ras in MDCK cells which suppressed Smad7 inhibition of NF-κB also suppressed Smad7 potentiation of serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis and anoikis. In addition, Smad7 inhibited TNF-α stimulation of NF-κB and increased TNF-α-mediated apoptosis in MDCK cells. Our results provide the first evidence that Smad7 induces sensitization of cells to different forms of cell death. They moreover demonstrate that Smad7 inhibits the survival NF-κB factor, providing a potential mechanism whereby Smad7 potentiates cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2102058303,"The factors that govern the progression from colonic adenomatous polyp to colon cancer are poorly understood. The observation that NSAIDs act as chemopreventative agents and reduce the size of colonic polyps suggests the involvement of inflammatory signalling, but inflammatory signalling in colonic polyps has not been studied. We investigated the expression of the active forms of NF-kappaB, JNK and p38 MAPK using immunohistochemistry with activation specific antibodies in human colonic adenomas. We show that active NF-kappaB is seen in stromal macrophages that also express COX-2 and TNF-alpha, active JNK is seen in stromal and intraepithelial T-lymphocytes and periendothelial cells of new blood vessels, and active p38 MAPK is most highly expressed in macrophages and other stromal cells. These results demonstrate the presence of active inflammatory signal transduction in colonic polyps and that these are predominantly in the stroma. In the case of NF-kappaB this coincides with the cellular localisation of COX-2. These results support evidence that NSAIDs may act through effects on stromal cells rather than epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1966302635,"4p16.3 has previously been identified as a region of non-random LOH in transitional cell carcinoma, suggesting the presence of a tumour suppressor gene. One candidate within this region is fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). Germline mutations in FGFR3 are known to cause several autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasias, the severity of which depends on the position and nature of the mutation in the protein. We investigated the frequency and nature of FGFR3 mutations in a panel of transitional cell carcinomas and cell lines and studied the possible link between mutation and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on 4p16.3. FGFR3 coding sequence from 63 transitional cell carcinomas (TCC) of various stages and grades, and 18 cell lines was analysed by fluorescent SSCP. Samples with abnormal migration patterns were sequenced to identify the mutation or polymorphism. Thirty-one of the 63 tumours had previously been assessed to have LOH at 4p16.3. Twenty-six of the 63 tumours (41%) and 4/18 (22%) of the cell lines had missense mutations in FGFR3. All mutations detected in our panel have been reported in the germline where all apart from one cause lethal conditions. One tumour contained K652Q which has recently been identified in less severe cases of skeletal dysplasia. Tumours with and without LOH at 4p16.3 had mutations in FGFR3 suggesting that these two events are not causally linked. The frequency of FGFR3 mutation indicates that this protein plays an important role in TCC."
https://openalex.org/W1985439299,"The adapter Grb2 is an important mediator of normal cell proliferation and oncogenic signal transduction events. It consists of a central SH2 domain flanked by two SH3 domains. While the binding specificities of the Grb2 SH2 and N-terminal SH3 domain [Grb2 SH3(N)] have been studied in detail, binding properties of the Grb2 SH3(C) domain remained poorly defined. Gab1, a receptor tyrosine kinase substrate which associates with Grb2 and the c-Met receptor, was previously shown to bind Grb2 via a region which lacks a Grb2 SH3(N)-typical motif (P-x-x-P-x-R). Precipitation experiments with the domains of Grb2 show now that Gab1 can bind stably to the Grb2 SH3(C) domain. For further analyses, Gab1 mutants were generated by PCR to test in vivo residues thought to be crucial for Grb2 SH3(C) binding. The Grb2 SH3(C) binding region of Gab1 has significant homology to a region of the adapter protein SLP-76. Peptides corresponding to epitopes SLP-76, Gab1, SoS and other proteins with related sequences, as well as mutant peptides were synthesized and analysed by tryptophan-fluorescence spectrometry and by in vitro competition experiments. These experiments define a 13 amino acid sequence with the unusual consensus motif P-x-x-x-R-x-x-K-P as required for a stable binding to the SH3(C) domain of Grb2. Additional analyses point to a distinct binding specificity of the Grb2-homologous adapter protein Mona (Gads), indicating that the proteins of the Grb2 adapter family may have partially overlapping, yet distinct protein binding properties."

Although Ku80 was recently proposed as a caretaker gene involved in the control of genome integrity, no data are available on Ku70/80 DNA-binding activity in human tumors. Heterodimer DNA-binding activity and protein expression were assayed by electrophoretic-mobility-shift-assay (EMSA) and Western blot analysis, in nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from eight breast, seven bladder primary tumors and three metastatic nodes from breast cancers. Corresponding normal tissues of the same patients were used as controls. Ten out of 15 tumors showed nuclear Ku-binding activity 3–10 times higher than in the normal tissues, irrespective of bladder or breast origin. Conversely, in 5/15 primary tumors and in all the metastatic nodes analysed, nuclear Ku-activity was 1.5–4.5-fold lower than in the corresponding normal tissues. Cytoplasmic heterodimer activity significantly differed between tumor and normal tissues, displaying a 2–10-fold increase in neoplastic tissues. Three different patterns combining both Ku expression and activity with tumor characteristics were identified. In low aggressive breast tumors p70/p80 proteins were expressed in tumor but not in normal tissues. The heterodimer binding-activity matched the protein levels. In non-invasive bladder carcinomas no significant differences in protein expression between tumor and the corresponding normal tissues were found, however heterodimer binding-activity was increased in tumor samples. In breast and bladder tumors, at the advanced stage and in node metastases, the binding activity was strongly reduced in tumor biopsies, however no differences were demonstrated between normal and tumor protein levels. Our results suggest a different modulation of Ku70/80 DNA-binding activity in human neoplastic tissues, possibly related to tumor progression. Findings provide further data on tissue-specific protein expression and post-translational regulation of heterodimer activity."
https://openalex.org/W2334140530,"The gene Tousled of Arabidopsis Thaliana encodes a protein kinase which, when mutated, results in abnormal flower development. From a library of mRNAs that are translationally upregulated by overexpression of the translation initiation factor 4E, we identified a mammalian Tousled Like kinase (TLK1B). The human TLK1B mRNA contains a 5′UTR 1088-nt-long with two upstream AUG codons, and was found to be very inhibitory for translation. The TLK1B protein localizes almost exclusively to the nuclei. TLK1B overexpression in mammalian cells rendered them more resistant to ionizing radiation (IR). Purified TLK1B phosphorylated histone H3 at S10 with high specificity both in a mix of core histones and in isolated chromatin, suggesting that histone H3 is a physiological substrate for TLK1B. Moreover, overexpression of TLK1B in transfected cells resulted in a higher degree of H3 phosphorylation. Expression of TLK1B in a yeast strain that harbors a temperature-sensitive mutation of the major H3 kinase, Ipl1, complemented the growth defect; restored normal levels of histone H3 phosphorylation; and increased their resistance to IR. Phosphorylation of H3 has been linked to the activation of the immediate-early genes upon mitogenic stimulation, and to chromatin condensation during mitotic/meiotic events. A possible role for TLK1B in radioprotection is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1992115246,"p73 is a member of the p53 family. Recent studies have shown that DNA damage can stabilize p73 protein and enhance p73-mediated apoptosis in a c-Abl dependent manner. To determine what regulates p73 transcriptionally, we analysed the expression of p73 in several cell lines following genotoxic stresses. We found that p73 is induced in certain cell lines when treated with therapeutic DNA damaging agents. We also found that p53 and p73, but not mutant p53(R249S) and p73β292, directly induce the expression of the p73 gene. In addition, we found one potential p53-binding site in the promoter of the p73 gene. This binding site is responsive to p53, p73, and DNA damage. Taken together, these data suggest that p73 is transcriptionally regulated by DNA damage and p53, and is autoregulated."

By use of immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (IP/WB), we now show that ARF physically associates with topoisomerase I (Topo I). ARF-Topo I immune complexes were detected in SF9 insect cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses encoding the two genes as well as in 293 cells that express endogenously these proteins. Preparations of a GST-ARF recombinant protein stimulated the DNA relaxation activity of Topo I but, in contrast, had no effect on the decatenation activity of Topo II. The Topo I stimulation was also detected in cell extracts of SF9 cells expressing both proteins. A confocal microscopy study indicated that part of ARF and Topo I colocalized in the granular component structure of the nucleolus. As a whole, our data indicate that Topo I is a new partner of ARF and suggest that ARF is involved in cell reactions that require Topo I."
https://openalex.org/W1992107055,"Cyclin A/cdk2 is active during S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, but its regulation and function during G2 phase is poorly understood. In this study we have examined the regulation of cyclin A/cdk2 activity during normal G2 phase progression and in genotoxin-induced G2 arrest. We show that cyclin A/cdk2 is activated in early G2 phase by a cdc25 activity. In the G2 phase checkpoint arrest initiated in response to various forms of DNA damage, the cdc25-dependent activation of both cyclin A/cdk2 and cyclin B1/cdc2 is blocked. Ectopic expression of cdc25B, but not cdc25C, in G2 phase arrested cells efficiently activated both cyclin A/cdk2 and cyclin B1/cdc2. Finally, we demonstrate that the block in cyclin A/cdk2 activation in the G2 checkpoint arrest is independent of ATM/ATR. We speculate that the ATM/ATR-independent block in G2 phase cyclin A/cdk2 activation may act as a further layer of checkpoint control, and that blocking G2 phase cyclin A/cdk2 activation contributes to the G2 phase checkpoint arrest."
https://openalex.org/W2323447901,"PSA is an oncodevelopmental antigen usually expressed in human tumors with high metastatic potential. Here we set up a metastatic model in nude mice by using TE671 cells, which strongly express PSA-NCAM. We observed the formation of lung metastases when TE671 cells were injected intravenously, intramuscularly, and intraperitoneously, but not subcutaneously. Intraperitoneous injections also induced peritoneal carcinosis, ascites, and liver metastases. To evaluate the putative role of PSA in the metastatic process we used a specific cleavage of PSA on NCAM by endoneuraminidase-N on intraperitoneous primary tumors. Mice with primary intramuscular tumors were taken as control. Repeated injections of endoneuraminidase-N led to a decrease in PSA expression in primary intraperitoneous nodules and ascites but not in intramuscular primary tumors. Endoneuraminidase-N also increased the delay in ascitic formation and decreased the number of lung or liver metastases in the case of intraperitoneous tumors but not in the case of intramuscular tumors. When metastases occurred in endoneuraminidase-N injected animals, they strongly expressed PSA-NCAM. Therefore, we established a relationship between PSA expression on the surface of primary tumor cells and the metastatic process."
https://openalex.org/W2331541144,"Cytogenetic, molecular and functional analysis has shown that chromosome region 6q27 harbors a senescence inducing gene and a tumor suppressor gene involved in several solid and hematologic malignancies. We have cloned at 6q27 and characterized the RNASE6PL gene which belongs to a family of cytoplasmic RNases highly conserved from plants, to man. Analysis of 55 primary ovarian tumors and several ovarian tumor cell lines indicated that the RNASE6PL gene is not mutated in tumor tissues, but its expression is significantly reduced in 30% of primary ovarian tumors and in 75% of ovarian tumor cell lines. The promoter region of the gene was unaffected in tumors cell lines. Transfection of RNASE6PL cDNA into HEY4 and SG10G ovarian tumor cell lines suppressed tumorigenicity in nude mice. When tumors were induced by RNASE6PL-transfected cells, they completely lacked expression of RNASE6PL cDNA. Tumorigenicity was suppressed also in RNASE6PL-transfected pRPcT1/H6cl2T cells, derived from a human/mouse monochromosomic hybrid carrying a human chromosome 6 deleted at 6q27. Moreover, 63.6% of HEY4 clones and 42.8% of the clones of XP12ROSV, a Xeroderma pigmentosum SV40-immortalized cell line, transfected with RNASE6PL cDNA, developed a marked senescence process during in vitro growth. We therefore propose that RNASE6PL may be a candidate for the 6q27 senescence inducing and class II tumor suppressor gene in ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1994486114,"Cyclins are one of the pivotal determinants regulating cell cycle progression. We previously reported that the trans-activator Tax of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) induces endogenous cyclin D2 expression along with cell cycle progression in a resting human T-cell line, Kit 225, suggesting a role of cyclin D2 in Tax-mediated cell cycle progression. The cyclin D2 gene has a typical E2F binding element, raising the possibility that induction of cyclin D2 expression is a consequence of cell cycle progression. In this study, we examined the role and molecular mechanism of induction of the endogenous human cyclin D2 gene by Tax. Introduction of p19INK4d, a cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor of the INK4 family specific for D-type CDK, inhibited Tax-mediated activation of E2F, indicating requirement of D-type CDK in Tax-mediated activation of E2F. Previously indicated E2F binding element and two NF-κB-like binding elements in the 1.6 kbp cyclin D2 promoter fragment had little, if any, effect on responsiveness to Tax. We found that trans-activation of the cyclin D2 promoter by Tax was mainly mediated by a newly identified NF-κB-like element with auxiliary contribution of a CRE-like element residing in sequences downstream of −444 which were by themselves sufficient for trans-activation by Tax. These results indicate that Tax directly trans-activates the cyclin D2 gene, resulting in growth promotion and perhaps leukemogenesis through activation of D-type CDK."

Two forms of mouse CAR, which differ only at the C terminus, and which most likely result from alternative splicing, have both been shown to function in virus infection (4Bergelson J.M. Krithivas A.

A growing number of basolateral sorting signals have been identified that have no sequence similarities to any of these motifs (24Hobert M.E. Kil S.J. Medof M.E. Carlin C.R. J. Biol.

In addition, interaction between membrane proteins with hydrophobic C-terminal peptides and scaffolding proteins containing PDZ domains (reviewed in Ref. 27Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Clin.

Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar).When expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, hCAR is localized exclusively to the basolateral surface, as it is in airway epithelium (10Pickles R.J. Fahrner J.A. Petrella J.M. Boucher R.C. Bergelson J.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6050-6057Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). GPI-anchored hCAR, and hCAR from which the cytoplasmic domain has been deleted (tailless hCAR), are expressed on both the apical and basolateral surfaces of transfected MDCK cells, consistent with our overall view that CAR basolateral targeting depends on sequences within the cytoplasmic domain.We have examined the expression of CAR mutants with successive truncations of the cytoplasmic domain, as well as of CAR with mutations that ablate a potential PDZ interaction motif and a putative tyrosine-based sorting signal. In addition, we have studied the targeting of the two mouse isoforms of CAR, one of which has a C-terminal amino acid sequence distinctly different from that of both human CAR and the other mouse isoform. The results suggest that multiple regions within the CAR cytoplasmic domain contain information that is necessary for basolateral targeting.DISCUSSIONPrevious work demonstrated that wild-type hCAR is sorted solely to the basolateral membrane of polarized MDCK cells, and that essential sorting information is contained within the CAR cytoplasmic domain (10Pickles R.J. Fahrner J.A. Petrella J.M. Boucher R.C. Bergelson J.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6050-6057Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In these experiments we have delineated CAR sequences involved in basolateral sorting. Our data suggest that multiple regions within the CAR cytoplasmic domain are required for basolateral targeting. The amino acids YNQV, beginning at amino acid 318, comprise a previously described basolateral sorting signal, and changing the tyrosine within this motif led to apical expression of hCAR. Deletion or mutation of the sequence LSRMG between residues 345 and 349 led to apical expression of hCAR, indicating that these amino acids may also be a distinct sorting motif. There also appears to be additional sorting information contained between residues 261 and 315 that functions independently of these other potential signals.We found that the deletion of a putative PDZ interaction motif (SIV) from the hCAR C terminus did not alter the exclusively basolateral expression pattern, indicating that interaction with PDZ proteins is not essential for basolateral sorting of hCAR. This contrasts with evidence that C-terminal PDZ interaction motifs (with the consensus sequence (T/S)X-hydrophobic) are involved in polarized expression of such proteins as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (29Moyer B.D. Denton J. Karlson K.H. Reynolds D. Wang S. Mickle J.E. Milewski M. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Li M. Stanton B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and the receptor tyrosine kinase let 23 (33). However, our results are similar to those obtained with the γ-aminobutyric acid transporter BGT-1, in which deletion of a PDZ-interacting motif did not prevent localization to the basolateral membranes of MDCK cells despite the motif's function as a retention signal (34Perego C. Vanoni C. Villa A. Longhi R. Kaech S.M. Frohli E. Hajnal A. Kim S.K. Pietrini G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2384-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It is likely that CAR's PDZ recognition motif is important for interaction with other cellular proteins, but these interactions do not drive the polarization of CAR expression.An examination of the cytoplasmic domain of hCAR does not reveal other known sorting signals. Nevertheless, there is likely to be additional targeting information contained within the cytoplasmic domain. Tailless hCAR was expressed in equal amounts on the apical and basolateral membranes of polarized MDCK cells. In contrast, mutant YSK315, which lacks approximately half the cytoplasmic domain and contains neither tyrosine residue 318 nor the potential basolateral sorting sequence LSRMG between amino acids 345 and 349, was preferentially, but not exclusively, distributed to the basolateral surface. This suggests that other basolateral sorting information is contained within the proximal half of the hCAR cytoplasmic domain. Although these regions are distant from each other in the linear amino acid sequence of hCAR, they may be in close proximity with one another in the tertiary structure of this protein. Therefore, deletion or mutation of any one of these regions may impair the interaction of the hCAR cytoplasmic domain with cellular sorting machinery.For some proteins, such as the low density lipoprotein and epidermal growth factor receptors (18Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 24Hobert M.E. Kil S.J. Medof M.E. Carlin C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32901-32909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), deletion of basolateral targeting determinants within the cytoplasmic domain results in expression that is almost exclusively apical, perhaps because of strong apical sorting determinants in the transmembrane or extracellular domains. In contrast, deletion of the entire CAR cytoplasmic domain resulted in an equal distribution of tailless CAR on the apical and basolateral surfaces, and even GPI-anchored CAR showed significant basolateral expression; these results suggest that the CAR extracellular domain does not contain strong apical sorting signals.There are two isoforms of murine CAR: the cytoplasmic domain of mCAR1 is nearly identical to that of hCAR; mCAR2 differs from hCAR and mCAR1 at the C terminus (2Tomko R.P. Xu R. Philipson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3352-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 4Bergelson J.M. Krithivas A. Celi L. Droguett G. Horwitz M.S. Wickham T. Crowell R.L. Finberg R.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 415-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To see if these differences in the cytoplasmic domain affected the targeting of these receptors, we constructed chimeric receptors containing the extracellular portion of hCAR fused to the cytoplasmic domains of the two mCAR isoforms. This was necessary, because the anti-CAR monoclonal antibody RmcB recognizes the extracellular region of hCAR, but not of mCAR. Like hCAR, both mouse isoforms were targeted exclusively to the basolateral membrane of polarized MDCK monolayers. We found that deletion of 21 residues from the C terminus of hCAR interfered with basolateral sorting; these residues are not present in mCAR2, which lacks 26 C-terminal residues present in hCAR and mCAR1 but which nonetheless is sorted to the basolateral surface. The mCAR2 C terminus must contain sorting information that compensates for loss of information from mCAR1, even though its sequence is quite dissimilar.CAR's role in virus infection is well established, but its cellular function remains to be determined. Recent evidence suggests that CAR may be involved in homotypic cell adhesion (35Honda T. Saitoh H. Masuko M. Katagiri-Abe T. Tominaga K. Kozakai I. Kobayashi K. Kumanishi T. Watanabe Y.G. Odani S. Kuwano R. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 77: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). It is concentrated at sites of cell-cell contact in both polarized (10, present study) and non-polarized cells. 2C. Cohen and J Bergelson, unpublished observations. Consistent with this, CAR's N-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain forms a homodimer, and residues at the homodimer interface are more highly conserved in evolution than is the rest of the extracellular domain (6van Raaij, M. J., Chouin, E., van der Zandt, H., Bergelson, J. M., and Cusack, S. (2000) 8, 1147–1155.Google Scholar).The CAR cytoplasmic domain shows greater sequence conservation than does the extracellular domain. At the C terminus, 23 of 23 residues are identical in human and zebrafish CAR.3 This sequence conservation most likely reflects conservation of biological function. We find that information required for basolateral sorting is present within this highly conserved region; although the implicated sequences are absent from CAR's variant isoform, the basolateral targeting is preserved. These observations suggest that expression at the basolateral surface of polarized epithelium may be important to CAR's primary function. The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR)1 mediates attachment and infection by coxsackie B viruses as well as by many human adenoviruses (1Bergelson J.M. Cunningham J.A. Droguett G.

Human CAR (hCAR) is a 46-kDa cell surface glycoprotein composed of an extracellular region with two immunoglobulin-like domains, a typical hydrophobic transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain of 107 amino acids. A murine homolog of the human receptor has also been characterized (2Tomko R.P. Xu R. Philipson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We found that deletion of 21 residues from the C terminus of hCAR interfered with basolateral sorting; these residues are not present in mCAR2, which lacks 26 C-terminal residues present in hCAR and mCAR1 but which nonetheless is sorted to the basolateral surface. The mCAR2 C terminus must contain sorting information that compensates for loss of information from mCAR1, even though its sequence is quite dissimilar.CAR's role in virus infection is well established, but its cellular function remains to be determined. Recent evidence suggests that CAR may be involved in homotypic cell adhesion (35Honda T. Saitoh H. Masuko M. Katagiri-Abe T. Tominaga K. Kozakai I. Kobayashi K. Kumanishi T. Watanabe Y.G. Odani S. Kuwano R. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 77: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). It is concentrated at sites of cell-cell contact in both polarized (10, present study) and non-polarized cells. 2C. Cohen and J Bergelson, unpublished observations. Consistent with this, CAR's N-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain forms a homodimer, and residues at the homodimer interface are more highly conserved in evolution than is the rest of the extracellular domain (6van Raaij, M. J., Chouin, E., van der Zandt, H., Bergelson, J. M., and Cusack, S. (2000) 8, 1147–1155.Google Scholar).The CAR cytoplasmic domain shows greater sequence conservation than does the extracellular domain. At the C terminus, 23 of 23 residues are identical in human and zebrafish CAR.3 This sequence conservation most likely reflects conservation of biological function. We find that information required for basolateral sorting is present within this highly conserved region; although the implicated sequences are absent from CAR's variant isoform, the basolateral targeting is preserved. These observations suggest that expression at the basolateral surface of polarized epithelium may be important to CAR's primary function. Previous work demonstrated that wild-type hCAR is sorted solely to the basolateral membrane of polarized MDCK cells, and that essential sorting information is contained within the CAR cytoplasmic domain (10Pickles R.J. Fahrner J.A. Petrella J.M. Boucher R.C. Bergelson J.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6050-6057Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In these experiments we have delineated CAR sequences involved in basolateral sorting. Our data suggest that multiple regions within the CAR cytoplasmic domain are required for basolateral targeting. The amino acids YNQV, beginning at amino acid 318, comprise a previously described basolateral sorting signal, and changing the tyrosine within this motif led to apical expression of hCAR. Deletion or mutation of the sequence LSRMG between residues 345 and 349 led to apical expression of hCAR, indicating that these amino acids may also be a distinct sorting motif. There also appears to be additional sorting information contained between residues 261 and 315 that functions independently of these other potential signals. We found that the deletion of a putative PDZ interaction motif (SIV) from the hCAR C terminus did not alter the exclusively basolateral expression pattern, indicating that interaction with PDZ proteins is not essential for basolateral sorting of hCAR. This contrasts with evidence that C-terminal PDZ interaction motifs (with the consensus sequence (T/S)X-hydrophobic) are involved in polarized expression of such proteins as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (29Moyer B.D. Denton J. Karlson K.H. Reynolds D. Wang S. Mickle J.E. Milewski M. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Li M. Stanton B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and the receptor tyrosine kinase let 23 (33). However, our results are similar to those obtained with the γ-aminobutyric acid transporter BGT-1, in which deletion of a PDZ-interacting motif did not prevent localization to the basolateral membranes of MDCK cells despite the motif's function as a retention signal (34Perego C. Vanoni C. Villa A. Longhi R. Kaech S.M. Frohli E. Hajnal A. Kim S.K. Pietrini G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2384-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It is likely that CAR's PDZ recognition motif is important for interaction with other cellular proteins, but these interactions do not drive the polarization of CAR expression. An examination of the cytoplasmic domain of hCAR does not reveal other known sorting signals. Nevertheless, there is likely to be additional targeting information contained within the cytoplasmic domain. Tailless hCAR was expressed in equal amounts on the apical and basolateral membranes of polarized MDCK cells. In contrast, mutant YSK315, which lacks approximately half the cytoplasmic domain and contains neither tyrosine residue 318 nor the potential basolateral sorting sequence LSRMG between amino acids 345 and 349, was preferentially, but not exclusively, distributed to the basolateral surface. This suggests that other basolateral sorting information is contained within the proximal half of the hCAR cytoplasmic domain. Although these regions are distant from each other in the linear amino acid sequence of hCAR, they may be in close proximity with one another in the tertiary structure of this protein. Therefore, deletion or mutation of any one of these regions may impair the interaction of the hCAR cytoplasmic domain with cellular sorting machinery. For some proteins, such as the low density lipoprotein and epidermal growth factor receptors (18Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 24Hobert M.E. Kil S.J. Medof M.E. Carlin C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32901-32909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), deletion of basolateral targeting determinants within the cytoplasmic domain results in expression that is almost exclusively apical, perhaps because of strong apical sorting determinants in the transmembrane or extracellular domains. In contrast, deletion of the entire CAR cytoplasmic domain resulted in an equal distribution of tailless CAR on the apical and basolateral surfaces, and even GPI-anchored CAR showed significant basolateral expression; these results suggest that the CAR extracellular domain does not contain strong apical sorting signals. There are two isoforms of murine CAR: the cytoplasmic domain of mCAR1 is nearly identical to that of hCAR; mCAR2 differs from hCAR and mCAR1 at the C terminus (2Tomko R.P. Xu R. Philipson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3352-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 4Bergelson J.M. Krithivas A. Celi L. Droguett G. Horwitz M.S. Wickham T. Crowell R.L. Finberg R.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 415-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To see if these differences in the cytoplasmic domain affected the targeting of these receptors, we constructed chimeric receptors containing the extracellular portion of hCAR fused to the cytoplasmic domains of the two mCAR isoforms. This was necessary, because the anti-CAR monoclonal antibody RmcB recognizes the extracellular region of hCAR, but not of mCAR. Like hCAR, both mouse isoforms were targeted exclusively to the basolateral membrane of polarized MDCK monolayers. We found that deletion of 21 residues from the C terminus of hCAR interfered with basolateral sorting; these residues are not present in mCAR2, which lacks 26 C-terminal residues present in hCAR and mCAR1 but which nonetheless is sorted to the basolateral surface.

https://openalex.org/W2133451553,"Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) producing gastric cancer (AFP–GC) is very malignant and highly metastatic compared with common gastric cancer. However, the causal relationship between AFP production and the high malignancy of AFP-GC is unclear. We investigated AFP gene regulation in AFP-GC by an active transcription factor, HNF1 (hapatocyte nuclear factor 1) and a repressive transcription factor, ATBF1 (AT motif binding factor 1). RNase protection assays revealed that the production of AFP in gastric cancer cells did not directly associate with HNF1 expression. An inverse relation between the expressions of ATBF1 and AFP was clearly observed in gastric cancer cells. CAT assays showed the direct inhibition of AFP gene expression by ATBF1. Methylation analysis of the AFP promoter region in gastric cancer cells suggested that methylation itself could not explain the silencing of the AFP gene. Immunohistochemistry of resected clinical samples revealed that AFP producing cells lacked ATBF1 immunoreactivity. Our data suggests that the absence of ATBF1 is responsible for AFP gene expression in gastric cancer, and the absence of ATBF1 is a distinct characteristic of AFP-GC and might be important for its highly malignant nature."

https://openalex.org/W2323659170,"In many human cancers, the INK4A locus is frequently mutated by homozygous deletions. By alternative splicing this locus encodes two non-related tumor suppressor genes, p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) (p19(ARF) in mice), which regulate cell cycle and cell survival in the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and p53 pathways, respectively. In mice, the role of p16(INK4A) as the critical tumor suppressor gene at the INK4A locus was challenged when it was found that p19(ARF) only knock-out mice developed tumors, including gliomas. We have analysed the genetic status of the INK4A locus in 105 primary gliomas using both microsatellite mapping (MSM) and quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR). Comparison of the results of the two methods revealed agreement in 67% of the tumors examined. In discordant cases, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was always found to support QRT-PCR classification. Direct assessment of p14(ARF) exon 1beta, p16(INK4A) exon 1alpha and exon 2 by QRT-PCR revealed 43 (41%) homozygous and eight (7%) hemizygous deletions at the INK4A locus. In 49 (47%) gliomas, both alleles were retained. In addition, QRT-PCR, but not MSM, detected hyperploidy in five (5%) tumors. Deletion of p14(ARF) was always associated with co-deletion of p16(INK4A) and increased in frequency upon progression from low to high grade gliomas. Shorter survival was associated with homozygous deletions of INK4A in the subgroup of glioblastoma patients older than 50 years of age (P=0.025, Anova test single factor, alpha=0.05)."
https://openalex.org/W2089749647,"The p53 tumor suppressor is activated in response to various stresses driving the cells into growth arrest or apoptosis. We have addressed the question of how disintegration of microtubule system induces activation of p53. Depolymerization of microtubules by colcemid in rat and human quiescent fibroblasts resulted in accumulation of transcriptionally active p53 that caused cell-cycle arrest at the G1/S boundary. The p53 activation correlated with prominent activation of Erk1/2 MAP kinases that resulted from colcemid-stimulated development of focal adhesions. Inhibition of focal contacts development by plating of cells onto poly-L-lysine abrogated both Erk1/2 and p53 activations in colcemid-treated cells, while plating of cells onto fibronectin caused transient up-regulation of p53 even in the absence of colcemid. Pre-treatment of cells with the specific MEK1 inhibitor PD098059 also attenuated colcemid-induced p53 activation and G1 cell cycle arrest. Cell types which either failed to develop focal adhesions in response to colcemid treatment (human MCF-7 epithelial cells), or lacked colcemid-induced sustained Erk activation (primary mouse embryo fibroblasts and 12(1) cells) showed virtually no p53 up-regulation in response to disruption of microtubules during G0/G1. Our results indicate that p53 activation is not triggered by disintegration of microtubule system by itself, but rather originates from some of the consequences of such disintegration, in particular, from the development of focal adhesions leading to activation of Erk signaling pathway."

In vivo, the catalytic activity of APC is regulated by two serpins, α1-antitrypsin and the protein C inhibitor (PCI), the inhibition by the latter being stimulated by heparin. We have identified a heparin-binding site in the serine protease domain of APC and characterized the energetic basis of the interaction with heparin. According to the counter-ion condensation theory, the binding of heparin to APC is 66% ionic in nature and comprises four to six net ionic interactions. To localize the heparin-binding site, five recombinant APC variants containing amino acid exchanges in loops 37, 60, and 70 (chymotrypsinogen numbering) were created. As demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance, reduction of the electropositive character of loops 37 and 60 resulted in complete loss of heparin binding. The functional consequence was loss in heparin-induced stimulation of APC inhibition by PCI, whereas the PCI-induced APC inhibition in the absence of heparin was enhanced. Presumably, the former observations were due to the inability of heparin to bridge some APC mutants to PCI, whereas the increased inhibition of certain APC variants by PCI in the absence of heparin was due to reduced repulsion between the enzymes and the serpin. The heparin-binding site of APC was also shown to interact with heparan sulfate, albeit with lower affinity.

Protein C circulates in plasma as a zymogen to a serine protease that has anticoagulant properties. Protein C is a multidomain molecule that is composed of two disulfide-linked chains. The light chain comprises a γ-carboxyglutamatic acid domain and two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, whereas the heavy chain is composed of the activation peptide and a serine protease domain (4Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Protein C is activated on endothelial cells by thrombin bound to thrombomodulin. Activated protein C (APC)1 regulates blood coagulation by cleaving and inhibiting two cofactors, activated factor V (FVa) and activated factor VIII (FVIIIa) (5Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which serve as phospholipid-membrane-bound cofactors to factor Xa (FXa) and factor IXa (FIXa), respectively. FXa is the enzyme that activates prothrombin to thrombin, whereas FIXa converts FX to its active form (1Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W.

In vivo, the proteolytic activity of APC is regulated by two serpins, namely α1-antitrypsin and protein C inhibitor (PCI) (7Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. J. Biol.

Inhibition of APC by PCI is potentiated by the glycosaminoglycan heparin, whereas the inhibition by α1-antitrypsin is insensitive to the presence of heparin. Structurally, heparin is heterogeneous in nature and is composed of long, highly negatively charged, unbranched polysaccharide chains. It is hypothesized that heparin binds to both PCI and APC during PCI-mediated inhibition of APC, thus guiding the encounter of these proteins via a template mechanism (9Aznar J. Espana F. Estelles A. Royo M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 983-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 10Neese L.L. Wolfe C.A. Church F.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We therefore expect the formation of a ternary complex similar to the one suggested between antithrombin, heparin, and thrombin (11Olson S.T. Bjork I. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2853-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), but a more complete definition of a heparin-binding site(s) in APC and energetic characteristics of the heparin interaction with APC were lacking. Binding of heparin to proteins is usually ionic in nature, involving the side chains of clustered basic amino acids on the protein and negatively charged groups on the heparin molecule. Amino acid sequence patterns such as XBBXBX and XBBBXXBX (B denotes basic, and X denotes nonbasic residues) are potential heparin recognition sites (15Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.

In the three-dimensional structure of APC, a basic cluster of amino acids is located on loops 37, 60, and 70 (chymotrypsinogen nomenclature) (see Fig. 1) (21Wacey A.I. Pemberton S. Cooper D.N.

Multiple-sequence and structural alignments of APC with other serine proteases formed the basis for our mutagenesis strategy, aimed at identification of the APC heparin-binding site. In the present study, site-directed mutagenesis and recombinant human protein C expression were used to localize the heparin-binding site in APC. A cluster of lysines located on loops 37 and 60 was found to be crucial for heparin binding. Characterization of the binding of heparin to APC under different salt concentrations provided evidence for the electrostatic signature of the interaction. Reduction of the electropositive character of these loops resulted in lost heparin binding and reduced heparin stimulation of APC inhibition by PCI.

Three new recombinant human protein C variants, K37S/K38Q/K39Q, K37S/K38Q/K39Q/K62N/K63D, and R74Q, were created by site-directed in vitro mutagenesis using the polymerase chain reaction technique. In brief, full-length human protein C WT cDNA (1425 base pairs) was inserted into theBcII site of the eukaryotic expression vector pGT-hyg (Eli Lilly). The following primers were used to introduce the mutations into the human protein C WT cDNA: sense primer, 5′-CTG CTG GAC TCAAGC CAG CAG CTG GCC TGC GGG for variant K37S/K38Q/K39Q; sense primer, 5′-GAG TAT GAC CTGCAG CGC TGG GAG AAG for variant R74Q.

Exchanged nucleotides as listed above are marked in bold, and codons corresponding to the exchanged amino acids are underlined. The sequence of cDNAs coding for WT protein C and all variants were confirmed using automated DNA sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) before transfection. Adenovirus-transformed human kidney cell line 293 (HU 293, CRL-1573 ATCC) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2.

Hygromycin B was used for selection of transfected cells. Colonies characterized by the highest protein expression, as judged by immunoblotting, were cultured. Variants E60aS/S61R, and K62N/K63D were expressed as previously described (13Shen L. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlbäck B. Thromb.

Cells were grown in Optimem Glutamax (Life Technologies, Inc.) medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml vitamin K1. After 72 h, the conditioned medium was collected, and the recombinant expressed human protein C was purified from the supernatant by anion-exchange chromatography and barium citrate adsorption as previously described (26Friedrich U. Potzsch B. Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. Ehrlich H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The purity and integrity of the isolated protein C was evaluated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. Protein C concentrations were quantified by measurement of absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 14.5 (280 nm, 1%, 1 cm). In addition, activated protein C concentrations were determined by a chromogenic assay measuring the rate of S-2366 (Chromogenix) hydrolysis. Proteins subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE were either detected by silver staining or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) for Western blotting. After transfer of the proteins to the polyvinylidene difluoride, membranes were quenched with Tris-buffered saline containing 3% (v/v) fish gelatin and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and then incubated with antibodies. The proteins were detected using a polyclonal antibody against human protein C (No. 370 DAKO) followed by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit antibody (No. 306 DAKO), and BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate)/nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT) substrate was used for development. Purified WT protein C or protein C variants were incubated with human α-thrombin (10:1 mol/mol) in 20 mmTris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 2 h in the presence of 5 mm EDTA. A sulfopropyl-Sepharose column was used to remove thrombin from the reaction mixture. APC concentrations were estimated by measurement of absorbance at 280 nm. Amidolytic activities were determined using chromogenic substrate S-2366 (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 at 37 °C) in a microplate reader (ELX808IU from Bio-TEK instruments) and expressed in absorbance change at 405 nm (ΔA/min). The concentrations of chromogenic substrate S-2366 ranged between 0.015 and 3 mm, and the concentrations of APC ranged between 1 and 50 nm.Km and Vmax values were obtained from Lineweaver-Burk plots, and kcatwas calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation (27Pfleiderer G. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 19: 514-521Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 28Cleland W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). Heparin or heparan sulfate (0.5 mg of each) were dissolved in 200 μl of 0.1m MES, pH 5.6. EZ-link biotin hydrazide andN-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide were added to a final concentration of 2.5 and 0.5 mm, respectively. After a 6-h incubation at room temperature with constant shaking, the biotinylated glycosaminoglycans were desalted on a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in water, then freeze-dried, and dissolved in 0.3 m NaCl. Binding of WT and variant APCs to heparin and heparan sulfate was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance using BIAcore 2000. Biotinylated, unfractionated heparin and heparan sulfate were immobilized in flow cells 2 and 3, respectively, of a streptavidin sensor chip. Functional integrity of the chip-bound heparan sulfate was shown by the fact that it bound bFGF with high affinity. APC (5–150 μg/ml) was injected at a flow rate of 30 μl/min at various NaCl concentrations (80–300 mm) into flow cells containing heparin. In addition, APC (150 μg/ml) was injected at 30 μl/min into a flow cell containing immobilized heparan sulfate. Flow cell 1 without any immobilized glycosaminoglycan was used as control. To investigate whether fluid phase heparan sulfate could compete with immobilized heparin for the binding to APC, 0.5 mg/ml heparan sulfate was included in the flow buffer. The derived BIAcore sensograms were evaluated with BIAevaluation 3.0 software to calculate association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rate constants. WT and variant APCs in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 buffer were applied on heparin-Sepharose, and bound APC was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 0.05 to 0.4 m. APC and NaCl concentrations were measured by hydrolysis of chromogenic substrate S-2366 hydrolysis and flame photometry, respectively (13Shen L. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlbäck B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The side chains of variant APC molecules were replaced interactively using InsightII and Biopolymer, and all structures were energy-minimized using the simulation program Discover (Biosym-MSI). The electrostatic potential isosurfaces were computed with DelPhi as part of the Biosym-MSI-modeling suite (inner/outer dielectrics 4/80; physiological ionic strength, formal charges) for APC molecules and for the highly negatively charged heparin molecule. The rate of inhibition of WT and mutant APCs by PCI in the absence of heparin or heparan sulfate was measured under pseudo-first-order conditions. In brief, WT and variant APCs were incubated (between 0 to 120 min) with a 10-fold molar excess of human plasma PCI at room temperature in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.10 m NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Chromogenic substrate S-2366 was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and the rate of substrate hydrolysis was measured with a Vmax kinetic microplate reader (Bio-TEK instruments). First-order rate constants (k) were calculated as −ln a/t [I], where a is the fractional protease activity remaining relative to the uninhibited control, t is the time of incubation, and [I] is the PCI concentration. In the presence of unfractionated heparin (Mrfrom 5,000 to 30,000; Leo) the rate of APC inactivation was too fast to be measured under the conditions that are described above. Therefore, PCI (7.5–200 nm at final concentration) was mixed with APC (30 nm) and 1 IU/ml (equal to 6.6 μg/ml) unfractionated heparin in a final volume of 100 μl. After defined time points, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 mg/ml Polybrene. The residual APC activities were determined by adding 50 μl of S-2366 (final concentration was 0.2 mm), and the ΔA at 405 nm was measured. The following equation was used to calculate the k2 value. k2=1[A]0−[B]0ln[B]0[A]0−χ[A]0[B]0−χ/tM−1s−1Equation 1 [A]0 and [B]0 were the initial concentrations of APC and PCI, respectively, and χ was the molar concentration of APC·PCI complexes formed after timet; k2 was calculated from data points demonstrating 15–85% proteinase inhibition. All experiments were performed in triplicates. To determine the effect of heparan sulfate on the rate of inhibition of APC by PCI, PCI (60 nm final concentration) was mixed with APC (30 nm final concentration) and increasing concentrations of heparan sulfate (0–100 μg/ml) in a final volume of 100 μl. Under these conditions, maximum stimulation of inhibition was observed at concentrations ≥50 μg/ml. At intervals, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 2 mg/ml Polybrene. Residual activity of APC was determined by the addition of 50 μl of S-2366, and the ΔA at 405 nm was measured. Thek2 values were calculated as described for heparin from data points demonstrating 15–85% proteinase inhibition. All experiments were performed in triplicate. To evaluate the involvement of positively charged amino acid residues in loops 37, 60, and 70 in the binding of heparin to APC, five protein C variants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig.1). According to our structural analysis, four of the variants were expected to have reduced affinity toward heparin (K37S/K38Q/K39Q, K62N/K63D, K37S/K38Q/K39Q/K62N/K63D, R74Q), whereas one mutant was created with the intention of increasing the heparin affinity (E60aS/S61R). Since the target amino acid residues are solvent-exposed on loop structures and naturally occurring in related serine proteases, it should be expected that the above amino acid substitutions will not alter the folding of APC or damage its catalytic machinery. Furthermore, because the newly introduced residues are similar in size to the original ones, these mutations can be considered as conservative, and they should be better tolerated in the structure than, for instance, small hydrophobic alanine substitutions. Clustering of three to five alanine residues could create a destabilizing solvent-exposed hydrophobic patch no longer able to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules or could induce misfolding due to the high helical propensity of this amino acid. The various protein C cDNA variants were used to transfect the eukaryotic cell line HU293, and stable cell lines were established. The different protein C variants demonstrated similar expression levels (2.7 to 6.7 mg/liter). The proteins were purified with overall recoveries of 35–40%, and the isolated proteins were more than 90% pure, as estimated by SDS-PAGE. On SDS-PAGE, the protein C variants migrated at similar positions as WT protein C (Fig.2). Under nonreducing conditions, the different protein C variants migrated as single bands. After reduction of disulfide bridges, the 41-kDa heavy chains and the 21-kDa light chains were observed in addition to the 62-kDa single chain forms of protein C. Under reducing conditions, for all recombinant proteins a small amount of single chain protein C remained. After activation, the different recombinant protein variants demonstrated similar amidolytic activities (Km and kcat) (Table I). The equally high expression levels observed for all the different protein C variants and their full amidolytic activities after activation together with the above structural considerations suggest that the recombinant proteins were correctly folded and could be used for further functional characterizations.Table ISteady-state kinetic analysis of chromogenic substrate S-2366 hydrolysis by WT APC and the APC variantsEnzymeKmkcatkcat/Kmμms−1μm−1s−1Wild type0.91 ± 0.0270 ± 176.9K62N/K63D0.95 ± 0.0178 ± 582.1K37S/K38Q/K39Q0.98 ± 0.0475 ± 776.5K37S/K38Q/K39Q/K62N/K63D0.93 ± 0.0171 ± 176.3E60aS/S61R0.93 ± 0.0870 ± 675.3R74Q0.90 ± 0.0276 ± 884.4 Open table in a new tab Binding of WT APC and APC variants to immobilized heparin was analyzed with surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore 2000 (TableII). At physiological NaCl concentration, the dissociation constant (Kdobs) of WT APC for heparin was 0.32 μm. The R74Q variant showed slightly lower affinity (Kdobs = 0.54 μm), whereas E60aS/S61R bound more tightly (Kdobs = 0.19 μm) to heparin than WT APC (Table II, Fig. 3). There was no detectable binding of K37S/K38Q/K39Q, K62N/K63D, and K37S/K38Q/K39Q/K62N/K63D to immobilized heparin molecules. To qualitatively confirm the results obtained by BIAcore, WT APC and the five APC variants were applied on heparin-Sepharose, and bound protein was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient. The results agreed well with those obtained by the BIAcore analysis. Thus, removal of the positively charged residues at positions 37/38/39 or 62/63 or 37/38/39/62/63 yielded diminished or undetectable binding to the heparin-Sepharose (results not shown). In contrast, the E60aS/S61R variant bound tighter to the heparin column than WT APC and was eluted at higher NaCl concentrations. These results strongly suggest that the heparin-binding site of APC is entirely dependent on the presence of a few positively charged residues on loops 37 and 60 (Fig.4).Table IIAffinity and rate constants for interaction of APC with heparinAPCKd obskonkoffμmm−1s−1s−1Wild type0.322.6 × 1048.4 × 10−3[NaCl] = 150 mmΔG = −8.8 (kcal/mol)R74Q0.546.1 × 1033.3 × 10−3[NaCl] = 150 mmΔG = −8.5 (kcal/mol)E60aS/S61R0.197.8 × 1031.5 × 10−3[NaCl] = 150 mmΔG = −9.1 (kcal/mol)The binding of APC to immobilized heparin was measured with surface plasmon resonance, and BIAevaluation 3.0 software was used to calculate association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rate constants from the sensograms.

Therefore, nokon and koff rate constants could be calculated for these APC variants. Open table in a new tab Figure 4Electrostatic surface potential of APC. A model for heparin containing 7 monosaccharide units was aligned onto APC loops 37 and 60.

The electropositive characters of loops 37 and 60 in WT, E60aS/S61R, and R74Q are consistent with normal or enhanced binding of heparin. This energy field is partially or fully destroyed in variants K37S/K38Q/K39Q, K62N/K63D, and K37S/K38Q/K39Q/K62N/K63D, which bind heparin weakly or not at all.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The binding of APC to immobilized heparin was measured with surface plasmon resonance, and BIAevaluation 3.0 software was used to calculate association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rate constants from the sensograms. APC variants K37S/K38Q/K39Q, K62N/K63D, and K37S/K38Q/K39Q/K62N/K63D demonstrated no binding to the heparin-coated SA-chip. Therefore, nokon and koff rate constants could be calculated for these APC variants. Heparin is derived from mast cells, and it is unlikely that APC interacts with heparin under normal physiological conditions if heparin is not administered as a therapeutic. Heparan sulfate present on the surface of endothelial cells is the glycosaminoglycan that is more likely to interact with circulating APC. For this reason, we tested the binding of APC to immobilized heparan sulfate in the BIAcore under similar conditions as for heparin. In contrast to the clear binding curves observed with heparin, no binding of APC to heparan sulfate could be detected. In this context, it should be considered that BIAcore is only able to detect interactions characterized by relatively high association rate constants. Therefore, many physiologically relevant interactions cannot be detected by this method. To further investigate whether heparan sulfate was able to interact with APC, 0.5 mg/ml fluid phase heparan sulfate was co-injected with APC in the flow cell containing immobilized heparin. Under these conditions, complete inhibition of binding of APC to heparin was observed, suggesting that APC may interact with heparan sulfate, albeit weaker than with heparin. BIAcore was used to determine the kinetic characteristics of the binding of WT APC to heparin at various salt concentrations, the purpose being to gain insights into the relative contributions of ionic versus nonionic components to the interaction (Table III). The results were evaluated using the counter-ion condensation theory, assuming that heparin behaves as a polyelectrolyte surrounded by a counter-ion condensation volume (29Record Jr., M.T. Anderson C.F. Lohman T.M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1978; 11: 103-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar, 30Manning G.S. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1978; 11: 179-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2630) Google Scholar). Counter-ions (e.g.Na+) can interact with heparin by delocalized, long range electrostatic interactions and by direct binding to ionic sites. Displacement of counter-ions upon heparin binding to protein has been experimentally demonstrated (31Hari S.P. McAllister H. Chuang W.L. Christ M.D. Rabenstein D.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3763-3773Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In cases where a plot of logKdobs against log [salt] is linear, the magnitude of the slope corresponds to the effective number of heparin counter-ions released upon its binding to a protein. This approach has been used successfully to study many interactions such as the ones between heparin and thrombin or bFGF (11Olson S.T. Bjork I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6353-6364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Thompson L.D. Pantoliano M.W. Springer B.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3831-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The bFGF predictions were remarkable, since it was reported that ∼30% of the binding energy between bFGF and heparin resulted from purely ionic interactions. In this case, the plot of logKdobs against log [salt] was linear (slope = 1.95), and it was estimated that only 2–3 net ionic interactions were involved between the two molecules. This result was fully supported at a later stage by x-ray analysis of the bFGF-heparin complex (33Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C.

Open table in a new tab Under various NaCl concentrations, binding of 5–150 μg/ml WT APC to immobilized heparin was measured with surface plasmon resonance.kon and koff rate constants were calculated by global fitting of the BIAcore sensograms in BIAevaluation 3.0. To evaluate the APC-heparin interaction, the following scheme was used. The observed Kd(Kdobs) is related to the nonionic equilibrium dissociation constant (Kdnonionic) through the relationship log Kdobs = logKdnonionic + ψZ[Na+]. The plot of logKdobs versus log [Na+] is linear, and the value of Z can be calculated from the slope. The formation of Z electrostatic interactions between WT APC and heparin is accompanied by the displacement of ΨZ-condensed counter-ions from the heparin. Ψ is the effective fraction of counter-ion bound per heparin negative charge, which has been estimated to be 0.8 (11Olson S.T. Bjork I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6353-6364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The slope (0.8 × Z = 4.86) provides the effective number of purely ionic interactions formed between WT APC and heparin. Thus, about 4–6 ionic interactions seem to be involved in this process. At 1.0 m NaCl, ionic interactions were neutralized, and logKdobs = log Kdnonionic, which we estimate to be 5600 μm. Because the Kd for the APC-heparin interaction at physiological ionic strength was 0.32 μm, 66% of the binding free energy (ΔG) was estimated to be ionic, with the remaining 34% nonionic. The ΔG of WT APC binding to heparin at physiological salt concentration (150 mm) was estimated to be −8.8 kcal/mol, with the nonionic and ionic contributions to this interaction −3 kcal/mol and −5.7 kcal/mol, respectively. Thus, the WT APC binding to heparin is mainly electrostatic in nature just like the binding of heparin to thrombin (Kdobs = 6–10 μm, about 80% ionic) (11Olson S.T. Bjork I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6353-6364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or to mucus proteinase inhibitor (Kdobs = 0.05 μm; >80% ionic) (34Faller B. Mely Y. Gerard D. Bieth J.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8285-8290Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). There is a considerable effect of salt on Kdobsfor the APC-heparin interaction (Table III), and the corresponding ΔG values run from −9.6 kcal/mol at 80 mmNaCl to −6 kcal/mol at 300 mm NaCl (the Kdobs increases 626-fold). Salt influences mostlykon, whereas the koff is not dramatically affected, suggesting that long range electrostatic interactions are important for the formation of an initial encounter complex. Once salt bridges are formed, NaCl does not significantly weaken the short range ionic interactions. We note also that although the APC-heparin interaction is mainly electrostatic, the rate of association is well below the maximum rate for collision of molecules in solution, which is around 109—1010m−1 s−1(35Smoluchowski M.V. Z. Phys. Chem. 1918; 92: 129-168Crossref Google Scholar). During inhibition of APC by PCI, heparin or heparan sulfate may function as templates to guide PCI into the active site of APC during the formation of the Michaelis-like complex. Assuming the identified heparin/heparan sulfate-binding site on APC to be functionally important, the recombinant APC modifications are expected to affect the heparin/heparan sulfate stimulation of inhibition by PCI. This was indeed found to be the case. Heparin (at 1 IU/ml, equal to 6.6 μg/ml) accelerated the rate of PCI-mediated inhibition of WT APC 800-fold, whereas heparin only yielded an 11-fold increase in the rate of inhibition of the K37S/K38Q/K39Q/K62N/K63D variant (Table IV). The E60aS/S61R variant, which bound heparin with higher affinity than WT APC, demonstrated even higher stimulation of inhibition by heparin (11,000-fold). Heparan sulfate (at 50 μg/ml) was tested in the same experimental setup and was found to give a 350-fold increased rate of inhibition of WT APC and a 2200-fold increased inhibition of the E60aS/S61R variant but only a 40-fold increased rate of inhibition of K62N/K63D and a 6-fold increased rate of inhibition of the K37S/K38Q/K39Q/K62N/K63D variant (results not shown) . These results demonstrate that heparan sulfate is able to interact with the same site as heparin on APC and that heparin and heparan sulfate yield similar functional effects on the rate of inhibition by PCI. However, based on both BIAcore results and the PCI inhibition data, heparin appears to bind APC with higher affinity than does heparan sulfate.Table IVSecond-order rate constants for PCI-mediated inhibition of APC variants in the presence and absence of heparinAPCAbsence of heparin, k2Presence of heparin, k2Acceleration of APC inhibition× 102m−1 s−1× 106m−1 s−1Wild type8.7 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.1805R74Q7.4 ± 0.90.4 ± 0.01541E60aS/S61R7.9 ± 1.58.7 ± 0.511,012K62N/K63D46.5 ± 0.20.4 ± 0.186K37S/K38Q/K39Q16.1 ± 0.10.2 ± 0.2124K62N/K63D/K37S/K38Q/K39Q175 ± 0.10.2 ± 0.111 Open table in a new tab In the absence of heparin/heparan sulfate, E60aS/S61R and R74Q variants were inhibited by PCI equally fast as WT APC, whereas the rate of PCI inhibition was increased for the K37S/K38Q/K39Q, K62N/K63D, and K37S/K38Q/K39Q/K62N/K63D variants (Fig.5 A). The biggest effect was shown for the variant K37S/K38Q/K39Q/K62N/K63D. Already after 10 min more than 90% of the variant was inhibited, whereas WT APC activity was reduced only by 10% (Fig. 5 A). This suggests that the lysine cluster in loops 37 and 60 repulses PCI in the absence of heparin. The poor heparin-mediated stimulation of PCI inhibition of the K37S/K38Q/K39Q, K62N/K63D and K37S/K38Q/K39Q/K62N/K63D (Fig.5 B) is in agreement with the bridging theory involving heparin or heparan sulfate binding to the lysine cluster of APC as well as to PCI. In line with this theory, heparin and heparan sulfate were found to provide increased stimulation to the PCI inhibition of the E60aS/S61R variant, which demonstrated increased affinity for heparin (Fig. 5 B). It is noteworthy that the now demonstrated heparin/heparan sulfate-binding site in APC is located on another part of the protease domain as compared with the heparin binding exosite II of thrombin (Fig. 1). Similarly, PCI binds heparin on the other side (around helix H) as compared with the heparin binding D-helix of antithrombin (10Neese L.L. Wolfe C.A. Church F.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,36Sheehan J.P. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, the helix H area of PCI should be the topological neighbor of APC loops 37 and 60 in the Michaelis-like complex. In conclusion, we have characterized the structural and energetic basis of a functionally important heparin-binding site in the serine protease domain of APC. This binding site is functionally important in the heparin/heparan sulfate-stimulated inhibition of APC by its serpin inhibitor PCI. We thank Astra Andersson for technical assistance, Prof. Johan Stenflo for the kind gift of purified PCI, Dr. Markku Salmivirta for providing the biotinylated heparin, and Dr. Sassan Hafizi for language revision."

Caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 often co-localize in the same membrane compartment; in the absence of caveolin-1, caveolin-2 remains exclusively in the Golgi apparatus (7Mora R. Bonilha V.L. Marmorstein A.

Caveolin-1 has been proposed to be involved in the regulation of lipid transport (9Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol.

Caveolin-1 binds cholesterol and fatty acids (13Murata M. Peränen J. Schreiner R. Wieland F. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It may also be involved in the process of cholesterol absorption and transport in the lymph or interstitial fluid (11Liu P. Li W.P. Machleidt T. Anderson R.G.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), although it has not been identified in plasma lipoproteins or blood cells (11Liu P. Li W.P. Machleidt T. Anderson R.G.W. Nat.

Monocyte-derived macrophages play an important role in the development of atherosclerosis. They take up large amounts of modified lipids present in the subendothelial space of arterial wall and form fatty streak lesions. Evidence for caveolin expression in macrophages, however, has been scarce and conflicting. Fielding and Fielding (19Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1503-1521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) report that macrophages do not express caveolin. In contrast, immunofluorescence labeling suggests caveolin-1 expression in mouse bone marrow- derived macrophages (20Baorto D.M. Gao Z. Malaviya R. Dustin M.L. van der Merwe A. Lublin D.M. Abraham S.N. Nature. 1997; 389: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analyses also indicate caveolin-1 expression in THP-1 cells but not in J774 or RAW macrophages; caveolin-2 expression was not detected in any of these cells (21Matveev S. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Smart E.J. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1647-1654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Contrary to these reports, caveolin-1 mRNA was recently detected in J774 and RAW macrophages by RT-PCR1 (22Lei M.G. Morrison D.C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5084-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Mouse peritoneal macrophages and the J774 macrophage cell line are frequently used to study various aspects of cholesterol metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport. In order to clearly establish whether these cells express caveolins, we used various independent methods to examine the presence and distribution of caveolin-1 and -2. We also examined the subcellular localization and the extent of caveolin expression in these cells relative to NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. Although caveolins have not been detected in the plasma compartment, we report HDL3- mediated secretion of caveolin-1 and -2 from cholesterol loaded macrophages. In addition, we report that perturbations in cellular cholesterol homeostasis have only a moderate effect on caveolin expression in these cells. Anti-caveolin-1 polyclonal antibody (C-13630) and anti-caveolin-2 monoclonal antibody (C-57820) were purchased form Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). Anti-human apoA-I antibody was purchased from Chemicon (Temecul, CA). Anti-mannosidase II antibody was provided by Dr. Moremen (University of Georgia, Athens, GA). The caveolin-1 ribonuclease protection assay plasmid template was a gift from Dr. R. G. W. Anderson (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Components for ribonuclease protection assay were purchased from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). [32P]-Labeled rUTP was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Alexa 488 goat anti-rabbit, Alexa 568 goat anti-rat, and Alexa 568 goat anti- mouse antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Anti- Mac-2 was purchased from Cedarlane Laboratories (Hornby, Ontario, Canada), and anti-actin (A-2066) was purchased from Sigma. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunochemicals (West Grove, PA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and Brewer's thioglycollate was purchased from Difco. All other chemicals were from Sigma. J774.A1 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were provided by Dr. Dimitrijevich (University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth). Mouse peritoneal macrophages were isolated from Swiss Webster mice by peritoneal lavage using PBS either directly (resident) or 4 days after an intraperitoneal injection of 1.5 ml of sterile thioglycollate broth (thioglycollate-elicited). Macrophages were seeded in 35-mm dishes at 3 × 106/well in DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin (each at 100 units/ml). Unattached cells were washed off after 3 h with DMEM (twice), and the remaining macrophages were incubated overnight in DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum. On the following day, cells were washed twice again, incubated in serum-free DMEM, and treated as indicated. J774.A1 and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cell viability/cytotoxicity was assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion and by the lactate dehydrogenase detection kit (Roche). Cholesterol loading of tg-MPM was performed 24 h after cell isolation. After an overnight incubation in 20% fetal calf serum/DMEM, the cells were washed twice and incubated in the serum-free media with the ACAT inhibitor SAH-58.035 (5 µg/ml) in the presence or absence of 50 µg/ml acetylated low density lipoprotein for 24 h, as previously described (23Dory L. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 809-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 24 h, the cells were washed and incubated for an additional 24 h in the presence of ACAT inhibitor or DMEM only. Following this treatment, cells were lysed in the lysis buffer in the presence of protease inhibitors, the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western assay. Alternatively, total RNA and poly(A) RNA were isolated for ribonuclease protection assay. Caveolin secretion by cholesterol-loaded macrophages was examined in similarly treated cells but followed by a 24-h incubation with human HDL3 (100 µg/ml). At the end of the incubation, the collected medium was concentrated following a high speed sedimentation of cellular debris (20,000 × g for 15 min), and the protein was precipitated with 7% trichloroacetic acid. Pellets were washed in ice-cold acetone and dissolved in SDS-lysis buffer. Lysates were sonicated, boiled for 10 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted for caveolin-1 and -2. Alternatively, the high speed supernatant fraction of the macrophage-conditioned medium was adjusted to d = 1.25 g/ml, and thed < 1.21 g/ml fraction was isolated by ultracentrifugation in an SW-41 rotor at 33,000 rpm for 48 h. Thed < 1.21 g/ml fraction was dialyzed (to remove NaBr) and trichloroacetic acid-precipitated. Caveolin-1 and -2 and apoA-I were detected by immunoblotting, as described above. Peritoneal macrophages were seeded on coverslips at a density of 0.8 × 106/well. J774 cell were grown on coverslips until 50% confluent. Cells were then fixed in 100% methanol for 5 min at −20 °C, and the coverslips were then sequentially incubated at room temperature in PBS containing 4% goat serum for 60 min, with the indicated primary and fluorescence-tagged secondary antibodies in 0.8% bovine serum albumin/PBS also for 60 min each. The coverslips were then mounted on glass slides using Aqua Poly/Mount (Polyscience) and viewed with a Nikon fluorescence microscope Microphot FxA, equipped with imaging software IPLab from Scanalytics Inc. (Fairfax, VA) and deconvolution software Power Microtome from Vaytek Inc. (Fairfield, IA). Total RNA was isolated using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center Inc.). 1.3 µg of total RNA was used to obtain the corresponding cDNA by using the Retroscript kit (Ambion, Inc.) and oligo(dT) primers. A quarter of this reaction mixture was used for the subsequent PCR using caveolin-1 and -2 primers. The following primers were designed for the RT-PCR analysis of caveolin-1: forward, 5′-CTA CAA GCC CAA CAA CAA GGC-3′; backward, 5′-AGG AAG CTC TTG ATG CAC GGT-3′. The primers for caveolin-2 were as follows: forward, 5′-A TGA CGC CTA CAG CCA CCA CAG-3′; backward, 5′-GCA AAC AGG ATA CCC GCA ATG-3′. These primers define a 341-base pair coding region of caveolin-1 and a 268-base pair coding region of caveolin-2 cDNA. Both sets of primers were designed to span at least two exons of the corresponding caveolin cDNAs. In order to be able to detect all four major mRNA isoforms (24Kogo H. Fujimoto T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 465: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we designed primers that border a portion of the coding region of all caveolin-1 mRNA isoforms (positions 72–413). Similarly, primers for caveolin-2 RT-PCR have been designed to amplify two exons of the caveolin-2 cDNA coding region (positions 47–314). Temperatures used for PCR were based on melting temperatures of primers supplied by the manufacturer (IDT, Inc.). RPA analysis of caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 mRNA was performed according to standard protocols. The template for the caveolin-1 antisense probe was subcloned into a pBluescript II KS plasmid (Strategene, CA). This probe corresponds to a 154-base pair sequence of the human caveolin-1 coding sequence (higher than 95% identity with the corresponding mouse sequence), beginning at the translational start site for the caveolin-1 α isoform (base pairs 1–154). Antisense probe for caveolin-2 was obtained by PCR using a mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblast cDNA library and a T3 RNA polymerase promoter sequence subsequently added by primer extension. This probe corresponds to a 185-base pair sequence of mouse caveolin-2 mRNA coding region (bp 124–308). Both antisense RNA probes were transcribed using T3 RNA polymerase in the presence of [32P]rUTP (926 Ci/mmol). A β-actin internal control template (Ambion, Austin, TX) was transcribed under similar conditions using rUTP with specific activity of 2.86 Ci/mmol. Labeled transcription products were gel-purified and hybridized (caveolin-1, 1.4 × 106cpm; caveolin-2, 1 × 106 cpm; and β-actin, 0.6 × 105 cpm) at 50 °C with 2.8 µg (caveolin-1) and 1.0 µg (caveolin-2) of poly(A) RNA, isolated by oligo(dT) cellulose chromatography. After 18 h, the mixture was digested with RNase A (2.5 U) and RNase T1 (100 U) at 37 °C for 30 min. RNases were inactivated by proteinase-K. RNA fragments were then ethanol-precipitated and separated on 8 m urea 6% polyacrylamide gels. Dried gels were either directly exposed to film or counted by Instant Imager (Packard Instruments, Meriden, CT). The calculations of RNA concentrations were based on the known specific activity of the RNA probes and counting efficiencies of the scintillation counter and Instant Imager (Packard Instruments). Protein samples were dissolved and boiled in Laemmli buffer (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) for 10 min, separated by SDS-PAGE using 15% gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) at 35 V for 16 h. After blocking with TBS containing Tween 20 (TBST) (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.4% Tween 20) in the presence of 5% nonfat dry milk, the membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies in TBST containing 1% nonfat dry milk at 4 °C for 16 h. Secondary antibodies in TBST containing 1% nonfat dry milk were added for 2 h at room temperature. Bound secondary antibodies were detected using an ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For sequential reprobing, the antibodies were stripped off the polyvinylidene fluoride membranes by using stripping buffer (2% SDS, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) for 30 min at 70 °C, washed with TBS, and incubated with antibodies as described above. 6 × 107 cells, plated in three 100-mm wells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped down into PBS containing a protease inhibitor mixture (100 µm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzensulfonyl fluoride, 10 µm leupeptin, 10 µm E-64, 1 µm bestatin, 15 nm aprotinin, 1.0 µm pepstatin-A). Cells were then sedimented and resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm Tricine, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA) with protease inhibitors. After 20 min on ice, cells were disrupted in a high pressure cell (7,650 p.s.i.) using a MicroDisrupter (Cell Scientific, Champaign, IL). Nuclei were removed by sedimenting the homogenate at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 160,000 × g in an SW 50.1 rotor (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA) to isolate a crude membrane fraction and cytosolic soluble proteins. The cytosolic proteins were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid (7.5%, final concentration). The precipitated supernatant proteins and membrane pellets were dissolved in reducing Laemmli buffer, boiled for 5 min, separated on SDS-PAGE gels, and analyzed by immunoblotting. We first examined caveolin expression in primary mouse macrophages and J774.A1 cells by RT-PCR, using primers that exclude positive identification due to the presence of genomic DNA contamination. Furthermore, our primers were designed to detect all reported species of caveolin-1 mRNA that arise due to alternate splicing and transcription initiation sites (24Kogo H. Fujimoto T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 465: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, tg-MPM express both caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 mRNA. In contrast, J774.A1 cells express only caveolin-2 mRNA. A more quantitative estimate of the abundance of caveolin mRNA levels was obtained by RPA; results of a typical experiment are shown in Figs. 1 Band 3 B. We confirm the complete absence of caveolin-1 mRNA in J774 cells. res-MPM and tg-MPM express caveolin-1 mRNA levels that are 31 and 8% of those found in 3T3 cells, respectively (Fig. 3 B). In agreement with the RT-PCR assay, caveolin-2 mRNA was detected in all cell types examined. As shown in Fig.3 B, relative to 3T3 cells, the highest level of caveolin-2 mRNA was found in tg-MPM, followed by J774 cells and res-MPM (133, 102, and 80% of the levels found in 3T3 cells, respectively).Figure 3Relative expression of caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 protein (top) and mRNA (bottom) in mouse macrophages. Caveolin-1 (open bars) and caveolin-2 (closed bars) expression levels (top) were analyzed by Western blotting, as described above (Fig. 2), and the relative amounts were measured by densitometric scanning. Each lane received an equal amount of protein, and the amounts in the macrophage cell types were expressed relative to the amounts found in 3T3 cells. The data represent the average ± S.E.M. of 5 experiments. Levels of caveolin-1 (open bars) and caveolin-2 (closed bars) mRNA (bottom) as determined by ribonuclease protection assay in a typical experiment. Messenger RNA levels were calculated from the amounts of radioactivity associated with specific protected bands, based on the known specific activity of each probe and the counting efficiency of the Instant Imager, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results were expressed as pg of caveolin mRNA/µg of poly(A) RNA used in the hybridization mix.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine and compare the expression of caveolin isoforms in resident and tg-MPM as well as J774 cells, we immunoblotted macrophage cell lysates with specific caveolin-1 and -2 antibodies. The results of a typical analysis are shown in Fig. 2. Both caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 consist of two isoforms (α and β), where the α-isoform is larger by 31 and 13 amino acids, respectively (26Das K. Lewis R.Y. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18721-18728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). After prolonged exposures, we were able to detect the β isoforms of caveolin-1 and -2 in all cells expressing the α isoform of these proteins. As shown in Fig. 2, caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 are expressed in macrophages primarily as α isoforms with relatively very little expression of β-caveolin, when compared with 3T3 fibroblasts. The caveolin-1 α/caveolin-1 β ratio in 3T3 cells is ∼1:1, whereas in tg- and res-MPM it is much higher (∼7:1). Similarly, the ratio of caveolin-2 α to β in 3T3 cells is ∼2:1, whereas caveolin-2 in macrophages is almost exclusively of the α-isoform. The extent of caveolin-1 and -2 expression in macrophages was normalized to those observed in 3T3 cells, and the data are shown in Fig. 3 A. The Western blot assay enabled us to make a cell-to-cell comparison of the extent of expression of each caveolin species; this assay does not allow the comparison of caveolin-1 with caveolin-2 expression in a particular cell. We compared the relative levels of caveolin expression (Fig.3 A) with the corresponding mRNA levels in the same cells, as measured by RPA (Fig. 3 B). In agreement with the RT-PCR and RPA data, we did not detect caveolin-1 expression in J774 cells. The caveolin-1 level in res-MPM is 44 ± 8 of that found in 3T3 cells and about 3-fold higher than that of tg-MPM. The indicated differences in caveolin-1 expression in each of the cells are significantly different from each other (p < 0.05). The relative levels of caveolin-1 in these cells correlate remarkably well with the levels of corresponding mRNAs, as shown in Fig. 3 B. Although caveolin-2 is the only form of caveolin expressed in J774 cells, its level of expression is significantly lower (10 ± 4%) than in 3T3 cells. The level of caveolin-2 expression in primary macrophages is similar to that of 3T3 cells. The corresponding mRNA levels support these observations (Fig. 3 B). Overall, there is a very good correlation between the extent of protein expression and mRNA abundance for both forms of caveolin, with the exception of J774 cells. In these cells relatively high levels of caveolin-2 mRNA do not appear to correspond with the low levels of caveolin-2. This difference may well be due to post-transcriptional events specific for J774 cells. Relative to 3T3 cells, where the caveolin-2 to caveolin-1 mass ratio was arbitrarily set at 1, this ratio varies from infinity (J774 cells) to ∼6 in tg-MPM and ∼2 in res-MPM. Caveolin-1 is a cholesterol- and fatty acid-binding protein (13Murata M. Peränen J. Schreiner R. Wieland F. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10339-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 14Trigatti B.L. Anderson R.G. Gerber G.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and may play an important role in cholesterol transport from the site of synthesis (endoplasmic reticulum), through the Golgi compartment to the plasma membrane (9Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29427-29435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). It is a membrane-bound protein, but it has been shown to exist as a soluble, cytosolic protein (27Uittenbogaard A. Ying Y. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6525-6532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) or as a secretory protein (11Liu P. Li W.P. Machleidt T. Anderson R.G.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Since macrophages are active in cholesterol trafficking, we examined the presence of caveolins in the membrane-bound and cytosolic fractions, as well as the extent of their secretion. Immunoblotting of cell fractions isolated from tg-MPM revealed that both caveolins are membrane-bound proteins (Fig. 4). Even after prolonged incubation, we did not detect caveolin in the soluble form or secreted to the cell culture medium. The weak caveolin signals observed in the nuclear fraction are probably the result of incomplete cell disruption, as determined by light microscopy (data not shown). These experiments were carried out in cells not loaded with cholesterol or incubated in the presence of an acceptor of cholesterol. We also examined caveolin expression in cells loaded with cholesterol (acetylated low density lipoprotein at 50 µg/ml) in the presence or absence of an ACAT inhibitor (SAH-58.035, 5 µg/ml). As we previously reported, loading macrophages with acetylated low density lipoprotein under these conditions results in a 3-fold increase in total cholesterol content with little change (absence of ACAT inhibitor) or a nearly 2-fold increase (presence of ACAT inhibitor) in unesterified cholesterol (23Dory L. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 809-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 content under these conditions is 109 ± 6 and 143 ± 18% (average ± S.E. of six experiments) of t"

https://openalex.org/W2334389336,"Based on the sites of frequent allelic loss in hepatocellular carcinoma, five normal human chromosomes (2, 4, 5, 10 and 16) were transferred individually into a telomerase-positive human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, Li7HM, by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT). Chromosome 10, but not the others, repressed telomerase activity immediately and stopped cell growth after 50 population doublings (PDs). Loss of the transferred 10p loci resulted in the emergence of revertant cells that continued to proliferate and expressed telomerase activity, suggesting the presence of a telomerase repressor gene on this chromosomal arm. Transfer of a series of defined fragments from chromosome 10p successfully narrowed down the responsible region: a 28.9-cM region on 10p15 (between WI-4752 and D10S249), but not a 26.2-cM region (between D10S1728 and D10S249), caused repression of telomerase activity and progressive telomere shortening. A strong correlation between the expression level of telomerase catalytic subunit gene (hTERT) and telomerase activity was observed. These findings suggest that a novel telomerase repressor gene which controls the expression of hTERT is located on the 2.7-cM region (between WI-4752 and D10S1728) on chromosome 10p15.1."

https://openalex.org/W2313943705,"We have identified a novel cDNA product designated transitional epithelial response gene (TERE1), which was localized to chromosome 1p36. The TERE1 transcript (1.5 and 3.5 kb) is present in most normal human tissues including urothelium, but was reduced or absent in the majority of muscle invasive TCC tumors (22 out of 29 cases). The open reading frame encodes a protein of 338 amino acids (MW 36.8 KD). This protein is 57% homologous to a Drosophila protein called heix. We have shown by Western blotting and immuno-histochemistry with a polyclonal antibody to a specific TERE1 peptide, reduced or absent staining in muscle invasive tumors. Transfection of a sense TERE1 construct resulted in an 80–90% inhibition of cellular proliferation in two TCC cell lines and a lack of aneuploidy in the TERE1-transduced J82 cell line. These data suggest a potential role for this gene product in the progression of bladder cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2323330711,"The leukemia-associated TEL-Jak2 fusion protein possesses a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and transforming properties in hematopoietic cell lines and animal models. In the murine pro-B Ba/F3 cell line, this fusion constitutively activates the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5 (Stat5) factors and, as a consequence, induces the sustained expression of various Stat5-target genes including the Cytokine Inducible SH2-containing protein (Cis) gene, which codes for a member of the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (Socs) protein family. In TEL-Jak2-transformed Ba/F3 cells, we also observed the upregulation of the Socs1 gene, whose product has been reported to negatively regulate the Jak kinase activity. In transient transfection experiments, Socs1 physically interacts with TEL-Jak2 and interferes with the TEL-Jak2-induced phosphorylation and activation of Stat5 factors, probably through the Socs1-induced proteasome-mediated degradation of the fusion protein. Interestingly, TEL-Jak2-expressing Ba/F3 cells were found to be resistant to the anti-proliferative activities of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) seemingly as a consequence of Socs1 constitutive expression. These results indicate that the Socs1-dependent cytokine feedback loop, although active, is bypassed by the TEL-Jak2 fusion, but may play a role in the leukemogenic process by altering the cytokine responses of the leukemic cells. Our results also suggest that Socs1 plays a role in shutting down the signaling from the normally activated Jak2 kinase by inducing its proteasome-dependent degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1971498887,"We isolated three related cDNA clones from a mouse cerebellar library; the type I cDNA was identical to the gene encoding the apoptosis-associated tyrosine kinase (AATYK), whose expression in myeloid precursor cells is increased during growth arrest or apoptosis. Low levels of AATYK mRNA expression were seen in adult mouse brains but not in embryos. In situ hybridization confirmed the widespread expression of AATYK mRNA in neurons throughout the adult brain. AATYK possessed tyrosine kinase activity and was autophosphorylated when expressed in 293 cells. AATYK mRNA expression was rapidly induced in cultured cerebellar granule cells during apoptosis induced by a low concentration of KCl (5 mM). Levels of endogenous AATYK protein were increased only slightly, but they were accompanied by an increase in molecular weight during apoptosis. Results of the tyrosine phosphatase treatments indicated that the increase in molecular weight was partly caused by tyrosine phosphorylation. The number of apoptotic granule cells overexpressing wild-type AATYK protein was significantly greater than the number of apoptotic granule cells overexpressing a mutant AATYK that lacked tyrosine kinase activity in low concentrations of KCl. These findings suggest that through its tyrosine kinase activity, AATYK is involved in the apoptosis of mature neurons."

https://openalex.org/W2330982233,"E2F-1 induces p53 accumulation and E2F-1 and p53 form a physical complex, which affects the ability of E2F-1 to activate transcription. We mapped the domains on E2F-1 that interact with p53 and found two p53-binding domains. To understand the functional consequences of the E2F-1/p53 association on p53 activities we identified the domains of E2F-1 that were responsible for the accumulation of p53. Unexpectedly, we found that the E2F-1 transactivation domain was dispensable for p53 induction. By contrast, further deletion of the DP-1 interaction/'marked' box domain eliminated p53 accumulation. Radiolabeling pulse/chase analysis demonstrated that E2F-1 caused post-translational stabilization of p53. Although E2F-1 caused the stabilization of p53, E2F-1 expression impaired p53-dependent transactivation. Thus, the E2F-1 : p53 interaction may provide a checkpoint function to inactivate overactive E2F-1, but the association may also inactivate p53 transactivation to allow cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W2320336142,"Recombinant human interferon gamma (r-hu-IFNγ) exerts both antitumoral activity in the early stages of human malignant mesothelioma and a cytostatic effect in human mesothelioma (HM) cell lines in vitro. The antiproliferative effect of interferons (IFNs) reported in a variety of cells has been attributed to several mechanisms. In order to progress in the understanding of HM cell growth modulation by r-hu-IFNγ, modifications of cell cycle progression and expression of key cell cycle regulator proteins in response to r-hu-IFNγ were examined. Nine HM cell lines were studied, including one resistant to the antiproliferative effect of r-hu-IFNγ. Except in the resistant cell line r-hu-IFNγ produced an arrest in the G1 and G2-M phases of the cell cycle, associated with a reduction in both cyclin A and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) expression. Moreover cyclin B1/cdc2 activity was decreased. The present study provides the first evidence of a G2-arrest in r-hu-IFNγ-treated HM cell lines and indicates that HM cell lines, despite their tumorigenic origin still support cell cycle control. The cell cycle arrest induced by r-hu-IFNγ seems to depend on cyclin regulation through p21WAF1/CIP1- and p27Kip1-independent mechanisms and is not directly related to the induced DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2010730585,"The low immunogenic B16 melanoma cell line was transfected with a mammalian expression vector containing the complementary DNA for a sIL-6R/IL-6 fusion protein, termed Hyper-IL-6 (H-IL-6), which was shown to have biological activities at 100-1000-fold lower concentrations than IL-6 in combination with sIL-6R. The secreted p84 glycoprotein was detected in the supernatant of transfected cells and was fully active on BAF3/gp130 cells, which respond to IL-6/sIL-6R but not to IL-6 alone. Administration of recombinant H-IL-6 to C57BL/6 mice resulted in a prolonged acute phase protein gene expression indicating long systemic persistence of the fusion protein. Transfected B16 cells (B16/H-IL6 cells) showed morphological alterations in combination with a dramatic growth inhibition in vitro. Subcutaneous injection in C57BL/6 mice resulted in an almost complete rejection of B16/H-IL6 cells. This effect was partially abolished in FVB/BL/6 mice transgenic for a GM-CSF receptor antagonist, indicating a GM-CSF-dependent rejection of H-IL-6 transfected B16 cells. These results demonstrate that the anti-tumor effect of cytokines like IL-6 which are secreted by transfected melanoma cells at least in part depends on GM-CSF activity."
https://openalex.org/W2312622201,"Cell adhesion promotes cellular proliferation through the regulation of gene expression, including the immediate early genes. However, the precise role of cell adhesion in the regulation of the c-Myc proto-oncogene is not clear, and the adhesion-dependent signaling pathway(s) regulating the expression of c-Myc has yet to be defined. We now show that integrin signaling directly regulates the expression of c-Myc in the mammary epithelial cell line 184A1N4 (A1N4). Adhesion of quiescent A1N4 cells to fibronectin, and to collagen types IV or I, induces the expression of c-Myc in an ECM concentration-dependent fashion. Cytoskeletal rearrangement, and integrin engagement and integrin clustering are required for the induction of c-Myc by fibronectin. Furthermore, beta1 integrin function-blocking antibodies prevent the adhesion-dependent induction of c-Myc. Adhesion of A1N4 cells results in the activation both of c-Src and of the Erk 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), each of which precedes the induction of c-Myc. Pharmacological inhibitors specific for either the c-Src family of kinases or for MEK1 block the adhesion-dependent induction of c-Myc. These observations indicate that beta1 integrins regulate the expression of c-Myc through the activation of the Src family of tyrosine kinases and the MAK kinase pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2325950410,"The AATYK gene encodes a tyrosine kinase whose expression is up-regulated during the apoptosis and differentiation of 32Dcl3 myelobalstic cells. Because high levels of AATYK mRNA have also been detected in the brain, and because these transcripts differ in size from that observed in the 32Dcl3 cell line, it was of interest to determine whether this gene encodes mRNAs that are alternatively spliced and whether these mRNAs are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. We have isolated a novel, alternatively spliced AATYK mRNA using cDNA library screening and RT–PCR, whose expression is readily detected in the brain but not myeloid cells. Western blot analysis revealed that the AATYK protein was expressed in virtually all regions of the adult rat brain in which neurons are present, including olfactory bulb, forebrain, cortex, midbrain, cerebellum and pons. Immunohistochemical labeling of adult brain sections showed the highest levels of AATYK expression in the cerebellum and olfactory bulb. Expression of AATYK was also up-regulated as a function of RA-induced neuronal differentiation of p19 embryonal carcinoma cells, supporting a role for this protein in mature neurons and neuronal differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2315764107,"Death ligands of the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) family are known to induce apoptosis upon binding to their cognate receptors. However, the clinical utility of these cytokines as anticancer agents has been limited due to unacceptable toxicity. TRAIL is a recently isolated death ligand that possesses selective anti-tumor activity against a number of cancer cell lines without significant systemic toxicity. In this report we present evidence that cell lines derived from Ewing's Sarcoma (ES) are uniformly sensitive to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, unlike TNF-alpha, treatment with TRAIL fails to induce the anti-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory NF-kappaB pathway in the ES cell lines. Our results suggest that TRAIL may prove to be a useful agent for the treatment of Ewing's sarcoma and related peripheral neuroectodermal tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2082785563,"The understanding of the organisation of cell cycle events is of utmost importance to devise effective therapeutic strategies for cancer. In this article we gather evidences from the literature in support of a system model of the cell cycle, in which a growth-sensitive threshold controls entry into S phase and the sequential activation of cyclin-dependent kinases. The cycle is terminated by an End function, that comprises events from the onset of mitosis to cell division and that may also be modulated by the increase of cell size. This blueprint allows quantitative predictions by computer simulations of steady and transitory states. In fact, we show that the proposed control system applies to budding yeast populations during nutritional shift-up and following hyperactivation of the cAMP signalling pathway. Besides the growth-sensitive control system it is shown to apply to mammalian cells both in the exit from quiescence and in active proliferation. The putative molecular determinants that set the threshold controlling S phase entry are consistently altered in cancer cells. Finally, we discuss an input/output analysis based on the simulated behaviour derived from the blueprint as a new tool to investigate the road to cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2329715736,"RepX represents a new informatics approach to probe the UniGene database for potentially polymorphic repeat sequences in the open reading frame (ORF) of genes, 56% of which were found to be actually polymorphic. We now have performed mutational analysis of 17 such sites in genes not found to be polymorphic (<0.03 frequency) in a large panel of human cancer genomic DNAs derived from 31 lung, 21 breast, seven ovarian, 21 (13 microsatellite instability (MSI)+ and eight MSI-) colorectal cancer cell lines. In the lung, breast and ovarian tumor DNAs we found no mutations (<0.03-0.04 rate of tumor associated open reading frame mutations) in these sequences. By contrast, 18 MSI+ colorectal cancers (13 cancer cell lines and five primary tumors) with mismatch repair defects exhibited six mutations in three of the 17 genes (SREBP-2, TAN-1, GR6) (P<0.000003 compared to all other cancers tested). We conclude that coding region microsatellite alterations are rare in lung, breast, ovarian carcinomas and MSI (-) colorectal cancers, but are relatively frequent in MSI (+) colorectal cancers with mismatch repair deficits."

https://openalex.org/W2334369231,"Thapsigargin (Tg), a selective inhibitor of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), causes depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores, hence activation of capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE). Incubation of Xenopus laevis oocytes with Tg resulted in an increased rate of progesterone-induced meiotic maturation. Non-mitochondrial 45Ca2+ uptake by SERCA-containing microsomes prepared from control wild-type oocytes microinjected with sterile water was inhibited essentially 100% by Tg. However, overexpression of Bcl-2, an oncogene known to protect against Tg-induced apoptosis in certain cell types, resulted in only 40% inhibition of microsomal 45Ca2+ uptake by Tg while non-inhibited 45Ca2+ uptake remained unchanged. Moreover Bcl-2 overexpression also protected against inhibition of CCE. ICl(Ca) was similar in Bcl-2-overexpressing and control oocytes when intracellular Ca2+ store depletion was induced by microinjection of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and other means and when CCE was induced by means independent of SERCA inhibition. Our data indicate that Bcl-2 affects neither the InsP3 receptor nor Ca2+ entry itself. At the end of a 24-h period after progesterone addition to the medium, only 25% of Bcl-2-overexpressing oocytes had matured compared to 85% of control oocytes. Our data suggest that SERCA participates in Xenopus oocyte maturation by controlling cytosolic Ca2+ and/or intracellular Ca2+ stores, hence CCE. An observed progesterone-dependent protein kinase-catalysed phosphorylation of SERCA is further indication of its role in oocyte maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2398615553,"v-ErbA is a mutated variant of thyroid hormone receptor (TRα/NR1A1) borne by the Avian Erythroblastosis virus causing erythroleukemia. TRα is known to activate transcription of specific genes in the presence of its cognate ligand, T3 hormone, while in its absence it represses it. v-ErbA is unable to bind ligand, and hence is thought to contribute to leukemogenesis by actively repressing erythroid-specific genes such as the carbonic anhydrase II gene (CA II). In the prevailing model, v-ErbA occludes liganded TR from binding to its cognate elements and constitutively interacts with the corepressors NCoR/SMRT. We previously identified a v-ErbA responsive element (VRE) within a DNase I hypersensitive region (HS2) located in the second intron of the CA II gene. We now show that HS2 fulfils all the requirements for a genuine enhancer that functions independent of its orientation and position with a profound erythroid-specific activity in normal erythroid progenitors (T2ECs) and in leukemic erythroid cell lines. We find that the HS2 enhancer activity is governed by two adjacent GATA-factor binding sites. v-ErbA as well as unliganded TR prevent HS2 activity by nullifying the positive function of factors bound to GATA-sites. However, v-ErbA, in contrast to TR, does not convey active repression to silence the transcriptional activity intrinsic to a heterologous tk promoter. We propose that depending on the sequence and context of the binding site, v-ErbA contributes to leukomogenesis by occluding liganded TR as well as unliganded TR thereby preventing activation or repression, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2317133023,"We previously reported that R7Δ447, a 2954-base-pair (bp) laboratory-generated Moloney murine sarcoma virus, induced subcutaneous tumors in about 14% of infected mice but did not induce brain lesions. We now report that R7Δ447K, a spontaneous mutant of R7Δ447, induced brain lesions as well as subcutaneous tumors in all injected mice. The genomes of the two viruses differ in a single base pair: the deduced Glu62 of the Mos residue of the R7Δ447 Gag-tMos protein is changed to Lys62. More R7Δ447 than R7Δ447K focus-forming units were detected in both NIH3T3 and mouse cerebral vascular endothelial (MCVE) cells. However, R7Δ447K transformed NIH3T3 and MCVE cells more acutely than did R7Δ447. A distinctive feature that distinguished the morphologic transformation of R7Δ447- and R7Δ447K-infected MCVE cells is the markedly prolonged spindle-shaped phase exhibited by R7Δ447-infected MCVE cells. In addition, R7Δ447K was more efficient in inducing the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 than R7Δ447 in both MCVE and NIH3T3 cells. Moreover morphologic transformation was inhibited, and levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 were reduced when R7Δ447- or R7Δ447K-infected NIH3T3 or MCVE cells were grown in the presence of the MEK1/2-specific inhibitor PD98095. Thus, we have identified a key residue in the Gag-tMos protein that profoundly affects activation of the Mos/MEK/ERK pathway, virus and cell replication, morphologic transformation in vitro and pathogenicity in vivo."
