https://openalex.org/W3216297445,"Quantum spin liquids, exotic phases of matter with topological order, have been a major focus in physics for the past several decades. Such phases feature long-range quantum entanglement that can potentially be exploited to realize robust quantum computation. We used a 219-atom programmable quantum simulator to probe quantum spin liquid states. In our approach, arrays of atoms were placed on the links of a kagome lattice, and evolution under Rydberg blockade created frustrated quantum states with no local order. The onset of a quantum spin liquid phase of the paradigmatic toric code type was detected by using topological string operators that provide direct signatures of topological order and quantum correlations. Our observations enable the controlled experimental exploration of topological matter and protected quantum information processing."

How then can we persuade more of the population at large to act for the greater good? Abaluck et al . undertook a large, cluster-randomized trial in Bangladesh involving hundreds of thousands of people (although mostly men) over a 2-month period. Colored masks of various construction were handed out free of charge, accompanied by a range of mask-wearing promotional activities inspired by marketing research. Using a grassroots network of volunteers to help conduct the study and gather data, the authors discovered that mask wearing averaged 13.3% in villages where no interventions took place but increased to 42.3% in villages where in-person interventions were introduced. Villages where in-person reinforcement of mask wearing occurred also showed a reduction in reporting COVID-like illness, particularly in high-risk individuals. —CA"
https://openalex.org/W3216031933,"The discovery of topological order has revised the understanding of quantum matter and provided the theoretical foundation for many quantum error–correcting codes. Realizing topologically ordered states has proven to be challenging in both condensed matter and synthetic quantum systems. We prepared the ground state of the toric code Hamiltonian using an efficient quantum circuit on a superconducting quantum processor. We measured a topological entanglement entropy near the expected value of –ln2 and simulated anyon interferometry to extract the braiding statistics of the emergent excitations. Furthermore, we investigated key aspects of the surface code, including logical state injection and the decay of the nonlocal order parameter. Our results demonstrate the potential for quantum processors to provide insights into topological quantum matter and quantum error correction."

Our objectives were to identify strategies that can persistently increase mask-wearing and assess the impact of increasing mask-wearing on symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. We conducted a cluster-randomized trial of community-level mask promotion in rural Bangladesh from November 2020 to April 2021 (N=600 villages, N=342,126 adults). We cross-randomized mask promotion strategies at the village and household level, including cloth vs. surgical masks. All intervention arms received free masks, information on the importance of masking, role modeling by community leaders, and in-person reminders for 8 weeks. The control group did not receive any interventions. Neither participants nor field staff were blinded to intervention assignment. Outcomes included symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence (primary) and prevalence of proper mask-wearing, physical distancing, and symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (secondary). Mask-wearing and physical distancing were assessed through direct observation at least weekly at mosques, markets, the main entrance roads to villages, and tea stalls. At 5 and 9 weeks follow-up, we surveyed all reachable participants about COVID-related symptoms. Blood samples collected at 10-12 weeks of follow-up for symptomatic individuals were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. There were 178,288 individuals in the intervention group and 163,838 individuals in the control group. The intervention increased proper mask-wearing from 13.3% in control villages (N=806,547 observations) to 42.3% in treatment villages (N=797,715 observations) (adjusted percentage point difference = 0.29 [0.27, 0.31]). This tripling of mask usage was sustained during the intervention period and two weeks after. Physical distancing increased from 24.1% in control villages to 29.2% in treatment villages (adjusted percentage point difference = 0.05 [0.04, 0.06]). After 5 months, the impact of the intervention faded, but mask-wearing remained 10 percentage points higher in the intervention group. The proportion of individuals with COVID-like symptoms was 7.62% (N=13,273) in the intervention arm and 8.62% (N=13,893) in the control arm. Blood samples were collected from N=10,952 consenting, symptomatic individuals. Adjusting for baseline covariates, the intervention reduced symptomatic seroprevalence by 9.3% (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) = 0.91 [0.82, 1.00]; control prevalence 0.76%; treatment prevalence 0.68%). In villages randomized to surgical masks (n = 200), the relative reduction was 11.2% overall (aPR = 0.89 [0.78, 1.00]) and 34.7% among individuals 60+ (aPR = 0.65 [0.46, 0.85]). No adverse events were reported.n"
https://openalex.org/W3217603912,"The impact of the initial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infecting strain on downstream immunity to heterologous variants of concern (VOCs) is unknown. Studying a longitudinal healthcare worker cohort, we found that after three antigen exposures (infection plus two vaccine doses), S1 antibody, memory B cells, and heterologous neutralization of B.1.351, P.1, and B.1.617.2 plateaued, whereas B.1.1.7 neutralization and spike T cell responses increased. Serology using the Wuhan Hu-1 spike receptor binding domain poorly predicted neutralizing immunity against VOCs. Neutralization potency against VOCs changed with heterologous virus encounter and number of antigen exposures. Neutralization potency fell differentially depending on targeted VOCs over the 5 months from the second vaccine dose. Heterologous combinations of spike encountered during infection and vaccination shape subsequent cross-protection against VOC, with implications for future-proof next-generation vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W3217375757,"For electrons to continuously enter and flow through the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), they must ultimately land on a terminal electron acceptor (TEA), which is known to be oxygen in mammals. Paradoxically, we find that complex I and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) can still deposit electrons into the ETC when oxygen reduction is impeded. Cells lacking oxygen reduction accumulate ubiquinol, driving the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex in reverse to enable electron deposition onto fumarate. Upon inhibition of oxygen reduction, fumarate reduction sustains DHODH and complex I activities. Mouse tissues display varying capacities to use fumarate as a TEA, most of which net reverse the SDH complex under hypoxia. Thus, we delineate a circuit of electron flow in the mammalian ETC that maintains mitochondrial functions under oxygen limitation."
https://openalex.org/W3215800873,"Many studies have examined the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants on neutralizing antibody activity after they have become dominant strains. Here, we evaluate the consequences of further viral evolution. We demonstrate mechanisms through which the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) can tolerate large numbers of simultaneous antibody escape mutations and show that pseudotypes containing up to seven mutations, as opposed to the one to three found in previously studied variants of concern, are more resistant to neutralization by therapeutic antibodies and serum from vaccine recipients. We identify an antibody that binds the RBD core to neutralize pseudotypes for all tested variants but show that the RBD can acquire an N-linked glycan to escape neutralization. Our findings portend continued emergence of escape variants as SARS-CoV-2 adapts to humans."
https://openalex.org/W3216666478,"Coherent upconversion of terahertz and mid-infrared signals into visible light opens new horizons for spectroscopy, imaging, and sensing but represents a challenge for conventional nonlinear optics. Here, we used a plasmonic nanocavity hosting a few hundred molecules to demonstrate optomechanical transduction of submicrowatt continuous-wave signals from the mid-infrared (32 terahertz) onto the visible domain at ambient conditions. The incoming field resonantly drives a collective molecular vibration, which imprints a coherent modulation on a visible pump laser and results in upconverted Raman sidebands with subnatural linewidth. Our dual-band nanocavity offers an estimated 13 orders of magnitude enhancement in upconversion efficiency per molecule. Our results demonstrate that molecular cavity optomechanics is a flexible paradigm for frequency conversion leveraging tailorable molecular and plasmonic properties."
https://openalex.org/W3215172065,"Coherent interconversion of signals between optical and mechanical domains is enabled by optomechanical interactions. Extreme light-matter coupling produced by confining light to nanoscale mode volumes can then access single mid-infrared (MIR) photon sensitivity. Here, we used the infrared absorption and Raman activity of molecular vibrations in plasmonic nanocavities to demonstrate frequency upconversion. We converted approximately 10-micrometer-wavelength incoming light to visible light by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) in doubly resonant antennas that enhanced upconversion by more than 1010. We showed 140% amplification of the SERS anti-Stokes emission when an MIR pump was tuned to a molecular vibrational frequency, obtaining lowest detectable powers of 1 to 10 microwatts per square micrometer at room temperature. These results have potential for low-cost and large-scale infrared detectors and spectroscopic techniques."

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major threat to pediatric patients and older adults. We describe 4′-fluorouridine (4′-FlU, EIDD-2749), a ribonucleoside analog that inhibits RSV, related RNA viruses, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with high selectivity index in cells and human airway epithelia organoids. Polymerase inhibition within in vitro RNA-dependent RNA polymerase assays established for RSV and SARS-CoV-2 revealed transcriptional stalling after incorporation. Once-daily oral treatment was highly efficacious at 5 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) in RSV-infected mice or 20 mg/kg in ferrets infected with different SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, initiated 24 or 12 hours after infection, respectively. These properties define 4′-FlU as a broad-spectrum candidate for the treatment of RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and related RNA virus infections."

https://openalex.org/W3216195572,"School closures due to the COVID-19 global pandemic are likely to have a range of negative consequences spanning the domains of child development, education and health, in addition to the widening of inequalities and inequities. Research is required to improve understanding of the impact of school closures on the education, health and wellbeing of pupils and school staff, the challenges posed during face-to-face reopening and importantly to identify how the impacts of these challenges can be addressed going forward to inform emerging policy and practice. This qualitative study aimed to reflect on the perspectives and experiences of primary school staff (pupils aged 3–11) in Wales regarding school closures and the initial face-to-face reopening of schools and to identify recommendations for the future. A total of 208 school staff completed a national online survey through the HAPPEN primary school network, consisting of questions about school closures (March to June 2020), the phased face-to-face reopening of schools (June to July 2020) and a return to face-to-face education. Thematic analysis of survey responses highlighted that primary school staff perceive that gaps in learning, health and wellbeing have increased and inequalities have widened during school closures. Findings from this study identified five recommendations; (i) prioritise the health and wellbeing of pupils and staff; (ii) focus on enabling parental engagement and support; (iii) improve digital competence amongst pupils, teachers and parents; (iv) consider opportunities for smaller class sizes and additional staffing; and (v) improve the mechanism of communication between schools and families, and between government and schools."
https://openalex.org/W4221069362,"The study of quantum phase transitions that are not clearly associated with broken symmetry is a major effort in condensed matter physics, particularly in regard to the problem of high-temperature superconductivity, for which such transitions are thought to underlie the mechanism of superconductivity itself. Here we argue that the putative quantum critical point in the prototypical unconventional superconductor CeCoIn5 is characterized by the delocalization of electrons in a transition that connects two Fermi surfaces of different volumes, with no apparent broken symmetry. Drawing on established theory of f-electron metals, we discuss an interpretation for such a transition that involves the fractionalization of spin and charge, a model that effectively describes the anomalous transport behavior we measured for the Hall effect."
https://openalex.org/W3216289208,"The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted schooling for children worldwide. Most vulnerable are non-citizen children without access to public education. This study aims to explore challenges faced in achieving education access for children of refugee and asylum-seekers, migrant workers, stateless and undocumented persons in Malaysia during the pandemic. In-depth interviews of 33 stakeholders were conducted from June 2020 to March 2021. Data were thematically analysed. Our findings suggest that lockdowns disproportionately impacted non-citizen households as employment, food and housing insecurity were compounded by xenophobia, exacerbating pre-existing inequities. School closures disrupted school meals and deprived children of social interaction needed for mental wellbeing. Many non-citizen children were unable to participate in online learning due to the scarcity of digital devices, and poor internet connectivity, parental support, and home learning environments. Teachers were forced to adapt to online learning and adopt alternative arrangements to ensure continuity of learning and prevent school dropouts. The lack of government oversight over learning centres meant that measures taken were not uniform. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an opportunity for the design of more inclusive national educational policies, by recognising and supporting informal learning centres, to ensure that no child is left behind."

Clinical samples were collected, inoculated, and incubated for each sample in accordance with standard protocol. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Identification was done using the traditional biochemical method. Multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant isolates were classified using a standardized definition established by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the United States Centers for Disease Prevention and Control. Gram-negative organisms with reduced susceptibility to carbapenem antibiotics were considered candidate carbapenemase producers and subjected to modified carbapenem inactivation and simplified carbapenem inactivation methods. Meropenem with EDTA was used to differentiate metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) from serine carbapenemase. Meropenem (MRP)/meropenem + phenylboronic acid (MBO) were used to differentiate Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) from other serine carbapenemase producing gram-negative organisms.A total of 1,337 clinical specimens were analyzed, of which 429 gram-negative bacterial isolates were recovered. Out of 429 isolates, 319, 74, and 36 were Enterobacterales, Acinetobacter species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa respectively. In our study, the prevalence of multidrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant, carbapenemase-producing, and carbapenem nonsusceptible gram-negative bacilli were 45.2%, 7.7%, 5.4%, and 15.4% respectively. Out of 429 isolates, 66 demonstrated reduced susceptibility to the antibiotics meropenem and imipenem. These isolates were tested for carbapenemase production of which 34.8% (23/66) were carbapenemase producers. Out of 23 carbapenemase positive gram-negative bacteria, ten (10) and thirteen (13) were metallo-beta-lactamase and serine carbapenemase respectively. Three of 13 serine carbapenemase positive organisms were Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase.This study revealed an alarming level of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), with a high prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extremely drug-resistant, carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria, particularly among intensive care unit patients at the health facility level. These findings point to a scenario in which clinical management of infected patients becomes increasingly difficult and necessitates the use of ""last-resort"" antimicrobials likely exacerbating the magnitude of the global AMR crisis. This mandates robust AMR monitoring and an infection prevention and control program."

https://openalex.org/W3215152711,"To test the safety and efficacy of drugs via a high does drug heat map, a multi-spheroids array chip was developed by adopting a micropillar and microwell structure. In the chip, patient-derived cells were encapsulated in alginate and grown to maturity for more than 7 days to form cancer multi-spheroids. Multi-spheroids grown in conventional well plates require many cells and are easily damaged as a result of multiple pipetting during maintenance culture or experimental procedures. To address these issues, we applied a micropillar and microwell structure to the multi-spheroids array. Patient-derived cells from patients with Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and lethal form of central nervous system cancer, were used to validate the array chip performance. After forming multi-spheroids with a diameter greater than 100μm in a 12×36 pillar array chip (25mm × 75mm), we tested 70 drug compounds (6 replicates) using a high-dose to determine safety and efficacy for drug candidates. Comparing the drug response of multi-spheroids derived from normal cells and cancer cells, we found that four compounds (Dacomitinib, Cediranib, LY2835219, BGJ398) did not show toxicity to astrocyte cell and were efficacious to patient-derived GBM cells."
https://openalex.org/W3216158317,"Despite advances in its scientific understanding, dyslexia is still associated with rampant public misconceptions. Here, we trace these misconceptions to the interaction between two intuitive psychological principles: Dualism and Essentialism. We hypothesize that people essentialize dyslexia symptoms that they anchor in the body. Experiment 1 shows that, when dyslexia is associated with visual confusions (b/d reversals)-symptoms that are naturally viewed as embodied (in the eyes), laypeople consider dyslexia as more severe, immutable, biological, and heritable, compared to when dyslexia is linked to difficulties with phonological decoding (a symptom seen as less strongly embodied). Experiments 2-3 show that the embodiment of symptoms plays a causal role in promoting essentialist thinking. Experiment 2 shows that, when participants are provided evidence that the symptoms of dyslexia are embodied (i.e., they ""show up"" in a brain scan), people are more likely to consider dyslexia as heritable compared to when the same symptoms are diagnosed behaviorally (without any explicit evidence for the body). Finally, Experiment 3 shows that reasoning about the severity of dyslexia symptoms can be modulated by manipulating people's attitudes about the mind/body links, generally. These results show how public attitudes towards psychological disorders arise from the very principles that make the mind tick."
https://openalex.org/W3216278759,"Whole blood viscosity (WBV) is increased in cancer patients and associated with the advanced stage with systemic metastases. However, relevance of WBV in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. This pilot study included a discovery cohort of 148 treatment-naïve HCC patients with preserved liver function, and a validation cohort of 33 treatment-experienced HCC patients with nivolumab. Systolic and diastolic WBV was measured using an automated scanning capillary tube viscometer at diagnosis or before the nivolumab treatment. Extrahepatic metastases were observed in 15 treatment-naïve patients (11.3%) at diagnosis. Portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT), tumor size, number of tumors, and systolic/diastolic WBV were factors associated with extrahepatic metastases. Systolic WBV and diastolic WBV were significantly increased in patients with metastases compared with patients without metastases. Multivariate logistic regression showed that high diastolic WBV &gt; 16 cP was an independent factor associated with metastases. Notably, patients who developed extrahepatic metastases during the observation period among patients without metastases at diagnosis had higher diastolic WBV initially. Patients with high diastolic WBV had poor survival, and multivariate Cox regression analyses showed high diastolic WBV was an independent risk factor for poor survival with the Child-Pugh B7 and PVTT. High diastolic WBV also predicted poor survival in patients with low alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and proteins induced by vitamin K antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) levels. In 33 nivolumab-treated patients, high diastolic WBV before the treatment was also tended to be associated with overall and progression-free survival. Our study is the first in which high WBV is associated with the distant metastases and survival in patients with HCC, but future prospective, large cohort studies are necessary to validate the results."

This has created a need for rapid, scalable comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) systems that detect an increasing number of therapeutically-relevant variant types and molecular signatures. In this study, we assessed the analytical performance of the TruSight Oncology 500 High-Throughput assay for detection of somatic alterations from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimens. In parallel, we developed supporting software and automated sample preparation systems designed to process up to 70 clinical samples in a single NovaSeq 6000TM sequencing run with a turnaround time of <7 days from specimen receipt to report. The results demonstrate that the scalable assay accurately and reproducibly detects small variants, copy number alterations, microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) from 40ng DNA, and multiple gene fusions, including known and unknown partners and splice variants from 20ng RNA. 717 tumor samples and reference materials with previously known alterations in 96 cancer-related genes were sequenced to evaluate assay performance. All variant classes were reliably detected at consistent and reportable variant allele percentages with >99% overall accuracy and precision. Our results demonstrate that the high-throughput CGP assay is a reliable method for accurate detection of molecular alterations in support of precision therapeutics in oncology. The supporting systems and scalable workflow allow for efficient interpretation and prompt reporting of hundreds of patient cancer genomes per week with excellent analytical performance."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of school-based supportive interventions for AYLHIV in Kenya. From 2016-2019, with funding from ViiV Healthcare, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation implemented the innovative Red Carpet Program (RCP) for AYLHIV in participating public healthcare facilities and boarding schools in Homa Bay and Turkana Counties in Kenya. In this analysis, we report the implementation of the school-based interventions for AYLHIV in schools, which included: a) capacity building for overall in-school HIV, stigma and sexual and reproductive health education; b) HIV care and treatment support; c) bi-directional linkages with healthcare facilities; and d) psychosocial support (PSS). Overall, 561 school staff and 476 school adolescent health advocates received training to facilitate supportive environments for AYLHIV and school-wide education on HIV, stigma, and sexual and reproductive health. All 87 boarding schools inter-linked to 66 regional healthcare facilities to support care and treatment of AYLHIV. Across all RCP schools, 546 AYLHIV had their HIV status disclosed to school staff and received supportive care within schools, including treatment literacy and adherence counselling, confidential storage and access to HIV medications. School-based interventions to optimize care and treatment support for AYLHIV are feasible and contribute to advancing sexual and reproductive health within schools."
https://openalex.org/W3216950429,"In state-of-the-art energy systems modelling, reservoir hydropower is represented as any other thermal power plant: energy production is constrained by the plant's installed capacity and a capacity factor calibrated on the energy produced in previous years. Natural water resource variability across different temporal scales and the subsequent filtering effect of water storage mass balances are not accounted for, leading to biased optimal power dispatch strategies. In this work, we aim at introducing a novelty in the field by advancing the representation of reservoir hydropower generation in energy systems modelling by explicitly including the most relevant hydrological constraints, such as time-dependent water availability, hydraulic head, evaporation losses, and cascade releases. This advanced characterization is implemented in an open-source energy modelling framework. The improved model is then demonstrated on the Zambezi River Basin in the South Africa Power Pool. The basin has an estimated hydropower potential of 20,000 megawatts (MW) of which about 5,000 MW has been already developed. Results show a better alignment of electricity production with observed data, with a reduction of estimated hydropower production up to 35% with respect to the baseline Calliope implementation. These improvements are useful to support hydropower management and planning capacity expansion in countries richly endowed with water resource or that are already strongly relying on hydropower for electricity production."

To calculate the birth prevalence of children with isolated or non-isolated clubfoot between 1st of January 2016 and 31st of December 2019, we used official reports of the total number of Swedish live births from the Swedish Board of Statistics. The Pirani score and predefined signs of atypical clubfoot were used to classify clubfoot severity at birth.In total 612 children with clubfoot were identified. Of these, 564 were children with isolated clubfoot, generating a birth prevalence of 1.24/1000 live births (95% confidence interval 1.15-1.35). About 8% were children with non-isolated clubfoot, increasing the birth prevalence to 1.35/1000 live births (95% confidence interval 1.25-1.46). Of the children with isolated clubfoot, 74% were boys and 47% had bilateral involvement. The children with non-isolated clubfoot had more severe foot deformities at birth and a greater proportion of clubfeet with atypical signs compared with children with isolated clubfoot.We have established the birth prevalence of children born with isolated or non-isolated clubfoot in Sweden based on data from a national register. Moreover, we have estimated the number of children born with atypical clubfeet in instances of both isolated and non-isolated clubfoot. These numbers may serve as a baseline for expected birth prevalence when planning clubfoot treatment and when evaluating time trends of children born with clubfoot."

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by a progressive loss of cartilage; oxidative stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of OA. The objectives of this study were to investigate the in vivo effects of the GLM on pain severity and cartilage degeneration using an experimental rat OA model, and to explore the mode of action of GLM. OA was induced in rats by intra-articular injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) into the knee. Oral GLM was initiated on the day after 3dyas of MIA injection. Limb nociception was assessed by measuring the paw withdrawal latency and threshold. Samples were analyzed both macroscopically and histologically. Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, nitrotyrosine, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in knee joints. Also, the GLM was applied to OA chondrocyte, and the expression on catabolic marker and necroptosis factor were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Administration of the GLM improved pain levels by preventing cartilage damage and inflammation. GLM significantly attenuated the expression levels of mRNAs encoding matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), MMP-13, and ADAMTS5 in IL-1β-stimulated human OA chondrocytes. GLM decreased the expression levels of the necroptosis mediators RIPK1, RIPK3, and the mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) in IL-1β-stimulated human OA chondrocytes. Thus, GLM reduced pain and cartilage degeneration in rats with experimentally induced OA. The chondroprotective properties of GLM included suppression of oxidative damage and inhibition of catabolic factors implicated in the pathogenesis of OA cartilage damage. We suggest that GLM may usefully treat human OA."

https://openalex.org/W3215783017,"First possession is a common heuristic people use to solve property conflicts. Previous studies examined whether young children judged ownership based on the first possession heuristic and its stability when conflicting with other cues such as labor, but few focused on the effects in the discovery context. In this study, we used two discovery stories which indicate the discovered object was not owned by anyone beforehand and investigated ownership reasoning with the first possession heuristic in Chinese 3- to 6-year-old preschoolers. By pitting the first possession cue against the labor cue, we investigated the stability of the first possession heuristic in young children's ownership reasoning. The results showed that in the condition where there was only the first possession cue, both the younger and older groups used the first possession heuristic to reason about ownership. However, in the labor condition, 5- and 6-year-olds ceased to support the first possessor and turned to assign objects to the laborer, whereas 3-year-old children still insisted on the first possession heuristic (Study 1 and Study 2). Children across four age groups did not assign ownership to the person who just played with the object but did not modify it (Study 2). The results demonstrate that Chinese preschoolers understand the role of first possession in ownership assignment at an early age in the discovery context but the elderly preschoolers do not rely on the first possession cue when there are conflicting cues such as labor."

https://openalex.org/W3217091740,"Team formation (TF) in social networks exploits graphs (i.e., vertices = experts and edges = skills) to represent a possible collaboration between the experts. These networks lead us towards building cost-effective research teams irrespective of the geolocation of the experts and the size of the dataset. Previously, large datasets were not closely inspected for the large-scale distributions & relationships among the researchers, resulting in the algorithms failing to scale well on the data. Therefore, this paper presents a novel TF algorithm for expert team formation called SSR-TF based on two metrics; communication cost and graph reduction, that will become a basis for future TF's. In SSR-TF, communication cost finds the possibility of collaboration between researchers. The graph reduction scales the large data to only appropriate skills and the experts, resulting in real-time extraction of experts for collaboration. This approach is tested on five organic and benchmark datasets, i.e., UMP, DBLP, ACM, IMDB, and Bibsonomy. The SSR-TF algorithm is able to build cost-effective teams with the most appropriate experts-resulting in the formation of more communicative teams with high expertise levels."

Therefore, the analysis of representative hormones with acetamiprid (AC) and azoxystrobin (AZ) was a good strategy for the investigation of the endocrine-disrupting activity of pesticides. Hence, a sensitive and rapid analytical method using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was developed. The method was validated for the analysis of AC, AZ, estriol, estrone, progesterone, and testosterone in the serum, testis, and liver of rats. The correlation between the residues of pesticides and the disturbance of the endocrine system was evaluated. The different mass parameters, mobile phase types, analytical columns, injection volumes, and extraction solvents were compared to get the lowest limit of detection of the studied compounds. The detection limits of AC, AZ, estriol, estrone, progesterone, and testosterone were 0.05, 0.05, 1.0, 10, and 1.0 ng/ml, respectively. The method developed was applied to evaluate the changes in these hormones induced by the duration of exposure to AC and AZ in rat testis and serum. The hormones level in rat serum and testis had a significant decrease as they were oral gavage treated with different high concentrations of studied pesticides. Both pesticides were distributed in the body of rats by the multi-compartment model (liver, testis, and serum)."
https://openalex.org/W4226401741,"Bangladesh is one of the countries where the prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as hypertension is rising due to rising living standards, sedentary lifestyles, and epidemiological transition. Among the NCDs, hypertension is a major risk factor for CVD, accounting for half of all coronary heart disease worldwide. However, detailed research in this area has been limited in Bangladesh. The objective of the study was to estimate changes in the prevalence and risk factors of hypertension among Bangladeshi adult population. The study also sought to identify socioeconomic status-related inequality of hypertension prevalence in Bangladesh.Cross-sectional analysis was conducted using nationally representative two waves of the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) in 2011 and 2017-18. Survey participants were adults 18 years or older- which included detailed biomarker and anthropometric measurements of 23539 participants. The change in prevalence of hypertension was estimated, and adjusted odds ratios were obtained using multivariable survey logistic regression models. Further, Wagstaff decomposition method was also used to analyze the relative contributions of factors to hypertension.From 2011 to 2018, the hypertension prevalence among adults aged ≥35 years increased from 25.84% to 39.40% (p<0.001), with the largest relative increase (97%) among obese individuals. The prevalence among women remained higher than men whereas the relative increase among men and women were 75% and 39%, respectively. Regression analysis identified age and BMI as the independent risk factors of hypertension. Other risk factors of hypertension were sex, marital status, education, geographic region, wealth index, and diabetes status in both survey years. Female adults had significantly higher hypertension risk in both survey years in the overall analysis in, however, in the subgroup analysis, the gender difference in hypertension risk was not significant in rural 2011 and urban 2018 samples. Decomposition analysis revealed that the contributions of socio-economic status related inequality of hypertension in 2011 were46.58% and 20.85% for wealth index and BMI, respectively. However, the contributions of wealth index and BMI have shifted to 12.60% and 55.29%, respectively in 2018.The prevalence of hypertension among Bangladeshi adults has increased significantly, and there is no subgroup where it is decreasing. Population-level approaches directed at high-risk groups (overweight, obese) should be implemented thoroughly. We underscore prevention strategies by following strong collaboration with stakeholders in the health system of the country to adopt healthy lifestyle choices."

https://openalex.org/W3215432546,"Toxoplasmosis is caused by an obligate intracellular tissue protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii that infect humans and other warm-blooded animals. Transmission to humans is by eating raw or inadequately cooked infected meat or through ingestion of oocysts that cats have passed in faeces. Studies have shown life-threatening and substantial neurologic damage in immunocompromised patients; however, 80% of humans remain asymptomatic. The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii infection in HIV positive patients and the risk factors associated with the infection, and to investigate the correlation between CD4+ T-cell count and toxoplasma specific antibodies as possible predictors of each other amongst HIV patients in the Bamenda Health District of the North West Region of Cameroon.A cross-sectional study was conducted, in which 325 HIV patients were recruited for administration of questionnaire, serological diagnosis of T. gondii and measurement of CD4+ T-cell count. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors associated with T. gondii infection while the linear regression was used to investigate the relationship between CD4+ T-cell count and antibody levels against T. gondii.The findings showed that, majority (45.8%) of HIV patients suffered from chronic (IgG antibody) infection, and 6.5% from acute (IgM and IgM/IgG antibody) toxoplasma infection. The overall sero-prevalence of T. gondii infection amongst HIV patients was 50.5%. On the whole, 43 men (45.7%) and 127 women (55%) presented with anti- T. gondii antibodies; however, there was no significant difference amongst males and females who were positive to T. gondii infection (p = 0.131). Marital status (p = 0.0003), contact with garden soil (p = 0.0062), and garden ownership (p = 0.009), were factors that showed significant association with T. gondii infection. There was no significant difference (p = 0.909) between the mean CD4+ T-cell count of HIV patients negative for toxoplasma infection (502.7 cells/mL), chronically infected with T. gondii (517.7 cells/mL) and acutely infected with T. gondii (513.1 cells/mL). CD4+ T-cell count was neither a predictor of IgM antibody titer (r = 0.193, p = 0.401), nor IgG antibody titer (r = 0.149, p = 0.519) amongst HIV patients acutely infected with T. gondii.The findings from this study underscore the need to implement preventive and control measures to fight against T. gondii infection amongst HIV patients in the Bamenda Health District."
https://openalex.org/W3215572023,"While the existence of a human mirror neuron system is evident, the involved brain areas and their exact functional roles remain under scientific debate. A number of functionally different mirror neuron types, neurons that selectively respond to specific grasp phases and types for example, have been reported with single cell recordings in monkeys. In humans, spatially limited, intracranially recorded electrophysiological signals in the high-gamma (HG) range have been used to investigate the human mirror system, as they are associated with spiking activity in single neurons. Our goal here is to complement previous intracranial HG studies by using magnetoencephalography to record HG activity simultaneously from the whole head. Participants performed a natural reach-to-grasp movement observation and delayed imitation task with different everyday objects and grasp types. This allowed us to characterize the spatial organization of cortical areas that show HG-activation modulation during movement observation (mirroring), retention (mnemonic mirroring), and execution (motor control). Our results show mirroring related HG modulation patterns over bilateral occipito-parietal as well as sensorimotor areas. In addition, we found mnemonic mirroring related HG modulation over contra-lateral fronto-temporal areas. These results provide a foundation for further human mirror system research as well as possible target areas for brain-computer interface and neurorehabilitation approaches."

The occurrence and development of tumors is a multi-gene and multi-stage complex process. As an oncogene, ribosomal oxygenase 2 (RIOX2) has been associated with a variety of cancers. In this article, we analyzed the correlation between RIOX2 expression and methylation in lung cancer based on the databases including the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) and the gene expression omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). It was found that RIOX2 is highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) tissues, whose expression is negatively correlated with its methylation level. In this regard, methylation at cg09716038, cg14773523, cg14941179, and cg22299097 had a significant negative correlation with RIOX2 expression in LUAD, whereas in LUSC, methylation at cg09716038, cg14773523, cg14941179, cg22299097, cg05451573, cg10779801, and cg23629183 is negatively correlated with RIOX2 expression. According to the analysis based on the databases, RIOX2 gene could not be considered as the independent prognostic biomarker in lung adenocarcinoma or squamous cell lung cancer. However, the molecular mechanism of RIOX2 gene in the development of lung cancer may be helpful in improving lung cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3217106900,"Systemic interleukin-12 (IL12) anti-tumor therapy is highly potent but has had limited utility in the clinic due to severe toxicity. Here, we present two IL12-expressing vector platforms, both of which can overcome the deficiencies of previous systemic IL12 therapies: 1) an integrating lentiviral vector, and 2) a self-replicating messenger RNA formulated with polyethyleneimine. Intratumoral administration of either IL12 vector platform resulted in recruitment of immune cells, including effector T cells and dendritic cells, and the complete remission of established tumors in multiple murine models. Furthermore, concurrent intratumoral administration of the synthetic TLR4 agonist g lucopyranosyl l ipid A formulated in a s table e mulsion (GLA-SE) induced systemic memory T cell responses that mediated complete protection against tumor rechallenge in all survivor mice (8/8 rechallenged mice), whereas only 2/6 total rechallenged mice treated with intratrumoral IL12 monotherapy rejected the rechallenge. Taken together, expression of vectorized IL12 in combination with a TLR4 agonist represents a varied approach to broaden the applicability of intratumoral immune therapies of solid tumors."
https://openalex.org/W3217721566,"Herbicides are widely used in agricultural practices for preventing the proliferation of weeds. Upon reaching soil and water, herbicides can harm nontarget organisms, such as bacteria, which need an efficient defense mechanism to tolerate stress induced by herbicides. 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is a herbicide that exerts increased oxidative stress among bacterial communities. Bacterial isolates were obtained from the biofilm of tanks containing washing water from the packaging of different pesticides, including 2,4-D. The Pseudomonas sp. CMA-7.3 was selected because of its tolerance against 2,4-D toxicity, among several sensitive isolates from the biofilm collection. This study aimed to evaluate the antioxidative response system of the selected strain to 2,4-D. It was analyzed the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and guaiacol peroxidase GPX enzymes, that are poorly known in the literature for bacterial systems. The Pseudomonas sp. CMA-7.3 presented an efficient response system in balancing the production of hydrogen peroxide, even at 25x the dose of 2,4-D used in agriculture. The antioxidative system was composed of Fe-SOD enzymes, less common than Mn-SOD in bacteria, and through the activities of KatA and KatB isoforms, working together with APX and GPX, having their activities coordinated possibly by quorum sensing molecules. The peroxide control is poorly documented for bacteria, and this work is unprecedented for Pseudomonas and 2,4-D. Not all bacteria harbor efficient response system to herbicides, therefore they could affect the diversity and functionality of microbiome in contaminated soils, thereby impacting agricultural production, environment sustainability and human health."
https://openalex.org/W3215232996,"Sediment and nutrient retention are essential ecosystem functions that floodplains provide and that improve river water quality. During floods, the floodplain vegetation retains sediment, which settles on plant surfaces and the soil underneath plants. Both sedimentation processes require that flow velocity is reduced, which may be caused by the topographic features and the vegetation structure of the floodplain. However, the relative importance of these two drivers and their key components have rarely been both quantified. In addition to topographic factors, we expect vegetation height and density, mean leaf size and pubescence, as well as species diversity of the floodplain vegetation to increase the floodplain’s capacity for sedimentation. To test this, we measured sediment and nutrients (carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus) both on the vegetation itself and on sediment traps underneath the vegetation after a flood at 24 sites along the River Mulde (Germany). Additionally, we measured biotic and topographic predictor variables. Sedimentation on the vegetation surface was positively driven by plant biomass and the height variation of the vegetation, and decreased with the hydrological distance (total R 2 = 0.56). Sedimentation underneath the vegetation was not driven by any vegetation characteristics but decreased with hydrological distance (total R 2 = 0.42). Carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus content in the sediment on the traps increased with the total amount of sediment (total R 2 = 0.64, 0.62 and 0.84, respectively), while C, N and P on the vegetation additionally increased with hydrological distance (total R 2 = 0.80, 0.79 and 0.92, respectively). This offers the potential to promote sediment and especially nutrient retention via vegetation management, such as adapted mowing. The pronounced signal of the hydrological distance to the river emphasises the importance of a laterally connected floodplain with abandoned meanders and morphological depressions. Our study improves our understanding of the locations where floodplain management has its most significant impact on sediment and nutrient retention to increase water purification processes."

Investor’s and regulator’s penalty rates are described as public and institutional reputations, respectively. We achieved the available conditions of single-rating and dual-rating regulations to prevent rating inflation in this model. To examine the regulatory effects of different types of regulations on Chinese corporate bond ratings, we utilize panel ordered logit models. Theoretical analysis and empirical tests show that, when the reputation effect is low, the single-rating regulation is better at improving rating quality, and when the reputation effect is high, the dual-rating regulation induces rating agencies to provide more accurate ratings. Compared to the regulatory effects of the single-rating and the multi-rating regulations, the dual-rating regulation most effectively improves the rating quality of corporate bonds and prevents rating inflation."

With the emphasis on sustainability in transportation, bike-sharing systems is an emerging topic of urban transport and sustainable mobility related research. Existing studies mainly explored the factors affecting individuals’ initial intentions to start using a shared bicycle, but few looked at the likelihood that a user would continue using one This study proposed a structural equation model with bike-sharing purchase decision involvement as independent variable, bike-sharing willingness to use as dependent variable, traveler participation and traveler perceived value as intermediary variables by introducing the concepts of purchase decision involvement, customer participation and perceived value in consumer psychology and behavior. A survey on bike-sharing users in Xi’an was conducted online and offline, and 622 effective responses were collected. The research model was tested by Amos 24.0 and the empirical results showed that All influencing factors including bike-sharing’s purchase decision-making involvement, traveler participation and traveler’s perceived value are found to be significantly and positively associated with usage intention; traveler perceived value play a chain-mediating role between bike-sharing purchase decision involvement and usage intention; bike-sharing purchase decision involvement have indirect effects on traveler perceived value through traveler participation. The results of this study enrich the current research’s in the field of sharing economy, and it is certain guiding significant for how to obtain and maintain stable customers in bicycle-sharing industry."
https://openalex.org/W3215469143,"A convenient geometrical description of the microvascular network is necessary for computationally efficient mathematical modelling of liver perfusion, metabolic and other physiological processes. The tissue models currently used are based on the generally accepted schematic structure of the parenchyma at the lobular level, assuming its perfect regular structure and geometrical symmetries. Hepatic lobule, portal lobule, or liver acinus are considered usually as autonomous functional units on which particular physiological problems are studied. We propose a new periodic unit-the liver representative periodic cell (LRPC) and establish its geometrical parametrization. The LRPC is constituted by two portal lobulae, such that it contains the liver acinus as a substructure. As a remarkable advantage over the classical phenomenological modelling approaches, the LRPC enables for multiscale modelling based on the periodic homogenization method. Derived macroscopic equations involve so called effective medium parameters, such as the tissue permeability, which reflect the LRPC geometry. In this way, mutual influences between the macroscopic phenomena, such as inhomogeneous perfusion, and the local processes relevant to the lobular (mesoscopic) level are respected. The LRPC based model is intended for its use within a complete hierarchical model of the whole liver. Using the Double-permeability Darcy model obtained by the homogenization, we illustrate the usefulness of the LRPC based modelling to describe the blood perfusion in the parenchyma."
https://openalex.org/W3215588283,"This study investigated 12-year blood lipid trajectories and whether these trajectories are modified by smoking and lipid lowering treatment in older Russians. To do so, we analysed data on 9,218 Russian West-Siberian Caucasians aged 45–69 years at baseline participating in the international HAPIEE cohort study. Mixed-effect multilevel models were used to estimate individual level lipid trajectories across the baseline and two follow-up examinations (16,445 separate measurements over 12 years). In all age groups, we observed a reduction in serum total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C and non-HDL-C over time even after adjusting for sex, statin treatment, hypertension, diabetes, social factors and mortality (P&lt;0.01). In contrast, serum triglyceride (TG) values increased over time in younger age groups, reached a plateau and decreased in older age groups (&gt; 60 years at baseline). In smokers, TC, LDL-C, non-HDL-C and TG decreased less markedly than in non-smokers, while HDL-C decreased more rapidly while the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio increased. In subjects treated with lipid-lowering drugs, TC, LDL-C and non-HDL-C decreased more markedly and HDL-C less markedly than in untreated subjects while TG and LDL-C/HDL-C remained stable or increased in treatment naïve subjects. We conclude, that in this ageing population we observed marked changes in blood lipids over a 12 year follow up, with decreasing trajectories of TC, LDL-C and non-HDL-C and mixed trajectories of TG. The findings suggest that monitoring of age-related trajectories in blood lipids may improve prediction of CVD risk beyond single measurements."

The primary outcome was to evaluate the changes over time before and after surgery, analyzing the Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA), Ganglion Cell Complex (GCC), Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) thicknesses, the retinal vessel density (VD) of Superficial Capillary Plexus (SCP), Deep Capillary Plexus (DCP), Radial Peripapillary Capillary (RPC) and the Foveal Avascular Zone (FAZ). The secondary outcome was to identify potential biomarkers that could predict visual acuity changes after 1-year follow-up.When comparing SD-OCT and OCTA measurements obtained after 1 year with those observed 48 hours after surgery, GCC and RNFL were significantly improved. After a significant reduction at 48 hours, GCC thickness showed a significant increase at 1 year after surgery (p = 0.007), while a significant restoration of RNFL thickness was found at 1 year (p = 0.005), as well as the VD of SCP, DCP, and RPC values. FAZ area did not change over time. BCVA significantly improved at each time after surgery (p = 0.037, p = 0.013). A statistically significant correlation was found between the preoperative BCVA, VD of SCP, DCP, RPC, and the postoperative BCVA at 1 year (p = 0.017, p = 0.029, p = 0.031, p = 0.023).SD-OCT and OCTA provide helpful information to identify the retinal structural and vascular improvements 1 year after surgery. OCTA parameters could serve as potential predictive markers for visual acuity recovery at long-term follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W3216309349,"The effective utilization of a communication channel like calling a person involves two steps. The first step is storing the contact information of another user, and the second step is finding contact information to initiate a voice or text communication. However, the current smartphone interfaces for contact management are mainly textual; which leaves many emergent users at a severe disadvantage in using this most basic functionality to the fullest. Previous studies indicated that less-educated users adopt various coping strategies to store and identify contacts. However, all of these studies investigated the contact management issues of these users from a qualitative angle. Although qualitative or subjective investigations are very useful, they generally need to be augmented by a quantitative investigation for a comprehensive problem understanding. This work presents an exploratory study to identify the usability issues and coping strategies in contact management by emergent users; by using a mixture of qualitative and quantitative approaches. We identified coping strategies of the Pakistani population and the effectiveness of these strategies through a semi-structured qualitative study of 15 participants and a usability study of 9 participants, respectively. We then obtained logged data of 30 emergent and 30 traditional users, including contact-books and dual-channel (call and text messages) logs to infer a more detailed understanding; and to analyse the differences in the composition of contact-books of both user groups. The analysis of the log data confirmed problems that affect the emergent users' communication behaviour due to the various difficulties they face in storing and searching contacts. Our findings revealed serious usability issues in current communication interfaces over smartphones. The emergent users were found to have smaller contact-books and preferred voice communication due to reading/writing difficulties. They also reported taking help from others for contact saving and text reading. The alternative contact management strategies adopted by our participants include: memorizing whole number or last few digits to recall important contacts; adding special character sequence with contact numbers for better recall; writing a contact from scratch rather than searching it in the phone-book; voice search; and use of recent call logs to redial a contact. The identified coping strategies of emergent users could aid the developers and designers to come up with solutions according to emergent users' mental models and needs."

However, from 1990 onwards, a set of policies followed by the various states in the region acheived economic stabilization with real income recovery. The attribution of this success has been disputed by politicians, economists and officials from international economic support institutions. This work will analyze the responsibility for this success in 4 economies in the region (Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru). Through the combined analysis of ARDL, Markov states and structural breaks, we highlight different sources of responsibility in different periods. Additionally, detailing the states of each regime, we verify the duration of the regimes related to inflation rates and to interest rates in the region. We identify specific governments as associated with moments of economic stabilization in the region, so the hypothesis of the political cycle cannot be rejected for the set of results achieved. As policy implication, we claim that Taylor rules are endogenous to Political Budget Cycles and so stabilization plans are restricted to political tenures."
https://openalex.org/W3217036367,"Introduction Open Doors, an HIV prevention project targeting key populations in Zambia, recorded low HIV positivity rates (9%) among HIV testing clients, compared to national adult prevalence (12.3%), suggesting case finding efficiency could be improved. To close this gap, they undertook a series of targeted programmatic and management interventions. We share the outcomes of these interventions, specifically changes in testing volume, HIV positivity rate, and total numbers of key populations living with HIV identified. Methods The project implemented a range of interventions to improve HIV case finding using a Total Quality Leadership and Accountability (TQLA) approach. We analyzed program data for key populations who received HIV testing six months before the interventions (October 2017–March 2018) and 12 months after (April 2018–March 2019). Interrupted time series analysis was used to evaluate the impact on HIV positivity and total case finding and trends in positivity and case finding over time, before and after the interventions. Results While the monthly average number of HIV tests performed increased by only 14% post-intervention, the monthly average number of HIV positive individuals identified increased by 290%. The average HIV positivity rate rose from 9.7% to 32.4%. Positivity rates and case finding remained significantly higher in all post-intervention months. Similar trends were observed among FSW and MSM. Conclusions The Open Doors project was able to reach large numbers of previously undiagnosed key populations by implementing a targeted managerial and technical intervention, resulting in a significant increase in the HIV positivity rate sustained over 12 months. These results demonstrate that differentiated, data-driven approaches can help close the 95-95-95 gaps among key populations."

https://openalex.org/W3214830166,"Nest parasitism is a common reproductive strategy used by many species of cavity nesting birds. Among these, the wood duck (Aix sponsa) is known to have evolved very specific strategies of when and whom to parasitize that is often based on population and/or environmental queues. Here, we investigated the genetic relationship of two female wood ducks competing over an artificial nesting box in Delaware, including the continued incubation of one female despite the death and body remains of the other female throughout the incubation process. We test whether such an extreme case of nest parasitism can be explained by relatedness, egg lineage composition, or a combination of other factors. To do so, we extracted genomic DNA from blood and tissue of the females, as well as chorioallantoic membranes of all viable and inviable eggs. Subsequently, we assessed relatedness among females and eggs based on hundreds of nuclear loci and the mitochondrial control region. We concluded that (1) the two incubating females were entirely unrelated, (2) the single clutch is in fact represented by a minimum of four unrelated females, and (3) a single female can lay eggs sired by different males. The latter finding is the first direct evidence for successful extra-pair copulation in wood ducks. With decreasing costs and increasing effectiveness, genomic methods have the potential to provide important insights into more complex ecological and evolutionary tactics of such populations."

Several equations have been used to estimate 24h urine sodium excretion, however, a validated formula for calculating 24h urine sodium excretion from 12h urine collection has not yet been established. This study aims to develop novel equations for estimating 24h urine sodium excretion from 12h and random spot urine collection and also to validate existing spot urine equations in the Thai population. A cross-sectional survey was carried out among 209 adult hospital personnel. Participants were asked to perform a 12h daytime, 12h nighttime, and a random spot urine collection over a period of 24 hours. The mean 24h urine sodium excretion was 4,055±1,712 mg/day. Estimated urine sodium excretion from 3 different equations using random spot urine collection showed moderate correlation and agreement with actual 24h urine sodium excretion (r = 0.54, P<0.001, ICC = 0.53 for Kawasaki; r = 0.57, P<0.001, ICC = 0.44 for Tanaka; r = 0.60, P<0.001, ICC = 0.45 for INTERSALT). Novel equations for predicting 24h urine sodium excretion were then developed using variables derived from 12h daytime urine collection, 12h nighttime urine collection, random spot urine collection, 12h daytime with random spot urine collection, and 12h nighttime with random spot urine collection which showed strong correlation and agreement with actual measured values (r = 0.88, P<0.001, ICC = 0.87; r = 0.83, P<0.001, ICC = 0.81; r = 0.67, P<0.001, ICC = 0.62; r = 0.90, P<0.001, ICC = 0.90; and r = 0.83, p<0.001, ICC = 0.82 respectively). Bland-Altman plots indicated good agreement between predicted values and actual 24h urine sodium excretion using the new equations. Newly derived equations from 12h daytime and 12h nighttime urine collection with or without casual spot urine collection were able to accurately predict 24h urine sodium excretion."

Research suggests that current methods of storing medication on hospital wards are not fit for purpose, contributing to inefficiency and error.To improve medication storage in inpatient areas, by exploring variation and challenges related to medication storage and designing a prototype solution.Set in four hospitals in an English teaching hospital trust, the study used a mixed methods approach comprising a quantitative descriptive survey of storage facilities and practices followed by mixed methods observations of medication rounds and interviews with patients, nurses and pharmacy staff. Quantitative data were presented descriptively and qualitative data analysed thematically and using a human-centered design approach.We identified wide variation in medication storage facilities and practices across 77 wards. Observations and staff interviews in six wards revealed five problem areas: poor management of multiple storage facilities; lack of visibility and organisation of medication within trolleys; inadequate size of storage; lack of ownership and knowledge of standard practice; and use of key locks. Patients were largely satisfied with receiving their medication. Systematic and consistent physical organisation of medication in medication trolleys, and integrating and implementing principles of best practice, were identified as areas for intervention.Variation in medication storage facilities and practices existed both across the organization and on individual wards. Multiple challenges were identified in how medication was stored, which if addressed may improve the efficiency and safety of medication administration and in turn, staff and patient experience. The use of design principles alongside a research approach resulted in a rapid, iterative process for developing and refining potential solutions to improve inpatient medication storage."

Multivariable logistic regression models assessed associations between homophobic victimization (independent variable) and alcohol-related outcomes (dependent variables), controlling for age, parents' education level, sexual orientation, health literacy, race, and ethnicity.Most participants (87%) reported at least one form of homophobic victimization in their lifetime, with verbal insults being the most frequently reported (82%). In the bivariate analysis, alcohol consumption and riding with an intoxicated driver or driving a car while under the influence were associated with many forms of victimization. Exposure to at least one form of victimization was associated with increased odds of alcohol consumption (OR: 2.31; 95% CI: 1.38-3.87) and riding with an intoxicated driver or driving a car while under the influence (OR: 2.25; 95% CI: 1.26-4.00), after controlling for covariates.Increased risk of alcohol consumption and risky alcohol-related behaviors were found among adolescent MSM who experienced homophobic victimization. Interventions should address homophobic victimization and its impact on adolescent MSM, as well as disentangling motivations for underage drinking, riding with an intoxicated driver or driving a car while under the influence."
https://openalex.org/W3217792055,"Frequent earthquakes in strong earthquake areas pose a great threat to the safety operation of electric power facilities. There exists a pressing research need to develop an assessment method for the seismic risk of substations, i.e., the hubs of power system networks. In this study, based on Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA), Probabilistic Seismic Demand Model (PSDM) and reliability theory, a vulnerability model for a substation is obtained, based on considering the relationships between Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) and four seismic damage states (complete, extensive, moderate, and slight.) via a probabilistic approach. After an earthquake, the scope of influence and PGA distribution are evaluated using information recorded by the seismic observation stations, based on using interpolation or an empirical formula for the PGA attenuation. Therefore, the seismic risk can be evaluated by combining ground motion evaluation and the pre-built vulnerability model. The Wuqia- Kashgar area of Xinjiang was selected as the study area; it is an Earthquake-prone area, and one of the starting points for new energy transmission projects in China. Under a hypothetical earthquake (MS 7.9), the seismic risk of the substations was evaluated. The results show that: this method is able to give the probabilities of the four damage states of the substations, four substations close to the epicenter only have a probability of slight damage (45%-88%) and other substations are safer."
