https://openalex.org/W2050601632,"The bipotential progenitor cells (O-2A progenitors) that produce oligodendrocytes and type-2 astrocytes in the developing rat optic nerve are induced to proliferate in culture by type-1 astrocytes. Here, we show that the astrocyte-derived mitogen is platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). PDGF is a potent mitogen for O-2A progenitor cells in vitro. Mitogenic activity in astrocyte-conditioned medium comigrates with PDGF on a size-exclusion column, competes with PDGF for receptors, and is neutralized by antibodies to PDGF. PDGF dimers can be immunoprecipitated from astrocyte-conditioned medium, and mRNA encoding PDGF is present in rat brain throughout gliogenesis. We propose that astrocyte-derived PDGF is crucial for the control of myelination in the developing central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2080910520,"A cytoplasmic protein that greatly enhances the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity of N-ras protein but does not affect the activity of oncogenic ras mutants has been recently described. This protein (GAP) is shown here to be ubiquitous in higher eukaryotes and to interact with H-ras as well as with N-ras proteins. To identify the region of ras p21 with which GAP interacts, 21 H-ras mutant proteins were purified and tested for their ability to undergo stimulation of GTPase activity by GAP. Mutations in nonessential regions of H-ras p21 as well as mutations in its carboxyl-terminal domain (residues 165-185) and purine binding region (residues 117 and 119) did not decrease the ability of the protein to respond to GAP. In addition, an antibody against the carboxyl-terminal domain did not block GAP activity, supporting the conclusion that GAP does not interact with this region. Transforming mutations at positions 12, 59, and 61 (the phosphoryl binding region) abolished GTPase stimulation by GAP. Point mutations in the putative effector region of ras p21 (amino acids 35, 36, and 38) were also insensitive to GAP. However, a point mutation at position 39, shown previously not to impair effector function, did not alter GAP-p21 interaction. These results indicate that GAP interaction may be essential for ras p21 biological activity and that it may be a ras effector protein."

https://openalex.org/W2144739237,"Hydropathy profiles of 34 aligned cytochrome P-450 sequences were compared to identify potential transmembrane segments. Eleven regions with the potential to cross a membrane in at least some P-450 sequences were detected. The known sidedness of several residues and peptides was used to eliminate some of these regions from consideration. Further arguments based on the location and orientation of the heme relative to the membrane excluded others. This process of elimination was continued until only two regions remained. These two segments, present in the first 66 amino acids of the P-450 NH2 termini, are proposed as the only transmembrane peptides of vertebrate microsomal P-450s. Mitochondrial P-450s may have a different membrane association. The three-dimensional structure of cytochrome P-450cam was examined for the location of conserved charged residues. These residues occurred mainly on the opposite surface from the substrate-binding site and along the edges of the flat triangular P-450cam. A model is proposed for vertebrate microsomal P-450s that is similar to P-450cam. The substrate-binding site faces the membrane, the heme is parallel to the membrane surface, and two NH2-terminal transmembrane segments anchor the protein to the bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W2094729609,"Evidence is presented that the E. coli secB gene encodes a soluble protein that interacts with the mature region of the precursor maltose-binding protein (MBP), and promotes MBP export by preventing premature folding of the newly synthesized polypeptide into an export-incompetent form. The interaction of SecB with MBP was indicated by the finding that synthesis of various export-defective MBP species interfered with normal protein export by limiting SecB availability. The antifolding activity of SecB was demonstrated by the following: the defect in MBP export in SecB- cells was suppressed by mutational alterations affecting MBP folding; export of a mutant MBP that is accomplished in a strictly posttranslational mode was totally blocked in SecB- cells; and the rate of folding of wild-type MBP synthesized in vitro was found to be accelerated when SecB was absent and greatly retarded when excess SecB was present."

https://openalex.org/W1595497744,"Rat brain neuropeptide Y precursor (prepro-NPY) cDNA clones were isolated and sequenced in order to study regulation of the prepro-NPY gene. Rat prepro-NPY (98 amino acid residues) contains a 36-residue NPY sequence, followed by a proteolysis/amidation site Gly-Lys-Arg, followed by a 30-residue COOH-terminal sequence. The strong evolutionary conservation of rat and human sequences of NPY (100%) and COOH-terminal peptide (93%) suggests that both peptides have important biological functions. In the rat central nervous system, prepro-NPY mRNA (800 bases) is most abundant in the striatum and cortex and moderately abundant in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and spinal cord. The rat adrenal, spleen, heart, and lung have significant levels of prepro-NPY mRNA. Regulation of the prepro-NPY mRNA abundance was studied in several rodent neural cell lines. PC12 rat pheochromocytoma and N18TG-2 mouse neuroblastoma cells possess low basal levels of prepro-NPY mRNA, while NG108-15 hybrid cells possess high levels. Treatment of PC12 cells with a glucocorticoid such as dexamethasone or elevation of cAMP by forskolin increased the prepro-NPY mRNA level 2-3-fold or 3-10-fold, respectively. In N18TG-2 cells dexamethasone and forskolin synergistically increased prepro-NPY mRNA 7-fold. Treatment of PC12 cells with the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate alone elevated prepro-NPY mRNA marginally, but the phorbol ester plus forskolin elicited 20-70-fold increases, which were further enhanced to over 200-fold by dexamethasone and the calcium ionophore A23187. These results indicate that NPY gene expression can be positively regulated by synergistic actions of glucocorticoids, cAMP elevation, and protein kinase C activation."
https://openalex.org/W2115919802,"Treatment of murine B cells with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence or absence of different lymphokines results in cell populations that differentially express particular immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region (CH) genes. This class switch involves recombination between switch regions located upstream of the germ-line CH genes. We have treated Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed pre-B cells and normal splenic B cells with LPS or LPS plus the lymphokine IL-4 and examined the effect on the germ-line gamma 2b locus and gamma 2b class switching. In both cell types, LPS induces transcription specifically through the germ-line gamma 2b locus before gamma 2b class switching. Furthermore, IL-4 inhibits LPS induction of germ-line gamma 2b transcripts in spleen cells and correspondingly abrogates switching to this CH gene. Thus treatment with mitogens and lymphokines can alter transcription of germ-line CH genes in B lineage cells and thereby directly regulate class switching in the context of a recombinase accessibility mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2050797066,"We have used the Xenopus oocyte injection system to investigate the sequence requirements of premature termination of transcription within the human c-myc gene. We show that in the oocyte, truncated RNAs are produced by RNA polymerase II with 5' ends at the P1 and P2 promoters and 3' ends at two T stretches (sites I and II) near the exon 1/intron 1 junction. The location of these 3' ends is consistent with the site of the block to c-myc transcription identified by nuclear runoff assays in human cells and confirmed in dissected nuclei of injected oocytes. Evidence is presented that transcriptional termination rather than RNA processing produces these short c-myc RNAs. Deletion analysis of site I reveals that sequences upstream of the T stretch determine the site of 3' end formation, and that the stretch of T's on the sense DNA strand is not required for termination. The sequences specifying termination reside within a 95 base region located -130 to -35 relative to the exon 1/intron 1 boundary. The termination activity of these sequences is orientation-dependent and functions downstream of the HSV-TK promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2090119499,"The consensus recognition element for the mammalian transcription factor AP-1 is very similar to that of the transcriptional activator GCN4. Here, we show that the AP-1 recognition element (ARE) found in the SV40 enhancer can activate transcription from a heterologous promoter in S. cerevisiae. This activation, however, is not dependent on the presence of GCN4 as evidenced by ARE-dependent transcription in a gcn4 yeast strain. A previously unknown yeast transcription factor that is probably responsible for this activation was identified and highly purified. The yeast factor, designated yAP-1, shares remarkably similar biochemical and DNA-binding characteristics with mammalian AP-1. These data suggest that the yeast and mammalian AP-1 are evolutionarily conserved and perhaps functionally related. Also note-worthy is that GCN4 can bind to a GCN4 recognition element (GCRE) and to the ARE with approximately equal affinities; yAP-1, however, has a much lower affinity for the GCRE than the ARE, suggesting that yAP-1 can discriminate between these elements in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2101755633,"Cysteine residues introduced at specific locations in the aspartate receptor of Salmonella typhimurium provide anchor points for cross-linking and serve as chemical markers for structural studies of this oligomeric receptor. These markers have been used to measure the rate of subunit exchange between oligomeric receptors and to show that ligand binding inhibits this exchange. The cysteine-containing receptors can be oxidatively cross-linked to completion within the oligomeric receptor, indicating that the receptor has an even number of subunits. Based on this observation, a technique has been developed that can be used to determine the oligomeric structure of proteins under a variety of experimental conditions. The technique involves the measurement of the effect of dilution by cysteineless receptor subunits on cross-linking and reveals that the aspartate receptor is dimeric in detergent solution, in a mixed-micelle system, and in reconstituted membrane vesicles. Binding of aspartate does not change the oligomeric structure of the receptor, indicating that transmembrane signaling occurs within an oligomeric receptor of constant size."
https://openalex.org/W2069075989,"We have developed a soluble, cell-free system from premeiotic Xenopus oocytes that executes the post-translational activation of a precursor form of maturation promoting factor (MPF). We have distinguished at least two components of this ATP-dependent reaction: pre-MPF, a precursor to MPF that activates independently of added MPF and whose apparent molecular weight changes from 400 kd to 260 kd upon activation; and INH, an inhibitor of pre-MPF activation that confers MPF dependence on the reaction. We present evidence suggesting that INH is a phosphatase and that the activation of pre-MPF occurs via phosphorylation. INH activity itself seems to be regulated by another phosphatase, protein phosphatase-1. We have directly examined the pattern of protein phosphorylation during the activation reaction and have found 92 and 140 kd proteins whose phosphorylation increases when MPF activity appears. This system makes possible a direct examination of the regulation of MPF activity during the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1549955084,"The copper enzyme galactose oxidase has been prepared in three distinct redox modifications; two of these represent nearly homogeneous preparations of active and inactive species which have been described previously, while the third has never before been reported. Preparation of these redox modifications as homogeneous species has permitted detailed spectroscopic and catalytic studies of each for the first time. We find that the form which has been extensively probed by EPR spectroscopy is devoid of catalytic activity and does not interact with substrate. The detailed characterization of oxidatively activated galactose oxidase and its anion interactions has led to a spectroscopic assignment of the copper oxidation state in this complex which indicates that the one-electron redox process which converts the inactive form to catalytically active enzyme is associated with oxidation of the protein rather than the metal center as has been proposed previously. This oxidation step is required for catalytic activity and is the basis of the two-electron redox reactivity for the enzyme active site: anaerobic addition of hydroxylic substrates results in reduction of the two-electron redox unit, and the spectral features associated with both the copper ion and the non-metal redox center are eliminated, apparently forming a cuprous site. The two-electron reactivity resulting from protein participation in redox catalysis has important implications in this and other mechanisms where oxygen reduction occurs at a mononuclear metal ion active site."

https://openalex.org/W1673058723,"Desmin, the myogenic intermediate filament protein, is a phosphoprotein containing phosphoserine, in vivo. The role of phosphorylation on assembly-disassembly and organization of the desmin filament has remained obscure. We report here on a stable and purified system which enables a biochemical examination of desmin filament assembly and disassembly. Using this in vitro system, we carried out stoichiometrical phosphorylations by purified protein kinases. The extent of polymerization-depolymerization was estimated using procedures related to centrifugation and electron microscopy. The evidence we obtained suggests that disassembly of the desmin filament and inhibition of the NaCl-dependent polymerization of the soluble desmin can reversibly occur with either cAMP-dependent or Ca2+-activated, phospholipid-dependent desmin phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1483015270,"We have studied a patient with severe, dominantly inherited Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV. The results indicate that this patient carries a deletion of 3.3 kilo-base pairs in the triple helical coding domain of one of the two alleles for the pro-alpha-chains of type III collagen (COL3A1). His cultured skin fibroblasts contain equal amounts of normal length mRNA and of mRNA shortened by approximately 600 bases, and synthesize both normal and shortened pro-alpha 1(III)-chains. In procollagen molecules containing one or more shortened chains, a triple helix is formed with a length of only about 780 amino acids. The mutant procollagen molecules have decreased thermal stability, are less efficiently secreted, and are not processed as their normal counterpart. The deletion in this family is the first mutation to be described in COL3A1."
https://openalex.org/W1490866322,"Binding between the microtubule-associated tau protein and S100b protein was demonstrated by affinity chromatography and cross-linking experiments and was manifested in the effect of S100b on tau protein phosphorylation by protein kinase II. All three expressions of the binding showed that S100b discriminates among the four species of tau, revealing for the first time that the different kinds of tau may differ functionally. Noncovalent interaction between tau and S100b depended on the presence of Ca2+ or Zn2+ and resulted in total inhibition of tau phosphorylation by protein kinase II. In the absence of reducing agent, covalent binding studies between Cys84 beta in the carboxyl-terminal region of the S100b-beta subunit and tau proteins confirmed interactions between the two proteins. It is suggested that the homologous calcium-binding domain that characterizes the carboxyl terminus of S100 and the tubulin subunit may be responsible for the common interaction of both proteins with tau proteins. The physicochemical relationship between S100 subunits and p11, the subunit of a substrate for tyrosine kinase, and their similarity in interaction with protein kinase substrates are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1582104428,"A novel ganglioside, de-N-acetyl-GM3 (neuraminyllactosylceramide, II3NeuNH2LacCer), was found in the monosialoganglioside fraction of A431 cells and B16 melanoma cells by high-performance liquid chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, and immunoblotting with its specific monoclonal antibody DH5. This novel type of membrane ganglioside strongly enhanced the kinase activity associated with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, and it showed 32, 35, and 12% growth stimulation as compared with control cultures of A431, Swiss 3T3, and B16 melanoma cells, respectively. Exogenously added de-N-acetyl-GM3 did not alter the affinity of EGF binding to its receptor. These properties of de-N-acetyl-GM3 are in striking contrast to those of GM3 and its lyso derivative (lyso-GM3) which were previously shown to inhibit EGF receptor kinase activity and to inhibit growth in the same cells. These data indicate that de-N-acetylation at the sialic acid moiety of GM3 ganglioside is an important mechanism for modulation of EGF-dependent cell growth. The mechanism is antagonistic to that of GM3-dependent modulation of receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W1594305617,"In this report we have extended our studies on a panel of vesicular stomatitis virus G proteins with altered glycosylation sites. These mutant proteins were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the coding sequence to create new consensus sites for asparagine-linked oligosaccharide addition. We report that the intracellular transport of most of the mutant proteins is temperature-sensitive, implying a polypeptide folding step is affected. In addition, we find that the nonglycosylated G protein and those mutant proteins which lack oligosaccharides at the normal positions are subject to aberrant intermolecular disulfide bonding, leading to the accumulation of large complexes in the endoplasmic reticulum. These results imply that carbohydrate plays an indirect role in the intracellular transport of G protein."

https://openalex.org/W1902603788,"Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) at 1 nM inhibits arginine-vasopressin (AVP)-induced water reabsorption in the rabbit cortical collecting tubule (RCCT), while 100 nM PGE1, by itself, stimulates water reabsorption (Grantham, J. J., and Orloff, J. (1968) J. Clin. Invest. 47, 1154-1161). To investigate the basis for these two responses, we measured the effects of prostaglandins on cAMP metabolism in purified RCCT cells. In freshly isolated cells, PGE2, PGE1, and 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2 acting at high concentrations (0.1-10 microM) stimulated cAMP accumulation; however, one PGE2 analog, sulprostone (16-phenoxy-17,18,19,20-tetranor-PGE2 methylsulfonilamide), failed to stimulate cAMP accumulation or to antagonize PGE2-induced cAMP formation; PGD2, PGF2 alpha, and a PGI2 analog, carbacyclin (6-carbaprostaglandin I2), also failed to stimulate cAMP synthesis. These results suggest that there is a PGE-specific stimulatory receptor in RCCT cells which mediates activation of adenylate cyclase. Occupancy of this receptor would be anticipated to cause water reabsorption by the collecting tubule. At lower concentrations (0.1-100 nM) PGE2, PGE1, 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2, and, in addition, sulprostone inhibited AVP-induced cAMP accumulation by fresh RCCT cells in the presence of cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Pertussis toxin pretreatment of RCCT cells blocked the ability of both PGE2 and sulprostone to inhibit AVP-induced cAMP accumulation. In membranes prepared from RCCT cells, sulprostone prevented stimulation of adenylate cyclase by AVP. These results suggest that E-series prostaglandins (including sulprostone) can act through an inhibitory PGE receptor(s) coupled to the inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein, Gi, to block AVP-induced cAMP synthesis by RCCT cells. Occupancy of this receptor would be expected to cause inhibition of AVP-induced water reabsorption in the intact tubule. Curiously, after RCCT cells were cultured for 5-7 days, PGE2 no longer inhibited AVP-induced cAMP accumulation, but PGE2 by itself could still stimulate cAMP accumulation. In contrast to PGE2, epinephrine acting via an alpha 2-adrenergic, Gi-linked mechanism did block AVP-induced cAMP formation by cultured RCCT cells. This implies that some component of the inhibitory PGE response other than Gi is lost when RCCT cells are cultured."
https://openalex.org/W1611764007,"A Klebsiella ozaenae nitrilase which converts the herbicide bromoxynil (3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile) to 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzoic acid has been expressed at 5-10% of the total protein in Escherichia coli from a cloned K. ozaenae DNA segment and purified 10.3-fold to homogeneity. The purified polypeptide is molecular weight 37,000 in size, but the active form of the enzyme is composed of two identical subunits. The purified enzyme exhibits a pH optimum of 9.2 and a temperature optimum of 35 degrees C. The purified enzyme is also quite sensitive to thiol-specific reagents. The nitrilase is highly specific for bromoxynil as substrate with a Km of 0.31 mM and Vmax of 15 mumol of NH3 released/min/mg protein. Analysis of bromoxynil-related substrates indicates the enzyme exhibits preference for compounds containing two meta-positioned halogen atoms. Nucleotide sequence analysis of a 1,212-base pair PstI-HincII DNA segment containing the locus (bxn) encoding the bromoxynil-specific nitrilase reveals a single open reading frame encoding a polypeptide 349 amino acids in length. The predicted sequence of the purified enzyme was derived from the nucleotide sequence of the bxn gene."
https://openalex.org/W1563225650,"To determine the location of sites that may be important for the function of the promoter of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor gene and to characterize the factors that bind to these sites, the promoter region was analyzed by deletion analysis, exonuclease III protection and gel retardation assays with crude and fractionated nuclear extracts and DNase I footprinting using purified Sp1. Transfection of chimeric chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmids containing various deletions of the EGF receptor gene promoter into CV-1 cells indicated that the region between -178 and -16 (initiator ATG is +1) is sufficient for promoter activity. Exonuclease III protection assays revealed the presence of eight specific nuclear protein binding sites in the region between -481 and -16. Gel retardation assays confirmed that multiple protein binding sites exist in this region (-481 to -16) and quantitatively agree with exonuclease III protection. DNase I footprinting using purified Sp1 showed that this transcription factor can bind to four sites (-457 to -440, -365 to -286, -214 to -200, and -110 to -84) in the EGF receptor gene promoter and therefore may play a role in its regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1602657018,"We have isolated a fragment (approximately equal to 10 kDa) of thrombomodulin containing the fifth and sixth epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like regions which retains thrombin binding capacity. The amino-terminal sequence of a 50-kDa active fragment of thrombomodulin derived from elastase proteolysis begins 11 residues before the first EGF-like structure of native thrombomodulin. Subsequent digestion with cyanogen bromide yields a 10-kDa thrombin binding fragment. The amino-terminal sequence of this fragment starts at the fifth EGF-like structure (Phe407). The amino acid composition suggests that this fragment contains the fifth and sixth EGF-like structures with a total of approximately 77 residues. This fragment lacks cofactor activity, but acts as a competitive inhibitor for protein C activation (Ki = 8.6 +/- 1.4 nM). We propose that the fifth and sixth EGF-like structures contain the thrombin binding site of thrombomodulin."
https://openalex.org/W2013123775,"Chemists and biologists are focusing considerable effort on the development of efficient, highly selective catalysts for the synthesis or modification of complex molecules. Two approaches are described here, the generation of catalytic antibodies and hybrid enzymes, which exploit the binding and catalytic machinery of nature in catalyst design. Characterization of these systems is providing additional insight into the mechanisms of molecular recognition and catalysis which may, in turn, lead to the design of tailor-made catalysts for applications in chemistry, biology, and medicine."
https://openalex.org/W1533669901,"The inositol phospholipids phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) comprise 14.8, 1.2, and 0.3 mol %, respectively, of Dunaliella salina phospholipids. In isolated plasma membrane fractions, PIP and PIP2 are highly concentrated, together comprising 9.5 mol % of plasmalemma phospholipids. The metabolism of these inositol phospholipids and phosphatidic acid (PA) is very rapid under normal growth conditions. Within 5 min after introduction of 32Pi into the growth medium, over 75% of lipid-bound label was found in these quantitatively minor phospholipids. Within 2 min after a sudden hypoosmotic shock, the levels of PIP2 and PIP dropped to 65 and 79%, respectively, of controls. Within the same time frame, PA rose to 141% of control values. These data suggest that a rapid breakdown of the polyphosphoinositides may mediate the profound morphological and physiological changes which allow this organism to survive drastic hypoosmotic stress. In contrast to hypoosmotic shock, hyperosmotic shock induced a rise in PIP2 levels to 131% of control values, whereas the level of PA dropped to 56% of controls after 4 min. These two different types of osmotic stress affect inositol phospholipid metabolism in a fundamentally opposite manner, with only hypoosmotic shock inducing a net decrease in polyphosphoinositides."
https://openalex.org/W1611720251,"In this report, we have asked whether asparagine-linked oligosaccharides added to new sites in the polypeptide backbone of a model plasma membrane glycoprotein, the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein, can promote its intracellular transport. We modified the coding sequence of G protein lacking the two normal consensus sites for glycosylation by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to create new consensus sites. The expression of the mutant proteins was then analyzed in transfected cells. Six of the eight new sites which were introduced were glycosylated, and an oligosaccharide at two of these new sites promoted transport of G protein which lacked the two normal sites. However, the efficiency of this process was reduced compared to the wild-type protein or to the proteins with only one oligosaccharide at either of the normal sites. In addition, an oligosaccharide at two of the other new sites caused inhibition of transport of the wild-type G protein. The data in this and the following report suggest that carbohydrate plays an indirect role in the intracellular transport of G protein."
https://openalex.org/W1554571195,"The appearance of the mRNA for the adult fast IIB myosin heavy chain (MHC) was examined during postnatal development of rats using an S1 nuclease assay. In normal rats, a large increase in the adult MHC mRNA began at 6-7 days after birth, whereas daily injections of newborn rats with 3 micrograms of triiodothyronine (T3) resulted in a precocious increase of the mRNA as early as 3 days after birth. Injection of a range of doses of T3 demonstrated that a large effect was obtained between 30 and 300 ng of T3/day/rat. Fast myosin protein was also precociously induced over the same range of T3 doses. This effect was also seen in denervated muscles, and muscles responded similarly to the different doses of T3 whether they were denervated or not. These results suggest that either thyroid hormone or some circulating factors induced by thyroid hormone are limiting factors in controlling the neonatal-to-adult fast MHC transition and that these factors may act directly on muscle tissue."

https://openalex.org/W1545502776,"Mouse genes for two isozymes of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (C alpha, C beta) were isolated and characterized. The C alpha gene is divided into 10 exons contained on three overlapping clones. Genomic clones containing the 5' end of the C beta gene were also isolated, and sequence analysis demonstrated that the positions of the three introns examined are identical in the C alpha and C beta genes. S1 mapping and primer extension experiments indicate that transcription initiated from multiple sites in both genes and that neither contain recognizable TATA or CAAT homologies. The 5' flanking regions of both genes are remarkably high in GC content (80% for C alpha and 72% for C beta) and are similar to the HTF (HpaII tiny fragment fraction) island sequences which have recently been found to flank several other mammalian transcriptional units."
https://openalex.org/W1533845093,"Transcription termination in vitro by vaccinia RNA polymerase is dependent on a trans-acting factor, VTF, that is associated with, if not identical to, the vaccinia mRNA capping enzyme. VTF-induced termination occurs approximately 50 nucleotides downstream of a signal sequence TTTTTNT in the non-transcribed templated strand; thus the cognate sequence UUUUUNU is expressed in the nascent RNA. To address the role of the nascent RNA in chain termination, the effects of nucleotide base analog substitutions were studied. Incorporation of bromo- (Br) UMP or iodo- (I) UMP into RNA abrogated factor-dependent termination without preventing the synthesis of read-through transcripts. Substitution of either ITP or 7'-methylguanosine for GTP did not inhibit factor-dependent termination, nor did the substitution of BrCTP or ICTP for CTP. The early transcripts synthesized in vitro were sensitive to RNase T2 but resistant to RNase H, indicating an absence of extensive hybridization of RNA product to the DNA template. Substitution of BrUTP for UTP did not alter the nuclease sensitivity of the transcripts, suggesting that increased stability of RNA:DNA hybrid structures did not account for the analog effects. These results are consistent with a model in which recognition of the primary sequence UUUUUNU in nascent RNA by the polymerase and/or VTF is required for transcription termination."
https://openalex.org/W1650643230,"Amphibian skin is well known as a source of peptides homologous to bioactive peptides found in mammalian gut and brain.

These have been independently characterized and named magainins and found to have antimicrobial activity. A mixed sequence oligonucleotide probe complementary to the mRNA sequence coding for PGS was synthesized and used to screen a Xenopus skin cDNA library. A full length cDNA species encoding prepro-PGS was isolated and characterized, and its sequence is reported. The deduced precursor sequence was found to contain one copy of PGS Gly-10;Lys-22 and five copies of PGS. The proteolytic processing of this prepro-polypeptide is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2156088947,"Upon neutrophils release reactive oxygen intermediates such as superoxide anion (O2-) which are potent mediators of inflammation. Various agents elicit different responses; N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (fMLP) (0.1 microM) provokes brisk generation of superoxide anion; leukotriene B4 (LTB4, 0.1 microM) is a poor stimulus. In contrast, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 1.6 microM) acting directly via protein kinase C is a potent stimulus for O2-. We compared the kinetics of appearance of various second messengers with the capacity of these ligands to elicit O2- generation. Kinetic analysis showed a two-phase response to membrane ligands; both an (less than or equal to 15 s) and a (greater than 15 s) increase in [3H]- and [14C]diacylglycerol (DG) was noted in response to fMLP. In contrast, LTB4 elicited only a rapid early increase in DG. The rise in DG evoked by PMA was late. Cytochalasin B increased the late phase of DG labeling elicited by all agonists. Moreover, comparison of increases in [3H]DG versus those of [14C]DG at early and late time points suggested that DG was not formed exclusively from the hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides. Early increments of DG were also accompanied by addition of plasma membrane (ultrastructural morphometry); the ratio of surface perimeter to area increased rapidly (10 s) and persisted (60 s) in response to fMLP. Increments were more gradual in response to PMA. Kinetic analysis of protein phosphorylation was compared to the early and late increments of DG labeling. A 47,000 Mr protein was phosphorylated with kinetics consistent with the production of O2- and DG in response to fMLP (early and late) and PMA (late). In contrast, LTB4 provoked only early phosphorylation of this protein. The temporal pattern of the formation of diacylglycerol and the phosphorylation of proteins describe a dual signal. The data suggest that neutrophils require not only triggering (the rapid generation of a signal) but also activation (the maintenance of a signal) to sustain responses."
https://openalex.org/W1498500908,"Autophosphorylation of the type II calmodulin-dependent protein kinase is known to remove the dependence of this enzyme on Ca2+ and calmodulin. The enzymatic activity in the presence of Ca2+, on the other hand, was reported to be unaffected or decreased by this interconversion. The role of autophosphorylation in the kinase reaction was reinvestigated using short assay times and low ATP concentrations to decrease the extent and rate of this process. Under these conditions, the ATP dependence of the kinase reaction with syntide-2 as the substrate (but not the autophosphorylation reaction) exhibited kinetic cooperativity due to a lag in the progress curve of syntide-2 conversion. Partial autophosphorylation of the protein kinase prior to phosphorylation of the peptide substrate completely abolished this hysteretic response without affecting the final rate of substrate conversion. These observations suggest that autophosphorylation is an obligatory step in the response of this kinase to activation by calmodulin."
https://openalex.org/W1494170055,"Human HeLa cells and murine L(S) cells are highly sensitive to the cytocidal activity of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) when simultaneously treated with the inhibitor of protein synthesis cycloheximide. This cytocidal activity of TNF was inhibited up to 90% in both cell lines after a 15-60-min pretreatment with 3-10 ng/ml of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). This inhibition was long lasting for HeLa cells but transient for L(S) cells. The protection afforded by PMA was most effective when the cells were pretreated with this phorbol ester, but it decreased when PMA was added together with TNF or after TNF addition. This finding suggested that PMA interfered with one of the early steps in the mechanism of action of TNF. A pretreatment with the calcium ionophore A23187 also reduced the cytocidal activity of TNF in both HeLa and L(S) cells to about the same extent. Treatment of these cells with either PMA or A23187 significantly decreased the binding of 125I-TNF to cell surface receptors. This decrease paralleled the time course and dose-response of the inhibition of cytocidal activity. In addition, treatment of HeLa cells with 1-oleyl-2-acetyl-glycerol (OAG) also induced a rapid loss of TNF binding capacity. Since OAG, PMA, and A23187 are all activators of protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme), these results suggest that this kinase is involved in modulation of TNF sensitivity. Furthermore, depletion or inhibition of protein kinase C antagonized PMA-induced effects on TNF cytotoxicity and binding to receptors. Internalization of bound TNF was not significantly affected by PMA treatment, and Scatchard analysis of binding data indicated that PMA decreased TNF receptor binding affinity rather than the number of TNF-binding sites. These findings suggest that protein kinase C may have a physiological role in mediating TNF sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W1508796353,"The inhibitory effects of Ca2+-binding proteins on tyrosine phosphorylation of p36 protein isolated from bovine intestinal epithelium by immunoprecipitated p130fps were investigated. S-100 protein dose dependently inhibited the p36 phosphorylation, and calmodulin weakly depressed the phosphorylation, whereas parvalbumin and troponin C had no significant effects. The S-100 preparation purified from bovine brain did not contain phosphatase activity or ATPase activity. The concentration of ATP did not affect the S-100-mediated inhibition of phosphorylation but the substrate protein, p36, reversed the inhibition. S-100 similarly inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of p36 by p60src but did not affect the p36 phosphorylation by protein kinase C. S-100 inhibited the tyrosine kinase activity of p130fps using the other substrates tested as well. These results suggest that S-100 interacts with the substrate binding site of retroviral tyrosine-specific protein kinases and may play a regulatory role in the tyrosine phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2028300441,"A four-component system has been designed that makes it possible to prepare a double-stranded (ds) DNA fragment; one fragment end is predesigned (by the use of a class-IIS restriction enzyme and adapter-primer), and the other end corresponds to any normal restriction cut. The system is composed of the phage M13mp7 single-stranded (ss) target DNA; the Fok I restriction enzyme; an oligodeoxynucleotide adapter-primer, which permits one to introduce Fok I cuts at any specified site in the target DNA; and DNA polymerase, which converts the ss target into a ds form ready for cloning. In this system, the oligodeoxynucleotide adapter-primer serves several purposes. The 5′ hairpin ds domain of the adapter-primer contains the Fok I recognition site. Its 3′ ss domain selects a complementary site on the target ss DNA, hybridizes with it to form the ds cleavage site, and serves as a primer to convert the ss M13mp7 target to ds DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1504620401,"Ligand photolysis and subsequent recombination in cytochromes b5 and c have been studied with picosecond resolution. In both proteins, an iron-histidine bond is broken after excitation with 314-nm light, and recombination occurs with a rate constant of about 1.4 x 10(11) s-1. Photolysis and reformation of the iron-histidine bond may be surprising as these hemoproteins do not reversibly bind ligands in nature. The findings are explained using results both from experiments on model hemes and from computer investigations with atomic resolution on the three-dimensional structure of the protein. After photolysis, the formation and recombination of the geminate contact pair are attributed to simple low amplitude ligand bond rotations, a result that can be applied to geminate processes in other hemoproteins and model heme compounds as well."
https://openalex.org/W1553673115,"Abstract High affinity mouse HMG-I binding sites have been distinguished from other (A+T)-rich sequences using band competition assays. These sites have been found 3' to the coding regions of a variety of genes. For the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase and minute virus of mice genes, high affinity HMG-1 binding sites were further localized to the functional polyadenylation signal by DNase I footprinting. These results suggest that HMG-I may function at the 3' ends of genes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1572506372,"Uteroferrin, an acid phosphatase with a spin-coupled and redox-active binuclear iron center, is paramagnetic in its pink, enzymatically active, mixed-valence (S = 1/2) state. Phosphate, a product and inhibitor of the enzymatic activity of uteroferrin, converts the pink, EPR-active form of the protein to a purple, EPR-silent species. In contrast, molybdate, a tetrahedral oxyanion analog of phosphate, transforms the EPR spectrum of uteroferrin from a rhombic to an axial form. With both electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopies, we observe a hyperfine interaction of [95Mo]molybdate with the S = 1/2, Fe(II)-Fe(III) center of the protein. A pair of 95Mo resonances centered at the 95Mo Larmor frequency at the applied magnetic field and separated by a hyperfine coupling constant of 1.2 MHz is evident. Therefore, a single monomeric species of molybdate is close to, and likely a ligand of, the binuclear cluster. 1H ENDOR studies on uteroferrin reveal at least six sets of lines mirrored about the 1H Larmor frequency. Two pairs of these lines become reduced in intensity when the protein is exchanged against D2O. Moreover, ESEEM and 2H ENDOR spectra display resonances at the 2H Larmor frequency. Therefore, the metal-binding region of the protein is accessible to solvent. Additional deuterium lines observable by ESEEM spectroscopy provide evidence for a population of strongly coupled, readily exchangeable protons associated with the binuclear center. The measured hyperfine coupling constants for these deuterons are orientation-dependent with splittings of nearly 4 MHz at g3 = 1.59 and less than 1 MHz at g1 = 1.94. In the presence of molybdate, ESEEM spectra of D2O-exchanged samples reveal a resonance at the 2H Larmor frequency, with no evidence of spectral components due to strongly coupled deuterons. 1H ENDOR studies of the uteroferrin-molybdate complex show at least seven pairs of lines, mirrored about the 1H Larmor frequency, of which one pair becomes attenuated in amplitude upon deuteration. The active site thus remains accessible to solvent in the presence of molybdate."
https://openalex.org/W1593190527,"The hamster elongation factor 2 gene was isolated from genomic libraries of diphtheria toxin- and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A-resistant cells containing non-ADP-ribosylatable elongation factor 2, and its structure was determined by a combination of restriction endonuclease mapping and DNA sequence analysis. The entire gene is about 6 kilobases long and has 13 exons. Almost all the introns are about 90-200 bases long, except the first and third, which are about 1 kilobase and 400 bases long, respectively. The first exon is processed just after the initiation codon for translation. The promoter of this gene was also characterized. As this gene contains the mutation conferring resistance to diphtheria toxin and P. aeruginosa exotoxin A, introduction of this gene into mammalian cells results in expression of toxin resistance. Using this characteristic, gene expression by deletion mutants of the 5'-flanking region were examined, and results showed that about 60 base pairs upstream of the TATA sequence were most efficient for expression of the elongation factor 2 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1599222247,"The properties of dephospho- and phosphofructose-1,6-bisphosphatase from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and of two mutant enzymes in which the phosphorylatable Ser11 had been changed by site-directed mutagenesis (Ser—-Ala and Ser—-Asp) were studied to clarify the role of cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation of yeast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. The mutant enzymes and wild type Ser11 fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase were overexpressed and purified to homogeneity. Phosphofructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was prepared by in vitro phosphorylation. The comparison of the properties of the above enzymes demonstrated that all four had similar maximum activity. However, the phosphoenzyme was about 3-fold more sensitive to AMP and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate inhibition than the dephosphoenzyme, suggesting that regulation operates in vivo by this mechanism, leading to decreased enzyme activity. The purified mutant enzymes Ala11 and Asp11 exhibited properties closely similar to those of dephospho- and phosphofructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, respectively. These results indicate that the functional group at residue 11 is an important factor in the regulation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity and that Ser(P) can be functionally substituted by Asp in this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1548103580,"Two monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies (anti-Id-135 and anti-Id-14, both of the IgM class) which interact with the binding site of opioid receptors were generated. A monoclonal anti-beta-endorphin antibody (3-E7) which displays binding characteristics for opioid ligands similar to opioid receptors served as the antigen (Gramsch, C., Meo, T., Riethmuller, G., and Herz, A., (1983) J. Neurochem. 40, 1220-1226; Meo, T., Gramsch, C., Inan, R., Hollt, V., Weber, E., Herz, A., and Riethmuller, G. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 4048-4088) and the hybridomas obtained were screened for anti-idiotypic antibodies with Fab fragments of 3-E7. The anti-idiotypes were then screened for opioid binding to rat brain membrane receptors, yielding several positive clones two of which were more intensively studied. Both anti-idiotypic antibodies were about equally potent in displacing the mu- and delta-opioid receptor ligands [3H]dihydromorphine, 125I-labeled beta-endorphin, [D-Ala2, D-Leu5-3H]enkephalin and [3H]naloxone from rat brain membrane opioid receptors; no interaction was observed with the kappa-ligands [3H]ethylketazocine or [3H]bremazocine. The anti-idiotypic antibodies were able to precipitate [3H] diprenorphine binding sites from solubilized opioid receptor preparations. In addition, both antibodies showed opioid antagonistic properties as demonstrated by their abilities to block the inhibitory effect of [D-Ala2, D-Leu5-3H]enkephalin on prostaglandin E1-stimulated cAMP accumulation in NG 108-15 hybrid cells. Our findings demonstrate the successful generation of monoclonal antibodies interacting with membrane-bound and solubilized opioid receptors of the mu- and delta-type."
https://openalex.org/W1491101945,"By cross-hybridization with a cDNA probe for the Xenopus laevis ribosomal protein L1 we have been able to isolate the homologous genes from a Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic library. We have shown that these genes code for a ribosomal protein which was previously named L2. In yeast, like in X. laevis, these genes are present in two copies per haploid genome and, unlike the vertebrate counterpart, they do not contain introns. Amino acid comparison of the X. laevis L1 and S. cerevisiae L2 proteins has shown the presence of a highly conserved protein domain embedded in very divergent sequences. Although these sequences are very poorly homologous, they confer an overall secondary structure and folding highly conserved in the two species."

https://openalex.org/W1565286892,"The metabolic flux through the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase reaction in perfused livers was monitored by measuring the rate of 14CO2 production from [1-14C]alpha-ketoglutarate. The rates of 14CO2 production and glucose production from [1-14C]alpha-ketoglutarate were increased with increasing perfusate alpha-ketoglutarate concentrations. Vasopressin, angiotensin II, and the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine stimulated transiently by 2.5-fold the metabolic flux through the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase reaction in the presence and absence of Ca2+ in the perfusion medium. High concentrations of glucagon (1 x 10(-8) M) and 8-p-chlorophenylthio-cAMP (100 microM) (data not shown) also stimulated transiently the metabolic flux through the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase reaction. However, lower glucagon concentrations (1 x 10(-9) M) stimulated the rate of 14CO2 production from [1-14C]alpha-ketoglutarate only under conditions optimized to fix the cellular oxidation-reduction state at an intermediate level, when glucagon (1 x 10(-9) M)-mediated elevation of cAMP content was greater than that observed under highly oxidizing and reducing conditions. These data indicate that agonists which increase cytosolic free Ca2+ levels stimulate the metabolic flux through the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. Furthermore, the data presented here demonstrate for the first time that physiological glucagon concentrations stimulate the metabolic flux through the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase reaction only under conditions known to be optimal for glucagon-mediated Ca2+ mobilization in the isolated perfused rat liver."
https://openalex.org/W1675294610,"Bacteriophage T4 ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase consists of alpha 2 and beta 2 subunits encoded by genes nrdA and nrdB, respectively, and plays a central role in the T4-induced deoxyribonucleotide synthetase complex. The accompanying paper describes the decreased rate of synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides after infection by the T4 mutant, nrdB93, and the suppression of this defect by a second mutation in gene 39, coding for one of the three protein chains of T4 DNA topoisomerase. In this study we examined these effects at the protein level. On infection by nrdB93 not only was the beta 93 protein chain altered, as shown by its migration relative to the wild type protein in electrophoretic gels and by its temperature sensitivity, but the infected cells showed very low levels of the protein. However, on infection with the double mutant of nrdB93 and 39-01 (gene 39) the concentration of beta 93 chain returned to the values of beta protein found with wild type phage. A double mutant bearing nrdB93 and an amber mutation of gene 39 also suppressed the nrdB93 defect. By contrast, a temperature-sensitive mutant of gene 39, A41, did not show suppression at either 30 or 41 degrees C. Amber mutations in the two other genes coding for T4 DNA topoisomerase, 52 and 60, did not suppress the defect. We propose that the deficiency in the quantity of beta 93 chain and the suppression of this defect occur at the transcriptional or translational expression of the nrdB93 gene and that a specific domain of the gene 39 protein, not acting in the capacity of T4 DNA topoisomerase, inhibits the expression."
https://openalex.org/W1591456362,"Bacteriophage T4 infection is known to induce the formation of a complex of enzymes effecting the de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, which in turn are channeled into T4 DNA replication. The first step in this pathway is catalyzed by a ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase, comprised of subunits coded by T4 genes nrdA and nrdB. Maximum rates of synthesis of the pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides and of DNA replication in vivo also require a type II DNA topoisomerase encoded by T4 genes 39, 52, and 60. We report the identification of a unique mutant, nrdB93, and the suppression of its defective deoxyribonucleotide synthesis by a gene 39 mutation, 39-01. After infection by 39-01, DNA synthesis and plaque formation were temperature-sensitive, but nearly wild type rates of deoxyribonucleotide synthesis were retained at all temperatures. The nrdB93 mutation had a profound effect on deoxyribonucleotide synthesis at 41 degrees C; even at the permissive temperature of 30 degrees C, synthesis was reduced to 30% of that of wild type or 39-01. However, on infection at 30 degrees C by the double mutant, 39-01 nrdB93, the level of deoxyribonucleotide synthesis again reached that of wild type phage infections; involvement of the comparable host enzyme in the suppression process has been excluded. Suppression of the effect of nrdB93 by 39-01 implicates the gene 39 product in the regulation of nrdB expression. The accompanying paper (Cook, K. S., Wirak, D. O., Seasholtz, A. F., and Greenberg, G. R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6202-6208) examines the nature of the suppression process at the molecular level."
