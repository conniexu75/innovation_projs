https://openalex.org/W2890597423,"The roles and regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis (a non-apoptotic form of cell death) in cancer remain unclear. The tumour suppressor BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) encodes a nuclear deubiquitinating enzyme to reduce histone 2A ubiquitination (H2Aub) on chromatin. Here, integrated transcriptomic, epigenomic and cancer genomic analyses link BAP1 to metabolism-related biological processes, and identify cystine transporter SLC7A11 as a key BAP1 target gene in human cancers. Functional studies reveal that BAP1 decreases H2Aub occupancy on the SLC7A11 promoter and represses SLC7A11 expression in a deubiquitinating-dependent manner, and that BAP1 inhibits cystine uptake by repressing SLC7A11 expression, leading to elevated lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Furthermore, we show that BAP1 inhibits tumour development partly through SLC7A11 and ferroptosis, and that cancer-associated BAP1 mutants lose their abilities to repress SLC7A11 and to promote ferroptosis. Together, our results uncover a previously unappreciated epigenetic mechanism coupling ferroptosis to tumour suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2892052043,"Multiple optical harmonic generation—the multiplication of photon energy as a result of nonlinear interaction between light and matter—is a key technology in modern electronics and optoelectronics, because it allows the conversion of optical or electronic signals into signals with much higher frequency, and the generation of frequency combs. Owing to the unique electronic band structure of graphene, which features massless Dirac fermions1–3, it has been repeatedly predicted that optical harmonic generation in graphene should be particularly efficient at the technologically important terahertz frequencies4–6. However, these predictions have yet to be confirmed experimentally under technologically relevant operation conditions. Here we report the generation of terahertz harmonics up to the seventh order in single-layer graphene at room temperature and under ambient conditions, driven by terahertz fields of only tens of kilovolts per centimetre, and with field conversion efficiencies in excess of 10−3, 10−4 and 10−5 for the third, fifth and seventh terahertz harmonics, respectively. These conversion efficiencies are remarkably high, given that the electromagnetic interaction occurs in a single atomic layer. The key to such extremely efficient generation of terahertz high harmonics in graphene is the collective thermal response of its background Dirac electrons to the driving terahertz fields. The terahertz harmonics, generated via hot Dirac fermion dynamics, were observed directly in the time domain as electromagnetic field oscillations at these newly synthesized higher frequencies. The effective nonlinear optical coefficients of graphene for the third, fifth and seventh harmonics exceed the respective nonlinear coefficients of typical solids by 7–18 orders of magnitude7–9. Our results provide a direct pathway to highly efficient terahertz frequency synthesis using the present generation of graphene electronics, which operate at much lower fundamental frequencies of only a few hundreds of gigahertz. Efficient terahertz harmonic generation—challenging but important for ultrahigh-speed optoelectronic technologies—is demonstrated in graphene through a nonlinear process that could potentially be generalized to other materials."
https://openalex.org/W2891870314,"Structural variants (SVs) can contribute to oncogenesis through a variety of mechanisms. Despite their importance, the identification of SVs in cancer genomes remains challenging. Here, we present a framework that integrates optical mapping, high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), and whole-genome sequencing to systematically detect SVs in a variety of normal or cancer samples and cell lines. We identify the unique strengths of each method and demonstrate that only integrative approaches can comprehensively identify SVs in the genome. By combining Hi-C and optical mapping, we resolve complex SVs and phase multiple SV events to a single haplotype. Furthermore, we observe widespread structural variation events affecting the functions of noncoding sequences, including the deletion of distal regulatory sequences, alteration of DNA replication timing, and the creation of novel three-dimensional chromatin structural domains. Our results indicate that noncoding SVs may be underappreciated mutational drivers in cancer genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2890277889,"Quantum light sources are characterized by their distinctive statistical distribution of photons. For example, single photons and correlated photon pairs exhibit antibunching and reduced variance in the number distribution that is impossible with classical light. Most common realizations of quantum light sources have relied on spontaneous parametric processes such as down-conversion (SPDC) and four-wave mixing (SFWM). These processes are mediated by vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. Therefore, by manipulating the electromagnetic mode structure, for example, using nanophotonic systems, one can engineer the spectrum of generated photons. However, such manipulations are susceptible to fabrication disorders which are ubiquitous in nanophotonic systems and lead to device-to-device variations in the spectrum of generated photons. Here, we demonstrate topologically robust mode engineering of the electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations and implement a nanophotonic quantum light source where the spectrum of generated photons is robust against fabrication disorders. Specifically, we use the topological edge states to achieve an enhanced and robust generation of correlated photon pairs using SFWM and show that they outperform their topologically-trivial counterparts. We demonstrate the non-classical nature of our source using conditional antibunching of photons which confirms that we have realized a robust source of heralded single photons. Such topological effects, which are unique to bosonic systems, could pave the way for the development of robust quantum photonic devices."
https://openalex.org/W2891881295,"The increasing use of species distribution modeling (SDM) has raised new concerns regarding the inaccuracies, misunderstanding, and misuses of this important tool. One of those possible pitfalls − collinearity among environmental predictors − is assumed as an important source of model uncertainty, although it has not been subjected to a detailed evaluation in recent SDM studies. It is expected that collinearity will increase uncertainty in model parameters and decrease statistical power. Here we use a virtual species approach to compare models built using subsets of PCA-derived variables with models based on the original highly correlated climate variables. Moreover, we evaluated whether modelling algorithms and species data characteristics generate models with varying sensitivity to collinearity. As expected, collinearity among predictors decreases the efficiency and increases the uncertainty of species distribution models. Nevertheless, the intensity of the effect varied according to the algorithm properties: more complex procedures behaved better than simple envelope models. This may support the claim that complex models such as Maxent take advantage of existing collinearity in finding the best set of parameters. The interaction of the different factors with species characteristics (centroid and tolerance in environmental space) highlighted the importance of the so-called “idiosyncrasy in species responses” to model efficiency, but differences in prevalence may represent a better explanation. However, even models with low accuracy to predict suitability of individual cells may provide meaningful information on the estimation of range-size, a key species-trait for macroecological studies. We concluded that the use of PCA-derived variables is advised both to control the negative effects of collinearity and as a more objective solution for the problem of variable selection in studies dealing with large number of species with heterogeneous responses to environmental variables."
https://openalex.org/W2892120728,"A major role of vision is to guide navigation, and navigation is strongly driven by vision1-4. Indeed, the brain's visual and navigational systems are known to interact5,6, and signals related to position in the environment have been suggested to appear as early as in the visual cortex6,7. Here, to establish the nature of these signals, we recorded in the primary visual cortex (V1) and hippocampal area CA1 while mice traversed a corridor in virtual reality. The corridor contained identical visual landmarks in two positions, so that a purely visual neuron would respond similarly at those positions. Most V1 neurons, however, responded solely or more strongly to the landmarks in one position rather than the other. This modulation of visual responses by spatial location was not explained by factors such as running speed. To assess whether the modulation is related to navigational signals and to the animal's subjective estimate of position, we trained the mice to lick for a water reward upon reaching a reward zone in the corridor. Neuronal populations in both CA1 and V1 encoded the animal's position along the corridor, and the errors in their representations were correlated. Moreover, both representations reflected the animal's subjective estimate of position, inferred from the animal's licks, better than its actual position. When animals licked in a given location-whether correctly or incorrectly-neural populations in both V1 and CA1 placed the animal in the reward zone. We conclude that visual responses in V1 are controlled by navigational signals, which are coherent with those encoded in hippocampus and reflect the animal's subjective position. The presence of such navigational signals as early as a primary sensory area suggests that they permeate sensory processing in the cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2891509242,"Mood state changes are decoded using human neural activity data from electrodes implanted in seven epilepsy patients. The ability to decode mood state over time from neural activity could enable closed-loop systems to treat neuropsychiatric disorders. However, this decoding has not been demonstrated, partly owing to the difficulty of modeling distributed mood-relevant neural dynamics while dealing with the sparsity of mood state measurements. Here we develop a modeling framework to decode mood state variations from multi-site intracranial recordings in seven human subjects with epilepsy who self-reported their mood state intermittently over multiple days. We built dynamic neural encoding models of mood state and corresponding decoders for each individual and demonstrated that mood state variations over time can be decoded from neural activity. Across subjects, the decoders largely recruited neural signals from limbic regions, whose spectro-spatial features were tuned to mood variations. The dynamic models also provided an analytical tool to compute the timescales of the decoded mood state. These results provide an initial line of evidence indicating the feasibility of mood state decoding."
https://openalex.org/W2890313592,"Essential biological functions, such as mitosis, require tight coordination of hundreds of proteins in space and time. Localization, the timing of interactions and changes in cellular structure are all crucial to ensure the correct assembly, function and regulation of protein complexes1-4. Imaging of live cells can reveal protein distributions and dynamics but experimental and theoretical challenges have prevented the collection of quantitative data, which are necessary for the formulation of a model of mitosis that comprehensively integrates information and enables the analysis of the dynamic interactions between the molecular parts of the mitotic machinery within changing cellular boundaries. Here we generate a canonical model of the morphological changes during the mitotic progression of human cells on the basis of four-dimensional image data. We use this model to integrate dynamic three-dimensional concentration data of many fluorescently knocked-in mitotic proteins, imaged by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy-calibrated microscopy5. The approach taken here to generate a dynamic protein atlas of human cell division is generic; it can be applied to systematically map and mine dynamic protein localization networks that drive cell division in different cell types, and can be conceptually transferred to other cellular functions."
https://openalex.org/W2890399078,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBMs) are recurrent lethal brain tumours. Recurrent GBMs often exhibit mesenchymal, stem-like phenotypes that could explain their resistance to therapy. Analyses revealed that recurrent GBMs have increased tension and express high levels of glycoproteins that increase the bulkiness of the glycocalyx. Studies showed that a bulky glycocalyx potentiates integrin mechanosignalling and tissue tension and promotes a mesenchymal, stem-like phenotype in GBMs. Gain- and loss-of-function studies implicated integrin mechanosignalling as an inducer of GBM growth, survival, invasion and treatment resistance, and a mesenchymal, stem-like phenotype. Mesenchymal-like GBMs were highly contractile and expressed elevated levels of glycoproteins that expanded their glycocalyx, and they were surrounded by a stiff extracellular matrix that potentiated integrin mechanosignalling. Our findings suggest that there is a dynamic and reciprocal link between integrin mechanosignalling and a bulky glycocalyx, implying a causal link towards a mesenchymal, stem-like phenotype in GBMs. Strategies to ameliorate GBM tissue tension offer a therapeutic approach to reduce mortality due to GBM."

https://openalex.org/W2890140503,"Understanding the determinants of broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) evolution is crucial for the development of bNAb-based HIV vaccines1. Despite emerging information on cofactors that promote bNAb evolution in natural HIV-1 infections, in which the induction of bNAbs is genuinely rare2, information on the impact of the infecting virus strain on determining the breadth and specificity of the antibody responses to HIV-1 is lacking. Here we analyse the influence of viral antigens in shaping antibody responses in humans. We call the ability of a virus strain to induce similar antibody responses across different hosts its antibody-imprinting capacity, which from an evolutionary biology perspective corresponds to the viral heritability of the antibody responses. Analysis of 53 measured parameters of HIV-1-binding and neutralizing antibody responses in a cohort of 303 HIV-1 transmission pairs (individuals who harboured highly related HIV-1 strains and were putative direct transmission partners or members of an HIV-1 transmission chain) revealed that the effect of the infecting virus on the outcome of the bNAb response is moderate in magnitude but highly significant. We introduce the concept of bNAb-imprinting viruses and provide evidence for the existence of such viruses in a systematic screening of our cohort. The bNAb-imprinting capacity can be substantial, as indicated by a transmission pair with highly similar HIV-1 antibody responses and strong bNAb activity. Identification of viruses that have bNAb-imprinting capacities and their characterization may thus provide the potential to develop lead immunogens."
https://openalex.org/W2890974598,"Skeletal muscle mass is regulated by the coordinated activation of several anabolic and catabolic pathways. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a major site of protein folding and a reservoir for calcium ions. Accretion of misfolded proteins or depletion in calcium concentration causes stress in the ER, which leads to the activation of a signaling network known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). In the present study, we investigated the role of the protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) arm of the UPR in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass and function in naive conditions and in a mouse model of cancer cachexia. Our results demonstrate that the targeted inducible deletion of PERK reduces skeletal muscle mass, strength, and force production during isometric contractions. Deletion of PERK also causes a slow-to-fast fiber type transition in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of PERK leads to atrophy in cultured myotubes. While increasing the rate of protein synthesis, the targeted deletion of PERK leads to the increased expression of components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy in skeletal muscle. Ablation of PERK also increases the activation of calpains and deregulates the gene expression of the members of the FGF19 subfamily. Furthermore, the targeted deletion of PERK increases muscle wasting in Lewis lung carcinoma tumor-bearing mice. Our findings suggest that the PERK arm of the UPR is essential for the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass and function in adult mice.-Gallot, Y. S., Bohnert, K. R., Straughn, A. R., Xiong, G., Hindi, S. M., Kumar, A. PERK regulates skeletal muscle mass and contractile function in adult mice."
https://openalex.org/W2890116146,"Solute carrier family 7 member 2 (SLC7A2, also known as CAT2) is an inducible transporter of the semi-essential amino acid L-arginine (L-Arg), which has been implicated in wound repair. We have reported that both SLC7A2 expression and L-Arg availability are decreased in colonic tissues from inflammatory bowel disease patients and that mice lacking Slc7a2 exhibit a more severe disease course when exposed to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Here, we present evidence that SLC7A2 plays a role in modulating colon tumorigenesis in the azoxymethane (AOM)-DSS model of colitis-associated carcinogenesis (CAC). SLC7A2 was localized predominantly to colonic epithelial cells in WT mice. Utilizing the AOM-DSS model, Slc7a2-/- mice had significantly increased tumor number, burden, and risk of high-grade dysplasia vs. WT mice. Tumors from Slc7a2-/- mice exhibited significantly increased levels of the proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines IL-1β, CXCL1, CXCL5, IL-3, CXCL2, CCL3, and CCL4, but decreased levels of IL-4, CXCL9, and CXCL10 compared to tumors from WT mice. This was accompanied by a shift toward pro-tumorigenic M2 macrophage activation in Slc7a2-deficient mice, as marked by increased colonic CD11b+F4/80+ARG1+ cells with no alteration in CD11b+F4/80+NOS2+ cells by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy. The shift toward M2 macrophage activation was confirmed in bone marrow-derived macrophages from Slc7a2-/- mice. In bone marrow chimeras between Slc7a2-/- and WT mice, the recipient genotype drove the CAC phenotype, suggesting the importance of epithelial SLC7A2 in abrogating neoplastic risk. These data reveal that SLC7A2 has a significant role in the protection from CAC in the setting of chronic colitis, and suggest that the decreased SLC7A2 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may contribute to CAC risk. Strategies to enhance L-Arg availability by supplementing L-Arg and/or increasing L-Arg uptake could represent a therapeutic approach in IBD to reduce the substantial long-term risk of colorectal carcinoma."

https://openalex.org/W2891746591,"Osteopontin (OPN) is a pleiotropic protein and is abundantly present in milk. Its functions include immune modulation and cellular proliferation and differentiation. OPN is highly expressed in the brain. We investigated the effects of milk-derived OPN on brain development of mouse pups. Wild-type (WT) dams producing OPN+ milk and OPN knockout (KO) dams producing OPN- milk nursed WT pups (OPN+/+), yielding 2 pup treatment groups, OPN+ OPN+/+ and OPN- OPN+/+, for comparison. Preliminary studies supported use of this model by showing high concentrations of OPN in milk of WT dams and no OPN in milk of OPN KO dams, and production of similar amounts of milk by WT and KO dams. The ability of ingested milk OPN to enter the brain was revealed by appearance of orally gavaged [125I]-labeled and antibody-probed milk OPN in brains of pups. Brain OPN mRNA levels were similar in both nursed groups, but the brain OPN protein level was significantly lower in the OPN- OPN+/+ group at postnatal days 6 and 8. Behavior tests showed impaired memory and learning ability in OPN- OPN+/+ pups. In addition, our study revealed increased expression of myelination-related proteins and elevated proliferation and differentiation of NG-2 glia into oligodendrocytes in the brain of OPN+ OPN+/+ pups, accompanied by increased activation of ERK-1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling. We concluded that milk OPN can play an important role in brain development and behavior in infancy by promoting myelination.-Jiang, R., Prell, C., Lönnerdal, B.

https://openalex.org/W2890237534,"Psoriasis is characterized by keratinocyte hyperproliferation, erythema, as well as a form of pruritus, involving cutaneous discomfort. There is evidence from both clinical and murine models of psoriasis that chemical or surgical depletion of small-diameter sensory nerves/nociceptors benefits the condition, but the mechanisms are unclear. Hence, we aimed to understand the involvement of sensory nerve mediators with a murine model of psoriasis and associated spontaneous behaviors, indicative of cutaneous discomfort. We have established an Aldara model of psoriasis in mice and chemically depleted the small-diameter nociceptors in a selective manner. The spontaneous behaviors, in addition to the erythema and skin pathology, were markedly improved. Attenuated inflammation was associated with reduced dermal macrophage influx and production of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (peroxynitrite and protein nitrosylation). Subsequently, this directly influenced observed behavioral responses. However, the blockade of common sensory neurogenic mechanisms for transient receptor potential (TRP)V1, TRPA1, and neuropeptides (substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) using genetic and pharmacological approaches inhibited the behaviors but not the inflammation. Thus, a critical role of the established sensory TRP-neuropeptide pathway in influencing cutaneous discomfort is revealed, indicating the therapeutic potential of agents that block that pathway. The ongoing inflammation is mediated by a distinct sensory pathway involving macrophage activation.—Kodji, X., Arkless, K. L., Kee, Z., Cleary, S. J., Aubdool, A.

https://openalex.org/W2889994107,"The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) controls metabolic pathways in response to nutrients. Recently, we have shown that mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) modulates the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) by promoting the expression of the key enzyme of the HBP, glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase 1 (GFAT1). Here, we found that GFAT1 Ser-243 phosphorylation is also modulated in an mTORC2-dependent manner. In response to glutamine limitation, active mTORC2 prolongs the duration of Ser-243 phosphorylation, albeit at lower amplitude. Blocking glycolysis using 2-deoxyglucose robustly enhances Ser-243 phosphorylation, correlating with heightened mTORC2 activation, increased AMPK activity, and O-GlcNAcylation. However, when 2-deoxyglucose is combined with glutamine deprivation, GFAT1 Ser-243 phosphorylation and mTORC2 activation remain elevated, whereas AMPK activation and O-GlcNAcylation diminish. Phosphorylation at Ser-243 promotes GFAT1 expression and production of GFAT1-generated metabolites including ample production of the HBP end-product, UDP-GlcNAc, despite nutrient starvation. Hence, we propose that the mTORC2-mediated increase in GFAT1 Ser-243 phosphorylation promotes flux through the HBP to maintain production of UDP-GlcNAc when nutrients are limiting. Our findings provide insights on how the HBP is reprogrammed via mTORC2 in nutrient-addicted cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2891812211,"Background Mosquitoes belonging to genus Aedes are the prime vectors of several arboviral diseases such as Dengue, Zika and Chikungunya worldwide. Every year numerous cases of dengue infections occur throughout the world, proper control of which depends on efficient vector control. However the onset of insecticide resistance has resulted in failure of vector control approaches. Principal findings This study was carried out to unveil the degree of prevailing insecticide resistance along with its underlying mechanisms among the primary dengue vector in dengue endemic districts of West Bengal, India through standard WHO protocol. It was observed that, the majority of the tested populations were found to possess resistance to more than one insecticide. In adult bioassay, the toxicity levels of the six tested insecticides was found to decrease in the following order: deltamethrin > lambdacyhalothrin > malathion > propoxur > permethrin > DDT. In larval bioassay, one of the tested populations was found to possess moderate resistance against temephos, mortality percentage 92.5% and 79.8% for WHO (0.0200 ppm) and National Vector Borne disease Programme, India recommended dose (0.0125 ppm) respectively. Carboxylesterases were found to be involved in conferring resistance as revealed in synergistic and quantitative assay against temephos in North Dinajpur (NDP) population and malathion in Alipurduar (APD) and Darjeeling (DAR) populations. Similar correlations were also observed in the majority of the tested populations between reduced susceptibilities against pyrethroid insecticides and Cytochrome P450s activity. Conclusion Efficient disease management in this region can only be achieved through proper integrated vector management along with tools to minimize insecticide resistance. This study may help the concerned authorities in the formulation of an effective vector control strategy throughout this region incorporating the knowledge gained through this study."
https://openalex.org/W2952571592,"Plant species in the family Solanaceae are the usual hosts of potato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli (Šulc) (Hemiptera: Psylloidea: Triozidae). However, the psyllid has also been shown to develop on some species of Convolvulaceae (bindweeds and morning glories). Developmental success on Convolvulaceae is surprising given the rarity of psyllid species worldwide associated with this plant family. We assayed 14 species of Convolvulaceae across four genera (Convolvulus, Calystegia, Ipomoea, Turbina) to identify species that allow development of potato psyllid. Two populations of psyllids were assayed (Texas, Washington). The Texas population overlaps extensively with native Convolvulaceae, whereas Washington State is noticeably lacking in Convolvulaceae. Results of assays were overlain on a phylogenetic analysis of plant species to examine whether Convolvulaceae distantly related to the typical host (potato) were less likely to allow development than species of Convolvulaceae more closely related. Survival was independent of psyllid population and location of the plant species on our phylogenetic tree. We then examined whether presence of a fungal symbiont of Convolvulaceae (Periglandula spp.) affected psyllid survival. These fungi associate with Convolvulaceae and produce a class of mycotoxins (ergot alkaloids) that may confer protection against plant-feeding arthropods. Periglandula was found in 11 of our 14 species, including in two genera (Convolvulus, Calystegia) not previously known to host the symbiont. Of these 11 species, leaf tissues from five contained large quantities of two classes of ergot alkaloids (clavines, amides of lysergic acid) when evaluated by LC-MS/MS. All five species also harbored Periglandula. No ergot alkaloids were detected in species free of the fungal symbiont. Potato psyllid rapidly died on the five species that harbored Periglandula and contained ergot alkaloids, but survived to adulthood on seven of the nine species in which ergot alkaloids were not detected. These results support the hypothesis that a plant-fungus symbiotic relationship affects the suitability of certain Convolvulaceae to potato psyllid."
https://openalex.org/W2888216438,"The cost of reproduction is a key concept in life-history trade-offs. However, our understanding of the reproductive costs is biased towards measures of reproductive effort obtained before offspring independence. During the post-fledging dependence period (PFDP), it is well known that parents feed and protect their offspring. However, the effort devoted to this reproductive activity has never been considered in the context of of the costs of reproduction. Moreover, the potential fitness benefits and costs for offspring and parents, respectively, of the duration of the PFDP are largely unknown. We estimated the duration of the PFDP over 5 years using wild common kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) and studied its association with survival probability and future parental reproductive performance. Our results show that longer PFDPs increase the survival probability of fledglings, probably due to the benefits obtained from parental care. In addition, we found that providing longer PFDPs was associated with reduced clutch sizes but not the number of fledglings in the subsequent breeding season in males. We suggest that increased parental expenditures on offspring during the PFDP may represent a potential cost of reproduction in breeding males."
https://openalex.org/W2892052286,"Bacterial conjugation is a key mechanism by which bacteria acquire antibiotic resistance. Therefore, conjugation inhibitors (COINs) are promising compounds in the fight against the spread of antibiotic resistance genes among bacteria. Unsaturated fatty acids (uFAs) and alkynoic fatty acid derivatives, such as 2-hexadecanoic acid (2-HDA), have been reported previously as being effective COINs. The traffic ATPase TrwD, a VirB11 homolog in plasmid R388, is the molecular target of these compounds, which likely affect binding of TrwD to bacterial membranes. In this work, we demonstrate that COINs are abundantly incorporated into Escherichia coli membranes, replacing palmitic acid as the major component of the membrane. We also show that TrwD binds palmitic acid, thus facilitating its interaction with the membrane. Our findings also suggest that COINs bind TrwD at a site that is otherwise occupied by palmitic acid. Accordingly, molecular docking predictions with palmitic acid indicated that it shares the same binding site as uFAs and 2-HDA, although it differs in the contacts involved in this interaction. We also identified 2-bromopalmitic acid, a palmitate analog that inhibits many membrane-associated enzymes, as a compound that effectively reduces TrwD ATPase activity and bacterial conjugation. Moreover, we demonstrate that 2-bromopalmitic and palmitic acids both compete for the same binding site in TrwD. Altogether, these detailed findings open up a new avenue in the search for effective synthetic inhibitors of bacterial conjugation, which may be pivotal for combating multidrug-resistant bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2891388286,"The ATPase inhibitory factor 1 (IF1) is an intrinsically disordered protein that regulates the activity of the mitochondrial ATP synthase. Phosphorylation of S39 in IF1 prevents it from binding to the enzyme and thus abolishes its inhibitory activity. Dysregulation of IF1 is linked to different human diseases, providing a relevant biomarker of cancer progression. However, the tissue content of IF1 relative to the abundance of the ATP synthase is unknown. In this study, we characterized the tissue-specific expression of IF1 in human and mouse tissues and quantitated the content of IF1 and of ATP synthase. We found relevant differences in IF1 expression between human and mouse tissues and found that in high-energy–demanding tissues, the molar content of IF1 exceeds that of the ATP synthase. In these tissues, a fraction of IF1 is bound to the enzyme, and the other fraction is phosphorylated and hence is unable to bind the enzyme. Post-transcriptional control accounts for most of the regulated expression of IF1, especially in mouse heart, where IF1 mRNA translation is repressed by the leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat containing protein. Overall, these findings enlighten the cellular biology of IF1 and pave the way to development of additional models that address its role in pathophysiology.—Esparza-Moltó, P.

https://openalex.org/W2890733589,"No scores presently exist to predict bleeding in atrial fibrillation (AF) populations using direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). We used data from two independent healthcare claims databases to develop and validate a predictive model of major bleeding in a contemporary AF population.Patients with non-valvular AF initiating oral anticoagulation were identified in the MarketScan databases from 2007-2014. Using Cox regression models in 1000 bootstrapped samples, we developed a model that selected variables predicting major bleeding in the first year after anticoagulant initiation. The final model was validated in patients with non-valvular AF in the Optum Clinformatics database in the period 2009-2015. The discriminative ability of existing bleeding scores were individually evaluated and compared with the new bleeding model termed Anticoagulation-specific Bleeding Score (ABS) in both MarketScan and Optum.Among 119,083 patients with AF initiating oral anticoagulation in the derivation cohort, 4,030 experienced a bleeding event. The variable selection model identified 15 variables (including individual type of oral anticoagulant) associated with major bleeding. Discrimination of the model was modest [c-statistic 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67-0.69]. The model was subsequently applied to 81,285 AF patients in the validation data set (3,238 bleeding events), showing similar discrimination (c-statistic 0.68, 95% CI 0.67-0.69). In both cohorts, the predictive performance of the ABS was better than the existing models for bleeding prediction in AF.We developed a model that uses administrative healthcare data for the identification of AF patients at higher risk of bleeding after initiation of oral anticoagulation, taking into account the lower bleeding risk in DOAC compared to warfarin users."
https://openalex.org/W2891671483,"Introduction Sexual dysfunction is a common complication for men with diabetes, yet little is known about the lived experiences of sexual difficulties within the context of diabetes, particularly in low-and-middle-income countries. This study explores how men with type 2 diabetes in three sub-Saharan African settings (Cape Town and Johannesburg, South Africa; Lilongwe, Malawi) perceive and experience sexual functioning and sexual well-being, and the biopsychosocial contexts in which these occur and are shaped. Methods We used a qualitative research design, including individual interviews (n = 15) and focus group discussions (n = 4). Forty-seven men were included in the study. We used an inductive thematic analysis approach to develop our findings. A biopsychosocial conceptual model on the relationship between chronic illness and sexuality informed the interpretation of findings. Results Men across the study settings identified sexual difficulties as a central concern of living with diabetes. These difficulties went beyond biomedical issues of erectile dysfunction, comprising complex psychological and relational effects. Low self-esteem, related to a sense of loss of masculinity and reduced sexual and emotional intimacy in partner relationships were common experiences. Specific negative relational effects included suspicion of infidelity, mutual mistrust, general unhappiness, and fear of losing support from partners. These effects may impact on men’s ability to cope with their diabetes. Further stressors were a lack of information about the reasons for their sexual difficulties, perceived lack of support from healthcare providers and an inability to communicate with partners about sexual difficulties. Conclusion More in-depth research is needed to better understand sexual functioning and well-being within the context of diabetes, and its potential impact on diabetes self-management. Holistic and patient-centered care should include raising awareness of sexual problems as a potential complication of diabetes amongst patients, their partners and care providers, and incorporating sexual well-being as part of routine clinical care."
https://openalex.org/W2890087807,"Using differentiated rat L6 cells, we studied the direct effect of 3,5,3'-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3) and 3,5-diiodo-l-thyronine (T2) on the response to insulin in presence of fatty acids with a varying degree of saturation. We found that T3 and T2 both invert the response to insulin by modulating Akt Ser473 phosphorylation in the presence of palmitate and oleate. Both hormones prevented palmitate-induced insulin resistance, whereas increased insulin sensitivity in the presence of oleate was reduced, with normalization to (or, in the case of T3, even below) control levels. Both hormones effectively reduced intracellular acylcarnitine concentrations. Interestingly, insulin sensitization was lowered by incubation of the myotubes with relevant concentrations of palmitoylcarnitines (C16) and increased by oleylcarnitines and linoleylcarnitines (C18:1 and C18:2, respectively). The efficiency of mitochondrial respiration decreased in the order palmitate-oleate-linoleate; in the presence of palmitate, only T3 increased ATP synthesis-independent cellular respiration and mitochondrial respiratory complex activities. Both hormones modulated gene expression and enzyme activities related to insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, and lipid handling. Although T2 and T3 differentially regulated the expression of relevant genes involved in glucose metabolism, they equally stimulated related metabolic activities. T2 and T3 differentially modulated mitochondrial fatty acid uptake and oxidation in the presence of each fatty acid. The results show that T2 and T3 both invert the fatty acid-induced response to insulin but through different mechanisms, and that the outcome depends on the degree of saturation of the fatty acids and their derived acylcarnitines.-Giacco, A., delli Paoli, G., Senese, R., Cioffi, F., Silvestri, E., Moreno, M., Ruoppolo, M., Caterino, M., Costanzo, M., Lombardi, A., Goglia, F., Lanni, A., de Lange, P. The saturation degree of fatty acids and their derived acylcarnitines determines the direct effect of metabolically active thyroid hormones on insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W2889942051,"Immune homeostasis maintenance throughout pregnancy is critical for normal fetal development. Trophoblast cells differentiate into an invasive phenotype and contribute to the transformation of maternal arteries and the functional shaping of decidual leukocyte populations. Insufficient trophoblast invasion, inadequate vascular remodeling, and a loss of immunologic homeostasis are associated with pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a pleiotropic neuropeptide synthetized in trophoblasts at the maternal–placental interface. It regulates the function of trophoblast cells and their interaction with decidual leukocytes. By means of a murine model of pregnancy in normal maternal background with VIP-deficient trophoblast cells, here we demonstrate that trophoblast VIP is critical for trophoblast function: VIP gene haploinsufficiency results in lower matrix metalloproteinase 9 expression, and reduced migration and invasion capacities. A reduced number of regulatory T cells at the implantation sites along with a lower expression of proangiogenic and antiinflammatory markers were also observed. Findings detected in the implantation sites at early stages were followed by an abnormal placental structure and lower fetal weight. This effect was overcome by VIP treatment of the early pregnant mice. Our results support the relevance of trophoblast-synthesized VIP as a critical factor in vivo for trophoblast-cell function and immune homeostasis maintenance in mouse pregnancy.—Hauk, V., Vota, D., Gallino, L., Calo, G., Paparini, D., Merech, F., Ochoa, F., Zotta, E., Ramhorst, R., Waschek, J., Leirós, C.

https://openalex.org/W2891640476,"Hyperammonemia is the common biochemical hallmark of urea cycle disorders, activating neurotoxic pathways. If untreated, affected individuals have a high risk of irreversible brain damage and mortality. Here we show that acute hyperammonemia strongly enhances transamination-dependent formation of osmolytic glutamine and excitatory glutamate, thereby inducing neurotoxicity and death in ammoniotelic zebrafish larvae via synergistically acting overactivation of NMDA receptors and bioenergetic impairment induced by depletion of 2-oxoglutarate. Intriguingly, specific and irreversible inhibition of ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) by 5-fluoromethylornithine rescues zebrafish from lethal concentrations of ammonium acetate and corrects hyperammonemia-induced biochemical alterations. Thus, OAT inhibition is a promising and effective therapeutic approach for preventing neurotoxicity and mortality in acute hyperammonemia."
https://openalex.org/W2891616464,"The Nem1–Spo7 protein phosphatase plays a role in lipid synthesis by controlling the membrane localization of Pah1, the diacylglycerol-producing phosphatidate (PA) phosphatase that is crucial for the synthesis of triacylglycerol in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By dephosphorylating Pah1, Nem1–Spo7 facilitates its translocation to the nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membrane for catalytic activity. Like its substrate Pah1, Nem1–Spo7 is phosphorylated in the cell, but the specific protein kinases involved remain to be identified. In this study, we demonstrate that the Nem1–Spo7 complex is phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA), which is associated with active cell growth, metabolic activity, and membrane phospholipid synthesis. In vitro phosphorylation of purified Nem1–Spo7 and of their synthetic peptides revealed that both subunits of the phosphatase complex are PKA substrates. Using phosphoamino acid and phosphopeptide-mapping analyses coupled with site-directed mutagenesis, we identified Ser-140 and Ser-210 of Nem1 and Ser-28 of Spo7 as PKA-targeted phosphorylation sites. Immunodetection of the phosphatase complex from the cell with anti-PKA substrate antibody confirmed the in vivo phosphorylations of Nem1 and Spo7 on the serine residues. Lipid-labeling analysis of cells bearing phosphorylation-deficient alleles of NEM1 and SPO7 indicated that the PKA phosphorylation of the phosphatase complex stimulates phospholipid synthesis and attenuates the synthesis of triacylglycerol. This work advances the understanding of how PKA-mediated posttranslational modifications of Nem1 and Spo7 regulate lipid synthesis in yeast.

Estimates used to assess the economic burden of out-of-pocket (OOP) healthcare expenditure provide an underestimation for inpatient decedent cases. The aims of this paper are to study the trend and pattern of inpatient decedent expenditure and decipher the reasons behind the increasing cost in India.Using three rounds of national level National Sample Survey (NSS) data on morbidity & healthcare conducted during 1995-2015 in India, total and component-wise cost of dying was estimated by the socio-demographic characteristics and types of diseases. Generalised linear model was employed to find the changing effect of inpatient decedents on inpatient expenditure on three-time points.More than half among inpatient decedents were elderly. Mean inpatient expenditure for neoplasm, circulatory system-related diseases and external causes of mortality and morbidity increased substantially during these two decades. Mean decedent inpatient expenditure become double, diagnostic and bed charges increased by 243%, 323% respectively during 2004-05 to 2014-15. During 2014-15 average decedents aged 15-59 years spent ₹53599 in last twelve month of their life. Controlling all other potential factors, the inpatient expenditure among decedents increased substantially between 1995-96 and 2014-15.Out-of-pocket inpatient health expenditure widened between survivor and decedents in between 1995-2014. Increase in the proportion of elderly, proportion of non-communicable and lifestyle-related diseases, expenses on drugs, diagnostics, bed charges largely private sector expenses were the leading reasons for increasing inpatient decedent expenditure. Age-based risk adjustment and modification of end-of-life care are strongly required, future social insurance based on the health-based value of out-of-pocket expenditure rather than their pure consumption value need to be designed to tackle the burden."
https://openalex.org/W2891736260,"Aims The aims of this study were to determine the effects of four weeks of intermittent exposure to a moderate hypoxia environment (15% oxygen), and compare with the effects of exercise in normoxia or hypoxia, on glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, GLUT4 translocation, insulin receptor phosphorylation, Akt-dependent GSK3 phosphorylation and Akt activity in skeletal muscle of obese mice with type 2 diabetes. Methods C57BL/6J mice that developed type 2 diabetes with a high-fat-diet (55% fat) (fasting blood glucose, FBG = 13.9 ± 0.69 (SD) mmol/L) were randomly allocated into diabetic control (DC), rest in hypoxia (DH), exercise in normoxia (DE), and exercise in hypoxia (DHE) groups (n = 7, each), together with a normal-diet (4% fat) control group (NC, FBG = 9.1 ± 1.11 (SD) mmol/L). The exercise groups ran on a treadmill at intensities of 75–90% VO2max. The interventions were applied one hour per day, six days per week for four weeks. Venous blood samples were analysed for FBG, insulin (FBI) and insulin sensitivity (QUICKI) pre and post the intervention period. The quadriceps muscle samples were collected 72 hours post the last intervention session for analysis of GLUT4 translocation, insulin receptor phosphorylation, Akt expression and phosphorylated GSK3 fusion protein by western blot. Akt activity was determined by the ratio of the phosphorylated GSK3 fusion protein to the total Akt protein. Results The FBG of the DH, DE and DHE groups returned to normal level (FBG = 9.4 ± 1.50, 8.86 ± 0.94 and 9.0 ± 1.13 (SD) mmol/L for DH, DE and DHE respectively, P < 0.05), with improved insulin sensitivity compared to DC (P < 0.05), after the four weeks treatment, while the NC and DC showed no significant changes, as analysed by general linear model with repeated measures. All three interventions resulted in a significant increase of GLUT4 translocation to cell membrane compared to the DC group (P < 0.05). The DE and DH showed a similar level of insulin receptor phosphorylation compared with NC that was significantly lower than the DC (P < 0.05) post intervention. The DH and DHE groups showed a significantly higher Akt activity compared to the DE, DC and NC (P < 0.05) post intervention, as analysed by one-way ANOVA. Conclusions This study produced new evidence that intermittent exposure to mild hypoxia (0.15 FiO2) for four weeks resulted in normalisation of FBG, improvement in whole body insulin sensitivity, and a significant increase of GLUT4 translocation in the skeletal muscle, that were similar to the effects of exercise intervention during the same time period, in mice with diet-induced type 2 diabetes. However, exercise in hypoxia for four weeks did not have additive effects on these responses. The outcomes of the research may contribute to the development of effective, alternative and complementary interventions for management of hyperglycaemia and type 2 diabetes, particularly for individuals with limitations in participation of physical activity."

Despite its many benefits, there is a paucity of these studies among Nigerians being managed for mental illnesses. This study was aimed at assessing the economic burden of mental illnesses and its effect on household purchasing power. The study was descriptive cross-sectional in design conducted among 284 out-patients with five categories of mental illnesses at the Neuropsychiatric Hospital, Aro recruited via a systematic sampling technique. Data collection was quantitative using a semi-structured interviewer-administered tool. Participants provided the actual direct costs and estimates of indirect costs incurred during their most recent inpatient admission and their first clinic visit after discharge. Parametric and non-parametric statistical tests were conducted on the direct and estimated indirect costs respectively after testing them for normality using the Q-Q plot with statistical significance determined at p<0.05. Almost 96% of respondents finance their healthcare costs by themselves or their family with >50% earning <US$1.8 per day. Their mean direct and estimated indirect costs were (US$23.1±US$11.3 and US$15±US$28). There were no statistically significant differences in the mean direct and estimated indirect costs incurred by participants across the categories of mental illnesses. A significantly higher proportion of participants could afford the essential goods (88%) compared to those who could afford luxurious goods (29%) with p<0.001. The mean direct costs incurred by those who could afford the essential and luxurious goods were significantly higher than those who could not following a t-test. The median estimated indirect costs incurred by those who could not afford luxurious goods differed significantly from those who could with the Mann Whitney U-test. Participants with mental illnesses face a high economic burden in managing their condition with the majority unable to afford luxurious goods. Affordability was also associated with incurring more direct costs."
https://openalex.org/W2891221448,"Viruses have long been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity, yet their contribution remains circumstantial partly due to the lack of well-documented information on infections prior to autoimmune disease onset. Here, we used the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) as a model to mechanistically dissect the impact of viral infection on lupus-like autoimmunity. Virus persistence strongly enhanced disease in mice with otherwise weak genetic predisposition but not in highly predisposed or non-autoimmune mice, indicating a synergistic interplay between genetic susceptibility and virus infection. Moreover, endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) were both strictly required for disease acceleration, even though LCMV also induces strong TLR-independent type I interferon (IFN-I) production via RNA helicases and MAVS in conventional DCs. These results suggest that LCMV enhances systemic autoimmunity primarily by providing stimulatory nucleic acids for endosomal TLR engagement, whereas overstimulation of the MAVS-dependent cytosolic pathway in the absence of endosomal TLR signaling is insufficient for disease induction."

The modified spatial 2-back task includes congruent, incongruent, and lure conditions and participants are required to respond as rapidly and accurately as possible to the congruent stimuli but not to the incongruent and lure stimuli. The BD and non-BD groups exhibited comparable performances on the spatial 2-back task but the BD group showed significantly larger P3 amplitudes than the non-BD group. Additionally, the non-BD group showed larger P3 amplitudes in response to the congruent stimuli compared to the incongruent and lure stimuli whereas the P3 amplitudes in the BD group did not differ significantly among the three conditions. These results indicate that the BD individuals exerted greater effort to maintain performance levels comparable to non-BD individuals and that they were less efficient in differentiating or allocating attentional resources between relevant and irrelevant information."
https://openalex.org/W2890729954,"In this paper, we revisit the relationship between housing prices and consumption in China by using a continuous wavelet analysis. This method provides an insight into the dynamic nexus in both time and frequency domains. In general, Empirical results show that there is a positive relationship between the two series in China, although it varies across time and frequencies. First, we find that disposable income is the core factor which affects both consumption and housing prices in China. Second, housing prices have a weak wealth effect on consumption in most time. High housing ownership and proportion of housing asset in the total household asset lead to a wealth effect of housing prices on consumption. Third, in the long term, there is a significant wealth effect of housing prices on consumption, but it weakens after 2008, which implies that excessively high housing prices in recent years have partially constrained residents’ consumption. These findings have important implications for seeking housing market regulation and expanding domestic consumption decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2892242024,"The transformation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts plays a major role in fibrogenic responses during dermal wound healing. We show a contribution of calpain systems (intracellular regulatory protease systems) in vascular endothelial cells (ECs) to myofibroblast differentiation in wound sites. Dermal wound healing experiments in mice found that calpastatin (an endogenous inhibitor of calpains) is enriched in preexisting vessels but not in newly formed capillaries. Transgenic overexpression of calpastatin in ECs delayed wound healing in mice as well as reducing the keratinocyte layer, extracellular matrix deposition, and myofibroblast accumulation in wound sites. EC and leukocyte markers, however, remain unchanged. Calpastatin overexpression reduced the expression of genes encoding platelet-derived growth factor-B and PDGF receptor-β (PDGFR-β). Topical application of platelet-derived growth factor-BB–containing ointment to wounds accelerated healing in control mice, but calpastatin overexpression prevented this acceleration. In cultured human dermal fibroblasts, α-smooth muscle actin and PDGFR-β were up-regulated by coculturing with ECs, but this action was inhibited by suppression of EC calpain activity. EC-driven transformation of mouse dermal fibroblasts was also suppressed by calpastatin overexpression in ECs. These results suggest that endothelial calpain systems influence PDGFR-β signaling in fibroblasts, EC-driven myofibroblast differentiation, and subsequent fibrogenic responses in wounds.—Miyazaki, T., Haraguchi, S., Kim-Kaneyama, J.-R., Miyazaki, A.

However, adrenergic vasomotor control in venomous snakes such as Crotalus durissus terrificus and Bothrops jararaca has not yet been investigated. Crotalus and Bothrops aortic rings were mounted in an organ bath system. EFS-induced aortae contractions were performed in the presence and absence of guanethidine (30 μM), phentolamine (10 μM) or tetrodotoxin (1 μM). Frequency-induced contractions were also performed in aortae with endothelium removed. Immunohistochemical localization of both tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and S-100 protein in snake aortic rings and brains, as well as in human tissue (paraganglioma tumour) were carried out. EFS (4 to 16 Hz) induced frequency-dependent aortic contractions in both Crotalus and Bothrops. The EFS-induced contractions were significantly reduced in the presence of either guanethidine or phentolamine in both snakes (p<0.05), whereas tetrodotoxin had no effect in either. Removal of the endothelium abolished the EFS-induced contractions in both snakes aortae (p<0.05). Immunohistochemistry revealed TH localization in endothelium of both snake aortae and human vessels. Nerve fibers were not observed in either snake aortae. In contrast, both TH and S100 protein were observed in snake brains and human tissue. Vascular endothelium is the main source of catecholamine release in EFS-induced contractions in Crotalus and Bothrops aortae.

NaOCl was obtained from a stock solution with iodometric titration. Ultrapure water served as negative control. Samples were stirred at 37°C in aerobic and anaerobic conditions for 30min to approximate a clinically realistic time. Centrifugation was performed and the supernatants were collected and stored at -800 C until analysis. The reaction products were analysed in real time by selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) in triplicates. SIFT-MS analysis showed that the released VOCs included chlorinated hydrocarbons, particularly chloroform, together with unexpected higher levels of some nitrogenous compounds, especially acetonitrile. No difference was observed between aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The chemical interaction of NaOCl with NOM resulted in the formation of toxic chlorinated VOCs and DBPs.

https://openalex.org/W2890447071,"We describe dropdead1-1 (ded1), an EMS-induced recessive lesion mimic mutant of sorghum. It is characterized by the formation of spreading necrotic lesions that share many attributes with those associated with the maize lethal leaf spot1 (lls1) and Arabidopsis accelerated cell death1 (acd1) mutation. We show that as in lls1, ded1 lesions are initiated by wounding and require light for continued propagation, and that loss of chloroplast integrity is responsible for ded1 cell death. Consistent with these parallels, we demonstrate that ded1 is an ortholog of lls1 and encodes pheophorbide a oxidase (PaO) with 93% identity at the protein level. The mutant ded1 allele resulted from a stop codon-inducing single base pair change in exon 6 of the sorghum ortholog of lls1. The ded1 transcript was rapidly and transiently induced after wounding and substantially elevated in leaves containing ded1 lesions. Given that PaO is a key enzyme of the chlorophyll degradation pathway, its dysfunction would result in the accumulation of pheophorbide, a potent photosensitizer that results in the production of singlet oxygen. Consistent with this, cell death associated with ded1 lesions is most likely caused by singlet oxygen as our results exclude superoxide and H2O2 from this role. We explore the signal responsible for the propagation of lesions affecting both ded1 and lls1 lesions and find that both developmental age and ethylene increase the rate of lesion expansion in both mutants."

In our study we investigated whether epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) with a focus on Snail and Cathepsin L (Cat L), could potentially be two markers associated with prostate and breast health disparities. We have previously shown that Snail can increase Cat L protein and activity in prostate and breast cancer. Western blot and real-time PCR analyses showed that mesenchymal protein expression (Snail, vimentin, Cat L) and Cat L activity (shown by zymography) was higher in AA prostate cancer cells as compared to CA normal transformed RWPE-1 prostate epithelial cells, and androgen-dependent cells, and comparable to metastatic CA cell lines. With respect to breast cancer, mesenchymal markers were higher in TNBC compared to non-TNBC cells. The higher mesenchymal marker expression was functionally associated with higher proliferative and migratory rates. Immunohistochemistry showed that both nuclear Snail and Cat L expression was significantly higher in cancer compared to normal for CA and Bahamas prostate patient tissue. Interestingly, AA normal tissue stained higher for nuclear Snail and Cat L that was not significantly different to cancer tissue for both prostate and breast tissue, but was significantly higher than CA normal tissue. AA TNBC tissue also displayed significantly higher nuclear Snail expression compared to CA TNBC, while no significant differences were observed with Luminal A cancer tissue. Therefore, increased EMT in AA compared to CA that may contribute to the more aggressive disease."
https://openalex.org/W2889764406,"Cellular supply of deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) is crucial for DNA replication and repair. Thymidylate kinase (TMPK) catalyzes the conversion of thymidine monophosphate to thymidine diphosphate, which is an essential step for dTTP synthesis. Despite their major cellular localization in cytosol, TMPK and ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) are detected at DNA damage sites for local dNDP formation. Because deoxyuridine diphosphate is synthesized by RNR, the simultaneous recruitment of TMPK and RNR to DNA damage sites is critical for preventing deoxyuridine triphosphate–mediated toxic repair. This study investigates the mechanism responsible for the recruitment of TMPK to DNA damage sites. Our data demonstrate the requirement of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase activity for TMPK recruitment to DNA lesion sites. Moreover, we find that TMPK is able to form the complex with histone acetyltransferase Tip60 and RNR. Inhibition of ATM kinase reduces the complex formation and TMPK phosphorylation. Our analysis further shows the presence of TMPK phosphorylation at serine 88, which is an ATM kinase consensus site. A phosphorylation-defective mutation at this site suppresses TMPK recruitment to DNA damage sites and the complex formation with Tip60. Finally, we provide evidence that this site is critical for the function of TMPK in DNA repair but not for catalytic activity. Together, these findings suggest that Tip60-ATM signaling has a functional contribution to the recruitment of TMPK to DNA damage sites, thereby increasing local dTTP synthesis for DNA repair.—Hu, C.-M., Tsao, N., Wang, Y.-T., Chen, Y.-J., Chang, Z.-F.

https://openalex.org/W2891322794,"Romani people are a significant minority in Europe counting about 10 million individuals scattered throughout the continent. They are a migratory group originating from Northwestern India. Their exodus from India occurred approximately 1000-1500 years ago. The migration route of the Romani people was reconstructed with the help of cultural anthropology, linguistics and historical records. Their migration made them through Central Asia, Middle East and the Caucasus region, prior to the arriving into Europe. Yet the significance of these regions, especially of the Caucasus, in Roma ancestry was a rather neglected topic. Contribution of the Caucasus and further affected regions to the ancestry of Roma was investigated based on genome-wide autosomal marker data. 158 European Roma samples and 41 populations from the Caucasus region, from Middle East, Central Asia and from South Asia were considered in our tests. Population structure and ancestry analysis algorithms were applied to investigate the relationship of Roma with these populations. Identical by descent DNA segment analyses and admixture linkage disequilibrium based tests were also applied. Our results suggest that the Caucasus region plays also a significant role in the genetic legacy of Romani people besides the main sources, Europe and South Asia, previously investigated by other population genetic studies. The Middle East and Central Asia seems slightly less important but far from negligible in connection with the sources of Roma ancestry. Our results point out that the Caucasus region and altogether the area of the Caspian and Black Seas had a significant role in the migration of Romani people towards Europe and contributed significantly to the genetic legacy of Roma rival to the European and Indian main sources."
https://openalex.org/W2890175108,"Gastrulation is the initial systematic deformation of the embryo to form germ layers, which is characterized by the placement of appropriate cells in their destined locations. Thus, gastrulation, which occurs at the beginning of the second month of pregnancy, is a critical stage in human body formation. Although histological analyses indicate that human gastrulation is similar to that of other amniotes (birds and mammals), much of human gastrulation dynamics remain unresolved due to ethical and technical limitations. We used human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to study the migration of mesendodermal cells through the primitive streak to form discoidal germ layers during gastrulation. Immunostaining results showed that hiPSCs differentiated into mesendodermal cells and that epithelial–mesenchymal transition occurred through the activation of the Activin/Nodal and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways. Single-cell time-lapse imaging of cells adhered to cover glass showed that mesendodermal differentiation resulted in the dissociation of cells and an increase in their migration speed, thus confirming the occurrence of epithelial–mesenchymal transition. These results suggest that mesendodermal cells derived from hiPSCs may be used as a model system for studying migration during human gastrulation in vitro. Using random walk analysis, we found that random migration occurred for both undifferentiated hiPSCs and differentiated mesendodermal cells. Two-dimensional random walk simulation showed that homogeneous dissociation of particles may form a discoidal layer, suggesting that random migration might be suitable to effectively disperse cells homogeneously from the primitive streak to form discoidal germ layers during human gastrulation."
https://openalex.org/W2891640114,"Malaria is an infectious disease caused by parasites from the genus Plasmodium (P. falciparum and P. vivax are responsible for 90% of all clinical cases); it is widely distributed throughout the world’s tropical and subtropical regions. The P. vivax Pv12 protein is involved in invasion, is expressed on merozoite surface and has been recognised by antibodies from individuals exposed to the disease. In this study, B- and T-cell epitopes from Pv12 were predicted and characterised to advance in the design of a peptide-based vaccine against malaria. For evaluating the humoral response of individuals exposed to natural P. vivax infection from two endemic areas in Colombia, BepiPred-1.0 software was used for selecting B-cell epitopes. B-cell epitope 39038 displayed the greatest recognition by naturally-acquired antibodies and induced an IgG2/IgG4 response. NetMHCIIpan-3.1 prediction software was used for selecting peptides having high affinity binding for HLA-DRβ1* allele lineages and this was confirmed by in-vitro binding assays. T-epitopes 39113 and 39117 triggered a memory T-cell response (Stimulation Index≥2) and significant cytokine production. Combining in-silico, in-vitro and functional assays, two Pv12 protein regions (containing peptides 39038, 39040, 39113 and 39117) have thus been characterised as promising vaccine candidates against P. vivax malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2888877275,"The last decade has seen the emergence of new views about the mechanisms underlying specificity (or, conversely, generalization) of visual skill learning. Here, we trained participants at orientation discrimination paradigm at a peripheral position to induce position and orientation specificity and to test its underlying mechanisms. Specifically, we aimed to test whether the within-quadrant spatial gradient of generalization is determined by cortical magnification, which would show that retinotopic plasticity contributes to learning and specificity. Additionally, we aimed to test whether late parts of the learning relate differently to specificity compared to early parts. This is relevant in the context of double training papers, which suggest that rule-based mechanisms of specificity in fast, early learning also would apply to late, slower learning. Our data showed partial but significant position and orientation specificity within quadrants. Interestingly, specificity was greatest for those participants who had continued to show threshold decreases during the last five sessions of training (late, asymptotic learning). Performance gains during early learning were less related to specificity. A trend for skill to spread over larger distances towards periphery than towards central vision suggested contributions to transfer of early visual areas showing cortical magnification of central vision. Control experiments however did not support this hypothesis. In summary, our study demonstrates significant specificity after extensive perceptual learning, and indicates that asymptotic learning recruits specific mechanisms that promote specificity, and that may not be recruited yet in early parts of the learning. The contributions of different mechanisms to early and late learning suggests that following these different learning periods, generalization relies on different principles and is subjected to different limits."
https://openalex.org/W2891231063,"To investigate factors that influence maternal hCG concentration in early pregnancy and the relationship between hCG concentration in early pregnancy and basal FSH (bFSH) level.Retrospective cohort study.Reproductive medical center.In total, 482 women aged 22 to 38 years with elevated basal FSH (> 10 IU/L) and who experienced a single live birth after in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer were selected. These 482 women were age-matched with an equal number of women with normal basal FSH (≤10 IU/L) who also experienced a single live birth.None.HCG concentration.The hCG concentrations on Day 14 and Day 21 were 560.46 (363.63-842.52) IU/L and 9862.00 (6512.25-14029.50) IU/L, respectively, in the elevated bFSH group, and these values were significantly increased compared with the normal bFSH group. After adjusting for confounding factors, the concentrations of maternal hCG on Day 14 and Day 21 were significantly associated with basal FSH. In addition, crude linear regression analysis demonstrated that hCG concentrations increased as the basal serum levels of FSH increased.Elevated basal FSH has implications for the interpretation of hCG concentrations in early pregnancy after in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) that led to a single live birth."
https://openalex.org/W2891747553,"Spartina alterniflora, marsh grass, is a vegetative apomicticly-reproducing halophyte native to marshes along the east coast of the United States and invasive across the world. S. alterniflora provides many ecosystem services including, but not limited to, water filtration, habitats for invertebrates, and sediment retention. Widespread diebacks of longstanding marsh grass colonies launched extensive investigations into probable mechanisms leading to patchy diebacks. There is still current debate as to the causes of a marsh dieback but environmental stress is acknowledged as a constant. Spatial epigenetic variation could contribute to variation of stress susceptibility, but the scale and structure of epigenetic variation is unknown. The current study investigates patterns of epigenetic variation in a natural population of S. alterniflora. This study examines variation of global DNA methylation within and among clones of the marsh grass Spartina alterniflora using an ELISA-like microplate reaction and observed significant heterogeneity of global DNA methylation within and among clones of S. alterniflora across the North Inlet basin, as well as significant differences of global methylation between adults and sexually produced seedlings. The present study also characterized differences for plants in a section of the population that experienced an acute marsh dieback in the year 2001 and have subsequently recolonized, finding a significant positive correlation between cytosine methylation and time period of colonization. The significant heterogeneity of global DNA methylation both within and among clones observed within this natural population of S. alterniflora and potential impacts from hypersaline environments at North Inlet suggests the need for more in-depth epigenetic studies to fully understand DNA methylation within an ecological context. Future studies should consider the effects of varying saline conditions on both global DNA and gene specific methylation."
