https://openalex.org/W2001488773,"Economic choice is the behaviour observed when individuals select one among many available options. There is no intrinsically 'correct' answer: economic choice depends on subjective preferences. This behaviour is traditionally the object of economic analysis and is also of primary interest in psychology. However, the underlying mental processes and neuronal mechanisms are not well understood. Theories of human and animal choice have a cornerstone in the concept of 'value'. Consider, for example, a monkey offered one raisin versus one piece of apple: behavioural evidence suggests that the animal chooses by assigning values to the two options. But where and how values are represented in the brain is unclear. Here we show that, during economic choice, neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) encode the value of offered and chosen goods. Notably, OFC neurons encode value independently of visuospatial factors and motor responses. If a monkey chooses between A and B, neurons in the OFC encode the value of the two goods independently of whether A is presented on the right and B on the left, or vice versa. This trait distinguishes the OFC from other brain areas in which value modulates activity related to sensory or motor processes. Our results have broad implications for possible psychological models, suggesting that economic choice is essentially choice between goods rather than choice between actions. In this framework, neurons in the OFC seem to be a good candidate network for value assignment underlying economic choice."

To test the in vivo roles of TRPA1, we generated a mouse in which the essential exons required for proper function of the Trpa1 gene were deleted. Knockout mice display behavioral deficits in response to mustard oil, to cold (∼0° C), and to punctate mechanical stimuli. These mice have a normal startle reflex to loud noise, a normal sense of balance, a normal auditory brainstem response, and normal transduction currents in vestibular hair cells. TRPA1 is apparently not essential for hair-cell transduction but contributes to the transduction of mechanical, cold, and chemical stimuli in nociceptor sensory neurons.

TRPA1 is apparently not essential for hair-cell transduction but contributes to the transduction of mechanical, cold, and chemical stimuli in nociceptor sensory neurons. TRPA1 is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels. Originally identified as a protein overexpressed in liposarcoma cell lines (Jaquemar et al., 1999Jaquemar D. Schenker T. Trueb B. An ankyrin-like protein with transmembrane domains is specifically lost after oncogenic transformation of human fibroblasts.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7325-7333Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), TRPA1 (or ANKTM1) is similar to other TRP channels in having six putative transmembrane domains with a putative pore-forming helix between the fifth and sixth transmembrane domains (Clapham, 2003Clapham D.E. TRP channels as cellular sensors.Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar). Like many other TRPs, it has ankyrin repeats in the N-terminal region. However, TRPA1 is unique among mammalian TRPs in having as many as 17 ankyrin repeats. TRPN1 (or NOMPC), a proposed mechanosensory transducer in flies (Walker et al., 2000Walker R.G. Willingham A.T. Zuker C.S. A Drosophila mechanosensory transduction channel.Science. 2000; 287: 2229-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), has 29 ankyrin repeats but is present only in genomes of lower vertebrates and invertebrates. Interest in TRPA1 has come from a search for the molecular basis for several different senses. To identify the mechanically gated transduction channel of vertebrate hair cells, Corey et al., 2004Corey D.P. Garcia-Anoveros J. Holt J.R. Kwan K.Y. Lin S.Y. Vollrath M.A. Amalfitano A. Cheung E.L. Derfler B.H. Duggan A. et al.TRPA1 is a candidate for the mechanosensitive transduction channel of vertebrate hair cells.Nature. 2004; 432: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar used in situ hybridization to screen all mouse TRP channels for expression in the inner ear and found TRPA1 message in neonatal hair-cell sensory epithelia. TRPA1 mRNA in the utricle appeared during development at E16, the day before hair cells become mechanically responsive, and antibodies to TRPA1 labeled the tips of mouse and frog hair-cell stereocilia, the site of mechanotransduction. Zebrafish were found to have two TRPA genes, now denoted TRPA1a and TRPA1b. Morpholino knockdown of TRPA1a expression in zebrafish embryos decreased cytoplasmic loading of styryl dyes such as FM1-43, which pass through intact hair-cell transduction channels (Meyers et al., 2003Meyers J.R. MacDonald R.B. Duggan A. Lenzi D. Standaert D.G. Corwin J.T. Corey D.P. Lighting up the senses: FM1–43 loading of sensory cells through nonselective ion channels.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4054-4065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microphonic recordings from the inner ear, produced by the hair-cell transduction currents, were also reduced in zebrafish TRPA1a morphants. In mice, knockdown of TRPA1 expression in embryonic hair cells using two different small interfering RNAs largely abolished hair-cell transduction currents. Thus, TRPA1 was proposed as a candidate for the hair-cell transduction channel (Corey et al., 2004Corey D.P. Garcia-Anoveros J. Holt J.R. Kwan K.Y. Lin S.Y. Vollrath M.A. Amalfitano A. Cheung E.L.

TRPA1 has been implicated in pain sensation as well. It is activated by allyl isothiocyanate (mustard oil) and by other pungent chemicals including allicin (from garlic), cinnamaldehyde (cinnamon), methysalicylate (wintergreen), eugenol (cloves), and gingerol (ginger) (Jordt et al., 2004Jordt S.E.

TRPM8 is activated by cool temperatures and by chemicals such as menthol and icilin that feel cool when applied to the skin (McKemy et al., 2002McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D.

Because TRPM8 is activated below 23°C, which feels cool but not painfully cold (Morin and Bushnell, 1998Morin C. Bushnell M.C.

Bushnell M.C. Temporal and qualitative properties of cold pain and heat pain: a psychophysical study.Pain. 1998; 74: 67-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, TRPA1 was proposed to mediate the sensation of cold pain, an idea supported by reduced cold hyperalgesia with TRPA1 knockdown in vivo (Story et al., 2003Story G.M. Peier A.M. Reeve A.J.

However, Jordt et al., 2004Jordt S.E. Bautista D.M. Chuang H.H. McKemy D.D. Zygmunt P.M. Hogestatt E.D. Meng I.D. Julius D. Mustard oils and cannabinoids excite sensory nerve fibres through the TRP channel ANKTM1.Nature. 2004; 427: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar found that most mustard oil-responsive trigeminal ganglion neurons were not sensitive to cold (5°C), which may mean either that TRPA1 is not a cold pain sensor or that additional ion channels can be activated by mustard oil in trigeminal ganglia. The prolonged latency of activation by these pungent compounds, and by carbachol when TRPA1 is cotransfected with the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, suggest that TRPA1 channel opening can be mediated by second messengers. Moreover, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which binds to the CB1 receptor, also activates TRPA1 in a heterologous system, as does bradykinin, an inflammatory peptide acting through its G protein-coupled receptor, B2R (Jordt et al., 2004Jordt S.E.

These studies suggest that TRPA1 may be an intermediate where several different modalities converge to elicit pain, and that plants like mustard, garlic, and cinnamon have—for their protection—evolved chemicals that target this pathway. TRPA genes also occur in invertebrate genomes; there are four in Drosophila, for instance. The Drosophila homolog closest to TRPA1 is sensitive to heat above ∼27°C, and knockdown of dmTRPA1 abolishes thermotaxic behavior in fly larvae (Viswanath et al., 2003Viswanath V. Story G.M. Peier A.M. Petrus M.J. Lee V.M. Hwang S.W. Patapoutian A. Jegla T.

Patapoutian A. Garrity P.A. The Drosophila ortholog of vertebrate TRPA1 regulates thermotaxis.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Another Drosophila TRPA, dubbed painless, is expressed by polymodal nociceptors, is located in their branched sensory endings, and is involved in sensing both noxious hot temperatures (55°C) and intense mechanical stimuli (Tracey et al., 2003Tracey Jr., W.D. Wilson R.I. Laurent G. Benzer S. painless, a Drosophila gene essential for nociception.Cell. 2003; 113: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Thus, a common theme for TRPA1 function is nociception, but the specific sensory modalities in mammals, especially the sensation of noxious cold, remain controversial. To understand the role of TRPA1 in auditory and vestibular function as well as temperature, chemical, and mechanical sensation, we generated mice lacking a functional Trpa1 gene. Surprisingly, TRPA1 is not necessary for hair-cell transduction, but mice lacking TRPA1 have reduced sensitivity to mustard oil and bradykinin, as well as to painful cold and mechanical stimuli. We designed a targeting vector to delete in mice the exons encoding for the pore domain of TRPA1. The S5 and S6 transmembrane domains and the pore loop that contains the selectivity filter of TRPA1 were replaced with a cassette containing an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) with a human placental alkaline phosphatase gene (PLAP) and a polyadenylation sequence (Figures 1A and 1B). Deletion of the pore-forming region of TRPA1 renders the channel nonconducting, and the resulting mutant allele forms a bicistronic mRNA transcript containing the 5′ end of TRPA1 followed by an independently translated human placental alkaline phosphatase gene. Since a truncated product of the Trpa1 gene might still be produced and cause unwanted side effects, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal encoded by the amino acid sequence KDEL and a stop codon were placed in frame with the exon before the IRES PLAP cassette. Any potential truncated product of Trpa1 produced from the bicistronic transcript should be sequestered in the ER. Sequestration of the potential truncated TRPA1 fragment was confirmed by expressing the truncated fragment with the ER retention signal in human epithelial kidney (HEK) cells (data not shown). Transfection of the linearized targeting vector into murine embryonic stem (ES) cells resulted in the deletion of one of the Trpa1 alleles. Two independent ES cell lines carrying the targeted Trpa1 mutation were injected into blastocysts to generate germline chimeric males. Mating of male chimeras with C57Bl/6J or B6129PF2/J produced heterozygote animals that were subsequently intercrossed. Southern blot analysis of DNA from progeny of heterozygote matings shows that the mutant allele has properly recombined into the Trpa1 locus (Figure 1C). Matings of heterozygote animals resulted in a total of 227 animals with a ratio of 1.1:1.9:0.9 wild-type to heterozygote to mutant animals, a ratio close to the expected Mendelian ratio. To ensure that the transcript was no longer present in mutant animals, mRNA from DRGs was harvested from mice of each genotype. Amplification of the transcript by RT-PCR, in a region after the site of deletion, indicated that Trpa1 message was present in wild-type and heterozygote animals but absent in Trpa1−/− mice, suggesting that there was no functional TRPA1 protein in knockout animals (Figure 1D). Using primers that lie in the deletion site, quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that the Trpa1 transcript was absent in Trpa1−/− mice and was reduced by 50% in heterozygote animals (Figure S2 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). TRPA1 has been proposed as a candidate for the hair-cell transduction channel (Corey et al., 2004Corey D.P. Garcia-Anoveros J. Holt J.R. Kwan K.Y. Lin S.Y. Vollrath M.A. Amalfitano A. Cheung E.L. Derfler B.H. Duggan A. et al.TRPA1 is a candidate for the mechanosensitive transduction channel of vertebrate hair cells.Nature. 2004; 432: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). We asked whether Trpa1−/− mice exhibit hearing and balance defects, if hair cells in Trpa1−/− mice contain functional transduction channels, and—if so—if the properties of transduction and adaptation are altered relative to wild-type mice. Adult wild-type and Trpa1−/− mice displayed a normal Preyer reflex, flicking their ears when startled with a loud sound, suggesting that auditory function was normal. Trpa1−/− mice swam normally, could maintain balance on a rotating rod, and could walk along the top of a thin wall, indicating normal vestibular function (data not shown). To evaluate the function of the cochlea at different auditory frequencies, we measured auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) of wild-type, heterozygous, and Trpa1−/− mice, evoked with short tone pips. The overall ABR thresholds were nearly identical at all frequencies from 4 to 45.3 kHz, differing only at 32 kHz, where if anything the Trpa1−/− mice were more sensitive (Figure 2A). (A) Auditory brainstem-evoked response. Thresholds were measured for 5 ms tone pips of frequencies from 4 to 45 kHz. Knockout mice hear normally. Mean ± SEM; n = 10 (+/+), n = 8 (+/−), n = 9 (−/−). (B) AM1-43 accumulation in heterozygote cochlea and utricle. Organs were incubated in 5 μM AM1-43 for 2 min, then washed and fixed. Hair cells with functional transduction channels are labeled with this procedure. Phalloidin labeling of actin revealed hair bundles. Nearly all cells were labeled in wild-type cochleas and utricles. Scale bar is 10 μm. (C) AM1-43 accumulation in knockout cochleas and utricles. Nearly all cells were labeled. (D) Transduction currents (left) and the measured activation curve (right) in a heterozygote utricular hair cell. The stimulus is shown above the currents. Transduction and adaptation are typical for this preparation. (E) Transduction currents and activation curve in a knockout utricular hair cell. Adaptation was faster and the activation curve steeper in this cell than in wild-type cells, but on average knockout hair cells were normal (Table 1). (F) Adaptation to a maintained positive deflection in a knockout hair cell, measured as a shift of the activation curve. Responses to test steps presented before (filled squares) and at the end (open circles) of a 0.24 μm, 120 ms adapting step were fitted with a three-state Boltzmann relation (Equation 2). The activation curve shifted by 0.18 μm, so extent was 75%. Adaptation appears normal. (G) Adaptation to a maintained negative deflection in a knockout hair cell. Adaptation appears normal. The fluorescent styryl dyes, FM1-43 and its fixable analog AM1-43, rapidly enter hair cells through their transduction channels, offering a simple test of functional transduction (Gale et al., 2001Gale J.E. Marcotti W. Kennedy H.J. Kros C.J. Richardson G.P. FM1-43 dye behaves as a permeant blocker of the hair-cell mechanotransducer channel.J.

Lighting up the senses: FM1–43 loading of sensory cells through nonselective ion channels.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4054-4065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We dissected cochleas and utricles from wild-type, heterozygous, and Trpa1−/− mice and bathed them for 2 min in dye before washing, fixing, and colabeling for actin. By this measure, most hair cells possessed functional transduction channels, in both cochleas and utricles of both mutant and wild-type mice (Figures 2B and 2C). We could not detect a difference in AM1-43 loading between the different genotypes. The best measure of transduction channel function is single-cell recording of currents elicited with calibrated deflection of hair bundles. We measured whole-cell transduction currents in mouse utricular hair cells from Trpa1−/− and Trpa1+/− littermate mice, aged P2 to P6, with genotype unknown to the experimenter. The properties of transduction and adaptation did not differ significantly between Trpa1−/− and Trpa1+/− hair cells (Figures 2D and 2E), and were similar to those reported previously for wild-type mice (Vollrath and Eatock, 2003Vollrath M.A. Eatock R.A. Time course and extent of mechanotransducer adaptation in mouse utricular hair cells: comparison with frog saccular hair cells.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 2676-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The average maximal transduction current, Imax, for ten Trpa1−/− and five Trpa1+/− hair cells was 129 ± 18 and 131 ± 27 pA, respectively. Other measures of transduction and adaptation (resting open probability, operating range, time constant of decay, and extent of adaptation at steady state; Table 1) were normal. A rebound at the termination of negative deflections (Figure 2E) suggested that climbing adaptation to negative steps was normal. To assess adaptation more completely, we presented a series of test deflections before and during an adapting step and measured the resulting shift of the activation curve. Trpa1−/− hair cells had normal adaptation in response to both positive and negative adapting steps (Figures 2F and 2G). Taken together, these data suggest that hair cells in Trpa1−/− mice are normal. We cannot rule out more subtle defects. Values are mean ± SE. P0 is percent of current activated at rest; operating range is 10%–90% of Imax; τA is adaptation time constant measured from current decay for a half-maximal displacement; extent of adaptation measured from curve fitted to decay.

Mice were allowed access to water for 3 hr/day, and water consumption was measured. No significant difference in normal water consumption was found among wild-type, heterozygote, and Trpa1−/− mice. After several days, mustard oil was added to the water in different concentrations. At the highest concentration, 100 mM, wild-type, and heterozygote mice would not drink the water at all, whereas Trpa1−/− mice consumed over a third of the normal amount (Figure 3A). Because mustard oil might also activate other channels expressed by trigeminal nociceptors, we tried lower concentrations. At all concentrations, Trpa1−/− mice consumed more mustard oil-containing water than did wild-type mice, and heterozygote animals displayed an intermediate phenotype (Figure 3B). Olfactory receptors may also contribute to the perception of mustard oil in this test. Therefore, we injected 20 μl of a 75 mM mustard oil solution into the plantar surface of a hind paw and recorded the amount of time the mouse spent licking, flinching, or flicking the affected paw. Trpa1−/− mice demonstrated a decrease in this pain behavior compared to their wild-type counterparts (Figure 3C). Injection of a mineral oil control did not elicit a significant behavioral response from the animals. As in the oral sensitivity test, heterozygote mice had an intermediate phenotype, suggesting a gene dosage effect. Because Trpa1−/− mice showed some avoidance of mustard oil-containing water, we asked whether TRPA1 is the sole mediator of mustard oil sensitivity of DRG neurons. We cultured dissociated cells from wild-type and mutant DRGs and loaded them with Fluo-4 to detect Ca2+ entry upon chemical stimulation. TRPA1 is expressed in a subset of TRPV1-expressing DRG neurons in the mouse (Kobayashi et al., 2005Kobayashi K. Fukuoka T. Obata K. Yamanaka H. Dai Y. Tokunaga A. Noguchi K. Distinct expression of TRPM8, TRPA1, and TRPV1 mRNAs in rat primary afferent neurons with adelta/c-fibers and colocalization with trk receptors.J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 493: 596-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). To identify TRPV1-expressing cells, capsaicin (3 μM) was applied to DRG cultures first. In wild-type mice, 31% ± 4% of cells (mean ± SEM; n = 12) responded to capsaicin with a rise in Ca2+ fluorescence, and 25% ± 5% responded to capsaicin in Trpa1−/− mice, which was not significantly different (Figures 3E–3G). We applied mustard oil (10 μM) 80 s later. The number of mustard oil-sensitive cells was significantly lower in knockouts (wild-type, 23% ± 4%; knockout, 12.5% ± 2.5%; p < 0.01; Figures 3E–3G). Moreover, there were almost no cells responding to both drugs in the knockout (wild-type, 13% ± 2%; knockout, 0.7 ± 0.3%; Figure 3G). Thus, there are still mustard oil-sensitive cells in Trpa1−/− mice (Figure 3F), but these are not the TRPV1-expressing cells where most TRPA1 is expressed. The remaining response to mustard oil is apparently mediated by another receptor expressed in other neurons. To study the involvement of TRPA1 in sensing noxious temperatures, animals of all three genotypes were subjected to hot temperatures known to elicit a nociceptive behavioral response. We placed mice on a hot plate at 50°C, 52°C, or 55°C, temperatures in the high range for TRPV1 and TRPV2 (Patapoutian et al., 2003Patapoutian A. Peier A.M. Story G.M. Viswanath V. ThermoTRP channels and beyond: mechanisms of temperature sensation.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), and recorded the latency to initial nocifensive behavior. As the temperature was increased, the latency decreased, but there were no observable differences between the Trpa1+/+, Trpa1+/−, and Trpa1−/− animals (Figure 4A). Although no difference was expected, this indicates that pain avoidance mechanisms are intact in Trpa1−/− mice. (A) Hotplate. Mice were placed on a hotplate maintained at 50°C, 52°C, or 56°C, and the time before a hind paw was lifted was measured. There was no significant difference in latency between knockout, heterozygote and wild-type mice, but all showed decreasing latency with increasing temperature.

A Peltier cooler was used to generate a cold surface maintained at 0°C ± 1°C, which is substantially below the apparent threshold of ∼10°C for cold pain in rats (Allchorne et al., 2005Allchorne A.J.

A mouse was placed on the plate, and the number of paw withdrawal responses during 5 min was used as an integrated index of the nociceptive response to cold (Figure 4B). Trpa1−/− animals were significantly less responsive to noxious cold than their wild-type and heterozygote littermates (p < 0.0004). We also applied a drop of acetone to the dorsolateral surface of a hind paw to cause evaporative cooling, which evokes a brief period of shaking and elevation of the paw in mice (Carlton et al., 1994Carlton S.M.

Our results suggest that individual branches can function as single integrative compartments. The transformation of synaptic input into specific patterns of action potential (AP) output is perhaps the single most important function of central neurons. In most neurons, the input received from thousands of synaptic inputs is combined and transformed into a wide variety of voltage signals within extraordinarily complicated dendritic arborizations. These dendritic voltage signals, ranging from summated compound EPSPs to brief or prolonged dendritic spikes, are capable of evoking very different patterns of AP output. In fact, depending upon the specific form of dendritic integration, neuronal output can range from single precise APs to trains or bursts of multiple APs (Ariav et al., 2003Ariav G. Polsky A.

In spite of the central role played by dendritic integration in neuronal function, a thorough understanding of the integrative properties of most dendrites is lacking. This deficiency stems, by and large, from the poor accessibility of the majority of dendritic regions. In general, the arbors of most pyramidal neurons can be separated into two broad morphological categories. The first of these is an apical trunk that is usually quite long (100s μm) with an initially wide but tapering diameter (∼5 μm down to ∼1 μm). The accessibility of these regions has allowed their integrative properties to be directly determined in some detail (Gasparini et al., 2004Gasparini S. Migliore M. Magee J.C.

Although the large diameter trunk regions have been comparatively well characterized over the past decade or so, this region represents only a small fraction of the overall dendritic arborization. Indeed, the vast majority of most arbors (∼95%) are composed of fairly short (∼100 μm) and thin (∼0.5 μm) terminal dendrites that branch off the trunk or soma (radial oblique, apical tuft, and basal branches; Bannister and Larkman, 1995aBannister N.J.

Unfortunately, the relative inaccessibility of these important small branches has left their integrative properties incompletely characterized. What is known about the small, terminal branches of hippocampal and neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons is that they can integrate synaptic input in either an essentially linear or nonlinear (local spiking) manner (Ariav et al., 2003Ariav G.

Compartmentalized and binary behavior of terminal dendrites in hippocampal pyramidal neurons.Science. 2001; 293: 2272-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). What is not known is how the spatiotemporal pattern of synaptic input determines which form of integration (linear or nonlinear) is to be engaged, or what ionic mechanisms underlie the generation of the local branch spikes that are responsible for nonlinear dendritic integration. Also, it is presently unclear whether individual terminal branches represent single or multiple integrative compartments or units. To address these issues, we have used multisite two-photon glutamate uncaging along with simultaneous two-photon Ca2+ imaging and somatic whole-cell voltage recording to directly investigate the integrative properties of radial oblique dendrites in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. To explore how the temporal pattern of incoming synaptic input affects dendritic integration in radial oblique dendrites, we measured the summation of uncaging-evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (gluEPSPs) evoked by multisite uncaging with different interstimulus intervals on 7 to 20 spines that covered ∼20 μm of an oblique branch. (0.1, 1, 2–5 ms; see Figures 1A–1E and Experimental Procedures). The most synchronous input pattern (0.1 ms interval, all input within 3 ms) almost always produced somatic voltage responses that increased in a sigmoid fashion with a disproportional increase in depolarization occurring at one particular input level (see Figures 1F and 1G). Several pieces of evidence indicate that this nonlinear integration pattern was the result of dendritic spike generation within the radial oblique branch. First, the putative dendritic spikes were generally observed at the soma as an initial fast component in the rising phase of the gluEPSP (“fast” in Figure 1F; mean amplitude and time to peak: 2.2 ± 0.2 mV and 1.3 ± 0.1 ms; n = 92 branches in 77 cells) just as has been observed for weakly propagating apical trunk spikes (Golding and Spruston, 1998Golding N.L. Spruston N. Dendritic sodium spikes are variable triggers of axonal action potentials in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.Neuron. 1998; 21: 1189-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, Gasparini et al., 2004Gasparini S. Migliore M. Magee J.C. On the initiation and propagation of dendritic spikes in CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 11046-11056Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Second, this fast component of the gluEPSP was associated with a step increase in the peak temporal derivative of somatic voltage responses at the threshold input level (δV/δt: 2.6 ± 0.4 V/s; n = 92; Figures 1H and 1L) and finally, as expanded on below, was simultaneous with a step increase in the branch Ca2+ signal (see “Local Ca2+ Signals” section). Because dendritic spike initiation was associated with a sharp increase in the corresponding rate of rise of the somatic voltage responses, we could operationally define the upper limit of the threshold for dendritic spike initiation as an expected somatic depolarization at which this step-like δV/δt increase occurs (Figures 1H, 1L, and 1M; somatic Vm = −65 ± 0.7 mV; n = 100 recordings). Using this method, we found that the mean voltage threshold for all recordings with a dendritic spike present was 3.4 ± 0.2 mV, measured at the soma (Figure 1M; n = 92). The fast gluEPSP component was followed by a more slowly rising component with a mean time to peak of 13.5 ± 0.2 ms (n = 92; “slow” in Figure 1F), during which the gluEPSP usually reached its peak amplitude (the exception was for the most proximal input locations, where the peak amplitude was occasionally reached during the fast component). The gluEPSPs usually decayed in a monotonic fashion with a decay time constant of 39 ± 1 ms (n = 92). To quantify the degree of nonlinearities associated with the fast and slow spike components across the population, we aligned the individual input-output curves to threshold and calculated the mean “threshold” and “suprathreshold” nonlinearity (see Experimental Procedures). On average, the amount of depolarization actually observed at this “threshold” level of input was 142% ± 9% (n = 92; Figure 1M) of the predicted linear average, and this degree of supralinearity did not increase significantly as additional input was delivered (suprathreshold nonlinearity: 129% ± 6%; n = 92; Figure 1M). A different input-output profile was observed for asynchronous inputs onto oblique branches. When the same or greater amounts of input were delivered as asynchronous input patterns to the same spines (2–5 ms uncaging interval, all input within 50 ms; Figures 1I–1K), there were never any indications of dendritic spike generation (Figures 1J–1L; n = 23 branches in 22 cells), and the level of somatic depolarization increased linearly with increased input (104% ± 8%; n = 23; Figure 1M). This lack of dendritic spiking during asynchronous inputs is unlikely to be the simple result of a reduced amount of branch depolarization because the elevated amounts of input (up to four times the synchronous input in Figures 1I–1K) will more than compensate for the relatively lower level of temporal summation found during asynchronous input patterns. The extremely synchronous (all input within 3 ms) or asynchronous (all input within 50 ms) input patterns used above demonstrate the two distinct forms of dendritic integration that oblique branches are capable of performing. More intermediate temporal patterns (all input within 10 ms) could be used to estimate the time window over which input was required to arrive in order to switch between the linear and nonlinear integration modes (Figure 2). When input was given with a 1 ms interval, the form of integration was dependent on the rate of depolarization (i.e., the amplitude of the individual inputs). For this temporal pattern, depolarizations that reached local spike threshold within ∼6 ms (i.e., branches reaching threshold by the 6th input; see individual recording in Figure 2A and summary in Figures 2C and 2D; n = 9 branches in 8 cells) were synchronous enough to produce a dendritic spike and a supralinear summation. On the other hand, input that produced similar or even greater levels of total depolarization but with a lower slope (>6 ms or >6 inputs to reach local threshold; see individual recording in Figure 2B and summary in Figures 2C and 2D; n = 12 branches in 10 cells) did not produce a dendritic spike and summed linearly. These results are similar to that reported for the distal apical trunk where the voltage threshold for local spike generation is highly dependent on the rate of membrane potential depolarization (threshold increases as δV/δt decreases; Gasparini et al., 2004Gasparini S. Migliore M. Magee J.C. On the initiation and propagation of dendritic spikes in CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 11046-11056Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The data from radial oblique branches indicate that the time window over which a suprathreshold amount of input must arrive is ∼6 ms, which is approximately 2-fold broader than the spike time window for the main apical trunk (∼3 ms; Gasparini et al., 2004Gasparini S. Migliore M. Magee J.C. On the initiation and propagation of dendritic spikes in CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 11046-11056Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In spite of these regional variations, it remains that only very synchronous input patterns can provide the rapid membrane depolarization required by the dendritic spiking mechanisms of CA1 pyramidal neurons. We next wanted to quantify the minimum number of synchronously active synaptic inputs required to shift the integration mode. For this we first need to determine the amount of depolarization required for oblique spike generation. As stated above, the mean threshold depolarization for all branch input locations was 3.4 ± 0.2 mV. However, a closer examination of the data revealed that the amount of somatic depolarization required for dendritic spike generation varied as a function of distance from the branch point (Figures 3A–3E; 4.5 ± 0.5 mV to 2.4 ± 0.4 mV from proximal to distal within single branches, n = 8; and 4.5 ± 0.4 mV to 2.6 ± 0.2 mV, for proximal [5–50 μm; mean: 33 ± 7 μm; n = 33] and distal [60–126 μm; mean: 81 ± 7 μm; n = 44] populations; p < 0.005, respectively). The amplitude of the individual gluEPSPs was adjusted accordingly to maintain a constant number of subthreshold uncaging events (proximal: 4.4 ± 0.3 inputs, n = 33; distal: 4.1 ± 0.3 inputs, n = 44; p > 0.05). The change in measured voltage threshold is, nevertheless, very similar to the amount of filtering experienced by unitary gluEPSPs (∼2-fold amplitude and rise time filter; Figures 3F and 3G, Experimental Procedures, and Figures S1A–S1C) along a 60–80 μm segment of the obliques. These data suggest that the local voltage threshold for branch spike generation is relatively uniform within the oblique tree and that the observed difference is simply due to the filtering experienced by the underlying gluEPSP. This is further supported by pharmacological data presented below (see “Transient Outward Currents in Oblique Branch Integration” section). The next step is to transform the somatic threshold voltage into an approximate minimum number of active synapses required to reach dendritic spike threshold. Because subthreshold summation is linear (see Figure 1, Figure 2), this can be accomplished with some degree of certainty for the proximal part of the oblique tree simply by dividing the mean dendritic spike threshold recorded for this region by the mean miniature excitatory postsynaptic potential (mEPSP) amplitude of the same location (see Experimental Procedures and Figures S1E–S1G). In this part of the branch, the mean amplitudes of the somatically measured mEPSP and dendritic spike threshold were 0.27 mV and 4.5 mV, respectively. Based on these data, a minimum of 17 inputs are required to reach local spike threshold. This is a minimum number because mean mEPSP amplitude for the proximal regions is likely to be actually somewhat smaller. Dual recordings from CA1 neurons show that distal apical trunk mEPSP mean amplitude appears ∼20% larger at the soma because of the loss of small amplitude events into the noise (Magee and Cook, 2000Magee J.C. Cook E.P. Somatic EPSP amplitude is independent of synapse location in hippocampal pyramidal neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Thus, if we correct the mean proximal oblique mEPSP amplitude by this factor (20%), the threshold number becomes 21 inputs. Therefore, the data suggest that ∼20 average-sized synaptic inputs must arrive onto an oblique branch within ∼6 ms to initiate a local branch spike and shift the integration mode from linear to nonlinear. This number of synapses is considerably lower than that calculated for the distal apical trunk region (∼40), again suggesting that spiking conditions are more favorable in the radial oblique branches (Gasparini et al., 2004Gasparini S. Migliore M. Magee J.C. On the initiation and propagation of dendritic spikes in CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 11046-11056Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, Gasparini and Magee, 2006Gasparini S. Magee J.C. Input pattern dependent dendritic computation in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2088-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Although the above data support the idea of a uniform voltage threshold within a branch, it may not follow that the number of inputs required to reach local spike threshold is likewise uniform. Indeed, branch morphology should theoretically cause the local unitary EPSP amplitude to increase with distance out the branch (Golding et al., 2005Golding N.L. Mickus T.J. Katz Y. Kath W.L. Spruston N. Factors mediating powerful voltage attenuation along CA1 pyramidal neuron dendrites.J. Physiol. 2005; 568: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, Stuart and Spruston, 1998Stuart G. Spruston N. Determinants of voltage attenuation in neocortical pyramidal neuron dendrites.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3501-3510PubMed Google Scholar). If no compensatory mechanism exists, the number of inputs should, therefore, decrease with distance. Finally, until now we have, for technical reasons (see Experimental Procedures), examined the effect of synchronous input to oblique branches by uncaging glutamate onto seven to ten spines (mean unitary gluEPSP amplitude: 0.73 ± 0.04 mV; n = 96). Since, as we have just observed, approximately 20 average Schaffer collateral synapses are required for local dendritic spike generation, and the temporal window for this initiation is somewhat expanded (∼6 ms), we decided to give input patterns using 20 input spines to determine if the size of the unitary gluEPSP might affect any of the dendritic spike properties thus far reported (Figures 3H–3M). We found, however, that delivering synchronous patterns over 20 spines (i.e., with a 3-fold smaller mean unitary gluEPSP amplitude: 0.21 ± 0.02 mV; n = 26; all input within 6 ms) did not significantly alter any aspect of local branch spiking as the threshold voltage (3.3 ± 0.3 mV; n = 26 branches in 14 cells; p > 0.05), the amount of nonlinearity associated with the spike (threshold nonlinearity: 144% ± 10%; p > 0.05), the suprathreshold nonlinearity (139% ± 7%; p > 0.05) and all other features of the gluEPSPs (i.e., spike amplitude: 1.9 ± 0.3 mV; spike δV/δt: 2.3 ± 0.5 V/s; p > 0.05, and the presence of a slow rise phase component) all remained the same as reported above. What fraction of the available Schaffer collateral synapse population are 20 synapses? To answer this question, we must know the spatial extent of compartmentalization in these branches. Does all input have to be tightly clustered within 20 μm (20 synapses represents ∼30% of all synapses within 20 μm), or can the input be spread across the entire branch (∼5% of the total number of 300 to 400 synapses on a single branch; Megias et al., 2001Megias M. Emri Z. Freund T.F. Gulyas A.I. Total number and distribution of inhibitory and excitatory synapses on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells.Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar)? The impact of spatial input pattern on branch integration is also a good indication of a single oblique branch's ability to function as a single integrative compartment. To examine this, we have directly determined the impact of spatial input pattern on local branch spiking by comparing the responses produced by a synchronous input pattern (0.1 ms) delivered onto spines randomly covering approximately 67% of a single oblique (average: 62 ± 2 μm; n = 15 branches in 13 cells; Figure 4) with that evoked by a spatially clustered (<20 μm) input onto the same branch (see individual recording on Figures 4A–4C and summary on Figures 4D and 4E). The data show that input patterns spatially distributed across a single oblique branch are as capable of producing a dendritic spike as are spatially clustered inputs. Moreover, the degree of nonlinearity (at threshold: 144% ± 15%; at suprathreshold: 127% ± 8%) as well as the basic properties of the evoked spikes (mean amplitude: 2.6 ± 0.6 mV; δV/δt: 2.7 ± 0.8 V/s; threshold: 3.1 ± 0.3 mV; Figure 4E) were all similar to that of the population of spikes evoked by clustered input. Interestingly, the data suggest that the dendritic spike was initiated at a location somewhere near the middle of the input pattern, which for a distributed pattern would also be near the middle of the branch. In five recordings, where proximal and/or distal clustered inputs were tested on the same branch, the amplitude and rate of rise of dendritic spikes produced by distributed inputs fell between those evoked by either proximal or distal clustered inputs (mean spike δV/δt and amplitude for distributed input: 1.4 ± 0.3 V/s, 1.6 ± 0.2 mV, n = 5; for proximal clustered input: 1.6 ± 0.3 V/s, 2.0 ± 0.4 mV, n = 3; for distal clustered input: 0.9 ± 0.3 V/s, 1.1 ± 0.1 mV, n = 5). This result is expected because the maximum rate of depolarization will be near the middle of a perfectly distributed spatial input pattern. That the local spikes appear to initiate near the middle of the input pattern, even though the input is spread across nearly the entire branch, further supports the idea that all branch input is similarly effective in initiating local spikes. Together, these findings demonstrate that oblique branches can be single integrative compartments that summate without regard to the spatial distribution of the input within the branch. Furthermore, the level of synchronous input required to shift from linear to supralinear integration represents ∼5% of the total excitatory input to a branch. During the next series of experiments, we used multisite glutamate uncaging along with simultaneous two-photon Ca2+ imaging to investigate the properties of input-associated local Ca2+ signals. In this case, the central part of the parent dendritic shaft within the cluster of uncaging locations was line scanned (Figures 5A and 5B). Typically, the presentation of a synchronous input pattern produced Ca2+ signals that mirrored the voltage responses with which they were associated. That is, they initially increased in a linear fashion (Figures 5C and 5D; 0.1 ms: 24% ± 6% ΔF/F/mV; n = 57 branches in 51 cells; see red dashed line in Figure 5C) until a certain input level where a step increase in the signal was observed (Figures 5C and 5D; 81% ± 7% ΔF/F; n = 57), after which they continued to increase linearly with more input. The step increase in the Ca2+ signal always occurred at the same input level as the dendritic spike (Figure 5C). Thus, there were two components to the Ca2+ signals associated with synchronous input; the first was a relatively linear “background” increase onto which a spike-associated step increase in Ca2+ influx was superimposed. Likewise, the linear voltage summation produced by asynchronous temporal patterns resulted in an essentially linear summation of local Ca2+ signals (Figures 5B and 5C) that was very similar to the average slope of the subthreshold Ca2+ signals evoked by a synchronous input pattern (5 ms: 27% ± 1% ΔF/F/mV; n = 16 branches in 16 cells).

Asynchronous input (5 ms) does not produce a step increase in either the δV/δt or Ca2+ signal; instead the Ca2+ transient plotted versus expected somatic voltage shows an essentially linear relationship. Red dashed lines represent the slope of the peak amplitude of local Ca2+ signals evoked by subthreshold gluEPSPs (0.1 ms).

This Ca2+ signaling profile was quite invariant, as similar dendritic spike-associated local Ca2+ signals were observed even if different spines within the ∼20 μm input region were chosen for uncaging locations (Figures S2A–S2C). Furthermore, the peak amplitude of spike Ca2+ transients was relatively constant as the uncaging cluster was moved to different regions of the oblique branches (Figures 5E–5G; proximal: 85% ± 9% ΔF/F, 0–50 μm, n = 28; distal: 78% ± 9% ΔF/F, 60–120 μm, n = 29). Together, these data suggest that oblique branch dendritic spikes have similar properties (local amplitude and duration) regardless of the specific spines receiving the input or of their specific site of initiation within the branch. This is similar to what was seen for apical trunk spikes where the local amplitude of the dendritic spike was constant across an approximately 150 μm range of apical trunk initiation sites (Gasparini and Magee, 2006Gasparini S. Magee J.C. Input pattern dependent dendritic computation in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2088-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Ca2+ signals measured within the input site are likely to be comprised of both a spike-related influx and a diffusion-related component due to the Ca2+ influx through NMDARs located in spines (Majewska et al., 2000Majewska A. Brown E. Ross J. Yuste R. Mechanisms of calcium decay kinetics in hippocampal spines: role of spine calcium pumps and calcium diffusion through the spine neck in biochemical compartmentalization.J.

Thus, we recorded Ca2+ transients outside, but in near proximity to the uncaging input sites (Figures 6A and 6B; 22 ± 1 μm distal to the input; n = 10 branches in 8 cells).

Although constituent neurons have been studied physiologically, their embryological origins and molecular profiles remain obscure. Applying intersectional and subtractive genetic fate mapping approaches, we show that this complex develops modularly from genetically separable progenitor populations arrayed as rostrocaudal microdomains within and outside the hindbrain (lower) rhombic lip (LRL). The dorsal CN subdivision, structurally and topographically similar to the cerebellum, arises from microdomains unexpectedly caudal and noncontiguous to cerebellar primordium; ventral CN subdivisions arise from more rostral LRL. Magnocellular regions receive contributions from LRL and coaxial non-lip progenitors; contrastingly, ensheathing granule cells derive principally from LRL. Also LRL-derived and molecularly similar to CN granule cells are precerebellar mossy fiber neurons; surprisingly, these ostensibly intertwined populations have separable origins and adjacent but segregated migratory streams.

Essential to normal sound recognition is the proper development of the auditory processing centers in the peripheral and central nervous systems. All auditory information, relayed by spiral ganglion neurons of the inner ear, coalesces in a tonotopic distribution upon the hindbrain neuronal densities known as the cochlear nuclei (reviewed in Ryugo and Parks, 2003Ryugo D.K. Parks T.N. Primary innervation of the avian and mammalian cochlear nucleus.Brain Res. Bull. 2003; 60: 435-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This critical complex has been studied extensively with respect to its diverse neuronal cell types, its unique synaptic morphologies and circuitries, and its physiological role in auditory processing (reviewed in Cant, 1992Cant N.B.

In this study, we apply in mice an intersectional and subtractive genetic fate mapping approach toward addressing these fundamentals. Genetic fate mapping strategies in mice involving site-specific recombinases have proven to be of great value to the developmental neurobiologist, complementing and extending other more classical lineage and grafting methods that have been employed largely in avian systems. Because genetic fate maps delineate adult structures and cell types arising from molecularly defined subsets of embryonic cells, they not only inform developmental processes but also guide analyses of mouse mutants. The impact of these approaches is evidenced by a set of recent studies directed at cerebellar and brainstem development (Awatramani et al., 2003Awatramani R. Soriano P. Rodriguez C. Mai J.J.

Despite the molecular precision afforded by genetic fate maps, many biological questions remain unanswerable because of the broad extent of cell types marked even by a single gene expression domain. Embryonic gene expression domains commonly restrict along one tissue axis but extend along the orthogonal axes, such that a given gene expression domain actually includes a substantial swathe of varied cell populations. Especially constrained by this property have been studies of the hindbrain (lower) rhombic lip (LRL)—a specialized germinal zone productive of long-distance, tangentially migrating neurons (Altman and Bayer, 1996Altman J.

Math1 expression redefines the rhombic lip derivatives and reveals novel lineages within the brainstem and cerebellum.Neuron. 2005; 48: 31-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and at least some constituent neurons of the cochlear nuclear complex (CN) (Wang et al., 2005Wang V.Y.

Math1 expression redefines the rhombic lip derivatives and reveals novel lineages within the brainstem and cerebellum.Neuron. 2005; 48: 31-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). While LRL territory is restricted to dorsal-most neuroectoderm, it spans the full rostrocaudal extent of the hindbrain from rhombomere (r) 2 through 8. Most dorsally restricted genes expressed specifically in the LRL also span this full rostrocaudal extent (Rodriguez and Dymecki, 2000Rodriguez C.I. Dymecki S.M. Origin of the precerebellar system.Neuron. 2000; 27: 475-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2005Wang V.Y. Rose M.F. Zoghbi H.Y.

Further hampering analyses is the lack of discriminating molecular markers that can distinguish each LRL sublineage as it emigrates. This is especially critical, as LRL derivatives distribute extensively during development along seemingly entwined paths, making it exceptionally difficult to link final fate to precise originating coordinates within the LRL and the associated molecular programs enacted therein. With respect to the mammalian cochlear nuclear complex, recent data point to the LRL as the source for some constituent neurons (Wang et al., 2005Wang V.Y. Rose M.F. Zoghbi H.Y. Math1 expression redefines the rhombic lip derivatives and reveals novel lineages within the brainstem and cerebellum.Neuron. 2005; 48: 31-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), although their precise rostrocaudal:dorsoventral coordinate position (and therefore molecular profile) of origin within the LRL is not known, nor are the locations of other (non-LRL) contributing progenitors. Unique gene expression profiles distinguish individual rhombomeres (reviewed in Lumsden and Krumlauf, 1996Lumsden A. Krumlauf R. Patterning the vertebrate neuraxis.Science. 1996; 274: 1109-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar) and do so seemingly by encompassing the full dorsoventral extent of a given rhombomere. Thus, even though the LRL, in its production of tangentially migrating cells, is mechanistically distinct from the majority of hindbrain germinative neuroepithelium, it is likely, nevertheless, to be partitioned rostrocaudally by these same rhombomere-specific gene expression profiles. This appears to be the case for at least distinguishing the avian upper rhombic lip of r1 generally from the LRL (r2–r8) (Eddison et al., 2004Eddison M. Toole L. Bell E. Wingate R.J. Segmental identity and cerebellar granule cell induction in rhombomere 1.BMC Biol. 2004; 2: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, Wingate and Hatten, 1999Wingate R.J. Hatten M.E. The role of the rhombic lip in avian cerebellum development.Development. 1999; 126: 4395-4404PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that molecularly distinct progenitor pools are arrayed along the entire rostrocaudal span of the LRL and that the genetic differences characterizing these pools are relevant to specific cochlear and precerebellar fates. To test this possibility in mice, we have developed a high-resolution, dual recombinase-responsive indicator allele that, when coupled with two recombinase-expressing alleles (one encoding Cre and the other Flpe), “intersectionally” tracks lineages defined by a shared history of two gene expression profiles. (Figure 1A, cells cartooned in green). For example, by combining this indicator allele with a LRL-specific Flpe allele and a rhombomere-specific cre allele, only those LRL progenitors at that rhombomeric or axial level are marked by green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Figure 1A, cells colored green). A second feature of this strategy is the ability to simultaneously track “Cre/non-Flp” lineages (Figure 1A, cells colored blue); by “subtracting” away from the Cre-expressing domain those cells arising from the Cre/Flp genetic intersection, the reciprocal more-narrowed subset of Cre-only-expressing cells can be analyzed. By exploiting both features, we have been able to track simultaneously rhombomere-specific LRL lineages (green cells) within the context of other derivatives arising from non-LRL territories within that same rhombomere (blue cells). Thus, this general approach can be exploited in two ways to reduce the complexity and increase the resolution available in genetic fate maps: by an intersectional requirement for defining one subpopulation and a subtractive requirement for defining another. Through application of this strategy, we delineate within the LRL separate rostrocaudal territories encompassing auditory and precerebellar progenitors. We provide evidence that the more rostrally located “auditory lip” distributes neurons throughout the entire brainstem cochlear nuclear complex and is further divisible into microdomains along its rostrocaudal axis in relation to future cochlear nuclei fate—the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN), the posteroventral cochlear nucleus (PVCN), and the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). Thus, we show that the mammalian LRL is parceled genetically along the rostrocaudal axis into molecularly discrete progenitor pools associated with specific neuronal fates. Using the subtractive feature of this new indicator allele, we have also been able to ascertain contributions to the deep projection regions of each cochlear nucleus from progenitor zones lying ventral to the auditory lip. By contrast, granule cells that ensheath the entire cochlear nuclear complex derive almost entirely from the auditory lip; additionally, they share in part a molecular profile with precerebellar mossy fiber neurons. Remarkably, these two similar populations (cochlear nuclei granule cells and precerebellar neurons) converge topographically during development but do not mix. Unexpectedly, the DCN, the cochlear nucleus adjacent and structurally similar to the cerebellum (reviewed in Oertel and Young, 2004Oertel D. Young E.D. What's a cerebellar circuit doing in the auditory system?.Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 104-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), does not arise from LRL territory situated immediately adjacent to the cerebellar primordium in r1; instead, it arises from noncontiguous, more caudal regions of auditory lip. Their juxtaposition in the mature brain is likely secondary to morphogenetic transformations such as those associated with the pontine flexure. These collective findings, made possible only through application of the dual recombinase-responsive indicator allele introduced herein, provide a new foundation for studying auditory and precerebellar development. To map onto specific cell fates either progenitor-specific expression of single genes, gene combinations, or gene subtractions, we generated a novel dual recombinase-responsive indicator allele designed to express nuclear β-galactosidase (nβ-gal) after a Cre-mediated DNA excision and to turn off expression of nβ-gal and turn on expression of a farnesylated (membrane-localized) version of enhanced GFP (eGFPF) (Awatramani et al., 2003Awatramani R.

We refer to this indicator allele as RC::PFwe. Its generation involved targeting to the Gt(ROSA)26Sor (R26) locus (Zambrowicz et al., 1997Zambrowicz B.P. Imamoto A. Fiering S. Herzenberg L.A.

Efficient selection for high-expression transfectants with a novel eukaryotic vector.Gene. 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4424) Google Scholar) driven transgene harboring a loxP- and FRT-disrupted WGA/eGFPF bicistronic transcriptional unit (Figure 1B). Thus, intersectional descendants (Figure 1A, green-colored cells) are marked by expression of both WGA and eGFPF, molecules that permit aspects of cell morphology and axonal projections to be visualized, with WGA offering in limited circumstances the potential to map synaptic partners via specific transneuronal transfer. Cre-descendants lying outside the genetic intersection (Figure 1A, blue-colored cells) are marked by expression of nβ-gal, which through its nuclear localization facilitates identification of individual cells. In triply transgenic animals (Flp, cre, indicator), removal of the nlacZ cassette from intersectional lineages (by Flp-mediated excision) restricts nβ-gal marking to Cre/non-Flp descendants. This subtractive feature permits the reciprocal subset of Cre-only-expressing cells to be mapped. To test the recombinase dependency of reporter expression from the RC::PFwe allele, we analyzed the parental RC::PFwe strain along with the two derivative strains, RC::Fwe and RC::Pwe, generated through germline deletion of either the loxP- or FRT-flanked cassette, respectively (Figure 2A). While RC::PFwe is responsive to both Cre and Flp, FRT-disrupted WGA/eGFPF (RC::Fwe) is responsive only to Flp, and loxP-disrupted WGA/eGFPF (RC::Pwe) only to Cre. We have employed a variety of tissue-specific cre- and Flpe-expressing transgenes with these alleles. As proof of principle, we highlight here results using Wnt1::cre (Chai et al., 2000Chai Y. Jiang X. Ito Y. Bringas Jr., P. Han J. Rowitch D.H. Soriano P. McMahon A.P. Sucov H.M. Fate of the mammalian cranial neural crest during tooth and mandibular morphogenesis.Development. 2000; 127: 1671-1679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Wnt1::Flpe (Awatramani et al., 2003Awatramani R. Soriano P. Rodriguez C. Mai J.J. Dymecki S.M. Cryptic boundaries in roof plate and choroid plexus identified by intersectional gene activation.Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) transgenes, which mediate recombination in dorsal neural tube progenitors; we show spinal neural tube to illustrate allele features. In the absence of recombination events, nβ-gal, eGFPF, and WGA were all undetectable from the RC::PFwe allele (Figure 2B); eGFPF and WGA were equally undetectable from either the derivative RC::Fwe allele (Figure 2D, middle and lower panels) or the RC::Pwe allele (Figure 2F, middle and lower panels). These findings indicate that the employed “stop” sequences (an SV40 polyadenylation signal sequence [pA] concatamer and separately a bovine growth hormone pA concatamer) were sufficient to prevent detectable levels of reporter expression in the absence of recombination. Following Cre-mediated recombination of RC::PFwe in the dorsal neural tube, progenitors and their progeny (for example, primary sensory dorsal root ganglion neurons [DRGs]) (Figure 2C, black arrowhead) produced nβ-gal but no detectable eGFPF or WGA. The derivative allele RC::Fwe (Figure 2A), in the absence of recombination, was broadly productive of nβ-gal (Figure 2D upper panel); this was expected, given that nlacZ expression from this allele is driven in an unconditional fashion from R26 and CAG regulatory elements. Following Flpe-mediated excision in Wnt1+ cells of the FRT-flanked nlacZ cassette in RC::Fwe, nβ-gal was extinguished in dorsal neural tube progenitors and their progeny (Figure 2E, upper panel); in its place, these cells activated expression of eGFPF and WGA (Figure 2E, middle and lower panels, respectively). Given that Wnt1::Flpe-mediated excision of the nlacZ cassette starts as early as ∼8.5 days post coitum (dpc) and that nβ-gal activity in Wnt1::Flpe descendants is gone by 11.5 dpc (Figure 2E, upper panel), perdurance of nβ-gal following deletion of nlacZ is minimal and nonconfounding. Notably, this short nβ-gal half-life ensures against codetection of nβ-gal in intersectional eGFPF+ descendants (Figure 1A). Such codetection would compromise the resolving power of any intersectional indicator allele when used in subtractive strategies. Importantly, this does not appear to be the case here; rather, when RC::PFwe is used in conjunction with both a cre and Flp allele, nβ-gal is capable of identifying faithfully the Cre/non-Flp lineages. Analyses of Wnt1::Flpe;RC::Fwe double transgenics (Figure 2E) and Wnt1::cre;RC::Pwe double trangenics (Figure 2G) demonstrate the membrane localization of the eGFPF reporter, as evidenced in sensory dendrites extending from DRGs (Figure 2, middle panels in [E] and [G], open arrowheads). Similar morphology was observed on detection of WGA (Figure 2, lower panels in [E] and [G]). In summary, reporter molecule activation from RC::PFwe and its derivative lines was strictly recombinase dependent and yielded the anticipated patterns of expression. Similar results were observed in other regions of the central nervous system and at other time points (data not shown). While incorporation of WGA offers the potential to map not only cell fate but future synaptic partners (Braz et al., 2002Braz J.M. Rico B. Basbaum A.I.

We define operationally the dorsoventral (DV) extent of the LRL as Wnt1-expressing territory because it is this region that is productive of tangentially migrating neurons, inclusive of those that migrate extramurally as well as those that migrate intramurally (Landsberg et al., 2005Landsberg R.L.

Progressing dorsoventrally within this Wnt1+ territory reside molecularly separable progenitor pools, for example, as demarcated by Gdf7, Math1, and Ngn1 expression (Landsberg et al., 2005Landsberg R.L.

Among descendant cell types observed were cochlear granule cells and neurons of the ventral cochlear nuclei (VCN, inclusive of the AVCN and PVCN subdivisions); within the cochlear nuclear complex, very few nβ-gal+ cells were found populating the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). Since Wnt1 is expressed throughout the entire LRL (inclusive of but extending beyond the Math1 subdomain), we first set out to determine the contribution made by the entire LRL to the cochlear nuclear complex, paying special attention to the DCN. To do this, we exploited the Cre-responsive (single recombinase) feature of the RC::PFwe allele. On partnering with a Wnt1::cre transgene (Chai et al., 2000Chai Y. Jiang X. Ito Y. Bringas Jr., P. Han J. Rowitch D.H. Soriano P. McMahon A.P. Sucov H.M. Fate of the mammalian cranial neural crest during tooth and mandibular morphogenesis.Development. 2000; 127: 1671-1679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which cre recombinase expression mirrors that of endogenous Wnt1 in this region of the brain (Figure 3B versus 3C, 3E versus 3F, and Figure S1), we were able to follow the fate of Wnt1::cre derivatives based on their sustained expression of nβ-gal. Marked cells distributed densely throughout all divisions of the cochlear nuclear complex: the magnocellular cores of the AVCN, PVCN, and DCN (Figures 3H–3J) and the entire microneuronal shell (Figures 3H–3J, white arrows). Coimmunodetection of nβ-gal and the neuron-specific nuclear antigen NeuN indicates that the majority of Wnt1-descendants are indeed neurons (Figures 3H–3J, insets)—although NeuN does not appear to mark all neuronal cell types within the cochlear nuclear complex and therefore underestimates this population. While the LRL generates both cochlear and precerebellar neurons, it remains unclear whether in the mouse these two complex populations emerge from overlapping or distinct axial levels, especially given that precerebellar nuclei such as the pontine gray nucleus (PGN) and inferior olivary nucleus (ION) flank rostrocaudally the cochlear nuclear complex (schematized in Figure 3G). To determine definitively the axial level at which auditory and precerebellar lineages emerge from the LRL, we exploited the intersectional and subtractive"
https://openalex.org/W2031383352,"The genes that control mammalian programmed cell death are conserved across wide evolutionary distances. Although plant cells can undergo apoptosis-like cell death, plant homologs of mammalian regulators of apoptosis have, in general, not been found. This is in part due to the lack of primary sequence conservation between animal and putative plant regulators of apoptosis. Thus, alternative approaches beyond sequence similarities are required to find functional plant homologs of apoptosis regulators. Here, we present the results of using advanced bioinformatic tools to uncover the Arabidopsis family of BAG proteins. The mammalian BAG (Bcl-2-associated athanogene) proteins are a family of chaperone regulators that modulate a number of diverse processes ranging from proliferation to growth arrest and cell death. Such proteins are distinguished by a conserved BAG domain that directly interacts with Hsp70 and Hsc70 proteins to regulate their activity. Our searches of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome sequence revealed seven homologs of the BAG protein family. We further show that plant BAG family members are also multifunctional and remarkably similar to their animal counterparts, as they regulate apoptosis-like processes ranging from pathogen attack to abiotic stress and development.

The genes that control programmed cell death are conserved across wide evolutionary distances from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans (1Lockshin R.A. Zakeri Z. Tilly J.L. When Cells Die: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Apoptosis and Programmed Cell Death. 1998; (Wiley-Liss, New York)Google Scholar), although whether such conservation extends to plants is unknown. PCD plays a normal physiological role in many plant processes, and although the biochemical mechanisms responsible for cell suicide in plants are largely unknown, a number of reports suggest similarities to animal PCD (reviewed in Ref. 2Dickman M.B. Reed J.C. Programmed Cell Death in Plants. 2003; (Gray, J., ed) pp. , Blackwell Publishing, Oxford, UK: 26-43Google Scholar). Moreover, ectopic expression of certain animal anti-apoptotic genes in transgenic plants is known to confer protection from pathogens and other stresses by death suppression (3Hansen G. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2000; 6: 649-657Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 4Dickman M.B. Park Y.K. Oltersdorf T. Li W. Clemente T. French R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2002; 99: 15217-15221Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).The identification of homologs of animal cell death regulators is of considerable interest. However, to date, few endogenous plant genes that show significant sequence similarity to animal apoptotic genes have been identified. Examination of the completed genome sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana, as well as other partially or nearly complete plant genomes by tools such as BLAST and FASTA, has not revealed any apparent homologs to the core apoptosis regulators. This may be explained by high sequence divergence of functional plant homologs of animal apoptotic proteins. Therefore, one approach to identify candidate PCD modulators in plants is through advanced tools of bioinformatics. We describe the results of such efforts, viz. the identification and characterization of the BAG protein family of Arabidopsis by profile-sequence (Pfam) and profile-profile (FFAS) algorithms.The BAG proteins are an evolutionarily conserved family of multifunctional proteins that promote cell survival and are distinguished by a common conserved region located near the C terminus termed the BAG domain (BD). The first BAG gene was discovered in a search for Bcl-2-interacting proteins and was shown to synergistically enhance cell survival with Bcl-2 (6Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). These proteins share a common Hsp70/Hsc70 interaction domain (BD), but generally differ in the N-terminal region, which imparts specificity to particular proteins and pathways. Two of the six human BAG proteins (BAG1 and BAG6) contain a ubiquitin-like domain at the N terminus. This domain is probably functionally relevant, as it is conserved in BAG proteins from yeast, plants, and worms. In addition, BAG1 is associated with the proteasome in HeLa cells and thus may serve as a bridge between Hsp70 and the ubiquitin system (7Alberti S. Demand J. Esser C. Emmerich N. Schild H. Hohfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45920-45927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). BAG family proteins also modulate (positively or negatively) the Hsp70 chaperone proteins and form complexes with a variety of transcription factors (8Zeiner M. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11465-11469Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 9Wang M. Oppedijk B.J. Lu X. Van Duijn B. Schlperoort R.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 1125-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). BAG proteins regulate diverse physiological processes in animals, including apoptosis, tumorigenesis, neuronal differentiation, stress responses, and the cell cycle.Although BAG proteins are being extensively studied in animals, plant homologs have been noted only in comparative sequence studies (10Takayama S. Reed J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E237-E241Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), and nothing is known about the function of BAG-like proteins in plants or to what extent functional similarities exist between the plant and animal families. Our searches of the A. thaliana genome sequence revealed seven homologs of the BAG family, including four with domain organization similar to their animal homologs. Three members contain a calmodulin-binding domain near the BD, a novel feature associated with plant BAG proteins reflecting possible divergent mechanisms involved with plant-specific PCD. Herein, we describe genome organization, molecular phylogeny, and comparative genomics that provide a basis for further functional studies of this multigene family. We further show that plant BAG family members are also multifunctional and regulate processes from pathogen attack to abiotic stress and development.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESComputational Methods—Six BD-containing proteins of the A. thaliana genome were found in Pfam and SMART BAG families (accession numbers PF02179 and SM00264, respectively) created via hidden Markov model (HMM)-based data base searches. A. thaliana (At) BAG7 was identified as a potential match to the BAG protein family. Several criteria such as conservation of the critical amino acids in the BD, similarities in electrostatic potential, and hydrophobic residue distribution on the molecular surface were considered in accepting the putative AtBAG7 member. Representative members of the assembled Arabidopsis BAG family were used to scan expressed sequence tag (EST) data banks of NCBI with the TBLASTN program. The homology models were generated by the SWISS-MODEL web server using the human BAG4 BD solution NMR structure as a template. Each model was generated based on multiple alignments of AtBAG1-7 and human BAG4 BDs. The models were processed by the DeepView/Swiss-PdbViewer program. All BAG proteins were analyzed for the presence of the additional BDs and organellar target sequences using the Pfam and PSORT programs, respectively.Plant Assays—Treated and untreated detached tobacco leaves were chopped with a razor blade into 0.5-cm fragments and stored overnight in ice-cold 70% ethanol, followed by standard paraffin embedding and sectioning procedures. Slides were prepared for TUNEL assays as described (30Chen S. Vaghchhipawala Z. Li W. Asard H. Dickman M.B. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1630-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Transgenic and wild-type tobacco plants were grown at 25 °C with 16-h light periods in a greenhouse. Knock-out and wild-type Arabidopsis plants were grown at 23 °C with 16-h light periods and 50% humidity. Surface-sterilized Arabidopsis seeds were plated on one-half Murashige and Skoog medium and grown for 2 weeks at 23 °C with a 16-h light period and 70% humidity. Six-week-old tobacco and 4-5-week-old Arabidopsis plants and detached leaves were used for fungal inoculation. Five-mm-diameter agar plugs containing actively grown hyphal tips from 5-day-old colonies of Botrytis cinerea (ATCC 11542) grown on potato dextrose agar were used for plant inoculation. Inoculated leaves were placed on moistened sterile filter paper in glass Petri dishes and incubated for 2-10 days at 25 °C (tobacco leaves) or 23 °C (Arabidopsis leaves) under high humidity conditions. Inoculated plants were placed in a mist chamber at high humidity at 22-25 °C. To induce cell death by cold treatment, wild-type and low atbag4-expressing tobacco plants were stressed at -20 °C for 10 min. Two hours later, tissue was prepared and evaluated by TUNEL assay as described previously (30Chen S. Vaghchhipawala Z. Li W. Asard H. Dickman M.B. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1630-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).All experiments were repeated at least three times with a minimum of three independent lines. The following T-DNA insertion lines were used: AtBAG4, SALK_033845, SAIL_418_B09, and SAIL_144_A10; and AtBAG6, SALK_009534 and SALK_058290. T-DNA insertions were confirmed by PCR and sequencing the products.RESULTSIdentification of the Arabidopsis bag Gene Family—Low sequence identities (13-25%) and similarities (32-46%) between the BDs of Arabidopsis and animal BAG proteins explain the inability of BLAST searches to find animal BAG homologs in the Arabidopsis genome. Therefore, more sensitive methods such as HMM-based protein search tools and profile-profile alignment algorithms were used (11Bateman A. Haft D.H. Brief. Bioinform. 2002; 3: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 12Rychlewski L. Jaroszewski L. Li W. Godzik A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). These methods allow the identification of homologs with large sequence divergence via building probabilistic models of the protein family and comparing the models with available sequences to find new family members. To identify Arabidopsis BD-containing proteins, we used HMM-based protein search tools (Pfam and SMART) and found seven BD-containing proteins in the A. thaliana genome. Sixteen seed alignments of 80% consensus were used by both the Pfam and SMART programs to build an HMM of the BAG protein family. The putative BAG proteins were annotated as “unknown” or “hypothetical” proteins in the data bases. We named this family the bag gene family and adopted the previously reported numbering system for Arabidopsis bag genes (32Juqiang Y. Cixin H. Hong Z. Plant Sci. 2003; 165: 1-7Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Upon application of this HMM to search the available A. thaliana genome sequence, we identified putative Arabidopsis BAG homologs with high statistical significance (E values are in the interval 2.7e-06-8.3e-26) except for AtBAG7 (which was classified as a potential match). Several criteria, including conservation of critical amino acids in the BD, similarities in electrostatic potential, and hydrophobic surface residue distribution, were considered in evaluating AtBAG7 as a member of the BAG protein family. Our additional bioinformatic studies (see below) revealed that this protein is most likely also a member of the Arabidopsis BAG family. The bag gene products were assigned to distinct subcellular locations (Table 1) based on the predictions of the PSORT program (13Nakai K. Adv. Protein Chem. 2000; 54: 277-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The BD amino acid sequences of the putative Arabidopsis BAG proteins share similarities of between 50 and 90%. However, the BDs of several protein pairs within the Arabidopsis BAG family share no easily recognizable sequence similarity, suggesting that at least two subgroups of Arabidopsis BAG proteins emerged from early duplication, followed by divergent or independent evolution.TABLE 1Characteristics of predicted BAG proteins in A. thalianaProteinaProtein names adopted in this studyGene accession no.Predicted protein propertiesNo. of EST hitsfNumber of EST hits derived from the MIPS DatabaseChromosome no.Previous namegPrevious names taken from the NCBI and MIPS DatabasesAGI IDbSystematic gene designation given by the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (AGI)Genomic locuscGene locus designation on the annotated bacterial artificial chromosomesNCBI accession no.Molecular massdPredicted protein molecular masses, length in amino acids (aa), and isoelectric points acquired from TIGRview in the Arabidopsis MIPS Database (available at mips.gsf.de/proj/thal/db/index.html)LengthdPredicted protein molecular masses, length in amino acids (aa), and isoelectric points acquired from TIGRview in the Arabidopsis MIPS Database (available at mips.gsf.de/proj/thal/db/index.html)pIdPredicted protein molecular masses, length in amino acids (aa), and isoelectric points acquired from TIGRview in the Arabidopsis MIPS Database (available at mips.gsf.de/proj/thal/db/index.html)Subcellular localizationeSubcellular localization predicted using the PSORT program (Version 6.4) (13)kDaaaAtBAG1At5g52060MSG15.15NP_20001936.43268.93Cytoplasm25PutativeAtBAG2At5g62100MTG10.13BAB1017225.52328.92Microbody35UnknownAtBAG3At5g07220T28J14.160NP_19633934.23039.24Cytoplasm85UnknownAtBAG4At3g51780ORF3AAC1440529.22695.2Cytoplasm53UnknownAtBAG5At1g12060F12F1.7AAC1760624.52159.05Mitochondrion3HypotheticalAtBAG6At2g46240T3F17.11AAC62882116.810435.2Nucleus22HypotheticalAtBAG7At5g62390MMI9.22NP_20104551.64469.28Nucleus65Calmodulin-binding protein familya Protein names adopted in this studyb Systematic gene designation given by the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (AGI)c Gene locus designation on the annotated bacterial artificial chromosomesd Predicted protein molecular masses, length in amino acids (aa), and isoelectric points acquired from TIGRview in the Arabidopsis MIPS Database (available at mips.gsf.de/proj/thal/db/index.html)e Subcellular localization predicted using the PSORT program (Version 6.4) (13Nakai K.

According to sequence similarity, the Arabidopsis BAG proteins cluster into two groups. Group I is represented by AtBAG1-4, which are predicted to localize in the cytoplasm (except AtBAG2, the predicted localization of which is the microbody); and as with some mammalian BAG proteins, ubiquitin-like domains are located in the N terminus. Thus, the BAG proteins of Group I are similar to animal counterparts. The Arabidopsis BAG proteins that are predicted to localize in the nucleus (AtBAG6 and AtBAG7) compose Group II. AtBAG5 does not belong to either group.A phylogenetic tree of the BAG protein family was constructed (Fig. 1B). The first major branch splits the predicted cytosolic Arabidopsis BAG protein family members from the organellar members. Notably, the Arabidopsis cytosolic members compose the plant origin cluster, including putative plant BAG proteins from Oryza sativa and Cicer arietinum. The nuclear members (AtBAG6 and AtBAG7) are in a separate cluster from the putative mitochondrial member AtBAG5. Interestingly, AtBAG6 and AtBAG3 cluster with the BD-containing protein Samui from Bombyx mori, which is induced in response to cold (14Moribe Y. Niimi T. Yamashita O. Yaginuma T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3432-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Gene and Domain Organization—Arabidopsis bag genes encoding proteins predicted to localize in the same cellular compartment tend to have similar exon-intron organization (supplemental Fig. S1). The common feature of all Arabidopsis BAG proteins is the presence of the BD in the C terminus (Fig. 1C). As in several mammalian BAG proteins, four of the predicted plant BAG family members possess ubiquitin domains in the N terminus, whereas three plant BAG proteins (AtBAG5-7) contain a calmodulin-binding motif near the BD, a novel feature associated with plant BAG family members. As with the structure of bag genes, the domain structure correlates with the predicted cellular localization of Arabidopsis BAG family proteins. Thus, AtBAG1, AtBAG3, and AtBAG4, as well as AtBAG2, have very similar domain organizations with a ubiquitin-like domain in the N terminus and are predicted to be cytosolic proteins. In contrast, AtBAG6 and AtBAG7 also have very similar domain organizations, with the calmodulin-binding motif found near the BD, and are predicted to be nuclear proteins because of the presence of nuclear localization sequences.Multiple alignment of BD sequences from A. thaliana BAG proteins and human BAG4 and BAG1 revealed that most residues of mammalian BAG proteins that are required for Hsc70 interaction are conserved in Arabidopsis BAG proteins (Fig. 2D). The structure of the human BAG1M-Hsc70 complex is shown in Fig. 2A. The crystal structure reveals that Glu212, Asp222, Arg237, and Gln245 in human BAG1 participate in an electrostatic interaction with the ATPase domain of Hsc70 (15Sondermann H. Scheufler C. Schneider C. Hohfeld J. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Science. 2001; 291: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). These key interaction residues are conserved and, in rare cases, are conservatively replaced in the BDs of Arabidopsis BAG proteins with the exception that Gln245 is not found in the BDs of AtBAG2, AtBAG5, and AtBAG6 (Fig. 2D). However, based on the overall similarity of the plant BD interaction surfaces to equivalent mammalian BAG protein BD surfaces, it is reasonable to assume that Arabidopsis BAG proteins bind Hsc70 in a manner analogous to mammalian BAG proteins.FIGURE 2A, crystal structure of the human BAG1M-Hsc70 complex (data taken from the Protein Data Bank) (15Sondermann H. Scheufler C. Schneider C. Hohfeld J. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Science. 2001; 291: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The BD is shown in yellow, and the Hsc70 ATPase domain is shown in green. B, a ribbon representation of the AtBAG4 BD homology model and the human BAG4 BD solution NMR structure (Protein Data Bank code 1M7K). The α helices shown as yellow ribbons compose a short antiparallel triple-helix bundle in both human and Arabidopsis BDs. The molecules are oriented so that second and third helices (the Hsc70-binding surface) are facing up front; residues of the human BAG4 BD that interact with the N- and C-terminal lobes and the corresponding residues in the AtBAG4 BD are colored red and blue, respectively. C, secondary structure-based sequence alignment of BDs from AtBAG4 and human BAG4 and BAG1. D, alignment of BD amino acid sequences from seven ArabidopsisBAG proteins and human BAG1 and BAG4 using the ClustalW multiple sequence alignment program. Similarity is colored by the default ClustalX coloring scheme (31Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. and Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35206) Google Scholar). The positions of residues that are important for interaction with Hsc70 are indicated by colored circles as described above. E, comparison of the BDs of AtBAG4 and human BAG4. A three-dimensional homology model of the AtBAG4 BD generated by the SWISS-MODEL web server was compared with the reported structure of the human BAG4 BD. The residues on the surface of the human BAG4 BD that are important for Hsc70 interaction are indicated and are compared with the corresponding residues of the AtBAG4 BD. The water-accessible molecular surfaces are colored according to electrostatic potential (upper row) and hydrophobicity (lower row). In the electrostatic potential maps, the blue color intensity is proportional to positive charge, white to neutral, and red to negative. In the hydrophobicity maps, the yellow color intensity is proportional to the hydrophobicity of the underlying residues. All molecules are oriented so that the second and third helices (the Hsc70-binding surface) are facing up front.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The plant BAG/Hsc70 interaction was tested experimentally by pull-down assays using AtBAG4 and Arabidopsis Hsc70. In vitro translated 35S-labeled AtBAG4 was examined for its ability to bind glutathione S-transferase-Hsc70 fusion protein produced in Escherichia coli. AtBAG4 bound to glutathione S-transferase-Hsc70, but not to the glutathione-Sepharose beads (supplemental Fig. S2). Hence, AtBAG4 is a structural and possible functional homolog of the BAG protein family.Comparison of the BDs of Arabidopsis BAG Proteins and Human BAG4—Similar to mammalian BAG proteins, AtBAG1 binds to Hsc70. Therefore, we compared the surface of the reported BD solution NMR structure of human BAG4 with a three-dimensional model of the BD of AtBAG4. The three-dimensional structure of the human BAG4 BD was chosen as a template for homology modeling because, of all available Protein Data Bank three-dimensional BD structures, the human BAG4 BD shows the greatest identity/similarity (21.2/42.4%) to the AtBAG4 BD. In this way, we found that the Hsc70-binding surfaces (α2 and α3 helices) of the BDs from AtBAG4 and human BAG4 are very similar in charge distribution (Fig. 2E). Similar to the BD of human BAG4, the BD of AtBAG4 (acidic residues Asp175 and Glu179 from the α2 helix; Asp189, Glu192, and Glu194 from the connecting loop; and Glu213 and Asp216 from the α3 helix) contributes to the negative charge of the Hsc70-interacting surface. Basic residues (Lys198, Arg201, Lys202, and Lys206) in the N terminus of the α3 helix of the AtBAG4 BD contribute to the positive charge and are clustered in the upper left corner of the surface. The positions of the residues that are important for Hsc70 interaction in the AtBAG4 BD homology model are also remarkably similar to those in the three-dimensional structure reported for the human BAG4 BD (Fig. 2B). The Hsc70-interacting surface similarity of the AtBAG4 and human BAG4 BDs is consistent with AtBAG4 binding to Hsc70. To confirm binding of AtBAG4 to Hsc70, two site-directed BD mutants (deletion and point mutants) were generated. The results of in vitro pull-down experiments show that binding of AtBAG4 to Hsc70 was abolished in these mutants, indicating that the Arabidopsis BD is required for interaction with Hsc70, similar to human BAG proteins (supplemental Fig. S2).The central hydrophobic region composed of α2 helix residues (Leu185, Leu186, and Leu188) and α3 helix residues (Val205 and Ile208) of the BD surface of AtBAG4 is very similar to that of human BAG4 (Fig. 2E). However, the α2 and α3 helix surface of the AtBAG4 BD appears to be more hydrophobic than that of the human BAG4 BD. Thus, despite distant homology between the BDs of AtBAG4 and human BAG4 (21.2% identity), a prediction for AtBAG4/Hsc70 interaction is consistent with the experimental data. This can be explained by the higher degree of BD similarity in the α2 and α3 helices, the analysis of which was used for the AtBAG4/Hsc70 interaction prediction. We therefore generated homology models for all A. thaliana BAG BDs as described above and compared their α2 and α3 helix surface residues with those of the AtBAG4 and human BAG4 BDs (Fig. 3). High similarities with respect to both charge and hydrophobic residue distributions were found between the α2 and α3 helix residues of the AtBAG4 protein and those of the AtBAG1-3, AtBAG6, and AtBAG7 proteins. All these proteins share acidic residues and a basic cluster in the domain as well as hydrophobic residues in the α2 and α3 helices (Fig. 3, first and third rows). On the basis of this analysis, it is likely that AtBAG1-3, AtBAG6, and AtBAG7 bind Hsc70 in a manner similar to AtBAG4. Interestingly, the Hsc70-interacting surface of AtBAG5 was found to be quite different from those of the other BAG family members with respect to charge distribution. The α2 and α3 helix surface of the AtBAG5 BD is more positively charged, with an acidic cluster in the left bottom corner. However, with respect to hydrophobic residue distribution, the Hsc70-interacting surface of the AtBAG5 BD is very similar to that of the human BAG4 BD. Thus, it is difficult to predict AtBAG5 interaction with Hsc70 based on comparative models.FIGURE 3Homology models of seven A. thaliana BAG BDs in comparison with the human BAG4 BD. The water-accessible molecular surfaces are colored according to electrostatic potential (upper two rows) and hydrophobicity (lower two rows) as described in the legend to Fig. 2C.Inthe first and third rows, the molecules are oriented so that the second and third helices (the Hsc70-binding surface) are facing up front, whereas in the second and fourth rows, the molecules are rotated 180° about the vertical axis. h, human.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression Patterns of atbag4 and atbag6—A representative of each phylogenetic group (atbag4 and atbag6) was chosen to assess expression patterns in various tissues during development and under stress conditions. Reverse transcription-PCR indicated that varying levels of atbag4 transcripts were detected in stems, leaves, flowers, and roots, with expression in roots and flowers being higher than in other tissues (supplemental Fig. S3). Similar expression patterns were detected for atbag6 transcripts, except that atbag6 transcript expression was not detectable in leaves. We also analyzed transcript abundance of atbag4 and atbag6 in Arabidopsis leaf tissue prior to and during flowering. Both genes had much higher levels of expression in leaf tissue at younger, actively growing stages of development (supplemental Fig. S3).The clustering of AtBAG6 with the cold-induced protein Samui from B. mori as revealed by our phylogenic analysis of BAG proteins suggested a possible role for AtBAG6 in cold responses. Thus, atbag6 induction was analyzed in the leaf tissue of Arabidopsis plants at 0, 20, and 90 min after exposure to -20 °C for 10 min (supplemental Fig. S3). In parallel, we analyzed the induction kinetics of atbag4. atbag4 induction was detected 20 min after cold stress. In contrast, atbag6 transcripts were not observed until 90 min after cold treatment, indicating that atbag4 is a more rapidly induced cold-responsive gene compared with atbag6.Because BAG proteins interact with Hsp70/Hsc70, bag gene responsiveness to heat shock was of interest. We analyzed induction of the atbag4 and atbag6 genes in Arabidopsis leaf tissue over a time course of 30-min intervals following exposure to 37 °C (supplemental Fig. S3). In these experiments, heat treatment strongly induced expression of atbag6 at all chosen time points, with a peak at 60 min of treatment, whereas no induction was detected for atbag4 under the same conditions. Thus, expression patterns during heat stress are distinct for these two genes.Phenotypes of the atbag4 and atbag6 Knock-out Lines—Transgenic lines with T-DNA insertions in the exons of atbag4 and atbag6 were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center and the Syngenta Arabidopsis Insertion Library.

https://openalex.org/W2102252670,"The p75 neurotrophin receptor regulates neuronal survival, promoting it in some contexts yet activating apoptosis in others. The mechanism by which the receptor elicits these differential effects is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that p75 is cleaved by gamma-secretase in sympathetic neurons, specifically in response to proapoptotic ligands. This cleavage resulted in ubiquitination and subsequent nuclear translocation of NRIF, a DNA binding protein essential for p75-mediated apoptosis. Inhibition of gamma-secretase or expression of a mutant p75 resistant to this protease prevented receptor proteolysis, blocked NRIF nuclear entry, and prevented apoptosis. In contrast, overexpression of the p75 ICD resulted in NRIF nuclear accumulation and apoptosis. The receptor proteolysis and NRIF nuclear localization were also observed in vivo during naturally occurring cell death in the superior cervical ganglia. These results indicate that p75-mediated apoptosis requires gamma-secretase dependent release of its ICD, which facilitates nuclear translocation of NRIF."

Vif associates with Cul5-EloBC through a BC-box motif that binds EloC, but the mechanism by which Vif selectively recruits Cul5 is poorly understood. Here we report that a region of Vif (residues 100-142) upstream of the BC-box binds selectively to Cul5 in the absence of EloC. This region contains a zinc coordination site HX5CX17-18CX3-5H (HCCH), with His/Cys residues at positions 108, 114, 133, and 139 coordinating one zinc ion. The HCCH zinc coordination site, which is conserved among primate lentivirus Vif proteins, does not correspond to any known class of zinc-binding motif. Mutations of His/Cys residues in the HCCH motif impair zinc coordination, Cul5 binding, and APOBEC3G degradation. Mutations of conserved hydrophobic residues (Ile-120, Ala-123, and Leu-124) located between the two Cys residues in the HCCH motif disrupt binding of the zinc-coordinating region to Cul5 and inhibit APOBEC3G degradation. The Vif binding site maps to the first cullin repeat in the N terminus of Cul5. These data suggest that the zinc-binding region in Vif is a novel cullin interaction domain that mediates selective binding to Cul5. We propose that the HCCH zinc-binding motif facilitates Vif-Cul5 binding by playing a structural role in positioning hydrophobic residues for direct contact with Cul5.

Virol. 2003; 77: 11398-11407Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination requires the coordinated activity of an E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme, an E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, and a substrate-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase (24Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Cullin-dependent ubiquitin ligases contain a cullin scaffold, the RING protein Rbx, adaptor molecules, and specificity subunits. In the SCF (Skp1·Cul1·F-box) complex, a prototypical cullin-dependent ubiquitin ligase, the adaptor molecule Skp1 links Cul1 to specificity-determining F-box proteins by binding the N terminus of Cul1 and an ∼40-amino-acid F-box motif (25Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C. Koepp D.M. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). Analysis of the SCFSkp2 crystal structure reveals that the F-box protein Skp2 also makes important contacts with the N terminus of Cul1 (25Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C. Koepp D.M. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar, 26Kamura T. Maenaka K. Kotoshiba S. Matsumoto M. Kohda D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Nakayama K.I. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3055-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Additional binding domains in the F-box protein (e.g. WD-40 domains, Leu-rich repeats) recruit specific targets for ubiquitination. EloBC·Cul2/5·BC-box ubiquitin ligase complexes are formed in a similar manner. The EloBC dimer serves as the adaptor molecule that bridges BC-box proteins to the cullin scaffold by binding the N terminus of the cullin and the BC-box, an ∼10-amino-acid degenerate sequence motif ((Ala/Pro/Ser/Thr)-Leu-Xaa3-(Cys/Ala)-Xaa3-(Ala/Ile/Leu/Val)). EloBC interacts with both Cul2 and Cul5, but under physiological conditions, most BC-box proteins selectively form complexes with only Cul2 or -5. Analogous to F-box proteins, BC-box proteins contain regions that bind both EloBC and the N terminus of the cullin (26Kamura T. Maenaka K. Kotoshiba S. Matsumoto M. Kohda D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Nakayama K.I. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3055-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Sequence elements downstream of the BC-box designated the Cul2- or Cul5-box confer specificity on cullin binding. Most BC-box proteins can thus be divided into those that contain a VHL-box (BC-box and Cul2-box) and preferentially utilize Cul2 or those with a SOCS-box (BC-box and Cul5-box) that interact with Cul5. HIV-1 Vif contains a BC-box motif that is critical for association with Cul5-EloBC and APOBEC3G ubiquitination (19Mehle A. Goncalves J. Santa-Marta M. McPike M. Gabuzda D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2861-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 20Yu Y. Xiao Z. Ehrlich E.S. Yu X. Yu X.F. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2867-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The BC-box motif is conserved in all Vif proteins. The downstream proline/leucine-rich sequence identified as a potential Cul5-box is conserved in HIV-1 and SIVCPZ Vif proteins. However, HIV-2 and other SIV Vif proteins that lack the proline/leucine-rich sequence preferentially interact with Cul5 (27Luo K. Xiao Z. Ehrlich E. Yu Y. Liu B. Zheng S. Yu X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11444-11449Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Vif selectively recruits Cul5 is poorly understood. We have shown here that a zinc-binding region upstream of the BC-box in Vif binds directly to Cul5 and mediates cullin selection. The data suggest a model in which a novel HX5CX17-18CX3-5H (HCCH) zinc coordination motif positions conserved hydrophobic residues for direct binding to the first cullin repeat in the N terminus of Cul5. These results provide insights into the regulated assembly of cullin E3 ubiquitin ligases and also identify new targets for development of antiviral therapies. Antibodies and Plasmids—Antibodies used were rabbit anti-Vif (28Goncalves J. Jallepalli P. Gabuzda D.H. J.

The replication-defective proviral plasmid pNLA1.Vif-FLAG was constructed by deleting the gag and pol genes from the replication-competent HIV-1 molecular clone pNL4-3 and inserting a FLAG epitope sequence at the 3′ end of vif (a gift from K. Strebel, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Vif and Cul5 truncations and Vif mutants were created by PCR-based mutagenesis and confirmed by sequencing. Co-precipitation and Western Blot Analysis—293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. At 36-48 h after calcium phosphate transfection, lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture). Identical amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and detected by standard techniques. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, identical amounts of lysate were subjected to immunoprecipitation or glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down followed by Western blotting. Zinc Blots and Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC)— Zinc blots were performed as described previously (30Schiff L.A. Nibert M.L. Fields B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4195-4199Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-Vif fusions were purified by affinity chromatography (19Mehle A. Goncalves J. Santa-Marta M. McPike M. Gabuzda D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2861-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Equivalent amounts of superoxide dismutase (Sigma), carbonic anhydrase (Sigma), HIV-1 nucleocapsid (National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program), and HIV-1 integrase (a kind gift from A. Engelman, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) were included as controls. Membrane-bound proteins were refolded in three 1-h changes of renaturation buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol). The membranes were probed with 35 μm 65Zn2+ in 100 mm Tris, pH 7, and 50 mm NaCl for 3 h. After binding, the membranes were washed with renaturation buffer. The pH of the binding and wash buffers was altered where indicated. Following exposure to film, membranes were stained with Amido Black to control for protein loading. Chelating Sepharose FF was used for IMAC experiments following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Similar amounts of purified protein were incubated for 3 h with matrix in lysis buffer. Binding experiments with GST-Vif-(100-142) proteins were performed in lysis buffer supplemented to 500 mm NaCl and 10 mm imidazole. Following extensive washing, the bound proteins were detected by Western blot or Coomassie staining. Where indicated, proteins were first eluted with 500 mm imidazole. All buffers were pretreated with Chelex 100 Resin (Bio-Rad) to remove free metals. In Vitro Binding Assay—293T cell lysates or in vitro translation products (TnT Quick System, Promega) were incubated with similar amounts of purified GST fusion proteins in lysis buffer for 2 h. Complexes were captured with glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow, washed with lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by Western blot, autoradiography, or phosphorimaging. Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy—GST-Vif-(100-142) was purified by affinity chromatography in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μm ZnCl2, washed, dialyzed four times against an excess of metal-free 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol, and quantitated by comparison against protein standards of known concentration after SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Zinc content was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Zinc was measured with a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences AAnalyst 600) and analyzed with AA Winlab software, as described previously (31Zheng R. Jenkins T.M. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13659-13664Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Zinc concentrations were determined using a standard curve prepared from a zinc standard solution (Sigma). Measurements were taken using two independent protein preparations. Viruses and Infections—Viruses were produced by co-transfecting 293/APOBEC3G cells (17Yu X. Yu Y. Liu B. Luo K. Kong W. Mao P. Yu X.F. Science. 2003; 302: 1056-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar) with Vif-deficient proviral plasmid pNLXΔvif and wild-type (WT) or mutant pCDNA3.Vif. Viruses were quantitated by reverse transcription assays, and normalized amounts were used to infect the reporter cell line Cf2-luc (15Mehle A. Strack B. Ancuta P. Zhang C. McPike M. Gabuzda D. J.

Vif Is a Zinc-binding Protein—The BC-box motif of HIV-1 Vif binds directly to EloC, but regions of Vif that selectively recruit Cul5 have not been defined. The conserved cysteines at positions 114 and 133 upstream of the BC-box (Fig. 1A) are required for Cul5 association (19Mehle A. Goncalves J. Santa-Marta M. McPike M. Gabuzda D.

A. 2005; 102: 11444-11449Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), APOBEC3G degradation, and viral replication (15Mehle A. Strack B. Ancuta P. Zhang C. McPike M. Gabuzda D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7792-7798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 16Sheehy A.M. Gaddis N.C. Malim M.H. Nat.

These cysteines are part of a highly conserved HX5CX17-18CX3-5H (HCCH) motif present in all primate lentivirus Vif proteins (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 1). Recently, this conserved HCCH motif was shown to be required for assembly of the Vif-Cul5 E3 ligase that ubiquitinates APOBEC3G (19Mehle A. Goncalves J. Santa-Marta M. McPike M. Gabuzda D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2861-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 20Yu Y. Xiao Z. Ehrlich E.S. Yu X. Yu X.F. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2867-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 27Luo K. Xiao Z. Ehrlich E. Yu Y. Liu B. Zheng S. Yu X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11444-11449Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The HCCH motif contains two conserved His/Cys pairs flanking a predicted α-helix that contains a cluster of conserved hydrophobic residues. His and Cys are classical zinc-coordinating residues, and the presence of conserved His and Cys residues in proximity is commonly associated with structural tetrahedral zinc-binding sites in which four His/Cys residues function in concert to bind zinc (33Auld D.S. Biometals. 2001; 14: 271-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Structural zinc-binding sites accelerate and stabilize protein folding. To our knowledge, however, the HCCH motif does not correspond to any known class of zinc-binding site. We therefore performed experiments to determine whether Vif is a zinc-binding protein. Zinc blot assays that detect the ability of proteins to coordinate zinc were performed using recombinant GST-Vif (30Schiff L.A. Nibert M.L. Fields B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4195-4199Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Proteins transferred to nitrocellulose were refolded and probed with radioactive 65Zinc (65Zn). GST-Vif was detected by blotting membranes with 65Zn (Fig. 1B). The positive control zinc-binding proteins superoxide dismutase, HIV-1 nucleocapsid, carbonic anhydrase, and HIV-1 integrase bound zinc in this assay, whereas the negative controls GST, ovalbumin, and bovine serum albumin did not (Fig. 1B and data not shown). The positive control proteins utilize diverse binding sites to coordinate zinc, including a nucleic acid-binding zinc finger in nucleocapsid (CCHC), a catalytic zinc-binding site in carbonic anhydrase (HHH-H2O), and a structural zinc-binding site in superoxide dismutase (HHHD), demonstrating the ability of the zinc blot assay to detect a wide range of zinc-coordinating motifs. Specific zinc binding can be inhibited by protonation of the coordinating residues at low pH. We therefore tested zinc binding by Vif at pH values ranging from 7.0 to 5.5. Zinc binding was pH-dependent (Fig. 1C), with the highest levels of binding occurring at pH 7, suggesting the involvement of specific coordinating residues (30Schiff L.A. Nibert M.L. Fields B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4195-4199Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To further investigate the zinc-binding potential of Vif, IMAC was performed using zinc as an affinity ligand. GST-Vif bound to zinc-charged matrix but bound to uncharged matrix only at background levels similar to that of the GST control (Fig. 1D). GST alone failed to bind to zinc-charged matrix (data not shown). Bound GST-Vif was eluted with imidazole, suggesting that binding was specific and not because of protein aggregation or precipitation onto the matrix. Together, these results suggest that Vif contains a novel zinc-binding motif. The HCCH motif in Vif is conserved in HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV Vif (Fig. 1A). To determine whether other primate lentiviral Vif proteins bind zinc, we performed a zinc blot assay using Vif derived from HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIVAGM. Zinc blots of GST fusion proteins demonstrated that HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIVAGM Vif all bound zinc (Fig. 1E). The protein doublet observed in HIV-2 Vif samples resulted from co-purification of truncated Vif proteins. HIV-1 Vif appeared to bind higher levels of zinc compared with HIV-2 and SIVAGM Vif, despite the presence of additional potential zinc-coordinating cysteines in these proteins (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 1B). Different metalloproteins can exhibit different affinities for 65Zn in zinc blot assays, but zinc blots do not provide accurate quantitation of zinc-binding capacity (30Schiff L.A. Nibert M.L. Fields B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4195-4199Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, determination of the relative zinc-binding affinities of these Vif proteins awaits further experimentation. These data indicate that diverse primate lentiviral Vif proteins are zinc-binding proteins. Histidine and Cysteine Residues in the HCCH Motif Form a Novel Zinc Coordination Site—Our previous studies demonstrate that GST-Vif binds directly to recombinant APOBEC3G and recombinant EloC (15Mehle A.

McPike M. Gabuzda D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2861-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), but the biological activity of this fusion protein is unknown. Therefore, to confirm the biological relevance of the preceding results and identify amino acids important for zinc binding, we mutated potential zinc-coordinating residues that are conserved between HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV Vif proteins (Glu-76, His-80, Asp-104, His-108, Cys-114, Cys-133, and His-139 in HIV-1 Vif) in pCDNA3.Vif and tested the ability of these mutants to rescue viral infectivity in the presence of APOBEC3G. Vif mutants E76N, H80N, and D104N retained near-WT ability to enhance viral infectivity (Fig. 2A). In contrast, mutations in the HCCH motif (H108N, C114S, C133S, and H139N) severely impaired Vif function, with viral infectivity indistinguishable from that of a Vif-deleted virus. These data demonstrate that the conserved His/Cys residues of the HCCH motif are essential for viral infectivity. We next performed experiments to identify a minimal zinc-binding region in Vif and further investigate the role of the HCCH motif. The truncation mutant GST-Vif-(100-142), which spans residues 100-142 of HIV-1 Vif and contains the HCCH motif, but not the downstream BC-box sequence, was purified and used for IMAC. GST-Vif-(100-142), but not GST alone, bound zinc-charged matrix, whereas GST-Vif-(100-142) failed to bind uncharged matrix (Fig. 2B). These findings suggest that GST-Vif-(100-142) represents a minimal zinc-binding region. Additional IMAC experiments were performed using WT and zinc coordination site mutants. Mutation of conserved His-108 or -139 significantly impaired zinc binding, reducing the levels of binding to background levels, implicating these residues as potential zinc ligands (Fig. 2C). These results were confirmed by measuring the zinc content of WT and mutant GST-Vif-(100-142) in solution. Atomic absorption spectroscopy showed that purified GST-Vif-(100-142) contains ∼0.89 molar equivalents of zinc, suggesting that Vif binds zinc with a 1:1 molar stoichiometry. Inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry also detected zinc in full-length WT GST-Vif (data not shown). Mutation of the conserved His/Cys residues in the HCCH motif significantly reduced zinc content, approaching zinc levels detected for GST alone (Fig. 2D). These results identify the HCCH motif as a zinc-coordination site and suggest that His-108, Cys-114, Cys-133, and His-139 are the zinc-coordinating ligands. The HCCH Zinc-binding Motif Is Required for Assembly of the Vif-Cul5 Ubiquitin Ligase—The Cys residues in the HCCH motif are required for association with Cul5 (19Mehle A. Goncalves J. Santa-Marta M.

We therefore investigated the effects of His/Cys mutations on Vif association with Cul5 and EloBC. Mutation of the four zinc-coordinating residues significantly impaired APOBEC3G degradation when compared with WT Vif (Fig. 3A) but did not affect the ability of Vif to bind APOBEC3G ((19Mehle A. Goncalves J. Santa-Marta M. McPike M. Gabuzda D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2861-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and data not shown). His/Cys mutations significantly reduced co-precipitation of Vif by Cul5 when compared with WT (Fig. 3B), suggesting that defects in APOBEC3G degradation resulted from impaired Cul5 association. Paired Cys and His residues frequently form the zinc-binding motifs in zinc fingers, small independently folded domains that recognize nucleic acids (33Auld D.S. Biometals. 2001; 14: 271-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Vif binds RNA (34Dettenhofer M. Cen S. Carlson B.A. Kleiman L. Yu X.F. J.

Treatment of lysates with the nonspecific RNA and DNA endonuclease benzonase did not affect Cul5 co-precipitation (data not shown), suggesting that RNA binding is not required for interaction with Cul5. To confirm the biological relevance of the preceding results, we performed experiments to detect binding to endogenous Cul5 when Vif is expressed by a replication-defective HIV-1 clone. WT Vif, but not H108/139N and C114/133S mutant Vifs, expressed by a replication-defective HIV-1 molecular clone co-precipitated endogenous Cul5 (Fig. 3C), providing evidence that the HCCH motif is important for Cul5"

Using an unbiased M13 phage display random peptide library, we developed a screening system to elucidate primary structures surrounding reactive glutamine residue(s) that are preferred by TGase. Screening was performed by selecting phage clones expressing peptides that incorporated biotin-labeled primary amine by the catalytic reactions of TGase 2 and activated Factor XIII (Factor XIIIa). We identified several amino acid sequences that were preferred as glutamine donor substrates, most of which have a marked tendency for individual TGases: TGase 2, QxPϕD(P), QxPϕ, and QxxϕDP; Factor XIIIa, QxxϕxWP (where x and ϕ represent a non-conserved and a hydrophobic amino acid, respectively). We further confirmed that the sequences were favored for transamidation using modified glutathione S-transferase (GST) for recombinant peptide-GST fusion proteins. Most of the fusion proteins exhibited a considerable increase in incorporation of primary amines over that of modified GST alone. Furthermore, we identified the amino acid sequences that demonstrated higher specificity and inhibitory activity in the cross-linking reactions by TGase 2 and Factor XIIIa.

To date, eight human TGase isozymes (Factor XIII, TGases 1–7) have been identified, comprising a large protein family with unique tissue distributions and physiological roles. Among the isozymes, TGase 2 and Factor XIII are two major members, although their locations and regulation differ. TGase 2 is expressed ubiquitously and has been implicated in many biological processes, including apoptosis, stabilization of the extracellular matrix, and regulation of growth factors (6Chen J.S. Mehta K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 817-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 7Fesus L. Piacentini M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 534-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Plasma Factor XIII is synthesized as a zymogen that comprises two A and two B subunits (8Ichinose A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The A subunit contains the catalytic domain and is converted by thrombin-dependent proteolysis into its active form during clot formation. Activated Factor XIII (Factor XIIIa) is involved in fibrin stabilization and wound healing (9Standeven K.F. Ariëns R.A. Grant P.J. Blood Rev. 2005; 19: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Generally, TGase reactions involve a Ca2+-dependent acyl transfer via a double displacement mechanism. In the first step, a glutamine γ-carboxyamide group in the substrate binds to a cysteine at the active site, resulting in formation of a γ-glutamylthioester bond and release of ammonia. Formation of the covalent acyl enzyme intermediate is the rate-limiting step. The ϵ-amino group of a peptide-bound lysine, as a nucleophilic substrate, binds to the acyl enzyme intermediate and then attacks the thioester bond, thereby generating an intermolecular isopeptide ϵ-(γ-glutamyl)lysine cross-link. Primary amines can replace lysine in transamidation reactions and become incorporated into the substrate proteins. Additionally, water can act as a nucleophile, resulting in deamidation of the glutamine residue and formation of a glutamic acid residue. However, the mechanisms by which TGases recognize substrates remain poorly understood. During the first step, TGases are selective with regard to which glutamine residues in the substrate protein take part in the reaction; they are much less selective with regard to the lysine residue or primary amines. Although partial amino acid sequences have been identified from a variety of highly reactive substrates (10Ichinose A. Tamaki T. Aoki N.

Investigations using the TGase substrate protein data base have produced information regarding TGase substrate sequence preferences (19Ruoppolo M. Orru S. D'Amato A. Francese S. Rovero P. Marino G.

Additionally, in studies on celiac disease, in which an unusual gluten-derived peptide antigen is produced, the amino acid distribution around the glutamine residue has been investigated to determine the deamidation sites preferred by TGase 2 (21Vader L.W. de Ru A. van der Wal Y.

Although several preferred substrate sequences have been suggested by these studies, no research has been performed to date using an unbiased peptide library for identification of favorable primary structures. To study the amino acid sequences around reactive glutamine residue(s) that are preferred by TGases, we used an unbiased phage display random peptide library. In this system, peptides are expressed as fusions with the M13 bacteriophage coat protein pIII, displaying the random peptide sequence on the phage surface (25Clackson T. Lowman H.B. Phage Display. 2004; (Oxford University Press, Inc., New York)Google Scholar, 26Sidhu S.S. Lowman H.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 333-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This system has been used for production of antibody-like molecules, epitope identification, and characterization of substrate recognition sites for various proteases (27Marks J.D. Hoogenboom H.R.

We screened a phage-displayed random peptide library using avidin affinity purification of phage clones that incorporated a biotin-labeled primary amine in catalytic reactions with TGase 2 or Factor XIIIa. In the peptide sequences displayed on selected phage clones, we observed a notable tendency toward a preferred primary sequence around the reactive glutamine. These identified peptide sequences were assessed as recombinant fusion proteins with a modified GST (glutathione S-transferase). Selected peptides demonstrated a significant isozyme-specific incorporation of primary amine and blocking effects on cross-linking reaction. This report describes the establishment of a screening system that is equally applicable to the search for substrate sequence preferences in other TGases. Transglutaminases—Guinea pig liver TGase 2 was kindly provided by Dr. Ikura (30Ikura K. Yokota H. Sasaki R. Chiba H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2344-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Human factor XIII (FibrogamminRP; ZLB Behring, Marburg, Germany) was activated by treatment with bovine thrombin (Sigma). Prior to use for phage display screening, thrombin was inactivated by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The enzymatic activities were confirmed using microtiter plate assay, which measures the incorporated amounts of biotinylated primary amine into dimethylcasein (DMC) (Sigma), as described later. Screening Using Phage Display Random Peptide Library—An M13 Ph.D.-12 phage display system (New England Biolabs Inc.) was used for screening of preferred substrate sequences in both the TGase 2 and Factor XIIIa catalytic reactions. Approximately 1.5 × 1011 (1st-round panning) or 1 × 1012–13 (2nd-5th-round panning) phage clones were incubated at 37 °C with TGases in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl (TBS buffer) containing 1 mm DTT, 5 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm biotinylated cadaverine (Bio-Cd) (EZ-link™ 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine) (Pierce). To be included as a similar enzymatic activity in the reaction mixture, TGase 2 and Factor XIIIa were added at final concentrations of 0.5 and 5 ng/μl, respectively. In each screening round, TGase reaction was performed for 15, 10, and 2 min in reactions for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd–5th rounds, respectively. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 mm EDTA. Phage particles were then precipitated by addition of polyethylene glycol and NaCl to remove unbound Bio-Cd in the presence of salmon sperm DNA as a carrier. Next, phage clones that covalently incorporated Bio-Cd were selected by affinity chromatography using mono-avidin gel (SoftLink™ Soft Release Avidin Resin; Promega Corp.). After washing with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 2 mm EDTA four times and then with TBS twice, the bound phage clones were eluted by TBS containing 5 mm biotin. The entire eluate was used to infect early log phase ER2738 host bacteria, and the phages were amplified by culture for 4.5 h at 37 °C. The phage clones were concentrated by precipitation with polyethylene glycol-NaCl and then used for subsequent rounds. After panning five times in all, DNA sequences encoding the displayed peptide of selected phage clones were determined with an automated fluorescent sequencer, ABI PRISM 310, using a Bigdye™ terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (PE Applied Biosystems). Construction of Expression Vector for GST Fusion Proteins—The GST cDNA attached with EagI and XhoI sites was amplified by using the PCR method with an expression vector, pGEX4T-1 (Novagen Inc.), as a template and inserted into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). pCR2.1-GST(QN), which has point mutations at amino acid residues 15, 67, 188, 204, 207 (from glutamine to asparagine), was created by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis according to the instruction provided for the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For mutagenesis, the primers were synthesized to exchange the encoded sequences for glutamine residue, from CAA (Gln-15, Gln-188, and Gln-204) and CAG (Gln-67, Gln-207) to AAC (Asn). The DNA fragment encoding mutated GST excised from the pCR2.1-GST(QN) vector plasmid was inserted between the EagI and XhoI sites of the pET24d vector (Novagen Inc.). The resulting plasmid pET24d-GST(QN) was used to express modified GST fusion proteins attached with a hexahistidine tag at the C terminus. Each phage DNA was isolated by NaI and the ethanol precipitation method. The phage DNA fragment encoding the displayed 12-mer peptide and following GGGS peptide sequences were amplified by the PCR method using specific primers to attach NcoI at the 5′ terminus. Each PCR product was digested with NcoI and EagI, which exists in the internal sequence of phage DNA encoding GGGS. The NcoI and EagI fragment was then inserted into pET24d-GST(QN). The resulting plasmid was able to express the phage-displayed peptide at the N terminus. In recombinant proteins, the additional peptide sequence for MDSHS was attached at the N terminus of each peptide. The GST(QN) fusion proteins with several peptide sequences from previous reports were also expressed and purified, as described later. For example, the expression vector for GST(QN) fusion protein with TVQQEL, the target sequence from bovine crystalline (17Groenen P.J. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), was constructed using pET24d-GST(QN). Oligonucleotides encoding amino acid sequence (forward, 5′-CATGGATTCTCACTCTACTGTTCAACAAGAATTAGGTGGAGGTTC-3′; reverse, 5′-GGCCGAACCTCCACCTAATTCTTGTTGAACAGTAGAGTGAGAATC-3′) (underline indicates the sequence encoding for the target peptide) were annealed and inserted into the NcoI and EagI site of pET24d-GST(QN). In regard to the other previously reported sequence, oligonucleotides were synthesized similarly except for the DNA sequence encoding for the target peptides: α2-plasmin inhibitor (10Ichinose A.

Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)LysS was transformed with each constructed expression plasmid for GST(QN) fusion protein. Production in bacteria was induced with 1.0 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, and the recombinant proteins were purified from soluble fraction of the extract using the manufacturer's method with TALON metal affinity resin (BD Bioscience). The protein concentration of the purified protein was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Assessments of Substrate Preference in Transglutaminase Reaction—TGase reactivities of recombinant GST(QN) fusion proteins were evaluated by incorporation of monodansylcadaverine (Dansyl-Cd) (Sigma), a fluorometric-labeled cadaverine. The assay mixture was TBS buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT, 200 ng/μl of recombinant protein, and 0.5 mm Dansyl-Cd in the presence of either TGase 2 (0.5 ng/μl) or Factor XIIIa (5 ng/μl). As a standard, 200 ng/μl of DMC was used for each assessment. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C and then separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE. A fluorograph of the gel was obtained on a UV lightbox (254 nm) to detect the Dansyl-Cd incorporation. Fluorescence intensity was measured by scanning the photograph of the gel and analyzing with the imaging software SCION (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). In the case of incorporation assay using radiolabeled primary amine, [3H]putrescine (PerkinElmer Inc.) was used at a final concentration of 1.0 mm in the reaction mixture. Recombinant protein (1.6 μg/μl) was incubated with TGase 2 (4 ng/μl) or Factor XIIIa (40 ng/μl) in TBS buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm DTT. Reaction products were fixed on trichloroacetic acid-containing filters, which were washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid solution twice and then dried. Residual radioactivity on the filters was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. Substrate Assessment using Synthetic Peptides—Two representative 12-mer peptides (pepT26: HQSYVDPWMLDH) and (pepF11KA: DQMMLPWPAVAL) were purchased from Peptidesupport Inc. (Kitakyushu, Japan) in biotinylated form and confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography and time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The peptides were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at the final concentration of 100 mm as a stock solution. To evaluate substrate reactivity and specificity as synthetic peptides, microtiter plate assay was performed with some modification (31Slaughter T.F. Achyuthan K.E. Lai T.S. Greenberg C.S. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 32Wada F. Nakamura A. Masutani T. Ikura K. Maki M. Hitomi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3451-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 ng/μl of bovine casein (Nacalai Tesque Inc.) was incubated with each peptide at the concentration of 0.5 mm in the presence of TGase 2 (0.5 ng/μl) or Factor XIIIa (5 ng/μl) in TBS buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm DTT at 37 °C. At the indicated times, 50 μl of the reaction mixture was transferred to a microtiter 96-well plate (Maxisorp; Nunc) containing 50 μl of ice-cold 0.5 m EDTA. After reaction, the 96-well plate was incubated for 1 h at 37 °Cso that casein in the reaction mixture was attached to each well. The uncoated sites were blocked with skim milk in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) (Tris buffer). Each well was then washed once with Tris buffer alone. Diluted streptavidin peroxidase (Rockland) was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The wells were washed with Tris buffer containing 0.01% Triton X-100 once and then Tris buffer four times. Conjugation of streptavidin peroxidase into biotinylated peptide was measured by addition of H2O2 and O-phenylenediamine. An equal volume of 2.5 N H2SO4 was added, and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured. Analysis of Inhibitory Effect of Synthetic Peptides on Cross-linking Reaction—Bovine casein and human fibrinogen (Calbiochem) were used as appropriate substrates for TGase 2 and Factor XIIIa, respectively. In the latter case, bovine thrombin was co-incubated in the reaction mixture. Each substrate protein (200 ng/μl) was incubated with TGase 2 (0.5 ng/μl) or Factor XIII (5 ng/μl) in TBS buffer containing 1 mm DTT and 5 mm CaCl2 in the presence or absence of the peptides pepT26 and pepF11KA. The reaction products were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining. Establishment of a Screening System Using a Phage Display Random Peptide Library—A total of 1.5 × 1011 phage clones (displaying 12-mer peptides) were incubated with Bio-Cd in the presence of TGase 2 or Factor XIIIa. Following catalytic reactions, phage clones that had bound Bio-Cd covalently were selected by avidin affinity purification. These phages were subjected to four additional transamidation reaction/selection/amplification cycles. The TGase reaction time was shortened gradually with each amplification to increase the stringency of selection. Among the clones selected through multiple rounds, 40 and 35 phage clones were chosen arbitrarily from reactions of TGase 2 and Factor XIIIa, respectively. The nucleotide sequence encoding the peptide displayed by each clone was determined, and the amino acid sequences were deduced (Fig. 1, A and B). List of Identified Preferred Sequences—Sequence analysis indicated that 39 of the 40 clones selected in the TGase 2 screening contained a glutamine residue close to the N terminus. The clone that did not contain a glutamine residue was used as a negative control (Ctrl in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as described later).FIGURE 3Incorporation of labeled primary amine into peptide-GST fusion proteins by Factor XIIIa.

Incorporation patterns of Dansyl-Cd into GST(QN) fusion proteins of several glutamine donor peptides from previously identified substrates: NQQ (α2-plasmin inhibitor, NQQQVSPLTGLK), QQI (fibronectin, QQIV), PGG (fibronectin, PGGQQIV), GQD (trappin, GQDPVK), RPK (substance P, RPKPQQFFGLM), TVQ (αB-crystallin, TVQQEL), and TSE (β-endorphin, TSEKSQTPLVT). GST(QN) fusion proteins with T26 and F11 are also paralleled. Each fusion protein was reacted by TGase 2 (A) and Factor XIIIa (B). Experiments were performed as described in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Peptide sequences were aligned in relation to the potential reactive glutamine residue. Half of the clones were found to display sequences containing QxP (where x represents a non-conserved amino acid). The amino acid sequences obtained through the selection were divided into four groups: QxPϕD(P) (where ϕ represents a hydrophobic amino acid), QxPϕ, QxxϕDP, and sequences with no apparent motif. In reactions with Factor XIIIa, 28 of 35 clones selected contained glutamine residues, most of which were located in the second position from the N terminus. Alignment of the 28 clones resulted in division of the preferred peptide sequences into three groups. Half of the clones included the sequence QxxϕxWP, whereas the remainder contained Qxxϕ or no biased sequences. Evaluation of Preferred Sequences Using Recombinant Proteins—To evaluate the peptide sequences as glutamine donor substrates, we used labeled primary amine in the presence of TGase 2 or Factor XIIIa and measured the amount of binding to the glutamine residue. Dansyl-Cd, a fluorescence-labeled pentylamine, is widely used for transamidation activity assays. Its incorporation into substrate proteins separated by SDS-PAGE can be visualized using UV irradiation. We were unable to detect incorporation of Dansyl-Cd into phage particles, possibly because of the small amount of substrate peptide available for the reaction (data not shown). Therefore, the peptide sequences were produced in E. coli as recombinant GST fusion proteins. Because small amounts of Dansyl-Cd were incorporated into GST, we modified the GST to reduce its reaction with the primary amine. DNA substitutions were performed so that all glutamine residues (Gln-15, -67, -188, -204, and -207) present in GST were substituted with asparagines prior to construction of the expression vector. Consequently, the fusion proteins contained a modified GST (GST(QN)), as well as a hexahistidine tag at the C terminus (Fig. 2A). For analyses of the peptide-GST(QN) fusion proteins, sequences were selected from at least each group of motifs. Recombinant fusion proteins that were expressed and purified (Fig. 1, A and B, marked with an asterisk) were then incubated with Dansyl-Cd in the presence of either TGase 2 or Factor XIIIa. The time-dependent reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE, visualized under UV illumination, and then aligned (Fig. 2, TGase 2; Fig. 3, Factor XIIIa). Fluorescence intensity was measured and evaluated (Figs. 2C and 3B). In both transamidation reactions, DMC was used as a positive control, and the 10-min reaction products were used for standard values. The GST(QN) fusion proteins that were obtained in screening in the TGase 2 reactions and that did not contain any glutamine residues were used as a negative control (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Ctrl). In TGase 2 reactions, the level of incorporation of Dansyl-Cd into the fusion proteins increased with incubation time (Fig. 2). Comparison of the levels of incorporation between GST(QN) fusion proteins indicated that T1-GST(QN), T5-GST(QN), and T8-GST(QN) incorporated less Dansyl-Cd than either T26-GST(QN) or T29-GST(QN), which reacted strongly. In contrast, in the reaction with Factor XIIIa, most GST(QN) fusion proteins with selected sequences showed significant levels (Fig. 3). Fused proteins of F6, -11, -12, -13, -16, and -19, which belong to the major group (motif: QxxϕxWP), showed apparent reactivity. Among them, F11-GST(QN) exhibited the greatest level. Although F17 and F28 sequences partly coincided with the sequence motif in the major group, both also showed considerable levels. Evaluation of Specificities for TGase 2 and Factor XIIIa—To evaluate isozyme specificity, the GST(QN) fusion proteins were reacted in the presence of TGase 2 or Factor XIIIa. After a 10-min incubation, the reaction products were analyzed (Fig. 4, A and B, respecti"

We hypothesized that IUGR resulting from maternal hypoxia or nutrient restriction during late gestation will produce cardiac remodeling and impair cardiac recovery after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in adult male offspring aged 4 or 7 mo. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized on day 15 of pregnancy to hypoxia (IUGR-H, 12% oxygen), nutrient restriction (IUGR-NR, 40% of control diet) or control (room air) groups. In 4-mo IUGR-H offspring, left ventricular wt/body wt ratio (LVW/BW) and right ventricular wt/BW ratio (RVW/BW) increased, in association with increased collagen I and III expression, beta and alpha myosin heavy chain (beta/alphaMHC) ratio, and decreased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 activity compared to the other groups. Left ventricular end diastolic pressure was higher in perfused hearts. Functional recovery after I/R was remarkably reduced (10+/-3%) compared to both control (39+/-5%) and IUGR-NR rats (32+/-4%). At 7 mo, both IUGR-H and IUGR-NR offspring had increased LVW/BW, collagen I and III, beta/alpha MHC ratio, and decreased cardiac recovery and MMP-2 activity compared to control. These findings suggest that hypoxia or undernutrition during development leads to pathological cardiac remodeling, diastolic dysfunction, and increased sensitivity to ischemic injury during adult life."
https://openalex.org/W2061271252,"Aldosterone is a major regulator of epithelial Na(+) absorption and acts in large part through induction of the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) gene in the renal collecting duct. We previously identified Dot1a as an aldosterone early repressed gene and a repressor of ENaCalpha transcription through mediating histone H3 Lys-79 methylation associated with the ENaCalpha promoter. Here, we report a novel aldosterone-signaling network involving AF9, Dot1a, and ENaCalpha. AF9 and Dot1a interact in vitro and in vivo as evidenced in multiple assays and colocalize in the nuclei of mIMCD3 renal collecting duct cells. Overexpression of AF9 results in hypermethylation of histone H3 Lys-79 at the endogenous ENaCalpha promoter at most, but not all subregions examined, repression of endogenous ENaCalpha mRNA expression and acts synergistically with Dot1a to inhibit ENaCalpha promoter-luciferase constructs. In contrast, RNA interference-mediated knockdown of AF9 causes the opposite effects. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays reveal that overexpressed FLAG-AF9, endogenous AF9, and Dot1a are each associated with the ENaCalpha promoter. Aldosterone negatively regulates AF9 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Thus, Dot1a-AF9 modulates histone H3 Lys-79 methylation at the ENaCalpha promoter and represses ENaCalpha transcription in an aldosterone-sensitive manner. This mechanism appears to be more broadly applicable to other aldosterone-regulated genes because overexpression of AF9 alone or in combination with Dot1a inhibited mRNA levels of three other known aldosterone-inducible genes in mIMCD3 cells."

However, it is still unclear whether a reduction of the catabolic activity of Aβ in the brain causes neuronal dysfunction in vivo. In the present study, to clarify a possible connection between a reduction in neprilysin activity and impairment of synaptic and cognitive functions, we cross-bred amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice (APP23) with neprilysin-deficient mice and biochemically and immunoelectron-microscopically analyzed Aβ accumulation in the brain.

We present direct experimental evidence that reduced activity of neprilysin, the major Aβ-degrading enzyme, in the brain elevates oligomeric forms of Aβ at the synapses and leads to impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognitive function before the appearance of amyloid plaque load. Thus, reduced neprilysin activity appears to be a causative event that is at least partly responsible for the memory-associated symptoms of Alzheimer disease.

NEP+/+APP+ and NEP–/–APP+ littermates were produced by breeding NEP+/–APP– and NEP+/–APP+ mice. All mice were on the same genetic background (C57BL/6J). In all experiments mice were analyzed at the age of 13–16 weeks. They were housed in plastic cages, received food (CE2, Clea Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan) and water ad libitum, and were maintained on a 12/12-h light-dark cycle (lights on at 09:00, off at 21:00). Western Blotting—The cerebral hemispheres were homogenized in 3 volumes (w/v) of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™, Roche Diagnostics) supplemented with 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan). The homogenates were centrifuged at 200,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min using an Optima TL ultracentrifuge and a TLA100.4 rotor (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). The clear supernatants were used for analyzing levels of secreted forms of APP (sAPP). The pellet (membrane fraction) was suspended with the above buffer and used for analyzing levels of murine and human full-length APPs. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). We separated equivalent amounts of protein of the membrane or supernatant fraction in each lane by 5–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred them electrophoretically to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Hybond™-P, Amersham Biosciences). To detect full-length APP, sAPP (N-terminal fragments) and C-terminal fragments of APP (CTF-β, -α, and -γ/ϵ), we probed the blots with 22C11 (0.2 μg/ml; Chemicon, Temecula, CA), 6E10 (1.0 μg/ml; Signet Laboratories, Inc., Dedham, MA), a rabbit polyclonal antibody against synthetic peptide CISEVNL, the 5 C-terminal amino acids of APP Swedish (βNL; 1.0 μg/ml), and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal of APP (A8717, Sigma) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences).

Immunoreactive protein content in each sample was calculated based on a standard curve constructed with one of the samples. Each set of experiments was repeated at least three times to confirm the results. The protein levels of α-tubulin and β-actin as housekeeping genes or commonly expressed proteins were also measured by quantitative Western blotting using anti-α-tubulin (DM 1A, Sigma) and anti-β-actin (AC-15, Sigma) antibodies, respectively, to confirm that equal amounts of total protein were extracted. To analyze monomeric or oligomeric status of Aβ by Western blot, homogenate from cerebral hemispheres was delipidized with chloroform:methanol (2:1) and chloroform:methanol:distilled water (1:2:0.8) sequentially to improve sensitivity, as described by Morishima-Kawashima et al. (34Morishima-Kawashima M. Oshima N. Ogata H. Yamaguchi H. Yoshimura M. Sugihara S. Ihara Y. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 2093-2099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The resultant protein fraction was evaporated and then solubilized with a sample buffer containing 4 m urea. Samples (20–40 μg) were separated by 5–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were boiled in phosphate-buffered saline for 3 min to gain high sensitivity. The blot was probed with 6E10 followed by the ABC method (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). An immunoreactive band on the membrane was visualized with a Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the band intensity was determined as described above. Immunoreactive neprilysin content in each sample was calculated based on a standard curve constructed with synthesized Aβ1–42 (Bachem AG, Bubendorf, Switzerland) that was linear in the range of 0.15–2.4 ng. Aβ Quantitation—The cerebral hemispheres were homogenized in 3 volumes (w/v) of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 150 mm NaCl and the protease inhibitor mixture (TBS) with a Teflon-glass homogenizer and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was defined as the soluble (TBS-extractable) fraction, and guanidine/HCl was added to give a final concentration of 0.5 m before ELISA. The pellet was solubilized by sonication in 6 m guanidine/HCl buffer containing the protease inhibitor mixture. The solubilized pellet was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, after which the supernatant was diluted 12 times to reduce the concentration of guanidine-HCl and used as the insoluble fraction. The amounts of AβX-40 and AβX-42 in each fraction were determined by sandwich ELISA (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoelectron Microscopic (IEM) Study—IEM was carried out as previously described (35Kokubo H. Kayed R. Glabe C.G. Yamaguchi H. Brain Res. 2005; 1031: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The mice (NEP+/+APP+, n = 3; NEP–/– APP+, n = 3) were perfused with a fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde after being deeply anesthetized with diethyl ether inhalation, then the brain tissue samples were immersed in a fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde for 3 days, osmified, and embedded in epoxy resin. First, we cut semi-thin (0.5 μm) sections of several samples from each subject to select appropriate areas, such as the CA1 region of the hippocampus and the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (OML), for IEM study. Next, we cut serial ultrathin (100-nm thick) sections and placed the sections on nickel grids for IEM. Ultrathin sections on the nickel grid were etched with 1% H2O2 for 1 min then 1% periodic acid solution for 1 min. After blocking with 5% normal goat serum, the sections were incubated overnight at room temperature with affinity-purified, oligomer-specific polyclonal antibody (4 μg/ml; A11, BIOSOURCE), which has been well characterized and specifically recognizes the oligomeric state of Aβ (36Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3381) Google Scholar). The sections were then incubated with the 5-nm gold-tagged goat anti-rabbit IgG (Fc) (1:20, Amersham Biosciences; RPN 420) for 2 h at room temperature. The sections were then fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.2 m phosphate buffer for 10 min. The EM sections on grids were stained briefly with conventional uranyl acetate and lead citrate. For the control study of IEM, the ultrathin sections were incubated with the normal rabbit IgG. There was no staining of the sections incubated with the normal rabbit IgG. IEM sections were observed under an electron microscope (100CXII, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). We randomly took photographs of each region of each subject at the same magnification (NEP+/+APP+ CA1, 63 photos; NEP–/–APP+ CA1, 62 photos; NEP+/+APP+ OML, 82 photos; NEP–/–APP+ OML, 83 photos). The magnification of photo prints (15.8 × 11.4 cm) was ×30,000, and the actual size of each print was 19.8 μm2. We identified the localization of oligomer immunoreactions (oligomer-IRs) in the neuropils, such as axons, axonal terminals, dendrites, glial processes and unidentified processes and counted the number of oligomer-IRs per photo print (field). We counted a site having 2 or more 5-nm gold particles as one oligomer-IR. Electrophysiological Procedures—Mice were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of 50 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital and placed on a stereotaxic device. Core body temperature was monitored and maintained at 35 ± 0.5 °C via a heating pad with a thermoprobe placed in the rectum of the mouse. The skull was exposed, and small holes were drilled at the sites where recording and stimulating electrodes were to be positioned. To maintain a constant depth of anesthetization, mice were given sodium pentobarbital (8 mg/kg) intramuscularly every 30 min beginning 40 min after the first injection. Glass recording electrodes (tip resistance of 1–3 megohms) were filled with saline. The electrode for the extracellular field potential recording was inserted into the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region of hippocampus (2.2 mm posterior to bregma, 1.25 mm lateral to midline, and 1.0–1.5 mm ventral to the brain surface) or in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus (2.1 mm posterior to bregma, 1.5 mm lateral to midline, and a 1.8–2.0-mm depth to the surface). For stimulation in the CA1 region, a platinum coaxial bipolar stimulating electrode with a tip diameter of 25 μm was positioned in the stratum radiatum to stimulate the Schaffer collateral/commissural pathway (1.5 mm posterior to bregma, 2.0 mm lateral to midline, and 1.0–1.5 mm ventral to the brain surface). For stimulation in the dentate gyrus region, the same electrode was positioned in the angular bundle (3.0 mm lateral to lambda and a 1.25–1.5-mm depth to the surface). A reference electrode was attached to the skin of the animal's head. For recordings in the CA1, stimulus intensity was adjusted to produce an average field excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) amplitude of 1 mV, which was not larger than 1/3 of the maximum amplitude. For recordings in the dentate gyrus, we used a stimulation strength that evokes a population spike of 2–3 mV on the field EPSP. After 15–30 min of base-line stimulation at a frequency of 0.033 Hz, tetanic stimulation was delivered to each stimulation site. For LTP induction in the CA1 region, one set of four tetanal trains (50 pulses, 100 Hz) with a 10-s intertrain interval was used, and for the dentate gyrus region 1 tetanal train (100 pulses, 100 Hz) was used. Field EPSPs were monitored and analyzed using a computer-based data acquisition system. The magnitude of potentiation was expressed as the percentage of base line of the maximal slope of EPSPs in the CA1 and of the population spike amplitudes in the dentate gyrus, respectively. Before recording LTP, we generated input/output curves by gradually increasing the intensity of the stimulation in both the CA1 and the dentate gyrus. We also recorded paired pulse facilitation evoked with an interpulse interval of 30, 50, and 100 ms. The intensity of stimulation for paired pulse facilitation was adjusted to evoke ∼1 mV of first field EPSP amplitude. Behavioral Analysis—A battery of behavioral tests representing hippocampus-dependent learning and memory functions was carried out sequentially for the mice at the age of 13–16 weeks according to the experimental schedule (see supplemental Fig. 1), which was designed to minimize stress for the mice. First, a Y-maze test was carried out using animals 13 weeks old. The maze was made of black painted wood; each arm was 40 cm long, 12 cm high, 3 cm wide at the bottom, and 10 cm wide at the top. The arms converged at an equilateral triangular central area that was 4 cm at its longest axis. Each mouse was placed at the center of apparatus and allowed to move freely through the maze during an 8-min session. The frequency of arm entries was recorded visually. Alternation was defined as successive entry into the three arms on overlapping triplet sets. The alternation behavior (%) was calculated as the ratio of actual alternations to possible alternations (defined as the number of arm entries minus two) multiplied by 100. The novel-object recognition test (37Nagai T. Yamada K. Kim H.C. Kim Y.S. Noda Y. Imura A. Nabeshima Y. Nabeshima T. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 50-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) was started the day after the Y-maze test. Mice were individually habituated to an open-field box (30 × 30 × 35 (high) cm) for 3 days. During the training session two novel objects were placed into the open field, and the animals were allowed to explore for 10 min. The time spent exploring each object and total approach time were recorded. During retention sessions the animals were placed back into the same box 24 h after a training session, in which one of the familiar objects used during training was replaced by a novel object and allowed to explore freely for 10 min. A preference index, a ratio of the amount of time spent exploring any one of the two objects (training session) or the novel object (retention session) over the total time spent exploring both objects was used to measure recognition memory. The Morris water maze test was conducted in a circular pool of a 1.2-m diameter and filled with water at a temperature of 22.0 ± 1°C as described previously (38Manabe T. Noda Y. Mamiya T. Katagiri H.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2418-2426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In a hidden platform test, a platform (7 cm in diameter) was submerged 1 cm below water level. Swimming paths were tracked with a camera fixed on the ceiling of the room and stored in a computer (Etho Vision system, Neuroscience·idea Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan). The mice were given 2 trials (1 block) per day for 7 consecutive days during which the platform was left in the same position. The time taken to locate the escape platform (escape latency, s), swimming distance (cm), and swimming velocity were determined in each trial. Twenty-four hours after the last training trial the mice were given a transfer test without the platform, and they were given 60 s to search for the pool. In the visible-platform test, the black platform (7 cm in diameter) was located 1 cm below water level. Contextual fear conditioning test (37Nagai T. Yamada K. Kim H.C. Kim Y.S. Noda Y. Imura A.

For measuring the basal level of freezing response (preconditioning phase) mice were individually placed in the conditioning cage (25 × 31 × 11 (high) cm) for 2 min. For training (conditioning phase) mice were placed in the conditioning cage, and then a 15-s foot shock of 0.6 mA was delivered through a shock generator (Neuroscience·idea Co. Ltd.). This procedure was repeated 4 times with 25-s intervals. One day after fear conditioning, mice were placed in the conditioning cage, and the freezing response was measured for 2 min. Statistical Analysis—All data were expressed as means ± S.E. For comparisons of the means between 2 groups, statistical analysis was performed by applying Student's t test after confirming equality between the variances of the groups. If the variances were unequal, Mann-Whitney U tests were performed. Comparisons of the"
https://openalex.org/W2017808636,"Synaptic cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are known to play key roles in various aspects of synaptic structures and functions, including early differentiation, maintenance, and plasticity. We herein report the identification of a family of cell adhesion-like molecules termed SALM that interacts with the abundant postsynaptic density (PSD) protein PSD-95. SALM2, a SALM isoform, distributes to excitatory, but not inhibitory, synaptic sites. Overexpression of SALM2 increases the number of excitatory synapses and dendritic spines. Mislocalized expression of SALM2 disrupts excitatory synapses and dendritic spines. Bead-induced direct aggregation of SALM2 results in coclustering of PSD-95 and other postsynaptic proteins, including GKAP and AMPA receptors. Knockdown of SALM2 by RNA interference reduces the number of excitatory synapses and dendritic spines and the frequency, but not amplitude, of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. These results suggest that SALM2 is an important regulator of the differentiation of excitatory synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2138600516,"Axon terminals from the two eyes initially overlap in the dorsal-lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) but subsequently refine to occupy nonoverlapping territories. Retinal activity is required to establish and maintain this segregation. We show that despite the presence of retinal activity, segregated projections desegregate when the structure of activity is altered. Early in development, spontaneous retinal activity in the no b-wave (nob) mouse is indistinguishable from that of wild-type mice, and eye-specific segregation proceeds normally. But, around eye-opening, spontaneous and visually evoked activity in nob retinas become abnormal, coincident with a failure to preserve precise eye-specific territories. Dark-rearing studies suggest that altered visual experience is not responsible. Transgenic rescue of the mutated protein (nyctalopin) within nob retinal interneurons, without rescuing expression in either retinal projection neurons or their postsynaptic targets in the dLGN, restores spontaneous retinal activity patterns and prevents desegregation. Thus, normally structured spontaneous retinal activity stabilizes newly refined retinogeniculate circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W2024249768,"The μ- and m-calpain proteases have been implicated in both pro- or anti-apoptotic functions. Here we compared cell death responses and apoptotic or survival signaling pathways in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from wild type or capn4 knock-out mice which lack both μ- and m-calpain activities. Capn4–/– MEFs displayed resistance to puromycin, camptothecin, etoposide, hydrogen peroxide, ultraviolet light, and serum starvation, which was consistent with pro-apoptotic roles for calpain. In contrast, capn4–/– MEFs were more susceptible to staurosporine (STS) and tumor necrosis factor α-induced cell death, which provided evidence for anti-apoptotic signaling roles for calpain. Bax activation, release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 all correlated with the observed cell death responses of wild type or capn4–/– MEFs to the various challenges, suggesting that calpain might play distinct roles in transducing different death signals to the mitochondria. There was no evidence that calpain cleaved Bcl-2 family member proteins that regulate mitochondrial membrane permeability including Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, Bad, Bak, Bid, or Bim. However, activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3)-kinase/Akt survival signaling pathway was compromised in capn4–/– MEFs under all challenges regardless of the cell death outcome, and blocking Akt activation using the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 abolished the protective effect of calpain to STS challenge. We conclude that the anti-apoptotic function of calpain in tumor necrosis factor α- and STS-challenged cells relates to a novel role in activating the PI3-kinase/Akt survival pathway.

We conclude that the anti-apoptotic function of calpain in tumor necrosis factor α- and STS-challenged cells relates to a novel role in activating the PI3-kinase/Akt survival pathway. Apoptosis provides an important mechanism to eliminate cells during development and ontogeny and to maintain tissue homeostasis in the adult organism. Apoptosis can be induced by the activation of plasma membrane death receptors (extrinsic pathway) or by various stimuli that disturb intracellular functions required to maintain the integrity of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (intrinsic pathway). Defective apoptotic cell death contributes to autoimmune diseases and tumorigenesis, whereas increased apoptosis is often associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer, Huntington, and Parkinson diseases (1Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6211) Google Scholar).Biochemical and genetic studies have established that apoptosis can be initiated and executed by caspases, a family of cysteine proteases (2Fuentes-Prior P. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 201-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Initiator caspases, like caspase-8 and -10, are activated by death receptors including TNFα 2The abbreviations used are: TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MMP, mitochondrial membrane permeability; PARP, polyADP-ribose polymerase; STS, staurosporine; HU, hydroxyl urea; UV, ultraviolet; ALLN, N-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-l-norleucinal; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. 2The abbreviations used are: TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MMP, mitochondrial membrane permeability; PARP, polyADP-ribose polymerase; STS, staurosporine; HU, hydroxyl urea; UV, ultraviolet; ALLN, N-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-l-norleucinal; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. and FAS, whereas caspase-12 is activated by endoplasmic reticulum stress, and caspase-9 is activated at the apoptosome by a mechanism involving Apaf-1 and cytochrome c (3Kidd V.J. Lahti J.M. Teitz T. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 4Willis S.N. Adams J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Initiator caspases can in turn activate executioner caspases, such as caspase-3 and caspase-7. Other important players include the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak, which control mitochondrial membrane permeability (MMP) and the release of cytochrome c, which is required to activate caspase-9 at the apoptosome. In the resting state Bax and Bak are under the suppression of Bcl-2. Upon death signaling, BH3-only proteins including Bim, Bad, and Bid are activated by transcriptional regulation or post-translational modification, which directly prompt Bax and Bak activation, leading to MMP and release of cytochrome c (4Willis S.N. Adams J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 5Scorrano L. Korsmeyer S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Calcium also plays a pivotal role in apoptosis. The release of calcium from the ER triggered mitochondria calcium overload, which directly contributed to MMP and release of cytochrome c, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase, and apoptosis-inducing factor (6Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3290) Google Scholar). Bax and Bak also control the resting calcium concentration in the ER. Cells deficient in Bax and Bak were found to have a reduced resting ER calcium concentration that resulted in decreased uptake of calcium by mitochondria after calcium release from the ER and lack of apoptosis (7Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Opferman J.T. Cheng E.H. Sorcinelli M.D. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). Interestingly, released cytochrome c was shown to bind to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors on the ER resulting in sustained, oscillatory cytosolic calcium increases. This resulted in augmented cytochrome c release, which amplified the apoptotic signal in a feed-forward fashion (8Boehning D. Patterson R.L. Sedaghat L. Glebova N.O. Kurosaki T. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1051-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). On the other hand, anti-apoptotic Bcl-xl interacts with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors, which reduces ER calcium content and stimulates mitochondrial energetics, therefore protecting cells against apoptosis (9White C. Li C. Yang J. Petrenko N.B. Madesh M. Thompson C.B. Foskett J.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Besides prompting cytochrome c release, elevated cytosolic calcium levels exert other effects on apoptosis. For example, calcium activates calcinerin, which dephosphorylates p-Bad and causes its translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondria leading to activation of Bax (10Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6417-6420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).The ubiquitous calpains can also be activated by calcium influx, and they too participate in many steps of apoptosis. Calpains are a family of calcium-dependent intracellular cysteine proteases, including the ubiquitously expressed μ- and m-calpains as well as a number of distinct tissue-specific calpains (for review, see Ref. 11Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). μ- and m-calpains are both heterodimers consisting of a distinct large 80-kDa catalytic subunit encoded by the genes capn1 and capn2, respectively, and a common small 28-kDa regulatory subunit encoded by capn4. Biochemical analysis has revealed that the small subunit is indispensable for μ- and m-calpain, and genetic disruption of capn4 abolished the activity of both calpains (12Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) 3Tan, Y., Dourdin, N., Wu, C., de Veyra, T., Elce, J. S., and Greer P. A., (2006) Genesis, in press. 3Tan, Y., Dourdin, N., Wu, C., de Veyra, T., Elce, J. S., and Greer P. A., (2006) Genesis, in press.. Interestingly, in vitro m-calpain activity requires calcium at the millimolar range, whereas micromolar concentrations activate μ-calpain. These calcium levels are not likely to be achieved in vivo; however, highly localized concentrations of calcium might occur transiently in close proximity to ion channels or the ER during stress. Calpains are also negatively regulated by the endogenously expressed peptide inhibitor calpastatin, and overexpression of recombinant calpastain has been used to inhibit endogenous calpain activity (14Lu T. Xu Y. Mericle M.T. Mellgren R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1590: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Calpain has emerged as an important player in cell death signaling.

All of these approaches have inherent pitfalls that have confused our understanding of the role of calpain in cell death signaling. To address the physiologic functions of calpain during apoptosis, we have subjected primary embryonic fibroblasts from wild type and capn4–/– knock-out mice (12Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) to a wide range of cell death stimuli and examined several key apoptosis and survival pathways. Our results show that calpain plays pro-apoptotic roles in responses to puromycin, camptothecin, etoposide, hydrogen peroxide, ultraviolet light, and serum starvation but that it plays anti-apoptotic roles in cells challenged with TNFα or staurosporine (STS). Activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase/AKT survival pathway was correlated with calpain expression in all cell death challenges. This provides novel evidence for an important role for calpain in regulation of a key pro-survival pathway.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals and Antibodies—STS, TNFα, etoposide, camptothecin, hydroxyurea (HU), cyclohexamide, puromycin, propidium iodide, and acridine orange were purchased from Sigma.

Carcasses were treated with 0.25% collagenase in 20% fetal bovine serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 37 °C, and after centrifugation, the cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics (penicillin, 100 units/ml; streptomycin, 100 μg/ml), and 2 mm l-glutamine. Primary MEFs were used before passage 4.Apoptosis Analysis—MEFs were seeded at 3 × 105/6-cm plate and cultured overnight before use.

Cells with decreased red fluorescence (pale cells) were quantified.Western Blotting—Cells were collected at the indicated times post-treatment. Medium was aspirated, and cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cell monolayers were incubated in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml of leupeptin) on ice for 15 min. Lysates were recovered by scraping and centrifuged to remove particulate debris. Protein content was determined by the Bradford method. Samples (20 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunoblots were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight, then incubated with secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for 60 min at room temperature. Signals were then developed by enhanced chemiluminescence using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences).Release of Cytochrome c and Activation of Bax—Monolayers of 2 × 106 cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, then harvested by scraping and centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was suspended in 600 μl of extraction buffer containing 220 mm mannitol, 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 50 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). After 30 min of incubation on ice, cells were subjected to 80 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer and spun for 60 min at 14,000 × g. Supernatants were analyzed for cytochrome c release by Western blotting (30Hirpara J.L. Seyed M.A. Loh K.W. Dong H. Kini R.M. Pervaiz S. Blood. 2000; 95: 1773-1780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of active Bax was as described (31Murphy K.M. Streips U.N. Lock R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17225-17228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed using CHAPS lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS, plus protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin)), then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was immunoprecipitated using monoclonal anti-Bax 6A7 and protein G-agarose and nutated overnight at 4 °C. The complexes were then washed five times with CHAP lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-Bax antibody, as described above.In Vitro Analysis of μ- and m-Calpain Activities—Calpain activities in cell extracts were detected by casein zymography in a standard Tris-glycine system (25Dourdin N. Bhatt A.K. Dutt P. Greer P.A. Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Huttenlocher A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48382-48388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). 40 μg of protein was resolved on 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 1.5 mg/ml casein. Calpain was activated by incubating the gels overnight with 5 mm Ca2+, and its activity was visualized as areas cleared of casein after staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.Statistical Analysis—Results were expressed as the means ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test, with a level of significance set at p < 0.05.RESULTSUbiquitous Calpains Have Both Pro- and Anti-apoptotic Functions—Calcium-regulated μ- and m-calpain activities have been implicated in many cellular signaling pathways, including apoptosis. However, much of the literature supporting this hypothesis relies on pharmacological inhibitors of questionable specificity or effectiveness. To avoid those problems we employed primary MEFs derived from a mouse knock-out model of calpain (12Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the capn4 gene abolished expression of the small regulatory subunit (Fig. 1, panel B). Casein zymography analysis of calpain activity demonstrated loss of both μ-calpain and m-calpain activities in capn4–/– MEFs (Fig. 1A). Immunoblotting analysis showed that steady state levels of both μ-80 and m-80 catalytic subunits were dramatically reduced in capn4–/– MEFs (Fig. 1, panels C and B, respectively). These observations support the hypothesis that the capn4-encoded 28-kDa subunit is required for the stability and activity of the μ-calpain and m-calpain catalytic subunits, μ-80 and m-80 respectively, and this demonstrates that capn4–/– MEFs are devoid of detectable calpain activity.These primary wild type and capn4–/– MEFs were then used to explore the involvement of the ubiquitous calpains in response to challenges with different death stimuli (Fig. 2). Statistically significant differences in cell death responses, as assessed by trypan blue staining, were seen with a number of different challenges (Fig. 2A). The translation inhibitor puromycin, the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin, the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide, serum deprivation, ultraviolet light (UV), or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induced significantly more cell death in wild type than in capn4–/– MEFs. In contrast, more cell death occurred in capn4–/– than wild type MEFs after challenge with either the death receptor ligand TNFα or the broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor STS. These results indicated that calpain plays pro-apoptotic roles in apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation, DNA damage, reactive oxygen species, and translation inhibition but that calpain plays anti-apoptotic roles in apoptotic signaling induced by TNFα or STS.FIGURE 2Calpain deficiency results in differential apoptotic outcomes in response to different death stimuli. A, primary wild type (P-wt) and calpain deficient (P-capn4–/–) MEFs were subjected to serum starvation (starv), 80 J/m2 UV, 100 μm etoposide (etop), 5 μm campthecin (camp), 2 mm HU, 4 μm puromycin (puro), TNF (10 ng/ml TNFα plus 200 ng/ml cyclohexamide (CHX)), 100 nm H2O2, 500 nm STS, 5 μm c6-ceramide (ceram) for the indicated times. con, control. The percentage of trypan blue stained dead cells was determined. Shown is Western blotting analysis of full-length and caspase-3-cleaved PARP in cells treated with puromycin and camptothecin (B), etoposide and UV (C), ceramide and HU (D), serum starvation and H2O2 (E), TNFα (F), and STS (G). Data points with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) are indicated (*).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Analysis of PARP cleavage was also used to assess activation of the executor caspase-3 in response to these challenges (Fig. 2, panels B–G). The degree of PARP cleavage in response to all challenges correlated precisely with the observed cell death response. Although HU-induced cell death did not show a statistically significant difference, there was an apparent increase in PARP cleavage in wild type relative to capn4–/– MEFs. No significant cell death was observed in wild type or capn4–/– MEFs in response to ceramide treatment, and this correlated with the observed absence of PARP cleavage.Phosphatidylserine exposure on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and DNA degradation were also examined as indicators of cell death responses (32Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Frasch S.C. Warner M.L. Henson P.M. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). In response to puromycin, wild type MEFs displayed reduced annexin-V association with external phosphatidylserine and fewer numbers of cells with a sub-G1 DNA content in comparison with capn4–/– MEFs (Fig. 3, panels A and B, respectively). The opposite responses were observed in response to TNFα or STS treatment.FIGURE 3Flow cytometry analysis of cell death in response to puromycin, STS, and TNFα. A, 7-amino-actinomycin/annexin-V staining of primary wild type (P-wt) and calpain-deficient (P-capn4–/–) MEFs cultured under control conditions (con) or after puromycin (puro), STS, or TNF for 12, 24, and 12 h, respectively.

The puromycin-induced release of cytochrome c was attenuated in capn4–/– MEFs relative to wild type cells, and this correlated with reduced activation of Bax, caspase-9, caspase-3, and reduced PARP cleavage. In contrast, cytochrome c release in response to TNFα or STS treatment was enhanced in the capn4–/– MEFs relative to wild type cells. Consistent with this, we observed more activation of Bax, caspase-9, and caspase-3 and more PARP cleavage in TNFα- or STS-challenged capn4–/– MEFs compared with wild type cells.FIGURE 4Activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. A, PARP cleavage, caspase-3 activation, caspase-9 activation, release of cytochrome c, and activation of Bax were assessed by Western blotting analysis in primary wild type (P-wt) and calpain deficient (P-capn4–/–) MEFs after treatment with puromycin (Puro), STS, and TNFα for the indicated times. con, control.

Furthermore, these results suggest roles for calpain at points upstream of MMP. Calpains have been implicated in the cleavage of a number of Bcl-2 family members that regulate MMP; however, we observed no evidence for this in response to puromycin, TNFα, or STS. The relative levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, Bad, Bak, Bid (Fig. 4, panel B), and Bim (data not shown) were indistinguishable between wild type and capn4–/– MEFs during these cell death challenges.

https://openalex.org/W1969514860,"Dorsal visual cortical areas are thought to be dominated by input from the magnocellular (M) visual pathway, with little or no parvocellular (P) contribution. These relationships are supported by a close correlation between the functional properties of these areas and the M pathway and by a lack of anatomical evidence for P input. Here we use rabies virus as a retrograde transynaptic tracer to show that the dorsal area MT receives strong input, via a single relay, from both M and P cells of the lateral geniculate nucleus. This surprising P input, likely relayed via layer 6 Meynert cells in primary visual cortex, can provide MT with sensitivity to a more complete range of spatial, temporal, and chromatic cues than the M pathway alone. These observations provide definitive evidence for P pathway input to MT and show that convergence of parallel visual pathways occurs in the dorsal stream."

These data indicated that, contrary to the pro-apoptotic function of GADD45 in epithelial and endothelial cells, in hematopoietic cells both Gadd45a and Gadd45b play a survival role against genotoxic stress.The present study was undertaken to decipher the molecular paths that mediate the survival functions of Gadd45a and Gadd45b against genotoxic stress induced by UV radiation. The findings presented are novel, showing that in hematopoietic cells exposed to UV radiation Gadd45a and Gadd45b cooperate to promote cell survival via two distinct signaling pathways involving activation of p38 and inhibition of JNK activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Antibodies—rIL-3 was purchased from R&D Systems; other recombinant cytokines (rIL-6 and rSCF) were generous gifts from Amgen Inc.

Antibody against phospho-MKK7 was purchased from Upstate Cell Signaling. Antibodies against GADD45a, GADD45b, β-actin, and cIAP were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA).Mice—Generation, genotyping, and use of WT, Gadd45a–/–, and Gadd45b–/– mice and age-matched littermates were as described before (23Gupta M. Gupta S.K. Balliet A.G. Hollander M.C. Fornace A.J. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7170-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Mice were housed at the animal facility at Temple University and used at the age of 6–8 weeks with an approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Protocol that followed the recommendations of the Panel on Euthanasia of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Both Gadd45a–/– and Gadd45b–/– mice were maintained in a mixed (BL6/129VJ) genetic background and propagated using heterozygous breeding pairs.Bone Marrow Culture—For each experiment indicated, Gadd45a–/–, Gadd45b–/–, and their wild-type littermate mice (6–8-weeks old), were sacrificed and both the femurs were removed. Bone marrow (BM) cells were flushed from each femur and cultured in IMDM. For all indicated experiments, BM cells were cultured in IMDM (with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and supplemented with growth factors (rIL-3 (10 ng/ml), rSCF (25 ng/ml), rIL-6 (10 ng/ml)) and cultured for 48 h at 37 °C in humidified atmosphere with 10% CO2 prior to treatment with UV radiation. Cytospin preparations of the BM cells, following culturing as indicated, have shown that >90% of the cell population consisted of myeloid cells at the blast and early intermediate stages of differentiation for all the genotypes.Retroviral Transduction of BM Cells—Transduction of BM cells was done as previously described (23Gupta M. Gupta S.K. Balliet A.G. Hollander M.C. Fornace A.J. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7170-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, MIGW-Gadd45a and MIGW-Gadd45b retroviral constructs were generated in this laboratory. Infectious virus particles were produced by transient transfection of amphotropic Phoenix™ retroviral packaging cells (Orbigen, San Diego, CA) with the retroviral plasmids. Retroviral supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection. BM cells were cultured in IMDM medium supplemented with high growth factors Flt-3 ligand (100 ng/ml), rSCF(50 ng/ml), rIL-6 (10 ng/ml), and rIL-3 (25 ng/ml) at 37 °C for 48 h. Subsequently, cells were resuspended in virus supernatant in the presence of polybrene (8 μg/ml) and plated on retronectin-coated plates. Cells were harvested after 72 h and washed, and efficiency of infections was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Cultures were sorted for fluorescent cells (GFP positive) by FACS (BD FACSAria); the sorted cells were collected into the BM culture medium and returned to the CO2 incubator immediately after sorting. After a couple hours of recovery, cells were exposed to UV radiation (25 J/m2), and at indicated time points cell extracts were prepared for Western blot analysis using JNK and p38 phospho-specific antibodies. At 24 h the fraction of apoptotic cells was identified using Annexin V conjugated to PE (fluorescence emission spectra read in FL-2).Western Blot Analysis—BM cells cultured for 48 h as indicated above were exposed to UVC (25J/m2) and cultured for various times, as indicated in the appropriate figures and figure legends. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 1× lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protein content was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent. 50 μg of total protein was resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane; membrane was then blocked using 5% nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline-T. Blocked membranes were then probed with antibodies as indicated and subsequently incubated with 1:2500 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Blots were developed using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). For reprobing, membranes were stripped by incubating at room temperature for 15 min in stripping buffer (Pierce Biotechnology) and reprobed with another antibody.Kinase Assay—P38, JNK, and ERK kinase activity was determined using a p38 MAPK assay kit, a stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/JNK MAPK kit, and an ERK MAPK kit, respectively, from Cell Signaling Technologies as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, endogenous phospho-p38 was immunoprecipitated from 200 μg of cell lysates with immobilized anti-phospho-p38, without or with p38 inhibitor, and p38 kinase activity was measured using ATF-2 fusion protein as substrate. The reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP, and phosphorylation of ATF-2 was measured with phospho-ATF-2 antibody. Endogenous JNK/SAPK was pulled down by the c-Jun fusion protein beads in the absence or presence of JNK inhibitor, and the kinase reaction was carried out in the presence of cold ATP. c-Jun phosphorylation was measured using a phospho-c-Jun antibody. A monoclonal phospho-antibody to p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase was used to immunoprecipitate active ERK from lysates. The immunoprecipitate was then incubated with an Elk-1 fusion protein in the presence of cold ATP. Phosphorylation of Elk-1 was measured using a phospho-Elk-1 antibody.Assay for Apoptosis—To induce apoptosis, BM cells, following culturing for 48 h as indicated above, were seeded at 1.0 × 106 cells/30 mm and exposed to UVC (25 J/m2), after which cells were cultured for 24 h. Cells were then harvested and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2); apoptosis was measured by staining with Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan, Cell Quest software; BD Biosciences) as detailed previously (23Gupta M. Gupta S.K. Balliet A.G. Hollander M.C. Fornace A.J. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7170-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).RESULTSIncreased Sensitivity of Gadd45a-deficient BM Cells to UV-induced Apoptosis Is Associated with Failure to Activate the Stress Response p38 Kinase—We previously have shown that Gadd45a–/– and Gadd45b–/– BM cells are more sensitive to UV-induced apoptosis than WT cells (Ref. 23Gupta M. Gupta S.K. Balliet A.G. Hollander M.C. Fornace A.J. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7170-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar and Fig. 1A). Because GADD45 proteins have been implicated in activation of the stress response p38 kinase (24Bulavin D.V. Kovalsky O. Hollander M.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3859-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), 3D. Liebermann, unpublished observation. it was logical to determine the status of p38 activity following exposure of WT, Gadd45a-deficient, and Gadd45b-deficient BM cells to UV radiation.As shown in Fig. 1B, using an in vitro kinase assay with ATF-2 as substrate to measure p38 activity, in WT BM cells and Gadd45b–/– cells robust P38 activation was observed within 30 min and reached a maximum in 60 min. In contrast, in GADD45a–/– BM cells, p38 was not activated in response to UV radiation. These observations indicate that Gadd45a is essential for activation of p38.To confirm that the Gadd45a-mediated protection against UV radiation is via activation of p38, we tested the effect of the p38-specific inhibitor SB202190 on the WT and different mutant BM cells. As can be seen in Fig. 1B, SB202190 (20 um) completely inhibited UV-induced p38 activation in both WT and Gadd45b–/– BM cells. Under the same experimental conditions SB202190 significantly increased UV-induced apoptosis in WT BM cells. In contrast, SB202190 did not significantly increase apoptosis in either Gadd45a–/– or Gadd45b–/– BM cells (Fig. 1B). The results using Gadd45a–/– BM cells is expected, because p38 kinase activity is not induced in these cells. However, the lack of an increase in apoptosis for Gadd45b–/– cells despite the loss of p38 activation was not anticipated and is discussed below.To confirm the link between GADD45a, p38 kinase activation, and apoptosis, wild-type GADD45a was re-introduced into these Gadd45a-deficient BM cells using high efficiency retroviral transduction (supplemental Fig. S1). Re-expression of GADD45a was observed to restore wild-type phenotypes, including p38 activation and apoptosis.In conclusion, these observations demonstrate that Gadd45a is essential for activation of p38 MAPK, which plays a protective role in hematopoietic cells following UV treatment.Prolonged JNK Activation in Gadd45b-deficient BM cells Is Associated with Increased Sensitivity to UV-induced Apoptosis—Gadd45b–/– BM cells displayed increased sensitivity to UV radiation despite activation of p38 kinase. This observation suggested that the survival role of Gadd45b in response to UV radiation involves players other than p38. Because GADD45 proteins have been implicated also in modulation of the activity of the stress response Jun kinase (JNK), the status of JNK activity was determined following exposure of WT, Gadd45a–/–, and Gadd45b –/– BM cells to UV radiation.As shown in Fig. 2A, where JNK activity was measured using an in vitro kinase assay with c-Jun as the substrate, in WT BM cells JNK activity increased within 30 min following UV irradiation and was maintained up to 60 min, after which it declined to basal level by 2 h. Similar transient JNK activation was observed in Gadd45a–/– BM cells. In sharp contrast, in Gadd45b–/– BM cells JNK activity appeared significantly higher and prolonged, being sustained for up to at least 2 h following UV irradiation. These data are consistent with a role for GADD45b in curtailing JNK activity.FIGURE 2Prolonged JNK activation in Gadd45b–/– BM cells is associated with increased sensitivity to UV-induced apoptosis. BM cells from WT, Gadd45–/–, and Gadd45b–/– mice were exposed to UV radiation (25J/m2), without or with pretreatment with the JNK-specific inhibitor SP600215 (25 μm). A, following the indicated times protein extracts were analyzed for JNK activity by kinase assay with c-Jun as substrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Western blots were used to measure c-Jun phosphorylation with a phospho-c-Jun antibody and total JNK with JNK antibody. B, after 24 h in culture, cells were harvested, and apoptosis was measured by Annexin V staining followed by flow cytometry. Data represent the mean ± S.D. for three independent experiments. C, following 30 and 60 min in culture, protein extracts were analyzed for MKK4 and MKK7 phosphorylation using phospho-MKK4 and phospho-MKK7 antibody to probe Western blots. Total MKK4 and MKK7 levels were measured with antibody against MKK4 and MKK7, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It was next asked whether limiting JNK protects BM cells from UV irradiation, and conversely, whether prolonged JNK activity increases the sensitivity to UV-induced cell death. This was determined by assessing the effect of blocking JNK activation by the JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 in the various BM cells. BM cells from WT, Gadd45a–/–, and Gadd45b–/– mice were pretreated with SP600125 (25 μm) prior to UV irradiation. UV-induced activation of JNK was successfully inhibited without deleterious effects on survival of WT and Gadd45a–/– BM cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Most importantly, SP600215 significantly reduced the apoptotic response of the Gadd45b–/– cells to UV treatment, thereby demonstrating that prolonged JNK activity contributed to the enhanced cell death in UV-treated Gadd45b–/– BM cells.To confirm the link between GADD45b, JNK, and apoptosis, wild-type GADD45b was re-introduced into these Gadd45b-deficient BM cells using high efficiency retroviral transduction (supplemental Fig. S2). Re-expression of GADD45b was observed to restore wild-type phenotypes, including JNK activation and apoptosis.JNK kinases are activated via phosphorylation by the upstream MAPKK, including MKK4 and MKK7 (25Roux P.P. Blenis J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 320-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1889) Google Scholar, 26Zarubin T. Han J. Cell Res. 2005; 5: 11-18Crossref Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). To assess which of these upstream kinases is modulated by Gadd45b, the phosphorylation status of MKK4 and MKK7 was examined in WT, Gadd45a–/–, and Gadd45b–/–cells following UV treatment. Using anti-phospho-MKK4-specific and anti-phospho-MKK7-specific antibodies, it was seen that MKK4 activation was prolonged in Gadd45b–/– BM cells compared with WT and Gadd45a–/– cells following exposure to UV radiation (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that following UV irradiation of BM cells Gadd45b functions to curtail the activity of MKK4, which in turn results in blunting JNK activity. Taken together, these data argue that GADD45b-mediated suppression of the level and duration of JNK activity in BM cells exposed to UV radiation protects the cells from UV-induced cell death.Gadd45a–/– and Gadd45b–/– BM Cells Display Normal p42/p44 ERK Activation in Response to UV Radiation—Because stimulation of ERK p42/p44 MAPK is an important survival pathway (25Roux P.P. Blenis J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 320-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1889) Google Scholar, 26Zarubin T. Han J. Cell Res. 2005; 5: 11-18Crossref Scopus (1208) Google Scholar), we also investigated whether Gadd45a and/or Gadd45b survival functions involve activation of ERK. As shown in Fig. 3, using an in vitro kinase assay with Elk as substrate, exposure of wild-type BM cells to UV radiation resulted in ERK activation within 30 min. A similar degree of ERK activation was observed in Gadd45a–/– and Gadd45b–/– BM cells. These results show that UV-induced activation of ERK is not modulated by either Gadd45a or Gadd45b.FIGURE 3Both Gadd45a–/– and Gadd45b–/– BM cells display normal p42/p44 ERK activation in response to UV radiation. BM cells from WT, Gadd45a–/–, and Gadd45b–/– mice were treated with 25J/m2 UV radiation and following the indicated times cells were collected. Protein extracts were analyzed for ERK activity by kinase assay using Elk-1 as substrate, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Phosphorylation of Elk-1 was measured using a phospho-Elk-1 antibody, and total ERK was analyzed with ERK antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression Kinetics of GADD45a and GADD45b Proteins in Wild-type BM Cells Exposed to UV Radiation Are Consistent with These Proteins Playing a Role in the Regulation of p38 and JNK Activities—Activation of JNK and p38 was observed within 30–60 min following exposure of BM cells to UV radiation. Thus, it was important to establish that the expression kinetics of GADD45a and GADD45b proteins are consistent with these proteins playing a role in p38 and JNK MAPK activation. As shown in Fig. 4, maximal expression of GADD45a and GADD45b was observed within 20 min following exposure of the BM cells to UV radiation. These data are consistent with the suggested role for Gadd45a and Gadd45b as modulators of p38 and JNK MAPK activities, respectively.FIGURE 4Kinetics of GADD45 protein expression in wild-type BM cells following UV radiation. WT BM cell lysates used to measure p38, JNK, and ERK activities were examined at the indicated times for Gadd45a and Gadd45b protein expression by Western blot, probing with polyclonal antibodies against GADD45a and GADD45b.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Protective Role of Gadd45a-mediated Activation of p38 Involves Activation of NF-κB—NF-κB is a ubiquitous transcription factor with an established role in cell survival (27Karin M.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5197-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that Gadd45a-mediated activation of p38 plays a role in protection of BM cells against UV-induced apoptosis. Thus, we asked whether the protective role of Gadd45a-mediated activation of p38 involves activation of NF-κB.NF-κB is normally present in the cytoplasm in an inactive state and is bound to members of the IκB inhibitor protein family, chiefly IκBα (Refs. 29Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3274) Google Scholar and 30Baldwin A.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar and references therein). Phosphorylation-dependent degradation of IκB, which allows translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus and subsequent activation of NF-κB target genes, is indicative of NF-κB activation (29Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3274) Google Scholar, 30Baldwin A.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). Transient phosphorylation and degradation of IκB was observed in WT BM cells exposed to UV radiation; phosphorylation and degradation of IκB was evident within 20 min following UV irradiation, with the level of IκB increasing by 60 min (Fig. 5A). Similar kinetics were observed in Gadd45b–/– cells (data not shown). In contrast, in Gadd45a–/– BM cells exposed to UV radiation IκB was neither phosphorylated nor degraded (Fig. 5A). These data demonstrate that Gadd45a is required to activate NF-κB following UV irradiation.FIGURE 5GADD45a-mediated activation of p38 protection against UV radiation is via NF-κB. A, BM cells from WT and Gadd45a–/– mice were treated with 25J/m2 UV radiation, and at the indicated times cells were harvested and protein extracts were analyzed for phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, using phospho-IκBα and IκBα antibody, respectively, to probe a Western blot. B, BM cells from WT mice were treated with 25J/m2 UV radiation, with or without the IκB inhibitor IKK II (20 um Wedelolactone). At the indicated times cells were harvested and protein extracts were analyzed for IκBα by probing a Western blot with IκBα antibody. C, BM cells from WT and Gadd45a–/– littermates were exposed to UV radiation (25J/m2), with or without pretreatment with 20 μm IκB inhibitor.

The V617F activating point mutation in Jak2 has recently been associated with myeloproliferative disorders. Using various cell line models, mechanisms that contribute to Jak2V617-mediated signaling were investigated. Treatment of the Jak2V617F mutant-expressing erythroid leukemia cell line HEL with a small molecule Jak2 inhibitor was associated with a dose-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest. This inhibition correlated with decreased expression of cyclin D2 and increased expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip. Inhibition of Jak2V617F with a Jak2-targeted small interfering RNA approach resulted in a similar phenotype. Mechanisms leading to altered p27Kip and cyclin D2 likely involve inhibition of STAT5, a major target of Jak2 in hematopoietic cells, because a constitutively active form of STAT5 reduced p27Kip and increased cyclin D2 expression. Jak2V617F and constitutively active STAT5 also induced high levels of reactive oxygen species, which are sufficient to promote G1/S phase transition. In contrast, treatment of HEL cells with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine decreased cell growth or expression of cyclin D2 and increased expression of p27Kip. Similar results were obtained in BaF3 cells transfected with Jak2V617F, but these cells required coexpression of the erythropoietin receptor for optimal signaling. These results suggest that regulation of cyclin D2 and p27Kip in combination with redox-dependent processes promotes G1/S phase transition downstream of Jak2V617F/STAT5 and therefore hint at potential novel targets for drug development that may aid traditional therapy.

The family of non-receptor Janus tyrosine kinases (Jaks) is comprised of four members, including Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2 (see for review Ref. 1Yamaoka K. Saharinen P. Pesu M. Holt V.E. III Silvennoinen O'Shea O.J.J. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 253Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The Jaks contain seven regions with significant sequence homology between the kinases, termed Jak homology (JH) 2The abbreviations used are: JH, Jak homology; EpoR, erythropoietin receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; PDTC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; siRNA, small interfering RNA; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; ROS, reactive oxygen species; DCF-DA, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate; NAC, N-acetylcysteine. domains. The JH1 domain is located within the carboxyl terminus of the protein and contains the tyrosine kinase domain. The adjacent JH2 domain shows close homology to the JH1 domain. The JH2 domain lacks critical residues required for tyrosine kinase activity. This JH2 pseudokinase domain negatively regulates the kinase activity associated with the JH1 domain (2Saharinen P. Vihinen M. Silvennoinen O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 3Luo H. Rose P. Barber D. Hanratty W.P. Lee S. Roberts T.M. D'Andrea A.D. Dearolf C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1562-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Jaks are thought to primarily tyrosine phosphorylate and thus activate STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) transcription factors, although it seems clear that there are other activities. The Jak/STAT pathway has been implicated in a variety of solid tumors, as well as hematologic disorders. In particular, oncogenic fusion proteins of Jak2 with ETV6, PCM1, or BCR have been described in different leukemias and myeloproliferative disorders (4Peeters P. Raynaud S.D. Cools J. Wlodarska I.

It has been suggested that elevated Jak2 tyrosine kinase activity contributes to transformation, likely in part through the STAT5 transcription factor. Genetic modeling suggests that STAT5 genes support immature hematopoiesis, as mice with a targeted disruption of the STAT5A and STAT5B genes have reduced myeloid progenitor counts (8Teglund S.

Furthermore, STAT5 may also be required for normal fetal erythropoiesis (9Socolovsky M. Fallon A.E. Wang S. Brugnara C. Lodish H.F.

A close link of Jak2 kinase activity to STAT5 activation is also consistent with the fact that Jak2 knock-out mice have severely disrupted hematopoiesis that resembles the phenotype in mice with erythropoietin or erythropoietin receptor gene disruption (10Neubauer H.

The single point mutation leading to a V617F substitution in the JH2 domain of Jak2 has been associated with the proliferative phenotype, likely by leading to deregulated kinase activity. The detailed molecular requirements for Jak2 activation are still being worked out and may require the autophosphorylation on multiple sites. We sought to further define signaling mechanisms activated by Jak2V617F and identify targets that would aid in the development and implementation of targeted therapies for the treatment of Jak2V617F-related disorders. Cells—The human CML cell line K562 and the human erythroleukemia cell line HEL were grown in RPMI 1640 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Tissue Culture Biologicals, Tulare, CA); HEL cells were supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). The murine BaF3 pre-B cell line with doxycycline-inducible constitutive active STAT5 was maintained as described before (22Gesbert F. Griffin J.D. Blood. 2000; 96: 2269-2276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). STAT5 expression was induced by treatment with 1 μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma) in the absence of murine interleukin-3. BaF3.EpoR cells (expressing the erythropoietin receptor, EpoR) and BaF3.EpoR cells expressing Jak2V617F without enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) were kindly provided by Dr. A. D'Andrea (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) and Dr. G. Gilliland, respectively (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA). BaF3 and BaF3.EpoR cell lines were kept in interleukin-3-containing medium unless otherwise indicated. Additional BaF3 cell lines were generated by infection with pMSCVJak2.IRES.EGFP or pMSCVJak2V617F.IRES.EGFP containing viruses, kindly provided by Dr. G. Gilliland. In some experiments cells were treated with Jak inhibitor 1 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), N-acetylcysteine (Sigma), 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzenedisulfonic acid (Tiron; Sigma), pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC; Sigma) or transfected with specific human Jak2 siRNA (siGenome™, Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). Cell growth and viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion or by a colorimetric method (CellTiter 96® AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega, Madison, WI). In some experiments, comparisons between test and control samples were evaluated using Student's t test. Electroporation of siRNA—Human Jak2-specific and control siRNA were used to transfect HEL cells in 100 μl of Nucleofector solution R (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's directions using the Nucleofector device (Amaxa). In some experiments, the pmaxGFP vector (Amaxa) was transfected to survey transfection efficiency. Cells were transferred to culture medium after electroporation and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Comparisons among siRNA-transfected samples were done by an analysis of variance, followed by the Dunnett's t test for post-hoc analysis. Immunoblotting—Proteins were extracted from whole cells in buffer containing Tris (50 mm, pH 8.0) (Invitrogen), NaCl (150 mm) (Fisher Scientific), Nonidet P-40 (1% v/v) (Calbiochem), deoxycholic acid (0.5% w/v) (Fisher Scientific), sodium dodecyl sulfate (0.1% w/v) (Bio-Rad), NaF (1 mm) (Sigma), Na3VO4 (1 mm) (Sigma), and glycerol (10% v/v) (Invitrogen) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Complete, Roche Diagnostics). Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against STAT5 (C-17), cyclin D2 (M-20), p27Kip (C-19), Jak2 (C-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), Jak2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) or phosphorylated STAT5 (Tyr-694) (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), and mouse monoclonal antibodies against phosphotyrosine (kindly provided by Dr. T. Roberts, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute) or β-actin (Sigma) were used for immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation. Apoptosis Assays—Annexin V-positive staining was determined by FACS analysis (Annexin-V-Fluor Staining Kit, Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's directions in cells that were treated with Jak inhibitor I, cells transfected with siRNA, or left untreated. Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were fixed with 70% (v/v) ethanol in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated on ice for 30 min. RNase-treated samples (10 μg of RNase/ml for 20 min at 37 °C) were stained with propidium iodide (5 μg/ml) (Sigma) at 4 °C for at least 10 min. Cell cycle parameters were determined by FACS analysis using a Beckman-Coulter Cytomics FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter Corp., Miami, FL). The DNA analysis program MultiCycle for Windows (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA) was used to determine cell cycle distribution. Measurement of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)—Fluorescence image analysis was used to determine the relative levels of ROS in response to various stimuli. Cells were treated before FACS analysis, and the relative levels of intracellular ROS were analyzed using the cell-permeable redox-sensitive fluorochrome DCF-DA (2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate) (Fisher Scientific/Acros Organics). Cells were incubated with DCF-DA (5 μm) for 5 min at 37 °C and subsequently washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline before analysis using a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter Corp.). A Pyridone-containing Tetracycle Jak Kinase Inhibitor Induces G1 Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis in HEL Cells—The V617F activating point mutation of the Jak2 tyrosine kinase has been shown to be sufficient for the induction of a myeloproliferative disorder-like phenotype using murine bone marrow cells in vivo (16James C. Ugo V. Le Couedic J.P. Staerk J. Delhommeau F. Lacout C. Garcon L. Raslova H. Berger R. Bennaceur-Griscelli A. Villeval J.L. Constantinescu S.N. Casadevall N. Vainchenker W.

In the search for an appropriate cell line model, we confirmed the presence of the Jak2V617F mutation in the erythroid leukemia cell line HEL, but not in the erythroid Ph+ cell line K562 (not shown and Ref. 15Levine R.L.

Also, a specific pyridone-containing tetracycle compound that has previously been shown to be a specific Jak kinase inhibitor (23Thompson J.E. Cubbon R.M. Cummings R.T. Wicker L.S. Frankshun R.

Treatment of HEL cells with this Jak inhibitor I led to a dose-dependent reduction of cell growth in a three-day culture, with an IC50 of ∼300 nm (Fig. 1A). At a concentration of 1 μm, there was more than 90% inhibition of cell growth in HEL cells as compared with untreated cells, which is consistent with recently published data (15Levine R.L. Wadleigh M. Cools J. Ebert B.L. Wernig G. Huntly B.J. Boggon T.J. Wlodarska I. Clark J.J. Moore S. Adelsperger J. Koo S. Lee J.C. Gabriel S. Mercher T. D'Andrea A. Frohling S. Dohner K. Marynen P.

Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2484) Google Scholar). There was no inhibition of cell growth in the BCR-ABL-transformed K562 cells at 1 μm Jak inhibitor I, and the IC50 was not reached under these conditions. Interestingly, we found that even though Jak inhibitor I reduces growth of HEL cells, it did not have an impact on overall cellular tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). To determine the mechanism of reduced cell growth induced by the Jak kinase inhibitor, we looked at cellular targets known to be involved in cell growth. In control experiments, the Jak inhibitor I was found to reduce tyrosine phosphorylation of the Jak2 substrate STAT5 on its activation site Tyr-694 at concentrations greater than 300 nm (Fig. 2A, top panels), and tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 was reduced at comparable concentrations (not shown). Further experiments showed that Jak kinase inhibitor I also reduced cyclin D2 expression and increased p27Kip expression (Fig. 2A, bottom panels), suggesting a role for Jak2 in regulating G1 phase to S phase transition. Next, cell cycle distribution in response to the inhibitor by propidium iodide staining was determined. Cells were left untreated or treated with Jak inhibitor I, and the different phases of cell cycle distribution were determined (Fig. 2B). The percentage of cells in G1 phase increased from 18 to 52% in cells that were treated for 48 h with Jak inhibitor I (up to 1 μm)in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the percentage of cells in S phase decreased from 62 to 37%, and those in G2/M phase decreased from 20 to 11%. On average, we observed a 28 ± 3.2% increase in G1 phase, a 21 ± 2.1% decrease in S phase, and a 7 ± 1.2% decrease in G2/M phase (means ± S.E., n = 3) upon 1 μm Jak inhibitor I treatment. This suggests that Jak inhibitor I leads to a significant G1 cell cycle arrest in the transformed cells, which is consistent with our findings of cyclin D2 and p27Kip regulation by this drug. However, there was no significant increase of cells in sub-G1 phase. We also looked at the change in Annexin V-positive staining of cells, an indication for increased exposure of phosphatidylserine to the outer cell membrane during apoptosis. Using HEL cells, we found that treatment with Jak inhibitor I (24 h, 1 μm) led to a marginal increase in Annexin V-positive cells compared with untreated cells (not shown). However, prolonged exposure of HEL cells to the drug (48 h, 1 μm) led to a small increase of 6.1 ± 3.6% (n = 3) in Annexin V-positive staining (Fig. 2C). In the control cells less than 10% of the total population showed signs of apoptosis. These data demonstrate that Jak inhibitor I-induced G1 cell cycle arrest primarily contributes to the reduced cell growth of treated HEL cells, in combination with a weak proapoptotic signal.FIGURE 2Jak kinase inhibitor I induces G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HEL cells. A, HEL cells were left either untreated or treated for 18 h with the indicated amount of Jak inhibitor I. The changes in STAT5 phosphorylation as well as expression of STAT5, cyclin D2, or p27Kip in whole cell lysates were detected as indicated. B, cell cycle distribution was determined in HEL cells treated for 24 h with the indicated amount of Jak inhibitor I (n = 3, typical experiment shown). C, HEL cells were treated with Jak inhibitor I (1000 nm) or left untreated (Control) as indicated and Annexin V/propidium iodide-positive cell staining determined in a 48-h culture (n = 3, typical experiment shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Expression of Jak2V617F Is Required for Transformation of HEL Cells—Lessons learned from tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib mesylate indicate that efficacy does not always correlate with the specificity of the drug. The previous experiments demonstrate that Jak inhibitor I efficiently suppresses cell growth of HEL cells at concentrations where K562 cell growth is not affected. The efficacy of the Jak inhibitor also strongly correlates with a reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of the Jak2 substrate STAT5. Because it is possible that this small molecule drug also inhibits other kinases at these concentrations, we used a human Jak2-targeted siRNA approach. HEL cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting four different regions in Jak2 or with control siRNA. Three siRNAs (defined as 6, 7, and 10) were found to efficiently reduce Jak2 expression, whereas one siRNA (defined as 9) only slightly reduced Jak2 compared with control siRNA transfected cells (Fig. 3A). We next asked whether reduction in Jak2 expression would also regulate phosphorylation of STAT5. Consistent with the previous data, only siRNA6, siRNA7, and to a somewhat lesser extent siRNA10 significantly reduced STAT5 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Again, siRNA9 had little effect on STAT5 phosphorylation compared with control transfected cells. These data suggest that Jak2V617F expression is required for optimal phosphorylation of STAT5 at its activation site. The inhibitor studies suggested that Jak activation regulates cell cycle progression and that inhibition of Jak2 induces G1 cell cycle arrest. Consistent with this assumption, reduced cyclin D2 and increased p27Kip expression was found to correlate with reduced Jak2 expression and thus reduced phosphorylation of STAT5 (Fig. 3B, bottom panels). Finally, the effect of Jak2 RNA interference on cell growth of HEL cells was determined. The transfection of siRNA6, siRNA7, and siRNA10 consistently led to a reduction in cell growth compared with control transfected cells (Fig. 4A). An analysis of variance indicated that there were differences between the siRNAs (p < 0.0001). Using simultaneous 99.5% confidence limits for these differences, we found in the post-hoc analysis that siRNA6, siRNA7, and siRNA10 are all statistically significantly different from the control siRNA at the 0.005 level; only siRNA9 failed to differ from the control at any reasonable level of significance for this experiment, including 0.05. Even after a 72-h period, we only measured a small increase in Annexin V-positive staining of less than 4.5% of the total population compared with control transfected cells (not shown). This suggests that apoptosis was not the main underlying reason for reduced cell growth by Jak2 siRNA. In contrast, there was an increase in G1 cell cycle distribution of between 9 and 24% within 48 h after transfection with siRNA6, siRNA7, and siRNA10 (Fig. 4B). Similar to the previous experiments, siRNA9 had no effect on cell cycle distribution compared with control transfected cells. Our results demonstrate that Jak2V617F is required for cell growth of HEL cells and implicate activated Jak2 as a main regulator of cell cycle progression. Redox-dependent Regulation of p27Kip through the Jak2/STAT5 Pathway—ROS have been suggested by us and others (24Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

We have previously shown that the ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) leads to inhibition of ROS in BCR-ABL-expressing hematopoietic cells (27Sattler M. Verma S. Shrikhande G.

We therefore also sought to determine whether Jak inhibitor I could reduce ROS in the Jak2V617F-transformed HEL cells. Jak inhibitor I treatment (1 μm) was found to have only a small effect on intracellular ROS levels after a 1-day treatment but reduced ROS by ∼50% after a 2-day treatment compared with untreated cells (Fig. 5A, top panels). We next looked at the direct effects of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on the expression of p27Kip and cyclin D2 in HEL cells. Both NAC (20 mm) and Jak inhibitor I were found to induce p27Kip expression as well as reduce cyclin D2 levels (Fig. 5A, bottom left panel), consistent with an important role for redox-sensitive pathways in the regulation of G1 phase to S phase transition. Interestingly, NAC was also found to strongly inhibit activation of STAT5 using a phosphospecific antibody against its activation site (Fig. 5A, bottom right panel). These results demonstrate that activation of the Jak2 pathway is required for optimal induction of ROS in HEL cells and regulation of p27Kip levels. To further determine whether activation of the Jak2 substrate STAT5 is sufficient to increase cellular levels of ROS, we used a BaF3 cell line with doxycycline-inducible constitutively active STAT5 (22Gesbert F. Griffin J.D. Blood. 2000; 96: 2269-2276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells maintained in the absence of growth factor were compared with doxycycline-treated cells or cells stimulated with interleukin-3-containing medium as a positive control for increased ROS (26Sattler M. Winkler T. Verma S. Byrne C.H. Shrikhande G. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 2928-2935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Doxycycline treatment by itself does not alter intracellular ROS levels (not shown). Induction of active STAT5 expression led to a significant increase in ROS, which was comparable to the increase observed after interleukin-3 treatment (Fig. 5B, top panel). In control experiments the induction of STAT5 in these cell lines was determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 5B, first bottom panel). Surprisingly, active STAT5 also led to a significant reduction in p27Kip levels compared with growth factor-deprived cells in the absence of doxycycline. We also observed an increase in cyclin D2 levels in the presence of activated STAT5 through doxycycline induction (Fig. 5B, bottom panels). Overall, these results demonstrate that activation of the Jak2/STAT5 pathway is sufficient for the induction of elevated levels of ROS and cyclin D2 and the suppression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip. We also looked at the effect of the antioxidants NAC, Tiron, and PDTC on cell growth in HEL cells (Fig. 5C). HEL cells were treated with 0-30 mm NAC, 0-10 μm Tiron, or 0-3 μm PDTC, and relative cell growth was measured in a 3-day culture. All three drugs led to a dose-dependent reduction in cell growth and reduced the cell number by more than 90% at concentrations of 30 mm NAC, 3 μm Tiron, or 3 μm PDTC. Overall these results suggest that a high oxidative state is important to maintain cell growth in HEL cells. Also, the Jak2/STAT5 pathway is likely to significantly contribute to elevated ROS levels and the reduction in p27Kip levels. Jak2V617F Regulates p27Kip, Cyclin D2, and ROS in Erythropoietin Receptor-expressing BaF3 Cells—In addition to the Jak2V617F-expressing HEL cells, we generated Jak2V617F- or wild-type Jak2-expressing BaF3 cells. BaF3 cells are interleukin-3-dependent and can be transformed to growth factor independence by a variety of activated tyrosine kinases, such as BCR-ABL (28Sattler M. Salgia R. Okuda K. Uemura N.

In plants, the two-domain protein Cnx1 catalyzes the insertion of molybdenum into molybdopterin (MPT), a metal-free phosphorylated pyranopterin carrying an ene-dithiolate. Recently, we identified a novel biosynthetic intermediate, adenylated molybdopterin (MPT-AMP), which is synthesized by the C-terminal G domain of Cnx1. Here, we show that MPT-AMP and molybdate bind in an equimolar and cooperative way to the other N-terminal E domain (Cnx1E).

Cnx1E catalyzes the Zn2+-/Mg2+-dependent hydrolysis of MPT-AMP but only when molybdate is bound as co-substrate. MPT-AMP hydrolysis resulted in stoichiometric release of Moco that was quantitatively incorporated into plant apo-sulfite oxidase. Upon Moco formation AMP is release as second product of the reaction. When comparing MPT-AMP hydrolysis with the formation of Moco and AMP a 1.5-fold difference in reaction rates were observed.

Biophys. 2003; 411: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Structures with bound MPT and adenlyated MPT (MPT-AMP), a recently identified intermediate of Moco biosynthesis, have uncovered the function of Cnx1G (22Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Cnx1G catalyzes the adenylation of MPT in a Mg2+- and ATP-dependent manner (23Llamas A. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55241-55246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). ATP hydrolysis and pyrophosphate release were dependent on bound MPT. Catalytically inactive Cnx1G variants were found to be defective in MPT adenylation and therefore we named Cnx1G as MPT adenylyl transferase (23Llamas A. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55241-55246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). An unexpected observation in the MPT-bound Cnx1G structures was the identification of copper bound to the MPT dithiolate sulfurs. Copper might play a role in sulfur transfer to cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate, in protecting the MPT dithiolate from oxidation and/or presenting a suitable leaving group for molybdenum insertion (22Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). As we found a Mg2+ and Cnx1E dependence of in vitro Moco synthesis, a function of Cnx1E in MPT-AMP hydrolysis and molybdenum insertion has been proposed (22Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Here, we show that MPT-AMP is hydrolyzed by Cnx1E. Both, molybdate and MPT-AMP bind in a cooperative manner to Cnx1E. Molybdate is essential for the Zn2+/Mg2+-dependent MPT-AMP hydrolysis, which is competitively inhibited by tungstate and sulfate. Upon MPT-AMP hydrolysis Moco is formed and quantitatively transferred to apo-plant sulfite oxidase (apo-PSO). AMP and copper are released as additional products of the Cnx1E reaction. Our data demonstrated a nucleotide-dependent molybdenum insertion reaction using equimolar amounts of substrates. The formation of adenylated molybdate as reaction intermediate is proposed. Expression and Purification of Cnx1G, Cnx1E, and Apo-SO—Cnx1G and variants D515H and S583A were expressed from pQE60Cnx1g628 in strain SE1581 (moeA–) for 36 h at 22 °C in LB medium containing 10 μm isopropyl β-thiogalactoside. Cnx1G-MPT-AMP complex and C-terminally His-tagged Cnx1E were purified as described (18Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Apo-PSO was expressed in BL21 using plasmid pQE80At-sox (24Eilers T. Schwarz G. Brinkmann H. Witt C. Richter T. Nieder J. Koch B. Hille R. Hansch R. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46989-46994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-thiogalactoside at A600 of 0.5 and continued for 18 h at 25 °C. Harvested cells were extracted and purified using 5 ml nickel nitrilotriacetic acid superflow matrix per 1-liter culture under denaturating conditions as recommended (Qiagen). After washing, column-bound apo-PSO was refolded by a stepwise gradient against refolding buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0) and subsequently eluted with refolding buffer containing 500 mm imidazol, pH 8.0. Eluted pure protein was desalted against PSO buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0), concentrated to 2 mg/ml, and frozen in 25-μl aliquots in liquid nitrogen. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Size exclusion chromatography was performed using a HR10/30 Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris/HCl, 250 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. Proteins (15–30 μm) were loaded in a total volume of 500 μl and separated with 0.2 ml/min flow rate. Fractions of 500 μl were collected, pooled, concentrated, and MPT as well as MPT-AMP content was determined by HPLC FormA or FormA-AMP analysis, respectively. MPT-AMP Hydrolysis—Cleavage of MPT-AMP by Cnx1E was performed aerobically in two different ways, either in a mixture of Cnx1G-bound MPT-AMP and Cnx1E or with purified Cnx1E-MPT-AMP complex. In the first case 20 μm Cnx1G-bound MPT-AMP, 10 μm Cnx1E, and if indicated 20 μm sodium molybdate were incubated in a final volume of 200 μl of 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2 with 1 mm MgCl2. At different times aliquots of 20 μl were taken and MPT-AMP as well as MPT contents were determined by HPLC FormA-AMP or FormA analysis, respectively. In the other case, purified Cnx1E-MPT-AMP complex was prepared by transferring MPT-AMP from Cnx1G to Cnx1E. In 500 μl total volume 30 μm Cnx1G-bound MPT-AMP, 15 μm Cnx1E, and 30 μm sodium molybdate were co-incubated in 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH7.2 for 1 h at room temperature under anaerobic conditions before purification by size exclusion chromatography as described above. MPT-AMP hydrolysis was performed in 20 μl total volume containing 10 μm Cnx1E-MPT-AMP complex (200 pmol of MPT-AMP). The reaction was started by adding the indicated divalent cations and either stopped by the addition of 390 μl 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, and 50 μl of 1% I2, 2% KI, 1 m HCl, or 1 mm EDTA. Determination of MPT and AMP-MPT—MPT was detected by HPLC FormA analysis as described (18Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To separate MPT and MPT-AMP oxidation was performed for 2 h at room temperature. By this procedure MPT-AMP was converted into FormA-AMP that was separated from FormA by anion exchange chromatography and subsequently treated with pyrophosphatase and alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) thus yielding FormA dephospho, which was quantified as described (18Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Molybdate Binding Assay—Quantitative molybdate binding to Cnx1E was performed in a final volume of 200 μl of 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, containing 12 μm sodium molybdate. Protein-bound and unbound molybdate was separated using NICK desalting columns (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2. Molybdate was determined in the salt fraction (1 ml) by a modified colorimetric method (25Cardenas J. Mortenson L.E. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 60: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated with 100 μl of concentrated sulfuric acid for 10 min before adding the toluene 3,4-dithiolate reagent (Sigma) (25Cardenas J. Mortenson L.E. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 60: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The formed non-soluble dithiolate complex was separated by centrifugation for 10 min at 15,000 × g, and the resulting green pellet was re-suspended in 200 μl of isoamyl acetate. The amount of molybdate was determined spectrophotmetrically according to a standard curve by the absorption difference between 550 and 680 nm wavelength. Inductively Plasma-coupled Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS)—For analysis of metal concentrations, samples were prepared by HNO3 closed-vessel microwave digestion and diluted in water to a final concentration of 6.5% HNO3 for analysis by ICP-MS. ICP-MS was performed by using a HP4500 Series 300 ShieldTorch system instrument (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany) in peak-hopping mode with spacing at 0.05 atomic mass unit, three points/peak, three scans/replicate, two replicate/sample, and an integration time of 500 ms per point as described (26Simons A. Ruppert T. Schmidt C. Schlicksupp A. Pipkorn R. Reed J. Masters C.L. White A.R. Cappai R. Beyreuther K. Bayer T.A. Multhaup G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9310-9320Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The rate of plasma flow was 15.8 liter/min with an auxiliary flow of 1.0 liter/min and a blend gas flow rate of 0.1 liter/min. The RF power was 1.21 killowatts. The sample was introduced by using a cross-flow nebulizer at a flow rate of 1.02 liter/min. The apparatus was calibrated by using a 6.5% HNO3 solution containing copper and molybdenum at 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 parts per billion with Rh-103 as internal standard for all isotopes of copper and molybdenum. Apo-PSO Recontistution Assay—Transfer of Moco from Cnx1E to apo-PSO was performed in 75 μl reaction volume containing up to 0–20 μm Cnx1E-MPT-AMP complex, 10 μm apo-SO, and either 500 μm ZnCl2 or 100 μm MgCl2 and incubated the indicated time. After reconstitution 75 μl of PSO buffer containing 100 μm ferricyanide was added. The assay was started with 150 μl of PSO buffer containing 25 μm sulfite, and PSO activity was determined by monitoring the reduction of ferricyanide at 420 nm using a 96-well plate reader (Versa Max, Molecular Devices). For each reaction a control without sulfite was performed and resulting rates were subtracted from the sulfite-dependent activity. 1 unit of PSO activity corresponds to a change in A420 of 1 milliabsorbance unit/min. AMP Determination—AMP was detected by an HPLC-based method (27Schwenn J.D. Jender H.G. J. Chromatogr. 1980; 138: 285-290Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. AMP-containing samples were loaded onto a C18 reversed phased column (Hypersil ODS, 5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm, Techlab) equilibrated in 6 mm tetrabutyamoniumhydroxide (Fluka), 10% methanol at 1 ml/min flow rate. After injection, AMP was eluted with a 13-ml gradient of methanol between 35 and 85% and detected at A260. To monitor the release of AMP upon MPT-AMP hydrolysis 10 μm Cnx1E-MPT-AMP complex (200 μl volume) was incubated for different times, stopped by the addition of 1 mm EDTA, and injected onto the HPLC. Isolation of MPT-AMP by Purifying the Cnx1G-Product Complex—To obtain sufficient amounts of MPT-AMP for subsequent mechanistic studies we performed MPT-AMP co-purifications with different Cnx1G variants. We expressed and purified wild-type Cnx1G domain as well as S583A and D515H variants under conditions of MPT-AMP accumulation (22Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Upon expression in the E. coli moeA mutant SE1581 (28Hasona A. Ray R.M. Shanmugam K.T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1466-1472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) preferentially MPT-AMP was co-purified with all three variants (Fig. 1) demonstrating a metabolic block in further processing of MPT-AMP in the moeA mutant (Fig. 1A), which is not seen in mogA mutants (22Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Previously we have also shown that D515H is unable to synthesize MPT-AMP (22Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 23Llamas A. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55241-55246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore one can conclude that co-purified MPT-AMP was synthesized by the Cnx1G-homologous E. coli MogA protein (Fig. 1A). The product-substrate ratio (MPT-AMP:MPT) was best in the S583A variant (50% MPT-AMP saturation as determined by FormA analysis) due to its high MPT adenylation rate (23Llamas A. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55241-55246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore we used S583A for subsequent biochemical studies and named it Cnx1G-bound MPT-AMP. Cnx1G concentrations were adjusted to 50% MPT-AMP saturation. Hydrolysis of MPT-AMP by Cnx1E—Cnx1E is important for Mg2+-dependent in vitro Moco synthesis (22Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the ability of purified Cnx1E to hydrolyze Cnx1G-bound MPT-AMP (Fig. 2A). In the presence of 1 mm MgCl2 a time-dependent cleavage of MPT-AMP (detected as FormA-AMP) was observed (Fig. 2B). Simultaneously, the appearance of non-adenylated pterin (detected as FormA-dephospho) was found (Fig. 2C). If not stated otherwise, we will use the term MPT for non-adenylated pterin throughout the manuscript. Interestingly, the increase in MPT was only linear up to 100-min reaction time; longer incubation resulted in a progressive decrease. A 6-fold increase in reaction rate was observed when only 20 μm molybdate (2-fold molar excess) was added (Fig. 2B), and MPT-AMP hydrolysis was completed after 90-min reaction time. As MPT formation also reached a maximum at 90 min (Fig. 2C), the strong decay observed with longer reaction times suggests a degradation of the non-andenylated pterin product generated in this reaction. These findings show that Cnx1E cleaves MPT-AMP in a Mg2+-dependent and molybdate-enhanced manner for which Cnx1E has to bind either to MPT-AMP-loaded Cnx1G or MPT-AMP has to be transferred from Cnx1G to Cnx1E. MPT-AMP and Molybdate Binding to Cnx1E—We have co-incubated equimolar amounts of MPT-AMP-loaded Cnx1G with Cnx1E (7.5 nmol each) in the presence or absence of 15 nmol molybdate and separated the reaction mixture by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 3, A and B). In the absence of molybdate both proteins eluted at the same volume (data not shown) as the individually loaded proteins (Fig. 3A). MPT-AMP was only detected in Cnx1G-containing fractions (Fig. 3C). In the presence of molybdate no change in the elution profile of Cnx1E and Cnx1G was observed (Fig. 3B), but MPT-AMP was shifted into the Cnx1E-containing fraction (Fig. 3D, 6.1 nmol) resulting in about 80% MPT-AMP-saturated Cnx1E. These data demonstrate that Cnx1E is able to bind MPT-AMP with high affinity but only in the presence of molybdate. Furthermore, no physical interaction between both proteins could be detected. Molybdate-dependent MPT-AMP binding to Cnx1E indicated that also molybdate binds to the protein. Therefore, molybdate binding was measured by incubating Cnx1E with 2-fold molar excess of molybdate (12 μm), desalting, and determining unbound molybdate in the salt fraction using a colorimetric molybdenum assay (25Cardenas J. Mortenson L.E. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 60: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A and B). Low concentrations of molybdate were used in order to measure accurate changes in the remaining unbound substrate as the determination of protein-bound molybdate was hampered by protein precipitations (data not shown). In the absence of MPT-AMP no molybdate binding was observed to Cnx1E (Fig. 4B). When adding 6 μm MPT-AMP to 6 μm Cnx1E, a time-dependent binding of molybdate reaching saturation at 6 μm was observed (Fig. 4A) indicating equimolar binding. Next we have titrated either MPT-AMP or Cnx1E against constant amounts of Cnx1E or MPT-AMP (loaded to Cnx1G), respectively (Fig. 4B). In both cases molybdate binding reached saturation at 6 μm according to the respective concentration of the constantly kept MPT-AMP or Cnx1E, respectively. Therefore we conclude that MPT-AMP and molybdate bind cooperatively in an equimolar manner to Cnx1E. As quantitative binding was observed upon gel filtration the affinity for both substrate can be considered in the submicromolar range. The cooperative binding of MPT-AMP and molybdate to Cnx1E raised the question how molybdenum is attached to the Cnx1E-MPT-AMP complex. Due to our previous finding that Cnx1G-bound MPT and MPT-AMP contain an ene-dithiolate-coordinated copper atom (22Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), we examined the molybdenum and copper content of Cnx1G- and Cnx1E-MPT-AMP complexes by ICP-MS (Fig. 4C). First, we confirmed the previously found binding of copper to MPT-AMP (22Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) by detecting 200 pmol of copper on 1 nmol of Cnx1G. The submolar stoichiometry of copper to MPT-AMP (500 pmol) might indicate a dissociation of copper during purification from Cnx1G-MPT-AMP complex (Fig. 4C). Molybdenum was undetectable on Cnx1G or Cnx1E. After transfer of MPT-AMP (500 pmol) from Cnx1G to Cnx1E in the presence of 1 nmol of molybdate an equimolar transfer of molybdenum to the protein fraction was observed (Fig. 4C, “p”). Remaining unbound molybdate was regained in the salt fraction (Fig. 4C, “s”). Most importantly, the MPT-AMP-coordinated copper remained in the protein-bound fraction demonstrating that molybdenum has not replaced the copper upon binding to Cnx1E. Also Cnx1E-MPT-AMP complex purified by gel filtration showed almost similar ratios between molybdenum, copper, and MPT-AMP (Fig. 4C, “g”). The slight decrease in copper content also points again to a loss of copper by dissociation. Tungsten and Sulfate Compete for the Molybdate-binding Site on Cnx1E—After showing that molybdate binds to Cnx1E we wanted to know if other anions might compete for the molybdate-binding site on Cnx1E. Tungstate and sulfate are known competitors of molybdate in molybdate-binding proteins (29Pau R.N. Lawson D.M. Met. Ions Biol. Syst. 2002; 39: 31-74PubMed Google Scholar). Molybdate binding experiments were performed as described above and increasing amounts (0–100 mm) of tungstate and sulfate (Fig. 4D) were added. Already 20-fold excess of tungstate (250 μm) showed detectable competition for the molybdate-binding site and reached a maximum at 5 mm, which is consistent with the known antagonistic effect between tungstate and molybdate (29Pau R.N. Lawson D.M. Met. Ions Biol. Syst. 2002; 39: 31-74PubMed Google Scholar). Also sulfate showed inhibition of molybdate binding but to a much lower extent. Next we wanted to know if both anions could also promote MPT-AMP binding to Cnx1E. Therefore, Cnx1E was co-incubated with a 2-fold excess of MPT-AMP (Cnx1G-bound, compare Fig. 3) in the presence or absence of molybdate (20 μm), tungstate (5 mm), or sulfate (100 mm). Cnx1E and Cnx1G were separated by size exclusion chromatography and MPT-AMP as well as MPT contents were determined (Fig. 4E). In the presence of any of the three anions a nearly complete transfer of MPT-AMP was observed indicating a cooperative binding of MPT-AMP to Cnx1E in the presence of tetrahedral anions. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that molybdate binds to a distinct anion-binding site in Cnx1E. Metal- and Anion-specific MPT-AMP Hydrolysis by Cnx1E—After quantitative transfer of MPT-AMP and molybdate to Cnx1E we performed MPT-AMP hydrolysis experiments with different divalent cations (1 mm each) to determine the appropriate co-substrate (Fig. 5A). The data show that not only Mg2+ but also Ni2+ and Mn2+ are able to promote MPT-AMP hydrolysis. However the most efficient cation was Zn2+, which is known to act as a cofactor in similar reactions catalyzed by pyrophosphatases (30Zyryanov A.B. Shestakov A.S. Lahti R. Baykov A.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 901-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the fact that not only molybdate but also other anions are able to bind cooperatively to Cnx1E we investigated MPT-AMP hydrolysis as a function of different anions bound to the proposed molybdate-binding site in Cnx1E. This experiment clearly shows that only molybdate-loaded Cnx1E is able to hydrolyze MPT-AMP, while tungstate and sulfate show no activity under the experimental conditions used (Fig. 5B). With much longer incubation times (1–2 h) low hydrolysis rates were observed (data not shown) according to the molybdate-independent cleavage shown in Fig. 2. These data unequivocally demonstrate that Cnx1E-catalyzed MPT-AMP hydrolysis is strictly dependent on bound molybdate. Reaction Rates of MPT-AMP Hydrolysis—We also determined the catalytic parameters of MPT-AMP hydrolysis (Fig. 5, C–E). As only one molecule per Cnx1E reaction could be cleaved the experimental set up resembled a “pre-steady-state”-type of kinetic analysis. MPT-AMP hydrolysis rates with Zn2+ (Fig. 5C) were much higher than with Mg2+ (Fig. 5D) as shown in the double-reciprocal plot (Fig. 5E) with a kcat for Zn2+ of 2.5 s–1, whereas the Mg2+-dependent reaction rate was 10 times lower (kcat = 0.25 s–1). The Km for both metals was in the same range (133–255 μm, Fig. 5F). It is important to note that the formation of non-adenylated pterin was significantely slower than the simultaneous hydrolysis of MPT-AMP (data not shown). In Vitro Synthesis of Mature Moco by Cnx1E—We have shown that Cnx1E binds molybdate and hydrolyzes bound MPT-AMP thus yielding non-adenylated pterin. Now we want to demonstrate that during molybdate-dependent MPT-AMP hydrolysis molybdenum is transferred to the MPT ene-dithiolate and mature Moco is released. So far there is no direct measure for Moco, and it is commonly established that free Moco is rapidly degraded (31Wahl R.C. Hageman R.V. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 230: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which fits well to our previous observation (Fig. 2C). To prove Moco formation we used the simplest molybdenum enzyme, PSO, in its apo-state. Large amounts of Moco-free PSO were obtained by purification under denaturating conditions and subsequent on-column refolding (see “Experimental Procedures”). Apo-PSO was incubated with increasing amounts of Cnx1E-MPT-AMP complex in the presence of 500 μm Zn2+, which resul"

We report here the isolation and characterization of mammalian orthologs of SAD-1, named SAD-A and SAD-B, which are specifically expressed in the brain. SAD-B is associated with synaptic vesicles and, like the active zone proteins CAST and Bassoon, is tightly associated with the presynaptic cytomatrix in nerve terminals. A short conserved region (SCR) in the COOH-terminus is required for the synaptic localization of SAD-B. Overexpression of SAD-B in cultured rat hippocampal neurons significantly increases the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic current but not its amplitude. Introduction of SCR into presynaptic superior cervical ganglion neurons in culture significantly inhibits evoked synaptic transmission. Moreover, SCR decreases the size of the readily releasable pool measured by applying hypertonic sucrose. Furthermore, SAD-B phosphorylates the active zone protein RIM1 but not Munc13-1. These results suggest that mammalian SAD kinase presynaptically regulates neurotransmitter release. A serine/threonine kinase SAD-1 in C. elegans regulates synapse development.

Introduction of SCR into presynaptic superior cervical ganglion neurons in culture significantly inhibits evoked synaptic transmission. Moreover, SCR decreases the size of the readily releasable pool measured by applying hypertonic sucrose. Furthermore, SAD-B phosphorylates the active zone protein RIM1 but not Munc13-1. These results suggest that mammalian SAD kinase presynaptically regulates neurotransmitter release. Neurotransmitter release is mediated by exocytosis in a temporally and spatially coordinated manner. In the classical synaptic vesicle (SV) cycling pathway, SVs filled with appropriate neurotransmitters are reserved as a pool, the reserve pool, and are transported to the active zone specialized for exocytosis (Südhof, 1995Südhof T.C. The synaptic vesicle cycle: a cascade of protein-protein interactions.Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). SVs, docked to the active zone and undergoing a prefusion step or priming, are ready for vesicle fusion and release of neurotransmitters (Südhof, 1995Südhof T.C. The synaptic vesicle cycle: a cascade of protein-protein interactions.Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). These SVs are thought to compose a vesicle pool distinguished as the readily releasable pool (RRP) (Birks and MacIntosh, 1961Birks R. MacIntosh F.C. Acetylcholine metabolism of a sympathetic ganglion.Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1961; 39: 787-827Crossref Google Scholar). After completion of these steps, SV proteins and membrane components are retrieved by endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits and recycled through early endosomes (Cremona and De Camilli, 1997Cremona O. De Camilli P. Synaptic vesicle endocytosis.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, Hay and Scheller, 1997Hay J.C. Scheller R.H. SNAREs and NSF in targeted membrane fusion.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). SVs are the key organelle in this process of vesicle cycling, and numerous SV proteins have been isolated and characterized (Südhof, 1995Südhof T.C. The synaptic vesicle cycle: a cascade of protein-protein interactions.Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar, Südhof, 2004Südhof T.C. The synaptic vesicle cycle.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 509-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). But, it is still tempting to speculate that other regulatory proteins remain to be identified in SV docking, priming, and fusion. The active zone beneath the presynaptic membrane is the principal site for Ca2+-dependent exocytosis (Landis et al., 1988Landis D.M.D. Hall A.K. Weinstein L.A. Reese T.S. The organization of cytoplasm at the presynaptic active zone of a central nervous system synapse.Neuron. 1988; 1: 201-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). It has been assumed that the cytomatrix at the active zone (CAZ) is involved in determining the site of SV fusion, but molecular mechanisms by which SVs properly localize at the CAZ remain elusive. Presently, the full molecular composition of the CAZ is unclear, but several CAZ proteins, including CAST/ERC2, ELKS, RIM1, Munc13-1, Piccolo/Aczonin, and Bassoon, are known (Brose et al., 1995Brose N.

RIM1 and Munc13-1 directly bind to each other and are implicated in SV priming (Betz et al., 2001Betz A. Thakur P. Junge H.J. Ashery U. Rhee J.S. Scheuss V. Rosenmund C. Rettig J. Brose N.

CAST and ELKS are novel active zone proteins highly homologous to each other, which directly bind RIMs, Bassoon, and Piccolo, and thought to play a role in neurotransmitter release by binding these active zone proteins (Ohtsuka et al., 2002Ohtsuka T.

Neurol. 2006; 495: 480-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown how SV proteins are molecularly linked to this CAST- dependent molecular complex at the active zone. SAD-1 in C. elegans was first identified by genetic screens to isolate mutations that affect SV clusters in sensory neurons (Crump et al., 2001Crump J.G. Zhen M. Jin Y. Bargmann C.I. The SAD-1 kinase regulates presynaptic vesicle clustering and axon termination.Neuron. 2001; 29: 115-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Indeed, the sad-1 mutant animal shows several unique features in its synaptic structure and function, such as the diffuse and disorganized distribution of SVs at synapses and a failure to develop normal synapses in sensory axons. Most mutations occur in the kinase domain, suggesting that this domain of SAD-1 may play an important role in the formation of synapses. Recently, KO mice for SAD-1 orthologs (SAD kinases) have been reported (Kishi et al., 2005Kishi M. Pan Y.A. Crump J.G. Sanes J.R. Mammalian SAD kinases are required for neuronal polarization.Science. 2005; 307: 929-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Analysis of the mutant animals shows that mammalian SAD kinases are required for neural polarity that produces axons and dendrites with distinct properties, which is promoted at least in part by phosphorylating the microtubule-associated protein Tau (Kishi et al., 2005Kishi M. Pan Y.A. Crump J.G. Sanes J.R. Mammalian SAD kinases are required for neuronal polarization.Science. 2005; 307: 929-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Although these genetic studies have revealed that SAD kinases regulate various aspects of early synapse development, the biochemical properties and the physiological functions of SAD kinases at mature synapses remain largely unknown. To test if SAD-1 is also involved in synaptic functions such as neurotransmitter release in vertebrates, we had isolated and characterized human orthologs of SAD-1. Human SAD-1 comprised at least two family members, tentatively named SAD-A and SAD-B, both of which were specifically expressed in the brain. In the present study, we demonstrate that SAD kinase is a novel SV- and presynaptic cytomatrix-associated protein that regulates neurotransmitter release at mature synapses. To isolate a mammalian ortholog of C. elegans SAD-1, we first searched the GenBank database with the primary sequence of SAD-1 and found several cDNA fragments that were homologous to SAD-1 cDNA (data not shown). By screening a human cDNA library, we obtained two full-length cDNAs, and named them SAD-A and SAD-B. Although SAD-A consisted of 696 aa with a calculated molecular weight of 77,597, SAD-B consisted of 778 aa with a calculated molecular weight of 85,086. Both SAD-A and SAD-B had similar domain organizations to that of C. elegans SAD-1 (Figure 1A). The NH2-terminal serine/threonine kinase (STK) domain was well conserved and almost identical between SAD-A and SAD-B (94% identity). In addition, two short conserved regions (SCR1 and SCR2) (Crump et al., 2001Crump J.G. Zhen M. Jin Y. Bargmann C.I. The SAD-1 kinase regulates presynaptic vesicle clustering and axon termination.Neuron. 2001; 29: 115-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) existed in the middle and COOH-terminal regions. Northern blot analysis showed that the ∼3.5 kb band of SAD-B was specifically detected in the brain (Figure S1A). SAD-A was also specifically expressed in the brain (data not shown). Both the proteins were structurally related to each other and specifically expressed in the brain, and then we focused on SAD-B. We next produced a polyclonal antibody (Ab) against SAD-B that specifically detected SAD-B, but not SAD-A (Figure S1B). Tissue distribution analysis showed that the anti-SAD-B Ab recognized a protein band of ∼90 kDa in rat brain, but not in other rat tissues (Figure 1B), indicating that SAD-B is specifically expressed in the brain. Western blotting revealed that SAD-B was expressed in various rat brain regions, including the hippocampus, the cortex, the cerebellum, the amygdala, and the olfactory bulb (data not shown). Consistently, a widespread immunoreactivity for SAD-B was detected throughout mouse brain (Figure S1C). We then examined in more detail the localization of SAD-B in mouse hippocampus and cerebellum by immunohistochemistry and compared the staining pattern of SAD-B with that of synaptophysin. In the CA3 region of the hippocampus, the immunofluorescence signal for SAD-B overlapped with that of synaptophysin (Figure 1C). In the cerebellum, SAD-B showed a similar signal pattern in the molecular and granular cell layers, which colocalized with that of synaptophysin (Figure 1D). Note that the signal of SAD-B was also detected in the cell bodies. These results suggest that SAD-B is relatively concentrated and localized at the synapses. In primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons, SAD-B showed a dot-like signal along the dendrites that colocalized well with that of synaptophysin, although immunoreactivity of SAD-B was slightly detected in the cell body and dendrites (Figure 1E, top). In addition, the signal for SAD-B partially colocalized with those of the active zone protein Bassoon and the well-known postsynaptic density (PSD) protein PSD-95/SAP90 (Cho et al., 1992Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B.

Chem. 1993; 268: 4580-4583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 1E, middle and bottom). These results also support the notion that SAD-B is a synaptic protein. We used immunoelectron microscopy to examine the subsynaptic localization of SAD-B. Immunoelectron microscopic analysis of cultured neurons showed that immunogold-labeled signals of SAD-B were mainly detected in presynaptic nerve terminals (Figure 2A). The signal of SAD-B appeared to be associated with SVs. Interestingly, some of the signals were detected very close to the presynaptic plasma membrane. Note that several signals of SAD-B were also detected in the dendrites (Figure 2A) and cell bodies (data not shown). These results further support the notion that SAD-B is mainly present in the presynaptic nerve terminals. Consistent with these results, subcellular distribution analysis in rat brain showed that SAD-B was relatively concentrated in the crude synaptic vesicle (CSV) fraction (Figure 2B), which was similar to that for synaptophysin. Further fractionation of the CSV fraction produced SV1-SV4 fractions, of which the SV1 fraction contains the most pure sample of SVs (Mizoguchi et al., 1989Mizoguchi A. Ueda T. Ikeda K. Shiku H. Mizoguti H. Takai Y. Localization and subcellular distribution of cellular ras gene products in rat brain.Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1989; 5: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). SAD-B and synaptophysin were mainly detected in the SV1 and SV2 fractions (Figure 2C). In addition, the SVs immunoisolated by an anti-synaptotagmin I Ab contained synaptophysin and SAD-B (Figure 2D, left). Under the same conditions, the SVs immunoisolated by the anti-SAD-B Ab contained synaptophysin and synaptotagmin I (Figure 2D, right). Therefore, these results suggest that SAD-B is an SV-associated protein. In addition, SAD-B and synaptophysin were detected in the crude synaptic membrane (CSM) fraction (Figure 2B), suggesting that both proteins were associated with docked SVs. Moreover, like the active zone protein CAST and the PSD protein NMDA receptor, SAD-B was concentrated in the biochemically isolated PSD fraction, whereas synaptophysin was almost completely absent from this fraction (Figure 2B). The biochemically isolated PSD fraction is known to contain not only PSD proteins but also the active zone proteins CAST, RIMs, Bassoon, and Piccolo (Cases-Langhoff et al., 1996Cases-Langhoff C.

Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Thus, the signal of SAD-B in the PSD fraction appears to correspond to that of SAD-B, which localized close to the presynaptic membrane (see Figure 2A). In addition, SAD-B was resistant to solubilization by CHAPS, a zwitter ionic detergent, and NP-40 and Triton X-100, nonionic detergents, in contrast to synaptophysin (Figure 2e). This biochemical property of SAD-B was similar to those of the CAZ proteins CAST (Figure 2E, bottom) (Ohtsuka et al., 2002Ohtsuka T. Takao-Rikitsu E. Inoue E. Inoue M. Takeuchi M. Matsubara K. Deguchi-Tawarada M. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. CAST: a novel protein of the cytomatrix at the active zone of synapses that forms a ternary complex with RIM1 and Munc13-1.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), RIM1, Bassoon, and Piccolo. But, unlike CAST, SAD-B was slightly solubilized with the nonionic detergents, which might be at least partly consistent with the immunorectivity for SAD-B in the cell bodies and dendrites of neurons (see Figures 1E and 2A) and its association with SVs. At any rate, these results suggest that some portions of SAD-B are tightly associated with the presynaptic cytomatrix. We next performed a cell biological analysis to confirm the tight association of SAD-B with the presynaptic cytomatrix. To do this, we briefly treated cultured neurons with Triton X-100 before paraformaldehyde-fixation and then stained synaptic proteins such as synaptophysin, SAD-B, CAST, and Bassoon. Under such conditions, synaptophysin, a Triton X-100-soluble SV protein, was shown to be almost completely extracted, whereas Bassoon was hardly extracted (Dresbach et al., 2003Dresbach T. Hempelmann A. Spilker C. tom Dieck S. Altrock W.D. Zuschratter W. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. Functional regions of the presynaptic cytomatrix protein bassoon: significance for synaptic targeting and cytomatrix anchoring.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, synaptophysin was completely washed out (Figure 3A), whereas Bassoon was preserved (Figure 3B). Like Bassoon, another prominent CAZ protein CAST was also preserved (Figures 3A and 3B). Under the same conditions, SAD-B was indeed preserved like these CAZ proteins (Figures 3C and 3D). Moreover, immunoelectron microscopic analysis with these Triton X-100-treated cultured neurons revealed that SAD-B was associated with the presynaptic cytomatrix (Figure 3E). These results suggest that SAD-B is associated with SVs and incorporated into and tightly associated with the presynaptic cytomatrix. We next examined the mechanism of the localization of SAD-B in primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons by expressing their various mutants. The various SAD-B mutants are schematically shown in Figure 4A. We first expressed the full-length of SAD-B. EGFP-SAD-B-1 colocalized with synaptophysin at the synaptic boutons (Figure 4B). EGFP-SAD-B-2, which had only the STK domain, showed diffuse distribution in cultured neurons (data not shown). In contrast, EGFP-SAD-B-4, which lacked the STK domain but had two SCRs, colocalized with synaptophysin (Figure 4B). EGFP-SAD-B-5, which lacked the STK domain but had SCR2, colocalized with synaptophysin (data not shown). EGFP-SAD-B-6, which had SCR2, colocalized with synaptophysin, whereas EGFP-SAD-B-3, which lacked the COOH terminus containing SCR2, showed a diffuse distribution (Figure 4B). These results suggest that SAD-B synaptically localizes in cultured neurons through its COOH-terminal region containing SCR2. The unique localization of SAD-B on SVs and at the presynaptic cytomatrix suggests that SAD-B is involved in neurotransmitter release in the nerve terminals. To test this, we examined the role of SAD-B in neurotransmission by transfection of the SAD-B constructs in primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons, followed by electrophysiological studies. The kinase domain of SAD-B belongs to those of other STKs such as cAMPKa and MARK1 (Hanks et al., 1988Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. The protein kinase family: conserved features and deduced phylogeny of the catalytic domains.Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3720) Google Scholar, Drewes et al., 1997Drewes G.

MARK, a novel family of protein kinases that phosphorylate microtubule-associated proteins and trigger microtubule disruption.Cell. 1997; 89: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). In these kinases, a conserved lysine residue located in the ATP binding site is essential for their kinase activity (Hanks et al., 1988Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. The protein kinase family: conserved features and deduced phylogeny of the catalytic domains.Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3720) Google Scholar). In fact, the substitution of the lysine residue to arginine abolishes the kinase activity of these kinases (Drewes et al., 1997Drewes G. Ebneth A. Preuss U. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. MARK, a novel family of protein kinases that phosphorylate microtubule-associated proteins and trigger microtubule disruption.Cell. 1997; 89: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, Zhong et al., 1997Zhong H.

The transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB is regulated by the IkappaB-associated PKAc subunit through a cyclic AMP-independent mechanism.Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). This lysine residue is also conserved as lysine 63 in SAD-B (Figure 5A). We thus substituted the lysine residue of SAD-B to the arginine residue (Figure 5A) to obtain a kinase-deficient mutant of SAD-B (EGFP-SAD-B-1K63R) (see Figure 8). After transfecting the cultured neurons with EGFP-SAD-B-1wild and EGFP-SAD-B-1K63R, we measured miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) by blocking sodium-channel-mediated action potential activity with tetrodotoxin (TTX) under whole-cell voltage clamp. Overexpression of EGFP-SAD-B-1 significantly increased the frequency of mEPSC by approximately 6-fold (n = 8 for EGFP-SAD-B-1, EGFP-SAD-B-1 versus control, p < 0.01), whereas control EGFP or EGFP-SAD-B-1K63R had no effect on the frequency (Figures 5B and 5C). No significant change of its amplitude was observed by overexpression of all the constructs (Figure 5D). In addition, no significant difference in the average rise time and decay time of mEPSC was detected (data not shown), suggesting that SAD-B may not be involved in the fusion of SVs. It is possible that the absence of significant effects on mEPSC frequency upon overexpression of dominant-negative EGFP-SAD-B-1K63R might be due to the low basal level of spontaneous transmitter release occurring at a normal Ca2+ concentration (Figures 5B and 5C). We then performed the same experiment at 10 mM external Ca2+, which enhanced basal mEPSC frequencies. Although no significant change in amplitude, rise time, or decay time was observed under these conditions (data not shown), the mEPSC frequency was increased ∼1.8-fold by overexpression of EGFP-SAD-B-1wild (n = 11 for EGFP-SAD-B-1wild versus control, p < 0.01) and was significantly decreased by overexpression of EGFP-SAD-B-1K63R (∼0.6-fold) (Figure 5E and 5F). These results suggest that the SAD-B kinase activity is involved in the regulation of SV release probability. To confirm neurotransmitter specificity of the observed effects, mEPSCs were abolished with 50 μM CNQX (data not shown), indicating that SAD-B regulates AMPA receptor-mediated neurotransmission by a presynaptic mechanism. Because SAD-1 in C. elegans has been shown to be involved in synapse formation, such as the clustering of SVs (Crump et al., 2001Crump J.G. Zhen M. Jin Y. Bargmann C.I. The SAD-1 kinase regulates presynaptic vesicle clustering and axon termination.Neuron. 2001; 29: 115-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), we examined whether such a developmental effect may be a basis for the SAD-B function in neurotransmitter release. We coexpressed SAD-B with synaptophysin-EGFP or EGFP-Bassoon and examinined the change of the size and number of the EGFP and endogenous signal: we assumed that the staining signals for synaptophysin and Bassoon reflect those of SVs and active zones, respectively. A quantitative analysis showed no significant change in the size and number of synaptophysin or Bassoon immunoreactive puncta (Figures S3 and S4). Thus, developmental changes do not appear to contribute to the SAD function in neurotransmitter release. We next examined the mode of action of SAD-B at a well-characterized cholinergic synapse formed between cultured rat superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons (Mochida et al., 1994Mochida S.

This is an ideal system because proteins can be introduced into the relatively large (30–40 μm) presynaptic cell bodies by microinjection, the injected proteins can rapidly diffuse to nerve terminals forming synapses with adjacent neurons, and the effect on stimulated release of acetylcholine can be accurately monitored by recording excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoke"
https://openalex.org/W2054484620,"To investigate the role of the entorhinal cortex in memory at a molecular level, we developed transgenic mice in which transgene expression was inducible and limited to the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex, pre- and parasubiculum. We found that expression of a constitutively active mutant form of CaMKII in these structures disrupted spatial memory formation. Immediate post-training activation of the transgene disrupted previously established memory while transgene activation 3 weeks following the training was ineffective. These results demonstrate that, similar to the hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex plays a time-limited role in spatial memory formation but is not a final cortical repository of long-term memory. Moreover, these results suggest that the indiscriminate activation of CaMKII is able to disrupt preexisting memories, possibly by altering the pattern of synaptic weight changes that are thought to form the basis of the memory trace."
https://openalex.org/W2017469965,"Zinc transporters play important roles in a wide range of biochemical processes. Here we report an important function of ZnT5/ZnT6 hetero-oligomeric complexes in the secretory pathway. The activity of human tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expressed in ZnT5–ZnT7–/– cells was significantly reduced compared with that expressed in wild-type cells as in the case of endogenous chicken tissue-nonspecific ALP activity. The inactive human tissue-nonspecific ALP in ZnT5–ZnT7–/– cells was degraded by proteasome-mediated degradation without being trafficked to the plasma membrane. ZnT5–ZnT7–/– cells showed exacerbation of the unfolded protein response as did the wild-type cells cultured under a zinc-deficient condition, revealing that both complexes play a role in homeostatic maintenance of secretory pathway function. Furthermore, we showed that expression of ZnT5 mRNA was up-regulated by the endoplasmic reticulum stress in various cell lines. The up-regulation of the hZnT5 transcript was mediated by transcription factor XBP1 through the TGACGTGG sequence in the hZnT5 promoter, and this sequence was highly conserved in the ZnT5 genes of mouse and chicken. These results suggest that zinc transport into the secretory pathway is strictly regulated for the homeostatic maintenance of secretory pathway function in vertebrate cells.

A large number of secretory and membrane-bound proteins become properly folded and assembled for their full biological activity in the secretory pathway as typified by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 3The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; UPR, unfolded protein response; ZnT, zinc transporter; TNAP, tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase; hTNAP, human TNAP; cTNAP, chicken TNAP; FCS, fetal calf serum; Tm, tunicamycin; TPEN, N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; DTT, dithiothreitol.

To ensure the protein quality in the pathway, the cell has evolved an adaptive coordinated response, which limits further accumulation of unfolded nonnative proteins. This signaling pathway is termed the unfolded protein response (UPR) or the ER stress response (2Kaufman R.J. Scheuner D. Schroder M. Shen X. Lee K. Liu C.Y. Arnold S.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 3Zhang K. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25935-25938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The UPR is the conserved cellular response among eukaryotic cells and is composed of three major responses; they are translational attenuations to decrease the protein-folding load on the ER, induction of the transcriptions of a large set genes such as ER chaperones to increase the volume and capacity for protein folding, and the degradation of unfolded proteins called ER-associated degradation to remove the nonnative proteins from the ER (4Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Mutat. Res. 2005; 569: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). Moreover, the cells that sustained irreparable levels of damage caused by the ER stress are eliminated by programmed cell death (5Shen X. Zhang K. Kaufman R.J. J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2004; 28: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). There are numerous proteins that become functional by binding with zinc during their itinerary in the secretory pathway, e.g. ER chaperones such as Scj1 and calreticulin (6Nishikawa S.I. Fewell S.W. Kato Y. Brodsky J.L. Endo T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 7Saito Y. Ihara Y. Leach M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Williams D.B.

Recently, Ellis et al. (10Ellis C.D. Wang F. MacDiarmid C.W. Clark S. Lyons T. Eide D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) showed that genes of the ER chaperone that are involved in the UPR were induced by zinc deficiency in genome-wide cDNA microarray analysis in yeast (10Ellis C.D. Wang F. MacDiarmid C.W. Clark S. Lyons T. Eide D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The UPR induction by zinc deficiency was exacerbated in mutant yeast deficient in Msc2 and/or Zrg17 that function as a major route of zinc entry into the ER through the formation of the hetero-oligomeric complexes (10Ellis C.D. Wang F. MacDiarmid C.W. Clark S. Lyons T. Eide D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 11Ellis C.D. Macdiarmid C.W. Eide D.J. J. Biol.

Furthermore, they showed that the UPR was increased by zinc deficiency in mammalian cells by performing transient transfection using the sensitive synthetic ER stress-responsive reporter plasmid (10Ellis C.D. Wang F. MacDiarmid C.W. Clark S. Lyons T. Eide D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), which indicates that zinc has important physiological functions in the UPR in mammals. We have recently shown that two oligomeric zinc transport complexes, ZnT5/ZnT6 hetero-oligomeric complexes and ZnT7 homo-oligomeric complexes, are required for zinc incorporation into alkaline phosphatases (12Suzuki T.

In this study we demonstrate that ZnT5/ZnT6 hetero-oligomeric complexes contribute to the homeostatic maintenance of secretory pathway function using DT40 cells deficient in both complexes (specifically ZnT5–ZnT7–/– cells in this study). Furthermore, we show that ZnT5 mRNA expression was transcriptionally up-regulated by ER stress and that the up-regulation was mediated by XBP1 via the TGACGTGG sequence in the ZnT5 promoter. These findings suggest that a positive feedback regulation may operate to maintain the homeostasis of secretory pathway function via the ZnT5 transcript in vertebrate cells. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa and DT40 cells were maintained as described previously (12Suzuki T. Ishihara K. Migaki H. Matsuura W. Kohda A. Okumura K. Nagao M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Kambe T. J.

MIN6 cells (gift from Dr. Susumu Seino, Chiba University) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (BioWest) and 10 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) at 37 °C. TT2 cells (a gift from by Dr. Yoichi Shinkai, Kyoto University) were cultured on the feeder cells treated with 10 μg/ml mitomycin C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with heat-inactivated 15% embryonic stem cell-qualified FCS (Invitrogen), 100 μm nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 10 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 103 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (Chemicon) at 37 °C. DT40 cells were transiently transfected by electroporation. Briefly, plasmid DNA was electroporated into the cells (5 × 106 cells) suspended in 0.4 ml of cold potassium phosphate-buffered saline (30.8 mm NaCl, 120.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.46 mm KH2PO4, and 5 mm MgCl2) with a Gene Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad) at 600 V and 25 microfarads. After electroporation, the cell was transferred into fresh growth medium for 3 h and then incubated with growth medium containing indicated the chemicals or not for another 13 h. In a zinc-deficient condition, the cells were precultured for 24 h in zinc-free medium containing Chelex-treated FCS (12Suzuki T. Ishihara K. Migaki H. Matsuura W. Kohda A. Okumura K. Nagao M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Kambe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 637-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and then cultured for 13 h in the same medium after electroporation. Transient transfection into HeLa cells was performed as described previously (15Kambe T. Tada-Kambe J. Kuge Y. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Nagao M. Sasaki R. Blood. 2000; 96: 3265-3271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells grown to 70% confluency in 12-well plates were transfected with plasmid DNA using Trans IT-LT1 (PanVera). After transfection the medium was replaced with the fresh growth medium containing the indicated chemicals or not, and the plates were incubated for another 18 h. DNA transfection into DT40 cells to establish stable transformants was carried out as described previously (12Suzuki T. Ishihara K. Migaki H. Matsuura W. Kohda A. Okumura K. Nagao M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Kambe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 637-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For screening, we used 0.25–0.35 mg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen), 0.5 μg/ml for Puromycin (Sigma). More than three independent clones per transfectant were established. Immunoblotting and Lectin Blotting—Proteins were separated by electrophoresis through 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described previously. After transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-ECL, Amersham Biosciences), the blot was blocked with blocking solution (5% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline) and then incubated with anti-hTNAP (1:2000 dilution) antibody in blocking solution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated) secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used at a 1:5000 dilution. Lectin blotting was performed using biotin-wheat germ agglutinin (Seikagaku Kogyo) after blocking with blocking solution (0.5 m NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The avidin-biotin complex was formed with a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). Super Signal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) was used for detection. The fluoroimage was obtained using LAS1000 plus (Fuji). Metabolic Labeling—Cells (3 × 106 cells/ml) were precultured in the medium supplemented with dialyzed FCS for 45 min. Then the cells were pulse-labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 10 min and chased with the regular culture medium containing 1 mm cold methionine/cysteine for the indicated period after washing with phosphate-buffered saline. For immunoprecipitation cells were lysed with lysis buffer (1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 0.05% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline) and rotated with anti-hTNAP antibody for 2 h at 4°C. After rotating, 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added and rotated for 3 h at 4°C. The Sepharose beads containing immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed 3 times with lysis buffer, and lysed with 6× SDS sample buffer at 95 °C followed by electrophoresis through 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The radiographic images were obtained using a BAS 2500 Bioimaging analyzer (Fuji) after enhancement by treating it with Enlightning (PerkinElmer) for 15 min. For digestion with endoglycosidase H (Endo H) (Calbiochem), aliquots of the immunoprecipitates with anti-hTNAP antibody/protein A-Sepharose beads were resuspended in 10 μl Endo H lysis buffer (250 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and incubated with or without Endo H for 8 h at 37°C after denaturation for 5 min at 100 °C. After centrifugation at 20,400 × g for 5 min, the supernatant containing human TNAP (hTNAP) digested by Endo H was analyzed by SDS-PAGE/radiography. For inhibition of the degradation in proteasomes, 25 or 100 μm MG132 (Peptide institute) was added in the chased medium after pulse-labeling. Immunofluoresence Staining—Immunofluorescence for hTNAP was performed as described previously (12Suzuki T. Ishihara K. Migaki H. Matsuura W. Kohda A. Okumura K. Nagao M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Kambe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 637-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). DT40 cells expressing hTNAP fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde were immunostained with anti-hTNAP antibody (1:200 dilution) without permeabilization followed by donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) as the secondary antibody. The stained cells were observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Fluoview, Olympus). RNA Preparation and Northern Blotting—Total RNA was extracted from DT40, HeLa, MIN6, and TT2 cells cultured in the presence or absence of tunicamycin (Tm) for the indicated periods or cultured under the indicated conditions using Sepasol I (Nacalai). Northern blotting was performed as described previously (12Suzuki T. Ishihara K. Migaki H. Matsuura W. Kohda A. Okumura K. Nagao M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Kambe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 637-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The membrane was hybridized to the appropriately radiolabeled cDNA probes and exposed to an imaging plate (Fuji). Radiographic images were obtained using a BAS 2500 Bioimaging analyzer (Fuji). Quantification of the band intensity was performed on a Macintosh iBook G4 computer using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the United States National Institutes of Health and available from the Internet by anonymous ftp from zippy.nimh.nih.gov). Plasmids Construction—BAC clones containing hZnT5 genomic DNA were screened using the BAC Library Screening Service (Genome Systems Inc.). A 3.5-kilobase SacI-SmaI fragment that contained 5′-flanking and 5′-untranslated regions just upstream of start ATG of hZnT5 gene was recovered from a BAC clone and subcloned into the SacI and SmaI sites upstream of luciferase reporter gene in pPGV-B2 plasmid (Toyo Inc.). This plasmid was named –3.3K. The deletion construct containing 0.9 or 0.11 kilobases of a 5′-flanking region was generated by eliminating the fragment of –3.3 ∼ –0.9 or –3.3 ∼ –0.11 from –3.3K by digestion with the appropriate restriction enzyme and named –0.9K or –0.11K. The mutant –0.11K plasmids in which TGACGTGG sequence (from –57 to –50, numbering is defined as the transcription starting site as +1) was substituted by TTCATTGG (substitutions were underlined) were constructed by PCR-based mutagenesis strategy. The p5xATF6GL3 plasmid was a gift from Dr. Ron Prywes (Columbia University), and the GRP78 promoter construct and the splice-formed XBP1 (active form) expression plasmid were gifts from Dr. Kazutoshi Mori (Kyoto University). The plasmid to express hTNAP was constructed by inserting hTNAP cDNA into pA-Puro vector. The constitutive active protein kinase A expression plasmid (pFC-PKA) was purchased from Stratagene. Determination of the Transcription Start Site of hZnT5 Gene—The cap site hunting kit (Nippon Gene) was used for determination of the transcription start site. Briefly, the first PCR was performed using the human kidney cap site cDNA (Nippon Gene) as a template with the forward primer (5′-GATGCTAGCTGCGAGTCAAGTC-3′) that is complementary to the cap oligonucleotide sequence ligated to the cap site and the reverse primer (571R, 5′-GCAGCAAAGTCCTTAGTGGTC-3′, numbering is defined as the transcription starting site as +1) that anneals with cDNA of hZnT5. A nested PCR was performed using the amplified fragment as a template with the primers 5′-CGAGTCAAGTCGACGAAGTGC-3′ (forward) for the cap oligonucleotide and 290R, 5′-GTTAATCGAGCGCTGGGTACG-3′ (reverse), for hZnT5. The nested PCR product was inserted into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and sequenced. Recovery of the Promoter Region of Chicken ZnT5 Gene—The upstream sequence from exon 1 of cZnT5 gene was not available in Chicken Genome Resources (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/chicken/), and therefore, this region was recovered by PCR amplification from DT40 genomic DNA with the specific primers, a forward primer (5′-TCTTACCCCAAAACCACAGCGAGCCGTCTC-3′) that was designated based on the sequence of exon 1 of LOC427172 gene located adjacent to cZnT5 gene and a reverse primer (5′-GCCTGGCTGCTGTACTTTTCCTCCATGCCG-3′) that was designated based on the sequence of exon 1 of cZnT5 gene. The amplified product containing the cZnT5 promoter region was sequenced on both strands (see GenBank™ accession number DQ382267). Luciferase and β-Galactosidase Assays—Cell extracts were prepared from DT40 cells using passive lysis buffer (Promega). The activities of firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase were measured using Dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) with Lumat LB9051 (Berthold). Firefly luciferase activity was divided by Renilla luciferase activity for normalization of transfection efficiency. Luciferase activity and β-galactosidase activity in HeLa cells were measured as described previously (16Kambe T. Tada J. Chikuma M. Masuda S. Nagao M. Tsuchiya T. Ratcliffe P.J. Sasaki R. Blood. 1998; 91: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hTNAP Expressed in ZnT5–ZnT7 –/– Cells Is Degraded during the Secretory Process—We previously reported that the inactive placenta alkaline phosphatase expressed in ZnT5–ZnT7 –/– cells was transported to the plasma membrane as is the active placenta alkaline phosphatase expressed in wild-type cells despite having little activity (12Suzuki T. Ishihara K. Migaki H. Matsuura W. Kohda A. Okumura K. Nagao M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Kambe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 637-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To examine whether this is also the case for other zinc-requiring enzymes, we established ZnT5–ZnT7–/– cells and wild-type cells that stably express hTNAP. The total TNAP activity (exogenous hTNAP plus endogenous chicken TNAP (cTNAP)) in wild-type cells expressing hTNAP was increased about 25-fold, but that in ZnT5–ZnT7–/– cells expressing hTNAP was significantly reduced as in the case of cTNAP (Fig. 1A). Expression of hZnT5 in ZnT5–ZnT7–/– cells expressing hTNAP restored the reduced activity to the level comparable with that in wild-type cells expressing hTNAP as described in endogenous cTNAP (Fig. 1A) (12Suzuki T. Ishihara K. Migaki H. Matsuura W. Kohda A. Okumura K. Nagao M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Kambe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 637-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). By immunoblot analysis, hTNAP was mostly detected as the ∼80-kDa form in wild-type cells but mainly as the ∼60-kDa form in ZnT5–ZnT7–/– cells (Fig. 1B). Expression of hZnT5 increased the amount of the ∼80-kDa form, although the ∼60-kDa form still remained (Fig. 1B). To investigate why hTNAP was detected in different molecular sizes in these cells, we performed a pulse-chase experiment using [35S]methionine/cysteine. The hTNAP in the wild-type cells was detected as the ∼60-kDa form just after the 10-min pulse (at 0 h) and shifted to the ∼80-kDa form with time up to 4 h (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–4). In contrast, the hTNAP in ZnT5–ZnT7–/– cells were detected as the ∼60-kDa form at 0 h to the extent similar to wild-type cells (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 5) but was only slightly detected as the ∼80-kDa form at 4 h (Fig. 2A, lanes 4-8). Expression of hZnT5 restored the ∼80-kDa form of hTNAP with time up to 4 h (Fig. 2A, lanes 9–12). The ∼60-kDa form was sensitive, and the ∼80-kDa was resistant to Endo-H digestion, which indicated that the former corresponded to the N-linked high mannose-type hTNAP before being trafficked to the medial-Golgi apparatus, whereas the latter was the complex carbohydrate-type after that (Fig. 2B). A slight amount of the ∼80-kDa form of hTNAP expressed in ZnT5–ZnT7–/– cells was hardly detected on the plasma membrane by indirect immunofluorescence staining without permeabilization (Fig. 2C), which indicated that the hTNAP expressed in ZnT5–ZnT7–/– cells was rapidly degraded intracellularly before being trafficked to the plasma membrane. Several mutants of hTNAP associated with lethal hypophosphatasia, an inherited disorder featured by defective bone mineralization, shows properties similar to the hTNAP expressed in ZnT5–ZnT7–/– cells and are degraded in the proteasomes because of defective folding (17Fukushi M. Amizuka N. Hoshi K. Ozawa H. Kumagai H. Omura S. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Oda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Ishida Y. Komaru K. Ito M. Amaya Y. Kohno S. Oda K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We considered whether or not this holds true in the case of hTNAP expressed in ZnT5–ZnT7–/– cells. The proteasomal inhibitor MG132 blocked the degradation of hTNAP in ZnT5–ZnT7–/– cells, resulting in increases of hTNAP of both the ∼60- and the ∼80-kDa forms (Fig. 2D). Taken together, the hTNAP expressed in ZnT5–ZnT7–/– cells was degraded by proteasome-mediated degradation before being trafficked to the medial-Golgi apparatus and to the plasma membrane, which was quite different from the case of placenta alkaline phosphatase (12Suzuki T. Ishihara K. Migaki H. Matsuura W. Kohda A. Okumura K. Nagao M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Kambe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 637-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The UPR Was Exacerbated in ZnT5–ZnT7–/– Cells—The hTNAP was degraded during the secretory process in ZnT5–ZnT7–/– cells, which suggested that the homeostatic maintenance of secretory pathway function might be affected in the cells. To examine this possibility, we first examined whether or not the glycosylation pathway was affected in ZnT5–ZnT7–/– cells. Lectin blotting using wheat germ agglutinin showed no differences between wild-type cells and ZnT5–ZnT7–/– cells (Fig. 3A), which indicated that glycosylation was unaffected in ZnT5–ZnT7–/– cells. Then we examined whether or not UPR pathway was affected in ZnT5–ZnT7–/– cells by comparing the expression of GRP78 mRNA between wild-type cells and ZnT5–ZnT7–/– cells because the GRP78 is known to be one of the most inducible genes in response to the ER stress (19Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, the GRP78 mRNA expression in ZnT5–ZnT7–/– cells was not significantly changed under normal culture conditions but increased when the cell was treated with Tm, a potent ER stress inducer, which indicates that the UPR was exacerbated in ZnT5–ZnT7–/– cells. Furthermore, the exacerbation was ensured by reporter analysis using p5xATF6GL3 plasmid that has a sensitive synthetic ER stress-inducible promoter with five repeats of the ATF6 site upstream of the firefly luciferase gene (20Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the luciferase activity in ZnT5–ZnT7–/– cells transiently transfected with p5xATF6GL3 plasmid was not significantly increased under normal culture condition but increased by treating the cell with DTT, another ER stress inducer (Fig. 3C). We next examined whether or not zinc deficiency in the secretory pathway exacerbated the UPR. The increased GRP78 mRNA expression in wild-type DT40 cells by Tm treatment was enhanced in the presence of 5 μm concentrations of the zinc chelator N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) (Fig. 3D), and the increased luciferase activity by DTT treatment was enhanced in the cells cultured in zinc-free medium containing Chelex-treated FCS (Fig. 3E). These results indicate that zinc transport complexes would have important contributions in homeostatic maintenance of secretory pathway function. The Expression of cZnT5 mRNA Is Up-regulated by the ER Stress—Transcripts of many genes whose products are involved in the homeostatic maintenance of secretory pathway function are induced by the ER stress (21Okada T.

Zinc deficiency in the secretory pathway increased the UPR, which raised the possibility that a feedback mechanism(s) facilitating zinc transport into the pathway may operate. To examine this possibility, we examined whether or not the expression of ZnT5, ZnT6, and ZnT7 mRNAs was up-regulated. The expression of ZnT5 mRNA was clearly up-regulated in the same UPR condition as in Fig. 3D, and that of ZnT6 and ZnT7 mRNA was also slightly up-regulated in this condition, although the degree of the effect was less than that of ZnT5 (Fig. 4A). Consequently, we examined the up-regulation of ZnT5 mRNA expression in more detail. The up-regulation of ZnT5 mRNA expression was dependent on the concentration of Tm and peaked at 4 h after Tm treatment (Fig. 4B). The pattern of the up-regulation was similar to that of the GRP78, although the degree of the effect was lower (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that the up-regulation of the ZnT5 mRNA expression is directly regulated by UPR signaling in DT40 cells. Up-regulation of the ZnT5 mRNA Expression by the ER Stress Is Conserved among Vertebrate Cells—We next examined whether or not up-regulation of the ZnT5 mRNA expression by the ER stress was conserved in mammalian cells. The up-regulation was observed in all tested mammalian cell lines in a manner similar to that in DT40 cells, but the degree of the effect was dependent on the cell types; in most cell lines the degree was relatively low, as in the case of HeLa cells (Fig. 5A, top) but it was higher (∼3.7-fold) in some secretory cell lines like mouse insulinoma, MIN6 cells, or mouse embryonic stem cells, TT2 cells (Fig. 5A, middle and bottom). These results strongly suggest that the up-regulation of the ZnT5 mRNA expression by the ER stress would have an intimate involvement in the secretory functions. Then we examined whether or not other stimuli up-regulated the ZnT5 mRNA expression. Because the mRNA expression of immediate-early response factors and heat-shock proteins was down-regulated in the heart of ZnT5–/– mouse in the microarray analysis (24Inoue K. Matsuda K. Itoh M. Kawaguchi H. Tomoike H. Aoyagi T. Nagai R. Hori M. Nakamura Y. Tanaka T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1775-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we investigated the effects of several stimuli that induce immediate-early response factors and heat-shock proteins on the ZnT5 mRNA expression. However, heavy metals (zinc), hypoxia, heat, and cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP failed to up-regulate the expression of ZnT5 mRNA in all tested cell lines (Fig. 5B). Thus, the ZnT5 gene may specifically respond to the ER stress in vertebrate cells. Up-regulation of hZnT5 Transcript by the ER Stress Is Mediated by XBP1 via the TGACGTGG Sequence in the hZnT5 Promoter Region—Last, we examined whether or not the up-regulation of ZnT5 mRNA expression was transcriptionally regulated by UPR signaling. The comparison of 5′- and 3′-flanking sequence among human, mouse, and chicken ZnT5 genes showed that the 110-bp region from the transcription start site was the only region highly homologous among them (>80% or >60% identities between human and mouse or human and chicken, respectively) (Fig. 6A).

To get more insight into the biological functions of the individual HDAC family members, we have used RNA interference in combination with microarray analysis in Drosophila S2 cells. Silencing of Drosophila HDAC1 (DHDAC1), but not of the other DHDAC family members, leads to increased histone acetylation. Silencing of either DHDAC1 or DHDAC3 leads to cell growth inhibition and deregulated transcription of both common and distinct groups of genes. Silencing DHDAC2 leads to increased tubulin acetylation levels but was not associated with a deregulation of gene expression. No growth of phenotype and no significant deregulation of gene expression was observed upon silencing of DHDAC4 and DHDACX. Loss of DHDAC1 or exposure of S2 cells to the small molecule HDAC inhibitor trichostatin both lead to a G2 arrest and were associated with significantly overlapping gene expression signatures in which genes involved in nucleobase and lipid metabolism, DNA replication, cell cycle regulation, and signal transduction were over-represented. A large number of these genes were shown to also be deregulated upon loss of the co-repressor SIN3 (Pile, L. A., Spellman, P. T., Katzenberger, R. J., and Wassarman, D. A. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 37840–37848). We conclude the following. 1) DHDAC1 and -3 have distinct functions in the control of gene expression. 2) Under the tested conditions, DHDAC2, -4, and X have no detectable transcriptional functions in S2 cells. 3) The anti-proliferative and transcriptional effects of trichostatin are largely recapitulated by the loss of DHDAC1. 4) The deacetylase activity of DHDAC1 significantly contributes to the repressor function of SIN3.

Chromatin modifications such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation of histones play an important role in the regulation of transcription (1Jenuwein T.

Together with DNA methylation, these modifications are part of a broad and multifaceted strategy whereby eukaryotes regulate gene expression at the epigenetic level (6Freitag M. Selker E.U. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 7Wolffe A.P. Guschin D. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 102-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 8Strahl B.D.

Pharmacol. 2003; 3: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Histone deacetylation may repress transcription by different mechanisms. On the one hand, this process increases the charge density on the N termini of the core histones thereby strengthening histone tail-DNA interactions and blocking access of the transcriptional machinery to the DNA template. In addition, histone modifications are specifically recognized by chromatin-interacting proteins thus favoring the formation of higher order chromatin structures (heterochromatin).There is ample evidence that aberrations in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression at the levels of DNA methylation and histone acetylation or histone methylation are an important component in the process of malignant transformation of human cells (11Momparler R.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6479-6483Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). A number of histone acetyltransferase mutations were identified in cancer, and HDACs were found to be overexpressed or aberrantly recruited in several human malignancies (12Kouzarides T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Small molecule HDAC inhibitors induce cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis in cancer cells with a significant window over normal cells, and some molecules have already entered clinical trials and show promising results (13Marks P.A. Richon V.M. Miller T. Kelly W.K. Adv. Cancer Res. 2004; 91: 137-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar).Higher organisms have evolved a considerable complexity in the histone deacetylase family; thus, in mammals, 17 different HDAC subtypes were identified, which were grouped into three classes according to their sequence homologies with the yeast proteins Rpd3 (class I), HDA1 (class II), and Sir (class III) (14de Ruijter A.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar, 15Verdin E. Dequiedt F. Kasler H.G.

Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). Class I and class II proteins are evolutionarily related and share a common enzymatic mechanism, the Zn-catalyzed hydrolysis of the acetyl-lysine amide bond. The HDAC inhibitors that are presently in clinical trials are rather nonselective and are thought to inhibit most or many of the class I and II proteins. Class III proteins are evolutionarily unrelated to class I or class II and catalyze the transfer of the acetyl group onto the sugar moiety of NAD (16Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). Profiling of yeast HDAC knock-out strains has shown that the yeast HDACs have very distinct biological functions and are recruited to different regions of the yeast genome (17Bernstein B.E. Tong J.K. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13708-13713Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 18Robyr D. Suka Y. Xenarios I. Kurdistani S.K. Wang A. Suka N. Grunstein M. Cell. 2002; 109: 437-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar).An even greater differentiation of functions seems to have occurred in HDACs of higher eukaryotes through a multitude of mechanisms as follows: the recruitment into different co-repressor complexes (19Yang X.J. Seto E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), the modulation of deacetylase activity by protein-protein interactions (20Guenther M.G. Barak O. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6091-6101Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) or by post-translational modifications (21Lee H. Rezai-Zadeh N. Seto E. Mol. Cell.

Dequiedt F. Kasler H.G. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 286-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). An additional level of complexity is added by the finding that several HDACs, besides their effects on histones, seem to influence gene expression by histone modification independent mechanisms, namely by affecting the acetylation status and the activity of transcription factors (23Greene W.C. Chen L.F. Novartis Found. Symp. 2004; 259: 208-217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Gu W. Luo J. Brooks C.L. Nikolaev A.Y. Li M. Novartis Found.

Symp. 2004; 259: 182-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, extra-transcriptional activities that impinge on processes such as protein folding or modifications of cytoskeleton proteins (26Cohen T. Yao T.P. Sci. STKE. 2004; : PE42PubMed Google Scholar) have been added to the biological curricula of some HDACs.Our focus presently concentrates on the biological functions of class I and class II HDACs, which are the targets of present antineoplastic drug candidates. Among mammalian class I deacetylases (subtypes 1–3 and 8), HDACs 1 and 2 are closely related and found in the ubiquitously expressed mSin3a, NURD/Mi2/NRD, and CoRest corepressor complexes (19Yang X.J. Seto E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). HDAC3 associates to and is activated by SMRT and NCoR co-repressors that play an important role in regulation of gene expression by nuclear hormone receptors (19Yang X.J. Seto E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). HDAC8 was recently found to be expressed in smooth muscle where it is required for muscle contractility (27Waltregny D. Glenisson W. Tran S.L. North B.J. Verdin E. Colige A. Castronovo V. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 966-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The class IIa HDACs (subtypes 4, 5, 7, and 9) are characterized by tissue-specific expression and stimulus-dependent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (15Verdin E. Dequiedt F. Kasler H.G. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 286-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). They are the target of several kinases, and some phosphorylated forms are confined to the cytosol by interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. In the nucleus they associate with transcription factors, notably of the MEF and Runx families, and control differentiation and cellular hypertrophy in muscle and cartilage tissues (28Zhang C.L.

HDAC7 has a specific role in clonal expansion of T-cells by suppressing Nur77-dependent apoptosis (30Dequiedt F. Kasler H. Fischle W. Kiermer V. Weinstein M. Herndier B.G. Verdin E. Immunity. 2003; 18: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Class IIb subtypes 6 and 10 have a duplication of their catalytic domains, but the second catalytic domain is thought to be dysfunctional in HDAC10. HDAC6 is the only deacetylase known to act on tubulin (31Hubbert C. Guardiola A. Shao R. Kawaguchi Y. Ito A. Nixon A. Yoshida M. Wang X.F. Yao T.P. Nature. 2002; 417: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1745) Google Scholar, 32Matsuyama A. Shimazu T. Sumida Y. Saito A. Yoshimatsu Y. Seigneurin-Berny D. Osada H. Komatsu Y. Nishino N. Khochbin S. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6820-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Tubulin deacetylation is required for disposal of misfolded proteins in aggresomes (33Kawaguchi Y. Kovacs J.J. McLaurin A. Vance J.M. Ito A. Yao T.P. Cell. 2003; 115: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). HDAC6 also deacetylates Hsp90, pointing to a broader role of this subtype in protein folding (34Bali P. Pranpat M. Bradner J. Balasis M. Fiskus W. Guo F. Rocha K. Kumaraswamy S. Boyapalle S. Atadja P. Seto E. Bhalla K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26729-26734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Finally, very little is known about HDAC11 that cannot be clearly assigned to either class I or class II HDACs based on sequence motifs (35Gao L. Cueto M.A. Asselbergs F. Atadja P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25748-25755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar).We were interested to gain more insight into the division of labor among HDACs in higher eukaryotes. In particular, we wanted to identify functional clusters of genes regulated by individual subtypes. We would furthermore like to correlate those gene clusters with the antiproliferative activity of nonselective small molecule inhibitors as a strategy to identify the subtypes that mediate the antiproliferation effect. To this purpose, we have used Drosophila S2 cells as a model system. This system is attractive because insects have only five class I/II HDACs with orthologs to mammalian HDACs 1 and 2 (DHDAC1 = CG7471), 3 (DHDAC3 = CG2128), 4, 5, 7, and 9 (DHDAC4 = CG1770), 6 (DHDAC2 = CG6170), and 11 (DHDACX = CG31119) (for further details see the Supplemental Material). By using RNAi in combination with microarray analysis, we show that only DHDAC1 and DHDAC3 detectably affect transcription in S2 cells pointing to either very specialized or nontranscriptional roles of the other subtypes. Furthermore, a substantial phenotypic and transcriptional overlap between DHDAC1 RNAi and the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) points to this subtype as an important mediator of the antiproliferative effects of TSA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells—Drosophila Schneider cell lines (S2), obtained from Patrizia Somma (University of Rome “La Sapienza”), were cultured at 25 °C in Shield and Sang M3 Insect Medium (Sigma) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (Sigma).RNA Interference—To generate double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) for RNAi, sequences directed against the protein to be silenced were amplified by RT-PCR from S2 total RNA. Each primer used in the PCR contained a 5′ T7 RNA polymerase-binding site (GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGG) followed by sequences specific for the targeted genes.The following primer sets (oriented 5′ → 3′) were used for each protein (T7 promoter sequence is underlined): DHDAC1 for GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGATCCGTAGCTGCGGC and rev GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGATGCCTTGTTGCTGT; DHDAC2 for GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGTCCCAAGGTGCTCTACATCAGCTT and rev GATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGGCCATCCTCGCGCCACGCAC); DHDAC3 for GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGGAGCCCAGAAGCTGAAC and rev GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGGGGTCTGCACCATTTGGACGCTGG); DHDAC4 for GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCCCACGCACATCCACATCCACATG and rev GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGTGACCTTGTGCGGCGGTGAA); DHDACX for GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGGCCCAACTGCAGCTCGACGACGGC and rev GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGGCGCAGCTCCACCGCACACCGAATGC); and new DHDACX for GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGGTTGCTCGTACAGAGGCGGT and rev GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGGCCACCACTCAGCAGCATCAC). dsRNA molecules directed against DHDAC1, DHDAC2, and DHDAC4 were 1000 bp in length, and the sequence against DHDAC3 was 861 bp. Two different sequences against DHDACX of 500 bp each were also synthesized. PCR products were used as templates for in vitro transcription using the Megascript RNAi kit (Ambion). 500 μg of PCR product was first purified and concentrated using Amicon microcon-PCR filters (Millipore) and then used as template for 2–4-h in vitro transcription reaction. Nuclease digestion to remove DNA and single-stranded RNA was carried out in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, the dsRNA was purified on columns provided by the kit. RNAi was carried out according to the protocol developed by Clemens et al. (36Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T. Hemmings B.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). 3 × 106 S2 Drosophila tissue culture cells were plated into a 100-mm dish in 6 ml of medium without fetal bovine serum. Approximately 90 μg of dsRNA was added and mixed by swirling. After 30 min, 12 ml of media containing 20% fetal bovine serum was added. The cells were kept in culture and analyzed for up to 5 days.TaqMan RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from S2 cells the 3rd and the 5th day following addition of dsRNA by using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Total RNA was DNase I-treated (Qiagen), quantified spectrophotometrically, and subjected to one-step real time RT-PCR (Taqman One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix, Applied Biosystems) on an ABI Prism 7700 machine (Applied Biosystems). The thermal cycling conditions used were as follows: RT for 30 min at 48 °C and 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of amplification at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Normalization for RNA levels was based on glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and α-tubulin expression. For amplification of each gene the following primers and probe sets were used: DHDAC1, sense 5′-TGCGCCAAAGTGCCAAA-3′, antisense 5′-GGATGAACTTGCGAGCTCAGA-3′, and FAM probe 5′-TCGGACCGGCACCAAAGTAAACCA-3′; DHDAC2, sense 5′-CCAACGGCACTGATCTACGA-3′, antisense 5′-TGAAGCGCTCGGGACACT-3′, and FAM probe 5′-CCAGCACTGTTGCCTGTGGGACAA-3′; DHDAC3, sense 5′-CGGACCGTAGGGTGTCGTACT-3′, antisense 5′-CATCAACCAGCTTGTCCTCATC-3′, and FAM probe 5′-CTACAACGCGGACGTGGGCAACTT-3′; DHDAC4, sense 5′-GAATGGCACAACGACAACGT-3′, antisense 5′-TCGCCCGAGGAGCTCTT-3′, and FAM probe 5′-CCCTACAGGAATCGCGGCGT-3′; DHDACX, sense 5′-CGACCCATGCGCTTTCA-3′, antisense 5′-AACCATAATCCAATGCCAGCTT-3′, and FAM probe 5′-CAGCCGGTTCCATTTTGGCCG-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, sense 5′-CGACCCATGCGCTTTCA-3′, antisense 5′-AACCATAATCCAATGCCAGCTT-3′, and FAM probe 5′-CAGCCGGTTCCATTTTGGCCG-3′; and α-tubulin, sense 5′-CCCCGTCACGGCAAGTAC-3′, antisense 5′-ACGTCCTTGGGCACAACATC-3′, and FAM probe 5′-TGGCCTGCTGCATGCTGTACCG-3′.Cell Growth Assay—To determine the growth curves cells were resuspended by gentle mixing and counted each day following the addition of dsRNA for a total of 5 days. Trypan blue staining was used to assess cell viability.FACS Analysis—To prepare cells for FACS analysis, 5 × 105 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 μl of propidium iodide (1 mg/ml), and 10 μl of RNase A (10 mg/ml). Stained cells were analyzed with a FACScan apparatus (BD Biosciences), and the data were quantified using Cellquest software.Immunoblotting Analysis—Whole-cell SDS lysates were resolved by electrophoresis on 4–12% SDS-PAGE pre-cast gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell). Filters were blocked in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) with 5% nonfat dried milk for 1 h at room temperature. Filters were washed once in TBST and then incubated with primary antibodies diluted 1–5 μg/ml in 5% nonfat dried milk in TBST overnight at 4 °C. Filters were washed five times in TBST and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:5000 in 5% nonfat dried milk-TBST for 1 h at room temperature. Filters were washed five times in TBST as for primary antibody incubations and processed for chemiluminescent detection using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-DHDAC1 serum (diluted 1:1000) was a gift from Alexander Brehm (Adolf-Butenandt-Institut Molekularbiologie LMU München), and a polyclonal anti-dHDAC4 serum was made by immunizing rabbits with the peptide MSSPDDRIPIHDLPSEAGGC-OH (Anaspec, San Josè, CA). The following antibodies were commercially available: monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (clone DM 1A; Sigma), monoclonal anti-acetylated-tubulin (clone 6-11B-1; Sigma), monoclonal anti-actin (clone C4; NeoMarkers), polyclonal anti-acetylhistone H3 (06-599; Upstate), polyclonal anti-mouse peroxidase conjugate (31444; Pierce) and polyclonal anti-rabbit peroxidase conjugate (A6154; Sigma).Analysis of mRNA Expression Using Oligonucleotide Arrays—Microarray analysis was performed with GeneChip Drosophila arrays (Affymetrix) using as probes cRNAs prepared from samples 3 and 5 days after addition of dsRNA or after exposure to TSA (6, 12, and 24 h and 3 and 5 days post-treatment). We hybridized two replicate samples on distinct chips for each condition. Every experiment was repeated at least two times and processed separately. cRNA was prepared and labeled following protocols listed the GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual (available online). Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 16 to 24 μg of RNA and was used as a template to synthesize biotin-labeled cRNA by in vitro transcription using the BioArray High Yield RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo). Amplified cRNA was fragmented and hybridized to arrays according to the manufacturer's procedures. Probe hybridization and data collection were performed by the Genopolis Consortium at the University of Milano, Bicocca.Annotation and Statistical Analysis of Microarray Expression Data—Data were analyzed using Rosetta Resolver 5.0 (Rosetta Biosoftware) in combination with MatLab 7.0. Raw data resulting from the scans of Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays monitoring 13,500 Drosophila transcripts, according to sequences from version 1.0 of Flybase, were preprocessed (image processing and normalization) using the Rosetta Biosoftware proprietary algorithm (refer to the Rosetta Biosoftware instruction manual for technical details). A “Rosetta p value” (see manual) was calculated for each gene probe set. For series-specific ratio experiments, single channel intensity replicates within the same series were combined and compared against the combination of control experiments at the same time point. The resulting series-specific ratio experiment replicates were combined into “global ratio experiments.” Global ratio experiments were then used for the selection of genes differentially expressed. Error weighted average using error values associated to each data point was used to combine the replicates. Hierarchical clustering using cosine correlation as a similarity measure was used to cluster genes and samples. The unweighted average link was used to calculate the distance from a cluster to all remaining unclustered points. Genes to be clustered were pre-selected using the following criteria: a log ratio associated p value <0.01 and absolute log ratio >0.3 (2-fold change) in at least two experiments. The following criteria were used for the selection of differentially expressed genes: up-regulated genes, log ratio p value <0.01 and fold change >2; down-regulated genes, log ratio p value <0.01 and fold change less than –2. Gene ontology annotations and classification were performed on the selected genes using the NetAffx™ web-based software. p values relative to the overlap between gene sets and to the analysis of gene ontology annotations were calculated using the Fisher exact test. No correction for the number of categories was made because the same genes may fall under different GO annotations. Microarray data were deposited in the GEO data base.RESULTSTo selectively knockdown DHDACs function in S2 Drosophila cells, we took advantage of RNA interference using dsRNA molecules with an approximate length of 500–1000 bp, derived from the coding region of each DHDAC. Quantitative real time PCR analysis was done to assess the kinetics of mRNA knockdown. DHDAC mRNA levels displayed a sharp reduction up to 2–3 days, depending on the subtype, and only slightly declined thereafter for up to 5 days following addition of dsRNA (Fig. 1A). At 5 days, silencing of DHDAC1, DHDAC3, and DHDACX was very efficient, and mRNA levels decreased to 10% or less with respect to untreated or unspecific dsRNA-treated cells. For the remaining subtypes, lower efficiency was observed, and upon RNAi, DHDAC2 and DHDAC4 transcripts decreased only to 40 and 20% the level of control samples, respectively. The knockdown efficiency was not significantly improved by increasing the amount of dsRNA, by repeated addition of the same dsRNA, by changing the dsRNA sequence, or by transfection with small, 21-nucleotide short interfering RNAs (not shown). To assess the selectivity of DHDAC silencing, we performed RT-PCR TaqMan analysis on transfected cells 2, 3, and 5 days following addition of dsRNA. No unintended alterations were noticed at day 2 (not shown), whereas at longer incubation times, a mutual influence was observed only between DHDAC1 and -3 (Fig. 1B). Knockdown of either of these DHDACs leads to a decrease in the mRNA levels of the other subtype. This phenomenon might be related to the high degree of sequence homology between DHDAC1 and -3 and a resulting off-target silencing by the RNAi machinery. Still, the specific silencing was 10- to 5-fold more efficient at any time point. To investigate whether the depletion of mRNA correlated with a reduction in the protein level, we analyzed whole-cell extracts from transfected cells with antiserum directed against DHDAC1 or DHDAC4. Immunoblotting analysis showed that dsRNA treatment resulted in both proteins being significantly down-regulated after 5 days (Fig. 2). Unfortunately, we failed to obtain reliable antisera against the other DHDAC subtypes.FIGURE 2Protein expression levels of DHDAC1 and -4 upon RNAi. Proteins were extracted from S2 cells 5 days after triggering RNAi by addition of specific dsRNAs directed against DHDAC1 or DHDAC4. DHDAC protein levels were detected by Western blot analysis using antisera directed against DHDAC1 or DHDAC4. Extra bands are because of nonspecific reactivity of the polyclonal antisera. NT indicates nontransfected.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effects on Histone and Tubulin Acetylation—RNAi of either DHDAC1 but not of the other DHDACs leads to increased histone H3 acetylation (Fig. 3). TSA-treated cells also showed a significant increase in acetylated histone H3 (Fig. 3). In contrast, only DHDAC2 RNAi gave an increase in acetylated tubulin. This increase is in agreement with the known function of the mammalian ortholog of DHDAC2 (HDAC6), which is the only reported tubulin deacetylase. These data suggest that even the lower knockdown efficiency obtained with DHDAC2 RNAi was sufficient to elicit biologic effects.FIGURE 3Histone and tubulin acetylation changes upon loss of DHDACs or TSA treatment. S2 cell extracts were made 5 days after addition of dsRNAs directed against each DHDAC or of 75 nm TSA.

We observed a dose-dependent inhibition of thymidine incorporation with an IC50 of 75 nm (not shown). We next compared the effect of 75 nm TSA on growth curves to that elicited by DHDAC RNAi in a time course exp"
https://openalex.org/W2048326719,"The acquired capabilities of resistance to apoptotic cell death and tissue invasion are considered to be obligate steps in tumor progression. The binding of the serine protease urokinase (uPA) to its receptor (uPAR) plays a central role in the molecular events coordinating tumor cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. Here we investigate whether uPAR signaling may also prevent apoptosis following loss of anchorage (anoikis) or DNA damage. If nontransformed human retinal pigment epithelial cells are pre-exposed to uPA or to its noncatalytic amino-terminal region (residues 1–135), they exhibit a markedly reduced susceptibility to anoikis as well as to UV-induced apoptosis. This anti-apoptotic effect is retained by a uPA-derived synthetic peptide corresponding to the receptor binding domain and is inhibited by anti-uPAR polyclonal antibodies. Furthermore, the stable reduction of uPA or uPAR expression by RNA interference leads to an increased susceptibility to UV-, cisplatin-, and detachment-induced apoptosis. In particular, the level of uPAR expression positively correlates with cell resistance to anoikis. The protective ability of uPA is prevented by UO126, LY294002, by an MAPK targeting small interference RNA, and by a dominant negative Akt variant. Accordingly, incubation of retinal pigment epithelial cells with uPA elicits a time-dependent enhancement of MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activities as well as the transcriptional activation of Bcl-xL anti-apoptotic factor. Vice versa, the silencing of Bcl-xL expression prevents uPA protection from anoikis. In conclusion, the data show that ligand engagement of uPAR promotes cell survival by activating Bcl-xL transcription through the MEK/ERK- and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt-dependent pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1965035726,"The Na+,K+-ATPase plays key roles in brain function. Recently, missense mutations in the Na+,K+-ATPase were found associated with familial rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism (FRDP). Here, we have characterized the functional consequences of FRDP mutations Phe785Leu and Thr618Met. Both mutations lead to functionally altered, but active, Na+,K+-pumps, that display reduced apparent affinity for cytoplasmic Na+, but the underlying mechanism differs between the mutants. In Phe785Leu, the interaction of the E1 form with Na+ is defective, and the E1-E2 equilibrium is not displaced. In Thr618Met, the Na+ affinity is reduced because of displacement of the conformational equilibrium in favor of the K+-occluded E2(K2) form. In both mutants, K+ interaction at the external activating sites of the E2P phosphoenzyme is normal. The change of cellular Na+ homeostasis is likely a major factor contributing to the development of FRDP in patients carrying the Phe785Leu or Thr618Met mutation. Phe785Leu moreover interferes with Na+ interaction on the extracellular side and reduces the affinity for ouabain significantly. Analysis of two additional Phe785 mutants, Phe785Leu/Leu786Phe and Phe785Tyr, demonstrated that the aromatic function of the side chain, as well as its exact position, is critical for Na+ and ouabain binding. The effects of substituting Phe785 could be explained by structural modeling, demonstrating that Phe785 participates in a hydrophobic network between three transmembrane segments. Thr618 is located in the cytoplasmic part of the molecule near the catalytic site, and the structural modeling indicates that the Thr618Met mutation interferes with the bonding pattern in the catalytic site in the E1 form, thereby destabilizing E1 relative to E2(K2)."
https://openalex.org/W1997788934,"The structures of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core and O antigen of Bordetella bronchiseptica and Bordetella parapertussis are known, but how these two regions are linked to each other had not been determined. We have studied LPS from several strains of these microorganisms to determine the complete carbohydrate structure of the LPS. LPS was analyzed using different chemical degradations, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. This identified a novel pentasaccharide fragment that links the O chain to the core in all the LPS studied. In addition, although the O chain of these bacteria was reported as a homopolymer of 1,4-linked 2,3-diacetamido-2,3-dideoxy-alpha-galacturonic acid, we discovered that the polymer contains several amidated uronic acids, the number of which varies between strains. These new data describe the complete structure of the LPS carbohydrate backbone for both Bordetella species and help to explain the complex genetics of LPS biosynthesis in these bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2013283818,"We have shown previously that caspases were specifically involved in the differentiation of peripheral blood monocytes into macrophages while not required for monocyte differentiation into dendritic cells. To identify caspase targets in monocytes undergoing macrophagic differentiation, we used the human monocytic leukemic cell line U937, whose macrophagic differentiation induced by exposure to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) can be prevented by expression of the baculovirus caspase-inhibitory protein p35. A comparative two-dimensional gel proteomic analysis of empty vector- and p35-transfected cells after 12 h of exposure to 20 nm TPA, followed by mass spectrometry analysis, identified 38 differentially expressed proteins. Those overexpressed in p35-expressing cells (n = 16) were all full-length, whereas half of those overexpressed in control cells (n = 22) were N- or C-terminal cleavage fragments. The cleavage or degradation of seven of these proteins was confirmed in peripheral blood monocytes undergoing macrophage colony-stimulating factor-induced macrophagic differentiation. In U937 cells exposed to TPA, these proteolytic events can be inhibited by expression of a caspase-8 dominant negative mutant or the cowpox virus CrmA caspase inhibitor.

When crossing the endothelium, peripheral blood monocytes can differentiate into scavenging macrophages or antigen-presenting myeloid dendritic cells. Cytokine conditions that regulate the balance between these two options have been identified. For example, in vitro, monocytes differentiate into macrophages in response to macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) 4The abbreviations used are: M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorptionionization; TOF, time-of-flight; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; PAI-2, plasminogen activator inhibitor-2; IL-4, interleukin-4; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate; RT, reverse transcription; Ab, antibody; FAM, carboxyfluorescein; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. 4The abbreviations used are: M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorptionionization; TOF, time-of-flight; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; PAI-2, plasminogen activator inhibitor-2; IL-4, interleukin-4; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate; RT, reverse transcription; Ab, antibody; FAM, carboxyfluorescein; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.

A. 1996; 93: 2588-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). Transcriptional events controlling the commitment of monocytes into macrophages versus dendritic cells are less known. It was recently proposed that dendritic cell differentiation could be instructed by high levels of the myeloid and lymphoid-specific Ets family transcription factor PU.1 together with the down-regulation of the monocyte/macrophage-specific bZip factor MafB (5Bakri Y.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1987-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that in vitro differentiation of monocytes into macrophages was associated with an activation of cellular proteases known as caspases, which was not observed in monocytes undergoing dendritic cell differentiation. We have shown also that caspase activation was required for macrophagic differentiation of U937 human leukemic cells under phorbol ester exposure (7Sordet O. Rebe C. Plenchette S. Zermati Y. Hermine O. Vainchenker W. Garrido C. Solary E. Dubrez-Daloz L. Blood. 2002; 100: 4446-4453Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These results suggested that caspase activation could be one of the events that specifically promote macrophagic differentiation of peripheral blood monocytes. Accordingly, in mice, conditional deletion of the caspase-8 gene in the myelomonocytic precursors blocked the formation of macrophages without affecting the number of dendritic cells and granulocytes (8Kang T.B.

Caspases are aspartate-specific cysteine proteases that were identified as key players in cell death by apoptosis (9Green D.R. Cell. 2005; 121: 671-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). These enzymes also contribute to processes that do not culminate in cell demise, such as cytokine maturation, T-cell activation, cell motility and migration, and cell differentiation (10Launay S. Hermine O. Fontenay M. Kroemer G. Solary E. Garrido C. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5137-5148Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The involvement of caspases in cell differentiation was initially suspected in those whose maturation was associated with enucleation such as keratinocytes (11Okuyama R. Nguyen B.C. Talora C.

Hay B.A. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E15Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Approximately 280 cellular substrates for mammalian caspases have been identified (20Fischer U. Janicke R.U. Schulze-Osthoff K. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 76-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the caspase-3-induced cleavage and activation of the serine/threonine kinase MST1 (mammalian sterile twenty-like kinase) was required for the differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes (15Fernando P. Kelly J.F. Balazsi K. Slack R.S. Megeney L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11025-11030Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). In other cell types in which differentiation is associated with caspase activation, the cellular targets of these enzymes and how their cleavage contributes to the differentiation process remain poorly known. This caspase-mediated cleavage of cellular proteins must be selective to avoid the cell dismantling (e.g. the transcription factor GATA-1 is cleaved by caspases in erythroblasts undergoing apoptosis under erythropoietin deprivation, whereas this protein remains uncleaved in these cells when caspases are activated along the differentiation process) (13Zermati Y.

To better understand the role of caspases in the differentiation of specific cell types, identification of their cellular targets in each cell type is an absolute requirement. One of the approaches used to identify natural macromolecular substrates of cellular proteases and their products combines two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of cell lysates with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (21Adrain C.

In the present study, this approach was used to identify caspase targets in monocytes undergoing macrophagic differentiation by using the baculoviral, broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, p35 protein (24Bump N.J.

Cirilli M. Huang Y. Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. Wu H. Nature. 2001; 410: 494-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We compared the proteome of U937 cells stably transfected with an empty vector and a vector expressing the p35 gene after a 12-h exposure to phorbol esters. We identified several potential targets for caspases activated in cells undergoing macrophagic differentiation, the cleavage of seven of them being shown to be specifically associated with macrophagic differentiation of monocytes. Antibodies and Chemicals—We used mouse monoclonal antibodies that recognize human HSC70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), β-actin (clone AC-15), α-tubulin (clone B-5-1-2), vinculin (clone VIN-11-5) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) C1/C2 (clone 4F4) (Sigma), moesin (BD Biosciences), plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2) (American Diagnostica Inc., Stamford, CT), CD11b (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated; Immunotech, Marseille, France), and CD1a and CD71 (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated; BD Biosciences). We also used rabbit polyclonal antibodies that include anti-human HSP90-β (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO), NPM (nucleophosmin) (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), hnRNP H (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc., Montgomery, TX), and FLAG and α-PAK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). M-CSF, GM-CSF, and IL-4 were obtained from R&D systems; 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and Etoposide (VP16) were from Sigma. Cell Culture and Differentiation—The human leukemic U937 cell line, obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), was stably transfected with pTarget or pTarget containing p35 cDNA in combination with a FLAG sequence as described previously (7Sordet O.

Grant, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, VA). These cells were grown in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium containing fetal calf serum (10%, v/v) in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C, and transfected cell populations were selected in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418. Transfection was monitored by RT-PCR. Briefly, RNA extraction was performed with the Nucleospin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel, Hoerd, France), and the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions and the following specific primers for the p35 gene (forward, ATGGATTATAAAGATGATGATGATAAATGTGTAATTTTT; reverse, TTATTTAATTGTGTTTAATATTACATTTTTGTTGAGTGC) with the β2-microglobulin gene as a control (forward, ACCCCCACTGAAAAAGATGA; reverse, ATCTTCAAACCTCCATGATG). The p35 protein was detected by immunoblotting of cell lysates using an anti-FLAG antibody. To promote their differentiation, cells were suspended at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml in fresh medium for 24 h to ensure their exponential growth and then treated with 20 nm TPA for up to 48 h. Differentiation was monitored by following cell adhesion and plasma membrane expression of the glycoprotein CD11b by flow cytometry analysis. To promote their apoptosis, cells were treated with 50 μm VP16 for up 4 h. Apoptosis was monitored by following the percentage of cells with chromatin condensation. Human peripheral blood monocytes were obtained from healthy donors with informed consent and purified using a monocyte isolation kit with a light-scattering column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, Paris, France) and then incubated (2.5 × 105/ml) for up to 6 days in RPMI medium, 10% fetal calf serum, in the presence of either 100 ng/ml M-CSF to trigger their differentiation into macrophages or a combination of GM-CSF (100 ng/ml) and IL-4 (10 ng/ml) and β-mercaptoethanol (50 μm) for inducing their dendritic differentiation. The differentiated phenotype was identified by flow cytometry analysis of CD71 and CD1a at the cell surface. FAM-VAD-fmk, the fluorochrome inhibitor of caspases, a carboxyfluorescein analog of benzyloxycarbonyl-tetrapeptide-fluoromethylketone that becomes fluorescent upon cleavage by caspases, was used to measure caspase activity by flow cytometry (Serotech, France). siRNA Transfection—Human primary monocytes were transfected using the Human Monocyte Nucleofector Kit (Amaxa, Köln, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 5 × 106 monocytes were resuspended into 100 μl of nucleofector solution with 2 μg of either caspase-8 siRNA (forward, AGGGAACUUCAGACACCAGtt; reverse, CUGGUGUCUGAAGUUCCCUtt) (Ambion, Austin, TX) or luciferase siRNA (Qiagen) (forward, CUUACGCUGAGUACUUCGAtt; reverse, UCGAAGUACUCAGCGUAAGtt) before nucleofection with nucleofactor I. Cells were then immediately removed and incubated overnight with 1 ml of prewarmed monocyte nucleofactor medium containing 2 mm glutamine and 10% of fetal bovine serum. Cells were then resuspended into complete RPMI medium and treated with appropriate cytokines to induce their differentiation into macrophages or dendritic cells. High Resolution Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Cells (5 × 107) were treated with 20 nm TPA for 12 h and then suspended in 25 μl of isotonic sucrose buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5) before being stored at –80 °C. They were lysed in lysis buffer (0.3% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm NaF, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 40 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with protease inhibitors, 5 μg/ml DNase, and 1 μg/ml RNase for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell debris and the remaining intact cells were removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 20,000 × g and 4 °C. Total proteins were precipitated with ice-cold acetone and in a solution containing 8 m urea, 2.5 m thiourea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% (v/v) ampholines at pH 4–7 (Amersham Biosciences) before being cleared on 0.2-μm filters. This solution (800 μg of proteins in 450 μl) was loaded onto a dehydrated immobilized pH gradient strip (24 cm, pH 4–7 linear; Amersham Biosciences), hydrated for 12 h at 30 V under mineral oil before isoelectric focusing of the first dimension by progressive increase of voltage up to 66,000 V-h at 20 °C in an IPGPhor (Amersham Biosciences). Then strips were equilibrated with 60 mm dithiothreitol in equilibration buffer (6 m urea, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 4% (w/v) SDS) for 15 min to reduce proteins that were subsequently carbamidomethylated for 15 min with 135 mm iodoacetamide in equilibration buffer. Then proteins were separated according to their molecular mass using 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gels at 35 °C in an Ettan Dalt II system (Amersham Biosciences). Then the gels were washed three times in deionized water for 5 min; fixed in 10% (v/v) formalin, 20% (v/v) ethanol for 1 h; washed again; soaked in 0.05% (w/v) 2,7-naphtalenedisulfonic acid solution overnight; washed six times for 20 min; and incubated in ammoniacal, silver nitrate solution for 1 h. After three washes, gels were incubated in 0.01% (w/v) citric acid and 0.1% (v/v) formaldehyde for 3–5 min before adding a stop solution containing 2% (v/v) acetic acid and 0.5% (v/v) ethanolamine. Three analytical gels were run for each sample. These gels were scanned (ImageScanner; Amersham Biosciences), and spots were characterized using the Melanie 4.03 software (GeneBio, Geneva, Switzeland) that permits measurement of the relative volume (percentage of volume) of each spot. Experimental variations were neutralized by reporting the volume of each spot relative to the volume of all spots in the gel, and gel-matching algorithms were used for comparison. Heuristic clustering and factorial analysis were used to assess the reproducibility of the method. A more than 2-fold change in a spot volume between control- and p35-transfected U937 cells was considered for further analysis. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—High resolution two-dimensional gels performed with initial loading of 1.6 mg of proteins were used for mass spectrometry analysis. Staining was performed either with silver nitrate as above, except for fixation in 30% ethanol and 5% acetic acid as described (27Rabilloud T. Two-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and Identification Methods. 1997; (Springer, Berlin, Germany)Google Scholar). Alternatively, gels were fixed in a solution containing 30% ethanol and 2% phosphoric acid before three washes in 2% phosphoric acid for 20 min and stained with a colloidal Coomassie solution (10% (v/v) phosphoric acid, 10% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, 0.12% (w/v) Brillant Blue G, and 20% (v/v) methanol) as described (28Candiano G. Bruschi M. Musante L. Santucci L. Ghiggeri G.M. Carnemolla B. Orecchia P. Zardi L. Righetti P.G. Electrophoresis. 2004; 25: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). Selected spots were excised and incubated either in 30 mm potassium ferricyanide and 100 mm sodium thiosulfate for 15 min (silver nitrate staining) or in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate at pH 8 for 10 min (Coomassie staining). After three washes in 50% acetonitrile, 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, the gel pieces were soaked in 100% acetonitrile for 5 min and dried. The proteins were reduced in 100 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 1 h at 56°C and then alkylated in 55 mm iodoacetamide, 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 45 min in darkness, washed, and dried again. The proteins were rehydrated with trypsin (Roche Applied Science) (12.5 μg/ml in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted twice with 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate and twice with 50% acetonitrile, 1% trifluoroacetic acid at room temperature and dried. For mass spectrometric analysis, peptides were solubilized by sonication in 10 μl of formic acid (2%), concentrated on a C18 Zip-Tip column (Millipore Corp., Billeria, MA), and eluted with 5 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. One μl of each peptide sample was dried on a Teflon-coated MALDI target plate (Applied Biosciences) before adding 1 μl of matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid). Peptide mass fingerprinting was performed on a reflectron MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosciences) with internal calibration using trypsin autolysis peaks, and protein identification was performed by using the MS-FIT software and SWISS-PROT or NCBI protein databases (available on the World Wide Web at prospector.ucsf.edu/). Immunoblot Analysis—Whole-cell lysates were prepared by lysing the cells in boiling buffer (1% SDS, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4) in the presence of protease inhibitors. Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Ivry sur Seine, France). Fifty micrograms of proteins were incubated in loading buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 4.6% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.003% bromphenol blue), separated by SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). After blocking nonspecific binding sites overnight by 5% nonfat milk in TBS-Tween (0.05 m Tris base, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.6, Tween 20 (0.1%)), the membrane was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the primary antibody. After two washes in TBS-Tween, membrane was incubated with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 30 min at room temperature and then washed twice in TBS-Tween. The immunoblot was revealed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) and autoradiography. p35-mediated Caspase Inhibition Prevents TPA-induced U937 Cell Differentiation—We transfected U937 cells with either the empty pTarget vector (U937/Co) or the pTarget vector including the sequence encoding the baculovirus p35 protein tagged with an N-terminal FLAG (U937/p35). A stably transfected population was selected by culture for 4 weeks in the presence of G418 (1 mg/ml). The expression of the p35 gene in the transfected cells was analyzed by RT-PCR, and the protein was detected by immunoblotting using an anti-FLAG antibody to demonstrate the efficacy of the transfection (Fig. 1A). As described previously (29Rovera G. Santoli D. Damsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2779-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar), exposure of U937/Co cells to 20 nm TPA induced their progressive differentiation into macrophages, as assessed by cell adhesion to the plastic of culture flasks (Fig. 1B) and an increase in the expression of CD11b at the cell surface (Fig. 1C) (7Sordet O. Rebe C. Plenchette S. Zermati Y. Hermine O. Vainchenker W. Garrido C. Solary E. Dubrez-Daloz L. Blood. 2002; 100: 4446-4453Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Using FAM-VAD-fmk as a permeant substrate, the TPA-induced differentiation of U937/Co cells was observed to be associated with a transient activation of caspases whose maximal activity was observed 12 h after the beginning of TPA exposure (Fig. 1D). Caspase activation was further confirmed by the time-dependent appearance of caspase-3 and -8 cleavage fragments, whose size was similar to that observed in U937 cells undergoing apoptosis upon VP16 exposure (Fig. 1E). In this positive control, about 60% of cells demonstrated an apoptotic phenotype 4 h after exposure to 100 μm VP16 (not shown). Caspase activation occurred in the absence of any apoptotic feature (e.g. nuclear chromatin condensation and phosphatidylserine externalization were not observed (not shown), and the well characterized caspase target poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase, which was cleaved in U937 cells undergoing VP16-induced apoptosis, remained uncleaved in U937 cells undergoing differentiation (Fig. 1E). The expression of p35 in U937 cells prevented TPA-induced cell adhesion (Fig. 1B), CD11b expression increase (Fig. 1C), and caspase activation (Fig. 1, D and E), indicating, in accordance with previous studies, that caspase inhibition could prevent macrophage differentiation (7Sordet O.

Immunol. 2004; 173: 2976-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). p35-mediated Caspase Inhibition Modifies the Proteome of TPA-treated U937 Cells—To identify caspase substrates in U937 cells undergoing TPA-induced differentiation, we used high resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis within the range of pI 4–7 and 20–200 kDa and compared the proteomic profiles of lysates obtained from U937/Co and U937/p35 cells 12 h after the beginning of TPA exposure (Fig. 2A). After silver staining, ∼3000 spots were resolved in each gel. We analyzed four two-dimensional gels obtained from U937/Co cells and three obtained from U937/p35 cells after 12 h of TPA exposure. After normalization of spot volumes, the percentage of similarities was 72% between U937/Co gels (n = 4), 73% between U937/p35 cells (n = 3), and 65% between U937/Co and U937/p35 gels. Two different methods of clustering, namely heuristic clustering (Fig. 2B) and factorial analysis (not shown), both indicated a good separation between U937/Co and U937/p35 gels, suggesting that the differences between gel profiles were a consequence of caspase inhibition rather than variations in experimental conditions. Using a more than 2-fold change in the mean spot volume between U937/Co and U937/p35 cells as a cut-off value (e.g. see Fig. 2C), we identified differences in 90 spots, including 54 whose volume was more than 2-fold higher in U937/Co compared with U937/p35 cell lysates and 36 spots whose volume was more than 2-fold higher in U937/p35 compared with U937/Co cell lysates. The 90 spots that exhibited high reproducibility and more than 2-fold changes in abundance between the two studied conditions were excised from two-dimensional gels, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by mass spectrometry, which allowed identification of the corresponding proteins in 47 cases. Other spots could not be identified, either because they were insufficiently abundant or because the mass spectrometry results could not be matched to a peptide sequence in the data base. Since some spots were generated by distinct forms of the same protein, we eventually identified 39 distinct proteins that were differentially expressed in U937/Co and U937/p35 cells after 12 h of TPA treatment. Interestingly, the proteins overexpressed in p35-expressing cells (n = 16) were all full-length (i.e. their apparent molecular weight was similar to the predicted molecular weight, and the peptide coverage in mass spectrometry indicated isolation of the complete molecule), whereas about half of those overexpressed in control cells (11 of 23) were N- or C-terminal fragments (i.e. their apparent molecular weight was lower than predicted molecular weight, and peptide coverage in mass spectrometry was limited to one molecule extremity) (Table 1 and 2). Peptides identified by mass fingerprint never overlapped a characterized cleavage site by caspases (data not shown), and the size of the fragments identified by analyzing the two-dimensional gel electrophoreses was similar or complementary to that reported for fragments generated by caspase-mediated cleavage (Table 3).TABLE 1Proteins overexpressed in U937/p35 cells after 12 h of TPA exposureSpot numberProtein nameAccession numberPredictedObservedVolume ratioMS analysisKnown target of caspasesMrpIMrpIP23*Actin βP0257041,0005.345,00060.23FYesP16Activator of 90-kDa heat shock protein ATPase homolog 1 (Aha1)O9543338,0005.442,0005.50.33FNoP24D3 phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (3-PGDH)O4317556,0006.364,0006.80"

In the present study, we exposed isolated rat lungs to pO2 = 40 mm Hg for 60 min or rats to 8% O2 for up to 24 h and then measured changes in alveolar fluid reabsorption (AFR) and Na,K-ATPase function. Low levels of oxygen severely impaired AFR in both ex vivo and in vivo models. The decrease in AFR was associated with a decrease in Na,K-ATPase activity and protein abundance in the basolateral membranes from peripheral lung tissue of hypoxic rats. β-Adrenergic agonists restored AFR in rats exposed to 8% O2 (from 0.02 ± 0.07 ml/h to 0.59 ± 0.03 ml/h), which was associated with parallel increases in Na,K-ATPase protein abundance in the basolateral membrane. Hypoxia is associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, we examined whether overexpression of SOD2, manganese superoxide dismutase, would prevent the hypoxia-mediated decrease in AFR. Spontaneously breathing rats were infected with a replication-deficient human type 5 adenovirus containing cDNA for SOD2. An otherwise identical virus that contained no cDNA was used as a control (Adnull). Hypoxic Adnull rats had decreased rates of AFR (0.12 ± 0.1 ml/h) as compared with hypoxic AdSOD2 and normoxic control rats (0.47 ± 0.04 ml/h and 0.49 ± 0.02 ml/h, respectively), with parallel changes in Na,K-ATPase.

Severe hypoxia can occur during ascent to high altitude (1.Sartori C. Allemann Y. Duplain H. Lepori M. Egli M. Lipp E. Hutter D. Turini P. Hugli O. Cook S. Nicod P. Scherrer U. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 1631-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary edema. One of the primary defense mechanisms in the lung against alveolar fluid accumulation is the active transport of sodium out of the air spaces, which generates a transepithelial osmotic gradient that leads to alveolar fluid reabsorption (AFR). 2The abbreviations used are: AFR, alveolar fluid reabsorption; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; BLM, basolateral membrane; ISO, isoproterenol; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD2, superoxide dismutase.2The abbreviations used are: AFR, alveolar fluid reabsorption; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; BLM, basolateral membrane; ISO, isoproterenol; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD2, superoxide dismutase. Sodium enters the apical membrane of alveolar epithelial cells through amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels (2.Eaton D.C. Chen J. Ramosevac S. Matalon S. Jain L. Proc. Am. Thorac.

However, the mechanisms by which hypoxia impairs AFR and alveolar epithelial sodium transport proteins has not been fully elucidated.A mechanism by which hypoxia might impair AFR is by altering the function of either apical epithelial sodium channels and/or basolateral Na,K-ATPase proteins. Several in vitro studies using cultured alveolar epithelial cells have demonstrated that exposure to hypoxia results in the decrease in epithelial sodium channels and Na,K-ATPase protein abundance (10.Planes C.

Other investigators have reported various mechanisms associated with the decrease in alveolar fluid reabsorption in animals exposed to hypoxia in vivo (9.Vivona M.L. Matthay M. Chabaud M.B.

These data suggest that (a) hypoxia decreases Na,K-ATPase activity by promoting the endocytosis of the Na,K-ATPase molecules, which is associated with a decrease in alveolar fluid reabsorption, (b) treatment with the β-adrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol, recruits functional Na,K-ATPase molecules to the plasma membrane following exposure to hypoxia and restores alveolar fluid reabsorption in rat lungs, and (c) overexpression of the reactive oxygen species scavenger, SOD2, prevents the hypoxia-mediated decrease in alveolar fluid reabsorption and Na,K-ATPase function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolated Perfused Lungs—The isolated perfused lung preparation used in our laboratory has been described (4.Azzam Z.S. Adir Y. Crespo A. Comellas A. Lecuona E. Dada L.A. Krivoy N. Rutschman D.H. Sznajder J.I. Ridge K.M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2004; 170: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, lungs were isolated from anesthetized rats (65 mg/kg Nembutal, intraperitoneal) following a 10-min ventilation with 100% O2. The pulmonary artery and left atrial appendage were cannulated and perfused with a solution of 3% bovine serum albumin in buffered physiological salt solution. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled albumin was added to the perfusate to monitor leakage of protein from the vascular space into the airways. The recirculating volume of the constant pressure perfusion system was 90 ml; arterial and venous pressures were set at 8 and 0 cm H2O, respectively. The lungs were excised from the thoracic cavity and placed in a “pleural” bath (100 ml) filled with the same bovine serum albumin solution. The entire system was maintained at 37 °C in a water bath. The lungs were then instilled via the tracheal catheter with 5 ml of bovine serum albumin containing Evans blue dye-labeled albumin, 22Na+, and [3H]mannitol. Samples were taken from the instillate, perfusate, and bath solutions following a 10-min equilibration period and 60 min later. Absorbance at 620 nm (for Evans blue dye-albumin), fluorescence (excitation 487 nm; emission 520 nm; for FITC-albumin), and scintillation counting (for 22Na+ and [3H]mannitol) were measured in centrifuged samples from each compartment.Calculations—The derivation of all equations involved in the mathematical model of edema clearance has previously been described in detail (4.Azzam Z.S. Adir Y. Crespo A. Comellas A. Lecuona E. Dada L.A. Krivoy N. Rutschman D.H. Sznajder J.I. Ridge K.M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2004; 170: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14.Rutschman D.H. Olivera W. Sznajder J.I. J. Appl. Physiol. 1993; 75: 1574-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Concentration of Evans blue dye-albumin was used to estimate airspace volume. As virtually all Evans blue dye-albumin remains in the airspace, instillate volume (V) at a given time can be calculated from the increase in airspace protein concentration. The total unidirectional out-flux of Na+ from the alveolar space, a result of active transport and passive movement, was calculated from the rate of loss of 22Na+ from the airspaces. Passive sodium flux was calculated by subtracting the active sodium flux, calculated from the rate of net fluid clearance, from the total. Similarly, the unidirectional volume flux of mannitol was calculated from the rate of loss of [3H]mannitol from the airspaces. Albumin flux from the pulmonary circulation into the alveolar space was determined from the fraction of FITC-albumin that appears in the alveolar instillate during the experimental protocol. For comparison, fluxes are reported as volume fluxes (volume/time) by using the appropriate solute concentrations.Perfusing with Low pO2 Levels—The perfusate and the instillate were bubbled with 95% oxygen, 5% CO2 and the final pO2 was measured using a NOVA Biomedical blood gas analyzer. pO2 levels were checked every 15 min during the 60-min experiment.Exposure to Hypoxia—Animals were placed in a Ruskinn INVIVO2 400 Hypoxia chamber with a 12:12-h light-dark cycle. Food and water were available ad libitum. Oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the chamber were continuously monitored while maintaining the chamber temperature between 18 and 22 °C.Adenovirus Infection Protocol—Rats were anesthetized with 40 mg/kg Nembutal intraperitoneally and orally intubated with a 14-gauge plastic catheter prior to adenoviral infection (15.Ridge K.M. Olivera W.G. Saldias F. Azzam Z. Horowitz S. Rutschman D.H. Dumasius V. Factor P. Sznajder J.I. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Three experimental groups were studied: Sham-surfactant (n = 6), Adnull (n = 8), and AdSOD2 (n = 10). A mixture of adenovirus in a 50% surfactant, 50% dialysis buffer vehicle was administered in four aliquots of 200 μl. Rats were rotated 90° between instillations given at 5-min intervals. Immediately before instillation, a forced exhalation was achieved by circumferential compression of the thorax. Compression was relinquished after endotracheal instillation of 200 μl of virus/vehicle followed by 800 μl of air. Rats were allowed to recover before extubation. Infected animals were maintained in separate isolator cages for 7 days prior to conducting experimental protocols.Immunohistochemistry—Longitudinal sections from each fixed lung were embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemical analysis. Five-micrometer sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through serial ethanol solutions. Using previously described methods, specimens were then treated with 3% H2O2 to reduce endogenous peroxidase activity prior to blocking of background (nonspecific) immunoreactivity with nonimmune goat serum. Primary antibody (1:500 dilution, Na,K-ATPase α1 Ab) was added for 1 ha t room temperature. Sections were washed with phosphate-buffered saline prior to the addition of goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. Immunodetection was accomplished via 3,39-diaminobenzidine staining for immunoperoxidase activity (Vector Elite ABC kit; Vector Laboratories, New Castle-upon-Tyne, UK). Sections were photographed (without counterstaining) using a digital photomicroscopy system (Spot II; Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI).Whole Cell Lysate and Basolateral Cell Membrane Isolation and Western Blot Analysis—Approximately two millimeters of peripheral lung tissue was collected from each lobe and homogenized to obtain whole cell lysates and basolateral membranes as previously described (16.Azzam Z.S.

Briefly, cell lysates were prepared by the addition of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifugation at 14,000 × g to eliminate the insoluble material. Basolateral membranes (BLM) were prepared using Percoll gradient centrifugation as described (17.Ridge K. Dada L. Lecuona E. Bertorello A. Katz A. Mochly-Rosen D. Sznajder J.I. Mol. Biol.

Briefly, peripheral lung tissue was homogenized in a buffer containing 300 mm mannitol in 12 mm Tris-HEPES, pH 7.6, and protease inhibitors as described above, then centrifuged twice to discard the nuclear and mitochondrial pellets. Supernatant was centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 30 min, and the BLM fraction was recovered after the membrane pellet was centrifuged in a 16% Percoll gradient at 48,000 × g for 30 min. Equal amount of proteins from cell lysates or BLMs were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with specific antibodies.Na,K-ATPase Activity—Na,K-ATPase activity was determined by [32P]ATP hydrolysis as described before (17.Ridge K.

Briefly, basolateral cell membrane proteins isolated from the peripheral lung were placed on ice, and aliquots (∼10 μg of protein) were transferred to the Na,K-ATPase assay medium (final volume 100 μl) containing NaCl 50 mm, KCl 5 mm, MgCl2 10 mm, EGTA 1 mm, Tris-HCl 50 mm, Na2ATP 7 mm, and [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol) in tracer amounts (3.3 nCi/μl). The samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was terminated by addition of 700 μl of trichloroacetic acid/charcoal (5/10% w/v) suspension and rapid cooling to 4 °C. After separating the charcoal phase (12,000 × g for 5 min) containing the unhydrolyzed nucleotide, the liberated 32P was counted in an aliquot (200 μl) from the supernatant. Na,K-ATPase activity was calculated as the difference between test samples (total ATPase activity) and samples assayed in the same medium but devoid of Na+ and K+ and in the presence of 4 mm ouabain (ouabain-insensitive ATPase activity). The results are expressed as mean nmol of Pi/mg of protein/h of triplicate measurements from three animals per group.Data Analysis—When comparisons were made between two experimental groups, an unpaired Student's t test was used. When multiple comparisons were made, a one way analysis of variance and Duncan's means comparison test were used. Results were considered significant when p < 0.05.RESULTSEffect of Low pO2 on Alveolar Fluid Reabsorption in an ex Vivo Model—We determined the effect of low levels of oxygen on AFR by perfusing, in different experiments, decreasing levels of oxygen through the pulmonary circulation of the isolated, perfused rat lung. We observed that when pO2 levels were decreased from 100 mm Hg to either 85 or 60 mm Hg for 60 min there was a 60 and 40% reduction in AFR, respectively. When pO2 levels were reduced to 40 mm Hg for 60 min there was an even greater reduction in AFR (Fig. 1A).The passive movement of small solutes ([3H]mannitol and 22Na+) and FITC-albumin across the epithelial barrier of the rat lung did not significantly change when pO2 levels were decreased in the pulmonary circulation of the isolated rat lungs as compared with control (data not shown), which validates the use of the model in assessing the role of low oxygen tension on AFR. The pulmonary circulation flow was measured periodically during the experiments and was similar (∼12 ml/min) in all groups (data not shown).The effect of low pO2 on the Na,K-ATPase was assessed in basolateral membranes isolated from the peripheral lung tissue, as we have previously described (16.Azzam Z.S. Dumasius V. Saldias F.J. Adir Y. Sznajder J.I. Factor P. Circulation. 2002; 105: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The Na,K-ATPase activity decreased from 64.1 ± 9.5 to 17.5 ± 3.4 nmol of Pi/mg of protein/h in the basolateral membrane of rat lungs perfused with a pO2 of 40 mm Hg as compared with control (Fig. 1B). The decrease in activity paralleled a decrease in the Na,K-ATPase α1 protein abundance in the basolateral membrane isolated from rat lungs perfused with a pO2 of 40 mm Hg (Fig. 1C). There was no decrease in the abundance of Na,K-ATPase protein in total cell lysates (Fig. 1C) suggesting that there was endocytosis of Na,K-ATPase but no degradation of the protein.Effect of Low pO2 on Alveolar Fluid Reabsorption in an in Vivo Model—We sought to determine whether there was a compensatory mechanism to prevent the decrease in AFR when animals (as opposed to isolated lungs) were exposed to low oxygen levels. Rats exposed to 8% oxygen for 24 h had significantly reduced rates of AFR as compared with normoxic rats (Fig. 2). Alveolar fluid reabsorption was inhibited even after 4 and 12 h of recovery in room air and returned to control levels only after 24 h of recovery in room air. The passive movement of small solutes ([3H]mannitol and 22Na+) and FITC-albumin across the epithelial barrier of the rat lung did not significantly change in the lungs of hypoxic rats (data not shown). There was increased cellularity in the lungs of rats exposed to 8% oxygen for 24 h as compared with normoxic control rats, but there were no significant structural changes in the hypoxic rat lungs (data not shown).FIGURE 2Alveolar fluid reabsorption was measured using the isolated perfused rat lung model in rats exposed to hypoxia (8% O2, 24 h) and then allowed to recover in 21% O2 for 4, 12, and 24 h. Results are expressed as means± S.E. of three to five experiments. The AFR was significantly decreased (+, p < 0.001) compared with that measured in normoxic control rats.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the decrease in AFR was because of changes in the expression and function of the Na,K-ATPase, we isolated basolateral membranes from peripheral lung tissue of normoxic, hypoxic (8% O2, 24 h), and hypoxic recovery rats (8% O2, 24 h followed by 21% O2, 24 h). As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, there was a significant decrease in Na,K-ATPase activity and Na,K-ATPase α1 protein abundance in basolateral membrane of hypoxic rats as compared with normoxic control rats or hypoxic recovery rats, respectively. Importantly, there was a 60% decrease in Na,K-ATPase α1 protein abundance in total cell lysates of hypoxic rats, which was restored to normoxic control levels following 24 h of recovery in room air as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that Na,K-ATPase is regulated during both short and long term hypoxia by altering the number of functional Na,K-ATPase molecules in the basolateral membrane. The apparent difference between acute exposure (see Fig. 1C) and prolonged exposure to low levels of oxygen (see Fig. 3C) is the abundance of Na,K-ATPase protein in total cell lysates. During prolonged exposure to hypoxia there is a decrease in Na,K-ATPase protein abundance. This decrease in protein abundance may be a reflection of increased degradation, presumably via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (28.Comellas, A. P., Dada, L. A., Lecuona, E., Pesce, L.

We sought to determine whether these “internalized” Na,K-ATPase molecules were available for recruitment to the basolateral membranes of rats exposed to 8% O2 for 24 h and then treated with ISO (10 μm, 60 min perfused through the pulmonary circulation) and whether this would restore AFR in hypoxic rat lungs. In normoxic control lungs, ISO (10–6 m) increased the rate of AFR by 100% (from 0.51 ± 0.05 to 1.05 ± 0.07 ml/h) and restored AFR to control levels in the lungs of hypoxic rats (from 0.02 ± 0.07 to 0.59 ± 0.03 ml/h) (Fig. 4A). The increase in AFR was associated with an increased Na,K-ATPase protein abundance in the basolateral membrane of ISO-treated hypoxic rat lungs as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4A, isoproterenol increased alveolar fluid reabsorption in rat lungs exposed to 8% O2 for 24 h (hypoxia); rats exposed to 8% O2 for 24 h and allowed to recover in room air for 24 h (recovery) as well as in normoxic control lungs.

To determine whether overexpression of the ROS scavenger SOD2 would prevent the hypoxia-induced decrease in AFR, spontaneously breathing rats were infected with an adenovirus expressing SOD2 (AdSOD2, 2–4 × 109 plaque-forming units) and compared with rats infected with a null virus (Adnull, 2–4 × 109 plaque-forming units) or sham-infected rats. Seven days postinfection, rats were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia (21 or 8% O2, respectively) for 24 h. Overexpression of SOD2 prevented the hypoxia-mediated decrease in AFR. Adnull- or sham-infected hypoxic rats had a significant decrease in AFR as compared with normoxic-control and AdSOD2 hypoxic rats (Fig. 5A). Lung homogenates were prepared, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-SOD2. There was an abundant expression of SOD2 in AdSOD2-infected rats as compared with Adnull-infected rats (Fig. 5B). Additionally, Na,K-ATPase activity and protein abundance in basolateral membrane isolated from the peripheral lung tissue of AdSOD2-infected rats exposed to hypoxia was not different from normoxic control rats (Fig. 5, C and D).FIGURE 5Rats were infected with AdSOD2 and compared with sham- and Adnull-infected rats.

These functional changes are associated with a significant decrease in Na,K-ATPase protein expression in total cell lysates, as well as in the basolateral membrane prepared from peripheral lung tissue. The hypoxia-mediated decrease in AFR and protein expression could be abrogated by treatment with either isoproterenol or the overexpression of SOD2.The present study also provides evidence that the effects of hypoxia on alveolar ion transport proteins (10.Planes C.

https://openalex.org/W2068716204,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis in the rat cerebral cortex is induced by the β2-adrenergic receptor agonist clenbuterol (CLE). Because NGF is a crucial neurotrophic factor for basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, defining the mechanisms that regulate its transcription is important for developing therapeutic strategies to treat pathologies of these neurons. We previously showed that the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein δ (C/EBPδ) contributes to NGF gene regulation. Here we have further defined the function of C/EBPδ and identified a role for cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in NGF transcription. Inhibition of protein kinase A in C6-2B glioma cells suppressed CLE induction of an NGF promoter-reporter construct, whereas overexpression of protein kinase A increased NGF promoter activity, particularly in combination with C/EBPδ. A CRE-like site that binds CREB was identified in the proximal NGF promoter, and C/EBPδ and CREB were found to associate with the NGF promoter in vivo. Deletion of the CRE and/or C/EBP sites reduced CLE responsiveness of the promoter. In addition, ectopic expression of C/EBPδ in combination with CLE treatment increased endogenous NGF mRNA levels in C6-2B cells. C/EBPδ null mice showed complete loss of NGF induction in the cerebral cortex following CLE treatment, demonstrating a critical role for C/EBPδ in regulating β2-adrenergic receptor-mediated NGF expression in vivo. Thus, our findings demonstrate a critical role for C/EBPδ in regional expression of NGF in the brain and implicate CREB in CLE-induced NGF gene transcription."

In the present study, we demonstrate that macrophages deficient for PI3K (p85α regulatory subunit) are impaired in nitric oxide (NO) production upon lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ stimulation and thus vulnerable for intracellular bacterial infection such as Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Although expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) is induced normally in PI3K-deficient macrophages, dimer formation of iNOS protein is significantly impaired. The amount of intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin, a critical stabilizing cofactor for iNOS dimerization, is decreased in the absence of PI3K.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 6184-6190PubMed Google Scholar, 33Chen Y.Q. Fisher J.H. Wang M.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4950-4959PubMed Google Scholar, 34Park S.J. Lee S.C. Hong S.H. Kim H.M. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 2002; 18: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, results from different reports have not been consistent. To clarify the precise function of PI3K in the regulation of NO production and mechanisms of host defense against microbes, we utilized our p85α-deficient mice as PI3K knock-out mice. In the present study, we found that PI3K-deficient macrophages produced less NO than wild-type macrophages after stimulation of with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and that these macrophages were further susceptible to bacterial infection. Although production of NO decreased in PI3K-deficient macrophages, the induction of iNOS protein was unaffected. We found that the formation of dimers of iNOS protein, which are required for enzymatic activity, was remarkably impaired in PI3K-deficient macrophages. We also observed a decreased the amount of BH4, which stabilizes iNOS dimers. The expression of GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1), a rate-limiting enzyme for BH4 synthesis was significantly decreased in the absence of PI3K as well. Collectively, our results indicate that class IA PI3K is important in dimerization of iNOS protein and thus critical in NO production and the innate immune response. Chemicals—LPS, LY294002, wortmannin, NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), and N6-iminoethyl-l-lysine (l-NIL) were purchased from Sigma. IFN-γ was purchased from Peprotec (London, UK). Animals—PI3K-deficient mice (6Suzuki H. Matsuda S. Terauchi Y. Fujiwara M. Ohteki T. Asano T. Behrens T.W. Kouro T. Takatsu K. Kadowaki T. Koyasu S. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) on a C57BL/6 background and control C57BL/6 mice (Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan) were housed under the specific pathogen-free condition in our mice facility. Cell Cultures—The mice were sacrificed, and the cells were harvested from peritoneal cavities by washing with RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES buffer, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acid solution, 1000 units/ml penicillin, 1000 mg/ml streptomycin, and 55 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (all purchased from Invitrogen). After an overnight incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, cells adhering to plastic dishes were used as macrophages. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were obtained from day 14 fetuses. After the livers were removed, the fetuses were homogenized and incubated with trypsin for 30 min, then with collagenase for 30 min and finally with DNase for 30 min at 37 °C. Chlamydial Infection—Chlamydophila pneumoniae J138 (35Shirai M. Hirakawa H. Ouchi K. Tabuchi M. Kishi F. Kimoto M. Takeuchi H. Nishida J. Shibata K. Fujinaga R. Yoneda H. Matsushima H. Tanaka C.

Dis. 2000; 181: 524-527Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was passaged, and the samples were stored at –80 °C until use. The infection of macrophages was established by centrifugation (700 × g) at 22°C for 1 h, followed by incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 1 h (36Matsushima H. Shirai M. Ouchi K. Yamashita K. Kakutani T. Furukawa S. Nakazawa T. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3175-3179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with or without 10 μm LY294002, 50 nm wortmannin, and indicated concentrations of NOS inhibitors. Then the inoculum was aspirated and replaced with RPMI 1640 containing no penicillin or streptomycin. Infected cells were incubated for up to 72 h. Assessment of C. pneumoniae Infection—Infected macrophages were fixed for 15 min in 95% ethanol and stained with the Chlamydia FA test reagent (Denka Seiken Co., Tokyo, Japan) or RR402 (Washington Research Foundation, Seattle, WA) (36Matsushima H. Shirai M. Ouchi K. Yamashita K. Kakutani T. Furukawa S. Nakazawa T. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3175-3179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A fluorescence microscopy was used to determine the number of inclusion body-forming units. At the same time, DNA from cultures was purified, and the amount of chlamydial DNA was determined by using real time PCR method (Quantitec real time PCR kit, Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands). Primers for specific sequences of the chlamydial genome were 5′-CTGCTGTGTAGATTGCGT-3′ and 5′-GGGACTATTCCATCTAACTCTC-3′; primers for mouse GAPDH for controls were 5′-TTGGGTTGTACATCCAAGCATTC-3′ and 5′-AGGTACAAGCCTTTATGCAGACA-3′. Determination of Nitrite and Nitrate—Macrophages (1 × 105 cells) were treated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 μg/ml LPS and 100 units/ml IFN-γ with or without 10 μm LY294002, and supernatants were collected after centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The concentration of nitrite (NO2–) + nitrate (NO3–) in cultured supernatant was determined via an NO2–/NO3– Assay Kit (Assay Design, Ann Arbor, MI). Briefly, 25-μl aliquots of supernatant were incubated with 25 μl of NADH solution and 50 μl of nitrate reductase solution for 30 min at 37 °C. An equal amount of Griess reagent was then added, and after 10 min in the dark, the color intensity of the samples was measured at 550 nm. Sodium nitrate was used to derive standard curve. The nitrite or nitrate concentration were also determined directly by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with a Griess reagent-flow reactor (37Akaike T. Inoue K. Okamoto T. Nishino H. Otagiri M. Fujii S. Maeda H. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Arginase Assay—Arginase activity was assessed as described previously (38Corraliza I.M. Campo M.L. Soler G. Modolell M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 174: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In brief, 1 × 105 cells were lysed with 50 μl of lysing solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% pepstatin, aprotinin, and antipain for 30 min at room temperature. After 50 μl of buffer containing 10 mm MnCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was added, arginase was activated by incubation for 10 min at 55 °C. The samples were mixed well with equal amounts of 0.5 m l-arginine for 60 min at 37 °C, and the enzyme reaction was stopped by addition of 400 μl of a mixture of acid (H2SO4: H3PO4:H20 = 1:3:7). The urea produced was visualized by use of 25 μl of 9% of 1-phenyl-1,2-propanedione-2-oxime solved in ethanol at 100 °C for 45 min. The color intensity of the samples was measured at 550 nm. Urea (Kataytama chemical, Osaka, Japan) was used to make standard curve. Real Time RT-PCR Analysis—Real time RT-PCR was performed with QuantiTec Real-Time RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) using Light Cycler (Roche Diagnostics) to quantify mRNA. The primers (sense/antisense) were iNOS, 5′-CTGCTTTGTGCGAAGTGTCAGT-3′ and 5′-GGCACCCAAACACCAAGCTC-3′; GCH1, 5′-GTGTGAGCATCACCTTGTTCC-3′ and 5′-CAATCCTGGCAAGTTTACTGAGAC-3′; GAPDH, 5′-CAACTTTGTCAAGCTCATTTCCTG-3′ and 5′-CCTCTCTTGCTCAGTGTCCTT-3′; CAT2, 5′-GCTAGAGAACCACCTTC-3′ and 5′-AGGCATAAAAGCACGTT-3. Thermal cycling parameters were 15 s at 94 °C, 20 s at 55 °C, and 10 s at 72 °C, followed by fluorescence acquisition. Data were calculated as a ratio, via the reference mRNA (GAPDH). Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai tesque, Kyoto, Japan). Proteins were resolved by using SDS-PAGE with 7.5% gel, transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter, and probed with specific antibodies. For fully denaturing SDS-PAGE, samples were boiled. For measurement of the iNOS dimer formation, samples were dissolved with sample buffer without boiling; electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C for low temperature SDS-PAGE (39Ohtsuka M. Konno F.

Anti-iNOS polyclonal antibody (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), anti-GAPDH antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), and anti-GCH1 antisera (44Nagatsu I. Ichinose H. Sakai M. Titani K. Suzuki M. Nagatsu T. J. Neural. Transm. 1995; 102: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were used for Western blotting, and specific proteins were detected with LumiGLO Reagent and Peroxide (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Determination of the Amount of BH4—BH4 content in the cell lysate was determined as the biopterin amount produced after iodine oxidation. The samples of cell lysate were sonicated, oxidized with 1% I2 and 2% KI in 1 n HCl for 60 min in the dark at room temperature, and analyzed by HPLC with fluorescence detection (45Fukushima T. Nixon J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 176-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Production of NO Induced by LPS and IFN-γ in Macrophages Depended on PI3K—Previous reports have described the effect of PI3K inhibitors on NO synthesis, but these reports have provided controversial results. We therefore investigated the effect of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 on murine peritoneal macrophages. Although macrophages produced a decreased amount of NO, as assessed by measuring total amount of nitrite plus nitrate in the culture supernatant, simultaneous stimulation with LPS (1 μg/ml) and IFN-γ (100 units/ml) induced a large amount of NO synthesis in 2 days (Fig. 1A). We found that LY294002 inhibited LPS and IFN-γ induced NO synthesis in murine peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 1A). An earlier study reported that wortmannin, another PI3K inhibitor, enhanced LPS-induced NO production in peritoneal macrophages (46Park Y.C. Lee C.H. Kang H.S. Chung H.T. Kim H.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 692-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because wortmannin has been known to inhibit many other ATP-dependent kinases, we decided to utilize our PI3K-deficient mice to investigate the effect of PI3K on NO synthesis. Although these PI3K-deficient mice still expressed p55α and p50α, two alternative splicing products from the p85α gene, we could detect little p50α and p55α protein in both wild-type and PI3K-deficient macrophages by Western blotting analysis (data not shown). Therefore, class IA-type PI3K was likely absent in the p85α-deficient macrophages. In wild-type macrophages, production of NO increased dramatically after treatment with LPS plus IFN-γ for 48 h, but this increase was reduced by 10 μm LY294002 (Fig. 1A). In contrast, peritoneal macrophages from PI3K-deficient mice produced about half the amount of NO after stimulation with LPS/IFN-γ compared with wild-type macrophages (Fig. 1B). At the same time, production of nitrate and nitrite were measured separately by HPLC coupled with a Griess reagent-flow reactor. Stimulation-dependent production of both nitrate and nitrite were reduced in PI3K-deficient macrophages (Fig. 1C). Induction of iNOS Was Independent of PI3K—Inasmuch as NO is produced by iNOS (NOS2) in macrophages, we investigated the expression of iNOS in PI3K-deficient macrophages. PI3K was reported to be involved in activation of NF-κB upon LPS stimulation (47Monick M.M. Carter A.B. Robeff P.K. Flaherty D.M. Peterson M.W. Hunninghake G.W. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4713-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and NF-κB was reportedly one of the major transcription factors associated with transcriptional regulation of the iNOS gene. Contrary to our expectation, iNOS mRNA expression induced by LPS and IFN-γ was unaltered in PI3K-deficient macrophages (Fig. 2A) even though production of NO was significantly decreased (Fig. 1). Western blotting analysis also showed that induction of iNOS protein by LPS/IFN-γ in PI3K-deficient macrophages was equivalent to that of wild-type macrophages (Fig. 2B). Consistent with the finding that induction of iNOS was unaffected, LPS/IFN-γ-induced interleukin-6 production, which also depends on NF-κB activation (48Dendorfer U. Oettgen P. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4443-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) was unchanged in PI3K-deficient macrophages (data not shown). Substrate Availability Was Not Altered in PI3K-deficient Macrophages—Despite the normal amount of iNOS protein, production of NO was significantly reduced in PI3K-deficient macrophages versus that in wild-type macrophages. NO production by iNOS is regulated by many factors in addition to the induction of the iNOS gene. One of these factors is the availability of its substrate l-arginine. l-Arginine is utilized by iNOS and arginase, which is up-regulated by LPS and Th2 cytokine stimulation (49Corraliza I.M. Soler G. Eichmann K. Modolell M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Elevated arginase activity thus prevents NO production by sequestering the substrate (26Chang C.I. Liao J.C. Kuo L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H342-H348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which leads to attenuated parasite killing in vitro and in vivo (50Gobert A.P. Daulouede S. Lepoivre M. Boucher J.L. Bouteille B. Buguet A. Cespuglio R. Veyret B. Vincendeau P. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4653-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 51Huang J. DeGraves F.J. Lenz S.D. Gao D. Feng P. Li D. Schlapp T. Kaltenboeck B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3914-3919Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Another important factor that determines intracellular arginine concentration is the expression level of CAT2. Neither arginase activity nor CAT2 expression level was altered in PI3K-deficient macrophages (Fig. 2, C and D). We concluded from all these data that reduced production of NO in PI3K-deficient macrophages is not because of lack of arginine. Dimerization of iNOS Was Greatly Reduced in PI3K-deficient Macrophages—The formation of iNOS protein dimers is essential for sustained enzymatic activity. To determine monomer/dimer status of iNOS, we performed Western blotting analysis with a low temperature SDS-PAGE method, which has been utilized in a numbers of previous reports (39Ohtsuka M. Konno F. Honda H. Oikawa T. Ishikawa M. Iwase N. Isomae K. Ishii F. Hemmi H. Sato S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 303: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 40Kolodziejski P.J.

A. 2004; 101: 2619-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, we detected 130 and 260 kDa bands, which corresponded to the monomer and the dimer of iNOS protein, respectively. Upper band was specifically disappeared upon sample boiling, which was known to induce dissociation of iNOS dimer (39Ohtsuka M. Konno F. Honda H. Oikawa T. Ishikawa M. Iwase N. Isomae K. Ishii F. Hemmi H. Sato S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 303: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 43Ravi K. Brennan L.A. Levic S. Ross P.A. Black S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2619-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A), and complete absence of both of the bands in iNOS-deficient macrophages confirmed the identity of the bands (Fig. 3B). As expected, we could not detect any iNOS proteins without LPS/IFN-γ-stimulation (Fig. 3A). We found that the formation of iNOS dimer was reduced in PI3K-deficient macrophages compared with that in wild-type macrophages (Fig. 3). Densitometric analysis revealed that ratio of dimers to monomer in LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated PI3K-deficient macrophages was approximately half of that in wild-type macrophages (Fig. 3A). Amount of Biopterin in PI3K-deficient Macrophage Was Reduced—Formation of iNOS protein dimers requires cofactors such as BH4, FMN, FAD, NADPH, and heme. BH4 stabilizes dimerized NOSs and is required for maximum activation of these enzymes (23Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Rodriguez-Crespo I. Gerber N.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16735-16745Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We quantified intracellular amounts of BH4 in stimulated PI3K-deficient macrophages. We measured biopterin, which is the stable oxidized product of BH4 by HPLC as the amount of intracellular BH4. As shown in Fig. 4A, the amount of biopterin increased after LPS/IFN-γ stimulation (54Gross S.S. Levi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25722-25729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in both wild-type and PI3K-deficient macrophages. With no stimulation, the content of biopterin in PI3K-deficient macrophages was slightly lower than that in wild-type macrophages, but it was significantly reduced in PI3K-deficient macrophages compared with wild-type macrophages after stimulation. Therefore, decreased production of BH4 seems to be responsible for reduced formation of iNOS dimers. If the lower BH4 content is the cause of reduced iNOS activity, the addition of exogenous BH4 should reestablish NO synthesis in PI3K-deficient macrophages. To test this hypothesis, we added sepiapterin, an immediate precursor of BH4, to culture medium during LPS/IFN-γ stimulation. As shown in Fig. 4B, addition of sepiapterin successfully restored NO production in PI3K-deficient macrophages. At the same time, the addition of sepiapterin restored impaired iNOS dimer formation found in PI3K-deficient macrophages (Figs. 3B and 4C). All of these results indicate that lower production of BH4 is responsible for reduced NO synthesis in PI3K-deficient macrophages. Induction of GCH1 Was Impaired in PI3K-deficient Macrophages—BH4 is synthesized from GTP by a three-step enzymatic reaction pathway, and GCH1 is a rate-determining enzyme among the three (55Nichol C.A.

The Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, and Cyp1b1 genes are up-regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. To elucidate their roles in dioxin-induced teratogenesis, we compared Cyp1a1(-/-), Cyp1a2(-/-), and Cyp1b1(-/-) knock-out mice with Cyp1(+/+) wild-type mice. Dioxin was administered (25 μg/kg, gavage) on gestational day 10, and embryos were examined on gestational day 18. The incidence of cleft palate and hydronephrosis was not significantly different in fetuses from Cyp1a1(-/-), Cyp1b1(-/-), and Cyp1(+/+) wild-type mice. To fetuses carried by Cyp1a2(-/-) dams, however, this dose of dioxin was lethal; this effect was absolutely dependent on the maternal Cyp1a2 genotype and independent of the embryonic Cyp1a2 genotype. Dioxin levels were highest in adipose tissue, mammary gland, and circulating blood of Cyp1a2(-/-) mothers, compared with that in the Cyp1(+/+) mothers, who showed highest dioxin levels in liver. More dioxin reached the embryos from Cyp1a2(-/-) dams, compared with that from Cyp1(+/+) dams.

Using the humanized hCYP1A1_1A2 transgenic mouse (expressing the human CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes in the absence of mouse Cyp1a2 gene), the teratogenic effects of dioxin reverted to the wild-type phenotype. These data indicate that maternal mouse hepatic CYP1A2, by sequestering dioxin and thus altering the pharmacokinetics, protects the embryos from toxicity and birth defects; substitution of the human CYP1A2 trans-gene provides the same protection.

Xia Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 69: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). TCDD is a potent teratogen. In mice, the most dramatic teratogenic effects, with TCDD exposure on or before gestational day 11 (GD11), are cleft palate, hydronephrosis, and open eye (14Couture L.A. Abbott B.D. Birnbaum L.S. Teratology. 1990; 42: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Ahr(-/-) knock-out mice are protected against in utero or lactational TCDD exposure (15Peters J.M. Narotsky M.G. Elizondo G. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Gonzalez F.J. Abbott B.D. Toxicol. Sci. 1999; 47: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 16Mimura J. Yamashita K. Nakamura K. Morita M. Takagi T.N. Nakao K. Ema M.

Interestingly, Ahr(+/-) heterozygous pups carried by Ahr(-/-) dams are 5-fold more sensitive to maternal TCDD exposure, compared with those carried by Ahr(+/+) dams; this effect may be explained in part by the patent ductus venosus, which exists in female Ahr(-/-) mice (19Lahvis G.P. Pyzalski R.W. Glover E. Pitot H.C. McElwee M.K. Bradfield C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 714-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, venous shunting by the liver eliminates first-pass elimination of many compounds that would otherwise be metabolized in liver. Indeed, pups carried by Ahr(-/-) dams are more sensitive to glucocorticoid exposure, and glucocorticoid metabolism is not affected by AHR-mediated pathways. Such first-pass elimination, however, likely does not explain enhanced TCDD toxicity, because TCDD is very poorly metabolized with a half-life of >30-180 days in mice (20Saghir S.A. Lebofsky M. Pinson D.M. Rozman K.K. Toxicology. 2005; 215: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 21Weber L.W. Ernst S.W. Stahl B.U. Rozman K. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1993; 21: 523-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is well established that binding of TCDD to the AHR is essential for its toxic actions (22Gonzalez F.J. Fernandez-Salguero P. Lee S.S. Pineau T. Ward J.M. Toxicol. Lett. 1995; 82 (83): 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Fernandez-Salguero P. Pineau T. Hilbert D.M. McPhail T. Lee S.S. Kimura S. Nebert D.W.

Acta. 2003; 1619: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). AHR, without its ligand, is present in the cytosol, and forms a complex with several chaperones: two heat shock protein α 90-kDa, class A member 2 (official name HSP90AA2; also called Hsp90) molecules, a small protein (p23), and an AHR-interacting protein AIP (also called XAP2) (25Hankinson O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). When TCDD binds the AHR, the complex translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and AHR switches partners from HSP90AA2 to aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) (26Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Mimura J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Then, this heterodimer binds a specific DNA motif, named the AHR response element (also called XRE) in the promoter region of many target genes (27Ma Q. Curr. Drug Metab. 2001; 2: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The AHR also interacts with other transcription factors, such as retinoblastoma protein-1 and NF-κβ; for these interactions, ARNT and/or AHR response element binding may not be necessary (28Olnes M.J. Verma M. Kurl R.N. Exp. Clin. Immunogenet. 1994; 11: 102-109PubMed Google Scholar, 29Puga A. Barnes S.J. Chang C. Zhu H. Nephew K.P. Khan S.A. Shertzer H.G. Biochem.

It has been shown that AHR directly or indirectly mediates the transcriptional activation of many genes, including those of the [Ahr] gene battery (11Nebert D.W. Roe A.L. Dieter M.Z. Solis W.A. Yang Y. Dalton T.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 65-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). This group includes three Cyp1 family members, the Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, and Cyp1b1 genes; CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 are central to the metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), whereas CYP1A2 substrates are mostly N-heterocyclics and arylamines. Emerging evidence from knock-out mice has demonstrated that intestinal and hepatic CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 are more important in detoxication (31Uno S. Dalton T.P. Shertzer H.G. Genter M.B. Warshawsky D.

Cyp1 expression is chronically activated by planar polyhalogenated aromatic dioxins such as TCDD; chronic activation occurs via the AHR and is the consequence of the poor metabolism and very slow elimination of this class of compounds. It has been hypothesized that TCDD-mediated toxicity is the consequence of chronic activation of the direct transcriptional targets of the AHR/ARNT heterodimer (23Fernandez-Salguero P. Pineau T.

In this regard, both Cyp1a1(-/-) and Cyp1a2(-/-) knock-out mice show some protection against high dose TCDD toxicity (7Uno S. Dalton T.P. Sinclair P.R. Gorman N. Wang B. Smith A.G. Miller M.L.

In all cases, genetic absence of either the CYP1A2 or CYP1A1 enzyme results in the dramatic lowering of risk or the complete ablation of uroporphyria; uroporphyria is likely to be important for protective effects in the liver. Many of the toxic manifestations of TCDD persist in Cyp1a1(-/-) or Cyp1a2(-/-) mice, suggesting that TCDD-mediated toxicity relies on cell type-specific alterations in the transcriptome (7Uno S. Dalton T.P. Sinclair P.R. Gorman N. Wang B. Smith A.G. Miller M.L. Shertzer H.G. Nebert D.W. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2004; 196: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar): in some cell types, such as the hepatocyte, Cyp1 genes play a role in TCDD-mediated toxicity, and in other cell types they do not. In the present study we have examined the roles of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1 during TCDD-induced teratogenesis. Chemicals—TCDD was purchased from Accustandard (New Haven, CT). [3H]TCDD (10 Ci/mmol) was a gift from Alvaro Puga (Cincinnati, OH). Animals—Mice were housed in a pathogen-free facility with food and water ad libitum. Wild-type Cyp1(+/+) (C57BL/6J) breeders were originally obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), and the breeders were maintained in the Nebert animal colony. The Cyp1a1(-/-) (42Dalton T.P. Dieter M.Z. Matlib R.S. Childs N.L. Shertzer H.G. Genter M.B. Nebert D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), Cyp1a2(-/-) (43Liang H.C. Li H. McKinnon R.A. Duffy J.J. Potter S.S. Puga A. Nebert D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1671-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and Cyp1b1(-/-) (44Buters J.T. Doehmer J. Gonzalez F.J. Drug Metab. Rev. 1999; 31: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) genotypes have all been backcrossed onto the C57BL6/J background for ten generations, meaning that the genomes of these knock-out lines are >99.9% C57BL6/J. The original Cyp1b1(-/-) knock-out mouse was generously provided by Frank J. Gonzalez (Bethesda, MD). All animal experiments were approved and conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health standards and the University of Cincinnati Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Biohazard Precaution—TCDD is a very toxic compound and a probable human carcinogen; all personnel were therefore instructed in safe handling procedures. Lab coats, gloves, and masks were worn at all times, and contaminated materials were collected separately for disposal by the Hazardous Waste Unit or by independent contractors. TCDD-pretreated mice were housed separately, and their carcasses were treated as contaminated biological materials. Treatment of Animals—Mice, 10-12 weeks old, were used in these studies. Female mice of the genotype indicated were mated to male mice of the indicated genotype. Gestational day zero (GD0) was the day on which a vaginal plug was detected. Unless otherwise indicated, pregnant females received, by gavage, either vehicle alone (corn oil, 100 μl) or the indicated dose of TCDD in 100 μl of corn oil, prepared as previously described (14Couture L.A. Abbott B.D. Birnbaum L.S. Teratology. 1990; 42: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 45Bryant P.L. Schmid J.E. Fenton S.E. Buckalew A.R. Abbott B.D. Toxicol. Sci. 2001; 62: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Real-time PCR Analysis—RT-PCR to quantify CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1 mRNA, was conducted on total RNA isolated from liver of corn oil- or TCDD-pretreated pregnant dams of the Cyp1(+/+), Cyp1a1(-/-), Cyp1a2(-/-), and Cyp1b1(-/-) genotypes. Total RNA (2.5 μg) was reverse-transcribed using oligo-dT, according to the protocol accompanying the Invitrogen Superscript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase kit (Carlsbad, CA). Following reverse transcription, RT-PCR was conducted using cDNA that was synthesized from 0.125 μgof total RNA. PCR products were detected, using Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Data were normalized to RT-PCR detection for β-actin, and the accumulation of β-actin mRNA did not differ significantly between untreated and treated liver. The cycle numbers for the detection of β-actin did not differ by more than 4-fold between tissues. Thus, normalization of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, or CYP1B1 mRNA accumulation to β-actin did not significantly alter the interpretation of data, especially because the most important comparisons are mouse CYP1A1, CYP1A2, or CYP1B1 mRNA accumulation between treated and control liver. The primers used in RT-PCR analysis were as follows (s, sense; as, antisense): mouse CYP1A1, 5′-ccacaagagatacaagtctg-3′ (s) and 5′-ccgatgcactttcgcttgc-3′ (as); mouse CYP1A2, 5′-acaacgagggacacctcac-3′ (s) and 5′-gggatctccccaatgcac-3′ (as); mouse CYP1B1, 5′-aatgaggagttcgggcgcaca-3′(s) and 5′-ggcgtgtggaatggtgacagg-3′ (as); and β-actin, 5′-catccgtaaagacctctatgcc-3′ (s) and 5′-acgcagctcagtaacagtcc-3′ (as). To avoid confusion caused by interference with genomic DNA, all Cyp1 primers span an intron of their respective genes. The β-actin primers spanned intron 5 of the ACTB gene. Detection of RT-PCR products required reverse transcription, and product analysis in all cases was consistent with cDNA detection. Enzyme Assays—Microsomes from liver were assayed for benzo-[a]pyrene hydroxylase (46Nebert D.W. Gelboin H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 6242-6249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and acetanilide 4-hydroxylase (47Shertzer H.G. Nebert D.W. Senft A.P. Dingeldein M. Genter M.B. Dalton T.P. Toxicol. Methods. 2001; 11: 81-88Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) activities, representing predominantly but not exclusively the CYP1A1/1B1 and CYP1A2 proteins, respectively. Assessment of TCDD-induced Teratogenesis—Each group started with a minimum of five pregnant females. TCDD or vehicle alone was given on GD10, and on GD18, the maternal-fetal unit was weighed, and the dam was anesthetized by CO2 inhalation and euthanized by cervical dislocation. The maternal liver and intact uterus were removed and weighed. The fetuses were removed from the uterus, weighed, and placed on ice. The parameters evaluated for each litter included the number of implantation sites and the number of live or dead fetuses. Teratogenesis was evaluated principally by the incidence of cleft palate (number of fetuses with cleft palate/total number of live fetuses) and the incidence and severity of hydronephrosis; presence and severity of hydronephrosis in each kidney was examined by microscopy, as previously described (48Birnbaum L.S. Harris M.W. Barnhart E.R. Morrissey R.E. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1987; 90: 206-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), using severity scores ranging from 0 to 3+ (0 = normal kidney; 1+ = slight decrease in length of papilla; 2+ = marked decrease in length of papilla with some loss of renal parenchyma; and 3+= complete absence of papilla, shell of kidney remaining with only a small amount of renal parenchyma). Fetuses were decapitated, and their mandible removed, to examine the palate. Dissected fetal head, liver, and kidney were placed in 4% paraformaldehyde, post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in ethanol and propylene oxide, embedded in Spurr's resin, and then sectioned for histological analysis. Tissue Distribution of TCDD—The amount of [3H]TCDD (10 Ci/mmol) used to spike the usual dose (TCDD, 25 μg/kg) was 20 μCi. For the Cyp1(+/+) and Cyp1a2(-/-) genotypes, three pregnant female mice of each were given an intraperitoneal injection of the spiked TCDD on GD15. Twenty-four hours later, on GD16, each individual fetus and each placenta was harvested from the uterus. The fetuses, placentas, and maternal liver, thymus, kidney, spleen, heart, brain, adipose tissue, mammary gland, and lung were weighed and added to hyamine hydroxide (1 ml/100 mg) in glass scintillation vials. Maternal and fetal blood was similarly digested with hyamine hydroxide (1 ml/100 μl). The ratio of hyamine hydroxide to tissue was based on the manufacturer's recommendations (ICN Radiochemicals, Irvine, CA). After 5 days of digestion, 5 ml of Cytoscint (ICN Radiochemicals) was added to the samples, and the radioactivity was determined. Measurement of Mitochondrial Hydrogen Peroxide Production— Hepatic mitochondria were isolated, using differential centrifugation; succinate-dependent H2O2 liberated from mitochondria was measured as previously described (49Shen D. Dalton T.P. Nebert D.W. Shertzer H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25305-25312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 50Senft A.P. Dalton T.P. Nebert D.W. Genter M.B.

Briefly, reaction mixtures, containing 5 μm luminal (5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione), 2.5 units/ml horseradish peroxidase, 50 μg of fresh mitochondrial protein in 0.1 m KCl-RB buffer (140 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), comprised a final volume of 1.00 ml. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 6.0 mm sodium succinate and monitored at 37 °C by using a Berthold Autolumat Plus luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Luminol is highly specific for measuring H2O2 production. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed using Sigmastat software. When comparing control and TCDD-treated mice, the values were compared using analysis of variance analysis. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Three Cyp1 Knock-out Mouse Lines—In mammals, the CYP1 gene family contains three members: CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1; targeted null mutant mice have been described for each of these genes (42Dalton T.P. Dieter M.Z. Matlib R.S. Childs N.L. Shertzer H.G. Genter M.B. Nebert D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 43Liang H.C. Li H.

Drug Metab. Rev. 1999; 31: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Each of these knock-out lines shows normal fecundity and no overt phenotype. In our mouse colony, all three Cyp1 knock-out lines have been bred into the C57BL6/J (B6) inbred mouse strain (>99.9%) background; consequently, B6 inbred mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and used as the wild-type Cyp1(+/+) control. This inbred strain and the three knock-out lines thus express the high affinity Ahr(b1) allele. Our initial hypothesis was that loss of one or more of the CYP1 enzymes would protect mice against TCDD-induced teratogenesis. Therefore, to the pregnant dam at GD10 we administered a dose of TCDD (25 μg/kg) by gavage; this dose is known to induce a high incidence of birth defects in wild-type mice (14Couture L.A. Abbott B.D. Birnbaum L.S. Teratology. 1990; 42: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 18Thomae T.L. Glover E. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1996; 113: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). CYP1 mRNA Levels and Enzyme Activities—As previously reported (42Dalton T.P. Dieter M.Z. Matlib R.S. Childs N.L. Shertzer H.G. Genter M.B. Nebert D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), constitutive CYP1A1 mRNA is not detected in liver from Cyp1(+/+) wild-type mice, but this dose of TCDD (25 μg/kg) causes maximal CYP1A1 mRNA and protein induction within 16-24 h, which persists for several weeks. In Cyp1a1(-/-) knock-out mice (Fig. 1A), hepatic CYP1A1 mRNA was not detected in either untreated or TCDD-treated animals. Following TCDD treatment, hepatic CYP1A1 mRNA was highly induced in Cyp1(+/+), Cyp1a2(-/-), and Cyp1b1(-/-) mice. In Cyp1a2(-/-) mice (Fig. 1B), hepatic CYP1A2 mRNA was not detected in either untreated or TCDD-treated animals. Basal CYP1A2 mRNA levels were present in untreated Cyp1(+/+), Cyp1a1(-/-), and Cyp1b1(-/-) mice, and CYP1A2 mRNA was highly induced in these three groups by TCDD. As previously reported (35Uno S. Dalton T.P. Dragin N. Curran C.P. Derkenne S. Miller M.L. Shertzer H.G. Gonzalez F.J. Nebert D.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1103-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), constitutive CYP1B1 mRNA is very low in liver. In Cyp1b1(-/-) knock-out mice (Fig. 1C), hepatic CYP1B1 mRNA was not detected in either untreated or TCDD-treated animals. Following TCDD treatment, hepatic CYP1B1 mRNA was induced to a small degree in Cyp1(+/+), Cyp1a1(-/-), and Cyp1a2(-/-) mice. RT-PCR is a highly sensitive technique, and, although CYP1B1 is not present in the hepatocyte, the induced CYP1B1 mRNA is probably located in stellate cells, Kupffer cells, and/or vascular endothelial cells of liver. The mRNA data are further supported by the hepatic enzyme assays. For benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase (Fig. 1D), which predominantly reflects CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 activity, increases in this hydroxylase were found for all TCDD-treated mice, except for the Cyp1a1(-/-) knock-out line. The constitutive benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase activity shown in Fig. 1D reflects a CYP2C enzyme, which shows hepatic benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase activity in untreated mice (52Meehan R.R. Speed R.M. Gosden J.R. Rout D. Hutton J.J. Taylor B.A. Hilkens J. Kroezen V. Hilgers J. Adesnik M. Friedberg T. Hastie N.D. Wolf C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2662-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For acetanilide 4-hydroxylase (Fig. 1E), which predominantly reflects CYP1A2 activity, increases in this activity were found for all TCDD-treated mice, except for the Cyp1a2(-/-) mouse. The constitutive acetanilide 4-hydroxylase, which is detected in all groups except Cyp1a2(-/-) mice, parallels the basal CYP1A2 mRNA levels found in all untreated groups except Cyp1a2(-/-) mice. Effect of the Three CYP1 Family Members on TCDD-induced Fetal Death—High doses of TCDD are known to cause wasting, which is a hallmark of acute TCDD toxicity (7Uno S. Dalton T.P. Sinclair P.R. Gorman N. Wang B. Smith A.G. Miller M.L. Shertzer H.G. Nebert D.W. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2004; 196: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The dose of TCDD that we used (25 μg/kg) had no effect on the body weight of dams of the four genotypes (Fig. 2A), suggesting the absence of TCDD toxicity; alternatively, because the experiment was terminated after only 8 days of TCDD exposure, it is probably too soon to see any manifestation of significant wasting. Similarly, no significant effect on litter size was seen among the four groups (Fig. 2B). Because TCDD gavage was performed on GD10, which is well after implantation (GD3.5), it is not surprising that we saw no effect on the number of implantation sites, which was assessed on GD18. Thus, this dose of TCDD on GD10 did not alter the number of implanted fetuses between control and TCDD-treated wild-type, as well as any of the three Cyp1 knock-out lines. The weights of the viable fetuses also did not differ between control and TCDD-treated Cyp1(+/+), Cyp1a1(-/-), and Cyp1b1(-/-) mice, whereas TCDD-treated Cyp1a2(-/-"
https://openalex.org/W1979243502,"The Bacillus subtilis AddAB enzyme possesses ATP-dependent helicase and nuclease activities, which result in the unwinding and degradation of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) upon translocation. Similar to its functional counterpart, the Escherichia coli RecBCD enzyme, it also recognizes and responds to a specific DNA sequence, referred to as Chi (χ). Recognition of χ triggers attenuation of the 3′- to 5′-nuclease, which permits the generation of recombinogenic 3′-overhanging, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), terminating at χ. Although the RecBCD enzyme briefly pauses atχ, no specific binding of RecBCD toχ during translocation has been documented. Here, we show that the AddAB enzyme transiently binds to its cognate χ sequence (χBs: 5′-AGCGG-3′) during translocation. The binding of AddAB enzyme to the 3′-end of the χBs-specific ssDNA results in protection from degradation by exonuclease I. This protection is gradually reduced with time and lost upon phenol extraction, showing that the binding is non-covalent. Addition of AddAB enzyme to processed, χBs-specific ssDNA that had been stripped of all protein does not restore nuclease protection, indicating that AddAB enzyme binds toχBs with high affinity only during translocation. Finally, protection of χBs-specific ssDNA is still observed when translocation occurs in the presence of competitor χBs-carrying ssDNA, showing that binding occurs in cis. We suggest that this transient binding of AddAB toχBs is an integral part of the AddAB-χBs interaction and propose that this molecular event underlies a general mechanism for regulating the biochemical activities and biological functions of RecBCD-like enzymes. The Bacillus subtilis AddAB enzyme possesses ATP-dependent helicase and nuclease activities, which result in the unwinding and degradation of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) upon translocation. Similar to its functional counterpart, the Escherichia coli RecBCD enzyme, it also recognizes and responds to a specific DNA sequence, referred to as Chi (χ). Recognition of χ triggers attenuation of the 3′- to 5′-nuclease, which permits the generation of recombinogenic 3′-overhanging, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), terminating at χ. Although the RecBCD enzyme briefly pauses atχ, no specific binding of RecBCD toχ during translocation has been documented. Here, we show that the AddAB enzyme transiently binds to its cognate χ sequence (χBs: 5′-AGCGG-3′) during translocation.

We suggest that this transient binding of AddAB toχBs is an integral part of the AddAB-χBs interaction and propose that this molecular event underlies a general mechanism for regulating the biochemical activities and biological functions of RecBCD-like enzymes. Double-stranded DNA breaks are a serious threat to all organisms. Even in the absence of any DNA-damaging agents, double-stranded DNA breaks occur frequently because of the collapse of stalled replications forks or the presence of daughter strand DNA gaps or nicks ahead of the fork (1Michel B. Ehrlich S.D. Uzest M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 2Kuzminov A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 3Michel B.

In bacteria, these lesions are usually dealt with by homologous DNA recombination, which is a powerful tool to faithfully repair double-stranded DNA breaks and to restore DNA replication forks (5Michel B. Flores M.J. Viguera E. Grompone G. Seigneur M. Bidnenko V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8181-8188Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, the multifunctional heterotrimeric RecBCD enzyme is the main protein complex responsible for the processing of double-stranded DNA breaks. RecBCD enzyme can bind to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) 5The abbreviations used are: dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; Exo I, exonuclease I; PAS, primosome assembly site. 5The abbreviations used are: dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; Exo I, exonuclease I; PAS, primosome assembly site. ends and translocate inward in a rapid and processive manner because of its bipolar helicase activity (6Dillingham M.S. Spies M. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 2003; 423: 893-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 7Taylor A.F. Smith G.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). While translocating through the DNA lattice, unwinding is normally accompanied by nucleolytic degradation of both DNA strands until recognition of a specific eight-nucleotide sequence, called χ (5′-GCTGGTGG-3′). Upon χ recognition, the enzyme briefly pauses before resuming translocation at a slower pace and the vigorous 3′- to 5′-exonuclease activity is attenuated, whereas the 5′-to 3′-exonuclease is up-regulated (8Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Spies M. Bianco P.R. Dillingham M.S. Handa N. Baskin R.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 2003; 114: 647-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This allows for the generation of long, 3′-overhanging, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that terminates at χ (referred to hereafter as χ-containing ssDNA). The χ-modified RecBCD enzyme also coordinates the preferential loading of the homologous pairing protein, RecA, onto the resulting χ-containing ssDNA (10Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This facilitated loading of the RecA protein results in the preferential incorporation of χ-containing ssDNA into homologously paired recombination intermediates, and provides an efficient means of linking the processing and homologous pairing stages of homologous DNA recombination. In the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the AddAB enzyme is the functional homologue of RecBCD and is responsible for processing dsDNA ends. The AddAB helicase/nuclease is the founding member of a growing family of enzymes involved in the initiation of DNA recombination in Gram-positive bacteria (11Chédin F. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For two of these members, the B. subtilis AddAB enzyme (12Chédin F. Noirot P. Biaudet V. Ehrlich S.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1369-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and the Lactococcus lactis RexAB enzyme (13Biswas I. Maguin E. Ehrlich S.D. Gruss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2244-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 14el Karoui M. Ehrlich D. Gruss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), it is already known that the biological and enzymatic activity of these heterodimeric enzymes is regulated by a short, specific DNA sequence. Thus, the paradigm established for the RecBCD-χ interaction appears to be broadly conserved in bacterial evolution. Comparative analysis of protein sequences reveals that the AddA subunit is equivalent to the RecB subunit, with the presence of typical helicase and ATPase motifs, together with a C-terminal nuclease motif (15Kooistra J. Haijema B.J. Hesseling-Meinders A. Venema G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 16Haijema B.J. Venema G. Kooistra J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5086-5091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wang J. Chen R. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 507-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The AddB subunit shows weak resemblance to the RecC subunit and also to members of the UvrD/Rep family (Superfamily 1) of DNA helicases. It also carries a second conserved nuclease domain at its C terminus. This suggests that, unlike RecBCD, which possesses only one nuclease domain, degradation of each strand of the DNA duplex is carried out by individual nuclease sites in AddAB (18Chédin F. Ehrlich S.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Quiberoni A. Biswas I. El Karoui M. Rezaiki L. Tailliez P. Gruss A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4071-4078Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that AddAB enzyme only possesses two subunits, expression of AddAB enzyme or of the RexAB enzyme, fully complements an E. coli recBCD deletion strain for cell viability, UV survival, and conjugational recombination frequency (14el Karoui M. Ehrlich D. Gruss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 20Kooistra J. Haijema B.J. Venema G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In vivo, the AddAB enzyme effectively degrades linear dsDNA unless it carries a properly oriented 5-nucleotide sequence (5′-AGCGG-3′), which is the analogue of the E. coli χ sequence in B. subtilis (referred to as χBs) (12Chédin F. Noirot P. Biaudet V. Ehrlich S.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1369-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In vitro, the AddAB enzyme binds to dsDNA ends and uses energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to catalyze the unwinding and degradation of both DNA strands. Recognition of χBs by AddAB results in the attenuation of its 3′-to5′-nuclease activity. The 5′- to 3′-nuclease activity remains unaffected, however, leading to the generation of long 3′-overhanging, ssDNA fragments terminating at χBs (18Chédin F. Ehrlich S.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The manner by which the RecBCD or AddAB complexes recognize and interact with their cognate χ sequence while translocating through DNA at rates of up to several hundred base-pairs (bp) per second is still unclear. In the case of RecBCD enzyme, early studies showed that under certain conditions, the RecBCD enzyme undergoes a χ-dependent inactivation, characterized by the reduced ability of the enzyme to catalytically process χ-containing DNA molecules (21Dixon D.A. Churchill J.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2980-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Anderson D.G. Churchill J.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27139-27144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the enzyme dissociates into subunits after DNA processing (23Taylor A.F. Smith G.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 890-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, recent single molecule microscopy experiments revealed that although χ recognition results in a brief pause of the enzyme at χ that is followed by a reduced rate of translocation (9Spies M. Bianco P.R. Dillingham M.S. Handa N. Baskin R.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 2003; 114: 647-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the heterotrimeric form of the enzyme persists and continues to translocate after χ recognition (24Handa N. Bianco P.R. Baskin R.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 745-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, subunit dissociation does not explain how χ recognition results in a persistent change in enzyme activity that can be maintained for distances of up to 30 kilobases but yet is fully reversible upon dissociation. Interestingly, single molecule studies showed that the newly generated χ-containing ssDNA remains associated with the translocating RecBCD enzyme (9Spies M. Bianco P.R. Dillingham M.S. Handa N. Baskin R.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 2003; 114: 647-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), although the mechanistic significance of this observation is yet to be fully explored. Here, we report that AddAB enzyme also undergoes a χBs-dependent inactivation process, and we provide the first direct evidence that this behavior occurs by the non-covalent binding of the enzyme to the 3′-end of the newly generated χBs ssDNA that persists during the course of translocation. We suggest that this previously undisclosed interaction represents the underlying regulatory event that is responsible for all of the enzymatic changes that are elicited by interaction with χ and that this molecular event reversibly switches the RecBCD/AddAB family of enzymes from DNA-destroying to DNA-repairing enzymes. Reagents and Proteins—Chemical reagents and ATP were purchased from Sigma. Shrimp alkaline phosphatase and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from United States Biochemical Corp and PerkinElmer, respectively. Proteinase K was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Restriction endonucleases and T4 polynucleotide kinase were from New England Biolabs (NEB). SSB protein was prepared as described previously (25Harmon F.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). AddAB protein was purified as described below. Cloning of the addA and addB Genes of B. subtilis for Overexpression Purposes—Cloning of the addA and addB genes from B. subtilis was achieved by PCR from genomic DNA. Primers were designed based on the published sequence of the B. subtilis genome (26Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. Albertini A.M. Alloni G. Azevedo V. Bertero M.G. Bessieres P. Bolotin A. Borchert S. Borriss R. Boursier L. Brans A. Braun M. Brignell S.C. Bron S. Brouillet S. Bruschi C.V. Caldwell B. Capuano V. Carter N.M. Choi S.K. Codani J.J. Connerton I.F. Danchin A. Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3088) Google Scholar), which allowed the amplification of the entire addA and addB genes immediately flanked by suitable restriction endonuclease recognition sequences (NdeI and XhoI for addA and NcoI and BamHI for addB). For addA, the forward and reverse primer sequences were 5′-GCGGATGCATATGAACATTCCTAAACCGGCAG-3′ and 5′-GCTTATGGCTCGAGCTATAATGTCAGAATGTGCCC-3′, respectively. For addB, the sequences were 5′-GTCTTCTGCCATGGGAGCAGAGTTTTTAGTAGG-3′ and 5′-TGCTGTCCGGATCCTTAGGAATGTTCATTGTCATC-3′. The template DNA was purified from B. subtilis strain 168 supplied by Dr. Sabine Autret (Errington Laboratory, University of Oxford, UK). The addA and addB sequences were then inserted into the pET22b and pET28a vectors (Novagen), respectively, at the restriction sites listed above using standard cloning techniques to create plasmids pAddA-22b and pAddB-28a. DNA sequencing (MWG-Biotech) was used to confirm that the final sequences of the entire genes, as well as the promoter regions of the vectors, were identical to those published previously. Expression and Purification of AddAB Protein—For expression of AddAB protein, the pAddA-22b and pAddB-28a plasmids were freshly transformed into E. coli B834 (DE3) cells (Novagen). An overnight starter culture of these cells was used to inoculate 12 liters of phosphate-buffered LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml kanamycin. The cells were grown at 37 °C until they reached mid-log phase. At this point 1 mm IPTG and a further 25 μg/ml ampicillin were added to the medium. The growth temperature was simultaneously dropped to 25 °C, which increases the yield of soluble proteins. Growth was continued for a further 3-4 h before the cells were harvested, resuspended in 150 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.5, and 10% sucrose, and stored at -80 °C. All subsequent purification steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were lysed in the presence of 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride using Brij lysis. Briefly, lysozyme was added to 0.2 mg/ml, followed by a 30-min incubation with stirring. Next, EDTA was added to 1.5 mm followed by stirring for 30 min. Finally Brij-58 was added slowly to a final concentration of 0.3% over 30 min with stirring. The soluble cell extract was recovered by centrifugation and ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 50%. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer B (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) + 100 mm NaCl, and dialyzed against the same buffer overnight. The protein sample was loaded onto a Fast-Flow Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences-GE Healthcare) in Buffer B + 100 mm NaCl, washed with buffer B + 300 mm NaCl, and eluted with a gradient to 600 mm NaCl. This eluate was dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, + 1 mm dithiothreitol. It was then loaded in this buffer onto a Bio-Gel hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad) and eluted with a gradient to 300 mm potassium phosphate buffer. After dialysis against buffer B + 100 mm NaCl, the sample was loaded in the same buffer onto a Hi-Trap heparin column (Amersham Biosciences-GE Healthcare). At this stage, the sample contains a molar excess of AddA protein but, unlike AddAB protein, AddA does not bind to the heparin. The AddAB protein was eluted with a gradient to 500 mm NaCl, and peak fractions were collected. The sample was diluted with B buffer to a conductivity equivalent to buffer B + 100 mm NaCl and loaded onto a 10-ml mono-Q column (Amersham Biosciences-GE Healthcare). After washing with buffer B + 200 mm NaCl, AddAB protein was eluted with a gradient to 600 mm NaCl. Most of the protein was present in a major peak at ∼40% (equivalent to ∼350 mm NaCl) through the gradient. This protein was collected, dialyzed against buffer B + 100 mm NaCl + 50% glycerol, and stored at -80 °C. Concentration was determined using a theoretical extinction coefficient (ϵ = 251,900 m-1·cm-1), and the protein was judged to be greater than 95% pure by SDS-PAGE analysis. Functionality was assessed using a dye-displacement assay and protein titrations, as described earlier (27Roman L.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2863-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The protein preparations used here were between 25 and 50% active. DNA Substrates—Plasmids, pADGF0 (χ0), pADG6406-1 (carrying one χBs site, χ+) and pADGF1 (carrying three χBs sites in both orientations, χ+++) were described previously (18Chédin F. Ehrlich S.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Tailed DNA substrates were prepared as described previously (18Chédin F. Ehrlich S.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Labeling at the 5′-end was carried out using T4 polynucleotide kinase with [γ-32P]ATP after shrimp alkaline phosphatase treatment of the linearized DNA. The oligonucleotides used here were SKNH55, 5′-TCACAAACAGAATGATGTACGTCTAAAGATTAAAT-3′ (χ0) and SKNH56, 5′-TCACAAACAGAATGATGTACGTCTAAAGATAGCGG-3′ (χBs). Helicase Inactivation Assay—Standard reactions contained 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm magnesium acetate, 6.25 μm nucleotides linear DNA (corresponding to 1.03 nm molecule), 2 μm E. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB), 1 mm ATP, and 0.26 nm functional AddAB (AddAB:dsDNA ends ratio = 1:8). The DNA substrates were linearized by BamHI digestion. Reactions were initiated by addition of AddAB enzyme and incubated at 37 °C. Samples were taken at the indicated time points, deproteinized by digestion with Proteinase K, and processed by electrophoresis through 1% agarose gels at 4 V/cm for 4 h in 1× TAE buffer. After separation of the reaction products, the gels were dried and exposed to PhosphorImager screens and quantified using the ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics). χ-Protection Assay—Typical reactions contained 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm nucleotide linear pADG6406-1 (corresponding to 1.6 nm molecules), 2 μm SSB protein, and 3.2 nm (unless otherwise specified) functional AddAB enzyme. Assays were performed at 37 °C. Tailed DNA substrates were prepared as described (18Chédin F. Ehrlich S.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) so that AddAB can only access the linear dsDNA from one entry site. Two minutes after initiation of the reaction by the addition of the enzyme, Exonuclease I (NEB), a3′-to5′-ssDNA exonuclease, was added to a final concentration of 0.8 units/μl. Samples were taken at the indicated time points and processed as described above. When indicated, a phenol extraction was carried out 30 s after the addition of Exonuclease I, followed by an ethanol precipitation. The pellets were then resuspended in water and further desalted by passage through a G-25 spin column (Amersham Biosciences-GE Healthcare) equilibrated with water. Standard buffer components were then added back to a final volume of about half of the initial volume to compensate for the loss of DNA incurring during the procedure. The samples were then treated with various combinations of enzymes, as indicated. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 min after each new addition, and the products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis as described above. Competition Experiment—The reaction conditions were similar to the ones described for the χ protection assay, except that a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides was added after the addition of AddAB enzyme. The oligonucleotides used here either contained or did not contain a χBs sequence at their 3′-end (SKNH55 or SKNH56, respectively). The concentration of the SSB protein was 4.5 μm. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 min before the addition of each component. The reaction was initiated by addition of ATP. Exonuclease I was added to the reactions after 2 min. Samples were taken at the indicated time points and processed as described above. The AddAB Enzyme Shows χBs-Dependent Inactivation—We first investigated the consequences of χBs recognition on the ability of the AddAB enzyme to process a linear DNA substrate. For this, we used three different DNA substrates carrying zero (χ0), one (χ+), or three (χ+++) χBs sites (Fig. 1A). These DNA substrates were linearized, radiolabeled at their 5′-ends, and incubated with a limiting amount of enzyme (1 functional AddAB enzyme/8 DNA ends; 12.5% saturation). Substrate usage was then followed as a function of time after separation of the reaction products by agarose gel electrophoresis. In the case of the RecBCD enzyme, it is known that, at least under certain conditions (21Dixon D.A. Churchill J.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2980-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), interaction with χ can result in a χ-dependent, reversible inactivation of the enzyme. As shown in Fig. 1B, processing of a χ0 substrate by AddAB enzyme is catalytic, with substrate usage reaching near completion after 5 min, in agreement with results obtained using a more sensitive real time dye-displacement assay. 6F. Chédin and S. C. Kowalczykowski, unpublished observations. However, in the presence of three χBs sites, the efficiency of the reaction was markedly lower (Fig. 1B). Quantification of multiple independent experiments showed that substrate usage for χ0 DNA reached 75% after 5 min, compared with 25% for χ+++ DNA. An intermediate situation was observed for a χ+ substrate, for which substrate usage showed a modest but significant decrease compared with χ0 DNA. The lower level of this reduction was expected for two reasons: 1) in one-half of the processing events, the AddAB enzyme approached the χBs site from the wrong orientation and did not recognize it, and 2) as for the E. coli RecBCD enzyme, χBs recognition for those AddAB enzymes that approached from the correct orientation is not 100% efficient. Therefore, a substrate carrying three χBs sites that can be recognized by the enzyme in either orientation is expected to lead to a much greater effect, as observed here. Thus, the AddAB enzyme, like its E. coli analogue, shows χBs-dependent inactivation with the lower yield of processed χBs-containing substrates resulting from a reduced ability of AddAB enzyme to cycle through multiple DNA molecules in a catalytic manner. χBs-Specific ssDNA Is Protected from Exonuclease I Degradation due to Binding of AddAB to the 3′-End of χBs—To explain the mechanism by which χBs-dependent inactivation occurs, we speculated that the AddAB enzyme might remain bound to the DNA products generated during the unwinding reaction. To address this possibility, we used exonuclease I (Exo I) as a probe for the presence of a protein bound to the 3′-end of the ssDNA. Nucleolytic degradation of ssDNA by Exo I proceeds in a 3′- to 5′-direction and is sensitive to the presence of proteins bound to the 3′-end. This property was used to show that RecBCD enzyme loads E. coli RecA protein onto the 3′-end of the χ-containing ssDNA produced during dsDNA processing (10Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Similarly, Exo I activity can be inhibited by the formation of secondary structure in ssDNA (28Lehman I.R. Nussbaum A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2628-2636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we used a tailed DNA substrate either carrying or lacking a single χBs site (Fig. 2A), and we initiated the reaction with a saturating amount of AddAB enzyme. Tailed DNA ensures that the AddAB enzyme enters and translocates through the DNA from only one end. As described earlier (18Chédin F. Ehrlich S.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), processing of the χ0 DNA by the AddAB enzyme resulted in the unwinding and degradation of much of the dsDNA substrate, but some full-length ssDNA is also produced (Fig. 2B, lanes 1-3). Addition of Exo I after completion of the reaction (2 min) led to the rapid and complete disappearance of this full-length ssDNA, indicating that this DNA species was fully available for degradation by Exo I. Unexpectedly, a novel prominent band appeared after treatment by Exo I (Fig. 2B, lanes 4-6). Using alkaline gel electrophoresis, we determined that this DNA species migrates at a position consistent with a 5′-end-labeled DNA fragment ending at the primosome assembly site (PAS) present on these substrates (data not shown). This PAS site corresponds to the B. subtilis pAMβ1 PAS site, which was described as capable of adopting a strong secondary structure (29Bruand C. Ehrlich S.D. Janniere L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2642-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We therefore conclude that this stable DNA fragment occurs because of inhibition of degradation by Exo I by the strong DNA secondary structure formed at PAS. When a χBs-containing substrate was used, a 5′-end-labeled top strand χBs-specific DNA fragment was observed in addition to full-length ssDNA (Fig. 2B, lanes 7-9), as described earlier (18Chédin F. Ehrlich S.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Addition of Exo I after 2 min led to the appearance of the PAS fragment generated by degradation of the full-length ssDNA species up to the PAS site, showing that Exo I was functional. In sharp contrast, however, the χBs-specific ssDNA was largely resistant to degradation (Fig. 2B, lanes 10-12). Such protection of the χBs-specific fragment from Exo I degradation was unexpected. Unlike the RecBCD system, where the RecA protein is strictly required to observe protection of χ-specific fragments from degradation, RecA protein was absent from our assays. Quantification of the protection over time revealed that although Exo I degraded almost all of the full-length ssDNA and about one-half of the χBs-specific ssDNA within 30 s, the remaining half of the χBs-specific ssDNA persisted with a half-life of ∼10-15 min (Fig. 2C). Protection of the χBs-specific fragment was not limited to this particular χBs site but was found for all three χBs sites tested (data not shown). Finally, protection of the χBs-specific fragment from Exo I degradation was observed under all conditions tested (low and high magnesium ion concentrations; data not shown). Protection was also not because of the formation of a secondary DNA structure, because Exo I could clearly degrade the full-length ssDNA from its 3′-end down to the PAS site, which is located a few hundred base pairs downstream of the χBs studied in Fig. 2B. We therefore surmised that protection from Exo I degradation might be because of the binding of a protein to the 3′-χBs-specific end generated upon attenuation of the AddAB enzyme nuclease activity at χBs. Only two proteins are present in our reactions, AddAB enzyme and SSB protein. To test whether protection could be due to binding of the AddAB enzyme to the end of the χBs-specific fragment, we performed reactions in the absence of SSB protein. As with the RecBCD enzyme, the catalytic activity of the AddAB enzyme is reduced in the absence of SSB protein (30Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2035261278,"Stat3 and its isoforms belong to a family of cytoplasmic transcription factors that affect the synthesis of various proteins. Caspases are cysteinyl-aspartate proteases that function under apoptotic and non-apoptotic conditions. We now report that, in addition to transcriptional splicing, Stat3 fragmentation can be mediated by caspases. Caspase activation in DU145 cells was achieved by staurosporine (STS) exposure, and Western analysis revealed a reduction in full-length Stat3 (fl-Stat3) expression that was caspase-mediated. This proteolytic relationship was further studied by exposing purified Stat3 protein to a mixture of active caspases under cell-free conditions. This demonstrated that caspases directly cleaved Stat3 and Stat3 cleavage was accompanied by the apparent formation of cleavage fragment(s). Stat3 cleavage fragments, reflecting multiple caspase cleavage sites, also were observed in vitro following STS exposure in DU145 cells and in HEK293T cells transfected to express Stat3 truncation mutants. The impact of cleavage on Stat3 transcriptional activity next was assessed and revealed that cleavage of fl-Stat3 was accompanied by reductions in Stat3-DNA binding, Stat3-driven reporter protein (luciferase) activity, and the expression of selected Stat3-dependent genes. Further, reduced Stat3 expression correlated with increased sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli. In concomitant experiments, reporter activity was assessed in Stat3 truncation mutant-expressing HEK293T cells and revealed that, under non-apoptotic conditions, expression of different Stat3 fragments induced differential effects on Stat3-driven luciferase activity. These findings demonstrate that fl-Stat3 undergoes proteolytic processing by caspases that reduces its expression and leads to the formation of cleavage fragments that may modulate Stat3 transcriptional activity.

It is conventionally held that, after phosphorylation, most commonly as a consequence of cytokine-receptor binding and JAK activation, STATs combine as hetero- or homo-dimers and translocate to the nucleus where they affect the synthesis of key proteins involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, including differentiation and apoptosis (1Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 6Heim M.H. J. Recept. Signal. Transduct.

Of interest, the overexpression and constitutive phosphorylation of several STAT family members, for example Stat3, have been associated with the development of a neoplastic phenotype in various cell types (8Bromberg J.F.

The variety of proteins and cellular processes impacted upon by STAT signaling reflects, in part, the diverse mechanisms that control STAT activation and deactivation. Presently, more than 40 different ligands of cytokine receptors can activate JAKs and induce STAT tyrosine phosphorylation (2Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar, 7Pfeffer L.M. Dinarello C.A. Herberman R.B. Williams B.R. Borden E.C. Bordens R. Walter M.R. Nagabhushan T.L. Trotta P.P.

Furthermore, intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinases may directly induce phosphorylation and circumvent the requirement for JAK participation in STAT activation (8Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has even challenged the conventional view that STAT phosphorylation and dimerization are necessary for gene transactivation. For example, we have reported that Stat3 acetylation and deacetylation modulates its transcriptional activity (13Yuan Z.-L. Guan Y.-J. Chatterjee D. Chin Y.E. Science. 2005; 307: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Similarly, Stark and colleagues (14Chatterjee-Kishore M. Wright K.L. Ting J.P. Stark G.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4111-4122Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 15Yang J. Chatterjee-Kishore M. Staugaitis S.M. Hguyen H. Schlessinger K. Levy D.E. Stark G.R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 939-947PubMed Google Scholar) have found that Stats 1 and 3 can induce the expression of a wide spectrum of target genes independent of their phosphorylation status or participation in dimer formation. In related studies, Azam et al. (16Azam M. Lee C. Strehlow I. Schlinder C. Immunity. 1997; 6: 691-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) presented evidence that limited proteolytic processing by serine proteases generated C-terminal truncated STAT proteins that could negatively regulate Stat3-, Stat5-, and Stat6-mediated signaling. These truncated molecules, designated STATγs, appear to function as dominant-negative regulators of transcription. In addition to processing by serine protease(s), Stats 3, 5, and 6 also are converted into their γ moieties by the calcium-dependent cysteine protease calpain (17Oda A. Wakae H. Fujita H. Blood. 2002; 99: 1850-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18Hendry L. John S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4613-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Caspases are cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteases whose activation and function traditionally have been associated with apoptosis, or programmed cell death (19Stroh C. Schulze-Osthoff K. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 997-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is carried out by two predominant cellular pathways (20Petak I. Tillman D.M. Harwood F.G. Mihalik R. Houghton J.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2643-2650PubMed Google Scholar). Intrinsic (type-2, mitochondrial-mediated) apoptosis is often induced in tumor cells in response to chemotherapy. The initiating event usually is associated with DNA damage leading to mitochondrial depolarization and the activation of caspase 9, the apical caspase in this pathway (21Zou H. Li X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar, 22Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Puthalakath H. Bouillet P. Vairo G. Moriishi K. Hausmann G. O'Reilly L.

Extrinsic (type-1, receptor-mediated) apoptosis occurs in a variety of cell types under physiological conditions and is triggered by ligand binding to specific receptors, such as CD95. This leads to “death-inducing signaling complex” formation and the activation of the apical caspases 2, 8, or 10 (20Petak I. Tillman D.M. Harwood F.G. Mihalik R. Houghton J.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2643-2650PubMed Google Scholar, 23Fulda S. Sievens H. Frieson C. Herr I. Debatin K.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3823-3829PubMed Google Scholar, 24Muller M. Strand S. Hug H.

Both pathways result in cell death associated with the activation of additional executioner caspases, such as caspase 3, and the proteolytic demolition of specific target proteins such as PARP (20Petak I. Tillman D.M. Harwood F.G. Mihalik R. Houghton J.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2643-2650PubMed Google Scholar, 22Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Puthalakath H. Bouillet P. Vairo G. Moriishi K. Hausmann G.

Relevant to the present study, Goodbourn and King reported that Stat1α is a specific target for demolition by caspase 3 in HeLa cells after induction of apoptosis following exposure to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (25King P. Goodbourn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8699-8704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). There also is a growing appreciation that certain caspases can be activated under non-apoptotic conditions. As reviewed by Schwerk and Schulze-Osthoff (26Schwerk C. Schulze-Osthoff K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 1453-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), caspase 8 activity appears to be required for normal T-cell activation and function. Similarly, Ishizaki and coworkers (27Ishizaki Y. Jacobson M.D. Raff M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), as well as others (28DeMaria R. Testa U.

Biol. 1999; 9: 361-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) have shown that caspases 3, 9, and 14 participate in cellular differentiation. Therefore, although intimately involved in apoptosis, selected caspases may be activated under non-apoptotic conditions and participate in cellular processes not associated with programmed cell death. During the course of studies to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which antineoplastic agents promote cell death, we observed that Stat3 protein levels were reduced during chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Consequently, an analysis of the relationship between Stat3 protein expression and caspase activity in human cell lines was initiated. We now report that fl-Stat3 expression was reduced in a caspase-dependent manner following the induction of apoptosis in the DU145 cell line. Experiments conducted under cell-free conditions revealed that the relationship between caspase activity and fl-Stat3 expression was direct and accompanied by the apparent formation of Stat3 cleavage fragments. Preliminary studies to map the location of Stat3 cleavage sites were carried out in HEK293T cells transfected to express defined Stat3 truncation mutants with various domain deletions and revealed that Stat3 contains multiple cleavage sites. Finally, assessment of the functional implications of these findings revealed that Stat3 cleavage and fragment expression are capable of modulating Stat3 gene transactivation under both apoptotic and non-apoptotic conditions. These findings reveal that Stat3 expression and function are directly affected by caspase activities. Cell culture media, trypsin, and FBS were purchased from Invitrogen.

The relationship between caspase activity and Stat3 expression was evaluated in the DU145 and PC3 human prostate tumor cell lines, the HeLa human cervical carcinoma cell line, and in the HEK293T human embryonic kidney cell line. All cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Selected studies were also conducted in PC3 cells stably transfected to express Stat3 (PC3/Stat3), as previously described (13Yuan Z.-L. Guan Y.-J. Chatterjee D. Chin Y.E. Science. 2005; 307: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). DU145 and PC3 cells were carried in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 media plus 10% FBS, HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% FBS, and HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% FBS. All cell lines were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2. 1 × 104 DU145, PC3, or PC3/Stat3 cells were plated into each well of a 96-well flat-bottom plate (Costar, Corning Inc.) in 100 μl of media plus serum. After 24 h, STS (0–1000 nm) (31Tamaoki T. Nomoto H. Takahashi I. Kato Y. Morimoto M. Tomita F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

At various times thereafter up to 24 h, 100 μl of a 2 mg/ml MTT solution (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) in PBS was added to each well, and the plate was processed to determine the absorbance of each well using a Bio-Tek Instruments EL800 plate reader, as previously described (35Ribizzi I. Darnowski J.W. Goulette F.A. Akhtar M.S. Chatterjee D. Calabresi P. Bone Marrow Transpl. 2002; 29: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Two × 106 cells were incubated for 24 h in medium containing serum. 24 h later, STS or 9NC were added in a volume to achieve final concentrations of 1000 nm or 40 nm, respectively. 24 h later, cells were harvested by trypsinization and resuspended in ice-cold PBS. The cells then were stained for 30 min at room temperature in the dark with a solution of 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.6% Igepal, and 0.1% sodium citrate. Flow cytometry was performed by FACScan (BD Biosciences) using the ModFit LT program (BD Biosciences). Statistical analysis was performed with the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric analysis of variance test followed by Dunn's multiple comparisons test using Instat (36Calabresi P. Goulette F.A.

After an additional 12 h (STS) or 24 h (9NC), cells were harvested and lysed (39Cousens L.C. Goulette F.A. Darnowski J.W. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Total proteins from cell lysates (60–75 μg/condition) were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS and transferred to nitrocellulose filters that were processed and probed with antibodies to detect Stat3, caspase 8, caspase 9, actin, or PARP by chemiluminescence (39Cousens L.C. Goulette F.A. Darnowski J.W. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Alternatively, HEK293T cells where transiently transfected with one of several cDNAs encoding specific c-Myc-tagged Stat3 truncation mutants. Construction of these expression vector pcDNAs was as previously described (13Yuan Z.-L. Guan Y.-J. Chatterjee D. Chin Y.E. Science. 2005; 307: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The c-Myc epitope was inserted at the 5′-end of the following Stat3 constructs: Stat3 full-length (1–770), Stat3 1–130, Stat3 1–320, Stat3 1–585, Stat3 1–720, Stat3 466–770, and Stat3 586–770. These Stat3 domain deletion constructs then were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine® (40Yuan Z.L. Guan Y.J. Wang L. Wei W. Kane A.B. Chin Y.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9390-9400Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were exposed to 1000 nm STS for 12 h, and total proteins from whole cell lysates (25 μg/condition) were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and probed with antibodies to detect tagged proteins or β-actin, as described above. Cell-free Studies—A cell-free assay was employed to assess the direct relationship between caspase activity and Stat3 protein. Stat3 was isolated and purified from DU145 cells by immunoprecipitation methods using the Seize® kit. Briefly, 2–5 × 107 cells were lysed, and Stat3 proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C. Immobilized protein then was eluted using a low pH buffer, neutralized, renatured, and concentrated in preparation for analysis or for storage at 4 °C for up to 3 days. To assess Stat3 proteolysis, purified Stat3 protein was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with a mixture of active caspases (1 through 10) and pre- and postincubation Stat3 protein levels compared by Western analysis. Parallel experiments using equivalent amounts of Stat3 protein incubated in a caspase mixture that was heat-inactivated (100 °C for 10 min) prior to use served as control. Phospho-(pY705)-Stat3 Expression—DU145 cells were exposed to STS, Z-VAD-fmk, or their combination as described above. After 12 h, cells were harvested, processed for SDS-PAGE analysis, and probed with appropriate antibodies to detect phospho-(pY705)-Stat3 protein, as described above. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—DU145, PC3, or PC3/Stat3 cells were seeded at a density of ∼7 × 106 cells/flask. On the following day all cells were exposed to IL-6 (20 ng/ml), and DU145 cells also were exposed to STS (1000 nm), Z-VAD-fmk (40 μm), or their combination. After an additional 12 h all cells were harvested, and nuclear lysates were generated by previously reported methods (41Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). Aliquots of nuclear extract (5 μg of protein in 1 μl) then were combined with 1 μg of poly[d(I-C)], 32P-labeled Stat3-DNA binding oligonucleotide probe (42Nam S. Buettner R. Turkson J. Kim D.

Samples then were incubated for 30 min at 0 °C after which the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of loading buffer. Sample proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE methods on a 6% gel and binding species were visualized by conventional autoradiography (43Rosmarin A.G. Caprio D.G. Kirsch D.G. Handa H. Simkevich C.P. J.

Stat3-DNA Binding—A standard transcription factor enrichment assay was modified to assess Stat3 dimer binding to DNA. DU145 cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 106 in 150-cm2 flasks and after 24 h exposed to STS, Z-VAD-fmk, or their combination. After 12 h, cells were harvested, and cell lysates were generated by incubation for 2 h at 4°C in 1 ml of 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. Particulate material was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant (4 mg of total protein/condition) was incubated overnight at 4 °C in 3 ml of 100 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 25 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 50% glycerol, containing 50 μg of the Stat3-DNA binding site oligonucleotide (5′-GATCCTTCTGGGAATTCCTAGATC-3′) (44Yu C.-L.

Agarose beads then were removed by centrifugation, washed, and incubated in 50 μl of Laemmli buffer for 10 min at 100 °C. Immediately after, the supernatant was removed by centrifugal elution, and the eluant was stored at –20 °C for subsequent Western analysis of Stat3 content. Luciferase Reporter Assay—DU145 cells (5 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) were transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of a luciferase plasmid containing the consensus DNA Stat3 binding sequence for the SIE fragment (44Yu C.-L.

Guan Y.-J. Chatterjee D. Chin Y.E. Science. 2005; 307: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). After 4 h the media was replaced with 2 ml of Opti-MEM plus 20% FBS and then replaced 24 h later with 2 ml of RPMI plus 10% FBS containing IL-6 (20 ng/ml) and STS, Z-VAD-fmk, or their combination. Six hours later cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and lysed in 300 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was evaluated using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega). Alternatively, HEK293T cells (5 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of a luciferase plasmid containing the consensus DNA-Stat3 binding sequence and with one of several cDNAs encoding c-Myc-tagged Stat3 truncation mutants, as described above. After 12 h the media was removed and replaced with 2 ml of Opti-MEM plus 20% FBS for 42 h after which the media was replaced with 2 ml of RPMI 1640 plus 10% FBS alone or containing either OSM (50 μg/ml) or IL-6 (20 ng/ml). After an additional 6 h, luciferase activity was evaluated as described above. Expression of Selected Stat3 Target Genes—DU145-, PC3-, or Stat3-expressing PC3 cells were exposed to IL-6 (20 ng/ml). DU145 cells also were exposed to STS (1000 nm), as previously described. After 12 h, cells were harvested, processed for SDS-PAGE analysis, and probed with appropriate antibodies to assess the expression of fl-Stat3, c-Myc, FasL, TRAIL, and BclXL, as described above. This study assessed the relationship between caspase activity and Stat3 expression. For in vitro experiments STS was used to activate caspases, because it consistently induces caspase-mediated apoptosis in a variety of cell models (31Tamaoki T. Nomoto H. Takahashi I. Kato Y. Morimoto M. Tomita F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar, 32Matsumoto H. Sasaki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Neurochem. 1991; 56: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To confirm STS-induced caspase activation in our model, DU145 cells first were exposed to STS alone (0–1000 nm) for 12 h after which PARP cleavage was assessed (38Darnowski J.W. Goulette F.A. Cousens L.P. Chatterjee D. Calabresi P. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2004; 54: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 45Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C.

Dritschilo A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3496-3498Google Scholar). In Fig. 1A it is clear that STS efficiently induced apoptosis as evidenced by robust concentration-dependent PARP cleavage and induction of cytotoxicity. Under these conditions an STS-dependent reduction in Stat3 expression also is evident. A parallel study assessed the temporal effect of STS exposure on these parameters. For this experiment, DU145 cells were exposed to 1000 nm STS, and cell lysates were acquired every 90 min for 12 h. This experiment revealed that caspase 8 and caspase 9 activation and PARP cleavage were evident within 3 h of STS exposure and, again, correlated with the cytotoxicity (Fig. 1B). Assessment of Stat3 expression under these conditions revealed that caspase activation preceded the obvious reduction in Stat3 expression and suggested that the reduction in Stat3 expression was caspase-mediated. To further define this relationship DU145 cells were exposed to STS alone, the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk alone (40 μm), or STS plus Z-VAD-fmk for 12 h after which Stat3 expression again was assessed. STS exposure again induced a dramatic reduction in Stat3 expression while exposure to STS plus Z-VAD-fmk preserved Stat3 expression (Fig. 2A), thus supporting the notion that this effect was caspase-mediated in these cells. To assess the generality of this effect, parallel experiments were carried out in the HeLa cells. This model was selected for comparison, because Goodbourn and King reported that, in these cells, Stat1α was directly demolished by caspase 3 following dsRNA-induced apoptosis (25King P. Goodbourn S.

Loss of plakophilin-1 is the underlying cause of ectodermal dysplasia/skin fragility syndrome, and skin from these patients exhibits desmosomes that are reduced in size and number. Thus, it has been suggested that plakophilin-1 plays an important role in desmosome stability and/or assembly. In this study, we used a cell culture system (A431DE cells) that expresses all of the proteins necessary to assemble a desmosome, except plakophilin-1. Using this cell line, we sought to determine the role of plakophilin-1 in de novo desmosome assembly. When exogenous plakophilin-1 was expressed in these cells, desmosomes were assembled, as assessed by electron microscopy and immunofluorescence localization of desmoplakin, into punctate structures. Deletion mutagenesis experiments revealed that amino acids 686–726 in the carboxyl terminus of plakophilin-1 are required for its localization to the plasma membrane. In addition, we showed that amino acids 1–34 in the amino terminus were necessary for subsequent recruitment of desmoplakin to the membrane and desmosome assembly.

Desmosomes are prominent cell-cell adhesive junctions found in a variety of epithelial tissues. Desmosomes are disc-shaped junctions that link the intermediate filament cytoskeleton from one cell to the intermediate filament cytoskeleton of an adjacent cell. Thus, the primary role of the desmosome is to provide epithelial tissues a mechanism to resist mechanical stress (reviewed in Refs. 1Cheng X. Koch P.J. J. Dermatol. 2004; 31: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar and 2Getsios S. Huen A.C. Green K.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The transmembrane core of the desmosome is composed of the desmosomal cadherins, desmogleins, and desmocollins. A number of cytoplasmic desmosomal plaque proteins cooperate to link the desmosomal cadherins to the intermediate filament cytoskeleton. Desmoplakin and plakoglobin are desmosomal plaque proteins expressed in all desmosome-containing epithelial cells. Plakoglobin is an armadillo repeat-containing protein that interacts directly with the cytoplasmic domain of the desmosomal cadherins (3Troyanovsky S.M. Troyanovsky R.B. Eshkind L.G. Leube R.E.

Green K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and an amino-terminal head domain required for desmosome association (8Smith E.A. Fuchs E. J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In addition to desmoplakin and plakoglobin, members of the plakophilin family (PKP1–3) are also present in the desmosomal plaque (10Hatzfeld M. Kristjansson G.I. Plessmann U. Weber K. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2259-2270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Schmidt A. Heid H.W. Schafer S. Nuber U.A. Zimbelmann R. Franke W.W. Eur. J.

However, the role of the plakophilins in desmosome assembly is not fully understood. Plakophilin-1 is expressed abundantly in the epidermis (14Moll I. Kurzen H. Langbein L. Franke W.W. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 139-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and mutations in the PKP1 gene, resulting in loss of plakophilin-1 protein expression, and are the underlying cause of ectodermal dysplasia/skin fragility (15McGrath J.A.

Ultrastructural examination of skin from these patients revealed that desmosomes are reduced in number and in size compared with normal individuals. Therefore, plakophilin-1 is thought to play a role in desmosome stability (16South A.P. Wan H. Stone M.G. Dopping-Hepenstal P.J. Purkis P.E. Marshall J.F. Leigh I.M. Eady R.A. Hart I.R. McGrath J.A.

Interestingly, these mice display a lethal phenotype due to defects in heart morphogenesis (18Grossmann K.S. Grund C. Huelsken J. Behrend M. Erdmann B. Franke W.W. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, plakophilins have been proposed to play an important role in the organization and stability of the desmosome. The desmosome is a complex cell-cell junction both in composition and in the regulation of assembly. The composition of the desmosome in stratified epithelia varies in a differentiation-specific manner. Multiple desmoglein, desmocollin, and plakophilin genes are spatiotemporally expressed during keratinocyte differentiation (14Moll I. Kurzen H. Langbein L. Franke W.W. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 139-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Arnemann J. Sullivan K.H. Magee A.I. King I.A. Buxton R.S. J.

Dermatol. 1993; 100: 373-379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, desmosome assembly is dependent upon the assembly of another cell-cell adhesive junction, the adherens junction. The adherens junction is structurally similar to a desmosome, except that the transmembrane protein is a classical cadherin, the plaque proteins are catenins, and the complex is associated with the actin cytoskeleton. It is well accepted that, in order for cells to assemble desmosomes, they must first adhere to one another via adherens junctions (21Gumbiner B. Stevenson B. Grimaldi A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1575-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 22Lewis J.E. Jensen P.J. Wheelock M.J. J. Investig.

To date, experiments to understand the role of plakophilin-1 in the desmosome have been performed primarily in cells that already assemble endogenous desmosomal structures, such as COS (24Kowalczyk A.P. Hatzfeld M. Bornslaeger E.A. Kopp D.S. Borgwardt J.E. Corcoran C.M. Settler A. Green K.J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These experiments have relied on the transient expression of full-length plakophilin-1 or fragments of plakophilin-1 and assessing their incorporation into previously assembled desmosomes. We sought to develop a cell culture system designed to examine the role of plakophilin-1 in de novo assembly of desmosomes. To accomplish this, we generated a model cell system that is plakophilin-1-null and does not assemble desmosomes (A431DE cells). Upon stable expression of plakophilin-1 in A431DE cells, desmosomes are assembled. Using this system, we showed that two distinct amino acid sequences in the amino and carboxyl termini of plakophilin-1 are required for desmosome assembly and plasma membrane localization, respectively. Cell Culture—A431D cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HycClone Laboratories, Logan, UT). A431D cells expressing E-cadherin 2× Myc (A431DE cells) have been described previously (5Wahl J.K. Sacco P.A. McGranahan-Sadler T.M. Sauppe L.M. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. J.

Generation of cDNA Constructs—A plakophilin-1a cDNA was generated by reverse transcription-PCR from human keratinocyte total RNA using the upstream primer 5′-TAGAATTCTCTCCTAGGCCCCGGCC-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-CTAAGCTTTAACTTGCTTGG-3′. The resulting PCR product was subcloned into pUC19 and sequenced to verify that the cDNA encodes wild-type plakophilin-1a (GenBank™ accession number Z73678). To produce a plakophilin-1-encoding retrovirus, plakophilin-1 cDNA was digested with EcoRI and HindIII (filled in using Klenow enzyme) and ligated to LZRS-MS-neo (29Ireton R.C. Davis M.A. van Hengel J. Mariner D.J. Barnes K. Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Matrisian L. Bundy L.M. Sealy L. Gilbert B. van Roy F. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) digested with EcoRI and AfeI. To generate plakophilin-1 amino-terminal deletion mutants, PCR was used to introduce a start codon upstream of the nucleotides encoding amino acids 35 and 56, respectively (5′-TCGAATTCCACCATGACGTCTGGCAGGCAGCG-3′ and 5′-TCGAATTCCACCATGTCTTCCCAGTCGTCCAAA-3′ and a downstream primer spanning a unique BglII site 5′-CCTCACTGCAGATCTTGGAGC-3′). To generate plakophilin-1 C40 and plakophilin-1 C10, PCR was used to introduce a stop codon following amino acids 715 and 686 (5′-ATAAGCTTAGGCCCCAGCTAAGGTTCC-3′ and 5′-ATAAGCTTAGAGAAGCCGGGCAGC-3′ and a 5′ primer just upstream of a unique BspEI site 5′-TGGCAACTCTGATGTGGTG-3′).

All PCR fragments were sequenced to verify that the intended changes were incorporated and that no errors were introduced during PCR amplification. All plakophilin-1 constructs were ligated to LZRS-MS-neo, and a retrovirus was produced. To generate GST 2The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. fusion proteins, plakophilin-1 cDNAs encoding amino acids 1–235 (head domain), 35–235 (N34 head domain), 1–22:28–235 (ΔLALPS), and 235–726 (arm repeat domain) were PCR-amplified and ligated to pGST parallel (30Sheffield P. Garrard S. Derewenda Z. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Retrovirus Production and Infection—Retrovirus production and infection were performed essentially as described by Ireton et al. (29Ireton R.C. Davis M.A. van Hengel J. Mariner D.J. Barnes K. Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Matrisian L. Bundy L.M. Sealy L. Gilbert B. van Roy F. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Briefly, phoenix cells (5 × 105/100-mm dish) were transfected with constructs prepared in the LZRS-MS-neo vector using calcium phosphate (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Forty-eight hours following transfection, the cells were switched to medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) to select for virus-producing cells. A population of puromycin-resistant cells was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum lacking puromycin and grown at 32 °C for 24 h for virus production. Virus-conditioned medium was collected and passed through a 0.45-μm syringe filter and polybrene (Sigma) was added to 4 μg/ml. For infection of target cells, 2 × 105 cells were plated in 1 well of a 6-well dish 18 h prior to infection. Fresh virus-conditioned medium was incubated with target cells for 6 h at 32 °C. Following infection, the medium was replaced with fresh medium, and the cells were returned to 37 °C. Two days after infection, a selective medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 was added, and a population of cells expressing the desired protein product was isolated. Detergent Extraction of Cells and Immunoblot Analysis—For total cell lysates, cells in T25 flasks were grown to confluence, rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and extracted in 1 ml of Empigen BB extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1% Empigen BB (Calbiochem), 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 30 mm sodium fluoride, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were placed on ice, scraped, and triturated vigorously for 2 min. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used immediately or stored at –70 °C. The protein concentration was determined using DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred overnight to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 45 min. Blocking solution was removed by washing for 15 min followed by washing twice for 5 min each time in TBST. For the immunoblots, hybridoma-conditioned medium was used at 1:100 dilution in TBST for 1 h. Membranes were washed 15 min followed by washing twice for 5 min each time in TBST. Membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) at 1:10,000 for 1 h. Secondary antibody was removed by washing 15 min followed by washing four times for 5 min each time in TBST. Immunoreactive bands were detected using Super Signal Pico substrate (Pierce). Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies specific for the amino terminus of plakophilin-1 (14B11) and the carboxyl terminus of desmoplakin (20B6) were generated as previously described (31Johnson K.R.

Hybridomics. 2002; 21: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) using recombinant fusion proteins as antigens. The desmoplakin fusion protein was a gift from Dr. Kathleen Green (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). The epitope for 14B11 has subsequently been mapped to plakophilin-1 amino acids 56–103, and the epitope for 20B6 has been mapped to amino acids 2344–2822 of desmoplakin (GenBank™ accession number NP_004406) (data not shown). Anti-desmoglein 2 (6D8), anti-desmocollin 2 (7G6), and anti-plakoglobin (11E4) have been described previously (5Wahl J.K. Sacco P.A. McGranahan-Sadler T.M. Sauppe L.M. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. J.

Mouse anti-desmoplakin multiepitope mixture, anti-plakophilin-2, and anti-plakophilin-3 antibodies were purchased from Research Diagnostics, Inc. (Flanders, NJ). Mouse anti-E-cadherin (HECD-1) was purchased from Zymed Laboratories (San Francisco, CA). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown on glass coverslips were washed briefly in Hepes-buffered Hanks' balanced salts solution (HHBSS) and fixed using 1% paraformaldehyde in 1× HHBSS. Cells were rinsed briefly in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and blocked in PBS containing 10% heat-inactivated goat serum (Sigma) and 0.2% Triton X-100 (Fisher). Cells were incubated in primary antibody for 1 h, and primary antibody was removed by washing once in blocking solution and three times in PBS. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) were diluted (1:100) in blocking buffer and added to cells for 1 h. Excess secondary antibody was removed by washing once in blocking solution and three times in PBS. Coverslips were briefly washed in distilled water and mounted using vectashield mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were collected on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with an ORCA-ER (Hamamatsu) digital camera. Images were collected and processed using OpenLab software from Improvision, Inc. (Boston, MA). Calcium Switch Experiment—2 × 105 cells were grown on glass coverslips in a 6-well dish for 24 h, and the medium was replaced with calcium-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories). 18 h later, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1.8 mm calcium) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, and cells were processed for immunofluorescence for the indicated times in calcium-containing medium. Electron Microscopy—Electron microscopy was performed at The University of Nebraska Medical Center electron microscopy core facility. Cells were grown on Thermanox plastic coverslips, fixed using 1% glutaraldehyde, and processed for electron microscopy as described in Ref. 33Green K.J. Stappenbeck T.S. Noguchi S. Oyasu R.

In Vitro Binding Assays—Recombinant GST fusion proteins were generated in Escherichia coli strain JM109 (Promega, Madison, WI), and crude lysates were prepared by sonication in lysis buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, 30 mm NaCl, 0.25% Tween 20, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 45 min. 500 μl of crude lysate was mixed with 50 μl of glutathione-agarose (Sigma) for 15 min at 4 °C, and unbound proteins were removed by washing three times with DOC washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS). Bound GST fusion proteins were incubated with ∼1 mg of A431 cell lysate prepared in TNE extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA) for 30 min at 4 °C. Unbound proteins were removed by washing five times with DOC buffer, the final pellet was resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—Protein-protein interactions were tested using the Matchmaker 3 system from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Plakophilin-1 bait constructs were subcloned into pGBKT7 to create Gal4 DNA binding domain fusion proteins, and desmoplakin was subcloned into pGADT7 to create a prey plasmid encoding desmoplakin amino acids 1–584 fused to the Gal4 activation domain. Two-hybrid assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Generation of A431DE Cells Expressing Plakophilin-1—Because our goal was to investigate the role of plakophilin-1 in desmosome assembly, it was necessary to generate a model cell system that expressed all of the necessary desmosomal components (except for plakophilin-1) and did not assemble desmosomes. Thus, we turned to the plakophilin-1-negative A431D cell line previously developed in our laboratory (27Lewis J.E. Wahl J.K. III Sass Jensen K.M. Johnson P.J. Wheelock K. R.M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 919-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). A431D cells are a derivative of the A431 cervical squamous cell carcinoma cell line, which has lost expression of the classical E- and P-cadherins. As a result, A431D cells lack the ability to form adherens junctions and do not aggregate. Interestingly, A431D cells retain expression of the desmosomal cadherins (desmoglein 2 and desmocollin 2), plakoglobin, a small amount of plakophilin-2, and desmoplakin; however, they do not assemble desmosomes (27Lewis J.E. Wahl J.K. III Sass Jensen K.M. Johnson P.J. Wheelock K. R.M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 919-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). A431D, similar to the parental A431 cells, do not express endogenous plakophilin-1. It is widely believed that cells must interact with one another via the classical cadherin containing adherens junction to assemble a desmosome (22Lewis J.E. Jensen P.J. Wheelock M.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 870-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 23Amagai M. Fujimori T. Masunaga T. Shimizu H. Nishikawa T. Shimizu N. Takeichi M. Hashimoto T. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 27-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, we generated stable clones of A431D cells transfected with a 2× Myc epitope-tagged E-cadherin cDNA construct (A431DE cells). The A431DE clones were then screened by immunofluorescence for desmoplakin expression, because it was noted that the parental A431D cell population was heterogeneous for desmoplakin expression (data not shown). Multiple clones of A431DE cells were identified that expressed relatively high levels of desmoplakin. These cells were then retrovirally infected with a cDNA encoding full-length plakophilin-1, and stable populations of plakophilin-1-expressing A431DE cells (A431DE/pkp1) were isolated. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed to verify the expression and proper subcellular localization of E-cadherin, plakophilin-1, desmoplakin, and desmoglein 2 in these cells. As expected, parental A431D cells did not express endogenous E-cadherin or plakophilin-1 (Fig. 1, A and D). When we expressed E-cadherin in A431D cells (A431DE cells), it was localized to the plasma membrane as expected (Fig. 1B). In addition, we also observed intracellular E-cadherin staining in A431DE cells. We suspect that this intracellular E-cadherin is a newly synthesized protein that is in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex and is in the process of being transported to the plasma membrane (data not shown). To support this hypothesis, we also observed a small amount of unprocessed E-cadherin that migrated slightly slower than expected in immunoblots (see Fig. 3, arrow). Plakophilin-1 expression was not restored upon E-cadherin expression (Fig. 1 E). When we expressed plakophilin-1 in A431DE cells (A431DE/pkp1 cells), it was homogeneously expressed and was localized in the nucleus and cell borders as previously reported (26Hatzfeld M. Haffner C. Schulze K. Vinzens U. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 35Klymkowsky M.W. Microsc. Res.

Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 481-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1F). Although plakophilin-1 was readily detectable at sites of cell-cell contact (Fig. 1F, arrows), the majority was localized to the nucleus. This subcellular localization is similar to the subcellular localization of endogenous plakophilin-1 in HaCat cells (26Hatzfeld M. Haffner C. Schulze K. Vinzens U. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) or primary keratinocytes (data not shown). The intense nuclear signal of plakophilin-1 in infected cells frequently obscured the plakophilin-1 signal at the cell-cell border. Therefore, images were captured that allowed visualization of the plasma membrane-associated protein, and as a consequence, the nuclear signal was often over exposed. The nuclear function of plakophilin-1 is unknown and was not further pursued in this study. Rather, we focused on the role of plakophilin-1 in the desmosome.FIGURE 3Immunoblot analysis of desmosomal components in A431DE cells expressing plakophilin-1. Empigen BB cell lysates were prepared from A431D (lane 1), A431DE (lane 2), and A431DE/pkp1 cells (lane 3). Equal protein from each lysate was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted using antibodies specific for E-cadherin, plakophilin-1, plakophilin-2, desmoplakin, plakoglobin, desmoglein 2, and desmocollin 2.

In parental A431D and A431DE cells, both desmoplakin (Fig. 1, G and H) and desmoglein 2 (Fig. 1, J and K) were diffusely localized in the cytosol (desmoplakin) or on the cell surface (desmoglein) and did not assemble into characteristic punctate structures that are indicative of desmosomes. However, A431DE/pkp1 cells recruited desmoplakin (Fig. 1I) and desmoglein 2 (Fig. 1L) to areas of cell-cell contact. The staining pattern obtained with these desmosomal components was punctate and resembled the staining pattern expected in cells that assemble desmosomes. To rule out the possibility that desmosome assembly was unique to a single clone of A431DE cells, multiple clones of A431DE cells were retrovirally infected to overexpress plakophilin-1. Each clone effectively assembled desmosomes (data not shown). In addition to immunofluorescence microscopy, we used electron microscopy to analyze desmosomes in A431DE/pkp1 cells. The desmosomal structures in these cells were indistinguishable from desmosomes in A431 cells, which make numerous endogenous desmosomes (Fig. 2) (37Palka H.L. Green K.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2359-2371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is clear that forced expression of plakophilin-1 in A431DE cells allowed these cells to assemble functional, fully formed desmosomes. Immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates prepared from A431D, A431DE, and A431DE/pkp1 cells revealed that expression of the desmosomal components plakophilin-2, plakoglobin, desmoglein 2, and desmoplakin was not changed by forced expression of E-cadherin or plakophilin-1 (Fig. 3). The expression of desmocollin 2 was slightly increased following E-cadherin expression and further increased in response to plakophilin-1 expression, which may be due to stabilization of desmocollin 2 upon desmosome assembly. Thus, the A431D cells provide a unique system to investigate the role of plakophilin-1 in desmosome assembly. To more closely examine the sequence of desmosome assembly in A431DE/pkp-1 cells, we performed a calcium switch experiment. A431DE/pkp-1 cells were grown in low calcium-containing medium overnight, and calcium was added to the cultures for the indicated times (Fig. 4). Plakophilin-1 and desmoplakin immunostaining of cells grown in low calcium was diffuse and remained diffuse after 5 min of calcium addition (Fig. 4, A and B). As soon as 10 min following the calcium addition, plakophilin-1 began to appear at sites of cell-cell contact (Fig. 4C), whereas de"

Abundant amounts of EutT protein were produced, but all of it remained insoluble. Soluble active EutT protein (∼70% homogeneous) was obtained after treatment with detergent. Under conditions in which cobalamin (Cbl) was saturating, Km(ATP) = 10 μm, kcat = 0.03 s–1, and Vmax = 54.5 nm min–1.

Unlike other ATP:co(I)rrinoid adenosyltransferases in the cell (i.e. CobA and PduO), EutT activity was ≥50-fold higher with ATP versus GTP, and EutT retained 80% of its activity with ADP substituted for ATP and was completely inactive with AMP as substrate, indicating that the enzyme requires the β-phosphate group of the nucleotide substrate. The data suggest that the amino group of adenine might play a role in nucleotide recognition and/or binding. Unlike the housekeeping CobA enzyme, EutT was not inhibited by inorganic tripolyphosphate (PPPi). Results from 31P NMR spectroscopy studies identified PPi and Pi as by-products of the EutT reaction. In the absence of Cbl, EutT cleaved ATP into adenosine and PPPi, suggesting that PPPi is broken down into PPi and Pi. Electron transfer protein partners for EutT were not encoded by the eut operon.

In the enterobacterium Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 (hereafter S. enterica), there are three different classes of ATP:co(I)rrinoid adenosyltransferases. The housekeeping ATP:co(I)rrinoid adenosyltransferase of this bacterium is encoded by the cobA gene, which is constitutively expressed (1Suh S.-J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J.

Identification of eutT as the gene encoding the ATP:co(I)rrinoid adenosyltransferase of the operon was reported recently (3Buan N.R. Suh S.-J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J.

There are many open questions regarding PduO and EutT function. As mentioned above, we do not know the identity of the electron donor that generates the cob(I)alamin nucleophile needed for formation of the Co–C bond, nor do we understand how PduO and EutT bind ATP or their corrinoid substrates. To better understand the molecular details of how the EutT enzyme works, we purified the protein and began the biochemical characterization of its enzyme activity. Strains were grown overnight in 2 ml of lysogenic broth (19Bertani G. J. Bacteriol. 1951; 62: 293-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bertani G. J.

The NdeI/XhoI fragment containing the native stop codon was cloned into pTYB2 (New England Biolabs Inc.) to yield plasmid pEUT12 for overproduction of wild-type EutT in Escherichia coli. Plasmids pEUT25–27—Plasmids pEUT25–27 encode EutT variants that were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmid pEUT12 was used as template. Mutations in plasmids pEUT25–27 were verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmids pEUT35–37—To avoid indirect effects by unknown mutations introduced into the cloning vector, the mutant alleles were moved from pEUT25–27 into a non-mutagenized cloning vector and placed under the control of a tunable promoter. For this purpose, primers shown in supplemental Table 1s (see plasmids pEUT35–37) were used to amplify the mutant eutT alleles from their respective pTYB2 plasmids (pEUT25–27). Amplification products were cut with EcoRI and XbaI restriction enzymes and placed under the control of the arabinose-inducible ParaBAD promoter in plasmid pBAD24 (23Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3876) Google Scholar) cut with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmids were named pEUT36 (eutT1168, EutT(C79A)), pEUT37 (eutT1169, EutT(C80A)), and pEUT38 (eutT1170, EutT(C83A)). These plasmids were used in in vivo studies aimed at determining the functionality of the proteins encoded by the mutant eutT alleles. For this purpose, plasmids were transformed (24Ryu J.-I. Hartin R.J. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 43-45PubMed Google Scholar) into strain JE7180 (metE205 ara-9 cobA366::Tn10d(cat+) eutE18::MudI1734(kan+)). Growth of the resulting strains was assessed as described above. Plasmids pEUT55–58—Wild-type chromosomal alleles of eutP, eutQ, eutT, and combinations of them were constructed by PCR amplification using the primers shown in supplemental Table 1s. Amplification products were cloned under the control of the ParaBAD promoter in vector pBAD24 using the appropriate restriction sites. Plasmid pFDX1—The S. enterica ferredoxin gene (fdx+) was amplified, and the PCR fragment was cut with NdeI and BamHI restriction enzymes and cloned into plasmid pET-16b (Novagen), yielding plasmid pFDX1, which encodes ferredoxin with a hexahistidine tag fused to its N terminus. DNA Sequencing—All plasmids were sequenced using BigDye® protocols (ABI PRISM) at the DNA Sequencing Facility of the Biotech Center at the University of Wisconsin (Madison, WI). A transformant of E. coli BL21(λDE3) carrying the appropriate eutT+ plasmid was used to inoculate two sterile culture tubes (16 × 150 mm) containing 5 ml of lysogenic broth plus ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and grown overnight at 37 °C. The next morning, the 10-ml starter culture was added to 500 ml of lysogenic broth plus ampicillin, trace minerals, cysteine (0.5 mm), and methionine (0.5 mm) in a 2-liter Erlenmeyer flask. The culture was shaken at 140 rpm for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 0.5 mm, and the temperature was dropped to 15 °C for overnight incubation. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7354 × g in a Beckman Coulter Avanti J-25I centrifuge fitted with an LA-16.250 rotor at 4 °C for 10 min. Cell paste was transferred to a 50-ml serum vial, flushed with O2-free N2 on ice for 10 min, and frozen at –80 °C under 100 kilopascals of pressure until used. Cells were broken under anoxic conditions. For this purpose, frozen cell paste was transferred to an anoxic chamber and resuspended in 10 ml of anoxic lysis buffer (1× BugBuster™ reagent (Novagen), 20 mm glycine, and 20 mm CHES buffer (pH 9.5) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell suspension was incubated at room temperature for 20 min with intermittent agitation (approximately every 5 min). The lysate was moved into a stainless steel centrifuge tube fitted with an expandable O-ring cap and centrifuged at 43,667 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman Coulter Avanti J-25I centrifuge fitted with a JA-25.50 rotor. The centrifuged lysate was moved back to the anoxic chamber, where the supernatant was decanted. Pelleted cell membranes and insoluble material were resuspended in 10 ml of anoxic solution containing 8 mm CHAPS in 20 mm glycine and 20 mm CHES buffer (pH 9.5). Repeated pipetting ensured homogeneous resuspension of the pellet, which was then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with gentle agitation every 10 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 43,667 × g for 1 h at 4 °C in stainless steel tubes fitted with sealable caps. The tubes were transferred back into the anoxic chamber, where the soluble material was decanted; 200-μl samples were dispensed into glass serum vials fitted with gray butyl rubber stoppers; and aluminum seals were crimped in place. Sealed vials were removed from the chamber, pressurized with N2 (100 kilopascals), and kept at 4 °C until used. Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) using the FOTO/Eclipse® electronic documentation and analysis system (FOTODYNE Inc.), including the software packages FOTO/Analyst® PC Image (Version 5.0) and TotalLab™ (Version 2003; Nonlinear Dynamics Ltd.) for one-dimensional gel analysis. Fpr and FldA proteins were overproduced and isolated as reported previously (12Fonseca M.V. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol.

Fresh E. coli BL21(λDE3) (JE3892)/pFDX1 transformants were grown in two 10-ml lysogenic broth cultures containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and incubated overnight at 37 °C with shaking. Each 10-ml starter culture was used to inoculate 2 liters of Terrific Broth supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml ferrous ammonium sulfate and 100 μg/ml ampicillin (27Kakuta Y. Horio T. Takahashi Y. Fukuyama K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11007-11012Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); inoculated flasks were incubated at 37 °C for 15 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g at 4 °C in a Beckman Coulter Avanti J-20XPI centrifuge fitted with a JLA-8.1000 rotor, and the cell paste was stored at –80 °C until used. The cell paste was resuspended in 20 mm potassium Pi buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 m NaCl and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, passed through a French pressure cell twice at 1250 kilopascals, and treated with DNase for 10 min on ice. Cell-free extracts were centrifuged at 43,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman Coulter Avanti J-25I centrifuge fitted with a JA-25.50 rotor and then passed through a 0.2-μm syringe filter to remove residual particulate material. N-terminally His6-tagged ferredoxin protein was purified on an ΔKTA FPLC Explorer using a 5-ml HiTrap chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) charged with NiSO4. Fractions containing pure protein were pooled, concentrated in an Amicon Centricon YM10 unit (cutoff of 10 kDa), dialyzed against 20 mm potassium Pi buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.2 m NaCl, and concentrated again in an Amicon Microcon YM10 unit. Total yield was ∼1 mg of EutT protein/10 g of cell paste. S. enterica strains were grown in no-carbon E medium containing trace minerals elixir, MgSO4, NH4Cl, and methionine at concentrations indicated above. In addition, 1 μm HOCbl (or AdoCbl as indicated), 200 μm l-(+)-arabinose as inducer, and 50 mm ethanolamine (pH 7) or 30 mm glycerol were added. Cells in stationary phase were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, transferred to a 50-ml serum vial, and flushed with anoxic N2 gas. Cells were broken at room temperature after resuspension in anoxic lysis buffer. The cell suspension was kept at room temperature for 30 min with intermittent agitation. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell-free extracts were used immediately for corrinoid adenosylation assays. Quartz cuvettes fitted with removable silicon rubber septa (Starna Cells, Inc.) were flushed with O2-free N2 and filled with degassed buffer containing 0.2 m Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7) at 37 °C. The concentration of HOCbl ranged between 0.5 and 50 μm; MnCl2 was present at 0.5 mm. Ti(III) citrate (2.2 mm) was used to reduce the corrin from Co3+ to Co+; ATP was added (0.5 μm to 1 mm); and 0.5 μm purified CHAPS-EutT protein or 50 μg of cell-free extract was used per reaction. CHAPS-EutT protein was warmed to room temperature prior to its addition to the reaction mixture. A temperature shift to 37 °C was used to start the reaction, the rate of which was monitored by the decrease in the abundance of cob(I)alamin substrate at 388 nm. When FldA or Fdx was used as the reductant, Ti(III) citrate was replaced with 2 μm Fpr protein, 0.5 mm NADPH, and 1 μm purified N-terminally His6-tagged ferredoxin or C-terminally His6-tagged flavodoxin A protein. In assays in which cell-free extract was used in lieu of purified CHAPS-EutT protein, 50 μm FMN, 1 mm NADH, and 1 mm ATP were used in place of Ti(III) citrate. Corrinoid adenosylation was assessed by the change in absorbance at 525 nm of the sample after 30 min of incubation at 37 °C and after photolysis for 10 min on ice. A 10-ml corrinoid adenosylation reaction mixture containing 3 mm Ti(III) citrate, 100 μm ATP, 100 μm HOCbl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 16 μm EutT in 0.2 m Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7) at 37 °C was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After incubation, EDTA was added to 20 mm; reactions were concentrated overnight at room temperature under vacuum to 0.5 ml in an SPD111V SpeedVac® concentrator (Thermo Savant); and 100% D2O was added to a final concentration of 6% (v/v). Standards were added to 100 μm as indicated. 31P NMR spectra were acquired at the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Facility of the University of Wisconsin (Madison). All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless indicated otherwise and were of high purity. Ti(III) citrate was prepared from liquid TiCl3. Briefly, 0.2 m citrate was adjusted to pH 8. The citrate solution was degassed with O2-free N2 in a sealed glass serum vial for 20 min. TiCl3 was added with a glass syringe to the serum vial with a pressurized O2-free N2 headspace. The final Ti(III) citrate concentration was 88 mm. Recombinant EutT protein was overproduced in E. coli, but remained insoluble unless cells containing EutT protein were lysed under anoxic conditions using CHES/glycine buffer (pH 9.5), followed by resuspension of EutT from the pelleted material with 8 mm CHAPS and a final centrifugation step. After these purification steps, EutT was substantially enriched (∼70% homogeneous) (Fig. 2). However, EutT could not be resolved from contaminating proteins by column chromatography. All biochemical assays were performed using CHAPS-solubilized EutT. EutT activity were erratic when KBH4 was used as reductant to convert cob(III)alamin to cob(I)alamin in vitro. To circumvent this problem, Ti(III) citrate was used as reductant in all Cbl adenosylation assays. The highest EutT activity was measured at pH 7 (specific activity of 34 nmol of AdoCbl min–1 mg–1 of protein) and was <30% active at higher pH (e.g. at pH 7.5, specific activity of 9.7 nmol of AdoCbl min–1 mg–1; at pH 8, specific activity of 7.3; and at pH 8.5, specific activity of 7.3). Several metals were tested for their ability to stimulate EutT activity (i.e. Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Na+, and K+). Only Mn2+ ions stimulated EutT enzyme activity (by 32%) above the no-metal control (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, Ni2+ and Zn2+ ions inhibited EutT activity by 62 and 77%, respectively. Fifty percent inhibition was the maximum level measured when the ratio of Ni2+ ion to EutT monomer was 100:1 (at 100 μm Ni2+)] (Fig. 3B). The shape of the inhibition curve suggested single-site binding. EutT has a putative HX7HX3CCX2C motif that resembles the cytochrome oxidase CCX2C dicopper-binding site or a 4Fe/4S cluster that was recently identified in the Bacillus megaterium CbiX protein (Fig. 4) (28Brindley A.A. Raux E. Leech H.K. Schubert H.L. Warren M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22388-22395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This cysteine-rich motif of EutT was targeted for site-directed mutagenesis to determine whether Cys79, Cys80, and Cys83 are important for structural integrity, enzyme catalysis, or both. Residues were mutated to Ala, and the resulting enzymes were tested for their ability to function in vivo and in vitro. None of the alleles coding for EutT(C79A), EutT(C80A), or EutT(C83A) complemented the S. enterica cobA eutT strain (JE7180) during growth on ethanolamine (data not shown). Variant proteins were overproduced and purified using the protocol used for wild-type EutT protein, and their adenosyltransferase activity was assayed in vitro (Table 2). EutT(C79A) was the most active of the three variants tested, with 20% of the wild-type activity detected in the detergent-soluble fraction. In contrast, EutT(C80A) and EutT(C83A) retained very little activity (0.6 and 1.2%, respectively). Mutant EutT proteins were found predominantly in the detergent-insoluble pellet, likely misfolded and aggregated (Table 2). We propose that Cys79 might be more important for structural integrity than Cys80 and Cys83. Nucleotide Substrate—Under conditions in which Cbl was saturating, the Km and kcat for ATP were measured at 10 μm and 0.03 s–1, respectively (Fig. 5A); the Vmax was calculated at 54.5 nm min–1. Order-of-addition experiments revealed a modest increase in the specific activity of the enzyme (17%) when it was incubated with ATP first (specific activity of 42 versus 36 nmol of AdoCbl min–1 mg–1 of protein). Recognition of NTPs by EutT was unlike that by CobA or PduO (2Johnson C.L. Pechonick E. Park S.D. Havemann G.D. Leal N.A. Bobik T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1577-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 10Fonseca M.V. Buan N.R. Horswill A.R. Rayment I. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33127-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, ATP was the preferred nucleotide substrate (Fig. 6A), but there were several differences between CobA and EutT in terms of the nucleotide substrate each enzyme could use. EutT retained reasonable activity (31%) when dATP was the substrate, whereas CobA did not use dATP as substrate at all. EutT retained 38% activity when CTP was used as substrate, whereas CobA used CTP 1.5-fold better than ATP. EutT activity was poor (<10%) with GTP, UTP, and ITP, whereas CobA used them 45, 125, and 85% as effectively as ATP (10Fonseca M.V. Buan N.R. Horswill A.R. Rayment I. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33127-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The sharpest difference between CobA and EutT was the ability of the latter to use ADP as substrate, retaining 83% of its activity relative to ATP. CobA did use ADP as substrate.FIGURE 6NTP substrate analogs and phosphate product inhibition of EutT. A, NTPs (0.5 mm) were tested in lieu of ATP. B, PPPi, PPi, or Pi was added to 10-fold the amount of ATP present in the reaction to assess product inhibition. For ATP, the specific activity was 61 nmol min–1 mg–1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Corrinoid Substrate—We also determined the kinetic parameters of EutT for Cbl under conditions in which MgATP was saturating. Under such conditions, Km = 4.1 μm, kcat = 0.06 s–1, and Vmax = 105 nm min–1 (Fig. 5B). In vitro, EutT adenosylated cobinamide, an incomplete corrinoid lacking the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole lower ligand. When cobinamide was used as substrate, the specific activity of the enzyme (13 nmol of adenosylcobinamide min–1 mg–1 of protein) was 21% of the that measured when Cbl was the substrate (specific activity of 62 nmol of AdoCbl min–1 mg–1 of protein), suggesting a role for the nucleotide loop in substrate binding. Despite its in vitro activity, a mutant cobA strain (JE7172) (Table 1) expressing the eutT+ allele from a plasmid failed to grow on ethanolamine or glycerol as sole carbon source when cobinamide was provided in the medium. Clearly, the rate of cobinamide adenosylation measured in vitro was not enough to satisfy even the lowest cellular requirement for Cbl, i.e. the level needed for methylation of homocysteine to methionine by Cbl-dependent methionine synthase (MetH). EutT Cleaves Inorganic Tripolyphosphate (PPPi) into PPi and Pi—To date, corrinoid adenosyltransferases (10Fonseca M.V. Buan N.R. Horswill A.R. Rayment I. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1980; 255: 9082-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are the only enzymes known to release PPPi as a reaction by-product without cleaving it to PPi and Pi. CobA is strongly inhibited by PPPi (10Fonseca M.V. Buan N.R. Horswill A.R. Rayment I. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33127-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and PduO is not (2Johnson C.L. Pechonick E. Park S.D. Havemann G.D. Leal N.A. Bobik T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1577-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). EutT was slightly inhibited by PPPi (15%) and PPi (20%) when each compound was present at 10-fold the concentration of ATP in the reaction mixture. Pi did not inhibit EutT activity (Fig. 6B). Because PPPi only slightly inhibited EutT, we investigated whether EutT cleaves PPPi. For this purpose, we used 31P NMR spectroscopy to determine whether PPPi, PPi, and Pi are stable reaction by-products. NMR data showed that, whereas ATP and PPPi were present in the complete reaction (Fig. 7B), PPi and Pi peaks were enhanced. When Cbl was omitted from the reaction mixture, only PPPi signals were observed (Fig. 7A). Therefore, unlike CobA and PduO, EutT cleaved PPPi to PPi and Pi and cleaved ATP to adenosine and PPPi in the absence of Cbl. Candidates within the eut Operon—We investigated the possibility that a protein encoded by the eut operon might be the electron transfer protein for EutT. We focused on two genes of unknown function, eutP and eutQ. Chromosomal in-frame deletions of these genes were constructed singly or in combination. In a mutant cobA background, each of these deletions was tested for its ability to affect EutT-dependent growth on ethanolamine. If eutP, eutQ, or both are required for cob(II)alamin → cob(I)alamin reduction, mutant strains lacking these functions will be unable to grow on ethanolamine as carbon and energy source, i.e. the phenotype will be identical to that of the cobA eutT strain (JE7180). If EutP and/or EutQ protein is not required for other metabolic functions, lack of these functions will not affect growth on ethanolamine when the wild-type cobA or eutT gene is present on the chromosome. The cobA eutQ strain (JE8819) displayed a slightly reduced growth rate on ethanolamine relative to the cobA eutQ+ strain (JE1293) (generation time of 0.26 versus 0.23 doublings/h). However, this minor effect of the eutQ mutation on ethanolamine metabolism was independent of Cbl adenosylation because the eutQ cobA+ strain (JE8816) also had a slightly reduced growth rate compared with the wild-type strain (TR6583) (generation time of 0.24 versus 0.29 doublings/h). The cobA eutP strain (JE8818) grew as well as the cobA strain JE1293 (data not shown). None of the eutQ, eutP, or eutPQ mutant strains were defective for growth on ethanolamine as sole carbon and energy source, as reported for the cobA eutT strain (JE7180) (3Buan N.R. Suh S.-J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5708-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Based on the above data, we concluded that neither EutP nor EutQ is required for EutT function. Candidates outside the eut Operon—Given the highly hydrophobic nature of EutT protein, we postulated that a plausible source of electrons for EutT function could be the electron transport system. Various electron donors were tested for the ability to allow AdoCbl production as a function of the presence of unresolved lysate, cob(III)alamin, ATP, and Mn2+. Lysate from cells expressing eutT from an overexpression vector supported the conversion of cob(III)alamin to AdoCbl when FMN and NADH were included in the reaction mixture (Fig. 8). Control experiments showed that FMN or NADH alone did not result in EutT-dependent AdoCbl synthesis (data not shown). EutT-dependent activity was detected regardless of the presence of the eut operon on the S. enterica chromosome, indicating that the EutT function does not require interactions with other Eut proteins. AdoCbl was not synthesized from cob(III)alamin when purified CHAPS-EutT protein was substituted for EutT-enriched cell-free extracts not treated with CHAPS under conditions requiring FMN and NADH (Fig. 8). AdoCbl was not detected when the membrane fraction of the cobA eutT strain (JE7180) was added to purified CHAPS-EutT protein, suggesting that, in the presence of detergent, factors that allow EutT function no longer interact with EutT. The electron transfer proteins flavodoxin (FldA) and the 2Fe/2S ferredoxin (Fdx) were tested for their ability to reduce cob(II)alamin in the active site of purified CHAPS-EutT enzyme. S. enterica ferredoxin (flavodoxin)-NADP(H) reductase (Fpr) was used to reduce FldA and Fdx. Although activity was detectable, it was <1% of the activity measured when Ti(III) citrate was used to reduce EutT (specific activity of 0.49 versus 61 nmol of AdoCbl min–1 mg–1 of protein). At present, we cannot rule out the participation of FldA or Fdx in EutT function. The three classes of ATP:co(I)rrinoid adenosyltransferases known to date, CobA, PduO, and EutT, are not evolutionarily related as shown by their profound differences at the amino acid sequence level. The biochemical characterization of these enzymes has provided basic knowledge regarding substrate binding and mechanism of catalysis. ATP Binding and By-products of EutT Are Different from Those of Other Adenosyltransferases—From the work reported here, we have learned that the EutT enzyme requires the amino group of adenine and the β-phosphate for ATP binding and that the enzyme cleaves ATP to PPPi and adenosine when Cbl is absent from the active site. Unlike CobA or PduO, EutT cleaves PPPi to PPi and Pi, explaining why PPPi is a poor inhibitor of its adenosyltransferase activity. The elucidation of three-dimensional EutT structures could provide further mechanistic insights into substrate binding. Is EutT Located outside or inside the Metabolosome?—Although the data strongly suggest that EutT is associated with the cell membrane, the data available do not distinguish whether EutT is inside or outside the metabolosome. One possibility is that EutT is part of a complex involving other Eut proteins, that the complex is housed within the metabolosome, and that EutT anchors the latter to the cell membrane. Alternatively, EutT may be associated with the cell membrane outside of the metabolosome and may not interact with other Eut proteins at all. The latter possibility is feasible because the metabolosome is not a sealed proteinaceous vessel (31Kerfeld C.A. Sawaya M.R. Tanaka S. Nguyen C.V. Phillips M. Beeby M. Yeates T.O. Science. 2005; 309: 936-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), and AdoCbl could diffuse into the metabolosome for use by ethanolamine ammonia-lyase. Some bacteria with ethanolamine ammonia-lyase genes (eutBC) do not have a eutT homolog in their chromosome and presumably rely solely on the housekeeping CobA enzyme. It is unknown whether these organisms metabolize ethanolamine as sole carbon and energy source as do S. enterica and E. coli, both of which maintain eutT within the eut operon. Possible Means for the Generation of the Cob(I)alamin Nucleophile for the EutT Reaction—The data obtained in these studies shed some light on the identity of the electron donor of EutT. It is unclear whether ferredoxin (Fdx) or flavodoxin A (FldA) is the physiological electron transfer protein partner of EutT. The poor activity of EutT when Fdx or FldA was used to reduce cob(II)alamin to cob(I)alamin may reflect limited productive interactions between Fdx or FldA and EutT because of the detergent needed to solubilize EutT. The fact that some activity was detected with FldA and Fdx warrants further investigation. On the other had, the phenotypic behavior of strains JE8818 (cobA eutP), JE8819 (cobA eutQ), and JE8820 (cobA eutPQ) strongly suggests that the EutP and EutQ proteins are not involved in EutT-dependent corrinoid adenosylation or in cob(II)alamin → cob(I)alamin reduction. The function of the EutP and EutQ proteins remains unknown. A membrane-soluble electron donor may provide the reducing power for the reduction of the corrinoid substrate of EutT. We note that EutT-dependent adenosylation of cob(III)alamin by cell-free extracts enriched for EutT was achieved in the presence of NADH and FMN. One plausible explanation for these results is that NADH sinks its electrons into the electron transport system, and a semiquinone from dihydroflavins (FMNH2 and FADH2) or dihydroquinone reduces cob(II)alamin to cob(I)alamin in the active site of EutT. There is a need, however, to explain why NADH and FMN did not support EutT-dependent corrinoid adenosylation when the reaction mixture contained purified EutT in lieu of EutT-enriched cell-free extracts. In thinking about this problem, one must consider that purified EutT was complexed with a detergent (CHAPS). The fact that EutT adenosylated chemically reduced cob(I)alamin, but could not accept electrons from the NADH/FMN pair, suggests that CHAPS does not affect EutT activity as long as the co(I)rrinoid substrate is available.

https://openalex.org/W1987273335,"Surfactant protein D (SP-D) is an innate immune effector that contributes to antimicrobial host defense and immune regulation. Interactions of SP-D with microorganisms and organic antigens involve binding of glycoconjugates to the C-type lectin carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD).

Maltotriose, which has the same linkage pattern as the maltoside, bound with intermediate affinity. Site-directed substitution of leucine for phenylalanine 335 (Phe-335) decreased affinities for the maltoside and maltotriose without significantly altering the affinity for maltose or glucose, and substitution of tyrosine or tryptophan for leucine restored preferential binding to maltotriose and the maltoside. A mutant with alanine at this position failed to bind to mannan or maltose-substituted solid supports. Crystallographic analysis of the human neck+CRD complexed with maltotriose or p-nitrophenyl-maltoside showed stacking of the terminal glucose or nitrophenyl ring with the aromatic ring of Phe-335.

Like many other effectors of innate immunity, SP-D is a pattern recognition molecule with a variety of potential ligands, including microorganisms, organic particulate antigens, and apoptotic cells. However, there is also evidence that SP-D contributes to pulmonary surfactant homeostasis, in part by regulating the organization and epithelial uptake of surfactant lipids (5Ikegami M. Na C.L. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: L552-L561Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). SP-D is a member of a family of collectins, or collagenous C-type lectins (6Holmskov U.L. APMIS. 2000; 100: 1-59Google Scholar). In mammals, this family also includes surfactant protein A (SP-A) and serum mannose binding lectin. Like most other collectins, SP-D is assembled as multimeric complexes of trimeric subunits, or as trimers (7Crouch E.C. Respir. Res. 2000; 1: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Each trimer includes an N-terminal cross-linking and collagen domain; a trimeric neck domain; and a C-terminal trimeric array of C-type carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs). Crystallographic studies of trimeric human SP-D neck+CRD domains have shown that maltose, a preferred saccharide ligand, binds to calcium via the vicinal 3- and 4-OH groups of the non-reducing glucose, previously designated calcium ion 1 and glucose 1 (Glc1), respectively (8Shrive A.K.

These interactions are further stabilized by hydrogen bonding of Glc1 to amino acid side chains that also coordinate with calcium ion 1. The present studies were prompted by the initial observation that p-nitrophenyl-α-d-maltoside (p-NP-maltoside) is a potent inhibitor of SP-D binding to mannan. We hypothesized that there were interactions of the aromatic substituent with a hydrophobic or aromatic group in proximity to calcium ion 1. Preliminary modeling focused our attention on phenylalanine 335 (Phe-335) (Fig. 1A). To test our hypothesis, we used a functional, trimeric neck+CRD (NCRD) fusion protein containing the neck+CRD domains of human SP-D (Fig. 1, B–D) (9Crouch E. Tu Y. Briner D. McDonald B. Smith K. Holmskov U. Hartshorn K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17046-17056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and introduced site-directed substitutions at position 335. We also examined the crystal structures of purified human trimeric neck+CRD complexed with the p-nitrophenyl-maltoside and maltotriose. The p-nitrophenyl-α-d-maltoside (number 487542) was from EMD Biosciences (La Jolla, CA). The p-nitrophenyl-β-d-maltoside (N1884), p-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopyranoside (N1377), p-nitrophenyl-α-d-galactopyranoside (N0877), maltotriose (M8378), and maltotetraose (Dp4, Supelco) were from Sigma-Aldrich. Trypsin-TPCK (T-8802) and all simple sugars were also from Sigma. Expression, Purification, and Biochemical Characterization of Trimeric Neck+CRDs—The design, expression, and characterization of N-terminal-tagged, trimeric human NCRD fusion proteins has been previously described (9Crouch E. Tu Y. Briner D. McDonald B. Smith K. Holmskov U. Hartshorn K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17046-17056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For these studies, we performed site-directed substitutions at position 335 within the CRD, as defined by numbering of the full-length protein: alanine (F335A), leucine (F335L), tyrosine (F335Y), and tryptophan (F335W) (Fig. 1, A–C). DNA sequences were verified by automated sequencing of the entire coding sequence of the fusion protein. Competent cells were transformed with wild-type or mutant constructs in pET-30a(+) vector, and expressed proteins were isolated from inclusion bodies (9Crouch E. Tu Y. Briner D. McDonald B. Smith K. Holmskov U. Hartshorn K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17046-17056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). After refolding and oligomerization, the fusion proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatography and trimers were isolated by gel filtration (9Crouch E. Tu Y. Briner D. McDonald B. Smith K. Holmskov U. Hartshorn K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17046-17056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay with bovine serum albumin as standard. All recombinant proteins isolated from inclusion bodies had <10 pg of endotoxin/μg of purified protein. The binding of trimeric NCRDs to yeast mannan was examined as previously described (9Crouch E. Tu Y. Briner D. McDonald B. Smith K. Holmskov U. Hartshorn K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17046-17056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For competition assays, proteins were added to wells in the presence of various concentrations of competing inhibitors. The concentration of competitor (mm) required for 50% inhibition of binding (I50) was calculated. Protease protection assays of F335A were performed using trypsin-TPCK and modifications of published procedures (10Mullin N.P. Hall K.T. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28405-28413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following digestion in the absence and presence of various concentrations of calcium, the NCRDs were resolved by SDS-PAGE, visualized by staining, and quantified by densitometry. The percent of cleavage relative to controls incubated in the absence of enzyme was plotted versus the final calcium concentration, and the calcium concentration required for 50% protection (Ca50) was calculated. Purification of the Human NCRD for Crystallographic Studies—The conditions of isolation were modified to decrease the final ionic strength, eliminate Tris, and increase the final protein concentration. Refolded proteins were dialyzed versus 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5 (HBS) containing 10 mm imidazole and applied to a nickel affinity column (9Crouch E. Tu Y. Briner D. McDonald B. Smith K. Holmskov U. Hartshorn K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17046-17056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The fusion protein was eluted with an imidazole gradient and dialyzed versus 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm calcium chloride (HBSC). The trimeric neck+CRDs were then liberated by incubation with enterokinase (0.0015%, w/w) for up to 20 h at 37 °C. Following adsorption of the enzyme, the proteins were concentrated to 8 mg/ml using an Amicon Ultra (MWCO 10,000; Millipore) and applied to a Superose 12 column equilibrated with HBSC. The pooled trimer fractions were reconcentrated to ∼15 mg/ml. The protein showed a single peak with a polydispersity of <15% by dynamic light scattering. Crystallographic Analysis of Ligand Complexes—Crystals of native human NCRD were grown by the hanging droplet vapor diffusion method, mixing 2 μl of protein at 15 mg/ml in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2 with 2 μl of 12% polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and equilibrating over 1 ml of 12% polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. Crystals with dimensions of ∼0.2–0.3 mm on a side grew within a week. Ligands were soaked into crystals by dissolving ligand in mother liquor and transferring a crystal into the resulting solution for a period of 1–2 h. The p-nitrophenyl maltoside was soaked at a concentration of 50 mm and maltotriose at a concentration of 250 mm. After soaking, the crystal was flash frozen in a 100°K stream of nitrogen gas at the beamline. All data were collected at beamline X8C at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. Data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (11Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Human NCRDs Recognize the Apolar Substituent of an Aromatic Maltoside—Hydrophobic or apolar interactions are known to contribute to the interactions of various carbohydrate-binding proteins, including some C-type lectins (17Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 363: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Studies of plant and bacterial lectins have often employed carbohydrates with hydrophobic substituents such as aromatic glycosides (e.g. p-nitrophenyl-glycosides) (18De Boeck H. Lis H. van Tilbeurgh H. Sharon N. Loontiens F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7067-7074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kanellopoulos P.N. Pavlou K. Perrakis A. Agianian B. Vorgias C.E.

Biochem. 1970; 16: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because maltose is the most potent simple competitor of SP-D binding to various sugar ligands, we examined the binding of human SP-D NCRDs to p-nitrophenyl-α-d-maltoside. The aromatic maltoside was a potent competitive inhibitor of calcium-dependent human NCRD binding to mannan, nearly a log-fold more potent than the prototypical SP-D competitor, maltose, an α-1,4-linked, glucose disaccharide (Fig. 2, Table 1).TABLE 1Inhibition of human NCRD by saccharides and aromatic glycosidesHuman NCRD competitorI50 (mean ± S.E.)Number of independent assaysmmnGlucose3.5 ± 0.3412Maltose2.3 ± 0.1319Maltotriose0.94 ± 0.0811Maltotetraose1.8 ± 0.204p-Nitrophenyl-α-d-maltoside0.32 ± 0.0112p-Nitrophenyl-α-d-glucoside3.0 ± 0.264 Open table in a new tab To assess specificity and the mechanism of binding, we examined other available p-nitrophenyl derivatives. The effects of the p-NP substituent were specific for the glycoside and consistent with known saccharide preferences of SP-D. The molar potency of p-NP-α-d-glucoside was comparable with glucose (Table 1), and p-NP-α-d-galactoside was no better than d-galactose, a poor competitor (data not shown). The p-NP-β-d-maltoside was only slightly less potent than the α-anomeric maltoside (Fig. 2A). Thus, binding of aromatic glycosides is primarily mediated by the sugar, and effects of the p-nitrophenyl group on binding affinity depend on the location of the aromatic substituent. Human NCRDs Show High Affinity Binding to Maltotriose—Given these findings, we examined binding of the human NCRD to maltotriose, an α-1,4-linked glucose trisaccharide (Glc1-Glc2-Glc3) with a similar spatial positioning of a third ring and the same anomeric structure as the maltoside. Maltotriose was more potent than maltose as a competitor of NCRD binding to mannan, but less potent than the p-NP-maltoside (Fig. 2, Table 1). For these experiments, the rank ordering of inhibitory potencies of simple carbohydrates in competition assays using solid phase mannan was: MalTr<ManNAc,Mal<Glc,In,Man<Gal,GlcNAc (Fig. 2, Table 1, data not shown). The increasing molar inhibitory potencies of glucose (Glc1), maltose (Glc1-Glc2), and maltotriose (Glc1-Glc2-Glc3) strongly suggested secondary ligand interactions involving both Glc2 and Glc3. However, there was no further increase in binding affinity upon addition of a fourth α-linked substituent. Maltotetraose was slightly more potent than maltose, but less effective than maltotriose (Table 1). Rationale for Site-directed Substitution of Phe-335—The above findings initially appeared inconsistent with published crystallographic data of human SP-D NCRD complexed with maltose (8Shrive A.K. Tharia H.A. Strong P. Kishore U. Burns I. Rizkallah P.J. Reid K.B. Greenhough T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As visualized in that study, the disaccharide enters the binding groove perpendicular to the binding face of a trimeric CRD, with Glc2 directed away from the binding surface. Collectively, our observations suggested a non-conventional binding orientation for Glc1 of maltotriose and/or torsional effects on the terminal sugars of the bound ligand. Both of these possibilities would likely require the participation of other residues in the vicinity of the primary carbohydrate binding site. Because other classes of carbohydrate-binding proteins utilize aromatic residues to mediate or fine-tune carbohydrate binding, our attention soon focused on Phe-335 of the mature protein, a residue that is surface exposed and near the calcium ion at the carbohydrate binding interface (see below). Site-directed Substitution of Alanine for Phe-335 Abrogates Binding to Mannan—C-type lectins tolerate many different residues at the position corresponding to Phe-335, including alanine (21Zelensky A.N. Gready J.E. Proteins. 2003; 52: 466-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we reasoned that a non-conservative substitution of alanine for Phe-335 should be minimally disruptive to conformation, while providing information about the role of the aromatic side chain. The mutant (F335A) was isolated in high yield from inclusion bodies, and the chromatographic properties were indistinguishable from the wild-type protein. In addition, the purified protein co-migrated on SDS-PAGE with the wild-type human NCRD in the absence and presence of dithiothreitol, consistent with the formation of normal intrachain disulfide bonds (Fig. 1D and data not shown). Nevertheless, two separate preparations of the alanine mutant showed no detectable interaction with mannan in solid phase binding assays (e.g. Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the protein did not bind to maltosyl-bovine serum albumin or to maltosyl-agarose using routine conditions of saccharide affinity chromatography (data not shown). Because the ring of Phe-335 appears to “stack” with the side chain of Asn-41, a conserved residue of the C-type lectin motif that coordinates with calcium ion 1, we considered potential effects of the mutation on calcium binding affinity. However, saccharide binding was not “rescued” by calcium concentrations as high as 50 mm (data not shown), a strategy that has been used to restore binding activity of C-type lectin mutants with reduced calcium binding affinity (23Quesenberry M.S. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10831-10841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, there was no significant difference in the susceptibility of the wild-type protein and F335A to proteolytic cleavage in the presence or absence of calcium (10Mullin N.P. Hall K.T. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28405-28413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). The enterokinase-liberated wild-type and mutant neck+CRD domains were similarly resistant to cleavage by trypsin (1:10 w/w) for periods of up to 2 h at 37°C in the presence of physiological concentrations of calcium. However, both proteins were readily degraded in the absence of calcium, and the calcium concentration associated with 50% degradation (Ca50) was slightly lower for F335A than the wild-type protein, 0.2 ± 0.1 mm (n = 2 independent experiments) versus 0.7 ± 0.2 mm (n = 4), respectively. These calculated Ca50s are very similar to the minimum calcium concentration required for binding of the wild-type fusion protein to mannan (∼0.2 mm) (9Crouch E. Tu Y. Briner D. McDonald B. Smith K. Holmskov U. Hartshorn K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17046-17056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Substitution of Leucine at Position 335 Preferentially Decreases the Affinity for Maltotriose and p-NP-maltoside—We next performed a more conservative substitution by replacing Phe-335 with leucine, a non-aromatic but hydrophobic amino acid. The purified protein (F335L) appeared indistinguishable from the wild-type protein and F335A on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1D). However, in contrast with F335A, F335L showed specific, dose-dependent binding to mannan, similar to the wild-type protein (Fig. 3A). The apparent Kd for the mutant was (2.7 ± 0.8) × 10–7 m (n = 2) as compared with (1.8 ± 0.6) × 10–7 m (n = 3) for the wild-type NCRD. In addition, binding was efficiently inhibited by the usual competitors, including maltose (Fig. 3B). However, the inhibitory activities of maltotriose and p-nitrophenyl-maltoside were preferentially reduced as compared with the parent molecule, with molar affinities similar to glucose (Figs. 3B and 4B, below). The binding affinities for glucose, maltose, and other tested sugars were unchanged or slightly decreased as compared with the wild-type protein (Fig. 3B, data not shown). Comparable results were obtained for two independent preparations of mutant protein. An Aromatic or Indole Ring Is Required for High Affinity Binding to Maltotriose—Given that F335L was functional as a lectin but showed no preferential interaction with maltotriose or p-NP-maltoside, we hypothesized that the ring structure is critical for stabilizing interactions with these ligands. Accordingly, we substituted tyrosine or tryptophan for Phe-335, using the F335L DNA as a template. Both mutants were isolated as trimers and were indistinguishable from the wild-type fusion protein on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1D). Both mutants (designated F335Y or F335W, respectively) showed specific, dose-dependent binding to mannan (data not shown). Although binding of F335W was comparable with F335L and the wild-type protein, binding of F335Y was increased in three independent experiments, with a minimum apparent Kd of 3.1 × 10–8 m. F335Y and F335W also resembled the wild-type protein in their relative preference for maltotriose over maltose (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the I50 of maltotriose was even lower for F335W than those observed for the wild-type protein or other mutants. There were no significant effects of the mutations on the inhibitory activity of other examined saccharide competitors. Crystal Structure of the Human NCRD Complexed with p-NP-maltoside and Maltotriose—To further define the binding mechanism, the crystal structure of the enterokinase-cleaved human trimeric NCRD was determined as complexes with maltotriose and p-nitrophenyl-α-d-maltoside (Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8, and Table 2). As shown in Fig. 7, Glc3 of maltotriose is aligned over but slightly offset with respect to the ring of Phe-335, such that C5 is situated nearly over the centroid of the phenylalanine ring, separated by a distance of ∼3.7 Å. Notably, the plane of the Glc3 ring is deflected ∼90° relative to Glc1 (Fig. 7, left). The same binding orientation was observed for p-NP-α-d-maltoside. Glc1 and Glc2 essentially superimposed on those of bound maltotriose, and the nitrophenyl ring was positioned, with a slight tilt, over Phe-335 at a separation of ∼3.8 Å (Fig. 7, right).FIGURE 6Structure of a single CRD with maltotriose.

The maltose was aligned by least squares superimposition of residues in this region using the structure of Protein Data Bank accession number 1PWB. Some of the hydrogen bonds between protein and maltotriose are shown by green dashed lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Both ring structures showed other interactions with the CRD. There is a hydrogen bond from the side chain oxygen of Thr-336 to the C1-OH of Glc3, the latter being preferentially selected as the β-anomer. A similar bond is formed between Thr-336 and one of the nitro-oxygens of the maltoside. Another hydrogen bond is apparent in subunits A and B from the side chain nitrogen of Asn-337 to the C2-OH of Glc3 of maltotriose and in all subunits from the main chain amide of Asn-337 to the second nitro-oxygen of the maltoside. As compared with the previously published maltose structure, Glc2 is deflected toward Phe-335, and there is an associated tilting of Glc 1 (Fig. 8). As compared with ligands that do not utilize Phe-335, there is also an associated local deformation of the polypeptide backbone, with a deflection of Thr-336 toward the aromatic ring (data not shown). Thus, stacking of the carbohydrate ring of Glc3 with the aromatic ring of Phe-335 appears to alter the overall binding orientation of the trisaccharide and locally perturb protein conformation. In each complex, the side chain of Arg-343 is adjacent to the C6-OH of both Glc1 and Glc2. However, the orientation of the Arg-343 side chain appears constrained by hydrogen bonds and other interactions among Arg-343, Arg-349, and Glu-333 such that the angle for any direct hydrogen bond from Arg-343 to the first or second sugar ring of the ligand is unfavorable. Nevertheless, it seems likely that the ligand interaction is stabilized by the proximity of the sugar C6-OH groups to the positive charge on the Arg-343 guanidyl group. The mutagenesis and crystallographic data indicate that the aromatic ring of Phe-335 provides a secondary stabilizing interaction that renders maltotriose more effective as a competitor than the prototypical saccharide ligand, maltose. In addition, the structure of the side chain at position 335 influences the solid phase interactions of SP-D with mannan, a complex, branched fungal polysaccharide. Phe-335 is evolutionarily conserved among all known SP-D CRDs and is located near calcium ion 1 and the carbohydrate binding groove (Fig. 1) (22Hakansson K. Lim N.K. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 255-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Although this position is poorly conserved among C-type lectins, other collectins show aromatic or hydrophobic residues in this position, suggesting some shared functional roles. Aromatic residues or ring interactions are known to stabilize a variety of protein-carbohydrate interactions (25Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annual Review of Biochemistry. 1996; (Annual Reviews, Inc., Palo Alto, CA): 441-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar), and there is precedence for this among other C-type lectins, albeit primarily with respect to monosaccharide recognition (26Mullin N.P. Hitchen P.G. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5668-5681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We speculate that the higher binding affinity for the maltotriose analog p-NP-maltoside results from the greater stability of the parallel displaced pi-stacking of planar aromatic rings, as compared with stacking of the aromatic ring against Glc3. However, there are also the contributions of hydrogen bonds involving Thr-336 and Asn-337. These residues probably cooperate with Phe-335, creating an extended saccharide recognition site at the ligand binding interface. Thr-336 is also found in mouse and rat SP-D, whereas Asn-337 is conserved in all known SP-Ds, suggesting a conserved binding motif. Interestingly, the substitution of tryptophan for phenylalanine significantly increased the affinity for maltotriose as compared with the maltoside, possibly as a result of the greater planar area of the indole ring. Maltotetraose showed a lower molar inhibitory potency than maltotriose. We were unable to find information relating to the preferred solution conformation of this tetrasaccharide. However, the findings suggest that interactions with Phe-335 could preferentially stabilize binding to terminal sugars or specific branched structures in complex polysaccharides. In the previously published maltose complex, both rings of maltose were only visualized in a single subunit (8Shrive A.K. Tharia H.A. Strong P. Kishore U. Burns I. Rizkallah P.J. Reid K.B. Greenhough T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, in the present study, all three subunits were occupied by maltotriose or the maltoside, and all parts of both ligands were observed. This difference can be attributed to stabilization of the complexes by secondary interactions involving Glc3 or the nitrophenyl group. Nevertheless, our observations are consistent with the findings of Shrive et al. (8Shrive A.K. Tharia H.A. Strong P. Kishore U. Burns I. Rizkallah P.J. Reid K.B. Greenhough T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) with respect to the mechanism and general orientation of Glc1 binding. Our findings are also consistent with the previous suggestion that Arg-343, which is on the N-terminal ridge of the SP-D groove, can interact with Glc2 of maltose (22Hakansson K. Lim N.K. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 255-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (126) Google Scholar). At least within the context of maltotriose and the maltoside, Arg-343 is positioned to potentially interact with the C6-OH of Glc1 and/or Glc2. This provides a possible explanation for the greater affinity of human SP-D for maltose as compared with glucose. However, the extent of these interactions depends on the orientation of Glc1- and Glc2-O6 and the Arg-343 side chain, which varies from subunit to subunit. Because F335L showed essentially normal binding to mannan and was quantitatively bound to maltosyl-agarose, stacking interactions with an aromatic ring at residue 335 are not required for binding to solid phase ligands. On the other hand, F335Y showed enhanced binding to mannan, possibly as a result of additional hydrogen bonding interactions. In addition, the findings with F335A suggest that a bulky hydrophobic residue is required at position 335 for binding to at least some solid phase carbohydrates. Although we did not detect any unintended structural perturbations in F335A or effects on calcium-dependent resistant proteolysis, additional characterization of the mutant is in progress. The other lung collectin, surfactant protein A (SP-A), has a conserved tyrosine (Tyr-208) at the same position as Phe-335. This residue is within a “hydrophobic patch” previously suggested to play a role in ligand binding (27Head J.F. Mealy T.R. McCormack F.X. Seaton B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43254-43260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The planes of the flanking aromatic rings of Tyr-164 and Tyr-194 in SP-A are oriented relatively perpendicular to and above the plane of the ring of Tyr-208. Interestingly, these residues are replaced by alanine in SP-D, thereby increasing the potential accessibility of the planar surface of the aromatic ring. In summary, our studies demonstrate that Phe-335 participates in an extended carbohydrate binding at the ligand binding interface. We suggest that the aromatic ring stabilizes binding of the CRDs near surfaces by stacking with carbohydrate rings or hydrophobic moieties in the same or different molecules. These findings have important implications for the interactions of SP-D with surfactant and with polysaccharides and other glycoconjugates associated with microbial cell walls and organic particulate antigens. We thank Bruce Linders for outstanding technical assistance, including the performance of the endotoxin assays. We also thank Janet North for excellent administrative support and Dr. Itzhak Ofek for first suggestig that we examine aromatic glycosides."

We found opposing effects of RhoA and Rac1 on cellular PKG I expression: (i) cell density-dependent changes in PKG I expression varied directly with Rac1 activity and inversely with RhoA activity; (ii) RhoA activation by calpeptin suppressed PKG I, whereas RhoA down-regulation by small interfering RNA increased PKG I expression; and (iii) PKG I promoter activity was suppressed in cells expressing active RhoA or Rho-kinase but was enhanced in cells expressing active Rac1 or a dominant negative RhoA. Sp1 consensus sequences in the PKG I promoter were required for Rho regulation and bound nuclear proteins in a cell density-dependent manner, including the Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4). KLF4 was identified as a major trans-acting factor at two proximal Sp1 sites; active RhoA suppressed KLF4 DNA binding and trans-activation potential on the PKG I promoter. Experiments with actin-binding agents suggested that RhoA could regulate KLF4 via its ability to induce actin polymerization. Regulation of PKG I expression by RhoA may explain decreased PKG I levels in vascular smooth muscle cells found in some models of hypertension and vascular injury.

Cellular targets of cGMP include cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKGs), cGMP-regulated phosphodiesterases, and cGMP-gated ion channels (1Munzel T. Feil R. Mulsch A. Lohmann S.M. Hofmann F. Walter U. Circulation. 2003; 108: 2172-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Type I and II PKG are products of different genes and differ in tissue distribution and function (2Lohmann S.M.

Two isoforms of PKG I, α and β, differ in their N-terminal 100 amino acids and are splice variants of the two most 5′ exons of the PKG I gene, which appear to be flanked by separate GC-rich promoters (6Orstavik J. Natarajan V. Tasken K. Jahnsen T. Sandberg M. Genomics. 1997; 42: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). PKG Iα is expressed highly in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), platelets, and cerebellum, whereas PKG Iβ is prevalent in other parts of the central nervous system, the adrenal gland, and uterus (1Munzel T. Feil R. Mulsch A. Lohmann S.M. Hofmann F. Walter U. Circulation. 2003; 108: 2172-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 6Orstavik J. Natarajan V. Tasken K. Jahnsen T. Sandberg M. Genomics. 1997; 42: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Within a given cell type or tissue, PKG I expression varies greatly, depending on growth conditions. A transient decrease in PKG I mRNA occurs in VSMCs exposed to mitogens (7Tamura N. Itoh H. Ogawa Y. Nakagawa O. Harada M. Chun T.-H. Suga S. Yoshimasa T. Nakao K. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 552-557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and some but not all investigators have observed lower PKG Iα expression in actively proliferating, subconfluent VSMC cultures compared with postconfluent cultures (8Cornwell T.L.

Cell Biochem. 2004; 92: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In early passage VSMCs and cardiomyocytes and in intact blood vessels, NO or cGMP or cAMP analogs decrease PKG Iα mRNA and protein expression by decreasing transcription; inflammatory cytokines down-regulate PKG Iα in VSMCs by inducing NO synthase and increasing cGMP production (10Soff G.A.

After vascular injury in vivo, PKG I expression is transiently reduced in proliferating neointimal VSMCs compared with the normal vessel wall (14Anderson P.G. Boerth N.J. Liu M. McNamara D.B.

During myoblast differentiation, PKG I expression is up-regulated by the transcription factor FoxO1a to orchestrate myoblast fusion (17Bois P.R.J. Brochard V.F. Salin-Cantegrel A.V.A. Cleveland J.L. Grosveld G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7645-7656Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Rho family proteins, including RhoA and Rac1, cycle between an active, GTP-bound state and an inactive, GDP-bound state; their activities are regulated downstream of cell-cell adhesion receptors and various mitogen receptors via guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins (18Fukata M.

Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Active RhoA induces actin polymerization and stress fiber formation; it increases the expression of smooth muscle-specific genes through actin-regulated cooperation between serum response factor (SRF) and transcription factors of the myocardin family (22Miano J.M.

Develop. 2004; 14: 558-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). RhoA can also repress gene expression (e.g. RhoA down-regulates transcription of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Waf1/Cip1 and inhibits cytokine-induced transcription of the inducible NO synthase gene), but mechanism(s) of transcriptional inhibition by RhoA remain largely unknown (24Olson M.F.

Activation of PKG I mediates NO-induced smooth muscle relaxation and inhibition of VSMC proliferation and migration (1Munzel T. Feil R. Mulsch A. Lohmann S.M. Hofmann F. Walter U. Circulation. 2003; 108: 2172-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the mechanisms regulating PKG I expression in VSMCs. We found that PKG I expression is controlled by RhoA and Rac1 activity and that RhoA regulation of the PKG Iα promoter is mediated, at least in part, through binding of the Krüppel-like transcription factor KLF4 to Sp1 consensus sites in the proximal promoter. DNA Constructs, Antibodies, and Reagents—The human PKG Iα promoter (positions –430/+35 relative to the transcription start site (6Orstavik J. Natarajan V. Tasken K. Jahnsen T. Sandberg M. Genomics. 1997; 42: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar)) was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA from the leukemic cell line HL-60 as a template. This promoter construct does not include the recently described binding sites for FoxO1a or upstream regulatory factors 1/2 (17Bois P.R.J. Brochard V.F. Salin-Cantegrel A.V.A. Cleveland J.L.

Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar); the pSVOA parent vector was chosen because of low basal luciferase expression. Truncated promoter constructs (–80/+35, –430/+22, and –430/+5) were generated by PCR using appropriate primers. Point mutations in putative Sp1 binding sites were introduced into the full-length promoter using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with the following oligodeoxynucleotides (oligodNTs; sense strand, underlined letters indicate mutated bases): 5′-CCGCCGCCGCCGCCAAACGAGAAAAAGTTTC-3′(mutated A-site located at +1), 5′-GAAAAAGTTTCGCGGAAAGGCTCAGTGAAAAA-3′ (mutated B-site at +22), 5′-GAGGGGGACGAGGGAAAGGGTCTCAGGGGAG-3′ (mutated C-site at –294), and 5′-TCAGGGGAGGAAGGAAAGCTCTAATTGGTT-3′ (mutated D-site at –272).

The sequence for KLF4 siRNA has been described previously (37Chen Z.Y. Tseng C.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1203-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Each pair of oligoribonucleotides was annealed at a concentration of 20 μm and introduced into cells by transfection with either Oligofectamine™ or Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Western Blots and PKG Activity Assay—SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described (33Gudi T. Chen J.C. Casteel D.E. Seasholtz T.M. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol.

Western blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence. PKG activity was measured in cell extracts as the difference between Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) phosphorylation in the presence and absence of 3 μm 8-bromo-cGMP; assays were performed in the presence of 100 μm [γ-32PO4]ATP, 300 μm Kemptide, and a 0.3 μm concentration of the specific protein kinase A inhibitor PKI (33Gudi T.

Primers specific for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as a control for equal mRNA loading. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using an Mx3000 real time PCR detection system (Stratagene) using IQ™ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol with a 0.2 μm concentration of the following primers: 5′-GCGTTCCGGAAGTTCACTAA-3′ (PKG I, sense) and 5′-TTGATGATGCAGCTCTCCTTC-3′ (PKG I, anti-sense); 5′-ACTAACCGTTGGCGAGAGGAAC-3′ (KLF4, sense) and 5′-TGGGATAGCGAGTTGGAAAGG-3′ (KLF4, antisense); 5′-CGTGGTTCACACCCATCACAAAC-3′ (GAPDH, sense) and 5′-GCAAGTTCAACGGCACAGTCAAG-3′ (GAPDH, antisense). DNA was denaturated at 95 °C for 30 s, with annealing and extension occurring at 60 °C for 1 min; each primer pair generated a single product as determined by analyzing melting curves after a 40-cycle control reaction. Standard curves were generated by plotting Ct values versus the amount of input RNA for each primer pair and demonstrated similar amplification efficiencies.

Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min and were diluted to 1 mg/ml protein concentration. To 0.8 mg of cell lysate protein was added either 20 μg of rhotekin-RBD or 10 μg of PAK-RBD bound to glutathione-agarose (via glutathione S-transferase tag), and the mixture was incubated with gentle rocking at 4 °C for 60 min.

We examined PKG I expression at two different cell densities in the rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell line CS54, in primary bovine aortic smooth muscle cells (BASMCs), and in REF52 fibroblasts; cells were plated at 0.1–0.2 × 106/10-cm dish or at a 10-fold higher density and cultured for 48 h to generate subconfluent and postconfluent cultures, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1A, PKG I protein levels were about 3-fold higher in postconfluent compared with subconfluent CS54 cultures, with equal protein loading shown by immunoblotting for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). Similar results were obtained in BASMCs, and an even greater relative increase in PKG I expression was observed in REF52 cells. Like primary VSMCs (10Soff G.A. Cornwell T.L. Cundiff D.L. Gately S. Lincoln T.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2580-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), CS54 and REF52 cells express predominantly PKG Iα; using an isotype-specific antibody, we were able to detect low levels of PKG Iβ in CS54 cells, with minimal differences between subconfluent and postconfluent cells (data not shown). Similar to the increased PKG I protein, we found an increase in PKG activity from 413 ± 39 pmol/min/mg in subconfluent cells to 816 ± 104 pmol/min/mg protein in postconfluent CS54 cells (n = 3). Cornwell et al. (8Cornwell T.L. Soff G.A. Traynor A.E. Lincoln T.M. J. Vascular Res. 1994; 31: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) reported comparable PKG activities and differences between subconfluent and postconfluent cultures in primary rat aortic VSMCs. Semiquantitative RT-PCR with PKG Iα-specific primers showed about 3-fold higher PKG Iα mRNA levels in postconfluent CS54 cells compared with subconfluent cells, whereas GAPDH mRNA levels were similar under both conditions (Fig. 1B). To quantitate PKG I mRNA expression more accurately, we used fluorescence-based, real time RT-PCR and measured PKG I relative to GAPDH expression. In CS54 cells and BASMCs, relative PKG I mRNA levels were 2–3-fold higher in postconfluent cells compared with subconfluent cells; in REF52 cells, PKG I mRNA levels increased 10-fold when cells went form a subconfluent to a postconfluent state (Fig. 1C). To determine whether the observed differences in PKG I expression affected cGMP signaling in VSMCs, we examined phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), a physiologically important substrate of PKG I in VSMCs (42Smolenski A.

When subconfluent or postconfluent CS54 cells were treated for 10 min with increasing concentrations of a membrane-permeable cGMP analog, half-maximal VASP phosphorylation on Ser239, the preferred PKG I phosphorylation site, occurred at about 3 μm 8-CPT-cGMP in postconfluent cells, whereas in subconfluent cells, it required >10 μm (Fig. 1D). The left upper panel shows a Western blot developed with a VASP phospho-Ser239-specific antibody; cGMP concentrations of >10 μm are not shown. Note that additional phosphorylation of VASP on Ser157 induces a gel shift with the appearance of a lower mobility species (42Smolenski A. Bachmann C. Reinhard K. Hoenig-Liedl P. Jarchau T. Hoschuetzky H. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20029-20035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Equal loading was demonstrated by blotting with an anti-tubulin antibody (Fig. 1D, left lower panel). When CS54 cells were incubated with 10 μm 8-CPT-cGMP, postconfluent cells demonstrated faster kinetics of VASP Ser239 phosphorylation compared with subconfluent cells (Fig. 1D, right upper panel). Thus, increased PKG I expression in postconfluent VSMCs led to faster VASP phosphorylation at lower cGMP concentrations, indicating enhanced cGMP signal transduction efficiency. Cell Density-dependent Regulation of Rho and Rac Activation—In epithelial cell cultures, cell density-dependent signals from cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesions regulate the activity of Rho family proteins (18Fukata M. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 887-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). VSMCs express different types of cadherins than epithelial cells, and to our knowledge, the effect of cell density on the activity of Rho-related proteins in VSMCs has not been determined. We examined the effect of cell density on Rho and Rac activation in CS54 cells, using the GTPase-binding domains of rhotekin or PAK for affinity precipitation of GTP-bound Rho isoforms (RhoA, -B, and -C) or Rac1, respectively (39Ren X.-D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar, 40Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

Using a RhoA-specific antibody, we found that RhoA·GTP was about 3 times higher in subconfluent CS54 cells than in postconfluent cells (Fig. 1E, upper panel); cell lysates contained similar amounts of total RhoA (lower panel). RhoB·GTP levels were also significantly higher in subconfluent cells compared with postconfluent cells (data not shown). We determined that RhoA was the predominant Rho isoform expressed in CS54 cells by comparing cell lysate pro"

One mechanism by which cancer cells evade retinoid-induced effects is through repression of retinoic acid receptor β (RARβ) gene transcription. The RA response element β (βRARE) is the essential DNA sequence required for retinoid-induced RARβ transcription. Here we show that the estrogen-responsive B box protein (EBBP), a member of the RING-B box-coiled-coil protein family, is a βRARE-binding protein. EBBP undergoes serine threonine phosphorylation and enhanced protein stability after RA treatment. Following RA treatment, we also observed increased nuclear EBBP levels in aggregates with the promyelocytic leukemia protein at promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies. EBBP enhanced RA-responsive RARβ transcription in RA-sensitive and -resistant cancer cells, which were resistant to both a histone deacetylase inhibitor and a demethylating agent. EBBP-specific small interfering RNA reduced basal and RA-induced RARβ expression. EBBP increased βRARE-transactivating function through its coiled-coil domain. Taken together, our work suggests that EBBP may have a pivotal role in the retinoid anti-cancer signal.

Molecular events at the point of transcriptional regulation appear to be critical in determining cellular responses to retinoids. Upon entering the nucleus by simple diffusion, the retinoid ligand binds to retinoic acid receptors (RARs) or retinoid X receptors (each with α, β, and γ subtypes). The ligand-receptor complex initiates the retinoid signal by changes that occur at consensus DNA sequences or RA response elements (RAREs) in the regulatory 5′-untranslated sequence of so-called “target” genes.RARβ is a retinoid target with a well defined βRARE, which is necessary but not sufficient for the RA anti-cancer signal (4de The H. Vivanco-Ruiz M.M. Tiollais P. Stunnenberg H. Dejean A. Nature. 1990; 343: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Repression of basal or RA-induced RARβ transcription is a common event in a wide range of human tumor types, and numerous studies indicate that in specific circumstances RARβ acts as a tumor suppressor gene (2Lotan R.

A frequent mechanism of RARβ repression is DNA methylation-induced silencing (9Cote S. Momparler R.L. Anti-Cancer Drugs. 1997; 8: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Additionally, histone deacetylation is also associated with retinoid resistance, in the presence and absence of RARβ2 hypermethylation, indicating that multiple mechanisms appear to contribute to RARβ repression (10Suh Y.A.

RA treatment in acute promyelocytic leukemia has been particularly valuable in illuminating mechanisms of retinoid resistance. Most acute promyelocytic leukemia cases present with the reciprocal t(15Kastner P. Perez A. Lutz Y. Rochette-Egly C. Gaub M.P. Durand B. Lanotte M. Berger R. Chambon P.

Blood. 1998; 92: 1758-1767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dominant negative effects of the PML-RARα fusion protein have been associated with increased affinity for co-repressor proteins in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. The signaling is constitutively repressed by co-repressor-associated histone deacetylase activity at physiologic RA levels. Co-repressor association with PML-RARα is disrupted, following recruitment of co-activator complexes and differentiation induced at pharmacologic RA dosages (12Mozziconacci M.J. Liberatore C.

PML protein localizes to discrete nuclear domains termed PML bodies, which represent one of many subnuclear domains in the eukaryotic cell nucleus (15Kastner P. Perez A. Lutz Y. Rochette-Egly C.

Cell. 1994; 76: 333-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells in culture with RA correlates with degradation of the PML-RARα fusion protein, allowing wild-type PML protein to dimerize or multimerize in PML bodies (17Melnick A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 3167-3215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In common with other hormone receptor proteins, RARs can act as either transcriptional repressors or activators (18McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). This dual mode of regulation is dependent on the ability of RARs to associate with either co-activator or co-repressor proteins. Retinoid ligand binding to nuclear retinoid receptors induces a conformational change in these proteins, already bound at target gene promoter sequences, leading to new protein-protein interactions. One of the key factors determining the transcriptional and cellular response to RA is the dynamic change in co-regulator protein binding. These interactions are determined by the nuclear location, the post-translational modification, and the expression level of co-regulator proteins (19White K.A. Yore M.M. Deng D. Spinella M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7829-7835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Kang Z. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Acetylation, methylation, or phosphorylations of specific residues in histone tails, mediated by multiprotein complexes, control the activity of nuclear receptors. Most nuclear hormone receptors are phosphoproteins, and phosphorylation is a potent regulator of nuclear receptor function. Depending on the receptor, phosphorylation can regulate receptor DNA binding, dimerization, coactivator recruitment, and transactivation (22Tremblay A. Tremblay G.B. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol.

A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). These findings led us to hypothesize that the retinoid anti-cancer effect may be determined by other proteins that undergo post-translational modification following retinoid treatment of cancer cells, and, moreover, that such changes in co-regulator proteins may represent mechanisms for overcoming retinoid resistance in cancer cells.To identify novel regulators of retinoid signaling, we developed a technique for directly isolating βRARE-binding proteins, using electromobility shift assays, two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE), direct isolation of differentially displayed protein spots, and peptide microsequencing to better understand the dynamic changes in protein-protein and protein-DNA complexes at this focal point of the RA anti-cancer signal. Using this approach, we have identified the estrogen-responsive B box protein (EBBP) as a βRARE-binding protein, which undergoes post-translational modification, affecting protein stability and expression level at PML bodies, following RA treatment of retinoid-sensitive cancer cells. Importantly, EBBP derepressed RA-responsive RARβ transcription in retinoid-resistant cancer cells, suggesting a novel mechanism for RA-regulated gene transcription.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells and Culture Conditions—The human neuroblastoma cell lines used in these experiments were BE(2)-C (BE) and SH-SY5Y (SY). BE and SY cell lines were generously supplied by Dr. J. Biedler (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York). The human lung cancer cell line (SK-MES-1) and breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. All cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 as an adherent monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with l-glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum. All-trans-retinoic acid (aRA) was purchased from Sigma, solubilized in ethanol, stored at -70 °C, and used within 2 weeks of solubilization. 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A were purchased from Sigma.Decoy Experiments—βRARE decoy (GAT CGG GTA GGG TTC ACC GAA AGT TCA CTC G) or scrambled (AGC TCT CTG TTC TCC TGG TGT TCT GAA GCT) oligonucleotides were annealed to their respective complementary sequence by heating to 80 °C for 5 min and then cooling down to room temperature. BE cells cultured in T25 flasks were transfected with either βRARE decoy (5 μm) or scrambled (5 μm) oligonucleotides using 192 μg/ml of SuperFect (Qiagen) for 2 h. The medium was then replaced and supplemented with 10 μm aRA for 24 h. To test the efficacy of the oligonucleotide decoy at blocking responses through the βRARE, BE neuroblastoma cells with low level constitutive RARβ expression, as measured by a competitive reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (27Cheung B. Hocker J.E. Smith S.A. Norris M.D. Haber M. Marshall G.M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), were used.Plasmid Construction—pGL3-3×βRARE was constructed by ligating a double-stranded βRARE oligonucleotide into the plasmid pGL3.basic vector (Promega) at the SmaI multicloning site. The EBBP full-length cDNA (gift from Dr. Zajchowski) was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(-) vector (Invitrogen) at the EcoRI multicloning site. The EBBP full-length and deleted EBBP cDNA mutant constructs were created using PCR fragments cloned into plasmid pcDNA3.1(-)/Myc.His (Invitrogen) at EcoRI and KpnI sites. The oligonucleotides used for the PCR assay were as follows: 5′-TTGGGGGTGACTGCTCCCTATGGTACCAATG-3′ (ΔB1B2BoxF1) forward primer for mutant 1; 5′-AATGGAATTCATGAACACTGAAGACATCACCTTC-3′ (ΔB1B2BoxΔCoilF1) forward primer for mutant 2; 5′-AACTTAAGCTTGGTACCGAG-3′ (ΔEBBPF1) forward primer for the full-length and mutants 3 and 4; 5′-CATTGGTACCATAGGGAGCAGTCACCCCCAA-3′ (ΔEBBPm/h R1) reverse primer for full-length, mutant 1, and mutant 2; 5′-CATTGGTACCATACGCATATTGGAGGAACTG-3′ (ΔRFPm/hR1) reverse primer for mutant 3; and 5′-CATTGGTACCATACCGCTCCAAGTCTAACTG-3′ (ΔCoilΔRFPm/hR2) reverse primer for mutant 4.Isolation of Candidate βRARE-associated Proteins—Nuclear proteins were isolated from BE cells untreated or treated with 10 μm aRA for 24 or 48 h. Proteins were then combined with a radiolabeled βRARE, and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (6Cheung B. Yan J. Smith S.A. Nguyen T. Lee M. Kavallaris M. Norris M.D. Haber M. Marshall G.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 105: 856-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Following an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, the polyacrylamide gels were transferred onto 3 MM blotting paper (Whatman) and dried on a slab gel drier prior to autoradiography. Protein-βRARE complexes were excised directly from the gels and then passively eluted from the DNA-protein complexes (passive elution buffer: 100 mm sodium acetate, 0.1% SDS, and 10 mm dithiothreitol). The proteins were then separated using 2-DE, which was performed according to the standard protocols (28Gorg A. Obermaier C. Boguth G. Harder A. Scheibe B. Wildgruber R. Weiss W. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 1037-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). All gels were run in triplicate, and then comparisons were made between aRA-treated and untreated gels. Differentially bound protein spots were excised and sent for mass spectroscopy and amino acid analysis (Australian Proteome Analysis Facility, Macquarie University, Sydney). The samples underwent an in-gel 16-h tryptic digest at 37 °C, and the resulting peptides were extracted from the gel, placed in microtiter plates, and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) (29Pieles U. Zurcher W. Schar M. Moser H.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3191-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar).Transient Transfection and Reporter Gene Analysis—Cells (2.3 × 105) were seeded in a 6-well culture plates. Transient transfection assays were carried out using the SuperFect Transfection Reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were co-transfected with 2 μg of the pGL3-3×βRARE luciferase (firefly luciferase) reporter plasmid, 2 μg of EBBP expression vector, and 0.75 μg of the pRL-TK vector (Renilla luciferase) as an internal control for the transfection efficiency. After 48 h, the treated cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), harvested by scraping in 250 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega), and lysed by freezing/thawing two times. Lysate samples were cleared by centrifugation for 30 s at 4 °C. The supernatants were used for measuring both firefly and Renilla luciferase activities with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) using a luminometer (TD-20/20; Turner Designs, CA). Luciferase reagent substrate (100 μl) was mixed with cell lysates (20 μl), and then initiated the Renilla luciferase reaction. Stop & GloR solution (100 μl) was added to the mixture, and Renilla luciferase activity was measured. The ratio between firefly and Renilla luciferase activities was referred to as relative luciferase activity.Analysis of Gene Expression by RT-PCR—RARβ and EBBP mRNA expression levels in neuroblastoma cells were assayed using a competitive semiquantitative RT-PCR technique, which we have previously described (30Bordow S.B. Haber M. Madafiglio J. Cheung B. Marshall G.M. Norris M.D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5036-5040PubMed Google Scholar). The RT-PCR involved determining a ratio between the level of expression of the RARβ and EBBP genes and that of the control β2-microglobulin (β2M) gene in total RNA samples. The RT-PCR primer sequences for β2M have been described (31Marshall G.M. Cheung B. Stacey K.P. Camacho M.L. Simpson A.M. Kwan E. Smith S. Haber M. Norris M.D. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 485-491PubMed Google Scholar). The gene-specific RARβ2 forward PCR primer was 5′-CTACACTGCGAGTCCGTCTT-3′, and the reverse PCR primer was 5′-CAGAGCTGGTGCTCTGTGTT-3′. This primer pair generated a 131-bp product extending from bp 375 to 506 of the published RARβ2 sequence (4de The H. Vivanco-Ruiz M.M. Tiollais P. Stunnenberg H. Dejean A. Nature. 1990; 343: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). The gene-specific EBBP forward PCR primer was 5′-CAGGCTCCAGGCTAACCAAAAG-3′, and reverse PCR primer was 5′-TCCTCTAAGAAGGGCATCACATTG-3′. This primer pair generated a 131-bp PCR product extending from bp 812 to 943 of the published EBBP coding sequence (32Liu H.L. Golder-Novoselsky E. Seto M.H. Webster L. McClary J. Zajchowski D.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1733-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In order to maximize RT-PCR efficiency in RA-resistant SK-MES-1 cells, the FailSafe PCR System (Epicenter Biotechnologies) was used. This involved using the FailSafe PCR enzyme mix and a specific PCR C buffer.Quantitative Real Time PCR—RARβ mRNA expression levels in lung and breast cancer cells were assayed using a quantitative real time PCR technique. Total RNA was isolated from cell lines using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). For each RT-PCR, 2 μg of total RNA was converted into cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Two microliters of reverse transcription reaction was then quantified by quantitative real time PCR using PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System and ABI TaqMan® PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The quantitative results of RARβ mRNA were normalized to β2M mRNA from the same sample. Primers were synthesized at Invitrogen, and probe was purchased from Applied Biosystems. Primers used for RARβ were as follows: forward primer, 5′-tgaaaatcacagatctccgtagca-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-ccaggaatttccattttcaaggt-3′. The TaqMan® probe used for RARβ was as follows: 5′-6-carboxyfluorescein-ctctgcacctttagcactg-3′ molecular groove-binding non-fluorescence quencher. Primers used for β2M were as follows: forward primer, 5′-actggtctttctatctcttgtactacactga-3′; reverse primer, 5′-tgatgctgcttacatgtctcgat-3′. The TaqMan® probe used for β2M was 5′-VIC-tgcctgccgtgtgaaccatgtgac-3′ 6-carboxy-tetramethyl-rhodamin.Immunofluorescence Staining for EBBP and Myc Tag Antibodies—Immunohistochemical staining for EBBP expression was carried out as follows. All procedures were performed at room temperature. BE cell cultures adherent to the substratum on the glass slide were rinsed in TBS (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) in wells. Cells were fixed and permeabilized by incubation in 500 μl of cold 4% paraformaldehyde in TBS for 20 min prior to incubation in 500 μl of 0.2% Triton X in TBS in wells for 10 min. After washing in TBS, cultures were incubated in 100 μl of blocking buffer 1 (1% fetal bovine serum, 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS) and then incubated in 100 μl of polyclonal rabbit anti-human EBBP antibody diluted 1:30 in TBS or monoclonal mouse anti-Myc tag antibody diluted 1:500 in 5% fetal calf serum, PBS for 1 h. After washes in TBS, cells were incubated in 100 μl of secondary antiserum, goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate diluted 1:150 in TBS for 1 h or Cy3 anti-mouse secondary antibody diluted 1:1000 in 5% fetal calf serum, PBS buffer for 40 min. After washing, slides were mounted in fluorescence anti-fade solution and sealed with clear nail polish.Confocal Scanning Fluorescence Microscopy Images of EBBP and PML Body Immunostaining—Cells were fixed in 10% formalin for 20 min, followed by permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X for 10 min. Cells were then blocked in 1% fetal bovine serum and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h and then incubated in rabbit anti-EBBP (1:30) for 1 h, followed by anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:100) for 1 h. Cells were then reblocked for 10 min in 10% bovine serum albumin in PBS before incubation in mouse anti-PML (1:10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h and then incubated in biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (1:100) for 1 h and finally labeled with streptavidin Alexa 594. Coverslips were then mounted on slides in Vectashield antifade solution and sealed with nail polish ready for fluorescence microscopy.Confocal scanning fluorescence microscopy was performed on a TCS SP2 System (Leica) fitted with a HC×PL APO ×63/1.20 W CORR objective. Fluorochromes fluorescein isothiocyanate and Alexa 594 were excited with the 488-nm argon laser and the 530-nm helium/neon laser, respectively. Emission fluorescence was collected in red (>580 nm) and green (500-560 nm) channels sequentially. Images were collected and processed using the imaging software provided by the Leica TCS NT system. Images were randomly taken from at least three different fields of view, and the immunofluorescence was measured from 6-8 cells/treatment. Nuclear areas were considered EBBP-positive if they displayed a fluorescence of over 1501 (Arbitrary Fluorescence Unit).Immunoblot Analysis and Protein Degradation Determination—Immunoblot analysis and 2-DE immunoblot of nuclear proteins (50-150 μg of protein/lane, respectively) were performed as previously described (6Cheung B. Yan J. Smith S.A. Nguyen T. Lee M. Kavallaris M. Norris M.D. Haber M. Marshall G.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 105: 856-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Crude EBBP antiserum was kindly provided by Dr. D. A. Zajchowski (Berlex Biosciences). A synthetic peptide (TNTTPWEHPYPDLPS), representing the EBBP protein sequence residues 396-410, were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Polyclonal antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with the conjugated peptide following a standard immunization protocol (32Liu H.L. Golder-Novoselsky E. Seto M.H. Webster L. McClary J. Zajchowski D.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1733-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibody anti-Myc tag (9B11) was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. The EBBP antibody for immunoblot and 2-DE immunoblot was used at a 1:250 dilution, and anti-Myc tag antibody for EBBP deletion mutant immunoblot was used at a 1:500 dilution in 0.5% defatted milk in TBST buffer. Rabbit polyclonal actin antibody (Sigma) was used at a 1:2000 dilution to normalize for differences in loading. Subsequently, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase, anti-rabbit, or anti-mouse secondary antibody (Pierce), which was used at a 1:5,000 dilution. Chemiluminescent detection was performed using the Super-Signal Western blotting Kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions.To determine the EBBP protein stability, BE cells were treated with or without cycloheximide (3.35 μm) and aRA (10 μm). At the indicated time points, cell cultures were harvested, and nuclear extracts were prepared using an NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein (50 μg) from each sample were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-EBBP or anti-RARβ antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at a 1:400 dilution. The relative amounts of EBBP and RARβ proteins were quantified using a Bio-Rad Quantity One program. Identical blots were analyzed by Western analysis using anti-actin antibodies as the loading control.Bio-Plex Phosphoprotein Assays—For analysis of phosphoproteins, neuroblastoma cells were treated with 10 μm aRA for 0, 3, 6, 9, and 24 h on 24-well plates. The cell lysates were prepared using the Bio-Plex cell lysis kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein recovery was determined with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). Protein extracts were aliquoted and stored at -80 °C prior to analysis. Bio-Plex CooH (carboxylated) beads 45 and the Bio-Plex™ amine coupling kit were purchased from Bio-Rad. Covalent coupling of the captured EBBP antibody to polystyrene beads was performed using the manufacturer's instructions. The beads were counted with a hemacytometer and stored at a final concentration of 4 × 106 beads/ml in the dark at 4 °C. Coupling efficiency of EBBP polyclonal antibody was tested by staining 10,000 beads with a phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL). Functionality of the coupling was determined by incubating 2,000 beads with 10 μg of protein in assay buffer 2 (Upstate Biotechnology) and shaking overnight at 4 °C and then incubating protein samples with anti-phospho-Ser/Thr or anti-phosphotyrosine mouse monoclonal IgGs (Upstate Biotechnology) for 1 h, followed by Beadlyte biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) for 30 min. After incubation with Beadlyte™ streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Upstate Biotechnology) and washing with Upstate Biotechnology washing buffer, the beads were measured and analyzed using the Bio-Plex system (Bio-Rad) in combination with the Bio-Plex Manager software (33Fulton R.J. McDade R.L. Smith P.L. Kienker L.J. Kettman Jr., J.R. Clin. Chem. 1997; 43: 1749-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar).Measurement of DNA Synthesis—Incorporation of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was determined to evaluate DNA synthesis by a proliferation kit (Roche Applied Sciences) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The cells were seeded at 6 × 103 cell/well in 96-well plates for 24 h and transiently transfected with expression vectors for 72 h. The cells were incubated with BrdUrd (10 μm) for another 2 h and fixed, and the incorporated BrdUrd was labeled with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody before the addition of a peroxidase substrate. The absorbance of the wells was measured on a microplate reader with a test wavelength of 370 nm and a reference wavelength of 490 nm.Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—siRNA for EBBP (ID 3573) and negative control siRNA (catalogue number) were purchased directly from Ambion as double-stranded EBBP predesigned siRNA. The sequences of the siRNA were targeted EBBP exon 6; the sequences were patented and cannot be published according to Ambion. BE neuroblastoma cells at 1 × 10 ml were simultaneously plated and transfected with 2 μl/ml Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), which mixed with 10 nm siRNA in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. At 8 h post-transfection, the medium volume was doubled with 20% fetal calf serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were then treated with 10 μm aRA or ethanol solvent control at 24 h and were harvested for RNA or protein at 72 h. Transfection efficiency and its effect on potential target gene expression was assessed by RT-PCR and/or immunoblot.Chroma"
https://openalex.org/W1973475138,"Abstract Multi-KH domain proteins are highly evolutionarily conserved proteins that associate to polyribosomes and participate in RNA metabolism. Recent evidence indicates that multi-KH domain proteins also contribute to the structural organization of heterochromatin both in mammals and Drosophila. Here, we show that the multi-KH domain protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Scp160p, contributes to silencing at telomeres and at the mating-type locus, but not to ribosomal silencing. The contribution of Scp160p to silencing is independent of its binding to the ribosome as deletion of the last two KH domains, which mediate ribosomal binding, has no effect on silencing. Disruption of SCP160 increases cell ploidy but this effect is also independent of the contribution of Scp160p to telomeric silencing as strong relief of silencing is observed in Δscp160 cells with normal ploidy and, vice versa, Δscp160 cells with highly increased ploidy show no significant silencing defects. The TPE phenotype of Δscp160 cells associates to a decreased Sir3p deposition at telomeres and, in good agreement, silencing is rescued by SIR3 overexpression and in a Δrif1Δrif2 mutant. Scp160p shows a distinct perinuclear localization that is independent of its ability to bind ribosomes. Moreover, telomere clustering at the nuclear envelope is perturbed in Δscp160 cells and disruption of the histone deacetylase RPD3, which is known to improve telomere clustering, rescues telomeric silencing in Δscp160 cells. These results are discussed in the context of a model in which Scp160p contributes to silencing by helping telomere clustering."
https://openalex.org/W1992748475,"Hxt2 and Hxt1 are high affinity and low affinity facilitative glucose transporter paralogs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively, that differ at 75 amino acid positions in their 12 transmembrane segments (TMs). Comprehensive analysis of chimeras of these two proteins has previously revealed that TMs 1, 5, 7, and 8 of Hxt2 are required for high affinity glucose transport activity and that leucine 201 in TM5 is the most important in this regard of the 20 amino acid residues in these regions that differ between Hxt2 and Hxt1. To evaluate the importance of the remaining residues, we systematically shuffled the amino acids at these positions and screened the resulting proteins for high affinity and high capacity glucose transport activity. In addition to leucine 201 (TM5), four residues of Hxt2 (leucine 59 and leucine 61 in TM1, asparagine 331 in TM7, and phenylalanine 366 in TM8) were found to be important for such activity. Furthermore, phenylalanine 198 (TM5), alanine 363 (TM8), and either valine 316 (TM7) or alanine 368 (TM8) were found to be supportive of maximal activity. Construction of a homology model suggested that asparagine 331 interacts directly with the substrate and that the other identified residues may contribute to maintenance of protein conformation.

Construction of a homology model suggested that asparagine 331 interacts directly with the substrate and that the other identified residues may contribute to maintenance of protein conformation. Facilitated diffusion of glucose across the plasma membrane of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is mediated by a variety of hexose transporters (Hxt1–Hxt17, Gal2) (1Kruckeberg A.L. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 2Boles E. Hollenberg C.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 85-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that belong to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) 2The abbreviations used are: MFS, major facilitator superfamily; TM, transmembrane segment. (3Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr. M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A common structural feature of members of this superfamily is the presence of 12 putative transmembrane segments (TMs), with both the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains being present on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Among the 18 hexose transporters of S. cerevisiae, Hxt2 is a major high affinity glucose transporter (Km = 3.6 mm), and Hxt1 is a low affinity glucose transporter (Km = 44 mm). The numbers of amino acid residues in each putative TM and inter-TM loop of Hxt2 are identical to those in the corresponding regions of Hxt1, and the two proteins share ∼70% sequence identity in these regions, with only 75 of the ∼250 residues in TMs differing between Hxt2 and Hxt1. Site-specific mutagenesis has been used extensively to determine the contribution of individual amino acid residues to the structure and function of transporters. In some instances, however, single point mutations have indirect effects on protein function through an extensive, rather than localized, distortion of protein structure. To circumvent this problem and to identify positively the contributing amino acid residues, we have adopted a comprehensive chimeric approach with two closely related paralogs that differ in substrate specificities (4Nishizawa K. Shimoda E. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2423-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 5Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M.

J. 2003; 372: 247-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kasahara T. Ishiguro M. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30274-30278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We previously investigated which TMs of Hxt2 are important for high affinity glucose transport with the use of a new procedure designated TM shuffling (7Kasahara T. Kasahara M. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 247-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We thus randomly replaced each of the 12 TMs of Hxt2 with the corresponding segments of Hxt1 at the DNA level. Clones encoding transporters with a high affinity for glucose were selected by plating the transformants on glucose-limited agar plates. Our results demonstrated that a minimal combination of TMs 1, 5, 7, and 8 of Hxt2 is necessary for high affinity glucose transport. The chimeric transporter C1578 (Fig. 1), in which all TMs but 1, 5, 7, and 8 of Hxt2 are replaced with the corresponding TMs of Hxt1, excluding a contribution of 55 of the 75 TM residues that differ between Hxt2 and Hxt1, thus exhibited high affinity and high capacity glucose transport activity similar to that of Hxt2. We subsequently showed that, among the 20 residues that differ between Hxt2 and Hxt1 in these four TMs, Leu201 in TM5 of Hxt2 is the most important for high affinity glucose transport (8Kasahara T. Ishiguro M. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30274-30278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the bacterial MFS transporters LacY (9Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar) and GlpT (10Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar) have been determined at a resolution of <4 Å, revealing that the configurations of the TMs in these two transporters are highly similar and that TMs 1, 5, 7, and 8 contribute to the central pore. Although alignment of the amino acid sequences of MFS transporters has revealed substantial sequence variability, these findings together with a low resolution crystal structure of the MFS transporter OxlT (11Hirai T. Heymann J.A. Maloney P.C. Subramaniam S. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1712-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and molecular modeling (12Vardy E. Arkin I.T. Gottschalk K.E. Kaback H.R. Schuldiner S. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1832-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) suggest that MFS transporters share a similar conformation. We have now examined which amino acids among the 19 remaining residues in TMs 1, 5, 7, and 8 of Hxt2 that differ from those of Hxt1 are important for high affinity and high capacity glucose transport activity. Our results show that, in addition to Leu201, four of these residues are important for and three residues are supportive of such activity. Molecular modeling suggests that most of these residues do not directly interact with the substrate but rather have a structural role. Construction of Vectors—The plasmid Hxt2mnx-pVT, which comprises HXT2 under the control of the ADH1 promoter in the multicopy vector pVT102-U (YEp URA3 bla), was constructed as described previously (7Kasahara T. Kasahara M. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 247-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, HXT2 was modified to be divisible into four regions by the introduction of MroI, NheI, XhoI, and ClaI sites into the nucleotide sequences corresponding to the NH2-terminal end of TM4, the loop between TM6 and TM7, and the loop between TM9 and TM10, as well as immediately after the sequence corresponding to the COOH terminus, respectively. The expression vector C1578-pVT, which encodes the chimeric transporter C1578 (in which all of the TMs of Hxt2, with the exception of 1, 5, 7, and 8, have been replaced with those of Hxt1), was also described previously (7Kasahara T. Kasahara M. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 247-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutants were prepared by replacing each target codon with modified sequences with the use of a PCR-based approach. Saturation mutagenesis of residues in TMs 1, 5, 7, and 8 was performed as described (8Kasahara T. Ishiguro M. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30274-30278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In brief, mutation of 14 target residues in these TMs was achieved by PCR with each of the four regions of the modified HXT2 sequence divided by EcoRI, MroI, NheI, and XhoI sites and with degenerate primers. The PCR products for the EcoRI-MroI, MroI-NheI, and NheI-XhoI regions were connected first with the use of MroI and then with the use of NheI. The final product was used to replace the corresponding region of a modified version of C1578-pVT (C1578K-pVT (see “Results” and “Discussion”)). After amplification in Escherichia coli, plasmids were introduced into S. cerevisiae strain KY73 (MATα hxt1Δ::HIS3::Δhxt4 hxt5::LEU2 hxt2Δ::HIS3 hxt3Δ::LEU2::Δhxt6 hxt7Δ::HIS3 gal2Δ::DR ura3–52 MAL2 SUC2 MEL) (13Ye L. Kruckeberg A.L. Berden J.A. van Dam K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4673-4675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plate Selection—Transformants that possessed high affinity and high capacity glucose transport activity were selected after the incubation of yeast cells for 3 or 4 days at 30 °C on glucose-limited (glucose, 1 mg/ml) agar plates containing a synthetic medium supplemented with adenine and amino acids, but not with uracil (S0.1D plates) (7Kasahara T. Kasahara M. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 247-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To increase the number of clones encoding high affinity transporters examined, we sampled colonies with a size smaller than that of those expressing C1578 and that were found to encode transporters with a Vmax of 810–1280 pmol/107 cells/5 s, compared with the range of 1030–1500 pmol/107 cells/5 s in our previous study (8Kasahara T. Ishiguro M. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30274-30278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). KY73 cells are not able to grow on S2D plates (glucose, 20 mg/ml), in which glucose is the only carbon source. We therefore also determined the total number of transformants that grew on S2Mal plates (maltose, 20 mg/ml). Modified portions of all clones selected in the present study were verified by DNA sequencing with an automated sequencer (model 310, Applied Biosystems). Transport Assay—Cells harboring plasmids were grown to log phase (optical density at 650 nm, 0.3–0.6) at 30 °C in S2Mal synthetic liquid medium. Glucose transport by the cells was measured at 30 °C for 5 s as described (4Nishizawa K. Shimoda E. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2423-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14Kasahara T. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4422-4428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Transport activities measured at a d-[14C]glucose concentration of 0.1 mm were expressed as picomoles of glucose/1 × 107 cells/5 s and were corrected for the background activity determined either in the presence of 0.5 mm HgCl2 or with 0.1 mm l-[14C]glucose. Construction of a Three-dimensional Model of Hxt2—The crystal structure of GlpT (Protein Data Bank 1PW4) formed the basis for construction of a structural model of Hxt2. CLUSTAL W (15Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55766) Google Scholar) was used to align residues in the putative TMs of Hxt1 to Hxt7, Gal2, GlpT, and LacY, and the alignment was modified manually. A working homology model of Hxt2 was generated with the Biopolymer module of Insight II (version 2000; Accelrys, San Diego, CA) as described (8Kasahara T. Ishiguro M. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30274-30278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Other Assays—A crude membrane fraction was prepared from cells as described (16Kasahara T. Kasahara M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and immunoblot analysis of this fraction was performed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for the COOH-terminal region of Hxt2 (4Nishizawa K. Shimoda E. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2423-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and with 125I-labeled protein A (GE Healthcare). The intensity of bands corresponding to immune complexes was measured with imaging plates (BAS 1800II; Fuji Film) (16Kasahara T. Kasahara M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) within the range proportional to the amount of protein. Cell number was determined with a particle counter (Z2; Beckman Coulter). Protein concentration was measured with bicinchoninic acid (Pierce). Elimination of Five Residues and Construction of C1578K—We started our analysis with C1578, in which 19 amino acid residues were potential contributors to high affinity glucose transport. By saturation mutagenesis of TMs 1, 5, 7, and 8 in C1578, we previously found that five residues of Hxt2 (Ile57, Val69, Tyr215, Ile317, and Ile359) were present in ≤50% of the 60 clones isolated that encoded high affinity transporters (8Kasahara T. Ishiguro M. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30274-30278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These five residues were thus considered not to be required for high affinity glucose transport and were excluded from the present study. We therefore constructed a modified form of C1578 (C1578K) in which these five residues were replaced with the corresponding residues of Hxt1. Yeast cells expressing C1578K grew on selection plates (S0.1D plates) and showed glucose transport activity similar to that of those expressing C1578. The Km, Vmax, and the transport efficiency (Vmax/Km) of C1578K were 5.8 ± 0.6 mm, 1300 ± 140 pmol/107 cells/5 s, and 224 pmol/107 cells/5 s/mm (means ± S.E., n = 4), respectively, whereas the corresponding values for C1578 were 5.2 ± 0.1 mm, 1180 ± 70 pmol/107 cells/5 s, and 227 pmol/107 cells/5 s/mm (n = 12). Random Mutagenesis of 14 Residues—We then examined the remaining 14 amino acid residues that differ between Hxt2 and Hxt1, including Cys195 and Phe198, which we previously found to be supportive of high affinity transport activity (8Kasahara T. Ishiguro M. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30274-30278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We thus randomly replaced all of these 14 residues of C1578K simultaneously with the corresponding residues of Hxt1, generating 120,000 transformants corresponding to the 214 = 16,384 possible combinations of Hxt1 and Hxt2 residues at these sites. Selection on S0.1D plates yielded 1300 transformants, 40 of which were subjected to plasmid extraction and DNA sequencing. The 40 clones encoded 17 distinct proteins, all of which contained four residues of Hxt2 (Leu59 and Leu61 in TM1, Asn331 in TM7, and Phe366 in TM8) on the C1578K background (Table 1). We therefore considered these four residues to be important for high affinity and high capacity glucose transport activity. Five additional residues of Hxt2 (Cys58 and Ile63 in TM1, Cys195 in TM5, Leu357, and Val367 in TM8) were present in ≤59% of the 17 transporters and were therefore considered unimportant. We replaced these five residues of C1578K with the corresponding residues of Hxt1, thereby generating a transporter (H1) that contained a total of 10 Hxt2-derived residues in TMs 1,5, 7, and 8, and this transporter showed high affinity and high capacity glucose transport activity similar to that of C1578 (Table 2). The remaining five of the 14 residues examined (Phe198 in TM5, Val316 in TM7, and Gln352, Ala363, and Ala368 in TM8) were present in 71–94% of the 17 transporters and were subjected to further examination.TABLE 1Amino acid residues at 14 sites of C1578K-based chimeric transporters exhibiting high affinity and high capacity glucose transport activity Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Characterization of the 32 chimeras containing all possible combinations of Hxt2 and Hxt1 residues at positions 198, 316, 352, 363, and 368 KY73 cells expressing the chimeric transporters were subjected to plate assays with S2D and S0.1D media. Cell growth or no growth after incubation for 3–4 days at 30°C is indicated by + or – signs, respectively; + (s) indicates that the size of the colonies was smaller than that for cells expressing C1578. The level of transporter expression was determined by quantitative analysis of immunoblots. For assay of glucose transport activity, cells were grown to log phase at 30 °C in S2Mal synthetic liquid medium, after which activity was measured for 5 s at 30 °C with 0.1 mm d-glucose as the substrate. The Km and Vmax values were determined with 1–100 mm d-glucose and are expressed as mm and pmol/107 cells/5 s, respectively; the Vmax/Km ratio is expressed as pmol/107 cells/5 s/mm. All values are the means ± S.E. from at least three experiments.

We prepared a crude membrane fraction from cells expressing each of these 32 chimeric transporters and examined the extent of transporter expression by immunoblot analysis with antibodies to the COOH-terminal region of Hxt2 (Fig. 2). All 32 chimeras yielded a predominant immunoreactive band at a position corresponding to that of Hxt2 (47 kDa). Quantitative analysis of these bands revealed an expression level for the chimeras of 68–118% (n = 3 to 5) relative to the value for C1578 (Table 2). Eight (H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H9, H13, and H17) of the 32 clones conferred the ability to grow on S0.1D plates, although the colony size varied. Whereas H1 possessed all five Hxt2-derived residues, H2, H3, H5, H9, and H17 possessed four and H6 and H13 possessed three Hxt2 residues at the five targeted positions. An assay of glucose transport activity revealed that the Km values of all eight mutants were similar to that of C1578, whereas the Vmax values varied (Table 2). No marked differences in substrate specificity were apparent among these eight transporters (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Substrate specificities of chimeric transporters of the H series. The transport activities of eight H-series transporters (Table 2) and of C1578 were measured at 30 °C for 5 s with 0.1 mm d-[14C]glucose as substrate in the presence of a 200-fold excess of the indicated nonradioactive sugars. The data are the means ± S.E. of values from four to eight experiments and are expressed relative to the transport activity determined in the presence of 20 mm l-glucose. 2DG, 2-deoxy-d-glucose; 3OMG,3-O-methyl-d-glucose; 6DG, 6-deoxy-d-glucose.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Complementary Approach to Construct Chimeras That Mediate Low Affinity Transport—The reverse approach, determining which residues of Hxt1 are important for low affinity glucose transport, was problematic. A chimera in which all the TMs are derived from Hxt1 and the remainder of the molecule is derived from Hxt2, which was named C0 in a previous study (7Kasahara T. Kasahara M. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 247-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was found to be expressed but was virtually inactive, indicating the importance of structures adjacent to TMs. Efforts were continued with the chimera H5 generated in the present study. After replacement of the essential Leu201 of Hxt2 with Hxt1-derived Val, we performed saturation mutagenesis of eight residues (Leu59, Leu61, Phe198, Val316, Asn331, Ala363, Phe366, and Ala368). The clone that exhibited the lowest Km of 17 mm showed a reduced Vmax of 870 pmol/107 cells/5 s; the corresponding values for C1578 were 5.2 mm and 1180 pmol/107 cells/5 s, and those for Hxt1 were 44 mm and 2800 pmol/107 cells/5 s. The phenotype of this clone thus appears not to reflect that of Hxt1 but rather that of an impaired Hxt2. Given that Hxt2 and Hxt1 show similar substrate specificities and are both inhibited only by sulfhydryl reagents, further studies aimed at identifying residues necessary for low affinity transport will likely require the development of a new strategy. Location of Important Residues Inferred from a Homology Model—To evaluate the functional roles of the identified residues of Hxt2, we modified our previous homology model (8Kasahara T. Ishiguro M.

In the model, Asn331 is situated in the outer half of TM7 and facing the central pore, a favorable position for direct interaction with substrate. However, Leu59, Phe198, Val316, and Ala368 appear to interact with neighboring residues of other TMs. Leu201 in TM5, which is essential for high affinity transport, was positioned facing the central pore in our previous model (8Kasahara T. Ishiguro M. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30274-30278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the present model, however, it faces TM8 and appears to interact with Phe362 at a van der Waals' distance; it may therefore act to maintain inter-TM stability. Many of the residues found to be important for high affinity transport are hydrophobic aliphatic amino acids and thus may contribute to conformational stability. All of the residues thought to contribute to protein structure, with the exception of Val316 in TM7, are clustered at one side of the cytoplasmic orifice of the central pore and facing outward (Fig. 5B). These Hxt2 conformational residues are also more hydrophobic or bulkier (or both) than the corresponding Hxt1 residues (Table 1). The implications of these observations warrant further investigation. A hydrophobic residue (Ile) in TM7 of GLUT7 was also shown to be important for substrate recognition (19Manolescu A. Salas-Burgos A.M. Fischbarg J. Cheeseman C.I. J. Biol.

A working homology model suggests that among these eight residues, Asn331 interacts directly with the substrate and the others contribute to the protein conformation required for high affinity transport. Our present results suggest the possibility that fine structural tuning is important for construction of a high affinity and high capacity transporter. A subtle modification in structure may bring about a substantial change in transport characteristics. It also seems likely that most residues responsible for the direct recognition of glucose are common to both Hxt2 and Hxt1 and were not isolated in the present study. Previous results (6Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16721-16724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and our present data suggest that Asn331 (TM7) and Phe431 (TM10) are two candidates for substrate-interacting residues. The functional role of Asn331 should be the subject of further study. We thank A. L. Kruckeberg (Gothia Yeast Solutions, Gothenburg, Sweden) for yeast strain KY73 and M.

In this study, we tried to investigate the molecular mechanism of this discrimination. That citrate binds directly to Tcp was verified by the site-specific thiol modification assays using membrane fractions prepared from Escherichia coli cells expressing the mutant Tcp receptors in which single Cys residues were introduced at positions in the putative ligand-binding pocket. To determine the region responsible for the ligand discrimination, we screened for mutations defective in taxis to magnesium in the presence of citrate. All of the isolated mutants from random mutagenesis with hydroxylamine were defective in both citrate and metal-citrate sensing, and the mutated residues are located in or near the α1-α2 and α3-α4 loops within the periplasmic domain. Further analyses with site-directed replacements around these regions demonstrated that the residue Asn67, which is presumed to lie at the subunit interface of the Tcp homodimer, plays a critical role in the recognition of the metal-citrate complex but not that of citrate. Various amino acids at this position differentially affect the citrate and metal-citrate sensing abilities. Thus, for the first time, the abilities to sense the two attractants were genetically dissected. Based on the results obtained in this study, we propose models in which the discrimination of the metal-citrate complex from citrate involves cooperative interaction at Asn67 and allosteric switching.

Citrate is a constituent of the tricarboxylic acid cycle operating under aerobic conditions, which provides many of the precursors required for biosynthesis and energy metabolism (1Nimmo H.G. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1987; (American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.): 156-169Google Scholar). Therefore, this compound is of physiological significance for many organisms including bacteria. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (hereafter referred to as Salmonella) has citrate transport systems responsible for utilization of citrate as a sole source of carbon and energy, but such a system is absent in the closely related species Escherichia coli (1Nimmo H.G. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1987; (American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.): 156-169Google Scholar). Consistent with the citrate utilizing ability, Salmonella shows positive chemotaxis toward citrate, whereas E. coli is not attracted by citrate (2Ingolia T.D. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 798-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kihara M. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 297-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In general, chemotaxis of E. coli and Salmonella involves an elaborate signal transduction system, in which the transmembrane chemoreceptors, in response to various chemoeffectors, regulate the activity of the histidine kinase CheA and hence that of the response regulator CheY that controls the rotational sense of the flagellar motor (4Bren A.

The difference in chemotactic ability of the two enterobacterial species corresponds to the presence and absence of the chemoreceptor Tcp, which mediates chemotaxis toward citrate and away from phenol (13Yamamoto K. Imae Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although wild-type E. coli has no citrate transport system and cannot respond to citrate, E. coli cells expressing Tcp as a sole chemoreceptor respond to citrate (13Yamamoto K. Imae Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 14Iwama T. Nakao K.-H. Nakazato H. Yamagata S. Homma M. Kawagishi I. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1437-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This suggests that the response to citrate does not require citrate transport or a periplasmic binding protein, unlike E. coli taxis to maltose, which requires maltose-binding protein (MBP) 2The abbreviations used are: MBP, maltose-binding protein; IAF, 5′-iodoacetamidofluorescein; TM, transmembrane segment; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. in addition to the chemoreceptor Tar (15Springer M.S.

Cell. 1987; 50: 171-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), although there is no direct evidence that Tcp directly binds citrate. A remarkable feature of Tcp is that it can sense a divalent cation, including magnesium and calcium ions, as an attractant only in the presence of citrate, even after Tcp adapts to citrate. Therefore, Tcp has been considered to recognize a metal ion in the presence of citrate or a metal-citrate complex as an attractant distinct from citrate (hereafter, this attractant will be referred to as metal-citrate for simplicity). Among all of the homologous chemoreceptors, Tar (for aspartate) and Tsr (for serine) have been studied extensively with respect to ligand recognition sites (18Gardina P. Conway C. Kossmann M.

The residues of Tar and Tsr involved in ligand binding are located around the apex of the two helices (α1 and α4) spanning the cytoplasmic membrane as TM1 and TM2, respectively (Fig. 1 and Refs. 27Milburn M.V.

In the previous study, we substituted Cys for the four conserved basic or polar residues, as well as three other basic ones, in the Tcp periplasmic domain, which is otherwise devoid of Cys (14Iwama T. Nakao K.-H. Nakazato H. Yamagata S. Homma M. Kawagishi I. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1437-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The results demonstrated that the five residues (Arg63, Arg68, Arg72, Lys75, and Tyr150) are involved in the recognition of citrate. However, none of the residues mutated seemed to be involved in the specific recognition of divalent cations in the presence of citrate. Therefore, the molecular mechanism of metal-citrate recognition by Tcp remained unknown. In this study, we addressed this question. First, we demonstrated direct binding of citrate to the Cys-replaced Tcp proteins by examining protection of Cys by the ligand from thiol modification (31Iwama T. Homma M. Kawagishi I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13810-13815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Next, we isolated and characterized mutants deficient in taxis toward magnesium in the presence of citrate. Considering the results obtained, we then performed site-directed mutagenesis. The substitution of Cys, Ala, or Ser for Asn67 deteriorated metal-citrate sensing without impairing citrate sensing, suggesting that the Asn residue is important for discriminating metal-citrate from citrate alone. Based on these results, we propose models for the ligand discrimination that involves cooperative interaction of the two subunits of the Tcp homodimer.

Random Mutagenesis and Mutant Screening—The plasmid carrying the tcp gene (2 μg) was treated with 0.4 m hydroxylamine for 5 h at 50 °C and then dialyzed against an excess amount of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA) overnight. HCB339 cells were transformed with the solution of mutated plasmids. Transformants were inoculated into minimal semisolid agar plate (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.5% glycerol, 0.1 mm threonine, 0.1 mm leucine, 0.1 mm histidine, 0.1 mm methionine, 0.3% agar) supplemented with 10 mm citrate and were grown at 30 °C. To form a gradient of magnesium, a slip of filter paper containing 1 m MgCl2 was placed in the middle of the plate prior to inoculation. The mutants obtained were further subjected to swarming in tryptone semisolid agar (1% tryptone, 0.5% NaCl, 0.3% agar) and examined by temporal stimulation assay as described below. Site-directed Mutagenesis of tcp—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by a two-step PCR (35Landt O. Grunert H.P. Hahn U.

The PCR products were cloned into the pSU18-based plasmid pSNC19 carrying the tcp gene, in which cytosine at 702 is replaced by adenine to introduce a BglII restriction site in the middle of the gene. The resulting plasmids carry the tcp-E61A, tcp-T62I, tcp-N67C, tcp-N76C, tcp-D79N, tcp-H140A, tcp-K143A, tcp-D145A, tcp-N146C, tcp-Y147C, tcp-N152C, tcp-Q156C, tcp-D160N/D161N, tcp-N67A, tcp-N67C, tcp-N67S, tcp-N67Q, tcp-N67T, tcp-N67V, tcp-N67L, tcp-N67I, tcp-N67D, tcp-N67E, tcp-N67K, tcp-N67R, tcp-N67F, and tcp-N67Y genes, respectively, under the control of the lac promoter. The nucleotide sequences were verified by the dideoxy chain termination method. Assays of Chemotactic Responses—HCB339 cells expressing Tcp were grown at 30 °C in TG medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% NaCl, 0.5% glycerol) supplemented with 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The cells were harvested in the late exponential phase, washed with KP motility medium (10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium dl-lactate, 0.1 mm methionine), and resuspended in motility medium. If necessary, MOPS motility medium (20 mm MOPS-NaOH buffer, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium dl-lactate, 0.1 mm methionine) was used instead of KP motility medium. Temporal stimulation assays were carried out as described previously (37Umemura T. Matsumoto Y. Ohnishi K. Homma M. Kawagishi I. J. Biol.

Labeling of Cys-replaced Tcp with the Thiol-specific Fluorescent Dye IAF—Thiol-specific labeling of Cys-replaced Tcp was performed according to the previous works (31Iwama T. Homma M. Kawagishi I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13810-13815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). 3H. Sakamoto, H. Tajima, D. Shiomi, T. Iwama, M. Homma, and I. Kawagishi, unpublished data. Membrane fractions prepared from HCB436 cells expressing Cys-replaced Tcp were treated with 50 μm IAF for 5 min at 19 °C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, and the samples were dissolved in SDS-loading buffer (67 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8% glycerol, 1% SDS, 0.003% bromphenol blue) and then boiled for 2 min. When necessary, 100 mm citrate was added to the membrane fractions prior to the IAF treatment. Also, to complete the labeling reactions, the reaction mixtures were subjected to heat and SDS prior to termination of the reaction. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Fluorescent bands in the gel were analyzed by using a lumino-image analyzer LAS-1000 (Fuji). Citrate Binds Directly to Tcp—It has not been unambiguously determined whether citrate binds directly to the Tcp protein like aspartate to Tar or through a certain binding protein like maltose to Tar through MBP. To test these possibilities, we employed the site-specific thiol modification assay, in which a ligand competes with a thiol-modifying reagent for a unique Cys residue in the ligand-binding pocket (24Gomi S. Lee L. Iwama T. Imae Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 133: 208-213Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 25Gomi S. Lee L. Iwama T. Imae Y. Kawagishi I.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13810-13815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the previous study (14Iwama T. Nakao K.-H. Nakazato H. Yamagata S. Homma M. Kawagishi I. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1437-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we introduced a Cys residue at various positions (R63C, R68C, R72C, K75C, R78C, Y150C, and K157C) of the periplasmic domain of Tcp, which is otherwise devoid of Cys, and examined the citrate sensing capabilities of the resulting mutant Tcp receptors; the R78C and K157C receptors mediate essentially wild-type responses to citrate, but the other mutant receptors mediate weaker responses. These mutant receptors, as well as wild-type Tcp, were expressed in strain HCB436 (33Wolfe A.J. Berg H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6973-6977Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), which lacks all four chemoreceptors, the methyltransferase CheR, and the methylesterase CheB. Membranes of the resulting strains were prepared and subjected to the modification of thiol-specific fluorescent dye (IAF) in the presence or absence of various concentrations of citrate (Fig. 2). In the absence of citrate, bands specific to the R72C, K75C, and K78C receptors were detected clearly, whereas no corresponding band was observed for wild-type Tcp. The R68C, Y150C, and K157C receptors gave only faint bands, whose intensities did not increase upon treatment with SDS and heat. The faster migration of the R63C protein than the other mutant Tcp proteins in the gel (14Iwama T. Nakao K.-H. Nakazato H. Yamagata S. Homma M. Kawagishi I. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1437-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) made it impossible to discriminate the receptor band from nonreceptor bands. The addition of 0.1 m citrate significantly decreased the intensity of the band of the R78C receptor, but not those of the R72C and K75C receptors, demonstrating that citrate competes with IAF for the thiol group of Cys78. These results indicate that Tcp binds to citrate directly and that Arg78 is located in the citrate-binding pocket of Tcp. Metal-Citrate Sensing Capabilities of Cys-replaced Tcp Receptors—In the previous work (14Iwama T. Nakao K.-H. Nakazato H. Yamagata S. Homma M. Kawagishi I. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1437-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we studied the sensing abilities of the Cys-replaced Tcp receptors to citrate alone. Here, we first examined the metal-citrate sensing abilities of these mutant receptors. Each mutant Tcp protein was expressed in the receptorless E. coli strain HCB339 (ΔMCP), and then the resulting cells were examined for the abilities of responding to citrate alone and magnesium in the presence of citrate by the capillary accumulation assay (Fig. 3). The results with citrate alone were consistent with those of the temporal stimulation assay (14Iwama T. Nakao K.-H. Nakazato H. Yamagata S. Homma M. Kawagishi I. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1437-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The magnesium-citrate sensing abilities of the mutant receptors corresponded almost exactly to their citrate sensing abilities. Theoretically, a given mutant receptor would mediate responses to both citrate and metal-citrate (this phenotype will be referred to as Cit+ Mec+), citrate only (Cit+ Mec–), metal-citrate only (Cit– Mec+), or none (Cit– Mec–). However, no Cys-replaced mutant showed Cit+ Mec– or Cit– Mec+ phenotype. These results suggest that the residues Arg63, Arg68, Arg72, Lys75, and Tyr150 are important for the recognition of both attractants but not involved in the discrimination between them. Random Mutagenesis with Hydroxylamine and Isolation of Mutants Deficient in Chemotaxis toward a Metal-Citrate Complex—To obtain an insight into the ligand discrimination mechanism, we carried out random mutagenesis of the tcp gene to isolate mutant(s) specifically defective in the recognition of metal-citrate. We first developed the following screening system. A slip of filter paper containing 1 m MgCl2 was placed in the middle of a minimal semisolid agar plate supplemented with 10 mm citrate. Then HCB339 cells transformed with a library of randomly mutated tcp-carrying plasmids were inoculated at both sides of the filter with sterile toothpicks (Fig. 4C). Cells expressing wild-type Tcp swam toward higher concentrations of magnesium, forming a colony of biased shape. Cells lacking Tcp formed a small condensed colony, whereas cells with the R68C receptor formed a more diffused round-shaped colony presumably because their run/tumble bias was better suited to spread out in an agar matrix than the former cells, which cannot tumble (Fig. 4C). In the absence of citrate, cells with any Tcp receptor showed a small diffused round-shaped colony (data not shown). E. coli cells consume various nutrients in their environments and produce wastes, resulting in generation of their gradients around growing colonies. However, no gradient of citrate can be formed because E. coli cannot utilize citrate. Therefore, only a gradient of magnesium or a magnesium-citrate complex can be generated by diffusion from the slip of filter paper. In tryptone semisolid agar, cells expressing the R68C receptor or wild-type Tcp swam in response to repellents and unidentified chemoattractant(s) that are produced during growth (Fig. 4A and Ref. 14Iwama T. Nakao K.-H. Nakazato H. Yamagata S. Homma M. Kawagishi I. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1437-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is considered that the difference in colony shape between cells expressing the R68C receptor and those expressing wild-type Tcp may be related to the ability of sensing magnesium or magnesium-citrate. Thus, we concluded that this assay can be applicable to screening for mutants defective in the recognition of magnesium-citrate. The plasmid carrying the tcp gene was treated with 0.4 m hydroxylamine and introduced into the receptorless E. coli strain HCB339. About 14,000 transformants were screened for the defect in swarming toward Mg2+ in the presence of citrate. The candidates were further subjected to swarming assays with tryptone semisolid agar in the absence of citrate to examine whether the mutants retained general receptor functions such as repellent sensing, transmembrane signaling, and adaptation. The clones that swarmed much more slowly than the parental strain (expressing wild-type Tcp) were excluded. Consequently, 25 independent clones were obtained as mutants defective in chemotaxis to magnesium-citrate. The nucleotide sequences of the mutant tcp genes revealed that all of the nucleotide changes were GC to AT transitions, which are expected for random mutagenesis with hydroxylamine (39Miller M.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. 1992; (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 291-305Google Scholar). Among them, one clone had a single amino acid substitution (G339E) in the cytoplasmic domain of Tcp that causes a tumbling behavior (i.e. the activation of CheA kinase), and therefore was not studied further. It should be noted that Gly338 of Tar, which is a positional equivalent of Gly339 of Tcp, has been demonstrated to play a key role in on-off switching of CheA kinase (40Coleman M.D. Bass R.B. Mehan R.S. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7687-7695Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Sixteen clones had missense mutations within the region encoding the periplasmic domain, and twelve of them carried single mutations (Table 1). Many of them cause substitutions at Arg63 and Arg68, both of which are responsible for the recognition of citrate as demonstrated in the previous work (14Iwama T. Nakao K.-H. Nakazato H. Yamagata S. Homma M. Kawagishi I. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1437-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In addition, two novel mutations (A70V and G151D) were identified. These were further examined for their ligand sensing abilities by the temporal stimulation assay. Neither mutation affected the swimming pattern in the absence of any chemotactic stimulus or the repellent response to glycerol. However, the G151D mutation abolished the ability of magnesium-citrate sensing, whereas the A70V mutation caused a milder defect (Table 2). Similar results were obtained for the citrate sensing ability (Table 2). These results indicate that the two residues (Ala70 and Gly151) are involved in the recognition of both citrate and metal-citrate by Tcp.TABLE 1Mutants deficient in chemotaxis toward magnesium in the presence of citrateMutantCodon numberCodon changeMutant numberPeriplasmic domain R63C63CGC → TGC745, 515 R63H63CGC → CAC*768, *769, 799 R63H/G279S63, 279CGC → CAC, GGC → AGC782 T62I/R63C62, 63ACC → ATC, CGC → TGT805 R68C68CGC → TGC727, 643 R68H68CGC → CAC557 R68H/A119T68, 119CGC → CAC, GCG → ACG806 A70V70GCG → GTG743 G151D151GGC → GAC697, 725, 819 G151N/L203F151, 203GGC → AAC, CTC → TTC795Transmembrane domain G25R25GGA → AGA751, 761, 593 G25R/Ala7025GGA → AGA, (GCG → GCA)772Cytoplasmic domain S261L261TCG → TTG460 S261L/Ala298261TCG → TTG, (GCC → GCT)774 S261L/Leu255, Ser530261TCG → TTG (CTC → CTT, AGC → AGT)543 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Sensing abilities of the mutated Tcp receptorsReceptorResponseResponseaThe cells were incubated for 5 h in the presence of 10 mm citrate to adapt to it prior to stimulation with MgCl2.12.5% Glycerol10 mm Citrate12.5% Glycerol10 mm MgCl2Wild type+++++++++++++++A70V+++++++++++G151D+++++++++-a The cells were incubated for 5 h in the presence of 10 mm citrate to adapt to it prior to stimulation with MgCl2.

Therefore, we reasoned that, if citrate and metal-citrate share essentially the same binding pocket in Tcp, the α1-α2 and α3-α4 loops must contain residue(s) that interact specifically with metal-citrate. Alternatively, if a magnesium ion binds to a site outside of the citrate-binding pockets that is created upon a conformational change induced by citrate binding, t"

High concentrations of intracellular methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside 6-phosphate are toxic, and cell growth is prevented. However, transformation of E. coli MG-1655 with a plasmid (pAP1) encoding the gene aglB from Klebsiella pneumoniae resulted in excellent growth of the transformant MG-1655 (pAP1) on the glucose analog. AglB is an unusual NAD+/Mn2+-dependent phospho-α-glucosidase that promotes growth of MG-1655 (pAP1) by catalyzing the in vivo hydrolysis of methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside 6-phosphate to yield glucose 6-phosphate and methanol. When transformed with plasmid pAP2 encoding the K. pneumoniae genes aglB and aglA (an α-glucoside-specific transporter AglA (IICBAgl)), strain MG-1655 (pAP2) metabolized a variety of other α-linked glucosides, including maltitol, isomaltose, and the following five isomers of sucrose: trehalulose α(1→1), turanose α(1→3), maltulose α(1→4), leucrose α(1→5), and palatinose α(1→6). Remarkably, MG-1655 (pAP2) failed to metabolize sucrose α(1→2). The E. coli K12 strain ZSC112L (ptsG::cat manXYZ nagE glk lac) can neither grow on glucose nor transport methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside. However, when transformed with pTSGH11 (encoding ptsG) or pAP2, this organism provided membranes that contained either the PtsG or AglA transporters, respectively. In vitro complementation of transporter-specific membranes with purified general phosphotransferase components showed that although PtsG and AglA recognized glucose and methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside, only AglA accepted other α-d-glucosides as substrates. Complementation experiments also revealed that IIAGlc was required for functional activity of both PtsG and AglA transporters. We conclude that AglA, AglB, and IIAGlc are necessary and sufficient for growth of E. coli K12 on methyl-α-d-glucoside and related α-d-glucopyranosides.

Fortuitously (but importantly), α-MGlc is not metabolized by Escherichia coli K12, and transport data were interpretable without the ambiguities caused by further catabolism of the accumulated sugar. Early studies of α-MGlc uptake by cells of E. coli introduced the “permease” concept to bacterial physiologists, and “active transport” was incorporated in the lexicon of microbial energetics (1Hoffee P.

Bacteriol. 1962; 84: 877-881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) unexpectedly found that the glucose analog was recoverable from cells in both free and phosphorylated form. An understanding of these observations awaited the serendipitous discovery, and subsequent biochemical dissection, of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar:phosphotransferase system (PEP-PTS; EC 2.7.1.69) by Roseman and co-workers (6Kundig W. Ghosh S. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 52: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 7Roseman S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 63: 3-11Google Scholar). The multicomponent PEP-PTS includes membrane-localized, sugar-specific transporters (enzymes IICB) that are fused or associated with a third domain (IIA) and two general cytoplasmic proteins (enzyme I and HPr). Collectively, these interactive components constitute a phospho-relay that (in five sequential stages) transfers the high energy phosphoryl moiety from PEP to catalyze the simultaneous phosphorylation and translocation of sugars through the cytoplasmic membrane (for reviews of PTS functions and nomenclature see Refs. 8Meadow N.D.

Completion of the chromosomal DNA sequence of E. coli K12 strain MG-1655 in 1997 (15Blattner F.R. Plunkett G. III. Bloch Perna C.A. Burland N.T. Riley V. Collado-Vides M. Glasner J. Rode J.D.

Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (5935) Google Scholar), confirmed that ptsG encodes one (IICBGlc/PtsG) of two glucose-specific PTS transporters, whereas the genes for the general proteins and IIAGlc reside within a separate ptsHIcrr operon. After the discovery of other PEP-PT systems, it became apparent that α-MGlc was a reasonably specific substrate for the PtsG transporter in E. coli. Subsequently (16Gachelin G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 16: 342-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Haguenauer R. Képés A. Biochimie (Paris). 1971; 53: 99-107Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 18Haguenauer R. Képés A.

Our interest in the transport and bactericidal effects of α-MGlc(6P) in E. coli K12 stems from the fact that Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 23357 (a taxonomically close relative) readily ferments α-MGlc as an energy source for growth. Furthermore, and again in contrast with E. coli K12 strains, K. pneumoniae also metabolizes the following five O-α-linked isomers of sucrose: trehalulose, turanose, maltulose, leucrose, and palatinose (20Thompson J. Robrish S.A. Pikis A. Brust A. Lichtenthaler F.W. Carbohydr. Res. 2001; 331: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Thompson J. Robrish S.A. Immel S. Lichtenthaler F.W. Hall B.G.

We suggested that the three genes encode (in order), a transcriptional regulatory protein (AglR), an α-glucoside PTS transporter AglA (IICBAgl Swiss-Prot accession number Q9AGA7), and an Mn2+/NAD+-dependent phospho-α-glucosidase AglB (EC 3.2.1.122; Swiss-Prot accession number Q9AGA6). A potential pathway for transport and metabolism of α-glucosides in K. pneumoniae is illustrated in Fig. 1, right. However, findings in previous articles (21Thompson J. Robrish S.A. Immel S. Lichtenthaler F.W. Hall B.G. Pikis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37415-37425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Pikis A. Immel S. Robrish S.A. Thompson J. Microbiology (Read.). 2002; 148: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) gave rise to two concerns. First, the proposed operon lacked a gene encoding IIAAgl, the third phosphorylatable protein required for PTSAgl activity. To compensate for this deficiency, we suggested IIAGlc as a likely substitute for functional complementation of PTSAgl activity in K. pneumoniae. Second, but equally disconcerting, was the fact that we had failed to obtain physical evidence for AglA in membranes of organisms grown previously on the various α-glucosides. Although unlikely (because of the adjacent loci of aglA and aglB), we could not discount the possibility that a quite separate PTS mediated the translocation of these carbohydrates in K. pneumoniae. In attempting to resolve these issues, consideration of the “old” problem of α-MGlc toxicity in E. coli, combined with current knowledge of the dissimilation of α-d-glucosides in K. pneumoniae, led us to propose the following hypotheses. For hypothesis I, the transfer and expression of the gene aglB from K. pneumoniae to E. coli K12 should eliminate α-MGlc6P toxicity by catalyzing the hydrolysis of this compound to yield fermentable Glc6P and methanol. For hypothesis II, transfer and expression of both aglA and aglB genes from K. pneumoniae should permit growth of E. coli K12 transformants on all α-linked glucosides, including α-MGlc and the isomers of sucrose. For hypothesis III, the in vitro complementation of membranes of E. coli K12 containing AglA (IICBAgl), with purified IIAGlc, HPr, and EI, should yield a functional PTSAgl. These hypotheses have been tested using strains of E. coli K12 containing appropriate mutations or genetic deletions. Our findings, obtained via gene cloning, plasmid transformation, and in vitro PTS complementation experiments, are presented in this communication. Materials—High purity sugars, including glucose, sucrose (α-d-glucopyranosyl β-d-fructofuranoside, α(1→2) linkage), maltose (4-O-α-d-glucopyranosyl-d-glucopyranose), and 1-O-methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside, were purchased from Pfanstiehl Laboratories, Inc. Maltitol (4-O-α-glucopyranosyl-d-sorbitol) and isomaltose (6-O-α-d-glucopyranosyl-d-glucose) were from Sigma and TCI America, respectively. The five linkage isomers of sucrose were obtained from the following sources: trehalulose was a generous gift from Südzucker, Germany; turanose was from Pfanstiehl Laboratories; maltulose was from TCI America; leucrose was from Fluka; and palatinose was purchased from Wako Chemicals. The chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates, p-nitrophenyl α-d-glucopyranoside 6-phosphate (pNPαGlc6P) and 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-d-glucopyranoside 6-phosphate (4MUαGlc6P), respectively, were prepared by phosphorylation of the parent compounds with phosphorus oxychloride in trimethyl phosphate containing small proportions of water (23Thompson J. Gentry-Weeks C.R. Nguyen N.Y. Folk J.E. Robrish S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2505-2512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The preparations of phosphorylated sucrose isomers and other α-d-glucoside 6-phosphates have been described previously (20Thompson J. Robrish S.A. Pikis A. Brust A. Lichtenthaler F.W. Carbohydr. Res. 2001; 331: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Enzymes, including glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase/hexokinase (EC 1.1.1.49/EC 2.7.1.1) and phosphoglucose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9), were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Phosphoenolpyruvate NAD+, NADP+, pNPαGlc, 4MUαGlc, and other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against purified phospho-α-glucosidase (MalH) from Fusobacterium mortiferum (23Thompson J. Gentry-Weeks C.R. Nguyen N.Y. Folk J.E. Robrish S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2505-2512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was prepared by Covance Research Products. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—K. pneumoniae (ATCC 23357) and E. coli K12 strain MG-1655 (ATCC 47076) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA. E. coli K12 ZSC112L (ΔptsG::cat manXYZ nagE glk lac) was from the culture collection of the Erni laboratory. This strain (abbreviated ZSC112L in this study) carries a chromosomal deletion of ptsG, such that recombination between the plasmid-encoded ptsG gene and inactive chromosomal alleles is precluded. Plasmid pTSGH11 encodes lacI and, under the control of Ptac, a ptsG allele for the IICBGlc transporter attached to a C-terminal His tag. Construction of plasmids pAP1 and pAP2, carrying genes aglB alone or both aglA and aglB, respectively, are described below. Growth of Organisms—Batch cultures of organisms (10-ml or 1-liter volumes) were grown with vigorous aeration on a rotary shaker (200 rpm; 37 °C) in a medium described previously by Sapico et al. (24Sapico V. Hanson T.E. Walter R.W. Anderson R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 96: 51-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for growth of K. pneumoniae. This defined medium (designated SM), contained per liter: 7.1 g of Na2HPO4; 1.5 g of KH2PO4; 3 g of (NH4)2SO4; 0.1 g of MgSO4·7H2O, and 5 mg of FeSO4·7H2O. Filter-sterilized sugars were added to autoclaved medium (pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 0. 4% (w/v). In some instances, LB broth and M9 minimal medium (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1989; (2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar) were used for growth studies of different transformants. Ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was included in media as required. Construction of pAP1 and Expression of aglB in E. coli MG-1655—Using information from the incomplete genome sequence of K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae MGH 78578 (Washington University Genome Sequencing Center, St. Louis) and previously published data (21Thompson J. Robrish S.A. Immel S. Lichtenthaler F.W. Hall B.G. Pikis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37415-37425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the following pair of primers was designed to amplify aglB: forward primer KPBF, 5′-CCCACCATGGGCAGTATCATG-3′ (the aglB sequence is in boldface and the NcoI restriction site is underlined); reverse primer KPBR, 5′-CCCAGAATTCTTAATGCAGCTCAGG-3′ (the sequence complementary to the downstream region of aglB is in boldface, and the EcoRI restriction site is underlined). PCR amplification was performed using high fidelity Pfu DNA polymerase. The amplified 1.3-kbp DNA fragment was digested with restriction endonucleases NcoI and EcoRI, respectively, electrophoresed through 1% agarose gel, and purified (QIAquick gel extraction kit). The 1.3-kb fragment was ligated into the similarly digested and purified expression vector pSE380 (Invitrogen) to yield plasmid pAP1. In this construct, the aglB gene is also under control of the trc promoter, and expression of AglB is induced in the presence of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The recombinant plasmid was electroporated into the cells, and transformants MG-1655 (pAP1) were selected on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Construction of pAP2 and Expression of aglA and aglB in MG-1655—The following primer pairs were designed to amplify a fragment of DNA encoding adjacent genes aglA and aglB from chromosomal DNA of K. pneumoniae 23357: forward primer KP3, 5′-CGCACTCGAGCATGCTCAGTCAAATACAACGC-3′ (aglA sequence is in boldface, and the XhoI restriction site is underlined); reverse primer KP4, 5′-CCCAGAATTCTTAATGCAGCTCAGGCCAG-3′ (sequence complementary to the downstream region of aglB is in boldface, and the EcoRI site is underlined). Amplification was carried out using high fidelity Pfu DNA polymerase from Stratagene. The components of the amplification mixture were as follows: 100 ng of DNA, 1× reaction buffer provided by the manufacturer, 20 mm each of the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 250 ng of each primer, 5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase, and 1% (v/v) Me2SO in a total volume of 100 μl. Amplification was performed in a thermal cycler (GeneAmp PCR System 9700, PE Applied Biosystems). After a 2-min period of incubation at 95 °C, the mixture was subjected to five cycles under the following conditions: denaturation at 95 °C, 1 min; annealing at 50 °C, 1 min, and extension at 62 °C for 2 min/kb of insert. These five cycles were followed by 30 cycles under the following conditions: denaturation at 95 °C, 1 min; annealing at 58 °C, 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min/kb of insert. This procedure was followed by a 10-min runoff at 72 °C. The amplicon was digested with restriction endonucleases (XhoI and EcoRI), electrophoresed in 1% agarose gel, and purified (QIAquick gel extraction kit). The purified PCR product (∼3 kbp) was ligated to the similarly digested and purified pTrcHis2B expression vector (Invitrogen) to form the recombinant plasmid pTrcHis2B aglAaglB. In this construct, the aglA and aglB genes are under control of the trc promoter, which is also regulated by the lacO operator and the product of lacIq gene. Expression of aglA and aglB products is induced by addition of IPTG to the cultures. The recombinant plasmid (pTrcHis2B aglAaglB) was transferred by electroporation, and transformants MG-1655 (pAP2) were selected on Luria-Bertani agar plates containing 150 μg/ml ampicillin. It should be noted that in the pTrcHis2B vector the fusion peptide is located at the C terminus, rather than the N terminus as is the case in pTrcHis vectors. Additionally, the stop codon included in our reverse primer also prevents expression of the fusion peptide in pTrcHis2B vector. Sequencing Procedure—Sequencing was accomplished by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using the Sequenase 7-deazadGTP sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and α-35S-dATP for labeling. Sequences were assembled, edited, and analyzed with the MacVector sequence analysis package. Preparation of Cell Extracts—Stationary phase cultures were harvested by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 min at 5 °C), and the cells were washed by resuspension and centrifugation from 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm NAD+, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (designated TMND buffer). The various cell pellets (3–4 g wet weight/liter) were homogenized in 2.5 volumes of TMND buffer, and organisms were disrupted (twice for 1.5-min periods of oscillation at 0 °C) in a Branson model 350 sonifier operating at ∼75% of maximum power. The preparations were centrifuged (180,000 × g for 2 h at 5 °C), and the clarified high speed supernatant fluids were transferred to small tubes, frozen in dry ice, and stored at –20 °C until required for enzymatic analyses and electrophoresis experiments. Assays of NAD+/Mn2+-dependent AglB Activity—The activity of AglB (phospho-α-glucosidase) in extracts from cells of MG-1655, MG-1655 (pAP1), and MG-1655 (pAP2) was measured using chromogenic pNPαGlc6P as substrate. Enzyme activity was determined in a discontinuous assay that contained (in 2 ml) 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm NAD+, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm pNPαGlc6P. After equilibration to temperature (37 °C), the reactions were started by addition of 15 μl of cell extract (350–400 μg of protein), and enzyme activity was followed as described previously (26Thompson J. Pikis A. Ruvinov S.B. Henrissat B. Yamamoto H. Sekiguchi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27347-27356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Absorbance was measured at 400nm, and the rates of pNP formation were calculated from progress plots, assuming a molar extinction ϵ = 18,300 m–1 cm–1 for the (yellow) p-nitrophenolate anion. AglB activity was expressed as nanomoles of pNP formed (pNPαGlc6P hydrolyzed) min–1 mg protein–1. A continuous spectrophotometric method (27Thompson J. Hess S. Pikis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1553-1561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was used to follow hydrolysis of α-glucoside-6-P substrates. This glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase/NADP+-coupled assay monitors the release of Glc6P, and the 1-ml assay contained the following: 0.1 m HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm NAD+, 1 mm NADP+, 10 mm DTT, 2 mm appropriate substrate, and 3 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase/hexokinase. Reactions were initiated by addition of 50 μl of cell extract (1–1.2 mg of total protein), and the increase in A340 nm was followed in a Beckman DU 640 recording spectrophotometer. Initial rates of Glc6P formation were determined using the kinetics program of the instrument. A molar extinction coefficient ϵ = 6,220 m –1cm–1 was assumed for calculations of NADPH formed (Glc6P released). AglB activity was expressed as nanomoles of substrate hydrolyzed min–1 mg protein–1. Electrophoresis Procedures and in Situ Detection of AglB Activity—Native (nondenaturing) electrophoresis and SDS-PAGE experiments were carried out in the Novex X-Cell mini system as described previously (26Thompson J. Pikis A. Ruvinov S.B. Henrissat B. Yamamoto H. Sekiguchi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27347-27356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 27Thompson J. Hess S. Pikis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1553-1561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). When polypeptide-containing slices were to be excised for tryptic digestion and LC-MS/MS, the SDS-polyacrylamide gels were fixed, stained with Colloidal Blue staining kit (Invitrogen), and destained in distilled water. Western (immuno)blot detection of AglB was achieved by sequential incubation of the membrane with (a) polyclonal antibody to phospho-α-glucosidase (MalH; EC 3.2.1.122) from F. mortiferum, and (b) goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (23Thompson J. Gentry-Weeks C.R. Nguyen N.Y. Folk J.E. Robrish S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2505-2512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For in situ detection of AglB activity, cell extracts were electrophoresed under nonreducing conditions (at 10 °C) in precast Tris-glycine (8%) gels. The running buffer for these experiments (Tris-glycine buffer (pH 8.3)) was supplemented with 1 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm NAD+, and 1 mm DTT to maintain enzyme activity. Immediately after electrophoresis, the gel was immersed in 30 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm NAD+, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm of fluorogenic substrate (4MUαGlc6P). After ∼5 min of incubation at room temperature, the gel was photographed under UV light (366 nm, 20s exposure) using a Nikon D70 digital camera equipped with a green filter. Preparation and Solubilization of Cell Membranes—Strains MG-1655, MG-1655 (pAP1), and MG-1655 (pAP2) were grown in 1-liter volumes of SM containing glucose as energy source and ampicillin when appropriate. The organisms were harvested and washed, and sonicated preparations (∼10 ml) were centrifuged at low speed (Sorvall RC2B, 5000 × g for 5 min at 5 °C) to precipitate debris and intact cells. The supernatant fluids were collected and subjected to ultracentrifugation (180,000 × g for 2 h at 5 °C). After removal of the clarified supernatants, each of the small orange/brown pellets was resuspended in 5 ml of a solution containing 10 mm Tris-glycine buffer (pH 9.3), 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% (w/v) N-decyl-β-d-maltopyranoside. The suspensions were placed on a rotary mixer in a cold room (overnight), and insoluble residues were removed by high speed ultracentrifugation. The clear supernatant fluids containing solubilized membrane proteins were retained for analysis by SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional electrophoresis. Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)—Coomassie-stained bands were excised from SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were digested robotically with trypsin (Mass PREP™ Station, Waters, Milford, MA). An aliquot of the tryptic peptides (1 pmol) was separated by LC-MS/MS. A micromass CapLC QTOF2 system (Micromass/Waters, Manchester, UK) consisting of a CapLC, an autosampler, and a QTOF2 mass spectrometer were used. MassLynx software was used for data acquisition and processing. The instrument was calibrated with a [Glu]fibrinopeptide standard. Tryptic peptides were concentrated online on a Waters Symmetry 300 C18 5-μm trap column and, after a 10-min delay, were directed onto a Vydac C18 reversed phase column (100 × 0.15 mm inner diameter). Peptides were separated (65 min; flow rate 1 ml min–1) with a gradient comprising solvent A (98.8% water, 1% acetonitrile, 0.2% formic acid) and solvent B (98.8% acetonitrile, 1% water, 0.2% formic acid). Argon was used as the collision gas, and nitrogen gas was used to assist nebulization and desolvation. Acetonitrile, water of high pressure liquid chromatography gradient grade quality, and formic acid (96%) ACS grade were supplied by Sigma. Preparation of Membranes from ZSC112L (pTSGH11) and ZSC112L (pAP2)—Transformants were grown in 250 ml of LB with requisite antibiotics on a rotary shaker at 37 °C. At A600 nm = 0.9, protein expression was elicited by addition of 0.5 mm IPTG, and growth was continued for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (5800 × g; 5 °C; 15 min), and the cell pellet was resuspended to a volume of 4 ml in buffer E (30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Cells were disrupted by two passages through a French pressure cell. Intact cells and debris were removed by low speed centrifugation (12,000 × g; 4 °C; 10 min), and membrane fractions were collected by ultracentrifugation (350,000 × g; 4 °C; 10 min). The membrane pellets were homogenized in 500 μl of buffer E, and protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry procedure. The protein concentrations of the pAP2 and pTSGH11 membrane preparations were 25 and 32 mg/ml, respectively. Assay and in Vitro Complementation of PEP-PTS Activities—PTS-catalyzed in vitro phosphorylation of sugars was determined by ion exchange, using [U-14C]glucose, α-[U-14C]MGlc, or [U-14C]maltose as substrates. The “mastermix” used for the PTS assays contained the following: 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm NaF, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm PEP, 0.5 mm 14C-labeled sugar (1000 dpm/nmol) and the following purified PTS components: EI (0.5 μl; 34.6 μm); HPr (2.4 μl; 277 μm); and IIAGlc (5 μl; 4.7 μm). The reaction was started by the addition of (20–100-fold prediluted) membrane suspension to 95 μl of mastermix. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, free and phosphorylated sugars were separated by anion exchange chromatography (AG-1-X2, 50–100 mesh; Bio-Rad), and radioa"

It is an essential subunit required for the transcription of nuclear genes, but the detailed mechanism including its interactions with different subunits and oligonucleotides remains largely unclear. Herein, we report the three-dimensional structure of human RPB8 (hRPB8) at high resolution determined by NMR spectroscopy. The protein fold comprises an eight-stranded β-barrel, six short helices, and a large unstructured Ω-loop. The overall structure of hRPB8 is similar to that of yRPB8 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and belongs to the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold. However, several features of the tertiary structures are notably different between the two proteins. In particular, hRPB8 has a more clustered positively charged binding interface with the largest subunit RPB1 of the RNA polymerases. We employed biochemical methods to detect its interactions with different single-stranded DNA sequences. In addition, single-stranded DNA titration experiments were performed to identify the residues involved in nonspecific binding with different DNA sequences. Furthermore, we characterized the millisecond time scale conformational flexibility of hRPB8 upon its binding to single-stranded DNA. The current results demonstrate that hRPB8 interacts with single-stranded DNA nonspecifically and adopts significant conformational changes, and the hRPB8/single-stranded DNA complex is a fast exchanging system.

The three eukaryotic RNA polymerases (RNAPs) 2The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; OB, oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; h, human. consist of a number of subunits and play central roles in the transcription of nuclear genes (1Reeder R.H.

Transcription is regulated by protein interactions between the subunits and/or transcription factors during the initiation, elongation, and termination processes. Although extensive studies have been performed in probing the structures and functions of transcription factors, limited knowledge is available about the structures and modes of regulation of the RNAPs. In eukaryotic cells, five subunits (RPB5, RPB6, RPB8, RPB10α, and RPB10β) are conserved in all the three RNAPs, which play essential roles for cell viability (4Woychik N.A. Liao S.-M. Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 5Archambault J. Friesen J.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 703-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure and function of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNAP II is the most extensively studied (6Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Fu J. Gnatt A.L. Maier-Davis B. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Edwards A.M.

Cell. 2002; 108: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In the case of human RNAPs, only the structures of hRPB6 and hRPB4/hRPB7 subunits have been reported thus far (11del Rio-Portilla F. Gaskell A. Gilbert D. Ladias J.A. Wagner G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1039-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 12Meka H. Werner F. Cordell S.C. Onesti S. Brick P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6435-6444Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). RPB8 (hRPB8 or hRPABC17 in human) is a common subunit in all the three types of eukaryotic RNAPs but is absent in both prokaryotes and archaebacteria (13Krapp S. Kelly G. Reischl J. Weinzierl R.O. Matthews S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14Briand J.F. Navarro F. Rematier P. Boschiero C. Labarre S. Werner M. Shpakovski G.V. Thuriaux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6056-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), suggesting that it represents a unique feature in the eukaryotic transcription machinery. This subunit is highly conserved throughout the evolution and plays an essential role in eukaryotic cells (4Woychik N.A. Liao S.-M. Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 5Archambault J. Friesen J.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 703-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 1014-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Although little is known about the exact function of the RPB8 subunit in transcription, the fact that RPB8 is one of the small subunits present in all three types of eukaryotic RNAPs suggests that it might be important for common characteristics shared by all RNAPs such as transcriptional efficiency, nuclear localization, enzyme stability, and coordinate regulation of rRNA, mRNA, and tRNA synthesis (4Woychik N.A. Liao S.-M. Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Homology analysis indicates that hRPB8 shares about 33% sequence identity with the S. cerevisiae homologue yRPB8 (or yRPABC14.5), which structurally belongs to the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) fold and was proposed to be involved in single-stranded oligonucleotide binding (13Krapp S. Kelly G. Reischl J. Weinzierl R.O. Matthews S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, no experimental evidence of the oligonucleotide binding activity has been presented thus far. Previous studies demonstrated that hRPB8 could complement yRPB8 mutant in S. cerevisiae (16Shpakovski G.V. Acker J. Wintzerith M. Lacroix J.F. Thuriaux P. Vigneron M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4702-4710Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 17McKune K. Moore P.A. Hull M.W. Woychik N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6895-6900Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), suggesting strong conservations in both structure and function of RPB8 from yeast to human. However, differences still exist between the two homologues because a temperature-sensitive growth defect on the complementation of yRPB8 with hRPB8 was observed (16Shpakovski G.V. Acker J. Wintzerith M. Lacroix J.F. Thuriaux P. Vigneron M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4702-4710Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 17McKune K. Moore P.A. Hull M.W. Woychik N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6895-6900Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To better understand its role in the molecular architecture and biological function of the human RNAPs, the three-dimensional structure of hRPB8 must be known. Herein, we present the solution structure of hRPB8 at high resolution using NMR spectroscopy. In addition, we performed biochemical and NMR titration experiments to characterize its interaction with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Moreover, the internal dynamics provided insights into the millisecond time scale conformational fluctuations of this subunit upon its nonspecific binding to ssDNA. Expression and Purification of Recombinant hRPB8—The hRPB8 gene was cloned into pET24a expression vector and expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) strain (Novagen). The culture was grown in LB medium, centrifuged, and resuspended in M9 minimal medium with antibiotics and 15NH4Cl in the presence or absence of 13C6-glucose for preparation of 13C/15N-labeled or 15N-labeled sample, respectively. The hRPB8 protein was purified by ion exchange chromatography (DEAE) and subsequently gel filtration (Superdex-75) using an ÄKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). The purity was determined to be greater than 95% as judged by SDS-PAGE. NMR samples were prepared with 1.0 mm hRPB8 in a buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate and 10 mm dithiothreitol (pH 6.2) in 95% H2O, 5% D2O. Gel Shift Analysis—Gel shift experiments using both native PAGE and agarose gel electrophoresis were performed to characterize the interactions of hRPB8 with different ssDNA sequences. The native PAGE was performed at a constant electronic current of 8 mA at 4 °C. The concentration of hRPB8 was 0.3 μm, and that of ssDNA varied from 0.06 to 0.6 μm. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The DNA electrophoresis using agarose gel was performed at 25 °C. The ssDNA fragments were kept at a constant concentration of 0.01 μm, and that of hRPB8 varied from 0.005 to 0.05 μm. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide. The ssDNA sequences used in the experiment were 5′-CCGATATTGATTTTTCG-3′ and 5′-CTGGTGTCTCG-3′. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed using the BIAcore 3000 system (Biacore AB) to detect the interactions between hRPB8 and ssDNA and to determine the thermodynamic constants. Recombinant hRPB8 was diluted in a buffer containing 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 3.5) and immobilized onto a BIAcore sensor chip CM5 as recommended by the manufacturer. The final active hRPB8 concentration was determined to be 0.5 μM. The ssDNA sequence of 5′-CCGATATTGATTTTTCG-3′ with various concentrations (0.1, 0.15, 0.3, 0.45, 0.6, 0.65, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 1.0, and 1.3 mm) and that of 5′-TAATGTTAGAAAAGCGT-3′ with different concentrations (0.083, 0.17, 0.33, 0.50, 0.67, 0.83, 1.0, and 1.3 mm) were dissolved in the elution buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.2) for binding analysis by SPR. These ssDNA sequences were used for different projects in this laboratory and were randomly selected for the experiment. The measurements were performed at 25 °C, with a flow rate of 30 μl/min. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant KD was determined by curve fitting of the steady state binding level as a function of the ssDNA concentration using Equation 1, Req=C·Rmax/(KD+C·n(Eq. 1) where Req is the steady state binding level, Rmax is the theoretical binding capacity, C is the concentration of ssDNA, and n specifies the number of averaged binding sites on one analyte molecule (18BIAevaluation 4.0 Software Handbook (2003) Biacore AB 2, Uppsala, Sweden.Google Scholar). All of the data were fitted with a nonlinear least square method using BIAevaluation 4.0 software following the manufacturer's instructions. The fitting was tested by using different values of n and examined by F tests. NMR Spectroscopy—The NMR experiments were carried out at 30 °C on Bruker Avance 500- and 800-MHz spectrometers equipped with four RF channels and triple-resonance probes with pulsed field gradients. The chemical shifts were referenced to internal 2,2-dimethyl-2-silap-entanesulfonic acid. Two-dimensional 15N- and 13C-edited heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) and three-dimensional HNCA, HNCO, HNCACB, HBHA(CO)NH, CBCA(CO)NH, (H)CC(CO)NH-TOCSY, (H)CCH-COSY, and 15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC (mixing time, 80 ms) experiments were performed to obtain the backbone and side chain assignments (19Kay L.E. Ikura M. Tshudin R. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 89: 496-514Google Scholar, 20Wittekind M. Müller L. J. Magn. Reson. 1993; B101: 201-205Crossref Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 21Grzesiek S. Bax A. J.

The three-dimensional 15N- and 13C-edited NOE-HSQC spectra (mixing times, 50 and 100 ms) were collected to confirm the assignments and generate distance restraints for structure calculations. The three-dimensional HNHA experiment was recorded to obtain the dihedral angle restraints (24Kuboniwa H. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). A series of hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments were collected to obtain hydrogen bonding information. All NMR spectra were processed using the program NMRPipe (25Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) and analyzed using the program NMRView (26Johnson B.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 313-352PubMed Google Scholar). Structure Calculations—The structure calculations were performed using the program package CYANA (27Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar) and refined by AMBER (28Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.R. Cheatham T.E. III Ferguson Seibel D. Kollman G.P. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2689) Google Scholar). Distance restraints were derived from the inter-proton NOE. Dihedral angles (φ and Ψ) were determined from backbone chemical shifts using TALOS (29Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar), and φ angles were confirmed by the HNHA experiment (24Kuboniwa H. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bond restraints were obtained from the hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments and intermediate range NOEs in combination with the secondary structural information. Two hundred structures were calculated by CYANA, and the 100 lowest energy structures were used as initial structures and refined using AMBER. Finally, the 20 lowest energy structures were selected to represent the hRPB8 subunit. The final structures were analyzed using the program packages MOLMOL (30Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 29-32Crossref Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) and PROCHECK_NMR (31Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 51-55Crossref Scopus (4474) Google Scholar). ssDNA Titration Experiments—The ssDNA titration experiments were performed and monitored by a series of two-dimensional 15N-edited HSQC experiments. The spectra were collected on a Bruker Avance 800 MHz NMR spectrometer at 30 °C. The hRPB8 sample for structure determinations was used, and the ssDNA sequences used in the titration experiments were 5′-CCGATATTGATTTTTCG-3′ and 5′-TAATGTTAGAAAAGCGT-3′, respectively. The molar ratio of ssDNA to hRPB8 protein ranged from 0.2 to 3.0. Measurements of Conformational Exchanges—The transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy based relaxation compensated Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill pulse sequence was used to characterize the conformational exchanges on the millisecond time scale (32Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12366-12371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 33Loria J.P. Rance M. III PalmerA.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 2331-2332Crossref Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The measurements were performed on a Bruker Avance 800 MHz NMR spectrometer at 30 °C. Spectral widths of 8802.8 Hz for 1H and 1986.8 Hz for 15N were used. The experiments were performed by measuring the peak intensities with the relaxation delay of 40 ms using different τcp values of 1 and 10 ms, where τcp is the delay between 15N 180° pulses in the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill pulse train. Theoretically, the peak intensities are independent of the τcp values if there is no chemical or conformational exchange involved (33Loria J.P. Rance M. III PalmerA.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 2331-2332Crossref Scopus (568) Google Scholar). In case the residue is involved in conformational exchange on the observed time scale (0.5-5 ms in the current study), the peak intensities decrease with increasing τcp values because of the shortened transverse relaxation time constant. Therefore, the conformational exchanges were determined by comparing the peak intensities at different τcp values. Forty-eight transients were collected for each experiment. For each τcp value, the measurements were repeated three times to estimate the experimental uncertainties and confirm the extracted conformational exchanges. The Rex value reflecting the conformational exchanges is defined by Rex = (I1ms - I10ms)/I1ms, where I1ms and I10ms are the averaged peak intensities when τcp equals 1 and 10 ms. Biochemical Characterizations of the hRPB8 Subunit—The nonspecific DNA binding is an important feature of RNAPs and plays essential roles during the basal transcription processes. We performed the SPR measurements to probe the interactions between hRPB8 and ssDNA sequences and further determine the thermodynamic constants. As shown in Fig. 1, the results clearly indicate that hRPB8 interacts with the two ssDNA sequences in a similar manner, demonstrating the nonspecific binding. In addition, the sensorgrams (Fig. 1, A and C) suggest that the interaction between hRPB8 and ssDNA involves fast association and dissociation. The SPR data were fitted using models with different values of n (see “Experimental Procedures”). The F test results strongly favored n = 1 and suggested that hRPB8 binds with ssDNA by the molar ratio of 1:1. Subsequently, the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant KD values extracted from the SPR analysis (Fig. 1, B and D) were ∼0.7 ± 0.1 and 1.2 ± 0.1 mm for the two ssDNA sequences, respectively. The binding of hRPB8 with different ssDNA sequences and lengths was also analyzed by gel shift assays using both native PAGE and agarose gel electrophoresis. Fig. 2 (A and B) show the native PAGE analysis of hRPB8/ssDNA interaction. The protein concentration was fixed, whereas the DNA concentration varied. The formation of the hRPB8·ssDNA complex gradually increased with the increase of the DNA concentration. Fig. 2 (C and D) show the agarose gel analysis of hRPB8/ssDNA interaction. The DNA concentration remained constant, whereas the protein concentration was changed. The results were similar to the protein electrophoresis using native PAGE. Different lengths and sequences of ssDNA were used, and the results clearly indicated that hRPB8 binds ssDNA in a sequence-independent manner. In addition, the gel electrophoresis demonstrated that upon hRPB8 binding to ssDNA, only a single form of complex was formed. Therefore, the SPR analysis and gel shift assays strongly indicate the nonspecific binding of hRPB8 with ssDNA sequences. This result is also supported by the ssDNA titration experiments probed by NMR spectroscopy (see below). Solution Structure of the hRPB8 Subunit—By using the triple-resonance NMR spectra described above, more than 90% of the chemical shift assignments for backbone and side chain atoms of hRPB8 were obtained, with the exception of residues Leu5, Leu6, Val43, Asn44, Val50, Leu52, Gly53, Ala61, Val91, Met92, Tyr118, Gly120, and Leu121. A table containing the chemical shift assignments of 1H, 13C, and 15N atoms has been deposited in the BioMagResBank data base under accession number 7020. The two-dimensional 15N-edited HSQC spectrum showing the 1H and 15N resonance assignments of hRPB8 is shown in Fig. 3. The hRPB8 structure has been determined using the inter-proton NOE-derived distance restraints in combination with the dihedral angle and hydrogen bond restraints. The 20 superimposed representative structures, together with the ribbon diagram of the energy-minimized mean structure of hRPB8, are shown in Fig. 4. The structural statistics for hRPB8 are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Structural statistics of hRPB8Distance restraints Intraresidue unambiguous NOEs883 Sequential unambiguous NOEs589 Medium range unambiguous NOEs180 Long range unambiguous NOEs369 Total unambiguous NOEs2021 Total ambiguous NOEs867 Dihedral angles (φ and ψ)89 Hydrogen bonds42 S-S bond0Root mean square deviation from mean structure Secondary structure backbone atoms0.62 ± 0.15 Secondary structure heavy atoms1.23 ± 0.21 All backbone atoms2.60 ± 0.41 All heavy atoms2.99 ± 0.43Energy (kcal/mol) Mean AMBER energy–8116.43 ± 8.24 NOE distance restraint violation energy22.33 ± 1.03 Torsion angle restraint violation energy2.56 ± 0.22 Restraint violations Distance (>0.3 Å)1 Dihedral angle (>5°)7Ramachandran statistics Residues in most favored regions (%)75.6 Residues in additional allowed regions (%)21.8 Residues in generously allowed regions (%)1.8 Residues in disallowed regions (%)0.8 Open table in a new tab The hRPB8 protein comprises an eight-stranded β-barrel with a shear number of nine β-strands (β1, 6-17; β2, 25-32; β3, 38-44; β4, 56-61; β5, 90-92; β6, 94-97 β7, 112-118; β8, 121-127; and β9, 143-147) and six 310 helical regions (H1, 20-23; H2, 45-48; H3, 64-66; H4, 99-102; H5, 129-132; and H6, 137-140). As shown in Fig. 4 (A-D), the core of hRPB8 adopts a compact OB fold structure consisting of an eight-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel surrounded by six short helices. In addition, hRPB8 contains a large unstructured flexible region (Ω-loop) with 23 residues (residue 67-89), which was proposed to be dispensable in the previous studies (34Voutsina A. Riva M. Carles C. Alexandraki D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1047-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The overall backbone root mean square deviation from the mean structure is 2.60 ± 0.41 Å, and that of the regular secondary structural elements is 0.62 ± 0.15 Å after excluding the residues at the C terminus and those in the large unstructured Ω-loop. The residues in regions 16-25, 60-88, 100-110, 132-136 and those near the C terminus showed a certain degree of motional flexibility, which was reflected by the fewer NOE-derived distance restraints and bigger root mean square deviation values than that of the well structured regions. This fact was further demonstrated by the low {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOEs (supplemental material). Such a structural feature of the hRPB8 subunit suggests that the unstructured loops adopt significant conformational exchanges. Notably, all 11 aromatic side chains are on the solvent exposed surface. Moreover, the basic and hydrophobic residues are mostly highly conserved on the proposed oligonucleotide-binding surface within the RPB8 sequences (Fig. 5A). Structural Comparison with yRPB8—An overlay of the Cα trace of hRPB8 with that of yRPB8 (Protein Data Bank entry 1A1D) is shown in Fig. 4 (E and F). The root mean square deviation between the solution structures of hRPB8 and yRPB8 is 1.76 Å for 51 pairs of Cα atoms determined using DALI (35Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar) in the secondary structural elements. Overall, both proteins share a similar OB fold. However, certain features of the tertiary structures are notably different between the two proteins. A comparison of the electrostatic potential of the putative oligonucleotide-binding surface of hRPB8 and yRPB8 (Fig. 5, B and E) shows that hRPB8 has a more positively charged surface than that of yRPB8, and the positive charges are more clustered on strands β7 and β8. Based on the crystal structure of yeast RNAP II complex (Protein Data Bank entry 1WCM), the interaction surface of RPB8 with the largest subunit RPB1 can be identified to include helix H2, part of the Ω-loop and β-strands 5-8 (as numbered in our structure). The different charge distributions on β7 and β8 of these two homologues may be adapted to the structural and charge differences of their binding partners, hRPB1 and yRPB1. In addition, the conserved GGLLM motif shared by RPB8 subunits was identified as the core-binding surface with the relatively conserved PXIXKPXXLWXGKQ motif in RPB1 (6Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Fu J. Gnatt A.L. Maier-Davis B. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Edwards A.M. David P.R. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2000; 288: 640-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 7Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 14Briand J.F. Navarro F. Rematier P. Boschiero C. Labarre S. Werner M. Shpakovski G.V. Thuriaux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6056-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A comparison of the electrostatic potential near the GGLLM motif indicates that this region is less negatively charged and more hydrophobic in hRPB8 than that of yRPB8 (Fig. 5, C and F). As a result, hRPB8 may have different binding affinity when interacting with yRPB1, which might account for the observation of temperature-sensitive growth defect on the functional complementation of yRPB8 mutant by hRPB8 (16Shpakovski G.V. Acker J. Wintzerith M. Lacroix J.F. Thuriaux P. Vigneron M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4702-4710Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 17McKune K. Moore P.A. Hull M.W. Woychik N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6895-6900Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of yRPB1 (Protein Data Bank entry 1WCM), we modeled the structure of the hRPB1 domain that interacts with hRPB8 using the software package three-dimensional JIGSAW (36Bates P.A. Sternberg M.J.E. Proteins. 1999; 3: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The modeled structure and the yRPB1 domain containing the yRPB8-binding surface (37Flores A. Briand J.-F. Gadal O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7815-7820Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) are shown in Fig. 5 (D and G), respectively. It indicates that most of the residues located in the binding motif of PXIXKPXXLWXGKQ in both hRPB8 and yRPB8 are aromatic and hydrophobic, and the distributions of the electrostatic potential in this region are quite similar. However, the charge distributions in the lower left part that forms a cavity are a bit different between the two structures (Fig. 5, D and G). The hRPB1 has a patch of positively charged residues lining the bottom of the cavity, whereas the same region in yRPB8 is negatively charged. This cavity is spatially close to strands β7 and β8 of the RPB8 subunit based on the crystal structure of yRPB1 (Protein Data Bank entry 1WCM). Because strands β7 and β8 in hRPB8 are more negatively charged, hRPB8 may bind to hRPB1 with higher affinity than yRPB1. However, ultimate conclusions can only be made with knowledge of the experimentally determined structure of hRPB1 and additional biochemical experiments. Site-specific Characterizations of the Nonspecific Binding of hRPB8 with ssDNA—To characterize the nonspecific DNA binding properties of the hRPB8 subunit at the atomic level, ssDNA titration experiments were performed and monitored by a series of two-dimensional 15N-edited HSQC spectra. An overlay of the HSQC spectra collected in the absence and presence of different concentrations of ssDNA is shown in Fig. 6A. The hRPB8 protein showed identical HSQC spectra at the same DNA/protein ratios when two different ssDNA sequences were used in the titration experiments. This observation demonstrates that the conformational change of hRPB8 is independent of the DNA sequence, which further confirms that the binding is nonspecific. In addition, the HSQC spectra of hRPB8 in the presence of different concentrations of ssDNA were overall similar to that of the free hPRB8 except a few cross-peaks exhibiting significant chemical shift changes during the titration experiments. This observation strongly suggests the structural similarity between the free hPRB8 and the hPRB8·ssDNA complex. Fig. 6B shows the composite chemical shift changes of hPRB8 amides (1H and 15N) upon binding to ssDNA. We performed a series of triple-resonance NMR experiments to assign the backbone chemical shifts of hRPB8 in the hRPB8·ssDNA complex. The largest chemical shift changes were observed at the region containing residues Asp14, Asp16, Glu18, His29, Cys30, and Leu39. Notably, these residues are spatially located at or close to the predicted single-stranded oligonucleotide-binding sites based on its OB fold structure (Fig. 6C). In addition, residues Lys20, Lys21, Phe22, Glu31, Glu33, Ser34, and Asp38 were missing in the NMR spectra of the hRPB8·ssDNA complex. Most of these missing residues are located near the putative single-stranded oligonucleotide-binding region (strands β2 and β3) except those (Ser105-Ala109 and Gly119) in the loop region of the hRPB8 structure (Fig. 6C). It is well documented that for the OB fold proteins, the exposed basic, aromatic and hydrophobic residues located on the β-strands and loop regions bind single-stranded oligonucleotides through various interactions, such as stacking interactions with aromatic amino acid side chains, packing interactions with hydrophobic side chains or the aliphatic portions of more polar amino acids such as lysine and arginine, as well as hydrogen bonds between basic amino acids and DNA phosphates (34Voutsina A. Riva M. Carles C. Alexandraki D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1047-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 39Theobald D.L. Mitton-Fry R.M. Wuttke D.S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 115-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Among the residues that were perturbed upon binding to ssDNA, residues Asp16, Lys21, Phe22, Ser34, and Leu39 are highly conserved during evolution and may make major contributions to oligonucleotide interaction. Notably, during the titration experiments, only a single set of cross-peaks were observed in each of the two-dimensional 15N-edited HSQC spectra at each ssDNA concentration, especially when the ssDNA concentrations were lower than that of hRPB8. Moreover, each HSQC spectrum was different from that of the free hRPB8, indicating that only a single conformation of the hRPB8·ssDNA complex could be detected by NMR spectroscopy. This observation demonstrates that the hRPB8·ssDNA complex is a fast and dynamic exchanging system with the fast association and dissociation of ssDNA. Therefore, when the concentration of ssDNA was lower than that of protein, the observed cross-peaks were averaged from both the free hRPB8 and the hRPB8·ssDNA complex. This conclusion is supported by the fact that with the increase of the concentration of ssDNA, the cross-peaks moved toward a stationary position where the protein was saturated by ssDNA (Figs. 6A and 7, A-D). Based on the results from NMR titration experiments (Fig. 7), we extracted the dissociation constant KD between hRPB8 and ssDNA using the chemical shift changes of seven representative residues Ile9, Phe10, Asp14, Gly19, Cys30, Ile40, and Gly127 (40Zuiderweg E.R.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 41Tossavainen H. Permi P. Purhonen S.L. Sarvas M. Kilpeläinen I. Seppala R. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1822-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The apparent KD is ∼0.1 mm, obtained by averaging over the individual KD values from the seven residues. As shown in Fig. 7E, the dissociation constant KD values obtained from different residues are in good agreement with each other. Furthermore, the thermodynamic constant determined by NMR titration experiments is in general agreement with that by the SPR measurements. Conformational Flexibility in the Single-stranded Oligonucleotide-binding Region of hRPB8—It is well understood that proteins adopt conformational exchanges while performing their biological functions (42Gerstein M. Echols N. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Understanding of these conformational fluctuations on various time scales is essential for understanding the biological processes in many cases. The conformational flexibility on the millisecond time scale plays especially important roles in many biological processes such as enzyme catalysis and protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions (43Kovrigin E.L. Loria J.P. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2636-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 44Atkinson R.A. Kieffer B. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 2004; 44: 141-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The NMR relaxation dispersion experiment is proven a well established tool for probing the conformational dynamics from picosecond to millisecond or even slower time scales at the atomic level (45Palmer III, A.G. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 3623-3640Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, only a little information is available on the conformational changes of proteins during their recognition and interaction with the partner molecules thus far. The hRPB8 subunit contributes to the positively charged groove on the back side of RNAP II and was proposed to involve in one of the two possible exit paths for nascent RNA by interacting with the single-stranded nucleic acids (15Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 1014-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The conformational dynamics may play a role in this process. Consequently, it is of biological importance to characterize the internal dynamics of hRPB8 during its recognition of single-stranded nucleic acids, especially the millisecond time scale conformational exchanges. The conformational exchanges of hRPB8 in the absence and presence of different ssDNA concentrations were measured, and the results are shown in Fig. 8. In the absence of ssDNA, residues Lys13, Asp14, Ile15, Gly19, Lys20, Lys21, His29, Cys30, Ser32, Phe35, Leu39, Ile40,Glu100, Thr104, Ala109, Arg111, and Gly127 of hRPB8 showed conformational exchanges (Rex) on the millisecond time scale. A mapping of the residues showing conformational exchanges onto the solution structure of hRPB8 indicates that these residues are located near the predicted single-stranded oligonucleotides binding region. Upon binding to ssDNA with a molar ratio to protein of 0.5:1.0, only residues Thr104, Ala109, Arg111, and Gly127 showed conformational exchanges on the millisecond time scale. In the presence of excess ssDNA (ssDNA/hRPB8 ∼ 1.5: 1.0), no residues showing conformational exchanges around the binding site were observed. In addition, after binding to ssDNA, most residues in the first helix (H1) were missing except residue Glu19. This fact suggests that intermediate conformational exchanges are involved that resulted in the broadening of NMR signals being undetectable. The intermediate conformational exchanges are mainly due to the dynamic contacts between the hRPB8 and ssDNA. The aforementioned results demonstrate that the millisecond conformational flexibility around the binding region of hRPB8 is significantly reduced upon its binding with ssDNA. The observed redistribution of conformational exchange after DNA binding is in good agreement with previous dynamic studies of DNA- or RNA-binding proteins (44Atkinson R.A. Kieffer B. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 2004; 44: 141-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To obtain further insights into the motional properties, the heteronuclear {1H}-15N steady state NOEs for the free hRPB8 and the hRPB8·ssDNA complex were determined (supplemental material). Notably, upon binding with ssDNA, residues in several regions of the hRPB8·ssDNA complex, such as residues in helix H2, in the Ω-loop or in the loops connecting H4-β7 and β7-β8, still showed lower than average NOE values. Because helix H2, part of the Ω-loop, and β-strands 5-8 form the binding interface with subunit RPB1 based on the crystal structure of yeast RNAP II complex (Protein Data Bank entry 1WCM), we propose that the motional flexibility near these regions may be required for the interactions of hRPB8 with hRPB1 or probably with other subunits of the RNAPs or other proteins such as transcription factors. However, further evidence is required to demonstrate this hypothesis. Taken together, the conformational dynamics in combination with the titration experiments clearly indicate that the hRPB8·ssDNA complex is a fast exchanging system, along with intermediate conformational exchanges of hRPB8. Functional Implications—The solution structure of the hRPB8 subunit in conjunction with the biochemical and dynamic results provide important insights in understanding its biological function in the eukaryotic basal transcriptional machineries (8Cramer P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 9Armache K-J. Mitterweger S. Meinhart A. Cramer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7131-7134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Residues around the single-stranded oligonucleotide-binding region of the free hRPB8 showed significantly different conformational flexibility before and after binding to ssDNA. In contrast, residues in several regions still showed strong internal motions on the picosecond to nanosecond time scales after binding with ssDNA, implying that these residues may be responsible for the interactions with other subunits in the assembled architecture of RNAPs and with other proteins like the transcription factors. Previous studies demonstrated that hRPB8 interacts in vivo with the biggest subunit hRPB1 and other subunits such as hRPB2, hRPB3, and hRPB5 of RNAP II (46Acker J. de Graaff M. Cheynel I. Khazak V. Kedinger C. Vigneron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16815-16821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The changes of motional flexibility could be expected upon the interactions of hRPB8 with these subunits and other molecules. Further investigations are expected to address these issues. Concluding Remarks—We have determined the solution structure of the conserved hRPB8 subunit of human RNA polymerases at high resolution. The structural and biochemical studies in conjunction with the internal dynamics of the free protein and its ssDNA complex of the hRPB8 subunit clearly demonstrate that hRPB8 nonspecifically binds with ssDNA. The changes of conformational dynamics of hRPB8 on the millisecond time scale are strongly coupled to its interactions with single-stranded oligonucleotides. Therefore, the current studies reveal new aspects of the roles of this subunit in the molecular architecture of RNAPs and biological functions during transcription in eukaryotes.

The δ2 glutamate receptor (GluRδ2) is abundantly expressed at the spines of Purkinje cell dendrites and controls synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum. To obtain clues to the trafficking mechanism of the iGluRs, we expressed wild-type or mutant GluRδ2 in cultured hippocampal and Purkinje neurons and analyzed their intracellular localization using immunocytochemical techniques. Quantitative analysis revealed that deletion of the 20 amino acids at the center of the C terminus (region E) significantly reduced the amount of GluRδ2 protein at the spines in both types of neurons. This effect was partially antagonized by the inhibition of endocytosis by high dose sucrose treatment or coexpression of dominant negative dynamin. In addition, mutant GluRδ2 lacking the E region (GluRδ2ΔE), but not wild-type GluRδ2, was found to colocalize with the endosomal markers Rab4 and Rab7. Moreover, the antibody-feeding assay revealed that GluRδ2ΔE was internalized more rapidly than GluRδ2wt. These results indicate that the E region (more specifically, a 12-amino-acid-long segment of the E2 region) is necessary for rendering GluRδ2 resistant to endocytosis from the cell surface at the spines. Furthermore, insertion of the E2 region alone into the C terminus of the GluR1 subtype of iGluRs was sufficient to increase the amount of GluR1 proteins in the spines. Therefore, we propose that the E2 region of GluRδ2 is necessary, and also sufficient, to inhibit endocytosis of the receptor from postsynaptic membranes.

The α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) 2The abbreviations used are: AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate; iGluR, ionotropic glutamate receptor; LTD, long term depression; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GluRδ2, glutamate receptor δ2; HA, hemagglutinin; PDZ, postsynaptic density-95/discs large/zona occludens-1; wt, wild-type. 2The abbreviations used are: AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate; iGluR, ionotropic glutamate receptor; LTD, long term depression; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GluRδ2, glutamate receptor δ2; HA, hemagglutinin; PDZ, postsynaptic density-95/discs large/zona occludens-1; wt, wild-type. subclass of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) consisting of GluR1 through GluR4, which exist as heteromers (1Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar), plays a major role in fast excitatory synaptic transmission at the dendritic spines in the vertebrate brain. It has become increasingly clear that neuronal, activity-driven changes in the number of AMPA receptors at the postsynaptic spines mediate synaptic plasticity, such as long term potentiation and long term depression (LTD), which is thought to underlie certain forms of memory in the brain. For example, GluR1 is selectively delivered to the spines where neuronal activity is high during synaptic long term potentiation, whereas GluR2 is constitutively delivered to the spines to replace existing synaptic AMPA receptors in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (2Malinow R. Malenka R.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 103-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar, 3Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Neuron. 2003; 40: 361-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). In contrast, GluR2-containing AMPA receptors are selectively endocytosed during synaptic LTD in the hippocampus and cerebellum (4Lee S.H. Liu L. Wang Y.T. Sheng M. Neuron. 2002; 36: 661-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 5Man H.Y. Lin J.W. Ju W.H. Ahmadian G. Liu L. Becker L.E. Sheng M. Wang Y.T. Neuron. 2000; 25: 649-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 6Matsuda S. Launey T. Mikawa S. Hirai H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2765-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 7Wang Y.T. Linden D.J. Neuron. 2000; 25: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Interestingly, such distinct trafficking patterns of GluR1 or GluR2 are controlled by the respective C termini of the receptors. Furthermore, depending on the phosphorylation status of the C termini, the endocytosed GluR1 could be either reinserted into postsynaptic sites via recycling endosomes, or degraded via lysosomal pathways (8Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2000; 28: 511-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Therefore, the number of postsynaptic AMPA receptors seems to be tightly regulated by mechanisms that recognize the C termini of the AMPA receptors at multiple checkpoints, including exocytosis, lateral diffusion, endocytosis, and degradation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying such regulation are not well understood; a potential problem is the heteromerization of endogenous AMPA receptors with the exogenously expressed AMPA receptors, which could affect the trafficking patterns of the receptors in the neurons.The δ2 glutamate receptor (GluRδ2), which is predominantly expressed at the postsynaptic spines of parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses (9Landsend A.S. Amiry-Moghaddam M. Matsubara A. Bergersen L. Usami S. Wenthold R.J. Ottersen O.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 834-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is a member of the iGluR family. Unlike other iGluRs, GluRδ2 mainly exists as a homomer (10Kohda K. Kamiya Y. Matsuda S. Kato K. Umemori H. Yuzaki M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 110: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 11Mayat E. Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2533-2546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, although 50-70% of the iGluRs are detected in the intracellular compartments of neurons (12Hall R.A. Soderling T.R. Neuroscience. 1997; 78: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 13Hall R.A. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4135-4140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), GluRδ2 is predominantly expressed at the cell surface (14Matsuda S. Yuzaki M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the ataxic mutant mice hotfoot-4J, -7J, -11J, and -12J, GluRδ2 failed to be transported to the cell surface (14Matsuda S. Yuzaki M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 15Wang Y. Matsuda S. Drews V. Torashima T. Meisler M.H. Yuzaki M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 1581-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which suggests that efficient trafficking of GluRδ2 to the cell surface is essential for its functioning in the cerebellum. Furthermore, GluRδ2 is not only transported to the Purkinje cell surface but also to spine regions where parallel fibers form synapses (16Takayama C. Nakagawa S. Watanabe M. Mishina M. Inoue Y. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1996; 92: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that GluRδ2 actively controls LTD by controlling endocytosis of the AMPA receptors at the postsynaptic spines of Purkinje cells (17Hirai H. Launey T. Mikawa S. Torashima T. Yanagihara D. Kasaura T. Yuzaki Miyamoto A.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, characterization of the mechanisms responsible for GluRδ2 trafficking to the postsynaptic spines is not only necessary for understanding GluRδ2 signaling but also to obtain greater insight into the general pattern of iGluR signaling in the brain. In the study described here, we investigated the role of the C-terminal region of GluRδ2 to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the efficient expression of this receptor at the postsynaptic spines. Although the most C-terminal region is often regarded as crucial for the anchoring of the iGluRs at postsynaptic sites (2Malinow R. Malenka R.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 103-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar), we found that 12 amino acids at the center of the C terminus of GluRδ2 are necessary, and also sufficient, for stable expression of the receptors at the spines in hippocampal and Purkinje cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction and Transfection of the Expression Plasmids—We used the modified overlap extension method and Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to delete portions of GluRδ2. Using PCR, we added a cDNA that encoded a hemagglutinin (HA) tag to the 5′ end (immediately following the signal sequence) or 3′ end (immediately upstream of the stop codon) of the GluRδ2 cDNAs. We also added a FLAG tag to the 3′ end (immediately upstream of the stop codon) of the dynamin1-K44E cDNA (provided by Dr. R. B. Vallee, Columbia University/) (18Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Bidirectional sequencing confirmed the nucleotide sequence of the amplified open reading frame. cDNAs encoding Rab4a and Rab7a, tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP), were provided by Dr. M. Fukuda (Tohoku University). After the cDNAs were cloned into the expression vector pCAGGS (provided by Dr. J. Miyazaki, Tohoku University), the constructs were transfected into hippocampal neurons using Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), as described previously (19Matsuda K. Fletcher M. Kamiya Y. Yuzaki M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10064-10073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Immunohistochemical Analysis—To examine the subcellular localization of GluRδ2 in the hippocampal neurons, we used a pCAGGS vector expressing wild-type or mutant GluRδ2 tagged with HA. Cultured hippocampal neurons were transfected with these clones using effectene (Qiagen) and stained with an anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science), as described previously (19Matsuda K. Fletcher M. Kamiya Y. Yuzaki M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10064-10073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the subcellular localization of GluRδ2 in the Purkinje cells, we used cells infected with a modified Sindbis virus. The GluRδ2 cDNA whose 3′ end was linked to the sequence encoding the HA tag was cloned into a pSinRep vector (Invitrogen), and virus particles were generated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cerebellar, dissociated cultures were prepared from embryonic day 18 mice, as described previously (6Matsuda S. Launey T. Mikawa S. Hirai H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2765-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and used at 14-21 days in vitro. Sindbis virus encoding wild-type or mutant GluRδ2 was applied to cerebellar cultures. Eighteen hours later, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 2 h at 4 °C and then washed three times with PBS. The cultures were first incubated with a blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.4% Triton X-100, and 10% normal goat serum in PBS) and then with the anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) and anti-calbindin (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) antibodies. The bound primary antibodies were detected by secondary antibodies that were conjugated to either Alexa 488 or Alexa 546 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR).Surface-labeling Assay—N-terminal HA-tagged wild-type or mutant GluRδ2 were expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons. Cells were fixed as described above, incubated with a blocking solution without Triton X-100, and then incubated with the anti-HA antibody (Covance, Richmond, CA). The primary antibodies bound on the cell surface were detected by secondary antibodies that were conjugated to Alexa 546 (Molecular Probes).“Antibody-feeding” Assay—N-terminal HA-tagged wild-type or mutant GluRδ2 were expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons. Mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml; Covance) was added to the culture medium for 30 min at 37 °C to label GluRδ2 on the surface of live hippocampal neurons. After washing with PBS, the neurons were treated with 0.5 m NaCl/0.2 m acetic acid (pH 3.5) for 4 min on ice to remove the remaining antibodies on the cell surface. The neurons were then rinsed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde with 4% sucrose. The cultures were permeabilized and incubated with a blocking solution, and total GluRδ2 proteins were stained by rabbit anti-GluRδ2 antibody (Chemicon), as described above. Anti-HA and anti-GluRδ2 antibodies were detected by secondary antibodies that were conjugated to Alexa 546 and Alexa 488, respectively (Molecular Probes).Image Analysis—Image analysis was performed in a blind manner without knowing the identity of the samples during the analysis. Spines were defined as dendritic protrusions that have an enlargement at the tip. Spines within proximal 2-3 dendritic segments (∼50 μm for each segment; total length of >100 μm) were analyzed for individual neurons. The intensity of the HA immunoreactivity was normalized to the GFP fluorescence intensity in each spine by the IP-Lab imaging software (Scanalytics, Fairfax, VA). The mean normalized HA immunoreactivity, which represents the spine localization of the HA-tagged protein in each neuron, was calculated from at least 20 spine heads/neuron. These values were analyzed from a total of 5-9 neurons from at least two separate cultures, and the averages were compared. For the antibody-feeding assay, the fluorescence intensities of Alexa 546 (internalized GluRδ2) and Alexa 488 (total GluRδ2) were quantified in proximal 2-3 dendritic segments by the IP-Lab imaging software. The averages of seven neurons (from two separate cultures) were compared. For statistical analysis, we used the Student's t test.Mice Treatment—All of the procedures related to the care and treatment of the experimental animals were conducted in accordance with the Guidelines for Animal Experiments at the Keio University. The animals were anesthetized with tribromoethanol before decapitation.RESULTSIdentification of the Synaptic Localization Signal of GluRδ2—To exclude the possibility of endogenous GluRδ2 modifying the trafficking of exogenously expressed GluRδ2, we expressed wild-type GluRδ2 with its N terminus tagged with HA (NT-HA-GluRδ2wt (Fig. 1A) in cultured hippocampal neurons; no endogenous GluRδ2 is expressed in the hippocampus of adult rats (11Mayat E. Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2533-2546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, we could not detect GluRδ2 expression in cultured hippocampal neurons by immunocytochemical analysis (Fig. 1B). Therefore, in these neurons, the majority of the exogenously expressed GluRδ2 should form homomer, although weak interaction between GluRδ2 and other iGluRs may occur (10Kohda K. Kamiya Y. Matsuda S. Kato K. Umemori H. Yuzaki M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 110: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 11Mayat E. Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2533-2546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neurons were cotransfected with cDNA encoding GFP to identify the morphology of the dendritic spines, and the distribution of GluRδ2wt was examined by immunocytochemical analysis using anti-HA antibody. As reported for endogenous GluRδ2 in the cerebellar Purkinje cells (16Takayama C. Nakagawa S. Watanabe M. Mishina M. Inoue Y. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1996; 92: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), exogenous NT-HA-GluRδ2wt was also efficiently transported to the spines in the cultured hippocampal neurons (Fig. 1C). Because GluRδ2 mainly exists as a homomer (10Kohda K. Kamiya Y. Matsuda S. Kato K. Umemori H. Yuzaki M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 110: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), these findings indicate that exogenous GluRδ2wt contains sufficient information for efficient trafficking to spines by a mechanism common to both hippocampal and Purkinje neurons.To identify the region important for the synaptic localization of GluRδ2, a series of deletions were introduced in the C-terminal intracellular domain of GluRδ2 and an HA tag was added to the extreme C terminus of each clone (Fig. 1A). These mutant or wild-type receptors were expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons together with GFP. Similar to NT-HA-GluRδ2wt, GluRδ2wt with its C terminus tagged with HA was effectively transported to the spines of the cultured hippocampal neurons (Fig. 1D). Several postsynaptic density-95/Discs large/zona occludens-1 (PDZ) domain-containing proteins, such as PSD-93, PTPMEG, delphilin, and nPIST, have been reported to bind to the C terminus of GluRδ2 receptors, providing them anchorage at the postsynaptic spines (21Yuzaki M. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 46: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, because an HA tag attached to the C terminus would completely interrupt such interactions, it is unlikely that these anchoring proteins are involved in the postsynaptic localization of GluRδ2.Interestingly, although all mutant GluRδ2 proteins were normally trafficked to the cell surface in human embryonic kidney cells (22Matsuda S. Hannen R. Matsuda K. Yamada N. Tubbs T. Yuzaki M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 19: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the mutant lacking amino acids 895-915 (GluRδ2ΔE) was mostly excluded from the spines of cultured hippocampal neurons, regardless of the position of the HA tag (Fig. 1, C and D). Quantitative analysis of the HA-staining intensity in the spines revealed that the deletion of the “E region” significantly reduced the amount of GluRδ2 protein at the spines (p < 0.01; n = 7) (Fig. 1E), indicating that the E region is necessary for the synaptic localization of GluRδ2.We examined whether the E region is also necessary for the synaptic localization of GluRδ2 in Purkinje cells, the type of cell in which GluRδ2 is predominantly expressed. GluRδ2wt or GluRδ2ΔE, with the C terminus tagged with HA, was expressed in cultured Purkinje cells using the Sindbis virus. The localization of the receptor proteins and the morphology of the infected cells were examined by immunocytochemical analysis using anti-HA and anti-calbindin antibody, respectively (Fig. 2A-C). Although GluRδ2wt was abundantly localized in a punctate pattern in the spines of the cultured Purkinje cells, GluRδ2ΔE was more prominently localized on the dendritic shafts (Fig. 2C). Quantitative analysis of the HA-staining intensity in the spines revealed that the amount of GluRδ2ΔE protein in the Purkinje cell spines was significantly lower than that of GluRδ2wt (p < 0.01; n = 7) (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that the E region is essential for the synaptic localization of GluRδ2 in both the hippocampal and Purkinje neurons.FIGURE 2Localization of GluRδ2wt and GluRδ2ΔE in cultured Purkinje cells. A, overall images of Purkinje cells expressing exogenous GluRδ2 clones. C-terminal HA-tagged GluRδ2wt (left panel) or GluRδ2ΔE (right panel) were expressed in cultured Purkinje cells using Sindbis virus, and their spine localization was examined by immunocytochemical analysis using anti-HA (red) and anti-calbindin (green) antibodies. B, representative images of the dendrites of Purkinje cells expressing C-terminal HA-tagged GluRδ2wt (left panel) or GluRδ2ΔE (right panel).

D, quantitative analysis of the spine localization of GluRδ2 in cultured Purkinje neurons. The HA-staining intensity in the spines was normalized to the calbindin-staining intensity in the spines. The HA/calbindin-staining intensity ratio of GluRδ2wt was arbitrarily set at 100%. Each bar represents the mean ± S.E., and significance was established in comparison with that measured in cells that expressed GluRδ2wt (**, p < 0.01; n = 7 cells).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Blockade of Endocytosis on GluRδ2ΔE Localization in the Spines—There are two plausible mechanisms by which the E region might control the synaptic localization of GluRδ2, 1) it may facilitate the delivery of GluRδ2 to the dendritic spines by lateral diffusion from extrasynaptic sites, or 2) it may stabilize GluRδ2 localization by inhibiting its removal from the spines. To examine the latter possibility, we treated hippocampal neurons expressing GluRδ2wt or GluRδ2ΔE with sucrose at a concentration of 350 mm, which is known to inhibit endocytosis (23Hirai H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 73-82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with this concentration of sucrose for 30 min, but not for 15 min, significantly increased the amount of the GluRδ2ΔE protein in the spines (p < 0.01; n = 5), whereas it had no effect on the spinal localization of GluRδ2wt (Fig. 3, A and B). Although we could not challenge the cells for longer periods of time with sucrose because of its detrimental effects on the morphology of the neurons, our results suggested that GluRδ2ΔE was removed more rapidly from the spines than GluRδ2wt by endocytosis.FIGURE 3Effects of sucrose treatment on GluRδ2ΔE distribution in cultured hippocampal neurons. GluRδ2wt and GluRδ2ΔE, with their C termini tagged with HA, were expressed with GFP in cultured hippocampal neurons. Neurons were treated with sucrose at 350 mm for 15 or 30 min, and the distribution of GluRδ2 was examined by immunocytochemical analysis. A, representative images of the distribution patterns of C-terminal HA-tagged GluRδ2ΔE in the absence of sucrose treatment (top panels), of GluRδ2ΔE after 30 min of sucrose treatment (middle panels), and GluRδ2wt in the absence of sucrose treatment (bottom panels) in cultured hippocampal neurons. Arrows and arrowheads indicate HA-positive and -negative spines, respectively. B, quantitative analysis of the spinal localization of GluRδ2 in cultured hippocampal neurons. The HA-staining intensity in the spines was normalized to the GFP-staining intensity in the spines. The HA/GFP-staining intensity ratio of GluRδ2wt was arbitrarily set at 100%. Each bar represents the mean ± S.E., and significance was established in comparison with that measured in cells that expressed GluRδ2ΔE at time 0 (**, p < 0.01; n = 5 cells). C, detection of GluRδ2 proteins on the cell surface. Surface GluRδ2 proteins were labeled by applying anti-HA antibody to hippocampal neurons expressing N-terminal HA-tagged GluRδ2wt (left panels) or GluRδ2ΔE (right panels) under non-permeabilizing conditions and visualized by Alexa 546-conjugated secondary antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that GluRδ2 in spines was located on the cell surface, we performed the surface labeling assay. NT-HA-GluRδ2wt or NT-HA-GluRδ2ΔE was expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons, and surface receptors were labeled with anti-HA antibody under non-permeabilizing conditions. Although NT-HA-GluRδ2wt was highly expressed in spines, weak NT-HA-GluRδ2ΔE immunoreactivities were observed diffusely throughout the dendrites (Fig. 3C). These results indicated that spine localization of GluRδ2 indeed represented receptors on the cell surface and that the E region stabilized GluRδ2 on the postsynaptic membrane.Dynamin has been shown to be essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, whereas its mutant dynamin-K44E, in which the lysine at position 44 is replaced with glutamine, blocks endocytosis in a dominant negative manner (18Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). When dynamin-K44E was coexpressed with GluRδ2ΔE, it significantly increased the amount of GluRδ2ΔE protein in the spines (p < 0.05; n = 5) (Fig. 4, A and B). Identical results were obtained from the experiment using NT-HA-GluRδ2ΔE (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these results indicate that the E region might be necessary for rendering GluRδ2 resistant to endocytosis at the postsynaptic membrane.FIGURE 4Effects of dominant negative dynamin on the GluRδ2ΔE distribution in cultured hippocampal neurons. GluRδ2ΔE was expressed with GFP and a C-terminal FLAG-tagged dominant negative form (K44E) of dynamin 1 in cultured hippocampal neurons, and the distribution of GluRδ2ΔE was examined by immunocytochemical analysis.

In neurons expressing HA-GluRδ2wt, the HA immunoreactivities were observed in the spines, and there was no evidence of colocalization with Rab4 or Rab7, confirming that GluRδ2wt was predominantly localized at the cell surface (Fig. 5A). In contrast, in neurons expressing HA-GluRδ2ΔE, the HA immunoreactivities were predominantly colocalized with Rab4 or Rab7 (Fig. 5B). The colocalization of GluRδ2ΔE with early or late endosomal markers could be attributable to the role of the E region in promoting recycling of endocytosed GluRδ2 to the spine. However, because inhibition of endocytosis by high dose sucrose treatment or dynamin-K44E resulted in an increased presence of GluRδ2ΔE at the spines (Figs. 3 and 4), it is more plausible that the E region inhibited endocytosis and stabilized the localization of GluRδ2 at the spines.FIGURE 5Endocytosis of GluRδ2ΔE in cultured hippocampal neurons. A and B, colocalization of GluRδ2wt and GluRδ2ΔE with endosome markers. C-terminal HA-tagged GluRδ2wt (A) or GluRδ2ΔE (B) was expressed with GFP-tagged Rab4 (early endosome marker) or GFP-tagged Rab7 (late endosome marker), and their distribution pattern was examined by immunocytochemical analysis using anti-HA antibody. C and D, the antibody-feeding assay to monitor endocytosis of surface GluRδ2 proteins. Anti-HA antibody was added to live hippocampal neurons expressing N-terminal HA-tagged GluRδ2wt or GluRδ2ΔE to label GluRδ2 on the surface. Thirty minutes later, internalized and total GluRδ2 were detected by anti-HA (red) and anti-GluRδ2 (green) antibodies, respectively. Representative images of overall (C) and dendritic (D) regions are shown. E, quantitation of GluRδ2 internalization, measured as the ratio of internalized (red)/total (green) fluorescence. Each bar represents the mean ± S.E., and significance was established in comparison with that measured in cells that expressed GluRδ2wt (*, p < 0.05; n = 7 c"
