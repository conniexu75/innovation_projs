https://openalex.org/W2041344030,"Colloidal platinum was prepared and precipitated directly onto photosynthetic thylakoid membranes from aqueous solution and entrapped on fiberglass filter paper. This composition of matter was capable of sustained simultaneous photoevolution of hydrogen and oxygen when irradiated at any wavelength in the chlorophyll absorption spectrum. Experimental data support the interpretation that part of the platinum metal catalyst is precipitated adjacent to the photosystem I reduction site of photosynthesis and that electron transfer occurs across the interface between photosystem I and the catalyst. Photoactivity of the material was dependent on the nature of the ionic species from which the platinum was precipitated. All photoactive samples were prepared from the hexachloroplatinate(IV) ion, whereas samples prepared by precipitation of the tetraammineplatinum(II) ion showed no hydrogen evolution activity and only transient oxygen activity. This system is among the simplest known for photosynthetically splitting water into molecular hydrogen and oxygen."

Fluidization research has tended to focus on bubbling beds of coarse solids, but designers of such beds for burning coal have learned to appreciate the importance of combustion of fine char particles in the freeboard. Designers of successful processes for powders have focused on bubble suppression. Since about 1980, combustion fluid beds of both types are challenging the conventional pulverized-coal boiler; they provide better means for controlling emissions from the combustion of high-sulfur fuels. Progress in the ""bubbleless"" fluidization of fine powders is increasing the fluid bed's competitiveness with the fixed-bed catalytic reactor. Efforts to advance the fluid bed for catalysis, besides increasing gas velocities beyond levels that most researchers have used in the past, must include systematic study of the level of fine particles smaller than 40 micrometers."
https://openalex.org/W2086140952,"In the early microspore wall of the grass Poa annua L., sporopollenin is arranged in bundles of anastomosing strands. Each bundle contains at least two strands, each about 50 A in diameter, which anastomose or intertwine and look like a meshwork with pores of the mesh up to 50 A in diameter. After the early microspore stage the exine becomes homogeneous; it is similar in this respect to the exines or ornamented parts of the exines of pollen of other angiosperms examined by electron microscopy."

https://openalex.org/W1986309478,"Tissue cultures have been established from stems of Trichocereus spachianus (Riccob.) for the purpose of studying alkaloid biosynthesis in cactus tissue. On a basal inorganic medium supplemented with glucose, coconut milk, and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, three distinct types of callus are initiated. One is greenish, compact, and slow-growing; another is firm and yellowish, with a moderate growth rate; the third is very friable and rapid-growing. The growth habit remains constant for a given clone in successive subcultures."

The old tissues contained more water, chloride, total base, sodium and calcium; and they contained less potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, nitrogen and ash than the younger tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2088203492,"Measurements were made in Landstunhl, Germany, between 1959 and Sept. 1, 1961 of the Cs/sup 137/ levels in over 6000 individuals living in Germany. The measurements were made with the aid of a two- pi liquid scintillation whole- body counter. Data are presented on age, sex. body weight, and average diet of the subjects, and Cs/sup 137/ per kg of body weight and per gm of body K. Monthly changes in the Cs/sup 137/ content of the populatioo were recorded. Results of the measuremeats indicate a half-life of approximately 12 months for Cs/sup 137/. The data show that fall-out was decrcasing in Western Europe up to the time when atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons was returnedin Sept. 1961. (C.H.)"
https://openalex.org/W2084998240,"Recent surface survey for prehistoric archeological sites in western Iran has contributed toward defining three centers of early agricultural village settlement. Excavation at a site in upper Khuzistan revealed a sequence of settled life which, at its earliest, may antedate food production. The site also yielded faunal evidence for an ecological change subsequent to the end of the Pleistocene."

https://openalex.org/W1969076847,"Two radiocarbon dates were obtained for postglacial clays. One sample, 6350 years old, was taken from a bed of compacted and carbonized wood just above a bed of pebbly clay. Overlying the woody bed is 5(1/2) feet of organic bluish clays and beach sands near the present lake level. The upper clay layer contained a younger wood sample, 5475 years old. The blue clays are of shallow swamp origin and were deposited during the late low-water stage of Lake Chippewa; the pebbly clay is assumed to be of Glenwood age (about 11,000 years) or older."
https://openalex.org/W2084401683,The flowering response of Xanthium pennsylvanicum Wallr. is attenuated when the plant is rotated around a horizontal axis at the rate of 0.25 rev/min. Rotation prior to an inductive dark period has the strongest effect.

The method depends on structural homologies between the crystals. Quantitative data on the distribution of Mg(2+) and Fe(2+) in the mineral cummingtonite are found to agree with the theory."

https://openalex.org/W2122012292,"We have described a set of laboratory experiments which establish the primary properties of Alfvén waves and have mentioned natural phenomena in which these waves exert a strong influence. To date, there have been few technological applications of Alfvén waves, although the waves are being considered for use in hydromagnetic amplifiers and in connection with plasma heating techniques associated with controlled thermonuclear fusion devices. As with any new findings, detailed prediction of future applications is impossible."
