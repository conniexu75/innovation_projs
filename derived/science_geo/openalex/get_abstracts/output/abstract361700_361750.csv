https://openalex.org/W2154109129,"The nucleosomes are the basic repeating units of eukaryotic chromatin, and nucleosome organization is critically important for gene regulation. Kaplan et al. tested the importance of the intrinsic DNA sequence preferences of nucleosomes by measuring the genome-wide occupancy of nucleosomes assembled on purified yeast genomic DNA. The resulting map is remarkably similar to in vivo nucleosome maps, indicating that the organization of nucleosomes in vivo is largely governed by the underlying genomic DNA sequence. This study tests the importance of the intrinsic DNA sequence preferences of nucleosomes by measuring the genome-wide occupancy of nucleosomes assembled on purified yeast genomic DNA. The resulting map is similar to in vivo nucleosome maps, indicating that the organization of nucleosomes in vivo is largely governed by the underlying genomic DNA sequence. Nucleosome organization is critical for gene regulation1. In living cells this organization is determined by multiple factors, including the action of chromatin remodellers2, competition with site-specific DNA-binding proteins3, and the DNA sequence preferences of the nucleosomes themselves4,5,6,7,8. However, it has been difficult to estimate the relative importance of each of these mechanisms in vivo7,9,10,11, because in vivo nucleosome maps reflect the combined action of all influencing factors. Here we determine the importance of nucleosome DNA sequence preferences experimentally by measuring the genome-wide occupancy of nucleosomes assembled on purified yeast genomic DNA. The resulting map, in which nucleosome occupancy is governed only by the intrinsic sequence preferences of nucleosomes, is similar to in vivo nucleosome maps generated in three different growth conditions. In vitro, nucleosome depletion is evident at many transcription factor binding sites and around gene start and end sites, indicating that nucleosome depletion at these sites in vivo is partly encoded in the genome. We confirm these results with a micrococcal nuclease-independent experiment that measures the relative affinity of nucleosomes for ∼40,000 double-stranded 150-base-pair oligonucleotides. Using our in vitro data, we devise a computational model of nucleosome sequence preferences that is significantly correlated with in vivo nucleosome occupancy in Caenorhabditis elegans. Our results indicate that the intrinsic DNA sequence preferences of nucleosomes have a central role in determining the organization of nucleosomes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2084745919,"Inappropriate activation of the Wnt signalling pathway in intestinal stem cells causes them to become cancerous. Two papers in this issue help identify the cell type at the root of this cancer, which should in turn aid therapeutic design. Zhu et al. report that prominin 1, a surface protein found on both normal stem cells and cancer stem cells, is a marker for stem cells that are prone to neoplastic transformation. Barker et al. show that in cells expressing Lgr5, previously identified as a marker for intestinal stem cells, activation of Wnt signalling is sufficient to initiate tumour formation. It is shown that the cell surface protein prominin 1 (also known as CD133) marks stem cells in the mouse intestine. Using lineage-tracing experiments, it is shown that intestinal tumours can originate in these cells when the Wnt signalling pathway is aberrantly activated. Cancer stem cells are remarkably similar to normal stem cells: both self-renew, are multipotent and express common surface markers, for example, prominin 1 (PROM1, also called CD133)1. What remains unclear is whether cancer stem cells are the direct progeny of mutated stem cells or more mature cells that reacquire stem cell properties during tumour formation. Answering this question will require knowledge of whether normal stem cells are susceptible to cancer-causing mutations; however, this has proved difficult to test because the identity of most adult tissue stem cells is not known. Here, using an inducible Cre, nuclear LacZ reporter allele knocked into the Prom1 locus (Prom1C-L ), we show that Prom1 is expressed in a variety of developing and adult tissues. Lineage-tracing studies of adult Prom1+/C-L mice containing the Rosa26-YFP reporter allele showed that Prom1+ cells are located at the base of crypts in the small intestine, co-express Lgr5 (ref. 2), generate the entire intestinal epithelium, and are therefore the small intestinal stem cell. Prom1 was reported recently to mark cancer stem cells of human intestinal tumours that arise frequently as a consequence of aberrant wingless (Wnt) signalling3,4,5. Activation of endogenous Wnt signalling in Prom1+/C-L mice containing a Cre-dependent mutant allele of β-catenin (Ctnnb1lox(ex3) ) resulted in a gross disruption of crypt architecture and a disproportionate expansion of Prom1+ cells at the crypt base. Lineage tracing demonstrated that the progeny of these cells replaced the mucosa of the entire small intestine with neoplastic tissue that was characterized by focal high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and crypt adenoma formation. Although all neoplastic cells arose from Prom1+ cells in these mice, only 7% of tumour cells retained Prom1 expression. Our data indicate that Prom1 marks stem cells in the adult small intestine that are susceptible to transformation into tumours retaining a fraction of mutant Prom1+ tumour cells."
https://openalex.org/W2052190944,"The recent observations of superconductivity at temperatures up to 55K in compounds containing layers of iron arsenide have revealed a new class of high temperature superconductors that show striking similarities to the more familiar cuprates. In both series of compounds, the onset of superconductivity is associated with the suppression of magnetic order by doping holes and/or electrons into the band leading to theories in which magnetic fluctuations are either responsible for or strongly coupled to the superconducting order parameter. In the cuprates, theories of magnetic pairing have been invoked to explain the observation of a resonant magnetic excitation that scales in energy with the superconducting energy gap and is suppressed above the superconducting transition temperature, Tc. Such resonant excitations have been shown by inelastic neutron scattering to be a universal feature of the cuprate superconductors, and have even been observed in heavy fermion superconductors with much lower transition temperatures. In this paper, we show neutron scattering evidence of a resonant excitation in Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2, which is a superconductor below 38K, at the momentum transfer associated with magnetic order in the undoped compound, BaFe2As2, and at an energy transfer that is consistent with scaling in other strongly correlated electron superconductors. As in the cuprates, the peak disappears at Tc providing the first experimental confirmation of a strong coupling of the magnetic fluctuation spectrum to the superconducting order parameter in the new iron arsenide superconductors."
https://openalex.org/W2111831519,"Here we report on a 3.0 A crystal structure of a ternary complex of wild-type Thermus thermophilus argonaute bound to a 5'-phosphorylated 21-nucleotide guide DNA and a 20-nucleotide target RNA containing cleavage-preventing mismatches at the 10-11 step. The seed segment (positions 2 to 8) adopts an A-helical-like Watson-Crick paired duplex, with both ends of the guide strand anchored in the complex. An arginine, inserted between guide-strand bases 10 and 11 in the binary complex, locking it in an inactive conformation, is released on ternary complex formation. The nucleic-acid-binding channel between the PAZ- and PIWI-containing lobes of argonaute widens on formation of a more open ternary complex. The relationship of structure to function was established by determining cleavage activity of ternary complexes containing position-dependent base mismatch, bulge and 2'-O-methyl modifications. Consistent with the geometry of the ternary complex, bulges residing in the seed segments of the target, but not the guide strand, were better accommodated and their complexes were catalytically active."
https://openalex.org/W2051808752,"Palmitoylation regulates diverse aspects of neuronal protein trafficking and function. Here a global characterization of rat neural palmitoyl-proteomes identifies most of the known neural palmitoyl proteins—68 in total, plus more than 200 new palmitoyl-protein candidates, with further testing confirming palmitoylation for 21 of these candidates. The new palmitoyl proteins include neurotransmitter receptors, transporters, adhesion molecules, scaffolding proteins, as well as SNAREs and other vesicular trafficking proteins. Of particular interest is the finding of palmitoylation for a brain-specific Cdc42 splice variant. The palmitoylated Cdc42 isoform (Cdc42-palm) differs from the canonical, prenylated form (Cdc42-prenyl), both with regard to localization and function: Cdc42-palm concentrates in dendritic spines and has a special role in inducing these post-synaptic structures. Furthermore, assessing palmitoylation dynamics in drug-induced activity models identifies rapidly induced changes for Cdc42 as well as for other synaptic palmitoyl proteins, suggesting that palmitoylation may participate broadly in the activity-driven changes that shape synapse morphology and function. Palmitoylation, the addition of the lipid palmitate to proteins, plays an important role in modulating neuronal protein trafficking and function. A new proteomics study identifies palmitoylation as a key modifiable signal on many synapse-enriched proteins that contribute to activity-driven changes in synapse morphology and function. A large population of proteins — dubbed the neuronal 'palmitoyl-proteome' — is reversibly palmitoylated in response to neuronal activity. In particular, the study reveals a new, brain-specific isoform of the small GTPase Cdc42, whose unexpected palmitoylation specifically affects dendritic spine morphogenesis in response to neuronal activity. A proteomics study unveils a large collection of proteins that get reversibly palmitoylated in response to neuronal activity — the neuronal palmitoyl-proteome. In particular, this study focuses on the discovery of a brain-specific isoform of the small GTPase Cdc42, whose unexpected palmitoylation specifically affects dendritic spine morphogenesis in response to neuronal activity. These findings identify palmitoylation as a key modifiable signal on many synapse-enriched proteins that contribute to activity-driven changes in synapse morphology and function."
https://openalex.org/W2028222949,"DNA double-stranded breaks present a serious challenge for eukaryotic cells. The inability to repair breaks leads to genomic instability, carcinogenesis and cell death. During the double-strand break response, mammalian chromatin undergoes reorganization demarcated by H2A.X Ser 139 phosphorylation (γ-H2A.X). However, the regulation of γ-H2A.X phosphorylation and its precise role in chromatin remodelling during the repair process remain unclear. Here we report a new regulatory mechanism mediated by WSTF (Williams–Beuren syndrome transcription factor, also known as BAZ1B)—a component of the WICH complex (WSTF–ISWI ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling complex). We show that WSTF has intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity by means of a domain that shares no sequence homology to any known kinase fold. We show that WSTF phosphorylates Tyr 142 of H2A.X, and that WSTF activity has an important role in regulating several events that are critical for the DNA damage response. Our work demonstrates a new mechanism that regulates the DNA damage response and expands our knowledge of domains that contain intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. It is important for eukaryotic cells to repair DNA double-strand breaks, as failure to do so can cause genomic instability, carcinogenesis and cell death. An early cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks in mammals is the phosphorylation of the specialized histone H2A.X at serine 139. A further, previously unknown H2A.X phosphorylation site has now been identified at tyrosine 142. Phosphorylation at this site is catalysed by the chromatin remodelling factor WSTF, which is frequently absent in patients with Williams–Beuren syndrome, a developmental disease caused by a deletion on human chromosome 7. This work calls attention to a novel pathway specifically regulating chromatin reorganization during the mammalian cell DNA damage response, and sheds light on the molecular basis of Williams–Beuren syndrome. An early cellular response to the occurrence of DNA double-strand breaks in mammals is the phosphorylation of the specialized histone variant H2A.X at Ser 139. The chromatin remodelling factor WSTF is found to phosphorylate H2A.X at another site, Tyr 142. Tyrosine phosphorylation has not been observed previously on histones."
https://openalex.org/W2005406090,"The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling pathway is a critical regulator of animal development and homeostasis. Activation of the PDGF pathway leads to neointimal proliferative responses to artery injury; it promotes a switch of vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMC) to a less contractile phenotype by inhibiting the SMC-specific gene expression and increasing the rate of proliferation and migration. The molecular mechanism for these pleiotropic effects of PDGFs has not been fully described. Here, we identify the microRNA-221 (miR-221), a small noncoding RNA, as a modulator of the phenotypic change of vSMCs in response to PDGF signaling. We demonstrate that miR-221 is transcriptionally induced upon PDGF treatment in primary vSMCs, leading to down-regulation of the targets c-Kit and p27Kip1. Down-regulation of p27Kip1 by miR-221 is critical for PDGF-mediated induction of cell proliferation. Additionally, decreased c-Kit causes inhibition of SMC-specific contractile gene transcription by reducing the expression of Myocardin (Myocd), a potent SMC-specific nuclear coactivator. Our study demonstrates that PDGF signaling, by modulating the expression of miR-221, regulates two critical determinants of the vSMC phenotype; they are SMC gene expression and cell proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2164221127,"TAS1R- and TAS2R-type taste receptors are expressed in the gustatory system, where they detect sweet- and bitter-tasting stimuli, respectively. These receptors are also expressed in subsets of cells within the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, where they mediate nutrient assimilation and endocrine responses. For example, sweeteners stimulate taste receptors on the surface of gut enteroendocrine L cells to elicit an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) and secretion of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an important modulator of insulin biosynthesis and secretion. Because of the importance of taste receptors in the regulation of food intake and the alimentary responses to chemostimuli, we hypothesized that differences in taste receptor efficacy may impact glucose homeostasis. To address this issue, we initiated a candidate gene study within the Amish Family Diabetes Study and assessed the association of taste receptor variants with indicators of glucose dysregulation, including a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and high levels of blood glucose and insulin during an oral glucose tolerance test. We report that a TAS2R haplotype is associated with altered glucose and insulin homeostasis. We also found that one SNP within this haplotype disrupts normal responses of a single receptor, TAS2R9, to its cognate ligands ofloxacin, procainamide and pirenzapine. Together, these findings suggest that a functionally compromised TAS2R receptor negatively impacts glucose homeostasis, providing an important link between alimentary chemosensation and metabolic disease."
https://openalex.org/W1963896019,"Geometric frustration arises when lattice structure prevents simultaneous minimization of local interaction energies. It leads to highly degenerate ground states and, subsequently, to complex phases of matter, such as water ice, spin ice, and frustrated magnetic materials. Here we report a simple geometrically frustrated system composed of closely packed colloidal spheres confined between parallel walls. Diameter-tunable microgel spheres are self-assembled into a buckled triangular lattice with either up or down displacements, analogous to an antiferromagnetic Ising model on a triangular lattice. Experiment and theory reveal single-particle dynamics governed by in-plane lattice distortions that partially relieve frustration and produce ground states with zigzagging stripes and subextensive entropy, rather than the more random configurations and extensive entropy of the antiferromagnetic Ising model. This tunable soft-matter system provides a means to directly visualize the dynamics of frustration, thermal excitations and defects."
https://openalex.org/W2011753511,"The overall fidelity of protein synthesis has been thought to rely on the combined accuracy of two basic processes: the aminoacylation of transfer RNAs with their cognate amino acid by the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and the selection of cognate aminoacyl-tRNAs by the ribosome in cooperation with the GTPase elongation factor EF-Tu. These two processes, which together ensure the specific acceptance of a correctly charged cognate tRNA into the aminoacyl (A) site, operate before peptide bond formation. Here we report the identification of an additional mechanism that contributes to high fidelity protein synthesis after peptidyl transfer, using a well-defined in vitro bacterial translation system. In this retrospective quality control step, the incorporation of an amino acid from a non-cognate tRNA into the growing polypeptide chain leads to a general loss of specificity in the A site of the ribosome, and thus to a propagation of errors that results in abortive termination of protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2039222039,"The identity of the transporter responsible for fructose absorption in the intestine in vivo and its potential role in fructose-induced hypertension remain speculative. Here we demonstrate that Glut5 (Slc2a5) deletion reduced fructose absorption by approximately 75% in the jejunum and decreased the concentration of serum fructose by approximately 90% relative to wild-type mice on increased dietary fructose. When fed a control (60% starch) diet, Glut5(-/-) mice had normal blood pressure and displayed normal weight gain. However, whereas Glut5(+/+) mice showed enhanced salt absorption in their jejuna in response to luminal fructose and developed systemic hypertension when fed a high fructose (60% fructose) diet for 14 weeks, Glut5(-/-) mice did not display fructose-stimulated salt absorption in their jejuna, and they experienced a significant impairment of nutrient absorption in their intestine with accompanying hypotension as early as 3-5 days after the start of a high fructose diet. Examination of the intestinal tract of Glut5(-/-) mice fed a high fructose diet revealed massive dilatation of the caecum and colon, consistent with severe malabsorption, along with a unique adaptive up-regulation of ion transporters. In contrast to the malabsorption of fructose, Glut5(-/-) mice did not exhibit an absorption defect when fed a high glucose (60% glucose) diet. We conclude that Glut5 is essential for the absorption of fructose in the intestine and plays a fundamental role in the generation of fructose-induced hypertension. Deletion of Glut5 results in a serious nutrient-absorptive defect and volume depletion only when the animals are fed a high fructose diet and is associated with compensatory adaptive up-regulation of ion-absorbing transporters in the colon."
https://openalex.org/W2163013741,"Methylmalonic acidemia is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism caused by defective activity of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT) that exhibits multiorgan system pathology. To examine whether mitochondrial dysfunction is a feature of this organic acidemia, a background-modified Mut-knockout mouse model was constructed and used to examine mitochondrial ultrastructure and respiratory chain function in the tissues that manifest pathology in humans. In parallel, the liver from a patient with mut methylmalonic acidemia was studied in a similar fashion. Megamitochondria formed early in life in the hepatocytes of the Mut(-/-) animals and progressively enlarged. Liver extracts prepared from the mutants at multiple time points displayed respiratory chain dysfunction, with diminished cytochrome c oxidase activity and reduced intracellular glutathione compared to control littermates. Over time, the exocrine pancreas and proximal tubules of the kidney also exhibited megamitochondria, and older mutant mice eventually developed tubulointerstitial renal disease. The patient liver displayed similar morphological and enzymatic findings as observed in the murine tissues. These murine and human studies establish that megamitochondria formation with respiratory chain dysfunction occur in a tissue-specific fashion in methylmalonic acidemia and suggest treatment approaches based on improving mitochondrial function and ameliorating the effects of oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2050622608,"Carbon monoxide, a classical respiratory inhibitor, also exerts vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects. CO-releasing molecules have therapeutic value, increasing phagocytosis and reducing sepsis-induced lethality. Here we identify for the first time the bacterial targets of Ru(CO)3Cl(glycinate) (CORM-3), a ruthenium-based carbonyl that liberates CO rapidly under physiological conditions. Contrary to the expectation that CO would be preferentially inhibitory at low oxygen tensions or anaerobically, Escherichia coli cultures were also sensitive to CORM-3 at concentrations equimolar with oxygen. CORM-3, assayed as ruthenium, was taken up by bacteria and rapidly delivered CO intracellularly to terminal oxidases. Microarray analysis of CORM-3-treated cells revealed extensively modified gene expression, notably down-regulation of genes encoding key aerobic respiratory complexes. Genes involved in metal metabolism, homeostasis, or transport were also differentially expressed, and free intracellular zinc levels were elevated. Probabilistic modeling of transcriptomic data identified the global transcription regulators ArcA, CRP, Fis, FNR, Fur, BaeR, CpxR, and IHF as targets and potential CO sensors. Our discovery that CORM-3 is an effective inhibitor and global regulator of gene expression, especially under aerobic conditions, has important implications for administration of CO-releasing agents in sepsis and inflammation.

Our discovery that CORM-3 is an effective inhibitor and global regulator of gene expression, especially under aerobic conditions, has important implications for administration of CO-releasing agents in sepsis and inflammation. It has been recognized for over 80 years that carbon monoxide (CO) combines with ferrous hemoglobin, competing with oxygen and inhibiting respiration (1Keilin D. The History of Cell Respiration and Cytochrome. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1966: 252-268Google Scholar). Recently, however, CO has been shown to have unexpected and profound physiological effects in higher organisms. Inducible heme oxygenase-1 and constitutive heme oxygenase-2 degrade heme to generate CO that has vasodilatory, antiflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects (2Boczkowski J. Poderoso J.J. Motterlini R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 614-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The CO is thought to target transition elements in biological systems, particularly hemes (in oxidases, globins, and CO sensors, for example) (3Roberts G.P. Youn H. Kerby R.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 453-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), nickel (in CO dehydrogenase), and complex nickel-, iron- and sulfur-containing clusters (2Boczkowski J. Poderoso J.J. Motterlini R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 614-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The impact of CO in physiology and medicine has prompted development of metal carbonyl compounds (carbon monoxide-releasing molecules; CO-RMs) 2The abbreviations used are: CO-RM, CO-releasing molecule; CORM-2, (Ru(CO)3Cl2)2; CORM-3, Ru(CO)3Cl(glycinate); ICP-AES, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. 2The abbreviations used are: CO-RM, CO-releasing molecule; CORM-2, (Ru(CO)3Cl2)2; CORM-3, Ru(CO)3Cl(glycinate); ICP-AES, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. to deliver CO in biological environments. Such molecules are pharmacologically active, eliciting vasodilation in isolated aorta and mediating hypotension in vivo (4Motterlini R. Clark J.E. Foresti R. Sarathchandra P. Mann B.E. Green C.J. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: E17-E24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Newer water-soluble CO-RMs have revealed roles for CO in suppression of inflammation, protection against hypoxia-reoxygenation and oxidative stress, and mitigation of myocardial infarction and other disorders (5Motterlini R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 1142-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).Considering the potent biological activities of CO and CO-RMs, we know little about CO toxicity toward microorganisms, despite CO being a stable gas that might find application in antimicrobial therapies. Indeed, recent studies in inflammatory models of disease, such as endotoxin exposure, suggest that heme oxygenase-1 and its products exert beneficial effects in mice (6Ryter S.W. Alam J. Choi A.M.K. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 583-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar, 7Otterbein L.E. Bach F.H. Alam J. Soares M. Tao Lu H. Wysk M. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Choi A.M. Nat.

Physiol. 2006; 290: G695-G703Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) generated by HO activity and CO significantly suppress the inflammatory response (10Sawle P. Foresti R. Mann B.E. Johnson T.R. Green C.J. Motterlini R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 145: 800-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), it is now clear that heme oxygenase-1-derived CO plays an important role in the antimicrobial process without inhibiting the inflammatory response (11Chung S.W. Liu X. Macias A.A. Baron R.M. Perrella M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). HO-deficient mice suffered exaggerated lethality from polymicrobial sepsis, whereas heme oxygenase-1 overexpression improved survival from Enterococcus faecalis-induced sepsis (11Chung S.W. Liu X. Macias A.A. Baron R.M. Perrella M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for CO involvement came from injection of tricarbonyldichlororuthenium(II) dimer (Ru(CO)3Cl2)2 (CORM-2) into wild-type mice, which increased phagocytosis and rescued heme oxygenase-1-deficient mice from sepsis-induced lethality. CO-RM-derived CO also inhibits bacterial growth and viability in vitro (12Nobre L.S. Seixas J.D. Romao C.C. Saraiva L.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2007; 51: 4303-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The effectiveness of CORM-2 and Ru(CO)3Cl(glycinate) (CORM-3) was greater in near anaerobic environments, suggesting competitive inhibition of oxygen utilization, but no link between the established hemoprotein reactivity of CO and the antibacterial activity of CO-RMs has been demonstrated.Exploiting the antimicrobial utility of CO and CO-RMs requires an understanding of the growth inhibitory effects and elucidation of the stress responses elicited. Here, we demonstrate that CORM-3 possesses potent antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, particularly aerobically, and that in such cells, the compound is internalized and delivers CO to terminal oxidases. Moreover, the growth-inhibitory effects correlate with the results of a transcriptomic study and application of a probabilistic systems model, which reveal for the first time that bacteria mount a global response to CORM-3 involving aerobically eight transcription factors. We anticipate that understanding the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of CO delivery and toxicity and the cognate bacterial stress responses will contribute toward utilization of CO-RMs in sepsis and other clinical applications.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESE. coli Strains and Growth Conditions—All strains used were E. coli K-12 derivatives; the wild type was MG1655. Strains carrying lacZ transcriptional fusions were ECL933 (Φ(cyo-lac) bla+ cyo+) (13Iuchi S. Chepuri V. Fu H.A. Gennis R.B. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6020-6025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), MC4100 λRS88 (spy-lacZ) (14Raivio T.L. Laird M.W. Joly J.C. Silhavy T.J. Mol.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The cyo mutant was RKP4544 (cyo::kan; laboratory collection). Cells were grown in defined medium with glycerol (54 mm) as sole carbon source, as before (16Flatley J. Barrett J. Pullan S.T. Hughes M.N. Green J. Poole R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10065-10072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For anaerobic growth, fumarate was added as terminal electron acceptor (50 mm), in addition to LB (5%, v/v) and casamino acids (0.1%, w/v), to give a growth rate comparable with aerobic cultures. For aerobic growth, cells were grown in 30 ml of defined medium in 250-ml baffled flasks fitted with side arms for measurements of optical density with a Klett meter (red filter) during shaking at 200 rpm and 37 °C. Anaerobic growth was in Klett-compatible 8.5-ml screw cap tubes, filled to the brim with defined medium, at 37 °C in a water bath. For viability assays, anaerobic cells were grown in 175-ml batch cultures in defined medium in stirred (200 rpm) minifermenter vessels (17Lee L.J. Barrett J.A. Poole R.K. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1124-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) modified for anoxic sampling by sparging with N2. Starter cultures were grown in defined medium (anaerobic) or 10 ml of LB (aerobic); for the latter, cells were harvested and resuspended in defined medium before inoculation. Viability was determined after dilution of samples in water by plating 10-μl drops on nutrient agar. Protein concentrations were measured using the Markwell assay (18Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5290) Google Scholar).CORM-3 and CO Treatments—CORM-3 (Hemocorm) was prepared as a 100 mm stock solution in distilled water freshly for each experiment. RuCl2(DMSO)4 was prepared similarly. CO-saturated solutions were made by bubbling CO gas (CP grade) from a cylinder (BOC, Guildford, UK) through buffer for 20 min, resulting in a 1.8 mm stock solution. CORM-3, RuCl2(DMSO)4, and CO-saturated solution were added directly to growing cultures in log phase, determined by a Klett OD of ∼40 (when grown in side arm flasks or screw cap tubes) or an A600 of ∼0.5 (when grown in minifermenter vessels).Uptake of CORM-3 by Growing Cells—CORM-3 was added during logarithmic phase to aerobic (final concentration 30 μm) and anaerobic (final concentration 100 μm) cultures. After 15 min, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min (4K15; Sigma) in polypropylene tubes (62.547.004 (50 ml) or 62.554.001 (15 ml); Sarstedt). Culture supernatants were retained for analysis. Cell pellets were washed three times in 0.5% HNO3 (0.5 ml; Aristar nitric acid (69%, v/v)) to remove loosely bound elements. Supernatants collected from the washes were also retained for analysis. Pellets were resuspended in HNO3 (0.5 ml, 69%) and placed in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min to break the cells. The resultant digest was then quantitatively transferred to a calibrated 15-ml tube and made up to 5 ml with 1% HNO3. Samples were analyzed using a Spectro CirosCCD (Spectro Analytical) inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) using background correction. Calibration curves were created for each element to be tested using multielement standard solutions containing 0.1, 0.2, 1, 5, and 10 mg/liter. The wavelengths for elements reported here were 213.856 nm (zinc) and 240.272 nm (ruthenium). A 1% nitric acid solution in MilliQ water was used as a blank and to dilute cell digests before ICP-AES analysis. Elemental recoveries were calculated from these samples.Calculation of Dry Cell Weight and Intracellular Ruthenium Concentrations—Dry weight was determined by filtering known volumes of culture (usually 10, 20, and 30 ml) through preweighed cellulose nitrate filters, 47-mm diameter and pore size of 0.2 μm (Millipore Corp.). The filters had previously been dried at 105 °C for 18-24 h to constant weight. Filters were again dried at 105 °C until a constant weight was attained, which was recorded. Alternatively, bacteria were sedimented in preweighed, dried centrifuge tubes, which were reweighed after drying to constant weight. Both methods gave similar results. To calculate intracellular ruthenium concentrations, we adopted published values for individual cell dry mass and volume (19Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Schaechter M. Physiology of the Bacterial Cell: A Molecular Approach. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1990: 1-29Google Scholar). Values in Table 1 are means of two growth experiments, with each sample being assayed in triplicate by ICP-AES.TABLE 1Uptake of CORM-3 by aerobically and anaerobically growing E. coliRutheniumRuthenium in cellRecoverycExpressed as the sum of ruthenium assayed in the culture supernatant, washes and cell pellet as a percentage of the added ruthenium in the form of CORM-3.Added as CORM-3Culture supernatantPellet washesaOnly given where determinations exceed limits of detection.Cell pelletbRuthenium levels in control cells were less than the limits of detection, defined as 3 × S.D. of a blank sample.μgmm%Aerobic26.419.40.0670.4020981.0Anaerobic85.963.20.720.2821480.7a Only given where determinations exceed limits of detection.b Ruthenium levels in control cells were less than the limits of detection, defined as 3 × S.D. of a blank sample.c Expressed as the sum of ruthenium assayed in the culture supernatant, washes and cell pellet as a percentage of the added ruthenium in the form of CORM-3.

Galinina N. Bringer-Meyer S. Poole R.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 168: 91-97PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were reduced with dithionite; after treatment with CORM-3, CO, or RuCl2(DMSO)4, spectra were recorded in triplicate (10-mm path length) and averaged. For myoglobin competition analysis, 8 μm CORM-3 was added to cells or buffer with dithionite. Myoglobin (10 μm) was added at 0, 10, and 20 min, and spectra were recorded using a base line of either reduced cells and myoglobin or reduced buffer. The contribution of cytochrome o to CO difference spectra was determined by a deconvolution method. From the CO difference spectrum (mean of three scans) of cyo::kan cells was subtracted the spectrum of purified cytochrome bd (21Borisov V.B. Sedelnikova S.E. Poole R.K. Konstantinov A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22095-22099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), such that the distinctive signals in the red region (575-675 nm) were brought to zero. The resultant residual and the cytochrome bd spectrum were then subtracted from a scan of wild-type cells, leaving only the cytochrome bo′ spectrum. Samples were taken from cultures after exposure to CORM-3, and the harvested cells were washed and resuspended in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5); respiration was measured using a Clark type polarographic oxygen electrode (Rank Brothers) at 37 °C (22Gilberthorpe N.J.

For assays of Φ(zntA-lacZ) activity (15Binet M.R.B. Poole R.K.

At log phase (Klett OD ∼ 40 or A600 ∼ 0.5), CORM-3 (30 μm for aerobic cells, 100 μm for anaerobic cells) was added, and after 15 min, 30 ml of culture was added to chilled phenol (188 μl)/ethanol (3.6 ml) and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was prepared using an RNeasy minikit from Qiagen, from four biological repeats of control and CORM-3-exposed cells. Other procedures were as described before (16Flatley J. Barrett J. Pullan S.T.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (8211) Google Scholar).Modeling Transcription Factor Activities—Transcriptomic data were analyzed using a probabilistic model (26Sanguinetti G. Lawrence N.D. Rattray M. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 2775-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which adopts a log-linear approximation to the transcriptional reaction to changes in transcription factor activity. Changes in gene expression as a weighted linear combination of changes in transcription factor activity are given by Equation 1.Here, yn is the log-fold change for the nth gene, Xnm is a binary matrix encoding the structure of the regulatory network (obtained from the literature), bnm is the unknown rate constant for activation/repression, cm is the (log) change in transcription factor activity, and ∊n is an error term. Both the rate constants and the transcription factor activity changes are given zero mean normal priors. Standard statistical inference techniques provide estimates of the changes in activity of regulators from an analysis of the behavior of their targets. This technique has been applied to reconstructing the regulatory response in E. coli to the transition between aerobic and microaerobic conditions (27Partridge J.D. Sanguinetti G. Dibden D.P. Roberts R.E. Poole R.K. Green J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11230-11237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).RESULTSCORM-3, but Not a Solution of CO Gas, Targets both Aerobically and Anaerobically Growing E. coli—To establish conditions for CO-RM toxicity, we first defined the growth-inhibitory effects of CORM-3, a proprietary water-soluble CO-RM (28Clark J.E. Naughton P. Shurey S. Green C.J. Johnson T.R. Mann B.E. Foresti R. Motterlini R. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: e2-e8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first tested CORM-3 against an anaerobic culture with glycerol as carbon source and fumarate as terminal electron acceptor, expecting the absence of oxygen, with which CO competes, to reveal maximal CORM-3 toxicity. The addition of 100 μm CORM-3 slowed growth, but higher concentrations (200 μm) were required to inhibit growth completely (Fig. S1A). However, under these aerobic conditions (Fig. S1B), CORM-3 at only 30 μm inhibited growth, and 100 μm CORM-3 totally prevented further growth. Inoculation of cells into media containing 250 μm CORM-3 also prevented growth and killed a significant proportion of cells within 2 h (not shown). However, the same concentrations of CO added as a CO-saturated solution did not prevent anaerobic or aerobic growth; nor did RuCl2(DMSO)4, a compound with similar structure to CORM-3 but where the carbonyl groups have been replaced with DMSO (28Clark J.E. Naughton P. Shurey S. Green C.J. Johnson T.R. Mann B.E. Foresti R. Motterlini R. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: e2-e8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. S1, A and B, insets).The toxicity of CORM-3 was also investigated by measuring cell viability under our growth conditions. Anaerobically, 100 μm CORM-3 had no effect on viable counts within 2 h (Fig. S2A). Aerobically, 30 μm CORM-3 was without effect on viability within 10 min but caused a 10-fold reduction in counts after 2 h. However, 125 μm CORM-3 reduced the viable count by 104-fold within 30 min; the marked increase in toxicity between 30 and 125 μm CORM (Fig. S2B) may reflect the level of accumulation of CORM-3 (see below). The toxicity of CORM-3, but not RuCl2(DMSO)4, to aerobic cells was also confirmed by fluorescent live/dead staining (Invitrogen); SYTO 9 stains all bacteria green, whereas propidium iodide penetrates only bacteria with damaged membranes and stains them red while reducing the amount of SYTO 9 when both are present. Aerobically, the addition of CORM-3 caused a 48% reduction in the percentage of live cells (only green) and an increase in the percentage of dead and unhealthy cells (red or red/green), but anaerobically, CORM-3 did not reduce the percentage of live cells. RuCl2(DMSO)4 was without effect on the proportions of live and dead cells (data not shown). Thus, CORM-3 is a potent antibacterial molecule even under aerobic conditions.Uptake of CORM-3 by Growing Cells—To demonstrate uptake of CORM-3 by both aerobic and anaerobic cells, we assayed for the presence of ruthenium from the Ru(CO)3Cl(glycinate), since the radiolabeled compound is unavailable. Assays by ICP-AES of cells from CORM-3-treated cultures, after extensive washing and digestion to solubilize biomass, are presented in Table 1. The levels of ruthenium detected in control cells not treated with CORM-3 were insignificant as expected, since ruthenium has no known biological function. The majority of CORM-3 added was recovered in the culture supernatant, and small amounts were found in the washings after treating cells with dilute HNO3. Although the absolute amounts of ruthenium recovered in digested cells were also small, these levels equated with significant intracellular concentrations, assuming literature values (19Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Schaechter M. Physiology of the Bacterial Cell: A Molecular Approach. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1990: 1-29Google Scholar) for the mass and volumes of individual cells. For aerobic cells, the estimated intracellular ruthenium concentration (209 μm) exceeds by 7-fold the concentration in the culture, whereas for anaerobic cells, the accumulation is 2.1-fold. Recoveries in the procedure of over 80% testify to the reliability of the analytical data. In a further pair of experiments on aerobic cells, the recovery was lower (63%), but again a high level of intracellular uptake of ruthenium (168 μm) was demonstrated (results not shown). Thus, CORM-3 (and the CO released, 1 CO per CORM molecule) is taken up to achieve concentrations significantly greater than those in the external medium, and the capacity of aerobically grown cells to accumulate CORM-3 appears greater than for anaerobic cells, given the higher external CORM-3 concentrations used for the latter. Thus, in terms of intracellular uptake of ruthenium and the observed effects on cell viability (Fig. S2), 30 μm CORM-3 for aerobic cells equates with 100 μm CORM for anaerobic cells. The uptake of ruthenium after treatment of aerobic cells with 125 μm CORM was not investigated due to the extreme toxicity observed under these conditions.CO Is Delivered Intracellularly by CORM-3—Since CORM-3 is taken up by growing cells and is an effective inhibitor of growth at concentrations where dissolved CO gas is not, we investigated further CO delivery. The high affinity of ferrous sperm whale myoglobin for CO (kon/koff = 2 × 107 m-1), and the impermeability of bacterial cells to myoglobin (16.7 kDa) allows distinction between extracellular and intracellular CO. When CORM-3 and myoglobin at nearly equimolar concentrations were mixed in the absence of bacteria, there was immediate formation of the carbonmonoxy adduct, characterized by the appearance in CO difference spectra (reduced myoglobin plus CO minus reduced myoglobin) (Fig. 1) of a Soret maximum at 426 nm and minimum at 442 nm (29Wood P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 293-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In contrast, myoglobin addition to bacteria supplemented with CORM-3 detected reduced levels of CO; within 10 min of CORM-3 addition to bacteria, only 28% of the initial CO was found by the myoglobin competition assay, and after 20 min, only 15% was found (Fig. 1). Thus, in support of the ICP-AES assays, CORM-3 rapidly enters bacterial cells and renders CO inaccessible to exogenous myoglobin.CORM-3 Inhibits Bacterial Respiration and Reacts with Terminal Oxidases—We next investigated the nature of the intracellular targets. Although CO is a classical inhibitor of respiration, high partial pressures of CO relative to O2 (typically 9:1) are required for significant competitive inhibition (1Keilin D. The History of Cell Respiration and Cytochrome. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1966: 252-268Google Scholar). Surprisingly, CORM-3 (125 or 250 μm) was an effective inhibitor of bacterial cell respiration when added to vigorously aerated cultures at concentrations equimolar with dissolved oxygen (i.e. ∼200 μm) (Fig. 2A). Neither CO added as a gaseous solution nor RuCl2(DMSO)4 was effective as an inhibitor under these conditions. Inhibition of respiration by 125 μm CORM-3 was rapid, 50% inhibition being achieved within 10 min of CORM-3 addition (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2CORM-3 inhibits bacterial aerobic respiration. In A, cultures were grown to midlog phase and then exposed for 2 h to 125 or 250 μm CORM-3 (black bars), RuCl2(DMSO)4 (dark hatched bars), or CO gas-saturated solution (light hatched bars); controls (no addition) are shown by white bars. Protein concentration of the suspensions was 4.5 mg ml-1. The asterisks denote significant differences from control. *, p < 0.01; **, p < 0.002; ***, p < 0.001. B shows the time course of inhibition by 125 μm CORM-3 of cell respiration (2.6 mg protein ml-1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inhibition of respiration by CO was accompanied by rapid formation of carbonmonoxy adducts of terminal oxidases within intact cells when CORM-3 was added exogenously (Fig. 3). Immediately after CORM-3 addition to E. coli cells, the distinctive α-band at 648 nm of the CO compound of cytochrome d was formed, with an accompanying change in the Soret region near 448 nm. Subsequently, the Soret features intensified, and a trough formed at 560 nm, without change at 648 nm, suggesting CO reactivity with a cytochrome of lower CO affinity. This component is probably the oxidase cytochrome bo′ based on the appearance of the Soret band at 422 nm (the CO-ligated ferrous species) and a trough at 434 nm (the loss of the ferrous signal) (29Wood P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 293-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 30Poole R.K. Waring A.J. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1979; 184: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, the addition of a similar concentration of RuCl2(DMSO)4 did not result in reaction with cytochrome d over 60 min (Fig. S3), but absorbance minima of lower magnitude centered at 432 and 562 nm indicated cytochrome oxidation, perhaps due to the DMSO moiety of RuCl2(DMSO)4. We conclude that CORM-3, but not RuCl2(DMSO)4, or CO administered as a gas, is an effective respiratory inhibitor, an activity that is attributable to CO release and reaction with terminal oxidases.FIGURE 3Reaction of terminal oxidases in vivo with CORM-3 (2 mm) added to intact cells in a dual wavelength spectrophotometer.

https://openalex.org/W2126697426,"Several neurotransmitters act through G-protein-coupled receptors to evoke a 'slow' excitation of neurons. These include peptides, such as substance P and neurotensin, as well as acetylcholine and noradrenaline. Unlike the fast (approximately millisecond) ionotropic actions of small-molecule neurotransmitters, the slow excitation is not well understood at the molecular level, but can be mainly attributed to suppressing K(+) currents and/or activating a non-selective cation channel. The molecular identity of this cation channel has yet to be determined; similarly, how the channel is activated and its relative contribution to neuronal excitability induced by the neuropeptides are unknown. Here we show that, in the mouse hippocampal and ventral tegmental area neurons, substance P and neurotensin activate a channel complex containing NALCN and a large previously unknown protein UNC-80. The activation by substance P through TACR1 (a G-protein-coupled receptor for substance P) occurs by means of a unique mechanism: it does not require G-protein activation but is dependent on Src family kinases. These findings identify NALCN as the cation channel activated by substance P receptor, and suggest that UNC-80 and Src family kinases, rather than a G protein, are involved in the coupling from receptor to channel."

Advances in the understanding of the SOCE pathway led us to examine more precisely its role in post-natal human myoblast differentiation. We found that SOCE orchestrated by STIM1, the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensor activating Orai Ca2+ channels, is crucial. Silencing STIM1, Orai1, or Orai3 reduced SOCE amplitude and myoblast differentiation, whereas Orai2 knockdown had no effect. Conversely, overexpression of STIM1 with Orai1 increased SOCE and accelerated myoblast differentiation. STIM1 or Orai1 silencing decreased resting [Ca2+]in and intracellular Ca2+ store content, but correction of these parameters did not rescue myoblast differentiation. Remarkably, SOCE amplitude correlated linearly with the expression of two early markers of myoblast differentiation, MEF2 and myogenin, regardless of the STIM or Orai isoform that was silenced. Unexpectedly, we found that the hyperpolarization also depends on SOCE, placing SOCE upstream of K+ channel activation in the signaling cascade that controls myoblast differentiation.

Two major SOCE components have been identified; the stromal interaction molecules (STIM) and the Orai family of channels (also known as CRACM). STIM1 is the transmembrane ER Ca2+ sensor that activates SOCE upon Ca2+ store depletion (7Liou J. Kim M.L. Heo W.D. Jones J.T. Myers J.W. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Meyer T. Curr.

Vig M. Koomoa D.L. Beck A. Nadler M.J. Koblan-Huberson M. Lis A. Fleig A. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Nat.

These genetic studies generated indirect evidence that point to a role for SOCE in the growth, repair, or survival of skeletal muscle. In mice, Orai1 and STIM1 are expressed at high levels in skeletal tissue, and genetic ablation of Orai1 or STIM1 causes a severe growth defect, the Orai1 or STIM1 null mice being much smaller than its wild-type littermates until maturity (25Vig M.

These facts led us to re-examine with new tools the role of the SOCE pathway in primary culture of human myoblasts. In this study, we used gene silencing and overexpression to investigate the role of STIM1 and Orai channels during the differentiation process of cultured myoblasts derived from human muscle biopsies. We show that silencing of STIM1, Orai1, or Orai3 greatly reduces SOCE and impairs myoblast differentiation, whereas Orai2 knockdown had no effects. Strikingly, the amplitude of SOCE correlated with the degree of differentiation regardless of the molecule that was depleted. Conversely, enforced expression of STIM1 together with Orai1 increased SOCE and accelerated the differentiation of myoblasts. STIM1 and Orai1 were up-regulated during the first 2 days of myoblast differentiation, but their depletion at this stage neither delayed the differentiation process nor impaired late myogenic events such as cell fusion, indicating that the molecules were only limiting during the initial phase of differentiation. Accordingly, the plasma membrane hyperpolarization that we previously described as the earliest known event in myoblast differentiation (3Konig S. Beguet A. Bader C.R. Bernheim L. Development. 2006; 133: 3107-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was impaired in cells depleted for STIM1 or Orai1, confirming that SOCE regulates the very early steps (<6 h) of the differentiation process. Together, our data indicate that STIM1 and Orai1 are key signaling molecules that control the initiation of the differentiation process of human myoblasts that eventually leads to contractile myotubes. Cell Culture—Muscle samples, cell dissociation, and clonal culture from satellite cells were prepared as previously described (1Arnaudeau S. Holzer N. Konig S. Bader C.R. Bernheim L. J. Cell.

Human muscle samples were obtained from 10 children (younger than 4 years old) without any known neuromuscular disease. 21 different clones were used in this study. The level of differentiation was assessed by quantification of the nuclear expression of the myogenic transcription factor MEF2 and myogenin (2Konig S. Hinard V. Arnaudeau S. Holzer N. Potter G. Bader C.R. Bernheim L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28187-28196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Plasmids (human Orai1-myc from Addgene plasmid 12199 and STIM1-wt from ORIGENE Technologies) were transfected by electroporation as previously described (31Espinos E. Liu J.H. Bader C.R. Bernheim L. Neuromuscul. Disord. 2001; 11: 341-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency assessed for STIM1-YFP by FACS was of 83 ± 7% (n = 12). Small Interference RNA (siRNA) Knockdown—Myoblasts were transfected in suspension by incubating 4 × 105 cells in a solution containing 500 μl of Opti-MEM, 3 μl of Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen), and 20 pmol of a specific siRNA (Ambion or Qiagen) according to manufacturer protocols (Invitrogen). The transfection efficiency assessed by Block-iT Alexa Fluor Red Fluorescent Oligo (Invitrogen) measurements was approximately 90%. Optimal quantities of Lipofectamine and siRNA were defined by evaluating the strongest effect of siRNA STIM1 on SOCE (see below) and were constantly used thereafter. This optimal effect was obtained 36 to 48 h post-transfection. Sequences of the different siRNA are summarized on Table 1. The siRNA Med Universal Control-siMed from Invitrogen was used as a negative control.TABLE 1Sequences of the siRNA and primers used for the real time RT-PCRSenseaAll sequences are oriented 5′ −3′.AntisenseaAll sequences are oriented 5′ −3′.siRNASTIM1GGCUCUGGAUACAGUGCUCdTdTGAGCACUGUAUCCAGAGCCdTdTSTIM1bsiRNA from Qiagen.GGAAGAUGGUAUAGGUGAAdTdTUUCACCUAUACCAUCUUCCdTdTOrailGGCGGAGUUUGCCCGCUUAdTdTUAAGCGGGCAAACUCCGCCdAdGOrail1bsiRNA from Qiagen.CGUGCACAAUCUCAACUCGdTdTCGAGUUGAGAUUGUGCACGdTdTOrai2bsiRNA from Qiagen.CUCUUGUCUUAAUACCAUAdTdTUAUGGUAUUAAGACAAGAGdGdAOrai3GCUGUGAGCAACAUCCACAdTdTUGUGGAUGUUGCUCACAGCdTdTOrai3bsiRNA from Qiagen.UUGAAGCUGUGAGCAACAUdTdTAUGUUGCUCACAGCUUCAAdTdTPCR primersSTIM1TGACAGGGACTGTGCTGAAGAAGAGAGGAGGCCCAAAGAGOrai1GCTCATGATCAGCACCTGCACGGGACTCCTTGACCGAGTTGOrai2CTGCATCCTGCCCAATGTGGAGTTCAGGTTGTGGATGTTGCTOrai3AGCTGTGAGCAACATCCACAACCCACGTAGCGGTGCAGTCTβ2-MicroglobulinTGCTCGCGCTACTCTCTCTTTTCTGCTGGATGACGTGAGTAAACglucuronidase BCCACCAGGGACCATCCAATAGTCAAAATATGTGTTCTGGACAAAGTAAEEF1A1AGCAAAAATGACCCACCAATGGGCCTGGATGGTTCAGGTAGAPDHGCACAAGAGGAAGAGAGAGACCAGGGGAGATTCAGTGTGGTGa All sequences are oriented 5′ −3′.b siRNA from Qiagen. Open table in a new tab Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using the QIAshredder and the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer protocols. One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with the Superscript RT II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time experiments were performed at the Genomics Platform of the NCCR Frontiers in Genetics (Geneva). For each PCR reaction, 1/20th of the cDNA template was PCR-amplified in a 7900HT SDS System using Power SYBR Green PCR master mix (both from Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). We obtained raw threshold-cycle (Ct) values using SDS 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems). A mean quantity was calculated from triplicate PCR reactions for each sample, and this quantity was normalized to the average of four endogenous control genes (glucuronidase B, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, β2-microglobulin and EE-EF1) as described by Vandesompele et al. (32Vandesompele J. De P.K. Pattyn F. Poppe B. Van R.N. De P.A. Speleman F. Genome Biology. 2002; 3: 34.1-34.11Crossref Google Scholar). Primers used for the real-time PCR are described in Table 1. Immunostaining—Myoblasts were fixed and stained with the appropriate fluorescent markers as described previously (1Arnaudeau S. Holzer N. Konig S. Bader C.R. Bernheim L. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 208: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Anti-MEF2 antibody (1:200; sc-313, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Heidelberg, Germany) and anti-myogenin antibody (1:900; clone F5D, BD Biosciences) were used together with anti-GOK/STIM1 antibody (1:500; BD Biosciences). Secondary antibodies used were Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and Alexa 546-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; Molecular Probes). DAPI (100 ng/ml; Sigma) was used to localize nuclei. Images were acquired using a Zeiss Axiovert S100 TV Microscope equipped with a Cairn Optoscan monochromator and a motorized stage. The DAPI, Alexa 488, and Alexa 546 fluorescence were acquired by changing the excitation wavelengths with the monochromator using a triple band filter set (XF2050 dichroic mirror and XF3063 emission filter from Omega Optical Inc., Brattleboro, VT). The motorized stage was used to automatically acquire 10 random fields in each condition (200-400 cells/condition). Analysis to count the labeled nuclei was carried out using the Metamorph 6.3r7 software (Molecular Devices Corp., Visitron Systems GmbH, Puchheim, Germany). A cluster of labeled nuclei inside a myotube that clearly express MEF2 or myogenin was used to define the threshold above which nuclei were considered as positive for the expression of MEF2 or myogenin (10 random fields for each clone). Western Blots—Western blots were performed as previously described (2Konig S. Hinard V. Arnaudeau S. Holzer N. Potter G. Bader C.R. Bernheim L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28187-28196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, myoblasts were lysed using PhosphoSafe Extraction Buffer (Novagen). Total proteins were separated on a SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated in T-TBS (0.1% Tween 20, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl) and 5% nonfat milk. Blots were incubated with the primary antibodies diluted in T-TBS and nonfat milk as follows: mouse monoclonal antibody anti-GOK/STIM1 1:500 (BD Biosciences) or rabbit polyclonal anti-STIM2 antibody (1:500; ProSci Inc.) and mouse monoclonal antibody against α-tubulin (clone DM1A, Sigma) 1:10,000. Blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse diluted 1:6000 (Bio-Rad) or with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit diluted 1:6000 (Bio-Rad), respectively. Antibodies were revealed using ECL reagents and Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Optiquant 03.00 (Packard instrument Co.) program was used to quantify the level of protein expression. Cytosolic Calcium Measurements—Myoblasts grown on coverslips were loaded 30 min at room temperature with the cellpermeant fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Fura-2-AM (Biotium Inc., Chemie Brunschwig AG, Basel, Switzerland). Fura-2-AM preparation was done as described previously (1Arnaudeau S. Holzer N. Konig S. Bader C.R. Bernheim L. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 208: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Ratiometric images of Ca2+ signals were obtained using a Zeiss Axiovert S100 TV microscope (Zeiss AG, Feldbach, Switzerland) equipped with a Cairn Optoscan monochromator (Cairn Research Ltd., Faversham, UK) which rapidly changed the excitation wavelengths between 340 and 380 nm. Fluorescence emissions were captured through a 510WB40 filter (Omega Optical Inc.) using a CoolSnap HQ camera (Photometrics-Ropper Scientific, Tucson, AZ). Image acquisition and analysis were carried out with the Metafluor 6.3r7 software (Molecular Devices, Visitron Systems GmbH, Puchheim, Germany). Rmax was evaluated in all conditions (using a solution containing 4 μm ionomycin and 5 mm Ca2+), ruling out any possible nonlinearity between data obtained in myoblasts transfected with different plasmids or siRNA. No significant difference between the various Rmax was found. Confocal Monitoring of Membrane Potential—As described previously in Konig et al. (2Konig S. Hinard V. Arnaudeau S. Holzer N. Potter G. Bader C.R. Bernheim L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28187-28196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), confocal image acquisition of the fluorescent probe for membrane potential bis(1,3-dibarbituric acid)-trimethine oxonol (DiBAC4(3Konig S. Beguet A. Bader C.R. Bernheim L. Development. 2006; 133: 3107-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar); Molecular Probes) was performed using a spinning disc confocal microscope. The incident laser beam (488 nm) (Innova 70C spectrum, Coherent, Inc.) was injected into a Yokogawa spinning disc confocal scan head (QLC100, Visitech International) mounted on an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200 m). Fluorescence images (520-nm long-pass filter) were captured with a Cascade II 16-bit cooled EMCCD frame transfer camera (Photometrics-RopperScientific). Images were acquired using the Metafluor 6.3r7 software (Molecular Devices). Cells were plated on glass coverslips and continuously superfused with differentiation medium (DM). Calibration was made by adding gramicidin to isotonic DM containing 5.36 mm K+ and varying ratios of Na+ and N-methyl-d-glucamine to maintain [Na+] + [N-methyl-d-glucamine] = 136.3 mm. The membrane potential (Em) was then calculated as shown in Equation 1,Em = (RT/zF)(In(([Na+]o + [K+]o)/([Na+]i + [K+]i)))(Eq. 1) with [Na+]i + [K+]i assumed to be 150 mm, T = 310 K, Z is the number of elementary charges of the ion, and F is the Faraday constant. STIM1 Silencing Impairs Myoblast Differentiation and Ca2+ Handling—To test the role of SOCE in muscle differentiation, we manipulated the levels of the SOCE regulatory protein STIM1 in cultured myoblasts derived from human satellite cells. Myoblasts were incubated for 5 h with a siRNA designed against STIM1 (siSTIM1a) and 42 h later switched from a proliferation to a differentiation medium to induce their differentiation into multinucleated myotubes. As shown in Fig. 1A, incubation of myoblasts with siSTIM1a fully prevented the formation of nuclei clusters, a distinctive marker of cell fusion revealed with DAPI staining (top), as well as the appearance of the transcription factor MEF2, an early marker of myoblast differentiation (2Konig S. Hinard V. Arnaudeau S. Holzer N. Potter G. Bader C.R. Bernheim L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28187-28196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) detected by immunofluorescence (bottom). Quantification of the MEF2/DAPI ratio yielded an index of 7 ± 5% (n = 7) instead of the control-siMed index of 60 ± 18% (n = 7), indicating that myoblast differentiation was severely impaired by the genetic invalidation of STIM1. Similar results were obtained with myogenin, another marker of myoblast differentiation (control-siMed = 67 ± 9%, siSTIM1a = 8 ± 3%, n = 3; see Fig. 3, A and C). The amount of STIM1 protein measured by Western blot at the onset of differentiation was reduced by 80% in cells treated with siSTIM1a (Fig. 1B), confirming that STIM1 silencing was quite effective. STIM1 silencing did not impede cell growth or viability however, as cell proliferation measured 5 days after exposure to the siRNA was preserved (supplemental Fig. S1). These results indicate that adequate levels of STIM1 protein are required for the initiation of myoblast differentiation but not for their proliferation.FIGURE 3Orai1, Orai3, and STIM1 knockdown impact on differentiation. A, myoblasts were transfected with a siRNA against STIM1 (siSTIM1a), Orai1, Orai2, or Orai3, kept for 2 days in proliferation medium, and then kept for 2 more days in DM.

C, effects of siRNA against STIM1, Orai1, Orai2, and Orai3 on myogenin expression (n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because STIM1 is known to control the activation of SOCE, we then evaluated the impact of STIM1 silencing on cell Ca2+ handling using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Fura-2. As shown in Fig. 1C, STIM1 silencing altered three main components of the Ca2+ signaling machinery: the basal Ca2+ levels, the amount of Ca2+ released from intracellular stores by thapsigargin (Tg, 1 μm), and the amplitude of SOCE evoked by the depletion of stores, measured by re-adding 1.8 mm Ca2+ to Tg-treated cells. Basal Ca2+ levels were decreased from 0.39 to 0.37 by STIM1 silencing, whereas the peak of the Ca2+ release and Ca2+ influx responses were decreased by 18 ± 2 and 87 ± 4%, respectively (n = 4, Fig. 1D, p < 0.002 for all conditions). The effect of STIM1 knockdown on the amount of Ca2+ released from intracellular stores by thapsigargin was confirmed by using 1 μm ionomycin in low external Ca2+ (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). We also verified that re-addition of 1.8 mm Ca2+ does not on its own elicit any Ca2+ transients (supplemental Fig. S2C). Interestingly, reducing external Ca2+ to 250 nm decreased resting Ca2+ levels in control myoblasts but not in siSTIM1a-treated myoblasts (see the dotted lines in supplemental Fig. S2C), suggesting that STIM1 is involved in the regulation of basal Ca2+ entry in myoblasts. To test whether we could rescue the impaired differentiation of STIM1-silenced cells, we attempted to normalize the defective Ca2+ phenotype of these cells by growing them for 24-30 h in medium supplemented with 6 mm Ca2+. As shown in Fig. 1E, this procedure normalized the resting Ca2+ levels as well as the store content, but not SOCE, which remained inhibited by 73 ± 5% (n = 4). Despite the rescue of two of three visible Ca2+ defects, the differentiation of myoblasts remained severely impaired in Ca2+-rich medium, as assessed by MEF2 immunofluorescence, which suggests that SOCE was the critical factor required for differentiation. We then attempted to rescue the differentiation process at the genetic level by re-expressing STIM1 in myoblasts treated with siSTIM1 (Fig. 1F). For this, we designed a new siRNA against STIM1 (siSTIM1b) that targeted the 3′-untranslated non-coding region of the STIM1 mRNA. This siRNA was less efficient than the original siSTIM1a as cells transfected with siSTIM1b (at 1.5-fold the usual concentration of siSTIM1a) showed an inhibition of SOCE and of MEF2 expression of 52 ± 14 and 60 ± 15%, respectively, compared with 87 ± 4% and 90 ± 6% for STIM1a (n = 4, Fig. 1F, see also Fig. 4A for a correlation of SOCE and MEF2 staining; note that at higher doses siSTIM1b was as efficient as siSTIM1a in reducing resting Ca2+, Tg, and SOCE responses). Both SOCE and MEF2 expression could be fully rescued by co-transfecting cells with a plasmid coding for the open reading frame of the wild-type STIM1 protein, lacking the 3′-untranslated region and, thus, insensitive to siSTIM1b (Fig. 1F, black bars). These results confirm that STIM1 is required for myoblast differentiation and exclude that the inhibition of myogenesis observed in cells transfected with siSTIM1 was due to off-target or nonspecific effects of the siRNA. Orai1 and Orai3 (but Not Orai2) Silencing Inhibits Ca2+ Influx and Differentiation—To test whether known STIM1 partners were also involved in the control of myoblast differentiation, we designed siRNA against each of the three isoforms of the Orai family of SOCE channels, Orai1, Orai2, and Orai3. The effect of each siRNA on Ca2+ handling was assessed by Fura-2 imaging (Fig. 2, A-C), and the efficiency of each siRNA in s"

Using our thoroughly phenotyped cohort of subjects at an increased risk for type 2 diabetes, we assessed the association of common genetic variation within the MTNR1B locus with obesity and prediabetes traits, namely impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance. Methodology/Principal Findings We genotyped 1,578 non-diabetic subjects, metabolically characterized by oral glucose tolerance test, for five tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering 100% of common genetic variation (minor allele frequency >0.05) within the MTNR1B locus (rs10830962, rs4753426, rs12804291, rs10830963, rs3781638). In a subgroup (N = 513), insulin sensitivity was assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, and in a further subgroup (N = 301), glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was determined by intravenous glucose tolerance test. After appropriate adjustment for confounding variables and Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, none of the tagging SNPs was reliably associated with measures of adiposity. SNPs rs10830962, rs4753426, and rs10830963 were significantly associated with higher fasting plasma glucose concentrations (p<0.0001) and reduced OGTT- and IVGTT-induced insulin release (p≤0.0007 and p≤0.01, respectively). By contrast, SNP rs3781638 displayed significant association with lower fasting plasma glucose levels and increased OGTT-induced insulin release (p<0.0001 and p≤0.0002, respectively). Moreover, SNP rs3781638 revealed significant association with elevated fasting- and OGTT-derived insulin sensitivity (p≤0.0021). None of the MTNR1B tagging SNPs altered proinsulin-to-insulin conversion. Conclusions/Significance In conclusion, common genetic variation within MTNR1B determines glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and plasma glucose concentrations. Their impact on β-cell function might represent the prevailing pathomechanism how MTNR1B variants increase the type 2 diabetes risk."
https://openalex.org/W2065612545,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive motor neuron disease, in which activated microglia overexpressing ALS-linked SOD1 mutants (mSOD1) are known to contribute to neuronal death. However, it is unclear how mSOD1 expression affects micoglial activation and subsequently damages neurons. In this study, we created mSOD1-overexpressing BV-2 microglial cell lines. Following TLR2, but not TLR4 stimulation, we observed that overexpression of human SOD1 G93A, L8Q, or G10V mutant, as compared with the wild-type SOD1 or a mock control, significantly enhanced microglial secretion of a neurotoxic cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which was dependent on the NADPH-oxidase-mediated increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In further experiments, we demonstrated that mSOD1 expression regulated TNF-α secretion at a post-transcriptional level and involved ROS-sensitive TNF-α-converting enzymes, e.g. ADAM10 and -17, which shed TNF-α from its membrane-anchored precursor. Together with a recent report that the function of SOD1, as a self-regulating redox sensor in NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production, is lost due to its genetic mutations, we conclude that mSOD1 expression in ALS facilitates microglial neurotoxic inflammatory responses via TLR2, which is mediated by an uncontrolled ROS generation. The link, between mSOD1, innate immunity and NADPH oxidase, offers new opportunities in ALS therapies.

Transgenic mice overexpressing high levels of mutated human SOD1 (mSOD1) can model this disease (2Gurney M.E. Pu H. Chiu A.Y. Dal Canto M.C. Polchow C.Y. Alexander D.D. Caliendo J. Hentati A.

Microglial activation can also be visualized in patients by positron emission tomography using 11C-labeled (R)-PK11195, a radioligand of microglial peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (7Turner M.R.

This neuroinflammatory response coinciding with neuronal death and disease progression argues for a causal relationship. In mSOD1 transgenic mice, mSOD1 expression in microglial cells has been proven to be crucial for neuronal survival: 1) mSOD1-expressing neurons are protected from cell death by neighboring non-neuronal cells lacking mSOD1 expression (8Clement A.M. Nguyen M.D. Roberts E.A. Garcia M.L. Boillee S. Rule M. McMahon A.P. Doucette W. Siwek D. Ferrante R.J. Brown Jr., R.H. Julien J.P. Goldstein L.S. Cleveland D.W. Science.. 2003; 302: 113-117Google Scholar); 2) the disease progression in the late stage can be blocked by specifically switching off mSOD1 expression in microglia (9Boillée S. Yamanaka K. Lobsiger C.S. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Kassiotis G. Kollias G. Cleveland D.W. Science.. 2006; 312: 1389-1392Google Scholar); and 3) reconstruction of bone marrow of mSOD1 transgenic mice with wild-type (wt) SOD1-expressing precursor cells, which creates a pool of wtSOD1-expressing microglial cells, extends the life time of the mutant mice (10Beers D.R. Henkel J.S. Xiao Q. Zhao W. Wang J. Yen A.A. Siklos L. McKercher S.R. Appel S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2006; 103: 16021-16026Google Scholar). However, nonspecific ablation of proliferating microglia in the mSOD1 transgenic mice did not prevent motor neuronal death (11Gowing G. Philips T. Van Wijmeersch B. Audet J.N. Dewil M. Van Den Bosch L. Billiau A.D. Robberecht W. Julien J.P. J. Neurosci.. 2008; 28: 10234-10244Google Scholar). In a recent clinical trial, minocycline, a drug with wide spectrum of anti-inflammatory effects, also failed to be effective in ALS patients (12Gordon P.H. Moore D.H. Miller R.G. Florence J.M.

Western ALS S tudy Group Lancet Neurol.. 2007; 6: 1045-1053Google Scholar). Thus, detailed mechanisms of how mSOD1 expression affects microglial activation, and subsequently damages neurons in ALS, are far from being clear. Specific therapeutic targets against microglial detrimental effects in ALS need to be identified.Microglia, as resident innate immune effector cells of the central nervous system, are armed with an extensive repertoire of pattern recognition receptors including CD14 and toll-like receptors (TLRs) that are necessary for detection and rapid elimination of invading microorganisms (13Bsibsi M.

Upon ligand binding, the CD14/TLR signaling cascade via a common adaptor, MyD88, induces activation of AP-1 and NF-κB transcription factors, both of which subsequently regulate the expression of numerous immune response genes including inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (16Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol.. 2001; 2: 675-680Google Scholar). Recently, CD14 and TLRs have been recognized also to respond to endogenous ligands (16Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat.

Interestingly, mSOD1 protein was observed also to aggregate in ALS pathogenesis (28Banci L. Bertini I. Durazo A. Girotto S. Gralla E.B. Martinelli M. Valentine J.S. Vieru M. Whitelegge J.P. Proc.

Thus, after observing a marked up-regulation of TLR2 and CD14 in an ALS mouse model (32Letiembre M. Liu Y. Walter S. Hao W. Pfander T. Wrede A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Fassbender K. Neurobiol Aging.2007Google Scholar), we hypothesized that in ALS pathogenesis microglia could be activated by endogenous ligands via innate immune receptors, which modulate microglial effects on neuronal death.In this study, we investigate how mSOD1 expression affects innate immune receptor-initiated microglial inflammatory activation, and observed that mSOD1 expression enhances NADPH oxidase-dependent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and subsequently increases the secretion of TNF-α, which is related to TNF-α converting enzymes, e.g. a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) 10 and 17 (33Black R.A.

To silence the p47-PHOX, ADAM10, and ADAM17 gene expression, human wtSOD1 or mSOD1(G93A)-expressing and mock control cells were further transfected with pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFPmiR RNAi expression vectors targeting interested genes. All transfected cells were selected with G418 (Sigma), hygromycin B (Sigma), or with both G418 and blasticidin (Invitrogen) until the stable expression of investigated genes.Western Blot Analysis of SOD1 Expression in Cell Lines—Cultured cells were briefly washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed in 50 mm Hepes/0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.2) buffer containing 100 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma)/2.5% SDS. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and centrifuged at 14,100 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble materials. Clarified protein was then prepared in Laemmli buffer with 2-mercaptanol, boiled, and resolved using 12% SDS/PAGE gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted on nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman GmbH, Dassel, Germany). After membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, they were incubated with sheep anti-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn) human erythrocyte (1:5,000 dilution; EMD Biosciences, Darmstadt, Germany), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep IgG (1:10,000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Suffolk, UK). Blots were developed with the ECL Western blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany). Subsequently, membranes were re-blotted with mouse anti-actin (1:1000 dilution; Millipore GmbH, Schwalbach/Ts, Germany) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) to confirm equivalent protein loading.Cell Challenge and ELISA Detection of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β—Stably transfected BV-2 cells (overexpressing wt or mSOD1, or a mock control) were plated in 48-well plates at the density of 1 × 105/well. Cells were treated with Pam3Cys-SKKKK (TLR2 ligand, EMC, Tübingen, Germany), purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS, from Escherichia coli, Serotype R515(Re), TLR4 ligand, Alexis Biochemicals, Lörrach, Germany) and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C), TLR3 ligand, Alexis Biochemicals) at different concentrations as indicated in the results for 24 h. Supernatants were then collected for detection of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β by ELISA kits (all from R & D Systems, Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany). To analyze the effects of ROS on TNF-α release after TLR2 stimulation, part of the cells were co-treated with antioxidant reagents, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) at 2 or 5 mm, and 1000 units/ml catalase (both from Sigma). To analyze the role of p47-PHOX, ADAM10, and ADAM17 on cytokine secretion, cells co-transfected with different SOD1 expression vectors and interested gene-silencing vectors were used for different stimulations described above.Griess Assay for NO Detection—To evaluate NO release after cell challenges, stably transfected BV-2 cells were plated and treated using the same protocol for cytokine analysis as described in the last section. Modified Griess reagents (Sigma, working range: 0.43–65 μm nitrite) were used to measure the levels of nitrite ((NO2−)) in supernatants of the cultured cells.Reverse Transcription and Quantitative PCR for Analysis of Gene Transcripts—To measure transcripts of inflammatory genes (e.g. TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and iNOS), different SOD1-overexpressing BV-2 cells were plated and treated with 0.1 μg/ml Pam3Cys-SKKKK as described above. Total RNA was isolated by the RNEasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). First-strand cDNA was synthesized by priming total RNA with random primers (Invitrogen) and using M-MLV reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). For quantification, real-time (RT)-PCR was performed using the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast real-time PCR system (Foster City, CA) according to our established protocol (38Liu Y. Hao W. Letiembre M. Walter S. Kulanga M. Neumann H. Fassbender K. J. Neurosci.. 2006; 26: 12904-12913Google Scholar). To confirm successful gene knockdown, transcripts of silenced genes in cells transfected with different RNAi expression vectors were also measured by quantitative RT-PCR. The oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) used for PCR amplification are listed in Table 2.TABLE 2Sequences of oligonucleotides used for the real-time quantitative PCRGeneSenseAnti-senseP47-PHOX5′–GCCCAAAGATGGCAAGAATA–3′5′–TGTTCCCGAACTCTTCTCGT–3′ADAM105′–AAGGGATATGCAATGGCTTC–3′5′–TTGCCCATTAATGCACACTT–3′ADAM175′–CCAGCTGAGCATCAACACTT–3′5′–TGGACAAGAATGCTGAAAGG–3′TNF-α5′–ATGAGAAGTTCCCAAATGGC–3′5′–CTCCACTTGGTGGTTTGCTA–3′IL-65′–AGTCCGGAGAGGAGACTTCA–3′5′–ATTTCCACGATTTCCCAGAG–3′IL-1β5′–GAAGAAGAGCCCATCCTCTG–3′5′–TCATCTCGGAGCCTGTAGTG–3′iNOS5′–ACCTTGTTCAGCTACGCCTT–3′5′–CATTCCCAAATGTGCTTGTC–3′GAPDH5′–ACAACTTTGGCATTGTGGAA–3′5′–GATGCAGGGATGATGTTCTG–3′ Open table in a new tab The amount of double-stranded PCR product synthesized in each cycle was measured using SYBR green I dye. Threshold cycle (Ct) values for each test gene from the replicate PCRs was normalized to the Ct values for the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) control from the same cDNA preparations. The ratio of transcription of each gene was calculated as 2(ΔCt), where ΔCt is the difference Ct(test gene) - Ct(GAPDH).NF-κB-luciferase Reporter Assays—Different human SOD1-overexpressing cells were cultured in 24-well plates at the density of 1 × 105/well and transfected with 0.4 μg of luciferase NF-κB reporter construct (Stratagene), and 0.1 μg of pcDNA3.1/His/LacZ (Invitrogen) as an internal transfection control per well using 1.25 μl of Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with 0.1 μg/ml Pam3Cys-SKKKK or 10 ng/ml LPS as described above for another 24 h. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity was then assayed with Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay System and β-galactosidase Enzyme Assay System (both from Promega, Mannheim, Germany). Luciferase reporter activity was normalized for transfection efficiency with the galactosidase activity from the same sample.Assessment of H2O2 and Antioxidant Capacity—For assessment of H2O2, the cells were plated in 48-well plates as described above. After treatment with 0.1 μg/ml Pam3Cys-SKKKK or 10 ng/ml LPS for 24 h, the supernatants were collected and immediately detected with the Fluoro H2O2™ detection kit (Bachem, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. In this assessment, the non-fluorescent reagent 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine was oxidized by H2O2 in a 1:1 stoichiometry to produce a fluorescent product resorufin (excitation at 530–571 nm, emission at 590–600 nm) and measured by a fluorescence plate reader (Safire2™, TECAN, Männedorf, Switzerland).For assessment of antioxidant capacity, the cells were plated in 6-well plates at the density of 1 × 106/well and treated with 0.1 μg/ml Pam3Cys-SKKKK or 10 ng/ml LPS for 24 h. The concentration of thiol groups in cell lysates (lysis buffer: 10 mm Tris pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) was determined using a colorimetric assay using Ellman's reagent (10 mm dithio-bis 2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) + 10 mm cystamine, both from Sigma) as the substrate, and the color reaction was monitored at 412 nm (39Riener C.K. Kada G. Gruber H.J. Anal. Bioanal. Chem.. 2002; 373: 266-276Google Scholar).Statistics—Data in figures are presented as mean ± S.E. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's HSD or Tamhane's T2 post-hoc test (dependent on the result of Levene's test to determine the equality of variances) was used for multiple comparisons. Two-independent-samples t test was used to compare means for two groups of cases. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 15.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.RESULTSGeneration of Microglial Cells That Overexpress Human SOD1—To investigate the effects of ALS-linked mSOD1 on microglial inflammatory activities, we transfected BV-2 cells with the wild type (wt) and G93A, L8Q, or G10V mutated (m) human SOD1 genes, and with a mock control as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” To verify the expression of human SOD1 in the different transfected cells, cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 1, human SOD1 protein expression was markedly increased in wtSOD1 and mSOD1(G93A)-transgenic cells as compared with the mock control.SOD1 G93A Mutation Enhances TLR2 Stimulation-induced Microglial TNF-α Secretion—Because we recently reported that TLR2 and CD14 are two highly up-regulated innate immune receptors in the spinal cord of an ALS mouse model (32Letiembre M. Liu Y. Walter S. Hao W. Pfander T. Wrede A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Fassbender K. Neurobiol Aging.2007Google Scholar), we first asked whether mSOD1 affects microglial activation via these two receptors. We stimulated wtSOD1 and mSOD1(G93A)-overexpressing and the mock control BV-2 cells with Pam3Cys-SKKKK (TLR2 ligand) and LPS (CD14/TLR4 ligand), as well as with poly(I:C) (TLR3 ligand) as a stimulating control. The cells were strongly activated by these stimuli as analyzed by measuring the cytokine secretion (Fig. 2). Interestingly, we observed that after Pam3Cys-SKKKK stimulation at lower concentrations (0.1 or 1 μg/ml), mSOD1(G93A)-overexpressing cells released significantly more TNF-α than wtSOD1-overexpressing or mock control cells (Fig. 2A, p < 0.05). This difference in cytokine release between different cell types became smaller when TLR2 ligand concentration was increased (10 μg/ml). Surprisingly, IL-6 secretion was markedly reduced in mSOD1(G93A)-overexpressing cells as compared with wtSOD1-expressing cells, especially upon stimulation of Pam3Cys-SKKKK at higher concentrations (1 and 10 μg/ml) (Fig. 2B, p < 0.05). Following LPS stimulation, there was no significant difference in TNF-α secretion between mSOD1(G93A)-overexpressing and other two cell types (Fig. 2C). Upon stimulation of TLR3 with poly(I:C), mSOD1(G93A)-overexpressing cells responded with a significantly higher TNF-α secretion than mock control, but not wtSOD1-expressing cells (Fig. 2E, p < 0.05). The increase in IL-6 secretion following TLR4 stimulation using LPS was significantly reduced in mSOD1(G93A)-expressing cells as compared with the wtSOD1-overexpressing, but not mock control cells (Fig. 2D, p < 0.05). No elevated IL-6 release was detected following TLR3 stimulation (Fig. 2F). IL-1β and NO secretion were also measured in this study. Upon TLR2 stimulation with Pam3Cys-SKKKK at 0.1 μg/ml, mSOD1(G93A)-overexpressing cells tended to increase NO release, although not reaching statistical significance (Fig. 2G, p > 0.05). The secretion of IL-1β from all studied cell lines was not significantly increased by the TLR2 stimulation (data not shown).FIGURE 2Expression of mSOD1 increased TNF-α secretion upon TLR2 stimulation. Wt and mutated (G93A, L8Q, or G10V) SOD1-overexpressing and mock control cells were treated with Pam3Cys-SKKKK, LPS, and poly(I:C) at different concentrations as indicated in the figure for 24 h. Supernatant was then collected for ELISA analysis of TNF-α and IL-6, or for NO detection. Cytokine secretion or NO release was significantly increased in each cell line upon different stimuli (A–E, G–H, p < 0.05), except that IL-6 secretion was not activated by poly(I:C) (F). ANOVA with post-hoc test: a, versus wtSOD1 transgene; b, versus the mock control, p < 0.05, n ≥ 6 per each group. The scale for concentrations of Pam3Cys-SKKKK and LPS in the x-axes is logarithmically transformed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm the effects of mSOD1(G93A) expression on microglial activation, we further created new cell lines overexpressing human mSOD1 (L8Q or G10V) and wtSOD1. As shown in Fig. 2H, after TLR2 stimulation, mSOD1 (L8Q or G10V)-overexpressing cells secreted significantly more TNF-α than wtSOD1-overexpressing or mock control cells (p < 0.05), but did not enhance the IL-6 secretion (data not shown).SOD1 G93A Mutation Does Not Enhance Transcription of TNF-α—After we observed that mSOD1-overexpression enhances TLR2-induced microglial secretion of TNF-α but reduces IL-6 release, we aimed to clarify the mechanism of how mSOD1 modulates TNF-α and IL-6 production. We measured gene transcripts of the inflammatory molecules (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and iNOS) by quantitative PCR. As shown in Fig. 3, A–D, the transcription of all studied inflammatory genes was significantly increased by TLR2 stimulation in the different cell lines (p < 0.05). When comparing the gene transcriptional levels between different cell types, we observed that mSOD1(G93A) overexpression, compared with mock or wtSOD1 controls, reduced transcription of TNF-α and IL-1β while increasing transcription of IL-6 and iNOS, though all mSOD1(G93A)-induced transcriptional changes of inflammatory genes did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 3, A–D, p > 0.05). Furthermore, we observed that mSOD1(G93A) overexpression significantly increased the basal level activity of NF-κB signaling compared with the other two controls (Fig. 3E, p < 0.05). However, following Pam3Cys-SKKKK and LPS stimulations, the difference in NF-κB activation among the different cell types was reduced. Thus, the regulation of mSOD1(G93A) on TNF-α and IL-6 production might occur at a post-transcriptional level.FIGURE 3Expression of"

Here we show that a conserved PXXP motif (Kannan, N., Haste, N., Taylor, S. S., and Neuwald, A. F. (2007) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 104, 1272–1277), in the C-terminal tail of AGC (c-AMP-dependent protein kinase/protein kinase G/protein kinase C) kinases, controls the processing phosphorylation of conventional and novel PKC isozymes, a required step in the maturation of the enzyme into a signaling-competent species. Mutation of both Pro-616 and Pro-619 to Ala in the conventional PKC βII abolishes the phosphorylation and activity of the kinase. Co-immunoprecipitation studies reveal that conventional and novel, but not atypical, PKC isozymes bind the chaperones Hsp90 and Cdc37 through a PXXP-dependent mechanism. Inhibitors of Hsp90 and Cdc37 significantly reduce the rate of processing phosphorylation of PKC. Of the two C-terminal sites processed by phosphorylation, the hydrophobic motif, but not the turn motif, is regulated by Hsp90. Overlay of purified Hsp90 onto a peptide array containing peptides covering the catalytic domain of PKC βII identified regions surrounding the PXXP segment, but not the PXXP motif itself, as major binding determinants for Hsp90. These Hsp90-binding regions, however, are tethered to the C-terminal tail via a “molecular clamp” formed between the PXXP motif and a conserved Tyr (Tyr-446) in the αE-helix. Disruption of the clamp by mutation of the Tyr to Ala recapitulates the phosphorylation defect of mutating the PXXP motif. These data are consistent with a model in which a molecular clamp created by the PXXP motif in the C-terminal tail and determinants in the αE-helix of the catalytic domain allows the chaperones Hsp90 and Cdc37 to bind newly synthesized PKC, a required event in the processing of PKC by phosphorylation.

Protein kinases, which comprise ∼2% of the human genome, are key signal transducers that regulate a wide variety of cellular processes, such as growth, proliferation, and metabolism, through catalysis of specific phosphorylation events (1Manning G.

Hsp90 is recruited to its kinase clients through interactions with cochaperones, such as Cdc37, which bridge the interaction between Hsp90 and the kinase client (16Pearl L.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 17Karnitz L.M. Felts S.J. Science's STKE. 2007; 2007: pe22Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); this mechanism is revealed in a structural analysis of the Cdc37-Cdk4-Hsp90 complex (18Vaughan C.K. Gohlke U. Sobott F.

Cdc37, originally identified in yeast (19Reed S.I. Genetics. 1980; 95: 561-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is a cochaperone specific to the kinome that not only assists Hsp90 function but can also recognize and stabilize clients independently of Hsp90 (20MacLean M. Picard D. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). By binding specific regions of the catalytic domains of these kinases, the Hsp90-Cdc37 complex utilizes ATP to promote and stabilize functional conformations of its clients (8Caplan A.J. Mandal A.K.

Pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 by ansamycin antibiotics such as 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) leads to the destabilization and subsequent proteasomal degradation of its clients (6Whitesell L.

Recent studies have identified Hsp90 as a promising therapeutic target in cancer as levels of chaperones and activity of client kinases are frequently up-regulated (23Gray Jr., P.J.

The protein kinase C (PKC) family of Ser/Thr kinases serves as a paradigm of how conformation and processing by phosphorylation regulate activity, localization, and inter- and intramolecular interactions (26Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The mammalian PKC family consists of 10 isozymes divided into three subclasses (conventional, novel, and atypical) based on their primary structure and second messenger mode of regulation. In the case of conventional PKC isozymes, newly synthesized enzyme is loosely engaged on the membrane in a conformation that exposes the activation loop for phosphorylation by the upstream kinase, PDK-1 (28Gao T. Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19588-19596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation triggers two sequential phosphorylations on the C terminus, one on the turn motif and one on the hydrophobic motif. Phosphorylation of the turn motif is required for phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif and has recently been shown to depend on the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), a complex consisting of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), Rictor, Sin1, and mLST8 (29Facchinetti V. Ouyang W. Wei H. Soto N. Lazorchak A. Gould C. Lowry C. Newton A.C. Mao Y. Miao R.Q. Sessa W.C. Qin J. Zhang P. Su B. Jacinto E. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1932-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 30Ikenoue T. Inoki K. Yang Q. Zhou X. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1919-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Turn motif phosphorylation is rapidly followed by phosphorylation at the hydrophobic motif, a reaction that occurs by an intramolecular mechanism in vitro (31Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Fully stey phosphorylated PKC is released into the cytosol in a closed conformation in which an autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate sequence occupies the substrate-binding cavity. Upon generation of the lipid second messenger diacylglycerol and elevation of intracellular Ca2+, conventional PKC isozymes (α, βI, βII, γ) translocate to membranes via their membrane-targeting C1 and C2 domains, where they adopt an open conformation in which the pseudosubstrate is expelled from the substrate-binding cavity, permitting phosphorylation of downstream substrates (32Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Novel PKC isozymes (δ, ∊, θ, and η) only respond to diacylglycerol, and their processing phosphorylations can occur through additional mechanisms (33Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Le Good J.A. Whelan R.D. Kelly J.J. Frech M. Hemmings B.A. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 522-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 34Freeley M. Volkov Y. Kelleher D. Long A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 334: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Atypical PKC isozymes (ζ and ι/λ) do not respond to either Ca2+ or diacylglycerol but can also undergo regulation of their processing phosphorylations by external stimuli (35Standaert M.L. Bandyopadhyay G. Kanoh Y. Sajan M.P. Farese R.V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In fact, atypical PKC isozymes contain a Glu at their hydrophobic motif site. Thus, although these three sites are conserved among PKC family members, additional layers of regulation generate specificity in how these kinases become signaling-competent enzymes. The mechanisms of regulation of the activity and signaling properties of PKC by lipid second messengers and phosphorylation have been well characterized; however, mounting evidence suggests that there are many other regulatory inputs for PKC function. Recent analysis of the evolutionary constraints acting on AGC kinase sequences have underscored the importance of the C-terminal tail as a critical regulatory module (36Kannan N. Haste N. Taylor S.S. Neuwald A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 1272-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Deletion mutants of the C-terminal tail have been shown to abrogate PKC activity (37Yeong S.S. Zhu Y. Smith D. Verma C. Lim W.G. Tan B.J. Li Q.T. Cheung N.S. Cai M. Zhu Y.Z. Zhou S.F. Tan S.L. Duan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30768-30781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition to containing the key regulatory phosphorylation sites and docking the upstream kinase PDK-1, the C-terminal tail contains key conserved motifs, found within all AGC kinases, that facilitate ATP binding, promote substrate binding, and structure the catalytic core (36Kannan N. Haste N. Taylor S.S. Neuwald A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 1272-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). One such motif comprises the segment PXXP; this motif makes key contacts with the catalytic core, where it is important for modulating movement of the catalytic domain (36Kannan N. Haste N. Taylor S.S. Neuwald A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 1272-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Although this PXXP motif is conserved in all the PKC isozymes, its functional role is unknown. In this study, we address the role of the conserved Pro residues in the PXXP motif of the C-terminal tail of PKC βII. We show that mutation of these two Pro to Ala (P616A and P619A) results in a kinase that is not processed by phosphorylation in cells and is thus inactive. Further analysis reveals that this mutant is not able to bind the chaperones Hsp90 and Cdc37, an event that is required for the processing of PKC by phosphorylation. Our peptide array data indicate that Hsp90 binds to regions of the catalytic core such as the αC-β4 loop and the αD-helix that serve as hinge points for C-helix movement (36Kannan N. Haste N. Taylor S.S. Neuwald A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 1272-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Structural analysis delineates that these hinge points are tethered to the C-terminal tail through a molecular clamp formed between the PXXP segment and AGC conserved residues in the αE-helix. Mutation of one of the “clamping” residues, a conserved Tyr (Tyr-446), recapitulates the defect resulting from mutation of the PXXP motif. Our data support a model in which the PXXP motif participates in an intramolecular clamp with determinants in the αE helix of the kinase core, by providing a recognition surface for Hsp90 to bind and facilitate the maturation of PKC, a required step in the processing of the enzyme.

Optical filters were obtained from Chromas Technologies and Semrock, Inc. Cells were treated with 200 nm PDBu, and the same cells were used to acquire YFP and RFP images through a 10% neutral density filter. YFP images were obtained using a 495/10-nm excitation filter, a 505-nm dichroic mirror, and a 535/25-nm emission filter. RFP images were obtained using a 560/25-nm excitation filter, a 593-nm dichroic mirror, and a 629/53-nm emission filter. Kinase Assays—For the PKC activity assay, detergent-solubilized lysates (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) from untransfected tsA201 cells and tsA201 cells transfected with empty vector, WT PKC βII, or PKC βII-P616A/P619A were assayed for PKC activity for 8 min by monitoring 32P incorporation from [γ-32P]ATP into a synthetic PKC-selective peptide (Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2) using a paper assay as described previously (38Edwards A.S. Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6461-6468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mix contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, 50 μm peptide substrate, and 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Non-activating conditions included 2 mm EGTA. Activating conditions included 140 μm phosphatidylserine, 3.8 μm diacylglycerol membranes, and 500 μm CaCl2. The activity of the transfected kinase was determined by first subtracting 32P incorporation in control (vector-transfected) lysate samples and then normalizing the Ca2+/lipid-stimulated peptide phosphorylation to PKC expression (determined by Western blot analysis); activity is expressed in relative units. For the PDK-1 activity assay, COS7 cells expressing empty vector, WT PKC βII, or PKC βII-P616A/P619A were lysed in Buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% TritonX-100, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and detergent-solubilized lysates were incubated with a monoclonal anti-PKC α antibody (cross-reactive with PKC β) overnight at 4 °C to allow immune complex formation. The immune complexes were collected with Ultra-Link protein A/G beads. After washing the immune complexes with Buffer A, they were resuspended in the kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm dithiothreitol). The standard reaction mix contained the immune complexes, 20 mm HEPES, 500 μm ATP, and 2 mm MgCl2. The reaction was performed in the absence or presence of purified His-PDK-1 (0.5 nm) and in non-activating or activating PKC conditions. Non-activating conditions included 2 mm EGTA. Activating conditions included 140 μm phosphatidylserine, 3.8 μm diacylglycerol membranes, and 500 μm CaCl2. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C and stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and analyzed for pThr-500 phosphorylation by Western blotting. PMA Time Course—COS7 cells were transiently transfected with WT PKC βII or PKC βII-P616A/P619A. Approximately 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with 200 nm PMA for 0, 15, 30, and 90 min. The cells were lysed in Buffer A, and whole cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Pulse-Chase Analysis—COS7 cells were transfected with WT PKC βII, PKC βII-P616A/P619A, PKC βII T641E, or PKC βII S660E. At 24–30 h after transfection, cells were incubated with Met/Cys-deficient DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then pulse-labeled with 0.5 mCi ml–1 [35S]Met/Cys in Met/Cys-deficient DMEM for 7 min at 37 °C, media were removed, and cells were chased with DMEM containing 5 mm unlabeled methionine and 5 mm unlabeled cysteine (44Sonnenburg E.D. Gao T. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45289-45297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). At the indicated times, cells were lysed in Buffer A and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 22 °C, and PKC βII in the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with an anti-PKC α monoclonal antibody (cross-reactive with PKC βII) overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were collected with Ultra-Link protein A/G beads, washed with Buffer A, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and analyzed by autoradiography. For the inhibitor experiments, cells were pretreated for 3 h with 1 μm 17-AAG, 30 min with 10 μm celastrol, or both prior to the pulse-chase. Pulse-chase experiments of endogenous PKC α followed the same protocol as described above. Densitometric analysis of scanned autoradiograms was performed using NIH Image J analysis software, and the kinetic analysis was performed using Kaleidograph software (version 4.0). Immunoprecipitation—To examine the interaction of PKC with endogenous Hsp90, COS7 cells were transfected with either WT PKC (α, βII, δ, ζ) or the respective construct with a mutated PXXP motif. For PKC βII, the interaction of Hsp90 with the kinase-dead mutant PKC βII-K371R and PKC βII-Y446A was also assessed. Approximately 24 h after transfection, the cell"

https://openalex.org/W2030419210,"Alzheimer's (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that afflicts a significant fraction of older individuals. Although a proteolytic product of the Amyloid precursor protein, the Αβ42 polypeptide, has been directly implicated in the disease, the genes and biological pathways that are deployed during the process of Αβ42 induced neurodegeneration are not well understood and remain controversial. To identify genes and pathways that mediated Αβ42 induced neurodegeneration we took advantage of a Drosophila model for AD disease in which ectopically expressed human Αβ42 polypeptide induces cell death and tissue degeneration in the compound eye. One of the genes identified in our genetic screen is Toll (Tl). It encodes the receptor for the highly conserved Tl→NFkB innate immunity/inflammatory pathway and is a fly homolog of the mammalian Interleukin-1 (Ilk-1) receptor. We found that Tl loss-of-function mutations dominantly suppress the neuropathological effects of the Αβ42 polypeptide while gain-of-function mutations that increase receptor activity dominantly enhance them. Furthermore, we present evidence demonstrating that Tl and key downstream components of the innate immunity/inflammatory pathway play a central role in mediating the neuropathological activities of Αβ42. We show that the deleterious effects of Αβ42 can be suppressed by genetic manipulations of the Tl→NFkB pathway that downregulate signal transduction. Conversely, manipulations that upregulate signal transduction exacerbate the deleterious effects of Aβ42. Since postmortem studies have shown that the Ilk-1→NFkB innate immunity pathway is substantially upregulated in the brains of AD patients, the demonstration that the Tl→NFkB signaling actively promotes the process of Αβ42 induced cell death and tissue degeneration in flies points to possible therapeutic targets and strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2084724759,"Serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) is a downstream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling, and it regulates various cellular and physiological functions, but the SGK1 substrate proteins and genes regulated by SGK1 are less known. Here we have identified IκB kinase α (IKKα) as a novel substrate of SGK1 by using biochemical and bioinformatic approaches. SGK1 directly phosphorylates IKKα at Thr-23 and indirectly activates IKKα at Ser-180. Furthermore, SGK1 enhanced nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activity and up-regulated N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor NR2A and NR2B expression through activation of IKKα at Thr-23 and Ser-180, and these two residues play an equally important role in mediating these effects of SGK1. Although SGK1 does not phosphorylate IKKβ, IKKβ activity is still required for IKK complex activation and for SGK1 phosphorylation and activation of NF-κB. In addition, SGK1 increased the acetylation of NF-κB through phosphorylation of p300 at Ser-1834, and this also leads to NF-κB activation and NR2A and NR2B expression. Moreover, an endogenous stimulus of SGK1, insulin, increased IKKα and NF-κB phosphorylation as well as NF-κB acetylation and NF-κB activity, but SGK1 small interfering RNA transfection blocked these effects of insulin. In examination of the functional significance of the SGK1-IKKα-NF-κB signaling pathway, we found that transfection of the IKKα double mutant (IKKαT23A/S180A) to rat hippocampus antagonized SGK-1-mediated spatial memory facilitation.

Goya L. Ge Y. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). SGK1 is known to regulate a variety of cellular functions, including salt homeostasis, ion channel conductance, cell proliferation, and neuronal excitability (2Lang F. Bohmer C. Palmada M. Seebohm G. Strutz-Seebohm N. Vallon V. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 1151-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). In addition, SGK1 promotes cell survival and regulates cell cycle progression through phosphorylation of the forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1 (3Brunet A. Park J. Tran H. Hu L.S. Hemmings B.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 952-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 4Leong M.L. Maiyar A.C. Kim B. O'Keeffe B.A. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5871-5882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). More recently, SGK1 was found to modulate the excitatory amino acid transporter function through phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 (5Rajamanickam J. Palmada M. Lang F. Boehmer C. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 858-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). SGK1 is also known to implicate several physiological functions. For example, sgk1 mRNA expression is increased in animal models of Parkinson disease, suggesting a role of SGK1 in neuroprotection (6Schoenebeck B. Bader V. Zhu X.R. Schmitz B. Lubbert H. Stichel C.C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2005; 30: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). SGK1 increases glutamate-induced current partly by increasing GluR6 protein level in plasma membrane of Xenopus oocytes expressing rat GluR6 (7Strutz-Seebohm N. Seebohm G. Shumilina E. Mack A.F.

SGK1 was also found to increase neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons (8Yang Y.C. Lin C.H. Lee E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8357-8370Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Ma Y.L. Tsai M.C. Hsu W.L. Lee E.H. Learn. Mem. (Cold Spring Harbor). 2006; 13: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Moreover, SGK1 facilitates long term potentiation and spatial learning in rats (10Tsai K.J. Chen S.K. Ma Y.L. Hsu W.L. Lee E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3990-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). SGK1 is a downstream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling (11Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). SGK1 is first phosphorylated at Ser-422 by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent PDK2, which enables SGK1 to be further phosphorylated at Thr-256 by PDK1 (12Kobayashi T. Deak M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In addition, SGK1 also receives upstream signals from cyclic AMP (13Perrotti N. He R.A. Phillips S.A. Haft C.R. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9406-9412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) (14Lee C.T. Tyan S.W.

However, with the biological functions and upstream signals of SGK1 characterized to a certain extent, the downstream targets of SGK1 are relatively less known. Because SGK1 phosphorylates substrate proteins that contain the RXRXX(S/T) motif, where X stands for any amino acid (12Kobayashi T. Deak M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), in this study we investigated the SGK1 substrate and signaling pathway by using the phospho (p)-motif antibody as a tool. We also examined the expression of genes that are regulated by this signaling pathway. Our results revealed that IκB kinase α (IKKα), but not IKKβ, is a novel substrate of SGK1 and that SGK1 phosphorylation of IKKα increases nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activity and up-regulates the expression of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit NR2A and NR2B. In addition, SGK1 also phosphorylates p300 directly, and SGK1 phosphorylation of p300 increases NF-κB activity and NR2A and NR2B expression through enhanced acetylation of NF-κB. These results suggest that SGK1 phosphorylation of IKKα and p300 regulates neuronal plasticity. Cell Culture Preparation, DNA Transfection, and Plasmid Construction—HEK293T were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% equine serum and 5% fetal calf serum and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Transfection was made by using the Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) in 12-well culture plates according to the manufacturer's instructions. For NF-κB reporter assay, PC12 cells were maintained in the medium for 24 h after transfection and then maintained in serum-free medium for 18 h. After serum starvation, PC12 cells were changed to normal culture medium for 6 h with serum stimulation. Cell lysate was then collected by using passive lysis buffer (Promega, WI) and was ready for the luciferase assay. The sgk gene has different isoforms, and this study we have examined SGK1. For construction of the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged DNA plasmid (HA-SGK), full-length SGK1 was cloned by amplifying the rat hippocampal SGK1 cDNA with primers 5′-CGGAATTCACCGTCAAAACCGAGGCTCG-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGATCAGAGGAAGGAGTCCATAGG-3′. The PCR product was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3-HA. For the SGK1 deletion construct, ΔN-SGKS422D, the N-terminal 1–59 amino acids of SGK1 were deleted to reduce its degradation and increase its constitutive activity. For construction of the FLAG-tagged DNA plasmid (FLAG-IKKα, FLAG-IκBα, FLAG-p300, and FLAG-p65), full-length IKKα was cloned by amplifying the rat hippocampal IKKα cDNA with primers 5′-GCTCCCGCCCCATGGAGCG-3′ and 5′-TCGAGTCATTCTGCTAACCAAC-3′. The full-length p300 cDNA clone was purchased from Addgene (Cambridge, MA) and was subcloned by amplifying with primers 5′-ATCAAGCTTATGGCCGAGAATGTGGTGG-3′ and 5′-GGGGAGCTCGCTAGCAAGCTGAGAAAGC-3′. The full-length IκBα was cloned by amplifying the rat hippocampal IκBα cDNA with primers 5′-ATCAAGCTTAATGTTTCAGCCAGCTGGGC-3′ and 5′-CGACCTCGAGTTATAACGTCAGACGCTGG-3′. The full-length p65 was cloned by amplifying the rat hippocampal p65 cDNA with primers 5′-GGCGGATCCCATGGACCCCGAGAAC-3′ and 5′-ATCGAATTCTCAGGTCTGGGGACT-3′. The PCR product of IKKα, IκBα, p300, and p65 was then subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMVTag2A (Stratagene). For construction of the V5-tagged DNA plasmid (V5-IKKβ), full-length IKKβ was cloned by amplifying the rat hippocampal IKKβ cDNA with primers 5′-ATTTGCGGCCGCCACCATGAGCTGGTCACCTTCTCTC-3′ and 5′-TAATCTAGACTGTCACAGGCCTGCTCCAG-3′. The PCR product of IKKβ was then subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen). SGK1 mutant constructs (SGKS422D, constitutively active mutant; SGKK127M, kinase-dead mutant), IKKα mutant constructs (IKKαT23A, phosphorylation site mutant; IKKαS180A, phosphorylation site mutant; IKKαT23A/S180A, IKKαK44M, kinase-dead mutant), IKKβ mutant constructs (IKKβS181A, phosphorylation site mutant; IKKβK44M, kinase-dead mutant), p300 phosphorylation site mutant construct (p300S1834A), p65 acetylation site mutant construct (p65K221R), and IκBα nondegradable mutant construct (IκBαS32A/S36A) were generated by using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). In some experiments, combined treatment of insulin (100 ng/ml) (Sigma) and SGK1 siRNA (20 pmol) or Akt siRNA (20 pmol) in HEK293T cells was carried out. Silencer Negative Control number 1 siRNA (Ambion, TX) was used as a control. Human SGK1 siRNA was purchased from Invitrogen and was transfected by using the Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent. In another experiment, combined treatment of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (PeproTech, NJ) and SGK1 siRNA was carried out for NF-κB acetylation assay. Whole-cell Lysate and Hippocampal Lysate Preparation—Animals were killed by decapitation, and their hippocampal tissue was dissected out. Rat hippocampal tissue was lysed by brief sonication in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 20 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4. The HEK293T cell lysate was prepared in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml PMSF, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, and 4 μg/ml pepstatin. Immunoprecipitation (IP) and Western Blot Analysis—For IP reaction, the specific primary antibodies were unconjugated to agarose beads, and rabbit or mouse IgG was used in the control group. For IP assay of SGK1 and IKKα, the clarified hippocampal lysate (1 mg) was immunoprecipitated with 4 μl of anti-phospho-Thr-256-SGK1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or anti-IKKα antibody (M-280, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 2 h. For IP assay of SGK1 and p300, the clarified hippocampal lysate (1 mg) was immunoprecipitated with 4 μl of anti-phospho-Thr-256-SGK1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or anti-p300 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) at 4 °C overnight. The protein G-agarose beads (100 μl, 50% slurry; GE Healthcare) were added to the IP reaction product to catch the immune complexes at 4 °C for 2 h. The immune complexes on beads were then washed three times with washing buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml PMSF, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, and 4 μg/ml pepstatin and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. The immunoprecipitated products were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE followed by transferring onto the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore). The membranes were immunoblotted with anti-phospho-Thr-256 SGK1 antibody, anti-IKKα antibody, and anti-p300 antibody, respectively. For IP-Western blot assay of acetylated p65, HEK293T cells were treated with trichostatin A (400 nm; Calbiochem), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, for 30 min and then added with fresh medium as a stimulation for 1 h before protein extraction for IP of p65. For anti-p65, anti-FLAG, and anti-HA IP assay, 500 μg of lysate from cell lines or hippocampal tissue was incubated with 10 μl of anti-p65 antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 10 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (50% slurry) (Sigma), or anti-HA agarose affinity gel (50% slurry) (Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h, respectively. The immune complexes of p65 were precipitated by using the protein G-agarose beads (50 μl, 50% slurry; GE Healthcare) at 4 °C for 2 h. Antibodies used in this study included Akt-pSub (Cell Signaling), pSGK1 Thr-256, IKKα, IKKβ (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), pIKKα/β Thr-23 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), pIKKα/β Ser-180/181 (Cell Signaling), p65 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), acetylated lysine (Cell Signaling), NR1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), NR2A (Chemicon), NR2B (Chemicon), V5 (Serotec), FLAG M2 (Sigma), and β-actin (Chemicon) antibodies. After washing, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Chemicon) and were exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) or LAS-3000 imaging system (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) for visualization of protein bands by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL PLUS, GE Healthcare). The protein bands were quantified by using the NIH Image J software. Luciferase Reporter Assay—Luciferase assay was performed in PC12 cells transfected with SGKS422D, IKKα constructs, IKKβ constructs, p300 constructs, pNF-κB-Luc (Stratagene), phRG-TK (Promega), NR2A promoter construct, NR2B promoter construct, and pGL4.10 (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocols (Promega). The relative activity was normalized by Renilla luciferase activity. GST and His6 Fusion Protein Purification-GST-IκBα-(1–54)—For construction of the GST-p300 (1714–1883) plasmid, the p300 fragment (p300 (1714–1883) containing residue 1829–1835 of the p300 protein) was subcloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (pGEX-p300). The mutant p300 plasmid (pGEX-p300S1834A) was generated by using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The GST-IκBα-(1–54) plasmid containing residues 1–54 of the IκBα protein was a gift from Dr. Shu Chien. For construction of the His-IKKα, His-IKKαT23A, and His-IKKαS180A plasmids, full-length IKKα was subcloned into the pRSET-A vector (pRSET-IKKα). The mutant IKKα plasmids (pRSET-IKKαT23A and pRSET-IKKαS180A) were generated by using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Bacteria culture (200 ml) of Rosetta-gami 2(DE3)pLysS (Novagen, WI) transformed with any of these expression plasmids was grown until A600 0.2–0.3 before isopropyl d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to reach a final concentration of 1 mm. After further growth for 2 h at 37 °C, cells were resuspended in Bugbuster protein extraction reagent (Novagen) for protein extraction according to the instruction manual. GST fusion proteins were precipitated with 0.5 ml of 80% glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitors. Various His fusion proteins were purified by using the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid His-Bind resin (Novagen). The eluted fusion proteins were further dialyzed in 1 liter of dialysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.2 mm PMSF. In Vitro Kinase Assay and Coupling Kinase Assay—To identify the substrate proteins phosphorylated by SGK1 in rat hippocampus, hippocampal tissue lysate (10 μg) was added with different amounts of activated SGK1 protein for kinase reaction. The kinase reaction was carried out in 20 μl of reaction buffer added with 1 mm DTT, 100 nm ATP, and 20–100 ng of activated SGK1 protein (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 10 min at 30 °C. Reaction was stopped by boiling in Laemmli buffer. Proteins were separated by 6–10% gradient SDS-PAGE and transferred to the PVDF membrane. Proteins were further characterized by immunoblot analysis with Akt-pSub antibody (Cell Signaling). To obtain the FLAG-IKKα fusion protein for in vitro kinase assay, HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-IKKαWT or FLAG-IKKαT23A plasmid. Twenty four hours after transfection, cell lysates prepared from cells grown in full medium or in full medium treated with 50 μm LY294002 for 2 h were incubated with FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) at 4 °C for overnight. The immune complexes on beads were then washed three times in washing buffer and twice in reaction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm EGTA. Kinase reaction was carried out in 20 μl of reaction buffer added with 1 mm DTT, 100 nm ATP, and 60 ng of activated SGK1 protein (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by boiling in Laemmli buffer followed by Western blot analysis with pIKKα/β Thr-23 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) as described above. For His-IKKα, GST-IKKβ-(1–257) (Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan), and GST-p300 in vitro kinase assay, kinase reaction was carried out in 20 μl of reaction buffer added with 500 ng of purified recombinant protein, 1 mm DTT, 6 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and 60 ng of activated SGK1 protein (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 30 min at 30 °C. For the coupling kinase assay, the FLAG-IKKα IP product prepared from HEK293T cells was incubated with 60 ng of activated SGK1 protein (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and 6 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) for 30 min at 30 °C as described above. After the first kinase reaction, the FLAG-IKKα IP product was washed twice in reaction buffer and was then incubated with 0.5 μg of GST-IκBα-(1–54) protein and 6 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) for 30 min at 30 °C. Reaction was stopped by boiling in Laemmli buffer, and proteins were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE followed by transferring onto the PVDF membrane. The membrane was exposed to x-ray film (Kodak) for visualization of protein bands. Gene Transfection and Drug Injection to the Brain—Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–400 g) bred at the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, were used. Experimental procedures followed the Guidelines of Animal Use and Care of the National Institute of Health and were approved by the Animal Committee of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica. Animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital (40 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and subjected to stereotaxic surgery. Two 23-gauge, stainless steel, thin wall cannulae were implanted bilaterally to the hippocampal CA1 area at the following coordinates: 3.5 mm posterior to the bregma, 2.5 mm lateral to the midline, and 3.4 mm ventral to the skull surface. After animals recovered from the surgery, the pcDNA3 vector or the constitutively active SGK, SGKS422D, was injected to the CA1 area. Before injection, plasmid DNA was diluted in 5% glucose to a stock concentration of 2.77 μg/μl. Branched polyethyleneimine of 25 kDa (Sigma) was diluted to 0.1 m concentration in 5% glucose and added to the DNA solution. Immediately before infusion, 0.1 m polyethyleneimine was added to reach a ratio of polyethyleneimine nitrogen per DNA phosphate equal to 10. The mixture was vortexed for 30 s and allowed to equilibrate for 15 min at room temperature (17Abdallah B. Hassan A. Benoist C. Goula D. Behr J.P. Demeneix B.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1947-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The volume for DNA injection was 0.5 μl each side at a concentration of 1.2 μg/μl. The volume for IGF-1 injection was also 0.5 μl each side at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. Rat SGK1 siRNA was designed according to a previous report (18Wu W. Chaudhuri S. Brickley D.R. Pang D. Karrison T. Conzen S.D. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1757-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The siRNA sequences of rat SGK1 was synthesized by Ambion with the following sequences: sgk-1 sense oligonucleotide, 5′-GUCCCUCUCAACAAAUCAAtt-3′; antisense oligonucleotide, 5′-UUGAUUUGUUGAGAGGGACtt-3′ (8Yang Y.C. Lin C.H. Lee E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8357-8370Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The siRNA sequences for rat Akt was synthesized by MDBIO (Taipei, Taiwan) with the following sequences: Akt sense oligonucleotide, 5′-UGCCCUUCUACAACCAGGAtt-3′; antisense oligonucleotide, 5′-UCCUGGUUGUAGAAGGGCAtt-3′ (19Katome T. Obata T. Matsushima R. Masuyama N. Cantley L.C. Gotoh Y. Kishi K. Shiota H. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28312-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Silencer Negative Control number 1 siRNA (Ambion) was used as a control. SGK1 siRNA and negative control siRNA (8 pmol/μl each) were transfected to the hippocampus (0.5 μl each side) by using the cationic polymer transfection reagent jetSI™ 10 mm (Polyplus-Transfection). The injection rate was at 0.2 μl/min. Animals were sacrificed 48 h after DNA transfection or 30 min after IGF-1 injection. For combined treatment, SGK1 siRNA or Akt siRNA was given 96 h before IGF-1 treatment. The hippocampal CA1 tissue was dissected for Western blot analyses of IKKα, pIKKα Thr-23, SGK1, Akt, or for real time PCR analyses of NMDA receptor subunit expression. RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real Time PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from 20 mg of hippocampal CA1 tissue or cell lines (∼106 cells, PC12 or Neuro2A) by using the RNAspin mini kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA samples were resuspended in nuclease-free water and quantified spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. All RNA samples had an A260:A280 value between 1.8 and 2.0. Total RNA (1 μg) together with 0.5 μg of oligo(dT) and nuclease-free water was pre-heated at 70 °C for 5 min. It was then quickly chilled at 4 °C for 5 min. The mixture was then added with 5× reaction buffer, MgCl2, and Improm-II reverse transcriptase (Promega) to a total volume of 20 μl. The room temperature mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 5 min, 42 °C for 60 min, and stopped by heating at 70 °C for 15 min. The cDNA stock was then stored at –20 °C. Quantitative PCRs for the endogenous control gene hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and NR1 were carried out by using the TaqMan Universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems); for NR2A and NR2B assays, the Power SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) was used. The primers and TaqMan probe of HPRT were synthesized by Applied Biosystems with the following sequences: HPRT forward primer 5′-GCCGACCGGTTCTGTCAT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TCATAACCTGGTTCATCATCACTAATC-3′; TaqMan probe 5′-TCGACCCTCAGTCCCAGCGTCG-3′. The primers and probe of NR1, the Assays-on-Demand Gene Expression products (Rn00433800_m1, Applied Biosystems) were used. The primers of NR2A and NR2B were designed according to a previous report (20Sun L. Shipley M.T. Lidow M.S. Synapse. 2000; 35: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The primers of NR2A were synthesized with the following sequence: forward primer 5′-GACGGTCTTGGGATCTTAAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TGACCATGAATTGGTGCAGG-3′. The primers of NR2B were synthesized with the following sequence: forward primer 5′-CAAGAACATGGCCAACCT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGTACACATTGCTGTCCTGC-3′. Amplification was performed by using the 7500 Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems), and the reaction condition followed the manufacturer's protocols. The thermal cycler protocol used is as follows: stage 1, 50 °C for 2 min; stage 2, 95 °C for 10 min; stage 3, 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min (40 cycles); and stage 4 is the dissociation stage for SYBR Green system to confirm specific amplifications. The cycle threshold (Ct) values and related data were analyzed by using the 7500 System sequence detection software (Applied Biosystems). The expression of NMDA receptors subunits was normalized with that of the endogenous control gene HPRT. The relative expression levels (in fold) were determined by using the 2–(ΔΔCt) method (21Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (San Diego). 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116537) Google Scholar). No Shift Transcription Factor Assay—A rapid and sensitive way to measure NF-κB activity in hippocampal nuclear extract without isotopes or gels was also carried out by using the No-shift transcription factor assay kit with NF-κB reagent (Novagen). In this assay, the biotinylated oligonucleotides with NF-κB consensus sequence and NF-κB in the nuclear extracts form complex first. The NF-κB (p65)-specific antibody was then used to detect the NF-κB-DNA complex captured on the streptavidin plate. Finally, the appropriate secondary antibody, HRP conjugate, and TMB substrate were used to develop colorimetric signal, and the result was collected by reading the absorbance at 450 nm. Nuclear Extract Preparation—Briefly, 90–120 mg of hippocampal tissue was homogenized with a Dounce tissue homogenizer (Wheaton, NJ) in a homogenization buffer (10% w/v) containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 300–400 μl of extraction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin. The suspension was incubated on ice for 30 min for high salt extraction followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant, which contains DNA-binding proteins, was carefully removed and stored at –80 °C until further use. Spatial Learning—The Morris water maze learning paradigm was used this study. The water maze was a plastic circular pool (2.0 m diameter and 0.6 m height) filled with water (25 ± 2 °C) to a depth of 20 cm. A circular platform (13.5 cm diameter) was placed at a specific location away from the edge of the pool. The top of the platform was submerged 1.5 cm below the water surface. Water was made cloudy by the addition of milk powder. Distinctive visual cues were set on the wall. For spatial learning, animals were subjected to three trials a day with one given early in the mornin"
https://openalex.org/W1976388730,"The proton pump ATPase (H+-ATPase) of the plant plasma membrane is regulated by an autoinhibitory C-terminal domain, which can be displaced by phosphorylation of the penultimate Thr residue and the subsequent binding of 14-3-3 proteins. We performed a mass spectrometric analysis of PMA2 (plasma membrane H+-ATPase isoform 2) isolated from Nicotiana tabacum suspension cells and identified two new phosphorylated residues in the enzyme 14-3-3 protein binding site: Thr931 and Ser938. When PMA2 was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mutagenesis of each of these two residues into Asp prevented growth of a yeast strain devoid of its own H+-ATPases. When the Asp mutations were individually introduced in a constitutively activated mutant of PMA2 (E14D), they still allowed yeast growth but at a reduced rate. Purification of His-tagged PMA2 showed that the T931D or S938D mutation prevented 14-3-3 protein binding, although the penultimate Thr955 was still phosphorylated, indicating that Thr955 phosphorylation is not sufficient for full enzyme activation. Expression of PMA2 in an N. tabacum cell line also showed an absence of 14-3-3 protein binding resulting from the T931D or S938D mutation. Together, the data show that activation of H+-ATPase by the binding of 14-3-3 proteins is negatively controlled by phosphorylation of two residues in the H+-ATPase 14-3-3 protein binding site. The data also show that phosphorylation of the penultimate Thr and 14-3-3 binding each contribute in part to H+-ATPase activation.

Plasma membrane H+-ATPases play a key role in nutrient transport by creating pH and potential gradients across the cell membrane, which are used by a whole set of secondary transporters (e.g. the use of protons in symport or antiport). Besides being involved in nutrition, H+-ATPases are also implicated in various physiological roles, such as control of the stomatal aperture, cell elongation, plant development, organ movement, and intracellular pH homeostasis, although evidence for the direct involvement of H+-ATPases in some of these roles is scarce (for reviews, see Refs. 1Sondergaard T.E. Schulz A. Palmgren M.G. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 2475-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar and 2Duby, G., and Boutry, M. (2008) Pflug. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Considering the high levels of H+-ATPases in the plasma membrane and the large variety of physiological roles, one would expect this enzyme to be tightly regulated. These proteins are encoded by a gene family of about 10 members in Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, and Nicotiana plumbaginifolia (3Arango M. Gevaudant F. Oufattole M. Boutry M. Planta. 2003; 216: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 4Baxter I. Tchieu J. Sussman M.R. Boutry M. Palmgren M.G. Gribskov M. Harper J.F. Axelsen K.B. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 618-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Depending on the gene, expression is either restricted to particular cell types or widespread in the plant, with the possibility of more than one gene being expressed in a given cell type at the same developmental stage, thus precluding the characterization of a single isoform from plant material (3Arango M. Gevaudant F. Oufattole M. Boutry M. Planta. 2003; 216: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). One case of H+-ATPase post-translational regulation that has been extensively described at the molecular level involves the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain (5Palmgren M.G. Sommarin M. Serrano R. Larsson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20470-20475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the penultimate residue of H+-ATPase, a Thr, triggers the binding of regulatory 14-3-3 proteins, resulting in the formation of an activated complex (6Camoni L. Iori V. Marra M.

A still unresolved question concerns the respective roles of Thr phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding. Are they both required before the enzyme is activated, or does 14-3-3 binding further activate an enzyme already partly activated by Thr phosphorylation? Another possibility would be to consider that Thr phosphorylation fully activates H+-ATPase and that 14-3-3 binding stabilizes the activated form. H+-ATPase activation by Thr phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding has been observed in guard cells upon blue light activation (8Kinoshita T. Shimazaki K.

Recently, a Ser/Thr protein kinase, PKS5, was shown to phosphorylate Ser931 of AHA2 both in vitro and in a yeast expression system, and this resulted in prevention of 14-3-3 protein binding and lower enzyme activity; however, attempts to confirm the phosphorylation of this residue in vivo by mass spectrometry (MS) 3The abbreviations used are: MS, mass spectrometry; Mes, 2-morpholinoethansulfonic acid; 5′-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid. failed (27Fuglsang A.T.

Proteomics analysis of plasma membrane proteins from Arabidopsis seedlings supplied with sucrose showed that phosphorylation of Thr881 in the AHA2 C-terminal region resulted in enzyme activation by a phosphorylation event outside the 14-3-3 binding site (16Niittyla T.

In this study, we took advantage of a transgenic N. tabacum BY2 cell line expressing His-tagged PMA2 (plasma membrane H+-ATPase isoform 2) (28Woloszynska M. Kanczewska J. Drabkin A. Maudoux O. Dambly S. Boutry M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), one of the two most widely expressed H+-ATPase isoforms in N. plumbaginifolia (3Arango M. Gevaudant F. Oufattole M. Boutry M. Planta. 2003; 216: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and performed MS analysis on the purified His-tagged PMA2. Two phosphorylated sites, Thr931 and Ser938, were identified. Expression of PMA2 mutated at these sites in yeast and tobacco cells strongly suggested that their phosphorylation interferes with the binding of 14-3-3 proteins and therefore H+-ATPase activation. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—Yeast strains were grown on rich medium containing 2% glucose, 2% yeast extract (YD medium) or on minimal medium containing 2% galactose, 0.7% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 0.115% drop mix composed of all amino acids required for growth (DOGal medium) (29Treco D.A.

The pH was adjusted to 4.0 or 6.5 with HCl or KOH, and 2% agar was added to obtain solid medium. 5′-Fluoroorotic acid (5′-FOA) medium was prepared as described in Ref. 29Treco D.A. Lundblad V.

The generation of the PMA2-E14D, PMA2-P154R, and PMA2-N510L activating mutants has been described previously (31Morsomme P. Dambly S. Maudoux O. Boutry M. J. Biol.

PMA2-P154R and PMA2-N510K were tagged with 6 His residues by replacing the NheI/BglII DNA fragment of 2μp(PMA1)6hispma2 by that from 2μp(PMA1)pma2P154R or 2μp(PMA1)pma2N510K, respectively.

The mutation of Thr931 and Ser938 to Ala and Asp residues was achieved by amplifying a modified fragment between the BglII and XbaI restriction sites of 2μp(PMA1)6hispma2 plasmid by triple PCR and inserting it into 2μp(PMA1)6hispma2 opened by BglII and XbaI restriction. The Thr931-Ser938 double mutants were obtained using the same PCR strategy, except that the starting plasmids were 2μp(PMA1)6hispma2S938D and 2μp(PMA1)6hispma2S938A. Insertion of the Ser938 and Thr931 mutations into 2μp(PMA1)6hispma2E14D was performed by exchanging the BglII/XbaI DNA fragments. The PMA2-P154R and PMA2-N510L mutants carrying the Ser938 mutations were obtained by replacing the NheI/BglII DNA fragment from 2μp(PMA1)6hispma2S938D or 2μp(PMA1)6hispma2S938D with that from 2μp(PMA1)pma2P154R or 2μp(PMA1)pma2N510K, respectively. The YAK2 yeast strain has disrupted yeast PMA1 and PMA2 genes and contains a centromeric plasmid carrying the yeast PMA1 gene under the control of the GAL1–10 promoter and the URA3 gene for selection (30de Kerchove d'Exaerde A.

The plant binary vectors used for the N. tabacum BY2 cell transformation were obtained by first inserting a SmaI and XbaII fragment from the yeast 2μp(PMA1)6hispma2, -S938A, S938D, T931A, and T931D plasmid, corresponding, respectively, to the PMA2-S938A, PMA2-S938D, PMA2-T931A, and T931D coding sequence into the pAUX3131 vector (33Goderis I.J.

Membrane Isolation—All buffers were supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, antipain, pepstatin, and chymostatin (each 2 μg/ml). Yeast microsomal and plasma membrane fractions were obtained as described previously (31Morsomme P. Dambly S. Maudoux O. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34837-34842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), except that the homogenization buffer was 250 mm sorbitol, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 20% ethylene glycol, 30 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm NaMoO4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 60 mm Tris, pH 8.0 (HCl), and the suspension buffer was 250 mm sorbitol, 20% ethylene glycol, 30 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 60 mm Tris, pH 8.0 (HCl). Microsomal membranes were prepared from BY2 cells as in Ref. 11Kanczewska J. Marco S. Vandermeeren C. Maudoux O. Rigaud J.L. Boutry M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11675-11680Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar. The homogenization and suspension buffers were supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors and had the same composition as those used for yeast microsomal membrane preparation, except that 0.6% polyvinylpolypyrolidone was added to the homogenization buffer. N. tabacum BY2 Cell Culture and Transformation—BY2 cells were maintained on MS medium (catalog number 2610024; MP Biomedicals, LLC) supplemented with 3% sucrose, 0.2 mg/liter 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 0.2 g/liter KH2PO4, pH 5.8, 50 mg/liter myo-inositol, 5 mg/liter thiamine-HCl. BY2 cells were diluted 20-fold each week in fresh medium and grown as described previously (35Nagata T. Nemoto Y. Hasezawa S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 132: 1-30Crossref Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Transient expression of the mutated PMA2 isoforms was performed by co-cultivating for 68 h 24 ml of 4-day-old BY2 cell culture with 7 ml of Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404virG (36van der Fits L. Deakin E.A. Hoge J.H.C. Memelink J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 43: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) transformed with the different pPZP-PMA2 and grown to an A600 of 1.4. A. tumefaciens and BY2 cells were washed and co-cultured in BY2 cell medium at pH 5.3 supplemented with 10 mm glucose and 50 μm acetosyringone. PMA2 Purification—PMA2 isoforms expressed in yeast or in N. tabacum BY2 cells were purified on Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). The yeast microsomal fraction (2 mg/ml) was stripped for 30 min at 4 °C in TK20 buffer (20 mm imidazole, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) supplemented with 0.25% octaoxyethylene tetradecyl. After centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C, the pellet was resuspended in TK20 buffer (2 mg/ml), which was then made in 2% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and the sample was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C, the supernatant was incubated with the Ni2+-NTA resin for 2 h at 4 °C and washed with five volumes of TK20 0.05% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and elution was performed using gel loading buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue, 1% dithiothreitol, 90 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). The N. tabacum BY2 microsomal fraction (2 mg/ml) was stripped for 30 min at 4 °C using 500 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm imidazole, 20% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Mes, 0.6 mg/ml octaoxyethylene tetradecyl, pH 7.0, and then the membranes were solubilized in 20 mm imidazole, 20% glycerol, 150 mm KCl, 14 mg/ml n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, pH 8.0. The soluble fraction was incubated with Ni2+-NTA resin for 2 h at 4 °C, and then the resin was washed with 20 mm imidazole, 20% glycerol, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, pH 8.0, and bound proteins were eluted with gel loading buffer. To prevent proteolytic activity, all buffers were supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, antipain, pepstatin, and chymostatin (each 2 μg/ml). Mass Spectrometric Analysis—The band of interest was excised from the SDS gel and subjected to overnight digestion at 37 °C with 250 ng of trypsin in 100–200 μl of 200 mm ammonium bicarbonate. For the neutral loss analysis, the phosphorylated peptides were purified using immobilized metal (Fe3+) affinity chromatography (POROS MC20, Applied Biosystems) according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer, except for the elution buffer (1 n NH4OH). Neutral loss scanning was executed on an Applied Biosystems API 3000 mass spectrometer, equipped with an off-line nanospray source. For the multiple reaction monitoring analysis, the peptide mixture was enriched for phosphopeptides on PhosTrap (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) beads as described by the manufacturer. Phosphopeptides were analyzed by nano-LC-MS/MS on a Dionex Ultimate capillary liquid chromatography system coupled to an Applied Biosystems 4000 QTRAP mass spectrometer. Peptides were separated on a PepMap C18 column developed with a 30-min linear gradient (0.1% formic acid, 6% acetonitrile/water to 0.1% formic acid, 40% acetonitrile/water). Multiple reaction monitoring was then used to induce product (+) ion scanning to determine the peptide sequence and to localize the phosphorylated residue(s). ATPase Assays—ATPase assays were performed in a 96-hole microplate at 30 °C in reaction medium (4 mm MgATP, 1 mm free Mg2+ (MgCl2), 50 mm Mes (pH 6.5), 20 mm KNO3, 0.2 mm NaMoO4, 0.05% Brij, and 10 mm sodium azide). The reaction was started by adding 10 μl of 4.34 mm ATP (the total amounts of ATP and Mg2+ to be added to the reaction mixture at the indicated pH were calculated in order to obtain 4 mm MgATP with 1 mm free Mg2+ (37Wach A. Ahlers J. Graber P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)) to 40 μl of reaction medium containing 1.5 μg of protein in the presence or absence of 0.2 mm orthovanadate. After 3, 6, and 9 min, 60 μl of 1% SDS was added to stop the reaction, and 30 μl of 50% (w/v) (NH4)6Mo7O24, 4 n H2SO4 and 30 μl of 1% 4-methylaminophenol sulfate, 3% NaHSO3 were added successively. Measurements of the External Acidification by Yeast Cells—Cells were grown in YD medium, harvested at the late exponential phase, and washed three times in ice-cold water. Then 2 108 (pH 6.5) or 109 (pH 4.0) cells were added to 10 ml of 200 mm glucose, 20 mm KCl in either 2 mm Mes, pH 6.5, or 0.2 mm citrate, pH 4.0, in a vial with a magnetic stirrer and a pH electrode at 30 °C. pH was recorded for 20 min, and the pumping activity was calculated as pH units min–1 (109 cells)–1. Identification of New PMA2 Phosphorylated Sites—Our aim was to identify phosphorylation sites in PMA2, one of the two most widely expressed H+-ATPases in N. plumbaginifolia, using an N. tabacum cell line (BY2) expressing His6-tagged PMA2 (28Woloszynska M. Kanczewska J. Drabkin A. Maudoux O. Dambly S. Boutry M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). PMA2 was solubilized from the microsomal fraction, purified by Ni2+-NTA chromatography, and electrophoresed on SDS gels. The band corresponding to PMA2 was excised from the gel and digested with trypsin and phosphorylated tryptic peptides enriched by PhosTrap titanium beads (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or by immobilized metal (Fe3+) affinity chromatography (POROS MC20; Applied Biosystems). Peptide analysis by neutral loss of 32.4 and 49 Da, corresponding to the loss of a phosphate residue (98 Da) in peptides bearing three (98/3) or two (98/2) positive charges, respectively, indicated the presence of several phosphorylated PMA2 peptides located in the C-terminal region or in the large loop of the enzyme (see supplemental Fig. 1 and Table 1). Among these peptides, we sought to confirm the identification of the phosphorylated residues in the C-terminal region, because they were observed by both neutral loss of 32.4 and 49 and also because they belong to the 14-3-3 binding site. Using multiple reaction monitoring, we confirmed the presence of one phosphopeptide containing phosphorylated Ser938 and another containing phosphorylated Thr931 and Ser938 (Fig. 1). Both residues are located within the C-terminal region interacting with 14-3-3 proteins (12Ottmann C. Marco S. Jaspert N. Marcon C. Schauer N. Weyand M. Vandermeeren C. Duby G. Boutry M.

Open table in a new tab Characterization of PMA2 Thr931 and Ser938 Mutants Expressed in Yeast—For a more detailed characterization, Thr931 and Ser938 were mutagenized singly or in combination to Ala (to prevent phosphorylation) or Asp (to mimic the negative charge of a phosphorylated residue), and the resulting His6-tagged PMA2 mutants were expressed from a yeast plasmid in the S. cerevisiae YAK2 strain in which the cell's own two H+-ATPase genes are disrupted and which is maintained by the presence of yeast PMA1 under the control of the GAL1 promoter on a centromeric plasmid carrying the selective URA3 gene (30de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. Supply P. Dufour J.P. Bogaerts P. Thines D. Goffeau A. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23828-23837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In order to test the ability of the PMA2 mutants to sustain yeast growth, the yeast transformants were shifted to glucose medium in order to repress yeast PMA1 expression. As shown in Fig. 2A, only wild-type PMA2 and PMA2-S938A were able to sustain yeast growth (left), and none of the combined Thr931 and Ser938 mutations allowed yeast growth (right), demonstrating a dominant effect of the Thr931 mutations. Western blotting confirmed the presence of the PMA2 mutants (data not shown), ruling out an indirect effect of the mutations on H+-ATPase expression. To confirm the results, we shifted the transformed strains to glucose medium containing 5′-FOA, a chemical that is converted into a toxic compound by the URA3 gene product. Since this gene is present on the plasmid bearing the yeast PMA1, growth in the presence of 5′-FOA selects for strains that have lost this plasmid and thus the yeast PMA1 but contain a functional plant H+-ATPase gene present on the other plasmid. Colonies were obtained for the strains expressing wild-type PMA2 and PMA2-S938A, the latter growing faster (Fig. 2B). No colony was ever obtained with the other constructs, confirming that the T931A, T931D, or S938D mutation reduces H+-ATPase activity to a level that does not allow yeast growth (data not shown). To further investigate the role of these phosphorylated residues, we introduced the Thr931 and Ser938 single mutations into the constitutively activated PMA2-E14D mutant, in which the activating mutation results in higher H+-ATPase activity and better yeast growth, probably by decreasing the interaction of the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain with the rest of the protein and making Thr955 more accessible to phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding. This in turn might reduce access of phosphatases to phosphorylated Thr955 (31Morsomme P. Dambly S. Maudoux O. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34837-34842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, in this PMA2-activated form, the T931A, T931D, or S938D mutation did not prevent the appearance of colonies after 5′-FOA selection and did not affect yeast growth at pH 6.5 on solid medium (left) and in liquid culture (duplication time between 2.6 and 2.9 h for PMA2-E14D and E14D-mutated strains). However, when grown under more demanding conditions (i.e. at pH 4.0 (right)), PMA2-E14D/T931D and PMA2-E14D/T931A cells did not grow (more than 20 h duplication time in liquid culture), whereas PMA2-E14D/S938D (6.5 h duplication time) grew more slowly than those expressing PMA2-E14D (5 h) or PMA2-E14D/S938A (4.8 h), showing that the activating E14D mutation only partly overruled the inhibitory effect of the other mutations. Since both Thr931 and Ser938 are in the 14-3-3 protein binding domain, we wondered whether the growth reduction was related to a lower activation of the enzyme due to reduced phosphorylation of the penultimate Thr955 and/or reduced 14-3-3 protein binding. We and others previously measured phosphorylation of the Thr955 using commercial anti-phospho-Thr antibodies (27Fuglsang A.T. Guo Y. Cuin T.A. Qiu Q. Song C. Kristiansen K.A. Bych K. Schulz A.

https://openalex.org/W1986909751,"Asthmatic attacks often follow viral infections with subsequent airway smooth muscle cell proliferation and the formation of an abnormal hyaluronan extracellular matrix with infiltrated leukocytes. In this study, we show that murine airway smooth muscle cells (MASM) treated with polyinosinic acid-polycytidylic acid (poly(I,C)), a double-stranded RNA that simulates a viral infection, synthesize an abnormal hyaluronan matrix that binds leukocytes (U937 cells). Synthesis of this matrix is initiated rapidly and accumulates linearly for approximately 10 h, reaching a plateau level approximately 7-fold higher than control cultures. MASM cells treated with tunicamycin, to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress, also rapidly initiate synthesis of the abnormal hyaluronan matrix with linear accumulation for approximately 10 h, but only reach a plateau level approximately 2-fold higher than control cultures. In contrast to poly(I,C), the response to tunicamycin depends on cell density, with pre-confluent cells producing more abnormal matrix per cell. Furthermore, U937 cell adhesion per hyaluronan content is higher in the sparse matrix produced in response to tunicamycin, suggesting that the structure in the poly(I,C)-induced matrix masks potential binding sites. When MASM cells were exposed to tunicamycin and poly(I,C) at the same time, U937 cell adhesion was partially additive, implying that these two toxins stimulate hyaluronan synthesis through two different pathways. We also characterized the size of hyaluronan produced by MASM cells, in response to poly(I,C) and tunicamycin, and we found that it ranges from 1500 to 4000 kDa, the majority of which was approximately 4000 kDa and not different in size than hyaluronan made by untreated cells."
https://openalex.org/W2039221205,"Both vertebrates and invertebrates employ alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as an essential component of their innate immune system. However, evolutionary relation of these immune molecules remains unresolved. Venoms, as key weapons of venomous arthropods for prey and defense, receive increasing recognition as an emerging source of such peptides. From a cDNA library prepared from the venom gland of the scorpion Mesobuthus eupeus, clones encoding precursors of two new AMPs, named meucin-13 (IFGAIAGLLKNIF-NH(2)) and meucin-18 (FFGHLFKLATKIIPSLFQ), have been isolated. The precursor of meucins consists of a signal peptide, a mature peptide, and an acidic propeptide, in which dibasic residues as the typical processing signal are located between the mature and propeptide. Meucin-13 is an ortholog of several previously described AMPs from scorpion venom and has also detectable sequence similarity to temporins, a large family of AMPs from frog skin, whereas meucin-18 displays some similarity to AMPs from diverse origin including arthropod venoms, fish mast cells, and frog skins. These two meucin peptides form alpha-helical structure in the presence of 50% trifluoroethanol (TFE), a membrane-mimicking environment, as identified by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. This finding is further verified by their NMR structures that show a typical alpha-helical amphipathic design, a structural prerequisite for cytolytic activity. Meucins exhibit extensive cytolytic effects on both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (gram(+) and gram(-) bacteria, fungi, yeasts, rabbit erythrocytes, and rat dorsal root ganglion cells) at micromolar concentrations. It is remarkable that muecin-18 was 2- to >14-fold more potent than meucin-13 against nearly all the cells tested. Structural differences in hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance and cationic amino acid location between two meucins could account for their differential potency. Despite these differences, commonalities at precursor organization, three-dimensional structure, and biological function suggests that meucins are two evolutionarily related AMPs and likely originated from a common ancestor by gene duplication. Our work presented here also provides new insights into an evolutionary link among AMPs from invertebrates and vertebrates and clues for evolutionary convergence between AMPs and virus fusion domains."

Point mutations in ETF, which may compromise folding, and/or activity, are associated with both mild and severe forms of MADD. Here we report the investigation on the conformational and stability properties of the disease-causing variant ETFβ-D128N, and our findings on the effect of flavinylation in modulating protein conformational stability and activity. A combination of biochemical and biophysical methods including circular dichroism, visible absorption, flavin, and tryptophan fluorescence emission allowed the analysis of structural changes and of the FAD moiety. The ETFβ-D128N variant retains the overall fold of the wild type, but under stress conditions its flavin becomes less tightly bound. Flavinylation is shown to improve the conformational stability and biological activity of a destabilized D128N variant protein. Moreover, the presence of flavin prevented proteolytic digestion by avoiding protein destabilization. A patient homozygous for the ETFβ-D128N mutation developed severe disease symptoms in association with a viral infection and fever. In agreement, our results suggest that heat inactivation of the mutant may be more relevant at temperatures above 37 °C.

FAD exerts the effect of a pharmacological chaperone, improving ETF conformation, and yielding a more stable and active enzyme.

As a result of deficient function of either ETF or ETF:QO, the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases are blocked because they cannot transfer the electrons gained in the dehydrogenation reactions, entailing accumulation of various acyl-esters in blood and urine, hence the term MADD (1Frerman F.E.

Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Childs B. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease.

There is evidence that the severity of the clinical phenotype, to some extent, depends on the location and nature of mutations in the genes encoding ETF or ETF:QO, with null mutations severely affecting mRNA expression, processing and/or stability being associated with lethal disease and missense mutations leaving some residual ETF/ETF:QO enzyme activity being associated with milder clinical forms (6Olsen R.K.

In patients with milder disease variants, symptoms are often intermittent and only become evident during periods of illness and catabolic stress, indicating that in this group of patients, in whom residual ETF/ETF:QO enzyme activity allows modulation of the enzymatic phenotype, the disease severity does not depend only on the nature of the gene defect but also on cellular factors that may modulate the enzymatic phenotype (6Olsen R.K. Andresen B.S. Christensen E. Bross P. Skovby F. Gregersen N. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 22: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This potential for in vitro modulation of the enzymatic phenotype has been established for a large number of disease-causing mutations affecting flavin-containing mitochondrial acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (10Gregersen N. Bross P. Andresen B.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 470-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In these cases, missense mutations have been shown to impair folding to the native structure and/or destabilize the native folded structure, resulting in decreased enzyme levels, which are subject to modification by environmental conditions like temperature and availability of quality control chaperones and proteases (11Ensenauer R. He M. Willard J.M. Goetzman E.S. Corydon T.J. Vandahl B.B. Mohsen A.W. Isaya G. Vockley J. J. Biol.

The cofactor FAD is another cellular factor that may modulate the enzymatic phenotype of disease-causing mutations in mitochondrial flavoproteins. It has been observed for acyl-CoA dehydrogenases and for ETF that levels of available FAD have a strong impact on folding and maintenance of the native structure (14Nagao M. Tanaka K. J. Biol.

Decreased dietary intake of riboflavin, and also certain physiological conditions like pregnancy (reviewed in Ref. 27Powers H.J. Am. J. Clin.

Res. 1998; 108: 182-190PubMed Google Scholar)) may induce a depletion in FAD content, which will pose high demands on flavoproteins and perhaps especially on those with folding defects. This raises the interesting hypothesis that availability of FAD may be a predisposing factor in the cellular pathogenesis of genetic disorders of acyl-CoA dehydrogenations. However, the additional possibility of a ligand-induced folding effect exerted upon FAD binding to a mutant protein, which becomes destabilized upon an adverse physiological condition, has not yet been explored. Here we address this hypothesis by studying in vitro the effect of flavinylation on the folding, conformational quality and proteolytic susceptibility of a mild variant of human ETF (ETFβ-D128N). Studies were also performed under physiological heat stress conditions, to mimic the adverse physiological factors of a fever event. Chemicals—All reagents were of the highest purity grade commercially available. Octanoyl-CoA, FAD, AMP, and urea were purchased from Sigma. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was purchased from VWR International. Gene Expression and Protein Purification—Escherichia coli JM109 cells from Promega transformed with ETF plasmids for the wild type (WT), and ETFβ-D128N variant were grown as described previously (6Olsen R.K. Andresen B.S. Christensen E. Bross P. Skovby F. Gregersen N. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 22: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in dYT medium (16 g of Bacto Tryptone, 10 g of Bacto Yeast extract and 5 g of NaCl) supplemented with 10 μg·ml–1 kanamycin at 37 °C or 30 °C, up to an absorbance at 532 nm between 0.5 and 0.8, and then induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 mm Hepes, 10% ethylene glycol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Roth) (Buffer A) in presence of 0.1 mg·ml–1 FAD, DNase (PVL), and disrupted in a French press. The soluble extract was applied to a 10-ml Q-Sepharose fast flow (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed with five column volumes (Vc) of buffer A, and bound proteins were eluted by a linear gradient ranging from 0–1 m NaCl, in buffer A. ETF eluted as a pure protein at ∼250 mm salt, as confirmed by SDS/PAGE. The proteins were fast-frozen using liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. To ensure full occupancy of FAD sites, the protein was incubated with 2.5-fold molar excess FAD at 4 °C overnight, and the free cofactor was removed with extensive washings by ultrafiltration/dilution. This procedure yielded FAD-to-protein ratios higher than 0.95 both for WT and ETFβ-D128N. Unless otherwise mentioned, all experiments were performed with the proteins containing full occupancy of FAD sites. Structural Analysis—The crystallographic structure of human ETF (PDB code: 1efv) was visualized using PyMOL (DeLano Scientific). Analysis of the molecular interactions, cofactor contacts, topological features, and generation of the model of the ETFβ-D128N was carried out using the WhatIF web server and the PDBsum data base (31Laskowski R.A. Chistyakov V.V. Thornton J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D266-D268Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Biochemical Methods and Activity Assays—Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay. Flavin content was determined using the molar extinction coefficient ∊436 nm = 13,400 m–1·cm–1 reported for FAD bound to ETF (5McKean M.C. Beckmann J.D. Frerman F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1866-1870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of the purified proteins was measured monitoring DCPIP reduction, in a coupled assay in which recombinant human MCAD (0.13 μm) and octanoyl-CoA (13 μm), were employed, as described in Ref. 20Rhead W. Roettger V. Marshall T. Amendt B. Pediatr. Res. 1993; 33: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar. One unit of catalytic activity is defined as nmol of DCPIP reduced per minute, in the conditions used in the assay. All specific activities reported are based on total flavin content. Spectroscopic Techniques—UV/visible spectra were recorded at room temperature in a Shimadzu UVPC-1601 spectrometer. Far-UV CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter with Peltier temperature control. A quartz polarized 1-mm path length quartz cuvette (Hellma) was used, and protein concentrations ranged from 0.1–0.2 mg·ml–1. Fluorescence spectroscopy was performed using a Cary Eclipse instrument. For tryptophan emission studies, excitation was set at 280 nm, whereas for FAD emission, excitation was carried out at 436 nm. Unless otherwise noted, the slits for excitation and emission were set to 5 and 10 nm, respectively. Typically, ETF protein concentration in fluorescence studies was 1 μm. Flavin-depleted ETF—Apo-ETF was prepared using KBr solutions as in Ref. 32Salazar D. Zhang L. deGala G.D. Frerman F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26425-26433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar. Briefly, proteins were incubated in 3 m KBr, 10 mm Hepes pH 7.0, and 20% ethylene glycol solution for 1 h. Released FAD was washed by repeated ultrafiltration/dilution in the presence of 1 mm dithiothreitol and a 10-fold molar excess AMP. In the case of the D128N variant, we also used a milder procedure taking advantage of the spontaneous process of flavin release, which had already been described for ETF (33Sato K. Nishina Y. Shiga K. J Biochem. 2003; 134: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), to produce a FAD-depleted fraction: when the protein is stored at –20 °C during 60 days, a decrease in FAD content and in the specific activity was observed, without a significant alteration of the protein folding, as determined by far-UV CD. Unbound FAD was removed by repeated ultrafiltration/dilution, yielding a sample with FAD content as low as 10%. Dissociation Constant for FAD Binding—Apo-ETF (1–4 μm) in the presence of 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10-fold molar excess of AMP, 10 mm Hepes pH 7.0, and 20% ethylene glycol was placed in a quartz cuvette at 15 °C. After each addition of known amounts of FAD the mixture was allowed to equilibrate for 2 min, and the visible spectrum was measured. The spectra of free and bound FAD are clearly distinct, making possible to quantify the concentration of each species at a given point. The fraction of bound FAD (fbound) was calculated using the proportionality fbound ∝ A1 – (∊1/∊2) × A2, where Ai is absorbance at the wavelength i, and ∊i is extinction coefficient of free FAD at a wavelength. In this case, the wavelengths 465 nm (∊1 = 10190 m–1 cm–1) and 435 nm (∊2 = 10150 m–1 cm–1) were used to distinguish between bound and free FAD, respectively. The concentration of free FAD in the equilibrium was measured by the equation [FAD]free = [FAD]total – [ETF]total × fbound. The dissociation constant (KD) was obtained by fitting the data of two independent experiments, using the equation, fbound = [FAD]free/(KD + [FAD]free). Kinetics of Flavin Release—Wild-type ETF and the ETFβ-D128N (1 μm), both with full occupancy of FAD sites, were incubated at 39 °C for up to 60 min in 10 mm Hepes, 20% ethylene glycol, pH 7.0. The kinetics of flavin release was monitored from the increase of the 530-nm emission peak arising from free FAD upon excitation at 436 nm. After 1 h of incubation, the samples were boiled for 5 min, to release the remaining FAD, and a spectrum was collected at 39 °C. The fraction of bound FAD was determined at each point in respect to the point of 100% release of FAD. Chemical Stability Studies—ETFβ-D128N (16 μm) depleted of flavin by milder procedure (see above), was incubated overnight with 10 mm Hepes, 10% ethylene glycol pH 7.8 at 4 °C, in the absence and in the presence of a 2.5-fold excess of FAD (40 μm). Samples were diluted in different urea solutions, in 2 mm Hepes pH 7.8, equilibrated at room temperature for 15 min, after which the Trp emission spectra were recorded. Accurate concentration of the urea stock solutions was confirmed by refractive index measurements (34Shirley B.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 40: 177-190PubMed Google Scholar), and the pH was verified before the experiment. Fluorescence emission data in the 300–400-nm interval was analyzed determining the average emission wavelength (AEW), which takes into account both variations in the emission intensity and position (35Royer C.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 40: 65-89PubMed Google Scholar). The denaturation curves were determined plotting the AEW as a function of urea concentration. Data were fitted to a sigmoid curve allowing the determination of an apparent Cm (denaturant concentration at the curve midpoint). The biological activity of the samples incubated overnight was also determined using the assay described above (20Rhead W. Roettger V. Marshall T. Amendt B. Pediatr. Res. 1993; 33: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Limited Proteolysis with Trypsin—Wild type and ETFβ-D128N with full occupancy of FAD sites were incubated overnight in 10 mm Hepes, 10% ethylene glycol pH 7.8 at 4 °C, in the presence of a 2.5-fold molar excess of FAD. Control samples without added FAD were also prepared. These fractions were used to test the susceptibility toward trypsin digestion. Samples were incubated with trypsin (bovine pancreas trypsin; PVL) at 35 °C in 0.1 m Tris/HCl pH 8.5, at a 10-fold excess over the protease. As a control, identical samples without trypsin were submitted to the same procedure. Aliquots with 0.05 nmol of protein were sampled at different time points up to 2 h, and the reaction was stopped by adding SDS-PAGE loading buffer (2% SDS and 5% β-mercaptoethanol). As an internal standard for the quantity of loaded protein in the gel, bovine serum albumin (5 μm) final concentration was also added to loading buffer solution. The products of the proteolysis reaction were analyzed by 12% SDS/PAGE, which were stained with Coomassie Blue. Protein was quantified densitometrically (Bio-Rad Chemidoc XRS), and the percentage of undigested protein was calculated in respect to the total amount of protein at time 0. Reported values refer to the sum of intensities of α and β bands. Thermal Stress Studies—ETFβ-D128N and wild-type ETF (12 μm), in 10 mm Hepes, 20% ethylene glycol pH 7.0, were incubated (100 μl) at different temperatures (33–44 °C) for 1 h, and the residual activity was determined in relation to the activity at time 0 (duplicate measurements were performed for each temperature, and two independent protein batches were assayed). To study the effect of FAD on the loss of activity, ETFβ-D128N (16 μm) was incubated at 39 °C up to 90 min, in the presence of a 2.5-fold excess of FAD (40 μm). Control samples without added FAD were also prepared and treated in the same conditions. At ∼10-min intervals, 3.5 μl of the samples were collected to determine the residual activity as indicated above. For the measurements using fluorescence spectroscopy, spectra were collected at 2-min intervals, up to 1 h. Trp emission was recorded from 300–400 nm with excitation at 280 nm. Unless otherwise noted, ETF concentration used was 1 μm. Impact of the ETFβ-D128N Mutation—ETF is a heterodimer composed of 30 kDa (ETFα) and 28 kDa (ETFβ) subunits, containing one structural AMP, and one catalytic FAD group (2Roberts D.L. Frerman F.E. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14355-14360Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The MADD ETFβ-D128N mutation (6Olsen R.K. Andresen B.S. Christensen E. Bross P. Skovby F. Gregersen N. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 22: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 36Lundemose J.B. Kolvraa S. Gregersen N. Christensen E. Gregersen M. Mol. Pathol. 1997; 50: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which is here investigated, occurs in a β-turn within a very conserved region of the β-subunit, that comprises the segment 126-AIDDD-130 (Fig. 1). These residues have contacts with the AMP and are involved in intersubunit interactions with residues from the α-subunit, via hydrogen bonds and non-bonded contacts. In particular, Asp-128 is directly involved in a network of interactions: it is salt-bridged to the nearby Lys-11 (2.96 Å) from the β-subunit N terminus; and it contacts with several residues from the α-subunit (Ile-148, Tyr-149, Asn-152). Also, ETFβ-D130 is hydrogen-bonded to ETFα-Q265, a residue that contacts with the FAD ring. Therefore, although Asp-128 is not directly involved in an interaction with the flavin, it is located in a relatively sensitive region of the protein, in respect to dimer contacts and flavin binding. Indeed, this is noted by the decreased catalytic activity of purified ETFβ-D128N variant (400 units·mg–1), which is only ∼30% of that of the wild-type protein. Also, the temperature deactivation profile of the ETFβ-D128N variant is much more pronounced than that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 2). For the ETFβ-D128N variant, a rapid drop of the activity is observed if the protein is incubated for 60 min at temperatures above 37 °C, whereas at 37 °C and below, more than 85% of the initial activity is retained.FIGURE 2Thermal inactivation profile of ETFβ-D128N (—) and wild-type ETF (····). For each protein, independent samples were incubated for 60 min at different temperatures, and the remaining catalytic activity was determined (see “Experimental Procedures”). Two independent replicates were assayed, and each point represents the average of two experiments obtained with different protein batches (standard errors are plotted).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Folding and Conformation of ETFβ-D128N—To define the structural characteristics of the ETFβ-D128N variant protein, we have investigated the folding and conformational properties of the purified protein (Fig. 3). Circular dichroism (CD) analysis on the far-UV region showed that the spectrum of the mutant protein, is dominated by minima at 222 and 209 nm, which are typical of a well-folded α/β protein (Fig. 3A). In fact, the two ETF subunits, although they share very little sequence identity, have the same structural topology, consisting of a three-layered αβα sandwich Rossman fold architecture. A comparison between the far-UV CD spectra of the mutant and wild-type ETF shows that the mutation has no impact on the overall fold of the protein. More subtle effects on the tertiary structure were monitored using fluorescence spectroscopy. The protein contains two tryptophan residues, one in each subunit (ETFα-W199 and ETFβ-W144), which are relatively accessible to the solvent, making them particularly sensitive conformational probes. The Trp emission maximum of ETFβ-D128N is 10-nm red-shifted in respect to that of wild-type protein (supplemental Fig. S1A). As a lower emission maximum denotes a more solvent-shielded tryptophan, this shift in the emission from ∼320 to ∼330 nm indicates that the aromatic moieties in ETFβ-D128N are more easily accessible to water molecules. This result suggests looser tertiary contacts in ETFβ-D128N, in comparison to wild-type ETF. The FAD moiety in ETFβ-D128N was analyzed by visible absorption spectroscopy. The two bands typical of flavin, with maxima at 436 and 373 nm, were observed (Fig. 3B). The latter, is ∼3-nm blue-shifted in respect to the band observed in wild-type ETF, which has a maximum at 376 nm. Additionally, the intensity of the FAD fluorescence is a reporter of the status of the flavin moiety, as the FAD emission is quenched when it is bound to the protein (37Herrick K.R. Salazar D. Goodman S.I. Finocchiaro G. Bedzyk L.A. Frerman F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32239-32245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The FAD, which is in an extended conformation according to the crystal structure, has a similar emission spectrum in both wild-type and mutant proteins, denoting a characteristic weak band centered at ∼500 nm. Cofactor Dissociation in ETF—To verify if the ETFβ-D128N mutation induces a perturbation of the flavin binding site, the dissociation constants for FAD binding to wild-type ETF and ETFβ-D128N mutant were measured. When substoichiometric quantities of FAD were added to wild-type ETF apoprotein, the characteristic ETF visible spectrum became immediately evident (Fig. 4A). In the case of ETFβ-D128N, an increased aggregation of the apoprotein was noted during the experiment, as evidenced from the increase of absorbance at lower wavelengths due to scatte"
https://openalex.org/W2000461686,"The role of non-Smad proteins in the regulation of transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signaling is an emerging line of active investigation. Here, we characterize the role of KLF14, as a TGFβ-inducible, non-Smad protein that silences the TGFβ receptor II (TGFβRII) promoter. Together with endocytosis, transcriptional silencing is a critical mechanism for down-regulating TGFβ receptors at the cell surface. However, the mechanisms underlying transcriptional repression of these receptors remain poorly understood. KLF14 has been chosen from a comprehensive screen of 24 members of the Sp/KLF family due to its TGFβ inducibility, its ability to regulate the TGFβRII promoter, and the fact that this protein had yet to be functionally characterized. We find that KLF14 represses the TGFβRII, a function that is augmented by TGFβ treatment. Mapping of the TGFβRII promoter, in combination with site-directed mutagenesis, electromobility shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, have identified distinct GC-rich sequences used by KLF14 to regulate this promoter. Mechanistically, KLF14 represses the TGFβRII promoter via a co-repressor complex containing mSin3A and HDAC2. Furthermore, the TGFβ pathway activation leads to recruitment of a KLF14-mSin3A-HDAC2 repressor complex to the TGFβRII promoter, as well as the remodeling of chromatin to increase histone marks that associate with transcriptional silencing. Thus, these results describe a novel negative-feedback mechanism by which TGFβRII activation at the cell surface induces the expression of KLF14 to ultimately silence the TGFβRII and further expand the network of non-Smad transcription factors that participate in the TGFβ pathway.

Consequently, alterations in these pathways lead to severe malformations and diseases, including cancer. TGFβ is the best characterized pathway within this family of cytokines. Recent studies reveal, for instance, the existence of two types of membrane-to-nucleus TGFβ signaling mechanisms, namely the Smad-dependent and non-Smad protein-mediated cascades, although evidence of cross-talk between these two cascades is also emerging (4Moustakas A. Heldin C. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3573-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 9Ellenrieder V. Fernandez Zapico M. Urrutia R. Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol. 2001; 17: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore, even though our understanding of the complexity underlying TGFβ signaling continues to grow, classification into these two types of mechanisms has helped to organize the nascent theoretical framework for advancing this field of research by the integration of new findings into easily understandable paradigms. The canonical Smad-mediated TGFβ pathway is activated by binding of TGFβ1, -2, and/or -3 cytokines to the TGFβRII, which then dimerizes with and activates the TGFβ receptor I through serine phosphorylation of the regulatory GS-domain. The Type I receptor, in turn, phosphorylates receptor-bound Smad (Smad2/3) at the C-terminal SXS motif, releasing them from retention in the cytoplasm and allowing their translocation into the nucleus. Smad4 acts as a common partner of activated Smads to help execute their function. In this manner, TGFβ signaling is transduced through the cytoplasm into the nucleus to form complexes with distinct transcriptional regulators for specific gene promoters. The role of non-Smad protein-mediated pathways in the regulation of TGFβ signaling is also an active line of investigation. For instance, the Sp/KLF family of proteins is emerging as important non-Smad protein-mediated pathway cascades and, under certain circumstances, a cross-talk regulator with Smads to achieve distinct cellular functions. Sp1 is the founding member this expanding group of Sp/KLF proteins. The structure of these proteins is defined by the presence of three highly conserved and homologous C-terminal Cys2His2 zinc finger domains, which are responsible for DNA binding, and a variable N-terminal domain, which is responsible for transcriptional regulation (11Lomberk G. Urrutia R. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 12Black A.R. Black J.D. Azizkhan-Clifford J. J.

Sci. 1999; 24: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). However, the identification and characterization of this family of proteins has revealed that many bind to GC-rich target sequences similar, if not identical to, the “Sp1 sites” through which they can either activate or repress gene expression (11Lomberk G. Urrutia R. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 12Black A.R. Black J.D. Azizkhan-Clifford J. J.

Sci. 1999; 24: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Therefore, the discovery of repressors within this Sp/KLF family of transcriptional regulators has challenged the early paradigm that Sp1 activates all GC-rich sites. As a result, these Sp/KLF transcriptional repressors provide a novel mechanism for silencing a large number of genes that are already known to be activated by Sp1, particularly in response to TGFβ. TGFβRII has been previously shown to be activated by Sp1 (14Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29460-29468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, since these elegant studies were done, 24 Sp/KLF transcription factors have been discovered with some members acting as activators while others as repressors via the same type of GC-rich cis regulatory sequences used by Sp1. Thus, some Sp/KLF transcription factors are excellent candidates that may play a role in silencing of TGFβRII. Indeed, fortunately, in the current study, we describe, for the first time, the functional characterization of KLF14 as a novel non-Smad regulatory protein of the TGFβ pathway. Our results outline a novel, biochemically significant role for KLF14 in the silencing of the TGFβRII via Sp/KLF sites. This pathway provides a well characterized example of how Sp/KLF proteins are emerging as important non-Smad proteins that can directly regulate TGFβ signaling by regulating the expression of key molecules from this pathway. Cell Culture-Tissue culture reagents were purchased from commercial sources (Invitrogen). The human pancreatic epithelial cancer cell lines, PANC-1, ASPC-1, Capan-1, Capan-2, BxPC-3, L3.6, MiaPaCa-2, and CFPAC-1, were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained according to the supplier’s suggestions. All cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2. Plasmid Construction-Standard molecular biology techniques were used to clone KLF4, KLF5, KLF7, KLF9, KLF11, KLF14, and KLF15 into the pcDNA3.1/His (Invitrogen) and pCMVtag2 (Stratagene) vectors for expression as His-tagged or FLAG-tagged proteins, respectively, as well as the truncated (263 bp) TGFβRII promoter into the pGL3-Lux vector (Promega). The p3TP-Lux reporter plasmid containing TGFβ-responsive elements was kindly provided by Dr. Anita Roberts (National Institutes of Health) as a positive control for TGFβ1 stimulation experiments (data not shown). Full-length TGFβRII reporter was kindly provided by Dr. David Danielpour (Case Western). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR-Total RNA was extracted from cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions using an RNeasy Kit (Qiagen), and 5 μg was used for cDNA synthesis using oligo(dT) primer using the SuperScript™ III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer’s protocol. RT-PCR was performed using LA TaqDNA Polymerase with a GC Buffers kit (Takara) per the manufacturer protocols. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed with the primer sets provided in supplemental Table S1. Each experiment was done in triplicate. Amplification of four human housekeeping genes, GAPDH (Unigene Hs.544577), β2-microglobulin (B2M, Hs.709313), β2-Tubulin (TUBB2, Hs.300701), and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1, Hs.412707) was used for all samples as an internal control. Densitometric values were obtained and normalized to the average of the housekeeping cDNAs for each individual sample using Scion Image Beta 4.02 software (Scion Corp.). To represent the TGFβ inducibility of individual KLF transcripts, each TGFβ-treated sample was compared with an untreated control that was originally plated and ultimately collected at the same time to minimize compounding factors, which can often influence gene expression (i.e. cell cycle stage, cell density, potential unknown paracrine, and/or autocrine stimuli). At each time point, values were determined by first normalizing the TGFβ-treated sample (T, treated) to the average of the four aforementioned housekeeping genes in the same sample (TC, treated housekeeping gene control). This resultant value was divided by the corresponding untreated sample (UT, untreated) normalized in the same manner (UTC, untreated housekeeping gene control), to express the fold of TGFβ induction ([T/TC]/[UT/UTC] = fold TGFβ-induction). Another housekeeping gene, β-actin (ACTB, Hs.520640), was not used in our analyses, because it showed significant differences with TGFβ treatment over control values (data not shown). Western Blot-Total protein extracts were prepared by lysing cells in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cellular lysates were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and then separated proteins are transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking solution (Tris-buffered saline solution containing 5% nonfat dried milk and 0.1% Tween 20). Subsequently, membranes were incubated with specified primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) and exposed to x-ray film. An antibody against β2-actin (Sigma) was used as loading control. Transcriptional Reporter Assays-Cells were transfected with specified reporter constructs along with expression constructs and/or empty vector using electroporation (2 × 106 cells/0.4-cm microcuvette, 360 V, and 10 ms) and subsequently serum-starved overnight. Transfection was performed with equimolar concentrations of DNA, and expression was quantified with Western blotting directed against epitope-tagged proteins as described. Cells were stimulated with TGFβ1 (R&D Systems) as specified and assayed at various specified time points. At 24 or 48 h after transfection and treatment as noted, cells were lysed, and luciferase measurements were performed using a 20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs) according to manufacturer’s suggestions (Promega). Data were normalized as relative light units and normalized to the protein concentration as the mean ± S.D. All experiments were performed in triplicate at least three independent times. Immunoprecipitation-Cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged constructs. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were washed and lysed in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-FLAG M2 agarose-conjugated antibodies (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. To detect interaction with endogenous co-repressors, immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation, washed with lysis buffer, and analyzed by Western blot as described above using anti-mSin3a and HDAC2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation-ChIP assays were performed using the EZ-ChIP kit. The following primer set for the 263-bp TGFβRII promoter was used for PCR: 5′-GCA GAT GTT CTG ATC TAC TA-3′ (forward); 5′-AGC TGG GCA GGA CCT CTC TC-3′ (reverse) using TaKaRa LA Taq according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Mirus). Site-directed Mutagenesis-Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kits per the manufacturer’s protocol (Stratagene). All constructs were sequenced by the Mayo Clinic Molecular Biology Core Facility. GST Fusion-The KLF14 cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 191–323 corresponding to the DNA-binding zinc finger region was cloned into the GST fusion vector pGEX 5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences) using standard techniques. GST fusion protein expression was induced in BL21 cells (Stratagene) by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubation for 2 h. Cells were lysed and subsequently purified by using glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography as previously described (15Zhang J.S. Moncrieffe M.C. Kaczynski J. Ellenrieder V. Prendergast F.G. Urrutia R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Electromobility Shift Assay-Gel shift assays were performed as previously described (16Cook T. Gebelein B. Mesa K. Mladek A. Urrutia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25929-25936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.75 pmol of double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase and appropriate buffer (700 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm MgCl2, 50 mm dithiothreitol) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega). The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and halted with addition of TE plus EDTA (0.5 m EDTA, 1 m Tris, pH 8.0, H2O). Protein lysates included 0.5 μg of purified GST-KLF14/ZF fusion protein and in some experiments rhSP1 (Promega) at the indicated dilutions. A 5× ZnCl2 buffer was used in this reaction (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ZnCl2, 30% glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 250 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), H2O) for 10 min at room temperature. The γ-32P-labeled oligonucleotides were added for 20 min. In some cases, an excess of cold probe, at the indicated dilutions, was added concomitant with the addition of radiolabeled probe in addition to anti-Sp1 polyclonal rabbit antibody purchased from commercial sources (Millipore). The mixtures were electrophoresed in a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in a Hoeffer midi-gel using 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA for ∼4 h at 160 V. Gels were then transferred to blotting paper (Whatman 3MM), covered in plastic wrap, and vacuum dried for 1.5 h at 65 °C. Dried gels were then analyzed using a Storm Scanner 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Sp1 consensus and Sp1 mutant double-stranded oligonucleotides were obtained from commercial sources (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with the following sequences: Sp1 consensus, 5′-ATT CGA TCG GGG CGG GGC GAG C-3′ (forward); 5′-GCT CGC CCC GCC CCG ATC GAA T-3′ (reverse) and Sp1 mutant, 5′-ATT CGA TCG GTT CGG GGC GAG C-3′ (forward); 5′-GCT CGC CCC GAA CCG ATC GAA T-3′ (reverse). A Yet Undefined Sp/KLF Repressor Protein Plays a Role in Silencing of the Type II TGFβ-receptor Promoter-Previous studies have described the regulation of the TGFβRII by TGFβ ligands, primarily showing a bimodal response consisting of an Sp1-dependent up-regulation (14Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.J. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6239-6247PubMed Google Scholar) and a subsequent down-regulation of receptor transcript levels upon this stimulation (18Woodward T.L. Dumont N. O'Connor-McCourt M. Turner J.D. Philip A. J. Cell Physiol. 1995; 165: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Nishikawa Y. Wang M. Carr B.I. J.

Interestingly, although the activation of TGFβRII promoter, in particular by Sp1, has received precise attention, how this receptor is repressed remains poorly understood. Consequently, the major goal of the current study has been to characterize the role of a specific family of non-Smad proteins (Sp/KLF transcription factors), which may functionally explain the down-regulation TGFβRII through GC-rich Sp1-like sequences. Our studies began with examination of the transcriptional activity of the TGFβRII gene promoter in PANC1 epithelial cells, a widely used model for studying TGFβ signaling. We have performed an initial series of reporter assays using full-length TGFβRII and the previously described, TGFβ-sensitive, 263-bp core promoter, which is located 5′ of the transcriptional start site (14Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29460-29468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Treatment of PANC1 cells with exogenous TGFβ1 leads to a marked reduction in activity of the full-length TGFβRII reporter when compared with untreated control cells (Fig. 1A). This silencing effect is recapitulated in the 263-bp TGFβRII core promoter, suggesting that both the previously described activation pathway (14Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29460-29468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and the negative transcriptional regulatory mechanism characterized further here (Fig. 1A), are operational at this core promoter level. Using bioinformatics analyses (TRANSFAC Public), we have identified five putative Sp/KLF binding sites within this TGFβ-sensitive, 263-bp core promoter region (Fig. 1B). Four of these sites (#1–4) have been previously identified, although an additional site (#5) has not been previously reported (14Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29460-29468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21Jennings R. Alsarraj M. Wright K.L. Munoz-Antonia T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6899-6909Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Some of these previously identified sites have been shown to be activated by Sp1. However, whether novel Sp/KLF silencer proteins can also bind to this sequence to reverse the activation by Sp1 remained unknown. Therefore, this analysis has led us to the hypothesis that a yet undefined Sp/KLF repressor protein plays a role in the silencing of this promoter. Novel TGFβ-inducible Non-Smad, Sp/KLF Proteins Are Identified as Candidate Regulators of the Type II TGFβ-receptor- To test our hypothesis, we have developed a four-tier screening approach. This approach includes first, testing which of the 24 known Sp/KLF proteins are expressed in TGFβ-sensitive epithelial cells and, thus, can be considered initial candidates to target the TGFβRII promoter. Our experimental cell model, PANC1, a human epithelial cell line, is an optimal model for our studies, because they have adequate expression of TGFβRII mRNA and display growth inhibition to exogenous TGFβ1 stimulation (22Schneider D. Kleeff J. Berberat P.O. Zhu Z. Korc M. Friess H. Buchler M.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1588: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, as shown in Fig. 2A, each of the 24 known Sp/KLF transcription factors are consistently expressed in these cells, which made it ideal for performing a comprehensive screen. Second, we determine whether any Sp/KLF genes are TGFβ-inducible with a kinetic that is consistent with playing a role in the down-regulation of the TGFβRII. Third, by utilizing transfection studies combined with reporter assays, we test the potential of distinct members of this family to repress TGFβRII promoter activity and then, by electromobility shift assays, determine which sites on the promoter are utilized by our candidate KLF protein. Finally, we examine whether the repressor that is isolated according to these criteria binds to the endogenous TGFβRII gene and can remodel chromatin on this target, suggesting the bona fide target status of the candidate KLF protein. Thus, by applying this comprehensive screening, our study has been robust in evaluating the KLF protein family in the TGFβ response and regulation of the TGFβRII. The genomic axiom that functionally related genes follow a similar pattern of expression suggested that, hypothetically, the protein that represses the TGFβRII may be expressed in a similar manner after TGFβ treatment, in particular, during the repression response to this cytokine. Consequently, we have evaluated which, if any, of these Sp/KLF members are inducible by TGFβ1 treatment. Thus, using RNA from PANC1 cells either untreated or treated with TGFβ1, we have performed RT-PCR at various time points (Fig. 2B). As a positive control for TGFβ-mediated transcriptional induction, we monitor the expression of p21, a known TGFβ-inducible gene within the pathway. Of the 24 known Sp/KLF transcription factors, we have identified 7 that were markedly induced with exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, suggesting that these could be potential candidate transcriptional repressors of the TGFβRII promoter (Fig. 2B). These results are not only consistent with our previous work, which identified KLF11 as a TGFβ-inducible gene (16Cook T. Gebelein B. Mesa K. Mladek A. Urrutia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25929-25936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 23Subramaniam M. Harris S.A. Oursler M.J. Rasmussen K. Riggs B.L. Spelsberg T.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4907-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), but, more importantly, it characterizes previously unidentified KLF targets for this cascade, namely KLF4, -5, -7, -9, -14, and -15. Thus, based upon their expression patterns, these seven genes are good candidates to further investigate their regulation of the TGFβRII promoter. Subsequently, we have tested the transcriptional activity of these candidates on the TGFβRII promoter using reporter assays by co-transfecting the 263-bp core TGFβRII promoter-luciferase construct with cDNAs encoding each of the seven TGFβ-inducible KLF candidates. Out of these, five candidates induced a marked decrease in TGFβRII promoter activity, namely KLF4, -7, -11, -14, and -15 (Fig. 3A). KLF5 did not affect TGFβRII promoter activity above control levels, whereas KLF9 appeared to slightly activate this promoter, therefore these two proteins were not continued in subsequent experiments due to our objective of identifying TGFβRII repressors. To confirm whether this observed repression of TGFβRII promoter regulation is consistent with TGFβ pathway activation, these five proteins were further tested in PANC1 cells treated with exogenous TGFβ1 treatment. Interestingly, upon treatment, these KLF proteins were capable of further repressing TGFβRII promoter activity, with the largest repression achieved by KLF14 (Fig. 3B). These data also indicate that a second TGFβ-dependent mechanism, directly (signal-induced KLF expression or post-translational modifications) or indirectly (induction of another transcription factor), cooperates with KLF proteins to additionally repress this gene. Upon increasing concentrations of KLF14 cDNA in transfection studies, we found a concentration-dependent repression of the core TGFβRII promoter (Fig. 3C). Together, these results strongly identify KLF14 as a good candidate to be a regulator of TGFβRII promoter activity and expression. KLF14, a Novel Non-Smad Protein, Regulates the Type II TGFβ-receptor-The gene encoding KLF14 has been previously identified by our group and named BTEB5 due to its sequence similarities to members of this subfamily of KLF silencing proteins. 5Reported by J. Kaczynski and R. Urrutia to NCBI, 2002. Although, recently, genetic studies have reported the genomic structure, intronless nature, and potential imprinted status of this gene (24Parker-Katiraee L. Carson A.R. Yamada T. Arnaud P. Feil R. Abu-Amero S.N. Moore G.E. Kaneda M. Perry G.H. Stone A.C. Lee C. Meguro-Horike M. Sasaki H. Kobayashi K. Nakabayashi K. Scherer S.W. PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: 665-678Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), a functional characterization of this protein at the cellular and biochemical level has never been performed. Because our data indicate that KLF14 appears to be a potent regulator of the TGFβRII in promoter assays combined with this existing gap in knowledge on this KLF family member and its targets, the choice to further investigate the role of this particular KLF in TGFβRII regulation would significantly expand the current knowledge on the functional properties of members of this family. Noteworthy, we have validated these in vitro reporter results in vivo by assessing whether this protein has a regulatory effect on endogenous TGFβRII levels in PANC1 cells. Initial correlative experiments demonstrate that the levels of TGFβRII mRNA levels decrease at a time in which the amount of KLF14 increases (repression phase of the bimodal expression pattern of TGFβRII in response to TGFβ), raising the possibility that KLF14 is induced to subsequently down-regulate the TGFβRII (Fig. 4A). To mechanistically support this correlation, we have performed RT-PCR on cells overexpressing KLF14 to determine TGFβRII levels in comparison to mock transfected cells in the presence or absence of exogenous TGFβ1 stimulation (Fig. 4B). KLF14 overexpression alone is sufficient to decrease TGFβRII mRNA, interestingly to the same extent as TGFβ1 stimulation alone. Furthermore, subsequent TGFβ1 treatment in cells transfected with KLF14 leads to further down-regulation of TGFβRII transcripts. Because KLF14 is a TGFβ-inducible gene, the further decrease in TGFβRII mRNA levels observed upon TGFβ1 treatment likely results from the induction of endogenous Sp/KLF transcription factors by this cytokine. These results suggest that TGFβ down-regulates TGFβRII transcripts through KLF14 expression with subsequent negative regulation of promoter activity. Next, we have tested whether the effect of KLF14 on TGFβRII expression interfered with TGFβ-induced signals that target downstream genes, su"

We aimed to study the development of gut barrier loss in patients undergoing major non-abdominal surgery. Methodology/Principal Findings Twenty consecutive children undergoing spinal fusion surgery were included. This kind of surgery is characterized by long operation time, significant blood loss, prolonged systemic hypotension, without directly leading to compromise of the intestines by intestinal manipulation or use of extracorporeal circulation. Blood was collected preoperatively, every two hours during surgery and 2, 4, 15 and 24 hours postoperatively. Gut mucosal barrier was assessed by plasma markers for enterocyte damage (I-FABP, I-BABP) and urinary presence of tight junction protein claudin-3. Intestinal mucosal perfusion was measured by gastric tonometry (PrCO2, Pr-aCO2-gap). Plasma concentration of I-FABP, I-BABP and urinary expression of claudin-3 increased rapidly and significantly after the onset of surgery in most children. Postoperatively, all markers decreased promptly towards baseline values together with normalisation of MAP. Plasma levels of I-FABP, I-BABP were significantly negatively correlated with MAP at ½ hour before blood sampling (−0.726 (p<0.001), −0.483 (P<0.001), respectively). Furthermore, circulating I-FABP correlated with gastric mucosal PrCO2, Pr-aCO2-gap measured at the same time points (0.553 (p = 0.040), 0.585 (p = 0.028), respectively). Conclusions/Significance This study shows the development of gut barrier loss in children undergoing major non-abdominal surgery, which is related to preceding hypotension and mesenterial hypoperfusion. These data shed new light on the potential role of peroperative circulatory perturbation and intestinal barrier loss."
https://openalex.org/W2024032081,"Hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumors, and the extent of tumor hypoxia correlates with advanced disease stages and treatment resistance. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) represents an important tumor-selective molecular target for anticancer drug discovery directed at tumor hypoxia. A natural product chemistry-based approach was employed to discover small molecule inhibitors of HIF-1. Bioassay-guided isolation of an active lipid extract of the tropical legumaceous plant Lonchocarpus glabrescens and structure elucidation afforded two new HIF-1 inhibitors: alpinumisoflavone (compound 1) and 4′-O-methylalpinumisoflavone (compound 2). In human breast tumor T47D cells, compounds 1 and 2 inhibited hypoxia-induced HIF-1 activation with IC50 values of 5 and 0.6 μm, respectively. At the concentrations that in hibited HIF-1 activation, compound 2 inhibited hypoxic induction of HIF-1 target genes (CDKN1A, GLUT-1, and VEGF), tumor angiogenesis in vitro, cell migration, and chemotaxis. Compound 2 inhibits HIF-1 activation by blocking the induction of nuclear HIF-1α protein, the oxygen-regulated subunit that controls HIF-1 activity. Mechanistic studies indicate that, unlike rotenone and other mitochondrial inhibitors, compound 2 represents the first small molecule that inhibits HIF-1 activation by simultaneously suppressing mitochondrial respiration and disrupting protein translation in vitro. This unique mechanism distinguishes compound 2 from other small molecule HIF-1 inhibitors that are simple mitochondrial inhibitors or flavanoid-based protein kinase inhibitors.

At the concentrations that in hibited HIF-1 activation, compound 2 inhibited hypoxic induction of HIF-1 target genes (CDKN1A, GLUT-1, and VEGF), tumor angiogenesis in vitro, cell migration, and chemotaxis. Compound 2 inhibits HIF-1 activation by blocking the induction of nuclear HIF-1α protein, the oxygen-regulated subunit that controls HIF-1 activity. Mechanistic studies indicate that, unlike rotenone and other mitochondrial inhibitors, compound 2 represents the first small molecule that inhibits HIF-1 activation by simultaneously suppressing mitochondrial respiration and disrupting protein translation in vitro. This unique mechanism distinguishes compound 2 from other small molecule HIF-1 inhibitors that are simple mitochondrial inhibitors or flavanoid-based protein kinase inhibitors. Hypoxia (reduced oxygen tension) arises when the existing tumor blood vessels fail to meet the oxygen demand of the rapidly growing tumor cells. To compensate for this decrease in oxygen supply, hypoxic tumor cells activate the expression of genes that range in function from those that promote anaerobic metabolism to those that initiate tumor angiogenesis (1Harris A.L.

This leads to sluggish and irregular blood flow. As a result, certain regions of tumors are under constant hypoxic stress (3Tatum J.L. Kelloff G.J. Gillies R.J. Arbeit J.M. Brown J.M. Chao K.S.

Oncol. 1998; 8: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Hypoxic tumor cells that have adapted to an environment low in oxygen and nutrients are more aggressive and resistant to treatment (5Graeber T.G. Osmanian C. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Koch C.J. Lowe S.W. Giaccia A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). In clinical settings, the extent of tumor hypoxia correlates with advanced disease stages, poor prognosis, and treatment resistance (3Tatum J.L. Kelloff G.J. Gillies R.J. Arbeit J.M. Brown J.M.

Currently, there is no approved drug that specifically targets hypoxic tumor cells. It is clear that tumor hypoxia is an important unmet therapeutic need and deserves considerable drug discovery efforts. One major molecular target for hypoxia-selective anticancer drug discovery is the transcription factor HIF-1. 3The abbreviations used are: HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1; ETC, electron transport chain; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration; ROS, reactive oxygen species; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ANOVA, analysis of variance; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MTT, methylthiazoyldiphenyltetrazolium bromide. Semenza and Wang (6Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar) first described HIF-1 as the transcriptional activator responsible for the hypoxic induction of erythropoietin. Functioning as a key regulator of oxygen homeostasis, HIF-1 is a heterodimer of the basic helix-loop-helix PER-ARNT-Sim proteins HIF-1α and HIF-1β/ARNT (7Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). In general, HIF-1α protein is degraded rapidly under normoxic conditions by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and is stabilized under hypoxic conditions, whereas HIF-1β protein is constitutively expressed (8Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4176) Google Scholar). Upon activation, HIF-1 binds to the hypoxia-response element in the promoters of target genes and activates transcription. The classical oxygen-dependent post-translational regulation of HIF-1α protein includes prolyl hydroxylation-dependent proteasome degradation and asparaginyl hydroxylation-associated inactivation (9Ivan M.

Over sixteen years of research has revealed the important role in cancer biology that HIF-1 plays by regulating the expression of genes involved in processes such as immortalization, genetic instability, dedifferentiation and stem cell maintenance, tumor angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming, survival and resistance to apoptosis, migration/invasion and metastasis, and treatment resistance (14Semenza G.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (5367) Google Scholar, 15Semenza G.L. Drug Discov. Today. 2007; 12: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In general, HIF-1 activation promotes hypoxic adaptation and survival by increasing oxygen delivery, decreasing oxygen consumption, expressing growth factors for autocrine signaling, suppressing cell death, and promoting metastasis (14Semenza G.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (5367) Google Scholar, 15Semenza G.L. Drug Discov. Today. 2007; 12: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Clinical studies indicate that HIF-1α protein expression correlates with advanced disease stages, metastasis, treatment resistance, and poor prognosis in cancer patients (16Zhong H. de Marzo A.M.

In animal models, HIF-1 inhibition reduced tumor vascularity and retarded tumor growth (19Ryan H.E. Poloni M. McNulty W. Elson D. Gassmann M. Arbeit J.M. Johnson R.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4010-4015PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kung A.L. Zabludoff S.D. France D.S. Freedman S.J. Tanner E.A. Vieira A. Cornell-Kennon S. Lee J. Wang B. Wang J. Memmert K. Naegeli H.U.

When HIF-1 inhibition was combined with chemotherapy or radiation, enhanced treatment outcomes were observed in preclinical models (21Unruh A. Ressel A. Mohamed H.G. Johnson R.S. Nadrowitz R.

Thus, small molecule HIF-1 inhibitors represent potential drug leads that will suppress tumor growth and enhance chemotherapy/radiation by inhibiting hypoxia-induced gene expression. Most laboratories use a pure compound library-based screening approach for the discovery of small molecule HIF-1 inhibitors. Representative HIF-1 inhibitors discovered include the following: topotecan, which is an approved drug (23Rapisarda A. Uranchimeg B. Scudiero D.A. Selby M. Sausville E.A. Shoemaker R.H. Melillo G.

In addition to these HIF-1 inhibitors identified through screening efforts, a number of anticancer agents have also been shown to suppress HIF-1 activation (15Semenza G.L. Drug Discov. Today. 2007; 12: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Using a natural product chemistry-based approach, we have discovered chemically diverse HIF-1 inhibitors such as manassantins that function at nanomolar concentrations with a wide window between their HIF-1 inhibitory activity and cytotoxicity (29Hodges T.W.

This study describes the discovery and characterization of HIF-1 inhibitors from the plant Lonchocarpus glabrescens. Plant Material, Extraction, and Isolation—The plant material (L. glabrescens) was collected by Dr. Sidney McDaniel from Punchana, Peru, on August 8, 1991. Voucher specimen (IBE 31253) is stored at the National Center for Natural Products Research repository, University of Mississippi, University, MS. Powdered plant material (NP 9179) was extracted with ethanol. Chromatographic separation of the active extract and isolation of the active compounds were performed using standard methods. The NMR spectra of 1-3 match those previously published (31Jackson B. Owen P.J. Scheinmann F. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1971; 20: 3389-3392PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Cell-based Reporter Assay—Human breast tumor T47D and MDA-MB-231, prostate tumor PC-3, and DU-145 cell lines (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM/F-12 media with l-glutamine (Mediatech), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (BioWhittaker). To monitor HIF-1 activity, a T47D cell-based luciferase assay employing the pHRE3-TK-Luc reporter was performed as described (29Hodges T.W. Hossain C.F. Kim Y.P. Zhou Y.D. Nagle D.G. J. Nat. Prod. (Lloydia). 2004; 67: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A similar cell-based luciferase reporter assay was conducted with a control construct (pGL3-Control, Promega). Compounds were prepared as stock solutions in DMSO and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. The final concentration of DMSO is less than 0.5% (v/v) in all assays. RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—The plating of T47D cells, compound treatment, extraction of total RNA samples, synthesis of the first strand cDNAs, gene-specific primer sequences, quantitative real time PCRs, and data analysis were described previously (30Hossain C.F. Kim Y.P. Baerson S.R. Zhang L. Bruick R.K. Mohammed K.A. Agarwal A.K. Nagle D.G. Zhou Y.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 1026-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). ELISA for Human VEGF Protein—The plating of T47D cells, compound treatment, and ELISA for secreted and cellular VEGF proteins were the same as those described previously (29Hodges T.W. Hossain C.F. Kim Y.P. Zhou Y.D. Nagle D.G. J. Nat. Prod. (Lloydia). 2004; 67: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the cellular lysate was determined using a micro BCA assay (Pierce), and the amount of VEGF protein was normalized to that of proteins in the cellular lysate. HUVEC Cell Tube Formation Assay—HUVEC cells (Lonza) were maintained in endothelial cell basal medium (EBM-2, Lonza) supplemented with 5% (v/v) FBS (Hyclone) and endothelial cell growth supplement (SingleQuots, Lonza). Only cells within six passages were used. To collect conditioned media (CM) samples, T47D cells were plated at the density of 106 cells/well (6-well plate, Cellstar) in a volume of 2 ml of DMEM/F-12 media supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics, incubated overnight, and exposed to compounds under normoxic (95% air) and hypoxic conditions (1% O2) for 24 h; the CM were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant samples were stored at -80 °C. For the in vitro tube formation assay, 60,000 HUVEC cells/well were added to a Matrigel (BD Biosciences)-coated 24-well plate (Cellbind, Corning Inc.). The cells were added in a volume of 1 ml of EBM-2 media as a negative control and EBM-2 media supplemented with 20 ng of recombinant human VEGF protein (R & D Systems) as a positive control. For the rest, HUVEC cells were added in a mixture of EBM-2 (800 μl) and T47D cell-conditioned media (200 μl, thawed on ice). The incubation was continued for another 18 h at 37 °C. The HUVEC cells/tubes were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with cold methanol for 10 s, and stained with Diff-Quik II (Dade Behring). Three random fields of each sample were photographed under an Axiovert 40 CFL microscope (Zeiss). Both the tube length and the number of branching points were quantified using Adobe Photoshop. The tube length measurements were presented as percentage of the normoxic control. MDA-MB-231 Cell-based Wound Healing and Chemotaxis Assays—MDA-MB-231 cells were plated at the density of 106 cells/well into 12-well plates (Corning Inc.). After 24 h, three parallel wounds were created inside each well by scratching the layer of confluent MDA-MB-231 cells with a 200-μl pipette tip at a 90° angle. The cells were washed twice with a serum-free medium, and a fresh DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) FBS (Hyclone), penicillin/streptomycin, and each specific test compound was added. Following a short incubation (30 min at 37 °C), the exposure was extended for another 22-24 h under specified oxygen conditions (normoxia, 95% air, 5% CO2; hypoxia, 1% O2, 94% N2, 5% CO2). When the wound healed in the control wells, the cells were fixed with methanol and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The wounds were photographed under a Zeiss Axiovert 40 microscope. The migration of MDA-MB-231 cells toward fetal bovine serum was measured using a QCM™ 24-well cell migration assay kit (Chemicon International). Serum-starved MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded at the density of 105 cells per insert (8.0 μm pore size) in a volume of 300 μl serum-free DMEM/F12 media with antibiotics. The inserts were placed into a 24-well plate with 500 μl of 10% FBS media with antibiotics per well. Compounds were added to both the insert and the lower chamber, and the cells were exposed to specified oxygen conditions for 24 h. Cell detachment, lysis, and labeling with the CyQuant GR fluorescent dye were performed following the manufacturer's instruction. Fluorescence was measured on a BioTech Synergy Plate Reader with excitation at 480 nm and emission at 520 nm. The number of cells was calculated from a standard curve. Nuclear Extract Preparation and Western Blot Analysis—Plating of T47D cells, compound treatment, and exposure to hypoxic conditions were described (29Hodges T.W. Hossain C.F. Kim Y.P. Zhou Y.D. Nagle D.G. J. Nat. Prod. (Lloydia). 2004; 67: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Nuclear extract samples were prepared using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (Pierce), and the protein concentration was determined using a Micro BCA assay kit (Pierce). Each sample (60 μg) was separated by electrophoresis on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) using a Bio-Rad semi-dry blotter. The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat milk (Bio-Rad) in TTBS (20 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) at 4 °C overnight and incubated with specified primary antibodies in TTBS with 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. Both monoclonal anti-HIF-1α antibody (1:500) and monoclonal anti-HIF-1β antibody (1:1000) were from BD Biosciences. The secondary antibody (ECL™-horseradish peroxidase-linked sheep anti-mouse IgG, Amersham Biosciences) was used at 1:30,000. The blot was developed with the Super-Signal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce). In Vitro Translation—Coupled in vitro transcription/translation of the luciferase T7 control DNA construct (Promega) was performed in a final volume of 12.5 μl using the TnT® T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Compounds were added before addition of the lysate. One-fifth of the reaction mix was used for luciferase activity determination (Luciferase assay system, Promega). Mitochondria Respiration Assay—To determine the effect of each isolated compound on cell respiration, 5 × 106 T47D cells (equilibrated to 30 °C) were added to the chamber of an Oxytherm Clark-type electrode system (Hansatech) containing 1 ml of DMEM/F-12 medium (JRH) free of serum and antibiotics. Glucose (17.5 mm) in the DMEM/F-12 media served as the metabolic substrate. Once base-line respiration had been established (for a 15-min interval), compounds dissolved in DMSO were injected into the chamber at 3-min intervals using a 100-μl syringe (Hamilton). For mechanistic studies, the plasma membrane was selectively permeabilized with digitonin (30 μm) so that the substrates available to the mitochondria could be manipulated. This required the use of a mitochondrial buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 120 mm KCl, 2 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.3% bovine serum albumin (fat-free) in place of the DMEM/F-12 medium. The buffer was supplemented with the following substrates that provide electrons to different sites within the mitochondrial respiratory chain: 5 mm sodium pyruvate and 5 mm sodium malate (complex I), 5 mm sodium succinate dibasic hexahydrate (complex II), and 5 mm l-ascorbic acid plus 0.2 mm N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (complex IV). Known complex I and III inhibitors, rotenone and antimycin A, respectively, were added from EtOH stock solutions to a final concentrations of 1 μm where indicated. All the chemicals were from Sigma, and the final concentration of solvent was less than 0.1% (v/v). Cell Viability Assays—The plating of cells, compound treatment, and exposure to hypoxic conditions were similar to those described in the earlier sections. For the 6-day exposure study, the conditioned media were replaced by fresh culture medium that contained test compound after 3 days. Following a 2- or 6-day incubation period, cell viability was determined by one of the following methods as appropriate. For the MTT assay, the conditioned media were replaced with a fresh DMEM/F-12 medium that contains 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, and MTT (0.5 mg/ml). After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the media were removed, and the cells were lysed with isopropyl alcohol that contains 0.04 n HCl. Absorbance at 570 nm was measured on a BioTek Synergy plate reader with background absorbance at 690 nm. For direct cell number counting, cells plated in 12-well plates were trypsinized, the plates kept on ice, and the cell numbers counted using a hemocytometer. Statistical Analysis—Data were compared using one-way ANOVA and Bonfferoni post hoc analyses (GraphPad Prism 4). Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. Alpinumisoflavone (1) and 4′-O-Methylalpinumisoflavone (2) Inhibit HIF-1 Activation in T47D Cells—Over 15,000 natural product-rich extracts from plants, marine invertebrates, algae, and microorganisms were evaluated in a T47D human breast tumor cell-based reporter assay for HIF-1 inhibitory activity (29Hodges T.W. Hossain C.F. Kim Y.P. Zhou Y.D. Nagle D.G. J. Nat. Prod. (Lloydia). 2004; 67: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The lipid extract from the plant L. glabrescens Benth (Facaceae) inhibited hypoxia (1% O2)-induced HIF-1 activation by 90% at the concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. Bioassay-guided chromatographic separation of the active extract yielded two new HIF-1 inhibitors. The HIF-1 inhibitors isolated were determined to be alpinumisoflavone (1) and 4′-O-methylalpinumisoflavone (2) (Fig. 1A) by direct comparison of the spectroscopic data with previously published values (31Jackson B. Owen P.J. Scheinmann F. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1971; 20: 3389-3392PubMed Google Scholar). A concentration-response study was performed in T47D cells to determine the effects of compounds 1 and 2 on HIF-1 activation using cell-based reporter assays (Fig. 1B). Rotenone (3), a structurally similar compound from the same plant, was used as a control that is believed to inhibit hypoxia-induced HIF-1 activation by blocking the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) (32Chandel N.S. Maltepe E. Goldwasser E. Mathieu C.E. Simon M.C. Schumacker P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11715-11720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). Unlike compound 3, compounds 1 and 2 inhibited both hypoxia-induced (1% O2) and iron chelator-induced HIF-1 activation with comparable low micromolar IC50 values (Fig. 1, B and D). Expression of luciferase from a control construct (pGL3-Control) was only modestly suppressed by compounds 1 and 2 (IC50 >10 μm, data not shown). Compound 3 only inhibited hypoxia (1% O2)-induced HIF-1 activation (IC50 0.001 μm) and had little effect on iron chelator (10 μm 1,10-phenanthroline)-induced HIF-1 activation (IC50 >0.1 μm) (Fig. 1, C and D). The observation that compound 2 is eight times more potent than 1 at inhibiting hypoxia-induced HIF-1 activation suggests that the 4′-O-methyl substituent contributes to the enhanced activity. A similar difference in relative potency was observed between 1 and 2 in their abilities to inhibit 1,10-phenanthroline-induced HIF-1 activation (2 was five times more potent than 1). Because 1 and 2 differ by only one methyl group and 2 was significantly more potent, the subsequent studies were mainly performed with 2. The effects of 2 and 3 on the expression of HIF-1 target genes CDKN1A (Fig. 2A), GLUT-1 (Fig. 2B), and VEGF (Fig. 2C) were examined in T47D cells by real time RT-PCR. At the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value determined in the T47D cell-based reporter assay, compound 2 (10 μm) blocked the hypoxic (1% O2) induction of all three HIF-1 target genes at the mRNA level, but exerted only modest effects (15-24% inhibition) on target gene induction by 1,10-phenanthroline (10 μm). One explanation for the reduced ability of compound 2 to inhibit 1,10-phenanthroline-induced HIF-1 target gene expression is that higher concentrations are required to inhibit HIF-1 target gene expression than those to inhibit HIF-1 activation in the reporter-based assay. Compound 3 inhibited hypoxic induction of all three genes (complete inhibition for CDKN1A, 63% for GLUT-1, and 81% for VEGF) at concentrations as low as 10 nm (MIC value to inhibit HIF-1 activation by hypoxia in the reporter assay). In sharp contrast to its effect on hypoxia-induced HIF-1 activation, compound 3 only modestly inhibited the induction of all three genes by 1,10-phenanthroline (30-40% inhibition) even at a concentration of 100 nm. The relatively hypoxia-selective inhibitory effects of 3 on HIF-1 target gene induction at the mRNA level mirror the results observed in the T47D cell-based reporter assay. 4′-O-Methylalpinumisoflavone (2) and Rotenone (3) Inhibit Hypoxic Induction of VEGF Protein and Tumor Angiogenesis in Vitro—One of the survival mechanisms employed by hypoxic tumor cells is to increase the production of angiogenic factors such as VEGF, which serves as a trigger to initiate the process of tumor angiogenesis. To test whether 2 and 3 can inhibit hypoxic induction of VEGF protein, the levels of both cellular (Fig. 3A) and secreted (Fig. 3B) VEGF proteins were measured. In T47D cells, hypoxic exposure significantly increases the levels of both cellular and secreted VEGF proteins. Compound 2 (10 μm) completely blocked the hypoxic induction of both cellular and secreted VEGF proteins (p > 0.05, when the hypoxia plus compound 2 treatment was compared with the normoxic control using ANOVA and Bonferroni's post test, GraphPad Prism). Compound 3 inhibited hypoxic induction of cellular and secreted VEGF proteins at the concentration of 100 nm. Neither 2 nor 3 inhibited the induction of VEGF proteins by 1,10-phenanthroline (10 μm, chemical hypoxia). The less active compound 1 did not inhibit the induction of VEGF proteins in T47D cells when tested at 10 μm (data not shown). These results parallel the results observed in the T47D cell-based reporter assay. To investigate if the inhibition of VEGF protein production correlates with the inhibition of tumor an"
https://openalex.org/W2001199134,"APOBEC3G (A3G) and related cytidine deaminases of the APOBEC3 family of proteins are potent inhibitors of many retroviruses, including HIV-1. Formation of infectious HIV-1 requires the suppression of multiple cytidine deaminases by Vif. HIV-1 Vif suppresses various APOBEC3 proteins through the common mechanism of recruiting the Cullin5-ElonginB-ElonginC E3 ubiquitin ligase to induce target protein polyubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. The domains in Vif and various APOBEC3 proteins required for APOBEC3 recognition and degradation have not been fully characterized.In the present study, we have demonstrated that the regions of APOBEC3F (A3F) that are required for its HIV-1-mediated binding and degradation are distinct from those reported for A3G. We found that the C-terminal cytidine deaminase domain (C-CDD) of A3F alone is sufficient for its interaction with HIV-1 Vif and its Vif-mediated degradation. We also observed that the domains of HIV-1 Vif that are uniquely required for its functional interaction with full-length A3F are also required for the degradation of the C-CDD of A3F; in contrast, those Vif domains that are uniquely required for functional interaction with A3G are not required for the degradation of the C-CDD of A3F. Interestingly, the HIV-1 Vif domains required for the degradation of A3F are also required for the degradation of A3C and A3DE. On the other hand, the Vif domains uniquely required for the degradation of A3G are dispensable for the degradation of cytidine deaminases A3C and A3DE.Our data suggest that distinct regions of A3F and A3G are targeted by HIV-1 Vif molecules. However, HIV-1 Vif suppresses A3F, A3C, and A3DE through similar recognition determinants, which are conserved among Vif molecules from diverse HIV-1 strains. Mapping these determinants may be useful for the design of novel anti-HIV inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2017170729,"Water masers are found in dense molecular clouds closely associated with supermassive black holes at the centres of active galaxies. On the basis of the understanding of the local water-maser luminosity function, it was expected that masers at intermediate and high redshifts would be extremely rare. However, galaxies at redshifts z > 2 might be quite different from those found locally, not least because of more frequent mergers and interaction events. Here we use gravitational lensing to search for masers at higher redshifts than would otherwise be possible, and find a water maser at redshift 2.64 in the dust- and gas-rich, gravitationally lensed type-1 quasar MG J0414+0534 (refs 6-13). The isotropic luminosity is 10,000 (, solar luminosity), which is twice that of the most powerful local water maser and half that of the most distant maser previously known. Using the locally determined luminosity function, the probability of finding a maser this luminous associated with any single active galaxy is 10(-6). The fact that we see such a maser in the first galaxy we observe must mean that the volume densities and luminosities of masers are higher at redshift 2.64."
https://openalex.org/W2074091876,"Cortical neurons in vitro and in vivo fluctuate spontaneously between two stable membrane potentials: a depolarized UP state and a hyperpolarized DOWN state. UP states temporally correspond with multineuronal firing sequences which may be important for information processing. To examine how thalamic inputs interact with ongoing cortical UP state activity, we used calcium imaging and targeted whole-cell recordings of activated neurons in thalamocortical slices of mouse somatosensory cortex. Whereas thalamic stimulation during DOWN states generated multineuronal, synchronized UP states, identical stimulation during UP states had no effect on the subthreshold membrane dynamics of the vast majority of cells or on ongoing multineuronal temporal patterns. Both thalamocortical and corticocortical PSPs were significantly reduced and neuronal input resistance was significantly decreased during cortical UP states – mechanistically consistent with UP state insensitivity. Our results demonstrate that cortical dynamics during UP states are insensitive to thalamic inputs."
https://openalex.org/W2030273291,"The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors (also called statins) exert proven beneficial effects on cardiovascular diseases. Recent data suggest a protective role for Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-beta) in atherosclerosis by regulating the balance between inflammation and extracellular matrix accumulation. However, there are no studies about the effect of statins on TGF-beta/Smad pathway in atherosclerosis and vascular cells.In cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) statins enhanced Smad pathway activation caused by TGF-beta. In addition, statins upregulated TGF-beta receptor type II (TRII), and increased TGF-beta synthesis and TGF-beta/Smad-dependent actions. In this sense, statins, through Smad activation, render VSMCs more susceptible to TGF-beta induced apoptosis and increased TGF-beta-mediated ECM production. It is well documented that high doses of statins induce apoptosis in cultured VSMC in the presence of serum; however the precise mechanism of this effect remains to be elucidated. We have found that statins-induced apoptosis was mediated by TGF-beta/Smad pathway. Finally, we have described that RhoA inhibition is a common intracellular mechanisms involved in statins effects. The in vivo relevance of these findings was assessed in an experimental model of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E deficient mice: Treatment with Atorvastatin increased Smad3 phosphorylation and TRII overexpression, associated to elevated ECM deposition in the VSMCs within atheroma plaques, while apoptosis was not detected.Statins enhance TGF-beta/Smad pathway, regulating ligand levels, receptor, main signaling pathway and cellular responses of VSMC, including apoptosis and ECM accumulation. Our findings show that TGF-beta/Smad pathway is essential for statins-dependent actions in VSMCs."
https://openalex.org/W2155929657,"The genetic basis of myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1) is the expansion of a CTG tract located in the 3' untranslated region of DMPK. Expression of mutant RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats plays a central role in the development of cardiac disease in DM1. Expanded CUG tracts form both nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates, yet the relative significance of such aggregates in eliciting DM1 pathology is unclear. To test the pathophysiology of CUG repeat encoding RNAs, we developed and analyzed mice with cardiac-specific expression of a beta-galactosidase cassette in which a (CTG)(400) repeat tract was positioned 3' of the termination codon and 5' of the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal. In these animals CUG aggregates form exclusively in the cytoplasm of cardiac cells. A key pathological consequence of expanded CUG repeat RNA expression in DM1 is aberrant RNA splicing. Abnormal splicing results from the functional inactivation of MBNL1, which is hypothesized to occur due to MBNL1 sequestration in CUG foci or from elevated levels of CUG-BP1. We therefore tested the ability of cytoplasmic CUG foci to elicit these changes. Aggregation of CUG RNAs within the cytoplasm results both in Mbnl1 sequestration and in approximately a two fold increase in both nuclear and cytoplasmic Cug-bp1 levels. Significantly, despite these changes RNA splice defects were not observed and functional analysis revealed only subtle cardiac dysfunction, characterized by conduction defects that primarily manifest under anesthesia. Using a human myoblast culture system we show that this transgene, when expressed at similar levels to a second transgene, which encodes expanded CTG tracts and facilitates both nuclear focus formation and aberrant splicing, does not elicit aberrant splicing. Thus the lack of toxicity of cytoplasmic CUG foci does not appear to be a consequence of low expression levels. Our results therefore demonstrate that the cellular location of CUG RNA aggregates is an important variable that influences toxicity and support the hypothesis that small molecules that increase the rate of transport of the mutant DMPK RNA from the nucleus into the cytoplasm may significantly improve DM1 pathology."
https://openalex.org/W1986721721,"Activating mutations in FGFR3 tyrosine kinase cause several forms of human skeletal dysplasia. Although the mechanisms of FGFR3 action in cartilage are not completely understood, it is believed that the STAT1 transcription factor plays a central role in pathogenic FGFR3 signaling. Here, we analyzed STAT1 activation by the N540K, G380R, R248C, Y373C, K650M and K650E-FGFR3 mutants associated with skeletal dysplasias. In a cell-free kinase assay, only K650M and K650E-FGFR3 caused activatory STAT1(Y701) phosphorylation. Similarly, in RCS chondrocytes, HeLa, and 293T cellular environments, only K650M and K650E-FGFR3 caused strong STAT1 activation. Other FGFR3 mutants caused weak (HeLa) or no activation (293T and RCS). This contrasted with ERK MAP kinase activation, which was strongly induced by all six mutants and correlated with the inhibition of proliferation in RCS chondrocytes. Thus the ability to activate STAT1 appears restricted to the K650M and K650E-FGFR3 mutants, which however account for only a small minority of the FGFR3-related skeletal dysplasia cases. Other pathways such as ERK should therefore be considered as central to pathological FGFR3 signaling in cartilage."
https://openalex.org/W2023565219,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) participates in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, including asthma, in which it enhances airway hypersensitivity and tissue eosinophilia. Herein, we investigated the role of MIF in eosinophilopoiesis and tissue eosinophilia using Schistosoma mansoni infection. MIF-deficient (Mif(-/-)) mice had similar numbers of adult worms, eggs, and granulomas compared to wild-type mice, but the size of granulomas was strikingly reduced due to smaller numbers of eosinophils. MIF did not affect the acquired response to infection, as Mif(-/-) mice produced normal amounts of Th2 cytokines and IgE. Nevertheless, recombinant MIF (rMIF) behaved as a chemoattractant for eosinophils, what could partially explain the reduced eosinophilia in infected Mif(-/-) mice. Moreover, the percentage of eosinophils was reduced in bone marrows of Mif(-/-) mice chronically infected with S. mansoni compared to wild type. Mif(-/-) had impaired eosinophilopoiesis in response to interleukin (IL)-5 and addition of rMIF to bone marrow cultures from IL-5 transgenic mice enhanced the generation of eosinophils. In the absence of MIF, eosinophil precursors were unable to survive the IL-5-supplemented cell culture, and were ingested by macrophages. Treatment with pancaspase inhibitor z-VAD or rMIF promoted the survival of eosinophil progenitors. Together, these results indicate that MIF participates in IL-5-driven maturation of eosinophils and in tissue eosinophilia associated with S. mansoni infection."

Here we examine the DNA unwinding activity of monomeric NS3. Oligomerization was measured by preparing a fluorescently labeled form of NS3, which was titrated with unlabeled NS3, resulting in a hyperbolic increase in fluorescence anisotropy and providing an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of 236 nm. To evaluate the DNA binding activity of individual subunits within NS3 oligomers, two oligonucleotides were labeled with fluorescent donor or acceptor molecules and then titrated with NS3. Upon the addition of increasing concentrations of NS3, fluorescence energy transfer was observed, which reached a plateau at a 1:1 ratio of NS3 to oligonucleotides, indicating that each subunit within the oligomeric form of NS3 binds to DNA. DNA unwinding was measured under multiple turnover conditions with increasing concentrations of NS3; however, no increase in specific activity was observed, even at enzyme concentrations greater than the apparent dissociation constant for oligomerization. An ATPase-deficient form of NS3, NS3(D290A), was prepared to explore the functional consequences of oligomerization. Under single turnover conditions in the presence of excess concentration of NS3 relative to DNA, NS3(D290A) exhibited a dominant negative effect. However, under multiple turnover conditions in which DNA concentration was in excess to enzyme concentration, NS3(D290A) did not exhibit a dominant negative effect.

These enzymes catalyze unwinding of double-stranded DNA or RNA by converting chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical energy for nucleic acid strand separation. However, there is considerable variability in the quaternary structure of the active forms of helicases. Some helicases function effectively in unwinding activities as monomers, whereas others are active as dimers or oligomers. For example, bacteriophage T4 gp41 helicase and Escherichia coli DnaB helicase form hexameric structures that encircle and sequester single-stranded DNA (6Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol.

In short, the oligomerization of helicases appears to increase the efficiency of unwinding, although monomeric helicases can translocate on ssDNA. Hence, oligomerization of helicases has been intensely studied, and the role for oligomerization is under debate for some enzymes. The hepatitis C virus-encoded NS3 (nonstructural protein 3) is a 631-amino acid residue, bifunctional enzyme containing a serine protease in the amino-terminal 180 residues and an NTPase-RNA helicase in the carboxyl-terminal 451 residues (17Kim D.W. Gwack Y. Han J.H. Choe J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Each of the two domains can be expressed separately and retain activity (18Failla C. Tomei L. De F.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the activities are interdependent, since recently it was shown that the NS3 helicase domain stimulates the serine protease activity (19Beran R.K. Pyle A.M. J. Biol.

The question arises as to whether the monomeric form of NS3 also has DNA unwinding activity and, if so, how it relates to the oligomeric forms of the enzyme. Several kinetic and physical methods exist for determining the oligomeric state of helicase enzymes. Poisoning the activity of an ensemble with inactive protein has been used to illustrate interactions or the lack of interactions among protein monomers for the NS3 helicase domain (35Levin M.K.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5174-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the study demonstrating interactions based on a dominant-negative phenotype has been reinterpreted as a functionally cooperative interaction that does not require canonical protein-protein interactions (37Levin M.K. Wang Y.H. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26005-26012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In order to address the question of whether oligomerization or cooperativity is required for DNA unwinding by hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3, a series of experiments were performed to measure NS3 unwinding activity under a variety of conditions. Previous experiments were designed to maximize processivity by using a vast excess of enzyme over nucleic acid. In the current report, NS3 unwinding activity was measured over a range of enzyme concentrations and enzyme-to-substrate ratios in order to examine the activity under conditions that disfavor binding of multiple helicase molecules to a single substrate molecule. Such conditions should allow discernment of helicase activity that can be attributed to monomeric as compared with oligomeric forms of this enzyme.

A form of NS3, NS3-tetra-Cys, was engineered to have a tetracysteine cassette (Cys-Cys-Pro-Gly-Cys-Cys) located at the C terminus of the protein by using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). NS3-tetra-Cys and FlAsH-EDT2 (Invitrogen) were incubated at 4 °C for 5 h with gentle agitation. After dialysis to remove free dye, ∼85% of the protein was found to have bound the dye.

DNA substrate (15 nt/30 bp, the longer strand radiolabeled with 32P) was added to 100 nm, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The sequence of the 45-nt oligonucleotide was 5′-GACTGACGCTAGGCTGACAGGACGTACTACT15-3′. The sequence of the 30-nt complementary strand was 5′-GTAGTACGTCCTGTCAGCCTAGCGTCAGTC-3′. The unwinding reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and a 30-fold excess of DNA trap to bind the displaced strand and prevent reannealing to the radiolabeled product. At appropriate time points, a 10-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was transferred to a centrifuge tube containing 200 mm EDTA, 0.7% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 6% glycerol. The double- and single-stranded DNA were resolved via native 20% polyacrylamide gel. The radiolabeled substrate and product were detected using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation was performed with ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare), and the ratio of single- to double-stranded DNA was plotted as a function of time. Data were fit to a straight line using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Identical experiments were performed at 100 and 500 nm NS3wt incubated with varying amounts of ATPase-deficient NS3(D290A) with 100 nm and 1.25 μm substrate, respectively. Single Turnover DNA Unwinding—NS3 (250 nm NS3wt with variable NS3(D290A)) and DNA substrate (2 nm 15 nt/30 bp, the longer strand radiolabeled with 32P) were prepared in 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 2 mm βME, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. The protein(s) was co-incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. Substrate was then incubated with the protein(s) for 5 min. Reaction components were incubated at 37 °C using a circulating water bath. The unwinding reaction was initiated by the rapid addition of 5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2 (unless otherwise specified), 30-fold excess DNA trap, and 10-fold excess poly(U) protein trap using an RQF-3 Rapid Quench Flow instrument (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). The reaction was quenched after 0.1–30 s by adding 200 mm EDTA and 0.7% SDS. Bromphenol blue (0.1%), 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 6% glycerol were added to each, and the double- and single-stranded DNA were resolved via native 20% polyacrylamide gel. The radiolabeled substrate and product were detected using a PhosphorImager, and quantitation was performed with ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). Data were converted to concentration of ssDNA product as described (33Tackett A.J. Chen Y. Cameron C.E. Raney K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10797-10806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Anisotropy Assay—Experiments were performed at 37 °C using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Victor3V 1420 multilabel counter. Measurements were integrated over a 0.2-s detection period. The instrument lamp energy was at the maximum setting, and filters were set to 485 nm for excitation and 535 nm for emission. The polarizing aperture was set to normal, and the excitation aperture was set to 4 mm. NS3-tetra-Cys was labeled with FlAsH and prepared as described (40Jennings T.A. Chen Y. Sikora D. Harrison M.K.

A solution of NS3-FlAsH (50 nm) was titrated against an increasing concentration of NS3wt or NS3h in buffer containing 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm βME, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. Triplicate samples were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min prior to measuring fluorescence polarization. Data were plotted as the average of three independent experiments with S.D. values. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Assay—Measurements were made using a SLM Aminco-Bowman Series 2 luminescence spectrometer. The temperature was regulated at 37 °C with a circulating water bath. The excitation wavelength was set to 550 nm with a band pass of 0.5 nm. The emission wavelength was set to 668 nm with a band pass of 8 nm. Buffer consisted of 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm βME, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. 5′-Cy3-labeled and 3′-Cy5-labeled, noncomplementary, 8-base oligonucleotides were added to the buffer to a final concentration of 500 nm each. The sequences for the probes were 5′-GTCACACT-Cy5–3′ and 5′-Cy3-AGCATCAG-3′. NS3wt or NS3h was then titrated into solution, and the intensity of emission at 668 nm was detected. Data for NS3wt were plotted as the average of three experiments with S.D. values. The experiment was repeated with each oligonucleotide probe at 2.5 μm, and NS3wt was titrated into the solution. Fluorescence Anisotropy of NS3-FlAsH with NS3wt or NS3h—Previous work has indicated that NS3 interacts with itself. Results have indicated a dimeric form of the enzyme (30Khu Y.L. Koh E. Lim S.P. Tan Y.H. Brenner S. Lim S.G. Hong W.J. Goh P.Y. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32Serebrov V. Pyle A.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), whereas other studies have suggested that larger oligomers can also form (34Sikora B. Chen Y. Lichti C.F. Harrison M.K. Jennings T.A. Tang Y. Tackett A.J. Jordan J.B. Sakon J. Cameron C.E. Raney K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 11516-11525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As a biophysical method of investigating the interaction of NS3 with itself, a fluorescence anisotropy assay was employed. Fluorescence anisotropy is a technique that reports on the size and shape of a species in solution (41Lundblad J.R. Laurance M. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). If the size of a species increases upon interactions with a binding partner, then the degree of fluorescence polarization increases. Conversely, if a species is broken into smaller units upon mixing, then polarization decreases. To conduct these experiments, we prepared a variant of NS3 containing a peptide (Cys-Cys-Pro-Gly-Cys-Cys) on the C terminus (NS3-tetra-Cys) that binds tightly to a fluorescein derivative termed FlAsH (42Griffin B.A. Adams S.R. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1998; 281: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 43Griffin B.A. Adams S.R. Jones J. Tsien R.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The labeled protein, NS3-FlAsH, was found to behave similarly to wild-type NS3 with regard to DNA unwinding (supplemental Fig. 1). NS3-FlAsH was titrated with NS3wt and NS3h in unwinding assay buffer (Fig. 1). The results show an increase in anisotropy when the labeled protein is mixed with NS3wt, whereas little or no change is noted when it is mixed with NS3h. Fitting the data to the quadratic equation results in an apparent Kd value of 236 ± 52 nm. This result provides direct support for NS3 oligomerization in solution and highlights the importance of the protease domain in mediating NS3-NS3 interactions, as was previously reported (30Khu Y.L. Koh E. Lim S.P. Tan Y.H. Brenner S. Lim S.G. Hong W.J. Goh P.Y. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, one consideration is that the observed equilibrium dissociation constant in Fig. 1 may be reflective of multiple equilibria, including monomers associating to form dimers, dimers associating to form tetramers, and so on, in light of previous studies indicating that quaternary structures larger than dimers are likely to exist at concentrations of NS3 of ≥1 μm (34Sikora B. Chen Y. Lichti C.F. Harrison M.K. Jennings T.A. Tang Y. Tackett A.J. Jordan J.B. Sakon J. Cameron C.E. Raney K.D. J. Biol.

NS3 Behaves as an Oligomer in Solution That Is Capable of Binding Multiple Nucleic Acid Strands—To explore whether NS3 oligomers can bind to DNA, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiment was designed to simultaneously report on the oligomerization of the protein as well as the number of active DNA binding sites within the oligomer. Binding of DNA to NS3 as a function of NS3 concentration was examined by using oligonucleotides that were designed to bind in a 1:1 stoichiometry with NS3. The nucleic acid binding site of NS3 has previously been shown to accommodate 8 nucleotides (25Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Griffith J.P. Dwyer M.D. Thomson J.A. Murcko M.A. Lin C. Caron P.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Therefore, Cy3- and Cy5-labeled 8-mers were used as probes to minimize the possibility of multiple NS3 monomers binding to an individual nucleic acid sequence. The Cy3 and Cy5 FRET pair was chosen based on their successful application in protein-nucleic acid measurements. The Förster radius for this pair has been determined to be 61–65 Å (44Rasnik I. Myong S. Cheng W. Lohman T.M. Ha T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Hence, upon titration of the mixture of oligonucleotides with NS3, FRET should be observed if the oligonucleotides bind to adjacent sites within an oligomeric form of NS3 as depicted in Fig. 2A. The concentration of each nucleic acid was initially set at 500 nm in order to be above the equilibrium dissociation constant for ssDNA binding under these conditions (7 nm; supplemental Fig. 2). The raw emission spectra for the oligonucleotide probes alone and in the presence of 1.5 μm NS3 are shown in Fig. 2B. The emission from the Cy3 fluorophore is reduced in the spectrum generated from the sample containing NS3 with a concomitant increase in the signal from the Cy5 label, as expected for a FRET signal. The emission was measured as a function of increasing NS3 concentration and is plotted in Fig. 2C. Interestingly, the FRET signal reached a maximum at a ∼1:1 ratio of protein to nucleic acid strands, which indicates that all of the protein is capable of binding nucleic acid substrate. Additionally, NS3h, which does not display the oligomeric characteristics of full-length NS3, did not exhibit an increase in FRET acceptor signal as protein was titrated into a solution containing labeled oligonucleotides. The sigmoidal shape of the curve in Fig. 2C suggests that positive cooperativity occurs due to protein-protein interactions, protein-nucleic acid interactions, or both. If protein-protein interactions are solely responsible for the sigmoidal shape, then repeating the titration at higher nucleic acid concentration (and hence higher protein concentration) may reduce the sigmoidicity. The concentration of each oligonucleotide probe was increased to 2.5 μm, and the titration was repeated. As with the experiment performed at lower DNA concentration, the shape of the binding curve was sigmoidal, and the FRET signal reached a maximum point when the nucleic acid strand/protein ratio was 1:1 (Fig. 2D). Overlaying the scaled data from Fig. 2, C and D (Fig. 2E) shows that both curves demonstrate a very similar sigmoidal increase in signal, suggesting that the initial phase of the curves may due to a threshold that must be exceeded for the development of FRET signal. Thus, the equilbria that are responsible for the shape of the FRET signal as a function of NS3 concentration are likely to involve protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions. There are several clear results from this experiment: 1) NS3 forms oligomeric species consisting of, at a minimum, dimers in the presence of nucleic acids; 2) adjacent monomers within the oligomeric structure are capable of binding nucleic acid substrates; and 3) all of the protein is capable of binding to DNA even after oligomerization. DNA Unwinding at Varying Concentrations of NS3 Indicates no Increase in Specific Activity under Multiple Turnover Conditions— Formation of NS3 oligomeric structures has been correlated with increasing DNA and RNA unwinding activity by showing that the burst amplitude for product formation increases with increasing enzyme concentration (34Sikora B. Chen Y. Lichti C.F. Harrison M.K. Jennings T.A. Tang Y. Tackett A.J. Jordan J.B. Sakon J. Cameron C.E. Raney K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 11516-11525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The reported experiments were conducted under single turnover conditions in which the enzyme concentration was similar to or greater than the DNA substrate concentration. The results indicated that if a monomeric form of NS3 is active, then its processivity is relatively low compared with oligomeric forms. DNA unwinding can be measured under multiple turnover conditions in which the substrate concentration is similar to or greater than the enzyme concentration. Multiple turnover conditions effectively increase the “signal” for measuring DNA unwinding by allowing multiple opportunities for unwinding to occur. If NS3 must oligomerize to function, then the specific activity of the enzyme should increase as the enzyme concentration increases. To determine if the active species of NS3 changes with a dependence on enzyme concentration, we measured unwinding of a DNA substrate under multiple turnover conditions over a range of enzyme concentrations, both below and above the apparent Kd value observed by anisotropy. If NS3-NS3 interactions are necessary for the observed DNA unwinding activity, then an increase in specific activity with increasing enzyme concentration should be observed, as long as DNA unwinding is rate-limiting in the reaction. An increase in the unwinding rate with increasi"

Pregnant mice (C57BL/6) were exposed to hypoxia (10% O(2)) or room air from embryonic days (E) 8.5-10.5, and treated with caffeine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle (normal saline, 0.9% NaCl). This caffeine dose results in a circulating level that is equivalent to 2 cups of coffee in humans. Hypoxic exposure acutely reduced embryonic growth by 30%. Exposure to a single dose of caffeine inhibited cardiac ventricular development by 53% in hypoxia and 37% in room air. Caffeine exposure resulted in inhibition of hypoxia-induced HIF1alpha protein expression in embryos by 40%. When offspring from dams treated with a single dose of caffeine were studied in adulthood, we observed that caffeine treatment alone resulted in a decrease in cardiac function of 38%, as assessed by echocardiography. We also observed a 20% increase in body fat with male mice exposed to caffeine. Caffeine was dissolved in normal saline, so it was used as a control. Room air controls were used to compare to the hypoxic mice. Exposure to a single dose of caffeine during embryogenesis results in both short-term effects on cardiac development and long-term effects on cardiac function."
https://openalex.org/W2062692686,"Background Previous studies have demonstrated an association between polymorphisms in the regulatory regions of Cyclophilin A (CypA) and susceptibility to both HIV-1 infection and disease progression. Here we studied whether these polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and disease progression in the Amsterdam Cohort on HIV-1 infection and AIDS (ACS) in a group of men having sex with men (MSM) and drug users (DU). Methodology/Principal Findings We screened participants of the ACS for the C1604G and A1650G polymorphisms in the regulatory regions of CypA. The prevalence of the 1650G allele was significantly higher in high risk seronegative MSM than in HIV-1 infected MSM. However, C1604G or A1650G were not associated with the clinical course of infection in MSM of the ACS. Interestingly, participants of the ACS-DU who carried the 1604G allele showed a significantly accelerated progression when viral RNA load above 104.5 copies per ml plasma was used as an endpoint in survival analysis. Conclusion/Significance The results obtained in this study suggest that the A1650G polymorphism in the regulatory region of the CypA gene may be associated with protection from HIV-1 infection, while the 1604G allele may have a weak association with the clinical course of infection in DU."
https://openalex.org/W2134207286,"Whether the seafloor is rough or smooth can have a considerable influence on the circulation and mixing of heat in the ocean and on the dissipation of eddy kinetic energy. The role of seafloor spreading rates in controlling oceanic basement topography is well known. Now a global analysis of seafloor roughness derived from marine gravity data reveals that residual roughness anomalies remain over large swaths of ocean floor: Atlantic ocean floor that formed over mantle previously overlain by the Pangaea supercontinent is anomalously smooth, whereas ocean crust formed above Pacific superswells retains the predicted basement roughness. These results highlight a fundamental difference in the nature of large-scale mantle upwellings below supercontinents and superoceans and provide a framework for reconstructing the seafloor of ancient oceans. This study presents a global analysis of seafloor roughness derived from marine gravity data and finds that residual roughness anomalies remain over large swaths of ocean floor. The Atlantic ocean floor that formed over mantle previously overlain by the Pangaea supercontinent displays anomalously low roughness, and attribute this observation to a sub-Pangaean supercontinental mantle temperature anomaly leading to slightly thicker than normal Atlantic crust. In contrast, ocean crust formed above Pacific superswells is not associated with basement roughness anomalies. Seafloor roughness varies considerably across the world’s ocean basins and is fundamental to controlling the circulation and mixing of heat in the ocean1 and dissipating eddy kinetic energy2. Models derived from analyses of active mid-ocean ridges suggest that ocean floor roughness depends on seafloor spreading rates3, with rougher basement forming below a half-spreading rate threshold of 30–35 mm yr-1 (refs 4, 5), as well as on the local interaction of mid-ocean ridges with mantle plumes or cold-spots6. Here we present a global analysis of marine gravity-derived roughness, sediment thickness, seafloor isochrons and palaeo-spreading rates7 of Cretaceous to Cenozoic ridge flanks. Our analysis reveals that, after eliminating effects related to spreading rate and sediment thickness, residual roughness anomalies of 5–20 mGal remain over large swaths of ocean floor. We found that the roughness as a function of palaeo-spreading directions and isochron orientations7 indicates that most of the observed excess roughness is not related to spreading obliquity, as this effect is restricted to relatively rare occurrences of very high obliquity angles (>45°). Cretaceous Atlantic ocean floor, formed over mantle previously overlain by the Pangaea supercontinent, displays anomalously low roughness away from mantle plumes and is independent of spreading rates. We attribute this observation to a sub-Pangaean supercontinental mantle temperature anomaly8 leading to slightly thicker than normal Late Jurassic and Cretaceous Atlantic crust9, reduced brittle fracturing and smoother basement relief. In contrast, ocean crust formed above Pacific superswells10, probably reflecting metasomatized lithosphere underlain by mantle at only slightly elevated temperatures11, is not associated with basement roughness anomalies. These results highlight a fundamental difference in the nature of large-scale mantle upwellings below supercontinents and superoceans, and their impact on oceanic crustal accretion."
https://openalex.org/W2036804871,"Background In predictive spatial cueing studies, reaction times (RT) are shorter for targets appearing at cued locations (valid trials) than at other locations (invalid trials). An increase in the amplitude of early P1 and/or N1 event-related potential (ERP) components is also present for items appearing at cued locations, reflecting early attentional sensory gain control mechanisms. However, it is still unknown at which stage in the processing stream these early amplitude effects are translated into latency effects. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we measured the latency of two ERP components, the N2pc and the sustained posterior contralateral negativity (SPCN), to evaluate whether visual selection (as indexed by the N2pc) and visual-short term memory processes (as indexed by the SPCN) are delayed in invalid trials compared to valid trials. The P1 was larger contralateral to the cued side, indicating that attention was deployed to the cued location prior to the target onset. Despite these early amplitude effects, the N2pc onset latency was unaffected by cue validity, indicating an express, quasi-instantaneous re-engagement of attention in invalid trials. In contrast, latency effects were observed for the SPCN, and these were correlated to the RT effect. Conclusions/Significance Results show that latency differences that could explain the RT cueing effects must occur after visual selection processes giving rise to the N2pc, but at or before transfer in visual short-term memory, as reflected by the SPCN, at least in discrimination tasks in which the target is presented concurrently with at least one distractor. Given that the SPCN was previously associated to conscious report, these results further show that entry into consciousness is delayed following invalid cues."
https://openalex.org/W2073918652,"Background Impaired mitochondrial function and ectopic lipid deposition in skeletal muscle and liver have been linked to decreased insulin sensitivity. As growth hormone (GH) excess can reduce insulin sensitivity, we examined the impact of previous acromegaly (AM) on glucose metabolism, lipid storage and muscular ATP turnover. Participants and Methods Seven AM (4f/3 m, age: 46±4 years, BMI: 28±1 kg/m2) and healthy volunteers (CON: 3f/4 m, 43±4 years, 26±2 kg/m2) matched for age and body mass underwent oral glucose testing for assessment of insulin sensitivity (OGIS) and ß-cell function (adaptation index, ADAP). Whole body oxidative capacity was measured with indirect calorimetry and spiroergometry. Unidirectional ATP synthetic flux (fATP) was assessed from 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of calf muscle. Lipid contents of tibialis anterior (IMCLt) and soleus muscles (IMCLs) and liver (HCL) were measured with 1H MRS. Results Despite comparable GH, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) and insulin sensitivity, AM had ∼85% lower ADAP (p<0.01) and ∼21% reduced VO2max (p<0.05). fATP was similarly ∼25% lower in AM (p<0.05) and related positively to ADAP (r = 0.744, p<0.01), but negatively to BMI (r = −0.582, p<0.05). AM had ∼3fold higher HCL (p<0.05) while IMCLt and IMCLs did not differ between the groups. Conclusions Humans with a history of acromegaly exhibit reduced insulin secretion, muscular ATP synthesis and oxidative capacity but elevated liver fat content. This suggests that alterations in ß-cell function and myocellular ATP production may persist despite normalization of GH secretion after successful treatment of acromegaly."

These studies have led to many different, and often conflicting, models for this photocycle, with a widely divergent nomenclature for the transient intermediates involved. Nevertheless, a consensus about the main intermediate states is emerging, the essence of which is summarized in Fig. 1. The ground state of PYP, pG (also named P and PYP), in which the chromophore is deprotonated and has a trans configuration, can absorb a blue photon. From the resulting excited state, a very short living ground state intermediate is formed, which relaxes directly back to pG (13van Wilderen L. Van der Horst M.A. van Stokkum I.H.M.

The excited state further results in the formation of the ultra-fast intermediate, I0, in which the chromophore has undergone trans to cis isomerization. Next, the pR intermediate (also named I1, and PYPL) is formed on a nanosecond time scale.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2062-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Accordingly, pR has been split up into pR1 and pR2 in Fig. 1. Next, the chromophore is protonated, thereby forming the intermediate pB′ (17Xie A. Kelemen L. Hendriks J. White B.J. Hellingwerf K.J. Hoff W.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1510-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) (also named I2), which is in equilibrium with pR (12Hendriks J. van Stokkum I.H.M. Hellingwerf K.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 1180-1191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). From pB′, pB (also named I2, I2′, and PYPM) is formed in which the protein structure accommodates the new protonation state of the chromophore. The exact dynamics of the transition between pB′ and pB is still under debate. Both an equilibrium and a unidirectional reaction between pB′ and pB have been proposed. We favor the interpretation of a unidirectional reaction. An equilibrium would result in the presence of pB′ throughout the recovery reaction, which is not supported by this study. Furthermore, the pB intermediate has been shown to have absorption characteristics that depend on conditions such as pH, to the extent that it can be highly similar to pB′. Based on available infrared difference spectra of both pB′ (17Xie A. Kelemen L. Hendriks J. White B.J. Hellingwerf K.J. Hoff W.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1510-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and a pB intermediate with UV/visible absorption characteristics similar to pB′ (18Shimizu N. Imamoto Y. Harigai M. Kamikubo H. Yamazaki Y. Kataoka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4318-4325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we conclude that pB′ and this pB are distinct intermediates. In this study, we will assume a unidirectional reaction between pB′ and pB. In the next step of the photocycle, pB recovers to the ground state pG. In this recovery reaction several alterations in the configuration of PYP and its coumaryl chromophore have to be accomplished as follows: (i) deprotonation of the chromophore; (ii) chromophore re-isomerization from the cis to trans configuration, and (iii) refolding of the polypeptide chain to the pG configuration. Here deprotonation of the chromophore may facilitate chromophore re-isomerization (12Hendriks J. van Stokkum I.H.M. Hellingwerf K.J. Biophys.

Measurement of PYP recovery kinetics has become a standard tool to determine the effect of site-directed mutagenesis (11Genick U.K. Devanathan S. Meyer T.E. Canestrelli I.L. Williams E.

Besides the obvious differences in used equipment, also the applied analysis techniques vary significantly, ranging from basic to highly complex analyses.The fact that several different models have been proposed to describe the PYP photocycle (7Ihee H. Rajagopal S. Srajer V. Pahl R. Anderson S. Schmidt M. Schotte F. Anfinrud P.A. Wulff M. Moffat K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The situation is further complicated by the influence of the selected measurement conditions. For instance, ionic strength (23Hoersch D. Otto H. Joshi C.P. Borucki B. Cusanovich M.A. Heyn M.P. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 1687-1699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), temperature (24van Brederode M.E. Hoff W.D. Van Stokkum I.H. Groot M.L. Hellingwerf K.J. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 12Hendriks J. van Stokkum I.H.M. Hellingwerf K.J. Biophys.

(Tokyo). 2002; 132: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) all have an influence on the recovery reaction of PYP. Although this complicates the comparison of data, it also supplies one with a tool to further understand this recovery reaction through systematically changing measurement conditions.One of the interesting aspects of PYP is its complex pH dependence, which appears in many of its properties. Photocycle kinetics is a clear example of this, where it seems each step in the photocycle has its own unique pH dependence (11Genick U.K. Devanathan S. Meyer T.E. Canestrelli I.L. Williams E. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 12Hendriks J. van Stokkum I.H.M. Hellingwerf K.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 1180-1191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Significantly, in many cases we are actually dealing with a pOH dependence (12Hendriks J. van Stokkum I.H.M. Hellingwerf K.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 1180-1191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), implying a role for the hydroxide ion. Another important characteristic of PYP is that, upon formation of the putative signaling state pB, the protein undergoes a large structural change (17Xie A. Kelemen L. Hendriks J. White B.J. Hellingwerf K.J. Hoff W.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1510-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 24van Brederode M.E. Hoff W.D. Van Stokkum I.H. Groot M.L. Hellingwerf K.J. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 365-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This characteristic, however, is also pH-dependent, such that at lower pH the extent of structural change decreases (18Shimizu N. Imamoto Y. Harigai M. Kamikubo H. Yamazaki Y. Kataoka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4318-4325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The two different structural forms of pB have different absorption spectra. The more compactly folded form has an absorption maximum around 370 nm compared with 355 nm for the more unfolded form. At high pH a third form of pB can exist in which the chromophore is deprotonated and which results in a shift of the absorption maximum to ∼430 nm (25Hendriks J. Hoff W.D. Crielaard W. Hellingwerf K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17655-17660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). From the above it is clear that the pB intermediate can exist in multiple forms.Here we report on the pH dependence of pG recovery, applying a new approach to analyze this reaction. In doing so we were able to positively identify the actual photocycle intermediate that catalyzes recovery to the ground state. Furthermore, we show the advantages and limitations of the use of photocycle models that incorporate the characteristics of the illumination conditions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Recombinant wild type and H108F apoPYP were produced heterologously in Escherichia coli, as described previously (26Kort R. Hoff W.D. Van West M. Kroon A.R. Hoffer S.M. Vlieg K.H. Crielaand W. Van Beeumen J.J. Hellingwerf K.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3209-3218Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The apoPYP was reconstituted with a derivative of p-coumaric acid as described previously (27Hendriks J. Gensch T. Hviid L. van Der Horst M.A. Hellingwerf K.J. van Thor J.J. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1632-1643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The genetically introduced hexa-histidine containing the N-terminal tag was not removed for these experiments. The purity index (A278/A446) of the samples was <0.5.Sample/Buffer Preparation—Buffer solutions with defined ionic strength were prepared by mixing 1 m acetic acid, 0.2 m Na2HPO4, 1 m Trizma® base, 0.5 m boric acid, 4 m NaCl, 1 m HCl, and 1 m NaOH. The required amount of these stock solutions was calculated (see supplemental material for details). Minor pH adjustments were made with either 1 m HCl or NaOH as necessary.Transient ms/s UV/Visible Spectroscopy—UV/visible spectra were recorded using an HP8453 UV/visible spectrophotometer. Time-resolved spectra were recorded from 250 to 600 nm, using an integration time of 0.1 s. A “Kraayenhof” cuvette (28Kraayenhof R. Schuurmans J.J. Valkier L.J. Veen J.P.C. Van Marum D. Jasper C.G.G. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 127: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was used to thermostat the sample at 25 °C and allowed measurement of the sample pH in the measurement setup. A Schott KL1500 LCD lamp was used to illuminate the sample. Actual sample illumination was computer-controlled via a shutter system, allowing synchronization of sample illumination with the spectroscopic measurement. A 2-s delay was used between the start of the measurement and the 5-s illumination period of the sample.Light Titration of H108F PYP—Transient ms/s UV/visible spectroscopy was performed on a sample containing H108F PYP in 20 mm Tris/HCl with NaCl of pH 8 and an ionic strength of 0.25 m. The sample was illuminated with varying light intensities by changing settings on the Schott KL1500 LCD lamp. To minimize the effect of probe light, a 17.3% glass gray filter was placed between the probe lamp and the sample. The sample was illuminated until a light-induced steady state was reached. For the majority of the tested light intensities, the computer-controlled shutter system was used for sample illumination. However, to reach the higher light intensities, the shutter system was removed, and illumination was regulated by manually inserting/removing the light guide in/from the light source. See under “Lamp Characterization” for a description of how light intensities were determined.pH Titration of PYP Ground State—The same spectrophotometer setup was used as described above. A buffer containing 5 mm each of acetic acid, phosphate, Trizma® base, and boric acid with an ionic strength of ∼0.25 m was used. To a PYP solution of pH ∼ 7.3 small aliquots of either NaOH or HCl was added repeatedly. After each addition, the pH and spectrum of the sample were recorded. Especially at extreme pH values, measurements were performed as quickly as possible to minimize the effect of chromophore dissociation. Also, sample illumination was kept at a minimum to minimize light-induced effects at the pH extremes.Lamp Characterization—Light intensities were measured with a LI-COR LI-250 light meter in combination with a LI-COR Quantum sensor, which measures light intensity from 400 to 700 nm. The lamp spectrum of the HP8453 UV/visible spectrophotometer was measured using the diagnostics mode of the spectrometer. The lamp spectrum of the Schott KL1500 LCD lamp was measured with an Ocean Optics USB4000 miniature fiber optic spectrometer. Light intensities for wavelength ranges other than 400-700 nm were extrapolated based on the measured lamp spectra.Data Analysis—Analysis of two-dimensional datasets, such as the pH dependence of rate constants, was performed in OriginPro 8 (OriginLab Corp.). Three-dimensional datasets, such as time-resolved spectra and pH-dependent spectra, were analyzed in MatLab (The MathWorks™), using techniques described elsewhere (29Hendler R.W. Shrager R.I. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1994; 28: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).Prior to analysis of time-resolved spectra, each spectrum in the series was corrected by subtracting the average absorbance in the wavelength range from 550 to 600 nm from the entire spectrum. The wavelength range from 250 to 550 nm was subsequently used in the analysis. In the time domain the data were generally analyzed from 6.5 s upward. This allowed for inclusion of a small part of the light-induced steady state in the fit. Equation 1 describes the model used to analyze the data.Here fpB and fpG are the calculated fractions of pB and pG, respectively; fpB,a is the assumed steady state fraction of pB; k1 and k2 are rate constants; fk1 equals the fraction that the exponent with rate constant k1 contributes; t0 is the time at which the excitation light is turned off. Essentially, the model describes a bi-exponential recovery from pB to pG. As the value for fpB,a has no influence on the quality of the fit nor on the obtained rate constants (see “Results”), this parameter was set to 0.5 for all analyses.From the above analysis a pG spectrum and a pG/pB mixed spectrum was obtained. The mixed spectrum (Smix) is related to the spectra for pG and pB (SpG and SpB) according to Equation 2.Smix = (fpB,a - fpB,ss)fpB,a·SpG + fpB,ssfpB,a·SpB(Eq. 1) Here, fpB,ss is the actual steady state fraction of pB, and fpB,a is the assumed steady state fraction of pB used to obtain Smix (see Equation 1).An initial estimation for fpB,ss was made, based on a simple photocycle model with a single-step recovery from pB to pG, using k1 as recovery rate. Although this is not the optimal model to describe the data, it is able to provide a reasonable estimation of the steady state fractions of pB and pG (see under “Results”). In this way, the recovery rate is linked to the steady state fractions as described by Equation 3,fpB,ss = Qy·I0·∊·In(10)Qy·I0·∊·In(10) + kre(Eq. 2) Here fpB,ss is the steady state fraction of pB, and kre is the photocycle recovery rate. Qy, I0, and ∊ are constants describing the photocycle quantum yield (0.35) (30van Brederode M.E. Gensch T. Hoff W.D. Hellingwerf K.J. Braslavsky S.E. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 1101-1109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), light intensity for the wavelength range of 300 to 550 nm (2.154·10-4 mmol·cm-2·s-1 = 2154 μmol·m-2·s-1), and extinction coefficient for the wavelength range 300-550 nm (5179 m-1·cm-1), respectively, as also described elsewhere (31Hendriks J. Avila-Perez M. Bruggeman F. Hellingwerf K.J. Hansmann U.H.E. Meinke J. Mohanty S. Zimmermann O. From Computational Biophysics to Systems Biology (CBSB07). John von Neumann Institute for Computing, Juelich, Germany2007: 149-153Google Scholar). For a detailed derivation, see supplemental material. Note that the extinction coefficient is specific for the lamp and wavelength range used, as it was calculated from the lamp spectrum in combination with the absorption spectrum of the PYP ground state at pH 8, using an ∊446 of 45,500 m-1·cm-1.For the analysis of the pH dependence of a rate constant, with a single pH transition, use was made of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation in the form of Equation 4. Here klow pH and khigh pH are the values of k at low and high pH, respectively.k = khigh pH - klow pH1 + 10n(pk - pH) + klow pH(Eq. 3) For the analysis of multiple pH transitions within a single molecule Equation 5 was used,Here fi is the fraction of species i, where the sum of all fractions is 1; nt is the number of pH transitions; i, j are species number indicators; k, l are pH transition number indicators; pK is the pK of a pH transition, where transition 1 has the lowest pK, and the pK increases with increasing transition number; n is a cooperativity constant for the pH transition. See supplemental material for buffer calculations for an example on how to use Equation 5.RESULTSIn this study we have focused on the photocycle recovery reaction of PYP, i.e. the dark transition from pB to pG. For this we have recorded spectra from 250 to 600 nm with a time resolution of 100 ms. The broad wavelength range allows us to include the absorption changes of the absorption peak around 280 nm, a part of the spectrum that is generally not included in the analysis of PYP recovery. Because of the rather low time resolution, we ignore formation of pB and focus only on the PYP recovery reaction (see “Discussion”). In most of the recorded time trajectories the sample was illuminated for 5 s with actinic light, 2 s after the start of the measurement. This is enough time to reach a light-induced steady state in the sample.The rate of photocycle recovery is strongly dependent on environmental conditions such as pH (11Genick U.K. Devanathan S.

J. 2007; 93: 1687-1699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and buffer composition (21Shimizu N. Kamikubo H. Mihara K. Imamoto Y. Kataoka M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Here we have opted to vary the pH over a wide range (pH 4.5 to 10.5), as we expect that this will provide us with the most relevant mechanistic information. The other environmental conditions were kept constant as much as possible. All our measurements were therefore performed at 25 °C (±0.1), with an ionic strength of 0.25 m (adjusted with NaCl), and a buffer mixture that contained 20 mm acetic acid, phosphate, Trizma® base, and boric acid.The data obtained from our measurements was analyzed in three stages. Note that our analysis was performed on absorption spectra and not absorption difference spectra. First, the data were explored to determine the number of kinetically and spectrally distinguishable states that can be reasonably extracted from the data. Next, for each measured pH value, a kinetic analysis was performed. From this analysis also spectral information was extracted. The results of the analyses at the individual pH values were subsequently analyzed to extract pH dependences. To support the interpretation of these measurements, a light titration of the H108F mutant of PYP was performed to demonstrate that Equation 3 can be used for the analysis in stage 2. Also a pH titration of the dark state was performed, which is necessary for normalization of the data in stage 2 of the analysis.Analysis Stage 1, Data Exploration—To determine the number of kinetically and spectrally distinguishable states, the data were explored using singular value decomposition (SVD) (29Hendler R.W. Shrager R.I. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1994; 28: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). With SVD a matrix containing the time-resolved spectra (A) is deconvoluted into three separate matrices such that A = U·S·sVT (the superscript T indicates the matrix is transposed). Here the U matrix contains columns representing spectral contributions to the A matrix. The V matrix contains columns representing temporal contributions to the A matrix. The S matrix is a diagonal matrix containing scaling factors that indicate the significance of each column in the U and V matrices (columns are sorted with respect to their significance). In Fig. 2 examples of two SVD explorations are shown. Above pH 7, the third component of both the U and V matrix consists mostly of noise (see Fig. 2, B and D, for an example at pH 9.0), which indicates there are only two kinetically and spectrally distinguishable states, i.e. the dark and a light-induced state. Below pH 7, the third component does contain significant structure (see Fig. 2, A and C, for an example at pH 5.5), and the fourth component of both the U and V matrix consists mostly of noise (data not shown). This indicates that there are three kinetically and spectrally distinguishable states below pH 7. To determine the significance of this third state, we took a closer look at the S matrix. For pH 5.5 and 9.0, the logarithm of the scaling values of the first nine ranks from the S matrix are shown in Fig. 2, E and G. It is clear that the scaling value for increasing ranks drops quickly and then stabilizes. To be able to compare the scaling values from the different data sets, the scaling values in each S matrix were normalized by the sum of all scaling values in that S matrix, i.e. effectively expressing the scaling values as fractions. It then becomes clear that the first component of the SVD contributes around 94% to the dataset for pH values above 6.0, and it gradually drops to 86% below this pH value (see Fig. 2F). The third component of the SVD only contributes around 0.04% for pH values above 7.0 and gradually increases to 0.4% below this pH. As such, it is reasonable to assume that this third component can be neglected, which then allows the assumption that only two kinetically/spectrally distinguishable states (i.e. the dark and a light-induced state) are relevant for the entire measured pH range. This is further corroborated by comparing the original data with data reconstructed from the U, V, and S matrices, using either the first 2 or 3 ranks (see supplemental Fig. S1 through S3). When 3 ranks are used, the difference with the original data results in unstructured noise with a maximum level of 1 mOD units at all measured pH values. Therefore, for subsequent kinetic analyses, datasets reconstructed using the first 3 ranks were used. Note, when only 2 ranks are used, similar unstructured noise of the same level is obtained above pH 7. Below pH 7 some structure is observed in the noise, the maximum deviation of which gradually increases going to lower pH values. However, deviations are still lower than 3 mOD units at pH 5, whereas noise levels remain at most 1 mOD units (data not shown).FIGURE 2SVD exploration of a data set.

PTC-bearing TCRβ transcripts are dramatically down-regulated to protect T-cells from the deleterious effects of the truncated proteins that would otherwise be produced. Here we provide evidence that two responses collaborate to elicit this dramatic down-regulation. One is rapid mRNA decay triggered by the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) RNA surveillance pathway. We demonstrate that this occurs in highly purified nuclei lacking detectable levels of three different cytoplasmic markers, but containing an outer nuclear membrane marker, suggesting that decay occurs either in the nucleoplasm or at the outer nuclear membrane. The second response is a dramatic partitioning shift in the nuclear fraction-to-cytoplasmic fraction mRNA ratio that results in few TCRβ transcripts escaping to the cytoplasmic fraction of cells. Analysis of TCRβ mRNA kinetics after either transcriptional repression or induction suggested that this nonsense codon-induced partitioning shift (NIPS) response is not the result of cytoplasmic NMD but instead reflects retention of PTC+ TCRβ mRNA in the nuclear fraction of cells. We identified TCRβ sequences crucial for NIPS but found that NIPS is not exclusively a property of TCRβ transcripts, and we identified non-TCRβ sequences that elicit NIPS. RNA interference experiments indicated that NIPS depends on the NMD factors UPF1 and eIF4AIII but not the NMD factor UPF3B. We propose that NIPS collaborates with NMD to retain and degrade a subset of PTC+ transcripts at the outer nuclear membrane and/or within the nucleoplasm.

By rapidly degrading these aberrant mRNAs, NMD reduces the translation of C-terminally truncated proteins encoded by PTC-bearing transcripts. This is important, as C-terminally truncated proteins often possess dominant-negative or deleterious gain-of-function activity (7Schell T. Kulozik A.E. Hentze M.W.

The NMD response is conserved across the phylogentic scale and requires trans-acting factors that have been defined in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and mammals (3Chang Y.F.

Nature. 2004; 427: 753-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Transcripts encoded by the T-cell receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin (Ig) genes are a unique class of NMD substrates because they acquire PTCs at an extremely high frequency as a result of error-prone programmed gene rearrangements that increase immune receptor diversity (24Gudikote J.P. Wilkinson M.F. Maquat L.E. NMD and the Immune System. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX2006: 71-83Google Scholar). This frequent acquisition of PTCs may have led to strong selection pressure to efficiently eliminate PTC-bearing TCRβ transcripts. Consistent with this hypothesis, we previously showed that TCRβ transcripts harboring PTCs are down-regulated more dramatically (to ∼1–5% of normal levels) than are transcripts from most nonrearranging genes that have been tested (to ∼10–30% of normal levels) (3Chang Y.F. Imam J.S. Wilkinson M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 24Gudikote J.P. Wilkinson M.F. Maquat L.E. NMD and the Immune System. R. G.

We have previously shown that this robust down-regulation is neither specific to T-cells, nor does it require a TCRβ promoter; rather it is elicited by TCRβ sequences that promote efficient RNA splicing (25Gudikote J.P. Wilkinson M.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Gudikote J.P. Imam J.S. Garcia R.F. Wilkinson M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recent evidence from mice harboring NMD-deficient T-cells with or without PTC-bearing TCRβ genes indicates that the dramatic down-regulation of aberrant TCR transcripts is essential for the survival of T-cells (27Weischenfeldt J. Damgaard I. Bryder D. Theilgaard-Monch K. Thoren L.A. Nielsen F.C. Jacobsen S.E. Nerlov C. Porse B.T. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1381-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Here, we examined the underlying mechanism responsible for the dramatic down-regulation of aberrant PTC-bearing TCRβ transcripts. We provide evidence that PTCs elicit two responses that collaborate to dramatically reduce the level of PTC-containing TCRβ transcripts in the cytoplasmic fraction of cells. The first response is rapid decay of TCRβ transcripts in the nuclear fraction of cells. This is consistent with previous findings from several other groups who found that the introduction of PTCs in mammalian transcripts often triggers their down-regulation (at the steady-state level) in the nuclear fraction of cells (28Belgrader P. Cheng J. Zhou X. Stephenson L.S. Maquat L.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8219-8228Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 29Cheng J. Maquat L.E. Mol. Cell.

Y.). 1998; 4: 801-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Our mRNA half-life analysis provided direct evidence that it is the result of more rapid mRNA decay. Analysis of three cytoplasmic markers indicated that the procedure we used for nuclear isolation yielded nuclei with <1% contamination of these particular markers. This, combined with our finding that the isolated nuclei retained an outer nuclear membrane marker, indicated that TCRβ NMD most likely occurs either at the outer nuclear membrane or in the nucleus itself. The second response is a dramatic partitioning shift in the nuclear fraction-to-cytoplasmic fraction mRNA ratio that results in few TCRβ transcripts escaping to the cytoplasmic fraction of cells. This nonsense codon-induced partitioning shift (NIPS) appeared to not be the result of cytoplasmic NMD, as PTCs did not elicit more rapid cytoplasmic mRNA decay when measured by three independent approaches. Instead, our analysis suggested that NIPS is the result of TCRβ mRNA retention in the nuclear fraction of cells. To begin to understand the underlying mechanism for NIPS, we defined cis-acting sequences and trans-acting factors required for it. We also examined the generality of the NIPS response and identified an instance when NIPS and nucleus-associated NMD are separable. Together, our data suggested that NIPS collaborates with nucleus-associated NMD to dramatically reduce the levels of PTC-bearing transcripts in the cytoplasmic fraction of cells. We propose that NIPS serves as a quality control mechanism that reduces the translation of truncated proteins that would otherwise cause deleterious gain-of-function or dominant-negative effects in mammalian cells. Plasmids—Plasmid constructs A– (β-290) and A+ (PTC at codon 68; β-367) are pIF and pFS1, respectively, as described in Carter et al. (33Carter M.S. Doskow J. Morris P. Li S. Nhim R.P. Sandstedt S.

First, a 3.2-kb SalI/BamHI fragment containing the entire TCRβ gene from construct A was subcloned into the XhoI and BamHI sites of the pREP9Δ B→ X vector (EV-137d; obtained from Dr. Alan Cochrane) to generate the plasmid β-841.

Construct B+ (β-902) is identical to B– except it contains a nonsense mutation (UAG) at codon 51 in the VDJβ exon. Constructs C– (β-617) and C+ (β-1001) are described in Wang et al. (13Wang J.

HeLa cells cultured to 50–70% confluency in 10-cm plates were transiently transfected with plasmid DNA (1–2 μg) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To deplete UPF1 and eIF4AIII, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a UPF1- or eIF4AIII-specific siRNAs, respectively (Ambion), for 48 h as described previously (20Kim Y.K. Furic L.

UPF3B expression was further reduced in these cell clones by transiently transfecting 1 μg of shRNA expression plasmid (G-479) against UPF3B. A firefly luciferase-specific siRNA (Ambion) was used as a negative control (35Chan W.K. Huang L. Gudikote J.P. Chang Y.F. Imam J.S. MacLean II, J.A. Wilkinson M.F.

To generate stable cell lines expressing constructs A– and A+, HeLa cells cultured to 50% confluency in 60-mm plates were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Clones resistant to G-418 antibiotic were selected using 700 μg/ml G-418. RNA Isolation and Analysis—HeLa cells were resuspended in a buffer containing the detergent Nonidet P-40 (0.15 m NaCl, 0.6% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA) and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 2 min, and the RNA in the supernatant (the cytoplasmic fraction) was purified by centrifugation over a 5.7 m CsCl cushion in guanidinium isothiocyanate lysis buffer, as described previously (37Wilkinson M.F.

The nuclear pellet was resuspended in Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, pelleted by centrifugation at 4500 × g for 2 min, and the RNA was purified from the nuclear pellet by centrifugation over a 5.7 m CsCl cushion in the same manner as the cytoplasmic fraction. RNase protection analysis was carried out on 5 μg of RNA using either probe a (VDJβ exon), probe b (Lβ exon) (26Gudikote J.P. Imam J.S. Garcia R.F. Wilkinson M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol.

The β-globin ribo-probe (probe e) was prepared as described in Wang et al. (13Wang J. Vock V.M. Li S. Olivas O.R. Wilkinson M.F. J. Biol.

Wilkinson M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16919-16930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Quantification of RNA levels was determined an Instant Imager (Packard Instrumentation Co.) or using a Storm PhosphorImager (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR analysis for analysis of UPF1, UPF3B, and eIF4AIII mRNA levels was performed as described previously (39Maclean II, J.A. Chen M.A. Wayne C.M. Bruce S.R. Rao M. Meistrich M.L. Macleod C. Wilkinson M.F. Cell. 2005; 120: 369-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). PTCs Elicit Both Nuclear Fraction mRNA Decay and a Shift in Nuclear-to-Cytoplasmic Fraction mRNA Ratio—We previously demonstrated that PTCs result in the down-regulation (decrease in steady-state mRNA level) of TCRβ transcripts in the nuclear fraction of mammalian cells (15Carter M.S. Li S. Wilkinson M.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5965-5975Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). To determine whether this down-regulation is the result of more rapid TCRβ mRNA decay in the nuclear fraction, we examined the half-life of PTC-containing (PTC+) and PTC-lacking (PTC–) TCRβ transcripts in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of HeLa cells. Nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA was prepared as follows. The plasma membrane of HeLa cells was lysed by incubating cells in a buffer containing the detergent Nonidet P-40, and the nuclei freed by this procedure were pelleted. The cytoplasmic RNA fraction was made by centrifugation of the resulting supernatant over a cesium chloride cushion followed by extraction (see “Experimental Procedures” for more details). This fraction contained most of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the cells, based on Western blot analysis with an antibody against calnexin, an abundant ER-associated protein (supplemental Fig. S1B). To obtain highly purified nuclei, the nuclear pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing Nonidet P-40 and the more stringent detergent sodium deoxycholate (DOC). The “washed” nuclei were gently centrifuged, and the nuclear pellet was resuspended and centrifuged over a cesium chloride cushion. This nuclear RNA fraction preparation was gauged to be highly pure, based on four criteria. First, 45 S and 32 S rRNA precursor transcripts were in the nuclear fraction but were undetectable in the cytoplasmic fraction (supplemental Fig. S1A). Second, the transcriptional regulator Sin3A, a nuclear marker, was present in the nuclear fraction, but it was not detectable in the cytoplasmic fraction (supplemental Fig. S1B). Third, the outer nuclear membrane marker Nesprin-1 was present in the nuclear fraction (supplemental Fig. S1C). Fourth, the nuclear fraction had undetectable levels of three cytoplasmic markers: calnexin, RCK, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Fig. 1B). The ER marker protein, calnexin, was present in crude nuclei (before DOC wash), but it was not detectable in highly purified nuclei (after a DOC wash) (Fig. 1B, –D and +D nuclei, respectively). Together with the finding that Nesprin-1 is present in DOC-washed nuclei, this indicates that DOC removes most of the ER but not the outer nuclear membrane. RCK is known to be present at high levels in P-bodies, which are cytoplasmic foci in which at least a subset of NMD is known to occur (40Durand S. Cougot N. Mahuteau-Betzer F. Nguyen C.H. Grierson D.S. Bertrand E. Tazi J. Lejeune F. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 1145-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 41Sheth U. Parker R. Cell. 2006; 125: 1095-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Like calnexin, RCK was present in the cytoplasmic and crude nuclei fractions, but not in the highly purified nuclei fraction (Fig. 1B). The absence of detectable RCK, calnexin, and GAPDH after the DOC wash indicates that the nuclear fraction preparation has negligible levels of cytoplasmic contamination (less than 1%, based on comparison of the nuclear fraction with dilutions of the cytoplasmic fraction). We first examined the half-lives of PTC– and PTC+ TCRβ mRNA in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions prepared as described above using the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. PTC– and PTC+ TCRβ constructs (Fig. 1A) were stably transfected into HeLa cells; the cells were incubated with actinomycin D for various lengths of time; nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA was isolated, and the level of TCRβ mRNA was determined by ribonuclease protection analysis. This analysis showed that, compared with their PTC– counterparts, PTC+ TCRβ transcripts decreased in level more rapidly in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the stability of both PTC+ and PTC– transcripts was virtually indistinguishable in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 1D). These results suggested that PTCs cause TCRβ transcripts to selectively undergo NMD in the nuclear fraction. Further evidence for nuclear-fraction decay was the finding that PTCs at two different positions decreased the steady-state level of TCRβ mRNA in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 1E). We conclude from these results that PTCs cause TCRβ mRNA to decay in the nuclear fraction but not in the cytoplasmic fraction. As a second approach to measure the half-lives of PTC+ and PTC– TCRβ mRNA in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, we used the tetracycline (tet)-regulated promoter system. We generated PTC– and PTC+ TCRβ constructs driven by the tet promoter (supplemental Fig. S2A) and transiently transfected them, along with the tet promoter activator tTA, into HeLa cells. To measure the rate of mRNA decay, TCRβ transcription was blocked for different lengths of time by adding tetracycline to the medium. Analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic fraction RNA from these cells indicated that TCRβ transcripts derived from the tet promoter exhibited rapid decay in response to a PTC in the nuclear fraction but not in the cytoplasmic fraction (supplemental Fig. S2, B and C). These results provided additional evidence that PTC-containing TCRβ transcripts undergo NMD in the nuclear fraction and not in the cytoplasmic fraction. Whether this decay occurs in the nucleoplasm, the outer nuclear membrane, or another site copurifying with the nucleus is addressed under the “Discussion.” If nuclear fraction NMD was the only mechanism acting to decrease the level of PTC+ TCRβ transcripts, then PTCs should decrease TCRβ mRNA level by the same magnitude in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. However, contrary to this prediction, we found that PTCs decreased the level of TCRβ transcripts by a much greater magnitude in the cytoplasmic fraction than in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 1E). Quantification of the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic fraction mRNA ratio revealed that it was dramatically higher for PTC+ transcripts than it was for PTC– transcripts (∼12.5- and ∼36-fold higher for PTCs at codons 51 and 68, respectively). Comparison of highly purified nuclei (generated by washing with DOC) with the DOC wash itself indicated that this nonsense codon-induced partitioning shift (NIPS) response primarily resulted from the accumulation of PTC+ TCRβ transcripts in the highly purified nuclear fraction (supplemental Fig. S2D). However, we also observed that PTCs elicited a modest increase in the nuclear wash/cytoplasmic fraction ratio (supplemental Fig. S2D), indicating that a minor proportion of PTC+ TCRβ transcripts are also retained at a subcellular site removed by the DOC wash. To determine whether NIPS is a nonsense codon-specific response, we determined the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio for TCRβ transcripts harboring missense mutations at the same codons as the nonsense mutations we tested (codon 51 and codon 68). We found that the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio for transcripts harboring missense mutations was comparable with that of wild-type transcripts (Fig. 1E). Evidence That NIPS Is Caused by Nuclear Retention—One explanation for NIPS is that PTCs cause retention or accumulation of TCRβ mRNA in the nuclear fraction of HeLa cells (for simplicity, we will use the term “retention” in this paper). To test this possibility, we performed “approach-to-steady-state” mRNA analysis. In this approach, tet promoter-driven PTC– and PTC+ TCRβ constructs (supplemental Fig. S2A) were transfected into HeLa cells in the presence of a low dose of tetracycline (50 ng/ml) just sufficient to inhibit transcription and optimal for rapid induction upon removal of tetracycline. Approximately 16 h later, transcription was initiated by removing tetracycline from the medium, and the nuclear and cytoplasmic fraction RNA were prepared at different time points. Analysis of nuclear fraction RNA revealed that, as expected, the level of TCRβ transcripts increased after removal of tetracycline (Fig. 2A). The upward slopes for PTC– and PTC+ transcripts in the nuclear fraction were similar, consistent with previous studies showing that introduction of a PTC does not affect the rate of TCRβ transcription (42Buhler M. Mohn F. Stalder L. Muhlemann O. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 43Muhlemann O. Mock-Casagrande C.S. Wang J. Li S. Custodio N. Carmo-Fonseca M. Wilkinson M.F. Moore M.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cytoplasmic fraction had a much shallower upward slope for PTC+ transcripts than for PTC– transcripts, consistent with inhibited entry into the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 2B). This was supported by comparison of the slopes in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. The slope for PTC– transcripts was almost identical in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, indicating that PTC– transcripts are efficiently exported (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, PTC+ TCRβ transcripts only minimally increased in level in the cytoplasmic fraction (over a 26-h period) after removal of tetracycline (Fig. 2B). As we found that PTC+ TCRβ transcripts are not degraded in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. S2C), we believe that the simplest interpretation of these data is that PTCs inhibit TCRβ mRNA from leaving the nuclear fraction and entering the cytoplasmic fraction. This is depicted in an alternative manner by plotting the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio at different time points in Fig. 2C. The nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio for PTC– transcripts decreased over time, consistent with rapid export of these transcripts and their accumulation in the cytoplasm. In contrast, the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio for PTC+ transcripts increased over time, indicative of their ac"

APC/C includes at least 13 subunits, but no structure has been determined for any tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-containing subunit (Apc3 and -6-8) in the TPR subcomplex of APC/C. Apc7 is a TPR-containing subunit that exists only in vertebrate APC/C. Here we report the crystal structure of quad mutant of nApc7 (N-terminal fragment, residues 1-147) of human Apc7 at a resolution of 2.5 A. The structure of nApc7 adopts a TPR-like motif and has a unique dimerization interface, although the protein does not contain the conserved TPR sequence. Based on the structure of nApc7, in addition to previous experimental findings, we proposed a putative homodimeric structure for full-length Apc7. This model suggests that TPR-containing subunits self-associate and bind to adaptors and substrates via an IR peptide in TPR-containing subunits of APC/C."
https://openalex.org/W2069300997,"Background During the last years, several studies have reported the significant relationship between the production of soluble HLA-G molecules (sHLA-G) by 48–72 hours early embryos and an increased implantation rate in IVF protocols. As consequence, the detection of HLA-G modulation was suggested as a marker to identify the best embryos to be transferred. On the opposite, no suitable markers are available for the oocyte selection. Methodology/Principal Findings The major finding of the present paper is that the release of ICAM-1 might be predictive of oocyte maturation. The results obtained are confirmed using three independent methodologies, such as ELISA, Bio-Plex assay and Western blotting. The sICAM-1 release is very high in immature oocytes, decrease in mature oocytes and become even lower in in vitro fertilized embryos. No significant differences were observed in the levels of sICAM-1 release between immature oocytes with different morphological characteristics. On the contrary, when the mature oocytes were subdivided accordingly to morphological criteria, the mean sICAM-I levels in grade 1 oocytes were significantly decreased when compared to grade 2 and 3 oocytes. Conclusions/Significance The reduction of the number of fertilized oocytes and transferred embryos represents the main target of assisted reproductive medicine. We propose sICAM-1 as a biochemical marker for oocyte maturation and grading, with a possible interesting rebound in assisted reproduction techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2009000045,"Malic enzyme (ME) is a family of enzymes that catalyze a reversible oxidative decarboxylation of l-malate to pyruvate with simultaneous reduction of NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H. According to the cofactor specificity, the mammalian enzyme can be categorized into three isoforms. The cytosolic (c) and mitochondrial (m) NADP+-dependent MEs utilize NADP+ as the cofactor. The mitochondrial NAD(P)+-dependent ME can use either NAD+ or NADP+ as the cofactor. In addition, the m-NAD(P)-ME isoform can be inhibited by ATP and allosterically activated by fumarate. In this study, we delineated the determinants for cofactor specificity and isoform-specific inhibition among the ME isoforms. Our data strongly suggest that residue 362 is the decisive factor determining cofactor preference. All the mutants containing Q362K (Q362K, K346S/Q362K, Y347K/Q362K, and K346S/Y347K/Q362K) have a larger kcat,NADP value compared with the kcat,NAD value, indicating that the enzyme has changed to use NADP+ as the preferred cofactor. Furthermore, we suggest that Lys-346 in m-NAD(P)-ME is crucial for the isoform-specific ATP inhibition. The enzymes containing the K346S mutation (K346S, K346S/Y347K, K346S/Q362K, and K346S/Y347K/Q362K) are much less inhibited by ATP and have a larger Ki,ATP value. Kinetic analysis also suggests that residue 347 functions in cofactor specificity. Here we demonstrate that the human K346S/Y347K/Q362K m-NAD(P)-ME has completely shifted its cofactor preference to become an NADP+-specific ME. In the triple mutant, Lys-362, Lys-347, and Ser-346 work together and function synergistically to increase the binding affinity for NADP+.

Malic enzyme (ME) 2The abbreviations used are: ME, malic enzyme; c, cytosolic; m, mitochondrial; PDB, Protein Data Bank; WT, wild type. is a family of divalent metal ion (Mn2+ or Mg2+)-dependent oxidative decarboxylases. It catalyzes a reversible interconversion of l-malate to pyruvate and CO2 concomitant with the reduction of NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H (1Hsu R.Y. Mol. Cell.

Since the sequences and structural information of this enzyme family became available, malic enzyme has been characterized as a new family, distinct from other oxidative decarboxylases (5Xu Y.

In mammals, the enzyme can be divided into three isoforms according to the cofactor specificity. Both the cytosolic (c) and mitochondrial (m) NADP+-dependent malic enzymes utilize NADP+ as the cofactor and play a part in lipid metabolism by generating NADPH as the source for reductive biosynthesis (3Loeber G.

The mitochondrial NAD(P)+-dependent malic enzyme (m-NAD(P)-ME) is a distinct isoform from the other two because it can use either NAD+ or NADP+ as the cofactor; however, it prefers NAD+ under physiological conditions (3Loeber G.

Crystal structures of malic enzyme from various sources reveal that the enzyme is a homotetramer with a double dimer structure consisting of a tighter dimer interface and a looser tetramer interface (5Xu Y. Bhargava G. Wu H. Loeber G. Tong L. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 877-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 6Yang Z. Floyd D.L. Loeber G. Tong L. Nat. Struct.

The difference in kinetic properties among the malic enzyme isoforms is that human m-NAD(P)-ME, but not the other two isoforms, is an allosteric enzyme and demonstrated positive cooperativity with its substrate l-malate. The activator fumarate is bound at the dimer interface and allosterically activates the human m-NAD(P)-ME isoform by decreasing the Km value of the substrates and increasing the kcat value (18Moreadith R.W.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9712-9721Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Additionally, human m-NAD(P)-ME is more sensitive to ATP inhibition than the other two isoforms (18Moreadith R.W. Lehninger A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6222-6227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Yang Z. Lanks C.W. Tong L.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12737-12745Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A crystal structure of human m-NAD(P)-ME complexed with ATP has suggested that ATP has two binding sites; one is at the active center, and the other is at the tetramer interface, called the exo site (21Yang Z. Lanks C.W. Tong L. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although ATP can bind at the exo site, site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic studies suggest that ATP is an active-site inhibitor rather than an allosteric inhibitor for the human m-NAD(P)-ME (29Hsu W.C. Hung H.C. Tong L. Chang G.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7382-7390Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 30Hung H.C. Chien Y.C. Hsieh J.Y. Chang G.G. Liu G.Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12737-12745Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The binding of ATP at the exo site may be involved in the subunit association of the enzyme (29Hsu W.C. Hung H.C. Tong L. Chang G.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7382-7390Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The unique allosteric regulation for human m-NAD(P)-ME may have an important effect on cancer cells because of their unusual metabolic pathway (18Moreadith R.W. Lehninger A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6222-6227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fahien L.A. Teller J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10411-10422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Mckeehan W.L. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1982; 6: 635-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Malic enzymes show a high degree of sequence homology, except in the cofactor binding region, which is not conserved among the malic enzyme isoforms. Multiple sequence alignments reveal that the three amino acid residues at positions 346, 347, and 362 display an isoform-specific distribution (Fig. 1B), and they may be the determinants of cofactor specificity. Previous studies have suggested that Lys-362 in pigeon c-NADP-ME is important for NADP+ specificity (31Kuo C.C. Tsai L.C. Chin T.Y. Chang G.G. Chou W.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This corresponding residue in human m-NAD(P)-ME is instead a Gln, and thus this human isoform has dual cofactor specificity (32Hsieh J.Y. Liu G.Y. Chang G.G. Hung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23237-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Substitution of Gln-362 by Lys in human m-NAD(P)-ME changed it into an NADP+-dependent enzyme (32Hsieh J.Y. Liu G.Y. Chang G.G. Hung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23237-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Ascaris NAD-ME, which is very similar to human m-NAD(P)-ME, is activated by fumarate but not inhibited by ATP. The equivalent of residue 362 in Ascaris NAD-ME is a histidine. Recent works on the Ascaris enzyme indicate that changing this and other residues in the cofactor-binding site have only detrimental effects on cofactor binding (33Aktas D.F. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 2539-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 34Aktas D.F. Cook P.F. BBA-Proteins Proteom. 2008; 1784: 2059-2064Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Lys-346 in human m-NAD(P)-ME has minor effects on determining the cofactor preference, but the positive charge of this residue has been identified as having a significant impact on the isoform-specific ATP inhibition (35Hsieh J.Y. Liu G.Y. Hung H.C. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 5383-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Residue 347 also displays an isoform-specific distribution as a Lys in c-NADP-ME but as Tyr or Phe in m-NAD(P)-ME (Fig. 1B). However, the functional role of residue 347 in malic enzyme remains unclear. In this study, we focused on exploring the contribution of these residues to the cofactor specificity of human m-NAD(P)-ME. Site-directed mutagenesis was used in the combination of mutations for the three amino acid residues. In this study, the respective amino acid residue in human m-NAD(P)-ME was changed to that in human c-NADP-ME. According to the kinetic analysis, we have successfully demonstrated a mutant human m-NAD(P)-ME, which has completely changed to become an NADP+-specific and ATP-resistant malic enzyme, just like a c-NADP-ME. Expression, Purification, and Characterization of Human m-NAD(P)-ME and c-NADP-ME—The detailed expression and purification protocols were described previously (3Loeber G. Infante A.A. Maurer-Fogy I. Krystek E. Dworkin M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3016-3021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Chang G.G. Wang J.K. Huang T.M. Lee H.J. Chou W.Y. Meng C.L. Eur. J.

Human m-NAD(P)-ME was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells using a pRH281 vector with a trp promoter system that is modulated by β-indole-3-acetic acid. Human c-NADP-ME was overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells using a pET21b vector with a T7 promoter system that is induced by isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. The human m-NAD(P)-ME was purified using ATP-agarose affinity chromatography (Sigma), and the human c-NADP-ME was purified using the HIS-Select™ nickel affinity gel column (Sigma). The purified enzyme was buffer-exchanged and concentrated with Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filters (Millipore Corp.) and then stored in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) with 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The enzyme purity was examined by SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford dye method using bovine serum albumin as a standard (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Single (K346S, Y347K, and Q362K), double (K346S/Y347K, K346S/Q362K, and Y347K/Q362K), and triple (K346S/Y347K/Q362K) mutants were constructed with the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene), using the human m-NAD(P)ME as the template for the mutagenic reactions. The PCR primers were as follows: 5′-GAAAATCTGGATGTTTGACTCCTATGGTTTATTAGTTAAGGGACG-3′ for K346S; 5′-CTGGATGTTTGACAAGAAAGGTTTATTAGTTAAGGG-3′ for Y347K; 5′-GCAAAAATAGATAGTTATAAAGAACCATTTACTCACTCAGC-3′ for Q362K; and 5′-CTGGATGTTTGACTCCAAAGGTTTATTAGTTAAGGG-3′ for K346S/Y347K. The PCR was performed at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 2 min/kb of plasmid length with Pfu DNA polymerase for 16 cycles. The vector templates were digested with DpnI restriction enzyme and transformed into E. coli XL-1 cells. All mutation sites were confirmed by autosequencing. Enzyme Kinetic Analysis—The malic enzyme reaction was assayed in a reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) with saturated concentrations of l-malate, NAD+, or NADP+ and MgCl2 in the absence or presence of 3 mm fumarate in a total volume of 1 ml at 30 °C. The absorbance at 340 nm was continuously monitored in a Beckman DU 7500 spectrophotometer. In this process, 1 unit of enzyme was defined as the amount of enzyme producing 1 μmol of NAD(P)H per min under the assay conditions. An absorption coefficient of 6.22 mm-1 for NAD(P)H was used in the calculations. Apparent Michaelis constants for the substrates were determined by varying one substrate concentration near its Km value, whereas the other components were kept constant at the saturation levels. All calculations were carried out using the Sigma Plot 8.0 program (Jandel, San Rafael, CA). The ATP inhibition experiment was assayed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 40 mm malate (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 1.0 mm NAD+ or NADP+ (pH 7.4) at a series of ATP concentrations, ranging from 0 to 3 mm. The Ki value of all the enzymes was assayed with the reaction buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 40 mm malate (pH 7.4), and 10 mm MgCl2 at a series of ATP concentrations around its Ki value and at a series of NAD+ or NADP+ (pH 7.4) concentrations around its Km value. Equation 1 was globally fitted to the total data set, which describes a competitive inhibition pattern, v = Vmax[S]/{[S] + Km(1 + [ATP]/Ki,ATP)}(Eq. 1) where v is the observed initial velocity; Vmax is the maximum rate of the reaction; Km is the Michaelis constant for the substrate, and Ki,ATP is the inhibition constant for ATP. To evaluate the cooperativity of l-malate, the Hill Equation 2 was fitted to the sigmoidal curves of [malate] versus initial rates, v = Vmax[malate]h/(K0.5,malateh + [malate]h)(Eq. 2) The K0.5,malate value is the malate concentration at half-maximal velocity, and the Hill coefficient (h) is employed to assess the degree of cooperativity. All the kinetic data were analyzed using the program Sigma Plot 8.0 program (Jandel, San Rafael, CA). To evaluate the contribution of a side chain to the cofactor specificity in WT relative to its change in a mutant, the change in free energy change (ΔΔG) of any mutation can be estimated by Equation 3, ΔΔG = -RT·In((kcat,mut/Km,mut)/(kcat,WT/Km,WT))(Eq. 3) where R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Kinetic Properties of Recombinant Human m-NAD(P)-ME and c-NADP-ME—Kinetic parameters of human malic enzymes utilizing NAD+ or NADP+ as the cofactor were determined in the absence and presence of fumarate (Table 1). The Km,NAD and Km,NADP values of m-NAD(P)-ME were 1.23 and 1.69 mm, respectively, demonstrating the dual cofactor specificity of this isoform. c-NADP-ME displayed much higher affinity for NADP+ than for NAD+; the Km,NAD and Km,NADP values of this isoform were 13.1 mm and 2.9 μm, respectively. For m-NAD(P)-ME, the kcat,NAD value was significantly higher than the kcat,NADP value (where and kcat,NAD is the catalytic constant using NAD+ as the cofactor and kcat,NADP is the catalytic constant using NADP+ as the cofactor); the values were 203 and 18 s-1, respectively. In contrast, for c-NADP-ME, the kcat,NADP value was larger than the kcat,NAD value, which were 140 and 32 s-1, respectively. The kcat,NAD/Km,NAD and kcat,NADP/Km,NADP values of m-NAD(P)-ME were 165 and 10.6 mm-1 s-1, respectively, and for c-NADP-ME, they were 2.4 and 48386 mm-1 s-1, respectively (Table 2). The kcat,NAD/Km,NAD value of m-NAD(P)-ME was about 70-fold higher than that of c-NADP-ME, whereas the kcat,NADP/Km,NADP value of c-NADP-ME was about 4560-fold higher than that of m-NAD(P)-ME (Table 2). Furthermore, the values of NADP+/NAD+ specificity (kcat,NADP/Km,NADP/kcat,NAD/Km,NAD) for m-NAD(P)-ME and c-NADP-ME were 0.06 and 20,160, respectively (Table 2), demonstrating the differential cofactor specificity of these two human enzyme isoforms.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for human m-NAD(P)-ME and c-NADP-MEKm,NADFold increase in Km,NADKm,NADPFold decrease in Km,NADRatio of Km,NADP/Km,NADkcat(NAD)Fold decrease in kcat(NAD)kcat(NADP)Fold increase in kcat(NADP)Ratio of kcat(NADP)/kcat(NAD)mmmms−1s−1WT m-NAD(P)-ME(−)1.23 ± 0.3411.69 ± 0.5611.37 ± 0.59202.6 ± 26.5118.0 ± 3.510.09 ± 0.02(+)0.37 ± 0.0810.65 ± 0.2611.76 ± 0.80340.2 ± 23.7140.1 ± 6.610.12 ± 0.02K346S m-NAD(P)-ME(−)2.33 ± 0.991.91.06 ± 0.211.60.45 ± 0.21178.7 ± 44.11.192.7 ± 9.05.20.52 ± 0.14(+)1.48 ± 0.294.00.59 ± 0.131.10.40 ± 0.12203.5 ± 20.01.798.7 ± 8.82.50.48 ± 0.06Y347K m-NAD(P)-ME(−)0.90 ± 0.110.70.20 ± 0.038.50.22 ± 0.04200.3 ± 9.91.0109.3 ± 4.06.10.55 ± 0.03(+)0.24 ± 0.030.60.08 ± 0.018.10.33 ± 0.06224.4 ± 7.51.5124.0 ± 1.73.10.55 ± 0.02Q362K m-NAD(P)-ME(−)2.06 ± 1.131.70.26 ± 0.066.50.13 ± 0.0847.0 ± 13.24.398.5 ± 7.25.52.10 ± 0.61(+)0.43 ± 0.041.20.13 ± 0.035.00.30 ± 0.0880.7 ± 2.24.2103.3 ± 4.92.61.28 ± 0.07K346S/Y347K m-NAD(P)-ME(−)1.29 ± 0.281.00.037 ± 0.00545.70.029 ± 0.007240.0 ± 25.60.8130.1 ± 6.37.20.54 ± 0.06(+)0.85 ± 0.042.30.029 ± 0.00622.40.034 ± 0.007264.2 ± 5.51.3137.3 ± 8.23.40.52 ± 0.03K346S/Q362K m-NAD(P)-ME(−)2.21 ± 0.361.80.082 ± 0.01020.60.037 ± 0.00855.2 ± 4.03.799.4 ± 4.25.51.80 ± 0.15(+)1.41 ± 0.203.80.057 ± 0.00411.40.040 ± 0.00671.8 ± 4.14.7102.5 ± 1.92.61.43 ± 0.09Y347K/Q362K m-NAD(P)-ME(−)0.59 ± 0.130.50.018 ± 0.00293.90.031 ± 0.00859.8 ± 4.83.4101.3 ± 5.95.61.69 ± 0.17(+)0.36 ± 0.071.00.016 ± 0.00340.60.044 ± 0.01275.6 ± 2.04.5126.1 ± 4.03.11.67 ± 0.07K346S/Y347K/Q362K m-NAD(P)-ME(−)1.97 ± 0.191.60.0028 ± 0.0010603.60.0014 ± 0.000526.2 ± 2.67.7100.8 ± 1.85.63.85 ± 0.38(+)1.35 ± 0.143.60.0026 ± 0.0009250.00.0019 ± 0.000733.2 ± 1.710.2116.2 ± 2.52.93.50 ± 0.20c-NADP-ME(−)13.1 ± 3.210.70.0029 ± 0.0005582.80.00022 ± 0.0000731.9 ± 3.66.4140.3 ± 6.07.84.40 ± 0.53(+)11.5 ± 2.431.10.0026 ± 0.0002250.00.00023 ± 0.0000528.9 ± 2.711.8135.8 ± 2.63.44.70 ± 0.44 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Specificity constant and change in free energy change (ΔΔG) for the human m-NAD(P)-ME and c-NADP-MEkcat(NAD)/ Km(NAD)Fold decrease in kcat(NAD)/Km,NADkcat(NADP)/ Km(NADP)Fold increase in kcat(NADP)/ Km(NADP)NADP/NAD specificityΔΔGNADΔΔGNADPM−1 s−1M−1 s−1kcal/molkcal/molWT(−)1.65 × 105 ± 5.04 × 10411.06 × 104 ± 4.10 × 10310.06 ± 0.0300m-NAD(P)-ME(+)9.19 × 105 ± 2.09 × 10516.17 × 104 ± 2.67 × 10410.07 ± 0.0300K346S(−)7.67 × 104 ± 3.77 × 1042.18.75 × 104 ± 1.93 × 1048.31.1 ± 0.60.46 ± 0.27−1.27 ± 0.56m-NAD(P)-ME(+)1.37 × 105 ± 3.01 × 1046.76.17 × 105 ± 3.98 × 1042.71.2 ± 0.41.14 ± 0.36−0.60 ± 0.30Y347K(−)2.26 × 105 ± 2.94 × 1040.75.47 × 105 ± 8.44 × 10451.62.5 ± 0.5−0.18 ± 0.06−2.37 ± 0.98m-NAD(P)-ME(+)9.35 × 105 ± 1.21 × 1051.01.55 × 106 ± 1.95 × 10525.11.7 ± 0.3−0.010 ± 0.003−1.94 ± 0.87Q362K(−)2.29 × 104 ± 1.42 × 1047.23.79 × 105 ± 9.17 × 10435.716.5 ± 11.01.19 ± 0.82−2.15 ± 0.98m-NAD(P)-ME(+)1.88 × 105 ± 1.82 × 1044.97.95 × 105 ± 1.87 × 10512.94.2 ± 1.10.96 ± 0.24−1.54 ± 0.76K346S/Y347K(−)1.86 × 105 ± 4.50 × 1040.93.52 × 106 ± 5.04 × 105331.618.9 ± 5.3−0.07 ± 0.03−3.49 ± 1.44m-NAD(P)-ME(+)3.11 × 105 ± 1.60 × 1043.04.73 × 106 ± 1.02 × 10676.715.2 ± 3.40.65 ± 0.15−2.61 ± 1.26K346S/Q362K(−)2.50 × 104 ± 4.45 × 1036.61.21 × 106 ± 1.57 × 105114.148.6 ± 10.71.14 ± 0.40−2.85 ± 1.16m-NAD(P)-ME(+)5.09 × 104 ± 7.78 × 10318.11.80 × 106 ± 1.31 × 10529.235.3 ± 6.01.74 ± 0.48−2.03 ± 0.89Y347K/Q362K(−)1.01 × 105 ± 2.37 × 1041.65.57 × 106 ± 6.66 × 105525.154.9 ± 14.50.29 ± 0.11−3.77 ± 1.52m-NAD(P)-ME(+)2.10 × 105 ± 4.12 × 1044.47.98 × 106 ± 1.64 × 106129.338.0 ± 10.80.89 ± 0.27−2.93 ± 1.40K346S/Y347K/Q362K(−)1.33 × 104 ± 1.83 × 10312.43.60 × 107 ± 1.29 × 1073394.92705.8 ± 1036.41.52 × 0.51−4.89 ± 2.57m-NAD(P)-ME(+)2.46 ± 104 ± 2.84 × 10337.44.47 × 107 ± 1.55 × 107724.31816.7 ± 665.32.18 ± 0.56−3.96 ± 2.20(−)2.43 × 103 ± 6.47 × 10268.64.84 × 107 ± 8.60 × 1064564.720160.9 ± 6354.32.54 ± 1.03−5.07 ± 2.15(+)2.51 × 103 ± 5.68 × 102367.85.22 × 107 ± 4.14 × 106846.520892.0 ± 4997.03.55 ± 1.14−4.06 ± 1.79 Open table in a new tab For all mutant m-NAD(P)-MEs, the Km,NAD values did not show significant changes when compared with that of WT m-NAD(P)-ME, and they were reduced by fumarate. The Km,NADP values of these mutants, however, displayed significant differences. Previous studies indicated that the Q362K mutant becomes an NADP-specific, nonallosteric, and noncooperative enzyme (32Hsieh J.Y. Liu G.Y. Chang G.G. Hung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23237-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The K346S enzyme showed only a slight decrease in Km,NADP, suggesting that this residue is not the decisive factor for the cofactor specificity of human m-NAD(P)-ME. The Y347K enzyme displayed an 8.5-fold decrease in Km,NADP, indicating that Lys-347 may be one of the determinants of NADP+ specificity of c-NADP-ME (Table 1). All of the double mutant enzymes displayed much smaller Km,NADP values. The Km,NADP values for K346S/Y347K, K346S/Q362K, and Y347K/Q362K was 0.037, 0.082, and 0.018 mm, respectively. For Y347K/Q362K, the Km,NADP value was decreased by about 100-fold compared with that of WT m-NAD(P)-ME, but it was still about 6-fold higher than that of c-NADP-ME (Table 1). The Km,NADP value of K346S/Y347K/Q362K was only 1/600 of the WT m-NAD(P)-ME, and this Km,NADP value is similar to that of the c-NADP-ME isoform (Table 1), indicating that this mutant has totally changed its cofactor specificity from NAD+ toward NADP+. The ratio of Km,NADP/Km,NAD for the WT m-NAD(P)-ME enzyme was about 1.5. The ratios for single mutants were decreased by 1 order of magnitude from 1.5 to 0.2-0.5. The ratios for double mutants were further decreased by 2 orders of magnitude with values ranging from 0.03 to 0.04. The ratio for the triple mutant was decreased by 1000-fold, with a value of 0.001 (Table 1). The kcat,NAD values of most mutant m-NAD(P)-MEs were reduced, except for Y347K and K346S/Y347K, which were still as active as WT with NAD+ as the cofactor. The kcat,NAD value for the double mutants, K346S/Q362K and Y347K/Q362K, and the triple mutant K346S/Y347K/Q362K was 55, 60, and 26 s-1, respectively, and they were reduced by 3-8-fold when compared with that of the WT m-NAD(P)-ME (Table 1). On the other hand, all the mutant enzymes have demonstrated a significantly elevated kcat when NADP+ was used as the cofactor. The kcat,NADP values of these single mutants were around 100 s-1. However, the kcat,NADP values of double and triple mutants were not further increased, and their kcat,NADP values were close to that of c-NADP-ME. The ratio of kcat,NADP/kcat,NAD for the WT m-NAD(P)-ME enzyme was about 0.1. The K346S, Y347K, and K346S/Y347K mutant enzymes have a kcat,NADP/kcat,NAD ratio similar to that of WT m-NAD(P)-ME. The mutants containing Q362K increased the ratio of kcat,NADP/kcat,NAD by more than 20-fold. The value of kcat,NADP/kcat,NAD for Q362K, K346S/Q362K, and Y347K/Q362K was around 2. The value for the triple mutant K346S/Y347K/Q362K increased to 4, which is 43-fold greater than that of WT m-NAD(P)-ME and comparable with that of c-NADP-ME (Table 1). The kcat,NAD/Km,NAD and kcat,NADP/Km,NADP values of K346S/Y347K/Q362K were 13.3 and 35,985 mm-1 s-1, respectively, very similar to those of c-NADP-ME (2.4 and 48,386 mm-1 s-1, respectively) (Table 2), indicating that the catalytic efficiency of the triple mutant was almost the same as that of c-NADP-ME. The kcat,NAD/Km,NAD value of the triple mutant m-NAD(P)-ME was about 12-fold less than that of WT m-NAD(P)-ME, whereas at the same time the kcat,NADP/Km,NADP value of the triple mutant was about 3400-fold larger than that of WT m-NAD(P)-ME and has reached a magnitude similar to that of c-NADP-ME, revealing only about a 1.3-fold difference (Table 2). Moreover, the value of NADP+/NAD+ specificity for the triple mutant m-NAD(P)-ME was about 45,100-fold higher than that of WT m-NAD(P)-ME (2706 and 0.06, respectively, see Table 2).
