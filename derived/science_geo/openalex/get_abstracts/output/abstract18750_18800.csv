https://openalex.org/W2007797957,"We have investigated the in vivo functional role of rab5, a small GTPase associated with the plasma membrane and early endosomes. Wild-type rab5 or rab5-ile133, a mutant protein defective in GTP binding, was overexpressed in baby hamster kidney cells. In cells expressing the rab5ile 133 protein, the rate of endocytosis was decreased by 50% compared with normal, while the rate of recycling was not significantly affected. The morphology of early endosomes was also drastically changed by the mutant protein, which induced accumulation of small tubules and vesicles at the periphery of the cell. Surprisingly, overexpression of wild-type rab5 accelerated the uptake of endocytic markers and led to the appearance of atypically large early endosomes. We conclude that rab5 is a rate-limiting component of the machinery regulating the kinetics of membrane traffic in the early endocytic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2065378127,"rab4 is a ras-like GTP-binding protein that associates with early endosomes in a cell cycle-dependent fashion. To determine its role during endocytosis, we generated stable cell lines that overexpressed mutant or wild-type rab4. By measuring endocytosis, transport to lysosomes, and recycling, we found that overexpression of wild-type rab4 had differential effects on the endocytic pathway. Although initial rates of internalization and degradation were not inhibited, the transfectants exhibited a 3-fold decrease in fluid phase endocytosis as well as an alteration in transferrin receptor (Tfn-R) recycling. Wild-type rab4 caused a redistribution of Tfn-R's from endosomes to the plasma membrane. It also blocked iron discharge by preventing the delivery of Tfn to acidic early endosomes, instead causing Tfn accumulation in a population of nonacidic vesicles and tubules. rab4 thus appears to control the function or formation of endosomes involved in recycling."
https://openalex.org/W2025081899,"Considerable evidence supports the hypothesis that the nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase p59fyn participates in signal transduction from the T cell receptor (TCR). To examine this hypothesis in detail, we have produced mice that lack the thymic isoform of p59fyn but retain expression of the brain isoform of the protein. fynTnull mice exhibit a remarkably specific lymphoid defect: thymocytes are refractile to stimulation through the TCR with mitogen or antigen, while peripheral T cells, following what appears to be a normal maturation sequence, reacquire significant signaling capabilities. These data confirm that p59fynT plays a pivotal role in TCR signal transduction and demonstrate that additional developmentally regulated signaling components also contribute to TCR-induced lymphocyte activation."
https://openalex.org/W1604272660,"The amyloid beta-protein (A beta) that is progressively deposited in Alzheimer's disease (AD) arises from proteolysis of the integral membrane protein, beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta APP). Although A beta formation appears to play a seminal role in AD, only a few studies have examined the chemical structure of A beta purified from brain, and there are discrepancies among the findings. We describe a new method for the rapid extraction and purification of A beta that minimizes artifactual proteolysis. A beta purified by two-dimensional reverse-phase HPLC was analyzed by combined amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry after digestion with a lysylendopeptidase. The major A beta peptide in the cerebral cortex of all five AD brains examined was aspartic acid 1 to valine 40. A minor species beginning at glutamic acid 3 but blocked by conversion to pyroglutamate was also found in all cases. A species ending at threonine 43 was detected, varying from approximately 5 to 25% of total A beta COOH-terminal fragments. Peptides ending with valine 39, isoleucine 41, or alanine 42 were not detected, except for one brain with a minor peptide ending at valine 39. Our findings suggest that A beta 1-40 is the major species of beta-protein in AD cerebral cortex. A beta 1-40 and A beta 1-43 peptides could arise independently from beta APP, or A beta 1-43 could be the initial excised fragment, followed by digestion to yield A beta 1-40. These analyses of native A beta in AD brain recommend the use of synthetic A beta 1-40 peptide to model amyloid fibrillogenesis and toxicity in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1598318710,"Tau with unusually slow mobilities in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was purified from the Sarkosyl-insoluble pellet of Alzheimer's disease brain homogenates. Such species of tau (PHF-tau) are considered to construct the framework of the sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble form of paired helical filaments (PHF). Detailed comparison of peptide maps of PHF-tau and normal tau before and after dephosphorylation pointed to three anomalously eluted peaks which contained abnormally phosphorylated peptides, residues 191-225, 226-240, 260-267, and 386-438, according to the numbering of the longest tau isoform (Goedert, M., Spillantini, M. G., Jakes, R., Rutherford, D., and Crowther, R. A. (1989) Neuron 3, 519-526). Protein sequence and mass spectrometric analyses localized Thr-231 and Ser-235 as the abnormal phosphorylation sites and further indicated that each tau 1 site (residues 191-225) and the most carboxyl-terminal portion of the protein (residues 386-438) carries more than two abnormal phosphates. Ser-262 was also phosphorylated in a fraction of PHF-tau. Modifications other than phosphorylation, removal of the initiator methionine, and N alpha-acetylation at the amino terminus and deamidation at 2 asparaginyl residues were found in PHF-tau, but these modifications were also present in normal tau."
https://openalex.org/W1590197184,"The S300-II factor was discovered as an activator of ovalbumin gene transcription with the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor (COUP-TF, Sagami, I., Tsai, S. Y., Wang, H., Tsai, M.-J., and O'Malley, B. W. (1986) Mol. Cell. Biol. 6, 4259-4267). Although S300-II does not bind DNA selectively, it stabilizes the binding of COUP-TF to its ciselement (Tsai, S. Y., Sagami, I., Wang, H., Tsai, M.-J., and O'Malley, B. W. (1987) Cell 50, 701-709). Purified S300-II is also required for steroid receptor-activated transcription. Cloning and sequencing of S300-II showed that it is the general transcription factor TFIIB. Specific protein-protein interactions between recombinant S300-II/TFIIB and three members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily, COUP-TF, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor, indicate that S300-II/TFIIB is one of the targets of these transactivators. Interestingly, a truncated estrogen receptor construct containing only the N-terminal transcription activation function 1 did not interact with S300-II/TFIIB in our assay, revealing that individual transcription activation functions of a single steroid hormone receptor may contact different targets. Demonstration of a direct association of S300-II/TFIIB and COUP-TF, independent of additional adaptor proteins, suggests that members of the steroid hromone receptor superfamily facilitate the transcription of activated genes at least in part via protein-protein interactions with the general transcription factor TFIIB."
https://openalex.org/W1512741418,"In this study it could be shown that in rat the normally occurring N-acetyl neuraminic acid can be modified in its N-acyl moiety by in vivo administration of the chemically synthesized N-propanoyl precursors, N-propanoyl-D-glucosamine or N-propanoyl-D-mannosamine. It could be shown that each of these nonphysiological amino sugar analogues was incorporated into both membrane and serum glycoproteins. After treatment of rats with radiolabeled N-[acyl-1-14C]D-mannosamine, radioactivity could be removed from serum glycoprotein fractions by incubation with neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens or from Arthrobacter ureafaciens. Mild acid hydrolysis removed 98% of the radioactivity after in vivo labeling with N-[acetyl-1-14C]D-mannosamine and 86% after labeling with N-[propanoyl-1-14C]D-mannosamine. Chromatographic analysis yielded two compounds, i.e. N-acetyl neuraminic acid and N-propanoyl neuraminic acid, the latter being identified by gas liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry studies. Measurement of protein-bound radioactivity in different rat organs revealed a different organotropy of the natural and the nonphysiological neuraminic acid precursor. Of the glucosamine derivatives, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine showed the higher rate of uptake and incorporation in most organs (except in the submandibulary gland), and especially in kidney cortex and Morris hepatoma 7777. Natural and the unphysiological mannosamine derivatives were incorporated at similar rates, except in liver, where N-acetyl-D-mannosamine was taken up and metabolized more effectively. This finding indicates that it is possible to modify the acyl group of N-acetyl neuraminic acid in vivo by the introduction of an N-propanoyl group and possibly other homologous N-acyl groups. This procedure may provide a tool for a further characterization of the biological function of sialic acids."
https://openalex.org/W1948960263,"Previous crystallographic studies have shown that human hemoglobin A can adopt two stable quaternary structures, one for deoxyhemoglobin (the T-state) and one for liganded hemoglobin (the R-state). In this paper we report our finding of a second quaternary structure (the R2-state) for liganded hemoglobin A. The magnitudes of the spatial differences between the R- and R2-states are as large as those between the R- and T-states. Of particular interest are the structural changes that occur as a result of R-T and R-R2 transitions at the so-called region of the critical alpha 1 beta 2 interface. In the R-state, His-97 beta 2 is positioned between Thr-38 alpha 1 and Thr-41 alpha 1, whereas in transition to the T-state His 97 beta 2 must jump a turn in the alpha 1 C helix to form nonpolar contacts with Thr-41 alpha 1 and Pro-44 alpha 1. This facet of the R-T transition presents a major steric barrier to the quaternary structure change. In the R2-state, His-97 beta 2 simply rotates away from threonines 38 alpha 1 and 41 alpha 1, breaking contact with these residues and allowing water access to the center of the alpha 1 beta 2 interface. With the switch region in an open position in the R2-state, His-97 beta 2 should be able to move by Thr-41 alpha 1 and make the transition to the T-state with a steric barrier that is less than that for the R-T transition. Thus the R2-state may function as a stable intermediate along a R-R2-T pathway. The T-, R-, and R2-states must coexist in solution. That is, the fact that these states can be crystallized implies that they are all energetically accessible structures. What remains to be determined are the T-to-R, T-to-R2, and R-to-R2 equilibrium constants for hemoglobin under various solution conditions and ligation states. Although this may prove to be difficult, we discuss previously published results which indicate that low concentrations of inorganic anions or low pH may favor the R2-state and at least one alpha 1 beta 2 interface mutation stabilizes a quaternary structure that is very similar to the R2-state."
https://openalex.org/W2033302376,"The regulated secretory pathway is activated by elevated cytoplasmic Ca2+; however, the components mediating Ca2+ regulation have not been identified. In semi-intact neuroendocrine cells, Ca2+-activated secretion is ATP- and cytosol protein-dependent. We have identified a novel brain protein, p145, as a cytosolic factor that reconstitutes Ca2+-activated secretion in two neuroendocrine cell types. The protein is a dimer of 145 kd subunits, exhibits Ca2+-dependent interaction with a hydrophobic matrix, and binds phospholipid vesicles, suggesting a membrane-associated function. A p145-specific antibody inhibits the reconstitution of Ca2+-activated secretion by cytosol, indicating an essential role for p145. The restricted expression of p145 in tissues exhibiting a regulated secretory pathway suggests a key role for this protein in the transduction of Ca2+ signals into vectorial membrane fusion events."
https://openalex.org/W2084079528,"In Drosophila, a small group of maternal effect genes, including oskar, defines a shared pathway leading to the provision of two determinants at the posterior pole of the embryo. One determinant is the posterior body patterning morphogen nanos, and the other directs germ cell formation. Overexpression of oskar causes the shared pathway to be hyperactivated, with excess nanos activity present throughout the embryo and a superabundance of posterior pole cells. In addition, presumptive pole cells appear at a novel anterior position. Strikingly, formation of these ectopic pole cells is enhanced in nanos mutants. This observation may reflect competition between nanos and the germ cell determinant for a shared and limiting precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1624592313,"Ras-related small GTP-binding proteins (SMGs) exist in a cytosolic and a membrane-bound pool. The mechanism regulating the intracellular distribution of SMGs remains to be elucidated. We have, therefore, investigated the properties of SMGs expressed in cells of the insulin-secreting lines RINm5F and HIT-T15. Phase-partitioning analysis revealed that smg25A/rab3A as well as all the SMGs in the 23-27 kDa range, labeled by radioactive GTP after blotting, were hydrophobic, regardless of their subcellular distribution. In contrast, the cytosolic forms of ADP ribosylation factor, rho, and CDC42 were hydrophilic. The cytosolic pool of the 23-27-kDa group, including smg25A/rab3A, sedimented in a sucrose density gradient as complexes with an apparent M(r) of about 80,000, whereas rho and CDC42 were recovered in 45-kDa complexes. ARF, however, was uncomplexed (M(r) close to 20,000). The 80-kDa aggregates were likely to be formed by 1:1 complexes with the regulatory protein smg25/GDP dissociation inhibitor (smg25/GDI). In fact, pure smg25/GDI by sucrose gradient exhibited a molecular mass of 55 kDa, but cosedimented with the 80-kDa complexes in cytosolic extracts of insulin-secreting cells. Moreover, purified smg25/GDI was able to extract the SMGs of the 23-27-kDa group from the membranes. Similarly, in cytosolic extracts, rho/GDI cosedimented with the 45-kDa aggregates. Blocking the synthesis of isoprenoid groups with lovastatin resulted in the appearance in the cytosol of SMGs that were hydrophilic. These SMGs were found to sediment with an apparent M(r) close to 25,000 and to be unable to form complexes with smg25/GDI. Lovastatin treatment also caused the accumulation of the noncomplexed form of CDC42 but not of rho proteins. We propose that 1) except for ARF, all the SMGs detected in the cytosol of insulin-secreting cells are associated in 1:1 complexes with their regulatory proteins; 2) the different SMGs can be subdivided into functional groups according to the regulatory protein bound to them; 3) the formation of the 80-kDa complexes with smg25/GDI and of the CDC42 complexes with rho/GDI necessitate the correct carboxyl-terminal post-translational modification of the SMGs."
https://openalex.org/W1507719842,"An enzyme capable of specifically modifying, with a geranylgeranyl isoprenoid, candidate proteins containing a consensus prenylation sequence ending in leucine has been purified from bovine brain. This protein geranylgeranyltransferase (PGGT), isolated using affinity chromatography on an immobilized peptide column, contains two subunits with molecular masses of 48 and 43 kDa, designated alpha and beta, respectively. An antiserum raised to the alpha subunit of the related enzyme, protein farnesyltransferase (PFT), also recognizes this chromatographically identical alpha-subunit of the PGGT by immunoblot analysis. The PGGT and PFT enzymes from bovine brain are shown to be dependent on both Mg2+ and Zn2+ for optimal activity. Demonstration of the Zn2+ dependence of the enzymes requires prolonged incubation or purification in the presence of a chelating agent; we therefore propose that these enzymes be placed into the category of metalloenzymes. Under optimal assay conditions, these enzymes show high specificity toward their prenyl diphosphate substrates, with only a weak competition observed with farnesyl diphosphate in the PGGT reaction or geranylgeranyl diphosphate in the PFT reaction. The two enzymes are differentially sensitive to several detergents tested to determine suitable ones for product stabilization in the reactions. These results confirm previous predictions on the subunit structure of the PGGT and provide an avenue to initiating a molecular analysis of the geranylgeranyl modification of many mammalian proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1595045594,"Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) treatment of a mixture of cytosol and plasma membranes from resting neutrophils resulted in the activation of the respiratory burst oxidase, a complicated enzyme that catalyzes the production of O2- from NADPH and oxygen. Activation was accompanied by translocation to the plasma membranes of the oxidase components p47phox and p67phox, which in resting cytosol were found in a M(r) approximately 240,000 complex. This translocation, which appeared to take place without a major change in the size of the cytosolic complex, did not occur if the membranes lacked cytochrome b558, and was inhibited by the peptide PRGV-HFIFNK, a sequence found near the carboxyl terminus of cytochrome b558 that was known from earlier work to inhibit O2- production by the cell-free system (Rotrosen, D., Kleinberg, M. E., Nunoi, H., Leto T., Gallin, J. I., and Malech H. L. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 8745-8750). Cytosols pretreated with the cross-linking agents 3,3'-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl) propionate (DTSSP) (cleavable by 2-mercaptoethanol) and bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (not cleavable by 2-mercaptoethanol) lost most of their ability to support O2- production in the cell-free system, and oxidase components from DTSSP-treated cytosol failed to translocate to the plasma membrane. When DTSSP-treated cytosols were incubated with 2-mercaptoethanol, however, both O2- production and translocation were partly restored, indicating that the functional impairment in DTSSP-treated cytosols was probably due at least in part to a restriction in the conformational mobility of the cross-linked peptide chains in the approximately 240,000 complex. These findings provide further support for the idea that the cytosolic components of the respiratory burst oxidase exist in the form of a approximately 240,000 complex, and suggest that the exposure of this complex to SDS induces a structural change that may or may not be associated with the loss of an inhibitory subunit too small to cause a detectable change in the size of the complex. This SDS-induced change allows translocation to take place by creating a membrane-binding site on the surface of the complex."
https://openalex.org/W1559258409,"Rat liver S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) synthetase appears as high-M(r) (tetramer) and low-M(r) (dimer) forms. Both are inhibited in the presence of GSSG at pH 8. The calculated Ki values are 2.14 and 4.03 mM for the high- and low-M(r) forms, respectively. No effect on enzyme activity was observed in the presence of GSH, but modulation of inhibition by GSSG can be obtained by addition of GSH. At a total glutathione concentration (GSH + GSSG) of 10 mM, a KOX of 1.74 was calculated for the high-M(r) form, whereas this constant was 2.85 for the low-M(r) AdoMet synthetase. No incorporation of [35S]GSSG was observed in either of the enzyme forms, and inhibition of enzyme activity was correlated with dissociation of both AdoMet synthetases to a monomer. The data obtained in the presence of GSSG seem to suggest that oxidation leads to the formation of an intrasubunit disulfide. The possible regulation of AdoMet synthetase activity by the GSH/GSSG ratio is discussed, as well as its in vivo significance."
https://openalex.org/W1607595902,"Bovine rhodopsin has been reported to be S-palmitylated at cysteines 322 and 323 (Ovchinnikov, Y. A., Abdulaev, N. G., and Bogachuk, A.S. (1988) FEBS Lett. 230, 1-5). Using a combination of enzymatic and chemical cleavage techniques in conjunction with tandem mass spectrometry, the sites of incorporation of the palmityl groups are shown. Bovine rhodopsin in disc membranes was digested with thermolysin to generate the C-terminal fragment (241-327), which was subsequently cleaved with cyanogen bromide to generate the peptide Val-Thr-Thr-Leu-Cys-Cys-Gly-Lys-Asn-Pro (318-327). A bis-S-palmitylated synthetic standard had the same retention time by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography as the isolated peptide and the same molecular weight (MH+1511.7) by liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry. Dithiothreitol reduction of both the isolated and the synthetic peptide cleaved the two thioester-linked palmityl groups to produce reduction products of the same appropriately decreased molecular weight (MH+1035.5). Tandem mass spectrometry of the isolated and the synthetic peptide identified the sites of attachment of the palmityl groups on cysteines 322 and 323. These results prove the modification of cysteines 322 and 323 with palmitic acid in bovine rhodopsin, and illustrate the utility of mass spectrometry to characterize the post-translational modifications in G-protein coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1571501044,"The integrin family is composed of a large number of heterodimers, each one mediating distinct interactions with extracellular matrix and/or cell surface ligands. The expression of integrins appears to be tightly regulated in vivo, but the mechanisms by which cells control the formation and surface expression of specific pairs of subunits have not been well characterized. Two integrin subunits, the alpha subunit alpha v, and the beta subunit beta 1, could pose special problems in regulation because of their capacity to associate with multiple partners. In the present study, we have examined the effects of the cytokine transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) on the expression of alpha v- and beta 1-containing integrins in primary cultures of guinea pig airway epithelial cells, e.g. cells that we have previously found to express multiple potential partners for both alpha v and beta 1. TGF-beta 1 increased the surface expression of both alpha v- and beta 1-containing heterodimers after periods of stimulation from 24 to 72 h. These increases in surface expression were associated with significant increases in the concentrations of mRNA encoding each of the partners of alpha v and beta 1, but with only minimal increases in mRNA encoding alpha v and beta 1 themselves. Airway epithelial cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine during stimulation with TGF-beta 1 demonstrated only a minimal increase in the synthesis of new alpha v protein at a time when synthesis of alpha v's beta subunit partners and surface expression of alpha v-containing heterodimers were dramatically increased. These data suggest that, at least in some cells, promiscuous integrin subunits (both alpha and beta) may normally be synthesized in excess. Thus, the surface expression of specific integrin heterodimers can be regulated primarily through regulation of the synthesis of the specific partners of these subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1494429407,"The topography of membrane-bound blood coagulation factor IXa (fIXa) and the nature of its interaction with its cofactor, factor VIIIa (fVIIIa), were examined using fluorescent derivatives of fIXa. A fluorescein dye was covalently attached to the active-site histidine of fIXa via a D-Phe-Pro-Arg tripeptide tether to form Fl-A-FPR-fIXa; similarly, a 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl (dansyl) dye was covalently attached via Glu-Gly-Arg to form DEGR-fIXa. When either Fl-A-FPR-fIXa or DEGR-fIXa was titrated with phosphatidylcholine-phosphatidylserine vesicles containing octadecylrhodamine in the presence of Ca2+, fluorescence energy transfer was observed. Assuming a random orientation of dyes, the distance of closest approach between the donor dyes in the active sites of the membrane-bound enzymes and the acceptor dyes at the membrane surface was found to be 89 +/- 3 A for Fl-A-FPR-fIXa and 73 +/- 4 A for DEGR-fIXa. Although the exact distance remains uncertain, it is clear that the active site of fIXa is positioned more than 70 A above the surface, and hence that the elongated fIXa molecule projects approximately perpendicularly from the surface when bound to the membrane. The binding of fVIIIa to membrane-bound Fl-A-FPR-fIXa or DEGR-fIXa did not alter the location of the active site relative to the membrane surface, but did alter both the emission intensity and anisotropy of the fluorescein and dansyl probes and hence their environments. Cofactor stimulation of fIXa activity therefore appears to be mediated, at least in part, by a conformational change in the active site that occurs when fVIIIa binds to the enzyme on the phospholipid surface."
https://openalex.org/W1579000749,"In this work we have used fluorescence spectroscopic approaches to examine the binding of the beta gamma T subunit complex of transducin to the photoreceptor, rhodopsin. To do this, we have covalently labeled the beta gamma T subunit complex with the environmentally sensitive fluorescent cysteine reagent 2-(4'-maleimidylanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (MIANS). By using the MIANS moiety as a fluorescent reporter group, we were able to monitor directly the binding of the MIANS-beta gamma T complex to light-activated rhodopsin, which was reconstituted into phosphatidylcholine vesicles, through an enhancement (30-50%) in the MIANS fluorescence. Phosphatidylcholine vesicles, alone, elicited only minor changes in the MIANS-beta gamma T fluorescence (i.e. less than 10% enhancement), whereas the addition of rhodopsin in the absence of lipid vesicles and in minimal detergent fully mimicked the effects of reconstituted rhodopsin and caused a significant enhancement of the MIANS fluorescence. The interactions between the MIANS-beta gamma T complex and rhodopsin also resulted in a quenching of the rhodopsin tryptophan fluorescence (approximately 30%), which most likely reflected resonance energy transfer between the tryptophan residues and the MIANS moieties. The binding of the MIANS-beta gamma T species to the alpha T subunit was accompanied by an enhancement of the MIANS fluorescence (30-50%) and a slight blue shift of the emission maximum, as described previously (Phillips, W. J., and Cerione, R. A. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 11017-11024). However, the alpha T-induced enhancement of the MIANS-beta gamma T fluorescence was not additive with the enhancement elicited by rhodopsin. Conditions which resulted in the activation of the alpha T subunit reversed the alpha T-induced enhancement of the MIANS emission, whereas the rhodopsin-induced enhancement persisted, thereby suggesting that the rhodopsin-beta gamma T complex can remain intact throughout the G protein activation event. Studies with synthetic peptides representing different regions of the cytoplasmic domain of rhodopsin demonstrated that a portion of the putative carboxyl-terminal tail (amino acid residues 310-324) was capable of eliciting changes in the MIANS-beta gamma T fluorescence as well as inhibiting the MIANS-beta gamma T-induced quenching of the rhodopsin tryptophan fluorescence. These results suggest that this region of the rhodopsin molecule may constitute a portion of the binding domain for the beta gamma T complex."
https://openalex.org/W1604540679,"In this study, the essential serine residue and 2 other amino acids in human pancreatic triglyceride lipase (triacylglycerol acylhydrolase, EC 3.1.1.3) were tested for their contribution to the enzyme's catalytic site or interfacial binding site. By site-specific mutagenesis of the cDNA for human pancreatic lipase, amino acid substitutions were made at Ser153, His264, and Asp177. The mutant cDNAs were expressed in transfected COS-1 cells. Both the medium and the cells were examined for the presence of pancreatic lipase by Western blot analysis. The activity of the expressed proteins against triolein and the interfacial binding was measured. Proteins with mutations in Ser153 were secreted by the cells and bound to interfaces but had no detectable activity. Changing His264 to a leucine or Asp177 to an asparagine also produced inactive lipase. Substituting glutamic acid for Asp177 produced an active protein. These results demonstrate that Ser153 is involved in the catalytic site of pancreatic lipase and is not crucial for interfacial binding. Moreover, the essential roles of His264 and Asp177 in catalysis were demonstrated. A Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad similar to that present in serine proteases is present in human pancreatic lipase."
https://openalex.org/W1531887152,"The activation of factor X by factor IXa (fIXa) in the presence of phosphatidylcholine-phosphatidylserine (PCPS) vesicles is markedly accelerated by thrombin-activated factor VIII (fVIIIa). The interaction between highly purified fVIIIa and fIXa in this complex was studied fluorometrically at 25 degrees C by using a derivative of D-phenylalanyl-prolyl-arginyl-fIXa which was modified at the active site with fluorescein-5-maleimide (Fl-M-FPR-fIXa). Titration of Fl-M-FPR-fIXa with fVIIIa at fixed PCPS resulted in a large, saturable increase in anisotropy (delta r = 0.09). The titration data were fit to a model assuming a reversible equilibrium between fVIIIa and fIXa, resulting in an apparent dissociation constant of 2 nM and a stoichiometry of 1 mol of fVIIIa/mol of Fl-M-FPR-fIXa. The initial velocity of factor X activation was measured under identical conditions except that active fIXa and factor X were included, which yielded binding parameters similar to those determined fluorometrically. Thus, the fluorescence method accurately reflects complex formation between fVIIIa and fIXa on the phospholipid surface, and the fVIIIa-fIXa interaction is not influenced by the presence of the substrate, factor X. Addition of fVIII to Fl-M-FPR-fIXa and PCPS produced a small, saturable increase in anisotropy (delta r = 0.03), followed by a larger increase (delta r = 0.07) upon addition of thrombin to activate fVIII. Thus, fVIII binds fIXa, but proteolytic modification of fVIII must occur before the complete fVIIIa-dependent structural change in the active site of fIXa, as reflected in the anisotropy change, occurs"
https://openalex.org/W1545215274,"Two new gap junction genes isolated from the mouse genome code for connexin homologues of 271 and 266 amino acids, designated here Cx31.1 and Cx30.3, respectively. The two open reading frames, oriented in the same direction, are only 3.4 kb apart on mouse chromosome 4. Within the connexin family, these two proteins are most closely related to one another (70% amino acid sequence identity) and to Cx31 (65 and 68% identity, respectively). Comparison of the Cx31.1 mouse gene with a Cx31.1 cDNA showed a similar genomic organization to that found with other members of the connexin gene family, i.e. the coding and 3'-untranslated regions are contained within a single exon, which is preceded by an intron, less than 25 bases upstream of the ATG start codon. Northern blot hybridization revealed highly tissue-specific coexpression of the 1.6-kb Cx31.1 mRNA and two Cx30.3 transcripts of 1.9- and 3.2-kb size, predominantly in skin and two related mouse keratinocyte cell lines. Minor levels of Cx31.1 mRNA were detected in testis. Microinjection of Cx30.3, but not Cx31.1 cRNA, into Xenopus oocyte pairs induced formation of functional gap junction channels with unique voltage-gated parameters compared to other connexins expressed similarly."
https://openalex.org/W1589896832,"Production of a variety of regulatory eukaryotic proteins, such as growth factors and polypeptide hormones, often involves endoproteolytic processing of proproteins at cleavage sites consisting of paired basic residues. The first known mammalian proprotein processing enzyme with such specificity is the human fur gene product furin. Structurally and functionally, furin is related to the subtilisin-like serine endoprotease kexin (EC 3.4.21.61) of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae; unlike kexin, it contains a cysteine-rich region with an unknown function. Here, we describe cloning and sequencing of a 5.8-kbp cDNA of the Dfur2 gene, a fur-like gene of Drosophila melanogaster, which we found expressed during various stages of development. This Dfur2 cDNA has an open reading frame for a 1680-residue protein, called Dfurin2. Dfurin2 contains similar protein domains as mammalian furin, however, it has an extended amino-terminal region and its cysteine-rich region is much larger than that of mammalian furin. Because of this latter phenomenon, we were able to identify a particular cysteine motif that was repeated multiple times in Dfurin2 but present only twice in mammalian furin. Furthermore, we show that Dfur2 encodes an endoproteolytic enzyme with specificity for paired basic amino acid residues as, in cotransfection experiments, correct cleavage was demonstrated of the precursor of the von Willebrand factor but not of a cleavage mutant. Finally, Dfur2 was mapped to region 14C of the X chromosome of D. melanogaster."
https://openalex.org/W1494909024,"Promotion of cell growth and differentiation by growth factors during early development and organ formation are both temporally and spatially very precise. Syndecan is a well characterized integral membrane proteoglycan that binds several extracellular matrix components via its heparan sulfate chains and is therefore suggested to participate in cell regulation. Syndecan-like molecules, as low affinity receptors for heparin-binding growth factors, have been recently suggested to also regulate growth factor activity. Heparin/heparan sulfate interaction is required before, e.g. basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) can associate with its high affinity cell surface receptors and trigger signal transduction. In this paper we show that syndecan, but not free heparan sulfate chains, can simultaneously bind both bFGF and extracellular matrix molecules. Moreover, increased DNA synthesis of 3T3 cells was observed when the 3T3 cells were exposed to beads coated with the fibronectin-syndecan-bFGF complex, indicating that bFGF remains biologically active even when immobilized to matrix via the heparan sulfate chains of syndecan. Finally, when bFGF was bound to the surface of another cell type (epithelial), co-culture with 3T3 cells stimulated 3T3 cell growth. Therefore, we suggest that syndecan-like molecules may determine sites of growth factor action at cell-matrix and cell-cell interfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1522565876,"Abstract The structure-function relationship of the HepG2/erythrocyte-type glucose transporter (GLUT1) has been studied by in vitro site-directed mutagenesis. Chinese hamster ovary clones in which glucose transporters were transfected were shown by Western blotting with a GLUT1 anti-COOH-terminal peptide antibody to have expression levels of Gln282----Leu, Asn288----Ile, and Asn317----Ile mutations that were comparable with the wild type. All three mutant GLUT1 clones had high 2-deoxy-D-glucose transport activity compared with a nontransfected clone, suggesting that these residues are not absolutely required for the transport function. We have examined the possibility that the inner and outer portions of the transport pathway are structurally separate by measuring the interaction of the mutant transporters with the inside site-specific ligand cytochalasin B and the outside site-specific ligand 2-N-4-(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl-1,3-bis(D-mannos-4 -yloxy)-2- propylamine (ATB-BMPA). All three mutant GLUT1 clones showed high levels of cytochalasin B labeling, and the N288I and N317I mutants showed high levels of ATB-BMPA labeling. In contrast to the transport and cytochalasin B labeling results, the transmembrane helix 7 Gln282----Leu mutant was labeled by ATB-BMPA to a level that was only 5% of the level observed in the wild type. We have confirmed that this mutant was defective in the outer site by comparing the inhibition of wild-type and mutant 2-deoxy-D-glucose transport by the outside site-specific ligand 4,6-O-ethylidene-D-glucose. 4,6-O-Ethylidene-D-glucose inhibited wild-type transport with a Ki of approximately 12 mM, but this was increased to greater than 120 mM in the Gln282----Leu mutant. Thus, of the 3 residues mutated in this study, only glutamine 282 substitution causes a major perturbation in function, and this is a specific and striking reduction in the affinity for the outside site-specific ligands ATB-BMPA and 4,6-O-ethylidene-D-glucose."
https://openalex.org/W1549262992,"A series of p- and m-substituted phenols were examined for their effect on the cyclooxygenase activity of prostaglandin H synthase in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 8.0 and 25.0 +/- 0.1 degrees C. A biphasic response was observed. At low concentrations phenols stimulate, but at higher concentrations inhibit, cyclooxygenase activity. Both enhancement and inhibition are increased by phenolic substituents which are electron-donating, quantified by Hammett sigma constants, and hydrophobic, quantified by Hantsch tau constants. The same series of substituted phenols was also reacted with compound II of prostaglandin H synthase at 4.0 +/- 0.5 degrees C. The compound II data fit the Hammett rho sigma equation; no hydrophobicity factors are required. Phenols inhibit cyclooxygenase activity by interfering with the binding of arachidonic acid to compound I and by competing directly with arachidonic acid as reducing substrates for compound I. Phenols stimulate cyclooxygenase activity by acting as reducing substrates for compound II, thereby accelerating the peroxidatic cycle. Phenols also protect the enzyme from self-catalyzed inactivation, most likely by removing the free radical of prostaglandin G2 by reducing it to prostaglandin G2. Kinetic parameters Km and kcat for cyclooxygenase activity were determined in the presence of phenols. Identical values of Km (15.3 +/- 0.5 mM) and kcat (89 +/- 2 s-1) were obtained regardless of which phenol was employed. Therefore these represent the true Km and kcat values for cyclooxygenase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1497866459,"In these studies we have investigated the role of the beta gamma T subunit complex in promoting the rhodopsin-stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange reaction (i.e. the activation event) of the alpha T subunit. The results of these studies demonstrate that although the beta gamma T subunit complex increases the association of the alpha T subunit with lipid vesicles that lack the photoreceptor, the beta gamma T complex is not necessary for the binding of alpha T to lipid vesicles containing rhodopsin, provided sufficient amounts of rhodopsin are present. The rhodopsin-promoted GDP/guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) exchange reaction, within the rhodopsin-alpha T complex, then results in the dissociation of the alpha TGTP gamma S species from the rhodopsin-containing phospholipid vesicles. A second line of evidence for the occurrence of rhodopsin/alpha T interactions, in the absence of beta gamma T, comes from phosphorylation studies using the beta 1 isoform of protein kinase C. The phosphorylation of the alpha T subunit by protein kinase C is inhibited by beta gamma T, both in the absence and in the presence of rhodopsin, but is enhanced by rhodopsin in the absence of beta gamma T. These rhodopsin-alpha T complexes also appear to be capable of undergoing a rhodopsin-stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange event. When the guanine nucleotide exchange is allowed to occur prior to the addition of protein kinase C, the phosphorylation of the alpha T subunit is inhibited. Although beta gamma T is not absolutely required for the rhodopsin/alpha T interaction, it appears to increase the apparent affinity of the alpha T subunit for rhodopsin, both when rhodopsin was inserted into phosphatidylcholine vesicles and when soluble lipid-free preparations of rhodopsin were used. This results in a significant kinetic advantage for the rhodopsin-stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange event, such that the addition of beta gamma T causes a 10-fold promotion of the rhodopsin-stimulation [35S]GTP gamma S binding to alpha T after 1 min but provides less than a 20% promotion of the rhodopsin-stimulated binding after 1 h. The ability of beta gamma T to increase the association of alpha T with the lipid vesicle surface does not appear to contribute significantly to the ability of rhodopsin to couple functionally to alpha T subunits, and there appears to be no requirement for beta gamma T in the alpha T activation event, once the rhodopsin-alpha T complex has formed."
https://openalex.org/W1487527789,"Characterization of the functional domains of Bacillus anthracis protective antigen (PA, 83-kDa), the common cellular binding molecule for both anthrax edema toxin and anthrax lethal toxin, is important for understanding the mechanism of entry and action of the anthrax toxins. In this study, we generated both biologically active (facilitates killing of J774A.1 cells in combination with lethal factor, LF) and inactive preparations of PA by protease treatment. Limited proteolytic digestion of PA in vitro with trypsin generated a 20-kDa fragment and a biologically active 63-kDa fragment. In contrast, limited digestion of PA with chymotrypsin yielded a preparation containing 37- and 47-kDa fragments defective for biological activity. Treatment with both chymotrypsin and trypsin generated three major fragments, 20, 17, and 47 kDa as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This PA preparation was also biologically inactive. To investigate the nature of the defect resulting from chymotrypsin treatment, we assayed PA preparations for the ability to bind to the cellular receptor and to bind and internalize 125I-LF. All radiolabeled PA preparations bound with specificity to J774A.1 cells and exhibited affinities similar to native 83-kDa PA. Once bound to the cell surface receptor, both trypsin-treated PA and chymotrypsin/trypsin-treated PA specifically bound 125I-LF with high affinity. Finally, these PA preparations delivered 125I-LF to a Pronase-resistant cellular compartment in a time- and temperature-dependent fashion. Thus, the biological defect exhibited by chymotrypsin-treated PA is not at the level of cell binding or internalization but at a step later, such as toxin routing or processing by J774A.1 cells. These protease-treated preparations of PA should prove useful in both elucidating the intracellular processing of anthrax lethal toxin and determining the structure-function relationship of PA and LF."
https://openalex.org/W1569675153,"We have previously investigated glucose induction of glucokinase, glucose usage and insulin release in isolated cultured rat pancreatic islets (Liang, Y., Najafit, H., Smith, R. M., Zimmerman, E. C., Magnuson, M. A., Tal, M., and Mastchinsky, F. M. (1992) Diabetes (1992) 41, 792-806). Here we studied the expression and function of GLUT-1 and GLUT-2 glucose transporter isoforms, using the same system, i.e. isolated pancreatic rat islets immediately after isolation or cultured in the presence of 3 or 30 mM glucose for as long as 10 days. We found by immunofluorescence microscopy and Western and Northern blot analysis of islet extracts that GLUT-1 expression was induced in islet beta-cells in tissue culture both with low or high glucose present. The induction of GLUT-1 was specific to beta-cells but was not present in all beta-cells and was not detected in alpha-cells. GLUT-2 expression was also specific for beta-cells and was not observed in all beta-cells. Some beta-cells in culture coexpressed GLUT-1 and GLUT-2. The expression of the two glucose transporters was regulated in the opposite direction in response to glucose concentration in the culture medium. GLUT-1 was more effectively induced when glucose was low, and GLUT-2 expression was more pronounced when glucose was high in the culture media. Another difference between the two glucose transporters was that GLUT-2 expression was increased while GLUT-1 expression was decreased as culturing continued as long as 7 days. Thus, after 7 days of culture GLUT-2 expression in beta-cells was nearly the same at low and high glucose, whereas GLUT-1 was practically absent no matter what the glucose level was. In attempts to correlate GLUT-1 and GLUT-2 expression to beta-cell function glucose uptake and glucose-stimulated insulin release in fresh and cultured islets were measured. In freshly isolated islet glucose uptake was estimated to be 100-fold in excess of actual glucose use. Glucose uptake was reduced by 7-day culture to about one-third of that observed in freshly isolated islets no matter what the glucose concentration of the culture media. We conclude that in the present experimental system GLUT-1 and GLUT-2 expression and function are not closely associated with glucose usage rates or the secretory function of beta-cells."
https://openalex.org/W1594463735,"Proliferation of the human monocytic leukemia cell line JOSK-I is inhibited by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Growth inhibition by TGF-beta was not due to either a toxic effect or to induction of differentiation. TGF-beta induced a cell cycle arrest at late G1 phase and was not found to be inhibitory to JOSK-I cells in S phase or G2/M. This G1 cell cycle arrest was associated with an accumulation of the unphosphorylated form of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product (Rb) in good correlation with inhibition of DNA synthesis. In contrast to the effects of TGF-beta, two other agents which induced a G1 arrest of JOSK-I cells had a different effect on Rb. Aphidicolin blocked cells at G1/S but could not reduce Rb phosphorylation as great as that seen with TGF-beta. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, an inducer of differentiation, did reduce Rb phosphorylation, but not until 72 h, when differentiation had already occurred. The identities of the Rb kinases are unknown, but recent evidence suggests that the cdc2 gene product could participate in Rb phosphorylation. Although cdc2 mRNA and total protein levels were not affected, TGF-beta inhibited the rate of translation and kinase activity of cdc2 in JOSK-I cells. These results suggest that growth inhibition of hematopoietic cells by TGF-beta is linked to suppression of Rb phosphorylation to retain Rb in an unphosphorylated, growth-inhibitory state. The suppression of Rb phosphorylation is suggested to be mediated through inhibition of cdc2 kinase activity by TGF-beta."
https://openalex.org/W1542393864,"Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) accumulates within thrombi and forming whole blood clots. To explore this phenomenon at the molecular level, PAI-1 binding to fibrin was examined. The experiments were performed by adding 125I-PAI-1, which retains its complete tissue-type plasminogen (t-PA) inhibitory activity, to fibrin matrices formed in 2-cm2 tissue culture wells. Guanidine HCl-activated PAI-1 binding was reversible and was inhibited in the presence of excess, unlabeled PAI-1. Activated 125I-PAI-1 recognized 2 sites on fibrin: a very small number of high affinity sites (Kd less than 1 nM) and principally a large number of low affinity sites with an approximate Kd of 3.8 microM. Latent PAI-1 bound to fibrin at a site indistinguishable from the lower affinity site recognized by activated PAI-1. Fibrin, pretreated with activated PAI-1, was protected from t-PA-mediated plasmin degradation in a PAI-1 dose-responsive manner (IC50 = 12.3 nM). Clot protection correlated with partial occupancy of the low affinity PAI-1 binding site on fibrin and was due to the formation of sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable, PAI-1.t-PA complexes. Latent PAI-1 (27 nM) did not protect the fibrin from dissolution. The localization of PAI-1 to a thrombus by virtue of its fibrin binding potential could result in significant protection of the thrombus from the degradative effects of the fibrinolytic system."
https://openalex.org/W1562882226,"Calvasculin, an EF-hand protein with a molecular mass of 11 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, is present abundantly in bovine aorta (Watanabe, Y., Kobayashi, R., Ishikawa, T., and Hidaka, H. (1992) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 292, 563-569). This protein is synthesized constitutively by bovine aortic smooth muscle (BASM) cells and rat embryo fibroblast 3Y1 cells in culture. We discovered that calvasculin was secreted by BASM cells and 3Y1 cells. Immunofluorescence staining of BASM cells showed a granular distribution for calvasculin that was typical of a secreted protein. This protein bound with an extracellular matrix protein, 36-kDa microfibril-associated glycoprotein (36-kDa MAP), in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner in vitro. A stoichiometry analysis showed that the 36-kDa MAP bound 2.2 calvasculin eq/mol of protein. Solid-phase binding assays indicated a preferential affinity of native calvasculin for 36-kDa MAP among the extracellular matrices in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. These results suggest that calvasculin, intracellular Ca(2+)-binding protein, is released to the extracellular space and binds with 36-kDa MAP."
https://openalex.org/W1571618453,"We have investigated the mechanisms underlying cell-specific glucocorticoid repression of calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) gene expression. Treatment with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone has been shown to decrease mRNA levels in the 44-2C thyroid C cell line. Nuclear run-on assays showed that dexamethasone repressed transcription 2-3-fold in 44-2C cells. In contrast, dexamethasone stimulated calcitonin/CGRP transcription 4-6-fold in the CA77 thyroid C cell line. Transient transfection assays were used to map repression of reporter gene activity in 44-2C cells to a neuroendocrine cell-specific enhancer located between -920 and -1125 base pairs (bp). Within this region, an 18-bp element was found that conferred both full basal enhancer activity and dexamethasone-dependent repression in 44-2C cells. The 18-bp region contains possible binding sites for AP-1 and helix-loop-helix transcription factors as well as a glucocorticoid receptor half-site. Colocalization of repression and enhancer activity was then investigated in other cell lines. In CA77 cells, while the 920-1125 region strongly enhanced transcription, the 18-bp region conferred only partial activation and dexamethasone had little effect on reporter gene activity. Dexamethasone did not repress the calcitonin/CGRP activity in the heterologous HeLa and Rat1 fibroblast cell lines. These results suggest that glucocorticoids repress transcription of the calcitonin/CGRP gene by inhibiting cell-specific transcription factor activity."
https://openalex.org/W1506400411,"We have previously shown that the orfE gene of Escherichia coli encodes RNase PH. Here we show that the OrfE protein (purified as described in the accompanying paper) (Jensen, K. F., Andersen, J. T., and Poulsen, P. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 17147-17152) has both the degradative and synthetic activities of RNase PH. This highly purified protein was used to characterize the enzymatic and structural properties of RNase PH. The enzyme requires a divalent cation and phosphate for activity, the latter property indicating that RNase PH is exclusively a phosphorolytic enzyme. Among tRNA-type substrates, the enzyme is most active against synthetic tRNA precursors containing extra residues following the -CCA sequence, and it can act on these molecules to generate mature tRNA with amino acid acceptor activity; 3'-phosphoryl-terminated molecules are not active as substrates. The equilibrium constant for RNase PH is near unity, suggesting that at the phosphate concentration present in vivo, the enzyme would participate in RNA degradation. The synthetic reaction of RNase PH displays a nonlinear response to increasing enzyme concentrations, and this may be due to self-aggregation of the protein. Higher order multimers of RNase PH could be detected by gel filtration at higher protein concentrations and by protein cross-linking. The possible role of RNase PH in tRNA processing is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1523623198,"Removal of intracellularly accumulated cholesterol by lipid-free human apolipoproteins (apo) A-I and A-II was studied for aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC) of rat, monkey and rabbit, human skin fibroblasts (FB), and mouse peritoneal macrophages (MP). The reaction generated high density lipoprotein (HDL)-like lipoproteins as did those and other helical apolipoproteins with MP, causing efflux of cellular cholesterol. From FB and MP, the maximum efflux rates with apoA-I and A-II per 24 h were as much as 30% of the apparent maximum efflux rate of prelabeled cellular cholesterol to human HDL. From rat SMC these rates were 7.2 and 6.8%, respectively, being independent of cellular cholesterol content. Those from monkey and rabbit SMC were also very low. When standardized for the initial cellular unesterified cholesterol pool size, the maximum efflux rates/24 h were 5.4 and 5.0% for apoA-I and A-II from rat SMC and even less from monkey and rabbit SMC in contrast to 42.4 and 39.7% from FB, and 53.0 and 45.5% from MP, respectively. The standardized apparent maximum efflux to HDL was 76% from rat SMC, 45 and 31% from monkey and rabbit SMC, 139% from FB and 166% from MP. Accordingly, the reaction with free apolipoproteins caused significant net reduction of cellular cholesterol, predominantly in cholesteryl ester, in FB and MP, but not in SMC. While the efflux Km with apoA-I and A-II were 7.5 and 4.5 micrograms/ml for MP, those for SMC and FB were both 1 microgram/ml or lower, as low as 1/1500 and 1/500 of their plasma concentrations, respectively. The apparent efflux Km for HDL were, on the other hand, all in the range of 36 to 65 micrograms of protein/ml for SMC, FB, and MP, showing that the mode of cholesterol exchange of these cells with lipoprotein surface is not significantly different from each other. Thus, peripheral cells such as FB may provide a significant source of HDL by interacting with extracellular free apolipoproteins in interstitial fluid, reducing intracellularly accumulated cholesterol. However, SMC seem very resistant to this interaction, suggesting that atheromatous lesions predominantly consisting of SMC are resistant to regression."
https://openalex.org/W1585310162,"Pseudomonas exotoxin A is composed of three structural domains that mediate cell recognition (I), membrane translocation (II), and ADP-ribosylation (III). Within the cell, the toxin is cleaved within domain II to produce a 37-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment, containing amino acids 280-613, which is translocated to the cytosol and causes cell death. In this study, we constructed a mutant protein (PE37), composed of amino acids 280-613 of Pseudomonas exotoxin A, which does not require proteolysis to translocate. PE37 was targeted specifically to cells with epidermal growth factor receptors by inserting transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) after amino acid 607 near the carboxyl terminus of Pseudomonas exotoxin A. PE37/TGF-alpha was very cytotoxic to cells with epidermal growth factor receptors. It was severalfold more cytotoxic than a derivative of full-length Pseudomonas exotoxin A containing TGF-alpha in the same position, probably because the latter requires intracellular proteolytic processing to exhibit its cytotoxicity, and proteolytic processing is not 100% efficient. Deletion of 2, 4, or 7 amino acids from the amino terminus of PE37/TGF-alpha greatly diminished cytotoxic activity, indicating the need for a proper amino-terminal sequence. In addition, a mutant containing an internal deletion of amino acids 314-380 was minimally active, indicating that other regions of domain II are also required for the cytotoxic activity of Pseudomonas exotoxin A."
https://openalex.org/W300264704,"Homodimers of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A-chain are strong mitogens for cells of mesenchymal origin. Differences in the levels of expression of the PDGF A-chain gene have been reported in both normal and transformed cell lines, suggesting that transcription of the PDGF A-chain gene is highly regulated. We have now identified two S1-hypersensitive sites which flank a 13-base pair oligo(dG).oligo(dC) sequence located 70-82 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site. Three lines of evidence suggest that these S1-sensitive sites contribute to optimum promoter activity. Nuclear protein(s) binding to these sites were detected in gel mobility shift assays. Deletion of the S1-sensitive sites results in a 2-3-fold decrease in the transcriptional activity and eliminated sensitivity to S1 nuclease. Deletions in the oligo(dG).oligo(dC) motif also eliminated sensitivity to S1 and resulted in a 2.5-fold decrease of the promoter activity in the stable transfection assays. The results suggest that the highly G+C-rich region in the PDGF A-chain gene promoter locally induces the formation of non-B-form DNA under torsional stress which appears to be important in the transcriptional regulation of the PDGF A-chain gene in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1509544115,"Abstract Studies of bacteriorhodopsin have indicated that the charge environment of the protonated Schiff base consists of residues Asp-85, Asp-212, and Arg-82. As shown recently (Marti, T., Rosselet, S. J., Otto, H., Heyn, M. P., and Khorana, H. G. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 18674-18683), in the double mutant Asp-85----Asn/Asp-212----Asn chromophore formation is restored in the presence of salts, suggesting that exogenous anions function as counterions to the protonated Schiff base. To investigate the role of Arg-82 and of the Schiff base in anion binding, we have prepared the triple mutant Arg-82----Gln/Asp-85----Asn/Asp-212----Asn and compared its properties with those of the Asp-85----Asn/Asp-212----Asn double mutant. Regeneration of the chromophore with absorption maximum near 560 nm occurs in the triple mutant in the presence of millimolar salt, whereas in the double mutant molar salt concentrations are required. Spectrometric titrations reveal that the pKa of Schiff base deprotonation is markedly reduced from 11.3 for the wild type to 4.9 for the triple mutant in 1 mM NaCl and to 5.5 for the double mutant in 10 mM NaCl. In both mutants, increasing the chloride concentration promotes protonation of the chromophore and results in a continuous rise of the Schiff base pKa, yielding a value of 8.4 and 7.6, respectively, in 4 M NaCl. The absorption maximum of the two mutants shows a progressive red shift, as the ionic radius of the halide increases in the sequence fluoride, chloride, bromide, and iodide. An identical spectral correlation in the presence of halides is observed for the acid-purple form of bacteriorhodopsin. We conclude, therefore, that upon neutralization of the two counterions Asp-85 and Asp-212 by mutation or by protonation at low pH, exogenous anions substitute as counterions by directly binding to the protonated Schiff base. This interaction may provide the basis for the proposed anion translocation by the acid-purple form of bacteriorhodopsin as well as by the related halorhodopsin."

The reaction mechanism of bilirubin-GT and the access of bilirubin and BMG (the intermediate substrate) to the active site of bilirubin-GT are undefined. Highly purified [14C]bilirubin and [3H] BMG were coincubated with rat liver microsomes, and the initial rates of radiolabeled bilirubin glucuronide synthesis were measured. Although these substrates differ markedly in their hydrophilicity, no significant differences were observed in [14C]- and [3H]BDG rates of formation from equimolar [14C]bilirubin and [3H] BMG, in the absence or presence of soluble binding proteins (albumin and hepatic cytosol). In further kinetic studies, [14C]bilirubin and [3H]BMG exhibited mutually competitive inhibition of [3H]- and [14C]BDG synthesis, respectively, and [3H]BMG also inhibited [14C]BMG formation. Finally, unlabeled BMG and BDG inhibited the glucuronidation of [14C]bilirubin, with all three pigments yielding virtual Michaelis-Menten dissociation constants in the 10-20 microM range. These findings indicate that: 1) bilirubin-GT follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics for both bilirubin and BMG glucuronidation over the range of substrate concentrations employed; 2) the findings are consistent with a single active site for the enzymatic synthesis of both BMG and BDG; 3) bilirubin, BMG, and BDG bind competitively to this active site with comparable affinities; and 4) access of both bilirubin and BMG substrates to the enzymatic active site is reduced by soluble binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1547941757,"A hydrophobic segment near the amino terminus (positions 12-32) of rabbit sucrase-isomaltase functions both as a membrane anchor and as a signal sequence for translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum. Unlike most signal sequences, that of sucrase-isomaltase is not cleaved by signal peptidase. Using in vitro transcription and translation systems, we have found that substitution of a single proline, at position 28 or 29, converted the signal-anchor to a cleaved signal sequence, with cleavage occurring after alanine 26 and the introduced proline thereby occupying position +2 or +3 relative to the cleavage site. Two deletions that shorten the transmembrane domain by 8 amino acids were also effective, whereas various other changes upstream and downstream of this domain were without effect. We conclude that susceptibility to mammalian signal peptidase is influenced both by the length of the hydrophobic region and by the secondary structure downstream of the cleavage site."
https://openalex.org/W1854286796,"The structure of the unactivated form of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase was refined at a resolution of 2.0 A to an R-factor of 17.1%. The previous model (Chapman et al., 1988) was extensively rebuilt, and the small subunit was retraced. The refined model consists of residues 22-63 and 69-467 of the large subunit and the complete small subunit. A striking feature of the model is that several loops have very high B-factors, probably representing mobile regions of the molecule. An examination of the intersubunit contacts shows that the L8S8 hexadecamer is composed of four L2 dimers. The dominant contacts between these L2 dimers are formed by the small subunits. This suggests that the small subunits may be essential for maintaining the integrity of the L8S8 structure. The active site shows differences between the unactivated form and the quaternary complex. In particular, Lys334 has moved out of the active site by about 10A. This residue lies on loop 6 of the alpha beta barrel, which is a particularly mobile loop. The site of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activation is well ordered in the absence of the carbamylation of Lys201 and Mg2+ binding. The residues are held poised by a network of hydrogen bonds. In the unactivated state, the active site is accessible to substrate binding."
https://openalex.org/W1544631191,"GTPase-activating protein (GAP) is a key regulator of the cellular Ras protein, which is implicated in oncogenic signal transduction pathways downstream of the viral Src (v-Src) kinase. Previous studies demonstrated that v-Src induces tyrosine phosphorylation of GAP, suggesting that GAP may provide a biochemical link between v-Src and Ras signaling pathways. To determine the precise residues in GAP phosphorylated by Src kinases, we used a baculovirus/insect cell expression system for investigating in vitro phosphorylation of GAP. Phosphopeptide mapping analysis revealed that v-Src and normal cellular Src (c-Src) phosphorylate tyrosine residues in bovine GAP at one major site and one minor site in vitro. Significantly, the major site of GAP phosphorylation in vitro is also the major site of in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation of GAP in rat fibroblasts transformed by v-Src. Analyses of GAP deletion mutants and TrpE-GAP fusion proteins established that Tyr-457 of bovine GAP (and the corresponding residue of rat and human GAP) is the major site of tyrosine phosphorylation. Our results demonstrate that the v-Src kinase induces phosphorylation of the same tyrosine residue of GAP in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that GAP is a direct substrate of activated Src kinases in vivo. Because epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylates the equivalent tyrosine residue in human GAP (Tyr-460), these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that specific phosphorylation of GAP at this site may have a physiologically important role in regulating mitogenic Ras signaling pathways."

This form dissociated during gel filtration chromatography being partially resolved into the M(r) 150,000 and 60,000 components; glutamyl-tRNA synthetase was associated with the larger polypeptide and prolyl-tRNA synthetase with the smaller component. Antibodies against the M(r) 60,000 polypeptide reacted with the M(r) 60,000 and 150,000 polypeptides. Gel filtration of extracts revealed multiple forms of prolyl- and glutamyl-tRNA synthetase. Antibody against the M(r) 60,000 component detected the M(r) 60,000 and 150,000 polypeptides throughout the chromatogram; these forms could be partially separated by polyethylene glycol fractionation. The M(r) 150,000 and 60,000 polypeptides were detected by Western blot analysis of crude extracts prepared under several conditions. Antibody to prolyl-tRNA synthetase reacted with a M(r) 150,000 polypeptide of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase core complex identified previously as glutamyl-tRNA synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1605069270,"The photoreactive fatty acid 11-m-diazirinophenoxy-[11-3H]undecanoate was shown to be taken up specifically by the fatty acid transport system expressed in Escherichia coli grown on oleate. This photoreactive fatty acid analogue was therefore used to identify proteins involved in fatty acid uptake in E. coli. The fadL protein was labeled by the probe, confirmed to be exclusively in the outer membrane and to exhibit the heat modifiable behavior typical of outer membrane proteins. The apparent pI of the incompletely denatured form of the protein having the mobility of a 33-kDa protein was 4.6 while that of the fully denatured form was consistent with the calculated value of 5.2. The denaturation was reversible depending upon the protein to detergent ratios. The photoreactive fatty acid partitions into the outer membrane, resulting in extensive photolabeling of the lipid; a high affinity fatty acid-binding site is not apparent in total membranes labeled using free fatty acids due to this large binding capacity of the outer membrane. However, when the free fatty acid concentration was controlled by supplying it as a bovine serum albumin complex, the fadL protein exhibited saturable high affinity fatty acid binding, having an apparent Kd for the probe of 63 nM. The methods described very readily identify fatty acid-binding proteins: the fact that even when the sensitivity was increased 500-fold, no evidence was found for the presence of a fatty acid-binding protein in the inner membrane is consistent with the proposal that fatty acid permeation across the plasma membrane is not protein mediated but occurs by a simple diffusive mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1851387143,"Crystals of the complex of bovine alpha-thrombin with recombinant hirudin variant 1 have space group C222(1) with cell constants a = 59.11, b = 102.62, and c = 143.26 A. The orientation and position of the thrombin component was determined by molecular replacement and the hirudin molecule was fit in 2 magnitude of Fo - magnitude of Fc electron density maps. The structure was refined by restrained least squares and simulated annealing to R = 0.161 at 2.8-A resolution. The binding of hirudin to thrombin is generally similar to that observed in the crystals of human thrombin-hirudin. Several differences in the interactions of the COOH-terminal polypeptide of hirudin, specifically of residues Asp-55h, Phe-56h, Glu-57h, and Glu-58h, and a few differences in the interactions of the hirudin core, specifically of residues Asp-5h, Ser-19h, and Asn-20h, with thrombin from human thrombin-hirudin suggest that there is some flexibility in the binding of these 2 molecules. Most of the residues in the 9 subsites that bind fibrinopeptide A7-16 to thrombin also interact with the NH2-terminal domain of hirudin. The S1 subsite is a notable exception in that only 1 of its 6 residues, namely Ser-214, interacts with hirudin. The only difference between human and bovine thrombins that appears to influence the binding of hirudin is the replacement of Lys-149E by an acidic glutamate in the bovine enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1569591775,"We employed a rapid fractionation method coupled with a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to quantify the globulins and avenins in developing and mature oat seeds. On a molar basis, there is approximately 10-11 times as much globulin as avenin. Pulse labeling of endosperm proteins indicated that the rate of globulin synthesis is approximately nine times that of avenin. In addition, neither protein class showed any signs of degradation during this experiment. Analysis of the storage protein mRNAs indicates that both globulin and avenin transcripts are associated with membrane-bound polysomes and are found in similar concentrations within the membrane-bound polysome fraction. We found that avenin and globulin mRNAs are fully loaded with ribosomes, suggesting that initiation is not rate-limiting for translation of either protein. Rates of globulin and avenin synthesis were similar when synthetic storage protein mRNAs were translated in vitro. Translation of equimolar amounts of globulin and avenin mRNAs in the same reaction showed equivalent amounts of protein synthesized when compared with globulin and avenin mRNAs translated in separate reaction mixes. We propose that translation elongation or termination reactions are likely regulatory steps for controlling storage protein synthesis in oat endosperm."
https://openalex.org/W1864040609,"Cultured mouse leukemia L1210 cells express the nucleoside-specific membrane transport processes designated es, ei, and cif. The es and ei processes are equilibrative, but may be distinguished by the high sensitivity of the former to 6-[(4-nitrobenzyl)thio]-9-beta-D-ribofuranosylpurine (NBMPR); the cif process is mediated by a Na+/nucleoside cotransporter of low sensitivity to NBMPR. Cells of an ei-deficient clonal line, L1210/MC5-1, were mutagenized, and clones were selected in soft agar medium that contained (i) NBMPR (an inhibitor of es processes), (ii) erythro-9-(2-hydorxy-3-nonyl)adenine (an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase), and (iii) arabinofuranosyladenine (a cytotoxic substrate for the three nucleotide transporters). The selection medium did not allow es activity and selected against cells that expressed the Na(+)-linked cif process. Cells of the L1210/B23.1 clonal isolate were deficient in cif transport activity, and inward fluxes of formycin B, a poorly metabolized analog of inosine, were virtually abolished by NBMPR in these cells. In the mutant cells, nonisotopic formycin B behaved as a countertransport substrate during influx of [3H]formycin B, and inward fluxes of the latter were competitively inhibited by purine and pyrimidine nucleosides. The transport behavior of L1210/B23.1 cells indicates that (i) the mutation/selection procedure impaired or deleted the Na(+)-linked cif process and (ii) es nucleoside transport activity is expressed in the mutant cells."
https://openalex.org/W1584041239,"The GTP binding (G) proteins of normal (FRTL5) and ras-transformed thyroid cells (KiKi) were characterized by cholera and pertussis toxin-induced ADP-ribosylation and immunoblot analysis. Two pertussis toxin substrates with molecular masses of 40 and 41 kDa were identified in normal cells as the alpha i2 and alpha i3 subunits. The molecular masses of the cholera toxin substrates were 42 and 45 kDa. The same cholera and pertussis toxin substrates were present in the K-ras-transformed cell line. However, the toxin-dependent ADP-ribosylation was markedly higher in KiKi than in normal cell membranes (more than 50-fold). The reason for this difference was investigated; it could not be explained by the relative amounts of G proteins in the two cell systems, since the levels of alpha i2 subunit as measured by quantitative immunoblot in K-ras-transformed cells were only slightly (65%) higher than in normal cells. The difference in ADP-ribosylation was not due to poly-ADP-ribosylation nor to a different degree of subunit dissociation of G proteins in the two cell lines. Rather, the enhanced ADP-ribosylation in K-ras-transformed cells appears to be due to the loss of an inhibitory factor present in the normal cells. Partial characterization indicates that such a factor is a peripheral membrane protein of less than 25 kDa capable of directly interfering with the ADP-ribosylation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1600803307,"The 13C NMR signals of methanofuran were assigned by two-dimensional 1H and 13C NMR experiments. On this basis, the incorporation of 13C-labeled acetate and pyruvate into methanofuran by growing cells of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum was analyzed by one- and two-dimensional 13C NMR experiments. The data were analyzed by a retrobiosynthetic approach based on a comparison of labeling patterns in a variety of metabolites. The data show that the furan ring is formed by condensation of two molecules from the pyruvate/triose pool. The tetracarbocylic acid moiety is assembled from ketoglutarate, two molecules of acetyl CoA, and one molecule of carbon dioxide."
https://openalex.org/W1494676621,"A brief exposure of quiescent, density-arrested Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) results in expression of the proto-oncogene c-fos; furthermore, the translation product of c-fos, p55fos, was shown to have increased stability in cells upon continued exposure to PDGF. The induction of competence or growth initiation requires a longer exposure to PDGF than that necessary for the induction of the immediate-early, growth-related genes. The need for the continued presence of PDGF for growth initiation beyond the time required for the induction of immediate-early gene expression may be due, in part, to PDGF-dependent post-translational stabilizations of gene products. We speculate that a PDGF-mediated event increases p55fos stability, resulting in a continued elevated level of Fos protein, which in turn allows a continued Fos-mediated activity required by Balb/c 3T3 cells to become competent to enter the cell cycle."
