Our comprehensive mapping of pharmacological space enables us to identify confidently the human targets for which chemical tools and drugs have been discovered to date. The integration of SAR data from diverse sources by unique canonical chemical structure, protein sequence and disease indication enables the construction of a ligand-target matrix to explore the global relationships between chemical structure and biological targets. Using the data matrix, we are able to catalog the links between proteins in chemical space as a polypharmacology interaction network. We demonstrate that probabilistic models can be used to predict pharmacology from a large knowledge base. The relationships between proteins, chemical structures and drug-like properties provide a framework for developing a probabilistic approach to drug discovery that can be exploited to increase research productivity."

In this study, we found that epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation increased the level of expression of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein survivin in breast cancer cells but not in normal mammary epithelial cells. We further demonstrated that activation of survivin gene expression is mediated by oxygen-independent hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α up-regulation in EGF-treated cancer cells. EGFR signaling activated the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathway, subsequently increasing the level of HIF-1α under normoxic conditions. HIF-1α then activated survivin gene transcription through direct binding to the survivin promoter. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of HIF-1α small interfering RNA blocks EGF-induced survivin gene up-regulation and increases apoptosis induced by the chemotherapy drug docetaxel. However, transfection of a plasmid expressing HIF-1α gene activates survivin gene expression and reduces the apoptotic response. Our results demonstrate a novel pathway for EGFR signaling-mediated apoptosis resistance in human cancer cells. Although the role of HIF-1α in regulating cell survival under hypoxic conditions has been studied extensively, our results show that normoxic breast cancer cells utilize cross-talk between EGFR signals and HIF-1α to up-regulate the anti-apoptotic survivin gene, providing a strong rationale for the targeting of HIF-1α as a therapeutic approach for both hypoxic and normoxic tumor cells. Understanding key molecular events in EGFR signaling-induced apoptosis resistance should provide new information for the development of novel therapeutic agents targeting EGFR, HIF-1α, and/or survivin.

Prior preclinical and clinical studies have shown that blocking the EGFR signaling via monoclonal antibodies or inhibition of the EGFR tyrosine kinase with small molecules reduces the growth of breast cancers and sensitizes responses to chemotherapy (8Baselga J.

Recently, we and others have shown that activation of the EGFR signaling pathway leads to the up-regulation of survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein family (11Asanuma H.

Survivin is broadly expressed in fetal tissues but is undetectable in the most normal adult tissues (15Altieri D.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). However, a high level of survivin is found in most common tumor types, including over 70% of human breast cancer tissues at all stages of cancer development (16Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3008) Google Scholar, 17Tanaka K. Iwamoto S. Gon G. Nohara T. Iwamoto M. Tanigawa N. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 127-134PubMed Google Scholar, 18Yang L. Cao Z. Yan H. Wood W.C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6815-6824PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that in breast cancer cells, levels of survivin expression correlate with susceptibility to apoptosis (17Tanaka K. Iwamoto S. Gon G. Nohara T. Iwamoto M. Tanigawa N. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 127-134PubMed Google Scholar). At present, the mechanism by which this up-regulation of survivin occurs in tumor cells having activated EGFR signaling is not fully understood. Recent studies have suggested, however, that activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway by EGFR signaling causes up-regulation of survivin expression (12Wang Q. Greene M.I. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2005; 79: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Qiu L. Wang Q. Di W. Jiang Q. Schefeller E. Derby S. Wanebo H. Yan B. Wan Y. Int. J. Oncol. 2005; 27: 823-830PubMed Google Scholar). It is still unknown how PI3K/AKT signaling leads to survivin gene transcription. Several studies have shown that under normoxic conditions, activation of EGFR signaling also increases the level of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) through the PI3K/AKT pathway (19Zhong H.

Chiles K. Mahon P.C. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3995-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). HIF-1α, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix-PAS protein family (22Semenza G.L. Agani F. Feldser D. Iyer N. Kotch L. Laughner E. Yu A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 475: 123-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), normally becomes highly up-regulated under hypoxic conditions, mostly as a result of inhibition of protein degradation. HIF-1α can then activate transcription of many genes that are critical for continued cellular function under hypoxic conditions (22Semenza G.L. Agani F. Feldser D. Iyer N. Kotch L. Laughner E. Yu A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 475: 123-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous study results have shown that survivin gene transcription is increased in hypoxic tumor cells (23Yang L. Cao Z. Li F. Post D.E. Van Meir E.G. Zhong H. Wood W.C. Gene Ther. 2004; 11: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Due to the combined results of these studies, we speculated that the observed EGFR signaling-induced survivin gene expression might be mediated by transcriptional activity of HIF-1α in an oxygen-independent manner. In this study, we examined the effects of EGFR activation on the apoptotic response and survivin gene expression in human breast cancer cells. We found that EGF stimulation increases survivin gene expression specifically in breast cancer but does not in normal breast cells. Up-regulation of survivin gene expression reduces apoptosis induced by the chemotherapeutic drug docetaxel. We also discovered that in breast cancer cells, EGF up-regulates the level of HIF-1α and that by down-regulation of HIF-1α using HIF-1α siRNA, we could significantly decrease those EGF-induced levels of survivin expression. Thus, cross-talk or a feedback loop between EGFR activation and HIF-1α expression is implied. Furthermore, we demonstrated direct binding of HIF-1α to the survivin promoter, which strongly suggests that EGF-activated survivin gene expression is indeed mediated by induction of transcriptional activity of HIF-1α under normoxic conditions. Cell Lines—Normal immortalized human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A and breast cancer cell lines SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640, and MCF-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (50:50; Mediatech) supplemented with 10 μg/ml of insulin. All of the above media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone, Logan, UT) as well as 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Mediatech Herndon, VA). MCF-10A cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml EGF, 500 ng/ml hydrocortisone, 100 ng/ml cholera toxin, 10 μg/ml insulin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 5% FBS. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) Cell Proliferation Assay—To measure the effects of EGF alone or in combination with docetaxel on breast cancer cells, 8 × 103 cells/well of MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 cells were plated in 96-well plates and cultured in the medium containing EGF and/or docetaxel (Aventis Pharma, Bridgewater, NJ) in various combinations of the drugs for 3 days. The percentage of viable cells in each well was examined by an MTT cell proliferation assay (Sigma), and the remaining viable cells were determined using Spectra Max Plus (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Transfection—Plasmids expressing a full-length HIF-1α cDNA gene were provided by Dr. Hua Zhong (Emory University, Atlanta, GA). The control empty pcDNA3 or pHIF-1α plasmids were transfected into cultured tumor or normal cell lines in 6-well tissue culture plates using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Some groups of the plasmid-transfected cells were treated with docetaxel in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml human EGF. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were collected for Western blot analysis to determine the levels of HIF-1α and survivin proteins or FACScan analysis for the percentage of the apoptotic cells. Apoptosis Assay—Cellular apoptosis was determined using Annexin V-phycoerythrin (PE) and 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) (BD Biosciences). SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 cells were treated for 3 days with 25 or 50 nm of docetaxel in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml EGF. Floating and adherent cells were labeled with Annexin V-PE and 7-AAD and then analyzed by FACScan (BD Biosciences) to determine the percentage of apoptotic cells. Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNAs were isolated using the RNA Bee kit (Tel-test, Friendswood, TX). Each 2-μg sample of RNA was amplified with the Omniscript RT kit using an oligo(dT) primer (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) to generate 20 μl of cDNAs. A 1–2-μl sample of the cDNA was then quantified by real time PCR using primer pairs for survivin or β-actin with SYBR Green PCR Master mix. Real time PCR was performed using the ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The primer pairs for detection of survivin gene expression were as follows: survivin forward, 5′-TCCACTGCCCCACTGAGAAC-3′; surviving reverse, 5′-TGGCTCCCAGCCTCCA-3′. These amplify a 77-nt PCR product located at nt 130–206 of the survivin mRNA. Amplification of the β-actin gene was used as an internal control for real time reverse transcription-PCR. The primer pair for the β-actin gene was as follows: forward, 5′-AAAGACCTGTACGCCAACACAGTGCTGTCTGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CGTCATACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATCTGC-3′, which generates a 219-nt PCR product from nt 870 to 1089 of the β-actin mRNA sequence. The quantity of PCR product generated from amplification of the survivin gene was standardized using the quantity of β-actin product for each sample to obtain a relative level of gene expression. Western Blot Analysis—For the various treatments described, cells were cultured in medium containing 10% serum and then changed to medium containing 2% serum or no serum when treated with 100 ng/ml human EGF (Invitrogen) and/or docetaxel. Inhibitors for PI3K (LY294002), MAPK (PD98059), and EGFR (AG1478) were obtained from Calbiochem. At the end of the assay, cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (18Yang L. Cao Z. Yan H. Wood W.C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6815-6824PubMed Google Scholar). The detection antibodies for phosphoserine 473 Akt, p44/p42 MAPK, XIAP, and cleaved caspase-3 were from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly, MA). Goat anti-human survivin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma) were also used. Caspase Activity Assay—Cells were treated with or without docetaxel, in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml human EGF, for a period of 2 days. Cells were collected, and their lysates were examined for caspase-3-like activity using a specific substrate, Ac-DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin, which detects the activities of caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-10, or caspase-9 activity using Ac-LEHD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin, according to a standard protocol (Calbiochem). The results were measured using a Spectra Max fluorescence microplate reader (Molecular Devices). For each experiment, control groups with specific caspase inhibitors, including caspase-3 inhibitor (benzyloxycarbonyl-DEVD-aldehyde; BD Biosciences) and caspase-9 inhibitor (benzyloxycarbonyl-LEHD-aldehyde; Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA), were done to ensure the specificity of the assay. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—To demonstrate direct binding of HIF-1α protein to the survivin promoter region in EGF-stimulated cancer cells, the SK-BR-3 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 4 h. After cross-linking chromatin with proteins by 1% of formaldehyde, the assay was performed using a ChIP assay kit from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA), according to the company's protocol. A monoclonal anti-HIF-1α antibody (BD Biosciences) was added to precipitate the protein-chromatin complexes. A PCR primer pair for amplification of a 230-nt survivin promoter fragment is as follows: forward primer, 5′-GCGTTCTTTGAAAGCAGT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ATCTGGCGGTTAATGGCG-3′. Modified McKay Assay—A core survivin promoter containing 269 nt of the 5′-flanking region of the survivin gene was cut out from a survivin promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid (pluc-cyc1.2) (23Yang L. Cao Z. Li F. Post D.E. Van Meir E.G. Zhong H. Wood W.C. Gene Ther. 2004; 11: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment containing six repeats of the hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was also cut from pBI-GL V6R plasmid (23Yang L. Cao Z. Li F. Post D.E. Van Meir E.G. Zhong H. Wood W.C. Gene Ther. 2004; 11: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) as a positive control. The purified promoter fragments were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). The radiolabeled promoter fragments were then incubated with nuclear extracts obtained from breast cancer cells treated with or without 100 ng/ml EGF in a 1× binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 12.5% glycerol, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol on ice for 1 h. Protein A-Sepharose beads conjugated with monoclonal anti-HIF-1α antibody were added to precipitate the protein-DNA complexes. After washing for three times with a 1× TE buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA, the final pellet was resuspended in a 0.1 m NaHCO3, 0.1% SDS, 1× sample buffer and heated to 65 °C for 2 min. Then the protein A-Sepharose beads were pelleted, and the supernatant was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.4% agarose gel followed by autoradiography to determine whether the EGF-induced HIF-1α protein had bound to the survivin promoter DNA fragments. Luciferase Assay—The effect of EGF stimulation on survivin promoter activity was determined in breast cancer cells after transfecting pluc cyc-1.2 plasmid, a survivin promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid (23Yang L. Cao Z. Li F. Post D.E. Van Meir E.G. Zhong H. Wood W.C. Gene Ther. 2004; 11: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), for 24 h, followed by EGF treatment for 4 h. A pRL-SV-40 plasmid that expresses a Renilla luciferase gene (Promega, Madison, WI) was also cotransfected for all studies as an internal control. To determine whether direct overexpression of the HIF-1α gene activates the survivin promoter, breast cancer and normal cells were cotransfected with pluc cyc-1.2 and pHIF-1α plasmids for 24 h. The ability of direct activation of HRE by EGF-induced HIF-1α was demonstrated using a MDA-MB-231 cell line, stably transfected with pBI-GL V6R plasmid containing six copies of HRE fragments of the VEGF gene and a firefly luciferase reporter gene (24Post D.E. Van Meir E.G. Gene Ther. 2001; 8: 1801-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) (provided by Dr. Hyunsuk Shim at Emory University). The transfected cells or MDA-MB-231 stable cells were cultured in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml of EGF for 45 min. After various treatments as described above, the promoter activity of the cell ysates was determined using a dual luciferase activity assay kit from Promega. Production of Adenoviral Vectors Expressing HIF-1α siRNA—Plasmid vectors containing either HIF-1α siRNA sequence 5′-CAGTGGATTACCACAGCTGA-3′ or survivin siRNA 5′-GGCTGGCTTCATCCACTGCCC-3′ were generated by cloning the synthesized oligonucleotide into pSilencer 2.1-U6 Neo plasmid (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Control pSilencer 2.1-U6 Neo plasmid vector containing a scrambled siRNA sequence, 5′-ACTACCGTTGTTATAGGTGT-3′, was obtained from the company. Adenoviral vectors expressing siRNA to HIF-1α and control siRNA were produced by cloning a HindIII-EcoRI fragment from pSilencer 2.1-U6 Neo plasmid, which contains a U6-promoter-siRNA cassette (HIF-1α or control siRNA), to a pcDNA3 HindIII-EcoRI site and then transferring the NotI-HindIII fragment from the pcDNA3 to the pAdtrack plasmid (25He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). After performing homologous recombination with an AdEasy adenoviral DNA backbone, the viral vectors were produced by transfecting into the human embryonic kidney cell line 293 (ATCC). The AdEasy system was provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein at The Johns Hopkins University. Additional vector amplification was also performed in the 293 cell line. High titer viral vectors were purified by centrifugation and CsCI banding. To determine the effect of down-regulation of HIF-1α on tumor cells, 2 × 105 tumor cells/well were first cultured in 6-well plates and then transduced with Ad HIF-1α siRNA or Ad Control siRNA vectors. 24 h after transduction, cells were cultured in serum-free medium overnight and treated with (or without) EGF for 45 min. Some groups received cotransfection of pSilencer HIF-1α siRNA and pHIF-1α plasmids to determine whether overexpression of HIF-1α gene could rescue HIF-1α siRNA-mediated down-regulation of survivin in EGF-treated cells. Last, collected cell lysates were examined for the levels of both HIF-1α and survivin by Western blot analysis. To examine the effect of EGF-induced HIF-1α and survivin on apoptotic death in breast cancer cells after docetaxel treatment, 5 × 104/well of MCF-7, SK-BR-3, and MDA-MB-231 cells were plated in 12-well tissue culture plates. Cells were then transduced with AdControl siRNA or AdHIF-1α siRNA vector. Some treatment groups were transfected with psilencer 2.1 U6-survivin siRNA plasmids. Following a 2-day treatment with docetaxel, the percentage of remaining viable cells was examined using an MTT cell proliferation assay. EGF Stimulation Decreased Docetaxel-induced Apoptotic Response in Breast Cancer Cells—In order to determine the effect of activation of the EGFR signaling pathway on the apoptotic response in human cancer cells, we treated the human breast cancer cell lines SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 with a chemotherapeutic drug, docetaxel, in the absence or presence of human recombinant EGF. Previous reports have shown that SK-BR-3 cells have high levels of EGFR and Her-2/neu expression, whereas MCF-7 cells express low levels of EGFR and Her-2/neu (26Camirand A. Zakikhani M. Young F. Pollak M. Breast Cancer Res. 2005; 7: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We chose those two cell lines to determine whether the levels of the EGF receptors present affect the EGF-induced apoptotic response. After treating the cancer cells with docetaxel in the absence or presence of EGF for 2 days, the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined using Annexin V-PE and 7-AAD staining followed by FACScan analysis. We found that the presence of EGF markedly decreased the percentage of apoptotic cell death induced by docetaxel. EGF treatment reduced the percentage of apoptotic cells present from 16 to 9% for MCF-7 cells and from 42 to 15% for SK-BR-3 cells (Fig. 1A). Additionally, we found that EGF decreased the rate of spontaneous apoptosis in both cell lines (Fig. 1A). Consistent with the results from the apoptosis assay, we found that EGF stimulation significantly decreased sensitivity of SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 cells to docetaxel as detected by the MTT cell proliferation assay (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we found that EGF-induced resistance to apoptosis was detected in breast cancer cell lines expressing both a high level of EGFR (SK-BR-3) and a low level of EGFR (MCF-7). To elucidate the mechanism of apoptosis resistance, we examined changes in regulation of apoptotic signals in EGF-stimulated cancer cells. Since caspase activation is a critical step in induction of apoptotic cell death, we first examined caspase-3-like and caspase-9 activities in MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 cell lines 2 days after docetaxel treatment. As expected, docetaxel increased these caspase activities in both tumor cell lines. However, in the presence of EGF, the docetaxel-induced caspase-3-like and caspase-9 activities were markedly inhibited (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the EGF-induced resistance to apoptosis by docetaxel is mediated through inhibition of caspase activity. EGF Up-regulates Survivin Expression in Human Breast Cancer Cells—It is well known that the IAPs block apoptotic signaling through inhibition of caspase activity (27Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Van Arsdale T. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). To determine whether IAPs play a role in inhibition of caspases in tumor cells having an activated EGFR signal, we examined changes in the level of an important IAP family protein, survivin, in both breast cancer and normal cell lines following EGF treatment. Our results from Western blot analysis demonstrated that EGF stimulation did increase the level of survivin protein in three breast cancer cell lines, including MDA-MB-231, SK-BR-3, and MCF-7 (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, survivin was not detected in the immortalized normal human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A, and EGF treatment failed to induce any survivin expression (Fig. 2A). To determine the mechanism of survivin up-regulation, we further examined survivin promoter activity and the level of survivin mRNA in EGF-treated cells. Using a luciferase reporter plasmid containing a 269-nt survivin core promoter fragment, we found a marked increase in survivin promoter activity in EGF-stimulated SK-BR-3 cells (Fig. 2B). Consistent with the level of survivin protein, survivin mRNA was elevated in the EGF-treated SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2C) detected by real time reverse transcription-PCR. Additionally, we found that treatment of the cells by docetaxel increases the levels of survivin gene expression. A combined effect of docetaxel and EGF treatment further increased the level of survivin gene expression (Fig. 2C). Determination of Signaling Pathways Responsible for EGF-induced Survivin Gene Up-regulation—It is well known that EGFR signaling leads to the activation of both PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways. We examined the roles of these pathways in the EGF-induced survivin expression in breast cancer cells. As expected, we observed increases in the levels of p-AKT and p44/42 MAPK in EGF-treated cells. Although the level of survivin expression was also up-regulated in those cells, the level of another IAP protein, XIAP, remained unaffected by EGF treatment (Fig. 3). After pretreatment of the cancer cells with either the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or the MAPK inhibitor PD98059, we were able to achieve marked reductions in the levels of p-AKT and p44/42 MAPK present in EGF-treated SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, we found that inhibition of p-AKT completely prevented EGF-up-regulated survivin expression in both the SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 cell lines (Fig. 3). However, we believe that activation of AKT is probably not required for maintaining a basal level of survivin expression in these cancer cells, since similar levels of survivin expression were detected in both control cells and cells treated only with PI3K inhibitor (Fig. 3). EGF stimulation also increased the level of p44/42 MAPK in SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 cell lines, with SK-BR-3 cells showing a very high level of up-regulation (Fig. 3). Blocking the MAPK pathway with PD98059 inhibited the level of p44/42 MAPK in both cell lines. The fact that a significant reduction of survivin was seen in the MAPK-blocked, EGF-treated SK-BR-3 cells suggests that both the AKT and MAPK pathways are involved in EGF-induced survivin up-regulation (Fig. 3). After treating the cancer cells with EGF in the absence or presence of the EGFR inhibitor AG1478, we found that AG1478 counteracted the effects of EGF on survivin expression in both SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 cells. However, AG1478 treatment alone had no significant effects on the basal levels of survivin protein in these cells (Fig. 3). EGF-induced HIF-1α Up-regulates Survivin Expression in Breast Cancer Cells—Previous reports have shown that activation of EGFR signaling can induce HIF-1α in human tumor cells under normoxic conditions (20Phillips R.J.

Nanog is a homeobox transcription factor required to maintain ES cells in a non-differentiated state. Using affinity purification coupled to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, we identified Sall4 as a Nanog co-purified protein. Co-immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pulldown experiments confirmed the interaction between Nanog and Sall4. We showed that Nanog and Sall4 co-occupied Nanog and Sall4 enhancer regions in living ES cells. Knockdown of Nanog or Sall4 by RNA interference led to a reduction in Nanog and Sall4 enhancer activities, providing evidence that these factors are positively regulating these enhancers. Importantly, co-transfection of Sall4 with these ES cell-specific enhancers led to transactivation in heterologous somatic cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments also showed that Sall4 co-occupied many Nanog binding sites in ES cells. Our data implicate Sall4 as an important component of the transcription regulatory networks in ES cells by cooperating with Nanog.

These cells are pluripotent as they exhibit the ability to differentiate into many of the specialized cell types (1Smith A.G. Ann. Rev. Cell Dev.

The maintenance of ES cells in a pluripotent state is mediated by a group of transcription factors that are preferentially expressed in the non-differentiated state (3Scholer H.R. Ruppert S.

Nanog, a homeodomain transcription factor, was identified as a factor that is able to sustain pluripotency in murine ES cells even in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (6Chambers I. Colby D.

The expression of Nanog is controlled by at least three transcription factors. The proximal promoter of Nanog contains an Oct-Sox motif and is bound by Oct4 and Sox2 (8Rodda D.J. Chew J.L. Lim L.H.

Oct4 and Sox2 are also key regulators for self-renewal of pluripotent ES cells (4Nichols J. Zevnik B. Anastassiadis K. Niwa H. Klewe-Nebenius D. Chambers I. Scholer H. Smith A. Cell. 1998; 95: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2688) Google Scholar, 5Avilion A.A. Nicolis S.K. Pevny L.H. Perez L. Vivian N. Lovell-Badge R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1811) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the tumor suppressor protein, p53, can also bind to the Nanog promoter after DNA damage to ES cells (10Lin T. Chao C. Saito S. Mazur S.J. Murphy M.E. Appella E. Xu Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Hence, it is proposed that upon DNA damage, p53 suppresses Nanog expression and triggers differentiation to maintain genomic stability. More recently, we identified a major Nanog binding locus within 5 kb upstream region of Nanog, and this provides evidence for a positive feedback loop (11Loh Y.H. Wu Q. Chew J.L. Vega V.B. Zhang W. Chen X. Bourque G. George J. Leong B. Liu J. Wong K.Y. Sung K.W. Lee C.W. Zhao X.D. Chiu K.P. Lipovich L. Kuznetsov V.A. Robson P. Stanton L.W. Wei C.L. Ruan Y. Lim B. Ng H.H. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar). It is, however, not clear if this Nanog-bound region plays any regulatory role. The transcription regulatory network for Nanog has been mapped in both murine and human ES cells (11Loh Y.H. Wu Q. Chew J.L. Vega V.B. Zhang W. Chen X. Bourque G. George J. Leong B. Liu J. Wong K.Y. Sung K.W. Lee C.W. Zhao X.D. Chiu K.P. Lipovich L. Kuznetsov V.A. Robson P. Stanton L.W. Wei C.L. Ruan Y. Lim B. Ng H.H. Nat.

Both studies showed that Nanog binds to genes with diverse functions. While there is a considerable amount of information on the downstream target genes of Nanog, little is known about the co-factor(s) that interact with Nanog to mediate transcription in ES cells. Here we report that Sall4, a member of spalt-like protein family, interacts with Nanog in vitro and exists as a complex with Nanog. Sall4 binds to the upstream enhancer of Nanog gene and can activate the enhancer in heterologous somatic cells. Depletion of Sall4 down-regulates this activity. Interestingly, Sall4 also binds to an intronic region of Sall4 and can activate this enhancer. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Sall4 also binds to genomic sites that are bound by Nanog. We suggest that the reciprocal regulation of Sall4 and Nanog by the Sall4 ·Nanog complex is important in governing pluripotency and self-renewal of ES cells. Co-immunoprecipitation—Transfected cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol with protease inhibitor mixture) for 1 h. Whole cell extracts were collected and precleared. The beads coated with antibodies were incubated with the precleared whole cell extracts 4 °C for overnight. The beads were washed with cell lysis buffer four times. Finally, the beads were incubated in the FLAG peptides, or the beads were boiled for 10 min. The eluents were analyzed by either protein staining or Western blot. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against Sall4 was raised against the first 200 amino acids of Sall4. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and RNA Expression Analysis—ChIP was performed as described previously (11Loh Y.H. Wu Q. Chew J.L. Vega V.B. Zhang W. Chen X. Bourque G. George J. Leong B. Liu J.

Wu Q. Chew J.L. Vega V.B. Zhang W. Chen X. Bourque G. George J. Leong B. Liu J. Wong K.Y. Sung K.W. Lee C.W. Zhao X.D. Chiu K.P. Lipovich L. Kuznetsov V.A. Robson P. Stanton L.W. Wei C.L. Ruan Y.

The sequences of the ChIP primers can be found in supplemental Table 2. siRNA-mediated Knockdown—The 19 nucleotides targeted by the siRNAs are GCAACCTGAAGGTACACTA (for Sall4–1), GCCTTTCGTGTGTAACATA (for Sall4–2), and GAACTATTCTTGCTTACAA (for Nanog). We obtained similar results for the two RNAi constructs for Sall4 knockdown. The RNAi experiments were carried out as described in Ref. 21Chew J.L. Loh Y.H. Zhang W. Chen X. Tam W.L. Yeap L.S. Li P. Ang Y.S. Lim B. Robson P. Ng H.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 6031-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar. To further understand the mechanism of how Nanog regulates transcription, we sought to identify the proteins that interact with Nanog in ES cells. We have previously generated a stable ES cell line that expresses FLAG-tagged Nanog (11Loh Y.H. Wu Q. Chew J.L. Vega V.B. Zhang W. Chen X. Bourque G. George J. Leong B. Liu J. Wong K.Y. Sung K.W. Lee C.W. Zhao X.D. Chiu K.P. Lipovich L. Kuznetsov V.A. Robson P. Stanton L.W. Wei C.L. Ruan Y. Lim B. Ng H.H. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar). The tagged Nanog appears to be functional as this line is resistant to differentiation upon leukemia inhibitory factor withdrawal or retinoic acid treatment. Cell extracts were prepared from this line and subjected to affinity purification using M2 FLAG antibodies. The eluent was fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Several protein bands were excised from the gel. After in-gel digestion, the tryptic peptides extracted from each gel band were subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Proteins in three of the bands were successfully identified (Fig. 1A and Supplemental Table 1). Sall4 was identified as a candidate Nanog-interacting protein. The other two bands contained peptide sequences from Nanog. Next, we performed co-IP experiments using ES cell nuclear extracts to confirm the interaction. Sall4 was found to co-precipitate with Nanog (Fig. 1B). The reciprocal co-IP experiment also showed that Nanog can be found in the Sall4 precipitate (Fig. 1C). In addition, we generated a stable ES cell line that expresses Sall4 tagged with three copies of hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (3HA-Sall4). Cell extracts from this cell line and control ES cells without epitope-tagged Sall4 were prepared. Immunoprecipitation using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody showed that Nanog co-immunoprecipitated with Sall4 (supplemental Fig. 1A). The reverse immunoprecipitation using anti-Nanog antibodies was also able to bring down HA-tagged Sall4 (supplemental Fig. 1B). These results confirmed that Sall4 indeed interacts with Nanog in murine ES cells. Sall4 contains three C2H2 zinc fingers and the N terminus has a C2HC motif (Fig. 1D). To determine which region of Sall4 interacts with Nanog, we co-transfected FLAG-tagged Nanog with each of the four Sall4 deletion constructs containing a V5 epitope tag into 293T cells. Co-IP assay with M2 FLAG antibodies showed that Sall4-FL and Sall4-N800 could interact with Nanog, whereas Sall4-C767 and Sall4-C567 failed to interact with Nanog (Fig. 1E). This indicates that the N-terminal region of Sall4 is required for the interaction with Nanog. All four Sall4 deletion mutants were localized in the nucleus (data not shown), hence this excludes the possibility that the lack of interaction is due to mislocalization of the Sall4 mutant protein to the cytoplasm. To determine the region that interacts with Sall4, we expressed and purified recombinant Nanog and fragments of Nanog as GST-fusion proteins (Fig. 1F) (13Pan G. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1401-1407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These proteins were immobilized onto GSH-Sepharose beads and incubated with extracts harvested from 293T cells overexpressing V5-tagged Sall4. The fragment containing only the N-terminal domain failed to pull down Sall4, whereas recombinant protein containing homeobox domain could interact with Sall4 (Fig. 1G). We have shown that Nanog binds to a region 5 kb upstream of the transcription start site of Nanog gene (Fig. 2A) (11Loh Y.H. Wu Q. Chew J.L. Vega V.B. Zhang W. Chen X. Bourque G. George J. Leong B. Liu J. Wong K.Y. Sung K.W. Lee C.W. Zhao X.D. Chiu K.P. Lipovich L. Kuznetsov V.A. Robson P. Stanton L.W. Wei C.L. Ruan Y. Lim B. Ng H.H. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether this region can serve as an enhancer, we cloned a 404-bp genomic fragment and inserted it upstream or downstream of a luciferase reporter driven by an Oct4 minimal promoter. The 428-bp Oct4 minimal promoter did not show ES cell-specific expression and had only very weak activity (data not shown). The two reporters with Nanog genomic sequence exhibited robust activities in ES cells but showed only background activities in human embryonic kidney 293T cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Hence, this sequence could function as an enhancer that operates both upstream and downstream of a promoter. We identified a sequence within this enhancer that interacts with Nanog in vitro (supplemental Fig. 2). Deletion of a 16-bp sequence containing this Nanog binding site abolished the enhancer activity (Fig. 2C). As Nanog was found to associate with Sall4 in our co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we examined whether Sall4 binds to this Nanog bound enhancer region by ChIP. Real-time PCR was performed using Nanog gene-specific primers to quantify the ChIP-enriched DNA. We found that Sall4 binds to the distal enhancer of Nanog gene (Fig. 2D). Mock GFP ChIP did not show any significant enrichment along this region. Importantly, the binding of Sall4 was reduced in cells expressing shRNA targeting Sall4 (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, we also confirmed the binding of Sall4 to this region in an ES stable cell line that expressed 3HA-tagged Sall4 (supplemental Fig. 3, A and B). This result suggests that Sall4 may regulate Nanog transcription in ES cells. Having established the interaction between Sall4 and the Nanog enhancer in vivo, we sought to understand the functional roles of Nanog and Sall4 on this enhancer. The Nanog enhancer-luciferase construct was co-transfected with either Sall4 or Nanog RNAi construct into ES cells (11Loh Y.H. Wu Q. Chew J.L. Vega V.B. Zhang W. Chen X. Bourque G. George J. Leong B. Liu J. Wong K.Y. Sung K.W. Lee C.W. Zhao X.D. Chiu K.P. Lipovich L. Kuznetsov V.A. Robson P. Stanton L.W. Wei C.L. Ruan Y. Lim B. Ng H.H. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar). RNAi was effective at reducing Sall4 levels in ES cells (supplemental Fig. 4). The luciferase assays showed that Sall4 or Nanog depletion could reduce the Nanog enhancer activity by more than 75%, whereas GFP and empty RNAi controls had no effect (Fig. 2E). We conclude that the Nanog enhancer activity is regulated by both Sall4 and Nanog. To address whether Nanog or Sall4 can independently activate the Nanog enhancer, we co-transfected Sall4 or Nanog expression construct along with the Nanog enhancer reporter in a heterologous cell-type that does not support ES cell-specific expression (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, Sall4 was able to transactivate this reporter in the 293T cells (Fig. 2F). However, the reporter could not be activated by Nanog (data not shown). We also did not observe synergistic activation of the reporter by Sall4 and Nanog in 293T cells (data not shown). Thus, it is likely that Sall4 and Nanog function independently to activate Nanog. Taken together, the data show that Nanog positively regulates its own enhancer and Sall4 is a novel regulator of Nanog in ES cells. Our previous genome-wide Nanog location study also identified a Nanog binding locus within the first intron of Sall4 (Fig. 3A). This raised the possibility that Nanog may regulate the Sall4 gene through the intronic site. Next, we investigated whether Nanog and Sall4 bind to this region by ChIP. Real-time PCR using Sall4 gene-specific primers showed that both Nanog and Sall4 have an enrichment peak at the same region, while a control ChIP showed no enrichment (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. 3C). We conclude that Nanog and Sall4 bind within the first intron of the Sall4 gene in living ES cells. To further characterize this Nanogand Sall4-bound region, we cloned a 441-bp Sall4 intronic region that showed the highest level of Nanog and Sall4 occupancies and fused it upstream or downstream of a luciferase gene driven by the Oct4 minimal promoter. We transfected these constructs into ES cells and 293T cells. Interestingly, this fragment showed robust activity in ES cells but only background activity in 293T cells, indicating that it can function as an enhancer in an ES cell-specific manner (Fig. 3C). A sequence within the Sall4 enhancer interacted with Nanog as revealed by EMSA (supplemental Fig. 2). Deletion of a 20-bp sequence containing this Nanog binding site abolished the enhancer activity (Fig. 3D). To confirm the regulatory role of Nanog and Sall4 on this Sall4 enhancer, an RNAi experiment was performed. The Sall4 enhancer reporter construct was co-transfected with Nanog or Sall4 RNAi plasmid into ES cells. The depletion of both Nanog and Sall4 reduced the Sall4 enhancer activity dramatically, whereas empty vector and GFP RNAi showed no effect (Fig. 3E). Finally, we co-expressed Sall4 or Nanog with the Sall4 enhancer construct in 293T cells (Fig. 3F). The luciferase reporter was activated by Sall4, while Nanog had no effect (data not shown). Hence, Sall4 alone is sufficient to activate this enhancer in a heterologous system. In summary, we showed the binding of Nanog and Sall4 to a Sall4 intronic region. This region is important for the activation of transcription and its enhancer activity is regulated by Nanog and Sall4 in ES cells. The co-binding of Nanog and Sall4 to both Nanog and Sall4 enhancer regions prompted us to examine more genomic sites for co-occupancies (Fig. 4A). We tested 22 known Nanog binding loci (11Loh Y.H. Wu Q. Chew J.L. Vega V.B. Zhang W. Chen X. Bourque G. George J. Leong B. Liu J. Wong K.Y. Sung K.W. Lee C.W. Zhao X.D. Chiu K.P. Lipovich L. Kuznetsov V.A. Robson P. Stanton L.W. Wei C.L. Ruan Y. Lim B. Ng H.H. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar) for the presence of Sall4 by ChIP. Real-time PCR results showed that all these loci were bound by Sall4 as well, while control ChIP using anti-GFP antibody gave only background enrichment. The binding of Sall4 to these genomic loci was also confirmed by anti-HA ChIP using extracts derived from a stable ES cell line that expresses HA-tagged Sall4 (supplemental Fig. 3D). We next compared the effects of RNAi-mediated Sall4 knockdown with knockdown of Oct4, Sox2, or Nanog in ES cells (supplemental Fig. 5, A and B). Depletion of Oct4 or Sox2 by siRNA induced morphological changes in ES cells. The resultant cells were fibroblastic with extensive cytoplasmic projections and some cells had enlarged nuclei typically of trophoblast giant-like cells (supplemental Fig. 5B). In contrast, knockdown of Sall4 and Nanog produced stellate-shaped cells with different morphologies compared with those Oct4-or Sox2-depleted cells. This observation suggests that Nanog and Sall4 are more functionally related to each other than Oct4 or Sox2. Analysis of expression of marker genes also revealed that Sall4 knockdown cells showed reduced levels of ES cell-specific gene expression and increased expression of differentiation-associated marker genes (supplemental Fig. 5C). The results indicate that Sall4 is important for maintaining the non-differentiated state of murine ES cells. The mammalian Sall4 gene encodes a spalt-like zinc finger transcription factor. Mutations of the human SALL4 gene are the cause of the human disease Okihiro syndrome (14Kohlhase J. Heinrich M. Schubert L. Liebers M. Kispert A. Laccone F. Turnpenny P. Winter R.M. Reardon W. Hum.

A recent study showed that Tbx5 regulates the Sall4 gene and interacts with Sall4 protein to regulate patterning and morphogenesis of forelimb and heart (17Koshiba-Takeuchi K. Takeuchi J.K. Arruda E.P. Kathiriya I.S. Mo R. Hui C.C. Srivastava D. Bruneau B.G. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The heterozygous Sall4 knock-out mice exhibit limb and heart defects that resemble the human disease. Sall4 is also known to be expressed predominantly in the ICM of early mouse embryos (18Yoshikawa T. Piao Y. Zhong J. Matoba R. Carter M.G. Wang Y. Goldberg I. Ko M.S. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2006; 6: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) as well as in embryonic carcinoma cells (14Kohlhase J. Heinrich M. Schubert L. Liebers M. Kispert A. Laccone F. Turnpenny P. Winter R.M. Reardon W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2979-2987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immuno-staining also revealed the presence of Sall4 in the trophectoderm (19Sakaki-Yumoto M. Kobayashi C. Sato A. Fujimura S. Matsumoto Y. Takasato M. Kodama T. Aburatani H. Asashima M. Yoshida N. Nishinakamura R. Development (Camb.). 2006; 133: 3005-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In adult tissues, Sall4 is predominantly expressed in testis and ovary (20Kohlhase J. Heinrich M. Liebers M. Frohlich Archangelo L. Reardon W. Kispert A. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2002; 98: 274-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Hence, Sall4 is likely to play different roles during development and in adult organism. Our data on the link between Sall4 and Nanog, a known regulator of ES cell pluripotency, suggest that Sall4 plays an important role in early development of mouse embryo and ES cells. Indeed, siRNA-mediated depletion of Sall4 in oocytes and ES cells led to developmental defects of early embryos. 7J. Zhang, W. L. Tam, G. Tong, Q. Wu, H. Y. Chan, B. S. Soh, Y. Lou, J. Yang, Y. Ma, L. Chai, H. H. Ng, T. Lufkin, P. Robson, and B. Lim, submitted for publication. This is in part due to the dysregulation of Oct4, which is another bona fide target of Sall4.7 Disruption of both alleles of Sall4 leads to embryonic lethality during peri-implantation (19Sakaki-Yumoto M. Kobayashi C. Sato A. Fujimura S. Matsumoto Y. Takasato M. Kodama T. Aburatani H. Asashima M. Yoshida N. Nishinakamura R.

The Sall4 null-ES cells also showed defect in proliferation in vitro, further highlighting the importance of Sall4 in maintenance of ES cells (19Sakaki-Yumoto M. Kobayashi C. Sato A. Fujimura S.

In this study, we showed that Sall4 associates with Nanog. This observation is intriguing as the Sall4·Nanog complex resembles the network configuration for the Oct4·Sox2 complex in several aspects. Oct4 and Sox2 are known to interact physically and co-occupy many sites in ES cells (11Loh Y.H. Wu Q. Chew J.L. Vega V.B. Zhang W. Chen X. Bourque G. George J. Leong B. Liu J. Wong K.Y. Sung K.W.

Cell. 2005; 122: 947-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3525) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found co-targeting of Nanog and Sall4 to many genomic sites. In addition, Sall4 and Nanog also bind to and regulate the respective regulatory regions of their own genes. The data suggest that Sall4 and Nanog employ autoregulatory feedforward loops to maintain their expression (Fig. 4B). This circuitry is very similar to the Oct4/Sox2 circuit that we proposed previously for murine ES cells (21Chew J.L. Loh Y.H. Zhang W. Chen X. Tam W.L. Yeap L.S. Li P. Ang Y.S. Lim B. Robson P. Ng H.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 6031-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we also detected the binding of Sall4 to Oct4 and Sox2 upstream regulatory sequences, which are bound by Nanog as well. Hence, our data uncovered an extensive usage of autoregulatory, feedforward connections in ES cells (Fig. 4C). It is conceivable that such circuitry confers stability in the expression of genes encoding for key transcription factors crucial for the maintenance of ES cells in the non-differentiated state. While we observed substantial levels of co-occupancy for Sall4 and Nanog, it should also be noted that the extent of co-occupancy at the whole genome level remains to be examined. As the sequence-specific DNA binding property of Sall4 has not been demonstrated in our study and is poorly documented in the literature, it is also possible that Sall4 serves a co-activator function in mediating transcription. Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and Sall4 are important in controlling the pluripotency of ES cells and their regulatory connections with each other are extensive. It should be emphasized that the role of each factor may differ with regards to the genes that each factor regulates and the lineage controlled by each factor. For example, the morphologies of cells after Nanog or Sall4 depletion appeared similar and are distinct from Oct4 or Sox2 depletion cells. This result suggests a parallel role of Nanog and Sall4 in maintaining murine ES cells. However, this does not exclude the possibility that Nanog and Sall4 may have distinct functions. It is likely that genome-wide location profiling and microarray analysis will further dissect out the regulatory networks governed by Sall4. It is also of interest to understand the biological differences among these key transcription factors that control ES cell pluripotency. We are grateful to Katty Kuay for technical assistance.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry was used to probe the footprints of byssal attachment plaques on glass cover slips for adhesive proteins. Besides the abundant mcfp-3 protein family (Zhao, H., Robertson, N. B., Jewhurst, S. A., and Waite, J. H. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 11090–11096), two new proteins, mcfp-5 and mcfp-6, with masses of 8.9 kDa and 11.6 kDa, respectively, were identified in footprints, partially characterized and completely sequenced from a cDNA library. mcfp-5 resembles mcfp-3 in its basic pI and abundant 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-l-alanine (Dopa; 30 mol %), but is distinct in two respects: it is more homogeneous in primary sequence and is polyphosphorylated. mcfp-6 is basic and contains a small amount of Dopa (<5 mol %). In contrast to mcfp-3 and -5, tyrosine prevails at 20 mol %, and cysteine is present at 11 mol %, one-third of which remains thiolate. Given the oxidative instability of Dopa and cysteine at pH 8.2 (seawater), we tested the hypothesis that thiols serve to scavenge dopaquinones by adduct formation. Plaque footprints were hydrolyzed and screened for cysteine dopaquinone adducts using phenylboronate affinity chromatography. 5-S-Cysteinyldopa was detected at nearly 1 mol %. The results suggest that mcfp-6 may provide a cohesive link between the surface-coupling Dopa-rich proteins and the bulk of the plaque proteins.

The results suggest that mcfp-6 may provide a cohesive link between the surface-coupling Dopa-rich proteins and the bulk of the plaque proteins. Mussels inhabit wind and wave swept rocky seashores. Such habitats are deathtraps for exposed organisms lacking a secure attachment. Accordingly, mussels have evolved a robust holdfast known as the byssus, which is essentially a specialized 4–5-cm long bundle of collagenous fibers that is proximally rooted in the mussel and distally bonded to foreign surfaces underwater by flattened attachment plaques (1Waite J.H. Holten-Andersen N. Jewhurst S.A. Sun C.J. J. Adhesion. 2005; 81: 297-317Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Given that engineering durable adhesive bonds between minerals and organic polymers in the presence of moisture remains a serious technological challenge, fundamental insights into the mechanism of holdfast adhesion in mussels and other sessile marine organisms represent a potential data base of bio-inspired solutions to the moisture problem (1Waite J.H. Holten-Andersen N. Jewhurst S.A. Sun C.J. J. Adhesion. 2005; 81: 297-317Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar). One popular technique for improving “wet” adhesion on siliceous substrates involves the application of surface-coupling agents or adhesion promoters (2Walker P. Wilson A.D. Nicholson J.W. Prosser H.J. Surface Coatings. 1. Elsevier Applied Science, New York1987: 189-232Google Scholar). Organosilanes are the best known synthetic adhesion promoters and typically designed with specific moieties for silica ligation at one end and reactivity toward the organic polymer at the other (2Walker P. Wilson A.D. Nicholson J.W. Prosser H.J. Surface Coatings. 1. Elsevier Applied Science, New York1987: 189-232Google Scholar). The use of surface-coupling agents to promote adhesion resonates with the adhesive biochemistry of byssal plaques made by mussels. A recent investigation of plaque footprints in Mytilus californianus has revealed a family of protein variants (mcfp-3) with a 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-l-alanine (Dopa) 2The abbreviations used are: Dopa, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine; Mfps, Mytilus foot proteins; mcfp-5 and mcfp-6, M. californianus foot protein 5 and 6; NBT, nitroblue tetrazolium; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization with time-of-flight; GdnCl, guanidine hydrochloride; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends.2The abbreviations used are: Dopa, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine; Mfps, Mytilus foot proteins; mcfp-5 and mcfp-6, M. californianus foot protein 5 and 6; NBT, nitroblue tetrazolium; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization with time-of-flight; GdnCl, guanidine hydrochloride; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. content that approaches 25 mol % (3Zhao H.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20183-20192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). With its many Dopa residues, mcfp-3 has been compared with a multifunctional surface-coupling agent (4Papov V.V. Diamond T.V. Biemann K. Waite J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20183-20192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). By forming bidentate coordination complexes with metal centers in metal oxide and mineral surfaces, the Dopa/surface interaction is stronger than any noncovalent interaction (5Dalsin J.L. Lin L. Tosatti S. Vörös J. Textor M. Messersmith P.B. Langmuir. 2005; 21: 640-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) and, unlike noncovalent interactions, not diminished by the large dielectric constant of water (6Israelachvili J.N. Intermolecular and Surface Forces. Academic Press, London1985: 12-23Google Scholar). If multiple Dopa side chains represent the surface-ligating moiety in mcfp-3, then there must also be another moiety that is specialized for reactivity with other plaque proteins. The present investigation was undertaken to determine whether there is a sidedness to the reactivity of mussel adhesive proteins with surfaces. In other words, if Dopa moieties of adsorbed proteins interact with the mineral surface, what interactions define their binding to other proteins in the adhesive plaque? Of the two new proteins detected in the footprints (mcfp-5 and mcfp-6), mcfp-6 is a thiol-rich protein that may mediate coupling of the surface proteins with those in the plaque by cysteinyldopa cross-links. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—MALDI-TOF examination of footprints and purified proteins was performed using a Voyager DE mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The MALDI matrix was prepared by dissolving sinapinic acid (10 mg/ml) in 50% acetonitrile. Footprints of byssal plaques were screened for proteins by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The technique as currently practiced involves the following: glass cover slips were collected shortly after plaque deposition. The cover slips were cleaned of slime and debris by washing thoroughly with Q-water after which the plaques were scraped off using a clean single-edge razor. The glass surface with the footprint residue was dried and mounted onto a MALDI sample plate with double stick tape. Two microliters of matrix mixture (30% sinapinic acid) were applied to the footprint and air-dried before subjecting to pulsed laser irradiation (4Papov V.V. Diamond T.V. Biemann K. Waite J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20183-20192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Singly and doubly charged peaks for apomyoglobin from horse (16,952.56, and 8476.78, respectively, for average masses) were used as internal calibrants. The purified footprint proteins derived thereof were dissolved in this matrix solution to give a final concentration between 1 and 10 pmol/μl. About 1 μl of this solution was applied to the target plate and allowed to evaporate. The sample spots were irradiated using an N2 laser (LSI, Inc., Cambridge, MA) with a wavelength of 337 nm, pulse width of 8 ns and operated at a repetition rate of 5 Hz. MALDI ionization generates protonated singly and doubly charged ions for the footprint proteins, which were accelerated using either 20 or 25 kV accelerating voltage. Protein Isolation from Adhesive Plaques—M. californianus were collected locally from Goleta pier at Santa Barbara, CA and immediately transferred to shallow tanks in the laboratory and maintained with running sea water. To collect the plaques for protein isolation, mussels were tethered onto plastic plates. After a couple of hours, mussels started deposition of plaques on the plastic plate. New plaques deposited within a 24-h period were delaminated using a clean single edge razor blaze and rinsed extensively with Milli-Q water to remove any salts. Collected plaques either were used immediately or stored at –80 °C for future protein isolation. Once 2 g of plaques were accumulated, they were homogenized on ice with 20 ml of 5% acetic acid and 8 m urea with protease inhibitors using a small hand-held tissue grinder (Kontes, Vineland, NJ). Supernatant was harvested by centrifugation for 40 min at 20,000 × g and 4 °C using SS-34 rotor. Ammonium sulfate was then added to give a final concentration of 20% for protein precipitation. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and dialyzed against 4 liters of Milli-Q water overnight at 4 °C. Dialysis resulted in mcfp-3 precipitation, which was removed by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was dialyzed against 5% acetic acid overnight and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon) to 1–2 ml. For each run, only 200 μl of the concentrated crude extract subjected to gel filtration on a Shodex-803 column (5 μm, 8 × 300 mm). The column was equilibrated and eluted with 5% acetic acid in 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid, and monitored at 280 nm (7Ohkawa K. Nishida A. Yamamoto H. Waite J.H. Biofouling. 2004; 20: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). When purifying mcfp-5 from the adhesive plaques, around 1 gram of the adhesive plaques collected was homogenized in 10 ml of 5% acetic acid buffered with 4 m GdnCl. Supernatant was harvested by centrifugation and filtered through a 0.22-μm microfilter from Millipore. The resulting supernatant was fractionated by reverse phase C8 HPLC using a 260 × 7 mm RP-300 Aquapore (Applied Biosciences) column eluted with a linear gradient of aqueous acetonitrile. Protein Isolation from the Mussel Feet—The phenol gland in the mussel foot where the adhesive precursor proteins are produced and stockpiled was also used for protein isolation. Live mussels were shucked, following which the foot was carefully dissected, arrayed on glass plates, and frozen at –80 °C. In preparation for protein extraction, the mussel feet were removed from the freezer and partially thawed. The outer, pigmented epithelium in mussel feet was flayed away with a scalpel. Underlying phenol glands were easily visualized from the ventral side and dissected. Dissected phenol glands were homogenized to a puree on ice in 5% acetic acid with protease inhibitors (10 μm leupeptin and pepstatin) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g and 4 °C. The pellet (P1) was saved for isolation of mcfp-5, while supernatant (S1) containing mcfp-1, -2, and -6 was acidified with 70% perchloric acid to a final concentration of 1.5%. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g, pellet (P2) was discarded and supernatant (S2) was decanted into a small beaker. Ammonium sulfate was then slowly added to a final concentration of 20% (w/v). The mixture was stirred for 40 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 20,000 × g and 4 °C for 30 min, and the resultant supernatant (S3) was collected and dialyzed against 4 liters of 5% acetic acid overnight using dialysis tubing with a molecular weight cutoff 1000 (Spectrum Industries, Los Angeles) with two changes of dialysis buffer, then freeze-dried. The lyophilized crude extract was resuspended in 2 ml of 5% acetic acid and run on a Shodex-803 column (5 μm, 8 × 300 mm), which was equilibrated and eluted with 5% acetic acid in 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid. Eluant was monitored at 280 nm. Fractions containing pure mcfp-6 were pooled and desalted by reversed phase C8 HPLC (260 × 7 mm RP-300 Aquapore, Applied Biosciences) column, which was eluted with a linear gradient of aqueous acetonitrile. Eluant was monitored continuously at 220 and 280 nm, and collected 1-ml fractions were assayed by amino acid analysis and electrophoresis following freeze-drying. To isolate mcfp-5, the pellet (P1) was homogenized with 5% acetic acid and 8 m urea. After centrifugation, supernatant was discarded and pellet was extracted again with 5% acetic acid containing 4 m GdnCl (8Waite J.H. Qin X. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2887-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The resulting supernatant was harvested by centrifugation and dialyzed against 4 liters of Milli-Q H2O. Dialysis resulted in proteins precipitated out that contained crude mcfp-5 and was harvested by centrifugation followed by redissolving in 2 ml of 5% acetic acid and 8 m urea. Because it was partially dissolved, the resultant crude extract was filtered through a 0.22-μm microfilter before loading onto a C8 column (260 × 7 mm RP-300 Aquapore, Applied Biosciences) by reverse phases HPLC eluted with a linear gradient of aqueous acetonitrile. Electrophoresis—Routine electrophoresis was done on polyacrylamide gels (7.5% acrylamide and 0.2% N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide) containing 5% acetic acid and 8 m urea (9Waite J.H. Benedict C.V. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 (Serva Fine Chemicals) and for Dopa-containing proteins by a redox-cycling method with nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) in 2 m glycinate buffer (10Paz M. Flückinger R. Boak A. Kagan H.M. Gallop P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 689-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To estimate the apparent molecular weight, purified footprint proteins were run on 15% SDS-PAGE. Amino Acid Analysis and Sequencing—Purified protein was hydrolyzed in 6 m HCl with 5% phenol in vacuo at 110 °C for 24 h. The hydrolysate was evaporated at 50 °C under vacuum and to dryness with a small volume of Milli-Q water and followed by methanol. Amino acid analysis was performed according to conditions described earlier with Beckman System 6300 Auto Analyzer (11Waite J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 258: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). O-Phosphoserine was identified by amino acid analysis and estimated after correcting for losses because of hydrolysis (12Stewart R.J. Weaver J.C. Morse D.E. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2004; 207: 4727-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequence of purified footprint proteins was determined by automated Edman degradation on a Porton Instruments Microsequencer (Model 2090, Porton, CA). Molecular Cloning—Total RNA was extracted from the phenol gland in M. californianus foot tip using the RNase Plant Mini kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Briefly, one freshly dissected foot tip was used, and Qiagen's protocols were followed after initial tissue disruption under liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle. Following that, mRNA was purified from total RNA with the Oligotex mRNA Mini kit from Qiagen. With purified mRNA, a cDNA library was constructed using the CloneMiner™ cDNA Library Construction Kit from Invitrogen. This cDNA library was a readily available source of cDNA. Based on the known N-terminal sequence of mcfp-5 and -6 (Y*DGY*SDGY*Y*P and GGGNY*RGY*, in which Y* denotes Dopa), degenerate primers forward, 5′-TAY GAY GGN TAY AGY/TCN GAY GGN TAY TAY CC-3′, and 5′-GGN GGN GGN AAY TAY CGN/AGR GGN TA-3′, were designed and coupled with an vector-encoded T7 universal primer to amplify the cDNA sequences of mature protein from cDNA library, respectively. PCRs were carried out in 25 μl of 1× Buffer B (Fisher) and 5 pmol of each primer, 5 μmol of each dNTP, 1 μl of first-strand reaction, and 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Fisher) for 32 cycles on a Robocycler (Stratagene). Each cycle consisted of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 52 °C, and 40 s at 72 °C, with a final extension of 5 min. The PCR products were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, purified, and cloned into a pCR4-TOPO vector with TOPO TA Cloning kit from Invitrogen and transformed into competent Top10 cells for amplification, purification, and sequencing. For 5′-end information, the GeneRacer kit from Invitrogen was used to obtain sequence information from full-length transcripts by a 5′-RACE strategy. PCR was performed with gene-specific primers (antisense 5′-ATT TAA CAC GTG TGA CTA ACT GCT ACC-3′ and 5′-AAT ATA GGC TCG CCT TTA GTA ACC-3′, which reversely primes C terminus of mcfp-5 and -6, respectively) and a GeneRacer 5′-primer from Invitrogen (sense 5′-CGA CTG GAG CAC GAG GAC ACT GA-3′). Cysteine Modification—Cysteine in mcfp-6 was modified by alkylation with iodoacetate (13Zhang J.G. Matthews J.M. Ward L.D. Simpson R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2380-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In brief, purified mcfp-6 was reconstituted in 50 ml of 50 mm ammonia bicarbonate and alkylated with 15 μl of 500 mm iodoacetate at room temperature for 40 min in the dark. Alkylated mcfp-6 was subjected to amino acid analysis post-hydrolysis. Cysteine was detected as carboxymethylcysteine, which ran at 9.5 min by amino acid analysis. Isolation of CysteinylDopa Cross-links—M. californianus footprints on glass coverslips were hydrolyzed in 6 m HCl with 5% phenol in vacuo at 110 °C for 1.5 h. Hydrolysates were flash-evaporated to dryness at 50 °C under vacuum with a small volume of Milli-Q water followed by methanol. The flash-evaporated hydrolysate was taken up in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), microcentrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g to remove insolubles, and applied to a pre-equlibrated phenylboronate column (Affi-Gel Boronate, Bio-Rad). Bound ligands on phenylboronate column were washed extensively with 100 mm phosphate buffer, and desalted by washing with 2.5 mm NH4HCO3 and Milli-Q water to facilitate subsequent amino acid analysis and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry described below. Fractions eluted with 5% acetic acid were lyophilized and subjected to a modified ninhydrin based amino acid analysis. Pure authentic 2- and 5-S-cysteinylDopa standards were donated by K. Wakamatsu (Fujita Health University) and detected by ion exchange amino acid analysis (see “Amino Acid Analysis and Sequencing”) with elution times at 47 and 54 min, respectively (14Zhao H. Sun C.J.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15915-15923Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cross-linking in Vitro—About 1 mg of mcfp-6 was resuspended in 400 μl of 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and mixed with mushroom polyphenol oxidase (Sigma, T7755, ≥2,000 units/mg) at an enzyme to protein at a ratio of 1:10 by weight (15Zhao H. Waite J.H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15915-15923Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Burzio L.A. Waite J.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11147-11153Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated at room temperature under constant stirring for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 6 m HCl. The resulting mixture was hydrolyzed in 6 m HCl with 5% phenol at 110 °C for 2 h in vacuo. The hydrolysate was flash-evaporated to dryness, redissoved in 1 ml of 50 mm phosphate buffer, and applied to phenylboronate column. Fractions eluted with 5% acetic acid were subjected to amino acid analysis for 5-S-cysteinylDopa. A control reaction was run using boiled enzyme (2 min). Phospholipase A2 Activity Assay—Detection of the phospholipase activity was performed following nondenaturing electrophoresis using a 5.5% polyacrylamide gel containing a lecithin emulsion at 33 mg of lecithin per ml of gel (17Shier W.T. Trotter J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 18Durkin J.P. Pickwell G.V. Trotter J.T. Shier W.T. Toxicon. 1981; 19: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Purified mcfp-6 was resuspended in 1 mm Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm EDTA at pH 7.4, and then loaded onto the lecithin-containing gel. Electrophoresis was carried out at a constant current of 20 mA at 4 °C for 2.5 h with 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm Tris, and 38 mm glycine pH 8.9. Phospholipase activity in gels was visualized as described by Shier & Trotter (17Shier W.T. Trotter J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, gels were incubated overnight at 37 °C with gentle shaking in a bath containing 100 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 20 mm CaCl2, and 5 μg/μl melittin diluted by 10% by volume with a 0.12% aqueous solution of rhodamine 6G. Afterward, the gels were extensively washed with Milli-Q water to remove the excess dye. The positive control was cobra phospholipase A2 (Sigma P6139); negative controls were the molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was recently exploited for in situ detection of proteins in the adhesive footprints of M. californianus (3Zhao H. Robertson N.B. Jewhurst S.A. Waite J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11090-11096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the present study we have extended this strategy to analyze footprint proteins in addition to mcfp-3. Mussels readily deposit adhesive plaques onto glass coverslips. Following removal of the adhesive plaques, the matrix-impregnated footprints were directly subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Although footprint spectra are dominated by the signal intensity of the mcfp-3 protein family characterized earlier, two new proteins were apparent by zooming in on the m/z range of 8000 to 13,000. The larger of the new proteins, mcfp-6, has a [M+H]+ of 11.6 kDa that falls between the two mcfp-3 dimers [2M+H]+ centered at 10.6 and 13 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1). The dense cluster of peaks centered at m/z 12,000 accumulated gradually after the peak at 11,600 formed, possibly suggesting matrix adducts. Another smaller protein, mcfp-5, was detected below these at 8.9 kDa (Fig. 1). Footprint Protein Characterization from Plaques—To more fully characterize the new footprint proteins, it was first necessary to isolate them from the plaques and, for more material, from the phenol gland in the mussel foot. Collected plaques were extracted sequentially with acid-urea and acid-GdnCl, respectively, according to details outlined under “Materials and Methods.” After precipitation by ammonium sulfate (20% w/v), the acid-urea extract was dialyzed against dilute acetic acid, concentrated, and fractionated by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 2B). Pure mcfp-6 fractions were identified by their mass on MALDI and pooled for biochemical characterization. In contrast, acid-GdnCl plaque extracts were enriched in mcfp-5, which could easily be purified by passage through C8 HPLC, eluting at 20 min (Fig. 2A). The composition of footprint proteins isolated from plaques was determined by amino acid analysis following hydrolysis (Table 1). Accordingly, nearly three-quarters of all residues in mcfp-5 are represented by glycine (24%), lysine (15%), and Dopa (30 mol %). In contrast, mcfp-6 has much less Dopa (<5 mol %), but elevated levels of glycine (14%), aspartate (14%), and tyrosine (20%) are noteworthy; cystine is present at 3.4% in mcfp-6. Both mcfp-5 and -6 contain some phospho-O-serine estimated between 3 and 5 mol %. N-terminal sequences (Figs. 3 and 5) for mcfp-5 and -6 are distinct, but Dopa occurs in both. The mobilities and staining properties with redox cycling on polyacrylamide gels of plaque-derived mcfp-5 and -6 are illustrated in Fig. 2.

Most co-extracted contaminants were precipitated by adding perchloric acid to 1.5% (v/v). Subsequent protein precipitation with ammonium sulfate led to the removal of remaining contaminants including mcfp-1 and -2. High purity mcfp-6 was thus easily prepared by gel filtration chromatography of the protein soluble in ammonium sulfate (Fig. 3B). Reversed phase HPLC confirmed the homogeneity of mcfp-6 (Fig. 3, C and D). In contrast to mcfp-6, isolation of mcfp-5 from the phenol gland required unusually aggressive conditions including sequential extraction with acetic acid, acid-urea, and acid-GdnCl. The sequential treatment removed most unwanted proteins, which simplified the chr"
https://openalex.org/W1982737710,"Plant cell walls are degraded by glycoside hydrolases that often contain noncatalytic carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), which potentiate degradation. There are currently 11 sequence-based cellulose-directed CBM families; however, the biological significance of the structural diversity displayed by these protein modules is uncertain. Here we interrogate the capacity of eight cellulose-binding CBMs to bind to cell walls. These modules target crystalline cellulose (type A) and are located in families 1, 2a, 3a, and 10 (CBM1, CBM2a, CBM3a, and CBM10, respectively); internal regions of amorphous cellulose (type B; CBM4-1, CBM17, CBM28); and the ends of cellulose chains (type C; CBM9-2). Type A CBMs bound particularly effectively to secondary cell walls, although they also recognized primary cell walls. Type A CBM2a and CBM10, derived from the same enzyme, displayed differential binding to cell walls depending upon cell type, tissue, and taxon of origin. Type B CBMs and the type C CBM displayed much weaker binding to cell walls than type A CBMs. CBM17 bound more extensively to cell walls than CBM4-1, even though these type B modules display similar binding to amorphous cellulose <i>in vitro</i>. The thickened primary cell walls of celery collenchyma showed significant binding by some type B modules, indicating that in these walls the cellulose chains do not form highly ordered crystalline structures. Pectate lyase treatment of sections resulted in an increased binding of cellulose-directed CBMs, demonstrating that decloaking cellulose microfibrils of pectic polymers can increase CBM access. The differential recognition of cell walls of diverse origin provides a biological rationale for the diversity of cellulose-directed CBMs that occur in cell wall hydrolases and conversely reveals the variety of cellulose microstructures in primary and secondary cell walls."
https://openalex.org/W2124582837,"Spontaneous action potentials in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) are necessary for normal circadian timing of behavior in mammals. The SCN exhibits a daily oscillation in spontaneous firing rate (SFR), but the ionic conductances controlling SFR and the relationship of SFR to subsequent circadian behavioral rhythms are not understood. We show that daily expression of the large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel (BK) in the SCN is controlled by the intrinsic circadian clock. BK channel-null mice (Kcnma1(-/-)) have increased SFRs in SCN neurons selectively at night and weak circadian amplitudes in multiple behaviors timed by the SCN. Kcnma1(-/-) mice show normal expression of clock genes such as Arntl (Bmal1), indicating a role for BK channels in SCN pacemaker output, rather than in intrinsic time-keeping. Our findings implicate BK channels as important regulators of the SFR and suggest that the SCN pacemaker governs the expression of circadian behavioral rhythms through SFR modulation."
https://openalex.org/W1990646890,"Upon exocytosis, synaptic vesicle proteins are released into the plasma membrane and have to be retrieved by compensatory endocytosis. When green fluorescent protein–labeled versions of the vesicle proteins synaptobrevin-2 and synaptotagmin-1 are overexpressed in rat hippocampal neurons, up to 30% are found on axonal membranes under resting conditions. To test whether and to what extent these plasma membrane–stranded proteins participate in exo-endocytic cycling, a new proteolytic approach was used to visualize the fate of newly exocytosed proteins separately from that of the plasma membrane–stranded ones. We found that both pools were mixed and that endocytosed vesicles were largely composed of previously stranded molecules. The degree of nonidentity of vesicular proteins exo- and endocytosed depended on stimulus duration. By using an antibody to the external domain of synaptotagmin-1, we estimated that under physiological conditions a few percent of vesicular proteins were located near the active zone, from where they were preferentially recycled upon stimulation."

To further examine the role of Nedd4-2 in the regulation of ENaC by AMPK, we studied the effects of AMPK activation on ENaC currents in Xenopus oocytes co-expressing ENaC and wild-type (WT) or mutant forms of Nedd4-2. ENaC inhibition by AMPK was preserved in oocytes expressing WT Nedd4-2 but blocked in oocytes expressing either a dominant-negative (DN) or constitutively active (CA) Nedd4-2 mutant, suggesting that AMPK-dependent modulation of Nedd4-2 function is involved. Similar experiments utilizing WT or mutant forms of the serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK1), modulators of protein kinase A (PKA), or extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) did not affect ENaC inhibition by AMPK, suggesting that these pathways known to modulate the Nedd4-2-ENaC interaction are not responsible. AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 expressed in HEK-293 cells occurred both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a potential mechanism for modulation of Nedd4-2 and thus cellular ENaC activity. Moreover, cellular AMPK activation significantly enhanced the interaction of the β-ENaC subunit with Nedd4-2, as measured by co-immunoprecipitation assays in HEK-293 cells. In summary, these results suggest a novel mechanism for ENaC regulation in which AMPK promotes ENaC-Nedd4-2 interaction, thereby inhibiting ENaC by increasing Nedd4-2-dependent ENaC retrieval from the plasma membrane.

Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). This channel plays a major role in the regulation of total body salt and volume homeostasis, blood pressure, and airway surface liquid clearance. ENaC is comprised of three structurally similar α-, β-, and γ-subunits, whose full-length forms are ∼90–95 kDa in size. Each subunit has two presumed transmembrane domains, a large extracellular loop, and cytoplasmic N and C termini (1Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). ENaC expressed in oocytes has a presumed α2β1γ1 stoichiometry (2Firsov D. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Schild L.

ENaC can be identified by its sensitivity to the diuretic amiloride, its ohmic current-voltage relationship, and its high selectivity for conductance of Na+ and Li+ over K+ (1Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar).ENaC is regulated by the actions of several hormones, including aldosterone, vasopressin, and insulin, as well as various non-hormonal mechanisms. Cellular mechanisms that control ENaC activity include the regulation of channel synthesis, intracellular trafficking, membrane insertion and retrieval, and single channel properties (1Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). In addition, recent work suggests that intracellular cleavage of ENaC α- and γ-subunits in the biogenesis pathway by proteases such as furin (forming active subunits of ∼65 and ∼75 kDa, respectively) plays a critical role in the regulation of cellular ENaC activity (6Hughey R.P.

SGK1 is stimulated through aldosterone-induced transcription or through activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway. SGK1 phosphorylates Nedd4-2 at two key residues, Ser-338 and Ser-444 in Xenopus Nedd4-2 (xNedd4-2) (18Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Munster C. Chraibi A.

Disruption of the ENaC-Nedd4-2 interaction by naturally occurring gain-of-function mutations involving the PY motif in the ENaC tail can cause Liddle's syndrome, a disease characterized by hypertension, volume expansion, and hypokalemia (21Kamynina E.

The associated reduction in ENaC ubiquitination increases ENaC stability and expression at the plasma membrane. PKA also phosphorylates Nedd4-2 at the same residues to inhibit ENaC internalization and may also promote increased delivery and insertion of ENaC into the plasma membrane (14Snyder P.M. Olson D.R.

In recent years, the metabolic sensor AMPK has emerged as a potential mediator for transport-metabolism coupling, as this kinase has been shown to regulate nutrient transporters and Cl– and Na+ channels (28Hallows K.R. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2005; 14: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).AMPK is a ubiquitous metabolic-sensing Ser/Thr kinase that exists as a heterotrimer composed of a catalytic α-subunit and regulatory β- and γ-subunits. Its activity increases during conditions of cellular metabolic stress, in response to elevated intracellular AMP:ATP ratios (29Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev.

AMPK appears to act as a key sensor of cellular energy homeostasis that oppositely regulates energy-utilizing and energy-generating metabolic pathways. In addition, AMPK has been implicated in the regulation of a rapidly growing list of other important cellular functions, including cell growth, apoptosis, inflammation, gene transcription, and protein synthesis (32Hardie D.G.

AMPK inhibited ENaC expression at the plasma membrane in oocytes. This inhibition was blocked with expression of a β-ENaC mutant that disrupts the binding of Nedd4-2 to ENaC, suggesting that Nedd4-2 plays a central role in the ENaC inhibition by AMPK (37Carattino M.D. Edinger R.S. Grieser H.J. Wise R. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Johnson J.P. Kleyman T.R. Hallows K.R. J. Biol.

Our findings suggest that AMPK activation enhances the rate of ENaC retrieval from the plasma membrane and that Nedd4-2 plays a pivotal role in the AMPK-dependent inhibition of ENaC. Nedd4-2 also serves as a target for AMPK-dependent phosphorylation. Moreover, cellular AMPK activation enhances the association of Nedd4-2 and ENaC, thereby providing a plausible mechanism for enhanced ENaC turnover at the plasma membrane and inhibition by AMPK.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Chemicals—All chemicals used were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted.

Mutations in Presenilin, the catalytic core of this complex, cause Alzheimer disease. Little is known about the structure of the protein and even less about the catalytic mechanism, which involves proteolytic cleavage in the hydrophobic environment of the cell membrane. It is basically unclear how water, needed to perform hydrolysis, is provided to this reaction. Presenilin transmembrane domains 6 and 7 seem critical in this regard, as each bears a critical aspartate contributing to catalytic activity. Current models imply that both aspartyl groups should closely oppose each other and have access to water. This is, however, still to be experimentally verified. Here, we have performed cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of both domains and have demonstrated that several of the introduced residues are exposed to water, providing experimental evidence for the existence of a water-filled cavity in the catalytic core of Presenilin. In addition, we have demonstrated that the two aspartates reside within this cavity and are opposed to each other in the native complex. We have also identified the conserved tyrosine 389 as a critical partner in the catalytic mechanism. Several additional amino acid substitutions affect differentially the processing of γ-secretase substrates, implying that they contribute to enzyme specificity.

More than 150 mutations in Presenilin 1 and 10 mutations in Presenilin 2 have been associated with Alzheimer disease (for a list of the mutations, see molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations), demonstrating their pivotal role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Presenilins are critical for the γ-secretase cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) that generates the amyloid β peptide (Aβ) (3De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H.

Furthermore, inhibitor profiling studies have provided evidence for at least one additional substrate binding site on Presenilin, distinct from, but in close proximity to, the catalytic site (17Annaert W.G.

Structure-function studies of the γ-secretase complex are not easy to perform because of its hydrophobic nature and its sensitivity to membrane lipid composition and detergent extraction procedures. This explains why most of our knowledge of the catalytic activity of the complex is based on indirect evidence and assumptions. For instance, hydrolysis of peptide bonds requires that the active catalytic site of the protease have access to water within the lipid bilayer, but no formal proof for this assumption has been provided in the case of Presenilin. To probe experimentally the microenvironment of the catalytic site of Presenilin, we employed cysteine-scanning mutagenesis, a method widely used to investigate the structural features of polytopic membrane proteins (reviewed in Refs. 20 and 21). The principle involves substitution of amino acid residues of interest with cysteine, which is average in size and thus normally quite well tolerated and amenable to highly specific modification with sulfhydryl-directed reagents. Combination of membrane-permeable and -impermeable reagents can provide valuable information about the extracellular or cytosolic position of a cysteine (22Feramisco J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J.

Preparation of Cell Lysates and Immunoblotting—Total cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). After centrifugation at 13000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, 20 μg of protein from the post-nuclear extracts were separated on 4-12% BisTris gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and then blocked and probed with antibodies as indicated. For detection, horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) were used followed by chemiluminescence detection with Renaissance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Quantifications were performed by means of densitometry. Labeling with Thiol-specific Reagents—MEFs in 100-mm plates were washed three times in cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) followed by incubation with 200 μm EZ-Link biotin-HPDP (N-[6-(biotinamido)hexyl]-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)-propionamide (Pierce) for 45 min at 4 °C. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed and 500 μg of protein were incubated with 35 μl of immobilized NeutrAvidin protein beads (Pierce) at 4 °C overnight. After extensive washing, the proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in Nu-Page sample buffer. For cross-linking experiments, membrane aliquots were treated for 20 min at 4 °C with 200 μm 3,6-dioxaoctane-1,8-diyl bismethanethiosulfonate or 1,2-ethanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate (in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors) with or without pretreatment with 10 mm NEM/10 mm EDTA. The cross-linking reaction was quenched with NEM, and extracts were prepared in Nu-Page sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol and separated on a 7% Tris acetate gel. Statistical Analysis—Data from three independent experiments were used for calculations (S.E. values of the mean are indicated), which were then subjected to one-way analysis of variance with a Bonferroni correction to determine their significance. Transduction with APP Adenovirus-Urea Gel Electrophoresis—Subconfluent stable MEF cell lines were transduced with the recombinant adenovirus Ad5/cytomegalovirus-APP bearing human APP-695 (33Yuan H.

A similar volume sample was used for the determination of the amount of secreted APP fragments (APPs) by SDS-PAGE and direct Western blotting with the polyclonal antibody 22C11 (Chemicon). The remaining conditioned medium (equal volumes) was immunoprecipitated overnight with mAb B7/8 raised against the N terminus of the Aβ sequence (34De Strooper B. Simons M. Multhaup G. Van Leuven F. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4932-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After extensive washing, the bound material was eluted from the beads by boiling for 10 min in sample buffer (0.74 m BisTris, 0.32 m Bicine, 0.88 m sucrose, 2% SDS, and 0.015% bromphenol blue) and was loaded on a 12%T/5%C (%T, percentage (w/v) of total acrylamide monomer; %C, percentage (w/v) of bisacrylamide/total acrylamide monomer) Bicine/Tris SDS-PAGE gel containing 8 m urea (35Wiltfang J.

Separation was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 2 h at a constant current of 24 mA/gel and was followed by Western blotting and visualization of the Aβ species with mAb WO2. ELISA—For the measurement of secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42, specific ELISA kits (The Genetics Company) were used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Analysis of Notch Processing—Subconfluent MEF cell lines were infected with the Ad5/dE1dE2a/cytomegalovirus Myc-tagged Notch ΔE adenovirus (36Michiels F. van Es H. van Rompaey L. Merchiers P.

Samples of 10 μg of total protein were separated on a 7% Tris acetate gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with the appropriate antibodies to assess the levels of Notch ΔE infection and NICD production, respectively. Blue Native Gel Electrophoresis—This method was performed as described previously (37Nyabi O. Bentahir M. Horre K. Herreman A. Gottardi-Littell N. Van Broeckhoven C. Merchiers P. Spittaels K. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43430-43436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), with the exception that the samples (20 μg) were separated on a 5-16% polyacrylamide gradient at a constant voltage of 200 for 3.5 h. Generation of a Cysteine-less PS1—Mouse PS1 contains five endogenous cysteines (Fig. 1A), which we replaced with alanine using site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting “cysteine-less” (Cys-less) PS1 was able to rescue the maturation of Nicastrin and the stabilization of PEN-2, as well as the accumulation of unprocessed APP C-terminal fragments in PS1-/- PS2-/- fibroblasts (Fig. 1B). Further functional characterization of the Cys-less PS1 revealed that it has a similar rescuing activity to the wild-type PS protein in PS1-/- PS2-/- fibroblasts as far as it concerns the in vivo processing of three major γ-secretase substrates, APP (Fig. 1C), N-cadherin, and Notch (data not shown). Transmembrane domains 6 and 7 contain the putative catalytically active aspartates and therefore likely contribute structurally also to the catalytic site of PS1. Alignment of these domains from various species (supplemental Fig. S1) revealed, apart from the two catalytic aspartates, several other highly conserved amino acids that could be involved in substrate binding, in catalysis, or in delineating a hypothetical interior water-containing chamber in the complex (38Lazarov V.K. Fraering P.C. Ye W. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. Li H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6889-6894Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We, therefore, substituted these residues one by one with cysteines and generated stably transfected PS1-/- PS2-/- fibroblast cell lines with the mutants in a similar manner as the cysteine-less PS1 (Fig. 1C). Two mutations (G382C and K395C) resulted in impaired PS1 endoproteolysis, but all 22 mutants were nevertheless able to rescue the stabilization of PEN-2 and the maturation of Nicastrin. In addition, we also substituted the catalytic aspartic residues, both individually and in combination, without again perturbing the ability of PS1 to stabilize the other γ-secretase components (Fig. 1D). Water Accessibility of Introduced Cysteines and Disulfide Cross-linking—Recent electron microscopy studies have shown that an electrolucent channel is present in the interior of the γ-secretase complex. Our primary aim was to investigate biochemically whether such a postulated “hydrophilic pocket” (38Lazarov V.K. Fraering P.C. Ye W. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. Li H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6889-6894Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) indeed exists and to delineate the amino acid residues exposed to it. We used the membrane-permeable reagent EZ-link biotin-HPDP, which readily reacts via its pyridyldithiol moiety with free sulfhydryl (-SH) groups exposed to water. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, of 10 different residues in TM6 tested, only W247C was labeled. In TM7, in contrast, 6 of 11 introduced cysteines showed reactivity with biotin-HPDP. In addition, PS1 D385C in TM7 was modified, whereas the D257C mutant in TM6, which represents the putative second catalytic aspartate of PS1, was not modified in our assay. However, in order for the aspartic residues to perform substrate cleavage, they should be in close proximity to each other and be exposed to a hydrophilic environment. To investigate this further, we used a specific disulfide cross-linking strategy in the cell line expressing the double mutant PS1 D257C/D385C. We chose two homobifunctional alkylthiosulfonates of the type depicted in Fig. 2C (3,6-dioxaoctane-1,8-diyl bismethanethiosulfonate and 1,2-ethanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate with spacer arm lengths 13 and 5.2 Å, respectively), which react selectively with -SH groups, resulting in the formation of disulfide bridges between two cysteines and the spacer arm of the cross-linker. This reaction can only take place when the cysteines have free sulfhydryl groups accessible to water and are located at a maximum distance from each other equal to the length of the spacer arm of the cross-linker. Membrane extracts from PS1 D257C/D385C cells treated with either of the two cross-linkers at 4 °C (to reduce protein molecular motions) and separated in SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions displayed a band running at an apparent molecular weight close to full-length PS1 (Fig. 2D). Because this band could be stained with antibodies specific for both PS1 NTF and CTF, we propose that it reflects an intramolecular cross-linking product between the two cysteines replacing the aspartates in TMs 6 and 7. The disulfide bond causes an expected shift in mobility compared with the full-length unprocessed protein, because it prevents complete unfolding under non-reducing conditions. When the free sulfhydryls are blocked with the alkylating agent NEM prior to the cross-linking reaction (Fig. 2D, lanes labeled with + NEM) or when reducing conditions are applied (data not shown), this band is not observed confirming its specificity. Furthermore, no cross-linked products are observed with Cys-less PS1, single D257C and D385C PS1 mutants, or a control mutant with two cysteines at remote positions in TMs 1 and 9. Note also that no band derived from intermolecular cross-linking of two different PS1 molecules was observed in any case under our experimental conditions. This experiment demonstrates that, in the tertiary structure of PS1, cysteines introduced at the positions of the catalytic aspartic residues are both accessible to water, facing each other with a maximal distance of ∼5.2 Å. Activity of the Mutants on APP Processing—We next investigated whether any of the cysteine substitutions influences the γ-secretase processing of APP. As shown in Fig. 3A, APP-CTF fragments generated by α-secretase from endogenously expressed APP (the direct substrate for γ-secretase) accumulate in PS knock-out fibroblasts. This phenotype could be completely rescued by reintroduction of wild-type or Cys-less PS1 in these cells, but not, as expected, by PS1 bearing either the D257C and D385C mutations or each of the substitutions G382C, G384C, F388C, Y389C, or K395C. Therefore, these residues seem to be particularly important for the activity of the protease. After transduction of the fibroblasts with full-length APP695Swe and direct quantification of the Aβ produced by ELISA (Fig. 3B), we observed that, indeed, three of the mutants (G382C, G384C, and K395C) were causing a total loss of function with regard to Aβ generation. Interestingly, the Y389C mutation displayed residual activity (∼10% Aβ40 production compared with the Cys-less PS1) but no detectable Aβ42 production. The remaining mutants can be divided into three categories: 1) the ones that reduce the production of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 (S254C, V261C), 2) those that cause a significant decrease in the levels of Aβ40 with minor effects on Aβ42 (T245C, Y256C, F388C), and 3) those that produce amounts of Aβ similar to the wild-type or Cys-less PS1 (all of the rest). Strikingly, none of these mutations seemed to severely affect the ratio of Aβ42/40 produced (Fig. 3B), with the exception of Y256C and F388C, which, due to a dramatic reduction in Aβ40, behaved like extreme “clinical” familial Alzheimer disease mutations (with 4.5- and 6-fold increase in the ratio, respectively, compared with Cys-less PS1). The effect observed for some of the mutations in the individual production of Aβ40 and Aβ42 was also independently confirmed by urea gel electrophoresis (supplemental Fig. S2). Effects of the Mutations on the Processing of Other Substrates—Next, we analyzed the behavior of the cysteine mutants in the processing of N-cadherin. Similar to APP, the C-terminal fragment of N-cadherin generated by metalloprotease cleavage accumulated in PS-deficient cells. This knock-out phenotype was not rescued by the T245C, S254C, Y256C, V261C, G382C, G384C, F388C, Y389C, K395C, and the catalytic D257C and D385C mutants (Fig. 4A). Finally, the production of NICD (Notch intracellular domain) from a membrane-tethered form of Notch (Myc-tagged Notch ΔE) was investigated (Fig. 4B). Similar to APP and N-cadherin, PS1 bearing the G382C, G384C, Y389C, or K395C mutations were unable to support any NICD production. Minimal activity was, however, also seen with the T245C, S254C, Y256C, and V261C mutants in contrast to what we observed for APP. In addition, three mutants appeared to increase Notch processing significantly (W247C, L250C, and L258C). Finally, and important in the context of the question of whether APP and Notch processing can be specifically modulated by γ-secretase, the F388C substitution, which caused a remarkable decrease in the levels of Aβ40, did not affect significantly the production of NICD. To verify that the observed effects on the processing of different substrates were not a consequence of deficient γ-secretase complex formation, we confirmed the integrity of the complexes by blue native gel electrophoresis (supplemental Fig. S3). In the present study, we have reported our efforts to investigate the catalytic site of PS1 by cysteine-scanning mutagenesis. A primary prerequisite for the use of this technique is the generation of a protein lacking all endogenous cysteines but retaining the structure and functional properties of the wild-type molecule. Although clinical mutations have been identified at three of the five endogenous cysteines in PS1 (C92S, C263F/R, C410Y) (39Tedde A. Nacmias B. Ciantelli M. Forleo P. Cellini E. Bagnoli S. Piccini C.

Genet. 1995; 4: 2373-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), we have found that, under our experimental conditions, their substitution to alanine does not affect γ-secretase cleavage of the three substrates (APP, Notch, and N-cadherin) examined here. Thus, these mutations seem to be well tolerated and do not affect significantly the structure of PS1, as assessed in our cell biological experiments. Recently, Kornilova et al. (42Kornilova A.Y. Kim J. Laudon H. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7598-7604Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have suggested that cysteines Cys-92, -410, and -419 may contribute to the active site of PS1. However, they did not check to what extent their replacement with serine (or alanine) interferes with this function. This together with significant methodological differences might explain the discrepancies between their findings and the findings in the current study. Although we cannot exclude entirely at this moment that the cysteine substitutions in PS1 might indeed affect the activity of the complex in other assays (e.g. cell-free"

Although essential for a correct understanding of structure-function relationships, its exact topology remains an issue of strong controversy. We revisited presenilin-1 topology by inserting glycosylation consensus sequences in human PS1 and expressing the obtained mutants in a presenilin-1 and 2 knock-out background. Based on the glycosylation status of these variants we provide evidence that presenilin-1 traffics through the Golgi after a conformational change induced by complex assembly. Based on our glycosylation variants of presenilin-1 we hypothesize that complex assembly occurs during transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, our data indicate that presenilin-1 has a nine-transmembrane domain topology with the COOH terminus exposed to the lumen/extracellular surface. This topology is independently underscored by lysine mutagenesis, cell surface biotinylation, and cysteine derivation strategies and is compatible with the different physiological functions assigned to presenilin-1.

Kopan R. Science. 2004; 305: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The catalytic component, PS1, is a polytopic membrane protein that undergoes endoproteolysis resulting in stable PS1 NH2- and COOH-terminal fragments (PS1-NTF and -CTF). According to the Kyte-Doolittle plot, PS1 has ten hydrophobic regions (HR) (5Annaert W. De Strooper B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), but it is unclear how many of these cross the lipid bilayer as transmembrane domains (TMDs) (6Kim J. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 905-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A widely accepted model proposes eight TMDs (HR I to VI, VIII, and IX) with the NH2-COOH terminus and the hydrophilic loop domain between TMD 6 and 7, all facing the cytosol (Fig. 1A). All published models agree that the first six HR cross the membrane, implying a consensus for the topology of the PS1-NTF. In contrast, divergent proposals exist for the number of TMDs in the PS1-CTF (7Li X. Greenwald I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7109-7114Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 8Dewji N.N. Valdez D. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Several of these models are difficult to reconcile with the different physiological roles assigned to PS1, such as the location of the aspartate residues in HRVI and VIII or the cytosolic-oriented loop domain required for β-catenin binding (4Wolfe M.S. Kopan R. Science. 2004; 305: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 11Kang D.E. Soriano S. Xia X. Eberhart C.G. De Strooper B. Zheng H. Koo E.H. Cell. 2002; 110: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the exact topology of PS1 is therefore of pivotal importance to understanding its multiple roles. In this report, we revisited the trafficking and topology of PS1 using glycosylation consensus sequences inserted at different positions in human PS1 (hPS1). Expression of these mutants in PS1 and 2 knock-out (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) allowed us to evaluate the glycosylation status of these variants, and hence the topology, without interference of endogenous PS. Combined with a cysteine derivation strategy we provide strong evidence for a 9-TMD model (Fig. 1B) that includes three TMDs in the PS1-CTF and a luminal/extracellular COOH terminus. This model is not only in agreement with recent findings (12Oh Y.S. Turner R.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11821-11828Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13Laudon H. Hansson E.M. Melen K.

We also demonstrate that this topology is maintained throughout the secretory pathway. Finally, our data lead us to suggest that γ-secretase complex formation precedes passage through the Golgi. Cloning of the PS1 Constructs and Generation of Stable MEF Lines—A pCDNA3 vector encoding human PS1 with an Escherichia coli leader peptidase sequence inserted at codon 241 was obtained from Dr. Nakai (9Nakai T.

This sequence, coding for amino acids FSRRNGGEATSGFFEVPKNETKENGIRLSERKETLGDVTL and bearing a glycosylation consensus sequence (indicated in bold), was PCR amplified using primers with NheI and BglII restriction sites. Next, NheI or BglII sites were introduced at codon positions 128, 192, 370, 400 of human PS1 by in vitro mutagenesis (Stratagene) and used to insert the E. coli leader peptidase sequence. These PS1glyc cDNAs were BamHI/SalI subcloned from pBluescript into a pMSCV vector (Clontech) with an extended polylinker. Alternatively, NGT sites at codon positions 52 and 463 or L429-L430 to HH substitution were introduced in pMSCV/human PS1 using site-directed XL mutagenesis (Stratagene). All mutants were verified by sequencing. pMSCV constructs were co-transfected with helper plasmid pIK Ecopac in human embryonic kidney 293 cells for packaging in retroviruses. Retroviruses were harvested, and snap-frozen aliquots were stored at -80 °C until use. MEF PS1-/-PS2-/- cells were transduced with retrovirus for 24 h followed by puromycin selection in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum until stable lines were obtained. Antibodies and Chemicals—pAb against mouse PS1 (B19.2, B32.1), human PS1 (B14.5), APP (B63.1), PEN-2 (B95.1), and NCT (B59.1) and mAb against NCT (9C3) are described (14Annaert W.G. Levesque L.

Kifunensine and swainsonine were from Calbiochem and Sigma, respectively. Deglycosylation Experiment—Glycoproteins (like NCT) were differentially deglycosylated by treatment with either endoglycosidase F or endoglycosidase H (endoH) to distinguish immature from mature glycosylation. MEFs were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged (800 × g, 10 min), and lysed in 100 mm phosphate buffer (+0.1% SDS, 0.5% Triton-X100, 0.5% β-mercapto-ethanol, protease inhibitors), pH 5.7 or pH 7.4 (for endoH or endoglycosidase F treatment (Roche Applied Science), respectively). Lysates were denatured (10 min, 70 °C) and incubated with endoH (1 unit/50 μl, 18 h, 37 °C) or endoglycosidase F (1 unit/50 μl) and analyzed by SDSPAGE on 4-12% Tris-acetate gels in MES buffer (Invitrogen) and Western blotting. Detection was with chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer). Cell Surface Biotinylation—NHS-SS-biotin (0.5 mg/ml; Pierce) was used for cell surface biotinylation, and biotinylated proteins were isolated using streptavidin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) followed by Western blotting. Analysis of APP processing using metabolic labeling and blue native gel electrophoresis was done as described (15Nyabi O. Bentahir M. Horre K. Herreman A. Gottardi-Littell N. Van Broeckhoven C.

Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells were incubated at 37 or 20 °C (3 h) (to block TGN exit) and fixed (20 min) in 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy using a Zeiss Radiance 2100 connected to an upright Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope. Acquisition was done with Lasersharp2000 and finally processed by Adobe Photoshop (16Esselens C. Oorschot V. Baert V. Raemaekers T. Spittaels K. Serneels L. Zheng H. Saftig P. De Strooper B. Klumperman J. Annaert W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 1041-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Cysteine Derivation—The Cys- PS1 and subsequent cysteine re-introductions were done using the (Multi) site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For labeling with thiol-reactive reagents, MEFs were incubated on ice with either 200 μm (in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) membrane-permeable EZ-Link Biotin-HPDP (Pierce), or 300 μm membrane-impermeable TS Biotin-X ethylenediamine (Biotium) for 45 min. After washing, cells were lysed in solubilization buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. Biotinylated proteins were captured using immobilized NeutrAvidin beads (Pierce) at 4 °C overnight, and the bound material was eluted by heating in Nu-Page sample buffer followed by SDS-PAGE on a 4-12% BisTris gel (Invitrogen). On-line Supplemental Material—Supplemental Fig. S1 demonstrates a cytosolic-oriented NH2 terminus and hydrophilic loop between HR VI and VIII of PS1. PS1glyc241 is N-Glycosylated and Restores γ-Secretase Activity—Because PS1 is not post-translationally modified by N-glycosylation, we introduced glycosylation consensus motifs into hPS1 and expressed these variants in PS1 and 2 KO MEFs using retroviral transduction (15Nyabi O. Bentahir M. Horre K. Herreman A. Gottardi-Littell N. Van Broeckhoven C. Merchiers P. Spittaels K. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43430-43436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Importantly, selected stable cell lines express mutant PS1 at levels equal or even lower than endogenous PS1, avoiding artifacts caused by high overexpression systems (data not shown, and e.g. Fig. 4A). Moreover, by using PS1 and 2 KO MEFs, no interference is expected from endogenous PS, which could otherwise be a concern because PS1 fragments may exist as dimers and therefore give rise to hybrid PS1 complexes (17Schroeter E.H. Ilagan M.X. Brunkan A.L. Hecimovic S. Li Y.M. Xu M. Lewis H.D. Saxena M.T. De Strooper B. Coonrod A. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Moore C.L. Goate A. Wolfe M.S. Shearman M. Kopan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13075-13080Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The minimal requirement for N-glycosylation is an NXT/S motif. Most hPS1 variants with this motif introduced in a luminal loop domain did not show N-glycosylation. This can be explained by the fact that a distance of at least 10 amino acids from any TMD is required for efficient glycosylation (18Hendriks G. Koudijs M. van Balkom B.W. Oorschot V. Klumperman J. Deen P.M. van der Sluijs P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2975-2983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), a requirement that is not reached in most hPS1 luminal loop domains. Alternatively, we used a hydrophilic 40-amino acid glycosylation consensus sequence derived from the E. coli leader peptidase (hPS1glyc variants, thick bar in Fig. 1) that becomes efficiently glycosylated when fused to PS1 fragments (9Nakai T. Yamasaki A. Sakaguchi M. Kosaka K. Mihara K. Amaya Y. Miura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23647-23658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This sequence was introduced at codon 241 (Fig. 1A, hPS1glyc241). Stable expression resulted in partial endoproteolysis of hPS1glyc241 (Fig. 2A). Both PS1-FL (full-length) and PS1-NTF have a lower mobility in SDS-PAGE, as expected from the 40-amino acid insertion, but treatment with endoH resulted in a shift that is not observed in wild-type (WT) or PS1 and 2 KO MEFs rescued with hPS1. Thus, hPS1glyc241 is N-glycosylated, implying that the loop between HR V and VI is luminal. hPS1glyc241 partially rescued NCT maturation, largely stabilized PEN-2 levels, reduced APP-CTF accumulation to WT levels (Fig. 2A), and partially restored Aβ secretion (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that hPS1glyc241 is functional. Blue native gel electrophoresis demonstrated that hPS1glyc241, like WT hPS1, assembles in a 440-kDa complex (Fig. 2C). In contrast to NCT, hPS1glyc241 remained fully endoH sensitive, indicating that it did not acquire complex glycosylation in the Golgi. When we treated hPS1glyc241 MEFs with brefeldin A, a drug known to redistribute Golgi enzymes to the ER, NCT as well as hPS1glyc241-FL and -NTF (Fig. 2A, inset) became mature glycosylated. Thus, the incorporated leader peptidase sequence is sufficient for complex glycosylation. One possible explanation is that the hPS1glyc241 fraction that passes the Golgi is below the detection limit in total extracts. Because a small post-Golgi pool of PS1 resides at the plasmalemma (19Kaether C. Lammich S. Edbauer D. Ertl M. Rietdorf J. Capell A. Steiner H. Haass C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 20Rechards M. Xia W. Oorschot V.M. Selkoe D.J. Klumperman J. Traffic. 2003; 4: 553-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we analyzed this fraction by cell surface biotinylation on hPS1glyc241 MEFs. As for WT PS1, a fraction of hPS1glyc241 (8 ± 2%, n = 3) binds to streptavidin beads (Fig. 2D), indicating that this insertion does not disturb the trafficking of hPS1glyc241 to the cell surface. Surprisingly, this pool remained endoH sensitive, suggesting that the immature N-glycosylated chain generated in the ER is not modified further by glycosylation enzymes present in the Golgi apparatus. There are two main possibilities that could explain these observations. First, the N-glycosylation site on codon 241 is not accessible for further modification and complex glycosylation once hPS1glyc241 passes through the Golgi apparatus. The brefeldin A experiments suggest that hPS1glyc241 can acquire mature glycosylation as long as it is located in the ER. It is tempting to speculate that this masking of the N-glycosylation site could be caused by the incorporation of hPS1glyc241 in the γ-secretase complex. In this case, endoHsensitive glycosylation in the ER occurs, but complex assembly prior to reaching the medial/trans Golgi cisternae prevents further glycosyl modification. This is reminiscent of NCT, which undergoes a conformational change associated with complex assembly (21Shirotani K. Edbauer D. Capell A. Schmitz J. Steiner H. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16474-16477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2hPS1glyc241 is N-glycosylated and restoresγ-secretase activity. A, cell extracts of MEF WT, PS1 and 2 KO MEF, hPS1glyc241, and hPS1WT rescued lines were not (-), endoH-(H), and endoglycosidase F-treated (F). Endoglycosidase F treatment completely removes oligosaccharide chains from glycoproteins, whereas endoH only removes oligosaccharides that still bear free high mannose residues and are not yet further modified by mannosidase I and II and N-acetylglucosamine transferase. Modification by these enzymes renders the bond between the two N-acetylglycosamines in the core resistant to endoH treatment. Because these modifications occur beyond cis-Golgi cisternae, endoH treatment provides a readout for the ratio of mature versus immature glycosylation and hence the transport between ER and Golgi. Western blot revealed that hPS1glyc241 is N-glycosylated but remains endoH sensitive, is partially endoproteolysed (°), and partially rescues NCT maturation, PEN-2 stability, and APP-CTF processing. Treatment with 5 μg/ml brefeldin A (3 h) (right) generates an endoH-resistant fraction (*), proving that the consensus sequence is sufficient for complex glycosylation. B, PS1 and 2 KO, hPS1WT, and hPS1glyc241 MEFs were virally transduced with APPswedish, followed by metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation of APP and secreted Aβ. Phosphorimaging analysis indicates a partial rescue of Aβ secretion by hPS1glyc241. C, blue native gel electrophoresis shows the incorporation of hPS1glyc241 and hPS1WT in a 440-kDa complex. D, cell surface biotinylation showing that endoH-sensitive hPS1glyc241 resides at the cell surface.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Alternatively, we cannot exclude the possibility that hPS1glyc241 “bypasses” the Golgi on its way to the cell surface, as suggested for instance for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (22Yoo J.S.

Goutebroze L. Denisenko-Nehrbass N. Girault J.A. Faivre-Sarrailh C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48339-48347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and more recently the yeast protein Ist2p (24Juschke C. Wachter A. Schwappach B. Seedorf M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To investigate this, we introduced a glycosylation consensus sequence in every predicted luminal domain of PS1. A hPS1glyc variant displaying endoH resistance would then confirm the first model, i.e. the trafficking of PS1 via the conventional route through the Golgi. hPS1 Glycosylation Variants Necessitate a Re-evaluation of PS1 Topology—In Fig. 3, A and B, we analyzed the PS1 and 2 KO MEF lines expressing hPS1glyc or hPS1NGT variants. Next to codon 241 we introduced the leader peptidase sequence in the first (codon 128) and second (codon 192) luminal loop domain and the NGT motif in the hydrophilic PS1 NH2 terminus (codon 52). Insertions in the first luminal loop dramatically interfered with PS1 stability, because protein expression (including FL) was never detected despite a stable introduction of the viral vector (data not shown). Interestingly, this region bears FAD-linked mutations and is, together with the HR I, critical for the interaction with APP and telencephalin (25Annaert W.G. Esselens C. Baert V. Boeve C. Snellings G. Cupers P. Craessaerts K. De Strooper B. Neuron. 2001; 32: 579-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Interference with the structural integrity of this region may therefore not be tolerated. For all other variants, we compared control and endoH-treated extracts and analyzed their effect on NCT maturation and APP-CTF as a correlate for rescue of γ-secretase assembly and activity. hPS1NGT52 is fully endoproteolysed and restores NCT maturation and APP-CTF processing. However, no glycosylation was observed in agreement with the cytosolic location of the NH2 terminus. The glycosylation variant hPS1glyc192 is mainly expressed as a FL protein with very low endoproteolysis and no significant rescuing capacity, reminiscent of dominant-negative aspartate mutants (15Nyabi O. Bentahir M. Horre K. Herreman A. Gottardi-Littell N. Van Broeckhoven C. Merchiers P. Spittaels K. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43430-43436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the holo- and PS1-NTF are (endoH-sensitive) glycosylated, indicating luminal orientation in the ER. Overall, the results with the 52, 192, and 241 mutants are entirely consistent with previous models proposing the existence of six TMDs and a cytosolic NH2 terminus in PS1-NTF. Next we visited the topology of the PS1-CTF. First, glycosylation sequences introduced in hPS1-CTF (Fig. 3, hPS1glyc370, -glyc400, and -NGT463) did not compromise endoproteolysis (panel B versus panel A), suggesting that “presenilinase” activity depends more on the structural integrity of the NTF. Modifying this integrity may, for instance, affect its interaction with PEN-2, which is suggested to trigger endoproteolysis (26Kim S.H. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1992-2001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Second, and despite complete endoproteolysis, NCT maturation and APP-CTF processing were weakly restored (Fig. 3B). For hPS1glyc370 this is unexpected because the hydrophilic loop domain is dispensable for γ-secretase activity (11Kang D.E. Soriano S. Xia X. Eberhart C.G. De Strooper B. Zheng H. Koo E.H. Cell. 2002; 110: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We assume that the very low expression levels of hPS1glyc370 are insufficient for rescue. More importantly, hPS1glyc370 mobility was not affected by endoH treatment, confirming the cytosolic orientation of the large loop region. Finally, hPS1glyc400 was particularly informative as it is the only variant that acquired partial endoH resistance, thus suggesting Golgi passage. We next treated hPS1glyc400 MEFs with 1 μg/ml kifunensine or swainsonine, drugs that inhibit cis- or medial-Golgilocalized mannosidase I and II, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3C, the endoH-resistant fraction disappeared after each treatment, demonstrating that hPS1glyc400 passes through cis- and medial-Golgi. Further proof came from experiments in which we incubated HeLa cells at 20 °C to block exit from the TGN (27Ladinsky M.S. Wu C.C. McIntosh S. McIntosh J.R. Howell K.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2810-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In controls (37 °C), hardly any endogenous PS1 and NCT colocalized with galactosyltransferase, a trans Golgi enzyme (Fig. 3E, 37 °C). However, after a 3-h incubation at 20 °C, small amounts of endogenous PS1 and NCT colocalized clearly with galactosyltransferase in the TGN (Fig. 3E, 20 °C). Thus, a first major conclusion is that PS1 travels via the conventional route from the ER via the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface. This further supports our hypothesis that the incorporation of PS1 into the γ-secretase complex occurs prior to entering the Golgi. Because proper assembly of the γ-secretase complex is a prerequisite for its function in post-Golgi compartments, it is not unlikely that this assembly is tightly regulated both spatially and temporarily. The secondary quality control system in ER and Golgi compartments includes such a mechanism that retrieves unassembled subunits or incompletely assembled complexes from the Golgi through interactions with sorting motifs/signals on individual subunits (28Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). During multimeric assembly, such signals become masked, allowing transport of the assembled complex through the Golgi as has been demonstrated for potassium channels (29Heusser K. Schwappach B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2005; 15: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although such sorting signals have not yet been clearly identified for γ-secretase components, with the possible exception of PS1 (30Kaether C. Capell A. Edbauer D. Winkler E. Novak B. Steiner H. Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4738-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), several findings may link ER-Golgi sorting to assembly. First, the slow kinetics of complex glycosylation of NCT (31Herreman A. Van Gassen G. Bentahir M. Nyabi O. Craessaerts K. Mueller U. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and the enrichment of endogenous PS1 in coatomer protein complex I (COPI)-coated membranes (20Rechards M. Xia W. Oorschot V.M. Selkoe D.J. Klumperman J. Traffic. 2003; 4: 553-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) already suggest that these components reside and/or recycle in early compartments for an extended period. Furthermore, using a cellfree ER budding assay, Kim et al. (32Kim J. Hamamoto S. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7758-7768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the PS1 holoprotein is the principle PS1 species packaged into COPII vesicles, suggesting that PS1 processing, an event likely to precede complete complex assembly, occurs in distal compartments such as the intermediate compartment and cis-Golgi. This seems to contradict the findings of Capell et al. (33Capell A. Beher D. Prokop S. Steiner H. Kaether C. Shearman M.S. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6471-6478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) who argued, solely based on introducing a dilysine motif in NCT, that complete assembly of the γ-secretase complex occurs within the ER. We believe, however, that this is not correctly interpreted because a-KKXX motif does not mediate ER retention but rather retrieval from cis-Golgi and other compartments through binding to COPI coat components (34Lee M.C. Miller E.A. Goldberg J. Orci L. Schekman R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 87-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Hence, this extends the sites for assembly to the intermediate and cis-Golgi compartments. However, definitive proof that complex assembly in early compartments may drive forward transport through the Golgi is lacking. We anticipate that such evidence will emerge from the identification of sorting motifs in individual γ-secretase components or interactions with proteins regulating sorting between the ER and Golgi. A New Topology Model for PS1-CTF—To further investigate PS1-CTF topology, we introduced an NGT motif in the extreme PS1 COOH terminus. This hPS1NGT463 rescued NCT maturation, complex formation, and APP-CTF processing (Fig. 3, B and D) and acquired full (endoH-sensitive) N-glycosylation. This observation precludes a cytosolic orientation of the COOH terminus, contrary to what is generally assumed (Fig. 1A), and now places the COOH terminus at the luminal side (Fig. 1B) in agreement with the proposal of Oh and Turner (35Oh Y.S. Turner R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C576-C581Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The N-glycosylation of both hPS1glyc400 and hPS1NGT463 precludes the existence of two TMDs in the PS1-CTF but predicts either one TMD (HR VIII) or three TMDs (HR VIII, IX, and X) (Fig. 1). To distinguish between these two possibilities we first introduced the glycosylation sequence between HR IX and X. This hPS1glyc429, when stably expressed, rescued NCT maturation, complex formation, and catalytic activity but failed to become glycosylated (Fig. 4, A and B). Second, we tested the cell surface biotinylation of lysine residues. As shown in Fig. 4C, both WT hPS1-NTF and -CTF are recovered on streptavidin beads irrespective of the detergent used for extraction. With the exception of CHAPS, these detergents do not preserve the PS1-NTF/CTF heterodimer complex, indicating that PS1-NTF and -CTF are individually biotinylated. In PS1-NTF, several lysine residues indeed are localized in the predicted extracellular loop domains. For PS1-CTF, only three lysines are available, one on the edge of HR VIII (TMD 7) and two between HR IX and X (codon 429-430). When both Lys-429 and Lys-430 were mutated to His and stably expressed in PS1 and 2 KO MEFs (PS1KK/HH MEF), levels of biotinylated CTF were identical to WT levels (Fig. 4C). This allows us to conclude that Lys-429 and -430 do not contribute to cell surface biotinylation and hence are cytosolically oriented (13Laudon H. Hansson E.M. Melen K. Bergman A. Farmery M.R. Winblad B. Lendahl U. von Heijne G. Naslund J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35352-35360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, both the biotinylation and glycosylation approach are in accordance with three TMDs in PS1-CTF and hence a 9-TMD model (Fig. 1B). Because our proposed model strongly depends on the glycosylation variants, one can argue that the introduction of a 40-amino acid leader peptidase sequence may influence and alter transmembrane orientations downstream of the insertion (12Oh Y.S. Turner R.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11821-11828Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to develop a third, least invasive, approach using differential single Cys derivation. After first generating a Cys-negative PS1 variant (Cys-), we introduced a Cys before and after codon 404 (CWC) or mutated codon 430 (K430C) or 460 (L460C) to Cys and generated stable MEFs displaying rescuing activity of γ-secretase assembly and APP-CTF processing (Figs. 1C and 4D). Subsequent treatment of intact cells with cell-permeable thiol-reactive EZ-link biotin HPDP resulted in an intense labeling of the PS1-CTF but not -NTF, as expected (Fig. 4E). However, when the cell-impermeable TS Biotin-X ethylenediamine was used, only Cys residues in hPS1/CWC and/L460C were selectively targeted (Fig. 4E). Because intact cell monolayers were used, our observations can only be explained by the extracellular orientation of these Cys residues (Fig. 1C). In conclusion, we propose a 9-TMD topology for PS1 with a cytosolic NH2 terminus and loop domain but extracellular COOH terminus, in line with recent findings (12Oh Y.S. Turner R.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11821-11828Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13Laudon H. Hansson E.M. Melen K. Bergman A. Farmery M.R. Winblad B. Lendahl U. von Heijne G. Naslund J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35352-35360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) but contradicting all previous topologies including the “accepted” 8-TMD (reviewed in Ref. 6Kim J. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 905-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The 9-TMD model is here supported by three independent criteria, using glycosylation mutants, biotinylation assays, and cysteine derivation. The reason for the widely divergent topologies is, in our opinion, methodological. First, most studies have relied either on overexpression of chimeric proteins of truncated PS1 variants fused to different reporters (all of which can differentially affect the topology of individual HRs (9Nakai T. Yamasaki A. Sakaguchi M. Kosaka K. Mihara K. Amaya Y. Miura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23647-23658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Oh Y.S. Turner R.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11821-11828Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or on high overexpression of FL-PS1. In the latter case, this is not without risk because PS1 levels are in critical balance with the other γ-secretase complex components. Second, overexpression may lead to overloading of the translocation machinery as we experienced with glycosylation variants of PEN-2. Whereas strong overexpression resulted in two opposite topologies, low retroviral expression gave a single PEN-2 topology (data not shown). An alternative hypothesis is that PS1 may adapt to multiple topologies within the cell, as proposed for other proteins (discussed in Ref. 6Kim J. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 905-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We believe that such complex interpretation is not needed. First, by selectively permeabilizing the cell surface using streptolysin-O followed by PS1-NH2-terminal- and loop domain-specific antibodies, we confirmed their overall cytosolic orientation (supplemental Fig. S1). Second, the data from the endoH-sensitive glycosylation of PS1glyc variants, an early ER-associated event, are in line with the failure of Lys residues 429-430 to become biotinylated and with the differential Cys derivation of cell surface-associated PS1. This suggests that the same topology is maintained throughout the biosynthetic route. Third, our 9-TMD model reconciles many established PS1 interactions with other proteins and functions: (i) it preserves the juxtaposed position of the “catalytic” Asp-257 and -385 in TMDs 6 and 7 (4Wolfe M.S. Kopan R. Science. 2004; 305: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar); (ii) several catenins interact with the cytosolic loop domain, and the role of PS1 in β-catenin turnover critically depends on this interaction (11Kang D.E. Soriano S. Xia X. Eberhart C.G. De Strooper B. Zheng H. Koo E.H. Cell. 2002; 110: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar); and (iii) the 9-TMD model is also compatible with the interaction of the PS1-COOH terminus with the TMD of APP (25Annaert W.G. Esselens C. Baert V. Boeve C. Snellings G. Cupers P. Craessaerts K. De Strooper B. Neuron. 2001; 32: 579-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and NCT (30Kaether C. Capell A. Edbauer D. Winkler E. Novak B. Steiner H. Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4738-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) as these hydrophobic COOH-terminal amino acids of PS1 may penetrate in the lipid bilayer. All this underscores that knowledge of the correct topology of PS1 is essential for the interpretation of experiments designed to understand its physiological function. For example, several two-hybrid screens identified PDZ-containing proteins interacting with the COOH terminus of PS (36Lau K.F. McLoughlin D.M. Standen C. Miller C.C. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 16: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) (37Xu X. Shi Y. Wu X. Gambetti P. Sui D. Cui M.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32543-32546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These interactions can be explained by the hydrophobic nature of the final COOH-terminal amino acids that indeed resemble a binding module for PDZ domains. Likewise, the extracellular context of the PS1 COOH terminus was also not taken into account when proposing a cytoplasmic ER-export motif in PS1 and 2 (38Hauri H.P. Nufer O. Breuza L. Tekaya H.B. Liang L. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2002; : 73-82PubMed Google Scholar) or when exploring the role of the COOH terminus in ER retention (30Kaether C. Capell A. Edbauer D. Winkler E. Novak B. Steiner H. Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4738-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This is the first and most complete study on PS1 topology performed on physiological relevant expression levels of FLPS1 variants in a KO background, arguing that this 9-TMD model most closely reflects the in vivo situation from its site of synthesis throughout the secretory route. Ultimate proof and confirmation have to come from structural work, but given the hydrophobic nature of PS1 this will not be easy to achieve. Finally, our unique approach strongly favors complex assembly after the ER but prior to Golgi passage. We thank C. Van Broeckhoven (University of Antwerp, Belgium), E. Berger (Zürich), and B.

https://openalex.org/W2003290224,"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae deploys two different types of glucose sensors on its cell surface that operate in distinct glucose signaling pathways: the glucose transporter-like Snf3 and Rgt2 proteins and the Gpr1 receptor that is coupled to Gpa2, a G-protein α subunit. The ultimate target of the Snf3/Rgt2 pathway is Rgt1, a transcription factor that regulates expression of HXT genes encoding glucose transporters. We have found that the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), which is activated by the Gpr1/Gpa2 glucose-sensing pathway and by a glucose-sensing pathway that works through Ras1 and Ras2, catalyzes phosphorylation of Rgt1 and regulates its function. Rgt1 is phosphorylated in vitro by all three isoforms of PKA, and this requires several serine residues located in PKA consensus sequences within Rgt1. PKA and the consensus serine residues of Rgt1 are required for glucose-induced removal of Rgt1 from the HXT promoters and for induction of HXT expression. Conversely, overexpression of the TPK genes led to constitutive expression of the HXT genes. The PKA consensus phosphorylation sites of Rgt1 are required for an intramolecular interaction that is thought to regulate its DNA binding activity. Thus, two different glucose signal transduction pathways converge on Rgt1 to regulate expression of glucose transporters.

Thus, two different glucose signal transduction pathways converge on Rgt1 to regulate expression of glucose transporters. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae prefers to ferment glucose even when oxygen is available (1Lagunas R. Mol.

Science. 2001; 292: 504-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). This specialized mode of metabolism yields only two ATPs per molecule of glucose fermented, requiring yeast cells to pump large amounts of glucose through glycolysis. They do this by enhancing the rate-limiting step of glucose metabolism, its transport into cells, by increasing expression of the HXT genes encoding glucose transporters (HXT). Glucose induction of HXT expression is achieved through the Snf3/Rgt2-Rgt1 signal transduction pathway, in which the glucose signal generated by the Snf3 and Rgt2 glucose sensors ultimately alters function of the Rgt1 transcription factor (4Ozcan S.

Rgt1 functions differently in cells exposed to different levels of glucose. In the absence of glucose, Rgt1 represses HXT expression in conjunction with Mth1 and Std1 (4Ozcan S. Leong T. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) by binding to HXT gene promoters and recruiting the Ssn6 and Tup1 corepressors (4Ozcan S. Leong T. Johnston M. Mol.

Induction of HXT gene expression is achieved by relieving Rgt1-mediated repression through glucose-induced degradation of Mth1 and Std1 (10Flick K.M. Spielewoy N. Kalashnikova T.I. Guaderrama M.

Rgt1 also serves as a transcriptional activator that is required for full induction of HXT1 expression when glucose levels are high (4Ozcan S. Leong T. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), although how it converts from a transcriptional repressor to an activator remains unclear. The level of glucose determines the phosphorylation state of Rgt1; it is hypophosphorylated in the absence of glucose and is hyperphosphorylated when glucose levels are high (9Kim J.H. Polish J.

Yeast cell extracts were prepared by vortexing cell pellets with glass beads in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate). After centrifugation the, cell lysates were sonicated five times with 10-s pulses using a microtip. Proteins with their attached genomic DNA fragments, which averaged 200–500 bp in length, were precipitated with mouse monoclonal anti-LexA antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The cross-linking of the precipitated DNA to the protein was reversed by incubating them in elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA) at 65°C for 6 h, and 1/100 of the input DNA was used as template in a 25-cycle PCR. The sequences of the PCR primer pair used to detect the HXT1 promoter were 5′-ATATAATTCCCCCCTCCTGAAG-3′ (OM 3109) and 5′TGATTCTACGTTTTTGCAAGC-3′ (OM3111). For Western blot analysis, 5 ml of yeast cells (A600 = 1.2) grown on different carbon sources (i.e. either 2% galactose or 4% glucose) were collected by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in 100 μl of SDS-buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 5 min. After centrifugation, soluble proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and detected with the Anti-LexA monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and ECL system (Pierce). In Vitro Protein Kinase Assay—Rgt1 fused to LexA (pBM3307 (4Ozcan S. Leong T. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar)) was harvested from yeast cell extracts with anti-LexA conjugated to agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40). After washing with Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 1 m NaCl, the LexA-Rgt1 beads were equilibrated with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The 119 yeast protein kinases fused to GST (29Zhu H. Klemic J.F. Chang S. Bertone P. Casamayor A. Klemic K.G. Smith D. Gerstein M. Reed M.A. Snyder M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) were overexpressed in yeast cells and affinity-purified with glutathione-Sepharose-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). The LexA-Rgt1 and glutathione S-transferase kinases were mixed in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 0.5 μCi of [γ32P]ATP, 100 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2 and incubated at 28 °C for 30 min. After washing the beads with the kinase buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, the proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in SDS-sample buffer for 5 min. The eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. Each set of in vitro kinase assays was independently repeated twice. Two-hybrid Assay—To construct Gal4 DNA-binding domain hybrids (Gal4 DBD-Rgt1), the N-terminal region of RGT1 (encoding amino acids 1–392) was amplified by the PCR using pBM3580 (30Polish J.A. Kim J.H. Johnston M. Genetics. 2005; 169: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) as a template, and the PCR products were incorporated into the GAL4-DBD plasmid (pBM3593 (30Polish J.A. Kim J.H. Johnston M. Genetics. 2005; 169: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)) by gap repair (26Ma H. Kunes S. Schatz P.J. Botstein D.

These plasmids were combined with the GAL4 activation domain hybrid (GAL4-AD-Rgt1, encoding amino acids 450–850 (30Polish J.A. Kim J.H. Johnston M. Genetics. 2005; 169: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)) and used to transform yeast cells (FM413) to Leu+ Trp+. Yeast cells carrying both plasmids were grown to mid-log phase (A600 = 1–1.5) at 30 °C in the liquid medium containing galactose (2%), transferred to minimal medium containing galactose (2%) or glucose and grown for 45 min, and then assayed for β-galactosidase activity. β-Galactosidase activity assays were performed using the yeast β-galactosidase assay kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Results were presented in Miller units ((1,000 × A420)/(T × V × A600), where A420 is the optical density at 420 nm, T is the incubation time in minutes, and V is the volume of cells in milliliters). The reported lacZ activities are averages of results from triplicate of usually three different transformants. PKA Catalyzes Phosphorylation of Rgt1—To identify potential Rgt1 protein kinases, 119 known and predicted protein kinases were tested for their ability to catalyze phosphorylation of Rgt1 in vitro. The protein kinases were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins (29Zhu H. Klemic J.F. Chang S. Bertone P. Casamayor A. Klemic K.G. Smith D. Gerstein M. Reed M.A. Snyder M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), affinity-purified from yeast cell extracts, and incubated with or without purified LexA-Rgt1 in buffer containing γ32P-labeled ATP, and the radiolabeled proteins were detected by autoradiography after separating them by SDS-PAGE. Assays of a representative set of protein kinases are shown in Fig. 1A. The Tpk1 isoform of protein kinase A seemed to exhibit the strongest activity on Rgt1. The two other PKA isoforms, Tpk2 and Tpk3, also catalyzed phosphorylation of Rgt1 (Fig. 1B). The TPK Genes Are Required for Induction of HXT Expression—We explored the role of the TPK genes in HXT gene expression. Expression of the HXT genes is induced by glucose (Fig. 2A, black bar for wild type) and by deletion of RGT1 (Fig. 2A, white bar for rgt1Δ), but glucose does not induce HXT1 and HXT3 gene expression in cells with greatly reduced PKA activity (tpkw = bcy1 tpk1w1tpk2 tpk3; tpkw1 allele encodes a functionally attenuated PKA catalytic subunit (31Cameron S. Levin L. Zoller M. Wigler M. Cell. 1988; 53: 555-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 2). Deletion of RGT1 suppresses this defect, consistent with the idea that PKA functions through Rgt1. Deletion of any single TPK gene reduced induction of HXT1 expression by only 30–50%; deletion of both TPK2 and TPK3 reduced HXT1 expression by about 75%. The TPK genes contribute significantly to regulation of the high glucose-induced HXT1 and HXT3 genes but seem to be less involved in regulation of the low glucose-induced HXT2 gene (data not shown). This might reflect the fact that PKA activity is maximal when glucose levels are high. HXT1 expression was constitutive when PKA was rendered active by eliminating its Bcy1 regulatory subunit (Fig. 3). Similarly, overexpression of any one of the TPK genes induces HXT1 expression (Fig. 3), presumably because high levels of the catalytic subunit of PKA overwhelms the Bcy1 regulatory subunit. These results suggest that PKA exerts its function through Rgt1 to effect expression of the HXT genes. Serines in PKA Consensus Sequences of Rgt1 Are Required for Derepression of HXT1 Expression and Phosphorylation of Rgt1 by PKA—It has been previously suggested that Tpk3 has a role in modulation of Rgt1 activity. However, whether Tpk3 directly phosphorylates Rgt1 (39Palomino A. Herrero P. Moreno F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1427-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) has not been addressed. PKA catalyzes phosphorylation of serine or threonine in the sequence R(R/K/S)X(S/T) (phosphorylated Ser or Thr are underlined (32Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). There are nine such consensus sequences in Rgt1; four of them near the N terminus have serines, Ser-146, Ser-202, Ser-283, and Ser-284, that are well conserved in the Rgt1 orthologs from Saccharomyces species and Candida glabrata (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the serines in the other five consensus sequences (Ser-96, Ser-410, Ser-480, Ser-625, and Ser-1130) are not conserved. Mutations altering the conserved serines Ser-146, Ser-202, or Ser-283 and Ser-284 resulted in approximately a 50% reduction in glucose-induced HXT1 expression (Fig. 4B). (Mutations altering the 5 non-conserved serines had no effect on HXT1 expression (data not shown).) Changing all 4 of the conserved serines (plus Ser-96) to alanine (the S5A mutation) fully prevented glucose induction of HXT1 expression (Fig. 4B) without affecting the stability of Rgt1 (Fig. 4C). Thus, the four conserved consensus sequences in Rgt1 for phosphorylation by PKA are crucial for regulation of Rgt1 function by glucose. PKA catalyzes phosphorylation of wild-type Rgt1 in vitro but not of Rgt1 with alanines in place of the 5 serines in the conserved PKA consensus sequences (Fig. 5). This is true for full-length Rgt1 and for an N-terminal fragment of Rgt1-(1–392) that contains the evolutionarily conserved PKA consensus phosphorylation sites. The phosphorylation of Rgt1 by PKA in vitro is also apparent from the increased mobility in SDS-PAGE it causes (Fig. 5, lower panels). We conclude that PKA phosphorylates Rgt1 at one or more of its consensus phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation of Rgt1 Regulates Its Function—It is well known that glucose promotes phosphorylation of Rgt1 and its dissociation from the HXT gene promoters (9Kim J.H. Polish J. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5208-5216Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 10Flick K.M. Spielewoy N. Kalashnikova T.I. Guaderrama M. Zhu Q. Chang H.C. Wittenberg C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3230-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 13Mosley A.L. Lakshmanan J. Aryal B.K. Ozcan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10322-10327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), so we sought to determine whether PKA is responsible for this. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirms that Rgt1 binds to the HXT1 promoter in cells grown on galactose but not glucose (Fig. 6A). However, Rgt1 binds to the HXT1 promoter in glucose-grown cells that lack PKA activity (tpkw), as does Rgt1 lacking the serines in its PKA consensus phosphorylation sites in glucose-grown wild-type cells (Fig. 6A). These results suggest that phosphorylation of Rgt1 by PKA in response to glucose inhibits its DNA binding activity. Rgt1 function is regulated by an intramolecular interaction between the N terminus and middle region of Rgt1 that has been suggested to inhibit function of the DNA-binding domain of Rgt1 (30Polish J.A. Kim J.H. Johnston M. Genetics. 2005; 169: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We used a two-hybrid assay to test whether the PKA consensus phosphorylation sites of Rgt1 are necessary for this intramolecular interaction. We used as “bait” the N-terminal region of Rgt1-(1–392) fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and as “prey” the central region of Rgt1-(450–850) fused to the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain (Fig. 6B). Interaction between these two parts of Rgt1 is induced by glucose, but the interaction was not observed if the 5 serines of the consensus PKA phosphorylation sites of Rgt1 are changed to alanine (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that PKA phosphorylates Rgt1 when glucose is available and that this is required for the Rgt1 intramolecular interaction that inhibits its DNA binding activity, thereby dissociating Rgt1 from the HXT promoters. We have presented three pieces of evidence that support the view that PKA contributes to glucose induction of HXT gene expression by catalyzing phosphorylation of Rgt1. 1) Glucose fails to induce HXT1 and HXT3 expression in yeast cells deficient in PKA activity (Fig. 2), and HXT1 expression is constitutive in cells with constitutive PKA activity (Fig. 3); 2) evolutionarily conserved serine residues in PKA consensusphosphorylation sequences of Rgt1 are essential for glucose to induce HXT1 expression (Fig. 4) and to cause release of Rgt1 from the HXT1 promoter (Fig. 6A); and 3) PKA catalyzes phosphorylation of Rgt1 in vitro but not of Rgt1 devoid of PKA consensus phosphorylation sites (Fig. 5). PKA activity is regulated in two ways. 1) A glucose-sensing pathway that starts at the plasma membrane with Gpr1, a G-protein-coupled receptor (17Rolland F. Winderickx J. Thevelein J.M. FEMS Yeast Res. 2002; 2: 183-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), stimulates adenylate cyclase via the G-protein α subunit Gpa2, and 2) the small GTP-binding proteins Ras1 and Ras2 stimulate adenyl cyclase in response to glucose (40Toda T. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Powers S. Kataoka T. Broek D. Cameron S. Broach J. Matsumoto K. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 40: 27-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). In these ways, the addition of glucose to yeast cells leads to an increase in the intracellular level of cAMP, which binds to the Bcy1 inhibitory subunit of PKA and dissociates it from the enzyme, thereby activating the protein kinase activity of PKA. These two routes of PKA activation seem to be redundant because deletion of GPR1 or RAS1 and RAS2 does not affect glucose induction of HXT gene expression (data not shown). Glucose induces HXT gene expression by ultimately effecting the release of the Rgt1 repressor from the HXT promoters (9Kim J.H. Polish J. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5208-5216Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 10Flick K.M. Spielewoy N. Kalashnikova T.I. Guaderrama M. Zhu Q. Chang H.C. Wittenberg C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3230-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 13Mosley A.L. Lakshmanan J. Aryal B.K. Ozcan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10322-10327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We previously provided evidence that this is due to an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal region of Rgt1 that contains its zinc cluster DNA-binding domain and the middle region of the protein (30Polish J.A. Kim J.H. Johnston M. Genetics. 2005; 169: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). That intramolecular interaction requires phosphorylation of Rgt1, and our results suggest that PKA is the protein kinase responsible for this event (Fig. 6B). Mth1 and Std1 inhibit this intramolecular interaction (30Polish J.A. Kim J.H. Johnston M. Genetics. 2005; 169: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, two different glucose-induced events must occur for this intramolecular interaction to take place and release Rgt1 from the HXT promoters; Mth1 and Std1 must be degraded via the Snf3-Rgt2 glucose-sensing pathway, and Rgt1 must become phosphorylated via the Gpr1-PKA glucose-sensing pathway. Std1 does not completely disappear when glucose is added to cells because glucose induces expression of STD1 (via the Snf3/Rgt2-Rgt1 glucose signaling pathway (12Kim J.H. Brachet V. Moriya H. Johnston M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 33Kaniak A. Xue Z. Macool D. Kim J.H. Johnston M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar)). Enough Std1 could remain in glucose-grown cells to attenuate the intramolecular interaction of Rgt1, and this would dampen induction of HXT expression. This may necessitate a device to lock Rgt1 in a conformation that enables full induction of HXT expression, and we propose that PKA could provide such a device. We surmise that yeast cells take advantage of this strategy to induce different HXT genes in response to different levels of glucose. When glucose levels are low, Mth1 would be degraded, but Rgt1 would not be fully phosphorylated because PKA is not fully active in this condition. This might result in induction only of HXT genes encoding high affinity glucose transporters (e.g. HXT2). When glucose levels are high, Mth1 would be degraded, and Rgt1 would be fully phosphorylated because PKA is fully active. This would drive to completion the intramolecular interaction of Rgt1 and result in full induction of the high glucose-induced HXT genes (i.e. HXT1 and HXT3). This is the third glucose-sensing pathway known to affect expression of the HXT genes encoding glucose transporters (Fig. 7). The Snf3/Rgt2-Rgt1 pathway is responsible for glucose induction of HXT expression. The glucose repression pathway that operates through the Snf1 protein kinase and the Mig1 transcriptional repressor contributes to regulation of HXT expression by repressing expression of MTH1 (33Kaniak A. Xue Z. Macool D. Kim J.H. Johnston M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which reinforces glucose-induced degradation of Mth1 and results in rapid glucose induction of HXT expression (12Kim J.H. Brachet V. Moriya H. Johnston M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Mig1 also represses expression of the HXT2 and HXT4 genes when glucose levels are high (34Ozcan S. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5536-5545Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), ensuring that the high affinity glucose transporters encoded by these genes are only expressed when glucose levels are low. The results described here indicate that the Gpr1-Ras1/Ras2-PKA glucose-sensing pathway also contributes to regulation of HXT expression by regulating Rgt1 function. By integrating the signals generated in three different glucose-sensing pathways, yeast cells are able to respond rapidly and decisively to fluctuating levels of glucose.

https://openalex.org/W2012479760,"CD59 is a membrane glycoprotein that regulates formation of the cytolytic membrane attack complex (MAC or C5b-9) on host cell membranes. It functions by binding to C8 (α chain) and C9 after their structural rearrangement during MAC assembly. Previous studies indicated that the CD59 binding site in C9 was located within a 25-residue disulfide-bonded loop, and in C8α was located within a 51-residue sequence that overlaps the CD59 binding region of C9. By peptide screens and the use of peptides in binding assays, functional assays, and computer modeling and docking studies, we have identified a 6-residue sequence of human C9, spanning residues 365-371, as the primary CD59 recognition domain involved in CD59-mediated regulation of MAC formation. The data also indicate that both C8α and C9 bind to a similar or overlapping site on CD59. Furthermore, data from CD59-peptide docking models are consistent with the C9 binding site on CD59 located at a hydrophobic pocket, putatively identified previously by CD59 mutational and modeling studies.

Complement activation leads ultimately to the generation and membrane insertion of a cytolytic protein assembly termed the membrane attack complex (MAC). 2The abbreviations used are: MAC, membrane attack complex; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin. The MAC is formed by the self-assembly of complement proteins C5b, C6, C7, C8, and from 1 to 18 molecules of C9. Host cells are protected from MAC-mediated lysis by CD59, an 18-21-kDa glycophosphatidylinositol-linked membrane glycoprotein. The MAC appears to play an important role in causing tissue injury following inappropriate complement activation in various ischemic and inflammatory conditions (reviewed in Refs. 1Arumugam T.V.

Immunol. 2005; 174: 5750-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CD59 is sometimes overexpressed on tumor cells, and its expression has been linked to promoting tumor growth and the protection of tumor cells from mAb therapy (8Fishelson Z. Donin N. Zell S. Schultz S. Kirschfink M. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 40: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 9Fonsatti E. Altomonte M. Coral S. De Nardo C. Lamaj E. Sigalotti L. Natali P.G. Maio M.

It is therefore of interest to understand the molecular interaction between CD59 and its complement ligands for the goal of engineering effective soluble CD59-based therapeutics for treating inflammatory conditions, or for designing CD59 inhibitory molecules to enhance tumor cell susceptibility to complement. CD59 functions by binding to the α-subunit of C8 in the C5b-8 complex and preventing subsequent binding of C9, and/or by binding to C9 in the C5b-9 complex and preventing recruitment of additional C9 molecules (11Ninomiya H. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13675-13680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Rollins S.A. Zhao J.I. Ninomiya H. Sims P.J. J.

CD59 can only bind to C8α and C9 in the nascent complex after conformation rearrangements of the two proteins that occur during MAC assembly. The activity of CD59 is species selective, and previous characterization of chimeric human/rabbit C8α- and C9-identified regions within the primary sequence of these proteins that interact with human CD59 (14Lockert D.H.

Kaufman K.M. Sodetz J.M. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3483-3486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). There is considerable sequence homology between C8α and C9, and the identified CD59 binding sequence in the two proteins aligned to a region just C-terminal to the proposed membrane binding domain that encompassed residues 320-415 in human C8α, and 334-415 in human C9. Peptides derived from within these sequences mapped the primary CD59 binding site to residues 359-384 in C9, a sequence contained between a Cys359-Cys405 disulfide loop in the native protein (16Huesler T. Lockert D.H. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and to residues 364-415 in C8α. In contrast to the C9 sequence, formation of the corresponding interchain disulfide between Cys375-Cys384 in C8α is required for CD59 binding (14Lockert D.H. Kaufman K.M. Chang C.-P. Huesler T. Sodetz J.M. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19723-19728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition to these studies, earlier investigations in our laboratory using chimeric human/horse C9 molecules and a peptide derived from the putative hinge region of human C9-identified residues 222-271 as involved in CD59 binding (17Tomlinson S. Whitlow M.B. Nussenzweig V. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1927-1934PubMed Google Scholar). To better define the region of C9 that interacts with CD59 and to identify CD59-inhibitory peptides, peptides spanning the above identified regions of C9 were prepared and screened for CD59-binding and functional activity. A peptide phage display technique was also employed. A short consensus sequence was identified and allowed modeling of peptide-CD59 docking. Peptides—Linear peptides were synthesized by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ). Cyclized peptide, cp1, corresponding to sequence 359-384 of human C9 was synthesized by AnaSpec Inc. (San Jose, CA). The cp1 peptide was cyclized by a disulfide bridge formed between the two cysteines at each end of the peptide. Production of Recombinant Soluble CD59—Recombinant soluble CD59 lacking N-linked glycosylation because of a N18Q mutation was used in all binding and functional assays. N-linked glycosylation is not required for CD59 activity and the N18Q CD59 mutant protein has been previously characterized (18Yu J. Abagyan R.A. Dong S. Gilbert A. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Removal of this glycosylation site facilitated Pichia expression and protein purification. The coding sequence of human CD59/N18Q was generated from a previously constructed vector (18Yu J. Abagyan R.A. Dong S. Gilbert A. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) by PCR and cloned into the Pichia pastoris expression vector pPICZαA (Invitrogen). The expression plasmid was transformed into P. pastoris-competent SMD1168H via electroporation, and transformed cells were plated on YPD plates with different concentrations of selecting antibiotic Zeocin (Invitrogen). After determination of the phenotype, methanol utilization plus (Mut+), or methanol utilization slow (Muts) pre-selected clones were subjected to a small scale expression test to select a high expressing clone. The level of soluble CD59 expression was determined by standard Western blot or by Sandwich ELISA using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to human CD59. Soluble CD59 was expressed via fermentation in a 5 liter BioFlo 110 Fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ) according to a modified protocol based on the Pichia Fermentation Process Guidelines of Invitrogen. After 1-day growth on basal medium, a 12-h glycerol feeding batch, and a 3-4-day methanol feeding batch, fermented culture was harvested and centrifuged. The supernatant was filtered with a 0.22-μm AcroPak 200 filtration filter (Pall Europe Ltd., Portsmouth, UK), concentrated and dialyzed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 with a Prep/ScaleTM-TFF 1ft2 cartridge (Millipore Corporation, Bradford, MA). Soluble CD59 in the concentrated supernatant was then purified by anti-CD59 YTH53.1 antibody affinity chromatography and subsequent Mono Q 5/5 ion exchange FPLC (Amersham Biosciences). Purified protein was checked for purity and folding by 18% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using a panel of anti-CD59 monoclonal antibodies that recognize conformational epitopes described previously (19Huang Y. Smith C.A. Song H. Morgan B.P. Abagyan R. Tomlinson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34073-34079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Labeling of CD59—Soluble CD59 was biotin-labeled using a biotin labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). CD59 at 1 mg/ml in PBS was mixed with biotin-7-NHS at a molar reaction ratio of 1:5 (CD59:biotin). Following incubation at room temperature for 2 h with gentle stirring, non-reacted biotin-7-NHS was separated on a Sephadex G-25 column. CD59 Binding Assays—In direct binding assays, CD59 binding to immobilized C9, C8, and cyclic peptide, cp1, was determined. The proteins or peptide were diluted with ELISA coating buffer (0.5 m Na2CO3 buffer, pH 9.6) to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml and boiled in a water bath for 6 min. The boiled samples were then coated on ELISA plates (200 μl/per well) overnight at 4 °C. Boiled BSA at 1 mg/ml served as control. Wells were then blocked with 20 mg/ml BSA in PBS (2 h at 37 °C), and the plates washed five times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween (PBST). Biotinylated CD59 (100 μl of 2 μg/ml) was then added, and following incubation (2 h, 37 °C), wells were washed five times with PBST. A streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate (Roche Applied Science) at 1:5000 dilution was then added, and plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with shaking. Following five washes with PBST, CD59 binding was assessed by color development using Sigma FAST o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) tablets. Absorbance was read at 492 nm and data corrected using corresponding BSA controls. In competitive binding assays, the ability of various peptides to inhibit the binding of biotinylated CD59 to immobilized C8, C9, or cp1 was measured. In these assays, different concentrations of peptide were mixed with biotinylated CD59 (2 μg/ml) containing BSA (1 mg/ml) before addition to wells containing immobilized protein or peptide. FPLC and Mass Analysis of CD59-p8 Peptide Interaction—Soluble CD59 (100 μl, 1 mg/ml) was incubated with peptide p8 (100 μl, 2 mg/ml), resulting in a CD59:p8 molar ratio of ∼1:20. Incubations were made in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 at room temperature for 30 min. Incubated samples were injected onto a Superdex 75 PC 3.2/30 gel filtration column connected to an AKTA FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences) for separation. Fractions were collected and subject to mass analysis. For mass analysis, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix was prepared in 70% AcN, 30% H2O, with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. 2 μl of sample were mixed with 2 μl of matrix in a clean Eppendorf tube and 1 μl of the matrix/sample mixture applied to a clean spot on the MALDI Target. Voyager STR MALDI TOF (Applied Biosystems) was used to acquire data in Linear Mode from 800-10,000 m/z range. Standard 2 from the Sequazyme Peptide mass standards kit (Applied Biosystems) was used for mass calibration of the instrument prior to data acquisition. Two hundred shots per sample were acquired. Complement Lysis Assays—A CHO cell clone-expressing GPI-anchored human CD59 was used in these assays (19Huang Y. Smith C.A. Song H. Morgan B.P. Abagyan R. Tomlinson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34073-34079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). CHO cells (wild type or expressing CD59) at 60-80% confluency were detached with 5 mm EDTA in PBS, washed once and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Cells at 2 × 106/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min with or without peptides at indicated concentrations. CHO cells were sensitized with rabbit anti-CHO membrane serum (5% final concentration) (19Huang Y. Smith C.A. Song H. Morgan B.P. Abagyan R. Tomlinson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34073-34079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and fresh human serum (8% final concentration) was added to make a final cell concentration of 1 × 106/ml (in 100 μl). The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min, and cell viability determined by Trypan Blue staining (live and dead cells were counted). Wild-type CHO cells served as negative control for CD59 complement inhibitory function. Statistics—Analysis was performed by Student's t test, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Error bars shown in figures represent standard deviation. Phage Peptide Display—Three phage peptide display libraries, Ph.D.-7™, Ph.D.C7C™ (Cyclic), and Ph.D.-12™ (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA), were used to screen for human CD59 binding peptides. Three rounds of ELISA-based screening were carried out according to the manufacturer's instruction. Peptides were synthesized based on derived consensus sequences (GenScript) and tested for CD59 binding as described above. Computer Modeling—A refined structure derived from the CD59 NMR coordinates was used as the target for docking (19Huang Y. Smith C.A. Song H. Morgan B.P. Abagyan R. Tomlinson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34073-34079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The NMR data for CD59 shows a number of quite flexible amino acid side chains on the surface including Arg55.An in silico flexibility analysis (20Cavasotto C.N. Abagyan R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 209-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) of the refined CD59 structure identified Arg55 as having the most flexible side chain, and by manipulating the side chain conformation of Arg55, it was possible to open a constriction. Compared with the closed NMR average structure, this open conformation extended an adjacent surface groove previously identified as the putative C9 binding site (19Huang Y. Smith C.A. Song H. Morgan B.P. Abagyan R. Tomlinson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34073-34079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We used both of these conformations for our docking analysis. The first conformation was the refined CD59 structure reported by Huang et al. (19Huang Y. Smith C.A. Song H. Morgan B.P. Abagyan R.

The second CD59 conformation (referred to as the “open” conformation of CD59) was produced by selecting a side chain rotamer of Arg55 as noted above. A 6-mer peptide (VSLAFS, the herein identified C9 consensus sequence that binds to CD59) and 8-mer peptide (DVSLAFSE, synthetic peptide shown to bind CD59) were created as objects in ICM (21Abagyan R.A.

Chem. 1994; 15: 488-506Crossref Scopus (1368) Google Scholar) and docked to both the closed and the open refined conformations of CD59, defined by the set of residues within 3 Å of the open structure pocket. A second receptor target was a much larger locus of residues within 6 Å of Arg53. This set included the amino acids previously implicated in C9 binding from mutagenesis experiments and that are also located in the vicinity of the computationally predicted binding pocket (18Yu J.

Ligand and CD59 conformations were docked with the default ICM “thoroughness” variable set to either 2 or to 100 in order to fully explore the convergence of the docking routine. Binding of C9-derived Peptides to CD59—Previous studies identified two C9-derived peptides that bind CD59; one composed of residues 247-261 within the putative “hinge” region (17Tomlinson S. Whitlow M.B. Nussenzweig V. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1927-1934PubMed Google Scholar) and another composed of residues 359-384 (16Huesler T. Lockert D.H. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In an attempt to better define the CD59 binding sequence of C9, shorter peptides spanning these regions were synthesized and characterized in CD59 binding assays. To assay for CD59 binding, the ability of peptide to inhibit the binding of soluble CD59 (sCD59) to immobilized denatured C9 was initially measured. Five peptides of 11 residues spanning the 247-261 sequence and differing by one residue were synthesized, but none of the peptides interacted with CD59 in competitive binding assays (data not shown). We also confirmed data from a previous report showing that the full-length 247-261 “hinge” peptide had a direct membrane perturbing effect that interfered with the functional analysis of CD59-inhibition (23Chang C.-P. Huesler T. Zhao J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26424-26430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second series of 7 peptides of 12 residues each and spanning the 360-383 sequence of C9 were synthesized. At the concentrations tested in this screen, three of the peptides (p1-p3) inhibited the binding of sCD59 to immobilized C9 to a similar extent as the full-length and cyclized Cys359-Cys384 peptide, cp1 (Fig. 1). A fourth peptide (p4) also inhibited sCD59-C9 binding, albeit to a lesser extent. Sequence alignment of these 4 peptides identified a 6-residue consensus sequence of VSLAFS (Fig. 2) (residues 366-371 of C9). Therefore, an additional peptide comprising the consensus sequence was synthesized and tested. To maintain aqueous solubility, the peptide p8 (DVSLAFSE) was synthesized to contain the naturally occurring charged N- and C-terminal residues on either side of the consensus sequence. The p8 peptide, as well cp1 and a representative peptide containing the consensus sequence, p2 (refer to Fig. 2), inhibited the binding of CD59 to C9 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). A peptide of the same amino acid composition as p2, but with scrambled sequence (Scr1, LSHVLYSIAFED) had no significant effect on CD59 binding to C9. Soluble CD59 also bound directly to peptide cp1 immobilized on plastic, and the specificity of the interaction was demonstrated by the inhibition of this binding by the addition of cp1, p8, or p2 to the incubations (Fig. 4). Note that on a molar basis, there is an approximate 3:2:1 ratio for p8:p2:cp1 at similar μg/ml concentration.FIGURE 2Sequence alignment of peptides spanning 359-384 of C9 protein sequence.

Following incubation of CD59 and p8 at a 1:20 molar ratio, two peaks were separated by Superdex 75 FPLC, and were shown to be composed of CD59+p8 and p8 only by mass spectroscopy (supplemental data). Effect of C9 Peptides on Binding of CD59 to C8—CD59 inhibits MAC formation by binding to both C8α in C5b-8 and to unfolded C9 in the assembling C5b-9 complex. To investigate whether C8α and C9 bind to the same or an overlapping epitope on CD59, the ability of the C9-derived peptides to inhibit CD59 binding to immobilized C8 was tested. The C9-derived peptides cp1 and p8 (the consensus sequence from cp1 that binds CD59) significantly inhibited the binding of CD59 to C8 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5). The scrambled p2 peptide, Scr1, had no effect on the CD59-C8 interaction. Peptide p8 was, nevertheless, significantly less effective than cp1 at inhibiting CD59 binding to C8. Functional Activity of C9-derived Peptides—Specificity of the peptide interaction with CD59 was further investigated by measuring the ability of the C9-derived peptides to block CD59 activity. Blocking the interaction between membrane-bound CD59 and the assembling C5b-9 complex in the membrane will increase complement-mediated lysis. CHO cells expressing high levels of human CD59 were sensitized with antibody and incubated in a sublytic concentration of human serum. The inclusion of peptides p8, cp1, or p2 during the incubation resulted in a dose-dependent increase in complement lysis of the CHO cells (Fig. 6). Scrambled peptide Scr1 had no effect on complement-mediated lysis. It has been noted previously that hydrophobic peptides can increase complement-mediated hemolysis (erythrocyte lysis) in the absence of CD59. However, none of the peptides at the highest concentration tested enhanced complement-mediated lysis of CHO cells that did not express human CD59 (not shown). Phage Peptide Display—Three phage peptide display libraries (7 residue cyclic and 7 and 12 residue linear) were panned using immobilized CD59, resulting in the isolation of CD59 binding peptides. The peptides isolated were: a single cyclic peptide of (C)KHHSHRY(C), two linear dodecamers of AWRHGHHTYPPL and SWWSFHIHPNPP, and several peptides with a consensus sequence WPXHXHX. However, there was no sequence consensus corresponding to sequence within C8α or C9, even for the short HXHX motif found in all peptides. Because of the potential significance of identifying peptides that are effective CD59 inhibitors, peptides identified by phage display were synthesized and investigated in CD59 binding and functional assays. None of the peptides had any significant effect on CD59 activity and only one, SWWSFHIHPNPP, inhibited the binding of CD59 to immobilized C9, albeit to a much lesser extent than p8 peptide (not shown). Peptide Modeling and Docking to CD59—The identification of a 6-residue consensus sequence within C9 that binds to CD59 allowed computer modeling of the CD59-peptide interaction. Previous studies involving CD59 mutagenesis putatively identified the C8/C9 binding site at the membrane distal surface in the vicinity of a hydrophobic groove (18Yu J. Abagyan R.A. Dong S. Gilbert A. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Huang Y. Smith C.A. Song H. Morgan B.P. Abagyan R. Tomlinson S. J. Biol.

Med. 1997; 185: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, a computer modeling method for identifying potential small molecule binding sites identified a small pocket in close proximity to the binding site predicted by the mutagenesis studies (19Huang Y. Smith C.A. Song H. Morgan B.P. Abagyan R. Tomlinson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34073-34079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the current study, an in silico flexibility analysis of the CD59 structure identified Arg55 as having a particularly flexible side chain, and by manipulating the side chain conformation of Arg55, it was possible to open a constriction across the pocket previously identified by computer modeling. Conformations of CD59 with the smaller “closed” binding pocket and the extended “open” binding pocket are shown in Fig. 7, A and B, and lacking a rationale to prefer either conformation of CD59, we elected to use both of these conformations in our docking analysis. The binding pockets that have a high computationally determined likelihood to be a locus for peptide binding are shown in blue. The open structure pocket (Fig. 7B) has a volume of 201 A3, and has about one-third more surface area and about 40% more volume than the closed pocket (Fig. 7A). The region of the putative C9 binding site determined by mutagenesis studies is shown in cyan. The cyan surface shows the location of this binding region defined as residues within 6 ÅofArg53 and includes Trp40, which lies at a geometric centroid encompassing all the residues that alter CD59-C9 binding when substituted. Independent docking runs were performed to analyze for both targets. We initially performed docking calculations using the 8-residue p8 peptide with independent docking runs to analyze for both targets (blue and cyan in Fig. 7). Despite the large docking region, the best scoring bound peptides lay within the computationally identified binding groove (blue) with overlap into the binding region identified by mutagenesis (cyan). However, with the ICM thoroughness factor set to 2, repeat docking calculations beginning with different probe start positions did not reproduce the same conformations, indicating that the program had not converged (not shown). We therefore performed the docking calculations using the identified 6-residue consensus sequence within C9 that binds to CD59, but with the ICM thoroughness increased to 100. When docking to the closed conformation of CD59, different starting positions of the probe position failed to produce convergent ligand conformations (Fig. 7A and Table 1). However, when the experiment was run with the open conformation of CD59, the successive dockings, beginning with distinct starting positions, did converge to the same ligand conformations with the nearly identical ICM energy scores (Fig. 7B and Table 1).TABLE 16-mer (VSLAFS) docked in silico to closed and open CD59 structures using the ICM programClosed conformation of CD59ICM scoreColor in Fig. 7AProbe initial position−111.59RedProbe position moved 1−113.1PurpleProbe position moved 2−90.73GreenOpen conformation of CD59ICM scoreColor in Fig. 7BProbe initial position−129.27RedProbe position moved 1−129.48PurpleProbe position moved 2−129.17Green Open table in a new tab Results from this study indicate a 6 amino acid sequence of human C9, spanning residues 366-371, represents the primary CD59 recognition domain involved in CD59-mediated regulation of MAC formation. CD59 controls MAC formation by binding to C8α and C9 in the assembling complex (C5b-8 and C5b-9), and the current data also indicate that both C8α and C9 bind to a similar or overlapping site on CD59. Furthermore, data from CD59 peptide docking models are consistent with the C9 binding site on CD59 being located at a hydrophobic pocket, putatively identified previously by CD59 mutational studies (18Yu J. Abagyan R.A. Dong S. Gilbert A. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Huang Y. Smith C.A. Song H. Morgan B.P. Abagyan R.

Med. 1997; 185: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Specificity of the identified C9-derived peptide sequence that interacts with CD59 (VSLAFS) was shown experimentally by: (i) direct peptide binding to CD59, in both solid phase and solution, (ii) peptide-mediated inhibition of CD59 binding to C9, and (iii) peptide-mediated blockade of CD59 function. The ability of the C9-derived peptides to inhibit the binding of CD59 to C8 indicated that C8α and C9 interact with an overlapping epitope on CD59. A previous report indicated that the primary CD59 interaction in the C8α is contained between residues 320-415, and likely centered around 334-385 (14Lockert D.H. Kaufman K.M. Chang C.-P. Huesler T. Sodetz J.M. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19723-19728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This region of C8α aligns with the same region of C9 previously shown to be recognized by CD59 (14Lockert D.H. Kaufman K.M. Chang C.-P. Huesler T. Sodetz J.M. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19723-19728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and a 25-residue peptide derived from within this region of C9 (359-384) was subsequently shown to specifically bind CD59 (16Huesler T. Lockert D.H. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, the aligned CD59-interacting C8α and C9 sequences exhibit only limited sequence identity and homology, and whether C8α and C9 bind to a similar CD59 site was unexplored. Here we provide experimental evidence that C8α and C9 bind to an overlapping site on CD59. Interestingly, an alignment of the VSLAFS C9-derived sequence with the 320-415 CD59 binding sequence of C8α retrieved a single sequence of relatively high hydrophobic homology: LGIQYE (350-355). In addition, these 6-residue C8α and C9 sequences correspond to similar positions within the aligned sequences of C8α and C9. Whereas our data suggest that the CD59 binding sites of C8α and C9 are structurally similar, it is of note that previous studies have shown that the CD59 binding site of C8α, but not of C9, is conformationally sensitive (C8α requires disulfide bond formation (14Lockert D.H.

Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26424-26430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), suggesting that the CD59 binding sites on the two proteins are structurally dissimilar but comprise distinct motifs. Of further interest, the alignment of human, rabbit, horse, rat, and mouse C9 reveals that the region containing the identified 6-residue CD59 binding sequence corresponds to short sequence of particularly low homology (supplemental data). It is possible that this may relate to the species selectivity of CD59. The identified hydrophobic C9 sequence that interacts with CD59 is likely buried within the protein core, which would be consistent with the known mechanism of action of CD59 in that CD59 does not bind free plasma C9, but binds to C9 as it undergoes a structural rearrangement upon binding to C5b-8 in the nascent complex. Together with data indicating the hydrophobic nature of the binding site on CD59 for C9, it is therefore very likely that C9-CD59 binding occurs through a predominantly hydrophobic interaction, a supposition further supported by molecular modeling studies. The docking studies performed cannot address the native conformation of the complete C9 protein, nor its potential for unfolding prior to interactions with CD59. However, the studies do illustrate that plausible conformations of the core motifs present in the C9 peptide can interact specifically with CD59. The inability of the ICM program to produce convergent ligand conformations with the closed conformation of CD59 suggests this conformation is unproductive for C9 ligand binding. Conversely, the more open CD59 conformation with a larger target pocketsize can support convergent 6-mer docking, suggesting that the active conformation of Arg55 in CD59 in vivo is more likely to be similar to the open than the closed conformation. Taken together, the data from the modeling studies offer plausible interactions to illustrate the means by which C9-derived peptides might interact with the particular locale on the human CD59 surface that has been implicated in C9 binding experimentally by both CD59 mutagenesis (18Yu J. Abagyan R.A. Dong S. Gilbert A. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Huang Y. Smith C.A. Song H. Morgan B.P. Abagyan R.

We isolated several peptides by phage display that bound to human CD59 and identified four consensus sequences. However, there was no sequence homology with C8α or C9, none of the peptides interfered with CD59 function, and only one peptide inhibited C9 binding to CD59 (and only moderately). CD59 is a multifunctional protein; it binds to cholesterol-dependent cytolysin intermedilysin (24Giddings K.S. Zhao J. Sims P.J. Tweten R.K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), cell adhesion molecule CD2 (25Deckert M. Kubar J. Zoccola D. Bernard-Pomier G. Angelisova P. Horejsi V. Bernard A. Eur. J.

Parolini S. Sivori S. Romeo E. Millo R. Moretta L. Bottino C. Moretta A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 3367-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Nothing is known concerning the binding interface between CD59 and these other ligands, but it is possible that phage display-derived peptides may interfere with one or more of these interactions. Indeed, it is also possible that some of these ligands share an overlapping binding site on CD59 with C8α and C9, and that C9-derived peptides interfere with the binding of these other ligands. We had previously shown that a synthetic peptide derived from the C9 hinge region (247-261) bound CD59 and enhanced complement lysis of human erythrocytes (which are protected by endogenously expressed CD59) (17Tomlinson S. Whitlow M.B. Nussenzweig V. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1927-1934PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was subsequently reported that CD59 did not specifically bind to fusion proteins containing the hinge sequence, and that the enhanced lytic activity was caused by a direct membrane perturbing effect of the peptide (23Chang C.-P. Huesler T. Zhao J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26424-26430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, in the current study, we were unable to demonstrate CD59 binding of any shorter peptides derived from within the hinge region. Together with the data reported here on the VSLAFS C9 sequence, it is concluded that the hinge region of C9 is not involved in the inhibitory function of CD59. CD59 is widely expressed on tumor cells, often at elevated levels, and CD59 blockade enhances antibody and complement-mediated tumor cell lysis. On the other hand, the MAC is thought to play a pathogenic role in various inflammatory conditions, and blocking MAC formation may represent a therapeutic option. Understanding the molecular interaction between CD59 and its complement ligands has implications for the design of therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking CD59 activity or blocking MAC formation. The identification of a 6-residue sequence of human C9 as the primary CD59 recognition domain may enable the development of assays and small molecule therapeutics in the area of binding. Understanding the CD59-C9 interaction may also enable rational design of CD59 mutations to engineer improved CD59-based therapeutics, and results from the present study will permit a rational approach for further investigation of activity-enhancing mutations.

So far only a few functions have been ascribed to steryl glycosides. The yeast Pichia pastoris requires a functional sterol glucosyltransferase for proper degradation of peroxisomes (15Stasyk O.V. Nazarko T.Y. Stasyk O.G. Krasovska O.S. Warnecke D. Nicaud J.M. Cregg J.M. Sibirny A.A. Cell Biol. Int. 2003; 27: 947-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16Oku M. Warnecke D. Noda T.

A mutant of the plant pathogenic fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides defective in the sterol glucosyltransferase shows reduced pathogenicity on avocado plants (17Kim Y.K. Wang Y. Liu Z.M. Kolattukudy P.E. Plant J. 2002; 30: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Sitosteryl glucoside in cotton was suggested to serve as a precursor for the biosynthesis of sitosteryl cellodextrins to be used for the initial step of cellulose biosynthesis (18Peng L. Kawagoe Y. Hogan P. Delmer D. Science. 2002; 295: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The cholesteryl-α-glucosides of H. pylori support the pathogenicity of this organism, because inhibition of the cholesterol glucosyltransferase by O-glycans of the human gastric mucosa suppresses growth of the bacterium (19Kawakubo M.

Interestingly, morphological changes of the bacterium or changes in colony variants are accompanied by alterations in the total amount of steryl glucosides and the relative proportions of αCG, αCAG, and αCPG (20Tannaes T. Grav H.J. Bukholm G. Apmis. 2000; 108: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Shimomura H. Hayashi S. Yokota K. Oguma K. Hirai Y. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2004; 237: 407-413PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that a better understanding of cholesteryl glucoside biosynthesis in H. pylori would be useful for further studies on host-pathogen interactions. Therefore, the aim of our study was to identify the gene encoding the cholesterol-α-glucosyltransferase in the genome of the bacterium. A single candidate gene was selected and its function in lipid biosynthesis determined by the generation of a knock-out mutant of H. pylori. The activity of the corresponding enzyme was characterized by its heterologous expression in Escherichia coli and the yeast P. pastoris with subsequent lipid analyses and in vitro enzyme assays. Bacterial and Yeast Strains, Growth, and Recombinant DNA Techniques—E. coli strains XL1-Blue (MRF′) (Stratagene) and C41(DE3) (22Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar) were routinely grown aerobically at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Ampicillin (100 mg·liter–1) or kanamycin (45 mg·liter–1) were included for growth of plasmid-bearing cells. The yeast strain used in this study was P. pastoris JC 308 Δgcs/Δugt51B1 (24Hillig I. Leipelt M. Ott C. Zähringer U. Warnecke D. Heinz E. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), grown at 30 °C in YPD medium (10 g·liter–1 yeast extract, 20 g·liter–1 peptone, 20 g·liter–1 glucose). For gene expression driven by the AOX1 promoter, 0.5% methanol was added to minimal medium (13.4 g·liter–1 Yeast Nitrogen Base). H. pylori strain P12 was grown on agar plates containing 10% horse serum in a microaerophilic atmosphere (generated by Campy-Gen, Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) at 37 °C for 48 h. Bacteria were harvested, suspended to an optical density at 550 nm (A550) of 0.1 in brain heart infusion broth containing 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, and grown for 18 h under microairophilic conditions. H. pylori was harvested, washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the bacterial pellet was used for further lipid extraction or in vitro assays. The vectors pBluescript (Stratagene), pET24d(+) (Novagen), and pPIC3.5 (Invitrogen) were used for cloning. Standard methods were followed for DNA isolation, restriction endonuclease analysis, and ligation (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Deletion of HP0421 in H. pylori—For the construction of the P12Δ0421 strain two 0.5-kb DNA fragments upstream and downstream of the HP0421 open reading frame (ORF) (GeneID: 900074) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pBluescript, separated by a chloramphenicol resistance cassette. The plasmid was introduced into H. pylori strain P12 by natural transformation. Transformation and homologous recombination was performed by harvesting bacteria from serum plates and suspending to an A550 of 0.1 in brain heart infusion broth containing 10% fetal calf serum. DNA was added (1 μg), and incubation was extended for 5 h under microaerophilic conditions before the suspension was plated on selective serum plates. Correct allelic exchange of the HP0421 gene with the resistance gene was verified by polymerase chain reaction. Fractionation of H. pylori Homogenate—To isolate cytosolic and membrane fractions of H. pylori, bacteria were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2 including a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete™, Roche) and disrupted by 4 passages through a French press at 15,000 lb/in2. Removal of intact bacteria by two centrifugations at 4,000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min resulted in a cell-free homogenate. This homogenate was subjected to centrifugation at 164,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatant represented the cytosolic fraction, whereas the pellet representing the membrane fraction was washed and resuspended in buffer (see above). Cloning of the Cholesterol-α-glucosyltransferase from H. pylori—The ORF sequence of the cholesterol-α-glucosyltransferase gene HP0421 from H. pylori 26695 was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using the specific oligonucleotide primer pairs HP0421_F (5′-GTACGGATCCACCATGGTTATTGTTTTAGTCGTGGATAG-3′) and HP0421_R (5′-ACGTGGATCCCGTGCGGCCGCTGATAAGGTTTTAAAGAGATGGGGG-3′). Herculase-enhanced DNA lymerase (Stratagene) was used for the amplification of the 1169-bp product containing the entire HP0421 ORF sequence. This amplicon was digested with NcoI/BamHI and inserted into pET24d(NcoI/BamHI) leading to pET24d-HP0421, which was used for transformation of E. coli C41(DE3) cells. The amplicon was also digested with BamHI/NotI to be inserted into pPIC3.5(BamHI/NotI) resulting in pPIC3.5-HP0421 which was used to transform P. pastoris. Exact in-frame cloning and identity of the PCR-cloned fragments were confirmed by sequencing. Heterologous Expression of the ORF HP0421 in E. coli and P. pastoris—E. coli C41(DE3) (22Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar) was used as expression host for the plasmid pET24d-HP0421. After transformation, 50-ml cultures of E. coli were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.8–1.2. Induction was performed by adding 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside and further incubation for 3 h at 30 °C. A P. pastoris strain deficient in glycolipid biosynthesis was used to express HP0421: JC 308 Δgcs::Sh ble, Δugt51B1::URA3, ade1, arg4, his4 (24Hillig I. Leipelt M. Ott C. Zähringer U. Warnecke D. Heinz E. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In a first step, this strain was transformed with the empty vectors pBLADE and pBLARG (25Lin Cereghino G.P. Lin Cereghino J. Sunga A.J. Johnson M.A. Lim M. Gleeson M.A. Cregg J.M. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 263: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) to increase its rate of growth. Subsequently, the resulting strain, DKO (JC 308 Δgcs::Sh ble, Δugt51B1::URA3, his4) was used for transformation with pPIC3.5-HP0421 leading to DKO-Hp. Transformed cells were grown at 30 °C in 50 ml of YPD medium to an A600 between 1 and 2. Expression was driven by the strong AOX1 promoter and induced by transferring the cells to minimal medium with 0.5% methanol as sole carbon source followed by additional incubation for 20 h. In Vitro Sterol Glucosyltransferase Assay—E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation (4 °C, 10 min, 3200 × g), resuspended in 2–3 ml buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol), and cooled in an ice bath. Disruption of E. coli cells was performed by ultrasonication (probe tip, 10 times for 10 s). Cell debris were removed by centrifugation (4 °C, 10 min, 3200 × g), and the supernatant fractions representing the cell-free homogenates were used for in vitro assays. The assay for the cholesterol-α-glucosyltransferase activity was performed similar to the assay used for the eukaryotic sterol-β-glucosyltransferases (3Warnecke D. Erdmann R. Fahl A. Hube B. Müller F. Zank T. Zähringer U. Heinz E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13048-13059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 26Warnecke D.C. Heinz E. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 1067-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Shortly, the assay mixture contained in a total volume of 100 μl: 5–30 μl (40–240 μg of protein) of H. pylori or E. coli cell homogenate, either 5 μl of a solution of 4 mm cholesterol in ethanol (200 μm final concentration) or 4 μl of 270,000 dpm [4-14C]cholesterol in ethanol (final concentration 44 μm, specific activity 2.1 GBq/mmol) and either 100,000 dpm of UDP-[U-14C]glucose (final concentration 1.5 μm, specific activity 12.2 GBq/mmol) or 10 μl of 5 mm unlabeled UDP-glucose (final concentration 0.5 mm). After incubating for 30 min at 30 °C the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.7 ml of 0.45% NaCl solution and either 2 ml of ethyl acetate or 3 ml of chloroform/methanol 2:1. After vortexing and phase separation by centrifugation, the radioactivity in the organic phase was determined by scintillation counting or the extracted lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) or high performance TLC (HPTLC). The radioactivity on the silica gel plate was detected by radioscanning with a BAS-1000 Bio Imaging Analyser (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). Lipid Extraction and Analysis—P. pastoris or H. pylori cells were harvested by centrifugation (4 °C, 10 min, 3200 × g) and the sedimented cells were boiled for 10 min in a water bath. Lipid extraction was performed with chloroform/methanol 1:2 (v/v) and chloroform/methanol 2:1 (v/v). The lipid extract was washed by Folch partitioning (27Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (chloroform/methanol/0.45% NaCl solution, 2:1:0.75) and the organic phase was evaporated. The residue was redissolved in pyridine (because of the low solubility of steryl glucosides in chloroform/methanol mixtures) and subjected to analytical and preparative TLC. For NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS), the purified glycolipids were acetylated (with acetic anhydride in pyridine, 1:1) overnight at room temperature and subjected to repurification by preparative TLC in diethyl ether. Electrospray Ionization Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometry—High resolution electrospray ionization Fourier-transform mass spectrometric (ESI FT-MS) analyses of acetylated glycolipids were performed in the positive and/or negative ion mode using an APEX II-Instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) equipped with an actively shielded 7 Tesla magnet and an Apollo II ESI source. Mass spectra were acquired using standard experimental sequences as provided by the manufacturer. For the positive ion mode samples (∼10 ng·μl–1) were dissolved in a 50:50:0.03 (v/v/v) mixture of 2-propyl alcohol, water, 30 mm ammonium acetate adjusted with acetic acid to pH 4.5. For the negative ion mode samples (∼10 ng·μl–1) were dissolved in a 50:50:0.001 (v/v/v) mixture of 2-propyl alcohol, water, and triethylamine (pH 8.5). The samples were sprayed at a flow rate of 2 μl·min–1. Capillary entrance voltage was set to 3.8 kV, and drying gas temperature to 150 °C. Because the spectra comprise the molecular species in different charge states, the spectra were charge-deconvoluted, using the XMASS-6.1 software, and mass numbers given refer to monoisotopic masses of the neutral molecules. Proton (1H) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy—1H NMR spectra were recorded at 360 MHz (Bruker Avance DPX 360) according to Hölzl et al. (28Hölzl G. Leipelt M. Ott C. Zähringer U. Lindner B. Warnecke D. Heinz E. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 874-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A Single Candidate Gene in the Genome of H. pylori Was Identified as the Putative Cholesterol-α-glucosyltransferase Gene—To discover putative cholesterol-α-glucosyltransferase genes in H. pylori, a BLAST data base search (29Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar) with the amino acid sequence of the sterol β-glucosyltransferase from Arabidopsisthaliana (1Warnecke D.C. Baltrusch M. Buck F. Wolter F.P. Heinz E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was performed. No sequence of significant similarity was found in the genome of H. pylori. This result was not surprising considering that glycosyltransferases operate with two different catalytic mechanisms and are classified according to the stereochemistries of the reaction substrates and products as either retaining or inverting enzymes (30Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). While the plant β-glucosyltransferase belongs to the inverting enzymes, the α-glucosyltransferase from H. pylori probably works by the retaining mechanism. As a result, candidate cholesterol-α-glucosyltransferase genes from H. pylori had to be identified by a different approach. Cholesterol biosynthesis is a typical eukaryotic feature and this lipid is available for bacteria only from eukaryotic sources. Therefore, we speculated that the cholesterol-α-glucosyltransferase from H. pylori may have developed from an ancient bacterial α-glycosyltransferase of originally different acceptor specificity. This hypothesis is supported by a similar situation in another group of enzymes, the acyl-CoA-dependent acyltransferases. Whereas an acyl-CoA-dependent cholesterol acyltransferase had been cloned and characterized in 1993 (31Chang C.C. Huh H.Y. Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20747-20755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), all efforts to clone a diacylglycerol acyltransferase failed for many years. This important enzyme was finally identified, since a protein with amino acid sequence similarities to the cholesterol acyltransferase turned out to transfer the acyl group not to cholesterol, but to diacylglycerol (32Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y.W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S. Collins C. Welch C.B. Lusis A.J. Erickson S.K. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13018-13023Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Thus, cholesterol and diacylglycerol acyltransferases have a common ancestor. By extrapolating this cholesterol/diacylglycerol correlation to glycosyltransferases, we concluded that the H. pylori cholesterol-α-glucosyltransferase might have developed from a bacterial diacylglycerol-α-glycosyltransferase. Indeed, such diacylglycerol α-glucosyl and galactosyltransferases have been identified in Acholeplasma laidlawii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Deinococcus radiodurans, and Thermotoga maritima (33Berg S. Edman M. Li L. Wikstrom M. Wieslander A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22056-22063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 34Hölzl G. Zähringer U. Warnecke D. Heinz E. Plant Cell Physiol. 2005; 46: 1766-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A BLAST search with the sequence of the diacylglycerol α-glucosyltransferase from A. laidlawii (33Berg S. Edman M. Li L. Wikstrom M. Wieslander A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22056-22063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) revealed a single sequence in H. pylori with low but significant similarity (42% similarity, 19% identity). This hypothetical protein, HP0421, was the most promising candidate to be tested for cholesterol-α-glycosyltransferase activity. The selection of this candidate was checked by a survey of hypothetical glycosyltransferases at the Carbohydrate Active enZYme server (35Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). This data base identified 21 hypothetical glycosyltransferase genes in the genome of H. pylori 26695 (23 in H. pylori J99), from which 5 (7 in H. pylori J99) represent retaining glycosyltransferases. The hypothetical protein HP0421 consists of 389 amino acids, is a member of the glycosyltransferase family 4 (GT4), and shows sequence similarities to several members of the family with diacylglycerol glycosyltransferase activity (Fig. 2). To elucidate the function of HP0421, we generated a knockout mutant of H. pylori and expressed HP0421 in E. coli and P. pastoris. Deletion of the HP0421 Gene in H. pylori Led to the Loss of Cholesteryl-α-glucoside and Its Three Derivatives—A HP0421 knock-out strain of H. pylori P12 was generated by insertion of a chloramphenicol resistance cassette. The deletion of HP0421 in H. pylori resulted in the loss of cholesterol-α-glucosyltransferase activity determined by in vitro enzyme assays with homogenates of H. pylori cells and radiolabeled substrates (Fig. 3A). In addition, TLC of lipid extracts of the cells revealed that 4 glycolipids present in wild-type extracts were absent in the extracts of the knock-out mutants (Fig. 3B). Three of them, αCG, αCAG, and αCPG have been identified before (9Hirai Y. Haque M. Yoshida T. Yokota K. Yasuda T. Oguma K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5327-5333Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Analysis of the purified and peracetylated lipids by MS and NMR-spectroscopy confirmed their structures (data not shown). On the other hand, the compound with the lowest Rf value had not been described previously. Therefore, it was isolated, and its structure elucidated by MS. The mass spectrum (supplemental Fig. S1) comprised two abundant and one minor molecular species the masses of which were in agreement with the mass of peracetylated cholesteryl-lysophosphatidyl-hexoside which carried either a C18:1, a cyclopropane C19:0 or a C14:0 fatty acid (supplemental Fig. S1). From these data we conclude that the glycolipid of H. pylori with the smallest Rf value represents cholesteryl-6′-O-lysophosphatidyl-α-glucopyranoside derived from α-CPG by the loss of one fatty acid residue. The deletion of HP0421 in H. pylori and lipid analysis of this mutant demonstrate that this gene is essential for the biosynthesis of αCG and its three derivatives in H. pylori. Heterologous Expression of HP0421 in P. pastoris Resulted in the Biosynthesis of Ergosteryl-α-glucoside—P. pastoris constitutively synthesizes ceramide, diacylglycerol, and sterols either as intermediates or end products of lipid metabolism. Therefore, P. pastoris represents an appropriate host for the expression of glycosyltransferases, which require one of these lipids as glycosyl acceptors (28Hölzl G. Leipelt M. Ott C. Zähringer U.

Lipid analysis of the transformed cells showed the formation of a new glycolipid in the strain expressing HP0421 (Fig. 4). This glycolipid was isolated, peracetylated and appeared as two partially separated compounds after purification by TLC, which were subjected to MS and NMR spectroscopy.

https://openalex.org/W2012829930,"Little is known about the pathogenesis of Entamoeba histolytica and how epithelial cells respond to the parasite. Herein, we characterized the interactions between E. histolytica and colonic epithelial cells and the role macrophages play in modulating epithelial cell responses. The human colonic epithelial cell lines Caco-2 and T84 were grown either as monoculture or co-cultured in transwell plates with differentiated human THP-1 macrophages for 24 h before stimulation with soluble amebic proteins (SAP). In naive epithelial cells, prolonged stimulation with SAP reduced the levels of heat shock protein (Hsp) 27 and 72. However in THP-1 conditioned intestinal epithelial cells SAP enhanced Hsp27 and Hsp72, which was dependent on the activation of ERK MAP kinase. Hsp synthesis induced by SAP conferred protection against oxidative and apoptotic injuries. Treatment with SAP inhibited NF-κB activation induced by interleukin-1β; specifically, the NF-κB-DNA binding, nuclear translocation of p65 subunit, and phosphorylation of IκB-α were reduced. Gene silencing by small interfering RNA confirmed the role of Hsp27 in suppressing NF-κB activation at IκB kinase (IKK) level. By co-immunoprecipitation studies, we found that Hsp27 interacts with IKK-α and IKK-β, and this association was increased in SAP-treated conditioned epithelial cells. Overexpression of wild type Hsp27 amplified the effects of SAP, whereas a phosphorylation-deficient mutant of Hsp27 abrogated SAP-induced NF-κB inhibition. In conditioned epithelial cells, Hsp27 was phosphorylated at serine 15 after prolonged exposure to SAP. This mechanism may explain the absence of colonic inflammation seen in the majority of individuals infected with E. histolytica. Little is known about the pathogenesis of Entamoeba histolytica and how epithelial cells respond to the parasite. Herein, we characterized the interactions between E. histolytica and colonic epithelial cells and the role macrophages play in modulating epithelial cell responses. The human colonic epithelial cell lines Caco-2 and T84 were grown either as monoculture or co-cultured in transwell plates with differentiated human THP-1 macrophages for 24 h before stimulation with soluble amebic proteins (SAP). In naive epithelial cells, prolonged stimulation with SAP reduced the levels of heat shock protein (Hsp) 27 and 72. However in THP-1 conditioned intestinal epithelial cells SAP enhanced Hsp27 and Hsp72, which was dependent on the activation of ERK MAP kinase. Hsp synthesis induced by SAP conferred protection against oxidative and apoptotic injuries. Treatment with SAP inhibited NF-κB activation induced by interleukin-1β; specifically, the NF-κB-DNA binding, nuclear translocation of p65 subunit, and phosphorylation of IκB-α were reduced. Gene silencing by small interfering RNA confirmed the role of Hsp27 in suppressing NF-κB activation at IκB kinase (IKK) level. By co-immunoprecipitation studies, we found that Hsp27 interacts with IKK-α and IKK-β, and this association was increased in SAP-treated conditioned epithelial cells. Overexpression of wild type Hsp27 amplified the effects of SAP, whereas a phosphorylation-deficient mutant of Hsp27 abrogated SAP-induced NF-κB inhibition. In conditioned epithelial cells, Hsp27 was phosphorylated at serine 15 after prolonged exposure to SAP. This mechanism may explain the absence of colonic inflammation seen in the majority of individuals infected with E. histolytica. The intestinal protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica affects 50 million people worldwide, causing 100,000 deaths per year (1World Health Organization The World Health Report. Geneva, Switzerland1998: 51-54Google Scholar). Intestinal amebiasis is characterized by colitis and severe dysentery. Despite our knowledge of the role of several pathogen and host factors in causing colonic inflammation, the cell-specific response to amebic infection is poorly understood. Moreover, the majority of research done to unravel the mechanism of amebic colitis has been focused on proinflammatory responses (2Eckamann L. Reed S.L. Smith J.R. Kagnoff M.F. J. Clin.

However, it is noteworthy that only 10% of E. histolytica-infected individuals show symptoms of intestinal inflammation (6Stauffer W. Ravdin J.I. Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 2003; 16: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and none of the studies addressed the question of why only a minority of infected individuals develops amebic colitis.Epithelial cells are the first layer of host defense and have been shown to be the effector cells capable of secreting several mediators in response to pathogens (7Hecht G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C351-C358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hurley B.P. McCormick B.A. Curr. Gastroenterol. Rep. 2004; 6: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Epithelial cells in vivo do not respond in isolation but act in concert with several immune and nonimmune cells present in the lamina propria. To simulate this, several in vitro studies were carried out to assess the epithelial cell responses in the presence of immune cells such as leukocytes and lymphocytes. Under these conditions, a differential response was observed in epithelial cell lines exposed to various pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria (9Haller D. Bode C. Hammes W.P. Pfeifer A.M. Schiffrin E.J. Blum S. Gut. 2000; 47: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 10Haller D. Holt L. Parlesak A. Zanga J. Bauerlein A. Sartor R.B. Jobin C. Immunology. 2004; 112: 310-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the effect of co-culturing with macrophages on epithelial cell responses has not been well characterized.The universal response to stress has been the induction of a group of highly conserved family of proteins called heat shock proteins (Hsp) and is commonly referred to as heat shock response or stress response. Several pathogens and their products have been shown to induce various Hsp in different cell types including intestinal epithelial cells (11Deitch E.A. Beck S.C. Cruz N.C. De Maio A. Crit.

Hsp serve to protect the cells against several insults such as thermal, toxic, or apoptotic stimuli (12Malago J.J. Koninkx J.F.J.G. Van Dijk J.E.

Epithelial cell induction of Hsp in response to various pathogens such as E. coli, and toxins such as lipopolysaccharide and superantigen have been reported (10Haller D. Holt L. Parlesak A. Zanga J. Bauerlein A. Sartor R.B. Jobin C. Immunology. 2004; 112: 310-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 12Malago J.J. Koninkx J.F.J.G. Van Dijk J.E.

It has also been shown that epithelial Hsp expression is regulated by cytokines and immune cells such as lymphocytes (13Kojima K. Musch M.W. Ren H. Boone D.L. Hendrickson B.A. Ma A. Chang E.B. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 1395-1407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). One emerging concept is that stress response counters the inflammatory response mediated by NF-κB, helping to reduce inflammation and promote healing of damaged tissues (12Malago J.J. Koninkx J.F.J.G. Van Dijk J.E. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2002; 7: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 17Yoo C.G. Lee S. Lee C.T. Kim Y.W. Han S.K. Shim Y.S. J.

Because proinflammatory cytokines secreted by immune cells have been shown to influence epithelial cell responses (16Musch M.W. Petrof E.O. Kojima K. Ren H. McKay D.M. Chang E.B. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 3187-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Schmitz H. Rokos K. Florian P. Gitter A.H. Fromm M. Scholz P. Ullrich R. Zeitz M. Pauli G. Schulzke J.D. AIDS. 2002; 16: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and macrophages are a major source of these cytokines, we studied the effect of macrophages on epithelial cell response toward E. histolytica. We hypothesized that amebae might be eliciting a protective response whereby inflammation is suppressed in the majority of infected individuals. Thus, we sought to study the stress response induced by ameba components in naïve and macrophage-conditioned colonic epithelial cells and made several interesting and novel observations. For the first time, we showed that macrophage conditioning primes epithelial cells for an augmented Hsp expression in response to amebic components. We identified Hsp27 as the key mediator suppressing NF-κB activation by virtue of its association with IκB kinase (IKK) complex in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). We conclude that this could be one of the mechanisms by which colonic inflammation is suppressed in the majority of E. histolytica-infected individuals and that the lack of such protective responses in a susceptible individual could lead to the symptoms associated with amebic colitis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines, Amebic Components, and Reagents—Human colonic adenocarcinomal cell lines T84 and Caco-2 from ATCC (Manassas, VA) were used and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-Ham's F-12 medium and minimal essential medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 20 mm HEPES (Sigma). Human THP-1 macrophages were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in complete RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories). To obtain adherent macrophages, 2 × 106 cells/well in 6-well culture plates were allowed to differentiate in the presence of 10 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma) for 3 days. The macrophages were washed and made quiescent by incubation in complete RPMI 1640 medium for 24 h prior to co-culturing. Soluble amebic proteins (SAP) were prepared by three cycles of freeze-thaw lysis of log phase E. histolytica virulent strain HM1:IMSS and quantified by the BCA assay (Pierce). E. histolytica secretory components were prepared as described previously (5Yu Y. Chadee K. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 1536-1547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Fas ligand and Caspase 3 antibody are from Oncogene. Antibody against NF-B p65 and MAP kinases, double-stranded NF-κB oligonucleotide (sc-2505), and all of the siRNA reagents are from Santa Cruz Biotech. Anti-IKK antibodies are from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies against human Hsp27, Hsp72, Hsp60, Hsp90, HSF-1 phospho-Hsp27 (Ser15), phospho-Hsp27 (Ser72), and hamster Hsp27 (Hsp25) are from Stressgen (Victoria, Canada). For immunoprecipitation, agarose-conjugated goat antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotech were employed: Hsp27 (sc-1048), Hsp60 (sc-1722), Hsp72 (sc-1060), and Hsp90 (sc-1055). For overexpression studies, hamster Hsp25 was used. PD98059 was obtained from Calbiochem. All other chemicals are from Sigma. The inhibitors galactose, E-64, and cycloheximide were used at slightly higher concentrations than those that have been previously demonstrated to have their intended effects (22Moncada D. Keller K. Chadee K. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 838-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 23Boettner D.R. Huston C.D. Sullivan J.A. Petri Jr., W.A. Infect.

For siRNA experiments, subconfluent (40–50%) Caco-2 cells grown for 2–3 days were used. Human monocyte-like cell line THP-1 was differentiated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 3 days and quiescence for 24 h before use. Transwells with epithelial cells were kept in culture plates containing 2 × 106 macrophages for 24 h (30h for siRNA studies), removed from co-culture, and immediately used for experiments. Epithelial cells were kept under low serum condition (5% fetal bovine serum) during co-culturing and subsequent treatments and without antibiotics for siRNA studies.Western Blot—Cellular extracts from amebic protein-treated epithelial cells were prepared by scraping into the sample buffer containing SDS and mercaptoethanol and boiled for 10 min, and equal volumes were separated in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). For nonreducing gel run, sample buffer without mercaptoethanol was used. The membranes were blocked in 3.5% skim milk-TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl. 0.1% Tween 20) at 4 °C overnight, incubated with primary antibodies in 1% skim milk-TBS-T at 4 °C overnight, washed three times with TBS-T, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in skim milk-TBST overnight at 4 °C. After three washes each in TBS-T and TBS-3T, the blot was developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were collected using the NE-PER kit (Pierce) and protein quantified by BCA assay. Annealed double-stranded heat shock element oligonucleotide–107 to –83 of the human Hsp70 gene (5′-GAT CTC GGC TGG AAT ATT CCC GAC CTG GCA GCC GA-3′) (Sigma Genosys) or NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was labeled with [32P]ATP, using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen). Unlabeled nucleotides were removed using Sephadex G-25 columns. The binding reaction consists of a 20-liter total volume of 0.5 ng of DNA probe, 5 g of nuclear extract, 1 g of poly(dI-dC) in the binding buffer (12 mm HEPES, 60 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm of dithiothreitol, and 12% glycerol, pH 8.0), and incubation for 30 min at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels at 4 °C in TBE buffer (90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA). The gels were subsequently dried and autoradiographed with intensifying screens at –70 °C.Neutral Red Assay—Neutral red (Sigma) was reconstituted in serum-free medium and added to cells at 1.14 mm concentration. After 2 h of incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline; finally, the incorporated neutral red was released from the cells by incubation for 15 min at room temperature in the presence of 2 ml of the extraction buffer containing acetic acid (1%, v/v) and ethanol (50%, v/v). To measure the dye taken up, the cell lysis products were centrifuged, and the supernatants were spectrophotometrically measured at 540 nm.Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in 1% CHAPS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl with 1% CHAPS) with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). 500 μg of cell extracts were incubated overnight with 5 μg of agarose-conjugated anti-Hsp antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Precipitate was washed thrice with lysis buffer, dissolved in 2× Laemmli buffer, boiled, and separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and detected by Western blot analysis using ECL (Amersham Biosciences).RNA Interference—Caco-2 cells were transected with siRNA against HSF-1 (sc-35611), Hsp27 (sc-29350), Hsp70 (sc-29352), or control siRNA (sc-37007) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology as per the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, subconfluent (40–50%) Caco-2 cells were transfected using siRNA transfection reagent for 30 h during the co-culture at a siRNA concentration of 40 nm. The cells were immediately used for SAP and subsequent treatments.Overexpression of Wild Type and Phosphorylation-deficient Mutant Hsp27 in M-IEC—Plasmids (pcDNA3.1) encoding wild type hamster Hsp25 and phosphorylation deficient-mutant Hsp25 (AA) in which Ser15 and Ser90 are replaced by alanine were kindly provided by Dr. T. Tomako (McGill University, Montreal, Canada). Caco-2 cells were transfected with empty plasmid (vector), wild type, and AA by FuGENE reagent (Promega) overnight according to the manufacturer's instructions. A transfection efficiency of 50–60% was observed using a green fluorescent protein control. The cells were recovered for 24 h while simultaneously co-cultured with differentiated THP-1, and then at the end of 24 h, conditioned IEC was treated with SAP and IL-1β as described before.In Vitro Kinase Assay—Cells were incubated with cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm pyrophosphate, 1 mm orthovanadate, and 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaF with protease inhibitors) followed by the addition of anti-IKK-α antibody. Following overnight end-to-end rotation of tubes at 4 °C, immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm NaF, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Immunoprecipitates were finally resuspended in 20.0 μlof kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. 1 μg of glutathione S-transferase-IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as substrate. The reaction was terminated by boiling with SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Finally, the protein was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, the gel was dried, and the radioactive bands were visualized by autoradiography. The cell lysates were also checked for IKK-α expression for normalization.Statistical Analysis—The blots were scanned, and the densitometric values were obtained by using the Image J program. Statistical analysis to check significance was done with Student's t test using Prism software. The graphs plotted were from two to three independent experiments, and the error bars in all of the graphs represent the means ± S.D.RESULTSDifferential Induction of Hsp27 and Hsp72 in Naive and Macrophage-conditioned Epithelial Cells—Because the induction of Hsp is a universal stress response against various insults and has been widely shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect, we checked the expression of Hsp representing four families. Although SAP treatment suppressed Hsp27 and Hsp72 in naïve IEC (Fig. 1A), the same two Hsp were significantly overexpressed in macrophage-conditioned Caco-2 and T84 colonic epithelial cells (Fig. 1B). Expression levels of Hsp60 and 90 remained unaltered in both naïve and conditioned IEC (not shown). Surprisingly, even though both secretory components and SAP elicited this stress response, SAP was consistently found to be twice as potent as secretory components (Fig. 1C) and was therefore used for all further studies. It should be noted that co-culturing alone did not affect the basal Hsp expression significantly (Fig. 1B). Also, treatment of IEC with 24 h THP medium was sufficient to prime epithelial cells for ameba-induced Hsp72 induction (Fig. 2) without the need for co-culturing. This confirms that macrophage secretions can alter epithelial cell responses to pathogens.FIGURE 2Macrophage secretions prime IEC for Hsp induction. Caco-2 cells were treated with 24 h macrophage culture medium for 12 h before stimulating with SAP for different time points and checked for Hsp72 expression by Western blot.

Koninkx J.F.J.G. Van Dijk J.E. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2002; 7: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and Hsp have been shown to be regulated by different MAPK in intestinal epithelial cells (16Musch M.W. Petrof E.O. Kojima K. Ren H. McKay D.M. Chang E.B. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 3187-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25Tao Y. Drabik K.A. Waypa T.S. Musch M.W. Alverdy J.C. Schneewind O. Chang E.B.

As shown in Fig. 3A, when the conditioned epithelial cells was pretreated with PD98059, an ERK MAPK inhibitor, SAP-induced Hsp expression was significantly inhibited. Correspondingly we observed the activation of ERK MAPK by amebic proteins as early as 30 min (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Ameba-induced Hsp expression in macrophage-primed IEC is dependent on ERK MAP kinase. A, M-IEC were pretreated with ERK MAP kinase inhibitor PD98059 at different concentrations for 2 h and then stimulated with SAP (100 μg/ml) for 12 h (***, p < 0.001).

The pathogenic effects of the Gal-lectin and cysteine proteinases have been extensively documented (26Gilchrist C.A. Petri W.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and it was of interest to determine whether the up-regulation of Hsp72 is mediated by these virulent factors. As shown in Fig. 4, pretreatment of SAP with either galactose or E-64 failed to inhibit Hsp72 expression, indicating that Hsp induction by SAP is independent of Gal-lectin and cysteine proteinases. In contrast, significant abrogation of Hsp72 induction was noted by boiled SAP, suggesting that a yet to be characterized protein moiety might be responsible for this effect.FIGURE 4SAP induced Hsp72 induction is independent of Gal-lectin and cysteine protease. SAP was treated with 150 mm of d-galactose or 100 μm of E-64 for 1 h or boiled at 100 °C for 5 min before adding to the M-IEC for 12 h.

Quercetin is a flavanoid compound and a known inhibitor of Hsp synthesis by inhibiting HSF-1 (27Hosokawa N. Hirayoshi K. Kudo H. Takechi H. Aoike A. Kawai K. Nagata K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3490-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 28Nagai N. Nakai A. Nagata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 1099-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and it was of interest to determine whether it could inhibit SAP-mediated Hsp72 induction. As shown in Fig. 5A, quercetin (25 μm) significantly inhibited Hsp72 expression. Quercetins at high concentrations are known to inhibit protein synthesis. Thus, to confirm that quercetin inhibits SAP induced Hsp72 expression by inhibiting HSF-1 and not by inhibiting Hsp protein synthesis, we treated the cells with equimolar concentrations of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. Under these conditions cycloheximide treatment failed to inhibit SAP induced Hsp72 expression, confirming that amebic components indeed induce Hsp synthesis by activating HSF-1. To conclusively prove the role of HSF-1 in ameba-induced Hsp synthesis, we silenced the HSF-1 gene by siRNA (Fig. 5B) and observed inhibition of Hsp72 expression by SAP in macrophage-treated epithelial cells (Fig. 5C). Consistent with its role in regulating Hsp72 expression, HSF-1 was activated by amebic proteins as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5D). We found that amebic components were able to induce trimerization of HSF-1 in M-IEC at a time point of 3 h. There was a corresponding increase in the DNA binding activity of HSF-1, which was inhibited by pretreatment with quercetin (Fig. 5E). These studies confirm that amebic components activate HSF-,1 which in turn induces Hsp gene expression.FIGURE 5Amebic protein induced Hsp72 expression is mediated by HSF-1. A, M-IEC were treated with 25 μm of quercetin (QC) or cycloheximide (Chx) for 2 h before stimulating with SAP for 12 h (**, p < 0.01). B, M-IEC transfected with different concentrations of siRNA against HSF-1 for 30 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and Western blot was done with HSF-1 antibody. C, M-IEC cells were transfected or not with 40 nm HSF-1 siRNA for 30 h before treating with SAP for 12 h and checked for Hsp72 expression by Western blot as described. D, M-IEC was treated with SAP for different time points and cell extract collected and ran in a nonreducing gel and Western blot done with HSF-1 antibody as described. The arrows indicate activated dimeric and trimeric forms of HSF-1. E, M-IEC was incubated or not with quercetin (25 μm) for 2 h prior to treatment with SAP (100 μg/ml) for 3 h. 10.0 μg of nuclear extracts subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay as described.

https://openalex.org/W2016913536,"The tri-iodide-based chemiluminescence assay is the most widely used methodology for the detection of S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs) in biological samples. Because of the low RSNO levels detected in a number of biological compartments using this assay, criticism has been raised that this method underestimates the true values in biological samples. This claim is based on the beliefs that (i) acidified sulfanilamide pretreatment, required to remove nitrite, leads to RSNO degradation and (ii) that there is auto-capture of released NO by heme in the reaction vessel. Because our laboratories have used this assay extensively without ever encountering evidence that corroborated these claims, we sought to experimentally address these issues using several independent techniques. We find that RSNOs of glutathione, cysteine, albumin, and hemoglobin are stable in acidified sulfanilamide as determined by the tri-iodide method, copper/cysteine assay, Griess-Saville assay and spectrophotometric analysis. Quantitatively there was no difference in S-nitroso-hemoglobin (SNOHb) or S-nitroso-albumin (SNOAlb) using the tri-iodide method and a recently described modified assay using a ferricyanide-enhanced reaction mix at biologically relevant NO:heme ratios. Levels of SNOHb detected in human blood ranged from 20–100 nm with no arterial-venous gradient. We further find that 90% of the total NO-related signal in blood is caused by erythrocytic nitrite, which may partly be bound to hemoglobin. We conclude that all claims made thus far that the tri-iodide assay underestimates RSNO levels are unsubstantiated and that this assay remains the “gold standard” for sensitive and specific measurement of RSNOs in biological matrices.

These include factors that affect sensitivity, specificity and selectivity for distinct NO-related species and formation or destruction of products during sample preparation that can lead to an over- or underestimation of what is being detected. Many of these pitfalls often remain unrecognized for considerable time, and become apparent only long after publication of the original results, contributing to the confusion that surrounds the state-of-the-art. Such controversy and confusion surrounds the measurement of human S-nitroso-hemoglobin (SNOHb), with some groups reporting levels in blood as high as 5 μm (12Funai E.F. Davidson A. Seligman S.P. Finlay T.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 875-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) whereas others report levels of less than 50 nm (11Bryan N.S. Rassaf T. Rodriguez J. Feelisch M. Nitric Oxide. 2004; 10: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A similar discrepancy exists for measures of S-nitroso-albumin (SNOAlb), with original levels determined to amount to 6 μm (13Stamler J.S. Jaraki O. Osborne J. Simon D.I. Keaney J. Vita J. Singel D.

The micromolar levels of these species were often measured using high energy, high temperature UV photolysis to liberate NO from the protein for subsequent detection by gas phase chemiluminescence or fluorometry (13Stamler J.S.

Data has been published demonstrating that high energy photolysis releases NO from nitrosylhemes, RSNOs, and nitrite, and from nitrate in the presence of reduced thiol, suggesting that trace contamination of these other NO species may produce artifactual high levels that can be misinterpreted as SNOAlb and SNOHb (19Dejam A.

Low levels of S-nitrosated proteins in plasma and the red cell have been measured using one of the most sensitive and frequently used techniques for quantification of nitroso compounds in biological samples, the tri-iodide-based chemiluminescence assay. This assay was originally developed by Samouilov and Zweier (20Samouilov A. Zweier J.L. Anal.

Nevertheless, its merit continues to be challenged by proponents of the photolysis technique, who claim that the tri-iodide assay underestimates NO measurements because the “harsh chemical pretreatment” with acidified sulfanilamide, designed to remove nitrite prior to assaying for other NO-related species, destroys S-nitrosothiols (1Stamler J.S. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 29McMahon T.J. Moon R.E. Luschinger B.P. Carraway M.S. Stone A.E. Stolp B.W. Gow A.J. Pawloski J.R. Watke P. Singel D.J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 26720-26728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To date, however, no experimental results have been presented to substantiate this claim. A recent report by Rogers et al. (30Rogers S.C. Khalatbari A. Gapper P.W. Frenneaux M.P. James P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26720-26728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) has once more revived this lively debate. While the claim that the “harsh chemical pretreatment” reduces NO yields is still invoked by the authors with no supporting evidence, Rogers and colleagues now appear to provide extensive data suggesting that the tri-iodide method underestimates total NO-related products in red cells because of “auto-capture” of NO by the hemoglobin contained in the reaction solution. If true, these findings would explain the low to immeasurable amounts of nitroso compounds in human RBCs reported by groups using the tri-iodide assay without ferricyanide pretreatment. Rogers et al. further suggest that modifying the assay by adding ferricyanide to the iodine/iodide mixture limits NO autocapture. This modification is believed to trigger rapid hemoglobin oxidation to its ferric form, which due to its lower binding affinity for NO should enhance recovery (the Gladwin group pretreats samples with ferricyanide, essentially producing the same effect). Although the findings of Rogers et al. (30Rogers S.C. Khalatbari A. Gapper P.W. Frenneaux M.P. James P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26720-26728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) may seem well-founded to those not intimately familiar with tri-iodide based assays, the work contains several methodological problems that could account for the unusual effects and the quantities observed. For instance, Rogers et al. claim that the recovery of NO is limited at high hemoglobin concentrations in the standard assay; however, the effect they observe only occurs at extremely high heme concentrations never used by other laboratories. Based on the diminished amplitudes of the NO signals observed, the authors claim that less NO is recovered when hemoglobin concentrations are increased and attribute this effect to NO autocapture by heme; yet their own data show that the area under the curve for NO detection does not change with hemoglobin concentration. Another concern with the approach taken by Rogers et al. is the implicit and naïve assumption that nitrite trapped within RBCs would not contribute significantly to the overall signal measured. However, studies by the Schechter/Gladwin and Feelisch groups (11Bryan N.S. Rassaf T. Rodriguez J. Feelisch M. Nitric Oxide. 2004; 10: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 31Dejam A. Hunter C.J. Pelletier M.M. Hsu L.L. Machado R.F. Shiva S. Power G.G. Kelm M. Gladwin M.T. Schechter A.N. Blood. 2005; 106: 734-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) have now documented that red cells contain ∼300 nm nitrite, a level similar to the total “NO signal” measured by Rogers et al. (300–500 nm) (30Rogers S.C. Khalatbari A. Gapper P.W. Frenneaux M.P. James P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26720-26728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In light of the significance of the problem for an understanding of the role of NO in human RBCs and the questionable arguments against the standard tri-iodide assay used in our laboratories, we felt it important to scientifically address these issues raised by the work of Rogers et al. with a study that critically and experimentally assesses the validity of their claims. The results from our studies, which used multiple technologies and were carried out independently in two laboratories, demonstrate that NO autocapture by hemoglobin was of no concern in our standard tri-iodide assay and that the high NO content Rogers et al. measure in RBCs arises simply from the amount of nitrite present in those cells. Finally, we respond to the unsubstantiated criticism that our “harsh chemical pretreatment” for nitrite removal destroys RSNOs with uncontroversial evidence demonstrating that this pretreatment actually preserves them. Materials, Blood Sampling, and NO Detection—All chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were obtained at the highest purity available from Sigma-Aldrich. Blood was drawn from the antecubital vein of healthy volunteers and collected into tubes containing EDTA (2.5 mm) or heparin and DTPA (100 μm). Whole blood, plasma, and RBCs were obtained by centrifugation at 800 × g and 4 °C for 10 min, and RBCs were subjected to hypotonic lysis in water containing EDTA (1:4 v/v) without further delay. Nitrite and nitroso species in plasma and RBCs were quantified by reductive denitrosation of samples using a mixture of iodine/iodide in glacial acetic acid and subsequent detection of the liberated NO by gas-phase chemiluminescence reaction with ozone, either as detailed in Feelisch et al. (23Feelisch M. Rassaf T. Mnaimneh S. Singh N. Bryan N.S. Jourd'Heuil D. Kelm M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) and Gladwin et al. (16Gladwin M.T. Shelhamer J.H. Schechter A.N. Pease-Fye M.E. Waclawiw M.A. Panza J.A. Ognibene F.P. Cannon 3rd., R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11482-11487Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), or using a modification of this assay additionally containing 25 mm potassium ferricyanide in the reaction mix as described by Rogers et al. (30Rogers S.C. Khalatbari A. Gapper P.W. Frenneaux M.P. James P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26720-26728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For calculation of the area under the curve (AUC) of NO peaks raw data from the chemiluminescence analyzer were processed using the Origin software. In a subset of experiments, fresh RBC lysate was passed over a Sephadex G-25 column (PD10, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with nitrite-free buffer at room temperature. Fractions were immediately collected in 25 equal aliquots of 10 drops (∼600 μl) and analyzed. Immediately upon separation, RBCs were either hypotonically lysed and analyzed or snap-frozen for later analysis. Frozen RBCs were thawed at 37 °C for 3 min and immediately lysed and analyzed for direct comparison to fresh lysate. Stability of S-Nitrosothiols in Acidified Sulfanilamide—S-nitroso-glutathione (GSNO) was purchased from Cayman. S-Nitroso-l-cysteine (CSNO) was prepared from acidified nitrite and cysteine as described (32Gladwin M.T. Wang X. Reiter C.D. Yang B.K. Vivas E.X. Bonaventura C. Schechter A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27818-27828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). S-nitrosated albumin (SNOAlb) was prepared by incubation of CSNO with human serum albumin at room temperature and S-nitroso-hemoglobin (SNOHb) by incubation of CSNO with oxyhemoglobin at 4 °C as described previously (32Gladwin M.T. Wang X. Reiter C.D. Yang B.K. Vivas E.X. Bonaventura C. Schechter A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27818-27828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Stocks of acidified sulfanilamide were prepared by dissolving 500 mg sulfanilamide in 10 ml of 1 n HCl. This solution was added to the various RSNO preparations in a 1:10 volume ratio (resulting in 0.5% sulfanilamide and 0.1 n HCl) and allowed to react for 3 min, or with 5 mm mercuric chloride (HgCl2) for 2 min, followed by acidified sulfanilamide for 3 min. The stability and molar yield of RSNOs was determined using tri-iodide-based gas phase chemiluminescence. In separate experiments, S-NO bond stability was assessed by monitoring absorbance changes between 330 and 338 nm before and after treatment of RSNOs with acidified sulfanilamide using a uv/vis spectrophotometer. In additional experiments, the amounts of NO generated from the RSNO preparations in the tri-iodide assay were compared with those obtained with the same solutions measured directly (i.e. not treated with sulfanilamide) using the CuCl/cysteine assay (33Doctor A. Platt R. Sheram M.L. Eischeid A. McMahon T. Maxey T. Doherty J. Axelrod M. Kline J. Gurka M. Gow A. Gaston B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5709-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Cuprous chloride (CuCl) was freshly dissolved in HPLC-grade water, the pH adjusted to 6.5 and cysteine added to a final concentration of 1 mm. 9 ml of this solution was added to the purge vessel and the solution changed after each sample injection. In some experiments, a larger purge vessel was used to avoid foaming and 15 ml of CuCl/cysteine was included. The solution was continuously bubbled with helium, and the purge gas was sequentially passed through the reaction vessel, a gas trap containing 15 ml of 1 m NaOH, and then swept into the chemiluminescence analyzer. This assay is specific for RSNO detection in aqueous buffer systems, does not require removal of nitrite before measurement and was therefore used to validate that the signal detected using the tri-iodide assay represents all of the S-NO detectable with no loss during the pretreatment step. Because any NO released from SNOHb will be bound by the ferrous heme group in the CuCl/cysteine assay, these samples were first pretreated with an excess molar ratio of cyanide and ferricyanide, then passed over a Sephadex G25 column washed extensively with HPLC grade water. This pretreatment step converts the heme to cyanomethemoglobin, which neither reacts with NO nor is reduced in the copper/cysteine solution. Doctor et al. (33Doctor A. Platt R. Sheram M.L. Eischeid A. McMahon T. Maxey T. Doherty J. Axelrod M. Kline J. Gurka M. Gow A. Gaston B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Comparison between Standard and Modified Tri-iodide Assay—Nitrite solutions were injected into a purge vessel containing 9 ml of either tri-iodide (23Feelisch M. Rassaf T. Mnaimneh S. Singh N.

(30Rogers S.C. Khalatbari A. Gapper P.W. Frenneaux M.P. James P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26720-26728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), except that we used 9 ml instead of 5 ml of the solution). Solutions were changed after each injection. Peak areas were computed for each method and compared. To test whether the tri-idodide method is associated with reported heme auto-capture by Rogers et al. we added a final concentration of 20 μm hemoglobin (based on heme) to the vessel containing tri-iodide solution prior to each injection of nitrite; we used this concentration of hemoglobin because this is the final concentration we achieve during our standard protocols for SNOHb detection (23Feelisch M.

Nitrite was dissolved and diluted in HPLC grade water and injected in amounts of 5–500 pmols without pretreatment. Determination of S-Nitrosated Hemoglobin Concentration in Human RBCs—SNOHb levels in freshly obtained human blood were compared using the standard tri-idodide method and the modified tri-iodide method described by Rogers et al. (30Rogers S.C. Khalatbari A. Gapper P.W. Frenneaux M.P. James P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26720-26728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) as follows: Blood was collected with heparin, spun down immediately at 750 × g for 5 min, and plasma and buffy coat were removed. RBCs were lysed 1:10 in 0.1 mm EDTA. After red cell lysis, samples were either directly injected into the ferricyanide/tri-iodide solution or treated, with and without HgCl2 (5 mm), and passed over a Sephadex G-25 column. Total NO yield was adjusted for sample heme content measured using the method of Drabkin (34Drabkin D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 3: 609-613Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For artery and venous SNOHb determination using the modified tri-iodide method, angiocatheters were placed in the brachial artery and antecubital vein, samples drawn into anaerobic vacutainers and immediately processed using the protocols described above. Does NO Autocapture by Heme Reduce Measured NO Levels in Red Cells Using the Tri-iodide Assay?—Rogers et al. (30Rogers S.C. Khalatbari A. Gapper P.W. Frenneaux M.P. James P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26720-26728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) suggest in their report that the decreased amplitude of the signals produced by the traditional tri-iodide assay diminishes its ability to detect NO from RBCs. However, their own results show that the AUC for NO release (i.e. the total quantity of NO released) did not change even for concentrations as high as 660 μm heme in the reaction vessel (Fig. 5A of Rogers et al., Ref. 30Rogers S.C.

Because we lyse red cells 1:10 or 1:4 and then pass the lysate over a Sephadex G-25 column, our final heme concentration (considering an injection volume of 300 μl and 9 ml of triidodide solution) never exceeds 20–50 μm. Under these conditions, we observe robust peaks with injections into tri-iodide. Fig. 1, A and B depict injections of 6.25 μm and 250 nm nitrite into tri-iodide with and without 20 μm heme. As described in one of our original articles (23Feelisch M. Rassaf T. Mnaimneh S. Singh N. Bryan N.S. Jourd'Heuil D. Kelm M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), there is some peak broadening with heme present, but the AUC values are identical and signal to noise robust. As shown in Fig. 1C, we observe recoveries that are essentially identical across all levels of added nitrite and SNOHb standards, with or without heme, using standard triiodide assay conditions (y = 0.996×; R2 = 1.0; p < 0.0001).FIGURE 1Comparison of NO signals from nitrite in the presence and absence of hemoglobin.

Nitric Oxide. 2004; 10: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because nitrite is readily reduced to NO in both the “classical” tri-iodide assay and Rogers' combined tri-iodide/ferricyanide method, it is absolutely critical to remove even traces of it before analysis of nitroso and/or nitrosyl content of a biological sample to avoid otherwise inevitable overestimation. Although nitrite concentrations in RBCs were long thought to be negligible because of rapid oxidation to nitrate, our groups have independently found that erythrocytes contain high nanomolar concentrations of nitrite (200–500 nm) (11Bryan N.S.

One interesting aspect of the work by Rogers et al. (30Rogers S.C. Khalatbari A. Gapper P.W. Frenneaux M.P. James P.E. J. Biol.

The method adopted by the investigators entails removal of nitrite by gel chromatography, specifically by passing the sample over a Sephadex G-25 column. With column separation, traces of nitrite may remain bound to either the heme or cationic motifs of the protein, and the time required for column chromatography may represent a problem for later quantification of some of the less stable nitroso/nitrosyl species. To illustrate this problem experimentally, human RBC lysate was spiked with 1 μm nitrite and subsequently subjected to gel chromatography using commercially available Sephadex G-25 columns (equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline), and fractions were collected every 18 s over a total of 8 min of elution with phosphate-buffered saline. Each fraction consisted of 10 drops, equaling ∼600 μl. An aqueous nitrite standard without protein served as a control. Our results show that nitrite appears to be well separated fro"

Mutations in the FGFR gene family have been linked to a series of syndromes (the craniosynostosis syndromes) whose primary phenotype involves aberrant development of the craniofacial skeleton. Craniosynostosis syndrome-linked FGFR mutations have been shown to be gain of function in terms of receptor activation and have been presumed to result in increased levels of FGF/FGFR signaling. Unfortunately, studies attempting to link expression of mutant FGFRs with changes in cellular phenotype have yielded conflicting results. In an effort to better understand the biochemical consequences of these mutations on receptor function, here we have investigated the effect of the FGFR2C278F mutation of Crouzon craniosynostosis syndrome on receptor trafficking, ubiquitination, degradation, and signaling. We find that FGFR2C278F exhibits diminished glycosylation, increased degradation, and limited cellular sublocalization in the osteoblastic cell line, MC3T3E1(C4). Additionally, we show that trafficking and autoactivation of wild type FGFR2 is glycosylation-dependent. Both FGFR2C278F and unglycosylated wild type FGFR2 signal through phospholipase Cγ in a ligand-independent manner as well as exhibit dramatically increased binding to the adaptor protein, Frs2. These findings suggest that autoactive FGFR2 can signal from intracellular compartments. Based upon our results, we propose that the functional signaling of craniosynostosis mutant, autoactive receptors is limited in some cell types by protective cellular responses, such as increased trafficking to lysosomes and proteasomes for degradation.

Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) 2The abbreviations used are: FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PLCγ, phospholipase Cγ; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. comprise a family of evolutionarily conserved transmembrane proteins known to be critical for the normal development of multiple organ systems/tissue types, including the craniofacial skeleton. FGFRs are receptor tyrosine kinases and elicit signaling via ligand binding, receptor dimerization, autophosphorylation, and subsequent recruitment and activation of docking and adaptor proteins at the plasma membrane. Upon ligand binding, FGFR1 and FGFR2 directly activate PLCγ1 and indirectly activate MAPK (1Mohammadi M. Dikic I. Sorokin A. Burgess W. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). MAPK activation is achieved through recruitment and activation of the docking protein Frs2, followed by binding and activation of adaptor proteins Grb2, Shp2,and Sos1(2Ridyard M. Robbins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13803-13809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Frs2-mediated signaling also stimulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity through the adaptor proteins Grb2 and Gab1 (3Ong S. Hadari Y. Gotoh N. Guy G. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6074-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Additionally, FGFR1 and FGFR2 are down-regulated upon ligand binding by the Frs2-mediated recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Cbl (4Wong A. Lamother B. Lee A. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6684-6689Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 5Lax I. Wong A. Lamothe B. Lee A. Frost A. Hawes J. Schlessinger J. Mol.

Mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptors have been linked to a series of human malformation disorders known as the craniosynostosis syndromes. These clinical syndromes typically involve the premature fusion of specific cranial sutures with a resultant characteristic skull shape, midface deficiency, hypertelorism, and proptosis. Clinical diagnosis of a given syndrome is also often based upon the existence (or lack thereof) of associated limb abnormalities, such as syndactyly. It is possible to imagine FGF/FGFR signaling controlling cranial suture development and fusion via several distinct mechanisms. FGF/FGFR signaling could control preosteoblast/osteoblast recruitment, differentiation, proliferation, or apoptosis. Unfortunately, studies that have attempted to link expression of craniosynostosis mutant FGFRs with these types of changes in cellular phenotype have revealed conflicting and inconsistent results (6DePollack C.

It is a commonly held belief that the craniosynostosis-associated FGFR mutations act as gain of function mutations in terms of FGF/FGFR signaling. More specifically, Apert syndrome-associated mutations in FGFR2 have been shown to result in alternative ligand binding and increased ligand binding affinity (14Yu K. Herr A. Waksman G. Ornitz D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14536-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 15Anderson J. Burns H. Enriquez-Harris P. Wilkie A. Heath J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), whereas Crouzon syndrome-linked mutations in FGFR2 have been shown to result in ligand-independent autophosphorylation, dimerization, and tyrosine kinase activity (16Neilson K. Friesel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26037-26040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 17Neilson K. Friesel R. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 4567-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Whereas it is tempting to assume from these findings that the craniosynostosis-linked FGFR2 mutations result in increased FGF/FGFR signaling, it is worthy to note that studies on the endocytosis, degradation, and recycling of a homologous tyrosine kinase receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), have shown that enhanced ligand binding actually results in diminished receptor-induced signaling (20Herbst J. Opresko L. Walsh B. Lauffenburger D. Wiley S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12865-12873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lenferink A. Inkas-Kramarski R. van de Poll M. van Vugt M. Klapper L. Tzahar E. Waterman H. Sela M. van Zoelen E. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3385-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). EGFR can be activated by a large number of ligands, each with varying degrees of receptor affinity and receptor-induced signaling. Attempts to elucidate the mechanism by which these ligands induce differential responses through the same receptor have led to the conclusion that higher affinity ligands actually result in lower levels of EGFR-induced signaling. Stimulation of cells with EGF, a high affinity EGFR ligand, has been shown to elicit increased levels of receptor ubiquitination and degradation, with diminished recycling to the plasma membrane, when compared with stimulation with the lower affinity ligands E4T or transforming growth factor-α (22Waterman H. Sabanai I. Geiger B. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13819-13827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 23Husam A. van Zoelen E. van Leeuwen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35781-35790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Strikingly, attempts to elicit MAPK signaling in cells transfected with Apert-associated FGFR2S252W or Crouzon-associated FGFR2C342Y showed significantly diminished phosphorylation of MAPK upon ligand stimulation in these cells (13Mansukhani A. Bellosta P. Sahni M. Basilico C. J. Cell. Biol. 2000; 149: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest the possibility that the craniosynostosis-linked mutations in FGFRs may not result in increased FGF/FGFR signaling in the conventional sense. FGFRs are N-glycosylated and can be expressed as unglycosylated, partially glycosylated, or fully glycosylated receptor forms (24Feige J. Baird A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14023-14029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein glycosylation sites are commonly found at sites of change in the secondary structure of a protein and have been suggested to stabilize the overall structure of a protein (25Petrescu A. Milac A. Petrescu S. Dwek R. Wormald M. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Glycosylation is also well known for its role in protein folding and quality control in the ER via the ER-resident lectins, calnexin and calreticulin (26Parodi A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). More recent data suggest a role for glycosylation in controlling protein subcellular localization and trafficking. It has been suggested that N-glycosylation of EGFR and other cytokine receptors regulates cell surface expression via protection from excessive endocytosis (27Partridge E. LeRoy C. Di Guglielmo G. Pawling J. Cheung P. Granovsky M. Nabi I. Wrana J. Dennis J. Science. 2004; 306: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Additionally, glycosylation of the human nerve growth receptor, TrkA, as well as of the serotonin type 3 receptor has been shown to be critical for plasma membrane targeting and expression (28Watson F. Porcionatto M. Bhattacharyya A. Stiles C. Segal R. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 39: 323-336Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 29Quirk P. Rao S. Roth B. Siegel R. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 77: 498-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Biotinylation of cell surface expression of FGFR1 in the non-FGFR-expressing cell line, BaF3, shows predominant expression of the fully glycosylated form on the cell surface (30Zhang Z. Cooman C. David G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41921-41929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This suggests the possibility that glycosylation of FGFRs is critical for cell surface trafficking of this receptor. It has been noted that Crouzon mutant FGFR2 is both reduced in its ability to bind ligand and is preferentially expressed as the lower molecular weight, partially glycosylated form of the receptor, suggesting that this mutant form of the receptor does not reach the cell surface (31Mangasarian K. Li Y. Mansukhani A. Basilico C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 172: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In order to better elucidate the biochemical consequences of craniosynostosis syndrome-linked FGFR2 mutations, we have confirmed that a Crouzon syndrome-associated C278F mutation of FGFR2 results in diminished glycosylation, increased receptor autophosphorylation, and dimerization. Receptor expression studies reveal the mutation to increase receptor degradation and to direct receptor trafficking from the ER/Golgi to the proteasome, as opposed to the cell surface in the osteoblastic cell line, MC3T3E1(C4). Further, we show that trafficking of wild type FGFR2 is dependent upon glycosylation and that unglycosylated wild type FGFR2 exists as an autoactive form in terms of ligand-independent dimerization. Finally, we show that both FGFR2C278F and unglycosylated wild type FGFR2 exhibit dramatically increased binding to PLCγ and Frs2, suggesting that these autoactive forms of the receptor are able to elicit signaling from internal compartments.

Cell Culture—COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. MC3T3E1(C4) murine osteoprogenitor cells were cultured in custom formulated, nonascorbate α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. MC3T3E1(C4) cells were cultured in nonascorbate media to prevent osteoblast differentiation (32Sudo H. Kodama H. Amagai Y. Yamamoto S. Kasai S. J. Cell. Biol. 1983; 96: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar, 33Wang D. Christensen K. Chawla K. Xiao G. Krebsbach P. Franceschi R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Establishment of FGFR2-expressing Cells—Stable cell lines were established by transfection of 85% confluent COS7 cells in 10-cm2 plates with 5 μg of plasmid and Superfect reagent, following the manufacturer's protocol. Transfectants were selected by growth in media containing 500 μg/ml G418. Unless otherwise indicated, transient transfections were performed utilizing similar methods. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblots—Preparation of cell lysate was achieved by solubilization in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% nadeoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS) containing 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), followed by removal of insoluble material by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. Prior to loading, 5× Laemmli loading buffer was added to a final 1× concentration, samples were boiled for 3 min and then iced. For immunoprecipitations, all experiments were done on ice or at 4 °C. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of RIPA containing 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and precleared with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose rotating for 1 h. The indicated antibody was added to precleared lysate, and samples were rotated for an additional 1 h. 50 μg of protein A-Sepharose was added to each tube, and samples were left rotating overnight. Immune complexes were washed four times with RIPA buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were released from beads by boiling for 3 min in 25 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon (Millipore Corp.). Immunoreactive protein bands were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Biotinylation—Transfected cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0, five times on ice. Cells were incubated with sulfosuccinimidobiotin on ice for 30 min. Cells were washed five times in 100 mm glycine/phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0, and lysed in 1 ml of RIPA buffer containing 1× protease inhibitor mixture. After the removal of insoluble protein by centrifugation, agarose-streptavidin was added, and biotin-streptavidin complexes were allowed to form for 1 h, followed by four washes in RIPA buffer and precipitation. Immunofluorescence—MC3T3E1(C4) cells were plated on poly-d-lysine (Sigma)-coated coverslips and cultured overnight in α-minimal essential media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. 36 h post-transfection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.25% Triton. The cells were then blocked in phosphate-buffered saline plus 10% bovine serum albumin and incubated in phosphate-buffered saline plus 3% bovine serum albumin and the indicated primary antibodies, followed by incubation with fluorescent conjugated secondary antibodies. Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Cells were visualized and photographed on a Zeiss Axioscop2 fluorescent microscope. MTT Assays—COS7 stable transfectants were plated in 96-well plates and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After the indicated growth periods and treatments, medium was replaced with 1 μg/ml MTT in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 3 h. MTT solution was removed, and cells were incubated overnight in lysis buffer at 37 °C. Reduction of MTT was measured by spectrophotometric readings at A570. Microphysiometry—COS7 stable transfectants were plated at 100,000 cells/well in 60-mm2 transwell plates (Costar) and grown for 5 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Monolayer cultures were transferred to a Cytosensor microphysiometer (Molecular Devices) for measurements of cellular acid production. Basal level cellular acid production was measured with cells bathed in 1 mm phosphate-buffered saline. Cellular acid production was also measured upon challenging cells with 5 mm sodium azide (blocks aerobic respiration) and 5 mm oxamate (blocks anaerobic respiration). Crouzon Syndrome-associated Mutation Diminishes Glycosylation and Increases Degradation of FGFR2—The C278F mutation of FGFR2 is commonly associated with craniosynostosis of Crouzon syndrome. Because craniosynostosis is thought to reflect effects of FGFR2C278F on osteoblast function, we employed the murine osteoblastic cell line, MC3T3E1(C4). Initial attempts to express FGFR2C278F in MC3T3E1(C4) cells led to extremely low levels of protein expression. Multiple subclones of stably transfected cells showed significant mRNA levels but minimal protein expression of the receptor (data not shown). In order to determine if this was the result of diminished biosynthesis versus increased degradation of FGFR2C278F, MC3T3E1(C4) cells were transiently transfected with equivalent amounts of V5-tagged wild type and C278F mutant FGFR2 constructs and cultured in the presence of protease inhibitors. V5 tag immunoblots revealed apparent differences in both glycosylation and degradation of the wild type and C278F mutant receptors (Fig. 1). Wild type FGFR2 was expressed predominantly as the fully glycosylated, 120-kDa form of the receptor, whereas FGFR2C278F was expressed predominantly as a partially glycosylated, 110-kDa form of the receptor. Proteasome inhibition by treatment with either MG132 or lactacystin increased protein expression of FGFR2C278F to levels similar to those of wild type receptor. Of note, both proteasome inhibitors stabilized predominantly the 110-kDa form of FGFR2C278F. Inhibition of lysosome acidification by bafilomycin appears to predominantly stabilize the 120-kDa form of FGFR2C278F. Crouzon Syndrome-associated Mutation Diminishes Glycosylation and Increases Receptor Autophosphorylation—We chose to study the C278F mutation of FGFR2, because it is the most common mutation associated with Crouzon syndrome (itself the most common of the craniosynostosis syndromes). The C278F mutation is analogous to a C342R mutation of FGFR2 that has been previously shown to result in diminished receptor glycosylation and increased receptor autoactivation (31Mangasarian K. Li Y. Mansukhani A. Basilico C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 172: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In order to confirm that the 110-kDa form of FGFR2C278F is the result of diminished receptor glycosylation, cell lysate of cells transiently transfected with FGFR2C278F was digested with the enzyme, endoglycosidase H, that is specific for the high mannose N-linked oligosaccharides characteristic of proteins that have not completed Golgi-mediated maturation of glycosylation. V5 tag immunoblots confirmed that both the 120- and 110-kDa receptor forms result from N-glycosylation (Fig. 2A). Endoglycosidase digestion of cell lysate from cells transfected with FGFR2C278F shows a shift in molecular mass from a primarily 110-kDa band to a primarily 85-kDa band. This 85-kDa band represents the unglycosylated receptor form, as confirmed by tunicamycin treatment of whole cell lysate from cells transfected with FGFR2. FGFR2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that exhibits increased tyrosine phosphorylation upon receptor activation. In order to confirm that the C278F mutation of FGFR2 increases receptor autoactivation, we tested for basal levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR2C278F, as compared with wild type FGFR2. Phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of V5 tag immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with FGFR2 or FGFR2C278F clearly indicated that FGFR2C278F exhibits increased basal levels of tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). FGFR2C278F Is Not Expressed on the Cell Surface in MC3T3E1(C4) Cells—Immunofluorescent detection of wild type and C278F mutant receptor in transiently transfected MC3T3E1(C4) cells revealed a restricted subcellular expression pattern for FGFR2C278F as compared with wild type receptor (Fig. 3A). Wild type FGFR2 was expressed throughout the cell and revealed a clear cellular outline, suggestive of cell surface localization. FGFR2C278F, on the other hand, was expressed in a limited, perinuclear pattern that is suggestive of localization in the ER and/or Golgi compartments. Cells expressing FGFR2C278F did not show a clear cellular outline, suggesting that this receptor variant was not expressed on the cell surface. To examine this possibility biochemically, cell surface proteins of transiently transfected MC3T3E1(C4) cells were covalently modified with a cell-impermeant biotin derivative. Biotinylated proteins were precipitated with streptavidin-coated beads and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, revealing that wild type FGFR2 was present at the cell surface, whereas FGFR2C278F was not (Fig. 3B). Probing the immunoblot for the cytoplasmic protein, pyruvate kinase, confirmed that the whole cell lysate but not the streptavidin precipitate contained cytoplasmic proteins. Probing the blot for streptavidin confirmed that equivalent amounts of biotinylated membrane proteins were loaded on the gel for wild type and C278F mutant FGFR2. FGFR2C278F Co-localizes with Golgi and ER Markers in MC3T3E1(C4) Cells—In order to identify the intracellular sites of expression of wild type and mutant FGFR2, immunohistochemical analysis was performed using antibodies against the ER marker, calreticulin, and the trans-Golgi marker, GM130. Immunostained MC3T3E1(C4) cells transfected with wild type receptor showed that, whereas a portion of this receptor form did co-localize with the ER marker, calreticulin, there was extensive expression outside of this compartment (Fig. 4A). In contrast, immunohistochemical localization of FGFR2C278F showed more extensive overlap with calreticulin (Fig. 4B). Immunohistochemical localization of FGFR2 in cells transfected with either wild type FGFR2 or FGFR2C278F showed some co-localization with the trans-Golgi marker, GM130 (Fig. 4, C and D). Both of these receptor variants also exhibit expression patterns outside of the trans-Golgi compartment. Subcellular Trafficking of Wild Type FGFR2 Is N-Glycosylation-dependent—The rapid degradation of FGFR2C278F in MC3T3E1(C4) cells hindered further biochemical analysis of the behavior and function of this receptor variant. Consequently, subsequent experiments were performed in COS7 cells in which FGFR2C278F is somewhat more stable. Of note, whereas FGFR2C278F was predominantly expressed as the 110-kDa, partially glycosylated form of FGFR2 in COS7 cells, biotinylation experiments suggest that some of this glycosylation form does reach the cell surface in this cell line (data not shown). The association of incomplete glycosylation with altered trafficking of FGFR2C278F led us to question the role that glycosylation plays in the trafficking of the wild type receptor. In order to test the idea that glycosylation is critical for cell surface trafficking of FGFR2, we used an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, tunicamycin, to compare cell surface expression of normally glycosylated FGFR2 and FGFR2 lacking N-glycosylation in COS7 cells. Treated cells expressed only the 85-kDa form of the receptor. Biotinylation of cell surface proteins indicated that this 85-kDa form does not reach the cell surface (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that N-glycosylation of FGFR2 is critical for normal trafficking of the receptor. FGFR2 has multiple potential N-glycosylation sites. We wished to know whether N-glycosylation of any particular site was required for normal trafficking of the receptor. Further, we wished to eliminate the possibility that altered trafficking of FGFR2 in the presence of tumicamycin resulted indirectly from a nonspecific effect on ER function. For these reasons, we mutated several potential glycosylation sites in FGFR2. SDS-PAGE analysis of cell lysates from MC3T3E1(C4)"

By virtue of its reported interaction with collagen I and deadhesive activity on cells, we hypothesized that hevin, a member of the SPARC gene family, regulates dermal extracellular matrix and collagen fibril formation. We present evidence for an altered collagen matrix and levels of the proteoglycan decorin in the normal dermis and dermal wound bed of hevin-null mice. The dermal elastic modulus was also enhanced in hevin-null animals. The levels of decorin protein secreted by hevin-null dermal fibroblasts were increased by exogenous hevin in vitro, data indicating that hevin might regulate both decorin and collagen fibrillogenesis. We also report a decorin-independent function for hevin in collagen fibrillogenesis. In vitro fibrillogenesis assays indicated that hevin enhanced fibril formation kinetics. Furthermore, cell adhesion assays indicated that cells adhered differently to collagen fibrils formed in the presence of hevin. Our observations support the capacity of hevin to modulate the structure of dermal extracellular matrix, specifically by its regulation of decorin levels and collagen fibril assembly.

The structure of the extracellular matrix (ECM) 3The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; DPBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; IHC, immunohistochemistry; EM, electron microscopy; WT, wild-type; BSA, bovine serum albumin; SC, synaptic cleft.3The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; DPBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; IHC, immunohistochemistry; EM, electron microscopy; WT, wild-type; BSA, bovine serum albumin; SC, synaptic cleft. is an important determinant of cellular behavior, and, in turn, is regulated by signals from adjacent cells. Proteins termed “matricellular” represent a class of proteins that regulate both ECM synthesis by cells and cell-ECM communication. Matricellular proteins are non-structural, secreted glycoproteins thought to function in an adaptive fashion by virtue of their interactions with cell-surface receptors, ECM, growth factors, and/or proteases.Hevin (also known as SC1 and SPARC-like 1) is a protein belonging to the SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) family of matricellular proteins. Proteins in the SPARC family are modular and share homologous C-terminal domains, including an extracellular Ca2+-binding domain and a follistatin-like domain. Murine hevin exhibits 53% identity with murine SPARC at the amino acid level, but has a unique, acidic N-terminal domain. Hevin was first identified as synaptic cleft (SC)-1 from a screen of a rat brain expression library for synaptic junctional glycoproteins of the central nervous system (1Johnston I.G. Paladino T. Gurd J.W. Brown I.R. Neuron. 1990; 4: 165-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It was subsequently cloned as “hevin” from a human high endothelial venule cDNA library (2Girard J.P. Springer T.A. Immunity. 1995; 2: 113-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Because the term “SC1” also has been assigned to an integral membrane adhesion protein structurally unrelated to hevin, we have chosen to use “hevin” (3Tanaka H. Matsui T. Agata A. Tomura M. Kubota I. McFarland K.C. Kohr B. Lee A. Phillips H.S. Shelton D.L. Neuron. 1991; 7: 535-545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).Members of the SPARC family, including SPARC itself, regulate ECM production and/or assembly (4Brekken R.A.

Wight T.N. Sage E.H. J. Invest. Derm. 2003; 120: 949-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). For example, SPARC-null mice have altered dermal collagen, including reduced overall collagen content and collagen I fibril diameters, but increased collagen VI at the expense of collagen I (5Bradshaw A.D. Puolakkainen P. Dasgupta J. Davidson J.M. Wight T.N. Sage E.H. J. Invest. Derm. 2003; 120: 949-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In concert, these changes act to reduce significantly the tensile strength of SPARC-null mouse skin (5Bradshaw A.D. Puolakkainen P. Dasgupta J. Davidson J.M. Wight T.N. Sage E.H. J. Invest. Derm. 2003; 120: 949-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Although hevin has been implicated in the regulation of ECM production due to its functional similarity to SPARC, its widespread expression in ECM, and its association with collagen I (6Hambrock H.O. Nitsche D.P. Hansen U. Bruckner P. Paulsson M. Maurer P. Hartmann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11351-11358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we expect hevin and SPARC to have distinct effects on ECM structure. Hevin is expressed differentially from SPARC during development and in the adult and is found predominantly in neural tissues, whereas SPARC is found in connective tissue and bone. Hevin and SPARC are also expressed non-coincidentally in the developing cochlea (7Mothe A.J. Brown I.R. Hearing Res. 2001; 155: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that hevin and SPARC have markedly different functions in the foreign body response (hevin deletion enhances inflammation, whereas SPARC deletion decreases fibrosis) (8Barker T.H. Framson P.E. Puolakkainen P. Reed M.J. Funk S.E. Sage E.H. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 166: 923-933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, we expect that hevin will regulate an aspect of ECM synthesis/structure different from that of SPARC.We hypothesized that hevin might influence ECM in one of several ways. The capacity of hevin to interact with collagen I (6Hambrock H.O. Nitsche D.P. Hansen U. Bruckner P. Paulsson M. Maurer P. Hartmann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11351-11358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and/or other ECM components might directly affect the stability or assembly of ECM. Alternatively, hevin might act by altering cell-ECM interactions, thus potentially affecting ECM synthesis or remodeling. Given the abundance of collagen I in the murine dermis, as well as the accessibility of dermal tissue regeneration models (e.g. dermal wound healing), we chose to investigate the role of the hevin in modulating normal and pathologic dermal ECM structure. A transgenic hevin-null mouse model was used to determine the effects of hevin deletion on the dermis. We found that collagen fibril structure was indeed altered by the deletion of hevin, indicative of a role for hevin in fibrillogenesis and/or fibril remodeling. The fiber morphology, however, was different from that previously described for SPARC-null dermis (5Bradshaw A.D. Puolakkainen P. Dasgupta J. Davidson J.M. Wight T.N. Sage E.H. J. Invest. Derm. 2003; 120: 949-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Hevin did not affect the total quantity of collagen deposited. Instead, deletion of hevin decreased the levels of decorin protein in murine dermis. Given that decorin and other proteoglycans are known to modulate fibril formation and packing density (10Graham H.K. Holmes D.F. Watson R.B. Kadler K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 891-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 11Reed C.C. Iozzo R.V. Glycoconj. J. 2003; 19: 249-255Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 12Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar), this result suggested that hevin was influencing collagen deposition/structure indirectly, at least in part, via decorin.We investigated the mechanism(s) underlying hevin function with dermal fibroblasts cultured from these mice and by in vitro fibrillogenesis assays. Hevin was found to stimulate the production of decorin protein by dermal fibroblasts in vitro, consistent with our findings in vivo. This effect did not appear to be dependent upon hevin-decorin binding. Hevin was also found to have a cell- and decorin-independent influence on collagen fibril formation in fibrillogenesis and cell adhesion assays. Taken together, our data indicate that hevin influences collagen structure by exercising classic matricellular functions: it regulates the accumulation of an ECM component, and it directly influences collagen fibril formation via interaction with collagen I.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—10% neutral buffered formalin solution and paraformaldehyde were purchased from Sigma. 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine was purchased from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA).

Rabbit IgG anti-mouse decorin polyclonal antisera LF113 was a gift from L. Fisher (Craniofacial and Skeletal Disease Branch, NIDCR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (14Fisher L.W. Stubbs 3rd, J.T. Young M.F. Acta Orthop. Scand. Suppl. 1995; 266: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). LF113 was directed against a species-variable sequence near the N terminus of murine decorin that is not shared by any other small leucine-rich proteoglycans. All secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Cell culture reagents, including Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), M199 medium, trypsin/EDTA, antibiotics, amphotericin B (fungizone), and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Invitrogen.Mice and Dermal Biopsies for Immunohistochemistry, Electron Microscopy, Tissue Extraction, Radioimmunoassay, Amino Acid Analysis, and Mechanical Testing—Hevin/SPARC-double-null mice of mixed background were obtained from L. Staiano-Coico (Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York) and P. McKinnon (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). Wild-type (WT) and hevin-null colonies were subsequently developed on a pure 129 SVE background via extensive backcrossing (8Barker T.H. Framson P.E. Puolakkainen P. Reed M.J. Funk S.E. Sage E.H. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 166: 923-933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The animals were viable and fertile and maintained in a specific pathogen-free facility.For collection of tissue sections, the dorsa of WT and hevinnull mice were shaved and rinsed with 70% ethanol. Shoulder skin sections for IHC and EM were dissected from animals and were fixed immediately (IHC: 10% formalin solution for 24 h followed by 70% ethanol; EM: Karnovsky's fixative (15Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1965; 272: 137aGoogle Scholar)). Samples for protein extraction, radioimmunoassay, and amino acid analysis were collected with a 5-mm punch biopsy and were frozen until use, whereas samples for mechanical tensile testing were collected with a dog bone-shaped (16Ridge M.D. Wright V. Biorheology. 1964; 2: 67-74Google Scholar) 2-cm long punch biopsy tool (oriented longitudinally along the animal) and were used immediately. IHC was performed according to standard protocols, with anti-hevin antibodies at 10 μg/ml and LF113 anti-decorin antisera at a dilution of 1:1000 where appropriate. Imaging was performed at ambient temperature on a Leica DMR microscope with a Leica PL FLUOTAR 40× objective, numerical aperture of 0.7 (Wetzlar, Germany). A SPOT RT Slider digital camera and the SPOT software package, version 3.02 (Sterling Heights, MI) were used for image acquisition. Photographs of decorin stains were overlaid with photographs of counterstains in Adobe Photoshop (San Jose, CA). For imaging of picrosirius red stain, samples were viewed and photographed under polarized light. All images were compiled into figures in Photoshop.EM sections were stained with lead citrate, uranyl acetate, and ruthenium red (17Evanko S.P. Angello J.C. Wight T.N. Arterio. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1004-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) prior to routine processing (15Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1965; 272: 137aGoogle Scholar). Fibrils identified in electron micrographs were statistically sampled by the method of Gundersen and Jensen (18Gundersen H.J. Jensen E.B. J. Micros. 1987; 147: 229-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar), and their diameters were measured with the Image J software package (Bethesda, MD). Imaging and image acquisition were performed at ambient temperature in air on a JEM-1200EX 11 (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) microscope. Images were subsequently scanned and compiled in Adobe Photoshop.Desmosine and hydroxyproline analyses on dermal biopsies were performed according to published protocols (19Starcher B. Conrad M. Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 31: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50-200 mg of tissue was hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl, evaporated to dryness, and resuspended in water. Desmosine content was determined by radioimmunoassay (20King G.S. Mohan V.S. Starcher B. Connect. Tissue Res. 1980; 7: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Hydroxyproline content was determined by amino acid analysis.For tensile analyses, 1.75 cm (width) × 2.5 cm (length) dog bone-shaped dorsal skin sections were biopsied in a longitudinal orientation (parallel to the animal's midline), one biopsy on each side of the animal. The sections were stressed longitudinally at a constant rate of strain (0.1 mm/s) with a mechanical tensile tester (21Sanders J.E. Garbini J.L. Leschen J.M. Allen M.S. Jorgensen J.E. IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 1997; 44: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and the stress-strain profiles were recorded. Force and displacement data were converted to stress and strain using the gauge length (1.0 cm) and width (1.0 cm) of the specimens. The tensile modulus was defined as the slope of the stress-strain curve in the linear region. Ultimate tensile strength was the maximal value of the stress obtained from the samples.Collagen in Dermal Wounds—Full-thickness excisional wounds were made on WT and hevin-null animals (22Puolakkainen P.A. Bradshaw A.D. Brekken R.A. Reed M.J. Kyriakides T. Funk S.E. Gooden M.D. Vernon R.B. Wight T.N. Bornstein P. Sage E.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2005; 53: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mice were anesthetized, shaved, and washed with topical antiseptic and wounded twice on opposing sides of their dorsa. For excisional wounding, a 5-mm diameter punch biopsy was used to remove skin sections. Healing was monitored over a time course of 2 weeks, or until wounds were fully closed. Collagen fibrils in the wound beds were evaluated by EM. For each condition, n = 4-10 wound beds were evaluated.Cell Culture and Cell Adhesion Assays—Dermal fibroblasts were isolated from the skin of WT and hevin-null adult 129 SVE mice according to published protocols (5Bradshaw A.D. Puolakkainen P. Dasgupta J. Davidson J.M. Wight T.N. Sage E.H. J. Invest. Derm. 2003; 120: 949-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS, 1% penicillin G/streptomycin sulfate, and 1 μg/ml fungizone in a humidified 37 °C incubator enriched with 5% CO2. Cells were passaged two to three times prior to use; they were maintained until approximately passage 7.Adhesion assays were performed a minimum of three times, each time in duplicate. 12-mm glass coverslips were incubated at 37 °C with a solution containing 2 μm rat-tail collagen I in 1× DPBS (containing Ca2+ and Mg2+), pH 7.6, and, where appropriate, 2 μm hevin, decorin, and/or ovalbumin. Following gelation, gel-coated coverslips were washed in DPBS and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in serum-free DMEM with or without 0.017 μg/μl chymotrypsin and 0.006 μg/μl elastase. Enzyme:substrate ratios were chosen to allow for complete digestion of gel-bound hevin, as analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining of soluble hevin following digestion. The digestion was stopped by addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride followed by extensive washing with DMEM containing 15% FBS. Coverslips were next incubated with 104 WT or hevin-null fibroblasts/coverslip in DMEM containing 1% FBS. 2 h after cell plating, coverslips were washed in DPBS, and the adherent cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde and stained according to standard fluorescent cytochemistry protocols with Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin and Hoechst dye. For immunofluorescent imaging of hevin on gel-coated coverslips, coverslips were treated as described, but were washed and fixed immediately following protease treatment and addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Gels were stained with antihevin antibodies at 10 μg/ml. Imaging was performed at ambient temperature on a Leica DMR microscope with a Leica PL FLUOTAR 100× objective, numerical aperture 1.3 (Wetzlar, Germany). A SPOT RT Slider digital camera and the SPOT software package, version 3.02 were used for image acquisition. Photographs of actin stains were overlaid with photographs of counterstains, and cell areas were measured in Adobe Photoshop (San Jose, CA).Western Blots and Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR for Detection of Decorin—Dermal skin sections were minced and extracted overnight at 4 °C in 8 m urea, and the total extracted protein was determined with the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit. The proteoglycan fractions from equal amounts of WT and hevin-null extracts were purified according to Kinsella et al. (23Kinsella M.G. Fischer J.W. Mason D.P. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13924-13932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, extracts were concentrated and partially purified on diethylaminoethyl-Sephacel™ columns. Proteoglycans were further purified by ethanol precipitation, and the glycosaminoglycan chains were removed by digestion with chondroitin ABC lyase. Digests were subsequently boiled for 10 min under reducing conditions and were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and Western blots were performed with LF113 anti-decorin antisera diluted 1:5000. For analysis of decorin protein levels in cultured cells, equal numbers of WT or hevin-null dermal fibroblasts were plated onto plastic culture dishes at ∼90% confluence and were allowed to adhere for ∼4 h in DMEM containing 15% FBS. Fibroblasts were washed and cultured for 1-24 h at near confluence in serum-free DMEM containing 250 nm hevin or bovine serum albumin (BSA) where indicated. This concentration was chosen because it induced detectable deadhesive activity by dermal fibroblasts when introduced into culture media (data not shown). Conditioned media and cell extracts for Western blotting were processed according to Kinsella et al. (23Kinsella M.G. Fischer J.W. Mason D.P. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13924-13932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Conditioned media were collected, and cell monolayers were scraped into 8 m urea solution. Both the media and extracts were subsequently concentrated, purified, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Experiments were performed a minimum of three times.For isolation of RNA, cells were treated with trypsin and were pelleted following hevin/BSA stimulation. Cell pellets were lysed, and mRNA was collected and purified by use of an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). First-stranded cDNA was generated from mRNA with the Qiagen Omniscript RT kit. Specific cDNA fragments were amplified by standard quantitative PCR protocols using the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system with a 96-well fast block and TaqMan gene expression assays Mm00514535_m1 (murine decorin) and Mm99999915_g1 (murine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). PCR data analysis was performed with the relative standard curve method and the SDS 2.2.1 software package from Applied Biosystems. Experiments were performed twice in triplicate.Collagen Fibrillogenesis Assays—In vitro fibrillogenesis assays were performed a minimum of three times in triplicate. 2 μm rat-tail collagen I solutions were formulated on ice at pH 7.6 in 1× DPBS (containing Ca2+ and Mg2+). 0.2-2 μm hevin, 0.2-2 μm ovalbumin, or 0.2-0.5 μm decorin was added where appropriate. These collagen and decorin concentrations were chosen to be comparable to those previously described (24Neame P.J. Kay C.J. McQuillan D.J. Beales M.P. Hassell J.R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 25Rada J.A. Cornuet P.K. Hassell J.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 56: 635-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 26Sini P. Denti A. Tira M.E. Balduini C. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); hevin:collagen molar ratios were chosen based on the range of SPARC concentrations known to influence collagen fibrillogenesis. 5R. Vernon, M. Gooden, and E. H. Sage, unpublished observations. Fibrillogenesis was initiated by warming the solutions to 37 °C in 96-well plates loaded into an OPTImax tunable microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Gelation was detected by monitoring turbidity at 400 nm in 30-s intervals, and the resulting data were exported to Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA) for analysis.The lag time, rate of fibrillogenesis, and absorbance plateau were calculated from raw data plots. Lag time was calculated as the amount of time elapsed before the absorbance at 400 nm reached 10% of its final plateau value. The rate of fibrillogenesis was defined as the slope of the linear region following the lag phase and was calculated by least-squares fit of a line to the points in this region for which the slope remained constant within 10% of its value. The absorbance plateau was defined as the average value of the absorbance at 400 nm between time = 45 min and time = 55 min, between which all samples had reached their maximal turbidity.Collagen Gel Contraction Assays—WT and hevin-null primary dermal fibroblasts were plated in 24-well plates at 100,000 cells/ml into 0.5 mg/ml rat-tail collagen I solutions buffered by M199 medium in the presence of 15% FBS. After gelation, gels were separated from the walls of the wells with a sterile needle and were allowed to contract for 5 h. Gels were fixed in 10% formalin solutions for 10 min, washed, and removed from 24-well plates, and their diameters and thicknesses were measured with calipers. Gel volumes were calculated from the thicknesses and diameters of the gels with the assumption that the gels were perfect cylinders. Experiments were performed three times, in triplicate.RESULTSGiven the widespread distribution of hevin in ECM, as well as the known effects of its family member SPARC on ECM structure (5Bradshaw A.D. Puolakkainen P. Dasgupta J. Davidson J.M. Wight T.N. Sage E.H. J. Invest. Derm. 2003; 120: 949-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that hevin deletion would lead to alterations in the dermal ECM. The expression and distribution of hevin and various ECM components were examined in sexmatched and age-matched adult (3-8 months) WT and hevinnull mice by IHC (Fig. 1). Hevin was present within the dermis and was also observed along the basement membrane of the dermal-epidermal junction and around hair follicles (Fig. 1A, arrows). Hevin did not appear to affect the integrity of the dermal elastic matrix, as revealed by Hart's stain (purple fibers, Fig. 1, B and D). In contrast, staining with Movat's pentachrome revealed distinct differences in overall dermal architecture between WT and hevin-null mice (Fig. 1, E-H). Hevin-null animals displayed an altered connective tissue staining pattern (red) that was coincident with patterns revealed by stains typically used for collagenous proteins (e.g. Fig. 2, A-H) and was suggestive of alterations in the distribution or structure of connective tissue protein. Furthermore, overall staining for proteoglycan (blue) was reduced in hevin-null animals, in comparison with WT. Specific detection of murine decorin (green, Fig. 1, I-L) was consistent with this observation, and illustrated that the steady-state distribution of decorin was altered in hevinnull compared with WT dermis. Quantitative analysis of WT and hevin-null dermal tissue extracts by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting revealed that decorin levels in hevin-null dermis were approximately half those in WT dermis (Fig. 1M).FIGURE 2Dermal collagen is altered in hevin-null mice. A-H,WT(A, B, E, and F) and hevin-null (C, D, G, and H) sections of skin were stained with Masson's trichrome (A-D) and picrosirius red (E-H). Scale bar (shown in A) = 100 μm. +/+,WT; -/-, hevin-null. I-N, dermal sections from WT (I, K, and M) and hevin-null (J, L, and N) animals were processed for EM (with uranyl acetate, lead citrate, and ruthenium red staining), and fibrils in the dermis were photographed in cross-section. I and J, dermis, adjacent to the dermal-epidermal junction. K and L, mid-dermis. M and N, deeper dermis. Scale bar (shown in I) = 100 nm. O, fibril diameters in the upper (adjacent to the dermal-epidermal junction) dermis (e.g. I and J) from photographs of WT (white bars) and hevin-null (black bars) animals were sampled and analyzed digitally. A minimum of three animals per genotype was examined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We investigated dermal collagen content in mature dermis by hydroxyproline analysis and mature dermal collagen structure by IHC (Fig. 2, A-H) and EM (Fig. 2, I-O). There was no significant quantitative difference in the overall collagen content of WT and hevin-null skin, with an average of 141 ± 28 nmol of hydroxyproline/mg of protein in WT skin and 128 ± 11 nmol of hydroxyproline/mg of protein in hevin-null skin. In contrast, there were a distinctly different distribution and a higher density of collagen I fibers in the hevin-null dermis in comparison with those of WT dermis (Fig. 2, A-D). EM revealed that these macroscopic changes were consistent with nanoscale differences in collagen fibril structure and arrangement, with thinner, more uniform, and more densely packed fibrils in hevin-null dermis (Fig. 2, I-O). In 5-month-old animals, average cross-sectional fibril diameters were 54.6 ± 12.7 nm in WT dermis versus 43.7 ± 11.1 nm in hevin-null dermis (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2O), and average packing densities (percent of cross-sectional area covered by fibrils) were 61 ± 5% versus 73 ± 4%, respectively (p < 0.05). Collagen fibril maturity was further examined with picrosirius red (Fig. 2, E-H), which stains thicker, more cross-linked fibrils red, and thinner, less cross-linked fibrils yellowgreen, when viewed under polarized light (27Dayan D.

Very recently it has been shown that one of the mammalian chitinases is highly overexpressed in the asthmatic lung and contributes to the pathogenic process through recruitment of inflammatory cells. Although several potent natural product chitinase inhibitors have been identified, their chemotherapeutic potential or their use as cell biological tools is limited due to their size, complex chemistry, and limited availability. We describe a virtual screening-based approach to identification of a novel, purine-based, chitinase inhibitor. This inhibitor acts in the low micromolar (Ki = 2.8 ± 0.2 μm) range in a competitive mode. Dissection of the binding mode by x-ray crystallography reveals that the compound, which consists of two linked caffeine moieties, binds in the active site through extensive and not previously observed stacking interactions with conserved, solvent exposed tryptophans. Such exposed aromatics are also present in the structures of many other carbohydrate processing enzymes. The compound exhibits favorable chemical properties and is likely to be useful as a general scaffold for development of pan-family 18 chitinase inhibitors.

Their poor synthetic accessibility and limited availability from natural sources has so far hampered the use of these inhibitors for in vivo studies, whereas their chemical complexity makes them unsuitable as starting points for ligand design efforts. Nevertheless, numerous crystallographic and biochemical studies have elucidated the interactions between these compounds and family 18 chitinases (e.g. Refs. 11Houston D.R. Eggleston I. Synstad B.

Recently, a high throughput screen identified three xanthine derivatives, theophylline, caffeine, and pentoxifylline, as competitive inhibitors of bacterial, fungal, and human family 18 chitinases (19Rao F.V. Andersen O.A. Vora K.A. DeMartino J.A. van Aalten D.M.F. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although their inhibition was not strong (high micromolar), analysis of their mode of inhibition revealed that these molecules mimic many of the chitinase-substrate hydrogen bonds and in addition display extensive π-π stacking interactions with a conserved tryptophan. Here, we describe a simple, fragment-based approach to virtual screening of commercially available chemical structures, starting from the caffeine scaffold. The virtual screen resulted in the identification of a new xanthine-based chitinase ligand that competitively inhibits several family 18 chitinases in the low micromolar range. LIGTOR: a Simple and Efficient Virtual Screening Algorithm— Several examples of successful fragment-based drug discovery have recently been reported (reviewed in Refs. 20Erlanson D.A. McDowell R.S. O'Brien T. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 3463-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar and 21Carr R.A.E. Congreve M. Murray C.W. Rees D.C. Drug Discov. Today. 2005; 10: 987-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The approach is to identify binding modes of very small, but highly efficient, chemical entities, which are then further elaborated or connected together through small linkers to yield dramatic increases in inhibition. Unfortunately, no freely available, noncommercial programs for such elaboration of fragments have so far been reported. Here we describe LIGTOR, a program for rapidly evaluating compounds starting from a two-dimensional library of chemical molecules and a structurally characterized starting fragment. As a first step, a virtual compound library was searched for molecules containing the fragment as a substructure; depending on the choice of fragment, this step will leave only a small number of compounds for consideration. Using the fragment structure as a template, chemically sensible three-dimensional coordinates are generated for the selected compounds, so that orientation and conformation of the fragment-equivalent substructure matches that of the template as closely as possible, even if the molecules differ in atom or bond types due to degeneracy in the search pattern. If a library compound contains more than one instance of the fragment substructure, several coordinate sets are produced. These initial binding modes are then optimized by evaluation of torsion angles (outside the fragment substructure) and, optionally, the overall position/orientation in the context of the protein receptor. Subsequently, compounds with poor predicted binding or excessive coordinate shifts of their fragment substructure are discarded. The docked complexes of the remaining compounds are inspected visually, promising candidates are chosen for in vitro testing and cocrystallization. The substructure search is carried out with SDFSCAN, a command-line tool for selecting compounds from a library by (sub-)structure; SDFSCAN accepts input either in SDFile format or in an enriched SDFSCAN-specific format that can be generated using PRODRG (22Schüttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M.F. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4358) Google Scholar). Template-based coordinate generation is also performed with PRODRG. Ligands are docked using LIGTOR, a PRODRG extension for evaluating and optimizing ligand poses against a receptor described by affinity grid maps. Currently, LIGTOR uses the AutoDock 3.0 force field (23Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comp. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9301) Google Scholar) with a modified ligand-internal energy term to accelerate computation. Another difference to AutoDock is that LIGTOR minimizes the predicted ΔG, not ΔH. LIGTOR obtains ligand descriptions including a list of optimizable torsion angles from PRODRG. Depending on the application, LIGTOR can also optimize the overall position/orientation of the ligand or, alternatively, keep a part of the ligand (in this case the fragment substructure) fixed. In the former case harmonic restraints may be applied to either the coordinates of a substructure or to the center of mass of parts/all of the ligand. Instructions for obtaining SDFSCAN, LIGTOR, and PRODRG are available upon request. Protein Purification and Enzyme Assays—Chitinase B1 from Aspergillus fumigatus (AfChiB1) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (19Rao F.V. Andersen O.A. Vora K.A.

Despite their relatively poor affinity (Ki = 37 μm for pentoxifylline), these compounds present interesting starting points for ligand design, as they displayed a common binding mode, not previously observed in family 18 chitinase inhibitors, involving extensive π-π stacking interactions with a fully conserved tryptophan and mimicry of chitinase-substrate hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1). Furthermore, these compounds show good ligand efficiency (expressed as ΔG per non-hydrogen atom (29Hopkins A.L. Groom C.R. Alex A. Drug Discov. Today. 2004; 9: 430-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar), Δg = -0.43 kcal mol-1 atom-1 for pentoxifylline) and are easy to synthesize or derivatize. The rigid xanthine moiety of the three compounds binds in a virtually identical orientation to the AfChiB1 active site (19Rao F.V. Andersen O.A. Vora K.A. DeMartino J.A. van Aalten D.M.F. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), making it an ideal starting point for further optimization. From a chemical point of view, further functionalization of the xanthine scaffold is mainly possible at four positions: at N-1, N-3, N-7, and C-8 (Fig. 2A). However, the binding mode of the xanthine suggests that of these, modification at N-7 and C-8 is restricted as these both point toward small cavities in the structure. In comparison, both N-1 and, to a lesser extent N-3, should be able to accept larger modifications (Fig. 1A). The oxohexyl group of pentoxifylline is an example for such a modification on N-1 (Fig. 1A) and its presence improves binding to AfChiB1 almost 4-fold (19Rao F.V. Andersen O.A. Vora K.A.

We searched a data base of 5.1 million commercially available compounds for molecules containing a 3-methylxanthine substructure, identifying 50,193 candidate ligands. We then evaluated all these ligands using the LIGTOR program developed as part of this study (see “Experimental Procedures”). The coordinates of the 3-methylxanthine substructure were kept fixed while performing a torsional evaluation of the substitutions, in the context of the protein component of the published AfChiB1-pentoxifylline complex (19Rao F.V. Andersen O.A. Vora K.A. DeMartino J.A. van Aalten D.M.F. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) as the receptor. After docking with PRODRG/LIGTOR, compounds were selected by predicted free enthalpy of binding (ΔG < -10.0 kcal mol-1), predicted ligand efficiency (Δg < -0.35 kcal mol-1 atom-1), and coordinate shift of the 3-methylxanthine substructure atoms (r.m.s. deviation between starting and docked conformations <0.6 Å). The predicted conformations of the 263 unique compounds fulfilling all three criteria were inspected visually and finally the 12 compounds listed in Table 1 were purchased for in vitro testing. The docked conformations for these compounds are shown together in Fig. 1B. Desirable Chemical Features Are Enriched in the Virtual Screening Hits—A question in assessing the validity of the virtual screening approach is to what extent the docking-based compound selection leads to an enrichment of the discussed features (small groups on N-7/C-8, larger groups on N-1/N-3), especially as the set of 50,193 xanthine derivatives that serve as the starting point show an unfavorable distribution of functionalizations: less than 9% of the compounds carry more than one non-hydrogen atom on N-1, whereas 90% and 88% of all compounds have undesirably large groups attached to N-7 and C-8, respectively (Fig. 2B). However, analysis of the group size distributions for the set of 263 compounds selected after docking shows, as expected, a clear preference for large modifications on N-1 (97% of the set carry two or more attached non-hydrogen atoms) and at slight preference for large modifications on N-3 (Fig. 2B). Similarly, the expected restrictions were on substitutions on N-7 (over 95% of the selected compounds are modified with a single non-hydrogen atom) and C-8 (a relative increase of unmodified compounds, although more than half of the selected molecules still carry a “heavy” modification). In conclusion, the set of functionalizations selected by the virtual screen are generally in agreement with the distribution expected based on experimental data and visual inspection of the active site. The Virtual Screen Identifies a Low Micromolar Inhibitor— Twelve compounds from the selected set were chosen for in vitro evaluation (Fig. 2). They were picked to approximately represent the chemical features found in the entire set. Most of them have functional groups attached at N-1 that may interact with Trp52, as observed in the pentoxifylline complex (Fig. 1A). One compound has a free N-7, the others present a methyl group at N-7. One compound each carries a large group on N-3 and C-8, otherwise these atoms are methylated or unmodified, respectively. The compounds are listed, with their predicted free enthalpy of binding and efficiency, in Table 1, as is pentoxifylline, which was also identified as a candidate ligand by the virtual screen. Of the 12 compounds, three were not delivered by the suppliers, for the remaining compounds IC50 values for the inhibition of AfChiB1 were determined. Only two of them, compounds 2 and 5 (Fig. 2A), showed significant inhibition. Compound 5 performs significantly worse than its parent compound caffeine and was not considered any further. Only compound 2 (1-(2-(theobromine-1-yl)ethyl)-theobromine, from here on referred to as C2-dicaffeine) showed a significantly increased affinity to AfChiB1. With an IC50 of 4.8 ± 1.4 μm it improves inhibition by 2 orders of magnitude compared with its parent compound (caffeine) and even when compared with pentoxifylline, so far the highest affinity purine-based chitinase inhibitor, it improves inhibition ≈25-fold. C2-dicaffeine Is a Competitive Inhibitor with an Extensive π-π Stacking Binding Mode—The inhibition of AfChiB1 by C2-dicaffeine was further investigated using kinetic measurements. Lineweaver-Burk analysis of steady-state kinetic experiments with varying substrate and inhibitor concentrations showed that C2-dicaffeine is a competitive inhibitor of the chitinase with a Ki of 2.8 ± 0.2 μm (Fig. 2C). This makes it more than 1 order of magnitude more potent than pentoxifylline (Ki = 37 ± 2 μm (19Rao F.V. Andersen O.A. Vora K.A. DeMartino J.A. van Aalten D.M.F. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar)). We next investigated the binding mode of C2-dicaffeine by solving a high resolution crystal structure of the AfChiB1-C2-dicaffeine complex (Table 2, Fig. 1C). The active site Asp175 is pointing down into the catalytic core similarly to the other xanthine derivative complexes (r.m.s. deviation = 0.244 Å for 185 atoms of 19 active site residues comparing to the pentoxifylline complex). Defined electron density for C2-dicaffeine shows the ligand bound to the protein in an overall orientation similar to that predicted by docking: the “primary” caffeine moiety is sandwiched between Trp137 and Trp384, whereas the “secondary” caffeine stacks with Trp52 (Fig. 1C). The crystal structure also reveals two major differences from the known xanthine binding mode and the docked conformation: first, C2-dicaffeine is shifted out of the active site by about 1.5 Å and second, both purine rings are flipped by 180° around their N-1 linker bond. This binding mode significantly improves π-π-stacking between the secondary caffeine and Trp52 compared with the docked orientation. Similar to the other xanthine inhibitors the primary caffeine moiety of C2-dicaffeine accepts two hydrogen bonds, one from the backbone amide of Trp137 and one from the hydroxyl of Tyr245. Due to the flip of the ring system the former H-bond is formed by O-2 instead of O-6, and the direct interaction between Tyr245 and N-9 is replaced with a water-mediated hydrogen bond involving the same groups (Fig. 1C). O-2 of the secondary caffeine occupies a position similar to that of the pentoxifylline side chain carbonyl oxygen and, like it, accepts a hydrogen bond from a water molecule that in turn is held in place through interactions with the 136-139 loop forming one wall of the active site (Fig. 1, A and C). The secondary O-6 also hydrogen bonds to a water that interacts with the indole NH of Trp52 and the guanidino group of Arg57. Further inspection of the ligand electron density revealed it to be most compatible with the C2-dicaffeine binding in a dual conformation. Refinement supported a major conformation with occupancy 0.75 and a minor conformation with occupancy 0.25. The two conformations are approximate mirror images of each other with the mirror plane being the average plane through all ligand atoms. This means that the two conformations occupy essentially the same space and form the same hydrogen bonds with the active site; the main differences between them are the tilt of the purine rings relative to their stacking partners and the torsion angles of the ethylene linker. The linker adopts a staggered conformation, i.e. the central torsion angle is ∼180°, whereas the torsion angles with the purine rings are ≈90° and -90° on either side. This linker conformation prevents the two caffeine rings from both achieving ideal stacking, the major ligand conformation has the primary caffeine significantly tilted against its tryptophan stacking partners (angle ≈19°), whereas the minor conformer has an unfavorable angle of over 23° between the Trp52 indole and its secondary caffeine. Together, the ligand shift/flip, the disorder and tilting of the aromatic systems, suggest that C2-dicaffeine is in a strained conformation in the observed complex, which is non-ideal for tight binding. C2-dicaffeine Inhibits Several Family 18 Chitinases—Comparing the sequence of AfChiB1 with that of other “bacterial-like” family 18 chitinases shows a high degree of conservation of the active site residues (Fig. 1C). With the exception of Thr138 and Tyr139, all residues directly interacting with the C2-dicaffeine ligand in the complex structure are conserved in >70% of known bacterial-like chitinases. In particular, the three tryptophan residues stacking with the aromatic systems of the ligand, Trp52, Trp137, and Trp384, are conserved in >80% of sequences, suggesting that C2-dicaffeine may be useful as a ligand for other bacterial-like family 18 chitinases. To investigate this possibility, three additional family 18 chitinases were assayed for inhibition by C2-dicaffeine: HCHT, the acidic mammalian chitinase activity from mouse lung samples (mAMCase) and the bacterial chitinase A from S. marcescens (SmChiA). The HCHT active site contains two amino acid substitutions compared with AfChiB1: Thr138 is replaced by an asparagine and Tyr139 is replaced by a phenylalanine. Despite the relatively conservative nature of these substitutions C2-dicaffeine inhibits HCHT with an IC50 of 107 ± 5 μm, which is 1.3 orders of magnitude weaker compared with its inhibition of AfChiB1. Thr138 and Tyr139 form one wall of the subsite binding the secondary caffeine, and whereas their side chains do not form hydrogen bonds with the ligand, they make extensive van der Waals interactions that are likely to contribute significantly to ligand binding and stabilization. Crystal structures of HCHT (17Rao F.V. Houston D.R. Boot R.G. Aerts J.M.F.G. Sakuda S. van Aalten D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20110-20116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 34Fusetti F. von Moeller H. Houston D. Rozeboom H.J. Dijkstra B.W. Boot R.G. Aerts J.M.F. van Aalten D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25537-25544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) show that the asparagine replacing Thr138 adopts a conformation similar to that of the threonine and thus is unlikely to significantly alter binding. On the other hand, the side chain of the phenylalanine replacing Tyr139 points away from the active site, into a pocket created by a glycine in place of AfChiB1 Asn78. This leaves the binding site for the secondary caffeine more open, explaining the reduced affinity of HCHT for C2-dicaffeine, especially considering that “monocaffeine” ligands like theophylline or pentoxifylline bind more tightly to HCHT compared with AfChiB1. Mouse (and human) acidic mammalian chitinase carry the same two substitutions as HCHT; additionally Arg301 is replaced by a histidine and a glutamine takes the place of Glu322. The IC50 for C2-dicaffeine against mouse lung acidic mammalian chitinase activity is 90 ± 4 μm, which is similar to the value obtained for HCHT, suggesting that neither the arginine to histidine substitution nor the replacement of Glu322, which does not directly interact with the dicaffeine ligand, significantly influence ligand binding. SmChiA differs from AfChiB1 in only one active site residue, Tyr139 is replaced by a leucine. Still, this substitution increases the IC50 for C2-dicaffeine against SmChiA to 71 ± 3 μm. Inspection of SmChiA crystal structures (e.g. PDB code 1CTN (35Perrakis A. Tews I. Dauter Z. Oppenheim A.B. Chet I. Wilson K.S. Vorgias C.E. Structure. 1994; 2: 1169-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar)) shows that the smaller leucine side chain could not reach a C2-dicaffeine ligand bound in the conformation observed for AfChiB. This again results in a loss of van der Waals interactions, thus explaining the reduced affinity of the dicaffeine for SmChiA compared with AfChiB1. Whereas the wide conservation of the three “essential” tryptophans among bacterial-like family 18 chitinases suggests that the dicaffeine molecule provides a useful general scaffold for the generation of inhibitors against this group of enzymes, comparisons of several family 18 members reveal that relatively subtle changes in active site construction can significantly affect affinity. This makes it likely that dicaffeine derivatives selective for only a small number or even individual family 18 targets can be designed. It should also be noted that the conservation of active site features among bacterial-like family 18 chitinases does not extend to their “plant-like” siblings: most AfChiB1 active site residues, including the three tryptophans, are conserved in less than 15% of plant-like family 18 chitinase sequences. This work presents an approach to performing rapid virtual screening experiments based on the known conformation of a ligand fragment in a target binding site, as well as the application of this method to elaborate a methylxanthine fragment common to several recently identified inhibitors of AfChiB1 (19Rao F.V. Andersen O.A. Vora K.A. DeMartino J.A. van Aalten D.M.F. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Whereas the method identifies both known and novel AfChiB1 inhibitors, a large number of predicted hits turn out to be false positives, which is unexpected, in particular as the assumptions made to speed up the virtual screening should, if anything, give rise to false negative results. To re-evaluate the results, the compounds in Table 1 were re-docked using AutoDock 3.0, which uses essentially the same force field as LIGTOR, but, while slower than LIGTOR, is better suited to ab initio docking and produces a list of favorable conformations instead of a single “best” conformation. Table 1 identifies the AutoDock cluster (re-ranked by ΔG) most similar to the LIGTOR-generated pose and the r.m.s. deviation between the two conformations. The results suggest that the large number of false positives is not due to a shortcoming of the employed docking protocol, but instead most likely stems from problems of the force field employed. At the same time the data indicate that the assumption that the fragment substructure binds to the active site in a fixed conformation may not hold in all cases, in particular for compounds with large extensions like 3, 4, or 6. In addition, the rapid evaluation with LIGTOR may not find the desired energy minimum in cases of highly flexible attachments, as seen in the case of compound 6, leading to an expected increase of false negatives. To improve the predictions from the virtual screen, the use of a separate scoring function is being investigated. Alternatively, a small number of candidate ligands could be evaluated using free-energy perturbation calculations (36Kollman P. Chem. Rev. 1993; 93: 2395-2417Crossref Scopus (1870) Google Scholar). LIGTOR together with PRODRG provides a simple affinity grid-based docking implementation. It can be used as a building block for a variety of docking protocols, including the fragment-based approach described here, but also for evaluating a series of synthesizable compounds, in ligand growing protocols or for fitting ligands to electron density maps. 5A. W. Schüttelkopf, unpublished data. It should also be noted that the grid-based docking as implemented by LIGTOR is relatively force field agnostic and more elaborate force fields could be adopted with little effort. The newly identified dicaffeine compound represents a promising starting point for the design of family 18 chitinase inhibitors. With a molecular mass of 386 Da, a cLogP of -0.77, six hydrogen bond acceptors, and no hydrogen bond donors, it conforms with Lipinski's rule of five (37Lipinski C.A. Lombardo F. Dominy B.W. Feeney P.J. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 1997; 23: 3-25Crossref Scopus (8528) Google Scholar). It also is reasonably rigid, possessing only three free torsions involving non-hydrogen atoms. C2-dicaffeine can be derivatized in numerous locations, both on the xanthine ring systems and on the linker, and many derivatives are easily synthetically accessible. Sequence comparisons and assays of additional enzymes suggest that the dicaffeine scaffold can form a basis for the design of specific inhibitors of bacterial-like, but not plant-like, family 18 chitinases. Family 18 chitinases comprise drug targets from fungal and protozoan pathogens, and also have been implicated as effectors in allergic asthma. Using a new docking program, LIGTOR, a purine fragment common to several previously characterized chitinase inhibitors is elaborated into a new inhibitor, C2-dicaffeine, which has low micromolar affinity for a model chitinase and desirable drug-like properties. The crystal structure of a C2-dicaffeine-chitinase complex shows the inhibitor interacting with two separate subsites in the active site cleft and suggests that its scaffold should be widely applicable to the development of specific inhibitors of family 18 chitinases."

Here we report that in prostate cancer cells, epidermal growth factor activates two antiapoptotic signaling pathways that impinge on the proapoptotic protein BAD. One signaling cascade operates via the Ras/MEK module and induces BAD phosphorylation on Ser112. Another pathway predominantly relies on Rac/PAK1 signaling that leads to BAD phosphorylation on Ser136. Each of these two pathways is sufficient to protect cells from apoptosis, and therefore both have to be inhibited simultaneously to block epidermal growth factor-dependent survival. Redundancy of antiapoptotic signaling pathways should be considered when therapies targeting antiapoptotic mechanisms are designed. Protection from apoptosis by receptor tyrosine kinases, resistant to the inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3 ′-kinase/Akt and Ras/MEK pathways, has been reported in several cell types, including fibroblasts and epithelial prostate cancer cells; however, mechanisms of this effect were not clear.

Each of these two pathways is sufficient to protect cells from apoptosis, and therefore both have to be inhibited simultaneously to block epidermal growth factor-dependent survival. Redundancy of antiapoptotic signaling pathways should be considered when therapies targeting antiapoptotic mechanisms are designed. Since apoptosis was identified as one of the mechanisms of cancer cell elimination (1Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12927) Google Scholar, 2Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6205) Google Scholar), substantial efforts were spent to understand regulation of this process at the molecular level. These efforts revealed that the decision to undergo apoptosis is determined by external or intrinsic pro- and antiapoptotic stimuli (3Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). It became evident that antiapoptotic mechanisms not only help resisting anti-cancer therapies but are also a prerequisite for oncogenic transformation itself. Thus, the ability to avoid apoptosis was recognized as an indispensable component of cancer cells (4Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22628) Google Scholar, 5Lowe S.W. Cepero E. Evan G. Nature. 2004; 432: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Prostate cancer provides an excellent illustration of the significance of antiapoptotic signaling for tumorigenesis. Prostate epithelial cells depend on androgen for their growth and survival and undergo apoptosis when androgen levels are decreased (6Kyprianou N. Isaacs J.T. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 552-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Androgen dependence of prostate cells forms the basis for the treatment of prostate cancer. Unfortunately, in many instances, androgen ablation therapy fails because prostate cancer cells engage antiapoptotic mechanisms that allow them to survive without androgen (7Feldman B.J. Feldman D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar, 8Tang D.G. Porter A.T. Prostate. 1997; 32: 284-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 9Uzgare A.R. Isaacs J.T. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). One of the first discovered and most extensively characterized anti-apoptotic pathways is the PI3K 2The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen activated protein kinase kinase; MSK1, mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1; CREB, cAMP-responsive element binding protein; PAK, p21-activated kinase; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten; 4HT, 4-OH tamoxifen; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein./Akt module (10Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar). The constitutive activation of the PI3K signaling pathway has been found in a variety of cancers, including advanced prostate cancer. This activation often occurs due to a loss of expression of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, which encodes a lipid phosphatase that negatively regulates signaling pathways downstream from PI3K (11Cairns P. Okami K. Halachmi S. Halachmi N. Esteller M. Herman J.G. Jen J. Isaacs W.B. Bova G.S. Sidransky D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4997-5000PubMed Google Scholar, 12McMenamin M.E. Soung P. Perera S. Kaplan I. Loda M. Sellers W.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4291-4296PubMed Google Scholar). Knock-out of the PTEN gene in the mouse prostate is sufficient to trigger development of metastatic prostate cancer (13Wang S. Gao J. Lei Q. Rozengurt N. Pritchard C. Jiao J. Thomas G.V. Li G. Roy-Burman P. Nelson P.S. Liu X. Wu H. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 209-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). These observations established the importance of PI3K signaling in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. In addition to PI3K, other antiapoptotic signaling pathways may become activated in prostate cancer cells (7Feldman B.J. Feldman D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar). The increased expression of EGFR and its ligands has been observed in prostate cancer samples for some time (14Lorenzo G.D. Bianco R. Tortora G. Ciardiello F. Clin. Prostate Cancer. 2003; 2: 50-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15McCarty M.F. Integr. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 349-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), but the role of the EGFR axis in apoptosis regulation in prostate cells only recently became appreciated. Thus, several investigators have reported that EGF can protect prostate cancer LNCaP cells from apoptosis induced by PI3K inhibitors; however, signal transduction pathways as well as targets of EGF-activated survival remained arcane (16Kulik G.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2891-2897PubMed Google Scholar). Previously EGF-induced suppression of apoptosis has been observed in several tissue culture cell lines, as well as in model organisms (18Baker N.E. Yu S.Y.

In each case, inhibition of individual survival signaling pathways downstream of EGFR would diminish the antiapoptotic effects of EGF (22Bergmann A. Agapite J. McCall K. Steller H.

Here we demonstrate that EGF activates two parallel antiapoptotic signaling pathways that impinge on BAD in androgen-dependent LNCaP and androgen-independent C4-2 prostate cancer cells. One signaling cascade operates via the Raf/MEK module and induces phosphorylation of Ser112. Another pathway predominantly relies on the Rac/PAK1 pathway and leads to phosphorylation of Ser136. Each of these two pathways is sufficient to protect from apoptosis, and therefore both signaling pathways must be inhibited to sensitize prostate cancer cells to proapoptotic treatments. Thus, redundancy of antiapoptotic signaling pathways activated by single survival agonist should be considered when therapies targeting antiapoptotic mechanisms are designed. Cell Line—The prostate cancer LNCaP and C4-2 cells were a gift from Leland Chung. C4-2LucBAD cells were obtained by transfecting C4-2 cells by pGL4 mixed with Tet_on and pTRE2hygBAD cDNA constructs. Cells were selected in G418 and hygromycin antibiotics. 60 clones were isolated and further screened for the luciferase activity and expression of BAD upon induction with doxycycline. In this manner several clones were isolated with expression of HA-BAD comparable with endogenous BAD levels upon induction with Doxocycline. Antibodies and Other Reagents—Antibodies were from the following sources: BAD, phospho-specific BAD (Ser112, Ser136, and Ser155), phospho-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204), phospho-Akt (Ser473), p90rsk, phospho-p90rsk (Thr360/Ser364), PTEN, and phospho-CREB (Ser133) were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); phospho-MEK1 (Ser298) antibodies were a gift from Andrew Catling; anti-FLAG M2 and anti-β-actin monoclonal antibodies were from Sigma; secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies used for Western blots were from Amersham Biosciences.

All cells were kept in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transient transfection was performed at 60-70% confluence using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The total amount of transfected DNA was maintained at 6 μg with an empty vector in the 10-cm plate. In most experiments, the following amounts of DNA were used per one 10-cm plate: 0.6 μg of EGFP, 0.5 μg of BAD, 0.5 μg of BclxL, and 4 μg of C4BRaf, RafER, DN-MEK1, DN-p90rsk, DN-PAK1, DN-Rac, or DN-Cdc42 expression constructs. In co-transfection experiments where the combined effects of C4B-Raf and DN-PAK1 on BAD phosphorylation were studied, the cells were transfected with 0.6 μg of BAD, 0.6 μg of BclXL, and 2.4 μg each of C4B Raf and/or DN-PAK1. In experiments where apoptosis was measured, the cells were transfected as described above, but BclXL was replaced with 0.3 μg of EGFP. Immunoprecipitation—20 h after transfection, cells were deprived of serum for 3 h, and different treatments were given at this point. Cells were harvested in a cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 40 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaVO4, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 40 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The lysates were cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell extracts were incubated with 6-8 μg of anti-HA antibodies (12CA5) overnight at 4 °C and protein A-conjugated beads for another 3 h. Beads were washed three times with cell lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted with an SDS sample buffer for Western blotting analysis. Apoptosis Assays—Apoptosis in a population of transiently transfected GFP-positive cells was measured by time lapse video recording followed by counting the percentage of cells with apoptotic morphology. For these experiments, cells were plated into 6-well plates and transfected by Lipofectamine with a mixture of cDNA that included GFP in a 1:10 ratio. 20 h after transfection, cells were placed in serum-free medium for another 20 h and treated with 50 μm LY294002 and 1 μm thapsigargin to induce apoptosis. 15 min later, cells were treated with EGF or 4-OH tamoxifen (4HT). Video recording was performed on an Axiovert100 microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a moving stage and climate control chamber (37 °C, 5% CO2) and controlled by Openlab software (Improvision Inc., Lexington, MA). At least four randomly chosen fields containing 250-350 cells for each treatment were recorded. Apoptosis in fragmented cells was confirmed by immunofluorescent detection of active caspase 3 and nuclear fragmentation. For this purpose, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and stained with antibodies to active caspase 3 (Idun Pharmaceuticals, La Jolla, CA), followed by goat antirabbit antibodies conjugated with CY5 (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and 0.2 μg/ml 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Then cells were rinsed in distilled water and mounted using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Fluorescent and phase-contrast images were taken on an Olympus microscope equipped with digital camera and software from Media Cybernetics Inc., Silver Spring, MD). Apoptosis in whole cell populations was quantitated by measuring caspase 3 activity with the fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-7-amido-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (Bachem) as specified by the manufacturer. For these experiments, attached and floating cells were collected and lysed in caspase lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). Fluorescence was recorded each 15 min for 1 h, and caspase activity was expressed in arbitrary units. Presented results were confirmed by at least two independent experiments. Tyrosine Kinase Activity of EGFR Is Required for EGF-induced BAD Phosphorylation and Cell Survival—Previously, we reported that EGF delays apoptosis in LNCaP cells in the presence of PI3K inhibitors and cycloheximide (16Kulik G. Carson J.P. Vomastek T. Overman K. Gooch B.D. Srinivasula S. Alnemri E. Nunez G. Weber M.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2713-2719PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that BAD phosphorylation was necessary for antiapoptotic effects of EGF. BAD2SA where Ser112 and Ser136 were replaced with alanines behaved as a dominant negative mutant that inhibited the antiapoptotic effect of EGF (26Sastry K.S. Smith A.J. Karpova Y. Datta S.R. Kulik G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20891-20901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the signaling mechanism of EGF-induced BAD phosphorylation was not clear. The proapoptotic function of BAD is inhibited by phosphorylation at Ser112, Ser136, and Ser155 (based on the mouse sequence), whereas dephosphorylation of BAD promotes apoptosis (27Bergmann A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 607-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of endogenous BAD in LNCaP cells can be detected with phospho-specific antibodies raised against Ser112; however, phospho-specific antibodies to Ser136 and Ser155 are not sensitive enough to detect phosphorylation of endogenous BAD in whole cell lysates. Therefore, analysis of BAD phosphorylation was conducted in cells that ectopically express HA-BAD. Time course analysis of BAD phosphorylation demonstrated that endogenous and ectopically expressed proteins underwent similar changes in cells treated with combinations of LY294002 and EGF; the addition of LY294002 resulted in continuous dephosphorylation of BAD, whereas EGF restored BAD phosphorylation (Fig. 1, A and B). In these experiments, HA-BAD was expressed at a 1:4 ratio to endogenous BAD in order to avoid overexpression-dependent artifacts (Fig. S1). Analysis of phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated HA-BAD showed that after treatment with LY294002, BAD became dephosphorylated at Ser112 and Ser136, whereas treatment with EGF restored phosphorylation at both sites (Fig. 1B and Fig. S2). Treatment of LNCaP cells with EGF induced activation of ERK1/2 but did not restore Akt phosphorylation in the presence of LY294002. Comparable effects of EGF on BAD and ERK phosphorylation were observed in cells maintained in the presence of serum (Fig. S3). Parallel with BAD phosphorylation, we analyzed apoptosis in cells with endogenous BAD levels as well as in cells that ectopically express HA-BAD. In agreement with our previous results, EGF decreased apoptosis in LNCaP cells with endogenous BAD levels (Fig. 1C). Cells that ectopically expressed HA-BAD underwent apoptosis faster, but the antiapoptotic effect of EGF was still evident in these cells (Fig. 1C). Apoptosis in these experiments was measured by time lapse video recording that allows us to follow apoptosis in individual cells. Cells with apoptotic morphology were also recognized with antibodies to active caspase 3 (Fig. 1D). Time lapse results were further confirmed by caspase assays that allow quantification of apoptosis in a whole cell population. Caspase assays showed that EGF decreased apoptosis in LNCaP as well as in C4-2 cells characterized by higher tumorigenic potential. Consistent with the results of time lapse video recording in LNCaP cells that transiently express HA-BAD, increased apoptosis was observed in C4-2LucBAD cells that stably express HA-BAD (Fig. 1E). To characterize the mechanism utilized by EGF to induce BAD phosphorylation and to protect LNCaP cells from apoptosis, we began by testing whether tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor is necessary for BAD phosphorylation and survival. LNCaP cells were treated with 10 μm AG1478, a selective inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase, and BAD phosphorylation was followed by Western blotting. AG1478 blocked the ability of EGF to activate EGFR (Fig. S4A) and inhibited EGF-induced phosphorylation of BAD at both Ser112 and Ser136 in cells treated with PI3K inhibitor (Fig. S4B). Similarly, the antiapoptotic effect of EGF was completely blocked in the presence of AG1478 (Fig. S4C). These results indicate that EGFR tyrosine kinase activity is necessary for protection from apoptosis and BAD phosphorylation in prostate cancer cells. Ras/Raf Signaling Induces Phosphorylation of Ser112 BAD—Ras activation plays an important role in proliferative and survival signaling downstream from receptor tyrosine kinases (28Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Raf kinases are identified as immediate downstream effectors of Ras transmitting signal to ERK1/2 kinases. Because there was a strong correlation between activation of ERK1/2 and BAD phosphorylation induced by EGF (Fig. 1A), we began from analysis of this pathway. To address the role of the Ras/Raf signaling module in BAD phosphorylation, we took advantage of inhibitory and conditionally activated mutants of C-Raf. The C4B-Raf protein contains only the N-terminal regulatory domain of the C-Raf protein that interacts with the Ras, displaces endogenous Ras effectors, and therefore blocks Ras function (29Kerkhoff E. Houben R. Loffler S. Troppmair J. Lee J.E. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). First the effects of dominant negative C4B-Raf on BAD phosphorylation stimulated by EGF were examined. LNCaP cells wereco-transfected with C4B-Raf and HA-BAD, and BAD phosphorylation was analyzed after treatments with LY294002 and EGF. The C4B-Raf significantly inhibited EGF-induced Ser112 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 3 and 6); however, Ser136 phosphorylation was only slightly diminished. Constitutive Akt phosphorylation was unaffected by C4B-Raf, suggesting the absence of the cross-talk between Raf and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in LNCaP cells (Fig. S5). In order to test if the activation of Raf kinase is sufficient to induce BAD phosphorylation, we used a ΔRaf-1:ER construct (30Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Deletion of the regulatory domain of Raf-1 generates a constitutively active kinase. Fusion of this deletion mutant to the hormone-binding domain of the human estrogen receptor creates a chimeric kinase (ΔRaf-1:ER) that is kept in the inactive state bound to heat shock proteins and can be rapidly activated by the estradiol analog 4HT. LNCaP cells were co-transfected with ΔRaf-1:ER and HA-BAD, and BAD phosphorylation was examined. The addition of 1 μm 4HT to the cells expressing ΔRaf-1:ER induced robust phosphorylation of BAD at Ser112 (Fig. 2A, lane 9). In sharp contrast, the Ser136 BAD phosphorylation was not induced by activated Raf-1 kinase. Since Raf-1 was previously implicated in survival signaling (31Erhardt P. Schremser E.J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5308-5315Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 32Wang H.G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether Raf-1 activation alone is sufficient to protect LNCaP cells from LY294002-induced apoptosis. Cells were transfected with a mixture of cDNA encoding ΔRaf-1:ER and GFP, and the apoptotic cell death of GFP-positive cells was followed by time-lapse video recording. As shown in Fig. 2B, both EGF and 4HT inhibited apoptosis with similar efficacies. Results of apoptosis analysis by time lapse video recording were further confirmed by cleavage of caspase 3 substrate GFP-DEVD-BFP (pGDB). Treatment of LNCaP cells transfected with empty vector with EGF or cells transfected with ΔRaf-1:ER construct with 4HT reduced the appearance of cleaved product in cells incubated with LY294002 (Fig. 2C). Similar data were obtained in C4-2 cells. In summary, EGF-induced phosphorylation of BAD at Ser112 is mediated via the Ras/Raf module. Activation of this signaling pathway alone is sufficient to protect against LY294002-induced cell death. MEK1 Inhibition Abrogates Ser112 Phosphorylation Induced by EGF—MEK1 is a dual specificity kinase, which is activated by kinases of the Raf family and in turn activates ERKs (33Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). We next examined the role of MEK1 in the EGF-induced survival and phosphorylation of BAD. Treatment of LNCaP cells with a pharmacological inhibitor of MEK1 activation PD98059 prevented EGF-induced phosphorylation of Ser112 but did not affect Ser136 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). Analysis of apoptosis in cells treated with PD98059 shows a modest effect on EGF-stimulated survival, suggesting that BAD phosphorylation at Ser136 alone is sufficient to mediate the cytoprotective effect of EGF (Figs. 3B and S6). Since PD98059 can inhibit MEK1, MEK2, and MEK5, we sought to determine which kinase is regulating Ser112 phosphorylation. For this purpose, we used a dominant negative MEK1(S218A/S222A) that specifically inhibits activation of ERK1/2 but not ERK5/big MAP kinase 1 (34Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with DN-MEK1 and HA-BAD, and BAD phosphorylation was examined. Ser112 phosphorylation induced by EGF was significantly reduced in cells expressing DN-MEK1, confirming that BAD phosphorylation at Ser112 is MEK1-dependent (Fig. 3C). BAD Phosphorylation at Ser112 Is Independent from p90rsk and MSK1—The kinases of the p90rsk family have been reported to mediate BAD phosphorylation induced by antiapoptotic agonists downstream of MEK1 (35Bonni A. Brunet A. West A.E. Datta S.R. Takasu M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar, 36Shimamura A. Ballif B.A. Richards S.A. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 127-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 37Tan Y. Ruan H. Demeter M.R. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34859-34867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We therefore speculated that p90rsk might be the candidate kinase for Ser112 BAD phosphorylation induced by EGF. To test this hypothesis, we examined p90rsk activation in LNCaP cells. Analysis of p90rsk phosphorylation at Thr359/Ser363 (required for kinase activation) has shown that EGF activates p90rsk in an MEK-dependent fashion (Fig. 4A). p90rsk possesses two kinase domains. When activities of these kinase domains are disabled by mutations in ATP binding loops, mutant p90rsk (K112R/K464R) acquires dominant negative properties. Indeed, a dominant negative effect of p90rsk (K112R/K464R) in LNCaP cells was clearly evident in the experiment that examined CREB phosphorylation induced by EGF (Fig. 4B). Next, we tested whether inhibiting p90rsk prevents BAD phosphorylation at Ser112. However, to our surprise, co-expression of p90rsk (K112R/K464R) with HA-BAD failed to inhibit EGF-induced phosphorylation at Ser112 (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these data indicate that EGF-induced phosphorylation of BAD at Ser112 is independent from p90rsk. Another kinase downstream from ERK1/2 that potentially can phosphorylate BAD is mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1 (MSK1) (38She Q.B. Ma W.Y. Zhong S. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24039-24048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Growth factors and stress signaling via ERK1/2 or p38 are known to activate MSK1, which in turn phosphorylates CREB and other substrates. Indeed, UV and EGF induced CREB phosphorylation in cells transfected with empty vector but not in cells where kinase-deficient MSK1(D195A) was co-transfected with CREB (Fig. 4C). To address the possible role of this kinase, we examined effects of MSK1(D195A) on BAD phosphorylation. In contrast to CREB phosphorylation, BAD phosphorylation induced by EGF was not inhibited by MSK1(D195A) (Fig. 4D). Thus, neither p90rsk nor MSK1 phosphorylates BAD at Ser112 downstream of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. Expression of PAK1(K299R) Inhibits EGF-induced BAD Phosphorylation at Ser136—We then turned our attention to the signaling pathway that leads to phosphorylation of BAD at Ser136. So far, Akt, PAK1, and p70S6 kinases have been implicated in BAD phosphorylation at this site (39Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9106-9109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). EGF induces BAD phosphorylation in the presence of LY294002, which inhibits PI3K and Akt activity, suggesting that Akt is not responsible for this effect (see Fig. 1A). Likewise, EGF-induced phosphorylation of BAD remained intact regardless of the inhibition of p70S6 kinase phosphorylation by rapamycin (Fig. S7). Next, we examined the role of PAK1 in BAD phosphorylation at Ser136. When activated, PAK1 phosphorylates MEK1 at Ser298; therefore, PAK1 activation can be followed with phospho-specific antibodies that recognize MEK phosphorylation at this site (43Frost J.A. Steen H.

So far, the role of stress-dependent phosphorylation of mammalian sHsps for its structure and function has been analyzed by using various phosphorylation site mutants overexpressed in different cell types as well as by non-exclusive inhibitors of the p38 MAPK cascade. Here we investigate the role of phosphorylation of endogenous sHsp in a genetic model lacking the major Hsp25 kinase, the MAP kinase-activated protein kinase MK2. We demonstrate that in MK2-deficient fibroblasts, where no stress-dependent phosphorylation of Hsp25 at Ser86 and no in vitro binding to 14-3-3 was detectable, stress-dependent disaggregation of endogenous Hsp25 complexes is impared and kinetics of arsenite-dependent, H2O2-dependent, and sublethal heat shock-induced insolubilization of Hsp25 is delayed. Similarly, green fluorescent protein-tagged Hsp25 shows retarded subcellular accumulation into stress granules in MK2-deficient cells after arsenite treatment. Decreased insolubilization of Hsp25 in MK2-deficient cells correlates with increased resistance against arsenite, H2O2, and sublethal heat shock treatment and with decreased apoptosis. In contrast, after severe, lethal heat shock MK2-deficient embryonic fibroblasts cells show fast and complete insolubilization of Hsp25 independent of MK2 and no increased stress resistance. Hence, MK2-dependent formation of insoluble stress granules and irreversible cell damage by oxidative stresses and sublethal heat shock correlate and only upon severe, lethal heat shock MK2-independent processes could determine insolubilization of Hsp25 and are more relevant for cellular stress damage.

Here we analyze properties of endogenous Hsp25 in genetically altered cells where a part of the gene for the major sHsp kinase MK2 is deleted leading to the complete loss of MK2 activity (29Kotlyarov A. Neininger A. Schubert C. Eckert R. Birchmeier C. Volk H.D. Gaestel M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). In these cells, Hsp25 completely lacks both Ser86 phosphorylation and stress-dependent disaggregation. In addition, insolubilization of Hsp25 is delayed in response to arsenite, H2O2, and sublethal heat shock treatment, the resulting consequences in stress resistance are described.

Cell Culture, Treatment, and Transient Transfection—Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from wild type (WT) and MK2-deficient mice were immortalized by tranfection with SV40 large T antigen (60Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 163-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Primary and immortalized MEF cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere 5% CO2 and 95% air. 70–90% confluent cells were pretreated for 30 min with 10 μm SBSB203580 or SB202474 if required and treated with heat shock, H2O2, or sodium arsenite as indicated. Cells were transfected when they reached about 70% confluence. Transfection by Lipofectamine was done in accordance to manufacturer's protocol in 24-well plates. Cells were used for experiments 24 h after transfection. Proliferation Assay—Cell viability was estimated by cell proliferation kit (WST-1). Cells were plated in the 96-well plate (triplicate wells for each treatment) at the density about 1000 cells/well in 0.1 ml of medium/well, and cell growth was measured the next day after treatment and expressed as the percentage of controls. Detection of Apoptosis—Cells were seeded into a 96-well plate as described for proliferation assay. Cells were treated by continuous stimulation with 100 μm arsenite or 400 nm H2O2 for 5 h. Active caspase 3/7 was measured using the Apo-ONE homogeneous assay (Promega, Madison, WI). Cell Lysis and Western Blot—Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS in a 10-cm plate, scraped, and resuspend in 100 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 2 μg/ml leupepine, 0.27 m sucrose, 10% protease inhibitor mixture complete mini-EDTA-free (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). After incubating on ice for 10 min lysates were centrifuged (16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was transferred into a new tube. Soluble/insoluble protein fraction analysis was performed as described before (30Cuesta R. Laroia G. Schneider R.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1460-1470PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm HEPES at pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm glycerophosphate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10% protease inhibitor mixture). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 16,000 × g. The pellet was retained as an insoluble fraction and the supernatant as a soluble protein. Pellets were resuspend in RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10% protease inhibitor mixture). For gel filtration experiments, cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% protease inhibitor mixture (61). Protein concentration was determined using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Western Blot Analysis—Equal amounts of protein were boiled for 3 min in 4 × SDS-Laemmli sample buffer (40% glycerol, 4% SDS, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.4 m Tris-HCl at pH 6.7 and 2 mg/ml bromphenol blue) and then separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked 1 h in 0.01% Tween 20-PBS (TPBS) containing 5% powered skim milk and then incubated with primary antibody (dilution in accordance to manufacture recommendations) overnight at 4 °C. Then membranes were washed three times with TPBS and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (dilution 1:1000 in blocking solution), washed three times with TPBS, and developed with a chemiluminiscence ECL kit using a LAS-3000 (Fuji) imager. Gel Filtration—Size exclusion liquid chromatography was carried out on two consequently connected Superose 6HR 30/10 columns (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Uppsala, Sweden), equilibrated with 0.05 m K2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.2, 0.15 M NaCl. As a molecular markers, the following combination of proteins were used: tyroglobulin (660 kDa), catalase (230 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), and cytochrome (12 kDa). Proteins from fractions were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid-deoxycholate: to 1 volume of protein solution 0.01 volume of 2% deoxycholate was added. After vortex and incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, 0.10 volume of 100% trichloroacetic acid was added. After vortex, samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C, then centrifuged 15 min at 16,000 × g, dried on air, dissolved in 4× Laemmli sample buffer, and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Hsp25 in fractions was detected by Western blot and quantified with the AIDA program (Raytest Inc., Straubenhardt, Germany). Glutaraldehyde Cross-linking—Cross-linking experiment was carried out as was described before (31Lambert H. Charette S.J. Bernier A.F. Guimond A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9378-9385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar): equal volumes and amounts of cell lysates were mixed with one volume of 0–0.4% glutaraldehyde in water. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding one volume of 1 m Tris-HCl containing 10% SDS and 10 mm EDTA. Aliquots were subjected to 5–15% SDS-PAGE. Cross-linked Hsp25 was detected by immunobloting with antibody against Hsp25. Immunocytochemistry—The cells were seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and left overnight to attach. After treatment, cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde. F-actin was stained with TRITC-phalloidin. Pulldown Experiments—After stimulation with arsenite cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed. Lysates were incubated with 10 μg of GST-fused 14-3-3 or GST protein and 25 μl of glutathione beads overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times with ice-cold IP buffer (Tris-buffered saline, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4) and subjected to 12% SDS gel followed by Western blot. Hsp25 was detected by anti-Hsp25 antibody. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. Comparisons between wild type and MK2-deficient cells were performed using Student's t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. p38- and MK2-dependent Phosphorylation of sHsps upon Stress Treatment by Arsenite—To analyze the role of phosphorylation of endogenous sHsp we first investigated the suitability of phospho-specific antibodies for Western blot detection of phospho-sHsps in lysates from mouse and human cells. For MEFs arsenite-stimulated phosphorylation of serine residue 86 (pSer86), one of the two known MK2 phosphorylation sites in Hsp25 (10Stokoe D. Engel K. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Gaestel M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), can be clearly detected (Fig. 1A). Arsenite-stimulated phosphorylation of Hsp25 at this site can be reduced by SB203580, the classical compound for inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway (32Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar), while an inactive structurally related compound, SB202474, does not have an effect. Antibodies against the human homologue of the other MK2 phosphorylation site in Hsp25, serine 15, fail to detect the phospho-protein from mouse cells (data not shown). To understand whether there are general differences in stress-dependent phosphorylation of these two sites of sHsps, we analyzed Hsp27 phosphorylation at serine 15 and serine 82, the homologous site to Ser86 in mouse, in human HeLa cells (Fig. 1B). It can be seen that both sites are similarly phosphorylated in response to arsenite treatment and that this phosphorylation is almost completely inhibited by SB203580. Hence, we got the impression that analysis of Hsp25-pSer86 will be representative for stress-dependent phosphorylation of sHsps at both sites. In HeLa cells, we also used a newly developed inhibitor against MK2 and MK3, the compound 2,4-diamino-5H-chromeno-[2,3-b]pyridine-3-carbonitrile (U. S. Patent 2004/0127511), designated as MK2-I. In a concentration of 15 μm, this inhibitor, which has an IC50 of about 0.6 μm, also leads to a significant inhibition of Hsp27 phosphorylation at both sites analyzed. This clearly indicates the role of the p38 MAPK cascade including the downstream kinases MK2 and/or MK3 in sHsp phosphorylation. After having shown that the anti-pSer86 antibody is well suited for monitoring Hsp25 phosphorylation in MEFs, we decided to use this antibody in genetically altered MEFs, which lack the protein kinase MK2 (29Kotlyarov A. Neininger A. Schubert C. Eckert R. Birchmeier C. Volk H.D. Gaestel M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). While in WT cells an arsenite-dependent phosphorylation of Hsp25 can be detected, it is absent in MK2-deficient (MK2–/–) cells, although p38 is activated in both cell lines to a comparable degree (Fig. 1C). This supports the notion that MK2 is the major kinase that phosphorylates endogenous Hsp25 after arsenite treatment in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Analysis of Hsp25 Oligomerization in WT and MK2–/– MEFs upon Arsenite Treatment—Since arsenite-induced phosphorylation of Hsp25 is absent in MK2–/– MEFs, this cell line should be well suited to analyze the role of phosphorylation of endogenous Hsp25 for its oligomerization in vivo. First, size exclusion chromatography of lysates from non-stimulated and arsenite-treated WT and MK2–/– cells was performed (Fig. 2). We were able to detect two different peaks for Hsp25. Hsp25 exists both as oligomers up to about 660 kDa, with the mean of oligomeric molecular mass at about 430 kDa corresponding to about 16–18 subunits and as tetramer, dimer, or monomer in a mass range between 25 and 75 kDa (Fig. 2A). In non-stimulated cells, Hsp25 is nearly equally distributed between high (660–75 kDa) and low (75–25 kDa) molecular mass fractions and there is no obvious difference detected between WT and MK2–/– (Fig. 2B). However, after arsenite treatment the amount of Hsp25 in high molecular mass complexes is significantly decreased in WT cells, whereas arsenite-treated MK2–/– cells show no difference from control samples as also seen from quantification of three independent gel filtration experiments (Fig. 2B). Keeping in mind that Western blot is a semiquantitative method and that its quantification is limited, we demonstrate that about 99% (p < 0.05) of total Hsp25 in WT cells is forming low molecular mass complexes after arsenite treatment, whereas only about 44% are found in this fraction in control cells. In MK2–/– the ratio between high and low molecular mass fraction stays without significant differences after stimulation with arsenite. To confirm these results we performed cross-linking experiments. At glutaraldehyde (GA) concentrations as low as 0.01, dimers of Hsp25 can be cross-linked (Fig. 3A). Starting at a GA concentration of 0.1%, in non-stressed WT and MK2–/– cells, cross-linked dimers disappear and instead larger cross-linking products due to large oligomers appear. After arsenite treatment these large cross-linking products can hardly be detected in WT cells. Instead, at GA concentrations of 0.1–0.4% mainly dimers are cross-linked indicating the disaggregation of large oligomers. In contrast, only low levels of dimers are detectable at GA concentrations of 0.1 or higher in arsenite-treated MK2–/– cells, and instead, large cross-linking products appear. This confirms the notion that the stress-induced disaggregation of Hsp25 is impaired in MK2-deficient cells. We also used phospho-Ser86 antibody to detect phospho-Hsp25 in cross-linked samples. As expected, phosphorylated Hsp25 can only be detected in WT cells after arsenite stimulation (Fig. 3B). Compared with total Hsp25, phospho-Hsp25 seems to be enriched in dimers suggesting that phosphorylation functionally supports disaggregation of Hsp25 oligomers to dimers or, alternatively, that phosphorylation interferes with GA-cross-linking. MK2-dependent Hsp25-14-3-3 Interaction in Vitro—14-3-3 proteins are expressed widely, are implicated in regulation of many processes in the cell, like cell viability and apoptosis, and interact with more than 200 proteins, predominantly after phosphorylation (33Dougherty M.K. Morrison D.K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1875-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 34Pozuelo Rubio M. Geraghty K.M. Wong B.H. Wood N.T. Campbell D.G. Morrice N. Mackintosh C. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Since one of sHsps family members, Hsp20, had been recently identified as 14-3-3-binding protein (35Dreiza C.M. Brophy C.M. Komalavilas P. Furnish E.J. Joshi L. Pallero M.A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. von Rechenberg M. Ho Y.S. Richardson B. Xu N. Zhen Y. Peltier J.M. Panitch A. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and since MK2 phosphorylation can generate 14-3-3 binding sites in case of other MK2 substrates (36Gaestel M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), we asked whether Hsp25 interacts with 14-3-3 proteins in a MK2-dependent manner. Accordingly, recombinant GST-fused 14-3-3 proteins have been used for pulldown experiments. MEFs were untreated or stimulated with 200 μm arsenite for 1 h, lysed, and incubated with GST-14-3-3γ. Hsp25 interacts with 14-3-3-γ after stimulation of the cell culture with arsenite but not in control cells (Fig. 4). The interaction is p38-dependent, since SB203580 significantly decreased Hsp25 binding to 14-3-3-γ protein. The interaction is also MK2-dependent, since no Hsp25 was detected in pulldown experiments with 14-3-3 γ using lysates from arsenite-stimulated MK2–/– cells. Hsp25 had been detected in pull down with isoforms 14-3-3-β,ϵ,η,σ, τ,ζ in vitro in a MK2-dependent manner as well (data not shown), indicating that there is no strict isoform specificity for this interaction at least in vitro. However, in the in vitro binding assay less than 5% of phosphorylated Hsp25 is bound to the GST-14-3-3 proteins present in stoichiometric excess and the interaction needs to be confirmed in vivo. Effect of Heat Shock and Arsenite on Actin Cytoskeleton Disruption in WT and MK2–/– MEF Cells—sHsps and their phosphorylation have been demonstrated to play a role in actin reorganization (20Lavoie J.N.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20780-20784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the influence of MK2-mediated phosphorylation on the ability of endogenous Hsp25 to alter actin cytoskeleton in MEFs, actin filaments in control cells and cells treated either with heat shock or with arsenite were stained with TRITC-phalloidin. As shown in Fig. 5, after arsenite stimulation with a dose and for a time that were sufficient to cause remarkable phosphorylation of endogenous Hsp25 as well as changes in Hsp25 oligomer structure, no differences between WT and MK2–/– cells in regard to actin cytoskeleton can be detected after 2 h. Moreover, this concentration of arsenite did not cause any detectable changes in actin cytoskeleton in these cells after 2 h compared with non-treated control. However, after 3 h there is a lethal effect seen for WT cells which detach and round up, while MK2–/– cells are only slightly changed in morphology. As a control, lethal heat shock treatment at 45 °C leads to effects such as detachment and round up in both WT and MK2–/– cells. Apart from this, no visible differences could be detected between WT and MK2–/– cells in actin remodeling after PDGF treatment (data not shown). Taken together, it is unlikely that there is a direct effect of MK2-dependent Hsp25 phosphorylation on actin remodeling in the MEFs analyzed, but differences could exist in cellular resistance against arsenite.

https://openalex.org/W1991075336,"The ATPase subunit of the osmoregulatory ATP-binding cassette transporter OpuA from Lactococcus lactis has a C-terminal extension, the tandem cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) domain, which constitutes the sensor that allows the transporter to sense and respond to osmotic stress (Biemans-Oldehinkel, E., Mahmood, N. A. B. N., and Poolman, B. (2006) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 103, 10624–10629). C-terminal of the tandem CBS domain is an 18-residue anionic tail (DIPDEDEVEEIEKEEENK). To investigate the ion specificity of the full transporter, we probed the activity of inside-out reconstituted wild-type OpuA and the anionic tail deletion mutant OpuAΔ12; these molecules have the tandem CBS domains facing the external medium. At a mole fraction of 40% of anionic lipids in the membrane, the threshold ionic strength for activation of OpuA was ∼0.15, irrespective of the electrolyte composition of the medium. At equivalent concentrations, bivalent cations (Mg2+ and Ba2+) were more effective in activating OpuA than NH4+, K+, Na+, or Li+, consistent with an ionic strength-based sensing mechanism. Surprisingly, Rb+ and Cs+ were potent inhibitors of wild-type OpuA, and 0.1 mm RbCl was sufficient to completely inhibit the transporter even in the presence of 0.2 m KCl. Rb+ and Cs+ were no longer inhibitory in OpuAΔ12, indicating that the anionic C-terminal tail participates in the formation of a binding site for large alkali metal ions. Compared with OpuAΔ12, wild-type OpuA required substantially less potassium ions (the dominant ion under physiological conditions) for activation.

Bacteria respond to osmotic stress by adjusting the pools of cellular osmolytes, thereby keeping the volume, crowding of the cytoplasm, and the turgor within certain limits (1Wood J.M. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 230-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following an osmotic upshift of the external medium, cells accumulate and/or synthesize compatible solutes to compensate the loss of water and decrease in cell volume. How an enzyme or transporter senses osmotic stress and transduces the signal into an activity change represents one of the major challenges in the field of cellular osmoregulation. Sensing of osmotic stress is best understood for a few osmoregulatory transporters and mechanosensitive channel proteins (2Poolman B. Spitzer J.J. Wood J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1666: 88-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The osmoregulatory transporters protect cells against hyperosmotic stress and ultimately plasmolysis by accumulating compounds like glycine betaine or proline against large concentration gradients. The mechanosensitive channel proteins protect cells against hypoosmotic stress, and ultimately lysis, by rapid efflux down the concentration gradient of these and other osmolytes. The mechanism of osmosensing and the regulation of the mechanosensitive channels are entirely different from that of the osmoregulatory transporters and are discussed elsewhere (2Poolman B. Spitzer J.J. Wood J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1666: 88-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The best understood osmoregulatory transporters are the ProP protein from Escherichia coli, the BetP protein from Corynebacterium glutamicum, and the OpuA system from Lactococcus lactis (3van der Heide T. Stuart M.C. Poolman B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7022-7032Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 4Racher K.I. Culham D.E. Wood J.M.

Whereas ProP and BetP are driven by the electrochemical proton and sodium gradient across the membrane, respectively, OpuA is driven by ATP. Despite the differences in energy coupling mechanisms and protein structures (the polypeptides belong to entirely different protein families), there is a common denominator in the osmosensing mechanisms. When reconstituted in proteoliposomes, each of the systems is activated by an increase in concentration of luminal ions. For BetP, the larger alkali ions K+, Rb+ and Cs+ are more effective in activating than Na+ or NH4+ (5Rübenhagen R. Morbach S. Kramer R.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 563: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), whereas ProP and OpuA seem largely ion-aspecific (3van der Heide T. Stuart M.C. Poolman B.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 410-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but extensive titration experiments have not been reported. For the ATP-binding cassette transporter OpuA, there is strong evidence that the protein senses cytoplasmic ion concentrations (8Biemans-Oldehinkel E. Mahmood N.A.B.N. Poolman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10624-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This sensing is mediated by a regulatory domain, known as the CBS 2The abbreviations used are: CBS, cystathionine β-synthase; DDM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; DOPG, l-α-dioleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol; DOPE, l-α-dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine; DOPC, l-α-dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine. module, whose activity is dependent on the fraction of charged lipids in the membrane and the ionic strength. At physiologically relevant fractions of anionic lipids and low ionic strength, the transporter is inactive but can be “switched on” rapidly by increasing the ionic strength (i.e. following a decrease in cell or vesicle volume in response to an osmotic upshift). The activation-deactivation process is entirely reversible. The OpuA transporter is composed of two substrate-binding translocator subunits and two ATPase subunits (9van der Heide T. Poolman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7102-7106Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 10van der Heide T. Poolman B. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 938-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Covalently linked to the ATPase subunit are two CBS domains, here referred to as the tandem CBS domain. The functional transporter complex is a dimer, giving OpuA a total of four CBS domains.

Xu Q. Hodgson K.O. Wooley J. Wilson I.A. Proteins. 2004; 57: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), it is clear that two CBS domains combine to form a stable structure. Moreover, two of these tandem CBS structures have a strong tendency to dimerize (the 2 × 2 module (8Biemans-Oldehinkel E. Mahmood N.A.B.N. Poolman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10624-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar)). Although the role of dimerization of two tandem CBS domains in OpuA has not been established, it seems likely that for ionic strength sensing the CBS 2 × 2 module is needed. In this study, we report on the ion specificity of OpuA by precisely monitoring the activity of inside-out reconstituted transporter molecules and titration of the external ion composition and ionic strength. We demonstrate that the species-specific C-terminal tails of the CBS module tune the ionic sensitivity of the transporter. L. lactis strain Opu401 (derivative of NZ9000 with chromosomal opuA genes deleted (8Biemans-Oldehinkel E. Mahmood N.A.B.N. Poolman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The strains were grown semi-anaerobically at 30 °C in a medium containing 2% (w/v) gistex LS (Strik BV, Eemnes, Netherlands) and 65 mm potassium phosphate (potassium Pi), pH 6.5, supplemented with 1.0% (w/v) glucose and 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Cells were grown in a 2-liter pH-regulated fermentor to an A600 of 2.0, followed by induction with 0.1% (v/v) culture supernatant of the nisin A-producing strain NZ9700. The cells were harvested, and membrane vesicles were prepared according to standard procedures (9van der Heide T. Poolman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7102-7106Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm potassium Pi, pH 8.0, 200 mm KCl, 20% glycerol) to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml protein and solubilized with 0.5% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation, the solubilized material was incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (0.5 ml of resin per 10 mg of membrane protein) for 1 h at 4°C in the presence of 15 mm imidazole. Next, the resin was washed with 20 column volumes of buffer A supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) DDM and 15 mm imidazole. The His-tagged proteins were eluted from the column with 3 column volumes of buffer A supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) DDM and 200 mm imidazole. Purified OpuA and derivatives were reconstituted in liposomes composed of the desired lipids (Avanti Polar Lipids, AL) as described (9van der Heide T. Poolman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7102-7106Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 13Knol J. Veenhoff L. Liang W.J. Henderson P.J. Leblanc G. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15358-15366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, preformed liposomes (4 mg/ml; DOPG/DOPE/DOPC at mol % of 40:40:20) were destabilized with Triton X-100, and the physical state of the liposomes was monitored by measuring the turbidity of the suspension at 540 nm. Unless stated otherwise, liposomes were destabilized to a point just beyond “detergent saturation” (14Knol J. Sjollema K. Poolman B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16410-16415Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and mixed with purified protein in a 100:1 ratio (w/w). The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C under gentle agitation. To remove the detergent, 40 mg/ml wet weight polystyrene beads (Bio-beads SM2) were added, followed by 15 min of incubation at 4 °C. Biobeads SM2 were added four times, and the incubation times were 15 and 30 min, overnight, and 1 h, respectively, all at 4 °C. After 10× dilution with 50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0 (to lower the glycerol concentration), the proteoliposomes were collected by centrifugation for 1.5 h at 150,000 × g and 4 °C, resuspended to 20 mg/ml of lipid in 50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0, flash-frozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen. In a typical experiment (final concentrations are indicated), MgATP at 10 mm (prepared from 10 mm MgSO4 and 10 mm Na2ATP) and adjusted to pH 7.0 together with creatine kinase (2.4 mg/ml; Roche Diagnostics) and creatine phosphate (24 mm, disodium salt; Sigma) in 50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0, were mixed together with the proteoliposomes (20 mg of lipid/ml) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The mixture was slowly thawed (tubes with proteoliposomes were placed in contact with the wall of a styrofoam block) at room temperature. The freeze-thaw cycles were repeated five times, after which proteoliposomes were made homogenous by extrusion through polycarbonate filters (200 nm pore size). Subsequently, the external components were removed by centrifugation at 300,000 × g for 15 min, and the proteoliposomes were washed two times before resuspension in isotonic media, in most experiments 100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0. Uptake Assay—ATP-driven uptake of glycine betaine in proteoliposomes was conducted as described before (9van der Heide T. Poolman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7102-7106Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, concentrated proteoliposomes (80 mg/ml of lipid) were diluted 3.2-fold into isotonic (100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0) or hypertonic medium (50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0, plus 0.45 m sucrose); hypertonic media were used to osmotically activate the transporter. Following incubation for 2 min at 30 °C, the transport reaction was initiated by addition of [14C]glycine betaine (Amersham Biosciences) to a final concentration of 45 μm (more than 10-fold above the Km value for transport and the KD value for glycine betaine binding) (15Biemans-Oldehinkel E. Poolman B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5983-5993Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). At given time intervals, 8-μl samples were taken and diluted with 2 ml of ice-cold isotonic medium (100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0, or 50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0, supplemented with 0.45 m sucrose). The samples were filtered rapidly through 0.45-μm pore-size cellulose nitrate filters (Schleicher & Schuell) and washed twice with 2 ml of assay medium. The radioactivity on the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The uptake reaction was followed for 12–13 min, and part of the reaction mixture (preloaded proteoliposomes) was kept on ice for subsequent efflux experiments (see under “Efflux Assay”). Efflux Assay—The proteoliposomes, preloaded with [14C]glycine betaine (50–100 nmol/mg OpuA, corresponding to 0.50–1 nmol/mg lipid or 0.5–1 mm concentration), were diluted five times into 10 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0, and preincubated for 3 min at 30 °C. Following addition of 10 mm MgATP (prepared from 10 mm MgSO4 plus 10 mm Na2ATP or 10 mm K2ATP) and incubation for another 2 min, [14C]glycine betaine efflux was initiated by diluting the mixture 2-fold with pre-warmed 10 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0, supplemented with different concentrations (up to 250–350 mm) of KCl, NaCl, LiCl, RbCl, CsCl, NH4Cl, MgCl2, or BaCl2. The rate of efflux was estimated from the decrease in internal [14C]glycine betaine concentration, which was linear for a period of up to 1.5–2 min (4–5 time points). At given time intervals, 75-μl samples were withdrawn and diluted with 2 ml of ice-cold isotonic assay medium. Rapid filtration, washing of the filter, and counting of radioactivity were done as described under “Uptake Assay.” The reported average rates of glycine betaine efflux plus the standard error were calculated from n independent experiments, as specified in the figure legends, and were based on activity assays with protein purified and reconstituted on different days. The rate of glycine betaine efflux (v) as a function ion concentration ([ion]) generally followed a sigmoid function (Equation 1) from which the maximal activity (Amax), the ion activation constant (salt concentration required to attain half-maximal activity, Kion), and a constant n (related to the slope of the curve and reflecting the cooperativity for salt) were obtained, v=Amax·1+KionnIonn-1(Eq. 1) This analysis is similar to the one used by Wood and co-workers (16Culham D.E. Hillar A. Henderson J. Ly A. Vernikovska Y.I. Racher K.I. Boggs J.M. Wood J.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11815-11823Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) for the ProP system, except that here only the response to salt concentration is considered. Moreover, we empirically define the threshold ion concentration (Tion) for activation as the point where the tangent of the sigmoid intersects the x axis (2Poolman B. Spitzer J.J. Wood J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1666: 88-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The ionic strength (I) was calculated from the concentrations of ions, according to I=12Σcizi2, where ci and zi are the concentration and valence of the ith ion in the solution. Ions taken into account include K+, HPO42-, H2PO4-, ATP4–, Mg2+, SO42-, Na+ and assuming that Mg2+ is largely complexed with ATP4– (dissociation constant ∼0.1 mm). Thus, Mg-ATP2– rather than ATP4– was taken as the prevailing ionic species in the solution. Previous work has shown that for maximal activity of OpuA, proteoliposomes should contain 25–40 mol % of anionic lipids (3van der Heide T. Stuart M.C. Poolman B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7022-7032Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 8Biemans-Oldehinkel E. Mahmood N.A.B.N. Poolman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10624-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We have now used 40 mol % of l-α-dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG) to observe full osmoregulatory activity (maximal activity at high salt; less than 1% activity below threshold levels of salt) and to be within the physiological range of anionic lipid concentrations for L. lactis (17Driessen A.J. Zheng T. In't Veld G. Op den Kamp J.A. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The reconstitution procedure yielded both right-side-in and inside-out oriented OpuA molecules, as described previously (18Poolman B. Doeven M.K. Geertsma E.R. Biemans-Oldehinkel E. Konings W.N. Rees D.C. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 400: 429-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In fact, by freezingthawing the proteoliposomes multiple times, the orientation became random as could be inferred from the initial rates of uptake and efflux. The basal medium in which the transport assays were carried out contained 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0 (isotonic medium), or 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, plus 450 mm sucrose (hypertonic medium). Hypertonic conditions caused the proteoliposomes to shrink and the luminal ionic strength to increase. The increase in internal ion concentration activates right-side-in OpuA molecules (8Biemans-Oldehinkel E. Mahmood N.A.B.N. Poolman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10624-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and accumulation of glycine betaine proceeds at the expense of luminal ATP. After 10–15 min of uptake, the glycine betaine level plateaus because of the decrease in ATP and the build up of ADP; the right-side-in oriented OpuA molecules are inactivated under these conditions (19Patzlaff J.S. van der Heide T. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29546-29551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). When Mg-ATP is now added to the external medium, glycine betaine exits the vesicles via the inside-out oriented OpuA molecules, provided the external ionic strength is sufficiently high (see below); the setup of a typical experiment and the activities of right-side-in and inside-out oriented OpuA are shown in Fig. 1. Because the ion-sensing CBS module is on the cytoplasmic face of OpuA, the inside-out oriented molecules allow direct access of the sensor from the external medium. Proteoliposomes pre-loaded with glycine betaine via right-side-in oriented OpuA could be stored on ice for several hours without measurable leak of substrate or loss of activity of inside-out oriented OpuA (data not shown). This enabled us to stockpile batches of proteoliposomes, pre-loaded with [14C]glycine betaine, for subsequent analysis of glycine betaine efflux. Alkali Metals—Fig. 2A shows transport of glycine betaine via inside-out oriented OpuA at different concentrations of KCl added to the basal medium (10 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgSO4 plus 10 mm Na2ATP or 10 mm K2ATP, both corresponding to an ionic strength of ∼0.07). Addition of 50 mm KCl, resulting in a total ionic strength of ∼0.12, or less was insufficient to activate OpuA (▾ in Fig. 2A). Maximal activity was reached around 250 mm KCl, corresponding to an ionic strength of ∼0.32. The XCl concentration dependence of OpuA is plotted for X = K+, Na+, Li+, Rb+, and Cs+ in Fig. 2B; the results were the same for ATP as sodium or potassium salt (not shown). The data were fitted to a sigmoid function from which the maximal activity (Amax) and ion activation constant (Kion) could be estimated (see “Materials and Methods”). Although the Amax was 2-fold higher with KCl and NaCl than with LiCl, the Kion values (∼125 mm XCl plus basal medium components) and the threshold values for activation (Tion values) were similar (∼75 mm XCl plus basal medium components). Also, the apparent cooperativity for salt (n in Equation 1) did not differ significantly for KCl, NaCl, and LiCl and varied between 3.5 and 4.5. Surprisingly, Rb+ and Cs+ ions were unable to activate OpuA. Non-metal Ions—Next, we tested NH4+ as an ion that does not belong to the group 1 elements (alkali metals). Fig. 3A shows that NH4Cl activates OpuA but much less effectively than KCl. Although NH4+ will be membrane-impermeant on the time scale of the measurements, NH3 is highly membrane-permeable, and the influx of NH3 and subsequent protonation will alkalinize the proteoliposome lumen. To prevent build up of a pH gradient, the experiments of Fig. 3A were repeated in the presence of the protonophore 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy benzylidene-malonitrile (SF6847). Fig. 3B shows that in the presence of SF6847, NH4Cl was much more effective than in the absence of the protonophore, indicating that the increase in internal pH was inhibiting the transporter. In fact, in the presence of SF6847, Amax, Kion, n, and Tion values were very similar for NH4Cl and KCl (Fig. 3C). As expected SF6847 had no effect on the activation of OpuA by KCl, because a pH gradient is not formed under these conditions. Alkaline Earth Metals—For an ionic strength-based sensing mechanism, one expects bivalent cations to be more effective than monovalent ions. However, bivalent cations also cause membranes to aggregate and fuse, and ultimately leakage of solutes occurs. Fig. 4A shows that the group 2 alkaline earth metal ions Mg2+ and Ba2+ at concentrations above ∼25 mm caused glycine betaine to aspecifically leak from the proteoliposomes; 10 mm Mg-ADP instead of Mg-ATP was added to prevent transport via OpuA and to keep the ionic composition of the assay medium similar otherwise. These and other control experiments indicated that the integrity of the proteoliposomes was maintained up to at least 20 mm of Mg2+ and Ba2+, which in terms of ionic strength would correspond to 80 mm of monovalent ions. By keeping MgCl2 and BaCl2 at 20 mm and varying the concentration of KCl from 0 to 250 mm, we could show that the bivalent cations were more effective in activating OpuA than KCl (Fig. 4B). The collective data conformed to a nearly unique relationship when plotted as a function of ionic strength (Fig. 4C). Given the wide spectrum of ions capable of activating OpuA, it was puzzling that Rb+ and Cs+ had no effect (Fig. 2B). This could imply that ionic strength is not the principal parameter that is sensed and through which the activity of the transporter is controlled. Alternatively, it is possible that Rb+ and Cs+ do activate but, in addition, exert a secondary inhibitory effect that is distinct from the sensing of ionic strength. To discriminate between these two scenarios, an alternative means of OpuA activation was explored. We have shown previously that the activation profile of OpuA is dependent on the fraction of anionic lipids in the membrane. The higher the fraction of anionic lipids, the more salt was needed for activation. Most importantly, the activation profiles shifted to lower salt concentrations when cationic amphipaths, like tetracaine, were employed (3van der Heide T. Stuart M.C. Poolman B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7022-7032Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These membrane-active compounds insert into the bilayer, slowly flop-flip from the outer to the inner leaflet of the membrane, and “neutralize” part of the negative surface charge originating from the anionic lipids. The flop-flip to the inner membrane leaflet was a prerequisite for the shift in the activation profiles of right-side-in oriented OpuA. More importantly, we now show that inside-out oriented OpuA, reconstituted in membranes with 40% of anionic lipid (DOPG), was instantaneously activated by tetracaine (Fig. 5A), providing further support for the notion that lowering of the negative surface charge at the cytoplasmic face of OpuA is required for activation. Furthermore, this assay allows one to activate the transporter in the absence of salt, simply by adding low concentrations of a cationic amphipath. In fact, 1.2 mm tetracaine proved equally effective as 0.2 m KCl. Tetracaine is effective at this apparent low concentration, because the lipophilic molecule accumulates in the membrane. The membrane partition coefficient for charged tetracaine is at least 100-fold as can be deduced from its logP value of 3.2 (20Avdeef A. Box K.J. Comer J.E. Hibbert C. Tam K.Y. Pharmacol. Res. 1998; 15: 209-215Crossref Scopus (365) Google Scholar) and the correlation between octanol/water and membrane/water partition coefficients of membrane-active compounds (21Sikkema J. de Bont J.A.M. Poolman B. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 201-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the membrane electrostatic potential may be affected similarly by (sub)millimolar concentrations of tetracaine and 0.2 m KCl or NaCl. Contrary to KCl, RbCl completely inhibited the amphipath-induced activation of OpuA, even at concentrations as low as 0.1 mm. Fig. 5B shows that 0.1 mm of RbCl completely inhibited the activation elicited by 200 mm of KCl (with or without tetracaine). At 250 mm KCl part of the inhibition by Rb+ ions was overcome, possibly because K+ interacts at the same site but with a much lower affinity than Rb+. Similar results were obtained with Cs+ ions except that ∼10-fold higher concentrations of this alkali ion were required to achieve the same degree of inhibition (data not shown). These experiments indicate that Rb+ and Cs+ ions inhibit OpuA, and somewhere in the protein complex there must be a site with unusually high affinity for Rb+ (and Cs+) ions and low affinity for K+. Importantly, RbCl and CsCl (tested up to 200 mm) did not inhibit uptake of glycine betaine via right-side-in reconstituted OpuA, demonstrating these ions only inactivate by interacting with the cytoplasmic face of the protein. The ion-sensing CBS module of OpuA is followed by a C-terminal tail with the sequence DIPDEDEVEEIEKEEENK (see also Fig. 6). We have recently shown that deletion of most of this sequence (deleted amino acid sequence is DIPDEDEVEEIEK), yielding OpuAΔ12, shifted the activation profiles of right-side-in reconstituted transporter to higher potassium salt concentrations (8Biemans-Oldehinkel E. Mahmood N.A.B.N. Poolman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10624-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Stated differently, OpuAΔ12 was more strongly inhibited by anionic lipids than wild-type OpuA, possibly through a stronger electrostatic interaction of the CBS module with the membrane surface. This effect could be reproduced for inside-out oriented OpuAΔ12 (compare Fig. 2B and Fig. 7, A and B); the Kion for K+ was increased by at least 0.1 m. Importantly, OpuAΔ12 was no longer inhibited by Rb+ or Cs+ ions (compare Fig. 2B and Fig. 7C). Comparison of the data of wild-type OpuA (Fig. 2B) with those of OpuAΔ12 (Fig. 7, A and B) suggested that, in contrast to K+, activation by Na+ and Li+ was very similar (n = 6). We also investigated the salt dependence of wild-type OpuA and OpuAΔ12 at varying ratios of KCl and NaCl. For wild-type OpuA, all the curves were superimposable, whereas for OpuAΔ12 the activation curves shifted to higher XCl concentrations when the KCl/NaCl ratio was increased (data not shown). These last experiments indicate that the differences between K+ and Na+ are not caused by a specific effect exerted by either K+ or Na+ at low (millimolar or less) concentration, rather the differential effects are additive from 0 to 350 mm. Thus, in"

We identify stable reaction intermediates in the progression of the P-glycoprotein-mediated ATPase reaction equivalent to the enzyme-substrate (E·S, P-glycoprotein·ATP) and enzyme-product (E·P, P-glycoprotein·ADP·Pi) reaction intermediates.

The reaction intermediates were characterized based on their kinetic properties and the nature (triphosphate/diphosphate) of the trapped nucleotide. Using this defined framework and the Walker B E556Q/E1201Q mutant that traps nucleotide in the absence of vanadate or beryllium fluoride, the high to low affinity switch in the transport substrate binding site can be attributed to the formation of the E·S reaction intermediate of the ATPase reaction. Importantly, the posthydrolysis E·P state continues to have low affinity for substrate, suggesting that conformational changes that form the E·S complex are coupled to the conformational change at the transport substrate site to do mechanical work. Thus, the formation of E·S reaction intermediate during a single turnover of the catalytic cycle appears to provide the initial power stroke for movement of drug substrate from inner leaflet to outer leaflet of lipid bilayer.

Understanding how these proteins work is extremely important because of their central role in biology as well as the fact that many members of this group are directly implicated in human diseases (2Gottesman M.M. Ambudkar S.V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The transport cycle of ABC proteins in general and the MDR1 (ABCB1) gene product, P-glycoprotein (Pgp), often regarded as the prototypical ABC transporter, has received considerable attention (see Refs. 3Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 4Sauna Z.E. Smith M.M. Muller M. Kerr K.M. Ambudkar S.V. J. Bioenerg.

George A.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 682-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar for reviews). The ABC transport proteins have discrete nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) and transport substrate binding sites (7Ambudkar S.V. Dey S. Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 361-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar), and it is generally accepted that transport of various substrates from simple ions to complex toxic compounds and proteins involves coupling the energy of ATP hydrolysis to mechanical movements at the transport substrate sites (3Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 4Sauna Z.E. Smith M.M. Muller M. Kerr K.M. Ambudkar S.V. J. Bioenerg.

However, the mechanism of transport is still poorly understood. The challenge has been to identify the causal events at the NBDs that drive conformational changes at the transport substrate sites in the transmembrane domains. Experimental monitoring of the transformation of a high affinity transport substrate site to a low affinity site has been used by several groups (8Martin C. Berridge G. Mistry P. Higgins C. Charlton P. Callaghan R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11901-11906Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 9Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V. Chen D. Hrycyna C.A. Dey S. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I.

Concomitantly, numerous studies have employed the so-called transition state inhibitors, such as orthovanadate (Vi), beryllium fluoride (BeFx), and aluminum fluoride (AlFl4) to trap Pgp at various steps of the ATPase reaction (see Refs. 3Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar and 4Sauna Z.E. Smith M.M. Muller M. Kerr K.M. Ambudkar S.V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar for reviews). Although it may be argued that these reaction intermediates do not represent true transition states, they provide extremely useful experimental benchmarks for the progression of the ATPase reaction. Since numerous studies have demonstrated that ATP hydrolysis provides the energy for transport in ABC transport proteins (4Sauna Z.E. Smith M.M. Muller M. Kerr K.M. Ambudkar S.V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 7Ambudkar S.V. Dey S. Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Dev. 1996; 6: 610-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), clearly identified and characterized reaction intermediates of the ATPase reaction pathway could offer a well defined framework to study the conformational changes that drive transport. The reaction intermediates of enzymatic reactions exist in transition states that have lifetimes in the range of 10-13 s and cannot be observed by physical or spectrometric methods (16Schramm V.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 693-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Enzymes can, however, be captured in their transition states by arresting the reaction intermediates of the chemical reaction at specific steps either by chemical modifications of the substrate or mutations in the enzyme. Numerous ATPases form pentacoordinate complexes with ADP and Vi, and many of these have been shown in crystal structures to represent transition states (for a review, see Ref. 17Davies D.R. Hol W.G.J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The Vi-induced, ADP-trapped state of Pgp has been well characterized (18Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 19Sauna Z.E. Smith M.M. Muller M. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21199-21208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and is believed to be comparable with the posthydrolysis, Pgp·ADP·Pi reaction intermediate. Moreover, recent studies have found that mutating the highly conserved glutamates (Glu556 and Glu1201 in human Pgp) in the Walker B region results in a phenotype wherein the protein shows no transport function and minimal steady-state ATP hydrolysis but can occlude the nucleotide (20Sauna Z.E. Muller M. Peng X.H. Ambudkar S.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13989-14000Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). One explanation for this has been that these conserved glutamates constitute the catalytic carboxylate; consequently, the mutant cannot cleave the bond between the β-P and the γ-P, and ATP is “trapped” (21Tombline G. Bartholomew L.A. Tyndall G.A. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46518-46526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Tombline G. Bartholomew L.A. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31212-31220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). If this were so, the double mutant (E556Q/E1201Q) may, in the presence of nucleotide, represent a prehydrolysis transition state of the Pgp-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis reaction. Such a view is consistent with several recent structures of the NBDs of ABC proteins that suggest that ATP acts as molecular glue bringing together the two NBDs to form the ATP sandwich dimer. Moreover, in recent years, it has been suggested that the formation of the dimer may be coupled to mechanical movements in the transport substrate site. For example, it has been postulated that whereas ATP-driven dimerization provides the power-stroke for the pump, ATP hydrolysis resets the Pgp molecule (5Higgins C.F. Linton K.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 918-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). In this study, we have further characterized and defined reaction intermediates of Pgp-mediated ATP hydrolysis based on their kinetics and the nature of the occluded nucleotide. We also show strong coupling between the NBDs and the transport substrate site(s) in purified and reconstituted wild-type and mutant (E556Q/E1201Q) Pgps. The conformational changes in Pgp that accompany transport were studied within the framework of the progression of the Pgp-mediated ATPase reaction. This study thus provides a general strategy to more precisely identify the driving force for the mechanical (conformational) changes that bring about initial drug substrate movement within the bilayer. We estimated the activation energies for the formation of the nucleotide triphosphate-trapped (prehydrolysis) state using the mutant (E556Q/E1201Q) Pgp as well as the nucleotide diphosphate-trapped (posthydrolysis) state. These results were obtained both by photocross-linking the trapped nucleotide using 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP and by directly estimating the occluded [α-32P]ATP/ADP. Moreover, we also estimated the activation energy for the reduced binding of the transport substrate, [125I]iodoarylazidoprazosin ([125I]IAAP). Our results show that the conformational changes that transform the high affinity transport substrate binding site to a low affinity site occur during the formation of the Pgp·ATP (E·S) reaction intermediate of the ATPase catalytic cycle but not independent of ATP hydrolysis. Chemicals—[125I]IAAP (2,200 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 8-Azido-[α-32P]ATP (15-20 Ci/mmol), 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP (15-20 Ci/mmol), 8-azido-ATP, and 8-azido-ADP were purchased from Affinity Labeling Technologies, Inc. (Lexington, KY). The Pgp-specific monoclonal antibody C-219 was obtained from Fujirebio Diagnostics Inc. (Malvern, PA). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Preparation of Crude Membranes from High Five Insect Cells Infected with Recombinant Baculovirus Carrying the Wild-type and Mutant Human MDR1 Gene—High Five insect cells (Invitrogen) were infected with the recombinant baculovirus carrying the human MDR1 cDNA (either wild type or the mutant, E556Q/E1201Q) with a His6 tag at the C-terminal end as described (9Ramachandra M.

The crude membranes were solubilized with octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (1.25%) in the presence of 20% glycerol and a lipid mixture (0.1%). Solubilized proteins were subjected to metal affinity chromatography (Talon resin; Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) in the presence of 0.95% octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside and 0.04% lipid; 80% purified Pgp was eluted with 200 mm imidazole. Pgp in the 200 mm imidazole fraction was then concentrated (Centriprep-50; Amicon, Beverly, MA) to ∼0.5-1.5 mg/ml and stored at -70 °C. Pgp was identified by immunoblot analysis using the monoclonal antibody C219 and quantified by the Amido Black protein estimation method as previously described (23Kerr K.M. Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V.

Photocross-linking of 8-Azido[α-32P]ATP to Pgp—Crude membranes of High Five insect cells (50-100 μg of protein) or purified and reconstituted protein (5-10 μg of protein) were incubated in the ATPase assay buffer (50 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.8, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm sodium azide, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ouabain, and 10 mm MgCl2) containing 10 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (10 μCi/nmol) in the dark at 4 °C for 5 min. The samples were irradiated with a UV lamp assembly (PGC Scientific, Gaithersburg, MD) fitted with two black light (self-filtering) UV-A long wave F15T8BLB tubes (365 nm) for 10 min on ice (4 °C). Ice-cold ATP (10 mm) was added to displace excess noncovalently bound 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP. After SDS-PAGE on a 7% NuPAGE gel, the gels were dried and exposed to Bio-Max MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at -70 °C for 12-24 h.

The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 mm ice-cold ATP and placing the samples immediately on ice. The trapped nucleotides were photocross-linked and electrophoresed, and the radioactivity incorporated in the Pgp band was quantified as described (19Sauna Z.E. Smith M.M. Muller M. Ambudkar S.V. J.

Purified Pgp reconstituted into liposomes (25-50 μg of protein/ml) was incubated with 200 μm [α-32P]ATP for 20 min in the ATPase buffer (see above). Experiments were carried out in the absence and presence of Vi and 50 μm verapamil. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of ice-cold buffer containing 2.5% SDS, and 1-2 μl of this sample was spotted onto a cellulose/polyethyleneimine membrane. TLC was carried out using 1 m HCOOH and 0.5 m LiCl as a solvent. The [α-32P]ATP and [α-32P]ADP were identified by exposing the dried TLC to an x-ray film. The [α-32P]ATP and [α-32P]ADP spots were quantified using the STORM 860 PhosphorImager system (Amersham Biosciences) and the software ImageQuaNT. [α-32P]ATP or [α-32P]ADP Trapping—Purified wild type and E556Q/E1201Q mutant Pgps reconstituted into liposomes were incubated with 200 μm [α-32P]ATP for 5 min in the ATPase buffer (see above). The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of ice-cold buffer containing 1 m NaCl and 10 mm ATP. The sample was loaded onto a G-50 column (4 ml, diameter 1 cm) previously washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.2 m NaCl (Buffer A). The proteoliposomes were eluted with Buffer A, 0.25-ml fractions were collected, and the elution of protein was monitored by measuring the OD at 280 nm. The fractions with the protein were pooled, diluted to 4 ml with cold Buffer A, and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 15 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2.5% SDS. The amount of [α-32P]nucleotide and protein, respectively, were estimated in each sample. We used the stock solution of [α-32P]ATP to generate a standard curve, which was used to determine the concentration of occluded nucleotide. In each set of experiments, the purified and reconstituted wildtype Pgp was also incubated with [α-32P]ATP at 4 °C in the absence of Vi. This is the negative control, where no trapping of nucleotide occurs (e.g. see Fig. 1B). The radioactivity obtained under these conditions after removal of the free [α-32P]ATP (<0.5% of the signal obtained in the presence of Vi at 37 °C) was subtracted as background. The protein in each sample was estimated by the method of Schaffner and Weissmann (28Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar), which was specifically developed to accurately measure the concentration membrane proteins in the presence of lipid or detergent. In some experiments (indicated in the figure legends), 1-2 μl of the sample was spotted onto a cellulose/polyethyleneimine membrane. TLC was carried, and [α-32P]ATP and [α-32P]ADP were identified and quantified as described above. Use of Photoaffinity Probes in Determining Kinetic and Thermodynamic Parameters—Our use of photoaffinity analogs has been criticized (29Qu Q. Chu J.W.K. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) on the grounds that these measurements are not carried out under equilibrium conditions. To allay these concerns, we have estimated the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters using both the photoaffinity analog 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP and, under equilibrium conditions, [α-32P]ATP. [125I]IAAP, a transport substrate of Pgp, which is also a photoaffinity reagent, has also been used in these studies in a manner that recognizes the concerns associated with photoaffinity probes. [125I]IAAP is used to understand the “coupling” between the ATP sites and the drug substrate site. [125I]IAAP is used as a reporter molecule to monitor the state of the transport substrate site when the Pgp molecule has been trapped at different steps of the ATPase reaction. Thus, the actual titrations either thermal or kinetic were carried out under equilibrium conditions using the physiological substrate, ATP. These perturbations either do or do not result in conformational changes at the transport substrate site. In an enzymatic reaction, for example, such conformational changes may result in a product that can be measured very often by a chemical reaction. Similarly, in our assay, we allow the Pgp to be trapped in a stable, long lived ternary complex under equilibrium conditions and use [125I]IAAP only to report on the conformational change at the transport substrate site. The temperature range (4-34 °C) used for the thermal titration had no effect on the photocross-linking reaction itself (see supplemental Fig. S1). Estimating the Activation Energy for the Formation of Reaction Intermediates—The activation energy (Eact) for an enzymatic reaction is calculated from the slope of an Arrhenius plot, reciprocal of the absolute temperature versus log activity. Formation of the Pgp·ATP (in the mutant Pgp) or Pgp·ADP·Vi (in the wild-type Pgp) reaction intermediates is a slow process that occurs over several minutes (20Sauna Z.E. Muller M. Peng X.H. Ambudkar S.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13989-14000Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Tombline G. Bartholomew L.A. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12879-12886Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Moreover, we show that in the temperature range 10-34 °C, the trapping reaction is linear for at least 5 min (e.g. see Fig. S2 and Ref. 22Tombline G. Bartholomew L.A. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31212-31220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The trapping reactions depicted in this study were allowed to proceed for exactly 5 min, and the radioactivity of the trapped nucleotide in each sample as well as the protein at the end of the reaction was determined (28Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). Since all experiments were carried out using purified Pgp reconstituted into proteoliposomes, these measurements allowed us to express the extent of trapping as a rate measurement (viz. pmol nucleotide occluded/mg of Pgp/min). These values were used in generating the Arrhenius plots from which the Eact values in Table 1 were calculated. The procedure adopted to estimate the Eact value for nucleotide occlusion was essentially similar to that adopted by van der Does et al. (31van der Does C. Presenti C. Schulze K. Dinkelaker S.

https://openalex.org/W2019455863,"Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders associated with conformational conversion of the cellular prion protein, PrPC, into a misfolded, protease-resistant form, PrPSc. Here we show, for the first time, the oligomerization and fibrillization of the C-terminal domain of murine PrP, mPrP-(121–231), which lacks the entire unstructured N-terminal domain of the protein. In particular, the construct we used lacks amino acid residues 106–120 from the so-called amyloidogenic core of PrP (residues 106–126). Amyloid formation was accompanied by acquisition of resistance to proteinase K digestion. Aggregation of mPrP-(121–231) was investigated using a combination of biophysical and biochemical techniques at pH 4.0, 5.5, and 7.0 and at 37 and 65 °C. Under partially denaturing conditions (65 °C), aggregates of different morphologies ranging from soluble oligomers to mature amyloid fibrils of mPrP-(121–231) were formed. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that roughly spherical aggregates were readily formed when the protein was incubated at pH 5.5 and 65 °C for 1 h, whereas prolonged incubation led to the formation of mature amyloid fibrils. Samples incubated at 65 °C at pH 4.0 or 7.0 presented an initial mixture of oligomers and protofibrils or fibrils. Electrophoretic analysis of samples incubated at 65 °C revealed formation of sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant oligomers (dimers, trimers, and tetramers) and higher molecular weight aggregates of mPrP-(121–231). These results demonstrate that formation of an amyloid form with physical properties of PrPSc can be achieved in the absence of the flexible N-terminal domain and, in particular, of residues 106–120 of PrP and does not require other cellular factors or a PrPSc template.

The conformational conversion of the normal cellular isoform of the prion protein, PrPC, 4The abbreviations used are: PrPC, cellular isoform of the prion protein; PrPSc, pathogenic or scrapie isoform of the prion protein; PK, proteinase K; mPrP-(121–231), recombinant murine PrP comprising residues 121–231; ThT, thioflavin T; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.4The abbreviations used are: PrPC, cellular isoform of the prion protein; PrPSc, pathogenic or scrapie isoform of the prion protein; PK, proteinase K; mPrP-(121–231), recombinant murine PrP comprising residues 121–231; ThT, thioflavin T; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. into an abnormal pathological isoform, PrPSc, underlies a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies or prion diseases, which includes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, scrapie in sheep and goats, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5052) Google Scholar). Neuropathologically, prion diseases are characterized by neuronal loss and astrogliosis and often by spongiform degeneration of the brain and deposition of amyloid plaques (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5052) Google Scholar). The unique feature of these diseases is that, in addition to sporadic and inherited forms, they may be acquired by transmission of an infectious agent. The “proteinonly” hypothesis of prion propagation postulates that the abnormal isoform, PrPSc, acts as a transmissible agent of the disease and self-propagates its pathological conformation using PrPC as a substrate (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5052) Google Scholar). PrPSc is defined as an aggregated form of PrP that is largely resistant to proteinase K (PK) digestion under conditions in which PrPC and most other proteins are readily degraded (2Weissmann C. Cell. 2005; 122: 165-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition to their different stabilities to proteolytic degradation, the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of PrPC and PrPSc also differ (3Caughey B.W. Dong A. Bhat K.S. Ernst D.

Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Crossref PubMed Scopus (2049) Google Scholar), whereas PrPSc adopts a multimeric arrangement and contains a large amount of β-structure and less helical structure. The transition between PrPC and PrPSc occurs by a post-translational mechanism and appears to take place without any detectable covalent modification of the protein (8Stahl N. Baldwin M.A. Teplow D.B. Hood L. Gibson B.W. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1991-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). To date, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the conformational transition between the normal and pathogenic conformers of PrP remain poorly defined. According to current models, the conformation of the prion protein fluctuates between a dominant native state, PrPC, and a series of minor conformers that self-associate in an ordered manner to produce a stable supramolecular structure, PrPSc, composed of misfolded PrP monomers (2Weissmann C. Cell. 2005; 122: 165-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 9Ferreira S.T. De Felice F.G.

Once a stable “seed” structure is formed, additional PrP molecules can then be recruited, leading to an autocatalytic, fast formation of PrPSc (2Weissmann C. Cell. 2005; 122: 165-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 10Aguzzi A. Polymenidou M.

A. 1993; 90: 5959-5963Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Amyloid aggregation plays important roles in several other human pathologies, including Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntington diseases. Regardless of the different amino acid sequences of the proteins or peptides from which they are formed, protein amyloids show many common physical and tinctorial properties (12Dobson C.M. Protein Pept. Lett. 2006; 13: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have shown that partially denaturing conditions are required for the in vitro formation of amyloid, which can be attributed to the necessity of destabilizing the native fold of a protein under conditions in which non-covalent interactions involving the polypeptide chain remain favorable (for reviews, see Ref. 12Dobson C.M. Protein Pept. Lett. 2006; 13: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In this context, use of partially denaturing in vitro conditions should be viewed as a tool to populate aggregation-prone conformations and to accelerate a process that might normally take much longer in vivo. Such studies may lead to improved understanding of the mechanisms of amyloid formation and to the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing the formation of amyloid and combating amyloid diseases. Considerable evidence now indicates that the main neurotoxic species involved in neuronal damage in Alzheimer, Parkinson, and prion diseases are soluble amyloid oligomers rather than the mature fibrils that are found in amyloid deposits in vivo (for reviews, see Refs. 13Klein W.L. Stine Jr., W.B. Teplow D.B. Neurobiol. Aging. 2004; 25: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 14Walsh D.M. Selkoe D.J.

Neurosci. 2003; 26: 267-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). This likely explains the lack of direct correlation between amyloid plaque burden and neurodegeneration observed in prion diseases (for a review, see Ref. 16Chiesa R. Harris D.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 743-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and suggests that neurotoxic soluble oligomers may play a role in prion-induced neuronal dysfunction. The three-dimensional structures of recombinant prion proteins from a number of different organisms, including mouse, hamster, and human PrP, have revealed that the entire N-terminal segment comprising amino acid residues 23–120 is flexibly disordered and that only the segment containing the C-terminal 111 residues, PrP-(121–231), possesses a defined three-dimensional structure (17Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 18Donne D.G. Viles J.H. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. James T.L. Cohen F.E.

Nature. 1996; 382: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). The N-terminal flexible region appears to play an important role in transmissible spongiform encephalopathy transmission and influences the formation of proteinase-resistant conformations of PrP (e.g. Ref. 21Lawson V.A. Priola S.A. Meade-White K. Lawson M. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13689-13695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain also contains amino acid sequences that are generally considered important in the control of aggregation (e.g. residues 94–113; Ref. 21Lawson V.A. Priola S.A. Meade-White K. Lawson M. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13689-13695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and the so-called amyloidogenic core consisting of the neurotoxic peptide sequence 106–126. The C-terminal region is a well structured, self-folding domain and contains three α-helices and a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (19Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 20Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Billeter M. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K. Nature. 1996; 382: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). In the present work, we describe the oligomerization and fibrillization of the C-terminal domain of the murine prion protein, mPrP-(121–231). This construct lacks the entire N-terminal flexible region and most of the amino acid residues from the 106–126 amyloidogenic core of PrP. We show that various types of aggregates, including SDS-resistant oligomers and mature amyloid fibrils, are formed upon incubation of mPrP-(121–231) under different partially denaturing conditions. Formation of oligomers was optimal at pH 5.5, and some of the species formed exhibited annular morphology. Interestingly, aggregation of mPrP-(121–231) at pH 7.0 gave rise to the formation of an amyloid aggregate that was resistant to proteinase K digestion, suggesting that it exhibits properties similar to PrPSc. Possible implications of the formation of PrP oligomers to the pathogenesis of prion diseases are discussed. Materials—Thioflavin T (ThT) and proteinase K were from Sigma. Uranyl acetate was from Electron Microscopy Sciences (Fort Washington, PA). All other reagents were of the highest analytical grade commercially available. Protein Expression and Purification—The plasmid for bacterial expression of F175W variant of murine PrP-(121–231) was a generous gift from Dr. R. Glockshuber (Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, Switzerland). The recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and was purified as described previously (25Nandi P.K. Leclerc E. Nicole J.C. Takahashi M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). After the final step of purification, mPrP-(121–231) was dialyzed against MilliQ water and concentrated using an Amicon ultrafiltration stirred cell (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA), and its concentration was determined using ϵ280 = 28,800 M–1 cm–1 (22Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3258-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Protein aliquots (1.0–2.0 mg/ml) were stored at –20 °C until use. PrP Aggregation—The concentration of mPrP-(121–231) in all samples was 0.8 mg/ml (60 μm), and 0.02% NaN3 was added to prevent bacterial growth during long incubation periods. Samples were incubated for increasing time intervals at different temperatures and pH values as described in “Results.” When buffered solutions were used, the pH of the samples was adjusted with 80 mm acetic acid·NaOH (pH 4.0), 80 mm Mes·NaOH (pH 5.5), or 80 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.0). In experiments in which aggregation was investigated in low ionic strength conditions (unbuffered solutions), samples were prepared by addition of an aliquot from the stock mPrP solution to MilliQ water, the pH of which had been previously adjusted to the desired value with HCl. After 1 week of incubation, the pH of such unbuffered solutions changed from 5.5 and 7.0 to 6.2 and 7.4, respectively. Turbidity and Light Scattering Measurements—Protein aggregation was monitored at 25 °C by turbidimetry (optical density at 330 nm) on an Ultrospec 2000 Pharmacia spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare) and by right-angle light scattering measurements at 500 nm on an ISS PC1 spectrofluorometer (ISS Inc., Champaign, IL). Pre-aggregated samples were diluted 10× before measurements. ThT Fluorescence Measurements—PrP samples were incubated with an equimolar concentration of ThT for 30 min at room temperature before measurements. ThT fluorescence emission spectra (excitation at 440 nm, emission from 460 to 600 nm, 5 nm bandpasses for both excitation and emission) were measured at 25 °C on an F4500 Hitachi spectrofluorometer (Hitachi Instrument Co., Tokyo, Japan). ThT exhibits very little fluorescence in aqueous buffer, and its fluorescence is greatly enhanced upon binding to amyloid fibrils (23Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). The increase in fluorescence upon binding thus may be used to follow the kinetics of amyloid fibril formation. Relative ThT fluorescence intensities in different pH buffers are normalized by the values measured for control mPrP-(121–231) samples that were kept at 4 °C for 1 week at the corresponding pHs. Intrinsic Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence emission spectra were measured at 25 °C on an ISS PC1 spectrofluorometer with excitation at 280 nm, emission from 300 to 420 nm, using a Schott WG 320 filter on the emission channel and 4 nm bandpasses for excitation and emission. Gel Electrophoresis—Samples withdrawn at different time points during the aggregation of mPrP-(121–231) were analyzed by PAGE under both native (12% acrylamide) and denaturing (18% acrylamide) conditions. For native PAGE, samples were diluted in nondenaturing loading buffer. Prior to SDS-PAGE, samples were boiled for 2 min in loading buffer containing 2% SDS and 140 mm dithiothreitol. Carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), albumin (66 kDa), and Na,K-ATPase (α-subunit, 100 kDa) or a prestained molecular weight marker set (Pierce) were used as standards to determine the molecular masses of PrP oligomers and higher order aggregates. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Samples were adsorbed for 2 min onto formwar-carbon-coated grids that had been pretreated with 0.01% aqueous poly-l-lysine. Samples were stained with 5 μl of 2% uranyl acetate, air-dried and observed on a 902 Zeiss electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Proteinase K Digestion—Samples of either monomeric or aggregated mPrP-(121–231) (formed upon aggregation of 0.8 mg/ml mPrP-(121–231) at pH 7.0 and 65 °C for 1 week) were 4-fold diluted and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, with proteinase K at the protease:PrP ratios indicated in “Results.” Digestion was stopped by addition of 5×-concentrated SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer containing 2% SDS and 140 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and resolved in 18% SDS-PAGE gels. Temperature and pH Effects on the Aggregation of mPrP-(121–231)—To identify experimental conditions leading to the oligomerization or fibrillization of mPrP-(121–231), we initially monitored the aggregation of the protein at both pH 5.5 and 7.0 and at 37 and 65 °C. The experiments at pH 5.5 were carried out to approximate the pH in endocytic vesicles, which have been implicated as a possible intracellular compartment in which the conformational transition of PrPc to PrPSc may take place (4Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18217-18223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Prusiner S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16188-16199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, comparison between aggregation at 37 and 65 °C was motivated by the fact that the Tm for thermal denaturation of mPrP-(121–231) is ∼65 °C (25–27), which should populate a partially denatured state of the protein that might be more prone to aggregation. Initial experiments with samples incubated at 37 °C in unbuffered media for as long as 1 week at either pH showed no significant aggregation. By contrast, aggregation was markedly enhanced at 65 °C (supplemental Fig. S1). Interestingly, whereas turbidity measurements indicated that formation of mPrP aggregates was essentially complete within a few hours at 65 °C (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B), ThT binding assays showed that substantial amounts of amyloid material were only formed after much longer incubation times (i.e. several days; supplemental Fig. S1, C and D). This indicates that the aggregates initially formed slowly converted to amyloid structures with longer incubation times. mPrP-(121–231) has been reported to adopt an alternative β-sheet conformation below pH 5 in the presence of urea (28Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6010-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate aggregation at pH 4 in the absence of chemical denaturants using buffered solutions. Initial investigation of the temperature dependence of aggregation in buffered media at pH 5.5 and 7 showed that aggregation increased slightly from 37 to 59 °C, followed by a marked increase at 65 °C (supplemental Fig. S2). Based on these results, we next carried out a detailed investigation of the aggregation of mPrP-(121–231) at both 37 and 65 °C. Fig. 1 (A–C) shows the aggregation of mPrP-(121–231) monitored by turbiditimetry. Aggregation at both pH 5.5 and 7.0 was enhanced at 65 °C, with maximal aggregation achieved in as little as 2 min. We note that incubation at 65 °C did not stimulate the aggregation of mPrP-(121–231) at pH 4.0 (A). This is in apparent contradiction with previous works that showed that low pH is more effective when used in conjunction with partial denaturation by urea (e.g. Ref. 28Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6010-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). It is well known, however, that different chemical (e.g. urea, guanidine) or physical denaturing agents (e.g. temperature, pressure) may lead to different denatured or partially denatured ensembles. It is likely, therefore, that the partially denatured states of mPrP stabilized by urea or by elevated temperatures are different in their residual structures and in their propensities to form amyloid aggregates. It is also possible that the partially denatured conformation of mPrP stabilized at pH 4 and 65 °C exhibits slower aggregation kinetics (as supported by ThT binding results described below). At 37 °C, incubation of mPrP-(121–231) for up to 1 week at either pH 4.0 (Fig. 1D) or pH 7.0 (Fig. 1F) did not result in fibrillization as measured by ThT binding. On the other hand, samples incubated for 1 week at pH 5.5 at 37 °C (E) exhibited ∼4-fold increase in ThT binding, indicating the formation of some amyloid structure under these conditions. At 65 °C, samples incubated at pH 4.0 (D) exhibited increasing ThT binding as a function of time. At pH 7.0 and 65 °C, ThT fluorescence measurements suggested that amyloid aggregates of mPrP-(121–231) were readily formed within the first hour of incubation (Fig. 1F). Light scattering measurements indicated that incubation of mPrP-(121–231) at pH 4.0 and 65 °C for 1 week (Fig. 1G) resulted in noticeable aggregation (compatible with ThT results). Samples incubated at pH 5.5 at 65 °C (H) exhibited increasing aggregation as a function of time as monitored by light scattering. In line with the turbidity measurements, at pH 7 light scattering measurements showed that incubation at 65 °C led to very rapid aggregation of mPrP (I). Aggregation of mPrP was also monitored by its intrinsic fluorescence emission. The mPrP construct we have utilized exhibits a 2.5-fold increase in intrinsic fluorescence upon unfolding (29Wildegger G. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). At 37 °C, incubation of mPrP-(121–231) for up to 1 week at all pH values investigated revealed no significant changes in intrinsic fluorescence, indicating preservation of the native fold of the protein. By contrast, samples incubated at 65 °C exhibited significant fluorescence increases, indicating unfolding of the protein within the first few hours of incubation (Fig. 1, J–L). The intrinsic fluorescence intensities of mPrP-(121–231) were higher within the first few hours of incubation at 65 °C and decreased progressively over time to values approaching those of control samples. This suggests that incubation of mPrP at 65 °C leads to initial (partial) unfolding of the protein and that, upon formation of amyloid aggregates, mPrP assumes a more compact conformation again and/or becomes part of some organized structure in which Trp-175 becomes shielded from the solvent. Oligomers and Higher Order mPrP Aggregates Revealed by Native and Denaturing Gel Electrophoresis—Native PAGE showed that samples incubated at 65 °C were fully converted within the first few hours into high molecular weight aggregates that did not enter the running gel (supplemental Fig. S3), whereas samples incubated at 37 °C remained monomeric for up to 1 week of incubation. Formation of aggregates of mPrP-(121–231) was further investigated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). Samples incubated at 65 °C showed progressive accumulation of SDS-resistant oligomers (dimers, trimers, and tetramers) and higher molecular weight aggregates at all pH values investigated. Prolonged incubation at 65 °C also led to the appearance of low molecular mass bands (<13 kDa), which likely correspond to proteolysis products of mPrP-(121–231). It is interesting to note that even these lower molecular mass fragments of mPrP appeared to undergo aggregation at 65 °C, giving rise to faint bands between the monomer/dimer and dimer/trimer bands. Ultrastructural Analysis of mPrP Aggregates—The morphologies of aggregates formed under different experimental conditions were examined by transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 3). Inspection of a large number of negatively stained control samples (i.e. samples kept at 4 °C for up to 1 week at different pH values) showed absence of oligomeric or polymeric structures (data not shown). Samples incubated for up to 1 week at 37 °C also showed absence of aggregated material (data not shown). Samples incubated for as little as 1 h at pH 5.5 and 65 °C in unbuffered solution exhibited large numbers of roughly spherical aggregates with average diameter of ∼12 nm (with larger particles with diameters reaching up to ∼30 nm; Fig. 3A). It is also interesting to note that some of the aggregates exhibited distinct annular structures (Fig. 3A, inset), reminiscent of the morphologies exhibited by aggregates of α-synuclein, amylin, and serum amyloid A (30Quist A. Doudevski I. Lin H. Azimova R. Ng D. Frangione B. Kagan B. Ghiso J. Ratnesh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10427-10432Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Longer incubation times at pH 5.5 led to the disappearance of the spherical aggregates and to the appearance of mature amyloid fibrils with diameters of ∼15–30 nm (Fig. 3B). mPrP-(121–231) samples incubated for 1 h at 65 °C and pH 7.0 in unbuffered solution showed abundant oligomers and some short protofibrillar structures (Fig. 3C). Longer incubation times under these conditions led to a decrease in the number of oligomers and to the appearance of mature amyloid fibrils with diameters of ∼10–20 nm (Fig. 3D). Incubation for 1 h at 65°C and pH 4.0 in buffered medium produced relatively few oligomers and rare small protofibrillar structures (Fig. 3E), although in few images acquired under this condition it was also possible to see occasional larger protofibrils (data not shown). Intriguingly, longer incubation (1 week) at 65 °C and pH 4.0 did not lead to the formation of mature amyloid fibrils but rather to the accumulation of clustered aggregates resembling beads on a string (Fig. 3F). Although these aggregates are morphologically different from mature amyloid fibrils, they appeared to bind some ThT as well (Fig. 1D). Samples incubated for 1 h at 65 °C and pH 5.5 in buffered medium exhibited a mixture of abundant roughly spherical aggregates (with diameters of ∼25 nm) and protofibrillar structures (Fig. 3G). Longer incubation times led to the disappearance of the globular aggregates and the appearance of large numbers of amyloid fibrils that meshed together (Fig. 3H). Finally, incubation for as little as 1 h at 65 °C and pH 7.0 in buffered medium produced bundles of twisted amyloid fibrils (Fig. 3I). Longer incubation times led to accumulation of mature amyloid fibrils with average diameters of 10–20 nm along with roughly spherical structures ∼30 nm in diameter (Fig. 3J). Protease Resistance of Aggregated mPrP—Proteinase K digestion has been widely used to distinguish between protease-resistant PrPSc and protease-labile PrPC conformations of the prion protein as well as to probe differences between PrPSc strains (31Bessen R.A.

Treatment of native mPrP-(121–231) with proteinase K resulted in complete degradation of the protein even at very low protease:PrP ratios (Fig. 4, upper panel). By contrast, aggregation for 1 week at 65 °C and pH 7.0 was accompanied by a significant increase in resistance to proteinase K digestion (Fig. 4, lower panel). The construct used in the present work corresponds to the structured 111-residue C-terminal domain of the murine cellular prion protein and lacks the entire flexible N-terminal region, which has been implicated in transmissible spongiform encephalopathy transmission and in the formation of protease-resistant aggregates (21Lawson V.A.

The 100-kDa “a” subunit is encoded by four isoforms (a1–a4) in mammals and two (Vph1p and Stv1p) in yeast. a3 is enriched in osteoclasts and is essential for bone resorption, whereas a4 is expressed in the distal nephron and acidifies urine. Mutations in human a3 and a4 result in osteopetrosis and distal renal tubular acidosis, respectively. Human a3 (G405R and R444L) and a4 (P524L and G820R) mutations were recreated in the yeast ortholog Vph1p, a3 (G424R and R462L), and a4 (W520L and G812R). Mutations in a3 resulted in wild type vacuolar acidification and growth on media containing 4 mm ZnCl2, 200 mm CaCl2, or buffered to pH 7.5 with V-ATPase hydrolytic and pumping activity decreased by 30–35%. Immunoblots confirmed wild type levels for V-ATPase a, A, and B subunits on vacuolar membranes. a4 G812R resulted in defective growth on selective media with V-ATPase hydrolytic and pumping activity decreased by 83–85% yet with wild type levels of a, A, and B subunits on vacuolar membranes. The a4 W520L mutation had defective growth on selective media with no detectable V-ATPase activity and reduced expression of a, A, and B subunits. The a4 W520L mutation phenotypes were dominant negative, as overexpression of wild type yeast a isoforms, Vph1p, or Stv1p, did not restore growth. However, deletion of endoplasmic reticulum assembly factors (Vma12p, Vma21p, and Vma22p) partially restored a and B expression. That a4 W520L affects both Vo and V1 subunits is a unique phenotype for any V-ATPase subunit mutation and supports the concerted pathway for V-ATPase assembly in vivo.

The bone disease osteopetrosis demonstrates the essential function of V-ATPases in bone resorption. The osteopetroses are a group of heritable conditions characterized by defects in osteoclast bone resorption. Osteoclasts resorb bone by first creating a sealed zone, the resorption lacuna, between the osteoclast ruffled border membrane and the bone surface. The process of V-ATPase-mediated proton transport into resorption lacunae (41Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Ghiselli R. Gluck S.

The importance of V-ATPase in renal proton secretion is highlighted by inherited dRTA. V-ATPases in the plasma membranes of renal intercalated cells of the distal nephron pump protons from the blood into the urine, an essential step in the removal of metabolic acid. dRTA is characterized by impaired renal acid secretion, resulting in metabolic acidosis. Autosomal recessive dRTA involves mutations to the a4 or the B1 subunit isoforms of V-ATPase.

The majority of these mutations result in frameshifts, abnormal splicing, and insertion of stop codons and as such are uninformative, except to further illustrate the essential roles of a3 and a4. However, missense and small deletion mutations were identified that could pinpoint critical domains. Two missense mutations, G405R and R444L, were identified in the V-ATPase a3 subunit isoform that account for all the defects in nine unrelated families in Costa Rica (36Sobacchi C. Frattini A. Orchard P. Porras O. Tezcan I. Andolina M. Babul-Hirji R. Baric I. Canham N. Chitayat D. Dupuis-Girod S. Ellis I. Etzioni A. Fasth A. Fisher A. Gerritsen B. Gulino V. Horwitz E. Klamroth V. Lanino E.

We have recreated these a3 mutations in the yeast a subunit ortholog, Vph1p, as G424R and R462L. Of the 21 a4 mutations, only three were missense mutations. We recreated two of them, P524L and G820R, in Vph1p as W520L and G812R. Characterizing the effect of these missense mutations can identify critical domains within a3 and a4 that are essential for assembly, targeting, or retention and retrieval of V-ATPases to and from the plasma membrane. Technically, it is difficult to characterize these mutations in humans. The only biochemical information is from fibroblast and lymphoblast cell lines from patients with frameshift and abnormal splicing mutations, and those studies confirm the expected null phenotype (37Kornak U.

Yeast V-ATPases are an attractive model for the study of the biochemistry of a3 and a4 mutations because the a subunit is remarkably conserved across species. The subunit sequences of human a3 and a4 isoforms have ∼55% similarity to the yeast ortholog, Vph1p. Characterizing the mechanistic outcome of a3 and a4 mutations in yeast could reveal critical amino acids involved in V-ATPase assembly, targeting, or activity. Here we have recreated four missense mutations, two from a3 and two from a4 mutations in the yeast Vph1p subunit, and report on their respective V-ATPase assembly and activity phenotypes.

RLF and relaxin share features of the secondary structure to the extent that relaxin cross-reacts with the LGR8, the RLF receptor. Although both hormones interact with their receptors essentially via the B chain, the sharply defined binding cassette of relaxin is not present in RLF. Structure and function analysis of RLF derivatives with single amino acid replacements revealed that the most important binding residues are tryptophan B27, followed by arginine B16 and valine B19. Single alanine replacements for each individual position resulted in a relative receptor affinity of 4.0% (B16), 6.1% (B19), and 0.5% (B27). Tryptophan B27 is located on an extended structure, and arginine B16 and valine B19 are positioned on the exposed surface of the B chain helix. The 3 residues could be brought together to form a contiguous binding area if the C-terminal end of the B chain were free to fold back against the central portion of the B chain helix. Such a movement depends critically on the flexibility of the C-terminal end, which is controlled by positions B23–25. In as much as these major binding residues seem hardly sufficient to explain the strong binding of RLF to LGR8 we searched for and found an extended region where little contributions by individual residues added up to a strong receptor affinity. This mode of interaction could drive the binding energy sufficiently high to account for the picomolar binding constant of RLF and its receptor.

Chem. 2005; 280: 14586-14590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) has provided the opportunity to investigate several aspects of the role of RLF in gonadal migration. This research led to the potentially important discovery of a signal activation site in RLF that does not overlap the RLF binding site. The modified RLF is a potent, highly specific inhibitor of RLF action (12Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14586-14590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although it is clear from our investigations that modifications of the signaling site do not interfere with LGR8 binding, the site or region of RLF that is responsible for a nanomolar binding constant is not known. Native RLF, isolated from bovine testes, is a polypeptide hormone in which a 26-residue A chain is linked by two interchain disulfide bonds to a 41-residue B chain and an intrachain cystine bond in the A chain (13Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicated that RLF can be shortened at the C terminus of the B chain up to residue 27 without losing its potency if the C terminus is amidated (11Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8021-8028Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Receptor binding is retained even after additional removal of 6 amino acids from the N terminus of the A chain and 5 residues from the N terminus of the B chain (12Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14586-14590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Consequently the binding site of RLF to LGR8 is located in the disulfide cross-linked 36-amino acid residue containing segment A10–26/B6–27-amide. In this study we are reporting experiments that provide evidence for a 5-amino acid region of strong receptor binding that is augmented by three more prominent interaction sites to produce the observed affinity constant for the LGR8 and its ligand. Materials—The LGR8, cloned into the pcDNA3.1.zeo plasmid, was a gift from Dr. Hsueh, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Stanford University School of Medicine. The human embryo kidney cell line 293T/17 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL-11286) and used for LGR8 expression. Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) amino acid derivatives were purchased from either Advanced ChemTech, Louisville, KY or NovaBiochem, San Diego, CA. Reagents and solvents for peptide synthesis were obtained from Advanced ChemTech. Peptide Synthesis—RLF chains were synthesized by a combination of automated peptide synthesis (model 433A; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and site-directed sequential disulfide bond formation. Syntheses were performed using the Wang resin (14Wang S.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973; 95: 1328-1333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with trifluoroacetic acid-labile side chain-protecting groups for all trifunctional amino acids but methionine in position B5, which was used as sulfoxide, cysteines in positions A11 and B10, which were acetamidomethyl protected, and cysteine A24, which carried a tertiary butyl-protecting group. O-Benzotriazol-N,N,N′, N′-tetramethyluronium-tetrafluoroborate served as carboxyl group-activating agent (15Knorr R. Trzeciak A. Bannwarth W. Gillessen D. Tetrahedron Lett. 1989; 30: 1927-1930Crossref Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Polypeptide chains were deprotected and released from the resin with a freshly prepared mixture of trifluoroacetic acid/water/ethanedithiol/thioanisole/phenol (100/5/2.5/5/7.5) (v/v/v/v/w) for 2 h at room temperature (16King D.S. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 36: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). The resin was filtered off and the peptide precipitated with ice-cold diethylether. The pellet collected by centrifugation was washed two times with diethylether, air dried, and lyophilized as an aqueous suspension. Each RLF chain was purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Rainin C18 column (41.4 × 250 mm), using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 83% acetonitrile (solvent B) at a flow rate of 40 ml/min. The peptide was eluted using a 30-min linear gradient and detected by UV absorbance of the effluent. Fractions containing the pure peptides were pooled and lyophilized. The strategic distribution of the cysteine-protecting groups was essential for the stepwise synthesis of the three disulfide bonds. In the A chain, cysteines A10 and A15, after deprotection by trifluoroacetic acid treatment, were oxidized by titration with iodine in 50% acetic acid (peptide concentration, 10 mg/ml). Excess iodine was immediately reduced with 1 m ascorbic acid in water. The reaction mixture was diluted with water to reduce the acetic acid concentration to <20% and purified by preparative HPLC. Cysteine (tert-butyl) (A24) was converted to the 2-pyridylsulfenyl derivative (17Maruyama K. Nagata K. Tanaka M. Nagasawa H. Isogai A. Ishizaki H. Suzuki A. J. Protein Chem. 1992; 11: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) by dissolving the protected A chain (17 μmol) and 2,2′ dipyridyl disulfide (Aldrich) (240 μmol) in 900 μl of trifluoroacetic acid. The solution was chilled on ice, and thioanisole (100 μl) and 1 ml of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid in trifluoroacetic acid (1:4 v/v) were added. After 30 min at 0 °C the A chain was precipitated with chilled diethylether and the pellet collected by centrifugation, washed three times with 10 ml of diethylether, and air dried. The RLF A chain derivative was dissolved in 1 m acetic acid and desalted on Sephadex G25 sf in 1 m acetic acid and lyophilized. The interchain disulfide bonds were established first by reacting the thiol-activated A chain with the B22 monothiol B chain, followed by oxidative removal of the acetamidomethyl-protecting groups in cysteines A11 and B10 (8Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and by methionine sulfoxide reduction as reported before (18Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10754-10761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The various RLF analogs were characterized by several HPLC systems as follows. System 1: ∼10–20 μg of peptide was loaded onto a Baker-bond wide pore C18 column (4.1 × 250 mm). The peptide was eluted with a 30-min linear gradient from 20 to 60% B at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The UV absorbance of the effluent was recorded at 220 nm. System 2: An Aquapore 300 column (C8, 1.2 × 30 mm) was used in combination with an ABI HPLC model 130A. ∼1 μgof peptide was loaded and eluted with a 60-min linear gradient from 20 to 45% B at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. The UV absorbance of the effluent was recorded at 230 nm. In a parallel experiment the peptide was reduced prior to separation with 25 mm dithiothreitol in 3 m guanidinium chloride in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.6, for 30 min at 37 °C. Amino Acid Composition—Peptides were hydrolyzed in vapor phase 6 m HCl containing 1% phenol. Amino acids were modified with phenylisothiocyanate and separated by HPLC, using the Waters Pico·Tag system. Enzymatic Digest—RLF analogs (5 μg) were dissolved in 10 μl of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and digested with staphylococcal protease V8 (E:S 1:10) for 16 h at 25 °C (19Drapeau G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) followed by trypsin (E:S 1:20) for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched by addition of 50 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS)—MALDI-MS was performed at the mass spectrometry facility at the Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston. The RLF analog (1 μg), dissolved in 1 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, or 1 μl of the enzymatic digest was mixed with 3 μlof α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (50 mm in acetonitrile/water 4:1 v/v), and 1 μl was spotted on a sample plate. Mass spectra were acquired on an Applied Biosystems (ABI) Voyager DE-STR instrument in the linear mode. CD Spectroscopy—RLF derivatives (∼0.5 mg/ml) were dissolved in water and the protein content determined by UV spectroscopy, using calculated absorbance coefficients. An aliquot of 25 μg of RLF analog was diluted to 300 μl with a Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5; 25 mm final concentration) for spectroscopic analysis. A Jasco J710 spectropolarimeter was used to acquire far UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra at a resolution of 0.2 nm and a bandwidth of 2 nm. A cell of 0.1-cm pathlength was used, and 10 spectra were averaged. Molar ellipticity was calculated according to the literature (20Adler A.J. Greenfield N.J. Fasman G.D. Methods Enzymol. 1973; 27: 675-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Stable cell cultures (293T/17), transfected with LGR8-pcDNA3.1.zeo, were established using TransFast transfection reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The selected clone expressed 8600 receptors/cell and was used between passage 20 and 45. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA), 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 400 μg/ml zeocin (Invivogen, San Diego, CA) in a water-saturated atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen) and 107 cells used to seed a 75-cm2 culture flask. Receptor Binding Assay—Transfected 293T/17 cells were grown to 80% confluence and then dislodged with 0.5 m EDTA, pH 7.5, (1 ml/10 ml of conditioned medium) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min, suspended two times in 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mg/ml lysine, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.01% NaN3), and recentrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 2000 × g. The pellet was reconstituted to 25 × 106 cells/ml of binding buffer. For binding assays 0.025 pmol (100,000 cpm) of A125I-Tyr-9 hRLF (21Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22354-22358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in 20 μl of binding buffer was placed into a 1.5-ml Eppendorf vial together with 40 μl of binding buffer with or without human RLF or human RLF derivative and 40 μl (106 cells) of the cell suspension and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. Thereafter, the cells were diluted with 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer and collected by centrifugation (10 min at 2000 × g at 4 °C), and the pellet was washed with 1 ml of the same buffer and centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 × g at 4 °C. The tips of the vials containing the pellets were placed in counting tubes and transferred to a γ counter for analysis. Total binding was determined in the absence and nonspecific binding in the presence of 32 pmol unlabeled RLF. In a regular assay total binding was ∼50,000 cpm and nonspecific binding amounted to <5% of the total binding. Data points were collected in duplicates, and the data of three independent binding assays were pooled and presented as mean (±S.D.). Cyclic AMP Assay—LGR8–293T/17 stably transfected with the LGR8 message were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates at a density of 250,000 cells/well and grown in 500 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%) and antibiotics. Twenty-four hours later the conditioned medium was replaced by 100 μl of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (5 mm) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Following incubation of the cells for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 100 μl of hormone dilution prepared in the same buffer was added. The cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2/air for 16 h. Thereafter the plates were moved into a–80 °C freezer and kept there for at least 6 h. Prior to the assay, 20 μlof0.5 m EDTA was added to each well, the plate was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, and the content transferred into 1.5-ml bullet tubes and heated to >90 °C for 10 min in a water bath. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (100 μl) was treated with acetic anhydride and the 2′-O-acyl-cAMP concentration determined by radioimmunoassay, using [125I]succinyl-cAMP-tyrosyl methyl ester (22Steiner A.L. Jaffe B.M. Behrman H.R. Methods of Hormone Radioimmunoassay. 2nd. Academic Press, New York1979: 3-17Google Scholar) (20,000 cpm = 5 fmol) and anti-cAMP antiserum (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Total response was determined in the presence of 80 pmol (2.5 μg/ml) human RLF, and nonspecific response was determined in the absence of RLF. Assays of hRLF derivatives were compared with human RLF standards run in parallel. Assays were performed in duplicate, and three independent assays were averaged (±S.D.). The structural similarity of the relaxin-like factor and relaxin and the limited cross-reactivity of both hormones with the RLF receptor LGR8 (23Kumagai J. Hsu S.Y. Matsumi H. Roh J.S. Fu P. Wade J.D. Bathgate R.A.D. Hsueh A.J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31283-31286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) suggested that some similarity could be expected in the binding sites. This train of thought was further supported by the fact that the RLF receptor LGR8 has all the binding residues that were positively identified on the leucine-rich repeat region of the relaxin receptor LGR7 (24Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14051-14056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). RLF has only 1 of the 2 critical arginines seen in relaxin, and an initial survey of potential receptor interaction sites on the surface of the relaxin-like factor revealed that this arginine B16 was an important binding residue although not nearly equivalent to the corresponding arginine in relaxin. The high affinity of RLF for its receptor mandated the involvement of other binding sites. There was no choice but to survey the remaining B chain by substitution of alanine for potential binding residues. In the process we confirmed that tryptophan B27 is a primary binding site (8Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The effect again was limited to two orders of magnitude, ∼10-fold less than the effect observed after removal of a binding residue in relaxin (25Büllesbach E.E. Yang S. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22957-22960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35276-35280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The binding kinetics of RLF and LGR8 left no doubt that primary binding residues were not solely responsible for the overall receptor affinity but that multiple low affinity contact regions must exist that would bind LGR8 cooperatively. This working hypothesis could not be secured without extensive alanine scanning (27Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Thus, we systematically replaced with alanine residues of the B chain and the surface residues of the A chain (Fig. 1). The RLF residues A1–9, B1–5, and B28–31 were excluded from this study in as much as evidence shown in our earlier report indicated these regions do not affect receptor binding (12Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14586-14590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). All RLF derivatives were chemically synthesized and characterized by HPLC, MALDI-MS of the intact molecule (Table 1 and Fig. 1A), and an endoproteinase Glu-C Staphylococcus aureus V8/tryptic digest, showing the correct molecular masses and verifying the correct chain orientation in each derivative (Fig. 1B). To evaluate the integrity of the secondary structure each derivative was further characterized by a competitive receptor binding assay by its ability to trigger transmembrane signaling and by CD spectroscopy. Receptor binding and signaling were studied using a 293T cell line stably transfected with human LGR8. This allowed for direct comparison of the binding and signaling events on the same receptor.TABLE 1Chemical and biological data of RLF derivativesDerivativesYieldaYields are calculated on the initial equimolar reaction of partially protected A and B chains.

Dose-response curve of the derivative was run in parallel to human RLF standard. Open table in a new tab Replacement of A chain residues by alanine showed little effect on receptor binding (Fig. 2A). In fact, each hydrophilic residue on the A chain helix could be replaced by alanine without loss of LGR8 affinity. Even glycine A14 replacement by isoleucine, which essentially inactivates relaxin (28Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13124-13128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leaves RLF with 55% of the receptor affinity. From these experiments we can assume that the A chain does not contribute to the binding energy and may not be in close contact with LGR8. Clear indications for binding functions were obtained by replacement of several B chain residues. Placing alanine in positions B15, B18, or B25 suggested that these residues make intermediate contributions to LGR8 binding. In contrast, arginine B16, valine B19, and tryptophan B27 (Figs. 2A and 3A) contribute significantly to the total binding energy. Whereas B27 tryptophan is located in the flexible C-terminal region of the B chain, residues arginine B16 and valine B19 project from the central portion of the B chain helix. It is noteworthy that deletion of the indole ring reduces the receptor binding affinity to 0.5% of the control value. This is an order of magnitude weaker than relative affinities of B R16A (4.0%) and B V19A RLF (6.1%). It is remarkable as well that the binding of B W27A RLF to LGR8 is ∼4 times weaker than we reported for the mouse uterine receptor (8Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In previous studies we showed that the orientation of the indole ring is crucial to binding. This can be demonstrated by changing the display of the indole ring as in D-Trp or by forcing it into a different space by inserting D-proline in position B25 (8Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Lastly we modulated the affinity of RLF for the receptor by restricting the internal motion of the C-terminal area by cross-linkers of different lengths (11Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8021-8028Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To account for the picomolar affinity constant of the hormone receptor complex, other, less conspicuous binding regions must support cooperatively the binding effects of tryptophan B27, arginine B16, and valine B19. Our work revealed that surface residues His B12, His B13, and Val B15 might induce ancillary binding of significant magnitude although each contributes little to the binding energy.

Gillessen D. Tetrahedron Lett. 1989; 30: 1927-1930Crossref Scopus (932) Google Scholar), GHHFY, by penta-alanine reduces LGR8 binding 1000-fold. This is by far the most significant attenuation of RLF binding observed as a consequence of amino acid exchanges. The binding affinity drops below an estimated additive affinity for these derivatives by a factor of 15 for the replacement of HHFV and a factor of 110 for the replacement of GHHFV. Although we are exchanging helix-tolerant residues for typical helix formers, the drastic drop in binding propensity may be exacerbated by structural changes that affect more distant regions of RLF. Signal transduction as determined by the accumulation of cAMP parallels in general the binding avidity of the corresponding analog (Table 1 and Figs. 2B and 3, B and D). All A chain analogs and most B chain analogs are full agonists. Variations in the B chain are due to reduced binding avidity, i.e. B(11–15)Ala5 RLF is de facto inactive because of its very low receptor affinity. Other weakly binding derivatives B(12–15)Ala4, B R16A, and B W27A RLF achieve the maximum cAMP response at high concentrations (Fig. 3B). Apparent differences between binding and cAMP response for B L9A and B F14A RLFs are not statistically significant. In general, all derivatives achieve a maximum cAMP response as determined for hRLF with the exception of B V19A RLF, which gives a maximum response of ∼50%. Although valine B19 is thought to be a receptor binding residue, the inferior binding of B V19A RLF to LGR8 may cause subtle structural changes that reduce receptor activation, making it weakly antagonistic.

https://openalex.org/W2069968267,"Desulfitobacterium dehalogenans can use chlorinated aromatics including polychlorinated biphenyls as electron acceptors in a process called dehalorespiration. Expression of the cpr gene cluster involved in this process is regulated by CprK, which is a member of the CRP/FNR (cAMP-binding protein/fumarate nitrate reduction regulatory protein) family of helix-turn-helix transcriptional regulators. High affinity interaction of the chlorinated aromatic compound with the effector domain of CprK triggers binding of CprK to an upstream target DNA sequence, which leads to transcriptional activation of the cpr gene cluster. When incubated with oxygen or diamide, CprK undergoes inactivation; subsequent treatment with dithiothreitol restores activity. Using mass spectrometry, this study identifies two classes of redox-active thiol groups that form disulfide bonds upon oxidation. Under oxidative conditions, Cys105, which is conserved in FNR and most other CprK homologs, forms an intramolecular disulfide bond with Cys111, whereas an intermolecular disulfide bond is formed between Cys11 and Cys200. SDS-PAGE and site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicate that the Cys11/Cys200 disulfide bond links two CprK subunits in an inactive dimer. Isothermal calorimetry and intrinsic fluorescence quenching studies show that oxidation does not change the affinity of CprK for the effector. Therefore, reversible redox inactivation is manifested at the level of DNA binding. Our studies reveal a strategy for limiting expression of a redox-sensitive pathway by using a thiol-based redox switch in the transcription factor.

Desulfitobacterium dehalogenans is a Gram-positive bacterium that can recognize and use chlorinated aromatics, like polychlorinated biphenyls and chlorohydroxyphenyl acetate (CHPA), 4The abbreviations used are: CHPA, 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetate; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; DTT, dithiothreitol; IAM, iodoacetamide; VP, vinyl pyridine; MS, mass spectrometry. as electron acceptors (1Wiegel J.

Microbiol. 2004; 58: 43-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 4Utkin I. Woese C. Wiegel J. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1994; 44: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Dehalorespiration couples the two-electron reduction of the chlorinated aromatic compound and elimination of the chloride group (dehalogenation) to oxidation of membrane-associated electron carriers and to proton translocation, ultimately resulting in ATP generation (3Smidt H. de Vos W.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 43-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 5Mohn W.W. Tiedje J.M. Arch.

Polychlorinated biphenyls and other haloaromatics are xenobiotics that are produced by industry and also are biologically generated (8Gribble G.W. Chemosphere. 2003; 52: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Exploiting the ability of dehalorespiring microbes to initiate degradation by removal of the halogen group is a potential strategy for bioremediation of these toxic compounds. Induction of dehalorespiration activity occurs when desulfitobacteria are exposed to a chlorinated aromatic compound that can serve as a dehalogenation substrate (3Smidt H. de Vos W.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 43-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Induction is mediated through the transcriptional regulatory protein, CprK. Binding the chloroaromatic compound as an effector molecule triggers a conformational change in CprK, which promotes productive interaction with a nearly palindromic DNA sequence called the “FNR-like box” located upstream of four proximal transcriptional units in the cpr regulon (9Pop S.M. Kolarik R.J. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49910-49918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cpr regulon contains eight genes, cprT, cprK, cprZ, cprE, cprB, cprA, cprC, and cprD, that encode the dehalogenase (CprA), CprK, and a number of proteins assigned as chaperones and other components of the dehalorespiration process. The role of CprK as a transcriptional activator of the cpr dehalorespiration genes and its interaction with the FNR-like box had been predicted earlier by Smidt et al. (10Smidt H. van Leest M. van der Oost J. deVos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5683-5691Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) when the cpr regulon was first described. This proposal was confirmed by in vivo and in vitro DNA binding studies, which also demonstrated that CprK only functions under reducing conditions (9Pop S.M. Kolarik R.J. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49910-49918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Exposure to oxygen or incubation with a reagent (diamide) that oxidizes dithiols to their disulfide form inhibits binding of CprK to the FNR-like box sequence, and treating the oxidized protein with dithiothreitol reverses the oxidative inactivation (9Pop S.M. Kolarik R.J. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49910-49918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cellular rationale for redox regulation of CprK activity may relate to the oxygen sensitivity of the dehalogenase CprA, which is a metalloenzyme containing two iron-sulfur clusters and a modified form of vitamin B12 (11Krasotkina J. Walters T. Maruya K.A. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40991-40997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because it would be wasteful to produce CprA under oxidative conditions, it would be advantageous to control cpr transcription as a function of the redox state of the cell. In this study, the mechanism of redox regulation of CprK activity was examined. Oxidation of CprK was shown by internal quenching of fluorescence experiments and by isothermal calorimetry measurements to have no affect on the affinity of CprK for effector, strongly suggesting that oxidative inactivation is exhibited at the level of DNA binding. By mass spectrometry, nonreducing SDS-PAGE, and site-directed mutagenesis studies, the reversible redox inactivation was localized at one intermolecular and one intramolecular disulfide bond. Cloning, Overexpression, and Purification of CprK—DNA isolation and manipulation were performed using standard techniques (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was purified with a QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen). DNA fragments were purified from agarose gels using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Construction of the overexpression plasmid and purification of CprK were described previously (9Pop S.M. Kolarik R.J. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49910-49918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis of CprK—Cys11 and Cys200 were substituted with serine residues using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The pQE60::cprK plasmid was the template for PCRs using primers from Integrated DNA Technologies. DNA Sequencing—The DNA sequences of all PCR-generated DNA fragments were confirmed by automated sequencing of both strands by the Genomics Core Research Facility (University of Nebraska-Lincoln) with a Beckman/Coulter CEQ2000XL 8-capillary DNA sequencer using dye terminator chemistry. Alkylation of Cysteine Residues—Reduced (with 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)) and oxidized (lacking DTT) CprK samples at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in 0.5 ml of Buffer A (8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 1 mm Na-EDTA) were used for a two-step alkylation reaction (iodoacetamide (IAM) followed by 4-vinylpyridine (VP)). The first alkylation step involved incubating CprK with 50 mm IAM (final concentration) for 15 min at room temperature. The IAM stock solution was prepared by adding 100 mg of IAM to a solution containing 0.5 m sodium acetate, 2 mm Na-EDTA and incubating at 65 °C until the crystals were dissolved. The mixture was allowed to equilibrate slowly to room temperature. The IAM was protected from light at all times to avoid degradation and production of free iodine radicals, which are potent oxidants. The reaction was quenched by adding 5 ml of cold acetone with 1 n HCl (98:2) followed by centrifuging at 2000 × g for 5 min. The precipitate was washed three times by repeated suspension in a cold acetone with 1 n HCl and H2O solution (98:2:10) and centrifugation as above. After the third wash, precipitated CprK was dissolved in 0.5 ml of Buffer A and reduced by incubating at 37 °C for 30 min with 10 mm DTT. Then the sample was either digested with trypsin overnight at room temperature using a ratio of protein to trypsin of 5:1 and analyzed by mass spectroscopy or treated with a second alkylating agent. The second alkylation step was performed by adding 2 μl of 9.5 m VP (three times at 20-min intervals) to 0.5 ml of DTT-reduced CprK (above) and incubating for a total of 60 min at room temperature. The protein was precipitated, washed with cold acetone and 1 n HCl, resuspended in Buffer A containing 10 mm DTT as described above, digested with trypsin as just described, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Mass Spectrometric Analysis—The trypsin-digested samples were injected onto a C18 PepMap100, 75 μm × 15 cm, 3-μm 100 Å column (LC Packings, Sunnyvale, CA). Tryptic peptides were then separated using a linear gradient elution from 0.3% formic acid in H2O to 0.3% formic acid in acetonitrile at a flow rate of 170 nanoliter/min. The nano-LC (liquid chromatography)/MS/MS analysis of tryptic peptides was performed using a Q-Star XL mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). The masses of tryptic peptides and modifications were matched with the MASCOT search engine. The two tables show the predicted relative molecular masses of the Cys-containing peptides based on their sequences and the experimental relative molecular masses, which were calculated from the experimentally observed m/z values. These tables also show the relative intensities of these peptides, which were calculated from their peak heights at a particular m/z generated from the selected ion chromatogram. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry Experiments (ITC)—ITC experiments were performed at 25 °C using a VP-ITC isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northhampton, MA). The reaction cell (∼1.4 ml) was filled with a 0.038 mm solution of purified CprK that had been dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, without DTT, and degassed by vacuum aspiration for 5 min prior to loading. The titrated ligand CHPA (initial concentration, 0.5 mm) was dissolved in the CprK dialysis buffer. The stirring speed was 300 rpm, and the thermal power of 60 injections of 3 μl was recorded every 240 s. Thermogram analysis was performed using Origin 7.0 software supplied with the instrument. Intrinsic Fluorescence Quenching Experiments—Fluorescence spectroscopy was performed at 20 °C with an OLIS RSM1000F instrument. The starting concentration of CprK (both oxidized and reduced) was 3.0 mm, and fluorescence intensity was measured at 325.6 nm following the addition of CHPA. The excitation was set at 280 nm with an excitation slit of 3.16 nm, an emission slit of 1.24 nm, and a grating of 600 lines/mm. The data were plotted fit to one-site (Equations 1 and 2) and two-site and three-site (Equation 3) models to determine the dissociation constants and to statistically assess the binding model. In these equations, F is the measured fluorescence, and x is calculated from the quadratic Equation 2, where b equals (E + L + Kd), i.e. the sum of E (total concentration of enzyme), L (total ligand concentration), and Kd (dissociation constant); and c is the product of the concentrations of L*E. In Equation 3, which describes a bi- or multi-phasic titration curve, Kdn represents the dissociation constant(s) (i.e. Kd1 and Kd2 for a biphasic curve), F0 is the initial fluorescence, and F and L are defined as for the one-site model (i.e. F1 and F2 designate the amplitudes of the first and second phases of a biphasic titration, respectively).F=(Fmax*Kd)/(x+Kd)(Eq. 1) x=0.5[(-b+(b2+4c))]0.5(Eq. 2) F=F0+Σ{Fn*Kdn/(Kdn+L)}(Eq. 3) Nonreducing SDS-PAGE Analysis—Purified proteins from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid metal affinity column were dialyzed against a solution of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl to remove imidazole. The dialyzed protein was then incubated with 15 mm diamide, 15 mm H2O2, and/or 10 mm DTT for 5 min at room temperature. After incubation, nonreducing loading buffer (60 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) was added, and a 12% SDS-PAGE experiment was run. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—A 90-bp fragment containing the CprB promoter region was prepared, 5′-end-labeled by [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), and used in EMSA experiments as described earlier (9Pop S.M. Kolarik R.J. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49910-49918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained gel shift binding 1-buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC); final concentrations), CHPA (Sigma-Aldrich), and purified CprK. The reaction was initiated by adding the 32P-labeled DNA fragment, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The mixtures were separated by electrophoresis, followed by drying and autoradiography as described (9Pop S.M. Kolarik R.J. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49910-49918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). CprK-Effector Interactions—The results of previous EMSA and ITC experiments showed that CprK binds the effector molecule CHPA with high affinity (3.5 ± 0.4 μm), which promotes DNA binding to a specific palindromic sequence (9Pop S.M. Kolarik R.J. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49910-49918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). CprK was shown to lose DNA binding activity when it is oxidized by diamide or by extended incubation in air and to regain DNA binding activity when it is incubated with DTT (9Pop S.M. Kolarik R.J. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49910-49918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). CprK contains a single tryptophan residue (Trp106), which is adjacent to Cys105. When CprK is incubated with CHPA, the fluorescence of this tryptophan residue is quenched, providing a way to measure effector binding affinity. The titration of DTT-reduced CprK with CHPA was fit to Equation 1, which describes a one-site model, and to Equation 3 for two- and three-site models (Fig. 1). The data density was sufficient to rule out one- and two-site models and to support a three-site binding model, based on the goodness of fit parameter (R2 = 0.992 for the three-site versus 0.981 for the two-site and 0.919 for the one-site model). The three Kd values are 0.04 μm, 1.5, and 300 μm (Table 1). Approximately 50% of the total fluorescence quenching occurs in the first two phases (about 25% in each of these phases), and the remaining 50% of the intensity is lost in the third phase. At high concentrations of effector, the fluorescence is nearly completely quenched.TABLE 1Dissociation constants for the CprK-CHPA complexReduced CprKOxidized CprKITCFluorescenceITCFluorescenceKdAmpaAmplitude of the phase relative to the total change in fluorescence or heat, expressed as a percentageKdAmpKdAmpKdAmpμm%μm%μm%μm%0.02 ± 0.0152 ± 20.04 ± 0.0222 ± 50.038 ± 0.00727 ± 21.3 ± 0.248 ± 21.5 ± 0.731 ± 44.8 ± 1.61005.9 ± 1.723 ± 2300 ± 6047 ± 2260 ± 1750 ± 2a Amplitude of the phase relative to the total change in fluorescence or heat, expressed as a percentage Open table in a new tab Oxidation of CprK could disable either effector or DNA binding. To address the mode of reversible redox inactivation, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence quenching experiments were performed to compare the affinity of oxidized versus reduced CprK for CHPA. With CprK prepared aerobically and in the absence of a reducing reagent, the total intrinsic fluorescence is ∼6.5-fold higher than that of the reduced protein. However, as with the reduced protein, the data best fit a three-site model with dissociation constants of 0.04, 5.9, and 260 μm, which are nearly identical to those determined for the reduced protein (Fig. 1 and Table 1). To further investigate the thermodynamics of effector binding to CprK, ITC experiments were performed with the oxidized and reduced protein. Given the low Kd measured by fluorescence quenching, we collected many data points across the titration curve, especially at low effector concentrations (Fig. 2). Two phases are clearly evident in the ITC profile for the reduced protein, and the two-site model provides a much better fit to the data than a single-site model, based on the chi-square values (1874 for the two-site model versus 3299 for the one-site model). The two Kd values (0.02 ± 0.01 and 1.3 ± 0.2 μm) are similar to the first two Kd values observed by fluorescence quenching experiments, and the two phases have nearly equal amplitudes (Table 1). Our focus was on the tight binding sites, so we did not titrate to high enough effector concentrations to attempt to verify the low affinity (300 μm) binding site detected by fluorescence quenching. We performed ITC studies on the oxidized protein numerous times; however, because this form of CprK is relatively unstable at the high concentration and over the long incubation time required for this experiment, the data were consistently of poorer quality than those for the reduced protein. In this case, we are unable to discriminate between a two-site and a one-site model; therefore, following Occam's razor, show the fit to the one-site model in Fig. 2b. Regardless, the ITC data indicate that the oxidized protein contains at least one high affinity site (Kd = 4.8 μm), which is in general agreement with the fluorescence quenching data. In summary, on the basis of fluorescence quenching and ITC studies, we conclude that the oxidized and reduced forms of CprK have two high affinity and one low affinity sites and that CHPA binding is not affected by the redox state of the protein. In both ITC and fluorescence experiments, the phase amplitudes of the two high affinity sites are equivalent, and the amplitude of the low affinity site in the fluorescence experiment equals the sum of the phase amplitudes of the two high affinity sites (Table 1). CHPA binding to the high affinity site(s) is largely entropy driven, with ΔS values at 310 K of -9.3 kJ/mol and -6.9 kJ/mol associated with Kd1 and Kd2, respectively (Fig. 2). Because oxidative inactivation of CprK does not measurably alter its interactions with the effector, disulfide bond formation must affect DNA binding affinity. Consistent with earlier results on redox control of CprK activity (9Pop S.M. Kolarik R.J. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49910-49918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), an EMSA performed with the oxidized protein sample after the ITC experiment showed no detectable DNA binding; however, when 10 mm DTT was incubated with the oxidized CprK-CHPA mixture for 5 min, DNA binding activity was restored (not shown). The reversibility of the redox inactivation is consistent with the hypothesis that oxidation involves the formation of one or more disulfide bonds. Another possibility is that one of the cysteine residues is oxidized to a sulfinate or sulfenate, which also would also be reversed by treatment with DTT (13Paget M.S. Buttner M.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 91-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these various possibilities, chemical alkylation and mass spectrometric experiments were performed. Alkylation of Cysteine Residues and Mass Spectrometric Analysis of CprK—CprK from D. dehalogenans contains five cysteine residues: Cys11, Cys105, Cys111, Cys161, and Cys200. To assess whether any of these residues are involved in disulfide bond formation, CprK samples were prepared by exposure to air, oxidation with diamide, or reduction with 10 mm DTT. The CprK samples were denatured by urea to expose all of the Cys residues, subjected to a two-step alkylation procedure, and then analyzed by mass spectrometry. The first alkylation step involved treatment of the urea-denatured protein with IAM, which labeled Cys residues that were present in the thiolate form to generate S-carboxamidomethylcysteine. The second alkylation step involved reduction with DTT, followed by treatment with VP. Cys residues that were initially present in a disulfide bond would not be labeled by IAM during the first alkylation step; however, after reduction with DTT, those residues would react with VP and undergo conversion to S-(4-vinylpyridylethyl)cysteine. CprK samples were digested with trypsin and analyzed by mass spectrometry after either the first or second alkylation step. After the one-step alkylation reaction, 77% (airoxidized) and 84% (reduced) coverage of the CprK sequence was achieved by mass spectrometric analysis, and 83% (oxidized) and 88% (reduced) sequence coverage was obtained after the two-step procedure. The results of the one-step and two-step alkylation procedures are shown in Tables 2 and 3. In these tables, the number of IAM modifications is listed beside the peptide identification. The predicted molecular mass of each peptide, based on its sequence, was compared with the experimentally determined mass. The tables also include the intensity value, which does not measure the absolute quantity of a peptide but quantifies the relative abundance of a particular peptide under similar liquid chromatography/MS conditions.TABLE 2Mass spectrometry results of air-oxidized and reduced CprK alkylated with IAMPeptideSequenceAir-oxidizedReducedIAMIntensityIAMIntensityNo.aNumber of cysteine residues modifiedMr (calc)bRelative molecular mass based on the matched peptide sequenceMr (expt)cExperimental m/z factored by zNo.aNumber of cysteine residues modifiedMr (calc)bRelative molecular mass based on the matched peptide sequenceMr (expt)cExperimental m/z factored by zcpscps1–25AMSAEGLDKDFCGIIPDSFFPEKNDdND indicates that this peptide was not detected under these conditionsNDNDND12757.302758.1765105–114TCWFSEECLR01272.531270.46400021386.571386.494928157–167LFYECSSQGK11331.611330.57188611330.621330.57234198–203VLACLK0645.39645.37200NDNDNDND198–204VLACLKK0773.48773.46337NDNDNDND1–25 + 198–203AMSAEGLDKDFCGIIPDSFFPEK + VLACLK03343.673343.56175NDNDNDND1–25 + 198–204AMSAEGLDKDFCGIIPDSFFPEK + VLACLKK03471.763471.64227NDNDNDNDa Number of cysteine residues modifiedb Relative molecular mass based on the matched peptide sequencec Experimental m/z factored by zd ND indicates that this peptide was not detected under these conditions Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Mass spectrometry results of air-oxidized and reduced CprK modified by two-step alkylationPeptideSequenceAir-oxidizedReducedNo.aNumber of cysteine residues modifiedMr (calc)bRelative molecular mass based on the matched peptide sequenceMr (expt)cExperimental m/z factored by zIntensityNo.aNumber of cysteine residues modifiedMr (calc)bRelative molecular mass based on the matched peptide sequenceMr (expt)cExperimental m/z factored by zIntensityIAM4VPdThe number of VP modifications detected are listed in these columnsIAM4VPdThe number of VP modifications detected are listed in these columnscpscps1–25AMSAEGLDKDFCGIIPDSFFPEK102757.302758.3170102757.302757.3315010–25DFCGIIPDSFFPEK011854.891854.89226101854.891854.89120105–114TCWFSEECLR111434.611434.63180201386.571386.573163021482.641482.65999111434.611434.63279157–167LFYECSSQGK101330.621330.624000101330.621330.64300011378.661378.671906198–203VLACLK10702.41702.4294510702.41702.43400001750.45750.45200a Number of cysteine residues modifiedb Relative molecular mass based on the matched peptide sequencec Experimental m/z factored by zd The number of VP modifications detected are listed in these columns Open table in a new tab When CprK samples were reduced with 10 mm DTT and alkylated by IAM, mass spectrometric analysis revealed that Cys11, Cys105, Cys111, and Cys161 were modified with carboxamido labels. Thus, in the presence of DTT, these four Cys residues were initially present in the thiolate form (Table 2). Although when samples were analyzed after this one-step IAM alkylation experiment, a peptide covering Cys200 was not detected, all five cysteine residues were modified by IAM in the first step of the two-step alkylation of reduced CprK (Table 3). In summary, these data indicate that DTT-reduced active protein contains all five cysteine residues in the thiol or thiolate form. When the air-oxidized protein was analyzed by the one-step alkylation reaction, a peptide containing S-carboxyamidomethyl-labeled Cys161 (peptide 157-167) was recovered in high amounts (Table 2), indicating that this residue was in the thiol form under both reducing (above) and oxidizing conditions. None of the other four Cys residues (Cys11, Cys105, Cys111, and Cys200) of air-oxidized CprK were labeled by IAM. The MS analysis did not indicate the presence of sulfenate, sulfinate, or sulfonate modification of any Cys-containing peptides. An unlabeled peptide 105-114 containing Cys105 and Cys111 was identified whose mass was lower by 2.06 Da than predicted, suggesting the loss of two hydrogen atoms (Fig. 3A), which would be expected for a peptide containing a disulfide bond. A smaller amount of this peptide contained IAM modification, whereas in the DTT-reduced samples, the doubly IAM-modified peptide 105-114 was present in much higher proportion than the unmodified one (supplemental Fig. S1). These results indicate that, in the air-oxidized protein, Cys161 is a reduced thiol(ate), and Cys105 and Cys111 are linked by a disulfide bridge. The situation with Cys11 and Cys200 is addressed below. In agreement with the results of the one-step alkylation protocol, when air-oxidized CprK was subjected to the two-step procedure, peptide 105-114 contained two S-(4-pyridylethyl) modifications (Table 3). A small proportion of this peptide was found with both modifications (S-carboxyamidomethyl and S-(4-pyridylethyl)); however, the peptide containing the double modification by VP was 6-fold more abundant. Therefore, both the single and double alkylation results indicate that Cys105 and Cys111 form a disulfide bond in air-oxidized CprK. This disulfide bridge is most likely intramolecular because these residues are close in the primary sequence. Furthermore, we could not locate a peak with the mass expected for two covalently linked 105-114 peptides during analysis of the single alkylation experiment. The two-step procedure also results in IAM modification of the peptide containing Cys161, with a smaller amount of VP modification. Based on the results with the one-step procedure, we assume that the minor amount of Cys161 labeled by VP simply reflects incomplete IAM labeling, although we cannot rule out a minor proportion of Cys161 being involved in a disulfide link with another residue. MS analysis of the peptides containing Cys11 and Cys200 was more complicated. When the oxidized CprK sample was treated with only IAM, we did not observe a peptide containing Cys11 (Table 2). However, as shown in the last two rows of Table 2, we observed two peaks with masses corresponding to the sum of t"

It is usually thought that d-amino acids cannot be incorporated into proteins because of the stereospecificity of the translational machinery. The main step of d-amino acid exclusion is believed to be ensured by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. However, several of these enzymes, like Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases, as well as E. coli tryptophanyl-, aspartyl-, lysyl-, and histidyl-tRNA synthetases, have been shown capable of catalyzing the transfer of the d-isomer of their cognate amino acid onto the corresponding tRNA species in vitro (1Calendar R.

Biochem. 2005; 69: 1040-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Catalytic efficiencies of these synthetases in the presence of the d-enantiomer of their cognate amino acid are 15-2000-fold lower than those measured with the l-enantiomer. These observations suggested possible esterification of d-amino acids on tRNA in vivo. Recently, transfer of d-tyrosine on tRNATyr could be unambiguously demonstrated in E. coli cells (6Soutourina O. Soutourina J. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42560-42565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Such a transfer accounts for the toxicity of d-tyrosine against the growth of this bacterium. Extracts of E. coli, yeast, and rabbit reticulocytes were reported early on to contain an enzyme, called d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase, that hydrolyzes the ester linkage between a d-amino acid and tRNA (2Calendar R. Berg P. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In E. coli, this deacylase is encoded by the dtd gene (7Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Inactivation of this gene accentuates the sensitivity of cell growth to the presence of either d-Tyr, d-Trp, d-Asp, d-Ser, or d-Gln in the culture medium (3Soutourina J. Plateau P. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32535-32542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This behavior suggested that, by recycling d-aminoacyl-tRNAs into free tRNA molecules, d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase counterreacts against the toxicity associated with the formation of d-aminoacyl-tRNAs in vivo. Actually, it was shown later that, when an E. coli Δdtd mutant strain is exposed to the presence of 2.4 mmd-tyrosine, nearly half of the tRNATyr pool can be converted into metabolically inactive d-Tyr-tRNATyr (6Soutourina O.

Jacobs A.R. Krylov D.M. Makarova K.S. Mazumder R. Mekhedov S.L. Nicolskaya A.N. Rao B.S. Rogozin I.B. Smirnov S. Sorokin A.V. Sverdlov A.V. Vasudevan S. Wolf Y.I. Yin J.J. Natale D.A. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: R7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dtd ortholog in S. cerevisiae (DTD1) produces a protein that catalyzes the hydrolysis of d-Tyr-tRNATyr in vitro. Moreover, inactivation of DTD1 enhances the sensitivity of yeast to the harmful effect of d-tyrosine (4Soutourina J. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11626-11630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity appears to be widespread in the living world. Surprisingly, however, dtd/DTD1 homologs were not detected in the available archaeal genomes (4Soutourina J. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11626-11630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, either archaea do not need a d-Tyr-tRNATyr activity, or this activity is afforded by a nonorthologous enzyme. To address this question, we used Sulfolobus solfataricus to search whether it contained d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity. d-[methylene-3H]Tyrosine (211 GBq/mmol) was custom-prepared by Amersham Biosciences. l-[14C]Tyrosine (16 GBq/mmol) and l-[14C]lysine (11.7 GBq/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Nonradioactive amino acids were from Sigma. E. coli strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. In order to overexpress genes inserted in the pET15blpa plasmid, E. coli strains K37ΔrecA and K37ΔTyrHΔrecA were lysogenized with the λDE3 prophage (from Novagen), to obtain strains K37ΔrecAλDE3 and K37ΔTyrHΔrecAλDE3, respectively.TABLE 1E. coli strains used in this studyStrainDescriptionSource/ReferenceJM101TRΔ(lac pro) supE thi recA56 srl-300::Tn10 (F′ traD36 proAB laclq lacZΔM15)Ref. 25Hirel P.H.

The culture (3 liters) was quickly cooled and centrifuged for 15 min at 7000 × g. The cell pellet (24 g, wet weight) was suspended in 120 ml of 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. This buffer and all buffers used for the isolation of d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase were systematically supplemented with 50 μm zinc acetate and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Cells were disrupted by sonication (10 min, 0 °C). The resulting extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 210 min. The supernatant was brought to 70% ammonium sulfate saturation and then centrifuged for 20 min at 8000 × g. The protein pellet was dissolved in 10 ml of 5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2) containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and dialyzed against 2 liters of the same buffer. The resulting solution was applied on a column of Q-Sepharose FastFlow (3 × 14 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2). Elution was carried out at a flow rate of 2 ml/min with a 2-liter linear gradient of 50-450 mm KCl in the same buffer (20 mm/h). d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity was recovered at 850 min. Fractions containing activity were pooled and directly applied on a hydroxylapatite column (2.5 × 10 cm; Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2). Elution was performed at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min with a linear gradient of 5-300 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2, 3.7 mm/h). Enzyme activity was recovered at 1650 min. Active fractions were pooled and brought to 80% ammonium sulfate saturation. After centrifugation at 8000 × g for 20 min, the sample was dissolved in 5 ml of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 50 mm KCl, dialyzed against 1 liter of the same buffer, and applied on a Superdex 75 column (1.6 × 60 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the same buffer and eluted at a flow rate of 0.15 ml/min. Deacylase activity was recovered at 520 min. Fractions containing activity were pooled and applied on a hydroxylapatite column (0.3 × 13 cm; Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2). Elution was performed at a flow rate of 0.02 ml/min with a linear gradient of 5-300 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2, 18 mm/h). Enzyme activity was recovered at 520 min. Active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 1 liter of 5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2), and applied on a MonoQ column (0.5 × 5 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the same buffer. Elution was carried out at a flow rate of 0.15 ml/min with a linear gradient of 0-300 mm KCl in 5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2, 2.15 mm/min). Enzyme activity was recovered at 65 min. Aliquots of the active fractions recovered from the MonoQ column were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After migration, proteins were electrophoretically transferred on a ProBlot membrane (from Applied Biosystems) and stained with Amido Black. One protein band corresponding to an Mr of about 30,000 was selected and submitted to five cycles of Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems Procise Sequencer. Cloning of d-Tyr-tRNATyr Deacylase Genes—The SS02234 gene was amplified by PCR using S. solfataricus genomic DNA as template and oligonucleotides CCGAATTCTATGGACATTAAGCTAGTTTATTCTACTTTGGATC and TAACTCAACAAATACTGCAGCTATCGAAACTCGATATTAAT as primers. The resulting DNA fragment was purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit 50, digested by EcoRI and PstI, and inserted into the corresponding sites of plasmid pKK223-3 (10Brosius J. Holy A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6929-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) to give plasmid pKK-DTD2. To clone the PAB2349 gene of Pyrococcus abyssi, a PCR amplification was performed using P. abyssi genomic DNA as template and oligonucleotides TGATCAGGATCCCATATGAAGGTGATTATGACTACCAAGGTGGACAAGGC and CCAATGCATTGGTTCTGCAGGCGGCCGCCTAGTCTTTTATGAATTCTAAACCCAA as primers. The amplified DNA fragment was purified, digested by both NdeI and NotI, and inserted into the corresponding sites of plasmid pET3alpa (11Guillon L. Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15594-15601Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) to give plasmid pET3a-DTD2. Then the PAB2349 gene was amplified from pET3a-DTD2 DNA with oligonucleotides GGAGATATACCCATGGAGGTGATTATGACTACCAAGGTG and GCGGTGGCAGCAGCCAACTCAGCTTCCTTT as primers. The amplified DNA fragment was purified, digested by both NcoI and NotI, and inserted into the corresponding sites of plasmid pET15blpa (11Guillon L. Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15594-15601Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) to give plasmid pET-DTD2. In the three cases of pKK-DTD2, pET3a-DTD2, and pET-DTD2, cloned genes were verified by DNA sequencing. Production and Purification of Wild-type and Mutant P. abyssi d-Tyr-tRNATyr Deacylase—For site-directed mutagenesis, plasmid pET15blpa containing the desired mutation was synthesized by DNA polymerization using pET-DTD2 as template, a pair of complementary mutagenic primers, and Pfu-Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). After thermal cycling, methylated wild-type DNA was restricted in the presence of DpnI before transformation of XL1-Blue (Table 1) cells. Full sequences of the mutated dtd2 genes were systematically verified. E. coli strain BL21 (Invitrogen) was transformed by the pET-DTD2 plasmid carrying the P. abyssi dtd2 gene variants. Transformed cells were grown at 37 °C in 100-200 ml of a culture medium (1.6% bacto-tryptone, 1% bacto-yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl) containing 80 μg of ampicillin/ml. When the value of the optical density at 650 nm reached 2, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added at a final concentration of 1 mm, and growth was continued for 4 h at room temperature. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 8000 × g. The cell pellet was suspended in 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. This buffer as well as all buffers used for the purification of the deacylase contained 50 μm zinc acetate. Cells were disrupted by sonication (4 min, 0 °C). Resulting extracts were heated at 80 °C for 15 min and centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 10 min. Nucleic acids were precipitated by the addition of streptomycin (30 g/liter) to the supernatant, which was then centrifuged for 30 min at 11,000 × g. The resulting supernatants were brought to 70% ammonium sulfate saturation and centrifuged for 15 min at 11,000 × g. The protein pellets were dissolved in 2 ml of 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and dialyzed against 250 ml of the same buffer. The resulting solutions were applied on a hydroxylapatite column (1.3 × 1.5 cm) equilibrated in 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). Elution was performed at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min with a linear gradient of 5-600 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2, 180 mm/h). Enzyme activity was recovered at 140 min. This purification procedure produced ∼4 mg of protein in 8 ml. Homogeneity of the samples was estimated to be on the order of 90% by SDS-PAGE analysis. Obtained enzymes were stored at -20 °C in a 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) containing 60% glycerol and 50 μm zinc acetate. Molecular ratio of the wild-type enzyme was estimated by high performance gel filtration chromatography. For this purpose, a protein sample (∼2 mg) recovered after the hydroxylapatite chromatography was brought to 70% ammonium sulfate saturation and centrifuged for 15 min at 11,000 × g. The pellet was dissolved in 0.1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7) containing 50 μm zinc acetate and 300 mm KCl and applied onto a TSK SWXL 3000 column (0.78 × 30 cm; Supelco) preceded by a TSK SWXL guard column (0.6 × 4 cm; Supelco). The column and the guard column were equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7) containing 50 μm zinc acetate and 300 mm KCl. Elution flow rate was 0.7 ml/min. The Mr of the d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase was deduced from comparison of its elution time with those of proteins with known Mr. Concentrations of the purified d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase samples were determined using a molecular ratio (∼30,800) calculated from the amino acid sequence of the protein and light absorption coefficients of 0.97 A280 units/mg/ml for the W162A variant and of 1.146 A280 units/mg/ml for wild-type enzyme and all other variants. Preparation of Crude Extracts for Activity Measurements—To measure d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity in recombinant E. coli cells, bacteria were grown in 15 ml of 2× TY or M9-glucose medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. After centrifugation at 8000 × g for 10 min, bacteria were suspended in 5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2) in order to obtain a final A650 nm of 100. Cells were disrupted by sonication (3 min, 0 °C), and debris were removed by centrifugation (15 min, 18,000 × g). When indicated, extracts were heated at 80 °C for 10 min and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatants were assayed for activity. Total amounts of protein in the extracts were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay, with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Measurement of d-Tyr-tRNATyr Deacylase Activity—E. coli tRNATyr and tRNALys were prepared as described previously (7Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Schmitt E. Mechulam Y. Fromant M. Plateau P. Blanquet S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4760-4769Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). tRNATyr was fully aminoacylated with [3H]d-tyrosine (18.5 GBq/mol) or [14C]l-tyrosine (16 GBq/mol) (7Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). tRNALys was fully aminoacylated with [14C]l-lysine (11.7 GBq/mol) and then acetylated with acetic anhydride (12Schmitt E. Mechulam Y. Fromant M. Plateau P. Blanquet S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4760-4769Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity was measured under initial rate conditions for 5 min at 37 °C in 100-μl assays containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.15 μm [3H]d-Tyr-tRNATyr, 4 mm MgCl2, and 50 μm zinc acetate. The reaction was started by the addition of enzyme (25 μl) diluted in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μm zinc acetate, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The ranges of d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase concentrations in the assay were as follows: 0.02-0.2 nm (wild type and S78A, W162A, and H197A variants), 0.2-20 nm (H80A, H92A, H141A, E154A, and Y198A), and 1-70 nm (E137A and H140A). Final product concentration in the assay never exceeded 30% of the initial substrate concentration. The reaction was quenched by the addition of ethanol (340 μl) plus sodium acetate (14 μl, 3 m, pH 4.8) and carrier RNA from yeast (20 μl, 4 mg/ml). After incubation, samples were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 15 min. Soluble radioactivity in the recovered supernatant was measured by scintillation counting, as described (7Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity corresponds to 1 pmol of d-Tyr-tRNATyr hydrolyzed/s. Rate values were corrected for spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrate in the absence of enzyme. Determination of d-Amino Acid Toxicity—E. coli cells were grown at 37 °C in M9-glucose minimal medium containing 100 μg of ampicillin/ml, in the presence or in the absence of 2.4 mmd-tyrosine. Cultures were started in M9-glucose without d-amino acid. After ∼8 h of growth, bacteria were diluted at a final A650 of 0.0007-0.001 in medium containing or not the d-amino acid. When the A650 of the culture reached 0.2-0.3, bacteria were diluted again into the medium under study in order to obtain a final A650 of 0.02. These cultures were left to grow in order to measure generation times. Zinc Concentration Measurements—Zinc contents of wild-type and mutant d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylases were deduced from measurement of the molecular masses of the proteins by mass spectrometry. Prior to measurements, samples of the d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase variants (10-20 μm, 0.3 ml) were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 5 liters of 10 mm ammonium acetate (pH 7.5) containing 10 μm zinc acetate. Mass spectrometry measurements could not be performed at higher metal concentrations, because beyond 10 μm zinc, analyzed samples displayed zinc-adduct formation. Mass spectrometry experiments were achieved using a Bruker APEX III Fourier transform-ICR mass spectrometer equipped with a 7.0 T actively shielded magnet and an unmodified Apollo electrospray source. Samples were introduced by direct infusion electrospray ionization, with a flow rate of 1.5 μl/min. Instrumental parameters were adjusted in order to preserve the noncovalent interactions. Changes as compared with standard instrumental conditions were as follows: increase of the hexapole radiofrequency amplitude to the maximal value (600 Vpp), increase of the excitation parameters (∼2-fold), and increase of the gated-trapping delay. In another set of experiments, after dialysis and prior to mass spectrometry analysis, proteins (10-20 μm, 50 μl) were incubated with 1 mm EDTA for 10 min and immediately desalted using Micro Bio-Spin P6 columns (Bio-Rad) with a 6-kDa molecular mass cut-off equilibrated in 10 mm ammonium acetate (pH 7.5). The desalting step was achieved in less than 5 min. Spectra were analyzed using XMASS and DataAnalysis software (Bruker Daltonics GmbH). Zinc in wild-type d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase was also assessed by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy using a Varian AA220 spectrophotometer equipped with an air-acetylene burner. Prior to zinc analysis, d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase was submitted to size exclusion chromatography on a TSK SWXL 3000 column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7) containing 300 mm KCl. Elution was performed at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. Fractions of 280 μl were collected and measured for zinc content at 213.9 nm in the peak height mode with 100-μl injections. Buffer used in this experiment was carefully deprived of divalent metal ions as follows. A concentrated buffer stock (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 3 m KCl; 60 ml) was chromatographed through a Chelex 100 column (0.2 × 7 cm; Bio-Rad). Prior to use, the recovered buffer was diluted 10-fold with purified water. Standard solutions containing various zinc concentrations (0.5-40 μm) were prepared by dilution in this buffer. Mass Spectrometry Measurements under Denaturing Conditions—To measure masses of the proteins under denaturing conditions (50% acetonitrile, 0.2% formic acid), standard instrumental Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry conditions were applied. Purification of d-Tyr-tRNATyr Deacylase from an S. solfataricus Extract—Exposure of [3H]d-Tyr-tRNATyr to a S. solfataricus cell extract resulted in a time-dependent loss of trichloroacetic acid-insoluble radioactive material. Purification of the enzyme responsible of the hydrolysis of d-Tyr-tRNATyr was therefore attempted. In a preliminary experiment, we observed that, upon prolonged storage of the extract at 4 °C in 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, the hydrolytic activity decreased spontaneously with a half-life of 2 days. However, at the end of the storage, the lost activity could be partly recovered upon the addition of 50 μm zinc ions. For this reason, we systematically added 50 μm zinc acetate to all buffers used for enzyme purification, and EDTA was omitted. After successive chromatographies on Q-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite, Superdex 75, and MonoQ columns, the specific deacylase activity detected in S. solfataricus extracts (325 units/mg total protein) was enriched about 150-fold. The most highly purified fractions recovered from the MonoQ column were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Several protein bands were visible. The intensity of one of these bands varied proportionally to the deacylase activity measured in each fraction. This band corresponded to a molecular ratio of about 30,000. After transfer from the gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, this protein band was submitted to five cycles of Edman degradation. The obtained N-terminal sequence, MDIKL, unambiguously indicated the open reading frame (ORF) 3The abbreviation used is: ORF, open reading frame. SSO2234. This ORF encodes a polypeptide of 238 amino acids with a molecular weight of 26,959. To assess whether the SS02234 ORF actually encoded a protein with d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity, this gene was amplified by PCR and inserted into the expression vector pKK223-3. Strain JM101TR was transformed by the resulting plasmid pKK-DTD2 or by the control plasmid pKK223-3. A small but significant d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity could be detected in heated crude extracts prepared from cells harboring the pKK-DTD2 plasmid. This activity amounted to only ∼10% of the deacylase activity measured in nonheated extracts. Further attempts to increase the thermoresistant deacylase activity in heated crude extracts were not successful. In particular, introduction of the SS02234 ORF into plasmid pET15blpa and transformation of strain BL21 by the resulting plasmid led to the overproduction of a protein detectable by SDS-PAGE analysis, as expected. However, after cell breakage, this protein was recovered in the insoluble fraction (data not shown), presumably because the archaeal protein formed inclusion bodies. As a consequence, we could not manage to determine whether the SS02234 ORF was able to complement a deletion of the E. coli dtd gene. Cloning of the PAB2349 Gene from P. abyssi—The P. abyssi genome encodes a protein (PAB2349) sharing 26% strict identity with the SS02234 product (Fig. 1). To overcome the difficulty encountered with the SS02234 ORF product, we amplified the PAB2349 gene by PCR and inserted it into the expression vector pET15blpa. Upon transformation by the resulting plasmid (pET-DTD2), E. coli strain K37ΔrecAλDE3 overexpressed one soluble protein with the expected mass of ∼30 kDa. In the crude extract, d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity was increased ∼50-fold if compared with E. coli cells transformed by the control plasmid pET15blpa. Moreover, the activity in the K37ΔrecAλDE3(pET-DTD2) extract was thermoresistant, whereas that in the control K37ΔrecAλDE3(pET15blpa) extract was not. These results showed that the PAB2349 protein could be overexpressed under an active form in an E. coli extract. We named this protein Dtd2. The growth of E. coli dtd null mutants is markedly impaired by the addition of 2.4 mmd-tyrosine to the culture medium (7Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Dtd2 protein behaved as a d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase in vivo, the pET-DTD2 plasmid was introduced into such a null mutant. The E. coli Δdtd strain K37ΔTyrHΔrecAλDE3 and its parental strain K37ΔrecAλDE3 were transformed with either plasmid pET-DTD2 or plasmid pET15blpa. Comparison of the levels of d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity in the four resulting strains confirmed the overexpression of a thermoresistant deacylase activity dependent on the presence of the pET-DTD2 plasmid (Table 2). Generation times of all four strains were identical (76 ± 1 min) in M9 minimal medium without added d-tyrosine (Table 2). Upon the addition of 2.4 mm d-tyrosine, the generation time of strain K3"

https://openalex.org/W2074630594,"In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, cytokinesis is thought to be controlled by the daughter spindle-pole body (SPB) through a regulatory pathway named the septation initiation network (SIN). Here, we demonstrate that laser ablation of both, but not a single SPB, results in failure of cytokinesis. Ablation of only the daughter SPB often leads to activation of the SIN on the mother SPB and successful cytokinesis. Thus, either SPB can drive cytokinesis."
https://openalex.org/W2029026356,"Changes in DNA bending and base flipping in a previously characterized specificity-enhanced M.EcoRI DNA adenine methyltransferase mutant suggest a close relationship between precatalytic conformational transitions and specificity (Allan, B. W., Garcia, R., Maegley, K., Mort, J., Wong, D., Lindstrom, W., Beechem, J. M., and Reich, N. O. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 19269–19275). The direct measurement of the kinetic rate constants for DNA bending, intercalation, and base flipping with cognate and noncognate substrates (GAATTT, GGATTC) of wild type M.EcoRI using fluorescence resonance energy transfer and 2-aminopurine fluorescence studies reveals that DNA bending precedes both intercalation and base flipping, and base flipping precedes intercalation. Destabilization of these intermediates provides a molecular basis for understanding how conformational transitions contribute to specificity. The 3500- and 23,000-fold decreases in sequence specificity for noncognate sites GAATTT and GGATTC are accounted for largely by an ∼2500-fold increase in the reverse rate constants for intercalation and base flipping, respectively. Thus, a predominant contribution to specificity is a partitioning of enzyme intermediates away from the Michaelis complex prior to catalysis. Our results provide a basis for understanding enzyme specificity and, in particular, sequence-specific DNA modification. Because many DNA methyltransferases and DNA repair enzymes induce similar DNA distortions, these results are likely to be broadly relevant.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3742-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 2Joyce C.M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14317-14324Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Indeed, the lack of our understanding of the underlying causes for specificity may account in part for the general lack of success in re-engineering such enzymes, despite relative successes with other classes of enzymes (3Cohen H.M. Tawfik D.S. Griffiths A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3880-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 4Cohen H.M. Tawfik D.S. Griffiths A.D. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 5Samuelson J.C. Xu S.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Many DNA-modifying enzymes have specificity constants that approach the predicted values for diffusion-controlled reactions (kcat/Km ∼ 108–109 m–1 s–1) (6Wolfenden R. Snider M.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 938-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 7Bruice T.C. Bruice P.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 12478-12479Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). DNA-modifying enzymes have attained such efficiency in part because of facilitated diffusion mechanisms (8Surby M.A. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2201-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Remarkably, such highly efficient enzymes also show significant discrimination between cognate and noncognate sequences. These enzymes frequently undergo significant conformational changes upon binding their cognate sequence, a clear example of an induced fit mechanism. The resultant intermediates provide a theoretical basis for modulating specificity through the concept of kinetic proofreading, as proposed for several DNA polymerases (9Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). These checkpoints can directly impact specificity by modifying the partitioning of reaction intermediates prior to catalysis differentially between cognate and noncognate substrates (9Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 10Ninio J. Biochimie (Paris). 1975; 57: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 11Hopfield J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4135-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). S-Adenosylmethionine-dependent bacterial DNA methyltransferases modify bases at cytosine (C-5 and N-4) and adenine (N-6) and play important roles in many cellular pathways, including mismatch repair, restriction modification, and gene regulation (12Jeltsch A. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 274-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A detailed structural and mechanistic characterization of DNA methyltransferases is also motivated by recent demonstrations that some bacterial and mammalian enzymes are viable candidates for antibiotic and cancer drug development, respectively (13Robertson K.D. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 14Jones P.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

The bacterial DNA adenine methyltransferase EcoRI forms part of a restriction/modification system and modifies the N-6 position of the second adenine in the sequence GAATTC. The schematic and kinetic mechanism of M.EcoRI presented in Scheme 1 represent the chemical and conformational transitions observed during the methylation of cognate DNA. M.EcoRI uses facilitated diffusion to locate and methylate its cognate DNA to protect the bacterial genome from the complement restriction endonuclease (8Surby M.A. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2201-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17Surby M.A. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2209-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Upon location of the target sequence, M.EcoRI induces a 50° bend in the DNA sequence and flips the target adenine out 180° to an extrahelical position to facilitate catalysis. Solution-based FRET 2The abbreviations used are: FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; WT, wild type; 2AP, 2-aminopurine; TAMRA, carboxytetramethylrhodamine.2The abbreviations used are: FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; WT, wild type; 2AP, 2-aminopurine; TAMRA, carboxytetramethylrhodamine. studies were used to demonstrate that along with bending the DNA, M.EcoRI also expands the duplex DNA structure presumably through an intercalative mechanism (18Hopkins B.B. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37049-37060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and intercalation and bending occur nearly simultaneously with DNA binding at 25 °C (18Hopkins B.B. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37049-37060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The specificity constant of M.EcoRI (kcat/Km, ∼107–109 m–1 s–1) for cognate DNA is near the rate of diffusion (8Surby M.A. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2201-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17Surby M.A. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2209-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Reich N.O. Olsen C. Osti F. Murphy J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15802-15807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Mashhoon N. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7113-7119Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Specificity constants for M.EcoRI toward several noncognate sites are decreased 5-fold (A6, GAATCC), 3500-fold (A4, GAATTT), and 23,000-fold (A3, GGATTC), which involve relatively minor changes in DNA affinity (19Reich N.O. Olsen C. Osti F. Murphy J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15802-15807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular basis of this discrimination remains unclear, as is the sequence discrimination for any DNA methyltransferase. We recently described an intriguing bending-impaired M.EcoRI mutant (H235N) whose ability to flip its target adenine is decreased 2000-fold compared with the WT enzyme, whereas the cognate modification was left largely intact (21Allan B.W. Garcia R. Maegley K. Mort J. Wong D. Lindstrom W. Beechem J.M. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19269-19275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, the mutant is at least 1000-fold more discriminating than the WT enzyme (21Allan B.W. Garcia R. Maegley K. Mort J. Wong D. Lindstrom W. Beechem J.M. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19269-19275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of how changes in precatalytic conformational transitions can result in such a profound increase in specificity is the focus of this study. We find that much of the discrimination of the WT enzyme against noncognate DNA occurs from the selective destabilization of precatalytic intermediates. Our results are presented in the context of kinetic proofreading concepts, which provide a quantitative framework for understanding sequence-specific DNA modification. Enzyme Expression and Purification—M.EcoRI was purified from MM294 Escherichia coli cells with the plasmid pXRI as described previously (18Hopkins B.B. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37049-37060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 6 liters of culture were induced with 1mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an A600 0.4 for 3 h. Cells were sonicated in extraction buffer (200 mm NaCl, 6.5 mm K2HPO4, 3.5 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). The lysate was centrifuged (30 min at 4 °C); the supernatant was loaded onto a 20-ml phosphocellulose (Whatman) column, and the protein was eluted with a salt gradient between 200 and 800 mm NaCl. Fractions containing M.EcoRI were loaded onto a 10-ml hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) column equilibrated with extraction buffer. The protein was eluted with a gradient between 6.5 mm and 1 m KH2PO4 and dialyzed overnight in extraction buffer containing 10% glycerol. The dialyzed protein was loaded onto a Bio-Rex (Bio-Rad) column, and the protein was eluted with a gradient of 200 and 800 mm NaCl. Protein from this procedure was typically greater than 95% pure by densitometry. Enzymes were stored at –80 °C with 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.3–0.4 m NaCl, 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, and 7.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. DNA Synthesis and Fluorophore Coupling—DNA oligonucleotides for fluorophore coupling were synthesized at Integrated DNA Technologies containing 5′ C-6 primary amino modifications. 2-Aminopurine (2AP)-containing oligonucleotides were purchased at Midlands DNA with the target adenine replaced by the 2AP nucleotide as follows: 14-mer top strands cognate 5′-AGACGAATTCCGAA, noncognates (A6) 5′-AGACGAATCCCGAA, (A4) 5′-AGACGAATTTCGAA, and (A3) 5′-AGACGGATTCCGAA; and 14-mer bottom strands cognate 5′-TTCGGAATTCGTCT, noncognates (A6) 5′-TTCGGGATTCGTCT, (A4) 5′-TTCGAAATTCGTCT, and (A3) 5′-TTCGGAATGCGTCT. All bottom strand target adenines were methylated to force the orientation of the enzyme to target the top strand. Cognate duplex DNA is defined as cognate bottom methylated. Oligonucleotides for FRET studies were coupled as described previously (18Hopkins B.B. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37049-37060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligonucleotides were resuspended in distilled H2O, extracted with chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended to a final concentration of 25 μg/μl. 6-Alexa Fluor 488 succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes) was coupled to the top strand, whereas 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes) was coupled to the bottom strand. Coupling reactions were performed with 10–20-fold molar excess dye to oligonucleotide. Coupling was carried out overnight in 75 mm sodium tetraborate, pH 8.5. Overnight couplings were ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 0.1 m triethylammonium acetate. Resuspended coupling reactions were purified on an analytical Vydac C4 column with a Waters/Millipore high pressure liquid chromatography system. Purified coupled oligonucleotide concentrations were determined by absorbance scans from 230 to 700 nm and determined to be 100% coupled. Equilibrium Anisotropy—Anisotropy experiments were carried out on a Fluoromax-2 fluorimeter (ISA SPEX) equipped with an L-format autopolarizer. Equilibrium measurements were performed by monitoring the change in anisotropy of 20 nm singly labeled (Alexa-488) duplex DNA as increasing enzyme was titrated into the reaction mix. An excitation of 488 nm and emission of 515 nm with slit widths of 8 nm were used for data collection. Anisotropy was calculated using the following equation; R = I∥ – I⊥/I∥ – 2I⊥ (22Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 367-390Crossref Google Scholar). Dissociation constants were determined by fitting data to the following quadratic formula: f = ((a + x + b) – sqrt(((a + x + b)^2) – 4 × x × a))/2; where b = KD, x = [enzyme] × [DNA], and a = [enzyme-DNA]. Equilibrium FRET—Equilibrium fluorescence experiments were performed as described previously (18Hopkins B.B. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37049-37060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All measurements were collected with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B luminescence spectrometer at 22 °C. Excitation at 485 nm was used to excite Alexa-488, and an emission spectrum from 500 to 650 nm was collected. Enzyme at a final concentration of 200 nm was mixed with 20 nm DNA and 1 μm sinefungin in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The S-adenosylmethionine analogue sinefungin (Sigma) was used for all equilibrium and transient experiments. Stopped-flow FRET—Stopped-flow measurements were collected on an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped-flow reaction analyzer outfitted with a single channel emission photomultiplier tube. An excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission cut-off filter of 515 nm were used for data collection. Coupled DNA was rapidly mixed with M.EcoRI preincubated with sinefungin in reaction buffer. The change of donor fluorophore emission was used to detect bending and intercalation due to the greater signal change for the donor fluorophore during FRET with the acceptor fluorophore (18Hopkins B.B. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37049-37060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). DNA concentrations were 20 nm for cognate DNA and 100 nm for noncognate DNA substrates. Enzyme and cofactor concentrations were varied from 100 to 2000 nm. Error measurements are from at least two experiments with the DNA and enzyme mixes freshly prepared each time. Stopped-flow Flipping—Transient base flipping data for cognate and noncognate substrates were measured in a stopped-flow apparatus by monitoring the increase in fluorescence of 2AP as it transitions from base-stacked to extrahelical in the presence of enzyme. 2AP fluorescence is roughly 14-fold greater when extrahelical, and has been validated previously as a probe for the measurement of base flipping kinetics (23Su T.J. Tock M.R. Egelhaaf S.U. Poon W.C. Dryden D.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3235-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24Rachofsky E.L. Seibert E. Stivers J.T. Osman R. Ross J.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 25Allan B.W. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14757-14762Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 26Allan B.W. Beechem J.M. Lindstrom W.M. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2368-2373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). An excitation wavelength of 310 nm and an emission cut-off filter of 320 nm were used for data collection. 100 nm 2AP containing DNA was rapidly mixed with M.EcoRI preincubated with sinefungin in reaction buffer, monitoring the emission above 320 nm. Enzyme and cofactor concentrations varied between 500 and 2000 nm. Error measurements are from at least two experiments with the DNA and enzyme mixes freshly prepared each time. Reverse Kinetics—Stopped-flow measurements were collected with excitation wavelengths and cut-off filters as described for the FRET and 2AP studies. The rate of extrahelical base restacking was measured by monitoring the dissociation of the preformed 2AP-containing DNA-enzyme complex. The loss of fluorescence is attributed to the restacking of the target base. A final concentration of 100 nm 2AP DNA, 100 nm enzyme, and 6 μm sinefungin were mixed with 5 μm unlabeled competitor DNA. The unbending/unintercalation data were collected by monitoring the change in FRET as a 25–50-fold excess unlabeled cognate DNA was rapidly mixed into the system. All forward and reverse stop flow data were fit to either a single or double exponential equation using the program Sigma Plot. Data Analysis and Simulation—Kinetic simulations to model bending and intercalation data were performed using Scientist (Micromath Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) and KinTekSim (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). Global fitting analysis of 4 °C cognate bending and intercalation data were performed using a two intermediate reaction mechanism. Goodness-of-fit statistics were used to evaluate the fit of the data to the reaction mechanism, yielding an R2 value of 0.99. KinTekSim modeling was done for binding, bending, and intercalation as shown in Scheme 1. Second- and first-order rate constants for the cognate DNA simulation were as follows: kon = 3.0 × 107 m–1 s–1, kbend = 100 s–1, kintercalate = 10 s–1, and kunintercalate = 0.02 s–1 Simulations for noncognate substrates were performed by increasing the unintercalation rate constant to 2000- and 4000-fold. Transient DNA Bending Is Observable with Cognate and Noncognate Substrates—FRET between Alexa-488 and TAMRA coupled to the 5′ ends of 14-mer oligonucleotides was previously used to examine the bending transition of the target DNA by M.EcoRI (18Hopkins B.B. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37049-37060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because cognate DNA bound by M.EcoRI is bent ∼50° as determined by both atomic force microscopy and gel shifting methods (21Allan B.W. Garcia R. Maegley K. Mort J. Wong D. Lindstrom W. Beechem J.M. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19269-19275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27Garcia R.A. Bustamante C.J. Reich N.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7618-7622Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), an increase in energy transfer was anticipated. The opposite changes were observed, consistent with a decreased energy transfer upon protein binding (18Hopkins B.B. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37049-37060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Further analysis revealed the decreased FRET was not dye-dependent, and the anticipated increase in FRET does occur using an enzyme that recognizes the same DNA substrate but only induces DNA bending (18Hopkins B.B. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37049-37060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Hiller D.A. Rodriguez A.M. Perona J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because of the robustness of the decreased FRET M.EcoRI-DNA data, an intercalative mechanism was proposed (18Hopkins B.B. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37049-37060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recent protein/DNA cocrystal structures of T4DAM and E. coli DAM reveal several residues intercalating into the DNA (29Horton J.R. Liebert K. Hattman S. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. Cell. 2005; 121: 349-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 30Horton J.R. Liebert K. Bekes M. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), supporting the concept of intercalation for methyltransferases. Using a FRET-based assay (18Hopkins B.B. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37049-37060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we examined equilibrium and pre-equilibrium kinetics of binding, bending, and intercalation for the cognate sequence with the target adenine in the complement strand methylated (cognate bottom methylated) (GAATTC) and 3 noncognate sequences as follows: A6 (GAATCC), A4 (GAATTT), and A3 (GGATTC). The equilibrium FRET for cognate DNA previously demonstrated a decrease in FRET between the donor and acceptor fluorophores on the DNA. Noncognate A6 also has a decrease in FRET upon M.EcoRI binding similar to the cognate signal, whereas noncognate substrates A3 and A4 have no observable change in FRET (Fig. 1, A–C). To ensure that all analysis on DNA bending, base flipping, and intercalation are of a saturated enzyme substrate complex, the affinity of the enzyme for each substrate was determined. Enzyme KDDNA values were determined by equilibrium anisotropy (data not shown) and are within error of the previously determined KDDNA values obtained by gel mobility shift assays (19Reich N.O. Olsen C. Osti F. Murphy J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15802-15807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme concentrations used in each experiment were more than 3-fold higher than the DNA dissociation constant (KDDNA) to ensure that the enzyme was bound to the substrate. The lack of detectable equilibrium FRET changes with both A4 and A3 may be due to compensatory signal decreases and increases resulting from changes in bending and intercalation, respectively. This was further investigated by measuring the pre-equilibrium kinetics of the FRET-based bending/intercalation experiments on a stopped-flow apparatus. Cognate and noncognate (A6, A4, and A3) substrates with dyes on both 5′ ends, at a concentration of 100 nm, were rapidly mixed with 500 nm M.EcoRI-sinefungin while monitoring the donor signal. We previously demonstrated that M.EcoRI binding to cognate substrate at 25 °C involves a protein concentration-dependent increase in the donor signal consistent with a decrease in FRET (Fig. 2A) (18Hopkins B.B. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37049-37060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Most surprisingly, substrates A4 and A3 show a very rapid decrease in donor signal (130 and 240 s–1, respectively), followed by a slower increase (37 and 22 s–1, respectively) (Fig. 2, C and D). Noncognate A6 has a very rapid decrease in donor signal (rate constants are unattainable), followed by an increase in donor signal with a kobs rate constant of 27 s–1 (Fig. 2B). Based on classical FRET theory (18Hopkins B.B. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37049-37060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 367-390Crossref Google Scholar), we suggest that the initial decrease in the donor signal (increased FRET) is caused by the bending transition (18Hopkins B.B. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37049-37060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Hiller D.A. Rodriguez A.M. Perona J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), whereas the increase in donor signal (decreased FRET) (18Hopkins B.B. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37049-37060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) is caused by intercalation. The assignment of DNA bending to the decrease in the donor signal is further validated in the following section when the decrease in the donor signal is observed for the cognate DNA with the temperature lowered to 4 °C (Fig. 3A). Further support for the assignment of the bending transition to the initial decrease in donor fluorescence is provided by the observed concentration dependence of this phase in the fluorescence data (Fig. 3A). Finally, the cocrystal structure of the endonuclease R.EcoRV bound to the cognate DNA sequence for M.EcoRI GAATTC reveals a significant degree of DNA bending; R.EcoRV binding to this same DNA shows the anticipated decreased donor signal (increased FRET) (28Hiller D.A. Rodriguez A.M. Perona J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations support our assignment that the initial increase in FRET for M.EcoRI is due to DNA bending. The kobs rate constant for the increase in donor signal with the rapid mixing of 20 nm cognate DNA with 500 nm M.EcoRI is 10 s–1 (18Hopkins B.B. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37049-37060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Under similar conditions the exponential fits for the donor signal increases of A4 and A3 (37 and 22 s–1, respectively) are faster than the cognate increase in donor signal (Fig. 2, A, C and D). The faster rate constants for A4 and A3 arise from a faster approach to equilibrium for these noncognates versus cognates. DNA Bending Precedes Intercalation with the Cognate Site— Our previous results showed that cognate DNA binding, bending, and intercalation are nearly simultaneous (18Hopkins B.B. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37049-37060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, based on the biphasic FRET signal observed with the noncognate substrates, tentatively assigned to rapid bending followed by slower intercalation (Fig. 2, B–D), we sought to deconvolute these events with cognate DNA and M.EcoRI at 4 °C. Upon rapidly mixing M.EcoRI with cognate DNA, an initial decrease in the donor signal followed by a slower increase was observed. The small, but reproducible, decrease in signal occurs in the initial 25 ms of data collection (Fig. 3A). As stated above, the increase in FRET is most reasonably assigned to the anticipated changes resulting from a bending transition (28Hiller D.A. Rodriguez A.M. Perona J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 31Hiller D.A. Fogg J.M. Martin A.M. Beechem J.M. Reich N.O. Perona J.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14375-14385Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 32Parkhurst K.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7459-7465Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This is followed by a decrease in FRET that has been assigned to the intercalation of the DNA by the enzyme (18Hopkins B.B. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37049-37060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Measurement of the rate constant for intercalation with varying M.EcoRI concentrations (100, 300, 500, 700, and 1400 nm) and constant cognate DNA (20 nm) reveals that at high concentrations the rate of intercalation (donor signal increase) does not increase linearly with enzyme concentration (Fig. 3B). The mild concentration dependence of the intercalation data suggests that intercalation is only partially second order (Fig. 3B) (33Johnson K.A. Sigman D.S. The Enzymes. Elsevier/Academic Press, San Diego, CA1992: 1-61Google Scholar). Furthermore, because the bending transition remains concentration-dependent, this step continues to be simultaneous with DNA binding. The intercalation signal for cognate DNA is the only observable signal at 22 °C (Fig. 2A), and it was previously shown that the rate of intercalation increases linearly with increasing enzyme concentration at 22 °C (18Hopkins B.B. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37049-37060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The concentration dependence for intercalation of cognate DNA at 22 °C suggests that both bending and intercalation are nearly simultaneous with binding (18Hopkins B.B. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37049-37060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The new signal at 4 °C (Fig. 3A), which we assign to bending for cognate DNA, demonstrates that bending precedes intercalation. We therefore focused subsequent bending and intercalation studies of noncognate substrates at 4 °C (see below). The decrease in the signal amplitudes for the intercalation phase with the noncognates A4 and A3 in comparison to cognate DNA (Fig. 2, C and D versus A) suggests a significantly altered protein/DNA interaction.

Each of the three CNT family members has a distinct specificity for naturally occurring nucleosides, and residues that contribute to the specificity of each transporter have been identified. In contrast, the molecular determinants of specificity for synthetic nucleoside analogs are not known. In this study, we take advantage of the large species difference that exists between human and rat CNT2 (hCNT2 and rCNT2) in their ability to transport the nucleoside analog drug cladribine, 2CdA, (rCNT2 > > > hCNT2) to identify the critical domains and amino acid residues that contribute to the observed difference in specificity between CNT2 orthologs. Using chimeric proteins of human and rat CNT2, we determined that the C-terminal half of CNT2 contained the determinants of 2CdA selectivity. We replaced key residues in the C terminus of hCNT2 with the equivalent residue in rCNT2. One residue in the C-terminal portion of CNT2 was found to significantly contribute to 2CdA selectivity: hCNT2-S354A. This mutant caused an increase of 5-6-fold over hCNT2. The 2-chloro pharmacophore, rather than the 2′-deoxyribose was responsible for the reduced 2CdA uptake by hCNT2. Our data are consistent with a model in which an increased capability for hydrogen bonding in critical amino acids that reside in the C terminus of rCNT2 contributes to its enhanced selectivity for 2CdA."
