https://openalex.org/W2526468162,"Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a fundamental concept in many areas of physics, ranging from cosmology and particle physics to condensed matter. A prime example is the breaking of spatial translation symmetry, which underlies the formation of crystals and the phase transition from liquid to solid. Analogous to crystals in space, the breaking of translation symmetry in time and the emergence of a ""time crystal"" was recently proposed, but later shown to be forbidden in thermal equilibrium. However, non-equilibrium Floquet systems subject to a periodic drive can exhibit persistent time-correlations at an emergent sub-harmonic frequency. This new phase of matter has been dubbed a ""discrete time crystal"" (DTC). Here, we present the first experimental observation of a discrete time crystal, in an interacting spin chain of trapped atomic ions. We apply a periodic Hamiltonian to the system under many-body localization (MBL) conditions, and observe a sub-harmonic temporal response that is robust to external perturbations. Such a time crystal opens the door for studying systems with long-range spatial-temporal correlations and novel phases of matter that emerge under intrinsically non-equilibrium conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2540688686,"Understanding quantum dynamics away from equilibrium is an outstanding challenge in the modern physical sciences. It is well known that out-of-equilibrium systems can display a rich array of phenomena, ranging from self-organized synchronization to dynamical phase transitions. More recently, advances in the controlled manipulation of isolated many-body systems have enabled detailed studies of non-equilibrium phases in strongly interacting quantum matter. As a particularly striking example, the interplay of periodic driving, disorder, and strong interactions has recently been predicted to result in exotic ""time-crystalline"" phases, which spontaneously break the discrete time-translation symmetry of the underlying drive. Here, we report the experimental observation of such discrete time-crystalline order in a driven, disordered ensemble of $\sim 10^6$ dipolar spin impurities in diamond at room-temperature. We observe long-lived temporal correlations at integer multiples of the fundamental driving period, experimentally identify the phase boundary and find that the temporal order is protected by strong interactions; this order is remarkably stable against perturbations, even in the presence of slow thermalization. Our work opens the door to exploring dynamical phases of matter and controlling interacting, disordered many-body systems."
https://openalex.org/W2501783443,"The highest-density magnetic storage media will code data in single-atom bits. To date, the smallest individually addressable bistable magnetic bits on surfaces consist of 5-12 atoms. Long magnetic relaxation times were demonstrated in molecular magnets containing one lanthanide atom, and recently in ensembles of single holmium (Ho) atoms supported on magnesium oxide (MgO). Those experiments indicated the possibility for data storage at the fundamental limit, but it remained unclear how to access the individual magnetic centers. Here we demonstrate the reading and writing of individual Ho atoms on MgO, and show that they independently retain their magnetic information over many hours. We read the Ho states by tunnel magnetoresistance and write with current pulses using a scanning tunneling microscope. The magnetic origin of the long-lived states is confirmed by single-atom electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) on a nearby Fe sensor atom, which shows that Ho has a large out-of-plane moment of $(10.1 \pm 0.1)$ $\mu_{\rm B}$ on this surface. In order to demonstrate independent reading and writing, we built an atomic scale structure with two Ho bits to which we write the four possible states and which we read out remotely by EPR. The high magnetic stability combined with electrical reading and writing shows that single-atom magnetic memory is possible."

Background It is uncertain whether being overweight, but not obese, is associated with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and how the size and shape of associations between body-mass index (BMI) and advanced CKD differs among different types of people. Methods We used Clinical Practice Research Datalink records (2000-2014) with linkage to English secondary care and mortality data to identify a prospective cohort with at least one BMI measure. Cox models adjusted for age, sex, smoking and social deprivation and subgroup analyses by diabetes, hypertension and prior cardiovascular disease assessed relationships between BMI and CKD stages 4-5 and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Findings 1,405,016 adults aged 20-79 with mean BMI 27.4kg/m2 (SD 5.6) were followed for 7.5 years. Compared to a BMI of 20 to <25kg/m2 , higher BMI was associated with a progressively increased risk of CKD stages 4-5 (hazard ratio 1.34, 95% CI 1.30-1.38 for BMI 25 to <30kg/m2 ; 1.94, 1.87-2.01 for BMI 30 to <35kg/m2 ; and 3.10, 2.95-3.25 for BMI o35kg/m2 ). The association between BMI and ESRD was shallower and reversed at low BMI. Current smoking, prior diabetes, hypertension or cardiovascular disease all increased risk of CKD, but the relative strength and shape of BMI-CKD associations, which were generally log-linear above a BMI of 25kg/m2 , were similar among those with and without these risk factors. There was direct evidence that being overweight was associated with increased risk of CKD stages 4-5 in these subgroups. Assuming causality, since 2000 an estimated 39% (36-42%) of advanced CKD in women and 26% (22-30%) in men aged 40-79 resulted from being overweight or obese. Conclusions This study provides direct evidence that being overweight increases risk of advanced CKD, that being obese substantially increases such risk, and that this remains true for those with and without diabetes, hypertension or cardiovascular disease. Strategies to reduce weight among those who are overweight, as well as those who are obese may reduce CKD risk, with each unit reduction in BMI yielding similar relative reductions in risk."
https://openalex.org/W2592585334,"Background Alcohol and marijuana are the two most abused substances in US colleges. However, research on the combined influence (cross sectional or longitudinal) of these substances on academic performance is currently scant. Methods Data were derived from the longitudinal 2-year Brain and Alcohol Research in College Students (BARCS) study including 1142 freshman students who completed monthly marijuana use and alcohol consumption surveys. Subjects were classified into data-driven groups based on their alcohol and marijuana consumption. A linear mixed-model (LMM) was employed using this grouping factor to predict grade point average (GPA), adjusted for a variety of socio-demographic and clinical factors. Results Three data-driven clusters emerged: 1) No/low users of both, 2) medium-high alcohol/no-low marijuana, and 3) medium-high users of both substances. Individual cluster derivations between consecutive semesters remained stable. No significant interaction between clusters and semester (time) was noted. Post-hoc analysis suggest that at the outset, compared to sober peers, students using moderate to high levels of alcohol and low marijuana demonstrate lower GPAs, but this difference becomes non-significant over time. In contrast, students consuming both substances at moderate-to-high levels score significantly lower at both the outset and across the 2-year investigation period. Our follow-up analysis also indicate that when students curtailed their substance use over time they had significantly higher academic GPA compared to those who remained stable in their substance use patterns over the two year period. Conclusions Overall, our study validates and extends the current literature by providing important implications of concurrent alcohol and marijuana use on academic achievement in college."
https://openalex.org/W2594706212,"High-frequency (HF) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is the gold standard for the treatment of medically refractory movement disorders like Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia, with a significant potential for application to other neurological diseases. The standard setup of HF DBS utilizes an open-loop stimulation protocol, where a permanent HF electrical pulse train is administered to the brain target areas irrespectively of the ongoing neuronal dynamics. Recent experimental and clinical studies demonstrate that a closed-loop, adaptive DBS might be superior to the open-loop setup. We here combine the notion of the adaptive high-frequency stimulation approach, that aims at delivering stimulation adapted to the extent of appropriately detected biomarkers, with specifically desynchronizing stimulation protocols. To this end, we extend the delayed feedback stimulation methods, which are intrinsically closed-loop techniques and specifically designed to desynchronize abnormal neuronal synchronization, to pulsatile electrical brain stimulation. We show that permanent pulsatile high-frequency stimulation subjected to an amplitude modulation by linear or nonlinear delayed feedback methods can effectively and robustly desynchronize a STN-GPe network of model neurons and suggest this approach for desynchronizing closed-loop DBS."
https://openalex.org/W2591993525,"The fish subfamily Poeciliinae (sensu Parenti, 1981) is widely distributed across the Western Hemisphere and a dominant component of the fish communities of Central America. Poeciliids have figured prominently in previous studies on the roles of dispersal and vicariance in shaping current geographic distributions. Most recently, Hrbek et al. combined a DNA-based phylogeny of the family with geological models to provide a biogeographic perspective that emphasized the role of both vicariance and dispersal. Here we expand on that effort with a database enlarged in the quantity of sequence represented per species, in the number of species included, and in an enlarged and more balanced representation of the order Cyprinodontiformes. We combine a robust timetree based upon multiple fossil calibrations with enhanced biogeographic analyses that include ancestral area reconstructions to provide a detailed biogeographic history of this clade. Key features of our results are that the family originated in South America, but its major diversification dates to a later colonization of Central America. We also resolve additional colonizations among South, Central and North America and the Caribbean and consider how this reconstruction contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms of dispersal."
https://openalex.org/W2594183808,"To develop superior rice varieties with improved yield in most rainfed areas of Asia/Africa, we started an introgression-breeding program for simultaneously improving yield and tolerances of multiple abiotic stresses. Using eight BC1 populations derived from a widely adaptable recipient and eight donors plus three rounds of phenotypic selection, we developed 496 introgression lines (ILs) with significantly higher yield under drought, salt and/or non-stress conditions in 5 years. Six new varieties were released in the Philippines and Pakistan and many more are being evaluated in multi-location yield trials for releasing in several countries. Marker-facilitated genetic characterization revealed three interesting aspects of the breeding procedure: (1) the donor introgression pattern in specific BC populations was characteristic; (2) introgression frequency in different genomic regions varied considerably, resulting primarily from strong selection for the target traits; and (3) significantly lower heterozygosity was observed in BC progenies selected for drought and salinity tolerance. Applying strong phenotypic selection under abiotic stresses in early segregating generations has major advantages for not only improving multiple abiotic stress tolerance but also achieving quicker homozygosity in early generations. This breeding procedure can be easily adopted by small breeding programs in developing countries to develop high-yielding varieties tolerant of abiotic stresses. The large set of trait-specific ILs can be used for genetic mapping of genes/QTL that affect target and non-target traits and for efficient varietal development by designed QTL pyramiding and genomics-based recurrent selection in our Green Super Rice breeding technology."
https://openalex.org/W2593376557,"Although considered rare, airborne pollen can be deposited far from its place of origin under a confluence of favorable conditions. Temporally anomalous records of Cupressacean pollen collected from January air samples in London, Ontario, Canada have been cited as a new case of long-distance transport. Data on pollination season implicated Juniperus ashei (mountain cedar), with populations in central Texas and south central Oklahoma, as the nearest source of the Cupressacean pollen in the Canadian air samples. This finding is of special significance given the allergenicity of mountain cedar pollen. While microscopy is used extensively to identify particles in the air spora, pollen from all members of the Cupressaceae, including Juniperus, are morphologically indistinguishable. Consequently, we implemented a molecular approach to characterize Juniperus pollen using PCR in order to test the long-distance transport hypothesis. Our PCR results using species-specific primers confirmed that the anomalous Cupressacean pollen collected in Canada was from J. ashei. Forward trajectory analysis from source areas in Texas and the Arbuckle Mountains in Oklahoma and backward trajectory analysis from the destination area near London, Ontario were completed using models implemented in HYSPLIT4 (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory). Results from these trajectory analyses strongly supported the conclusion that the J. ashei pollen detected in Canada had its origins in Texas or Oklahoma. The results from the molecular findings are significant as they provide a new method to confirm the long-distance transport of pollen that bears allergenic importance."
https://openalex.org/W2592202695,"A Pseudomonas aeruginosa AUST-02 strain sub-type (M3L7) has been identified in Australia, infects the lungs of some people with cystic fibrosis and is associated with antibiotic resistance. Multiple clonal lineages may emerge during treatment with mutations in chromosomally encoded antibiotic resistance genes commonly observed. Here we describe the within-host diversity and antibiotic resistance of M3L7 during and after antibiotic treatment of an acute pulmonary exacerbation using whole genome sequencing and show both variation and shared mutations in important genes. Eleven isolates from an M3L7 population (n = 134) isolated over 3 months from an individual with cystic fibrosis underwent whole genome sequencing. A phylogeny based on core genome SNPs identified three distinct phylogenetic groups comprising two groups with higher rates of mutation (hypermutators) and one non-hypermutator group. Genomes were screened for acquired antibiotic resistance genes with the result suggesting that M3L7 resistance is principally driven by chromosomal mutations as no acquired mechanisms were detected. Small genetic variations, shared by all 11 isolates, were found in 49 genes associated with antibiotic resistance including frame-shift mutations (mexA, mexT), premature stop codons (oprD, mexB) and mutations in quinolone-resistance determining regions (gyrA, parE). However, whole genome sequencing also revealed mutations in 21 genes that were acquired following divergence of groups, which may also impact the activity of antibiotics and multi-drug efflux pumps. Comparison of mutations with minimum inhibitory concentrations of anti-pseudomonal antibiotics could not easily explain all resistance profiles observed. These data further demonstrate the complexity of chronic and antibiotic resistant P. aeruginosa infection where a multitude of co-existing genotypically diverse sub-lineages might co-exist during and after intravenous antibiotic treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2591966067,"Childhood wasting is a global problem and is significantly more pronounced in low and middle income countries like Bangladesh. Socio Economic Status (SES) and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) practices may be significantly associated with wasting. Most previous research is consistent about the role of SES, but the significance of WASH in the context of wasting remains ambiguous. The effect of SES and WASH on weight for length (WHZ) is examined using a Structural Equation Model (SEM) to explicitly describe the direct and indirect role of WASH in the context of SES.A nationally representative survey of 10,478 Bangladeshi children under 5 were examined. An expert defined SEM was used to construct latent variables for SES and WASH. The SEM included a direct pathway from SES to WHZ and an indirect pathway from SES to WHZ via WASH along with regression of relevant covariates on the outcome WHZ and the latent variables. Both SES (p<0.01) and WASH (p<0.05) significantly affect WHZ. SES (p<0.01) also significantly affects WASH. Other structural components showed that child's age (p<0.01) affects WHZ and types of residence (p<0.01) affects SES. WASH practices at least partially mediate the association between SES and wasting status. WASH and SES are both significantly associated with WHZ."
https://openalex.org/W2594486683,"Morphological traits can be highly variable over time in a particular geographical area. Different selective pressures shape those traits, which is crucial in evolutionary biology. Among these traits, insect wing morphometry has already been widely used to describe phenotypic variability at the inter-specific level. On the contrary, fewer studies have focused on intra-specific wing morphometric variability. Yet, such investigations are relevant to study potential convergences of variation that could highlight micro-evolutionary processes. The recent sampling and sequencing of three solitary bees of the genus Melitta across their entire species range provides an excellent opportunity to jointly analyse genetic and morphometric variability. In the present study, we first aim to analyse the spatial distribution of the wing shape and centroid size (used as a proxy for body size) variability. Secondly, we aim to test different potential predictors of this variability at both the intra- and inter-population levels, which includes genetic variability, but also geographic locations and distances, elevation, annual mean temperature and precipitation. The comparison of spatial distribution of intra-population morphometric diversity does not reveal any convergent pattern between species, thus undermining the assumption of a potential local and selective adaptation at the population level. Regarding intra-specific wing shape differentiation, our results reveal that some tested predictors, such as geographic and genetic distances, are associated with a significant correlation for some species. However, none of these predictors are systematically identified for the three species as an important factor that could explain the intra-specific morphometric variability. As a conclusion, for the three solitary bee species and at the scale of this study, our results clearly tend to discard the assumption of the existence of a common pattern of intra-specific signal/structure within the intra-specific wing shape and body size variability."
https://openalex.org/W2593354953,"Melanoma therapy is challenging, especially in advanced cases, due to multiple developed tumor defense mechanisms. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) might represent an adjuvant treatment, because of its bimodal action: tumor destruction and immune system awakening. In this study, a combination of PDT mediated by a metal substituted phthalocyanine-Gallium phthalocyanine chloride (GaPc) and Metformin was used against melanoma. The study aimed to: (1) find the anti-melanoma efficacy of GaPc-PDT, (2) assess possible beneficial effects of Metformin addition to PDT, (3) uncover some of the mechanisms underlining cell killing and anti-angiogenic effects.Two human lightly pigmented melanoma cell lines: WM35 and M1/15 subjected to previous Metformin exposure were treated by GaPc-PDT. Cell viability, death mechanism, cytoskeleton alterations, oxidative damage, were assessed by means of colorimetry, flowcytometry, confocal microscopy, spectrophotometry, ELISA, Western Blotting.GaPc proved an efficient photosensitizer. Metformin addition enhanced cell killing by mechanisms dependent on the cell line, namely apoptosis in the metastatic M1/15 and necrosis in the radial growth phase, WM35. Cell death mechanism relied on the inhibition of nuclear transcription factor (NF)-κB activation and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) sensitization, leading to TRAIL and TNF-α induced apoptosis. Metformin diminished the anti-angiogenic effect of PDT.Metformin addition to GaPc-PDT increased tumor cell killing through enhanced oxidative damage and induction of proapoptotic mechanisms, but altered PDT anti-angiogenic effects.Combination of Metformin and PDT might represent a solution to enhance the efficacy, leading to a potential adjuvant role of PDT in melanoma therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2591818818,"Einkorn (Triticum monococcum L.) is A-genome diploid wheat that has a potential to become a useful model for understanding the biology and genomics in Triticeae. Unfortunately, the application of modern technologies such as genetic engineering, RNAi-based gene silencing and genome editing is not available for einkorn as there is no efficient in vitro tissue culture and plant regeneration system. In the present study an efficient and simple protocol for plant regeneration via direct or indirect somatic embryogenesis and organogenesis has been developed. Various auxins used as sole inductors in einkorn displayed low effect for morphogenesis (0–8%) and plant regeneration (1–2 shoots per explant). The addition of Daminozide, the inhibitor of biosynthesis of gibberellins, together with auxin significantly improved the formation of morphogenic structures, especially when Dicamba (51.4%) and Picloram (56.6%) were used for combination; furthermore, the simultaneous addition of cytokinin into induction medium significantly promoted in vitro performance. Among the tested cytokinins, the urea-type substances, such as TDZ and CPPU were more effective than the adenine type ones, BA and Zeatin, for the regulation of morphogenesis; especially, TDZ was more effective than CPPU for shoot formation (11.73 vs. 7.04 per regenerating callus). The highest morphogenic response of 90.2% with the production of more than 10 shoots per initial explant was observed when 3.0 mg/L Dicamba, 50.0 mg/L Daminozide and 0.25 mg/L TDZ were combined together. Along with the identification of appropriate induction medium, the optimal developmental stage for einkorn was found as partially transparent immature embryo in size of around 1.0 mm. Although in the present study the critical balance between plant growth regulators was established for einkorn only, we assume that further the proposed strategy could be successfully applied to other recalcitrant cereal species and genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2592306371,"Non-restorative sleep (NRS) was suggested to be associated with cardiovascular outcomes. However, causative factors for NRS have not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to clarify factors and their relationships with NRS to better understand the clinical and epidemiological implications of NRS and to develop a score that can objectively evaluate NRS status.Study subjects consisted of 9,788 community residents (age 53.6 ± 13.4 y). Subjective NRS as well as possible clinical and lifestyle factors for NRS were investigated by questionnaires. Other clinical parameters were obtained from personal records of information obtained at the baseline examination.A total of 3,261 participants complained of NRS. Factors independently associated with subjective NRS were younger age (odds ratio = 1.43), use of a hypnotic drug (2.04), irregular sleep schedule (2.02), short sleep duration (<5 h, 11.7; 5-6 h, 4.81; 6-7 h, 2.40), frequent sleepiness (2.33), routine stress (4.63), no habitual exercise (1.61), nocturia symptoms (1.43), symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (1.44), and depression (1.46) (all P <0.001). The NRS score comprised of these 10 factors was linearly associated with the frequency of subjective NRS (Ptrend <0.001). Frequency of individuals with a high NRS score was greater in women (52.3%) than in men (42.1%, P<0.001), while no clear association was observed with common risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.NRS was a phenomenon representing various clinical and lifestyle features. Careful attention should be paid to individuals with a high NRS score who might be at risk for mental fatigue and have unfavorable lifestyle factors."
https://openalex.org/W2593741992,"Background This study was performed to investigate the disease burden of seasonal influenza in adults ≥20 years of age in Korea, based on surveillance data from the Hospital-based Influenza Morbidity & Mortality Surveillance (HIMM) network. Materials and methods The HIMM network is composed of two surveillance systems: emergency room-based and inpatients-based surveillance. A total of ten university hospitals all over the country are included in the surveillance network. The adult catchment population of the HIMM network was calculated by using the data of each hospital and the database of the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) of Korea. The incidence rates of laboratory-confirmed medically-attended influenza, laboratory-confirmed influenza-related admission and laboratory-confirmed influenza-related death were calculated based on the catchment population. The socioeconomic burden of influenza was estimated using the human capital approach. Results During the 2013–2014 influenza season, the calculated adult catchment population of the HIMM network was 1,380,000. The incidence of medically-attended laboratory-confirmed influenza infection was 242.8 per 100,000 adults. The incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza-related admission was 57.9 per 100,000 adults. The incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza-related death was 3.1 per 100,000 adults. The total socioeconomic cost of 2013–2014 seasonal influenza in Korean adult population was estimated as 125 million USD (1 USD = 1,100 KRW). Conclusion The disease burden of 2013–2014 seasonal influenza in Korean adult population is very high and indicates that more active prevention and control policies will be needed to decrease the burden. Additional researches will be needed to assess the burden of seasonal influenza in the Korean child population."
https://openalex.org/W2593260618,"The leucine-rich G protein-coupled receptor-5 (LGR5) is expressed in adult tissue stem cells of many epithelia, and its overexpression is negatively correlated with cancer prognosis. LGR5 potentiates WNT/β-catenin signaling through its unique constitutive internalization property that clears negative regulators of the WNT-receptor complex from the membrane. However, both the mechanism and physiological relevance of LGR5 internalization are unclear. Therefore, a natural product library was screened to discover LGR5 internalization inhibitors and gain mechanistic insight into LGR5 internalization. The plant lignan justicidin B blocked the constitutive internalization of LGR5. Justicidin B is structurally similar to more potent vacuolar-type H+-ATPase inhibitors, which all inhibited LGR5 internalization by blocking clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We then tested the physiological relevance of LGR5 internalization blockade in vivo. A LGR5-rainbow (LBOW) mouse line was engineered to express three different LGR5 isoforms along with unique fluorescent protein lineage reporters in the same mouse. In this manner, the effects of each isoform on cell fate can be simultaneously assessed through simple fluorescent imaging for each lineage reporter. LBOW mice express three different forms of LGR5, a wild-type form that constitutively internalizes and two mutant forms whose internalization properties have been compromised by genetic perturbations within the carboxyl-terminal tail. LBOW was activated in the intestinal epithelium, and a year-long lineage-tracing course revealed that genetic blockade of LGR5 internalization diminished cell fitness.

In addition, the extracellular matrix-associated protein Norrin was also described as another endogenous high-affinity ligand that could potentiate WNT/βcatenin signaling (14Deng C. Reddy P. Cheng Y. Luo C.W. Hsiao C.L. Hsueh A.J. Multi-functional norrin is a ligand for the LGR4 receptor.J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126: 2060-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 33410-33415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, none of these ligands were able to stimulate canonical GPCR signaling. This includes both G protein coupling and recruitment of the GPCR adaptor protein βarrestin (16Ferguson S.S. Downey 3rd, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Ménard L. Caron M.G. Role of β-arrestin in mediating agonist-promoted G protein-coupled receptor internalization.Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). This is surprising given the fact that LGR5, in addition to its prototypical seven-transmembrane domain, possesses both the discrete “DRY” motif in the second intracellular loop necessary for G protein signaling and a serine cluster in the carboxyl-terminal tail (amino acids 873–875) necessary for βarrestin recruitment. In fact, LGR5 can recruit βarrestin when G protein-coupled receptor kinases are overexpressed. As would be expected, this “SSS” cluster at amino acids 873–875 is necessary for this response (17Snyder J.C. Rochelle L.K. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. The stem cell-expressed receptor Lgr5 possesses canonical and functionally active molecular determinants critical to β-arrestin-2 recruitment.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e84476Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore, although Rspondins and Norrin can serve as endogenous ligands for LGR4–6, the molecular details of canonical GPCR signaling are likely still incomplete. Despite the inability to describe canonical GPCR signaling modes for LGR5, it is becoming clear that the trafficking of LGR5 might be one critical feature underlying its signaling (18Snyder J.C. Rochelle L.K. Marion S. Lyerly H.K. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Lgr4 and Lgr5 drive the formation of long actin-rich cytoneme-like membrane protrusions.J.

At steady state, most rhodopsin-like GPCRs (e.g. dopamine D2 receptor (D2R)) are expressed at the plasma membrane and internalized upon ligand binding. Once activated, the receptor is desensitized following phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases, recruitment of βarrestin, and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (16Ferguson S.S. Downey 3rd, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Ménard L. Caron M.G.

U.S.A. 1999; 96: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). In contrast, LGR5 is constitutively internalized from the plasma membrane in the absence of a ligand and in a dynamin-dependent manner (23Snyder J.C. Rochelle L.K. Lyerly H.K. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Constitutive internalization of the leucine-rich G protein-coupled receptor-5 (LGR5) to the trans-Golgi network.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 10286-10297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that in the absence of exogenous ligand, LGR5 constitutively internalizes from the plasma membrane and that this process is likely regulated by phosphorylation at Ser861/Ser864 in the carboxyl-terminal tail (23Snyder J.C. Rochelle L.K. Lyerly H.K. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Constitutive internalization of the leucine-rich G protein-coupled receptor-5 (LGR5) to the trans-Golgi network.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 10286-10297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We found that the half-life of LGR5 on the plasma membrane was approximately 5 min and that upon internalization LGR5 transited through early endosomes and late endosomes and was chaperoned to the trans-Golgi network. The upstream events regulating the internalization of LGR5 are still unclear, but preliminary evidence indicates that clathrin may be involved (19Carmon K.S. Lin Q. Gong X. Thomas A. Liu Q. LGR5 interacts and cointernalizes with Wnt receptors to modulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32: 2054-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, the use of inhibitors with pleiotropic effects has precluded a firm description of the early events in LGR5 internalization. In vitro evidence does indicate that internalization and trafficking of LGR5 are the primary mode for regulating its function (19Carmon K.S. Lin Q. Gong X. Thomas A. Liu Q. LGR5 interacts and cointernalizes with Wnt receptors to modulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32: 2054-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). More recently, we demonstrated that genetically blocking the internalization of LGR5 by truncating the carboxyl-terminal tail results in remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and promotes the formation of very long signaling-competent filopodia (18Snyder J.C. Rochelle L.K. Marion S. Lyerly H.K. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Lgr4 and Lgr5 drive the formation of long actin-rich cytoneme-like membrane protrusions.J. Cell Sci. 2015; 128: 1230-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Together these data illustrate that the internalization of LGR5 and its trafficking may be determinants of its signaling. As such, the internalization of LGR5 could control stem cell fate and thereby play multifaceted roles in development, epithelial homeostasis, and tumorigenesis. However, clarity in the initial events driving internalization of LGR5 is lacking. In addition, the in vivo physiological relevance for its unique internalization program is unknown. Therefore, in this study, we clarify the mechanism driving the initial stages of LGR5 internalization by screening for and characterizing pharmacological inhibitors of its endocytosis. We also provide in vivo proof-of-concept evidence that the clathrin-mediated internalization of LGR5 is critical to regulating intestinal epithelial homeostasis and that future pharmacological blockade of LGR5 internalization could be used to control this process. Recently we described a high-throughput screen (HTS) based upon an infrared fluorogen-activating protein (IRFAP) that can be cloned onto the amino terminus of GPCRs (24Snyder J.C. Pack T.F. Rochelle L.K. Chakraborty S.K. Zhang M. Eaton A.W. Bai Y. Ernst L.A. Barak L.S. Waggoner A.S. Caron M.G. A rapid and affordable screening platform for membrane protein trafficking.BMC Biol. 2015; 13: 107Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This IRFAP-HTS was used to screen a natural product library (NPL) for LGR5 internalization inhibitors. NPLs have high chemical diversity (25Harvey A.L. Edrada-Ebel R. Quinn R.J. The re-emergence of natural products for drug discovery in the genomics era.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2015; 14: 111-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar), are more diverse than combinatorial libraries, and offer diversity similar to that of their cognate biological targets (26Feher M. Schmidt J.M. Property distributions: differences between drugs, natural products, and molecules from combinatorial chemistry.J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 2003; 43: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). The previously described U2OS cell line that stably expresses an IRFAP-HTS-compatible LGR5 (Mars1-LGR5-EGFP) was screened overnight against a library of 720 natural products. This screen was repeated three times and on 3 separate days to identify the most reproducible and high-likelihood candidate hits. These hits are distinguished as true actives (gray and black) and true inactives (white) (Fig. 1A). True actives are those hits that repeated in two of three experiments, whereas true inactives are those that did not repeat (27Coma I. Clark L. Diez E. Harper G. Herranz J. Hofmann G. Lennon M. Richmond N. Valmaseda M. Macarron R. Process validation and screen reproducibility in high-throughput screening.J. Biomol. Screen. 2009; 14: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We focused on those hits that repeated across all three screens and termed these “high”-true actives (black) (Fig. 1A). Raw data, hit analysis, and experimental details for screening are presented in supplemental File 1. High-true actives reproducibly increased the cell surface expression of LGR5 from ∼2- to 8-fold above the vehicle-treated control (Fig. 1B). The previously described glucocorticoid derivatives, which modestly increase LGR5 cell surface expression, were among these hits and thereby validate this screen and confirm previous findings (Fig. 1B, yellow) (24Snyder J.C. Pack T.F. Rochelle L.K. Chakraborty S.K. Zhang M. Eaton A.W. Bai Y. Ernst L.A. Barak L.S. Waggoner A.S. Caron M.G. A rapid and affordable screening platform for membrane protein trafficking.BMC Biol. 2015; 13: 107Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Two plant products were also found to induce a significantly higher increase in LGR5 surface expression compared with all other high-true actives. The arylnaphthalene lignan 9-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-6,7-dimethoxy-naphtho[2,3-c]furan-1(3H)-one (justicidin B) isolated from the Justicia genus (28Hemmati S. Seradj H. Justicidin B: a promising bioactive lignan.Molecules. 2016; 21: E820Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) increased LGR5 surface expression ∼7-fold above vehicle (Fig. 1, B and C, green). The alkaloid berbamine (red) isolated from the Berberis genus (29Ruiz A. Zapata M. Sabando C. Bustamante L. von Baer D. Vergara C. Mardones C. Flavonols, alkaloids, and antioxidant capacity of edible wild berberis species from Patagonia.J. Agric. Food Chem. 2014; 62: 12407-12417Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 30Greathouse G.A. Rigler N.E. Isolation of the alkaloids, berberine and berbamine, from Mahonia swaseyi.Plant Physiol. 1940; 15: 563-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) increased LGR5 surface ∼10-fold above vehicle but was later found to be due to a library contaminant. Therefore, we focused on justicidin B. LGR5 trafficking was visualized in living cells to validate IRFAP-HTS and characterize the kinetics of the justicidin B response. Confocal imaging of LGR5-EGFP was performed by acquiring images every 30 min for 15.5 h. We previously demonstrated that LGR5 constitutively internalizes from the plasma membrane and accumulates in the trans-Golgi network (23Snyder J.C. Rochelle L.K. Lyerly H.K. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Constitutive internalization of the leucine-rich G protein-coupled receptor-5 (LGR5) to the trans-Golgi network.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 10286-10297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, as expected, LGR5 was found primarily in intracellular vesicles and in a perinuclear distribution immediately after stimulus (Fig. 2A). In contrast, approximately 2 h after justicidin B treatment, appreciable surface expression of LGR5 could be observed (Fig. 2B). The surface expression of LGR5 continued to increase throughout the time course and reached a peak 15.5 h post-treatment (Fig. 2, C–E). IRFAP detection was used to quantify this time-course analysis of membrane redistribution in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2F). The EC50 for justicidin B was ∼1–2 μm for each time course (2 h, 0.8 μm; 4 h, 0.6 μm; 6 h, 2.4 μm; and 24 h, 1.7 μm). These data confirm the findings of the IRFAP-HTS assay and indicate that the effects of justicidin B can be observed as early as 2 h after treatment. Justicidin B could act by either increasing the rate of receptor recycling or by directly inhibiting internalization of the receptor. Our live cell imaging for LGR5-EGFP trafficking (Fig. 2) suggests that justicidin B inhibits the internalization of LGR5. To test this hypothesis, we utilized the Mars1-LGR5-EGFP cell line and pulse-labeled the cell-surface pool of LGR5 with the membrane-impermeant SCi1 probe after overnight incubation with justicidin B. Vehicle-treated cells possessed weak SCi1 staining of membrane-localized LGR5 that accumulated in intracellular vesicles (Fig. 3A). As expected, cells treated with either 2 μm justicidin B or 20 μm justicidin B possessed greater SCi1 staining of LGR5 compared with vehicle (Fig. 3, B and C). LGR5 internalization was slowed by 2 μm justicidin B treatment and almost completely inhibited by 20 μm justicidin B. We have shown previously that internalized LGR5 transits through early endosomes in route to its final destination in the trans-Golgi network (23Snyder J.C. Rochelle L.K. Lyerly H.K. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Constitutive internalization of the leucine-rich G protein-coupled receptor-5 (LGR5) to the trans-Golgi network.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 10286-10297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, to further support our live cell trafficking findings, we next quantified the transit of LGR5 into early endosomes. We adapted a “bystander” bioluminescence energy transfer (bBRET) assay to quantify receptor transit into early endosomes (31Namkung Y. Le Gouill C. Lukashova V. Kobayashi H. Hogue M. Khoury E. Song M. Bouvier M. Laporte S.A. Monitoring G protein-coupled receptor and β-arrestin trafficking in live cells using enhanced bystander BRET.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 12178Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This assay was first tested on two GPCRs whose ligand-dependent internalization properties are well known. The RLuc domain was fused to the carboxyl-terminal tail for the human vasopressin receptor 2 (V2R) or the mouse D2R. Cells were transfected with the donor and the 2xFYVE early endosome sensor and then stimulated with receptor-specific agonists. A dose-response increase in net BRET can be observed for V2R stimulated with arginine vasopressin (Fig. 3D, dashed line) and for D2R stimulated with quinpirole (Fig. 3E, dashed line). Justicidin B partially inhibited V2R and D2R transit to early endosomes (Fig. 3, D and E). As expected, justicidin B also inhibited LGR5 transit into the early endosomes (Fig. 3F). Collectively these data demonstrate that justicidin B inhibits the constitutive internalization of LGR5 and its transit into early endosomes. Justicidin B also inhibits ligand-dependent localization of other GPCRs into early endosomes. These data suggest that justicidin B blocks an early event in receptor internalization or endosomal sorting. A PubChem search for structural analogues of justicidin B identified diphyllin (justicidin A) (Fig. 4A). Previous reports have demonstrated that diphyllin is a selective vacuolar-type H+-ATPases (vATPase) inhibitor and can prevent the normal acidification of endosomes (32Sørensen M.G. Henriksen K. Neutzsky-Wulff A.V. Dziegiel M.H. Karsdal M.A. Diphyllin, a novel and naturally potent V-ATPase inhibitor, abrogates acidification of the osteoclastic resorption lacunae and bone resorption.J.

Inhibitory and combinatorial effect of diphyllin, a v-ATPase blocker, on influenza viruses.Antiviral Res. 2013; 99: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A recognized specific inhibitor of vATPase is bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) (34Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Bafilomycins: a class of inhibitors of membrane ATPases from microorganisms, animal cells, and plant cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). In addition to its defined roles for inhibiting endosomal acidification, a recent report demonstrated that prolonged BafA1 treatment can inhibit receptor internalization (35Kozik P. Hodson N.A. Sahlender D.A. Simecek N. Soromani C. Wu J. Collinson L.M. Robinson M.S. A human genome-wide screen for regulators of clathrin-coated vesicle formation reveals an unexpected role for the V-ATPase.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 50-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that, like justicidin B, diphyllin or BafA1 treatment would inhibit the constitutive internalization of LGR5. The results demonstrate that each compound increased the expression of LGR5 at the cell surface (Fig. 4, B and C). BafA1 is the most potent (EC50 = 2.6 nm) and is well below the inhibitory concentrations of F0/F1-ATPases (10–100 μm) that are toxic in cells (Fig. 4B, asterisk) (34Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Bafilomycins: a class of inhibitors of membrane ATPases from microorganisms, animal cells, and plant cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). Diphyllin and justicidin B are far less potent (EC50 = 0.2 and 3.0 μm, respectively). Similar to justicidin B, IRFAP live cell trafficking revealed that both BafA1 and diphyllin inhibit LGR5 internalization and result in accumulation of fluorescent punctae at the cell surface (Fig. 4, D and E). Prolonged BafA1 vATPase inhibition prevents cholesterol recycling and inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis (35Kozik P. Hodson N.A. Sahlender D.A. Simecek N. Soromani C. Wu J. Collinson L.M.

Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 50-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that direct inhibition of clathrin would similarly inhibit constitutive internalization of LGR5. The internalization of LGR5 was blocked by dominant-negative inhibitors of dynamin (36Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Ménard L. Caron M.G.

We can reverse the effects of vATPase inhibition on LGR5 internalization by restoring plasma membrane cholesterol levels through simple co-incubation with the cholesterol donor cholesterol-methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Fig. 5, C and D) (35Kozik P.

https://openalex.org/W2592440618,"NADPH oxidase–generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) from immune cells are well known to be important for pathogen killing in response to TLR ligands. Here, we investigated a new aspect of NADPH oxidase in the TLR2/6-induced release of the immunologically relevant GM-CSF by endothelial cells. Stimulation of human endothelial cells with TLR2/6 agonist, MALP-2 (macrophage-activating lipopeptide of 2 kDa), induced NADPH oxidase activation and ROS formation. Inhibition by ROS scavengers and NADPH oxidase inhibitors blocked MALP-2–induced GM-CSF release. NADPH oxidase activators or ROS donors alone did not result in GM-CSF secretion; however, additional superoxide supply augmented MALP-2–induced GM-CSF secretion and restored GM-CSF levels after NADPH oxidase inhibition. MALP-2–dependent NF-ĸB activation was suppressed by NADPH oxidase inhibition, and inhibition of NF-ΚB completely blunted MALP-2–induced GM-CSF release. Vascular explants from mice that were deficient for the NADPH oxidase subunit p47phox showed diminished intimal superoxide production and GM-CSF release after ex vivo stimulation with MALP-2. Moreover, an increase in circulating progenitor cells after MALP-2 injection was completely abolished in p47phox-knockout mice. Finally, MALP-2 stimulation increased mRNA expression of the major subunit NADPH oxidase, (Nox)2, in endothelial cells, and Nox2 inhibition prevented MALP-2–induced GM-CSF release. Our findings identify a Nox2-containing NADPH oxidase as a crucial regulator of the immunologic important growth factor GM-CSF after TLR2/6 stimulation in endothelial cells.—Schuett, J., Schuett, H., Oberoi, R., Koch, A.-K., Pretzer, S., Luchtefeld, M., Schieffer, B., Grote, K.

https://openalex.org/W2592928268,"Staphyloccus aureus is a major human pathogen leading frequently to sepsis and soft tissue infections with abscesses. Multiple virulence factors including several immune modulating molecules contribute to its survival in the host. When S. aureus invades the human body, one of the first line defenses is the complement system, which opsonizes the bacteria with C3b and attract neutrophils by release of chemotactic peptides. Neutrophils express Complement receptor-1 [CR1, CD35) that interacts with the C3b-opsonized particles and thereby plays an important role in pathogen recognition by phagocytic cells. In this study we observed that a fraction of S. aureus culture supernatant prevented binding of C3b to neutrophils. This fraction consisted of S. aureus leukocidins and Efb. The C-terminus of Efb is known to bind C3b and shares significant sequence homology to the extracellular complement binding protein [Ecb). Here we show that S. aureus Ecb displays various mechanisms to block bacterial recognition by neutrophils. The presence of Ecb blocked direct interaction between soluble CR1 and C3b and reduced the cofactor activity of CR1 in proteolytic inactivation of C3b. Furthermore, Ecb could dose-dependently prevent recognition of C3b by cell-bound CR1 that lead to impaired phagocytosis of NHS-opsonized S. aureus. Phagocytosis was furthermore reduced in the presence of soluble CR1 [sCR1). These data indicate that the staphylococcal protein Ecb prevents recognition of C3b opsonized bacteria by neutrophil CR1 leading to impaired killing by phagocytosis and thereby contribute to immune evasion of S. aureus."
https://openalex.org/W2593189971,"Inspiratory muscle function may be affected in patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), further worsening the functional loss in these individuals. However, the impact of inspiratory muscle weakness (IMW) on the functional capacity (FC) of hemodialysis patients remains unknown. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the impact of IMW on FC in ESRD patients undergoing hemodialysis.ESRD patients on hemodialysis treatment for more than six months were evaluated for inspiratory muscle strength and FC. Inspiratory muscle strength was evaluated based on maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP). IMW was defined as MIP values less than 70% of the predicted value. FC was evaluated using the Incremental Shuttle Walk test (ISWT). Patients whose predicted peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) over the distance walked during the ISWT was less than 16mL/kg/min were considered to have FC impairment. Associations between variables were assessed by linear and logistic regression, with adjustment for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), presence of diabetes and hemoglobin level. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine different cutoff values of the MIP for normal inspiratory muscle strength and FC.Sixty-five ERSD patients (67.7% male), aged 48.2 (44.5-51.9) years were evaluated. MIP was an independent predictor of the distance walked during the ISWT (R2 = 0.44). IMW was an independent predictor of VO2peak < 16mL/kg/min. (OR = 5.7; p = 0.048) in adjusted logistic regression models.

Lariciresinol-4-β-D-glucopyranoside is a lignan that is extracted from Isatis indigotica, which is a medicinal herb plant that was commonly applied to treat infections, the common cold, fever and inflammatory diseases. Our previous study demonstrated that lariciresinol-4-β-D-glucopyranoside possesses anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the comprehensive and detailed mechanisms that underlie the effect of lariciresinol-4-β-D-glucopyranoside interventions against influenza virus infection remain to be elucidated. In this study, we employed high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate the transcriptomic responses of influenza A virus-infected lung epithelial (A549) cells with lariciresinol-4-β-D-glucopyranoside treatment. The transcriptome data show that infection with influenza A virus prompted the activation of 368 genes involved in RIG-I signalling, the inflammatory response, interferon α/β signalling and gene expression that was not affected by lariciresinol-4-β-D-glucopyranoside treatment. Lariciresinol-4-β-D-glucopyranoside exerted its pharmacological actions on the immune system, signal transduction, cell cycle and metabolism, which may be an underlying defense mechanism against influenza virus infection. In addition, 166 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were uniquely expressed in lariciresinol-4-β-D-glucopyranoside-treated cells, which were concentrated in the cell cycle, DNA repair, chromatin organization, gene expression and biosynthesis domains. Among them, six telomere-associated genes were up-regulated by lariciresinol-4-β-D-glucopyranoside treatment, which have been implicated in telomere regulation and stability. Collectively, we employed RNA-seq analysis to provide comprehensive insight into the mechanism of lariciresinol-4-β-D-glucopyranoside against influenza virus infection."

Gangliosides, a subgroup of GSLs having one or more sialic acid residues, are involved in regulation of numerous cell biological events, including development, trafficking, signaling, and cellular interactions. Gangliosides have pathophysiological functions in diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and diabetes (1Jennemann R. Gröne H.J.

For example, we demonstrated that localization of insulin receptor in caveolae is disrupted by elevated levels of endogenous GM3 during the state of insulin resistance.

The structural diversity of GSLs arises from both the ceramide (Cer) moiety and glycan portion (Fig. 1). Cer is composed of sphingosine and a single acyl chain (Fig. 1B). Cer acyl chains vary in length of carbon backbone, degree of saturation, and the presence/absence of α-hydroxylation (9Mullen T.D. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M.

Ceramide synthases as potential targets for therapeutic intervention in human diseases.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1841: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Additional structural diversity of gangliosides arises from sialic acid (acidic sugar molecule with characteristic nine-carbon backbone) in the glycan portion. The most common sialic acid in mammals is N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). The other common sialic acid, N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), differs from Neu5Ac by the presence of an additional oxygen atom in the acyl group at position C5 (Fig. 1B). Further structural diversity of sialic acids results from combinations of this variation at position C5 with modifications of hydroxyl groups at positions C4, C7, C8, and C9 by acetate, lactate, sulfate, phosphate esters, or methyl ethers. Sialic acid modifications greatly alter the size, hydrophobicity, net charge, and enzymatic susceptibility of the parent compound (11Angata T. Varki A. Chemical diversity in the sialic acids and related α-keto acids: an evolutionary perspective.Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 439-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Such structural divergence generated by different combinations of Cer and sialic acids in gangliosides (Fig. 1B) results in a huge numbers of “molecular species.” The identity of sialic acid species in GM3 affects its biological properties. GM3 inhibits EGFR-tyrosine kinase to differing degrees depending on its sialic acid species. Such a difference apparently results from differential carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions between EGFR and GM3 (Neu5Ac) or GM3 (Neu5Gc) (12Hayashi N. Chiba H. Kuronuma K. Go S. Hasegawa Y. Takahashi M. Gasa S. Watanabe A. Hasegawa T. Kuroki Y. Inokuchi J. Takahashi H. Detection of N-glycolyated gangliosides in non-small-cell lung cancer using GMR8 monoclonal antibody.Cancer Sci. 2013; 104: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated relationships between various metabolic diseases and levels of serum ganglioside GM3 “acyl chain” molecular species. In particular, levels of GM3 with hydroxylated acyl chain species in human serum show strong correlations with several risk factors for metabolic diseases (13Veillon L. Go S. Matsuyama W. Suzuki A.

Taken together, the above findings indicate that differing molecular species of a given ganglioside have distinct biological properties and regulate specific and distinct biological events. Elucidation of the function of each molecular species is important and will provide new insights into ganglioside biology. Regulation of skeletal muscle formation is an essential process in both normal development and repair of damaged muscle tissue. Differentiation of skeletal muscle cells (myocytes) is a multistep process; the steps include signal transduction, cell adhesion, and cell-cell fusion (14Hindi S.M. Tajrishi M.M. Kumar A. Signaling mechanisms in mammalian myoblast fusion.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: re2Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 15Krauss R.S. Cole F. Gaio U. Takaesu G. Zhang W. Kang J.S. Close encounters: regulation of vertebrate skeletal myogenesis by cell-cell contact.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2355-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Gangliosides are known to modulate various plasma membrane functions, e.g. cell-cell interactions, signal transduction, and membrane ion channel activity, through formation of functional membrane microdomains termed “rafts.” Gangliosides are presumably involved in these processes in myocytes (16Anastasia L.

Muscle. 2015; 5: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); however, direct evidence for such involvement is limited and fragmentary. In the present study we evaluated expression of gangliosides in myoblasts during differentiation. We observed striking changes in ganglioside molecular species composition during differentiation and assessed their differential functions. GM3 (Neu5Gc) and 16:0 acyl chain species, in particular, appear to play essential roles in differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes. C2C12 is a myoblast line established from normal adult C3H mouse leg skeletal muscle and is a well established model of in vitro differentiation. C2C12 cells were cultured to ∼90% confluence in growth medium and then cultured in differentiation medium (DM; see “Experimental procedures”). Upon differentiation stimulus, the cells gradually fused to form multinucleated fibers (myotubes) (Fig. 2A) as expected. Differentiation to myotubes was confirmed by Western blotting. Levels of differentiation marker proteins myogenin and myosin heavy chain (MyHC) increased during differentiation (Fig. 2B). HPTLC revealed the appearance of bands corresponding to GM3, GM2, GM1, and GD1a mobilities during differentiation (Fig. 2C). Amounts of all acidic GSLs increased gradually during differentiation (Fig. 2C). In particular, GM3 content increased strikingly, with three major bands. Through day 2, the top band (black pointer) and middle band (gray pointer) were the major GM3 bands. From day 3 onward, the top band decreased, and the middle band and bottom band (white pointer) became the major bands. These findings revealed clear changes in quantity and quality of GM3 molecular species, reflecting their importance in myogenic differentiation. GM3 synthase expression increased during differentiation (Fig. 3A), consistent with the observed increase of GM3 levels (Fig. 2A). To evaluate ganglioside changes during differentiation, we used TLC immunostaining and fluorometric HPLC to assess the quantity and quality of lipid-linked sialic acids. Changes of sialic acid species of GM3 were confirmed by TLC immunostaining using specific anti-GM3 mAbs. For anti-GM3 (Neu5Ac) mAb GMR6, positive staining was detected at day 0, and its intensity increased until day 3 and decreased thereafter (Fig. 3B). In contrast, for anti-GM3 (Neu5Gc) mAb GMR8 (20Ozawa H. Kawashima I. Tai T. Generation of murine monoclonal antibodies specific for N-glycolylneuraminic acid-containing gangliosides.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), positive bands were very weak until day 2 then increased gradually after day 3 (Fig. 3B). High GM3 (Neu5Gc) expression was maintained even on day 8. Quantity and quality of lipid-linked sialic acids were next assessed by fluorometric HPLC. In C2C12 myoblasts before differentiation, almost all gangliosides contained Neu5Ac as sialic acid in the glycan portion (Fig. 4A, ▪). After differentiation induction, the total amount of lipid-linked sialic acid increased (Fig. 4A, ▴), consistent with TLC immunostaining results (Fig. 2C). The amount of lipid-linked Neu5Ac increased gradually through day 3 and declined thereafter. In contrast, lipid-linked Neu5Gc was barely detectable until day 2, increased markedly on day 3, and by day 5 was the major sialic acid species (Fig. 4A, ▴), again consistent with TLC results (Fig. 3, B and C). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that sialic acid species of gangliosides change from Neu5Ac to Neu5Gc during myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells. Neu5Gc residues on glycans are synthesized from CMP-Neu5Gc through catalytic activity of sialyltransferases. There are two CMP-Neu5Gc synthesis pathways in mammalian cells. (i) In the salvage pathway, cells take up extracellular Neu5Gc-containing glycoconjugates derived from foods such as meat, fish, and eggs (or from serum in the case of cultured cell lines). Subsequently, Neu5Gc-containing glycoconjugates are hydrolyzed to Neu5Gc monosaccharides in lysosomes. Neu5Gc monosaccharides are transported to cytosol, and Neu5Gc is activated to CMP-Neu5Gc by CMP-sialic acid synthetase in the nucleus (21Samraj A.N. Pearce O.M. Läubli H. Crittenden A.N.

(ii) In the de novo synthesis pathway, sialic acid Neu5Ac is synthesized in cytosol and activated to CMP-Neu5Ac in the nucleus, and CMP-Neu5Ac is subsequently converted to CMP-Neu5Gc by the enzyme CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase (CMAH) in cytosol (24Kawano T.

CMP-Neu5Gc is transported into the Golgi apparatus, where it undergoes transfer to glycans through catalytic activity of various sialyltransferases. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of the CMAH encoding gene (Cmah) revealed that expression level of Cmah mRNA was very low during days 0–2 but increased thereafter (Fig. 4C). Expression of Cmah mRNA was correlated with GM3 (Neu5Gc) level during C2C12 differentiation (Figure 3, Figure 4). It is known that fetal bovine and horse serum contain Neu5Gc glycoconjugates. Therefore, we analyzed sialic acid in growth (10% FBS) and differentiation (2% HS) medium and confirmed the existence of Neu5Gc in both mediums. Lipid-linked Sia in the media is shown in Fig. 4B. Growth medium contained large amounts of sialyl glycosphingolipids compare with differentiation medium. Both mediums contained large amounts of Neu5Ac compare with Neu5Gc. Although Neu5Gc glycosphingolipids, especially Neu5Gc-GM3 in medium, may be taken up and utilized by differentiating cells, the amounts would be small. Because the expression levels of both GM3 synthase and Cmah increased after the induction of differentiation (Figs. 3A and 4C), we could conclude that the increase of Neu5Gc-GM3 during differentiation may be due to the increased de novo synthesis. Structural diversity of GM3 derived from acyl chain structures in C2C12 cells was evaluated by LC-MS/MS after differentiation induction. On day 0 (Fig. 5A, black bars), the three most abundant GM3 species detected were Neu5Ac-GM3 (d18:1–24:0), Neu5Ac-GM3 (d18:1–24:1), and Neu5Ac-GM3 (d18:1–16:0). Species with acyl chain carbon number 24 accounted for >50% of total GM3 (Fig. 5B, green and blue colors). Species that were abundant on day 0 contained primarily Neu5Ac as sialic acid, consistent with TLC immunostaining and HPLC results (Figure 3, Figure 4). On day 7, when differentiation was completed, Neu5Gc-GM3 (d18:1–16:0) was the most abundant GM3 molecular species, and Neu5Ac-GM3 (d18:1–16:0) was the second most abundant (Fig. 5A). GM3 species with 16:0 acyl chains accounted for ∼70% of the total. Proportions of Neu5Ac species were lower, and those of Neu5Gc species were higher on day 7, but total amounts of 24:0 and 24:1 species showed little change (Fig. 5A). The proportion of 16:0 species increased markedly during differentiation (Fig. 5, A and B). Ceramide synthase (CerS) enzymes regulate synthesis of the various Cer species. Six types of mammalian CerS have been reported. Each CerS has a preference for a unique range of acyl-CoA groups and, therefore, controls a particular subset of Cer species. We used real-time PCR to determine expression levels of CerS1 through CerS6 in C2C12 cells. The predominant forms detected in these cells were CerS1, -2, -5, and -6. CerS2, which catalyzes synthesis of ceramide with very long acyl chains such as C24, was most abundant in C2C12. CerS2 was slightly increased after the induction of differentiation, but it was decreased sharply during the differentiation process. On the other hand the levels of CerS5 and -6, which catalyze C16-Cer synthesis, remained constant (Fig. 6A). Therefore, the increase of GM3 C16 species after differentiation (Fig. 5) could be attributed to the marked decrease of CerS2 expression during the differentiation process (Fig. 6A). We also examined changes in mRNA expression levels of fatty acyl-CoA elongases (Elovls) during differentiation. Levels of all five Elovls examined were lower on day 8 than on day 0 (Fig. 6B). This trend may also explain in part the increase of shorter acyl-chain Cer species. Sialic acid and acyl chain structures of GM3 showed notable changes during C2C12 cell differentiation. The potential role of such changes was investigated by adding various sialic acid and GM3 molecular species to culture medium. Sialic acid monosaccharide (Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc) was added during medium change each day to change the sialic acid species of sialylglycoconjugates. Treatment with 2 mm Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc efficiently increased intracellular Sia monosaccharide (Fig. 7A, left panel), so exogenous sialic acids were taken up by C2C12 cells. After 2 days the amount of lipid-linked Neu5Gc exceeded that of Neu5Ac in cells treated with 2 mm Neu5Gc, although Neu5Ac was the major sialic acid in normal and Neu5Ac-treated cells (Fig. 7A, right panel). Thus, we were able to change the ratio of sialic acid species in gangliosides by treatment with Neu5Gc. Cell morphology on day 6 is shown in Fig. 7, B and C. Sialic acid species differentially affected morphology of myoblasts and/or myofibers. The ratio of long fibers was increased by treatment with Neu5Gc (Fig. 7C, right panel). And the formed fiber width was small (Fig. 7C, left panel). Therefore, cells treated with Neu5Gc monosaccharide formed longer, narrower myofibers. Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc treatment had no effect on the expression of differentiation marker proteins myogenin and MyHC (Fig. 7D, left panel). However, phosphorylation of paxillin, which regulates adhesion state, was increased by treatment with Neu5Gc (Fig. 7D, right panel). These findings suggest that sialic acid affects cell morphology via control of cytoskeleton formation or myofiber adhesion state. Although Neu5Ac was taken up by cells during Neu5Ac treatment, the quality and quantity of glycosphingolipids was not drastically changed (Fig. 7A). The ratio of shorter length myotubes was slightly increased by Neu5Ac treatment. These changes may not be an effect of only change in GLSs, although these results suggest that extracellular sialic acid affected myoblast differentiation. Exogenous gangliosides can be inserted into the outer leaflet of plasma membranes and be partially taken up and metabolized (26Schwarzmann G. Uptake and metabolism of exogenous glycosphingolipids by cultured cells.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We confirmed the uptake and increase of GM3 in cells by TLC and fluorometric HPLC (Fig. 8A). 25 μm exogenous GM3 efficiently increased cellular gangliosides (Fig. 8A, left panel) and lipid linked sialic acids (Fig. 8A, right panel). Therefore, we added GM3 species, shorter (16:0) species, which are the major species after differentiation, and longer (24:0 or 18:0) species, which are the major species before differentiation to evaluate their properties. In experiments with different GM3 molecular species, d18:1–16:0 species were well aligned and formed numerous myotubes, whereas cells treated with GM3 d18:1–18:0 or d18:1–24:0 species were poorly aligned and formed fewer myotubes (Fig. 8B); the ratio of cells with shorter length and larger width was increased when treated with GM3 d18:1–18:0 or d18:1–24:0 species (Fig. 8C). Although expression level of myogenin was relatively unaffected by treatment with different GM3 molecular species, the level of MyHC was notably reduced by treatment with GM3 d18:1–18:0 or d18:1–24:0 species (Fig. 8D). Cells treated with GM3 d18:1–16:0 formed relatively longer myofibers. These findings indicate that increased longer acyl-chain GM3 species inhibit some signaling in differentiation processes such as fusion process and/or formation of myotubes, whereas shorter acyl-chain GM3 species do not inhibit, or might, enhance. In this study we found an association of GM3 lipid species change and differentiation in myoblast. The results shown in Fig. 7 and in Fig. 8 are consistent with the hypothesis that myoblasts may regulate their differentiation by changing GSLs species. Skeletal muscle differentiation comprises a chain of complex processes in which cell plasma membranes play a crucial role. Cell-to-cell adhesion and recognition are essential for the differentiation process. It is necessary for progenitor cells to contact numerous similar cells and respond to inductive signals in order to undergo a coordinated process of differentiation. In the final steps of differentiation, plasma membranes fuse with each other (14Hindi S.M. Tajrishi M.M. Kumar A. Signaling mechanisms in mammalian myoblast fusion.Sci.

We analyzed changes in ganglioside species during myogenic differentiation using C2C12 cells as a model. We demonstrated for the first time striking changes in quantity and quality of gangliosides during the differentiation process. Alterations of molecular species of GM3, the major ganglioside in C2C12 cells, were particularly notable. Sialic acid species in GM3 were changed from Neu5Ac to Neu5Gc through elevated expression of hydroxylase CMAH. GM3 species with 16:0 acyl chains were greatly increased. To elucidate the function of this GM3 molecular species change, we added sialic acid monosaccharide or synthetic GM3 acyl chain species to culture medium. Our findings (Figure 6, Figure 7) indicate that sialic acid species affect cell morphology and that GM3 acyl chain structures play key roles in regulating differentiation. In regard to GM3 function in myogenic differentiation, previous studies indicate that sialidase (Neu3), which is localized in the plasma membrane and hydrolyzes GM3 and other gangliosides, affects differentiation of C2C12 cells. Neu3 overexpression delayed myoblast differentiation and induced hypertrophic myotube formation, whereas differentiation was inhibited by Neu3 gene silencing (16Anastasia L. Papini N. Colazzo F.

However, the role of ARE-BPs in lung cancer remains poorly understood. In this study, we have identified that K-homology splicing regulatory protein (KSRP), an ARE-BP, is robustly up-regulated in human lung cancer. Importantly, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that elevated KSRP expression was correlated with poor overall survival of lung cancer patients. Furthermore, cigarette smoke, a leading risk factor for lung cancer, was also identified to be an important contributor to increased KSRP expression. Remarkably, silencing of KSRP decreased cell proliferation, reversed anchorage-independent growth, and reduced migration/invasion, suggesting an oncogenic role for KSRP in lung cancer. Finally, we provide mechanistic evidence that KSRP promotes the down-regulation of Spry4 by a previously unidentified mechanism, i.e. post-transcriptional mRNA regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2592635314,"Introduction Drug-induced cholestasis is a liver disorder that might be caused by interference of drugs with the hepatobiliary bile acid transporters. It is important to identify this interference early on in drug development. In this work, Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-imaging with a 18F labeled bile acid analogue was introduced to detect disturbed hepatobiliary transport of bile acids. Methods 3β-[18F]fluorocholic acid ([18F]FCA) was prepared by nucleophilic substitution of a mesylated precursor with [18F]fluoride, followed by deprotection with sodium hydroxide. Transport of [18F]FCA was assessed in vitro using CHO-NTCP, HEK-OATP1B1, HEK-OATP1B3 transfected cells and BSEP & MRP2 membrane vesicles. Investigation of [18F]FCA metabolites was performed with primary mouse hepatocytes. Hepatobiliary transport of [18F]FCA was evaluated in vivo in wild-type, rifampicin and bosentan pretreated FVB-mice by dynamic μPET scanning. Results Radiosynthesis of [18F]FCA was achieved in a moderate radiochemical yield (8.11 ± 1.94%; non-decay corrected; n = 10) and high radiochemical purity (>99%). FCA was transported by the basolateral bile acid uptake transporters NTCP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. For canalicular efflux, BSEP and MRP2 are the relevant bile acid transporters. [18F]FCA was found to be metabolically stable. In vivo, [18F]FCA showed fast hepatic uptake (4.5 ± 0.5 min to reach 71.8 ± 1.2% maximum % ID) and subsequent efflux to the gallbladder and intestines (93.3 ± 6.0% ID after 1 hour). Hepatobiliary transport of [18F]FCA was significantly inhibited by both rifampicin and bosentan. Conclusion A 18F labeled bile acid analogue, [18F]FCA, has been developed that shows transport by NTCP, OATP, MRP2 and BSEP. [18F]FCA can be used as a probe to monitor disturbed hepatobiliary transport in vivo and accumulation of bile acids in blood and liver during drug development."

Existing data further indicate that right ventricular function is more affected than left ventricular function. The cellular mechanisms underpinning cardiac deterioration are limited and therefore the aim of this study was to examine cardiomyocyte and molecular responses of the right and left ventricle to an acute bout of exhaustive endurance exercise.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to sedentary controls or acute exhaustive endurance exercise consisting of a 120 minutes long forced treadmill run. The contractile function and Ca2+ handling properties in isolated cardiomyocytes, protein expression levels of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase and phospholamban including two of its phosphorylated states (serine 16 and threonine 17), and the mitochondrial respiration in permeabilized cardiac muscle fibers were analyzed.The exercise group showed a significant reduction in cardiomyocyte fractional shortening (right ventricle 1 Hz and 3 Hz p<0.001; left ventricle 1 Hz p<0.05), intracellular Ca2+ amplitude (right ventricle 1 and 3 Hz p<0.001; left ventricle 1 Hz p<0.01 and 3 Hz p<0.05) and rate of diastolic Ca2+ decay (right ventricle 1 Hz p<0.001 and 3 Hz p<0.01; left ventricle 1 and 3 Hz p<0.01). Cardiomyocyte relaxation during diastole was only significantly prolonged at 3 Hz in the right ventricle (p<0.05) compared to sedentary controls. We found an increase in phosphorylation of phospholamban at serine 16 and threonine 17 in the left (p<0.05), but not the right, ventricle from exhaustively exercised animals. The protein expression levels of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase and phospholamban was not changed. Furthermore, we found a reduction in maximal oxidative phosphorylation and electron transport system capacities of mitochondrial respiration in the right (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively), but not the left ventricle from rats subjected to acute exhaustive treadmill exercise.Acute exhaustive treadmill exercise is associated with impairment of cardiomyocyte Ca2+ handling and mitochondrial respiration that causes depression in both contraction and diastolic relaxation of cardiomyocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2592061733,"Autosomal-recessive proximal spinal muscular atrophies (SMA) are disorders characterized by a ubiquitous deficiency of the survival of motor neuron protein that leads to a multisystemic disorder, which mostly affects alpha motor neurons. Disease progression is clinically associated with failure to thrive or weight loss, mainly caused by chewing and swallowing difficulties. Although pancreatic involvement has been described in animal models, systematic endocrinological evaluation of the energy metabolism in humans is lacking.In 43 patients with SMA type I-III (8 type I; 22 type II; 13 type III), aged 0.6-21.8 years, auxological parameters, pubertal stage, motor function (Motor Function Measurement 32 -MFM32) as well as levels of leptin, insulin glucose, hemoglobin A1c, Homeostasis Model Assessment index and an urinary steroid profile were determined.Hyperleptinemia was found in 15/35 (43%) of our patients; 9/15 (60%) of the hyperleptinemic patients were underweight, whereas 1/15 (7%) was obese. Hyperleptinemia was associated with SMA type (p = 0.018). There was a significant association with decreased motor function (MFM32 total score in hyperleptinemia 28.5%, in normoleptinemia 54.7% p = 0.008, OR 0.969; 95%-CI: 0.946-0.992). In addition, a higher occurrence of hirsutism, premature pubarche and a higher variability of the urinary steroid pattern were found.Hyperleptinemia is highly prevalent in underweight children with SMA and is associated with disease severity and decreased motor function. Neuronal degradation of hypothalamic cells or an increase in fat content by muscle remodeling could be the cause of hyperleptinemia."
https://openalex.org/W2593467622,"Cardiovascular (CV) events are the primary cause of death and becoming bedridden among hemodialysis (HD) patients. The Framingham risk score (FRS) is useful for predicting incidence of CV events in the general population, but is considerd to be unsuitable for the prediction of the incidence of CV events in HD patients, given their characteristics due to atypical relationships between conventional risk factors and outcomes. We therefore aimed to develop a new prognostic prediction model for prevention and early detection of CV events among hemodialysis patients.We enrolled 3,601 maintenance HD patients based on their data from the Japan Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (J-DOPPS), phases 3 and 4. We longitudinaly assessed the association between several potential candidate predictors and composite CV events in the year after study initiation. Potential candidate predictors included the component factors of FRS and other HD-specific risk factors. We used multivariable logistic regression with backward stepwise selection to develop our new prediction model and generated a calibration plot. Additinially, we performed bootstrapping to assess the internal validity.We observed 328 composite CV events during 1-year follow-up. The final prediction model contained six variables: age, diabetes status, history of CV events, dialysis time per session, and serum phosphorus and albumin levels. The new model showed significantly better discrimination than the FRS, in both men (c-statistics: 0.76 for new model, 0.64 for FRS) and women (c-statistics: 0.77 for new model, 0.60 for FRS). Additionally, we confirmed the consistency between the observed results and predicted results using the calibration plot. Further, we found similar discrimination and calibration to the derivation model in the bootstrapping cohort.We developed a new risk model consisting of only six predictors. Our new model predicted CV events more accurately than the FRS."

Mammalian gp96 was further found to require the cochaperone canopy 3 (CNPY3) for proper folding and expression of TLRs, but not integrins. In Drosophila, two possible CNPY family members have been identified but have not yet been characterized. Therefore, we sought to determine the role of Drosophila CNPYa and CNPYb in gp93 biology. Because of higher similarities between CNPY3 and CNPYb, we postulated that CNPYb would be a TLR-specific cochaperone of gp93. Indeed, CNPYb addition in gp93-expressing cells improved TLR expression. CNPYb and gp93 were further found to physically interact. Mutational analysis of cysteine residues in CNPYb identified differential dependence of these cysteines in chaperone function. Our study is the first to characterize Drosophila CNPY molecules. We further uncover more gp93 biology by identifying CNPYb as a cochaperone.

https://openalex.org/W2593457987,"More than half of males in China are current smokers and evidence from western countries tells us that an unprecedented number of smoking-attributable deaths will occur as the Chinese population ages. We used the China Lung Cancer Policy Model (LCPM) to simulate effects of computed tomography (CT)-based lung cancer screening in China, comparing the impact of a screening guideline published in 2015 by a Chinese expert group to a version developed for the United States by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The China LCPM, built using an existing lung cancer microsimulation model, can project population outcomes associated with interventions for smoking-related diseases. After calibrating the model to published Chinese smoking prevalence and lung cancer mortality rates, we simulated screening from 2016 to 2050 based on eligibility criteria from the CMS and Chinese guidelines, which differ by age to begin and end screening, pack-years smoked, and years since quitting. Outcomes included number of screens, mortality reduction, and life-years saved for each strategy. We projected that in the absence of screening, 14.98 million lung cancer deaths would occur between 2016 and 2050. Screening with the CMS guideline would prevent 0.72 million deaths and 5.8 million life-years lost, resulting in 6.58% and 1.97% mortality reduction in males and females, respectively. Screening with the Chinese guideline would prevent 0.74 million deaths and 6.6 million life-years lost, resulting in 6.30% and 2.79% mortality reduction in males and females, respectively. Through 2050, 1.43 billion screens would be required using the Chinese screening strategy, compared to 988 million screens using the CMS guideline. In conclusion, CT-based lung cancer screening implemented in 2016 and based on the Chinese screening guideline would prevent about 20,000 (2.9%) more lung cancer deaths through 2050, but would require about 445 million (44.7%) more screens than the CMS guideline."

https://openalex.org/W2593495535,"The SIRT1 protein deacetylase is reported to have a remarkably wide spectrum of biological functions affecting such varied processes as aging, cancer, metabolism, neurodegeneration and immunity. However, the SIRT1 literature is also full of contradictions. To help establish the role(s) of SIRT1 in these and other biological processes, we set out to create a mouse in which the SIRT1 activity could be toggled between on and off states by fusing the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain (ER) to the C terminus of the SIRT1 protein. We found that the catalytic activity of the SIRT1-ER fusion protein increased 4-5 fold in cells treated with its ligand, 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4OHT). The 4OHT-induced activation of SIRT1-ER was due in large part to a 2 to 4-fold increase in abundance of the SIRT1-ER protein in cells in culture and in tissues in vivo. This increase is reversible and is a consequence of 4OHT-induced stabilization of the SIRT1-ER protein. Since changes in SIRT1 level or activity of 2-4 fold are frequently reported to be sufficient to affect its biological functions, this mouse should be helpful in establishing the causal relationships between SIRT1 and the diseases and processes it affects."

This study aimed to assess clustering of lifestyle patterns and investigate the relationships between such patterns and cardio-renal-metabolic parameters.The study participants were 726 Japanese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) outpatients free of history of cardiovascular diseases. The relationship between lifestyle patterns and cardio-renal-metabolic parameters was investigated by linear and logistic regression analyses.Factor analysis identified three lifestyle patterns. Subjects characterized by evening type, poor sleep quality and depressive status (type 1 pattern) had high levels of HbA1c, alanine aminotransferase and albuminuria. Subjects characterized by high consumption of food, alcohol and cigarettes (type 2 pattern) had high levels of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, blood pressure, and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity. Subjects characterized by high physical activity (type 3 pattern) had low uric acid and mild elevation of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. In multivariate regression analysis adjusted by age, gender and BMI, type 1 pattern was associated with higher HbA1c levels, systolic BP and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity. Type 2 pattern was associated with higher HDL-cholesterol levels, triglycerides, aspartate aminotransferase, ɤ- glutamyl transpeptidase levels, and diastolic BP.The study identified three lifestyle patterns that were associated with distinct cardio-metabolic-renal parameters in T2DM patients.UMIN000010932."
https://openalex.org/W2591816524,"Tight coupling of cell growth and cell cycle progression enable cells to adjust their rate of division, and therefore size, to the demands of proliferation in varying nutritional environments. Nutrient stress promotes inhibition of Target Of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1) activity. In fission yeast, reduced TORC1 activity advances mitotic onset and switches growth to a sustained proliferation at reduced cell size. A screen for mutants, that failed to advance mitosis upon nitrogen stress, identified a mutant in the PIKFYVE 1-phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase fission yeast homolog Ste12. Ste12PIKFYVE deficient mutants were unable to advance the cell cycle to reduce cell size after a nitrogen downshift to poor nitrogen (proline) growth conditions. While it is well established that PI(3,5)P2 signalling is required for autophagy and that Ste12PIKFYVE mutants have enlarged vacuoles (yeast lysosomes), neither a block to autophagy or mutants that independently have enlarged vacuoles had any impact upon nitrogen control of mitotic commitment. The addition of rapamycin to Ste12PIKFYVE deficient mutants reduced cell size at division to suggest that Ste12PIKFYVE possibly functions upstream of TORC1. ste12 mutants display increased Torin1 (TOR inhibitor) sensitivity. However, no major impact on TORC1 or TORC2 activity was observed in the ste12 deficient mutants. In summary, Ste12PIKFYVE is required for nitrogen-stress mediated advancement of mitosis to reduce cell size at division."
https://openalex.org/W2531161531,"Food-webs and other classes of ecological network motifs, are a means of describing feeding relationships between consumers and producers in an ecosystem. They have application across scales where they differ only in the underlying characteristics of the organisms and substrates describing the system. Mathematical modelling, using mechanistic approaches to describe the dynamic behaviour and properties of the system through sets of ordinary differential equations, has been used extensively in ecology. Models allow simulation of the dynamics of the various motifs and their numerical analysis provides a greater understanding of the interplay between the system components and their intrinsic properties. We have developed the MI-Sim software for use with MATLAB to allow a rigorous and rapid numerical analysis of several common ecological motifs. MI-Sim contains a series of the most commonly used motifs such as cooperation, competition and predation. It does not require detailed knowledge of mathematical analytical techniques and is offered as a single graphical user interface containing all input and output options. The tools available in the current version of MI-Sim include model simulation, steady-state existence and stability analysis, and basin of attraction analysis. The software includes seven ecological interaction motifs and seven growth function models. Unlike other system analysis tools, MI-Sim is designed as a simple and user-friendly tool specific to ecological population type models, allowing for rapid assessment of their dynamical and behavioural properties."

https://openalex.org/W2594227148,"Escherichia coli cells that are exposed to DNA damaging agents invoke the SOS response that involves expression of the umuD gene products, along with more than 50 other genes. Full-length UmuD is expressed as a 139-amino-acid protein, which eventually cleaves its N-terminal 24 amino acids to form UmuD'. The N-terminal arms of UmuD are dynamic and contain recognition sites for multiple partner proteins. Cleavage of UmuD to UmuD' dramatically affects the function of the protein and activates UmuC for translesion synthesis (TLS) by forming DNA Polymerase V. To probe the roles of the N-terminal arms in the cellular functions of the umuD gene products, we constructed additional N-terminal truncated versions of UmuD: UmuD 8 (UmuD Δ1-7) and UmuD 18 (UmuD Δ1-17). We found that the loss of just the N-terminal seven (7) amino acids of UmuD results in changes in conformation of the N-terminal arms, as determined by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy with site-directed spin labeling. UmuD 8 is cleaved as efficiently as full-length UmuD in vitro and in vivo, but expression of a plasmid-borne non-cleavable variant of UmuD 8 causes hypersensitivity to UV irradiation, which we determined is the result of a copy-number effect. UmuD 18 does not cleave to form UmuD', but confers resistance to UV radiation. Moreover, removal of the N-terminal seven residues of UmuD maintained its interactions with the alpha polymerase subunit of DNA polymerase III as well as its ability to disrupt interactions between alpha and the beta processivity clamp, whereas deletion of the N-terminal 17 residues resulted in decreases in binding to alpha and in the ability to disrupt the alpha-beta interaction. We find that UmuD 8 mimics full-length UmuD in many respects, whereas UmuD 18 lacks a number of functions characteristic of UmuD."
