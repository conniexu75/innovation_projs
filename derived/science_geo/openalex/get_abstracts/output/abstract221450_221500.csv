https://openalex.org/W1966238900,"Spike (S) proteins of coronaviruses, including the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), associate with cellular receptors to mediate infection of their target cells1,2. Here we identify a metallopeptidase, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)3,4, isolated from SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-permissive Vero E6 cells, that efficiently binds the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV S protein. We found that a soluble form of ACE2, but not of the related enzyme ACE1, blocked association of the S1 domain with Vero E6 cells. 293T cells transfected with ACE2, but not those transfected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 receptors, formed multinucleated syncytia with cells expressing S protein. Furthermore, SARS-CoV replicated efficiently on ACE2-transfected but not mock-transfected 293T cells. Finally, anti-ACE2 but not anti-ACE1 antibody blocked viral replication on Vero E6 cells. Together our data indicate that ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV."

We solved the structure of the Drosophila amphiphysin BAR domain. It is a crescent-shaped dimer that binds preferentially to highly curved negatively charged membranes. With its N-terminal amphipathic helix and BAR domain (N-BAR), amphiphysin can drive membrane curvature in vitro and in vivo. The structure is similar to that of arfaptin2, which we find also binds and tubulates membranes. From this, we predict that BAR domains are in many protein families, including sorting nexins, centaurins, and oligophrenins. The universal and minimal BAR domain is a dimerization, membrane-binding, and curvature-sensing module."

https://openalex.org/W2033456643,"The realization of superfluidity in a dilute gas of fermionic atoms, analogous to superconductivity in metals, represents a long-standing goal of ultracold gas research. In such a fermionic superfluid, it should be possible to adjust the interaction strength and tune the system continuously between two limits: a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-type superfluid (involving correlated atom pairs in momentum space) and a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), in which spatially local pairs of atoms are bound together. This crossover between BCS-type superfluidity and the BEC limit has long been of theoretical interest, motivated in part by the discovery of high-temperature superconductors. In atomic Fermi gas experiments superfluidity has not yet been demonstrated; however, long-lived molecules consisting of locally paired fermions have been reversibly created. Here we report the direct observation of a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate created solely by adjusting the interaction strength in an ultracold Fermi gas of atoms. This state of matter represents one extreme of the predicted BCS-BEC continuum."

https://openalex.org/W2116064842,"Juvenile hemochromatosis is an early-onset autosomal recessive disorder of iron overload resulting in cardiomyopathy, diabetes and hypogonadism that presents in the teens and early 20s (refs. 1,2). Juvenile hemochromatosis has previously been linked to the centromeric region of chromosome 1q (refs. 3-6), a region that is incomplete in the human genome assembly. Here we report the positional cloning of the locus associated with juvenile hemochromatosis and the identification of a new gene crucial to iron metabolism. We finely mapped the recombinant interval in families of Greek descent and identified multiple deleterious mutations in a transcription unit of previously unknown function (LOC148738), now called HFE2, whose protein product we call hemojuvelin. Analysis of Greek, Canadian and French families indicated that one mutation, the amino acid substitution G320V, was observed in all three populations and accounted for two-thirds of the mutations found. HFE2 transcript expression was restricted to liver, heart and skeletal muscle, similar to that of hepcidin, a key protein implicated in iron metabolism. Urinary hepcidin levels were depressed in individuals with juvenile hemochromatosis, suggesting that hemojuvelin is probably not the hepcidin receptor. Rather, HFE2 seems to modulate hepcidin expression."

https://openalex.org/W2020411398,"The positive refractive index of conventional optical lenses means that they need curved surfaces to form an image, whereas a negative index of refraction allows a flat slab of a material to behave as a lens and focus electromagnetic waves to produce a real image. Here we demonstrate this unique feature of imaging by a flat lens, using the phenomenon of negative refraction in a photonic crystalline material. The key advance that enabled us to make this observation lies in the design of a photonic crystal with suitable dispersion characteristics to achieve negative refraction over a wide range of angles."

https://openalex.org/W2016727199,"During epithelial sheet formation, linear actin cables assemble at nascent adherens junctions. This process requires alpha-catenin and actin polymerization, although the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we show that formin-1 interacts with alpha-catenin, localizes to adherens junctions and nucleates unbranched actin filaments. Furthermore, disruption of the alpha-catenin-formin-1 interaction blocks assembly of radial actin cables and perturbs intercellular adhesion. A fusion protein of the beta-catenin-binding domain of alpha-catenin with the actin polymerization domains of formin-1 rescues formation of adherens junctions and associated actin cables in alpha-catenin-null keratinocytes. These findings provide new insight into how alpha-catenin orchestrates actin dynamics during intercellular junction formation."
https://openalex.org/W2167557855,"Disruption of human neural precursor proliferation can give rise to a small brain (microcephaly), and failure of neurons to migrate properly can lead to an abnormal arrest of cerebral cortical neurons in proliferative zones near the lateral ventricles (periventricular heterotopia). Here we show that an autosomal recessive condition characterized by microcephaly and periventricular heterotopia maps to chromosome 20 and is caused by mutations in the gene ADP-ribosylation factor guanine nucleotide-exchange factor-2 (ARFGEF2). By northern-blot analysis, we found that mouse Arfgef2 mRNA levels are highest during embryonic periods of ongoing neuronal proliferation and migration, and by in situ hybridization, we found that the mRNA is widely distributed throughout the embryonic central nervous system (CNS). ARFGEF2 encodes the large (>200 kDa) brefeldin A (BFA)-inhibited GEF2 protein (BIG2), which is required for vesicle and membrane trafficking from the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Inhibition of BIG2 by BFA, or by a dominant negative ARFGEF2 cDNA, decreases cell proliferation in vitro, suggesting a cell-autonomous regulation of neural expansion. Inhibition of BIG2 also disturbed the intracellular localization of such molecules as E-cadherin and beta-catenin by preventing their transport from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface. Our findings show that vesicle trafficking is an important regulator of proliferation and migration during human cerebral cortical development."

https://openalex.org/W2134143145,"Signalling through G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) is involved in the regulation of essential cellular processes and its deregulation is associated with tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. We investigated pathophysiological processes that are regulated by GPCR pathways in human kidney and bladder cancer cell lines. Our results show that GPCR ligands induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as well as downstream signalling events such as recruitment of the adapter protein Shc and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) ERK1/2, JNK and p38. Moreover, we report that the EGFR transactivation signal involves the EGFR ligands amphiregulin, HB-EGF and TGFalpha as well as the metalloproteinases ADAM 10, 15 and 17, depending on the cellular system. Finally, we demonstrate that EGFR transactivation is part of a regulatory system that modulates the migratory and invasive behaviour of kidney and bladder cancer cells. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that metalloproteinase-mediated transactivation of the EGFR is a key mechanism of the cellular signalling network that promotes MAPK activation as well as tumour cell migration and invasion in response to a variety of physiologically relevant GPCR ligands, and therefore represents a novel target for cancer intervention strategies."

https://openalex.org/W2068026673,"Mutations in p53 and reduced expression of the Cdk inhibitor p27Kip1 are frequently observed in a wide variety of human cancers, but it is not known whether alterations in these tumor suppressors interact to influence tumor progression. To address this, we measured tumor latency and spectrum in p53 and p27 single and compound mutant mice. p53-/- (null) mice developed T-cell lymphomas and soft-tissue sarcomas, while p27-/- mice developed adenomas of the pituitary and lung, but with much longer latency. The latency for tumor development in p53-/- p27-/- and p53-/- p27+/- compound mutant mice was significantly reduced, by 15-30%, compared to single mutant p53-/- mice. The tumor spectrum in the compound mutants was similar to that of p53-/- mice, and additional tumors of diverse histotypes. In tumors from p53-/- mice, p27 protein levels were reduced to a greater extent than were mRNA levels, indicating that p27 is downregulated in tumors at the transcriptional as well as post-transcriptional levels. In contrast, mice deficient in another Cdk inhibitor p21Cip1, which is also a transcriptional target and effector of p53, showed only a marginal increase in tumor predisposition in response to ENU treatment. Thus, downregulation of p27 is a common feature in p53-/- tumors. Germline deletion of one or both alleles of p27 accelerates tumor development and associated mortality in p53-/- mice, indicating potent synergy between loss of p27 and p53. Although p21 is functionally similar to both p53 and p27, it plays a lesser role in tumor suppression. These results further highlight the highly cooperative nature of p27 and its central role in tumor suppression."

https://openalex.org/W2068832660,"The Dok adaptor family of proteins binding to RasGAP, consisting of Dok-1 and Dok-2, are critical regulators in cell proliferation. These molecules are partners and/or substrates of different protein tyrosine kinases considered as oncoproteins. Here, we show that Dok-1 and Dok-2 are the major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins associated to Tec, a protein tyrosine kinase expressed in T cells. Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of Dok-1 or Dok-2 on Tec-mediated signalling pathways in T cells. Here, we provide evidence that Dok-1 and Dok-2 proteins are involved in a negative feedback regulation of Tec via a downregulation of its tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream signalling pathways including the Ras pathway. Either Dok-1 or Dok-2 therefore represents a mean of potent retrograde control for protein tyrosine kinase signalling, and then possibly of tumor development."

https://openalex.org/W2007944586,"Using Cre-Lox technology to inducibly delete Rb from wild-type, p21- and/or p53-deficient primary hepatocytes, we investigated the role of p53, p21 and pRb in the regulation of liver cell proliferation, polyploidization and death. These cellular decisions are critical to maintaining liver cell replacement in disease, and in determining the likelihood of carcinogenesis in chronic liver injury. Clearly, the present study shows a complex interplay between p53, p21 and pRb, which regulates the likelihood of hepatocytes stimulated from quiescence, to proliferate, undergo polyploidy or die. It reveals that these proteins act both in concert and independently, demonstrating that a small set of key cellular players is common to diverse cell decisions of fundamental importance to disease."
https://openalex.org/W2023584645,"rel/nf-kappaB genes are amplified, overexpressed, or constitutively activated in many human hematopoietic tumors; however, the molecular mechanisms by which they contribute to tumorigenesis remain to be determined. Here, we explored the oncogenic potential of cellular Rel/NF-kappaB proteins in vitro and in vivo. We show that overexpression of wild-type mouse and human c-rel genes suffices to malignantly transform primary spleen cells in stringent soft agar assays and produce fatal tumors in vivo. In contrast relA and a constitutively active form of IKKbeta did not. Importantly, a hybrid RelA protein with its C-terminal transactivation domain substituted by that of v-Rel was potently oncogenic in vitro and in vivo. The transactivation domain of v-Rel selectively conferred an oncogenic phenotype upon the Rel homology domain (RHD) of RelA, but not to the more divergent RHDs of p50/NF-kappaB1, p52/NF-kappaB2, or RelB. Collectively, our results highlight important differences in the intrinsic oncogenic activity of mammalian c-Rel and RelA proteins, and indicate that critical determinants of their differential oncogenicity reside in their divergent transactivation domains. These findings provide experimental evidence for a role of mammalian Rel/NF-kappaB factors in leukemia/lymphomagenesis in an in vivo animal model, and are consistent with the implication of c-rel in many human lymphomas."
https://openalex.org/W1990265744,"Smad4 is a critical component in transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling and frequently mutated in pancreatic and colorectal cancers. Smad4 has two important functional domains, MH1 and MH2, that are involved in different biological processes. The MH1 domain comprises a DNA binding domain and the MH2 domain is mainly implicated in transcriptional activation and homo- and heteromeric complex formation among Smad proteins. In the present study, a total of nine Smad4 mutations at both MH1 and MH2 domains were analysed and all of them had a reduced activity to stimulate transcription of a TGF-β-responsive reporter gene. All four MH1 mutations had a markedly reduced ability to bind a consensus Smad binding element by an in vitro assay using GST fusion proteins. Among the MH2 mutations, R497H, K507Q, and R515G mutations of Smad4 gave rise to a reduced DNA binding capacity. The R497H mutation had a slightly reduced interaction with Smad2 upon activation of TGF-β receptor. However, the K507Q and R515G mutations greatly lost their ability to associate with Smad2. Using a GST pull-down assay, it was found that the Smad4 MH2 domain bearing R497H and R515G mutations had an enhanced interaction with the MH1 region of the Smad4 protein, indicating that an increased intramolecular interaction by these mutations may alleviate the DNA binding activity at the MH1 domain. Consistent with these observations, the MH2 domain with R497H mutation had an enhanced ability to inhibit TGF-β receptor-mediated transcription. In addition, the full-length R497H mutation was able to antagonize TGF-β signaling in a dominant-negative manner. Therefore, these studies revealed novel mechanisms by which the Smad4 mutations utilize to abrogate their functions in transducing the signaling of TGF-β, which plays an important role in various stages of cancer formation."

https://openalex.org/W1982160153,"Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is a multifunctional tumour suppressor protein, central to development and the mature organism. It is mutated in most cases of colorectal cancer, rendering it ineffective in mediating beta-catenin degradation. We show that localization of full-length APC in colon carcinoma and noncancer cell lines is independent of cell density. However, the location of truncated APC is a function of cell density and in high-density cells truncated APC is predominantly not nuclear. Although the distribution of truncated APC and beta-catenin is closely linked in subconfluent SW480 cells, at high cell density they are not colocalized. We postulated that in this cell line this could be due to an increase in beta-catenin bound to E-cadherin with formation of adherens junctions at high cell density. However, while in coimmunoprecipitation assays we observe an increase in binding between beta-catenin and E-cadherin and a corresponding decrease in binding between beta-catenin and APC at high cell density, we did not observe a strict colocalization of beta-catenin and E-cadherin at the membrane of all cells."
