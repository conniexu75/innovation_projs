https://openalex.org/W1918014554,"Previously, levels of a novel human mRNA, detected by a recombinant cDNA designated clone 1, were shown to be increased 50-fold in response to treatment of a keratinocyte cell line with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), in part as a function of increased rates of gene transcription (Sutter, T.R., Guzman, K., Dold, K.M., and Greenlee, W.F. (1991) Science 254, 415-418). Here we report the complete corresponding 5.1-kilobase cDNA sequence. A single open reading frame that predicts a protein of 543 amino acid residues was determined by computer-assisted analysis of the cDNA sequence. This predicted protein identifies a new gene subfamily of cytochrome P450, cytochrome P4501B1 (CYP1B1), that maps to human chromosome 2. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA indicates that the human CYP1B subfamily is likely to contain only this single gene. Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from primary cultures of normal human epidermal keratinocytes showed approximately 100-fold increased levels of the CYP1B1 mRNA after treatment with 10 nM TCDD for 24 h. Low levels of constitutive CYP1B1 mRNA were detected in 15 different human tissue samples. These results indicate that CYP1B1 is expressed in many normal human tissues and advance our understanding of the complexity of a gene family of cytochromes P450 whose expression is altered by TCDD."
https://openalex.org/W1592606160,"A glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, inhibited the production of a leukocyte chemotactic cytokine, interleukin 8 (IL-8), as well as mRNA expression by a glioblastoma cell line, T98G, stimulated with interleukin 1 (IL-1). Dexamethasone also inhibited IL-8 promoter-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activities induced by IL-1, suggesting that dexamethasone inhibited IL-8 production mainly at the transcriptional level. Moreover, CAT assay revealed that the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) binding site was the crucial cis-element required for conferring IL-1 responsiveness in conjunction with the CCAAT enhancer binding protein/nuclear factor-IL-6 (NF-IL6) and/or the AP-1 binding site(s). Mutation of either the AP-1 or NF-IL6 binding site did not abolish IL-8 gene repression by dexamethasone, suggesting that these sites were not targets for dexamethasone. Trimerized kappa B sequence in the IL-8 gene was enough for conferring the induction by IL-1 and inhibition by dexamethasone of CAT activity. Finally, dexamethasone diminished the IL-1-induced formation of NF-kappa B complexes, which were identified immunochemically to consist of p50 and p65, without reducing the amount of translocated factors. Collectively, dexamethasone interfered with the binding of the most essential transcription factor, NF-kappa B, to its cognate cis-element, thereby suppressing the transcription of IL-8 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1596063778,"We have investigated the possible effect of estrogen on the metabolism of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP). Using a cell line that contains high levels of estrogen receptors, we have found that treatment with physiological concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol is associated with accumulation in the conditioned medium of an amino-terminal cleavage product of APP (soluble APP or protease nexin-2), indicative of non-amyloidogenic processing. There were no obvious changes in the levels of intracellular immature or mature APP holoproteins, suggesting that estrogen may increase the secretory metabolism of APP."
https://openalex.org/W1660326086,"Aspirin (acetylsalicylate) treatment of human (h) prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase (PGHS)-1 expressed in cos-1 cells caused a time-dependent inactivation of oxygenase activity. Aspirin treatment of hPGHS-2 produced an enzyme which retained oxygenase activity but formed exclusively 15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) instead of PGH2. The 15-HETE was exclusively of the 15R configuration. The Km values for arachidonate of native and aspirin-treated hPGHS-2 were about the same suggesting that arachidonate binds to both aspirin-treated and native hPGHS-2 in a similar manner. If, as expected, the formation of 15R-HETE proceeds through abstraction of the 13proS hydrogen from arachidonate, O2 insertion must occur from the same side as the hydrogen abstraction; with all other lipoxygenases and cyclooxygenases, O2 addition is antarafacial. When microsomal hPGHS-2 was incubated with [acetyl-14C]aspirin, the enzyme was acetylated. An S516A mutant of hPGHS-2, which retains enzyme activity, was not acetylated. This indicates that Ser-516 is the of aspirin acetylation of hPGHS-2; this residue is homologous to the site serine of PGHS-1. An S516N mutant of hPGHS-2 was catalytically active; in contrast, an S516Q mutant lacked cyclooxygenase but retained peroxidase activity. Because in the case of PGHS-1 a smaller asparagine substitution is sufficient to eliminate cyclooxygenase activity, we conclude that the active of PGHS-2 is slightly larger than that of PGHS-1. An S516M mutant of hPGHS-2 was obtained which resembled aspirin-acetylated hPGHS-2 in that this mutant made 15R-HETE as its major product; however, unlike the aspirin-acetylated hPGHS-2, the Km value of the S516M mutant for arachidonate was 100 times that of native hPGHS-2."
https://openalex.org/W1508200717,"The amino acid sequence requirements for androgen-dependent androgen receptor nuclear import were determined by immunostaining transiently expressed full-length wild type and mutant human androgen receptors (AR) in monkey kidney COS cells and measuring transcriptional activity by cotransfection with a luciferase reporter vector in monkey kidney CV1 cells. Mutagenesis studies revealed a bipartite nuclear targeting sequence in the DNA binding and hinge regions at amino acids 617-633, consisting of two clusters of basic amino acids separated by 10 amino acids, (sequence: see text). In a series of deletion mutants, AR NH2-terminal fragments (residues 1-639 through 1-723) displayed constitutive nuclear import, and transcriptional activity was similar to that of the ligand-activated full-length wild type AR. In contrast, nuclear import and transcriptional activation were inhibited by sequence extensions into the steroid-binding domain (1-771). Constitutive nuclear import was regained in part by NH2-terminal deletions of full-length AR. Expression of AR/pyruvate kinase chimeras defined a sequence required for pre-dominant nuclear localization as residues 580-661, comprised of the second zinc finger region of the DNA-binding domain, the 17-amino-acid putative targeting sequence, and 28 residues of flanking carboxyl-terminal sequence. These studies suggest that the bipartite nuclear targeting sequence of AR includes flanking sequence and is modulated by interactions between the NH2-and carboxyl-terminal regions."
https://openalex.org/W1585329182,"Singlet oxygen formation by photosystem II reaction centers isolated from Pisum sativum has been detected by two chemical trapping techniques: histidine-dependent oxygen uptake and bleaching of p-nitrosodimethyl-aniline by the intermediary endoperoxide of histidine. The quantum yield of singlet oxygen formation determined by these methods was estimated to be 0.16 by comparison with the known quantum yields of standard singlet oxygen sensitizers. Singlet oxygen was formed on illumination of reaction centers under conditions that lead to formation of the triplet state of the primary electron donor, P680. Experiments with deuterated buffer and active oxygen scavengers indicated that singlet oxygen was the only active oxygen species produced by this reaction. Neither azide nor histidine, which are scavengers of singlet oxygen, protected against photobleaching of the chlorophyll of reaction centers that occurs concomitantly with singlet oxygen formation, suggesting that bleaching involves singlet oxygen generated within the protein matrix of the complex. Singlet oxygen sensitized exogenously by rose bengal (when excited specifically at 550 nm) was also found to bleach reaction center chlorophyll in a manner similar to the intrinsic mechanism. We conclude that singlet oxygen formed within the hydrophobic interior of the reaction center attacks the chlorophylls of P680, and presumably also amino acids in the vicinity, and that only the singlet oxygen that escapes to the medium is affected by added scavengers or deuterated medium. These experiments extend our earlier report of the detection of singlet oxygen by its luminescence at 1270 nm when isolated photosystem II reaction centers are illuminated (Macpherson, A. N., Telfer, A., Barber, J., and Truscott, T. G. (1993) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1143, 301-309). Moreover, our results support the hypothesis that production of singlet oxygen underlies the vulnerability of photosystem II to photodamage and hence necessitates the rapid turnover of the D1 protein of the reaction center."
https://openalex.org/W1547205359,"The rat prolactin receptor (PRLR) exists as two forms, short and long. We have developed a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) in order to measure the absolute number of mRNA molecules encoding both forms of PRLR in 16 tissues of adult female rats at two stages of the estrous cycle (proestrus and diestrus I) and in the mammary gland of 20-day pregnant and 7-day lactating rats. Using this technique, it was possible to detect as few as 500 molecules of a target mRNA per micrograms of total RNA. All tissues examined expressed the two forms of receptor transcripts, ranging from 1.8 x 10(3) molecules/micrograms of total RNA in the skeletal muscle to 2.9 x 10(7) molecules/micrograms of total RNA in the ovary. Fourteen tissues expressed the long form mRNA predominantly, the thymus and the kidney expressed both forms equally, and the liver expressed the short form predominantly. In the liver, the level of mRNA expression of the short form was approximately 2-fold higher in proestrus than in diestrus. In the ovary, uterus, and cerebral cortex, the expression of the long form transcript was higher in proestrus than in diestrus: 4-fold in the ovary, 2.8-fold in the uterus, and 1.4-fold in the cerebral cortex. In contrast, the hypothalamus and the pituitary expressed 1.6-fold more long form transcript in diestrus than in proestrus. These results indicate that PRLR mRNA is ubiquitously but variably expressed in a tissue-specific manner and is clearly regulated by the hormonal environment associated with the stage of the estrous cycle, pregnancy, and lactation."
https://openalex.org/W1593834989,"The beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) specifically phosphorylates the activated form of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR) and related G protein-coupled receptors. To further elucidate the role of beta ARK in receptor desensitization, we generated a beta ARK dominant negative mutant by converting an invariant lysine residue in the protein kinase catalytic domain to an arginine. Expressed and purified beta ARK-K220R was able to inhibit wild type beta ARK phosphorylation of the beta 2AR in vitro. When stably transfected into human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells, beta ARK-K220R promoted a > 2-fold increase in beta-agonist-stimulated cAMP production without affecting beta 2AR sequestration. In contrast, beta ARK-K220R had no effect on the desensitization of the prostaglandin E2 receptor response in BEAS-2B cells. These findings directly demonstrate a role for beta ARK in desensitization of the beta 2AR in intact cells and establish the potential utility of using dominant negative mutants to elucidate the substrate specificity of G protein-coupled receptor kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1569767833,"Two myeloma cell lines, MPC-11 and P3X63Ag8.653 (P3), have almost identical amounts of syndecan-1 at their cell surface. The syndecan-1 molecules from both lines are similar in size, have indistinguishable core proteins, and have similarly sized heparan sulfate chains. Nevertheless, syndecan-1 on MPC-11 mediates cell adhesion to type I collagen, whereas P3 cells do not bind collagen. Affinity co-electrophoresis reveals that intact syndecan-1 isolated from P3 cells binds collagen poorly and that syndecan-1 heparan sulfate isolated from MPC-11 has a 20-fold higher affinity for collagen than syndecan-1 heparan sulfate from P3. Analysis of disaccharide composition and oligosaccharide mapping also reveals differences between MPC-11 and P3 heparan sulfate. Most notably, the level of N-sulfation and 2-O-sulfation is higher, and 6-O-sulfation lower, in syndecan-1 heparan sulfate from MPC-11 than from P3. Interestingly, levels of total sulfation of syndecan-1 heparan sulfate from MPC-11 and P3 are similar (75.6 and 72.6 sulfates/100 disaccharides, respectively), indicating that the difference in their affinity for collagen is not due to a difference in net charge. These data indicate that the fine structure of heparan sulfate can differ on identical proteoglycan core proteins, and these differences can control fundamental cellular properties such as cell-matrix adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W1750871115,"Recombinant latent human procathepsin B produced in yeast was purified to near homogeneity. The purified recombinant proenzyme is activated in vitro under acidic conditions resulting in rapid conversion into the mature form of the proteinase. Activation as well as proteolytic maturation of the recombinant cathepsin B precursor were shown to be primarily concentration-independent processes indicating a unimolecular (i.e. intramolecular) mechanism. Only one cleavage site was identified, yielding a mature polypeptide with the same amino-terminal sequence as that found in recombinant active human cathepsin B obtained from yeast culture media. The same peptide bond is cleaved during processing of a nonactivatable mutant of procathepsin B by the purified mature enzyme (i.e. intermolecular processing). Thus, the complete proregion is liberated during procathepsin B processing. This peptide may then act as a reversible inhibitor and stabilizer of the mature proteinase, and it appears likely that cathepsin B-propeptide complexes occur transiently during proteolytic maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1517646929,"We have previously demonstrated that the coated vesicle vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) can be inactivated by formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds (Feng, Y., and Forgac, M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 19769-19772). The disulfide bond responsible for inactivation can be distinguished from other disulfide bonds that form by the fact that formation of the inactivating disulfide bond is blocked by ATP or high ionic strength. By taking advantage of these properties, we selectively labeled the ATPase at the relevant cysteine residues with fluorescein maleimide. After analyzing the proteolytic fragments that contain the labeled cysteine residues, we found that cysteine 254 and cysteine 532 in subunit A of the bovine V-ATPase are the residues that form the disulfide bond resulting in inactivation of the enzyme. Cysteine 254 and cysteine 532 correspond to 2 of the 3 cysteine residues that are conserved in all available V-ATPase A subunit sequences. Cysteine 254 is located in the consensus motif, G(X)4GKT, corresponding to residues 250-257, which is conserved in many nucleotide binding proteins. Cysteine 532 is located in a region not previously shown to be in proximity to the nucleotide binding site. Modification of cysteine 254 by disulfide bond formation with cysteine 532 or thio-disulfide exchange with cystine does not impair binding of 2-azido-[32P]ATP to the A subunit. The inhibition is therefore likely caused by disruption of the catalytic function of the ATPase on formation of the disulfide bond. A possible role in regulating intracellular acidification by reversible sulfhydryl oxidation and reduction is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1594910624,"Signal transduction initiated by transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1) was studied in two sublines of the same colon carcinoma cell line, which respond in opposite ways to TGF beta 1, by proliferation or by growth inhibition. TGF beta 1 activates ras proteins within 5 min of addition when it acts to inhibit growth but not when it acts as a mitogen. In both cases TGF beta 1 also rapidly modulates the activities of three protein kinases, detected by their in gel kinase activity on the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) substrate, myelin basic protein (MBP). When TGF beta 1 acts as a mitogen for U9 cells, it increases the activity of MBP kinases of 57, 105, and 130 kDa within 10 min of the addition without detectably activating ras proteins. When TGF beta 1 inhibits the growth of HD3 cells, it activates ras proteins and the 57-kDa MBP kinase within 5 min but inhibits the activity of the 105- and 130-kDa MBP kinases. In HD3 cells ras activation occurred in two signal transduction pathways, one from TGF beta 1 leading to growth inhibition and one from epidermal growth factor (EGF) leading to proliferation. In addition to ras proteins, EGF activates a different set of MBP kinases in HD3 cells than does TGF beta 1, MBP kinases of 85, 57, and 44 kDa. The latter is likely to be the 44-kDa MAP kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) 1, because EGF treatment of HD3 cells activates erk1 by increasing its phosphotyrosine level. Therefore, in two closely related epithelial cell lines TGF beta 1 activates two different signal transduction pathways, one ras-dependent and one ras-independent, and modulates the activities of a set of MBP kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1558838236,"We undertook these studies to explore the intracellular signaling mechanisms activated by a newly described human brain melanocortin receptor (hMC3R). Hepa cells transfected with the hMC3R gene responded to stimulation with alpha-melanocyte stimulation hormone (alpha-MSH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) with dose-dependent increases in cellular content of cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) reaching a maximum of over 1500% of control cells at the 10(-8) M dose (EC50 = 10(-11) M). In contrast, the production of [3H]inositol phosphates in cells prelabeled with myo-[2-3H]inositol exhibited a biphasic dose-response curve with increases as high as 155% of basal at 10(-11) M alpha-MSH or ACTH, but beyond that a dose-dependent decrease was observed. The inhibitory component of the dose-response curve could be abolished by pretreatment of transfected cells with the cAMP antagonist (Rp)-adenosine 3',5'-monophosphorothioate (Rp-cAMP) or the protein kinase A inhibitor H-89. Increases in intracellular calcium induced in transfected cells by alpha-MSH in doses ranging from 10(-11) to 10(-7) M could not be observed unless the cells were pretreated with H-89. By replacing the third intracytoplasmic loop of the canine H2-histamine receptor with that of hMC3R the biphasic characteristic of agonist-induced production of [3H]inositol phosphates was conferred to the chimeric receptor. These data indicate that the hMC3R is coupled to both cAMP and inositol phospholipid/Ca(2+)-mediated post-receptor signaling systems and that the latter response is regulated by protein kinase A activity."
https://openalex.org/W1488029276,"Basement membranes were previously believed to contain five distinct type IV collagen subunits. We have recently isolated part of the cDNA for a novel type IV collagen, alpha 6(IV), and shown that COL4A6, the gene encoding this new chain, is deleted in Alport syndrome-associated leiomyomatosis (Zhou, J., Mochizuki, T., Smeets, H., Antignac, C., Laurila, P., de Paepe, A., Tryggvason, K., and Reeders, S. T. (1993) Science 261, 1167-1169). Here, we describe the entire human alpha 6(IV) cDNA and show that the gene encodes a classical type IV collagen with homology throughout its length to all the other five chains. There is a 21-residue signal peptide, a 1417-residue collagenous domain interrupted at 25 points, and a 228-residue carboxyl-terminal non-collagenous domain. When the complete primary structure of this new chain was compared with all the other known chains, it became clear that alpha 6(IV) has the most resemblance to alpha 2(IV) and alpha 4(IV). The evolution of the six chains was deduced, allowing a new classification of the type IV collagen family. The alpha 6(IV) chain is a candidate gene for X-linked Alport syndrome; knowledge of the complete structure of the chain will permit us to screen systematically for mutations in patients and to generate recombinant proteins and synthetic peptides for further study of cell-matrix interactions involving the alpha 6(IV) chain."
https://openalex.org/W1583407009,"The presence of bound substrate protein increases the thermostability of hsp70 molecular chaperones (heat shock proteins of molecular mass 70 kDa). Complexes between hsp70 and unfolded substrate proteins were isolated by size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography. The isolated complexes were observed to dissociate at a significant rate even in the absence of ATP. The presence of ADP caused a substantial increase in the stability of the complex. Both ADP and inorganic phosphate were found to inhibit the ATP-induced dissociation of complex. ADP was also observed to increase both the rate of complex formation and its stability as a function of temperature, suggesting an important regulatory role for nucleotides during heat shock. Circular dichroism and fluorescence studies of the complex between DnaK and a thermally unstable mutant of staphylococcal nuclease indicate that the bound substrate protein is significantly unfolded. A model for hsp70 cycle of complex formation and dissociation, which accounts for the regulatory role of nucleotides, is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1551079448,"Thyroid hormone (3,5,3'-triiodothyronine) positively regulates transcription of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ATPase gene in rat heart, and sequences within 559 nucleotides upstream from the transcription start site confer thyroid hormone responsiveness upon a reporter gene. In the present study, three thyroid hormone-response elements (TREs) are identified between nucleotides -485 and -190. Each TRE is active in transient transfection assays and specifically binds 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine receptors (TRs) alpha 1 and beta 1 alone and in combination with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) alpha and beta. TRE 1 is a direct repeat of two half-sites separated by four nucleotides; TREs 2 and 3 are inverted palindromes of two half-sites separated by four and six nucleotides, respectively. Methylation interference analysis of TRE 1 showed binding of a TR alpha 1 monomer to the 3' half-site, whereas the heterodimer contacts both half-sites. Subsequent studies employed TR beta and RXR alpha mutants in which their P-boxes were replaced with the P-box of the glucocorticoid receptor. Bandshifts of wild type and mutant proteins with either wild type TRE 1 or a mutant version, in which the 5' half-site was converted to a glucocorticoid response element half-site, demonstrated preferential binding of RXR to the 5' half-site and of TR to the 3' half-site of TRE 1."
https://openalex.org/W1563012803,"The complement receptor type 1 (CR1; CD35), carrying 30 short consensus repeats (SCRs), has two sites. Site 1 contains SCR-1 and SCR-2 and binds C4b. Site 2 contains SCR-8 and SCR-9 and was reported to bind mainly C3b (Klickstein, L. B., Bartow, T. J., Miletic, V., Rabson, L. D., Smith, J. A., and Fearon, D. T. (1988) J. Exp. Med. 168, 1699-1717). For the functional analysis we used two constructs, each with one site. CR1-4, composed of eight and one-half initial SCRs, carries site 1, binds C4b, and is cofactor for C4b cleavage. CR1-4(8,9), obtained from CR1-4 by converting site 1 to site 2, binds iC3/C3b and, unexpectedly, C4b. It is a cofactor for cleavage of both ligands. Its cofactor activity for C4b cleavage is greater than that of site 1. Analysis of the mutants constructed by interchanging homologous peptides between the two sites identified no sequences necessary for cofactor activity other than those required for binding. In site 2, peptides important for both ligands were found. Some modifications of either site led to higher activity for both ligands. Thus the activity of complement regulators can be increased by changing a few amino acids within SCRs, an important step toward the generation of more effective inhibitors of complement activation. Knowledge of the active sites of CR1 should be applicable to other SCR-containing proteins and should provide insights into the evolution of these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1573326691,"We have employed differential screening of a rat aortic smooth muscle cell cDNA library to isolate a cDNA clone, SM-20, whose nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences are distinct from those reported previously. SM-20 encodes an mRNA of approximately 2.5-3.0 kilobase pairs which is present at low levels in quiescent vascular smooth muscle cells. SM-20 levels increase within 1 h of treatment with growth agonists (serum, platelet-derived growth factor, angiotensin II), isoproterenol, and forskolin. Cycloheximide induces high levels of SM-20 mRNA and superinduces it in the presence of serum, suggesting that the increase in SM-20 mRNA levels is not dependent on protein synthesis and is part of the primary response to growth agonists. SM-20 is expressed at high levels in tissues and cells derived from muscle (smooth, skeletal, and cardiac) and nerve (brain, PC12 cells) and is not expressed in 3T3 fibroblasts or rat 6 fibroblasts. SM-20 encodes a new member of the immediate early gene family and is unusual in that it is expressed in vascular smooth muscle, but not in fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1538054838,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) increases the cellular uptake and degradation of LDL by fibroblasts and macrophages via a heparin-sensitive process. The roles of the LDL receptor, LDL receptor-related protein (LRP), and proteoglycans in this process were studied. In up-regulated human fibroblasts, LPL increased degradation of 125I-low density lipoprotein (LDL) (5 micrograms/ml) only 30% during a 6-h incubation at 37 degrees C. Monoclonal antibody 47 (which interacts with the receptor binding region of apoB) decreased LDL degradation 93% in the absence of LPL, but did not reduce the LPL-mediated increase in degradation. In contrast, addition of the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) caused a 43% decrease in the LPL-dependent LDL degradation in non-up-regulated fibroblasts. Monoclonal antibody 47 did not decrease LDL degradation by THP-1 macrophages and RAP caused a 30% of pericellular heparan sulfate was lost between 2-4 h of the chase period. Therefore, some of the LPL-mediated LDL degradation in the THP-1 cells could be accounted for by internalization of cell surface proteoglycans. We conclude that LRP, but not the LDL receptor, is involved in LPL-mediated degradation of LDL in fibroblasts. This process is much more rapid in THP-1 cells and in addition to LRP may involve other receptors and internalization of proteoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W1603519222,"Abstract Yeasts p13suc1/p18CKS and their human homologues, p9CKShs1/p9CKShs2, strongly interact with p34cdc2 and p34cdk2. While attempting to purify the starfish oocyte p13suc1 homologue, we discovered a 15-kDa protein cross-reactive with anti-p9CKShs2/anti-p13suc1 antibodies. p15cdk-BP-Sepharose binds an anti-PSTAIRE cross-reactive protein of 33 kDa when loaded with starfish oocyte extracts. The p15cdk-BP-bound PSTAIRE signal is part of a 250-kDa complex distinct from p34cdc2/cyclin B. p15cdk-BP-Sepharose beads retain a kinase phosphorylating HMG I/Y, P1, and myelin basic protein (among 24 substrates tested). Major cdc2 kinase substrates are not phosphorylated by the p15cdk-BP-bound kinase. Phosphopeptide maps of P1 phosphorylated by the p15cdk-BP-bound kinase, p34cdc2/cyclin B, p 33cdk5/p25, and casein kinase 2 showed that these kinases phosphorylate P1 on different sites. Phosphopeptide maps of P1 phosphorylated by the p15cdk-BP-bound starfish kinase and p15cdk-BP-bound human p34cdk4/cyclin D are largely coincident. To investigate the nature of the p15cdk-BP-bound kinase, extracts of mammalian tissues and cells were loaded on p9CKShs1- and p15cdk-BP-Sepharose and the bound proteins were analyzed using specific anti-cdk antibodies. cdc2 and cdk2 bind to p9CKShs1-Sepharose, but not to p15cdk-BP. cdk4 and cdk5 bind to p15cdk-BP-Sepharose, but not to p9CKShs1-Sepharose. We conclude that p15cdk-BP specifically binds the cdk4/cyclin D and cdk5 kinases and, along with p13suc1 and p9CKShs, may be part of a larger family of cdk-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1523746167,"In a previous study, we have shown that in vivo expression of the cerebellar Purkinje cell-specific gene Pcp-2 is regulated by thyroid hormone (T3) during neonatal development. In addition, transient cotransfection studies using thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) and a Pcp-2-lacZ construct pointed to direct regulation of Pcp-2 gene expression by T3. Therefore, we have initiated the following series of studies to define more precisely the location of the thyroid hormone regulatory elements in the Pcp-2 gene. By transfection and in vitro receptor binding analyses, we have identified two thyroid hormone response elements, A1 (-295/-268) and B1 (+207/+227). A1 contains a central half-site flanked by two similar half-sites. B1 contains two pairs of alternate half-sites. When these elements were ligated to the modified mouse mammary tumor virus promoter (delta MMTV), both induced a 8-14-fold expression of the reporter gene, but only in the presence of T3. Gel mobility assays demonstrated that both A1 and B1 bind TRs in the presence of thyroid hormone receptor auxiliary proteins or the retinoid X beta receptor. Mutations of the G residues to T within the individual half-site sequences of A1 caused a variable decrease in the transactivation of the MMTV-CAT construct and a corresponding reduction in TR binding in vitro. Thus, mutational analysis of A1 pointed to the interaction of the flanking half-site motifs with the central AGGTCA half-site. Interestingly, lengthening of the A1 sequence at its 3'-end caused a progressive dampening of the T3 response. The results suggest that the neighboring sequence may function as a silencer of the A1 element. Since thyroid hormone regulation of Pcp-2 is manifest only during the first 2 weeks after birth, we hypothesize that A1 and B1 act as T3-dependent response elements operative only during early neonatal Purkinje cell development and that their function is suppressed by a neighboring silencer element operative when expression of Pcp-2 becomes hormone-independent."
https://openalex.org/W1552471169,"Expression of the apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) gene in the liver is controlled by a liver-specific enhancer. The function of this enhancer depends on synergistic interactions between transcription factors bound to at least three sites (designated A, B, and C) located within this enhancer. We have previously shown that an apoAI gene reporter construct containing the entire enhancer is expressed efficiently in a hepatoma cell line and that its activity is repressed by the orphan receptor ARP-1. Moreover, repression by ARP-1 is overcome by the retinoid X receptor RXR alpha in the presence of retinoic acid. In this study, we show that ARP-1 represses the apoAI promoter by binding to site A of the apoAI liver-specific enhancer, the repression being a promoter context-specific event. Mapping analysis of ARP-1 indicated that its DNA binding domain is essential but not sufficient for repression. Two separate repression domains located at the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of ARP-1 were found to individually complement the DNA binding domain for efficient repression. We also demonstrate the reversibility of ARP-1 repression by transcription factors C/EBP and Egr-1, which might also be involved in apoAI gene expression. Significantly, repression by ARP-1 was found to be a prerequisite for C/EBP-mediated transactivation.

Previously, we demonstrated that ZP3, the acrosome reaction-inducing component of mouse ZP, activates one or more Gi subtypes in isolated sperm membranes (Ward, C. R., Storey, B. T., and Kopf, G. S. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 14061-14067). To determine the identity of the Gi subtype(s) activated in the sperm, we examined ligand-dependent decreases in pertussis toxin-catalyzed in vitro [32P]ADP-ribosylation of the different Gi alpha subtypes that were identified by immunoprecipitation using Gi alpha-specific antisera. Membranes treated with solubilized ZP or mastoparan and subsequently [32P]ADP-ribosylated using pertussis toxin displayed 35 and 56% decreases, respectively, in [32P]ADP-ribosylation when compared with controls. These changes were quantitatively similar to the percentage increases in 35S-labeled guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) binding in membranes treated with equivalent concentrations of ZP or mastoparan (Ward et al., 1992). Immunoprecipitation with Gi alpha subtype-specific antisera and subsequent autoradiography revealed that mastoparan activated Gi1, Gi2, and Gi3 in the membranes. ZP, in contrast, selectively activated Gi1 and Gi2. These data demonstrate that the egg's extracellular matrix has the ability to activate selectively sperm membrane Gi subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2157362350,"Sphingolipids stimulate the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. However, the mechanism by which this process occurs has not been characterized. Through single-channel recording from microsomes incorporated into planar lipid bilayers, we describe a novel channel that gates Ba2+ in response to sphingosylphosphorylcholine. The channel is both ligand-gated and voltage-modulated. Maximal open probability is observed between -10 and -20 mV and has a relatively high conductance (160 picosiemens with 53 mM Ba2+). We also observe that Ca2+ efflux from permeabilized rat basophilic leukemia cells is not antagonized by heparin, La3+, Ni2+, nifedipine, or omega-conotoxin GVIa. The sphingolipid-gated Ca(2+)-permeable channel is therefore a new member of the Ca(2+)-permeable, ligand-gated channel family."
https://openalex.org/W1560207274,"The GTP-dependent interaction of ADP ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) with Golgi membranes is required for the binding of cytosolic coatomer proteins to those membranes. Whereas both GTP and GTP gamma S can support coatomer binding to membranes, by using partially purified components, GTP-driven binding is rapidly reversible (t1/2 of 2 min) while that driven by GTP gamma S is more stable (t1/2 of over 30 min). In the presence of GTP, aluminum fluoride, an activator of trimeric G proteins, promotes the stable ARF-dependent binding of coatomer to membranes, even though this reagent does not itself activate ARF. Aluminum fluoride appears to act, like GTP gamma S, to make the binding of coatomer relatively irreversible. It acts to inhibit ARF-GTP hydrolysis catalyzed by the membrane and thus makes the ARF-GTP active state persistent. This effect is not dependent on the presence of any cytosolic component, such as the coatomer. The number of molecules of ARF that can be protected from hydrolysis by aluminum fluoride, however, is only a fraction of the total amount of ARF that can bind to membranes in the presence of GTP gamma S. We propose that this population defines a set of binding sites that are sufficient for coat protein assembly onto the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1573328658,"ATP (CTP):tRNA nucleotidyltransferase catalyzes the addition of the CCA end to tRNAs. In yeast, nucleotidyltransferase is encoded by the CCA1 gene and is localized to three cellular compartments: mitochondria, nucleus, and cytosol. There are three in-frame ATGs near the 5‘ end of the CCA1 open reading frame. Primer extension experiments show multiple transcription initiation sites upstream of ATG1 and between ATG1 and ATG2. Fractionation of cells carrying a CCA1-COXIV fusion gene demonstrates that all three in-frame AUGs are used as sites of initiation of translation. Therefore, both transcription of CCA1 mRNA with heterogeneous 5‘ ends and translation from downstream AUGs in CCA1 mRNAs play a role in the synthesis of three nucleotidyltransferase isozymes. Protein initiating from AUG1 is required for mitochondrial protein synthesis and, like many other proteins targeted to mitochondria, it is processed at the amino terminus upon import into the organelle. The shorter proteins arising from AUG2 and AUG3 provide nuclear/cytosol activity."
https://openalex.org/W1571817303,"Ryanodine receptors/Ca2+ release channels play an important role in regulating the intracellular free calcium concentrations in both muscle and nonmuscle cells. Ryanodine, a neutral plant alkaloid, specifically binds to and modulates these Ca2+ release channels. In the work described here, we characterize the interaction of a tritium-labeled, photoactivable derivative of ryanodine (3H-labeled 10-O-[3-(4-azidobenzamido)propionyl]ryanodine ([3H]ABRy)) with the ryanodine receptor of skeletal, cardiac, and brain membranes. Scatchard analysis demonstrates that this ligand binds to a single class of high affinity sites in skeletal muscle triads. Furthermore, competition binding assays of [3H]ryanodine with skeletal, cardiac, and brain membranes in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled ABRy illustrate that this azido derivative of ryanodine is able to specifically displace [3H]ryanodine from its binding site(s). Analysis of the effects of Ca2+, ATP, and KCl on [3H]ABRy binding in triad membranes shows a similar modulation of binding to that seen in these membranes with [3H]ryanodine. Photoaffinity labeling of triads with [3H]ABRy resulted in specific and covalent incorporation of [3H]ABRy into a 565-kDa protein that was shown to be the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor. Digestion of the labeled ryanodine receptor revealed a [3H]ABRy-labeled 76-kDa tryptic fragment that was identified with an antibody directed against the COOH-terminal of the receptor. These results demonstrate that the 76-kDa COOH-terminal tryptic fragment contains the high affinity binding site for ryanodine."

A similar, catalytically active, high molecular mass form of recombinant human cathepsin B produced in yeast has now been found to represent a noncovalent complex between the 30-kDa single chain enzyme and its 6-kDa propeptide formed during autocatalytic maturation of the proenzyme (see accompanying article; Mach, L., Mort, J. S., and Glossl, J. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 13030-13035). Incubation of the complex under acidic conditions resulted in dissociation and degradation of the inhibitory propeptide leading to increased enzymatic activity, as also observed for partially purified cathepsin B isoenzymes from purulent sputum and mammary tumor explant media. The stabilization of the processed proteinase as a noncovalent complex with its proregion provides an important mechanism whereby extracellular cathepsin B can lie dormant until regional acidification mediates its activity."
https://openalex.org/W1536021967,"Previous studies have shown that beta 3-adrenergic receptors, in contrast to the beta 1 and beta 2 subtypes, do not undergo desensitization following short term activation (minutes) with agonists. Longer activation (hours) has been shown to induce desensitization of the beta 3-adrenergic receptor in some, but not all, cases, suggesting that cell- or species-specific mechanisms may be involved. We investigated the contribution of the cell type to the pattern of beta 3-adrenergic receptor long term desensitization by studying, in parallel, two cell lines (Chinese hamster fibroblasts and murine Ltk- cells) expressing the human beta 3-adrenergic receptor. Sustained agonist-promoted down-regulation of the beta 3-adrenergic receptor could be induced in Ltk- cells, whereas only a transient and weak reduction of receptor number was observed in Chinese hamster fibroblasts. The half-life of the beta 3-adrenergic receptor was not affected by the agonist activation in either cell line, indicating that in contrast to the beta 2-adrenergic receptor, degradation of preexisting receptor protein does not contribute to down-regulation. Sustained reduction of receptor RNA levels, monitored by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, was exclusively shown in Ltk- cells and probably accounted for most of the observed down-regulation. Differences in the ability of the receptor to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity in the two cell lines may be responsible for the distinct patterns of beta 3-adrenergic receptor down-regulation."

https://openalex.org/W1538880476,"The conservation of the carboxyl-terminal domain among small (sm) cytoplasmic and chloroplast heat shock proteins (HSPs) suggests that these smHSPs perform similar functions. Previous studies have established that cytoplasmic smHSPs are found in higher order structures in vivo (approximately 500 kDa). To determine if the chloroplast smHSP is found in similar complexes, we examined the size of the 21-kDa chloroplast smHSP from Pisum sativum, PsHSP21, under non-denaturing conditions. Following sedimentation of chloroplast stromal extracts on sucrose gradients PsHSP21 is detected in fractions corresponding to 10-11 S. Upon non-denaturing gel electrophoresis, PsHSP21 was detected in two high molecular mass complexes of approximately 230 and 200 kDa, in good agreement with the sucrose gradient data. These PsHSP21-containing particles were stable under different salt and Mg2+ conditions, and their integrity was not affected by 1.0% Triton X-100 or 10 mM ATP. To study assembly of the high molecular weight complexes containing PsHSP21, in vitro translated PsHSP21 was imported into chloroplasts and its size was examined. Following import into chloroplasts isolated from heat-stressed plants, greater than 50% of PsHSP21 was recovered in the higher molecular weight forms. In contrast, following import into chloroplasts isolated from control plants the protein was recovered exclusively in a 5 S (approximately 42-kDa) form. These data suggest that preexisting PsHSP21 or other heat-induced factors may be required for assembly of the higher molecular weight particles. We propose that the 10-11 S particles are the functional form of PsHSP21."
https://openalex.org/W1513042472,"Abstract Formation of a transcription-competent open complex between Escherichia coli RNA polymerase and a promoter, where base pairing is disrupted over a region of 12 base pairs including the start site of transcription, is a complex process involving at least three steps: recognition of specific DNA sequences, a conformational change in RNA polymerase, and DNA melting. By using synthetic constructs devoid of promoter-specific sequences, we show here that a mismatch bubble of 12 base pairs suffices to direct transcription initiation in divergent directions from its edges, reflecting the absence of polarity determinants for RNA polymerase binding. Bubble transcription is obtained with both core polymerase and holoenzyme, but efficient formation of heparin-resistant initiation complexes requires the sigma (specificity) factor. Based on these results it is likely that the sigma factor blocks access of the heparin to a site on the holoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1489811008,"The lipid cofactor requirement of hepatic monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT) (EC 2.3.1.22) was studied in Triton X-100/lipid-mixed micelles. Anionic phospholipids and anionic lysophospholipids stimulated MGAT activity, whereas fatty acids and sphingosine inhibited enzyme activity. Phosphatidic acid was a potent activator, stimulating MGAT 11-fold at 4.2 mol %. Kinetic studies revealed that phosphatidic acid, with an apparent Ka of 0.26 mol %, was a better activator than phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, or cardiolipin. Of the anionic lysophospholipids, lysophosphatidic acid was a better activator than lysophosphatidylserine, stimulating maximally at less than 3 mol %. Oleate was a more potent inhibitor (Ki, 2.4 mol %) than sphingosine (Ki, 18.3 mol %). The dependence of MGAT on sn-2-monoacylglycerol was not cooperative in the absence or presence of anionic phospholipids, oleic acid, or sphingosine. The apparent Km for sn-2-monoC18:1-glycerol was 1.24 mol % in the presence of maximally activating phospholipid and 0.19 mol % when phospholipid was omitted. MGAT's product sn-1,2-diacylglycerol was a weaker activator than the anionic phospholipids, but the effects of diacylglycerol and phospholipid were additive. Activation by sn-1,2-diC18:1-glycerol was highly cooperative with a Hill coefficient of 3.6. Activation was specific for the sn-1,2-stereoisomer; neither 1,3-diacylglycerol nor the ether analogs of sn-1,2- or 1,3-diacylglycerol were activators. Since several of the lipid modulators of MGAT activity are intracellular second messengers, these data suggest the possibility that regulatory links exist between signal transduction and the synthesis of complex lipids via the monoacylglycerol pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1572555074,"C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is one of three members of the natriuretic peptide family. In the course of cloning frog CNP precursor cDNA, we found cDNA clones encoding a novel natriuretic peptide precursor. This novel natriuretic peptide precursor is a 118-residue peptide, carrying a 22-residue signal peptide at the N terminus and a 17-residue ring structure characteristic of the natriuretic peptide family at the C terminus. The precursor is highly homologous to mammalian CNP precursors. Its C-terminal Cys codon is directly followed by a termination codon. This feature is characteristic of CNP precursor cDNAs. The cGMP-stimulating activity of the novel natriuretic peptide was at the same level with those of frog CNP and mammalian CNPs, when rat CNP receptor was used in the cGMP assay system. Thus, this novel natriuretic peptide is structurally and functionally a member of the C-type natriuretic peptide. We designated the peptide as frog CNP II, and the previously described CNP as frog CNP I. By Northern blot analysis, expression of this novel CNP mRNA was found in brain, heart, lung, and stomach. On the other hand, frog CNP mRNA was mainly expressed in brain, where mammalian CNP mRNA is exclusively expressed. The distribution of the two frog CNPs suggests a complex system for regulating electrolyte and water balance in frog."

Compared with the structure of the rabbit sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase 1 gene, 12 of the introns are in the same position, 8 introns present in the rabbit gene are absent from A. franciscana, 4 introns present in A. franciscana are not found in rabbit, and the position of 1 intron is shifted one base between both genes. Southern blot analysis strongly suggests that this is the only sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase gene present in A. franciscana. Primer extension and nuclease S1 protection experiments have shown the existence of two main regions of transcription initiation separated by 30 nucleotides. Transcription is initiated in both regions at two or three consecutive bases. A hexanucleotide that includes the initiation sites is repeated in both transcription initiation regions. The nucleotide sequence of the promoter region shows the existence of several putative regulatory sites, including some that are muscle-specific such as one CArG box, 3 MEF-2, and 8 putative binding sites for muscle transcription factors of the MyoD family."
https://openalex.org/W1517078815,"Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) is a three-domain protein in which domain Ia is involved in recognition of receptors on eukaryotic target cells, domain II promotes translocation of PE into the cytosol, and domain III enzymatically ADP-ribosylates elongation factor 2. Modification of proteins with polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been shown to prolong circulating plasma lifetime and may reduce or eliminate immunogenicity. However, in the case of toxins, PEG may interfere with or block toxin activity. To investigate the effect of polyethylene glycolation on specific residues located on the surface of PE domain II, we substituted cysteine, for each of the five most exposed surface amino acids (H276, E282, N306, R313, and E327) in domain II. These cysteines can serve as unique sites for PEG modification. The PE-Cys proteins retained most of their cytotoxicity even when the free sulfhydryl group was blocked by 5,5'-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) or glutathione. When the PE-Cys proteins were conjugated with ovalbumin using a cleavable disulfide linkage, cytotoxicity was retained, but it was lost with a non-cleavable thioether linkage. In contrast, cytotoxicity was maintained when PE-Cys mutants were coupled to 5- or 20-kDa mPEG, using either a disulfide or a thioether linkage. Unexpectedly in some cases, the thioether conjugate was more active than the disulfide linkage. Pharmacokinetic studies on one of the polyethylene-glycolated molecules (R313C) showed that the mean residence time (t 1/2) was prolonged to 72 min, compared to 20 min for unpolyethylene glycolated PE-Cys(R313C). These studies show it is possible to derivatize PE at specific residues in domain II, maintain significant cytotoxic activity, and alter pharmacokinetics. These studies also suggest that large mPEG molecules can be translocated to the cytosol while still attached to domain II of PE."
https://openalex.org/W1570536697,"In this paper we demonstrate that NADPH-initiated oxidative damage of microsomal proteins occurs in the absence of free metal ions and that this protein oxidation is mediated by cytochrome P450 (cyt P450). Oxidized proteins are rapidly degraded by proteases. Ascorbate (AH2) specifically inhibits free metal ion-independent cyt P450-mediated protein oxidation and thereby prevents subsequent proteolytic degradation. Other scavengers of reactive oxygen species including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione are ineffective. This is in variance with free metal ion-catalyzed protein oxidation, which is accelerated by AH2 and inhibited by catalase. Oxidative damage of proteins has been assessed by the production of carbonyl groups, bityrosine formation, and tryptophan loss. The mechanism of protein oxidation has been studied using a reconstituted system comprised of purified NADPH-cyt P450 reductase, cyt P450, and isolated microsomal proteins as well as model polypeptides, e.g. poly-L-proline and poly-L-lysine. Cyt P450 Fe3+ is reduced by NADPH-cyt P450 reductase to cyt P450 Fe2+, which consumes oxygen in a stoichiometric proportion to produce cyt P450 Fe2+ O2, the resonance form of which is a perferryl moiety, cyt P450 Fe3+.O2-.. It is proposed that cyt P450 Fe3+.O2-. abstracts hydrogen from amino acid side chains leading to the production of carbonyl derivatives. Tentatively, AH2 prevents protein oxidation by interacting with cyt P450 Fe3+.O2-.."

We have synthesized human relaxin II and porcine insulin and several A chain loop variants of each and measured the effect of substitutions in vivo and in vitro. Substitution of IleA10 in insulin with glycine reduced the receptor binding ability by 2 orders of magnitude. Conversely, exchange of the glycine A14 residue in relaxin, which corresponds to the insulin position A10 for isoleucine, reduced the bio-activity and the receptor binding capacity of relaxin about 100-fold. Substitution of L-Ala in insulin as well as relaxin represented a compromise that allowed both hormones to recover about 30% of the native potency. X-ray analysis and computer-derived energy calculation confirm our receptor binding and biological potency studies, which suggest that the functional difference between derivatives and native hormones is based upon a structural change introduced into the A chain loop by substitution of the penultimate intrachain loop residue. In order to achieve a conformation that favors dynamic or passive interaction with the receptor, insulin and relaxin require a different A chain loop structure in spite of the striking overall similarity."

We have identified a second gene, NAT2, that may correspond to the N alpha-acetyltransferase acting on a subset of proteins having methionine termini. Crude extracts of a series of heat-sensitive mutants (Ts-) were screened for acetylation of a 24-amino acid synthetic peptide Met-Asn-Asn- in vitro. One mutant, nat2-1, out of 115 strains examined, lacked acetyltransferase activity, and the mutation co-segregated as a single gene with the heat-sensitive phenotype. The nat2-1 mutants were deficient in the ability to acetylate Met-Asn-Asn- and Met-Glu-Arg-peptides but were able to N alpha-acetylate Ser-Glu-Phe- and Ser-Tyr-Ser- peptides in vitro. The NAT2 wild-type gene was cloned by complementation of the nat2-1 mutant, and the DNA sequence revealed an open reading frame of 288 amino acids. Gene disruption demonstrated that NAT2 is an essential gene, and hybridization analysis indicated that it is located on chromosome VII. Furthermore, there was limited, but significant identities between the yeast N alpha-acetyltransferases Nat1, Ard1, Nat2, and Mak3, although no common motifs could be identified. We propose that NAT2 encodes the major N alpha-acetyl-transferase acting on certain proteins with only methionine termini, and that N alpha-acetylation of some of these proteins is essential for viability."

A 5-6-fold increase in HA production was observed using 10(-8) M PTH, and even a 50% increase was detected using 10(-10) M PTH. The PTH-induced stimulation of HA synthesis was rapid and transient, reaching a maximum level (approximately 560 pmol of HA disaccharide equivalents/h/10(6) cells at 10(-8) M PTH) by 4-7 h after hormone exposure and returning to control levels by 12-15 h after the initial treatment.

(1987) Biochemistry 26, 1704-1709). To confirm and define the role of Lys-758 in the catalytic mechanism, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis of this residue. Catalytic activity of the purified mutant enzymes, K758A and K758R, showed severe reduction in the polymerase activity but little difference in the 3‘–>5‘ exonuclease activity. Most interestingly, the catalytic ability of both mutant enzymes was maximally affected (300-1,000-fold decrease in kcat) with poly(dA).(dT)15 as template-primer (TP), whereas the ability to use poly(dC) templates decreased by only 20-fold in K758A and remained nearly unchanged with K758R. Kinetic characterization showed that Km(dNTP) increased moderately only with K758A, whereas Kd(TP) remained unchanged for both the mutants. However, binary complex formation between K758A and dNTP, but not between K758A and TP, was severely reduced. Analysis of the processive mode of DNA synthesis by K758A indicated that the mutant enzyme pauses at dA bases but does not dissociate from TP, suggesting a defect in its translocation ability. Thus, Lys-758 in polymerase I appears to participate in two distinct functions: (a) it facilitates the dNTP binding, and (b) it is required for the translocation along the template polynucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W1532571589,"DNA double strand breaks with noncomplementary ends can be joined by mechanisms of nonhomologous recombination. In some systems a DNA end with a 3'-protruding single strand (PSS), which does not have a recessed 3'-hydroxyl that can allow for fill-in DNA synthesis, is joined to a blunt end with preservation of the 3'-PSS. It has been proposed that this process occurs via single strand ligation or is facilitated by an alignment protein. We were interested in testing the hypothesis that a DNA polymerase could function as this putative alignment protein. To characterize polymerase activities in this type of reaction, we incubated short double-stranded oligonucleotides that had an excess of one of the strands with an exonuclease-free Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli polymerase I, Taq DNA polymerase from Thermus aquaticus, or an exonuclease-free Stoffel fragment of Taq DNA polymerase. Products were analyzed by using biotinylated oligonucleotides separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To further assess the effect of DNA polymerases on the joining of 3'-PSS ends to blunt ends, we incubated linear plasmid DNA with the polymerases and subjected the DNA to Southern blot and sequence analysis. We determined that these DNA polymerases can use a 3'-PSS end as a template after priming off the 3'-hydroxyl of a blunt end. This implies that the joining of noncomplementary ends in eukaryotic cells could proceed by a similar mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1608925896,"Introduction of an epoxide function at the C4 position of the glucose moiety of a truncated glucosylceramide (GlcCer) yields two stereoisomeric products namely a gluco- and a galacto-derivative. The effects of both analogues on the [14C]serine incorporation into glycosphingolipids as well as on lactosylceramide (LacCer) synthase activity of primary cultured neurons derived from the telencephalon of 8-day-old chick embryos were investigated. Whereas the galacto-derivative had no effect either on the pattern of labeled glycosphingolipids or on LacCer synthase activity, pretreatment (24 h) of neurons with the gluco-derivative caused a concentration dependent (IC50 = 8 microM) and irreversible decrease of the specific activity of LacCer synthase. As a consequence the biosynthetic glycosphingolipid pattern of cultured neurons treated with the glucoanalogue changed as follows: the radioactive label of all glycosphingolipids biosynthetically derived from GlcCer was decreased while labeling of GlcCer increased significantly. The inhibitory effect of the gluco-derivative on LacCer synthase activity was much less pronounced in vitro. Thus 250 microM analogue caused only about 30% inhibition of enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1600313983,"Human glycophorins A, B, and E are members of the glycophorin gene family located at chromosome 4, band q31. These genes were apparently generated by two successive gene duplications, and the following evolutionary pathway was proposed based on the genomic sequences. First, the ancestral gene was duplicated, and one of the duplicated genes evolved directly into the GPA gene. Another duplicated gene acquired a 3' sequence from the precursor genomic segment and was then duplicated to yield glycophorin B and E genes (Onda, M., Kudo, S., Rearden, A., Mattei, M.-G. and Fukuda, M. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90, 7220-7224). Although the above hypothesis was proposed, it has been difficult to provide solid evidence for this, because no genomic clones studied encompass two members of the gene family. In this study we isolated several yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones encoding the entire region or a portion of this gene locus. The physical gene mapping was carried out by testing the presence of specific sequences using a polymerase chain reaction. Moreover, the YAC clones were digested by rare cutting restriction enzymes, and the resultant large DNA fragments were separated by pulse-field electrophoresis. Southern blot analyses of those DNA fragments were carried out using various probes encoding specific portions of glycophorin genes. The results obtained revealed that the distance between glycophorin A and B genes is almost the same as that between glycophorin B and E genes. Moreover, it was shown that no precursor genomic sequence was present in the sequences downstream from the GPB or GPE gene, suggesting that the duplication of glycophorin B/E progenitor gene was made through unequal crossing over homologous recombination. These combined results suggest that two duplication events took place tandemly to produce these three members of the glycophorin gene family."
https://openalex.org/W1640002898,"We have studied the expression and regulation of the rat testis cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase gene. The cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase activity was 5-fold lower in the testis than in the liver and kidney. A 1.9-kilobase mRNA form was detected in the rat testis in contrast to the 2.1- and 1.8-kilobase forms present in other organs. Using Northern blot and S1 mapping analyses, we found that the proximal polyadenylation site was almost exclusively used in the testis as opposed to other organs where the distal site was preferentially used. RNase protection and primer extension analysis showed that transcription was initiated at multiple sites in all organs, but the pattern of those start sites was different in the testis; in particular, a novel transcription start site was specifically detected in this organ (at position -115 from the translation start site). This site was first observed in 29-day-old rats and was maximally utilized in the adult testis. DNase I footprinting using testis nuclear extracts revealed the presence of three sites of DNA-protein interaction in the 250-base pair proximal promoter, a pattern similar to the one found using liver nuclear extracts. However, the proteins bound had different properties as shown by gel retardation experiments. We conclude that the pattern of transcription initiation and the polyadenylation site selection of a housekeeping gene can be tissue-specific."

https://openalex.org/W1549551506,"alpha 2A adrenergic receptors are thought to inhibit adenylyl cyclase primarily through Gi alpha 2. We tested the requirement for Gi alpha 2 to inhibit cAMP accumulation by stable expression of alpha 2A adrenergic receptors in mouse embryonic stem cells. Host lines consisted of wild-type CCE cells, and CCE cells with targeted disruption of the Gi alpha 2 gene by two-stage homologous recombination (Mortensen, R. M., Zubiuar, M., Neer, E. J., and Seidman, J. G. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 7036-7040; Mortensen, R. M., Conner, D. A., Chao, S., Geisterfer-Lowrance, A. A., and Seidman, J. G. (1992) Mol. Cell. Biol. 12, 2391-2395). Knockouts were confirmed by Northern blot and immunoblot. We studied three clones derived from wild-type CCE cells (2, 6, and 8) expressing 450 +/- 50, 3000 +/- 120, and 150 +/- 20 fmol of receptor/mg of protein, respectively, and two Gi alpha 2-null clones (7 and 18) expressing 2100 +/- 250 and 300 +/- 40 fmol of receptor/mg of protein. The specific agonist UK14304 caused an inhibition of cAMP accumulation in clones 2, 6 and 8 (58 +/- 16%, 62 +/- 7%, and 52 +/- 12%) and in clones 7 (47 +/- 3%) and 18 (40 +/- 5%), but not in nontransfected CCE cells. IC50 values were similar for all clones (approximately 200 nM). The effect was attenuated by pertussis toxin and the antagonist rauwolscine. These studies show that expression of Gi alpha 2 is not required for alpha 2A adrenergic receptors to inhibit cAMP accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W1583819711,"1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and ethacrynic acid were examined for the ability to inhibit unidirectional efflux routes in L1210 cells that extrude both methotrexate and cholate (system I) and methotrexate alone (system II). These electrophiles were selected for study because of their known ability to undergo rapid intracellular conversion to glutathione conjugates. CDNB produced typical inhibitor kinetics and was a moderate inhibitor of both system I (IC50 = 4.8 microM) and system II (IC50 = 7.5 microM) with methotrexate as the substrate. However, a complex response was observed when cholate was employed as an alternative substrate for system I. Cholate efflux was stimulated initially at low levels of CDNB, but then slowed to a net inhibition as CDNB concentrations exceeded 10 microM. The latter characteristics for CDNB were not observed with ethacrynic acid, which produced a comparable inhibition of efflux system I regardless of the substrate employed (IC50 = 4.6 microM). Efflux measurements in an L1210/C7 variant which lacks system I confirmed that CDNB stimulates the activity of a substantial and unique efflux activity for cholate (system III). The inhibition of system I and II by CDNB and ethacrynic acid was not reversed by a wash step but required inhibitor removal and subsequent incubation at 37 degrees C. This slow reversal was attributed to a time-dependent clearance of inhibitory glutathione conjugates. A correlation between efflux systems for anions and anionic glutathione conjugates was demonstrated further by the ability of prostaglandin A1 and indomethacin, two potent inhibitors of methotrexate and cholate efflux, to inhibit the efflux of 2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione. These results support the hypothesis that efflux systems for methotrexate and cholate in L1210 cells are part of a family of efflux pumps which function in vivo to extrude various anions and anionic glutathione conjugates."
https://openalex.org/W1535648393,"We report the isolation of several overlapping cDNAs from an embryonic library of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus coding for a novel sea urchin collagen chain. The conceptual amino acid translation of the cDNAs indicated that the protein displays the structural features of a vertebrate type IV-like collagen alpha chain. In addition to a putative 31-residue signal peptide, the sea urchin molecule contains a 14-residue amino-terminal non-collagenous segment, a discontinuous 1,477-amino acid triple helical domain, and a 225-residue carboxyl-terminal domain rich in cysteines. The amino- and carboxyl-terminal non-collagenous regions of the echinoid molecule are remarkably similar to the 7 S and carboxyl-terminal non-collagenous (NC1) domains of the alpha 1 and alpha 2 chains of vertebrate type IV collagen. The sequence similarity and distinct structural features of the 7 S and NC1 domains strongly suggest that the sea urchin polypeptide is evolutionarily related to the alpha 2(IV) class of collagen chains. Finally, in situ hybridizations revealed that expression of this collagen gene is restricted to the mesenchyme cell lineage of the developing sea urchin embryo."
https://openalex.org/W1547304356,"A gene has been constructed coding for a chimeric flavocytochrome b5 protein that comprises the soluble domain of rat hepatic cytochrome b5 as the NH2-terminal portion of the chimera and the flavin-containing domain of spinach assimilatory NADH:nitrate reductase as the C terminus. The chimeric protein has been expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity using a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation, affinity chromatography on 5'-ADP-agarose, anion-exchange chromatography, and fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration with an estimated molecular mass of 43 kDa from polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Visible and fluorescence spectroscopy indicated the purified protein contained both a b-type cytochrome and FAD prosthetic groups. The chimeric hemoflavoprotein immunologically cross-reacted with both anti-rat cytochrome b5 and anti-spinach nitrate reductase polyclonal antibodies, indicating the conservation of antigenic determinants from both native domains. NH2-terminal and internal amino acid sequencing of the native and CNBr-digested protein confirmed the presence of peptides derived from both the heme- and flavin-binding portions of the sequence which were identical to the deduced amino acid sequence. The chimera exhibited both NADH: ferricyanide reductase and NADH:cytochrome c reductase activities with Vmax values of 88 and 37 mumol of NADH consumed per min/nmol of heme (mu = 0.05 and pH 7.0) and Km values of 2.1, 32, and 1.4 microM for NADH, ferricyanide, and cytochrome c, respectively. This work represents the first successful bacterial expression of a mammalian-plant chimeric metalloflavoprotein. The chimera exhibited properties extremely similar to those of the native cytochrome b5 heme and spinach nitrate reductase FAD components."
