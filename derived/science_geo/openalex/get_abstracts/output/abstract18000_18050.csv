https://openalex.org/W1558079148,"We report that a purified cytoplasmic Hsp70 homolog from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Hsp70SSA1, exhibits a weak ATPase activity, which is stimulated by a purified eukaryotic dnaJp homolog (YDJ1p). Stable complex formation between Hsp70SSA1 and the permanently unfolded protein carboxymethylated alpha-lactalbumin (CMLA) was assayed by native gel electrophoresis. The affinity of Hsp70SSA1 for CMLA appeared to be regulated by YDJ1p. Significant reduction in both CMLA-Hsp70SSA1 complex formation and the release of CMLA pre-bound to Hsp70SSA1 was observed only in the presence of both YDJ1p and ATP. Thus, Hsp70SSA1 and YDJ1p interact functionally in the execution of Hsp70SSA1 chaperone activities in the eukaryotic cell."
https://openalex.org/W1586051439,"The human MUC2 mucin is a large secretory glycoconjugate that coats the epithelia of the intestines, airways, and other mucus membrane-containing organs. Previous work has shown that this mucin contains an extended tandem repeat-containing domain rich in Thr and Pro. In the present work we describe two additional regions of this mucin located both upstream and downstream of the tandem repeat array. The carboxyl-terminal domain contains 984 residues and can be divided into mucin-like (139 residues) and cysteine-rich (845 residues) subdomains. This latter subdomain exhibits varying degrees of sequence similarity to a wide range of mucins and mucin-like proteins including those isolated from rats, pigs, cows, and frogs. We also report here the sequence of 1270 residues lying immediately upstream of the tandem repeats. This region contains a repetitive, mucin-like subdomain and a second cysteine-rich stretch of more than 700 residues. Both cysteine-rich subdomains of this mucin have sequence similarity with von Willebrand factor, a serum protein that exists as a disulfide-linked polymer. This suggests that these cysteine-rich subdomains are important in the catenation of mucin monomers into oligomers, the structures that confer viscoelasticity upon mucus."
https://openalex.org/W1594381485,"The molecular chaperone BiP/GRP78 associates with various polypeptides in the endoplasmic reticulum, including immunoglobulin chains. We now show, using chemical cross-linking, that another endoplasmic reticulum stress protein, GRP94, associates with newly synthesized immunoglobulin light and heavy chains. We demonstrate the presence of ternary complexes composed of immunoglobulin chains, BiP and GRP94. Because both BiP and GRP94 associate far less with fully assembled immunoglobulin than with unassembled subunits, our data suggest that GRP94, like BiP, functions as a molecular chaperone. The presence of both BiP and GRP94 in the same complex further suggests that the two stress proteins work in concert during the folding and assembly of immunoglobulins."
https://openalex.org/W1627361141,"The 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) binds to the alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (alpha 2MR/LRP) and inhibits binding of ligands to this receptor. The in vivo function of RAP may be to regulate ligand binding and/or assist in the correct biosynthetic processing or trafficking of the alpha 2MR/LRP. Here we show that RAP binds another putative receptor, the kidney glycoprotein 330 (gp330). Gp330 is a high molecular weight glycoprotein that is structurally similar to both the alpha 2MR/LRP and low density lipoprotein receptor. The ability of RAP to bind to gp330 was demonstrated by ligand blotting and solid phase binding assays, which showed that RAP binds to gp330 with high affinity (Kd = 8 nM). Exploiting the interaction of gp330 and RAP, we purified gp330 by affinity chromatography with a column of RAP coupled to Sepharose. Gp330 preparations obtained by this procedure were notably more homogeneous than those obtained by conventional methods. Immunocytochemical staining of human kidney sections localized RAP to the brush-border epithelium of proximal tubules. The fact that gp330 is also primarily expressed by proximal tubule epithelial cells strengthens the likelihood that the interaction between gp330 and RAP occurs in vivo. The functional significance of RAP binding to gp330 may be to antagonize ligand binding as has been demonstrated for the alpha 2MR/LRP or to assist in the biosynthetic processing and/or trafficking of this receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1529632581,"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit the action of prostaglandin H synthase (PGH synthase), and this effect may constitute the basis for therapeutic and idiosyncratic responses to these agents. We found that aspirin treatment of cultured ovine tracheal epithelial cells blocked PGH synthase-catalyzed formation of PG as expected but also caused a dose-dependent increase in 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) production from arachidonic acid. In contrast, aspirin caused only inhibition of PG production without enhancing 15-HETE formation in ovine seminal vesicle and other tissues. The 15-HETE formed by aspirin-treated ovine tracheal epithelial cells was generated by a PGH synthase-dependent mechanism because: (i) the 15-HETE forming activity was just as sensitive as PG forming activity to selective inhibition by indomethacin; (ii) both 15-HETE and PG forming activities were quantitatively immunoprecipitated (depleted from supernatants and recovered in immune complex pellets) by a specific anti-PGH synthase antiserum. Additional immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that anti-PGH synthase monoclonal antibodies (cyo-1 and cyo-5) raised against the aspirin-inhibited form of the enzyme (contained in seminal vesicle) did not recognize the aspirin-stimulated 15-HETE-forming PGH synthase (contained in cultured epithelial cells). Thus, sequential immunoprecipitation of cultured epithelial cell material first with excess cyo-1 followed by anti-PGH synthase antiserum indicated that two isoforms of PGH synthase were expressed in these cells. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of immunoprecipitated PGH synthase from cultured epithelial cells revealed distinct protein bands for each form of the enzyme (M(r) = 70,000 and 72,000). The identification of a distinct PGH synthase which may be modified by aspirin so that selective oxygenation of fatty acid substrate is enhanced (while PG formation is inhibited) indicates that isozymes of PGH synthase exist which are pharmacologically distinct."
https://openalex.org/W1642347096,"In the accompanying paper (Nemoto, Y., Namba, T., Teru-uchi, T., Ushikubi, F., Morii, N., and Narumiya, S. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 20916-20920), we have identified rhoA protein as the sole substrate protein for botulinum C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase (C3 exoenzyme) in human blood platelets. Here we examined the role of rhoA protein in platelet functions. C3 exoenzyme added to washed platelets dose- and time-dependently ADP-ribosylated rhoA protein in situ in the cells. Concomitant with this modification, inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation was observed. This inhibition was not reversed by washing the treated platelets, but was not found when C3 exoenzyme was pretreated with mouse monoclonal anti-C3 exoenzyme antibody. C3 exoenzyme treatment did not affect thrombin-induced inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production. Secretion of preloaded [14C]serotonin was delayed by the enzyme treatment, but the extent of the secretion was not influenced. In addition, the enzyme treatment did not change the expression of the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex on the platelet surface. The enzyme treatment also suppressed platelet aggregation induced by phorbol myristate acetate. These results suggest that rhoA protein plays a role mainly in the aggregation process downstream from receptor-phospholipase C coupling. This, together with the previous finding that rhoA protein modulates stress fiber formation in cultured fibroblasts (Paterson, H. F., Self, A. J., Garrett, M. D., Just, I., Aktories, K., and Hall, A. (1990) J. Cell Biol. 111, 1001-1007), suggests that rhoA protein regulates the assembly of actin filaments and the avidity of the platelet integrin (glycoprotein IIb-IIIa) in the aggregation process."
https://openalex.org/W1843919112,"Rat pancreatic beta cells differ in their individual sensitivity to glucose-inducible metabolic changes. The present study examines whether beta cells with a higher metabolic threshold require higher glucose levels for stimulation of their secretory activity. Purified beta cells were distributed according to their metabolic redox state at 7.5 mM glucose; the metabolically responsive (high responsive) and unresponsive (low responsive) subpopulations of comparable size and viability were reaggregated in the presence of [3H]tyrosine and then perfused at 2.8 mM glucose with 10-min pulses of increasing glucose concentration. Glucose elicited first-phase insulin release in both high and low responsive subpopulations from, respectively, 4.2 and 8.3 mM on. The amplitude of both secretory responses increased dose dependently, the rates in the high responsive subpopulation being 2-fold higher than in the low responsive one. At all stimulating glucose levels, fractional release of 3H-labeled insulin was 3- to 4-fold higher than that of immunoreactive insulin. Preferential release of newly formed insulin was already maximally stimulated at 4.2 mM glucose in the high responsive subpopulation, whereas it increased dose-dependently in the low responsive one. These results indicate the existence of intercellular differences in the secretory activity of glucose-exposed beta cells, both in terms of glucose sensitivity and of amplitude. This heterogeneity in beta cell secretory responsiveness parallels that which has been previously described for the cellular metabolic and biosynthetic functions. It is concluded that glucose dose-dependently recruits beta cells into both biosynthetic and secretory activities. Co-existence of inactive and activated cells can explain preferential release of newly synthesized over preformed hormone during glucose stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1492026024,"Alveolar type II cells produce and secrete a complex mixture of lipids and proteins called pulmonary surfactant of which phospholipids are the major components. Surfactant proteins (SP) A, B, and C interact with phospholipids and are believed to play important roles in alveolar spaces. However, whether surfactant protein D (SP-D) interacts with phospholipids is unknown. In the present study, we examined whether SP-D binds to phospholipids and investigated phospholipid specificities of SP-D binding and the structural requirements of phospholipids for that binding using 125I-SP-D as a probe. 125I-SP-D bound exclusively to phosphatidylinositol (PI) in various phospholipids or a fraction containing phospholipids extracted from surfactant, which were developed on thin layer chromatography. 125I-SP-D also bound to PI coated on microtiter wells in a manner dependent upon the SP-D concentration. Unlabeled SP-D competed well with 125I-SP-D for PI binding and the antibody against SP-D abolished 125I-SP-D binding to PI. PI liposome also attenuated 125I-SP-D binding to the solid phase PI. Ca2+ is absolutely required for the binding of SP-D to PI. SP-D failed to bind to lyso-PI, fatty acids derived from PI digested with phospholipase A2, or diacylglycerol obtained after phospholipase C treatment of PI. SP-D bound to neither phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate nor phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate. We conclude that SP-D specifically binds to PI. This is the first report that demonstrates that SP-D interacts with surfactant phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W67169912,"The fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene is expressed as alternatively spliced mRNAs that encode bacterially expressed kinase, the keratinocyte growth factor receptor, or K-sam. We have now isolated a novel FGFR2 cDNA that is identical with the previously cloned human bacterially expressed kinase, except in the third immunoglobulin-like domain. The ligand binding properties of FGFR2 were studied by expressing the protein in rat L6 muscle myoblasts. Unlike human bacterially expressed kinase which binds acidic and basic FGF with similar affinities, FGFR2 bound acidic FGF with approximately 1000-fold higher affinity than basic FGF. These results indicate that alternative splicing of the FGFR2 gene in the region encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the third immunoglobulin domain determines the ligand specificity of this group of receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1505517574,"Higher plant plastid genomes encode rRNAs, tRNAs, and protein subunits of the RNA polymerase, ribosomes, and the photosynthetic apparatus which vary over 1000-fold in abundance. Quantitative analysis of transcription and RNA levels was carried out on 15 plastid genes which are located in 14 different transcription units covering 50% of the barley plastid genome. Transcription of 16S rRNA, trnfM-trnG, and trnK was high relative to most other plastid genes. Transcription of trnfM-trnG was 5 times greater than trnK indicating that differences in tRNA levels in plastids could be due, in part, to differences in transcription. Among the protein coding genes, mRNA levels varied over 900-fold and transcription over 300-fold. The gene showing the lowest transcription rate and mRNA level, rpoB, is located in a gene cluster which encodes subunits of the plastid RNA polymerase (rpoB-rpoC1-rpoC2). RpoA, which encodes the alpha subunit of the RNA polymerase, was located in a gene cluster encoding ribosomal proteins (rpl23, rps19, rpl16) and infA. RNA from this gene cluster is 30-fold more abundant than rpoB mRNA, suggesting that expression of rpoA is regulated at the level of translation or protein stability. Polycistronic operons encoding subunits of the photosynthetic apparatus (psbB-psbH-petB-petD; psbK-psbI-psbD-psbC; atpB-atpE; psaA-psaB) had higher transcription rates and correspondingly higher mRNA levels than genes which encode ribosomal proteins or RNA polymerase subunits. RbcL and psbA, which are located in separate transcription units, exhibited the highest transcription rates and mRNA levels. Correspondence between transcription rate, mRNA level, and protein abundance indicates that transcription is a primary determinant of barley plastid gene expression. In addition, a 30-fold variation in predicted mRNA stability was observed which further increases the dynamic range of plastid mRNA abundance."
https://openalex.org/W1502628406,"Deoxynucleoside analogs, AZT and/or ddN, are the therapeutic agents currently utilized to inhibit the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase. The effects of their anabolic products, AZT-triphosphate (AZT-TP) and ddCTP on human cellular DNA metabolic processes were studied using highly purified, structurally and enzymatically defined forms of the two major human host DNA polymerases, alpha and beta, and compared to those of the reverse transcriptase purified from HIV viron. Human DNA polymerase alpha during processive DNA synthesis is able to incorporate AZT-monophosphate (AZT-MP) but not ddCMP into DNA, causing chain termination. During its initial encounter with a primer terminus, polymerase alpha is able to incorporate both AZT-MP and ddCMP into DNA chains. Polymerase beta is able to incorporate AZT-MP and ddCMP into DNA, causing chain termination in both modes of DNA synthesis. Steady state kinetic analyses demonstrate that polymerase alpha inserts one AZT-MP molecule into DNA for every 2500 dTMP molecules incorporated. Polymerase beta incorporates ddCMP with efficiency nearly equal to that of dCMP. HIV reverse transcriptase prefers to incorporate AZT-MP and ddCMP rather than dTMP and dCMP, respectively. The findings described here raise the concern that the capability of the two major host DNA polymerases to incorporate AZT-MP or ddCMP into DNA might cause adverse side effects on human DNA metabolism and mutation in the genomes of patients under long term continuous treatment with AZT and ddC."
https://openalex.org/W1568019615,"Chimeric molecules between human lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and rat hepatic lipase (HL) were used to identify structural elements responsible for functional differences. Based on the close sequence homology with pancreatic lipase, both LPL and HL are believed to have a two-domain structure composed of an amino-terminal (NH2-terminal) domain containing the catalytic Ser-His-Asp triad and a smaller carboxyl-terminal (COOH-terminal) domain. Experiments with chimeric lipases containing the HL NH2-terminal domain and the LPL COOH-terminal domain (HL/LPL) or the reverse chimera (LPL/HL) showed that the NH2-terminal domain is responsible for the catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) of these enzymes. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the stimulation of LPL activity by apolipoprotein C-II and the inhibition of activity by 1 M NaCl originate in structural features within the NH2-terminal domain. HL and LPL bind to vascular endothelium, presumably by interaction with cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. However, the two enzymes differ significantly in their heparin affinity. Experiments with the chimeric lipases indicated that heparin binding avidity was primarily associated with the COOH-terminal domain. Specifically, both HL and the LPL/HL chimera were eluted from immobilized heparin by 0.75 M NaCl, whereas 1.1 M NaCl was required to elute LPL and the HL/LPL chimera. Finally, HL is more active than LPL in the hydrolysis of phospholipid substrates. However, the ratio of phospholipase to neutral lipase activity in both chimeric lipases was enhanced by the presence of the heterologous COOH-terminal domain, demonstrating that this domain strongly influences substrate specificity. The NH2-terminal domain thus controls the kinetic parameters of these lipases, whereas the COOH-terminal domain modulates substrate specificity and heparin binding."
https://openalex.org/W1519753723,"The OXBOX promoter regions of the genes for the muscle-specific adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT1) and the beta subunit of the ATPsynthase (ATPsyn beta) have been implicated in the increased transcription of these nuclear-encoded oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes in heart and skeletal muscle. DNA binding, electrophoretic mobility shift (gel-shift) assays now reveal that the OXBOX region has two unique but overlapping elements, the 13-base pair (bp) OXBOX and an 8-bp REBOX. The OXBOX binding factors are found only in myogenic cell lines, whereas the REBOX factors are ubiquitous. Methylation interference experiments have defined the boundaries of the OXBOX and REBOX elements, confirmed that the OXBOX factors are muscle-specific, and shown that the OXBOX and REBOX factors do not bind concurrently. The binding of the REBOX factors was found to be sensitive to NADH and thyroxine, suggesting that it may modulate OXPHOS gene expression in response to environmental and hormonal changes. Hence, the OXBOX/REBOX complex provides one mechanism by which mammalian energy metabolism can be adapted to developmental and environmental demands."
https://openalex.org/W1488606610,"Peptidylprolyl cis,trans-isomerase (PPIase) activity was detected in the cytosol, mitochondria, and chloroplast of pea plants. Cyclosporin A inhibited the activity largely localized to the mitochondrial matrix while rapamycin inhibited the PPIase activity associated with the mitochondrial membranes. Differential inhibition by the two immunosuppressive drugs, the specific binding of these drugs to different mitochondrial fractions, and the immunological detection of a putative 25-kDa rapamycin-binding protein (RBP) in mitochondrial extracts attests to the presence in plant mitochondria of both cyclophilin and RBP classes of PPIases. Cyclosporin A-sensitive PPIase detected in the chloroplast was mostly localized to the thylakoids, which is suggestive of its function in the folding of membranal proteins. PPIase associated with the chloroplast stroma and the thylakoids was not inhibited by rapamycin nor was any cross-reactive RBP detected in chloroplast extracts. These results demonstrate the presence of distinct classes of PPIases in the mitochondria and the chloroplasts of plants."
https://openalex.org/W1607491058,"Seventeen mutations in beta-subunit of Escherichia coli F1-ATPase which had previously been characterized in strain AN1272 (Mu-induced mutant) were expressed in strain JP17 (beta-subunit gene deletion). Six showed unchanged behavior, namely: C137Y; G142D; G146S; G207D; Y297F; and Y354F. Five failed to assemble F1F0 correctly, namely: G149I; G154I; G149I,G154I; G223D; and P403S,G415D. Six assembled F1F0 correctly, but with membrane ATPase lower than in AN1272, namely: K155Q; K155E; E181Q; E192Q; D242N; and D242V. AN1272 was shown to unexpectedly produce a small amount of wild-type beta-subunit; F1-ATPase activities reported previously in AN1272 were referable to hybrid enzymes containing both mutant and wild-type beta-subunits. Purified F1 was obtained from K155Q; K155E; E181Q; E192Q; and D242N mutants in JP17. Vmax ATPase values were lower, and unisite catalysis rate and equilibrium constants were perturbed to greater extent, than in AN1272. However, general patterns of perturbation revealed by difference energy diagrams were similar to those seen previously, and the new data correlated well in linear free energy relationships for reaction steps of unisite catalysis. Correlation between multisite and unisite ATPase activity was seen in the new enzymes. Overall, the data give strong support to previously proposed mechanisms of unisite catalysis, steady-state catalysis, and energy coupling in F1-ATPases (Al-Shawi, M. K., Parsonage, D. and Senior, A. E. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4402-4410). The K155Q, K155E, D242N, and E181Q mutations caused 5000-fold, 4000-fold, 1800-fold, and 700-fold decrease, respectively, in Vmax ATPase, implying possibly direct roles for these residues in catalysis. Experiments with the D242N mutant suggested a role for residue beta D242 in catalytic site Mg2+ binding."
https://openalex.org/W1610595749,"The tetradecapeptide somatostatin (SRIF) is a hormone release-inhibiting substance that mediates diverse effects in brain and peripheral organs via specific receptors. A cDNA encoding a rat SRIF receptor was identified by use of degenerate oligonucleotide primers and polymerase chain reaction amplification of cDNA prepared from transcripts expressed in rat brain. The complete cDNA encodes a protein of 391 amino acids with seven potential transmembrane domains. Expression of the cDNA product in transfected COS-7 cell lines provides the same high affinity of binding to [125I-Tyr11]SRIF-14 as that of rat cerebral cortex tissues. However, the binding of [125I-Tyr11]SRIF-14 to cloned rat SRIF receptor is not displaced by MK678, a SRIF analog that partially displaces [125I-Tyr11]SRIF-14 binding sites in membranes of rat cerebral cortex. Northern analysis and in situ hybridization indicate that mRNA (4.0 kilobases) for cloned rat SRIF receptor is preferentially expressed in rat brain regions such as cerebral cortex and hippocampus with no detectable expression in most peripheral organs. This pattern contrasts with the exclusive peripheral expression of a recently cloned human SRIF receptor. The cDNA probe of rat receptor detects mRNA from mouse brain but not from human cerebral cortex and cerebellum."
https://openalex.org/W1604488369,"Abstract We introduced mutations to test the function of the conserved amino-terminal region of the gamma subunit from the Escherichia coli ATP synthase (F0F1-ATPase). Plasmid-borne mutant genes were expressed in an uncG strain which is deficient for the gamma subunit (gamma Gln-14-->end). Most of the changes, which were between gamma Ile-19 and gamma Lys-33, gamma Asp-83 and gamma Cys-87, or at gamma Asp-165, had little effect on growth by oxidative phosphorylation, membrane ATPase activity, or H+ pumping. Notable exceptions were gamma Met-23-->Arg or Lys mutations. Strains carrying these mutations grew only very slowly by oxidative phosphorylation. Membranes prepared from the strains had substantial levels of ATPase activity, 100% compared with wild type for gamma Arg-23 and 65% for gamma Lys-23, but formed only 32 and 17%, respectively, of the electrochemical gradient of protons. In contrast, other mutant enzymes with similar ATPase activities (including gamma Met-23-->Asp or Glu) formed H+ gradients like the wild type. Membranes from the gamma Arg-23 and gamma Lys-23 mutants were not passively leaky to protons and had functional F0 sectors. These results suggested that substitution by positively charged side chains at position 23 perturbed the energy coupling. The catalytic sites of the mutant enzymes were still regulated by the electrochemical H+ gradient but were inefficiently coupled to H+ translocation in both ATP-dependent H+ pumping and delta mu H+ driven ATP synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1556597983,"Amino acid sequence information was obtained for the NH2 terminus, and for endogenous peptides generated by trypsin digestion, of a purified, truncated form of rat hepatic squalene synthase (RSS, EC 2.5.1.21) (Shechter, I., Klinger, E., Rucker, M. L., Engstrom, R. G., Spirito, J. A., Islam, M. A., Boettcher, B. R., and Weinstein, D. B. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 8628-8635). Degenerate primers, based on the amino acid sequences, were synthesized and used for the amplification and sequencing of a 1708-base pair (bp) cDNA for RSS from the rat hepatoma cell line H35. An open reading frame of 1248 bp encoding 416 amino acids (M(r) = 48,103) was detected for RSS. We have constructed a pRSS1327 expression vector by molecular cloning of a 1327-bp cDNA, which includes sequences of the entire coding region for RSS, into pBluescript. Expression in Escherichia coli of a functional, full-length RSS was confirmed by immunoblot analysis and enzymatic activity. We present and evaluate a model for the secondary structure of RSS and its possible membrane orientation. The model predicts a 315-residue domain at the center of the protein that contains the catalytic site and is released in a soluble form by partial proteolysis. The 33-residue NH2-terminal and 98-residue COOH-terminal sections are not involved in catalysis. Sequence analysis of the catalytic domain of RSS indicate three regions with high homology to sequences in a number of functionally distinct proteins that utilize polyprenyl diphosphate substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1880907558,"Mastoparans are a family of 14-residue peptide toxins from wasp venom which have been proposed to stimulate secretion from a variety of cells, by directly activating GTP-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins). In vitro studies have shown that mastoparans activate G proteins by a mechanism remarkably similar to that used by agonist-bound receptors (Higashijima, T., Uzu, S., Nakajima, T., and Ross, E. M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6491-6494). Here, we report the conformation of mastoparan-X (INWKGIAAMAKKLL-NH2) when it is bound to the alpha subunits of recombinant G(i) and G(o), derived from an analysis of transferred nuclear Overhauser effects in a two-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of mastoparan-X obtained in the presence of these G proteins. Restrained molecular dynamic simulations with NMR-derived distance constraints were used to determine conformations consistent with NMR data. The G(i)- and G(o)-bound conformations of mastoparan-X are very similar, and in both cases, a major part of the molecule adopts an amphiphilic alpha-helical conformation. The lysine residues are known to be crucial for activity, and it is thus likely that at least the polar face of the amphiphilic helix is in contact with the G proteins. These conclusions should be useful in the design of potent and selective analogs of mastoparan and in the development of models for receptor-G protein interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1523740849,"Proteinase-3 (PR-3) is a neutral serine proteinase present in the azurophil granules of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. It degrades a variety of extracellular matrix proteins including elastin in vitro and causes emphysema when administered by tracheal insufflation to hamsters. It is identical to the target autoantigen (c-ANCA) associated with Wegener's granulomatosis and to myeloblastin, a serine proteinase first identified in HL-60 leukemia cells. In this study, the gene encoding PR-3 was cloned and sequenced. The gene spans approximately 6.5 kilobase pairs and consists of five exons and four introns. The genomic organization of PR-3 is similar to that of the other serine proteinases expressed in hemopoietic cells. Each residue of the catalytic triad of PR-3 is located on a separate exon, and the positions of the residues within the exons are similar to those in human leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G. The phase and placement of the introns in the PR-3 gene are also similar to those in human leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G. The 400-base pair (bp) 5‘-flanking sequence of the PR-3 gene contains a TATA box at position 379. There is no CAAT box promoter element. The 3‘-untranslated region is 200 bp, extending from a TGA stop codon to the site of polyadenylation 10 bp after the canonical AATAAA signal. Amplification of PR-3 from a human/hamster hybrid cell line localizes the gene to human chromosome 19. Evidence from Northern analysis suggests that PR-3 expression is primarily confined to the promyelocytic/myelocytic stage of bone marrow development."
https://openalex.org/W1604257804,"The regulation of p34cdc2 kinase activity controls the entry into and exit from mitosis. Although genetic and biochemical evidence suggested close interactions between cyclins, p13suc1 and p34cdc2 kinase, the roles of p13suc1 on p34cdc2 kinase functions remain unclear. To examine the effects of p13suc1 on p34cdc2 kinase function we developed a simple purification procedure for p34cdc2 kinase, unassociated with p13suc1. The key to the purification procedures we used was buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl and 50% ethylene glycol, as a specific elutant of p34cdc2 kinase from p13suc1-Sepharose. This purified p34cdc2 kinase stoichiometrically phosphorylated vimentin and desmin. Exogenous p13suc1 suppressed the phosphorylation of these filament proteins by the kinase and prevented disassembly, although histone H1 phosphorylation was not affected. Peptide mapping analysis showed a similar extent of inhibition by p13suc1 for all five phosphorylation sites by p34cdc2 kinase of vimentin and desmin, hence these p13suc1-induced inhibitions are probably not site-specific. It thus appears that p13suc1 has a selective effect on the catalytic activity of p34cdc2 kinase for these filament proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1486005348,"Expression of antisense RNA against eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E) in HeLa cells causes a reduction in the levels of both eIF-4E and eIF-4 gamma (p220) and a concomitant decrease in the rates of both cell growth and protein synthesis (De Benedetti, A., Joshi-Barve, S., Rinker-Schaffer, C., and Rhoads, R. E. (1991) Mol. Cell Biol. 11, 5435-5445). The synthesis of most proteins in the antisense RNA-expressing cells (AS cells) is decreased, but certain proteins continue to be synthesized. In the present study, we identified many of these as stress-inducible or heat shock proteins (HSPs). By mobilities on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by reactivity with monoclonal antibodies generated against human HSPs, four of these were shown to be HSP 90, HSP 70, HSP 65, and HSP 27. The steady-state levels of HSP 90, 70, and 27 were elevated in relation to total protein in AS cells. Pulse labeling and immunoprecipitation indicated that HSP 90 and HSP 70 were synthesized more rapidly in AS cells than in control cells. The accelerated synthesis of HSPs in the AS cells was not due, however, to increased mRNA levels; the levels of HSP 90 and 70 mRNAs either remained the same or decreased after induction of antisense RNA expression. Actin mRNA, a typical cellular mRNA, was found on high polysomes in control cells but shifted to smaller polysomes in AS cells, as expected from the general decrease in translational initiation caused by eIF-4E and eIF-4 gamma depletion. HSP 90 and 70 mRNAs showed the opposite behavior; they were associated with small polysomes in control cells but shifted to higher polysomes in AS cells. These results demonstrate that HSP mRNAs have little or no requirement in vivo for the cap-recognition machinery and suggest that these mRNAs may utilize an alternative, cap-independent mechanism of translational initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1533966875,"The action of ryanodine upon sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ handling is controversial with evidence for both activation and inhibition of SR Ca2+ release. In this study, the role of the intraluminal SR Ca2+ load was probed as a potential regulator of ryanodine-mediated effects upon SR Ca2+ release. Through dual-wavelength spectroscopy of Ca2+:antipyrylazo III difference absorbance, the intraluminal Ca2+ dependence of ryanodine and Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) from skeletal SR vesicles was examined. Ryanodine addition after initiation of Ca2+ uptake (a) increased the intraluminal Ca2+ sensitivity of CICR and (b) stimulated spontaneous Ca2+ release with a delayed onset. These ryanodine effects were inversely proportional to the intraluminal Ca2+ load. Ryanodine also inhibited subsequent CICR after reaccumulation of Ca2+ released from the initial CICR. These results provide evidence that ryanodine inhibits transitions between low and high affinity Ca2+ binding states of an intraluminal Ca2+ compartment, possibly calsequestrin. Conformational transitions of calsequestrin may be reciprocally coupled to transitions between open and closed states of the Ca2+ release channel."
https://openalex.org/W188536477,"In this study, the effects of Ca(2+)-activated neutral protease (CANP) upon skeletal muscle heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum (HSR) structure and function were investigated. CANP was immunolocalized to the 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid detergent-insoluble fraction of purified HSR membranes. Ca2+ activation of the endogenous membrane-bound CANP produced a characteristic partial fragmentation of the HSR 565-kDa Ca2+ release channel. Similarly, the major substrate for both micromolar and millimolar Ca(2+)-sensitive isoforms of exogenous CANP was the Ca2+ release channel with proteolysis of a 88-kDa HSR protein also observed. Ca2+ release channel proteolysis was initiated at a single cleavage site with coincidental production of 410- and 150-kDa peptide fragments. Appearance of 160- and 137-kDa limiting peptides accompanied secondary proteolysis of the primary 410- and 150-kDa fragments, respectively. Despite extensive proteolysis of the Ca2+ release channel, CANP did not dramatically alter the Ca2+ handling and ryanodine binding properties of HSR membranes. The association of CANP with isolated HSR membranes suggests that, in vivo, this protease may modify an additional property of the Ca2+ release channel. This may be related to the CANP-susceptible structural association of the Ca2+ release channel with dihydropyridine receptors at T-tubule/sarcoplasmic reticulum junctions."
https://openalex.org/W1499160516,"The expression of the beta isoenzyme for protein kinase C is regulated developmentally and in response to inducers of cell differentiation (such as phorbol esters and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3). The 5' segment of the gene for protein kinase C beta was cloned from a human leukocyte genomic library in EMBL3 bacteriophage. This segment of the gene (greater than 54 kilobases in length) encompassed the coding sequence for the amino-terminal regulatory domain of the enzyme, the 5'-untranslated region, and the 5'-flanking region. Initiation of transcription was identified by S1 nuclease analysis and confirmed by RNase protection analysis at 197 base pairs 5' of the initiator ATG. Sequence analysis of the 5'-flanking region revealed it to be extremely G+C-rich (> 80%) with many features of a CpG island. Comparison of sequence with known cis-regulatory motifs disclosed a number of potential regulatory elements including an octamer binding motif at -76, Sp1-binding sites at -94 and -63, E boxes at -110, -26, and +18, an AP-1 site at -442, and an AP-2 site at -330. To demonstrate promoter activity, a 630-base pair fragment extending from -587 to +43 was subcloned in front of a promoterless luciferase gene. This fragment was able to drive the expression of luciferase in transient transfections of human hematopoietic cells. Deletion analysis demonstrated that a fragment -111 to +43 was necessary and sufficient for promoter activity; this fragment did not contain TATA or CAAT motifs. The promoter was stimulated 8-20-fold by phorbol esters accounting for the previously observed transcriptional activation of protein kinase C beta. This phorbol ester responsiveness was conferred by the basal promoter (-111 to +43) and was independent of the AP-1 site. These results define a novel mechanism of protein kinase C autoregulation at a transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W2150134250,"ALCR is the specific activator of the Aspergillus nidulans ethanol-utilization pathway, mediating the induction of its own transcription and that of the structural genes alcA and aldA, encoding respectively, alcohol dehydrogenase I and aldehyde dehydrogenase. ALCR is a DNA binding protein in which 6 cysteines are coordinated in a zinc binuclear cluster. This domain was fused to glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and isolated as a GST-ALCR(7-58*) fusion protein from Escherichia coli. Mobility shift assays showed that the ALCR fusion protein binds at sites upstream of the alcA promoter. DNaseI protection footprinting experiments revealed three specific binding sites, two that are direct repeats and one that is an inverted repeat with the same half-site 5‘-CCGCA-3‘. The half-sites are separated by a variable number of nucleotides in both types of target. The interaction of the ALCR fusion protein with direct and inverted repeats were examined by using interference and protection footprinting assays. In both binding sites, modification of the guanines in the half-sites interfered with the formation of the DNA complex, but the adjacent ones did not. Our results suggest that the ALCR protein makes contact in the major groove of the DNA helix of the half-sites. The functionality of two out of three binding sites of the GST-ALCR protein was demonstrated after their deletion. Therefore, the region encompassing these binding sites is a cis-acting element involved in the full induction of the alcA gene."

The cell-binding specificity of sialic acid-recognizing strains of Streptococcus suis was investigated. Treatment of human erythrocytes with sialidase or mild periodate abolished hemagglutination. Hemagglutination inhibition experiments with sialyl oligosaccharides indicated that the adhesin preferred the sequence NeuNAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4Glc(NAc). Resialylation of desialylated erythrocytes with Gal beta 1-3(4)GlcNAc alpha 2-3-sialyltransferase induced a strong hemagglutination, whereas no or only weak hemagglutination was obtained with cells resialylated with two other sialyltransferases. Binding of radiolabeled bacteria to blots of erythrocyte membrane proteins revealed binding to the poly-N-acetyllactosamine-containing components Band 3, Band 4.5, and polyglycosyl ceramides and to glycophorin A. The involvement of glycophorin A as a major ligand was excluded by the strong hemagglutination of trypsin-treated erythrocytes and En(a-) erythrocytes defective in glycophorin A. Sensitivity of the hemagglutination toward endo-beta-galactosidase treatment of erythrocytes and inhibition by purified poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl glycopeptides indicated that the adhesin bound to glycans containing the following structure: NeuNAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-."
https://openalex.org/W1520835638,"The gamma subunit of the Escherichia coli F1 ATPase (ECF1) has been altered by site-directed mutagenesis to create five different mutants, gamma-S8C, gamma-S81C, gamma-T106C, gamma-S179C, and gamma-V286C, respectively. ECF1 isolated from four of these mutants had ATPase activities similar to that of a wild-type isogenic strain used as a control, the exception was enzyme isolated from mutant gamma-S81C, which had an ATPase activity of around 70-80% of the wild type. ECF1 isolated from each of the various mutants was reacted with N-(4-(7-(diethylamino)-4-methylcoumarin-3-yl))maleimide (CM). The fluorescent reagent was incorporated into Cys residues placed at positions 8, 106, 179, and 286, but not at 81, indicating which of these Cys residues are on the surface of the gamma subunit in the enzyme complex. Modification of the Cys at position 106 with CM activated the enzyme, and modification of the Cys at position 8 inhibited ATPase activity a small amount; however, modification of Cys at 179 or 286 had no effect on enzyme activity. The four mutants with a reactive Cys were reacted with tetrafluorophenylazide maleimides (TFPAMs), novel photoactivatable cross-linkers. In the mutant gamma-S8C, cross-links were formed between the introduced Cys on the gamma subunit and sites on the beta subunit. This cross-linking between gamma and beta depended on nucleotide conditions under which the photolysis was carried out, with differently migrating cross-linked products being obtained in ATP + EDTA compared with ATP + Mg2+ or ATP + Mg2+ Pi. Cross-linking between beta and gamma inhibited ATPase activity in proportion to the yield of cross-linked product. In the mutant gamma-V286C, cross-links were formed between the introduced Cys on gamma and the alpha subunit which were the same in all nucleotide conditions and which led to inhibition of ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1562310675,"The extracellular domain of human tissue factor (TF, amino acids 1-217) was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using the inducible yeast acid phosphatase promoter and the yeast invertase signal sequence to direct its secretion into the culture broth. Two active soluble forms sTF alpha (high molecular weight form) and sTF beta (low molecular weight form) were purified, the yield being approximately 10 and 1 mg/liter of culture supernatant, respectively. sTF alpha had an apparent molecular mass of 150 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and contained more than 200 residues of mannose/mol of protein. sTF beta had an apparent molecular mass of 37 kDa and contained 22 residues of mannose/mol of protein. N-Glycosidase F treatments of both rTFs reduced the apparent molecular mass to 35 kDa. The amino-terminal sequences and amino acid compositions of sTF alpha and sTF beta were consistent with those deduced from the cDNA sequence, thereby indicating that the difference in molecular mass is caused by heterogeneity of oligosaccharide structures. Of these recombinant TFs, sTF beta enhanced factor VIIa-amidolytic activity 40-fold toward the chromogenic substrate and 147-fold toward the fluorogenic substrate, affecting mainly the kcat value. The enhancement was comparable with that of TF purified from human placenta. The TF-mediated enhancement of factor VIIa-amidolytic activity was inhibited by heparin-activated antithrombin III, forming a high molecular weight complex. As treatment of sTF beta with denaturants such as guanidine hydrochloride or urea led to a biphasic loss of the activity, the extracellular domain of TF probably consists of two discrete domains. This expression system provides a significant amount of the extracellular domain of TF so that studies of interactions with factor VII are feasible."
https://openalex.org/W78823815,"Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), a growth hormone (GH)-dependent growth factor exerts feedback regulation of GH by inhibiting GH gene expression. IGF-I inhibition of GH secretion is enhanced 3-5-fold in GC rat pituitary cells overexpressing the wild type 950Tyr human IGF-I receptor which autophosphorylates appropriately. To determine the critical amino acid sequence responsible for IGF-I signaling, insertion, deletion, and site-directed mutants were constructed to substitute for 950Tyr in exon 16 of the human IGF-I receptor beta-subunit transmembrane domain. All mutant transfectants bound IGF-I with a similar Kd to untransfected cells but had markedly increased (7-34-fold) IGF-I-binding sites. GH responsiveness to IGF-I was tested in mutant transfectants. Overexpressed site-directed and insertion mutant IGF-I receptors exhibited a modest suppressive effect on GH in response to the IGF-I ligand, similar to that observed in untransfected cells. Deletion mutant (IG-FIR delta 22) (amino acid 944-965) did not transduce the IGF-I signal to the GH gene. Site-directed and insertion mutants therefore did not enhance the IGF-I response of the endogenous rat receptor, unlike the 950Tyr wild type transfectants which enhanced the IGF-I signal. All mutant transfectants, except the deletion mutant, internalized radioactive ligand similarly to 950Tyr wild type transfectants. 950Tyr of the human IGF-I receptor is therefore required for IGF-I signal transduction in the pituitary somatotroph, but not for IGF-I-mediated internalization."
https://openalex.org/W1540793087,"Three protein products of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene were identified so far. These include the two very similar muscle and brain type dystrophins, which are encoded by 14-kilobase (kb) mRNAs, and Dp71, which is much smaller. Dp71 is encoded by a 6.5-kb mRNA, which is transcribed from approximately 6% of the giant dystrophin gene. The present investigation shows that Dp71 is the first product of the DMD gene detectable during development. It is already expressed in the pluripotent embryonic stem cells. The two 14-kb mRNAs encoding the dystrophins are detectable only after differentiation of specialized cell types. The possible implication of these findings with regard to the ontogenetic activation and the evolution of the DMD gene are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1558969468,"Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) binds to cell surface receptors and to heparin sulfate proteoglycans. Heparan sulfate binding may limit bFGF degradation and be an obligatory step for bFGF cell interaction. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) is a potent regulator of proteoglycan production and composition. The possibility that TGF-beta 1 synergistically regulates bFGF activity by altering bFGF-proteoglycan interactions was investigated. TGF-beta 1 increased 125I-bFGF binding to the extracellular matrix (ECM) of Balb/c3T3 cells 2-4-fold by increasing the number of bFGF binding sites. Increased bFGF binding correlated with a 2-5-fold increase in the production of sulfated proteoglycans, including heparan sulfate proteoglycans. TGF-beta 1 selectively stimulated production of high molecular mass proteoglycans (190-300 kDa) in conditioned medium and stimulated all proteoglycans in ECM. 125I-bFGF bound to TGF-beta 1 induced proteoglycans immobilized onto cationic nylon filters. Furthermore, ECM isolated from TGF-beta 1-treated cells incorporated more mitogenically active bFGF than native ECM. The mitogenic potential of the ECM was significantly reduced by treatment with heparinase. These results suggest that the ability of TGF-beta 1 to stimulate binding of bFGF to ECM, increase ECM heparan sulfate proteoglycan, and potentiate the mitogenic activity of bFGF are linked. Thus one aspect of TGF-beta 1/bFGF synergy may involve modulation of the ECM."
https://openalex.org/W1585976445,"Recognition of the cap structure at the 5' end of mRNA is one of the first events in initiation of eukaryotic translation. This step is mediated by the translation initiation factor 4F (eIF-4F). In mammalian cells this factor is composed of the cap-binding protein eIF-4E, eIF-4A, and a 220-kDa polypeptide. In yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, eIF-4E is found associated with a 150-kDa protein (p150) and a 20-kDa protein (p20). The resulting protein complex is proposed to represent yeast eIF-4F. To study the functions of p150 and p20 and their interaction with eIF-4E, we disrupted the genes encoding p150 and p20 and analyzed the effects on protein complex formation and cell viability. Yeast cells with single and double disruptions of the genes encoding p150 and p20 are viable, but p150 single and p150/p20 double disruptions show a slow growth phenotype. Gel chromatography and immunoadsorption experiments with a monoclonal anti-eIF-4E antibody coupled to protein G-Sepharose show that both p150 and p20 bind independently of each other to eIF-4E."
https://openalex.org/W1565053509,"Many eucaryotic cell surface proteins are anchored to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), of which the core region is highly conserved from protozoa to mammalian cells. Previous studies (Lisanti, M. P., Field, M. C., Caras, I. W., Menon, A. K., and Rodiguez-Boulan, E. (1991) EMBO J. 10, 1969-1977) showed that mannosamine blocked the expression of a recombinant GPI-anchored protein in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and converted this protein to an unpolarized secretory product. In the present study, we examined the effect of mannosamine on the formation of the glycan portion of the GPI anchor precursors. This amino sugar inhibited the incorporation of mannose into the glycan portion, and the inhibition was dose-dependent. Mannosamine was shown to be incorporated into the glycan as mannosamine, probably mostly in the second mannose position and thereby to block the further addition of mannose and other anchor components. The products formed in the presence of this drug were characterized by gel filtration and high resolution TLC both before and after deamination with nitrous acid and dephosphorylation by HF. Galactosamine and trehalosamine were inactive in this system, whereas glucosamine also inhibited mannose incorporation into GPI intermediates."

This single copy gene was located near the centromere of chromosome XIV. It included a coding sequence of 317 amino acids that strictly matched two internal oligopeptides of C34. This polypeptide is a specific component of RNA polymerase III, with no significant homology to any other RNA polymerase subunit known so far. It is an essential subunit, since inactivation by deletion or nonsense mutations led to a recessive lethal phenotype. Moreover, a partially blocked mutant, rpc34-F297, had a reduced tRNA synthesis in vivo but no detectable effect on 5 S RNA synthesis. The latter phenotype was observed for all conditionally defective RNA polymerase III mutants isolated so far."
https://openalex.org/W1491369564,"The interrelationships between activation of phospholipases and neutrophil stimulus-induced Ca2+ responses remain unclear. We report here that immune complexes activate a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase A in a neutrophil only after the cytoplasmic Ca2+ transient has been initiated in the same cell, while chemotactic peptide activation does not proceed via such a phospholipase A-mediated mechanism. Measurements of [Ca2+] changes and of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase A activity were made by flow cytometry, using Indo-1 for Ca2+ indication, and a new fluorescent probe, bis-BODIPY-phosphatidylcholine, localized in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, to measure phospholipase A activation. Both 100 nM formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (with or without cytochalasin B) and 60 micrograms/ml insoluble immune complexes elicited cytoplasmic Ca2+ transients, but only insoluble immune complexes stimulated phospholipase A activation in a subpopulation of cells exhibiting an elevation of [Ca2+]in. Phospholipase A activation followed the Ca2+ transient, starting, in each cell, after [Ca2+]in had begun to decrease as Ca2+ redistributed in the activated cell. The products of this phospholipase activation were confirmed by thin layer chromatography. We conclude that neutrophils respond to immune complexes with an elevated cytoplasmic Ca(2+)-requiring phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase A activation and to chemotactic peptides by a different mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1565405864,"Abstract von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a multimeric plasma glycoprotein that mediates platelet adhesion to the subendothelium via binding to platelet glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) and to components of the vessel wall. Recently, missense mutations that cause type IIB von Willebrand disease (vWD) were described, clustered within a disulfide loop in the A1 domain of vWF that has binding sites for GPIb, collagen, and heparin. In type IIB vWD, plasma vWF exhibits increased affinity for platelet GPIb, but decreased binding to collagen and heparin. The effect was studied of a type IIB vWD mutation, Arg578-->Gln, on the interaction of vWF with GPIb, collagen, and heparin. Recombinant wild type rvWF and mutant rvWF(R578Q) were expressed in COS-7 cells. Ristocetin-induced binding of rvWF(R578Q) to GPIb was markedly increased compared with rvWF, confirming that the Arg578-->Gln mutation causes the characteristic gain-of-function abnormality of type IIB vWD; botrocetin-induced binding was only slightly increased. Binding to collagen type III and heparin-agarose was compared for rvWF(R578Q) and plasma vWF from patients with four different type IIB mutations: Arg543-->Trp, Arg545-->Cys, Val553-->Met, Arg578-->Gln. For all of the plasma samples, binding to collagen and to heparin was reduced compared with normal plasma. In contrast, binding of rvWF(R578Q) to collagen and heparin was normal compared with wild type rvWF. Therefore, the Arg578-->Gln mutation increases the affinity of vWF for GPIb but does not directly impair vWF interaction with collagen or heparin. Arg578 may therefore be necessary to prevent normal vWF from interacting with GPIb. In type IIB vWD, the defective binding of plasma vWF to collagen and heparin may be secondary to post-synthetic modifications that occur in vivo, such as the loss of high molecular weight vWF multimers."
https://openalex.org/W1524376424,"The uptake of transferrin-bound iron by receptor-mediated endocytosis has been the subject of extensive experimental investigation. However, the path followed by iron (Fe) after release from transferrin (Tf) remains obscure. Once Fe is released from Tf within the endosome, it must be transported across the endosomal membrane into the cell. The present investigation describes the presence of a cytoplasmic Tf-free Fe pool which is detectable only when cells are detached from their culture dishes at low temperature, after initial incorporation of diferric transferrin at 37 degrees C. This cellular iron pool was greatly reduced if incubation temperatures were maintained at 37 degrees C or if cells were treated with pronase. Human melanoma cells (SK-MEL-28) in culture were prelabeled by incubation with human 125I-59Fe-transferrin for 2 h, washed, and reincubated at 4 degrees C or 37 degrees C in balanced salt solution in the presence or absence of pronase. The cells were then mechanically detached from the plates and separated into and supernatant fractions by centrifugation. Approximately 90% of cellular 59Fe and 20% of 125I-Tf remained internalized when this reincubation procedure was carried out in balanced salt solution at 37 degrees C. However, at 4 degrees C, cellular internalized iron was reduced to approximately 50% of the initial value. The release of this component of cellular 59Fe (approximately 40% of total cell 59Fe) at 4 degrees C was completely inhibited in the presence of pronase and other general proteinases at 4 degrees C and at 37 degrees C, without affecting internalized transferrin levels. Similar results were obtained in fibroblasts and hepatoma cells, indicating that this phenomenon is not unique to melanoma cells. The characterization of this Tf-free cellular Fe pool which is detectable at low temperature may yield valuable insights into the metabolic fate of iron following its transport across the membrane of the endocytotic vesicle."
https://openalex.org/W1510850993,"We have measured the intracellular rates of formation of the six disulfide bonds in the human chorionic gonadotropin beta subunit (hCG-beta) to determine whether the folding pathway of this molecule can be described by a simple sequential model. If such a model is correct, the formation of disulfide bonds, which is indicative of tertiary structural changes during protein folding, should occur in a discrete order. The individual rates of disulfide bridging were determined by identifying the extent of disulfide bond formation in hCG-beta intermediates purified from choriocarcinoma cells that had been metabolically labeled for 40 to 120 s and chased for 0 to 25 min. The results of these kinetic studies describe a folding pathway in which the disulfide bonds between cysteines 34-88, 38-57, 9-90 and 23-72 stabilize, in a discrete order, the putative domain(s) involving amino acids 1-90 of hCG-beta. However, the S-S bonds 93-100 and 26-110 begin to form before the complete formation of the disulfide bonds that stabilize the amino acid 1-90 domain(s), and continue to form after complete formation of these disulfide bonds, suggesting that hCG-beta does not fold by a simple sequential pathway. The order of completion of each of the six disulfide bonds of hCG-beta is: 34-88 (t1/2 = 1-2 min), 38-57 (t1/2 = 2-3 min), 9-90 and 23-72, 93-100, and 26-110. Moreover, 60-100% of each of the six disulfide bonds form posttranslationally, and nonnative disulfide bonds do not form in detectable amounts during intracellular folding of hCG-beta."
https://openalex.org/W116055455,"The Ca2+ requirement for lipid hydrolysis catalyzed by phospholipase A2 from Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus (App-D49) and porcine pancreas has been examined using small, unilamellar vesicles of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC SUV). Hydrolysis was affected by product inhibition even at early times, and the extent of this inhibition depended on the concentration of divalent cations. The Ca2+ requirement for half-maximal rates of hydrolysis reflected, in part, this non-catalytic role of divalent cations. The presence of 10 mM Mg2+, a cation which does not support catalysis, reduced the Ca2+ required for half-maximal rates of hydrolysis from millimolar concentrations to 40 microM for App-D49. Since the dissociation constant of the enzyme for Ca2+ in solution is 2 mM, these results indicate a change in the interaction of the enzyme with Ca2+ under catalytic conditions. The kinetic dissociation constant of Ca2+ for the pancreatic enzyme was 20 microM which is substantially lower than the dissociation constant in solution, 0.35 mM. The similarity of apparent kinetic dissociation constants for these enzymes suggests that structurally similar features determine the affinity for Ca2+ under catalytic conditions. Evidence is presented that the affinity of phospholipase A2 for Ca2+ changes subsequent to the initial interaction of the enzyme with the substrate interface. However, the apparent Michaelis constant, KMapp, for App-D49, 0.03-0.06 mM, is independent of [Ca2+] and is about the same as the equilibrium dissociation constant for DPPC SUV, 0.14 mM. We thus suggest that KMapp is a steady-state constant."
https://openalex.org/W1561498859,"The high affinity branched-chain amino acid transport system (LIV-I) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is composed of five components: BraC, a periplasmic binding protein for branched-chain amino acids; BraD and BraE, integral membrane proteins; BraF and BraG, putative nucleotide-binding proteins. By using a T7 RNA polymerase/promoter system we overproduced the BraD, BraE, BraF, and BraG proteins in Escherichia coli. The proteins were found to form a complex in the E. coli membrane and solubilized from the membrane with octyl glucoside. The LIV-I transport system was reconstituted into proteoliposomes from solubilized proteins by a detergent dilution procedure. In this reconstituted system, leucine transport was completely dependent on the presence of all five Bra components and on ATP loaded internally to the proteoliposomes. Alanine and threonine in addition to branched-chain amino acids were transported by the proteoliposomes, reflecting the substrate specificity of the BraC protein. GTP replaced ATP well as an energy source, and CTP and UTP also replaced ATP partially. Consumption of loaded ATP and concomitant production of orthophosphate were observed only when BraC and leucine, a substrate for LIV-I, were added together to the proteoliposomes, indicating that the LIV-I transport system has an ATPase activity coupled to translocation of branched-chain amino acids across the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1586880294,"The sulfhydryl-selective alkylating agent, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), has been used as a tool to discern whether different binding domains exist on the neuronal serotonin (5-HT) transporter for 5-HT and 5-HT uptake inhibitors (Reith, M. E. A., Allen, D. L., Sershen, H., and Lajtha, A. (1984) J. Neurochem. 43, 249-255; Graham, D., Esnaud, H., Habert, E., and Langer, S. Z. (1989) Biochem. Pharmacol. 38, 3819-3826). However, relatively high concentrations of NEM and long incubation times have been required for inactivation of the transporter-binding site which raises the possibility that NEM is reacting with other nucleophilic groups (Smyth, D. G., Blumenfeld, O. O., and Konigsberg, W. (1964) Biochem. J. 91, 589-595). In the present work, the reactivity and essential nature of sulfhydryl groups associated with substrate/inhibitor binding to the neuronal 5-HT transporter was assessed. [3H]Paroxetine, a potent and selective 5-HT uptake inhibitor, was used to label the 5-HT transporter. The effects of a relatively wide range of sulfhydryl reagents on [3H]paroxetine binding in digitoninsolubilized preparations of rat brain neuronal membranes and the relative abilities of different classes of drugs to protect against NEM-induced inactivation of [3H]paroxetine binding were studied. It was observed that digitonin-solubilized preparations were more sensitive than membrane preparations to the inactivating effects of NEM. The pKa of the reactive group was estimated to be 6.17, in the range expected for a reactive sulfhydryl. Sulfhydryls essential to ligand binding reacted preferentially with hydrophobic compounds (p-hydroxymercuribenzoate = dithiobisnitrobenzoate > methyl methanethiosulfonate > N-phenylmaleimide > N-ethylmaleimide) and were unreactive toward hydrophilic reagents such as iodoacetate and iodoacetamide. 5-HT, 5-HT uptake inhibitors and cocaine protected the digitonin-solubilized transporter from NEM-induced inactivation while the amphetamine-related releasing agents p-chloroamphetamine and fenfluramine were ineffective. The observation that the binding of some, but not all, ligands requires reduced sulfhydryl groups, suggests that differential mechanisms and/or different binding domains do exist for agents which interact at the neuronal 5-HT transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1486172246,"The actin-activated Mg(2+)-ATPase activity of filamentous Acanthamoeba myosin II is inhibited by phosphorylation of 3 serine residues at the tip of the tail of each heavy chain. From previous studies, it had been concluded that the activity of each molecule in the filament was regulated by the global state of phosphorylation of the filament and was independent of its own phosphorylation state. The actin-activated Mg(2+)-ATPase activity of monomeric phosphorylated myosin II was not known because it polymerizes under the ionic conditions necessary for the expression of this activity. We have now found conditions to maintain myosin II monomeric and active during the enzyme assay. The actin-activated Mg(2+)-ATPase activities of monomeric dephosphorylated and phosphorylated myosin II were found to be the same as the activity of filamentous dephosphorylated myosin II. These results support the conclusion that phosphorylation regulates filamentous myosin II by affecting filament conformation. Consistent with their equivalent enzymatic activities, monomeric and filamentous dephosphorylated myosin II were equally active in an in vitro motility assay in which myosin adsorbed to a surface drives the movement of F-actin. In contrast to their very different enzymatic activities, however, filamentous and monomeric phosphorylated myosin II had similar activities in the in vitro motility assay; both were much less active than monomeric and filamentous dephosphorylated myosin II. One interpretation of these results is that the rate-limiting steps in the two assays are different and that, while the rate-limiting step for actin-activated Mg(2+)-ATPase activity is regulated only at the level of the filament, the rate-limiting step for motility can also be regulated at the level of the monomer."
https://openalex.org/W1513834686,"Abstract Cyclosporin A (CsA) inhibits T-cell proliferation primarily by blocking the transcription of several early activation genes, especially those of the important T-cell growth factors IL-2 and IL-4. This effect seems to be mediated through inhibition of the activity of the transcription factor NF-AT which is essential for IL-2 and probably for IL-4 gene transcription. However, once T cells are rendered competent to proliferate following a brief exposure to the phorbol ester, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), and the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, CsA no longer inhibits cell cycle supported by the presence of PDBu alone. Here it is shown that transcription of the IL-2 and IL-4 genes occurs normally throughout this progression phase, even in the presence of CsA. However, further production of functional NF-AT, which began during the competence phase of the cell cycle, is inhibited. These data indicate that, although the primary initiation of transcription of IL-2 and IL-4 mRNA during induction of competence may be NF-AT-dependent and CsA-sensitive, the augmentation in the phase is both NF-AT-independent and CsA-resistant."
https://openalex.org/W1505616617,"The effect of the central non-Pur.Pyr sequences in oligo(dG.dC) inserts on determining the type of intramolecular DNA triplex isomers formed in negatively supercoiled plasmids was investigated. Different triplex types (H-r3, H-r5, and H-y3), revealed by a combination of chemical probing and Maxam-Gilbert sequencing reactions, were adopted by the oligo(dG.dC) tracts depending on the length and composition of the central non-Pur.Pyr sequences (0, 3, or 5 base pairs) and the kind of metal ions. The H-r3 triplex conformer, one isomer of a Pur.Pur.Pyr structure, was formed in the (C)20 and (C)10GCG(C)10 inserts in plasmids in the presence of certain metal ions. Interestingly, H-r5, the other isomer of the Pur.Pur-Pyr triplex which had not been detected previously, was formed in a (C)9GAATT(C)9 insert in the presence of either Mg2+ or Ca2+. Alternatively, H-y3, one isomer of a Pyr.Pur.Pyr triplex, was formed in the (C)9GAATT(C)9 insert in the absence of metal ions. Thus, central non-Pur.Pyr sequences and metal ions play a role as determinants of the types of intramolecular triplexes formed; they also reduce the requirement of longer Pur.Pyr repeat sequences to form intramolecular triplexes. Furthermore, the effects of MgCl2 concentration and pH on the formation of triplex isomers were examined. The Pur.Pur.Pyr conformations (H-r3 and H-r5) may be the favored conformations in the cellular milieu, since they are stable at physiological pH and metal ion concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1517985017,"An early event in the action of brefeldin A (BFA) is the dissociation of beta-coat protein (beta-COP) from the Golgi membrane. We have recently shown that staphylococcal ADP-ribosyltransferase (epidermal cell differentiation inhibitor (EDIN)), which specifically modifies a small G protein, rho, mimics the action of BFA and disassembles the Golgi apparatus in Vero cells (Sugai, M., Chen, C-h., and Wu, H. C. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 8903-8907). Three independent BFA-resistant cell lines (BER-40 from Vero cells, PtK1, and MDCK) showed cross-resistance to EDIN regarding the release of the beta-COP from the Golgi membrane by EDIN or BFA. BFA as well as EDIN induced disassembly of the actin microfilaments in Vero cells, and they both failed to induce the disassembly of actin microfilaments in BER-40, PtK1, and MDCK cells. BFA inhibited protein secretion in Vero cells but not in BFA-resistant cell lines, whereas EDIN did not inhibit protein secretion in either Vero or other cell lines. AlF-4 inhibited the effect of EDIN as well as that of BFA on the distribution of the beta-COP. These results suggest that an EDIN-sensitive rho protein together with trimeric and other small G protein(s) is involved in the regulation of the assembly of coated vesicles and vesicular transport in the Golgi apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1531904571,"The interactions of nuclear proteins from embryonal carcinoma cells (PCC3) with the long terminal repeats (LTRs) of murine intracisternal A particle (IAP) genes were studied. Two protein-DNA complexes were detected between PCC3 nuclear extract and IAP LTRs in a gel mobility shift assay. An additional complex was observed when enriched fractions from a heparin-agarose column were used as the source of proteins. Two regions within the LTR of IAP 81 were identified as the sites of protein interaction by DNase I protection. One region encompasses 43 nucleotides within the U3 region at the 5' end of LTR 81. The other covers a 78 base pair region lying within 100 nucleotides upstream from the transcription initiation site. Studies using constructs containing intact or deleted versions of the LTR fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene indicated that the absence of the 5' 47 base pairs reduced the level of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase transcription to 20% of that driven by the entire LTR. Southwestern analysis of PCC3 nuclear extracts and column fractions revealed that a 28,000- and a 46,000-dalton protein were the major species that interact with the 5' end of IAP LTR 81."
https://openalex.org/W1543944054,"The NH2- and COOH-terminal regions of the regulatory light chain (LC2) have been mapped to the head/rod junction by immunoelectron microscopy, using monoclonal and anti-fluorescyl antibodies as probes. In order to map the entire length of the light chain, we have engineered and purified mutants that contain a single cysteine residue at positions 2, 73, 94, 126, or 155. The single cysteine residues were labeled with either 5-iodoacetamido fluorescein or N-ethylmaleimide-biotin. We observed that the reactivity of Cys126 is far greater than that of Cys155, confirming that cysteine 126 is the fast-reacting thiol in wild-type light chain. The labeled light chains were exchanged into myosin stripped of its native LC2 by immunoaffinity chromatography, and the reconstituted myosin was reacted with anti-fluorescein antibody or avidin prior to rotary shadowing for electron microscopy. The position of the antibody or avidin was found to be near the head/rod junction for all mutants. These mapping studies, together with our finding that cysteines widely separated in the primary sequence can form multiple disulfide bonds (Saraswat, L.D., and Lowey, S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 226, 19777-19785), support a model for LC2 as a flexible, globular molecule localized mainly in the vicinity of the head/rod junction of myosin."
https://openalex.org/W1558726423,"In the gal-his3 hybrid promoter, his3-GG1, GCN4 stimulates transcription at the position normally occupied by a TATA element. This expression requires two elements within gal1-10 sequences, a REB1-binding site and a second element, Z, which resides 20 base pairs upstream of the GCN4-binding site. No obvious TATA element is present in this promoter. To characterize the function of Z, we replaced it with short random oligonucleotides and selected for expression in vivo. Fourteen elements were identified and classified into groups based upon sequence and phenotypic similarities. Group 1 elements contained functional TATA sequences that were essential for activity. TATA elements can thus function when positioned upstream of a GCN4-binding site. The Group 2 elements activated transcription poorly when used as conventional TATA elements; however, mutational analyses demonstrated that their activity required TATA-like sequences. These TATA-like sequences bound the yeast TATA-binding protein (TBP) poorly in vitro but function in vivo as TBP interaction sites based upon two criteria. First mutations that improved their TATA character correspondingly improved function and second their activity could be enhanced in the presence of an altered binding specificity mutant of TBP. Furthermore, the Group 2 elements enabled the identification of mutations outside of the TATA-like core that contribute to transcriptional activation without adversely affecting TBP binding. The finding that low affinity TBP-binding sites can be used at unconventional positions suggests that many TATA-less promoters contain a cryptic interaction site for TBP."
