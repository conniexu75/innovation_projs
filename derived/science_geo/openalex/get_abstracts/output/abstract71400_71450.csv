https://openalex.org/W1499193548,"Abstract The molecular weight of approximately 1,500-fold purified arginase from rat liver (specific activity = 19,500 µmoles of urea per min at 25° per mg of protein nitrogen) was determined by the method of sedimentation equilibrium to be 118,000. The sedimentation velocity constant is 6.1 S, the diffusion coefficient 5.2 x 10-7 cm2 per sec. Alteration in pH, removal of Mn2+, and replacement of Mn2+ by Co2+ did not yield evidence of a change in molecular size. The partial specific volume (V) was determined by a differential sedimentation equilibrium technique in heavy water. Dissociation of the enzyme in 8 m urea yielded a protein which sedimented in a single boundary and gave one protein band after acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis of the dissociation compound gave a molecular weight of 30,800, which suggests that rat liver arginase is composed of four subunits. Amino acid analysis has been carried out and the values compared to those of arginases from other species."
https://openalex.org/W1505146170,"Rat liver acid phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.2) was separated into two highly purified fractions, differing in isoelectric point and Km. One fraction was crystallized and proved homogeneous by ultracentrifugation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weights (100,000), substrate specificities, and pH optima of both enzymes were similar. Oxalate was a mixed type inhibitor to both enzymes. In the presence of dioxane, both enzymes exhibited sigmoidal inhibition curves by oxalate and by trypan blue."

During G1 phase (3 hours after mitosis), midway through S phase (7 hours after mitosis) and again in late S phase (10 hours after mitosis), rapid increases in activity were observed and correlated with a net increase in cell size and total protein. The evidence suggests that this is a general phenomenon which affects a whole population of proteins and may be the expression of an endogenous cellular rhythm."
https://openalex.org/W1555941809,"Abstract Porcine pancreatic RNase was isolated from the pancreatic secretion of animals with permanent fistulas by a combination of DEAE-cellulose chromatography, adsorption-elution from sulfoethyl-Sephadex, and gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. On the basis of these experiments, a practicable, large scale procedure was developed for the preparation of the enzyme in quantities of 100 to 200 mg. Porcine RNase exhibits a pronounced heterogeneity, detectable by chromatography on sulfoethyl-Sephadex C-50 and by acrylamide gel electrophoresis. At least eight major electrophoretically distinguishable components occur, and there is evidence that these themselves may be mixtures. The heterogeneity is conferred by polysaccharide associated with the enzyme. This polysaccharide is composed of fucose, mannose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, and N-glycolylneuraminic acid. Fractions of varying carbohydrate composition and content were obtained by chromatography on sulfoethyl-Sephadex C-50. These fractions as well as the unfractionated enzyme all had identical amino acid compositions. The amino acid analyses showed that the protein moiety in porcine RNase contains 125 residues (mol wt, approximately 14,040) in a distribution that reveals 27 differences with the bovine enzyme. The two fractions of the porcine enzyme that differed most in carbohydrate content were subjected to analytical ultracentrifugation and viscometry. The measured molecular weights (22,300 and 17,200) agreed well with the results of constituent analysis. The hydrodynamic measurements revealed the molecule to be notably asymmetric. The extent of glycosidation does not significantly influence the activity of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1537845492,"Abstract The aim of the present work was to devise a reasonably detailed transport model and derive an equation from it which would describe the effects on unidirectional glycine transport of the substrates, Na+ and glycine, simultaneously present on both sides of the membrane. The model is a transition model rather than a static site model, and is passive in that energy for glycine-active transport comes solely from the Na+ gradient. Glycine entry and exit kinetics, including Na+ dependence, were compared; unidirectional glycine influx kinetics under steady state and equilibrium conditions were compared; inhibition of glycine exit by various external Na+ concentrations in the absence of external glycine was determined; the relief of this inhibition by external glycine was measured. With most of the measurements, six of seven indispensable parameters of the equation were evaluated as functions of the seventh. Expected values for the three remaining measurements could be calculated from the equation with the six evaluated parameters since kinetic behavior is insensitive to the seventh parameter, although individual rate and equilibrium constants strongly depend on it. Agreement between predicted and measured values was fair to good. In addition to the general fit of experiments to the model, several special properties were found. The system is asymmetrical in that glycine exit and entry kinetics are not mirror images. The asymmetry does not arise from the active character of glycine transport. Formation of a complex containing more than one Na+ must occur. Membrane-crossing rate constants for empty, Na+-loaded, and Na+ plus glycine-loaded mechanism are different. That for the fully Na+-loaded form (ENa2) is very much smaller than the other two, if not zero. Transport kinetics for hemolyzed and restored cells are very similar to those for intact cells."

https://openalex.org/W1563411342,"Abstract Limited tryptic attack of phosphorylase a to produce phosphorylase b' is stimulated in the presence of the dissociating agents, glucose and hydrolyzed amylose. Phosphorylase b', a dimer, has been shown to exhibit no tendency to associate into a tetramer under conditions in which phosphorylase b, also a dimer, readily associates. The catalytic properties of phosphorylase b' have been investigated and found to differ strikingly from those of phosphorylase b. The apparent Michaelis constants of phosphorylase b' for substrates and activator were essentially independent of the concentrations of glycogen, inorganic phosphate, and AMP. No activation could be detected with NaF, and little or no inhibition was found with glucose 6-phosphate. The results suggest that the region of the primary structure released by trypsin, which contains the seryl residue phosphorylated in the phosphorylase b to a reaction, is involved in some way in dimer-dimer binding of phosphorylase a, and that this region is an essential part of the molecular structure which is responsible for the regulatory behavior of glycogen phosphorylase."

The 5-hour digestion mixture had encephalitogenic activity, although no trace of the substrate could be detected by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel. The active fragment was isolated from the enzymatic mixture by repeated gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 and by chromatography on carboxymethyl cellulose. It was homogeneous by the criteria of ultracentrifugation, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and end group analyses. Characterization of the active fragment was carried out in comparison with the encephalitogenic protein. This included determination of the amino acid composition, minimum molecular weight, sedimentation, peptide mapping, and amino- and carboxyl-terminal group analyses. It was concluded that the active fragment is a polypeptide with approximately half the molecular size of encephalitogenic protein, derived entirely from the carboxyl terminus of the encephalitogen. It was active at the same level as the parent compound."
https://openalex.org/W1595149159,"Abstract The apparent binding affinity between progesterone and α1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) is increased manifoldly by neutral salts, such as Na2SO4, (NH4)2SO4, or NaCl, which generally stabilize the conformational structure of globular proteins; other perturbants which are known to destabilize globular proteins, e.g. LiBr, CaCl2, or urea, decrease the apparent stability of the complex. The intrinsic viscosity of AAG in 3 m CaCl2 and in 4 m NaCl is greater and smaller, respectively, than in water; this is in agreement with the assumption of a conformational change toward a random coil and a more compact structure, respectively, in the two salt solutions. The order of efficiency of the perturbants in increasing or decreasing the apparent progesterone-AAG affinity is similar to the Hofmeister series. The affinity-increasing NaCl enhances the apparent association constant of the progesterone-AAG complex and does not affect the number of binding sites; the affinity-decreasing LiBr reduces both the apparent association constant and the average number of binding sites. Similar enhancement of the apparent binding affinity by 4 m NaCl was also observed for the AAG complexes of testosterone, cortexone (deoxycorticosterone), corticosterone, cortisol, estrone, and estradiol. Thermodynamic data indicate that the interaction of AAG with the Δ4-3-ketosteroids is associated with a negative free energy change, composed of a negative enthalpy change and a positive entropy change. The progesterone-binding affinity is independent of the presence of sialic acid in the AAG molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1584178598,"Abstract The omission of K+ from the buffer used for isolation and incubation of rat brown fat cells blocked the large increases in respiration seen after the addition of lipolytic agents. The effect of K+ was on the activation of respiration by free fatty acids rather than upon the lipolytic action of agents such as theophylline. Rb+ and Cs+, but not NH4+, could partially substitute for K+ in the activation of respiration by theophylline. Valinomycin, an antibiotic which activates the uptake of K+ by isolated mitochondria, markedly stimulated respiration in brown fat cells in the presence but not in the absence of K+. Nigericin, another antibiotic which blocks K+ uptake by mitochondria, also blocked the increase in respiration due to valinomycin and theophylline. The effects of lipolytic agents on respiration could be mimicked by addition of albumin-bound free fatty acids to brown fat cells, an effect which was also K+-dependent. The omission of Ca++ and Mg++ reduced the activation of respiration by fatty acids or lipolytic agents. These findings indicate that the activation of energy metabolism by fatty acids involves a K+-dependent process which is influenced by divalent cations. The increased oxygen consumption may be secondary to utilization of high energy intermediates of oxidative phosphorylation for increased K+ flux across membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1570167459,"Abstract 5α-Cholestan-3β-ol-4-14C (0.2 to 0.4 mg, 107 dpm) was administered intraperitoneally to rats made hyperthyroid by daily subcutaneous injections of l-thyroxine (250 µg per kg per day) for a period of 4 weeks prior to cannulation of the bile ducts. The bile secreted over 17 postoperative days contained 72% of the administered 14C. Bile from the first 2 days was hydrolyzed, and the free bile acids were separated by acetic acid partition chromatography. Of the chromatographed 14C, 38% was associated with dihydroxy acids, 48% with cholic acid, and 9% with more polar fractions. The metabolite in the first zone was separated from known acids by repeated chromatography of the methyl esters and identified by dilution with synthetic allochenodeoxycholic acid. The synthetic material was prepared from methyl chenodeoxycholate by conversion to methyl 3-keto-7α-hydroxy-5α-cholanoate with Raney nickel, followed by catalytic reduction, and its structure was supported by mass spectral studies of the acid and its derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W2057969509,"When striated muscle from mice poisoned with purified tetanus neurotoxin was incubated with tetanus antitoxin labeled with horseradish peroxidase and stained for peroxidase activity, an electron-opaque reaction product was found in the transverse and terminal sacs of the longitudinal elements of the sarcotubular system. Demonstration of toxin in this location suggests that it acts by interfering with contraction coupling or mechanisms of contraction-relaxation."
https://openalex.org/W1982432192,"Nerve growth factor has been isolated from submaxillary glands of mnature male mice at specific activities about a million times, and in yields of biological activity ten million times, greater than best previous results. The major improvement in the isolation is related to the separation of a highly active tosylarginine methyl esterase present in cruder preparations. The new nerve growth factor may be an entity different from the older one, although no gross differences in the qualitative aspects of their actions are apparent on superficial examination of chick ganglia influenced by them. The neurites which develop from a ganglion in the presence of nerve growth factor are of nearly equal length. The amount of nerve growth factor determines the number of neurites but not the extent of individual development. The amount of the new nerve growth factor which evokes the appearance of a hundred neurites from a single ganglion appears to be about ten molecules. Since each neurite seems to arise from a different neuron each molecule of nerve growth factor must affect several cells. This result can be rationalized by a catalytic mechanism or by indirect action of nerve growth factor through a hypothetical cell which produces a neurite evocator on contact with the molecule of nerve growth factor."

https://openalex.org/W2010187081,"A new method of calculating molecular crystal structures is proposed and tested. The repulsive portion of the nonbonded potential energy is fitted by a quadratic equation to yield a sum-of-squares description of the repulsive lattice energy. Minimization of this sum by full-matrix least squares yields good fits to the observed crystal structures of several hydrocarbons. The convergence properties of the method are markedly superior to those of the steepest-descent method, and calculation times are greatly decreased."
https://openalex.org/W2086932893,"I PROPOSED earlier1,2 that mild fear facilitates exploratory behaviour whereas strong fear inhibits it. If an animal is placed in a maze, with time it becomes habituated to the fear aroused by the maze stimuli. It is therefore to be expected that, at first, strong fear will inhibit the exploratory behaviour of rats, but with time the fear should become milder and exploratory behaviour will be facilitated. Eventually the level of fear of the rats should be minimal and exploratory behaviour of the rats will sink to some base level."

Most of the radioactivity was in the nucleoli of growing cells in the meristematic region. Treatment of the labeled cells with ribonuclease indicates that 6-methylpurine-H(3) is incorporated into nucleolar RNA which then moves from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm."

https://openalex.org/W1590822418,"Abstract The relationship between the phospholipid structure of renal cortical tubules and their ability to sequester Rb+ was investigated. When the isolated cortical tubules were treated with low levels of commercial phospholipase C from Clostridium welchii, there was very little destruction of the tubular phospholipid but the sequestration of Rb+ was markedly curtailed. Since such treatment does not affect Rb+ efflux, it appears that phospholipase C treatment acts by inhibiting the uptake of Rb+. The evidence presented indicates that phospholipase C, rather than a contaminant of the preparation or an inhibitory product of the enzyme reaction, depresses Rb+ uptake by its action on the cell membrane phospholipids. Evidence is also presented that indicates that the inhibition of Rb+ uptake is not the result of widespread destruction of the cell. Phospholipase C treatment, which markedly decreases Rb+ uptake, does not depress galactose and 2-deoxygalactose uptake by the cortical tubules. It is concluded that a phospholipid structure (or structures) on the outer surface of the plasma membrane is involved in the uptake of Rb+ by renal cortical cells."
