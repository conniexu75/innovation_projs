We investigated the manner in which speech streams are represented in brain activity and the way that selective attention governs the brain's representation of speech using a ""Cocktail Party"" paradigm, coupled with direct recordings from the cortical surface in surgical epilepsy patients. We find that brain activity dynamically tracks speech streams using both low-frequency phase and high-frequency amplitude fluctuations and that optimal encoding likely combines the two. In and near low-level auditory cortices, attention ""modulates"" the representation by enhancing cortical tracking of attended speech streams, but ignored speech remains represented. In higher-order regions, the representation appears to become more ""selective,"" in that there is no detectable tracking of ignored speech. This selectivity itself seems to sharpen as a sentence unfolds."

Here, we show that, dependent on their position along the dorsoventral axis of the hippocampus, DG granule cells (GCs) control specific features of anxiety and contextual learning. Using optogenetic techniques to either elevate or decrease GC activity, we demonstrate that GCs in the dorsal DG control exploratory drive and encoding, not retrieval, of contextual fear memories. In contrast, elevating the activity of GCs in the ventral DG has no effect on contextual learning but powerfully suppresses innate anxiety. These results suggest that strategies aimed at modulating the excitability of the ventral DG may be beneficial for the treatment of anxiety disorders.

Although this mnemonic function remains undisputed, recent studies have suggested that the hippocampus might also contribute to emotional behavior as neuroimaging studies have implicated hippocampal dysfunction in mood and anxiety disorders (Campbell et al., 2004Campbell S.

Most strikingly, the dorsal hippocampus projects extensively to associational cortical regions whereas the ventral hippocampus projects to regions implicated in autonomic, neuroendocrine, and motivational responses to emotionally charged stimuli, such as prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala, and hypothalamus (Fanselow and Dong, 2010Fanselow M.S.

However, it is not clear how the anatomical heterogeneity of the hippocampus mediates its differential contributions to memory processing and to anxiety-like behavior, or more generally, if changes in hippocampal activity can impact anxiety levels. In addition, it remains unclear whether the three subregions of the hippocampus (dentate gyrus [DG], CA3, and CA1) perform the same operations along the dorsoventral axis. In this study, we sought to examine the effects of acutely increasing or decreasing activity in the dentate gyrus (DG) on cognitive and emotional behavior. We focused on the DG as multiple lines of evidence implicate it in affective processing. For example, DG granule cells (GCs) are especially susceptible to damage by elevated stress hormone levels (McEwen, 1999McEwen B.S. Stress and hippocampal plasticity.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 105-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar), whereas adult neurogenesis, a unique feature of the DG, is increased by factors such as exercise or antidepressant treatment, that elevate mood and is decreased by stress (Dranovsky et al., 2011Dranovsky A.

Furthermore, ablation of neurogenesis blocks certain behavioral effects of antidepressants and some responses to stress (David et al., 2009David D.J. Samuels B.A. Rainer Q. Wang J.W. Marsteller D.

First, we genetically targeted inhibitory and excitatory opsins to the DG’s principal cell type, the granule cell (GC). And second we optically targeted either the dorsal or ventral DG, so as to evaluate the effect of acutely reducing or elevating activity in GCs in awake behaving animals in tests of contextual learning and anxiety-like behavior. To target opsin expression selectively to GCs we employed a mouse line that specifically expresses Cre recombinase in this cell type; the proopiomelanocortin (POMC)—bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) Cre recombinase line (McHugh et al., 2007McHugh T.J.

This line was crossed to conditional mouse lines that contained either the yellow light-activated chloride pump halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0 [Zhang et al., 2007Zhang F. Wang L.P. Brauner M. Liewald J.F.

POMC-eNpHR3.0 and POMC-ChR2 mice were compared to single transgenic littermate control animals throughout. POMC-eNpHR3.0 mice showed robust and selective membrane expression of eNpHR3.0-eYFP in GCs along the entire dorsoventral axis of the DG with pronounced expression in their dendrites and mossy fiber axons that project to CA3 (Figure 1B). Whole-cell recordings from GCs in brain slices from POMC-eNpHR3.0 mice confirmed that a brief pulse of yellow (594 nm) light elicited a robust membrane hyperpolarization that effectively suppressed action potential generation (Figure 1C and see Figure S1 available online). To confirm the functional impact of eNpHR3.0 activation in vivo, the DG was illuminated with yellow light while animals explored a novel environment (for behavior during stimulation, see Figure S2), a task that in eNpHR3.0 single transgenic control animals induced a sparse but robust expression of the activity-induced immediate early gene cFos in the DG (Figure 1D). In POMC-eNpHR3.0 mice ∼60% fewer cells were cFos positive in the region below the implanted fiber optic, indicating effective local inhibition of GC recruitment (Figure 1D). This local suppression of activity was confirmed with both dorsal and ventral DG illumination in vivo (dorsal DG, Figure 2B; ventral DG, Figure 2F). The POMC-ChR2 mice exhibited robust and selective expression of ChR2-tdTomato in DG GCs, in their dendrites and mossy fiber axons, and along the DG’s entire dorsoventral axis (Figures 1E and 1F). Whole-cell recordings of GCs from POMC-ChR2 mice confirmed that blue (473 nm) light elicited inward currents (Figure 1G). Currents were sufficiently large to bring a subpopulation of GCs to action potential threshold to elicit time-locked spiking to light pulses (Figure 1H), and a population in which ChR2 activation generated a robust depolarization from resting potential (Figure S1). Consistently, in the DG of control animals, exploration paired with blue light (for behavior during stimulation, see Figure S2), induced the characteristic sparse expression of cFos whereas in POMC-ChR2 mice, 30%–50% of GCs expressed this activity marker (Figures 1I, 2C, and 2G). Interestingly, blue light stimulation of the DG elicited cFos induction in regions rostral and caudal to the implanted fiber optic (Figures 2C and 2G), most likely due to recurrent excitatory connections within the DG. However, increased cFos expression in CA3 was only observed locally at the level of the implant site, indicating region-specific elevation of DG output to CA3 (Figures 2D and 2H). We began an examination of the specific contribution of DG GCs to behavior by testing if inhibiting GCs in a region-specific manner modulated either the encoding or retrieval of contextual fear memories. First, POMC-eNpHR3.0 and control mice were implanted bilaterally with fiber optics targeted to the dorsal DG (Figure 3A). To test the requirement for dorsal DG activity during the encoding of a context, GC activity was locally suppressed by constant yellow light as mice explored a conditioning context (conditioned stimulus, CS) for 3 min prior to receiving a single foot shock (unconditioned stimulus, US) (Figure 3B). POMC-eNpHR3.0 and control mice responded similarly to the footshock, but POMC-eNpHR3.0 mice exhibited more exploration of the conditioning chamber prior to the shock (Figure S3A). When mice were exposed to the context without light stimulation 24 hr later, POMC-eNpHR3.0 mice exhibited a robust impairment in freezing to the context (Figure 3B). This decrease in freezing was also present when mice were tested with light on during both encoding and retrieval phases (Figure S3B). Encoding deficits were selective for contextual learning, as inhibition of the dorsal DG did not impair the encoding of a tone-shock association (Figure S3C). To test if the dorsal DG is also involved in the retrieval of contextual memories, POMC-eNpHR3.0 mice were trained in contextual fear conditioning in the absence of yellow light, then tested 24 hr later under optical inhibition of the dorsal DG. Interestingly, POMC-eNpHR3.0 mice froze at similar levels to single transgenic controls, indicating that inhibition of the dorsal DG does not impair the retrieval of already learned contextual fear memories (Figure 3C). Together, these data support a specific role for the dorsal DG in the rapid encoding, but not the retrieval, of contextual fear memories. As fear conditioning elicits a robust emotional response, we hypothesized that manipulations of the ventral DG, which has been implicated in emotional control, might similarly affect fear learning. To test this, GC activity in the ventral or intermediate DG was locally suppressed in vivo by constant yellow light (Figures 3 and S3E) as mice explored a conditioning chamber prior to a footshock (Figure 3E). Local suppression on the ventral DG did not impact exploration of the conditioning chamber or response to the footshock (Figure S3D). Twenty-four hours later, the mice were returned to the same context without light stimulation to test for freezing and to retrain in the absence of light stimulation. Surprisingly, POMC-eNpHR3.0 and controls froze similarly to the training context regardless of whether they received light during the training or retrieval sessions (Figure 3E). Thus, silencing of GCs in either the ventral or intermediate DG impaired neither the encoding nor the retrieval of contextual fear memories. To test the contribution of GCs in the dorsal DG to spatial learning, POMC-eNpHR3.0 with dorsally implanted fiber optics were trained in active place avoidance, a spatial task that has been shown to be sensitive to DG manipulations (Burghardt et al., 2012Burghardt N.S. Park E.H. Hen R. Fenton A.A. Adult-born hippocampal neurons promote cognitive flexibility in mice.Hippocampus. 2012; 22: 1795-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In this task, mice were placed on a rotating arena and trained to avoid a stationary shock zone while GC activity in the dorsal DG was locally suppressed with constant yellow light (Figures 4A and S4). Optogenetic inhibition of the dorsal DG did not impact exploration, acquisition or retrieval of the spatial memory (Figure 4B and S4). In addition, analysis of the percent time in each of the zones did not reveal any difference in the first two training sessions (Figures S4D–S4F), though a small effect was seen in the percent time in one of the zones opposite the shock zone in the third training trial before the switch (Figure 4C). This difference did not impact avoidance of the shock zone during this training session (Figures 4C–4D). However, when the location of the shock zone was switched to the opposite side of the room, a variant of the task that required animals to rapidly encode a new contingency and resolve a conflicting memory, POMC-eNpHR3.0 mice showed marked deficits. During suppression of dorsal GC activity, mice entered the new shock zone significantly more (Figure 4D) and spent less time in the safe, opposite zone than nonsuppressed controls (Figures 4C and 4E). These data suggest that GCs in the dorsal DG modulate cognitive flexibility in the resolution of conflicting memories. We next tested the impact of stimulating GCs rather than inhibiting them. GCs are characterized by a sparse activation pattern (Leutgeb et al., 2007Leutgeb J.K. Leutgeb S. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Pattern separation in the dentate gyrus and CA3 of the hippocampus.Science. 2007; 315: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar); a behavioral experience (such as exposure to a novel environment or contextual fear conditioning) induces expression of activity dependent immediate early genes in only ∼5% of the GC population (Chawla et al., 2005Chawla M.K. Guzowski J.F. Ramirez-Amaya V. Lipa P. Hoffman K.L. Marriott L.K. Worley P.F. McNaughton B.L. Barnes C.A. Sparse, environmentally selective expression of Arc RNA in the upper blade of the rodent fascia dentata by brief spatial experience.Hippocampus. 2005; 15: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). By stimulating DG GCs in POMC-ChR2 mice we increased dramatically overall DG activity (Figure 1I) and examined the impact of this manipulation on contextual learning. To assess the consequence of elevating activity within the DG GC population on the encoding of contextual fear, mice explored a conditioning chamber for 3 min while receiving 10 Hz blue light illumination of the dorsal DG (Figure 5A). POMC-ChR2 and control mice responded similarly to the foot shock, yet POMC-ChR2 mice exhibited significantly more exploration of the conditioning chamber (Figure S5A). Twenty-four hours later, mice were placed back in the conditioning chamber in the absence of light stimulation to test if stimulation had affected encoding. Optogenetic stimulation of the dorsal DG robustly impaired the encoding of contextual fear, as POMC-ChR2 mice showed a marked decrease in freezing to the conditioning context as compared to controls (Figure 5B). This decrease in freezing was also seen when blue light was given during both encoding and retrieval phases (Figure S5B). Next, we probed the effect of optogenetic stimulation of GCs in the dorsal DG on retrieval of conditioned fear. Unlike eNpHR3.0-mediated inhibition, optogenetic activation of these cells robustly impaired the retrieval of contextual fear memories, as POMC-ChR2 mice exhibited decreased freezing to the conditioning context as compared to controls (Figure 5B). In addition, optogenetic stimulation of the GCs during retrieval could block the expression of an already initiated freezing response (Figure S5C). Yet, elevation of activity in this proportion of GCs did not permanently erase the memory as when mice were retested the same day, in the absence of light, the memory for the context was intact, as both genotypes froze similarly to the conditioning context (Figure 5B). Similar results were obtained when stimulating the intermediate portion of DG (Figure S5F). To rule out the possibility that optical stimulation of the dorsal DG impairs any ability to learn or express a freezing response, we tested the effects of light stimulation of GCs on encoding or retrieving a tone-shock association. The encoding and retrieval of cued fear memories were intact, demonstrating that the elevation of activity in DG GCs selectively impairs the encoding and retrieval of a hippocampus-dependent contextual fear memory (Figure S5D). We next asked whether elevating DG activity in the ventral DG would produce similar impairments in contextual fear encoding and retrieval. POMC-ChR2 mice were implanted with fiber optics targeted to the ventral DG (Figure 5C) and trained in contextual fear conditioning in an identical fashion as mice implanted dorsally. Optogenetic activation of the ventral DG did not impact exploration or response to the footshock (Figure S5E). Surprisingly, ChR2-mediated stimulation of GCs in the ventral DG had no effect on either the encoding or retrieval of fear memories (Figure 5D), further implicating the specific contribution of the dorsal DG to contextual encoding. Finally, we tested the impact of modulating activity in the DG on innate anxiety-related behavior. Mice were tested in two well-validated tests of conflict anxiety, the elevated plus maze (EPM) and the open field test (OFT) (Belzung and Griebel, 2001Belzung C. Griebel G. Measuring normal and pathological anxiety-like behaviour in mice: a review.Behav. Brain Res. 2001; 125: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Due to an innate aversion to bright, open spaces, mice in these tests avoid the open arms of the EPM and the center of the OFT, such that entrances into or time in these areas is inversely related to anxiety levels. We first tested whether inhibition of either the dorsal or ventral DG influenced anxiety-like behavior. POMC-eNpHR3.0 mice were implanted with fiber optics targeted to either the dorsal or ventral DG and tested for consequences of light-induced suppression of activity on anxiety state. In neither the EPM or OFT did suppression of activity in any portion of the DG impact anxiety-related behaviors or locomotor levels regardless of whether light was provided after an initial light off epoch (Figure S6) or if light was given at the beginning of the test (data not shown). This suggests that brief suppression of DG activity does not impact baseline anxiety state. Next, we examined the effect of localized ChR2-mediated stimulation of GCs on baseline anxiety state. First, POMC-ChR2 mice were implanted bilaterally with fiber optics targeting the dorsal DG and tested for acute effects of light stimulation on anxiety-related behaviors (Figure 6A). In both tests, activation of the dorsal DG elicited a dramatic increase in exploration of novel environments: stimulation increased time in the open arms of the EPM (Figure 6C) and total exploration of the OFT and EPM (Figures 6D and 6G) but did not significantly alter the percent distance traveled in the center of the open field (Figure 6F). Interestingly, this increase in exploration extended beyond the light stimulation epoch, which may be due to either induction of plasticity of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses as a consequence of the stimulation or due to the decreased aversion to the testing apparatus due to increased exploration during the light-on period. This robust elevation of exploratory drive was specific for novel environments, as exploration induced by novel objects or another mouse was unaffected by light stimulation (Figure S6D). The blue light-induced increase in exploration in a novel environment was absent in mice treated with the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, SCH23390 demonstrating that it required intact dopaminergic function (Figure S6E). When mice were tested for light effects in home cage exploration, the effect of light stimulation was attenuated as compared to testing in a novel environment, yet habituation to the testing conditions was impaired in POMC-ChR2 mice as compared to control mice (Figure S6F). We next asked whether stimulation of GCs in the ventral DG would have a similar effect. POMC-ChR2 mice implanted with fiber optics targeted to the ventral portion of the DG were tested for acute effects of light stimulation. Light stimulation of GCs in the ventral DG induced a robust, acute, and reversible anxiolytic response in the EPM and OFT, with mice spending significantly more time in the open arms of the maze during the light-on epoch (Figure 6J; Movie S1) and traveling more in the center of the OFT (Figure 6M). In contrast to dorsal stimulation, light activation of the ventral DG did not influence overall exploratory activity, as total distance traveled in the OFT and the EPM did not differ between genotypes in the light-on epoch (Figures 6K and 6N). Stimulation of the intermediate portion of the DG produced a hybrid effect, by modestly increasing exploration, and decreasing anxiety (Figure S6G). These results suggest that the DG modulates exploration via its dorsal pole and anxiety-like behavior via its ventral pole. By using optogenetic techniques that allow neural activity in DG GCs to be acutely, reversibly and bidirectionally manipulated, we have shown that the dorsal and ventral poles of the hippocampus are functionally distinct and demonstrate that hippocampal activity not only has a mnemonic function but can also strongly influence anxiety-related behaviors. Specifically, dorsal GCs were shown to contribute to spatial and contextual learning, where they were required for rapid encoding of contextual information, but not for memory retrieval. Surprisingly, elevating dorsal DG activity also induced a dramatic increase in exploratory behavior in novel environments. The ventral DG was not required for contextual fear learning, but was found to exert a major influence on innate anxiety-like behavior (Table 1).Table 1Summary of Effects of DG Manipulations on Learning and AnxietyContextual LearningInnate ResponsesEncodingRetrievalExplorationAnxietyInhibition of GCs in dorsal DG↓———Inhibition of GCs in ventral DG————Activation of GCs in dorsal DG↓↓↑—↓Activation of GCs in ventral DG———↓ Open table in a new tab As our experimental design allowed epoch-selective manipulations of GC activity, we could directly demonstrate that DG GCs are required for the encoding of contextual information, but not its retrieval.

Given the potential for future lethal pandemics, effective drugs are needed for the treatment of severe influenza such as that caused by H5N1 viruses. Using mediator lipidomics and bioactive lipid screen, we report that the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-derived lipid mediator protectin D1 (PD1) markedly attenuated influenza virus replication via RNA export machinery. Production of PD1 was suppressed during severe influenza and PD1 levels inversely correlated with the pathogenicity of H5N1 viruses. Suppression of PD1 was genetically mapped to 12/15-lipoxygenase activity. Importantly, PD1 treatment improved the survival and pathology of severe influenza in mice, even under conditions where known antiviral drugs fail to protect from death.

We report here that even though there is an expansion of follicular helper T (TFH) cells in HIV-infected individuals, the cells are unable to provide adequate B cell help. We found a higher frequency of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)(+) germinal center B cells from lymph nodes of HIV-infected individuals suggesting a potential role for PD-1-PD-L1 interaction in regulating TFH cell function. In fact, we show that engagement of PD-1 on TFH cells leads to a reduction in cell proliferation, activation, inducible T-cell co-stimulator (ICOS) expression and interleukin-21 (IL-21) cytokine secretion. Blocking PD-1 signaling enhances HIV-specific immunoglobulin production in vitro. We further show that at least part of this defect involves IL-21, as addition of this cytokine rescues antibody responses and plasma cell generation in vitro. Our results suggest that deregulation of TFH cell-mediated B cell help diminishes B cell responses during HIV infection and may be related to PD-1 triggering on TFH cells. These results demonstrate a role for TFH cell impairment in HIV pathogenesis and suggest that enhancing their function could have a major impact on the outcome and control of HIV infection, preventing future infections and improving immune responses to vaccinations."
https://openalex.org/W2149542744,"Despite significant progress in the treatment of breast cancer, particularly through the use of targeted therapy, relapse and chemoresistance remain a major hindrance to the fight to minimize the burden of the disease. It is becoming increasingly clear that a rare subpopulation of cells known as cancer stem cells (CSC), able to be generated through epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and capable of tumor initiation and self-renewal, contributes to treatment resistance and metastases. This means that a more effective therapy should target both the chemoresistant CSCs and the proliferating epithelial cells that give rise to them to reverse EMT and to attenuate their conversion to CSCs. Here, we demonstrate a novel function of AXL in acting upstream to induce EMT in normal and immortalized human mammary epithelial cells in an apparent positive feedback loop mechanism and regulate breast CSC (BCSC) self-renewal and chemoresistance. Downregulation of AXL using MP470 (Amuvatinib) reversed EMT in mesenchymal normal human mammary epithelial cells and murine BCSCs attenuating self-renewal and restored chemosensitivity of the BCSCs. AXL expression was also found to be associated with the expression of stem cell genes, regulation of metastases genes, increased tumorigenicity and was important for BCSC invasion and migration. Inactivation of AXL also led to the downregulation of nuclear factor-κB pathway and reduced tumor formation in vivo. Taken together, our data suggest that targeted therapy against AXL, in combination with systemic therapies, has the potential to improve response to anticancer therapies and to reduce breast cancer recurrence and metastases."
https://openalex.org/W2145067337,"CLP1 was the first mammalian RNA kinase to be identified. However, determining its in vivo function has been elusive. Here we generated kinase-dead Clp1 (Clp1(K/K)) mice that show a progressive loss of spinal motor neurons associated with axonal degeneration in the peripheral nerves and denervation of neuromuscular junctions, resulting in impaired motor function, muscle weakness, paralysis and fatal respiratory failure. Transgenic rescue experiments show that CLP1 functions in motor neurons. Mechanistically, loss of CLP1 activity results in accumulation of a novel set of small RNA fragments, derived from aberrant processing of tyrosine pre-transfer RNA. These tRNA fragments sensitize cells to oxidative-stress-induced p53 (also known as TRP53) activation and p53-dependent cell death. Genetic inactivation of p53 rescues Clp1(K/K) mice from the motor neuron loss, muscle denervation and respiratory failure. Our experiments uncover a mechanistic link between tRNA processing, formation of a new RNA species and progressive loss of lower motor neurons regulated by p53."
https://openalex.org/W1986345950,"We have previously shown that miR-486-5p is one of the most downregulated micro RNAs in lung cancer. The objective of the study was to investigate the role of miR-486-5p in the progression and metastasis of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We evaluated miR-486-5p expression status on 76 frozen and 33 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of NSCLC by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR to determine its clinicopathologic significance. We then performed function analysis of miR-486-5p to determine its potential roles on cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo. We also investigated the target genes of miR-486-5p in lung tumorigenesis. miR-486-5p expression level was significantly lower in lung tumors compared with their corresponding normal tissues (P<0.0001), and associated with stage (P=0.0001) and lymph node metastasis of NSCLC (P=0.0019). Forced expression of miR-486-5p inhibited NSCLC cell migration and invasion in vitro and metastasis in mice by inhibiting cell proliferation. Furthermore, ectopic expression of miR-486-5p in cancer cells reduced ARHGAP5 expression level, whereas miR-486-5p silencing increased its expression. Luciferase assay demonstrated that miR-486-5p could directly bind to the 3′-untranslated region of ARHGAP5. The expression level of miR-486-5p was inversely correlated with that of ARHGAP5 in lung tumor tissues (P=0.0156). Reduced expression of ARHGAP5 considerably inhibited lung cancer cell migration and invasion, resembling that of miR-486-5p overexpression. miR-486-5p may act as a tumor-suppressor contributing to the progression and metastasis of NSCLC by targeting ARHGAP5. miR-486-5p would provide potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets for the disease."
https://openalex.org/W1995958788,"The regulated loading of the Mcm2-7 DNA helicase (comprising six related subunits, Mcm2 to Mcm7) into pre-replicative complexes at multiple replication origins ensures precise once per cell cycle replication in eukaryotic cells. The origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6 and Cdt1 load Mcm2-7 into a double hexamer bound around duplex DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction, but the molecular mechanism of this origin 'licensing' is still poorly understood. Here we show that both Mcm2-7 hexamers in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are recruited to origins by an essential, conserved carboxy-terminal domain of Mcm3 that interacts with and stimulates the ATPase activity of ORC-Cdc6. ATP hydrolysis can promote Mcm2-7 loading, but can also promote Mcm2-7 release if components are missing or if ORC has been inactivated by cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation. Our work provides new insights into how origins are licensed and reveals a novel ATPase-dependent mechanism contributing to precise once per cell cycle replication."
https://openalex.org/W2044805330,"Genes underlying mutant phenotypes can be isolated by combining marker discovery, genetic mapping and resequencing, but a more straightforward strategy for mapping mutations would be the direct comparison of mutant and wild-type genomes. Applying such an approach, however, is hampered by the need for reference sequences and by mutational loads that confound the unambiguous identification of causal mutations. Here we introduce NIKS (needle in the k-stack), a reference-free algorithm based on comparing k-mers in whole-genome sequencing data for precise discovery of homozygous mutations. We applied NIKS to eight mutants induced in nonreference rice cultivars and to two mutants of the nonmodel species Arabis alpina. In both species, comparing pooled F2 individuals selected for mutant phenotypes revealed small sets of mutations including the causal changes. Moreover, comparing M3 seedlings of two allelic mutants unambiguously identified the causal gene. Thus, for any species amenable to mutagenesis, NIKS enables forward genetics without requiring segregating populations, genetic maps and reference sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2117918664,"Induction of histone acetylation in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain reward region, promotes cocaine-induced alterations in gene expression. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) tightly regulate the acetylation of histone tails, but little is known about the functional specificity of different HDAC isoforms in the development and maintenance of cocaine-induced plasticity, and previous studies of HDAC inhibitors report conflicting effects on cocaine-elicited behavioral adaptations. Here we demonstrate that specific and prolonged blockade of HDAC1 in NAc of mice increased global levels of histone acetylation, but also induced repressive histone methylation and antagonized cocaine-induced changes in behavior, an effect mediated in part through a chromatin-mediated suppression of GABAA receptor subunit expression and inhibitory tone on NAc neurons. Our findings suggest a new mechanism by which prolonged and selective HDAC inhibition can alter behavioral and molecular adaptations to cocaine and inform the development of therapeutics for cocaine addiction."
https://openalex.org/W2046033692,"A central question about human brain aging is whether cognitive enrichment slows the development of Alzheimer changes. Here, we show that prolonged exposure to an enriched environment (EE) facilitated signaling in the hippocampus of wild-type mice that promoted long-term potentiation. A key feature of the EE effect was activation of β2-adrenergic receptors and downstream cAMP/PKA signaling. This EE pathway prevented LTP inhibition by soluble oligomers of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) isolated from AD cortex. Protection by EE occurred in both young and middle-aged wild-type mice. Exposure to novelty afforded greater protection than did aerobic exercise. Mice chronically fed a β-adrenergic agonist without EE were protected from hippocampal impairment by Aβ oligomers. Thus, EE enhances hippocampal synaptic plasticity by activating β-adrenoceptor signaling and mitigating synaptotoxicity of human Aβ oligomers. These mechanistic insights support using prolonged exposure to cognitive novelty and/or oral β-adrenergic agonists to lessen the effects of Aβ accumulation during aging."

Xiaochao Ma and colleagues now report the mechanisms behind this side effect, thus opening a possible avenue to the safer use of these effective drugs. Co-therapy with rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) used to treat tuberculosis in humans frequently causes liver injury. Here, using a pregnane X receptor (PXR)-humanized mouse model, we found that co-treatment with RIF and INH causes accumulation of the endogenous hepatotoxin protoporphyrin IX in the liver through PXR-mediated alteration of the heme biosynthesis pathway. These results provide insight into the mechanism of liver injury induced by co-treatment with these compounds and may lead to their safer use in the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W2158434487,"Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a polymicrobial imbalance of the vaginal microbiota associated with reproductive infections, preterm birth, and other adverse health outcomes. Sialidase activity in vaginal fluids is diagnostic of BV and sialic acid-rich components of mucus have protective and immunological roles. However, whereas mucus degradation is believed to be important in the etiology and complications associated with BV, the role(s) of sialidases and the participation of individual bacterial species in the degradation of mucus barriers in BV have not been investigated. Here we demonstrate that the BV-associated bacterium Gardnerella vaginalis uses sialidase to break down and deplete sialic acid-containing mucus components in the vagina. Biochemical evidence using purified sialoglycan substrates supports a model in which 1) G. vaginalis extracellular sialidase hydrolyzes mucosal sialoglycans, 2) liberated sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid) is transported into the bacterium, a process inhibited by excess N-glycolylneuraminic acid, and 3) sialic acid catabolism is initiated by an intracellular aldolase/lyase mechanism. G. vaginalis engaged in sialoglycan foraging in vitro, in the presence of human vaginal mucus, and in vivo, in a murine vaginal model, in each case leading to depletion of sialic acids. Comparison of sialic acid levels in human vaginal specimens also demonstrated significant depletion of mucus sialic acids in women with BV compared with women with a ""normal"" lactobacilli-dominated microbiota. Taken together, these studies show that G. vaginalis utilizes sialidase to support the degradation, foraging, and depletion of protective host mucus barriers, and that this process of mucus barrier degradation and depletion also occurs in the clinical setting of BV."
https://openalex.org/W2117222475,"In recent years, epigenetic markers emerged as a new tool to understand the influence of lifestyle factors on obesity phenotypes. Adolescence is considered an important epigenetic window over a human's lifetime. The objective of this work was to explore baseline changes in DNA methylation that could be associated with a better weight loss response after a multidisciplinary intervention program in Spanish obese or overweight adolescents. Overweight or obese adolescents (n=107) undergoing 10 wk of a multidisciplinary intervention for weight loss were assigned as high or low responders to the treatment. A methylation microarray was performed to search for baseline epigenetic differences between the 2 groups (12 subjects/group), and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was used to validate (n=107) relevant CpG sites and surrounding regions. After validation, 5 regions located in or near AQP9, DUSP22, HIPK3, TNNT1, and TNNI3 genes showed differential methylation levels between high and low responders to the multidisciplinary weight loss intervention. Moreover, a calculated methylation score was significantly associated with changes in weight, BMI-SDS, and body fat mass loss after the treatment. In summary, we have identified 5 DNA regions that are differentially methylated depending on weight loss response. These methylation changes may help to better understand the weight loss response in obese adolescents.—Moleres, A., Campión, J., Milagro, F. I., Marcos, A., Campoy, C., Garagorri, J.

https://openalex.org/W1993784744,"The lens of the eye is composed of fiber cells, which differentiate from epithelial cells and undergo programmed organelle degradation during terminal differentiation. Although autophagy, a major intracellular degradation system, is constitutively active in these cells, its physiological role has remained unclear. We have previously shown that Atg5-dependent macroautophagy is not necessary for lens organelle degradation, at least during the embryonic period. Here, we generated lens-specific Atg5 knock-out mice and showed that Atg5 is not required for lens organelle degradation at any period of life. However, deletion of Atg5 in the lens results in age-related cataract, which is accompanied by accumulation of polyubiquitinated and oxidized proteins, p62, and insoluble crystallins, suggesting a defect in intracellular quality control. We also produced lens-specific Pik3c3 knock-out mice to elucidate the possible involvement of Atg5-independent alternative autophagy, which is proposed to be dependent on Pik3c3 (also known as Vps34), in lens organelle degradation. Deletion of Pik3c3 in the lens does not affect lens organelle degradation, but it leads to congenital cataract and a defect in lens development after birth likely due to an impairment of the endocytic pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that clearance of lens organelles is independent of macroautophagy. These findings also clarify the physiological role of Atg5 and Pik3c3 in quality control and development of the lens, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2093091016,"Tumor-initiating cells (TICs) are a sub-population of cells that exhibit a robust ability to self-renew and contribute to the formation of primary tumors, the relapse of previously treated tumors and the development of metastases. TICs have been identified in various tumors including those of the breast, and are particularly enriched in the basal-like and claudin-low subtypes of breast cancer. The signaling pathways that contribute to the function and maintenance of TICs are under intense study. We explored the potential involvement of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) family of transcription factors in TICs in cell lines that are representative of basal-like and claudin-low breast cancer. NF-κB was found to be activated in breast cancer cells that form tumorspheres efficiently. Moreover, both canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling is required for these cells to self-renew in vitro and to form xenograft tumors efficiently in vivo using limiting dilutions of cells. Consistent with this fact, canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling is activated in TICs isolated from breast cancer cell lines. Experimental results indicate that NF-κB promotes the function of TICs by stimulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and by upregulating the expression of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and interleukin-6. The results suggest the use of NF-κB inhibitors for clinical therapy of certain breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1986375477,"Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women worldwide, and metastasis represents the most devastating stage of the disease. Recent studies have revealed that microRNAs (miRNA) have critical roles to regulate cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Here we present evidence to show the role of miR-182 in breast cancer metastasis. miR-182 is upregulated in the malignant cell line variants of both human MCF10 and mouse 4T1 series. Ectopic expression of miR-182 enhanced breast cancer cell motility and invasiveness, whereas miR-182 inhibition resulted in opposite changes. In nude mice, miR-182 led to increased pulmonary colonization of cancer cells. We further demonstrated that miR-182 directly targets MIM (Missing in Metastasis), which suppresses metastasis by inhibiting ras homolog family member A (RhoA) activity and stress fiber formation in breast cancer cells. Restoring MIM expression completely blocked the pro-metastasis function of miR-182, while RhoA inhibition reversed the phenotypes of both miR-182 overexpression and MIM knockdown. In breast tumor samples, miR-182 induction is linked to downregulation of MIM, RhoA activation and poor prognosis. Hence, our data delineates the molecular pathway by which miR-182 promotes breast cancer invasion and metastasis, and may have important implication for the treatment of metastatic cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2031926980,"Stress facilitates reinstatement of addictive drug seeking in animals and promotes relapse in humans. Acute stress has marked and long-lasting effects on plasticity at both inhibitory and excitatory synapses on dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key region necessary for drug reinforcement. Stress blocks long-term potentiation at GABAergic synapses on dopamine neurons in the VTA (LTPGABA), potentially removing a normal brake on activity. Here we show that blocking kappa opioid receptors (KORs) prior to forced-swim stress rescues LTPGABA. In contrast, blocking KORs does not prevent stress-induced potentiation of excitatory synapses nor morphine-induced block of LTPGABA. Using a kappa receptor antagonist as a selective tool to test the role of LTPGABA in vivo, we find that blocking KORs within the VTA prior to forced-swim stress prevents reinstatement of cocaine seeking. These results suggest that KORs may represent a useful therapeutic target for treatment of stress-triggered relapse in substance abuse."
https://openalex.org/W2007531307,"The epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the pivotal mechanism underlying the initiation of cancer invasion and metastasis. Although Mel-18 has been implicated in several biological processes in cancer, its function in the EMT of human cancers has not yet been studied. Here, we demonstrate that Mel-18 negatively regulates the EMT by epigenetically modulating miR-205. We identified miR-205 as a novel target of Mel-18 using a microRNA microarray analysis and found that Mel-18 increased miR-205 transcription by the inhibition of DNA methyltransferase-mediated DNA methylation of the miR-205 promoter, thereby downregulating its target genes, ZEB1 and ZEB2. Furthermore, the loss of Mel-18 promoted ZEB1- and ZEB2-mediated downregulation of E-cadherin transcription and also enhanced the expression of mesenchymal markers, leading to increased migration and invasion in MCF-7 cells. In MDA-MB-231 cells, Mel-18 overexpression restored E-cadherin expression, resulting in reduced migration and invasion. These effects were reversed by miR-205 overexpression or inhibition. A tumor xenograft with Mel-18 knockdown MCF-7 cells consistently showed increased ZEB1 and ZEB2 expression and decreased E-cadherin expression. Taken together, these results suggest that Mel-18 functions as a tumor suppressor by its novel negative control of the EMT, achieved through regulating the expression of miR-205 and its target genes, ZEB1 and ZEB2."
https://openalex.org/W2088018276,"The brain selects stimuli for preferential processing on the basis of both their physical salience and their relevance to behavior. Recording from the midbrain of the barn owl, the authors show that a single inhibitory circuit is critical for both physical salience-driven (exogenous) and internally driven (endogenous) control of stimulus selection. The mechanisms by which the brain suppresses distracting stimuli to control the locus of attention are unknown. We found that focal, reversible inactivation of a single inhibitory circuit in the barn owl midbrain tegmentum, the nucleus isthmi pars magnocellularis (Imc), abolished both stimulus-driven (exogenous) and internally driven (endogenous) competitive interactions in the optic tectum (superior colliculus in mammals), which are vital to the selection of a target among distractors in behaving animals. Imc neurons transformed spatially precise multisensory and endogenous input into powerful inhibitory output that suppressed competing representations across the entire tectal space map. We identified a small, but highly potent, circuit that is employed by both exogenous and endogenous signals to exert competitive suppression in the midbrain selection network. Our findings reveal, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time, a neural mechanism for the construction of a priority map that is critical for the selection of the most important stimulus for gaze and attention."
https://openalex.org/W1994044740,"The posterior parietal cortex plays a central role in spatial functions, such as spatial attention and saccadic eye movements. However, recent work has increasingly focused on the role of parietal cortex in encoding nonspatial cognitive factors such as visual categories, learned stimulus associations, and task rules. The relationship between spatial encoding and nonspatial cognitive signals in parietal cortex, and whether cognitive signals are robustly encoded in the presence of strong spatial neuronal responses, is unknown. We directly compared nonspatial cognitive and spatial encoding in the lateral intraparietal (LIP) area by training monkeys to perform a visual categorization task during which they made saccades toward or away from LIP response fields (RFs). Here we show that strong saccade-related responses minimally influence robustly encoded category signals in LIP. This suggests that cognitive and spatial signals are encoded independently in LIP and underscores the role of parietal cortex in nonspatial cognitive functions."
https://openalex.org/W2064162861,"Thrombin cleaves the N terminus of PAR1, generating a new N-terminal domain that functions as a tethered ligand that binds intermolecularly to activate PAR2 in trans. The mechanisms that regulate PAR1-PAR2 heterodimer signaling and trafficking are not known. We now report that PAR1 and PAR2 form a heterodimer that exhibits unique trafficking and signaling behaviors compared with receptor protomers. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, immunofluorescence microscopy, co-immunoprecipitation, and cells expressing receptors exogenously and endogenously, we show that PAR1 and PAR2 specifically interact and form stable dimers. Intriguingly, the PAR1-PAR2 heterodimer displays constitutive internalization that is driven by PAR1 C-terminal tail sorting motifs and is a process that enhances dimer formation. Upon thrombin activation, PAR1-PAR2 dimers co-internalize and recruit β-arrestins to endosomes. Remarkably, PAR1-PAR2 heterodimers appear to utilize a distinct interface for β-arrestin interaction compared with receptor protomers. Moreover, thrombin-activated PAR1-PAR2 heterodimers enhance β-arrestin-mediated ERK1/2 activation in the cytoplasm, whereas activated ERK1/2 induced by the thrombin-activated PAR1 protomer redistributes to the nucleus. Thus, the formation of PAR1-PAR2 heterodimers provides additional modes of thrombin-stimulated signaling responses that appear to be distinctly regulated compared with the receptor protomer."

A cellular bioenergetics based on just one coupling site that is fueled by reduced ferredoxin raises the question of how ferredoxin is reduced. The redox potential of the ferredoxin in A. woodii can be considered to be in the range of ≈−500 mV, and thus, electron transfer from hydrogen (E0′ = −414 mV) or NADH (E0′ = −320 mV) to ferredoxin is highly endergonic and thermodynamically impossible. Recently, a soluble hydrogenase was purified from A. woodii that drives the endergonic ferredoxin (Fd) reduction with H2 as reductant by coupling it to the exergonic electron transfer from hydrogen to NAD+ by electron bifurcation (19Schuchmann K. Müller V. A bacterial electron-bifurcating hydrogenase.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 31165-31171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) according to Equation 1. 2H2+Fd+NAD+↔Fd2-+NADH+3H+(Eq. 1) Electrons derived from NADH are then channeled by soluble cytoplasmic enzymes to the terminal electron acceptor carbon dioxide (carbonate respiration or acetogenesis) or caffeate (caffeate respiration) (7Imkamp F.

After a CoA is transferred to caffeate, hydrocaffeate is released into the ecosystem. In addition to the genes encoding the CoA transferase and an ATP-dependent caffeyl-CoA synthetase required for the initial activation, the car operon encodes a potential acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (CarC) and the two subunits of an electron transfer flavoprotein (CarDE). The reduction of caffeyl-CoA with NADH as reductant is exergonic, and the energy gained from this reaction may be used to drive the endergonic ferredoxin reduction with NADH as reductant by flavin-based electron bifurcation (23Herrmann G.

To address this question, we purified the caffeyl-CoA reductase-Etf complex and present evidence for ferredoxin reduction coupled to caffeyl-CoA reduction with NADH as reductant. The energetics of caffeate reduction is discussed. A. woodii (DSM 1030) was grown at 30 °C under anaerobic conditions in 20-liter flasks (Glasgerätebau Ochs, Bovenden/Lenglern, Germany) using 20 mm fructose as the carbon and energy source as described previously (27Heise R.

Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5473-5478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At A600 ∼ 0.3, caffeate was added to a concentration of 5 mm. The medium and all buffers were prepared using the anaerobic techniques described previously (29Bryant M.P. Commentary on the Hungate technique for culture of anaerobic bacteria.Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1972; 25: 1324-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 30Hungate R.E. A roll tube method for cultivation of strict anaerobes.in: Norris J.R. Ribbons D.W. Methods in Microbiology.

All buffers contained 2 mm dithioerythritol (DTE) 3The abbreviation used is: DTEdithioerythritol. and 4 μm resazurin. 5 μm FAD was added to all purification buffers to avoid loss of activity. All purification steps were performed under strictly anaerobic conditions at room temperature in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Grass Lake Charter Township, MI) filled with 98–95% N2 and 2–5% H2 as described (27Heise R. Müller V. Gottschalk G. Presence of a sodium-translocating ATPase in membrane vesicles of the homoacetogenic bacterium Acetobacterium woodii.Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cells of A. woodii were harvested at A600 = 1.5 and washed twice with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) and 420 mm sucrose and resuspended in 150 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 420 mm sucrose. 500 mg of lysozyme was added, and the suspension was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After centrifugation, the protoplasts were resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgSO4, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 0.1 mg/ml DNase I and passed three times through a French pressure cell at 110 megapascals. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 24,000 × g for 40 min. Membranes were removed by centrifugation at 130,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant containing the cytoplasmic fraction with ∼1600 mg of protein was applied to a Q Sepharose high performance column (2.6 × 5 cm) equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm MgSO4, 5 μm FAD, and 20% glycerol (pH 7.5)). Protein was eluted with a 150-ml linear gradient of 0–0.35 m NaCl in buffer A. Methyl viologen-dependent caffeyl-CoA reductase activity eluted at ∼0.3 mm NaCl. After the addition of ammonium sulfate (1.25 m), the pooled fractions were loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose high performance column (1.6 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 1.25 m (NH4)2SO4 in buffer A. Protein was eluted with a 250-ml linear gradient of 1.25 to 0 m (NH4)2SO4. Caffeyl-CoA reductase activity eluted at ∼0.7 m (NH4)2SO4. Pooled fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration in 50-kDa Vivaspin tubes (Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH). For the following purification step with a HiTrap Blue Sepharose high performance column (5 ml), the removal of the ammonium sulfate in the sample was crucial to ensure binding to the column; this was done by a 10-fold dilution with buffer A. The sample was loaded onto the column equilibrated with buffer A, and protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl. Caffeyl-CoA reductase activity eluted in a broad peak at ∼170 mm NaCl. Pooled fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration in 50-kDa Vivaspin tubes. The sample was applied to a Sephacryl S-300 high resolution column (1.6 × 60 cm) equilibrated with buffer A and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Caffeyl-CoA reductase activity eluted as a single peak. Pooled fractions were concentrated to a minimum of 5 mg/ml and stored at 4 °C. dithioerythritol. All measurements were performed at 30 °C in 1.8-ml anaerobic cuvettes (Glasgerätebau Ochs) sealed with rubber stoppers in a N2 atmosphere. A caffeyl-CoA regeneration system was used in all measurements (200 units of CoA transferase and 0.25 mm caffeate), and the CoA transferase was overproduced and purified as described (24Hess V. González J.M. Parthasarathy A. Buckel W. Müller V. Caffeate respiration in the acetogenic bacterium Acetobacterium woodii: a CoA loop saves energy for caffeate activation.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2013; 79: 1942-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Measurements where done routinely using a methyl viologen oxidation assay with 5 mm methyl viologen in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm MgSO4, and 2 mm DTE, pH 7.5). The addition of 1 mm sodium dithionite resulted in partial reduction of the methyl viologen. The reaction was started by the addition of 5 μm caffeyl-CoA. Methyl viologen oxidation was monitored at 604 nm (ϵ = 13.8 mm−1 cm−1), and 1 unit is defined as the reduction of 1 μmol of caffeyl-CoA/min. Physiological caffeyl-CoA reductase activity was measured in buffer B with 0.5 mm NADH as electron donor. The reaction was started by the addition of at least one of the following electron acceptors: caffeyl-CoA (5 μm), ferredoxin (20 μm), FAD (0.25 mm), or FMN (0.25 mm). The reduction of caffeate was monitored at 312 nm (ϵ = 13.72 mm−1 cm−1), and the reduction of ferredoxin was monitored at 430 nm (ϵ = 13.1 mm−1 cm−1). Ferredoxin was purified from Clostridium pasteurianum as described (31Schönheit P. Wäscher C. Thauer R.K. A rapid procedure for the purification of ferredoxin from Clostridia using polyethylenimine.FEBS Lett. 1978; 89: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In initial experiments, caffeyl-CoA was synthesized chemically (24Hess V. González J.M. Parthasarathy A. Buckel W. Müller V. Caffeate respiration in the acetogenic bacterium Acetobacterium woodii: a CoA loop saves energy for caffeate activation.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2013; 79: 1942-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For the experiments described here, caffeyl-CoA was synthesized enzymatically with the caffeyl-CoA synthetase from A. woodii (22Hess V. Vitt S. Müller V. A caffeyl-coenzyme A synthetase initiates caffeate activation prior to caffeate reduction in the acetogenic bacterium Acetobacterium woodii.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The synthesis of caffeyl-CoA in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 20 mm MgSO4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm CoA, 0.25 mm caffeate, and 2 mg of enzyme was followed by ultrafiltration in 30-kDa Vivaspin tubes to remove the enzyme. The yellow flow-through was concentrated in a centrifugal evaporator to a final concentration of 1 mm caffeyl-CoA (ϵ346 = 18.0 mm−1 cm−1) and stored at 4 °C. The concentration of proteins was measured according to Bradford (32Bradford M.M. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantification of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye-binding.Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215700) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. The molecular mass of the purified caffeyl-CoA reductase was determined using a calibrated Sephacryl S-300 column equilibrated with buffer A. The iron and sulfur content of the purified enzyme was determined by colorimetric methods (33Fish W.W. Rapid colorimetric micromethod for the quantitation of complexed iron in biological samples.Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 34Beinert H. Semi-micro methods for analysis of labile sulfide and of labile sulfide plus sulfane sulfur in unusually stable iron-sulfur proteins.Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). To determine the flavin content of the purified enzyme, 1 nmol of protein was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 500 mm. The nature of the flavin in the supernatant was identified by thin layer chromatography on Silica Gel 60 sheets (Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co. KG) with 5% Na2HPO4 in H2O or 1-butanol/acetic acid/H2O (12:3:5) as the mobile phase. The amount of bound flavin was calculated by comparing the absorbance of the yellow supernatant at 450 nm with a calibration line with FAD treated the same way (35Hetzel M. Brock M. Selmer T. Pierik A.J. Golding B.T. Buckel W. Acryloyl-CoA reductase from Clostridium propionicum. An enzyme complex of propionyl-CoA dehydrogenase and electron-transferring flavoprotein.Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 902-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The activity of the caffeyl-CoA reductase-Etf complex was measured using dithionite-reduced methyl viologen as electron donor and caffeyl-CoA as electron acceptor. Methyl viologen oxidation was followed spectroscopically at 604 nm. Because caffeyl-CoA is not commercially available, a caffeyl-CoA regeneration system was established. Caffeyl-CoA was reduced with the caffeyl-CoA reductase-Etf complex to hydrocaffeyl-CoA according to Equation 2, 2MV-+caffeyl-CoA→hydrocaffeyl-CoA+2MV(Eq. 2) where MV is methyl viologen. Next, hydrocaffeyl-CoA was used as CoA donor by the hydrocaffeyl-CoA:caffeate-CoA transferase CarA from A. woodii (24Hess V. González J.M. Parthasarathy A. Buckel W. Müller V. Caffeate respiration in the acetogenic bacterium Acetobacterium woodii: a CoA loop saves energy for caffeate activation.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2013; 79: 1942-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) to activate caffeate to caffeyl-CoA (Equation 3). Hydrocaffeyl-CoA+caffeate→hydrocaffeate+caffeyle-CoA(Eq. 3) Thus, in sum, caffeate was reduced to hydrocaffeate according to Equation 4, and the rate of methyl viologen (MV) oxidation is proportional to caffeyl-CoA reduction (1 unit = 1 μmol of caffeyl-CoA/mg). 2MV-+caffeate→hydrocaffeate+2MV(Eq. 4) The dependence of methyl viologen oxidation on the caffeyl-CoA concentration showed saturation at 5 μm caffeyl-CoA with Km = 0.5 μm. To purify the caffeyl-CoA reductase-Etf complex, fructose/caffeate-grown cells were grown to the late exponential growth phase, harvested, and disrupted with a French pressure cell. Membranes were removed by ultracentrifugation, and the caffeyl-CoA reductase-Etf complex was purified from the cytoplasm by ion exchange chromatography on Q Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, and Blue Sepharose, followed by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300. The enzyme was purified by 24-fold to apparent homogeneity with an average specific activity of 14 units/mg in the methyl viologen oxidation assay (Table 1).TABLE 1Purification of the caffeyl-CoA reductase-Etf complex from A. woodiiPurification stepProteinSpecific activityaThe activity of the caffeyl-CoA reductase-Etf complex was determined by following the caffeyl-CoA-dependent oxidation of reduced methyl viologen at 604 nm.

Measurements were performed at 30 °C in anaerobic cuvettes. Open table in a new tab The purified enzyme apparently has three subunits of 41, 39, and 29 kDa (Fig. 1). This fits well with the predicted masses of CarE (42.5 kDa), CarC (41.4 kDa), and CarD (28.2 kDa) and indeed, the proteins were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting as CarE, CarC, and CarD. CarDE is identical to EtfAB identified previously by a proteomics approach to be up-regulated during growth on caffeate (7Imkamp F. Biegel E. Jayamani E. Buckel W. Müller V. Dissection of the caffeate respiratory chain in the acetogen Acetobacterium woodii: indications for a Rnf-type NADH dehydrogenase as coupling site.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 8145-8153Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Analytical gel filtration, as well as separation on a native gel, revealed that the caffeyl-CoA reductase and the electron transfer flavoprotein formed a stable complex. Because the masses of the subunits of the complex are rather small, an accurate estimate of the subunit composition could not be made, but the estimated molecular mass of 350 kDa upon gel filtration is consistent with a homotrimer of CarCDE, which would have a mass of 336 kDa. The spectrum of the yellow-brownish enzyme shows absorbance maxima at 372 and 445 nm (Fig. 2), which indicated oxidized flavin as the prosthetic group (35Hetzel M. Brock M. Selmer T. Pierik A.J. Golding B.T. Buckel W. Acryloyl-CoA reductase from Clostridium propionicum. An enzyme complex of propionyl-CoA dehydrogenase and electron-transferring flavoprotein.Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 902-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The purified complex contained 4 ± 0.2 mol of flavin/mol of CarCDE. This flavin was tightly bound because it could not be removed by gel filtration. Thin layer chromatography identified the flavin as FAD. Iron and acid-labile sulfur were determined colorimetrically according to Fish (33Fish W.W. Rapid colorimetric micromethod for the quantitation of complexed iron in biological samples.Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) and Beinert (34Beinert H. Semi-micro methods for analysis of labile sulfide and of labile sulfide plus sulfane sulfur in unusually stable iron-sulfur proteins.Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The enzyme contained 9 ± 0.5 mol of iron/mol of CarCDE and 9 ± 1.3 mol of acid-labile sulfide/mol of CarCDE. The C terminus of CarE contains eight conserved cysteine residues, which are homologous to the cysteine residues in the ferredoxins from C. pasteurianum and Clostridium acidi-urici harboring two [4Fe-4S] clusters (36Bertini I. Donaire A. Feinberg B.A. Luchinat C. Piccioli M. Yuan H. Solution structure of the oxidized 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxin from Clostridium pasteurianum.Eur. J.

With the determined content of iron and sulfur, two [4Fe-4S] clusters/CarCDE can be predicted. The basic biochemical properties of the enzyme were determined using the caffeyl-CoA-dependent methyl viologen oxidation assay. The caffeyl-CoA reductase activity had an optimum at pH 7.5, and activity decreased to ∼30% at pH 6.0 or 9.0. The enzyme activity exhibited a rather broad temperature optimum, and maximum activity was detected at 30 °C, which is the optimum growth temperature of A. woodii. If caffeate was substituted with p-coumarate or ferulate, the corresponding CoA thioesters were reduced as well. The redox potential of caffeyl-CoA/hydrocaffeyl-CoA is not known, but considering that the reduction of the acrylate side chain of caffeate is thermodynamically equivalent to the reduction of fumarate (21Tschech A. Pfennig N. Growth yield increase linked to caffeate reduction in Acetobacterium woodii.Arch. Microbiol. 1984; 137: 163-167Crossref Scopus (380) Google Scholar), it can be considered to be in the same range as fumarate/succinate with +33 mV (38Thauer R.K. Jungermann K. Decker K. Energy conservation in chemotrophic anaerobic bacteria.Bacteriol. Rev. 1977; 41: 100-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first determined whether the enzyme can catalyze the energetic “downhill” transport of electrons from NADH (E0′ = −320 mV) to caffeyl-CoA (E0′ = +33 mV). Thus, in the enzyme assay, reduced methyl viologen (Equation 4) was replaced with NADH, which is the physiological electron donor of caffeate reduction in A. woodii (7Imkamp F. Biegel E. Jayamani E. Buckel W. Müller V. Dissection of the caffeate respiratory chain in the acetogen Acetobacterium woodii: indications for a Rnf-type NADH dehydrogenase as coupling site.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 8145-8153Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the decrease in caffeate was measured spectroscopically at 312 nm, which is proportional to the reduction of caffeyl-CoA (1 unit = 1 μmol of caffeyl-CoA/mg). With NADH (0.5 mm) as electron donor, caffeyl-CoA (5 μm) was reduced with an activity of 1 unit/mg. To prevent loss of activity, 5 μm FAD had to be added to all buffers during purification. Thus, the CarCDE complex requires FAD for catalytic activity. Next, we tested whether flavins could be used as artificial electron acceptors. No activity could be detected"
https://openalex.org/W2037287757,"We report that K5.Smad7 mice, which express a Smad7 transgene under the control of a keratin 5 promoter, were resistant to radiation-induced oral mucositis, a painful oral ulceration. In addition to nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation, which is known to contribute to oral mucositis, we found activated transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling in cells from this condition. Smad7 dampened both pathways to attenuate inflammation, growth inhibition and apoptosis. Additionally, Smad7 promoted oral epithelial migration to close the wound. Further analyses revealed that TGF-β signaling Smads and their co-repressor C-terminal binding protein 1 (CtBP1) transcriptionally repressed Rac1, and that Smad7 abrogated this repression. Knocking down Rac1 expression in mouse keratinocytes abrogated Smad7-induced migration. Topical application of Smad7 protein conjugated with a cell-permeable Tat tag to oral mucosa showed prophylactic and therapeutic effects on radiation-induced oral mucositis in mice. Thus, we have identified new molecular mechanisms involved in oral mucositis pathogenesis, and our data suggest an alternative therapeutic strategy to block multiple pathological processes in this condition."
https://openalex.org/W1993025278,"The incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has rapidly increased over the past 30 years, prompting the suggestion that an epidemic maybe on the horizon. Therefore, there is a clinical need to develop alternate therapeutic strategies to manage the growing number of HPV-positive HNSCC patients. High-risk HPV E6 inactivates p53 through two distinct mechanisms; association with E6AP to degrade p53 and association with p300 to block p300-mediated p53 acetylation and activation. In this study, we determined if targeting the E6-p300 interaction is an effective approach to reactivate p53 in HPV-positive HNSCC. Ectopic expression of the CH1 domain of p300 in HPV-positive HNSCC blocks the association between E6 and p300, increases total and acetylated p53 levels and enhances p53 transcriptional activity. Moreover, expression of p21, miR-34a and miR-200c are increased, demonstrating functional p53 reactivation. CH1 overexpression in HPV-positive HNSCC has a global anticancer effect resulting in a decrease in cell proliferation and clonogenic survival and an increase in apoptosis. The in vivo tumor-initiating ability of HPV-positive HNSCC is severely compromised with CH1 overexpression, in part through a reduction in the cancer-initiating cell population. A novel small-molecule CH1 inhibitor, CH1iB, reactivates p53 and potentiates the anticancer activity of cis-platinum in HPV-positive HNSCC cells. Our work shows that CH1-domain inhibitors represent a novel class of p53-reactivation therapeutics for managing HPV-positive HNSCC patients."

To resolve the underlying molecular mechanisms, we exposed clonal INS-1 832/13 β-cells to palmitate for 48 h. We observed elevated basal insulin secretion but impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in palmitate-exposed cells. Glucose utilization was unchanged, palmitate oxidation was increased, and oxygen consumption was impaired. Halting exposure of the clonal INS-1 832/13 β-cells to palmitate largely recovered all of the lipid-induced functional changes. Metabolite profiling revealed profound but reversible increases in cellular lipids. Glucose-induced increases in tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates were attenuated by exposure to palmitate. Analysis of gene expression by microarray showed increased expression of 982 genes and decreased expression of 1032 genes after exposure to palmitate. Increases were seen in pathways for steroid biosynthesis, cell cycle, fatty acid metabolism, DNA replication, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids; decreases occurred in the aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis pathway. The activity of histone-modifying enzymes and histone modifications of differentially expressed genes were reversibly altered upon exposure to palmitate. Thus, Insig1, Lss, Peci, Idi1, Hmgcs1, and Casr were subject to epigenetic regulation. Our analyses demonstrate that coordinate changes in histone modifications, mRNA levels, and metabolite profiles accompanied functional adaptations of clonal β-cells to lipotoxicity. It is highly likely that these changes are pathogenetic, accounting for loss of glucose responsiveness and perturbed insulin secretion.

Increases were seen in pathways for steroid biosynthesis, cell cycle, fatty acid metabolism, DNA replication, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids; decreases occurred in the aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis pathway. The activity of histone-modifying enzymes and histone modifications of differentially expressed genes were reversibly altered upon exposure to palmitate. Thus, Insig1, Lss, Peci, Idi1, Hmgcs1, and Casr were subject to epigenetic regulation. Our analyses demonstrate that coordinate changes in histone modifications, mRNA levels, and metabolite profiles accompanied functional adaptations of clonal β-cells to lipotoxicity. It is highly likely that these changes are pathogenetic, accounting for loss of glucose responsiveness and perturbed insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2046855348,"TGF-β plays an important role in breast cancer progression as a prometastatic factor, notably through enhancement of cell migration. It is becoming clear that microRNAs, a new class of small regulatory molecules, also play crucial roles in mediating tumor formation and progression. We found TGF-β to down-regulate the expression of the microRNA miR-584 in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we identified PHACTR1, an actin-binding protein, to be positively regulated by TGF-β in a miR-584-dependent manner. Moreover, we found TGF-β-mediated down-regulation of miR-584 and increased expression of PHACTR1 to be required for TGF-β-induced cell migration of breast cancer cells. Indeed, both overexpression of miR-584 and knockdown of PHACTR1 resulted in a drastic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and reduced TGF-β-induced cell migration. Our data highlight a novel signaling route whereby TGF-β silences the expression of miR-584, resulting in enhanced PHACTR1 expression, and further leading to actin rearrangement and breast cancer cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2128795927,"Bacteria expressing a plant siRNA-binding protein produce potent, specific and nonimmunogenic siRNAs capable of knocking down target genes in mammalian cells. Synthetic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are an indispensable tool to investigate gene function in eukaryotic cells1,2 and may be used for therapeutic purposes to knock down genes implicated in disease3. Thus far, most synthetic siRNAs have been produced by chemical synthesis. Here we present a method to produce highly potent siRNAs in Escherichia coli. This method relies on ectopic expression of p19, an siRNA-binding protein found in a plant RNA virus4,5. When expressed in E. coli, p19 stabilizes an ∼21-nt siRNA-like species produced by bacterial RNase III. When mammalian cells are transfected by them, siRNAs that were generated in bacteria expressing p19 and a hairpin RNA encoding 200 or more nucleotides of a target gene reproducibly knock down target gene expression by ∼90% without immunogenicity or off-target effects. Because bacterially produced siRNAs contain multiple sequences against a target gene, they may be especially useful for suppressing polymorphic cellular or viral genes."
https://openalex.org/W2090858556,"Arrestin-1 selectively binds active phosphorylated rhodopsin (P-Rh*), demonstrating much lower affinity for inactive phosphorylated (P-Rh) and unphosphorylated active (Rh*) forms. Receptor interaction induces significant conformational changes in arrestin-1, which include large movement of the previously neglected 139-loop in the center of the receptor binding surface, away from the incoming receptor. To elucidate the functional role of this loop, in mouse arrestin-1 we introduced deletions of variable lengths and made several substitutions of Lys-142 in it and Asp-72 in the adjacent loop. Several mutants with perturbations in the 139-loop demonstrate increased binding to P-Rh*, dark P-Rh, Rh*, and phospho-opsin. Enhanced binding of arrestin-1 mutants to non-preferred forms of rhodopsin correlates with decreased thermal stability. The 139-loop perturbations increase P-Rh* binding of arrestin-1 at low temperatures and further change its binding profile on the background of 3A mutant, where the C-tail is detached from the body of the molecule by triple alanine substitution. Thus, the 139-loop stabilizes basal conformation of arrestin-1 and acts as a brake, preventing its binding to non-preferred forms of rhodopsin. Conservation of this loop in other subtypes suggests that it has the same function in all members of the arrestin family."

Recent research has shown that the cellular action and metabolism of SNOs and H2O2 involve overlapping, thiol-based mechanisms, but how these reactive species may affect each other's fate and function is not well understood. In this study we investigated how NO/SNO may affect the redox cycle of mammalian peroxiredoxin-1 (Prx1), a representative of the 2-Cys Prxs, a group of thioredoxin (Trx)-dependent peroxidases. We found that, both in a cell-free system and in cells, NO/SNO donors such as S-nitrosocysteine and S-nitrosoglutathione readily induced the S-nitrosylation of Prx1, causing structural and functional alterations. In particular, nitrosylation promoted disulfide formation involving the pair of catalytic cysteines (Cys-52 and Cys-173) and disrupted the oligomeric structure of Prx1, leading to loss of peroxidase activity. A highly potent inhibition of the peroxidase catalytic reaction by NO/SNO was seen in assays employing the coupled Prx-Trx system. In this setting, S-nitrosocysteine (10 μm) effectively blocked the Trx-mediated regeneration of oxidized Prx1. This effect appeared to be due to both competition between S-nitrosocysteine and Prx1 for the Trx system and direct modulation by S-nitrosocysteine of Trx reductase activity. Our findings that NO/SNO target both Prx and Trx reductase may have implications for understanding the impact of nitrosylation on cellular redox homeostasis.

https://openalex.org/W2137218555,"A decline in α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC) activity has been associated with neurodegeneration. Provision of succinyl-CoA by KGDHC is essential for generation of matrix ATP (or GTP) by substrate-level phosphorylation catalyzed by succinyl-CoA ligase. Here, we demonstrate ATP consumption in respiration-impaired isolated and in situ neuronal somal mitochondria from transgenic mice with a deficiency of either dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase (DLST) or dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (DLD) that exhibit a 20–48% decrease in KGDHC activity. Import of ATP into the mitochondrial matrix of transgenic mice was attributed to a shift in the reversal potential of the adenine nucleotide translocase toward more negative values due to diminished matrix substrate-level phosphorylation, which causes the translocase to reverse prematurely. Immunoreactivity of all three subunits of succinyl-CoA ligase and maximal enzymatic activity were unaffected in transgenic mice as compared to wild-type littermates. Therefore, decreased matrix substrate-level phosphorylation was due to diminished provision of succinyl-CoA. These results were corroborated further by the finding that mitochondria from wild-type mice respiring on substrates supporting substrate-level phosphorylation exhibited ~30% higher ADP-ATP exchange rates compared to those obtained from DLST+/– or DLD+/– littermates. We propose that KGDHC-associated pathologies are a consequence of the inability of respiration-impaired mitochondria to rely on “in-house” mitochondrial ATP reserves.—Kiss, G., Konrad, C., Doczi, J., Starkov, A.

https://openalex.org/W2012504595,"The CXCL1/CXCR2 axis plays a crucial role in recruiting neutrophils in response to microbial infection and tissue injury, and dysfunction in this process has been implicated in various inflammatory diseases. Chemokines exist as monomers and dimers, and compelling evidence now exists that both forms regulate in vivo function. Therefore, knowledge of the receptor activities of both CXCL1 monomer and dimer is essential to describe the molecular mechanisms by which they orchestrate neutrophil function. The monomer-dimer equilibrium constant (~20 μm) and the CXCR2 binding constant (1 nm) indicate that WT CXCL1 is active as a monomer. To characterize dimer activity, we generated a trapped dimer by introducing a disulfide across the dimer interface. This disulfide-linked CXCL1 dimer binds CXCR2 with nanomolar affinity and shows potent agonist activity in various cellular assays. We also compared the receptor binding mechanism of this dimer with that of a CXCL1 monomer, generated by deleting the C-terminal residues that stabilize the dimer interface. We observe that the binding interactions of the dimer and monomer to the CXCR2 N-terminal domain, which plays an important role in determining affinity and activity, are essentially conserved. The potent activity of the CXCL1 dimer is novel: dimers of the CC chemokines CCL2 and CCL4 are inactive, and the dimer of the CXC chemokine CXCL8 (which is closely related to CXCL1) is marginally active for CXCR1 but shows variable activity for CXCR2. We conclude that large differences in dimer activity among different chemokine-receptor pairs have evolved for fine-tuned leukocyte function."
https://openalex.org/W2043781624,"Human milk oligosaccharides contain a large variety of oligosaccharides, of which lacto-N-biose I (Gal-β1,3-GlcNAc; LNB) predominates as a major core structure. A unique metabolic pathway specific for LNB has recently been identified in the human commensal bifidobacteria. Several strains of infant gut-associated bifidobacteria possess lacto-N-biosidase, a membrane-anchored extracellular enzyme, that liberates LNB from the nonreducing end of human milk oligosaccharides and plays a key role in the metabolic pathway of these compounds. Lacto-N-biosidase belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family 20, and its reaction proceeds via a substrate-assisted catalytic mechanism. Several crystal structures of GH20 β-N-acetylhexosaminidases, which release monosaccharide GlcNAc from its substrate, have been determined, but to date, a structure of lacto-N-biosidase is unknown. Here, we have determined the first three-dimensional structures of lacto-N-biosidase from Bifidobacterium bifidum JCM1254 in complex with LNB and LNB-thiazoline (Gal-β1,3-GlcNAc-thiazoline) at 1.8-Å resolution. Lacto-N-biosidase consists of three domains, and the C-terminal domain has a unique β-trefoil-like fold. Compared with other β-N-acetylhexosaminidases, lacto-N-biosidase has a wide substrate-binding pocket with a -2 subsite specific for β-1,3-linked Gal, and the residues responsible for Gal recognition were identified. The bound ligands are recognized by extensive hydrogen bonds at all of their hydroxyls consistent with the enzyme's strict substrate specificity for the LNB moiety. The GlcNAc sugar ring of LNB is in a distorted conformation near (4)E, whereas that of LNB-thiazoline is in a (4)C1 conformation. A possible conformational pathway for the lacto-N-biosidase reaction is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2031033821,"Protein kinase C δ (PKCδ) regulates apoptosis in the mammary gland, however, the functional contribution of PKCδ to the development or progression of breast cancer has yet to be determined. Meta-analysis of ErbB2-positive breast cancers shows increased PKCδ expression, and a negative correlation between PKCδ expression and prognosis. Here, we present in-vivo evidence that PKCδ is essential for the development of mammary gland tumors in a ErbB2-overexpressing transgenic mouse model, and in-vitro evidence that PKCδ is required for proliferative signaling downstream of the ErbB2 receptor. Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-ErbB2 mice lacking PKCδ (δKO) have increased tumor latency compared with MMTV-ErbB2 wild-type (δWT) mice, and the tumors show a dramatic decrease in Ki-67 staining. To explore the relationship between PKCδ and ErbB2-driven proliferation more directly, we used MCF-10A cells engineered to express a synthetic ligand-inducible form of the ErbB2 receptor. Depletion of PKCδ with short hairpin RNA inhibited ligand-induced growth in both two-dimensional (2D) (plastic) and three-dimensional (3D) (Matrigel) culture, and correlated with decreased phosphorylation of the ErbB2 receptor and reduced activation of Src and MAPK/ERK pathways. Similarly, in human breast cancer cell lines in which ErbB2 is overexpressed, depletion of PKCδ suppresses proliferation, Src and ERK activation. PKCδ appears to drive proliferation through the formation of an active ErbB2/PKCδ/Src signaling complex, as depletion of PKCδ disrupts association of Src with the ErbB2 receptor. Taken together, our studies present the first evidence that PKCδ is a critical regulator of ErbB2-mediated tumorigenesis, and suggest further investigation of PKCδ as a target in ErbB2-positive breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2040268901,"Identification of new anti-apoptotic genes is important for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying apoptosis and tumorigenesis. The present study identified a novel anti-apoptotic gene named AREL1, which encodes a HECT (homologous to E6-AP carboxyl terminus) family E3 ubiquitin ligase. AREL1 interacted with and ubiquitinated IAP antagonists such as SMAC, HtrA2, and ARTS. However, AREL1 was cytosolic and did not localize to nuclei or mitochondria. The interactions between AREL1 and the IAP antagonists were specific for apoptosis-stimulated cells, in which the IAP antagonists were released into the cytosol from mitochondria. Furthermore, the ubiquitination and degradation of SMAC, HtrA2, and ARTS were significantly enhanced in AREL1-expressing cells following apoptotic stimulation, indicating that AREL1 binds to and ubiquitinates cytosolic but not mitochondria-associated forms of IAP antagonists. Furthermore, the anti-apoptotic role of AREL1-mediated degradation of SMAC, HtrA2, and ARTS was shown by simultaneous knockdown of three IAP antagonists, which caused the inhibition of caspase-3 cleavage, XIAP degradation, and induction of apoptosis. Therefore, the present study suggests that AREL1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of cytosolic forms of three IAP antagonists plays an important role in the regulation of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1968991669,"Retinal ganglion cells react to changes in visual contrast by adjusting their sensitivity and temporal filtering characteristics. This contrast adaptation has primarily been studied under spatially homogeneous stimulation. Yet, ganglion cell receptive fields are often characterized by spatial subfields, providing a substrate for nonlinear spatial processing. This raises the question whether contrast adaptation follows a similar subfield structure or whether it occurs globally over the receptive field even for local stimulation. We therefore recorded ganglion cell activity in isolated salamander retinas while locally changing visual contrast. Ganglion cells showed primarily global adaptation characteristics, with notable exceptions in certain aspects of temporal filtering. Surprisingly, some changes in filtering were most pronounced for locations where contrast did not change. This seemingly paradoxical effect can be explained by a simple computational model, which emphasizes the importance of local nonlinearities in the retina and suggests a reevaluation of previously reported local contrast adaptation."

Defects in genes encoding these hydrolytic enzymes are considered inviable, although their exact nature has not been studied at the cellular and molecular physiology levels. Using a conditional mutant in IPP1, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene encoding the cytosolic soluble pyrophosphatase, we show that respiring cells arrest in S phase upon Ipp1p deficiency, but they remain viable and resume growth if accumulated pyrophosphate is removed. However, fermenting cells arrest in G1/G0 phase and suffer massive vacuolization and eventual cell death by autophagy. Impaired NAD(+) metabolism is a major determinant of cell death in this scenario because demise can be avoided under conditions favoring accumulation of the oxidized pyridine coenzyme. These results posit that the mechanisms related to excess pyrophosphate toxicity in eukaryotes are dependent on the energy metabolism of the cell."

Aspergillus terreus expresses linoleate 9R-dioxygenase (9R-DOX) and allene oxide synthase (AOS) activities in membrane fractions. The genome contains five genes (ATEG), which may code for a 9R-DOX-AOS fusion protein. The genes were cloned and expressed, but none of them oxidized 18:2n-6 to 9R-hydroperoxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (9R-HPODE). ATEG_02036 transformed 9R-HPODE to an unstable allene oxide, 9(R),10-epoxy-10,12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid. A substitution in the P450 domain (C1073S) abolished AOS activity. The N964V and N964D mutants both showed markedly reduced AOS activity, suggesting that Asn(964) may facilitate homolytic cleavage of the dioxygen bond of 9R-HPODE with formation of compound II in analogy with plant AOS (CYP74) and prostacyclin synthase (CYP8A1). ATEG_03992 was identified as 5,8-linoleate diol synthase (5,8-LDS). Replacement of Asn(878) in 5,8-LDS with leucine (N878L) mainly shifted ferryl oxygen insertion from C-5 toward C-6, but replacements of Gln(881) markedly affected catalysis. The Q881L mutant virtually abolished the diol synthase activity. Replacement of Gln(881) with Asn, Glu, Asp, or Lys residues augmented the homolytic cleavage of 8R-HPODE with formation of 10-hydroxy-8(9)-epoxy-12(Z)-octadecenoic acid (erythro/threo, 1-4:1) and/or shifted ferryl oxygen insertion from C-5 toward C-11. We conclude that homolysis and heterolysis of the dioxygen bond with formation of compound II in AOS and compound I in 5,8-LDS are influenced by Asn and Gln residues, respectively, of the I-helices. AOS of A. terreus appears to have evolved independently of CYP74 but with an analogous reaction mechanism."

How the pyrin inflammasome is activated in the absence of disease-associated mutations is not yet known. We report here that ribotoxic stress triggers the assembly of the human pyrin inflammasome, leading to ASC oligomerization and caspase-1 activation in THP-1 macrophages and in a 293T cell line stably reconstituted with components of the pyrin inflammasome. Knockdown of pyrin and selective inhibition of p38 MAPK greatly attenuated caspase-1 activation by ribotoxic stress, whereas expression of the conditional mutant ΔMEKK3:ER* allowed the activation of caspase-1 without ribotoxic stress. Disruption of microtubules by colchicine also inhibited pyrin inflammasome activation by ribotoxic stress.

The proteins are localized to membranes of intracellular Ca(2+) stores and play pivotal roles in Ca(2+) homeostasis. Previous studies have demonstrated that IP3R1 is cleaved by the intracellular proteases calpain and caspase both in vivo and in vitro. However, the resultant cleavage products are poorly defined, and the functional consequences of these proteolytic events are not fully understood. We demonstrate that IP3R1 is cleaved during staurosporine-induced apoptosis, yielding N-terminal fragments encompassing the ligand-binding domain and the majority of the central modulatory domain together with a C-terminal fragment containing the channel domain and cytosolic tail. Notably, these fragments remain associated with the membrane after initiation of apoptotic cleavage. Furthermore, when recombinant IP3R1 fragments, corresponding to those predicted to be generated by caspase or calpain cleavage, are stably coexpressed in cells, they physically associate and form functional channels. These data provide novel insights regarding the regulation of IP3R1 during proteolysis and provide direct evidence that polypeptide continuity is not required for IP3R activation and Ca(2+) release."

Sisodia S.S. Evidence that synaptically released β-amyloid accumulates as extracellular deposits in the hippocampus of transgenic mice.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9785-9793Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and undergoes synaptic regulation by Aβ (4Puzzo D. Privitera L. Fa' M. Staniszewski A. Hashimoto G. Aziz F. Sakurai M. Ribe E.M. Troy C.M. Mercken M. Jung S.S. Palmeri A. Arancio O. Endogenous amyloid-β is necessary for hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory.Ann. Neurol. 2011; 69: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Aβ thus appears to be localized to the synapse at concentrations that regulate presynaptic dynamics. Among an array of different targets at synapses to which Aβ might bind and exert downstream effects, those of notable significance are neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (9Patel A.N. Jhamandas J.H. Neuronal receptors as targets for the action of amyloid-β protein (Aβ) in the brain.Expert Rev. Mol. Med. 2012; 14: e2Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The nAChRs play important modulatory roles in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity, participating in cognitive functions such as learning, memory, and attention (10Dani J.A. Bertrand D. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and nicotinic cholinergic mechanisms of the central nervous system.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2007; 47: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). The most abundant high affinity nAChR in brain is comprised of α4 and β2 subunits, whereas the other major nAChR subtype in brain contains α7 subunits (11McGehee D.S. Role L.W. Physiological diversity of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors expressed by vertebrate neurons.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 521-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Activation of α7-nAChRs produces a rapid, sharp increase in the intracellular Ca2+ signal, whereas α4β2-nAChRs cause a more delayed but long-lasting signal (11McGehee D.S. Role L.W. Physiological diversity of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors expressed by vertebrate neurons.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 521-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Aβ activation of different nAChR subtypes will therefore have different impacts on intracellular Ca2+ and hence synaptic signaling. Acute application of pico- to nanomolar Aβ evokes increases in Ca2+ and neurotransmitter release via presynaptic nAChRs (12Dougherty J.J. Wu J.

Mutation of a key tyrosine residue in the agonist-binding site of α7 nAChRs eliminates the Aβ effect on presynaptic Ca2+ (15Tong M. Arora K. White M.M. Nichols R.A.

Chem. 2011; 286: 34373-34381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), directly confirming the agonist-like action of Aβ. At picomolar concentrations, acute Aβ was also found to enhance long-term potentiation and contextual memory in a manner dependent upon presynaptic nAChRs (3Puzzo D. Privitera L. Leznik E. Fà M.

The high-affinity α4β2 nAChRs are significantly up-regulated in animals chronically treated with nicotine on a daily dose basis (16Flores C.M. Rogers S.W. Pabreza L.A. Wolfe B.B. Kellar K.J.

This nicotine-induced up-regulation has been further characterized in a variety of systems ranging from clonal cell lines to primary neurons in culture to mouse models to smokers' brains (18Peng X.

Up-regulation of α4β2 nAChRs may sensitize cellular targets to the action of nicotine. Regulation of receptor expression also depends on steady-state control via endocytosis and membrane recycling, along with degradation via lysosomes. Changes in AMPA-type glutamate receptor expression in postsynaptic membranes in the context of synaptic plasticity, for example, have been shown to involve changes in receptor recycling. Rab proteins, members of the Ras family of small GTPases, have been shown to play a key role at various steps in endocytic, recycling, and degradative pathways. Specifically, Rab5 expression levels are higher in plasma membrane, recycling endosomes, and clathrin-coated pits (27Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M.

Rab11 is mainly found in the trans-Golgi network and recycling endosomes (29Sönnichsen B. De Renzis S. Nielsen E. Rietdorf J. Zerial M.

Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2701) Google Scholar) from where it regulates trafficking of proteins to the plasma membrane. The extent to which nAChRs are regulated by these processes in response to sustained agonist exposure remains to be determined. An important downstream consequence of Aβ pathology is mitochondrial toxicity (31Tillement L. Lecanu L. Papadopoulos V. Alzheimer's disease. Effects of β-amyloid on mitochondria.Mitochondrion. 2011; 11: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As synapses are high energy demanding sites, mitochondria play critical roles in maintaining synaptic function, and mitochondria toxicity likely contributes to synaptic loss in AD (32Thies E. Mandelkow E.M. Missorting of tau in neurons causes degeneration of synapses that can be rescued by the kinase MARK2/Par-1.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2896-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). It has been reported that brains of AD patients show ultrastructural alterations in mitochondrial morphology, such as reduced number, increased size, and broken internal membrane cristae (33Hirai K. Aliev G. Nunomura A. Fujioka H. Russell R.L. Atwood C.S. Johnson A.B. Kress Y. Vinters H.V. Tabaton M. Shimohama S. Cash A.D. Siedlak S.L. Harris P.L. Jones P.K. Petersen R.B. Perry G. Smith M.A. Mitochondrial abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3017-3023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aβ may also affect mitochondrial dynamics (fission/fusion equilibrium) and distribution in the axon and synapse. Recent studies using an in vivo fly model overexpressing Aβ showed that depletion of presynaptic and axonal mitochondria was one of the earliest detectable deficits, preceding Aβ-induced presynaptic deficits in motor function (34Iijima-Ando K. Hearn S.A. Shenton C. Gatt A. Zhao L. Mitochondrial mislocalization underlies Aβ42-induced neuronal dysfunction in a Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e8310Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 35Zhao X.L. Wang W.A. Tan J.X. Huang J.K. Zhang X. Zhang B.Z. Wang Y.H. YangCheng H.Y. Zhu H.L. Sun X.J. Huang F.D. Expression of β-amyloid induced age-dependent presynaptic and axonal changes in Drosophila.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 1512-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Aβ-induced mitochondrial mislocalization was also confirmed in hippocampal neurons (36Zempel H. Thies E. Mandelkow E. Mandelkow E.M. Aβ oligomers cause localized Ca2+ elevation, missorting of endogenous tau into dendrites, tau phosphorylation, and destruction of microtubules and spines.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 11938-11950Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Such mitochondrial trafficking disruption in AD could potentially compromise normal synaptic function. However, it is still not clear what role presynaptic receptors play in mitotoxicity induced by Aβ at the synapse. Here, we addressed the impact of sustained exposure to Aβ on a model neuronal system expressing exogenous α4β2 nAChRs on [Ca2+]i, receptor regulation, axonal mitochondrial dynamics, oxidative stress, nuclear and cellular integrity, and endocytosis/recycling. The results suggest that the presence of α4β2 nAChRs may sensitize neurons to the effects of sustained exposure to Aβ. NG108-15 hybrid neuroblastoma cells were plated on Cell-Tak-coated coverslips (Warner) in 35-mm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (37Khan G.M.

Neurosci. 2010; 31: 788-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The cells were induced to differentiate in media containing 1% FBS and 1 mm cyclic AMP for 48–72 h, elaborating long neurites with varicosities. These varicosities display features found for presynaptic elements in the brain, like voltage-gated calcium channels (38Lukyanetz E.A. Diversity and properties of calcium channel types in NG108015 hybrid cells.Neuroscience. 1998; 87: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), ER-based Ca2+ stores, vesicles, mitochondria, and synaptic proteins (39Fried G. Han H.Q. Increase in synaptic vesicle proteins in synapsin-transfected NG108-15 cells.

As they do not express functional nAChRs themselves, mouse sequences for α4 and β2 nAChR subunits housed in pcDNA3.1 expression vectors (courtesy of Dr. Jerry Stitzel, University of Colorado) were transiently transfected at a ratio of 1:4, respectively, into differentiated NG108-15 cells using FuGENE HD, a lipid-based transfection reagent, for 48 h. This ratio was found to yield maximal expression of functional receptors. Mock-transfected NG108-15 cells, containing only FuGENE HD and no plasmid DNA were used as controls. To measure changes in Ca2+ levels in individual varicosities, the transfected, differentiated cells were loaded for 40 min at 37 °C with fluorescent Ca2+ indicator dye Fluo-4/AM (Invitrogen) at 5 μm in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS: containing (in mm) 10 HEPES, 142 NaCl, 2.4 KCl, 1.2 K2PO4, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 5 d-glucose, and 100 nm tetrodotoxin, pH 7.4, saturated with O2) in preparation for confocal imaging, as described (41Nichols R.A. Dengler A.F. Nakagawa E.M. Bashkin M. Paul B.T. Wu J. Khan G.M. A constitutive, transient receptor potential-like Ca2+ influx pathway in presynaptic nerve endings independent of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and Na+/Ca2+ exchange.J. Biol.

Cells were mounted in a rapid-exchange Warner open perfusion chamber for confocal imaging using a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal imaging system (excitation: 488 nm; emission: 515–565 nm band-pass; ×40/1.3 NA epifluorescence, oil-immersion Plan-Neofluar objective). Imaging was started and after obtaining a baseline series of four images, reagents (agonists; antagonists) were applied by rapid switching via a Warner six-channel valve-controlled perfusion system (VC-66CS, Warner Instruments) using DN series constant flow reservoirs. Image series consisted of a time course of 200–400 s (typically to the peak of the response). For each run, a minimum of four to eight varicosities in each successive image were selected as regions of interest and their associated fluorescence intensities were determined for all 30 frames using ImageJ. Time series responses were normalized to baseline, corrected for photobleaching, and presented as F/F0. Cell cultures were fixed with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in HBS at room temperature for 30 min and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min. The cultures were then incubated in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 10% normal goat serum for 30 min to block nonspecific binding. Affinity-purified antibodies (1:200) were then added to the cultures and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The cultures were then washed with 10% goat serum in TBS for 30 min, and incubated with the FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (IgGs, typically at 1:500) for 30 min at room temperature. The coverslips were finally washed with 10% normal goat serum and TBS, plated onto glass microscope slides, and sealed for imaging via confocal microscopy. To detect the mitochondrial fission protein Drp-1 (dynamin-related protein-1) and the Rab proteins, cells were permeabilized before incubation with blocking buffer. For Drp-1, cells were then co-stained with rabbit anti-phospho-Drp-1 and mouse anti-Drp-1. Anti-rabbit Alexa-488 and anti-mouse Alexa-633 were used as secondary antibodies, respectively. The immunostained preparations were subsequently visualized using a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal confocal imaging system on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope with appropriate fluorescence filters via a ×40 Plan-Neofluar objective. Immunostaining for the α4 and β2 nAChR subunits was visualized on a Nikon Cameleon AOTF confocal microscopic system via a ×40 objective. The Image iT live Reactive Oxygen Species Detection kit (Invitrogen) was used to determine the extent of oxidative stress in response to daily treatment with Aβ1–42 in NG108-15 cells transfected with α4β2-nAChRs as compared with mock-transfected (control) cells, exchanging the culture medium each day. After treatment, the cells were rinsed with warm HBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ and incubated with carboxy-H2DCFDA (component A) at 37 °C for 30 min. During the last 5 min of incubation, 2 μg/ml of Hoechst stain (component B) was added. The cells were washed twice with HBS and visualized using an Olympus IX71 epifluorescence microscope at excitation/emission of 495/529 nm (ROS) and 350/461 nm (Hoechst), respectively, linked to a Macrofire camera. Differentiated NG108-15 cells transfected with α4β2-nAChRs were treated daily with Aβ1–42 or not (control) for 3 days, exchanging the culture medium each day. On day 3, the cells were incubated with BacMam Mito-RFP reagent (Invitrogen) for another 16 h to label the mitochondria. The cells were then washed for 30 min and imaged for the live movement of individual RFP-labeled mitochondria in the axonal neurites. A total of 30 images were recorded over a period of 720 s using confocal imaging (see previous methods) under standardized settings. Using Image J, the x and y coordinates of each individual mitochondrion were measured to determine the relative distance traversed by that particular mitochondrion along a given neurite. In addition, the size of individual mitochondria was determined (diameter in pixels) across the 3-day time course. Mock-transfected cells were used as separate controls. Differentiated NG108-15 cells transfected with α4β2-nAChRs and treated (or not) with Aβ1–42 daily for 3 days, exchanging the culture medium each day, were surface labeled at 4 °C using a cleavable biotinylation reagent from the Pierce Cell Surface Protein Isolation kit (Thermo Scientific). After various treatment conditions, the cells were lysed using the lysis reagent and the biotinylated proteins were pulled down using NeutrAvidin-agarose beads. These were then mixed with SDS sample buffer and loaded onto 4–20% Tris-HCl gels, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed for α4-nAChR subunits using a highly specific rat monoclonal (299) antibody. Total RNA was isolated from mock-transfected and α4β2-nAChR-transfected cells treated daily for 3 days with Aβ1–42 or not (untreated), exchanging the culture medium each day, using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The total RNA was reverse transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems), following the manufacturer's instructions, and quantitative real-time PCR was performed according to standard protocols. For data analysis, 18S rRNA was used as an endogenous control. Data are expressed as relative expression for each individual gene normalized to their corresponding controls. The following primer sequences were used for amplification of the mouse α4-nAChR cDNA (NM015730, GenBankTM) at an annealing temperature of 61 °C: forward, 5′-ACTTTGCAGTCACCCACCTAACCAAA-3′; reverse, 5′-ATGAGCAGCAGAAGACGGTGAGAGAAA-3′. This yielded a 481-bp PCR product. NG108-15 cells were seeded on coverslips in 24-well plates (6 × 104 cells/well). Cells were either mock- or α4β2-nAChR transfected as previously described (Cell Culture). After transfection, cells were treated daily with Aβ1–42 or Aβ42–1 (control peptide) for 5 days, exchanging the culture medium each day. The TUNEL assay was performed using Click-iT® TUNEL Alexa Fluor® Imaging Kit (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, cell cultures were fixed with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 20 min and permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.25% in PBS) for another 20 min. The cultures were then washed twice and incubated with 50 μl of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase reaction buffer (Component A) for 10 min at room temperature. The buffer was removed and the TUNEL reaction mixture containing terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase was added, incubating the cultures in a humidified chamber at 37 °C for 60 min. After treatment, cells were washed three times with 3% BSA in PBS for 2 min each and then incubated with 50 μl of Click-iT reaction mixture (containing Alexa 488 azide) for 30 min at room temperature, while being protected from light exposure. The cells were again washed with 3% BSA in PBS and the cell nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 for 15 min at room temperature, protected from light. The coverslips were washed twice with PBS before mounting onto a slide with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Negative and positive controls were included in each experiment. For the negative control, cells were processed using a reaction mixture that did not contain terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. For the positive control, cells were incubated with DNase I (3 units/ml) for 30 min to induce DNA strand breaks. Labeled nuclei were detected by fluorescence microscopy on a Zeiss Pascal confocal imaging system on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope, equipped with appropriate fluorescence filters and objectives. The TUNEL-positive cells were counted in eight different, random fields for each well. Aβ1–42 and the control reverse peptide Aβ42–1 were purchased from American Peptide. A stock solution of the peptides were prepared at 0.1 mm by dissolving solid peptide in double deionized water (see Ref. 37Khan G.M. Tong M. J"

The molecular mechanisms that regulate Ras/PKA-mediated signaling remain to be fully understood. Here, we provide evidence that Ras/PKA signaling is negatively regulated by a deubiquitinating enzyme, Ubp3. Disrupting the activity of Ubp3 leads to hyperactivation of PKA, as evidenced by much enhanced phosphorylation of PKA substrates, decreased accumulation of glycogen, larger cell size, and increased sensitivity to heat shock. Levels of intracellular cAMP and the active forms of Ras proteins are also elevated in the ubp3Δ mutant. Consistent with a possibility that the increased cAMP is responsible for the abnormal signaling behavior of the ubp3Δ mutant, overexpressing PDE2, which encodes a phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes cAMP, significantly relieves the cell size increase and heat shock sensitivity of the mutant. Further analysis reveals that Ubp3 interacts with a Ras GTPase-accelerating protein, Ira2, and regulates its level of ubiquitination.

Linezolid, vancomycin, and clindamycin are antibiotics used for MRSA infections. Linezolid has immunomodulatory properties. We report on the effects of the three antibiotics on microbial clearance, pulmonary cytokines and clinical course in a murine model of influenza and MRSA coinfection.B6 mice were infected with influenza A virus and 3 days later with MRSA, both intranasally. Treatment with placebo, linezolid, vancomycin or clindamycin started immediately after MRSA infection and continued for 72 hours. Bacterial and viral titers as well as cytokine concentrations in the lungs were assessed 4 and 24 hours after MRSA coinfection. Mice were weighted daily for 13 days.Coinfected mice had increased pulmonary IL-1β, TNF-α and mKC at 4 and 24 hours, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12 at 4 hours and IFN-γ at 24 hours after MRSA coinfection (all P<0.05). Compared to placebo, coinfected mice treated with linezolid, vancomycin or clindamycin had decreased pulmonary IL-6 and mKC at 4 hours and IFN-γ at 24 hours after MRSA coinfection (all P<0.05). IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-12 were similar in antibiotic-treated and placebo groups. All antibiotics similarly reduced MRSA without effect on influenza titers. Linezolid-treated mice had less weight loss on days 4-6 after influenza infection compared to placebo (all P<0.05). On all other days weight change was similar among all groups.This is the first report comparing the effects of antibiotics on cytokines and clinical outcome in a murine model of influenza and MRSA coinfection. Compared to placebo, antibiotic treatment reduced maximum concentration of IL-6, mKC and IFN-γ in the lungs without any difference among antibiotics. During treatment, only linezolid delayed weight loss compared to placebo."
https://openalex.org/W2138494373,"Novel-type serine-synthesizing enzymes, termed metal-independent phosphoserine phosphatases (iPSPs), were recently identified and characterized from Hydrogenobacter thermophilus, a chemolithoautotrophic bacterium belonging to the order Aquificales. iPSPs are cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase (dPGM)-like phosphatases that have significant amino acid sequence similarity to dPGMs but lack phosphoglycerate mutase activity. Genes coding dPGM-like phosphatases have been identified in a broad range of organisms; however, predicting the function of the corresponding proteins based on sequence information alone is difficult due to their diverse substrate preferences. Here, we determined the crystal structure of iPSP1 from H. thermophilus in the apo-form and in complex with its substrate L-phosphoserine to find structural units important for its phosphatase activity toward L-phosphoserine. Structural and biochemical characterization of iPSP1 revealed that the side chains of His(85) and C-terminal region characteristic of iPSP1 are responsible for the PSP activity. The importance of these structural units for PSP activity was confirmed by high PSP activity observed in two novel dPGM-like proteins from Cyanobacteria and Chloroflexus in which the two structural units were conserved. We anticipate that our present findings will facilitate understanding of the serine biosynthesis pathways of organisms that lack gene(s) encoding conventional PSPs, as the structural information revealed here will help to identify iPSP from sequence databases."
https://openalex.org/W2043743516,"The side population (SP) in human lung cancer cell lines and tumors is enriched with cancer stem cells. An endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis known as tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2), characterized for its ability to inhibit matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), has been shown by several laboratories to impede tumor progression through MMP-dependent or -independent mechanisms. We recently reported that forced expression of TIMP-2, as well as the modified form Ala+TIMP-2 (that lacks MMP inhibitory activity) significantly blocks growth of A549 human lung cancer cells in vivo. However, the mechanisms underlying TIMP-2 antitumor effects are not fully characterized. Here, we examine the hypothesis that the TIMP-2 antitumor activity may involve regulation of the SP in human lung cancer cells. Indeed, using Hoechst dye efflux assay and flow cytometry, as well as quantitative reverse transcriptase–PCR analysis, we found that endogenous TIMP-2 mRNA levels showed a significant inverse correlation with SP fraction size in six non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. In A549 cells expressing increased levels of TIMP-2, a significant decrease in SP was observed, and this decrease was associated with lowered gene expression of ABCG2, ABCB1 and AKR1C1. Functional analysis of A549 cells showed that TIMP-2 overexpression increased chemosensitivity to cytotoxic drugs. The SP isolated from TIMP-2-overexpressing A549 cells also demonstrated impaired migratory capacity compared with the SP from empty vector control. More importantly, our data provide strong evidence that these TIMP-2 functions occur independent of MMP inhibition, as A549 cells overexpressing Ala+TIMP-2 exhibited identical behavior to those overexpressing TIMP-2 alone. Our findings provide the first indication that TIMP-2 modulates SP phenotype and function, and suggests that TIMP-2 may act as an endogenous suppressor of the SP in human lung cancer cells."

Recently, we determined the low resolution structure of F from Saccharomyces cerevisiae V-ATPase, showing an N-terminal egg shape, connected to a C-terminal hook-like segment via a linker region. To understand the mechanistic role of subunit F of S. cerevisiae V-ATPase, composed of 118 amino acids, the crystal structure of the major part of F, F(1–94), was solved at 2.3 Å resolution. The structural features were confirmed by solution NMR spectroscopy using the entire F subunit. The eukaryotic F subunit consists of the N-terminal F(1–94) domain with four-parallel β-strands, which are intermittently surrounded by four α-helices, and the C terminus, including the α5-helix encompassing residues 103 to 113.Two loops 26GQITPETQEK35 and 60ERDDI64 are described to be essential in mechanistic processes of the V-ATPase enzyme. The 26GQITPETQEK35 loop becomes exposed when fitted into the recently determined EM structure of the yeast V1VO-ATPase.

The N- and C-terminal domains of H, which are assumed to be flexible, are connected by a four-residue loop (13Sagermann M. Stevens T.H. Matthews B.W.

Subunit H has been described to undergo a rearrangement during disassembly and moves in proximity to subunit F. This proximity is discussed in context with the role it plays to prevent F from rotation with subunit D and the subsequent drop in ATPase activity of the V1 sector (18Jefferies K.C. Forgac M.

Recently, the solution shape of subunit F of V-ATPase from S. cerevisiae (118 amino acids) has been described as a long egg-shaped protein connected to a hook-like segment via a linker region (22Basak S.

The comparison of the shape of the C-terminal truncated form of subunit F (F(1–94)) revealed that the hook-like region forms the very C terminus of subunit F (22Basak S. Gayen S. Thaker Y.R.

Here, we present the crystallographic structure of F(1–94) of the S. cerevisiae V1VO-ATPase at 2.3 Å resolution. The structure revealed an alternating arrangement of four-stranded β-sheets and four α-helices and an extended polar loop (26GQITPETQEK35) between α1–β2, discussed to be important in coupling. NMR spectroscopy has been used to further characterize the structural traits and dynamics of the full length F subunit. The data form a platform for a mechanistic model of subunits D and F as well as D and H interaction via the novel 26GQITPETQEK35 loop of subunit F of eukaryotic V-ATPases and the C-terminal domain of subunit H in V1, and its coupled effect in ATPase inhibition in the catalytic A3B3 headpiece. In addition, the key role of F in the subunit D, F, and d arrangement is described.

Finally, the verified plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Stratagene) for protein production. Cells were grown on 100 μg/ml carbenecillin-containing Luria-Bertani medium. The protein was induced by isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.8 mm at 37 °C. Cells were lysed on ice by sonication for 3 × 1 min in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm PMSF, and 2 mm PefablocSC (4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride) (BIOMOL)). Cell debris was separated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 35 min. The supernatant was then filtered (0.45 μm; Millipore) and allowed to bind with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid matrix, which was then eluted with an imidazole gradient (25–400 mm) in buffer A. Fractions containing the DF heterodimer were identified by SDS-PAGE (35Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of Structural Proteins during the Assembly of the Head of Bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar), pooled together, and diluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 to reduce the salt concentration to 50 mm and applied onto an anion exchange column (Resouce Q, 6 ml). The eluted protein was applied onto a gel filtration column (S200), which was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA. Purity and homogeneity of the protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (35Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of Structural Proteins during the Assembly of the Head of Bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). All NMR experiments were performed at 293 K on a 700 MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker Avance), equipped with 5-mm triple-resonance (1H/15N/13C) single axis gradient probes and a cryoprobe. 0.5 mm of recombinant subunit F was prepared in 50 mm Tris at pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 5% D2O. To assign the backbone of the F subunit, we have collected TROSY 4The abbreviation used is: TROSYtransverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy. -based experiments: two-dimensional 1H-15N TROSY-HSQC, three-dimensional TROSY-HNCO, three-dimensional TROSY-CBCA(CO)NH, and three-dimensional TROSY-HNCACB with improved signals (∼10–50% increase) unlike non-TROSY experiments, showing signal broadening for many residues. As the earlier small-angle x-ray scattering data at the same concentration confirmed the monomeric state of F subunit (22Basak S. Gayen S. Thaker Y.R. Manimekalai M.S. Roessle M. Hunke C. Grüber G.

Biophys Acta. 2011; 1808: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), the signal broadening is probably due to slow conformation exchange on the microsecond to millisecond time scale. To measure the heteronuclear steady-state NOEs, using NOE-TROSY in an interleaved mode (36Zhu G. Xia Y. Nicholson L.K. Sze K.H. Protein Dynamics Measurements by TROSY-Based NMR Experiments.J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 143: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), two spectra with and without proton saturation were measured. Proton presaturation was achieved by a train of 120° pulses spaced at 5 ms, for a 3-s period. In addition, a 3-s recycle delay was employed in both experiments. 15N-[1H]NOE values were obtained from the ratio of signal intensities in the presence (Isat) and in the absence of proton saturation (Iunsat). Errors were estimated from the standard deviation of the NOE, σNOE/NOE=((σlsat/lsat)2+(σlunsat/lunsat)2)1/2(Eq. 1) where σIsat and σIunsat are their measured background noise levels (37Farrow N.A.

Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were carried out using a MicroCal iTC200 microcalorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, UK), to study the binding of DF complex and subunit F with subunit d of the S. cerevisiae V-ATPase. Purification of subunit d was done as described previously (40Thaker Y.R. Roessle M. Grüber G.

All of the proteins were prepared in common buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine to minimize the buffer dilution effect during experiments. Samples were centrifuged and degassed before injection. All of the experiments were performed using 40 μm of the DF heterodimer and subunit F titrated against 500 μm of subunit d at 293 K (see Fig. 4, A and B). Control experiment was done with ligand and buffer. The dissociation constant of the DF complex and subunit d was determined by least-squares method, and the binding isotherm was fitted using the in-built Origin program (version 7.0, MicroCal), assuming a single-site binding model. The high resolution crystal structures of individual subunits were fitted in the EM map of the S. cerevisiae V1VO-ATPase, which was determined at 11 Å (6Benlekbir S. Bueler S.A. Rubinstein J.L.

https://openalex.org/W2037725176,"The p53 pathway is inactivated in most human cancers, and its reactivation in tumors appears as a promising therapeutic strategy. Overexpression of Mdm4, a p53 negative regulator, occurs in a significant fraction of human cancers. Mouse models were used to evaluate the therapeutic potential of strategies against Mdm4, and encouraging results were obtained for tumor cells in which Mdm4 overexpression prevents wild-type p53 to exert its tumor suppressive functions. However, missense mutations in the p53 gene occur in about half of human cancers, and 15% of such mutations lead to the expression of a mutant protein that retains partial activity. In this report, we used mouse models to address the therapeutic potential of strategies against Mdm4 in tumors expressing an hypomorphic p53 mutant. We found that, in an Rb(+/-) background promoting pituitary and thyroid tumors, decreased Mdm4 levels improved the survival of mice expressing wild-type p53, but not that of mice expressing p53(ΔP), a p53 hypomorph lacking the proline-rich domain. Importantly, however, most Rb(+/-) p53(ΔP/ΔP) mice developped pituitary adenomas, but these tumors were rare in Rb(+/-) p53(ΔP/ΔP) Mdm4(-/-) animals, because Mdm4 loss led to increased p21 levels, a suppressor of pituitary tumor growth. On the contrary, Rb(+/-) p53(ΔP/ΔP) and Rb(+/-) p53(ΔP/ΔP) Mdm4(-/-) mice developped anaplastic thyroid carcinomas at equal frequencies. Importantly, wild-type p53 represses the Plk1 gene, which encodes a promising therapeutic target in anaplastic thyroid carcinomas, and this repression is improved when Mdm4 levels are decreased. On the opposite, p53(ΔP) is a mediocre transcriptional repressor that is not improved by Mdm4 loss. In sum, depending on the tumor type, strategies against Mdm4 that work in cells expressing wild-type p53 may not work in cells expressing an hypomorphic p53. Furthermore, p53-mediated transcriptional repression should be considered when evaluating strategies to reactivate p53 in tumors."

In this study, we have shown that this cleavage results in a 3′-OH end suitable for polyadenylation of the nascent transcript, corroborating a role for H5 in vaccinia transcription termination.

Vaccinia virus is the prototypical and best studied member of the poxvirus family. Members of this family are large (∼200 kb) double-stranded DNA viruses that replicate exclusively in the host cell cytoplasm and therefore encode all the enzymes and factors required for DNA and RNA metabolism (1Moss B. Poxviridae: the viruses and their replication.in: Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Wolters, Kluwer-Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia2007: 2906-2945Google Scholar). Viral transcription is regulated as a temporal cascade with three different classes of transcripts (early, intermediate, and late) (1Moss B.

Niles E.G. Regulation of viral transcription elongation and termination during vaccinia virus infection.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Transcription requires a multi-subunit RNA polymerase, several stage-specific transcription factors, and multi-subunit enzymes for cap formation and polyadenylation. Early transcription occurs before viral DNA replication and early gene products serve as factors for viral DNA replication and intermediate transcription. Intermediate and late transcription (collectively termed post-replicative) are coupled to viral DNA replication. Each stage of transcription employs different mechanisms of transcription termination. Early transcription termination requires a cis-acting sequence and several trans-acting factors yielding 5′ and 3′ co-terminal transcripts (3Shuman S. Broyles S.S. Moss B.

Post-replicative transcription termination results in heterogenous length transcripts, 1–4-kb-long, that are 5′ co-terminal (10Mahr A. Roberts B.E. Arrangement of late RNAs transcribed from a 7.1-kilobase EcoRI vaccinia virus DNA fragment.J. Virol. 1984; 49: 510-520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

However, a pyrimidine-rich sequence in the coding strand has been identified immediately preceding the 3′ ends of these post-replicative transcripts (14Yang Z. Martens C.A. Bruno D.P. Porcella S.F.

Viral DNA replication requires a viral DNA polymerase (E9), a heterodimeric processivity factor (A20 and D4), and several other accessory proteins (I3, D5, H5, B1, J2, F4/I4, G5, A22, A50, I6, and A32) that support viral DNA replication either directly or indirectly (1Moss B. Poxviridae: the viruses and their replication.in: Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Wolters, Kluwer-Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia2007: 2906-2945Google Scholar). Viral DNA replication, postreplicative transcription, and virion assembly take place in discrete cytoplasmic sites termed virus factories. Virion assembly and morphogenesis involves the formation of crescent shaped viral membrane structures within factories, followed by packaging of condensed viroplasm and DNA within the viral membranes to form spherical immature virions and immature virions with nucleoids. Proteolysis of major virion structural proteins and metamorphosis of the immature virions with nucleoids into mature virions is required before transport of the mature virions out of the factory. Several viral proteins are required for all of these events (15Condit R.C. Moussatche N. Traktman P. In a nutshell: structure and assembly of the vaccinia virion.Adv. Virus Res. 2006; 66: 31-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Ongoing investigations of poxvirus RNA metabolism, DNA replication, and virion morphogenesis have consistently highlighted a role for the vaccina H5 protein in all of these processes. H5 is absent from the entomopoxviruses but present in all chordopoxviruses. H5 is a constitutively expressed, 22.3-kDa phosphoprotein that is localized in viral factories and packaged into virions (16Domi A. Beaud G.

H5 is phosphorylated by both viral kinases (F10 and B1) and by cellular kinases; the pattern of its phosphorylation appears to be dynamic and temporally regulated (15Condit R.C. Moussatche N. Traktman P. In a nutshell: structure and assembly of the vaccinia virion.Adv. Virus Res. 2006; 66: 31-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 18Beaud G. Beaud R. Leader D.P. Vaccinia virus gene H5R encodes a protein that is phosphorylated by the multisubstrate vaccinia virus B1R protein kinase.J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1819-1826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the native molecular mass of the H5 polypeptide based on its amino acid sequence is only 22 kDa, this protein behaves aberrantly in several biochemical estimations of molecular weight, suggesting that it may exhibit transient polymorphic structures. H5 fractionates on SDS-PAGE at 35 kDa; this anomaly has been attributed to a rigid amphipathic helix located in the C terminus of the protein and/or to a proline-rich domain in the N terminus capable of producing kinks in the protein structure (18Beaud G. Beaud R. Leader D.P. Vaccinia virus gene H5R encodes a protein that is phosphorylated by the multisubstrate vaccinia virus B1R protein kinase.J.

A prominent antigenic surface polypeptide involved in the biogenesis and function of the vaccinia virus envelope.Virology. 1991; 181: 671-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Another unusual characteristic of the purified protein is that it elutes from gel filtration columns with an extremely large apparent molecular mass (>400 kDa) regardless of the source of purified protein (vaccinia-expressed or Escherichia coli-expressed), suggesting multimerization of the protein and possibly an unusual shape/structure (22D'Costa S.M.

Chem. 2008; 283: 5267-5275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). There is substantial evidence to suggest that H5 is involved in viral DNA replication. H5 interacts with viral DNA replication enzymes A20, the viral DNA polymerase processivity factor and B1, the viral protein kinase that inhibits the host antiviral protein, BAF, during viral DNA replication (23McCraith S. Holtzman T. Moss B. Fields S. Genome-wide analysis of vaccinia virus protein-protein interactions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Role of vaccinia virus A20R protein in DNA replication: construction and characterization of temperature-sensitive mutants.J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1656-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A temperature-sensitive mutant (Dts57) that maps to the H5 gene has been characterized to have a block in viral DNA replication (DNA-negative) confirming a direct role for H5 in viral DNA replication (25D'Costa S.M. Bainbridge T.W. Kato S.E. Prins C. Kelley K. Condit R.C. Vaccinia H5 is a multifunctional protein involved in viral DNA replication, postreplicative gene transcription, and virion morphogenesis.Virology. 2010; 401: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition to playing a role in DNA replication, H5 has been shown to function in all aspects of post-replicative transcription: initiation, elongation, and termination. Kovacs and co-workers (20Kovacs G.R. Moss B. The vaccinia virus H5R gene encodes late gene transcription factor 4: purification, cloning, and overexpression.J.

Protein interactions among the vaccinia virus late transcription factors.Virology. 2004; 329: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have shown that this protein interacts with viral late transcription initiation (A2 and G8), elongation (G2), and termination (A18) factors. Importantly, an H5 mutant has been isolated that is resistant to isatin β-thiosemicarbazone, an antipoxvirus drug known to affect vaccinia postreplicative gene elongation, further cementing a role for H5 in postreplicative gene transcription (28Cresawn S.G.

As mentioned earlier, post-replicative transcription termination results in 3′ heterogenous length transcripts. However, at least four late genes have been identified to yield transcripts that have homogenous 3′ ends (29Parsons B.L. Pickup D.J.

For two of these exceptions (ATI and F17R), the uniform 3′ ends are generated by post-transcriptional site-specific endoribonucleolytic cleavage. We have characterized the vaccinia H5 protein as being associated with this activity, suggesting a role for H5 in late transcription termination (22D'Costa S.M. Bainbridge T.W. Condit R.C. Purification and properties of the vaccinia virus mRNA processing factor.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5267-5275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This cleavage was characterized to be possibly RNA sequence or structure specific, and phosphorylation was determined to be essential for cleavage activity. Consistent with an apparent role for H5 in viral DNA replication and post-replicative transcrition, published data suggest that H5 is a nucleic acid binding protein with affinity for both DNA and RNA (18Beaud G.

However, an extensive study characterizing this binding has not been performed. Finally, a role for H5 in virion morphogenesis is evident by phenotypic analysis of two temperature-sensitive mutants, tsH5–4 and Dts57 (25D'Costa S.M. Bainbridge T.W. Kato S.E. Prins C. Kelley K.

Virol. 2000; 74: 2393-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Data from these studies indicate that H5 is involved in multiple steps of viral morphogenesis, including membrane biogenesis, encapsidation of viroplasm to form immature virions, and maturation of immature virions into mature virions. In the current study, we have characterized the biochemical and biophysical properties of H5 and propose that H5 functions as a hub/scaffold protein that links otherwise discrete vaccinia virus processes. To understand the role of H5 in post-replicative transcription termination, we have determined the nature of 3′ ends during the endoribonucleolytic cleavage reaction and determined that H5-associated cleavage results in a 3′-OH end. We have further defined the nucleic acid binding properties of the H5 protein and shown that this protein can bind nucleic acids with high affinity in a sequence nonspecific manner requiring a minimum of 40 nt.

HeLa S3 cells were grown in suspension culture in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Joklik's modification) containing 5% calf serum and 2% fetal calf serum. E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring the plasmid pET14b and containing the H5 ORF was a gift from Dr. Paula Traktman. EhisH5 is a recombinant vaccinia virus that contains the 10x His and factor Xa sequences (MGHHHHHHHHHHSSGHIEGRH) from plasmid pET16b at the N terminus of the endogenous H5R. For the construction of ehisH5, BSC40 cells were infected with Dts57-WR virus (Dts57-WR is a reconstructed temperature-sensitive virus in the WR background that contains the Dts57 lesion, G189R in the C terminus of the WR-H5 protein) and transfected with a PCR product that contained the H4R-H5R region of vaccinia WR with the pET16b polyhistidine and factor Xa sequence inserted at the N terminus of H5R. Infection transfection was carried out at 37 °C to select for recombinant WT virus. The harvested lysates were then plaque assayed. Several plaques were picked and analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-His monclonal antibody (Novagen). Plaque lysates that tested positive by Western blotting were then propagated in cell culture and the sequence of His-tagged H5 was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The purification schemes for vaccinia-expressed and E. coli-expressed His-tagged H5 proteins were as described previously (22D'Costa S.M. Bainbridge T.W. Condit R.C. Purification and properties of the vaccinia virus mRNA processing factor.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5267-5275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For further purification by gel filtration, the H5 protein eluted from the nickel affinity column (His-Trap, GE Healthcare) was pooled, concentrated using an Amicon concentrator (Ultra cel 5K; Millipore) to ≤500 μl and applied to a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, containing 1 m NaCl and protease inhibitor mixture (1:100, Sigma). (This buffer also contained 5% glycerol and/or 2 mm DTT in situations where these reagents did not affect downstream events.) Molecular weight standards (high and low molecular weight standards; Amersham Biosciences) were used to calibrate the gel filtration column. The cleavage substrate (430-nt ssRNA) was prepared by in vitro transcription and uniformly labeled with 32P α-CTP as described previously (33D'Costa S.M. Antczak J.B. Pickup D.J. Condit R.C. Post-transcription cleavage generates the 3′ end of F17R transcripts in vaccinia virus.Virology. 2004; 319: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The 430-nt RNA substrate was either directly used in the cleavage assay or 30 pmol of RNA were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min with 30 units of tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP; Epicenter, 10 units/μl) in a total volume of 6.6 μl. Cleavage was carried out under standard cleavage conditions as described previously by incubating 10 fmol of RNA substrate with vaccinia-expressed nickel affinity-purified H5 protein in a reaction containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 7.5 mm MgCl2, and 300 mm NaCl for 1 h at 30 °C (33D'Costa S.M. Antczak J.B. Pickup D.J. Condit R.C. Post-transcription cleavage generates the 3′ end of F17R transcripts in vaccinia virus.Virology. 2004; 319: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The reactions were then treated with either 1 unit of Terminator exonuclease (Epicenter) or buffer (as control) for 2 h at 37 °C. Following Terminator exonuclease treatment, 30 μl of formamide-loading buffer was added, and the samples were denatured at 90–95 °C for 5 min, flash cooled, centrifuged, and loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea (Sequagel, National Diagnostics). The gels were then fixed, dried, and analyzed using the STORM PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). For [5′-32P]pCp labeling, the cleavage substrate was prepared using the RNA megascript kit (Ambion) to yield large quantities of “cold” substrate. The substrate was then cleaved with vaccinia-expressed nickel affinity-purified H5 protein under the conditions mentioned above. The residual substrate and the cleaved products were then purified using phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol purification and resuspended in nuclease-free water. This RNA (and RNA not subjected to the cleavage reaction) was then labeled in a reaction containing 150 μCi of [5′-32P]pCp (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 10 units of RNA ligase (New England Biolabs) at 4 °C overnight. The labeled RNA was then purified using phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol purification. The pellets were resuspended in 10 μl of formamide-loading dye and denatured at 90–95 °C for 5 min, flash cooled, centrifuged, and loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea (Sequagel, National Diagnostics). The gels were then processed as described above. Double sandwich filter binding assays were carried out following instructions of Lohman and Wong (42Wong I. Lohman T.M. A double-filter method for nitrocellulose-filter binding: application to protein-nucleic acid interactions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) with some modifications. One hundred microliter reactions were prepared in duplicate by equilibrating various concentrations of E. coli-expressed H5 (or vaccinia-expressed H5) with 10–100 pm nucleic acid (1 μl/reaction containing 1–10 fmol nucleic acid of different lengths and sequence as described under “Results”) on ice in rinse buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT) containing 10 μg of BSA. After 30 min, 90 μl of the reaction mixture was vacuum filtered through a nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) and nylon membrane (Hybond N+, GE Healthcare) sandwiched within a Schleicher and Schuell minifold. An equal volume of rinse buffer was then filtered through to rinse out the wells. The membranes were then separated, dried, and analyzed using a STORM PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). The percentage of nucleic acid binding to the nitrocellulose membrane was computed from these results and plotted against increasing concentrations of H5 protein using GraphPad Prism software to estimate a dissociation constant (KD) for each binding reaction. The KD for each experiment was determined using technical duplicates and the results shown are from at least two different experiments. All of the optimization data shown in Fig. 2 were obtained using 100 pm 32P-labeled ssRNA (430 nt; uniformly labeled) and vaccinia-expressed H5 protein (ehisH5). Experiments at pH 6 were done in MES buffer, those at pH 7–8 were done in HEPES, and those at pH 10 were done in 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid buffer. The pH of all buffers was adjusted either with HCl or NaOH. 5′-Cy5-tagged nucleic acids (Sigma Genosys) of varying lengths were used in the binding experiments that determined length dependence of H5 binding. All 32P-labeled substrates were gel-purified; 5′-Cy5-tagged substrates were obtained PAGE-purified from the manufacturer. For the preparation of double-stranded 5′-Cy5-tagged nucleic acids, complementary sequences of equal lengths and concentration were mixed in 1× TE buffer containing 50 mm NaCl and annealed by heating to 100 °C for 10 min in a Thermocycler. The temperature was then decreased to 4 °C gradually using a gradient of 1 °C/min. The hybrids were then analyzed on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Greater than 95% of the annealed oligonucleotides were observed as double-stranded molecules and, therefore, these hybrids were not gel-purified. The PONDR-Fit algorithm was used to calculate the intrinsic disorder dispositi"
