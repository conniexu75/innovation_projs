https://openalex.org/W2010458160,"Human cells possess an antiviral activity that inhibits the release of retrovirus particles, and other enveloped virus particles, and is antagonized by the HIV-1 accessory protein, Vpu. This antiviral activity can be constitutively expressed or induced by interferon-α, and it consists of protein-based tethers, which we term ‘tetherins’, that cause retention of fully formed virions on infected cell surfaces. Using deductive constraints and gene expression analyses, we identify CD317 (also called BST2 or HM1.24), a membrane protein of previously unknown function, as a tetherin. Specifically, CD317 expression correlated with, and induced, a requirement for Vpu during HIV-1 and murine leukaemia virus particle release. Furthermore, in cells where HIV-1 virion release requires Vpu expression, depletion of CD317 abolished this requirement. CD317 caused retention of virions on cell surfaces and, after endocytosis, in CD317-positive compartments. Vpu co-localized with CD317 and inhibited these effects. Inhibition of Vpu function and consequent mobilization of tetherin’s antiviral activity is a potential therapeutic strategy in HIV/AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W1970154782,"Cytoplasmic RIG-like helicases are sensors of viral RNA, and signal through the mitochondrial adaptor protein MAVS to activate IRF3 and induce type 1 interferon production. This paper shows that a member of the NLR family of proteins called NLRX1 is a negative regulator of the pathway and functions by inhibiting the interaction of the viral sensor with the MAVS adaptor. The RIG-like helicase (RLH) family of intracellular receptors detect viral nucleic acid and signal through the mitochondrial antiviral signalling adaptor MAVS (also known as Cardif, VISA and IPS-1) during a viral infection1,2,3,4,5,6. MAVS activation leads to the rapid production of antiviral cytokines, including type 1 interferons. Although MAVS is vital to antiviral immunity, its regulation from within the mitochondria remains unknown. Here we describe human NLRX1, a highly conserved nucleotide-binding domain (NBD)- and leucine-rich-repeat (LRR)-containing family member (known as NLR) that localizes to the mitochondrial outer membrane and interacts with MAVS. Expression of NLRX1 results in the potent inhibition of RLH- and MAVS-mediated interferon-β promoter activity and in the disruption of virus-induced RLH–MAVS interactions. Depletion of NLRX1 with small interference RNA promotes virus-induced type I interferon production and decreases viral replication. This work identifies NLRX1 as a check against mitochondrial antiviral responses and represents an intersection of three ancient cellular processes: NLR signalling, intracellular virus detection and the use of mitochondria as a platform for anti-pathogen signalling. This represents a conceptual advance, in that NLRX1 is a modulator of pathogen-associated molecular pattern receptors rather than a receptor, and identifies a key therapeutic target for enhancing antiviral responses."
https://openalex.org/W2121348589,"Using biodegradable scaffold and a biomimetic perfusion system, our lab has successfully engineered small-diameter vessel grafts using endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) obtained from vessels in various species. However, translating this technique into humans has presented tremendous obstacles due to species and age differences. SMCs from elderly persons have limited proliferative capacity and a reduction in collagen production, which impair the mechanical strength of engineered vessels. As an alternative cell source, adult human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were studied for their ability to differentiate into SMCs in culture plates as well as in a bioreactor system. In the former setting, immunofluorescence staining showed that MSCs, after induction for 14 days, expressed smooth muscle alpha-actin (SMA) and calponin, early and mid-SMC phenotypic markers, respectively. In the latter setting, vessel walls were constructed with MSC-derived SMCs. Various factors (i.e., matrix proteins, soluble factors, and cyclic strain) in the engineering system were further investigated for their effects on hMSC cell proliferation and differentiation into SMCs. Based on a screening of multiple factors, the engineering system was optimized by dividing the vessel culture into proliferation and differentiation phases. The vessel walls engineered under the optimized conditions were examined histologically and molecularly, and found to be substantially similar to native vessels. In conclusion, bone marrow-derived hMSCs can serve as a new cell source of SMCs in vessel engineering. Optimization of the culture conditions to drive SMC differentiation and matrix production significantly improved the quality of the hMSC-derived engineered vessel wall."
https://openalex.org/W2014018523,"Epidemiological studies suggest that the consumption of flavonoid-rich diets decreases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. However, the target sites of flavonoids underlying the protective mechanism in vivo are not known. Quercetin represents antioxidative/anti-inflammatory flavonoids widely distributed in the human diet. In this study, we raised a novel monoclonal antibody 14A2 targeting the quercetin-3-glucuronide (Q3GA), a major antioxidative quercetin metabolite in human plasma, and found that the activated macrophage might be a potential target of dietary flavonoids in the aorta. Immunohistochemical studies with monoclonal antibody 14A2 demonstrated that the positive staining specifically accumulates in human atherosclerotic lesions, but not in the normal aorta, and that the intense staining was primarily associated with the macrophage-derived foam cells. In vitro experiments with murine macrophage cell lines showed that the Q3GA was significantly taken up and deconjugated into the much more active aglycone, a part of which was further converted to the methylated form, in the activated macrophages. In addition, the mRNA expression of the class A scavenger receptor and CD36, which play an important role for the formation of foam cells, was suppressed by the treatment of Q3GA. These results suggest that injured/inflamed arteries with activated macrophages are the potential targets of the metabolites of dietary quercetin. Our data provide a new insight into the bioavailability of dietary flavonoids and the mechanism for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.

These results suggest that injured/inflamed arteries with activated macrophages are the potential targets of the metabolites of dietary quercetin. Our data provide a new insight into the bioavailability of dietary flavonoids and the mechanism for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Flavonoids are widely distributed in plant foods and beverages and therefore are regularly ingested with the human diet. In 1936, Rusznyak and Szent-Gyoygi (1Rusznyak S. Szent-Gyorgyi A. Nature. 1936; 138: 798Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar) found citrus flavonoids reduced capillary fragility and permeability in blood vessels. Thereafter, a large number of biological activities of flavonoids have been described which overall are believed to be beneficial for good health. Quercetin (3,3′,4′,5,7-pentahydroxyflavone) is a prime example of such a flavonoid and is bound to sugars in foods, mainly as β-glycosides. The quercetin glycosides occur in broccoli, apples, and especially in onions, with an abundance as high as 0.25-0.5 g/kg (2Hertog M.G. Hollman P.C. Katan M.B. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1992; 40: 2379-2383Crossref Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). The average daily intake of the flavonoids subclasses in The Netherlands is 23 mg (calculated as aglycones) of which quercetin supplies 16 mg (3Hertog M.G. Hollman P.C. Katan M.B. Kromhout D. Nutr. Cancer. 1993; 20: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). Epidemiological evidence links diets rich in quercetin with decreased incidence of cardiovascular and neoplastic diseases (4Hertog M.G. Feskens E.J. Hollman P.C. Katan M.B. Kromhout D.

Hankin J.H. Wilkens L.R. Kolonel L.N. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Because oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of these diseases, the bioavailability of quercetin and other flavonoids has been investigated in relation to their antioxidant activities in vivo. The antioxidant potential of quercetin is related to the number and position of the free hydroxyl groups in the molecule (10Cao G. Sofic E. Prior R.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (2174) Google Scholar); therefore, the regioselectivity of conjugation of the hydroxyl groups can be expected to modulate the biological activity of quercetin. Upon ingestion with the diet, quercetin glycosides are rapidly hydrolyzed during passage across the small intestine or by bacterial activity in the colon to generate quercetin aglycone, which is further metabolized in the so-called phase II reactions into the glucuronidated and/or sulfated derivatives. Alternatively, 3′- or 4′-hydroxyl group in the B-ring catechol moiety can also be methylated by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) 2The abbreviations used are: COMTcatechol-O-methyltransferaseQ3GAquercetin-3-O-β-d-glucuronideHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyHSAhuman serum albuminLPSlipopolysaccharideKLHkeyhole limpet hemocyaninBAECsbovine aortic endothelial cellsECDelectrochemical detectionELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assaymAbmonoclonal antibodyGAPDHglyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseRTreverse transcriptionSR-Athe class A scavenger receptorPBSphosphate-buffered salineFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateLDLlow density lipoproteinDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFBSfetal bovine serumSR-Ascavenger receptor AHBSSHanks' balanced salt solutionIR3Gisorhamnetin-3-glucoside. activity. Previous reports have clearly shown that quercetin-3-glucuronide (Q3GA) and quercetin-3′-sulfate are the major quercetin conjugates in rat and human plasma, in which aglycone could not be detected (11Day A.J. Mellon F. Barron D. Sarrazin G. Morgan M.R. Williamson G. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 35: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 12Moon J.H. Tsushida T. Nakahara K. Terao J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1274-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Although the biological activities of quercetin generally attenuate after conversion to the metabolites, the physiologically conceivable activities associated with oxidative stress for various quercetin metabolites have been reported (13Williamson G. Barron D. Shimoi K. Terao J. Free Radic. Res. 2005; 39: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). It is expected that Q3GA represents the radical scavenging actions of quercetin metabolites in vivo (12Moon J.H. Tsushida T. Nakahara K. Terao J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1274-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), because it retains the catechol moiety (3′,4′-o-dihydroxyl group) responsible for radical scavenging of quercetin even after the enzymatic metabolism. catechol-O-methyltransferase quercetin-3-O-β-d-glucuronide high performance liquid chromatography human serum albumin lipopolysaccharide keyhole limpet hemocyanin bovine aortic endothelial cells electrochemical detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay monoclonal antibody glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reverse transcription the class A scavenger receptor phosphate-buffered saline fluorescein isothiocyanate low density lipoprotein Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal bovine serum scavenger receptor A Hanks' balanced salt solution isorhamnetin-3-glucoside. Although the tissue distributions of quercetin and its metabolites have been assessed by a number of authors, only limited information on the localization of quercetin metabolites in the aorta is presently available. We have previously demonstrated that quercetin metabolites were present in the aorta of high cholesterol/quercetin glucoside-fed rabbits (14Kamada C. da Silva E.L. Ohnishi-Kameyama M. Moon J.H. Terao J. Free Radic. Res. 2005; 39: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), in which cholesterol accumulation in the aorta was significantly inhibited, suggesting the anti-atherosclerotic action of the quercetin metabolites in the aorta. To further understand the mechanism of the anti-atherosclerotic action of quercetin, it is necessary to know the target sites of the quercetin metabolites in the aorta. At present, a chromatographic technique such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry or electrochemical detection is the only analytical approach for evaluating quercetin and other flavonoids in biological samples. The immunochemical technique is a powerful tool for evaluating the localization of target molecules in tissue/cellular components; therefore, we developed a monoclonal antibody directed to a quercetin metabolite, Q3GA, and identified the activated macrophage cells as the potential target of dietary flavonoids in vivo. Materials—Quercetin dihydrate, acetobromo-α-d-glucuronic acid methyl ester, human serum albumin (HSA), lipopolysaccharides (LPS, from Escherichia coli), saccharic acid 1,4-lactone, and dinitrocatechol were purchased from Sigma. Quercetin-3-O-β-d-glucoside, quercetin-4′-O-β-d-glucoside, quercetin-3-O-sulfate, hyperoside, rutin, isorhamnetin (3′-methyl quercetin), and cyanidin-3-O-β-d-glucoside were obtained from Extrasynthese (Genay, France). Succinic anhydride was purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride, and N-hydroxysuccinimide were obtained from Pierce. Quercetin-3-O-β-d-glucuronide (Q3GA) was chemically synthesized as reported previously (12Moon J.H. Tsushida T. Nakahara K. Terao J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1274-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Monoclonal murine antibody to scavenger receptor A (SR-A) was obtained from TransGenic Inc. (Hyogo, Japan). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to CD36 and β-actin were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and BioLeg-end, respectively. Cell Culture—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) (15Isshiki M. Ying Y.S. Fujita T. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43389-43398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) were cultured in Medium 199 (Sigma) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS). RAW264 cell line was obtained from the Riken Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS. J774-1 was obtained from Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research Institute of Development, Aging, and Cancer, Tohoku University (Sendai, Miyagi, Japan). Cells were cultured in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. All media contain 100 μg/ml penicillin and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Analysis of Quercetin Metabolites in Human Plasma—Healthy volunteers (provided informed consent) that fasted overnight were served 350-500 g of cooked onion paste (provided by Kagome Research Institute, Tochigi, Japan) roasted with salad oil. The onion amounts were designed so as to be almost the same per their body weights (∼7 g/kg). The quercetin content in the onion paste was analyzed by HPLC (16Moon J.H. Nakata R. Oshima S. Inakuma T. Terao J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: R461-R467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) after the acid hydrolysis of the quercetin mono- and di-glucosides in the methanolic extract of the paste and determined to be ∼32.9 mg/100 g fo onion paste (as the equivalent for the quercetin aglycone). Before and 1.5 h after intake, heparinized blood was collected from each subject, and the plasma was obtained by centrifugation. The quercetin metabolites in the plasma were extracted with 5 volumes of methanol, and the methanolic fractions were evaporated under an N2 stream and dissolved in 20% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.5% phosphoric acid. For analysis of aglycone, plasma samples were mixed with an equal volume of ethyl acetate and centrifuged. After two extractions, the ethyl acetate layers were collected, evaporated under an N2 stream, and dissolved in HPLC solvent. Ten μl of the sample was injected into an HPLC-electrochemical detection (ECD) system (ESA, Cambridge, MA) equipped with a TSK-gel ODS-80Ts column (4.6 × 150 mm). The separation of the compounds was carried out by a gradient elution. Solvent A was 20% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.5% phosphoric acid, and solvent B was 100% acetonitrile containing 0.5% phosphoric acid. The gradient program was as follows: 0-10 min, 1% B; 10-20 min, linear gradient to 25% B; 20-25 min, linear gradient to 1% B; 25-30 min, hold; flow rate, 0.8 ml/min. Electrochemical detection was performed with a coulometric electrode at 150 mV. Cell-mediated LDL Oxidation—LDL (d = 1.063-1.093 g/ml) was isolated from healthy human volunteers by sequential ultracentrifugation and dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline. The LDL concentrations were determined by measuring the protein contents using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). BAECs in a 60-mm dish were treated with LDL (200 μg/ml in FBS-free Medium 199) in the presence of 5 μm Cu2+ and the different concentrations of Q3GA and the related compounds at 37 °C. After incubation, the oxidation reaction was terminated by adding 0.1 volume of 1 mm EDTA, 10 μm 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol solution. The LDL oxidation was measured as the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances with fluorescent detection (excitation 515 nm, emission 553 nm). Tetraethoxypropane was used as the standard compound that readily decomposes into the thiobarbituric acid-reactive malondialdehyde, a representative aldehyde formed in oxidized LDL, during the assay processes. Preparation of Monoclonal Antibody to Q3GA—To prepare the immunogen, the synthesized Q3GA was conjugated with KLH by a carbodiimide procedure. Briefly, the carboxylic derivatives of Q3GA (11.0 μmol) was activated by incubating with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (11.0 μmol) in the presence of N-hydroxysuccinimide (11.0 μmol) in dimethylformamide (200 μl) at room temperature overnight. A 100-μl aliquot of the mixture was added to 360 μl of KLH (10 mg/ml) or HSA (10 mg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated at room temperature for 4 h. After incubation, the proteins were dialyzed to PBS at 4 °C for 2 days. The obtained Q3GA-KLH conjugate (0.6 mg/ml in PBS) was emulsified with an equal volume of adjuvant. Six-week-old female BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally immunized with this emulsion (100 μl). The mice were repeatedly boosted with the immunogens (0.2 mg/ml) emulsified with an equal volume of adjuvant every 2 weeks. In the final boost, 100 μl of the immunogens (0.5 mg/ml in PBS) without adjuvant was intravenously injected. Three days after the final boost, one of the mice was sacrificed, and the spleen was removed. The spleen cells were fused with P3U1 myeloma cells in the presence of polyethylene glycol 1500 (Roche Applied Science) and cultured in the hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine medium for the selection of the hybridomas. After a week, the immunoreactivities of the culture supernatants were screened by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as follows. Fifty μl of the antigens (5 μg/ml) in PBS were coated in wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TPBS), the wells were blocked with a 4% aqueous solution of Block Ace (Dainihon Seiyaku, Osaka, Japan) at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing, 100 μl of the primary antibody in TPBS was added, and the wells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After washing, 100 μl of the peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG goat antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) with a 1:5000 dilution was added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The color-developing reaction was performed by the addition of 100 μl of the TMB substrate solution (within TMB substrate reagent set, BD Biosciences). The binding of the antibody to the antigen was evaluated by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm. The immunoreactive hybridomas were then cloned by the limited dilution method. After repeated screening and cloning, a monoclonal antibody mAb14A2 was finally obtained. The antibody was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation from the culture supernatant and used in the following experiment. Competitive ELISA—For competitive ELISA, the reaction of the primary antibody was carried out in the absence or presence of competitors. The competitive reactions were performed in PBS containing 1% HSA at 37 °C for 90 min. The cross-reactivity of the antibody to the competitors was expressed as B/B0, in which B is the amount of the antibody bound to the coating antigen in the presence of the competitor, and B0 is in the absence of a competitor. Immunohistochemistry—This investigation was carried out on aortic wall samples obtained during autopsy from patients with generalized arteriosclerosis. Each autopsy was performed at Tokyo Women's Medical University after the patients' family members granted informed consent according to the established guideline. Each sample was prepared for 10% formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded materials and for frozen materials embedded in the optimum cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetechnical, Tokyo, Japan) at -80 °C. Multiple 6-μm-thick sections were cut from these paraffin-embedded and frozen materials and used for the histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations. The paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized in xylene and ethanol, rehydrated in distilled water. Frozen sections were dried, postfixed or not in 10% formalin, and rehydrated. These prepared sections were quenched for 10 min with 3% hydrogen peroxide for inhibiting the endogenous peroxidase activity, rinsed in PBS, pretreated for 30 min at room temperature with 5% skim milk in PBS, and treated with the avidin/biotin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies such as the mAb14A2 at a dilution of 1:200 and mouse monoclonal IgG1 against CD68 (Clone KP-1; DakoCytomation, Kyoto, Japan) at a dilution of 1:10,000. Sections processed with omission of the primary antibodies or incubated with 5% skim milk in PBS served as negative reaction controls. Antibody binding was visualized by the avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase complex method using the appropriate Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). Immunohistochemical localization of Q3GA was verified by comparison of consecutive sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin and immunostained for CD68. 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride was used as the chromogen, and hematoxylin was used as the counterstain. Immunostained sections were observed with a light microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). In addition, the location of Q3GA immunoreactivity in macrophages was strictly identified by the double immunofluorescence method on frozen sections. In brief, sections were postfixed for 10 min at 4 °C in 100% acetone, rehydrated, rinsed in PBS, pretreated for 10 min at room temperature with 5% skim milk in PBS, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the mAb14A2 and rabbit polyclonal IgG against CD68, simultaneously (catalog number sc-9139; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Sections were then rinsed in PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at the same time. Double-immunostained sections were observed with a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The appearance of yellowish signals at merging FITC (green) and Cy3 (red) was considered as the co-localization of Q3GA and CD68. Competitive experiments to confirm the specificity of the immunostaining with mAb14A2 were also performed with the antibody in the presence of 100 μm Q3GA. Normal mouse IgG was used as the negative control. Immunohistochemical localization of the immunoreaction product deposits was verified by light microscopy on consecutive sections with hematoxylineosin or immunostained for CD68. To confirm the immunostaining of the conjugate metabolites with mAb14A2, the sections were treated for 60 min with β-glucuronidase (>600 units/ml) from Helix pomatia in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, prior to the reaction with mAb14A2. Analysis for Cellular Uptake of Quercetin-3-glucuronide—RAW264 macrophages were grown to confluence in DMEM containing 10% FBS on 60-mm dish in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were treated with or without LPS (1 μg/ml) in 2 ml of DMEM with 10% FBS. After a 24-h incubation, the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of FBS-free media, after which the media were exchanged with FBS-free DMEM containing 20 μm Q3GA. Following a 4-h incubation, the cell were washed three times with 1 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), scraped from the dish, and resuspended in 200 μl of methanol/acetic acid (100:1). Q3GA and its cellular metabolites were then extracted by sonication for 1 min using an Astrason XL2020 ultrasonic processor (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Farmingdale, NY) at level 6. After centrifugation, the supernatants were collected, evaporated under an N2 stream, and dissolved in 20% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.5% phosphoric acid. The samples were injected into the HPLC-ECD system as already described. Quantitation of quercetin compounds was performed using standard curves developed by the peak areas of authentic compounds (Q3GA, quercetin, and isorhamnetin). Immunocytochemical detection of Q3GA with mAb14A2 was also performed. Cells were cultured on coverslips in a 24-well plate. After treatment of cells with or without LPS/Q3GA as described above, cells were washed with HBSS three times and then fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS on ice. To prevent nonspecific antibody binding, the cells were washed twice in PBS and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 1% skim milk in PBS. Membranes were permeabilized by exposing the fixed cells to PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 min on ice. The cells were then incubated in the primary antibody (mAb14A2) in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. The cells were then incubated for 1 h in the presence of FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Dako Japan Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan), rinsed with PBS, and mounted on glass slides using Dako Cytomation fluorescent mounting medium. Images of cellular immunofluorescence were acquired using a Leica TCS-NT confocal laser scanning microscope. The DNA was also stained with propidium iodide. β-Glucuronidase Activity—Intracellular β-glucuronidase activity was measured by a colorimetric analysis using phenolphthalein mono-β-glucuronide (Sigma) as the substrate. Briefly, 30 μg of cell-free extracts, prepared by repeated freezing and thawing of cells, were mixed with 0.6 mm phenolphthalein mono-β-glucuronide in 100 μl of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.0. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min followed by adding 200 μl of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 11.0, the absorbance at 550 nm indicating the formation of phenolphthalein aglycone was measured. Extracellular activity was evaluated using Q3GA as the substrate. The culture medium was removed from the dishes and then incubated with 50 μm Q3GA at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, the formed aglycone was extracted twice with ethyl acetate, evaporated, and dissolved in mobile phase for HPLC-ECD analysis. Ten ml of the samples was injected into HPLC-ECD system as described above. The activity was expressed as the conversion rate (%) of Q3GA into the aglycone. Expression of Scavenge Receptors in Macrophage Cells—The RAW264 cells cultured in a 35-mm dish were washed twice with FBS-free DMEM, after which the media were exchanged with FBS-free DMEM containing the indicated concentrations of Q3GA dissolved in 5 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). After a 30-min preincubation, the cells were treated with or without oxidized LDL (100 μg/ml). The oxidized LDL was prepared upon incubation of LDL (1 mg/ml) with 5 μm Cu2+ in PBS at 37 °C for 24 h followed by dialysis in PBS at 4 °C for 4 days. Following incubation, the cells were lysed, and the total RNA was isolated and spectrophotometrically quantified. The expression levels of the scavenger receptors and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were detected by a reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. The RT reaction was performed with 10 μg of total RNA and an oligo(dT) primer using the first strand cDNA synthesis kit. The PCRs were carried out using 0.75 μl of cDNA in 24 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, containing 50 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, 1 μm of each forward and reverse primer, and 2 units of rTaqDNA polymerase (Toyobo Co., Osaka, Japan). The reactions were heated at 94 °C for 5 min and then immediately cycled 24 times (SR-A), 23 times (CD36), or 21 times (GAPDH) through a 50-s denaturing step at 94 °C, a 50-s annealing step at 51 °C (SR-A), 60 °C (CD36), or 64 °C (GAPDH), and a 50-s extension step at 72 °C. After the cycling procedure, a final 10-min elongation step at 72 °C was performed. The following primers were used as follows: SR-A, 5′-ATGACAGAGAATCAGAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCCTCTGTCTCCCTTTTC-3′ (reverse) (PCR product 855 bp); CD36, 5′-CCCAGTCACTTGTGTTTTGAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAACCTTTGAAGGCTTACATCC-3′ (reverse) (PCR product 246 bp); GAPDH, 5′-AACCCATCACCATCTTCCAGGAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CACAGTCTTCTGAGTGGCAGTGAT-3′ (reverse) (PCR product 350 bp). Quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed using TaqMan® gene expression assay and TaqMan® universal PCR master mix reagents (Applied Biosystems). The RT reaction was performed with 1 μg of total RNA and random primer using the high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). The amplification of PCR products was monitored by Applied Biosystems 7500 real time PCR system. The reaction conditions for RT and PCR were based on the protocols provided by Applied Biosystems. Relative levels of gene expression for each sample were calculated using comparative Ct method. The target gene expression in each sample was normalized to GAPDH Ct values. Data are expressed as the means ± S.D. of three separate experiments. Immunoblot Analysis—The cells were washed twice with HBSS and lysed with RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein samples were boiled with reducing sample buffer for 5 min. The samples (10 μg) were run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a poly(vinylidene) fluoride membrane (Hybond-P, GE Healthcare), incubated at room temperature for 1 h with a blocking reagent (EzBlock, ATTO Corp., Tokyo, Japan) in TTBS (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20) for blocking, washed in TTBS, and treated with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. After washing, blots were further incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase in TTBS. After washing, the membrane was visualized by using ECL-Plus detection reagent. Cholesterol Accumulation in RAW264 Cells—RAW264 cells in 35-mm dish were treated with or without Q3GA in FBS-free DMEM for 24 h. After washing twice with HBSS, cells were treated with oxidized LDL (0.2 mg/ml) for 4 h. After washing, total cholesterol was extracted three times with 1 ml of n-hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2, v/v). The extracts were dried up and then saponified in 10 m KOH/ethanol (1:9, v/v) at 90 °C for 1 h. Free cholesterol was extracted with 1 ml of ether, evaporated, and then dissolved in ice-cold acetone. Then 20 μl of the supernatant was injected onto TSK-gel Octyl-80Ts column (4.6 × 150 mm) equilibrated with acetonitrile/methanol/water (46:45:9) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with UV detection at 210 nm. Statistical Analysis—Data from real time PCR and cholesterol accumulation were expressed as the mean ± S.D. Comparisons were analyzed with the Student's t test. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Q3GA as a Major Quercetin Metabolite in Human Plasma—It is known that most of the quercetin is metabolized to the glucuronides, sulfates, and/or methylated form during absorption and circulation (17da Silva E.L. Piskula M.K. Yamamoto N. Moon J.H. Terao J.

https://openalex.org/W2063950568,"Germ cells are the only cells that transmit genetic information to the next generation, and they therefore must be prevented from differentiating inappropriately into somatic cells. A common mechanism by which germline progenitors are protected from differentiation-inducing signals is a transient and global repression of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-dependent transcription. In both Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, the repression of messenger RNA transcription during germ cell specification correlates with an absence of phosphorylation of Ser 2 residues in the carboxy-terminal domain of RNAPII (hereafter called CTD), a critical modification for transcriptional elongation. Here we show that, in Drosophila embryos, a small protein encoded by polar granule component (pgc) is essential for repressing CTD Ser 2 phosphorylation in newly formed pole cells, the germline progenitors. Ectopic Pgc expression in somatic cells is sufficient to repress CTD Ser 2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, Pgc interacts, physically and genetically, with positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), the CTD Ser 2 kinase complex, and prevents its recruitment to transcription sites. These results indicate that Pgc is a cell-type-specific P-TEFb inhibitor that has a fundamental role in Drosophila germ cell specification. In C. elegans embryos, PIE-1 protein segregates to germline blastomeres, and is thought to repress mRNA transcription through interaction with P-TEFb. Thus, inhibition of P-TEFb is probably a common mechanism during germ cell specification in the disparate organisms C. elegans and Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2068306128,"Elimination of misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by ER-associated degradation involves substrate retrotranslocation from the ER lumen into the cytosol for degradation by the proteasome. For many substrates, retrotranslocation requires the action of ubiquitinating enzymes, which polyubiquitinate substrates emerging from the ER lumen, and of the p97-Ufd1-Npl4 ATPase complex, which hydrolyzes ATP to dislocate polyubiquitinated substrates into the cytosol. Polypeptides extracted by p97 are eventually transferred to the proteasome for destruction. In mammalian cells, ERAD can be blocked by a chemical inhibitor termed Eeyarestatin I, but the mechanism of EerI action is unclear. Here we report that EerI can associate with a p97 complex to inhibit ERAD. The interaction of EerI with the p97 complex appears to negatively influence a deubiquitinating process that is mediated by p97-associated deubiquitinating enzymes. We further show that ataxin-3, a p97-associated deubiquitinating enzyme previously implicated in ER-associated degradation, is among those affected.

Terminally misfolded ER proteins (both membrane and soluble substrates) are recognized by ER chaperones and targeted to export sites at the ER membrane. Polypeptides are subsequently transferred across the membrane via an unknown conduit to enter the cytosol where they become substrates of the UPS. This pathway, termed retrotranslocation, ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) or dislocation is essential to adapt cells to ER stress caused by protein misfolding (4Ng D.T. Spear E.D. Walter P.

Interestingly, the retrotranslocation pathway can be hijacked by many viruses to down-regulate the expression of correctly folded cellular proteins involved in the immune defense of cells, which allows these viruses to propagate without being detected by the cytotoxic T cells (7Lybarger L.

Because polypeptides can adopt a variety of incorrectly folded states, different misfolded proteins are likely to be distinguished by discrete mechanisms. Genetic studies in yeast have uncovered at least two routes by which misfolded proteins can be selected to undergo retrotranslocation (11Swanson R. Locher M. Hochstrasser M.

Recent biochemical analyses have identified molecular constituents that account for the mechanistic differences of these pathways. It appears that substrates containing lesions in their luminal domains (ERAD-L substrates) are recognized by chaperones such as Kar2p, Yos9p, and Htm1p/Mn11p, and are targeted to a membrane complex that comprises proteins including Der1p, Usa1p, Hrd3p, and the ubiquitin ligase Hrd1p (16Buschhorn B.A. Kostova Z.

On the other hand, proteins carrying misfolding signals in their cytosolic domains (ERAD-C substrates) are disposed of by a different set of factors associated with another ubiquitin ligase Doa10p (20Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2006; 126: 361-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). When substrates leave the ER, these pathways merge at a highly conserved AAA ATPase (ATPase associated with various cellular activities) termed Cdc48p in yeast or p97/VCP in mammals (23Bays N.W.

In mammalian cells, p97 can be recruited to the ER membrane via association with two membrane proteins, Derlin and VIMP, which mediate the transport of a subset of substrates to the cytosol (26Ye Y.

With the assistance of a dimeric cofactor, Ufd1-Npl4, Cdc48p/p97 acts on both ERAD-L and ERAD-C substrates to extract them from the membrane once these substrates are polyubiquitinated (36Ye Y.

In the next step, substrates dislocated by p97 need to be delivered to the proteasome, which likely occurs in a tightly coupled manner at the ER membrane with the help of some shuttling factors. It was proposed that several ubiquitin-binding proteins including a p97-bound ubiquitin ligase Ufd2 and the proteasome-associated factor Rad23 may form a ubiquitin receiving chain to hand over polyubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome (43Richly H. Rape M. Braun S. Rumpf S. Hoege C. Jentsch S. Cell. 2005; 120: 73-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). We recently reported that the degradation of several ERAD substrates is also regulated by a p97-associated deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) named ataxin-3 (atx3), which may be part of the substrate delivery system (44Wang Q. Li L. Ye Y. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Using EerI as a tool, we now demonstrate the involvement of a p97-associated deubiquitinating process (PAD) in ERAD, which is mediated by p97-associated DUBs such as atx3. We provide evidence that PAD acts on dislocated substrates to facilitate their degradation. Constructs, Antibodies, and Chemicals—The pRK-FLAG-atx3 wt and the C14A mutant plasmids, and the antibodies to ubiquitin, p97 were described previously (44Wang Q. Li L. Ye Y. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The pLNCX2-HA-GFPμ plasmid was constructed by ligating the PCR-amplified HA-GFPμ into the BglII and NotI sites of the pLNCX2 vector (Clontech). The pRK-FLAG-HAUSP construct was generated by cloning the PCR-amplified HAUSP cDNA into the SalI and NotI site of the pRK vector. The following primers were used: 5′-ACGCGTCGACCATGAACCACCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGC, 5′-ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCTCAGTTATGGATTTTAATGGCCTTTTC. FLAG, HA, and GFP antibodies were purchased from Sigma, Roche Applied Science, and Invitrogen, respectively. EerI and MG132 were purchased from Chembridge Inc. and Calbiochem, respectively. Cell Lines—A9 cells (stably expressing US11 and HA-tagged heavy chain) were described previously (45Shamu C.E. Story C.M. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). TG12 cells (stably expressing TCRα-GFP) were a generous gift of Dr. R. Kopito (Stanford University). To make an astrocytoma cell line expressing HA-tagged GFPμ, a retroviral packaging cell line (GP2-293 cells) was co-transfected with pLNCX2-HA-GFPμ and a plasmid expressing the VSV-G protein. The retrovirus-containing medium was collected 72 h after transfection, and used to infect 373MG cells. HA-GFPμ-expressing cells were selected by neomycin (500 μg/ml). Individual clones were expanded, and a clone that accumulates HA-GFPμ upon MG132 treatment was used in this study. Mammalian Cell Culture, Transient Gene Expression, Fractionation, and Coimmunoprecipitation—Astrocytoma cells and 293T cells were maintained according to standard procedures. Transfections in 293T cells were done with Trans IT 293 (Mirus). Radiolabeling and fractionation experiments in astrocytoma cells were performed as described previously (36Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Briefly, astrocytoma cells expressing US11 were treated with chemicals as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were labeled with 27.5 μCi of [35S]methionine per 1.0 × 106 cells. After washing, the cells were permeabilized by addition of 0.028% digitonin on ice in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system. The samples were then incubated at 37 °C for different time periods and separated into membrane and supernatant fractions. Immunoprecipitation with heavy chain antibodies were done as described (36Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). To detect ubiquitinated HC, cells were solubilized in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 2 mm magnesium chloride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and a protease inhibitor mixture. Cell extracts were adjusted to contain 0.2% SDS, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min before subjected to immunoprecipitation. For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, cells were extracted with buffer N (30 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 150 mm potassium acetate, 4 mm magnesium acetate, 1% DeoxyBigCHAP, and a protease inhibitor mixture). All cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation (20,000 × g) and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies indicated in the figure legends. Immunoblots were visualized with a LAS3000 cooled CCD camera system. Results were quantified using MultiGauge v3.0 Software. In Vitro Deubiquitination Experiments—To detect p97-, atx3-, or HAUSP-associated deubiquitination, cells were extracted with buffer N (30 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 150 mm potassium acetate, 4 mm magnesium acetate, 1% DeoxyBigCHAP, and a protease inhibitor mixture). Cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with either p97 antibodies or anti-FLAG antibody to isolate p97 or FLAG-tagged atx3/HAUSP. Proteins bound to the beads were incubated in a deubiquitinating buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm potassium chloride, 5 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5% bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C. Deubiquitination reaction was stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analyses. Binding of EerI to a p97 Complex—To detect the association of EerI with p97 complexes, EerI-treated or -untreated cells were lysed in a buffer containing 30 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 150 mm potassium acetate, 4 mm magnesium acetate, 1% DeoxyBigCHAP, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and a protease inhibitor mixture. p97 and its associated factors were immunoprecipitated with an anti-p97 antibody. The beads were washed with a phosphate saline buffer, and the fluorescence intensity was measured using a 488/530 nm filter on a Perkin Elmer 1420 Victor plate reader. The amount of EerI associated with p97 complexes was calculated as Itreated – Iuntreated, wherein Itreated is the fluorescence intensity associated with p97 precipitates in EerI-treated cells and Iuntreated represents the background fluorescence associated with p97 precipitates in untreated cells. As a control, Hsp90 was immunoprecipitated from these extracts, and the associated fluorescence was measured in parallel with p97. Where indicated, p97 was precipitated by a FLAG antibody from extract of either untreated or EerI-treated cells that had also been transfected with FLAG-tagged atx3 or a control empty vector. Accumulation of Polyubiquitinated Intermediates in EerI-treated Cells—EerI was identified as a potent inhibitor of ERAD (Fig. 1A), but the precise target of its action is unclear. To understand how EerI influences retrotranslocation, we examined its effect on the degradation of HA-tagged MHC class I heavy chain (HLA-A2) (HC) in astrocytoma cells expressing the HCMV protein US11 (A9 cells). A9 cells treated with EerI or as a control with Me2SO were permeabilized in a buffer containing a low concentration of the detergent digitonin. The permeabilized cells were then subjected to centrifugation to obtain a supernatant fraction that contained cytosol and a pellet fraction that contained the ER membrane (36Ye Y. Meyer H.H.

Compared with Me2SO-treated cells, polyubiquitinated HC was accumulated in the cytosol of EerI-treated cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 6). As a positive control, we treated A9 cells with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. Consistent with previous reports (9Wiertz E.J.H.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), inhibition of the proteasome function uncoupled dislocation and degradation, leading to an accumulation of polyubiquitinated HC in cytosol (Fig. 1C,lanes 4 and 6). However, a significant fraction of HC accumulated in MG132-treated cells was non-ubiquitinated species with its N-linked glycan removed by a cytosolic N-glycanase (46Blom D. Hirsch C. Stern P. Tortorella D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 650-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 47Hirsch C. Blom D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1036-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The accumulation of these unmodified substrates upon inhibition of the proteasome function has been observed for many proteasome substrates, and was generally attributed to deubiquitination by cytosolic DUBs. Interestingly, compared with MG132-treated cells, EerI-treated cells contained very few such deubiquitinated, deglycosylated HC molecules, although they accumulated a similar amount of polyubiquitinated HC. These results suggest that EerI may inhibit a deubiquitinating process required for the degradation of dislocated HC. We next compared the effect of EerI and MG132 on degradation of overexpressed TCRα-GFP, a glycoprotein dislocated from the ER membrane because of the lack of its assembly partner (48Huppa J.B. Ploegh H.L. Immunity. 1997; 7: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 49Yu H. Kopito R.R. J. Biol.

Cell. 2006; 22: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Similar to HC, polyubiquitinated TCRα-GFP was accumulated in MG132-treated cells together with a deubiquitinated, deglycosylated species (Fig. 1D, lane 3). In contrast, cells treated with EerI alone or with both EerI and MG132 accumulated polyubiquitinated TCRα-GFP (lanes 2 and 4), but contained few deubiquitinated, deglycosylated TCRα-GFP molecules. These data suggest that EerI may also inhibit the degradation of TCRα by influencing its deubiquitination, a process that occurs upstream of the proteasome. Consistent with the notion that EerI inhibits a deubiquitinating process, cells exposed to EerI started to accumulate polyubiquitinated proteins ∼1.5 h after treatment. In addition, for a given time period, EerI-treated cells accumulated more polyubiquitinated proteins than MG132-treated cells (Fig. 1E, lane 5 versus lane 6), even though EerI was shown to only affect the degradation of a subset of the proteasomal substrates (51Fiebiger E. Hirsch C. Vyas J.M. Gordon E. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1635-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). EerI Inhibits PAD—Upon reaching the proteasome, many substrates are subjected to deubiquitination by DUBs associated with the proteasome before degradation takes place (52Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates 3rd, J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 53Yao T. Cohen R.E. Nature. 2002; 419: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). For those proteins that are handed over to the proteasome via p97 (such as the ERAD substrates), their deubiquitination appears to begin while these substrates are still bound by p97. Recent studies suggested that atx3, a p97-associated DUB, may promote deubiquitination at p97 to facilitate ER-associated degradation (44Wang Q. Li L. Ye Y. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 54Zhong X. Pittman R.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 2409-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that EerI may target PAD. This assumption would explain why several non-ERAD substrates are not affected by EerI (51Fiebiger E. Hirsch C. Vyas J.M. Gordon E. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1635-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To study PAD, we used a previously established in vitro deubiquitination assay. p97 and its associated substrates were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts and incubated in vitro. Ubiquitin chains on these substrates were deconjugated by DUBs present in the precipitated complex, leading to a reduction in polyubiquitin conjugates (Fig. 2A) (44Wang Q. Li L. Ye Y. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in vitro deubiquitination of p97 substrates was slow unless ATP was present (supplemental Fig. S1). This is unlikely caused by ATP-dependent degradation by the proteasome, because the proteolytic subunits of the proteasome were not detected in the p97 immunoprecipitates under this condition (44Wang Q. Li L. Ye Y. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Perhaps, p97-bound substrates needed to be released in an ATP-dependent reaction before they could gain access to a p97-associated DUB. Because EerI did not inhibit the retrotranslocation and degradation of MHC class I heavy chain when added to permeabilized US11 cells (data not shown), we suspected that EerI might need to be metabolized into an active species in intact cells to exert its inhibitory effect. Consistent with this interpretation, US11 cells grown in suspension after being treated with trypsin no longer responded to EerI (supplemental Fig. S2). These trypsin-treated cells apparently could still take up EerI because they became yellowish after exposure to EerI and emitted fluorescence when excited with an appropriate light (EerI is a yellow chemical that emits fluorescence at the wavelength of 488 nm) (Fig. 7A). Thus, it is possible that trypsinization or permeabilization of cells disrupts certain cellular pathways required for activation of EerI. For this reason, we first treated cells with EerI or as a control with Me2SO. The p97-substrate complex was then immunopurified from these cells, and subjected to deubiquitination in vitro. Compared with control cells, significantly more polyubiquitinated proteins were bound to p97 in EerI-treated cells (Fig. 2B, lane 8 versus lane 7). In contrast, when Hsp90, an abundant cytosolic protein, was immunoprecipitated, little ubiquitinated proteins were co-precipitated (lanes 5 and 6). When p97-associated substrates were subjected to in vitro deubiquitination by DUBs co-precipitated with p97, substrates isolated from EerI-treated cells were significantly more stable (only reduced by ∼10% after incubation compared with ∼60% for substrates isolated from control cells) (Fig. 2C, lanes 3, 4 versus lanes 1, 2). Kinetic experiment further supported this conclusion (Fig. 2D, lanes 5–8 versus lanes 1–4). On the other hand, inhibition of the proteasome function only slightly affected PAD (Fig. 2C, lanes 5–6, also see the graph in Fig. 2C). Together, these data suggest that EerI inhibits deubiquitination associated with p97. EerI Inhibits atx3-mediated Deubiquitination—Because atx3 acts downstream of p97 to promote deubiquitination of substrates dislocated by p97 during retrotranslocation (44Wang Q. Li L. Ye Y. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether EerI affects atx3-associated deubiquitination. To study atx3-dependent deubiquitination, atx3 and its associated substrates were immunoprecipitated from detergent extracts of 293T cells expressing FLAG-tagged atx3, and incubated in vitro in the absence of ATP. Immunoblotting showed that ubiquitinated proteins bound by atx3 were rapidly turned over, which was apparently caused by deubiquitination because it could be inhibited by ubiquitin aldehyde, a deubiquitination inhibitor (Fig. 3A, lanes 4–6 versus lanes 1–3). In addition, because substrates co-precipitated with a deubiquitination defective atx3 mutant (atx3 C14A) remained relatively stable under the same condition (Fig. 3B), the disappearance of atx3-associated substrates in this reaction was primarily caused by atx3-mediated deubiquitination. In accordance with the idea that EerI may need to be converted into an active form in cells to inhibit the degradation of p97 substrates, adding EerI to purified atx3-substrate complex had no effect on atx3-mediated deubiquitination (data not shown). We therefore isolated atx3-substrate complex from cells treated with Me2SO, EerI, or MG132, and analyzed the deubiquitination of atx3-associated substrates in vitro. Compared with control cells, atx3-bound ubiquitin conjugates from EerI-treated cells were more resistant to deubiquitination (Fig. 3C, lanes 5–8 versus lanes 1–4). By contrast, ubiquitin chains on atx3 substrates isolated from MG132-treated cells were rapidly deconjugated similar to those purified from control cells (Fig. 3D, lanes 7–9 versus lanes 1–3). These data suggest that EerI inhibits atx3-associated deubiquitination. To see whether EerI could irreversibly inhibit the enzymatic activity of atx3, atx3 purified from EerI-treated cells was analyzed for its ability to disassemble excess chemically synthesized ubiquitin conjugates (Ub2–7). The results indicated that atx3 isolated from EerI-treated cells still retained deubiquitinating activity toward exogenously added substrate (Ub2–7) (supplemental Fig. S3). Thus, EerI appears to inhibit atx3-associated deubiquitination without irreversibly abolishing its enzymatic activity. Further, because the association of p97 with atx3 was not disrupted in EerI-treated cells (Fig. 4, lane 6 versus lane 5), EerI or its metabolites may influence atx3-associated deubiquitination possibly by acting on a cofactor that is associated with the p97-atx3 complex (see below). To see whether EerI could influence deubiquitinating process mediated by other DUBs, we tested the effect of EerI on HAUSP-associated deubiquitination. HAUSP is a deubiquitinating enzyme that regulates the stability of many cellular factors including the tumor suppressor protein p53 (55Li M. Chen D. Shiloh A. Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Qin J. Gu W. Nature. 2002; 416: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). To this end, we expressed FLAG-tagged HAUSP in 293T cells, and treated these cells with either EerI or Me2SO. Cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody to purify HAUSP and its associated ubiquitinated substrates. EerI treatment moderately increased the amount of ubiquitinated proteins associated with HAUSP (Fig. 5, lane 5 versus lane 1), which may be caused by an interaction of HAUSP with the accumulated polyubiquitinated proteins in EerI-treated cell extract. Nonetheless, when HAUSP-associated deubiquitination was measured, HAUSP-bound substrates isolated from either Me2SO- or EerI-treated cells both decayed rapidly (Fig. 5). These experiments suggest that HAUSP-associated deubiquitination is not affected by EerI. EerI Inhibits the Degradation of a Soluble Substrate—Because the degradation of GFPμ, a soluble proteasome substrate (56Bence N.F. Bennett E.J. Kopito R.R. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) is strongly influenced by expression of an atx3 mutant (57Burnett B. Li F. Pittman R.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), we speculated that the degradation of GFPμ may involve PAD. Consistent with this interpretation, expression of a dominant negative p97 mutant stabilized GFPμ in part as a p97-associated form (data not shown), confirming that GFPμ is a p97 substrate. We therefore tested whether EerI could inhibit the degradation of GFPμ. Indeed, in EerI-treated cells, GFPμ was present almost exclusively as a polyubiquitinated form. This was in contrast to MG132-treated cells in which GFPμ was mostly accumulated in a deubiquitinated form, and only to a lesser extent as polyubiquitinated species (Fig. 6A, lane 6 versus lane 5). On the other hand, the degradation of Ub-R-GFP, a substrate whose degradation is independent of atx3 (44Wang Q. Li L. Ye Y. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), was not affected by EerI-treatment (Fig. 6B). Kinetic experiments showed that GFPμ was accumulated in EerI-treated cells at a similar rate as the ERAD substrate TCRα-GFP (Fig. 6C), indicating that the blockage in the degradation of GFPμ is not a secondary defect of ERAD inhibition. Together, these data indicate that EerI also delays the degradation of a soluble p97 substrate by influencing its deubiquitination. A p97 Complex Is Targeted by EerI—To understand how EerI affects p97-associated deubiquitination, we tested whether EerI could associate with p97 complexes in cells. We took advantage of the observation that EerI emitted fluorescence when excited with an appropriate light (Fig. 7A). If EerI associates with a p97 complex, we should be able to detect fluorescence emitted from p97 complexes isolated from EerI-treated cells. Indeed, p97 complex purified from EerI-treated cells consistently emitted fluorescence at higher levels than that isolated from untreated cells, which we took as background. By contrast, little fluorescence was detected in association with Hsp90 in EerI-treated cells (Fig. 7B). Moreover, when we purified p97 by precipitating its interaction partner atx3, we also observed fluorescence emitted from samples purified from EerI-treated cells (Fig. 7C). Taken together, these results suggest that EerI can associate with a p97 complex in cells. To further understand how EerI affects the function of p97, we analyzed the interaction of p97 with its known partners in EerI-treated cells. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that EerI did not disrupt the interaction of p97 with Derlin-1 and VIMP (Fig. 8A), neither was its association with Ufd1 affected (Fig. 8B). However, when we purified p97 from cells radiolabeled with [35S]methionine, an unknown protein of ∼180 kDa was found to interact with p97 in untreated cells, but not in EerI-treated cells (Fig. 8C, lane 5 versus lane 2). Interestingly, fractionation experiments showed that the interaction of p97 with this 180 kDa protein was exclusively restricted to the membrane fraction (Fig. 8D, lane 3 versus lane 4). Together, these data suggest that EerI selectively disrupts the interaction of p97 with certain factors in cells. In this report, we demonstrate that EerI inhibits some deubiquitination reactions associated with the dislocase p97. We further identified atx3 as one of the DUBs affected by EerI. We previously showed that atx3 functions downstream of p97, and the latter hydrolyzes ATP to extract ERAD substrates from the ER membrane. Thus, atx3-mediated PAD appears to act preferentially on substrates that have been extracted from the ER membrane. Accordingly, inhibition of PAD should result in accumulation of a fraction of polyubiquitinated retrotranslocation substrates in cytosol, which was indeed observed in cells treated with EerI (Fig. 1, B and C). Interestingly, a previous study has proposed that EerI may inhibit ERAD by blocking substrate dislocation from the ER membrane (51Fiebiger E. Hirsch C. Vyas J.M. Gordon E. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1635-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Our finding that the degradation of a cytosolic proteasome substrate, which does not involve membrane dislocation, is also inhibited by EerI argues against this model. Instead, it favors the idea that the target of EerI must reside in cytosol, which is in line with our interpretation that EerI targets certain cytosolic deubiquitinating activities associated with p97. The discrepancy between the two reports is likely caused by the different methodologies used in these studies. In previously published work, the fate of newly synthesized MHC class I heavy chain was examined by pulse-chase experiments after cells were treated with EerI for 16 h. Because EerI treatment causes accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in cells, which should lead to depletion of the free ubiquitin pool, and because ubiquitin is required for heavy chain dislocation in US11 cells (58Shamu C.E. Flierman D. Ploegh H.L. Rapoport T.A. Chau V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2546-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 59Kikkert M. Hassink G. Barel M. Hirsch C. van der Wal F.J. Wiertz E. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), it is possible that a prolonged treatment with EerI may ultimately block dislocation as a consequence of ubiquitin deficiency induced by lack of deubiquitination. In this case, the cytosolic accumulation of polyubiquitinated ERAD substrates prior to dislocation inhibition can only be detected by examining the steady state level of these substrates as shown in this study, but would escape detection by the previously published approach. Our results suggest that EerI can associate with a p97 complex to influence a downstream deubiquitination process. We attempted to determine the in vitro ATPase activity of p97 that had been purified from either EerI-treated or untreated cells. We found that EerI treatment did not lower the ATPase activity of p97 (data not shown). This is consistent with our finding that fully dislocated MHC class I heavy is accumulated in the cytosol of EerI-treated cells. These data indicate that EerI-induced defect in deubiquitination is unlikely a secondary consequence of inactivation of the p97 ATPase activity. How does EerI act to influence PAD? The binding of EerI to p97 complexes does not block the interaction between p97 and the deubiquitinating enzyme atx3 (Fig. 4), neither does it irreversibly inactivate the enzymatic activity of atx3. Thus, EerI might cause a conformational change in certain constituents of a p97 complex or alter its composition by influencing the association of p97 with some other cofactors. Our co-immunoprecipitation data indicate that at least the association of p97 with an unknown protein of 180 kDa is disrupted in cells treated with EerI. Characterizing the identity of this 180 kDa protein may provide some clues on how EerI influences the function of p97. Why would substrates need to be deubiquitinated by enzymes associated with p97? Although ubiquitin chains consisting of at least 4 ubiquitin moieties are required for guiding a substrate to the proteasome, these conjugates eventually need to be removed by DUBs associated with the proteasome before degradation can take place efficiently (52Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates 3rd, J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 53Yao T. Cohen R.E. Nature. 2002; 419: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that p97-associated deubiquitination may partially trim ubiquitin chains attached to a p97 substrate, which may facilitate the subsequent disassembly of these ubiquitin chains by a downstream proteasome-associated DUB. Alternatively, p97-associated DUBs may have an editing function to disassemble ubiquitin chains containing incorrect linkages. This would ensure that substrates to be transferred to the proteasome always carry ubiquitin chains with the proper linkage. Several lines of evidence suggest that EerI may need to be metabolized into an active species to exert its inhibitory effect. First, EerI does not inhibit atx3-mediated deubiquitination unless atx3-substrate complex purified from EerI-treated cells is analyzed. Second, US11 cells grown in suspension after being treated with trypsin no longer respond to EerI. Third, when added to permeabilized US11 cells, EerI fails to inhibit retrotranslocation of MHC class I heavy chain even at a concentration 15 times higher than that needed to block HC degradation in intact cells (data not shown). Presumably, trypsinization or permeabilization of cells disrupts certain cellular pathways required to activate EerI. In summary, our results suggest that EerI specifically targets a subset of deubiquitinating processes in cells that are associated with p97. Since the UPS plays a critical role in cell cycle progression, which is particularly essential for the survival of cancer cells, an UPS inhibitor like EerI may offer attractive therapeutic possibilities for certain types of human cancer. Indeed, a proteasome inhibitor named bortezomib has recently been approved for treating patients with multiple myeloma (60Adams J. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 417-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to test whether EerI can be further developed to become an anti-cancer therapy.

Collagens form a large protein family that is characterized by repeating glycine-X-X′ sequences, where X and X′ are often proline and 4-hydroxyproline, respectively (15Kadler K.E. Baldock C. Bella J. Boot-Handford R.P. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 1955-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Three collagen chains form a right-handed triple-helical structure. The fibrillar collagens (types I, II, III, V, and XI) are characterized by triple-helical domains of ∼1000 amino acids that self-assemble into highly organized fibrils and play key architectural roles in connective tissues. The interactions of fibrillar collagens with some of their cellular receptors, in particular integrins, have been well characterized. Collagen binding integrins recognize discrete amino acid sequences in triple-helical collagen. The use of synthetic triple-helical peptides allowed the identification of an important, high affinity integrin binding site, GFOGER (where O is hydroxyproline) (16Knight C.G. Morton L.F.

In contrast to the collagen binding integrins, for which a receptor-ligand co-crystal has been described as a complex between the α-2 I domain and the model collagen peptide GFOGER (18Emsley J.

Cell. 2000; 101: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar), we know little about the molecular mechanism by which the DDRs recognize collagen. Our previous work showed that DDR2 binds to a specific site within the D2 period of collagen II (3Leitinger B. Steplewski A. Fertala A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 993-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), but the nature of this (or, indeed, any other) DDR2 binding motif is unknown. In the present study, we have characterized DDR2 binding motifs in collagen, using the Collagen II Toolkit, a set of 56 overlapping triple-helical peptides encompassing the entire triple-helical domain of human collagen II. The Toolkit approach allows a comprehensive analysis of binding sites within a fibrillar collagen type. We previously used the Collagen III Toolkit to locate novel binding sites for integrins and von Willebrand factor (VWF) in human collagen III (19Raynal N. Hamaia S.W. Siljander P.R. Maddox B.

Screening the Collagen II Toolkit for binding to recombinant DDR2 identified three major binding sites. Coincidentally, one of the binding sites is almost identical to the recently identified high affinity binding site for VWF in collagens II and III (20Lisman T. Raynal N. Groeneveld D. Maddox B. Peachey A.R. Huizinga E.G. Groot de P.G. Farndale R.W. Blood. 2006; 108: 3753-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Focusing on this peptide sequence, we used a set of truncated and alanine-substituted peptides to characterize the minimal collagen sequence required for DDR2 binding. The specific amino acid motif recognized by DDR2 is distinct from that of integrins and the platelet collagen receptor glycoprotein VI (GpVI) (21Smethurst P.A. Onley D.J. Jarvis G.E. O'Connor M.N.

Importantly, triple-helical peptides comprising the DDR2 binding site not only inhibited DDR2 binding to collagen II but were able to activate DDR2 autophosphorylation in a specific manner.

Collagen I (acid-soluble from rat tail; C-7661) and collagen IV (acid-soluble from placenta; C-5533) were purchased from Sigma (Poole, UK). Bovine collagen II, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay grade, was from Chondrex Inc. (Redmond, WA). The antibodies and their sources were as follows: anti-DDR2, goat anti-DDR2 Ig (AFA2538) from R&D Systems (Abingdon, UK); mouse anti-Myc tag, clone 9E10, from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human Fc from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA); anti-phosphotyrosine, clone 4G10, from Upstate Biotechnology. Secondary antibodies were as follows: sheep anti-mouse Ig-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences UK, Chalfont St Giles, UK); rabbit-anti-goat Ig-horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). Cell Culture and Cell Lines—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA), HEK293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK), and HEK293-T cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 nutrient mixture (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum. Production and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The production and purification of recombinant DDR proteins was as described previously (5Leitinger B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16761-16769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The His-tagged DDR2 extracellular domain protein (His-DDR2) was produced from episomally transfected HEK293-EBNA cells. The Fc-tagged DDR2 DS domain (DS2-Fc) was isolated from episomally transfected HEK293-T cells. Solid-phase Collagen Binding Assays—The assay procedure has been described previously in detail (5Leitinger B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16761-16769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Briefly, collagens or collagen peptides were diluted in 0.01 m acetic acid to 10 μg/ml and coated onto Immulon 2 HB 96-well plates (Fisher Scientific) overnight at room temperature. This represents a 10-fold excess over saturating concentration of peptide, verified using similar peptides for integrin and platelet binding (35Onley D. J. (2001) Investigation of the Platelet-Collagen Interaction Using Triple-helical Peptides, Ph.D. thesis, University of CambridgeGoogle Scholar). Wells were then blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20. Recombinant DDR2 proteins, diluted in incubation buffer (0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20), were added for 3 h at room temperature. Wells were washed six times with incubation buffer between all incubation steps. Bound His-DDR2 protein was detected with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution), added for 1 h at room temperature followed by sheep anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (1:1000 dilution), added for 1 h at room temperature. Bound DS2-Fc protein was detected with goat anti-human Fc coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:3333 dilution), added for 1 h at room temperature. A color reaction was subsequently performed using o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma), added for 3–5 min. The reaction was stopped with 3 m H2SO4, and plates were read in a 96-well plate reader at 492 nm. For the blocking assays, His-DDR2 was preincubated with the indicated concentrations of peptides for 1 h at room temperature prior to adding of the His-DDR2/peptide mixture to collagen II-coated plates. The assay was developed as described above. Collagen-induced DDR Autophosphorylation—The assay was performed as described previously in detail (5Leitinger B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16761-16769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells in 24-well plates were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with DDR2 expression vector (5Leitinger B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16761-16769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). 24 h later, the cells were incubated with serum-free medium for 16 h. Cells were then stimulated with collagen I, collagen II (both at 10 μg/ml), or different collagen peptides (at 100 μg/ml) for 90 min, or as indicated, at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm NaF. Aliquots of the lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed with mouse anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies followed by sheep anti-mouse Ig horseradish peroxidase. Detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). To strip the blots, membranes were incubated in antibody stripping solution (Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, Texas) for 10 min at room temperature. The blots were reprobed with goat anti-DDR2 antibodies followed by rabbit anti-goat Ig-horse-radish peroxidase. The Collagen II Toolkit—Sequences of Collagen II Toolkit peptides are shown in supplemental Table 1. The host-guest strategy (22Shah N.K. Ramshaw J.A. Kirkpatrick A. Shah C. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10262-10268Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was applied, as in our previous studies (16Knight C.G. Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Tuckwell D.S. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J.

Each Toolkit peptide contains a guest sequence of 27 amino acids, the C-terminal 9 amino acids of which form the first 9 guest amino acids of the next peptide. Thus, the guest sequence of the Toolkit advances 18 amino acids along the triple-helical domain of collagen II with each successive peptide, and a 9-amino-acid overlap is included between adjacent peptides. Mapping DDR2 Binding Sites within Collagen II—Our previous studies used two recombinant soluble extracellular DDR2 proteins to analyze the binding of DDR2 to immobilized collagen ligands (3Leitinger B. Steplewski A. Fertala A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 993-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 4Leitinger B. Kwan A.P. Matrix Biol. 2006; 25: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 5Leitinger B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16761-16769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar): one construct comprising the entire DDR2 extracellular domain, N-terminally tagged with a His tag and a Myc epitope (His-DDR2), and the other construct consisting mainly of the DDR2 DS domain, C-terminally tagged with an Fc tag (DS2-Fc). Both of these constructs exhibited high affinity binding to the fibrillar collagens I and II, but like full-length DDR2, did not recognize the basement membrane collagen IV. In this study, we used the same recombinant DDR2 proteins and screened the Collagen II Toolkit peptides for DDR2 binding (Fig. 1). Both DDR2 proteins showed good binding to only four peptides: Toolkit peptides II-13, II-22, II-23, and II-44. The response was similar to (or greater than) that to full-length immobilized collagen II. However, this might be an overestimation as the peptides likely immobilize at greater molar concentration on the plates due to their lower molecular weight when compared with full-length collagen II. There was no binding, as expected, to collagen IV or bovine serum albumin. In addition, the control peptide GPP, (GPC-(GPP)10-GPC-NH2), which consists entirely of the peptide “host” sequence, was not recognized. Similarly, peptide CRP, (GPC-(GPO)10-GPC-NH2), a ligand for the platelet collagen receptor GpVI (24Morton L.F. Hargreaves P.G. Farndale R.W. Young R.D. Barnes M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), did not interact with DDR2. In addition to the four strongly interacting peptides, His-DDR2 showed above background binding to three further peptides, II-17, II-38, and II-39. Solid-phase binding assays showed that the DDR2 proteins had highest affinity to immobilized peptide II-22, among the four positive peptides identified in the screen. Half-maximal binding occurred at ∼10 nm added DDR2 proteins (Fig. 2). Identification of the Minimal Collagen Sequence Required for DDR2 Binding—As the Toolkit is a set of overlapping peptides, it was likely that DDR2 recognized the overlapping sequence of peptides II-22 and II-23. Inspection of the overlap sequence revealed, interestingly, that this sequence (GQOGVMGFO) is almost identical to the recently identified high affinity binding site for VWF in collagen III (RGQOGVMGFO) (20Lisman T. Raynal N. Groeneveld D. Maddox B. Peachey A.R. Huizinga E.G. Groot de P.G. Farndale R.W. Blood. 2006; 108: 3753-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In this previous work, we screened the entire Collagen III Toolkit for VWF binding and identified a single peptide, III-23, that bound plasma VWF. We tested this peptide and a set of truncated and alanine-substituted peptides derived from this sequence (Table 1) for DDR2 binding (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. 1 A). The response of both DDR2 proteins to III-23 was similar to their response to II-22. The results of the truncated peptide series showed that DDR2 bound strongly to the peptide sequence GVMGFO at 10 μg/ml (142 nm) DDR2 but did not bind any peptides in which this hexapeptide sequence was truncated; this hexapeptide will therefore be referred to as the minimal binding sequence. However, at lower DDR2 protein concentrations (2 μg/ml, 28 nm), both GVMGFO and the longer sequence GQOGVMGFO gave suboptimal responses, indicating that these peptides are recognized with lower affinity. Extending the sequence by a further amino acid triplet to GPRGQOGVMGFO gave optimal responses for both DDR2 concentrations. Dose-response curves for both GPRGQOGVMGFO and GPSGPRGQOGVMGFO showed that DDR2 recognized these peptides with similar high affinity that was even somewhat greater than the affinity with which DDR2 recognized Collagen II Toolkit peptide, II-22 (supplemental Fig. 2). DDR2 binding to intact collagen is strictly dependent on the native triple-helical conformation. It was therefore important to test whether DDR2 would recognize a non-helical collagen peptide. A non-helical version (GAP-GPR-GFO; Table 1) of the high affinity DDR2 ligand GPRGQOGVMGFO, was non-helical above 8 °C, as determined by polarimetry (data not shown), and supported no binding by DDR2 (Fig. 3A, supplemental Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 2), indicating that peptide recognition by DDR2 in our system mirrors recognition of native collagen by DDR2. Moreover, DDR2 did not recognize GFOGER, the high affinity integrin binding site identified previously by us (16Knight C.G. Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Tuckwell D.S. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Alanine scanning showed that 2 amino acids, Met and Phe, are crucial for DDR2 recognition; substitution of Arg and Hyp (underlined in GPRGQOGVMGFO) led to a modest reduction in binding, whereas all other X and X′ positions could be substituted with no apparent loss of binding (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. 1B). In human collagen I, a heterotrimer of two α1 and one α2 chains, a related sequence occurs in the α1 chain (GARGQAGVMGFO, that differs in 2 amino acids (underlined) from the high affinity DDR2 binding sequence in collagen III (one amino acid difference to the motif GARGQOGVMGFO in collagen II). As expected from the results of the alanine-substituted peptides, a triple-helical peptide comprising this sequence was recognized by DDR2, albeit to a somewhat lesser degree at the lower protein concentrations tested (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. 1B). The sequence in the α2 chain that aligns with this sequence, GARGEOGNIGFO (where underlining represents difference to the motif GARGQOGVMGFO in collagen II), was recognized much less well, suggesting that the two α1 chains of collagen are the major contributors to the corresponding DDR2 binding site in collagen I. High Affinity DDR2 Binding Peptides Inhibit DDR2 Binding to Collagen II—We tested whether the two high affinity DDR2 binding peptides, GPRGQOGVMGFO and GPSGPRGQOGVMGFO, could inhibit DDR2 binding to immobilized full-length collagen II. Both peptides efficiently inhibited DDR2 binding with half-maximal inhibition at ∼50 μg/ml (∼10 μm) (Fig. 4). Importantly, the non-helical version of GPRGQOGVMGFO did not inhibit DDR2 binding. Activation of Transmembrane Signaling By High Affinity DDR2 Binding Peptides—To relate the binding of triple-helical collagen peptides to receptor activation of membrane-bound DDR2, we expressed full-length DDR2 transiently in HEK293 cells and examined whether the peptides could induce DDR2 autophosphorylation (Fig. 5). Activation by collagen peptides required 50–100 μg/ml peptides in the medium, compared with 10 μg/ml collagen. The reasons for the lower potency of the peptides are unclear at present. Importantly, however, there was a strict correlation between the ability to induce DDR2 autophosphorylation and high affinity DDR2 binding. Although peptides encompassing the sequence GPRGQOGVMGFO activated the receptor, the two smaller (lower affinity) peptides GVMGFO and GQOGVMGFO did not. Significantly, replacing Phe by Ala in the context of otherwise activating sequence GPSGPRGQOGVMGFO abolished DDR2 autophosphorylation. Moreover, the non-helical version of GPRGQOGVMGFO did not activate DDR2. Taken together, these results show that triple-helical peptides comprising the DDR2 binding site activate DDR2 autophosphorylation in a specific manner, demonstrating that the identified triple-helical motif is a genuine DDR agonist leading to transmembrane signaling. Collagen-induced DDR autophosphorylation occurs with unusually slow and sustained kinetics (1Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 2Shrivastava A. Radziejewski C. Campbell E. Kovac L. McGlynn M. Ryan T.E. Davis S. Goldfarb M.P. Glass D.J.

Peptide GPRGQOGVMGFO induced DDR2 autophosphorylation with the same slow kinetics as collagen I, with maximal DDR2 phosphorylation detectable at ∼60 min of incubation (Fig. 6). This result indicates that slow cellular processes are responsible for the delay in receptor activation, rather than accessibility of ligand binding sites within collagen. A major unresolved question is whether the DDRs recognize specific sequence motifs in collagen (13Leitinger B. Hohenester E. Matrix Biol. 2007; 26: 146-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Here we define, for the first time, specific binding motifs for DDR2 in collagen. Our results show that, like collagen binding integrins, DDR2 recognizes discrete amino acid motifs in triple-helical collagen. DDR2 binding motifs are distinct from those defined for integrins (summarized by Ref. 19Raynal N. Hamaia S.W. Siljander P.R. Maddox B. Peachey A.R. Fernandez R. Foley L.J. Slatter D.A. Jarvis G.E.

Screening the Collagen II Toolkit for DDR2 binding identified only four peptides that bound DDR2 strongly. The three binding sites identified in collagen II each contain a GFO triplet, with the Phe critical and the Hyp important for DDR2 binding to the motif contained in the overlap of Toolkit peptides II-22 and II-23 (henceforth referred to as the central DDR2 binding motif). The presence of GFO is not sufficient for DDR2 binding, however; there are eight GFO motifs in the human collagen II sequence, five of which do not bind DDR2. Importantly, one of these GFO triplets is part of the integrin binding motif, GFOGER, which DDR2 did not recognize, neither as an isolated moti"
https://openalex.org/W2016455961,"Background Scleroderma is an autoimmune disease with a characteristic vascular pathology. The vasculopathy associated with scleroderma is one of the major contributors to the clinical manifestations of the disease. Methodology/Principal Findings We used immunohistochemical and mRNA in situ hybridization techniques to characterize this vasculopathy and showed with morphometry that scleroderma has true capillary rarefaction. We compared skin biopsies from 23 scleroderma patients and 24 normal controls and 7 scleroderma patients who had undergone high dose immunosuppressive therapy followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplant. Along with the loss of capillaries there was a dramatic change in endothelial phenotype in the residual vessels. The molecules defining this phenotype are: vascular endothelial cadherin, a supposedly universal endothelial marker required for tube formation (lost in the scleroderma tissue), antiangiogenic interferon α (overexpressed in the scleroderma dermis) and RGS5, a signaling molecule whose expression coincides with the end of branching morphogenesis during development and tumor angiogenesis (also overexpressed in scleroderma skin. Following high dose immunosuppressive therapy, patients experienced clinical improvement and 5 of the 7 patients with scleroderma had increased capillary counts. It was also observed in the same 5 patients, that the interferon α and vascular endothelial cadherin had returned to normal as other clinical signs in the skin regressed, and in all 7 patients, RGS5 had returned to normal. Conclusion/Significance These data provide the first objective evidence for loss of vessels in scleroderma and show that this phenomenon is reversible. Coordinate changes in expression of three molecules already implicated in angiogenesis or anti-angiogenesis suggest that control of expression of these three molecules may be the underlying mechanism for at least the vascular component of this disease. Since rarefaction has been little studied, these data may have implications for other diseases characterized by loss of capillaries including hypertension, congestive heart failure and scar formation."
https://openalex.org/W2160065587,"Chronic exposure to glucocorticoid hormones, resulting from either drug treatment or Cushing's syndrome, results in insulin resistance, central obesity, and symptoms similar to the metabolic syndrome. We hypothesized that the major metabolic effects of corticosteroids are mediated by changes in the key metabolic enzyme adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity. Activation of AMPK is known to stimulate appetite in the hypothalamus and stimulate catabolic processes in the periphery. We assessed AMPK activity and the expression of several metabolic enzymes in the hypothalamus, liver, adipose tissue, and heart of a rat glucocorticoid-excess model as well as in in vitro studies using primary human adipose and primary rat hypothalamic cell cultures, and a human hepatoma cell line treated with dexamethasone and metformin. Glucocorticoid treatment inhibited AMPK activity in rat adipose tissue and heart, while stimulating it in the liver and hypothalamus. Similar data were observed in vitro in the primary adipose and hypothalamic cells and in the liver cell line. Metformin, a known AMPK regulator, prevented the corticosteroid-induced effects on AMPK in human adipocytes and rat hypothalamic neurons. Our data suggest that glucocorticoid-induced changes in AMPK constitute a novel mechanism that could explain the increase in appetite, the deposition of lipids in visceral adipose and hepatic tissue, as well as the cardiac changes that are all characteristic of glucocorticoid excess. Our data suggest that metformin treatment could be effective in preventing the metabolic complications of chronic glucocorticoid excess."
https://openalex.org/W1987362442,"Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a pivotal role in pathology of diseases in the central nervous system (CNS), such as multiple sclerosis. However, the direct effect of IFN-gamma on neuronal cells has yet to be elucidated. We show here that IFN-gamma directly induces neuronal dysfunction, which appears as dendritic bead formation in mouse cortical neurons and enhances glutamate neurotoxicity mediated via alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic (AMPA) receptors but not N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. In the CNS, IFN-gamma receptor forms a unique, neuron-specific, calcium-permeable receptor complex with AMPA receptor subunit GluR1. Through this receptor complex, IFN-gamma phosphorylates GluR1 at serine 845 position by JAK1.2/STAT1 pathway, increases Ca(2+) influx and following nitric oxide production, and subsequently decreases ATP production, leading to the dendritic bead formation. These findings provide novel mechanisms of neuronal excitotoxicity, which may occur in both inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases in the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2065689875,"Venturia inaequalis is an ascomycete fungus responsible for apple scab, a disease that has invaded almost all apple growing regions worldwide, with the corresponding adverse effects on apple production. Monitoring and predicting the effectiveness of intervention strategies require knowledge of the origin, introduction pathways, and population biology of pathogen populations. Analysis of the variation of genetic markers using the inferential framework of population genetics offers the potential to retrieve this information.Here, we present a population genetic analysis of microsatellite variation in 1,273 strains of V. inaequalis representing 28 orchard samples from seven regions in five continents. Analysis of molecular variance revealed that most of the variation (88%) was distributed within localities, which is consistent with extensive historical migrations of the fungus among and within regions. Despite this shallow population structure, clustering analyses partitioned the data set into separate groups corresponding roughly to geography, indicating that each region hosts a distinct population of the fungus. Comparison of the levels of variability among populations, along with coalescent analyses of migration models and estimates of genetic distances, was consistent with a scenario in which the fungus emerged in Central Asia, where apple was domesticated, before its introduction into Europe and, more recently, into other continents with the expansion of apple growing. Across the novel range, levels of variability pointed to multiple introductions and all populations displayed signatures of significant post-introduction increases in population size. Most populations exhibited high genotypic diversity and random association of alleles across loci, indicating recombination both in native and introduced areas.Venturia inaequalis is a model of invasive phytopathogenic fungus that has now reached the ultimate stage of the invasion process with a broad geographic distribution and well-established populations displaying high genetic variability, regular sexual reproduction, and demographic expansion."

Here, we studied the role of selenoprotein T (SelT), a selenocysteine (Sec) -containing protein with no known function, which we have identified as a novel target gene of the neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) during PC12 cell differentiation. SelT was found to be ubiquitously expressed throughout embryonic development and in adulthood in rat. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that SelT is mainly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum through a hydrophobic domain. PACAP and cAMP induced a rapid and long-lasting increase in SelT gene expression in PC12 cells, in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. These results suggested a possible role of SelT in PACAP signaling during PC12 cell differentiation. Indeed, overexpression of SelT in PC12 cells provoked an increase in the concentration of intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) that was dependent on the Sec residue. Conversely, SelT gene knockdown inhibited the PACAP-induced increase in [Ca(2+)](i) and reduced hormone secretion. These findings demonstrate the implication of a selenoprotein in the regulation of Ca(2+) homeostasis and neuroendocrine secretion in response to a cAMP-stimulating trophic factor."
https://openalex.org/W2135016962,"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a major cause of invasive bacterial infections in newborns and certain adult populations. Surface filamentous appendages known as pili have been recently identified in GBS. However, little is known about the role of these structures in disease pathogenesis. In this study we sought to probe potential functional role(s) of PilB, the major GBS pilus protein subunit, by coupling analysis of an isogenic GBS pilB knockout strain with heterologous expression of the pilB gene in the nonpathogenic bacterium Lactococcus lactis. We found the knockout GBS strain that lacked PilB was more susceptible than wild-type (WT) GBS to killing by isolated macrophages and neutrophils. Survival was linked to the ability of PilB to mediate GBS resistance to cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides. Furthermore, the PilB-deficient GBS mutant was more readily cleared from the mouse bloodstream and less-virulent in vivo compared to the WT parent strain. Strikingly, overexpression of the pilB gene alone in L..."

Genome analyses of the unicellular, marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 identified three genes, denoted cpcS-I, cpcU, and cpcV, that were possible candidates to encode phycocyanobilin (PCB) lyases. Single and double mutant strains for cpcS-I and cpcU exhibited slower growth rates, reduced PBP levels, and impaired assembly of phycobilisomes, but a cpcV mutant had no discernable phenotype. A cpcS-I cpcU cpcT triple mutant was nearly devoid of PBP. SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry demonstrated that the cpcS-I and cpcU mutants produced an altered form of the phycocyanin (PC) β subunit, which had a mass ∼588 Da smaller than the wild-type protein. Some free PCB (mass = 588 Da) was tentatively detected in the phycobilisome fraction purified from the mutants. The modified PC from the cpcS-I, cpcU, and cpcS-I cpcU mutant strains was purified, and biochemical analyses showed that Cys-153 of CpcB carried a PCB chromophore but Cys-82 did not. These results show that both CpcS-I and CpcU are required for covalent attachment of PCB to Cys-82 of the PC β subunit in this cyanobacterium. Suggesting that CpcS-I and CpcU are also required for attachment of PCB to allophycocyanin subunits in vivo, allophycocyanin levels were significantly reduced in all but the CpcV-less strain. These conclusions have been validated by in vitro experiments described in the accompanying report (Saunée, N. A., Williams, S. R., Bryant, D. A., and Schluchter, W. M. (2008) J. Biol. Chem. 283, 7513-7522). We conclude that the maturation of PBP in vivo depends on three PCB lyases: CpcE-CpcF, CpcS-I-CpcU, and CpcT.

Paralogs of cpeS and cpeT were present in all PBP-containing cyanobacteria, were absent in organisms that do not synthesize PBP, and were encoded within operons with other PBP-related genes.

The amino acid sequence data of homologs of CpcS-I and CpeS proteins was obtained from the Integrated Microbial Genomes of the DOE Joint Genome Institute (img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/pub/main.cgi) and from Cyano-Base. Searches for protein homologs in databases were carried out with the blastP program at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/.

The cpcS-I cpcU cpcV mutant was constructed by transforming cpcS-I cpcU mutant cells with the cpcV::aadA construct described above and selecting for resistance to kanamycin, gentamicin, and spectinomycin (supplemental Fig. S1C, right panel). DNA Isolation and RNA Purification—Chromosomal DNA from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 wild-type and mutant strains was isolated as described previously (29Shen G.Z. Bryant D.A. Photosynth.

DNA sequencing was carried out at the Penn State Nucleic Acid Facility. Total RNA was extracted from cells harvested from liquid cultures of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 strains by using the Micro-to-Midi Total RNA Purification Kit from Invitrogen as described by the manufacturer. The procedure was modified to include the use of a bead-beater and glass beads to disrupt cells. The sample was incubated with RNase-free DNase I for 1 h at room temperature to remove contaminating DNA. RNA concentrations were determined by absorbance, and the absence of DNA in the RNA samples was confirmed by PCR analyses. The OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) was used to examine mRNA abundance by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). RT-PCR reactions were programmed with a 30-min reverse-transcription reaction at 50 °C, a 15-min initial heating step at 95 °C, and 35 three-step cycles (92 °C, 1 min; 55 °C, 1 min; and 72 °C, 1 min).

Concentrations were determined on the basis of equivalent cell numbers (equal A730 nm values). To measure cellular PBP contents, cells in late-exponential growth phase (A730 nm = 1.5–2.0) were collected and adjusted to 0.5 A730 nm per milliliter. The reduction in the PBP absorbance at 635 nm of liquid-culture samples that had been heated at 65 °C for 5 min was used to calculate the PBP content as described (34Zhao J. Brand J.J. Arch.

Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Keane, NH). The resulting membranes were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 CpcA, CpcB, or ApcB. Quantitation of PBP by Immunoblotting—To compare the PBP contents of cells, liquid cultures of wild-type and mutant strains of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, cells were grown to late-exponential phase, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Cells of the wild type and mutants were loaded at 0.08 A730 nm (corresponding to ∼1.1 × 107 cells) per lane as the 1× dilution. The wild-type cells were loaded at several further dilutions. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes as described above. Specific polypeptides were detected by using the polyclonal antibodies directed against the ApcB, CpcA, and CpcB proteins of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. The staining intensities of specific protein bands were measured using the program ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and were compared with the dilutions of the wild type to estimate the PBP contents of mutants. HPLC-Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometry (MS) was performed on a Quattro II-Z Mass Spectrometer (Micromass, Beverly, MA) equipped with LC10ADvp pumps (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD) and an HTC Pal autosampler (Leap Technologies, Carrboro, NC). The analyses were performed using electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive ion mode with a cone potential of 20 V, and spectra were acquired over m/z 500–20,000 at 3.6 s/scan. Proteins were separated by HPLC with a reverse-phase 1 × 150 mm BetaBasic C18-reverse-phase column (Keystone Scientific, Bellefonte, PA) and step water/isopropanol gradient (plus 0.15% formic acid). Comparative Bioinformatics Analysis—Paralogs of the CpeS and CpeT proteins of F. diplosiphon are found among the core set of proteins common to all cyanobacteria that produce PBSs, and most interestingly, paralogs occur in strains that do not synthesize PE (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S3).

Basal levels of oxidative stress can dramatically rise upon activation of the NADPH oxidase-dependent respiratory burst. To minimize ROS toxicity, prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms express a battery of low-molecular-weight thiol scavengers, a legion of detoxifying catalases, peroxidases, and superoxide dismutases, as well as a variety of repair systems. We present herein blockage of bacterial respiration as a novel strategy that helps the intracellular pathogen Salmonella survive extreme oxidative stress conditions. A Salmonella strain bearing mutations in complex I NADH dehydrogenases is refractory to the early NADPH oxidase-dependent antimicrobial activity of IFNγ-activated macrophages. The ability of NADH-rich, complex I-deficient Salmonella to survive oxidative stress is associated with resistance to peroxynitrite (ONOO-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Inhibition of respiration with nitric oxide (NO) also triggered a protective adaptive response against oxidative stress. Expression of the NDH-II dehydrogenase decreases NADH levels, thereby abrogating resistance of NO-adapted Salmonella to H2O2. NADH antagonizes the hydroxyl radical (OH·) generated in classical Fenton chemistry or spontaneous decomposition of peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH), while fueling AhpCF alkylhydroperoxidase.

Alternatively, reactive nitrogen species (RNS) generated through the interaction of NO with O2 and superoxide (O2·¯) indirectly mediate cytotoxicity of this diatomic radical. The autooxidation of NO with O2 gives rise to RNS such as NO2· and N2O3 with potent oxidative and nitrosative activity. Independently, NO reacts with O2·¯ to generate ONOO-, a species capable of oxidizing amino acids, [Fe-S] clusters, and DNA (6Pryor W.A. Squadrito G.L. Am. J.

Despite its well-documented pro-oxidant functions, low concentrations of NO can paradoxically be cytoprotective. NO has been shown to both prevent oxidative damage of cardiocytes undergoing ischemia reperfusion and lessen the oxidative stress endured by mammalian host cells exposed to a variety of inorganic or organic peroxides (8Johnson 3rd, G.

Investigations using prokaryotic microorganisms have elucidated several mechanisms by which NO protects against oxidative stress. In enteric bacteria, the OxyRS and SoxRS regulatory systems coordinate the expression of antioxidant defenses against H2O2 and O2·¯ (12Hidalgo E. Demple B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 13Aslund F. Zheng M. Beckwith J. Storz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6161-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). In addition to responding to oxyradicals, the [Fe-S] prosthetic group of SoxR and redox active cysteines of OxyR can be modified by NO, thereby activating a signal transduction cascade that stimulates transcription of antioxidant defenses such as Mn-superoxide dismutase, endonuclease IV, and hydroperoxidase I (14Nunoshiba T.

Alternatively, NO can trigger instant cytoprotection without evoking de novo protein synthesis. For instance, in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, NO promotes antioxidant defenses by: 1) depleting free cysteine and thus limiting the availability of a Fenton fuel and 2) enhancing H2O2 consumption through the activation of KatA catalase (17Gusarov I. Nudler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13855-13860Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The ETC transfers reducing equivalents from a variety of substrates to respiratory cytochrome oxidases for the reduction of O2 to H2O. Discrete enzymatic components of the ETC such as NADH dehydrogenases and cytochromes couple oxidoreduction reactions with transport of H+ across the membrane, generating a proton gradient that drives ATP biosynthesis by F0/F1 ATPases and energizes transporters and organelles assembled in the membrane. The collapse of membrane potential and the subsequent fall in ATP synthesis appear to underlie the pathological effects associated with persistent inactivation of ETC redox centers (5Beltran B. Mathur A. Duchen M.R. Erusalimsky J.D. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14602-14607Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 18Schweizer M. Richter C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Transient inhibition of respiration, on the other hand, can serve physiological roles by diverting O2 to alternative cellular and tissue usages (20Thomas D.D. Liu X. Kantrow S.P. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 21Trimmer B.A. Aprille J.R. Dudzinski D.M. Lagace C.J. Lewis S.M. Michel T. Qazi S. Zayas R.M. Science. 2001; 292: 2486-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the process of reducing quinones and pumping H+ across the membrane, NADH dehydrogenases comprising the ETC complex I consume NADH. We hypothesize herein that inhibition of ETC can serve additional physiological roles by conveying NADH reducing equivalents to an adaptive response that protects against oxidative stress. To test this idea, the cytotoxicity of a variety of oxidative stress conditions was assessed in: 1) a Salmonella strain bearing mutations in NDH-I (Δnuo::km) and -II (Δndh::FRT) complex I NADH dehydrogenases and 2) wild-type Salmonella in which the ETC was inactivated following exposure to RNS. Bacterial Strains—Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain ATCC 14028s was used throughout this study as the wild type and as the background for the construction of mutant strains (Table 1 and supplemental Table S1). Mutations of the Salmonella chromosome were constructed following the one-step, λred-mediated gene replacement method described by Datsenko and Wanner (22Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11049) Google Scholar). To ensure that the phenotypes of the ETC complex I mutant were specific to the lack of NADH dehydrogenases, Δnuo::km and Δndh::FRT mutations were complemented with the low copy number pWSK29 vector expressing a wild-type ndh allele under the control of its native promoter. Wild-type Salmonella strain AV0554 expresses ndh under the pBAD18 promoter. Stationary phase wild-type Salmonella was tested after 16 h of culture in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth. Because of a delayed lag phase, complex I-deficient Salmonella strain AV0436 was grown for 20 h.TABLE 1Bacterial strains and plasmidsGenotypeSourceStrains Salmonella typhimurium strain 14028sWild-typeATCC AV0201ΔspiC::FRT(24McCollister B.D.

Med. 2005; 202: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, periodate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), 15 mm Hepes, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich), and 100 units· ml-1/100 mg·ml-1 of penicillin/streptomycin (Cellgro) as described (24McCollister B.D. Bourret T.J. Gill R. Jones-Carson J. Vazquez-Torres A. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Selected groups of macrophages were treated with 200 units/ml of IFNγ (Invitrogen, St. Paul, MN) for 20 h before Salmonella infection. Macrophages were challenged with Salmonella at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2 and after 25 min of infection the medium replaced with RPMI+ medium containing 18 μg/ml gentamicin. The cells were lysed at the indicated time points after infection and percent surviving bacteria recorded on LB agar plates. Synthesis of ROS and RNS by Macrophages—Macrophages isolated as above were infected with Salmonella at an MOI of 10. The monolayers were washed after 15 min of infection and the medium replaced with RPMI+ medium containing 6 μg/ml gentamicin and 100 μm luminol. Luminol chemiluminescence was used as an indicator of ONOO- production (25Radi R. Cosgrove T.P. Beckman J.S. Freeman B.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) by Salmonella-infected, IFNγ-primed macrophages. Synthesis of H2O2 was assessed by the horseradish peroxidase-mediated, luminol-dependent chemiluminescence in a reaction that contained 20 units/ml horseradish peroxidase and 100 μm luminol. Chemiluminescence was recorded at 37 °C on an Lmax® luminometer (Molecular Devices) at 5-min intervals for 1 h with an integration time of 4 s. Susceptibility to RNS and ROS in Vitro—Stationary phase wild-type and ETC complex I mutant Salmonella grown overnight in LB broth as above were diluted in PBS at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml. The bacteria were incubated with 500 μm hypoxanthine (HX) (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1 units/ml xanthine oxidase (XO) (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN), 400 μm or 2.5 mm H2O2, or 750 μm ONOO- generator SIN1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The HX/XO system generated 0.4 and 0.5 μm/min of O2·¯ and H2O2 as estimated by superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c and horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of phenol red, respectively (26Vazquez-Torres A. Jones-Carson J. Mastroeni P. Ischiropoulos H. Fang F.C. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The contribution of O2·¯ and H2O2 to the antimicrobial activity of the XO/HX system was estimated by adding 300 units/ml Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase or 25 units/ml catalase (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively. Percent survival was calculated after various times of exposure by recording the number of bacteria able to form a colony on LB plates. Selected groups of wild-type bacteria diluted at a concentration of 107 cells/ml in EG medium (0.811 mm MgSO4, 9.52 mm citric acid, 57.41 K2HPO4, 16.74 mm Na(NH4)HPO4, and 0.4% glucose, pH 7.0) were pre-adapted for 1 h with 750 μm spermine NONOate or SIN1 in the presence of 15 μg/ml of the protein synthesis inhibitor chloramphenicol. Control and RNS-adapted cells were diluted in PBS and challenged for 2 h with 400 μm H2O2 in the presence of chloramphenicol. About 35 μm NO donor spermine NONOate and SIN1 remained during H2O2 challenge. NADH/NAD+ Quantification—NADH and NAD+ were extracted in 0.2 m NaOH and 0.2 m HCl, respectively, from overnight cultures of Salmonella grown in LB medium as described above. The concentration of NADH/NAD+ was measured by the thiazolyl tetrazolium blue cycling assay (27San K.Y. Bennett G.N. Berrios-Rivera S.J. Vadali R.V. Yang Y.T. Horton E. Rudolph F.B. Sariyar B. Blackwood K. Metab. Eng. 2002; 4: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and the concentration of nicotinamide was calculated by regression analysis of known standards. Nucleotide concentrations were corrected for bacterial density as estimated spectrophotometrically at A600, and the intracellular NADH concentration calculated based on a bacterial cell volume of 10-15 liters. Hydroxyl Radical Formation—Terephthalic acid was used to measure OH· via the fluorescence 2-hydroxyterephthalate adduct (λex = 315 nm; λem = 425 nm). The effect of NADH or NAD+ on the formation of 2-hydroxyterephthalate was monitored in a spectrofluorometer after the addition of 4 mm ONOO- into a solution of 2.5 mm of terephthalate in PBS, pH 7.0. Autofluorescence of NADH and NAD+ were subtracted from the final readings. Oxygen and H2O2 Consumption—Salmonella grown overnight in LB broth were cultured to 1 OD/ml in aerated EG medium, pH 7.0 at 37 °C. Consumption of oxygen and H2O2 was recorded with specific probes using a free radical analyzer (WPI Inc., Sarasota, FL). Selected samples were treated with the indicated concentrations of authentic ONOO- or 750 μm spermine NONOate or SIN1 1 min before analysis. Spectroscopy—Salmonella strain AV0429 lacking the cyo ubiquinol oxidase was grown overnight to stationary phase in LB broth. Inner membranes were prepared as described by Miller and Gennis (28Miller M.J. Gennis R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, bacterial pellets were resuspended in 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.5. The cells were lysed by passing the suspension through a French Press Cell Disruptor (Thermo Electron Corporation, Milford, MA) three times at 18,000 psi at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Cell debris were removed by centrifuging for 20 min at 10,000 × g in a Sorvall SL-50T rotor. The supernatant was centrifuged at 200,000 × g in a Beckman-type 70 Ti rotor for 1 h and the pellet solubilized in 75 mm potassium phosphate, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 60 mm N-dodecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propane sulfonate (Sigma) buffer, pH 6.4. The solution was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h. Supernatants containing inner membranes were collected, and the protein concentration assayed using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). The protein was adjusted to 1.5 mg/ml in 75 mm potassium phosphate, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm ascorbate, and 60 mm N-dodecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propane sulfonate buffer, pH 6.4. Absorbance spectroscopy was collected in a Cary 50 Bio UV-Visible spectrophotometer. Selected groups of proteins were treated with 100 μm spermine NONOate for 30 min before the absorption spectra were collected. The spermine base was used as a negative control. Complex I-deficient Salmonella Is Hyper-resistant to the Oxidative Stress Encountered within IFNγ-primed Macrophages—The complex I-deficient Salmonella strain AV0436 (Δnuo::km Δndh::FRT), but not isogenic strains bearing single mutations (not shown), was hyper-resistant to the antimicrobial activity of IFNγ-primed macrophages (Fig. 1a). A 100-fold survival advantage was manifested shortly after infection and lasted for at least 6 h, a period in which NADPH oxidase-dependent defenses prevail (26Vazquez-Torres A. Jones-Carson J. Mastroeni P. Ischiropoulos H. Fang F.C. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The intracellular advantage of strain AV0436 is specific to the lack of ETC NADH dehydrogenases because complementation with the low copy plasmid pNDH expressing the wild-type ndh allele restored susceptibility to macrophage oxidative killing (Fig. 1a). Survival of wild-type and complex I-deficient Salmonella was similar in gp91phox-/- macrophages unable to sustain a respiratory burst (Fig. 1b). Although to a lesser degree than defects in the NADPH oxidase, a mutation in the inducible NO synthase also ameliorated the early differences in intracellular survival between wild-type and complex I-deficient Salmonella. Together, these findings indicate that the lack of ETC NADH dehydrogenases not only protects Salmonella against host-derived oxyradicals but also lessens synergistic toxicity of ROS and NO congeners. Aerobic organisms exploit an assortment of mechanisms for detoxification or avoidance of ROS (29Fang F.C. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 820-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). The antioxidant repertoire is especially varied in intracellular pathogens residing within professional phagocytes capable of generating massive amounts of ROS in the NADPH oxidase-dependent respiratory burst. To test whether the hyper-resistance of complex I-deficient Salmonella might be related to the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI2) type III secretion system that ameliorates exposure of Salmonella to reactive species such as H2O2 and ONOO- (30Vazquez-Torres A. Xu Y. Jones-Carson J. Holden D.W. Lucia S.M. Dinauer M.C. Mastroeni P. Fang F.C. Science. 2000; 287: 1655-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 31Chakravortty D. Hansen-Wester I. Hensel M. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1155-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), a ΔspiC::FRT allelle that inactivates SPI2 secretion and effector functions (32Uchiya K. Barbieri M.A. Funato K.

Cell Microbiol. 2002; 4: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was combined with Δnuo::km Δndh::FRT alleles generating strain AV0441 (NDH-I- NDH-II- SPI2-). Strain AV0441 was as resistant to early macrophage oxidative killing as its complex I-deficient isogenic control (Fig. 1c). Poor NADPH oxidase-dependent killing of complex I-deficient Salmonella cannot be explained by reduced synthesis of ONOO- by IFNγ-primed macrophages (Fig. 1d). Moreover, unstimulated macrophages produced similar amounts of H2O2 in response to wild-type or complex I-deficient Salmonella (Fig. 1d). Salmonella to NADPH oxidase-mediated intracellular killing might be associated with resistance to ROS and RNS. Strain AV0436 was found to be refractory to the antimicrobial activity of the O2·¯/H2O2-generating HX/XO system (Fig. 2a). Catalase, but not Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase, abrogated the killing of wild-type Salmonella by HX/XO (Fig. 2b), suggesting that complex I-deficient Salmonella is resistant to H2O2. Supporting this notion, complex I-deficient bacteria survived exposure to authentic H2O2, becoming susceptible upon expression of the NDH-II-complementing pNDH plasmid (Fig. 2c). Analogous to the NADH-mediated potentiation of oxidative stress previously associated with respiratory arrest in rapidly growing Escherichia coli (35Pacelli R. Wink D.A. Cook J.A. Krishna M.C. DeGraff W. Friedman N. Tsokos M. Samuni A. Mitchell J.B. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1469-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 36Woodmansee A.N. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34055-34066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the log phase complex I-deficient Salmonella was susceptible to H2O2 (Fig. 2d). Because ONOO-, which is similarly formed in response to wild-type and complex I-deficient Salmonella (Fig. 1d), constitutes an intrinsic component of the early anti-Salmonella arsenal of IFNγ-treated macrophages (26Vazquez-Torres A. Jones-Carson J. Mastroeni P. Ischiropoulos H. Fang F.C. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 31Chakravortty D. Hansen-Wester I. Hensel M. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1155-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), the susceptibility of Salmonella strain AV0436 to the ONOO- generator SIN1 was also studied. As for H2O2, the viability of stationary phase, complex I-deficient Salmonella was unaffected after exposure to SIN1 (Fig. 2e). These data demonstrate that Salmonella lacking complex I of the ETC are resistant to a variety of biologically active peroxides. Antioxidant Activity of NADH—As anticipated, Salmonella strain AV0436 lacking NDH-I and NDH-II contained higher NADH/NAD+ ratios than wild-type controls (Fig. 3a). The intracellular concentration of NADH in wild-type and complex I-deficient bacteria were 167 and 484 μm, respectively, whereas their NAD+ levels were 885 and 887 μm. The complex I-deficient Salmonella complemented with the pNDH plasmid contained 206 μm NADH and 763 μm NAD+. NADH could serve antioxidant functions by enhancing peroxidatic activity of alkylhydroperoxidases (37Storz G. Jacobson F.S. Tartaglia L.A. Morgan R.W. Silveira L.A. Ames B.N. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2049-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 38Bryk R. Griffin P. Nathan C. Nature. 2000; 407: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, a ΔahpCF::FRT mutation deleting both subunits of the alkylhydroperoxidase reductase was combined with nuo:km and Δndh alleles inactivating NDH-I and NDH-II NADH dehydrogenases. The lack of ahpCF increased by 5- and 2-fold the killing of complex I-deficient Salmonella by 750 μm SIN1 or 400 μm H2O2, respectively (Fig. 3b). NADH may also provide direct antioxidant activity, because NADH was oxidized by ONOOH (Fig. 3c) and a combination of H2O2 and Fe2+ (Fig. 3d). In contrast, NADH was not consumed by ONOO- or H2O2 (Fig. 3c). Together, these data indicate that NADH can scavenge OH· derived from H2O2 and ONOOH. Accordingly, NADH, but not NAD+, prevented ONOOH-induced synthesis of hydroxyterephthalate (Fig. 3e), which is a specific signature of OH· (39Barreto J.C. Smith G.S. Strobel N.H. McQuillin P.A. Miller T.A. Life Sci. 1995; 56: PL89-PL96PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of the ETC by RNS Elicits an Adaptive Response against Oxidative Stress—Because defects in the ETC promote resistance of Salmonella to oxidative stress following exposure to a variety of ROS and RNS (Fig. 2), we tested whether the pharmacological blockage of respiration following NO treatment may also trigger an antioxidant adaptive response. As expected by its ability to inhibit metal centers of cytochromes of the ETC (35Pacelli R. Wink D.A. Cook J.A. Krishna M.C. DeGraff W. Friedman N. Tsokos M. Samuni A. Mitchell J.B. J. Exp.

Chem. 2002; 277: 34055-34066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), 750 μm NO donor spermine NONOate arrested Salmonella respiration (Fig. 4a). ONOO-, which has been shown to inhibit ETC complex I in mitochondria (4Cassina A. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), also inhibited the respiration of Salmonella (Fig. 4b). NO conferred instant cytoprotection against 2.5 mm (Fig. 4c) or 400 μm H2O2 (Fig. 4e). The protective effects were nonetheless transitory because the viability of NO-adapted Salmonella started to decline after 50 min of exposure to 2.5 H2O2 (Fig. 4c). The reversible nitrosylation of terminal cytochromes provides a mechanism for the transitory protective effects associated with NO. Because the bd-type ubiqu"
https://openalex.org/W2108656011,"The signal transduction pathways involved in neuronal death are not well understood. Neuroglobin (Ngb), a recently discovered vertebrate globin expressed predominantly in the brain, shows increased expression in neurons in response to oxygen deprivation and protects neurons from ischemic and hypoxic death. The mechanism of this neuroprotection is unclear. We examined the surface distribution of raft membrane microdomains in cortical neuron cultures during hypoxia using the raft marker cholera toxin B (CTx-B) subunit. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that hypoxia induces rapid polarization of somal membranes and aggregation of microdomains with the subjacent mitochondrial network. This signaling complex is formed well before neurons commit to die, consistent with an early role in death signal transduction. Neurons from Ngb-overexpressing transgenic (Ngb-Tg) mice do not undergo microdomain polarization or mitochondrial aggregation in response to, and are resistant to death from hypoxia. We link the protective actions of Ngb to inhibition of Pak1 kinase activity and Rac1-GDP-dissociation inhibitor disassociation, and inhibition of actin assembly and death-signaling module polarization."
https://openalex.org/W2106646079,"The mammalian neocortex is characterized as a six-layered laminar structure, in which distinct types of pyramidal neurons are distributed coordinately during embryogenesis. In contrast, no other vertebrate class possesses a brain region that is strictly analogous to the neocortical structure. Although it is widely accepted that the pallium, a dorsal forebrain region, is specified in all vertebrate species, little is known of the differential mechanisms underlying laminated or non-laminated structures in the pallium. Here we show that differences in patterns of neuronal specification and migration provide the pallial architectonic diversity. We compared the neurogenesis in mammalian and avian pallium, focusing on subtype-specific gene expression, and found that the avian pallium generates distinct types of neurons in a spatially restricted manner. Furthermore, expression of Reelin gene is hardly detected in the developing avian pallium, and an experimental increase in Reelin-positive cells in the avian pallium modified radial fiber organization, which resulted in dramatic changes in the morphology of migrating neurons. Our results demonstrate that distinct mechanisms govern the patterns of neuronal specification in mammalian and avian pallial development, and that Reelin-dependent neuronal migration plays a critical role in mammalian type corticogenesis. These lines of evidence shed light on the developmental programs underlying the evolution of the mammalian specific laminated cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2152642484,"Abstract Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a simple phospholipid derived from cell membranes that has extracellular signaling properties mediated by at least five G protein-coupled receptors referred to as LPA1–LPA5. In the nervous system, receptor-mediated LPA signaling has been demonstrated to influence a range of cellular processes; however, an unaddressed aspect of LPA signaling is its potential to produce specific secondary effects, whereby LPA receptor-expressing cells exposed to, or “primed,” by LPA may then act on other cells via distinct, yet LPA-initiated, mechanisms. In the present study, we examined cerebral cortical astrocytes as possible indirect mediators of the effects of LPA on developing cortical neurons. Cultured astrocytes express at least four LPA receptor subtypes, known as LPA1–LPA4. Cerebral cortical astrocytes primed by LPA exposure were found to increase neuronal differentiation of cortical progenitor cells. Treatment of unprimed astrocyte-progenitor cocultures with conditioned medium derived from LPA-primed astrocytes yielded similar results, suggesting the involvement of an astrocyte-derived soluble factor induced by LPA. At least two LPA receptor subtypes are involved in LPA priming, since the priming effect was lost in astrocytes derived from LPA receptor double-null mice (). Moreover, the loss of LPA-dependent differentiation in receptor double-null astrocytes could be rescued by retrovirally transduced expression of a single deleted receptor. These data demonstrate that receptor-mediated LPA signaling in astrocytes can induce LPA-dependent, indirect effects on neuronal differentiation."

The results of our studies shed new light on the previously unrecognized function of villin in the regulation of apoptosis in the gastrointestinal epithelium. The homeostatic balance between proliferation and apoptosis is essential for the intestinal epithelium to function as a physiological and structural barrier. Intestinal epithelial cells have a high rate of cell turnover accompanied by an equally high rate of apoptosis (1Hall P.A. Coates P.J. Ansari B. Hopwood D. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3569-3577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In human intestinal epithelium, it is estimated that ∼1010 cells are shed per day by a mechanism that involves apoptosis (2Potten C.S.

This normal apoptosis is essential for the hierarchical organization of the intestinal epithelium, and apoptotic epithelial cells have been detected both at the base of the crypt as well as at the villus tips of the small and large intestine (3Bullen T.F.

Defects in apoptosis are also associated with several gastrointestinal conditions, including villus atrophy, epithelial hyperplasia, loss of normal absorptive function, and increased risk of tumorigenesis. It is well documented that cells derived from colorectal cancer are more resistant to apoptosis, and transformation of colorectal epithelium to carcinoma is associated with progressive inhibition of apoptosis (4Bedi A. Pasricha P.J. Akhtar A.J. Barber J.P. Bedi G.C. Giardiello F.M. Zehnbauer B.A. Hamilton S.R. Jones R.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1811-1816PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pasricha P.J. Bedi A. O'Connor K.

Disruption of epithelial barrier function is associated with the pathogenesis of IBD, although it is not clear whether this is a causal defect or a result of severe inflammation. Evidence from animal and human studies has suggested that increased apoptosis in the intestinal epithelium contributes to the tissue damage and the severity of colonic inflammatory response (6Ellis R.E. Yuan J.Y. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar).

Patients with inflammatory gastrointestinal and renal diseases have been shown to have higher levels of serum villin as well as autoantibodies specific for villin (21Rimm D.L. Holland T.E.

More importantly, a decrease in the levels of villin expression in enterocytes from CD and UC relative to healthy controls has also been reported (22Kersting S. Bruewer M. Schuermann G. Klotz A.

In this study, using immunoelectron microscopy and immunogold labeling, the authors demonstrated a significant reduction in villin-labeling density in the microvilli of patients with CD and UC. The authors suggested that decreased villin levels in CD and UC relative to healthy controls may be related to disturbances in differentiation and maturation process in the gastrointestinal epithelium of patients with CD and UC. Likewise, in other inflammatory diseases such as chronic pancreatitis decreased villin expression has been reported (23Elsasser H.P. Kloppel G. Mannherz H.G. Flocke K. Kern H.F. Histochemistry. 1991; 95: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In one previous study it has been reported that the death probability was twice as high in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-treated villin-null mice compared with their wild-type littermates (24Ferrary E. Cohen-Tannoudji M. Pehau-Arnaudet G. Lapillonne A. Athman R. Ruiz T. Boulouha L. El Marjou F. Doye A. Fontaine J.J. Antony C. Babinet C. Louvard D. Jaisser F. Robine S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), although no explanation was provided for this observation nor was the specific molecular mechanism identified. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that the villin-null mice have higher levels of apoptosis compared with their wild-type littermates that correlate with the severity of colitis induced in DSS-treated villin-null mice. Furthermore, in vitro experiments allowed us to characterize villin as an epithelial cell-specific anti-apoptotic protein. Together, these studies identify villin as a new epithelial cell-specific anti-apoptotic gene and provide a molecular mechanism for the role of villin in regulating epithelial cellular plasticity related to cell injury.

HeLa cells stably transfected with cytochrome c-GFP were a kind gift from Dr. D. R. Green (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). The villin knock-out mice were a generous gift from Dr. D. Gumucio (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Villin Knock-out Mice and DSS Treatment—Villin null mice were generated as described previously by injecting C57BL/6J blastocysts, and male offspring with >70% agouti coat color were bred to C57BL/6J female mice (25Pinson K.I. Dunbar L. Samuelson L. Gumucio D.L. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 211: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Genotypes of pups were determined by PCR also as described previously (25Pinson K.I. Dunbar L. Samuelson L. Gumucio D.L. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 211: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A 3% (w/v) solution of DSS (Mr 40,000-50,000) was prepared in water. DSS was administered either for 3 consecutive days or 7 consecutive days followed by euthanasia. Control mice received distilled water ad libitum. Because of the severity of colitis in the villin-null group, our study was limited to a maximum of 7 days of DSS treatment. Eight wild-type or villin-null mice were analyzed in each group. The damage and inflammation induced by DSS treatment were evaluated in a blinded fashion. Three sections were evaluated, each at a distance of ∼100 μm from the distal third of the colon. Mice were scored individually, and each score represented the mean of three sections. Colons were assigned a grade according to the percentage of colon affected with crypt damage as described before and as follows: grade 0 corresponds to normal epithelial morphology and no infiltrate; grade 1 corresponds to 1-25% of the colon affected with loss of the bottom fourth of the crypts and focal inflammatory cell infiltration; grade 2 corresponds to 26-50% of the colon affected with loss of the bottom half of crypts and inflammatory cell infiltration; grade 3 corresponds to 51-75% of the colon affected with loss of the bottom two-thirds of the crypt and greater than 50% of the epithelium with significant inflammatory cell infiltration, gland dropout, and crypt abscess; grade 4 corresponds to >75% of the colon affected with loss of the entire crypt and surface epithelium (26Ohkawara T.

Apoptosis was measured by counting TUNEL-positive nuclei as well as histologically in hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of the colon in 100 epithelial cells per high power field, and a total of three fields were counted per section of mouse colon (i.e. cecum, proximal, and distal colon). Cell Culture and Treatment—Full-length human villin was cloned in pTRE-HA as described previously (17Tomar A. Wang Y. Kumar N. George S. Ceacareanu B. Hassid A. Chapman K.E. Aryal A.M. Waters C.M.

To repress the expression of villin gene, cells were cultured in the presence of 10 ng/ml doxycycline. We have previously demonstrated the induction of villin following doxycycline withdrawal and shown the absence of villin in the MDCK and HeLa Tet-Off cells in the presence of doxycycline (16Tomar A.

In addition, IEC-6 cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing full-length human villin protein as described previously (19Wang Y. Tomar A. George S.P. Khurana S. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C1775-C1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To induce cell death, cells were treated with camptothecin (20 μm), staurosporine (1 μm), a combination of TNF-α (10 ng/ml) and cycloheximide (10 ng/ml), or serum-starved for 72 h. Apoptosis Assay—An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantitate DNA fragmentation in MDCK cells as described before (16Tomar A. George S. Kansal P. Wang Y. Khurana S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31972-31986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in 12-well plates, lysed, and centrifuged to isolate nuclei. Nuclei-free supernatant was incubated with anti-histone biotin and anti-DNA peroxidase-conjugated antibody in 96-well streptavidin-coated plates for 2 h. 100 μl of peroxidase substrate (2,2′-azino-di(3-ethylbenozothiazoline sulfonate) was added and incubated for an additional 10 min at room temperature. Absorbance was recorded at 405 nm using a microplate reader. DNA fragmentation was measured as absorbance units per mg of protein per min and expressed as fold increase in apoptotic cell death compared with cells expressing no villin (control). Cell morphologic analysis was done using bright field images. To assess DNA cleavage, hypotonic propidium iodide (PI) method was used as described elsewhere (31Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4431) Google Scholar). The PI fluorescence intensity was measured using an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with an Enterprise II dual argon/UV laser. Cell viability was also measured using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay by quantitation of ATP levels as a measure of metabolically active cells. An ATP standard curve was generated using 1 μm ATP in culture medium. Apoptotic nuclei were identified with Hoechst 33258 (10 ng/ml, for 10 min at 37 °C). A colorimetric protease assay was used to detect activities of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9. The assay is based on the spectrophotometric detection of the chromophore pNA after cleavage from the labeled substrate p-nitroanilide (pNA) (Ac-DEVD-pNA for caspase-3, Ac-IETD-pNA for caspase-8, and Ac-LEHD-pNA for caspase-9). The light emission of pNA was quantified using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad) at 405 nm. To confirm that caspases were involved in camptothecin-induced cell death, caspase inhibition assay was performed using pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk (50 μm), and a caspase-9-specific inhibitor, Ac-LEHD-CHO (50 μm), solubilized in Me2SO. Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—TMRM was used to obtain semi-quantitative estimates of changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) as described previously (32Budd S.L. Tenneti L. Lishnak T. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6161-6166Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Villin-null and villin-expressing MDCK cells cultured in chamber slides at a density of 3 × 105 cells and treated without or with camptothecin (20 μm) were incubated with TMRM (150 μm, 10 min). Time lapse images were collected every 5 min for a total of 3 h using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 5 PASCAL; Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) with excitation at 558 nm and emission at 583 nm. Carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone (FCCP, 1 μm) was used as a positive control to depolarize mitochondria following camptothecin treatment. Loss of ΔΨm was visualized as a reduction in the fluorescence signal. Live Cell Imaging of Cytochrome c Release—HeLa cells were stably transfected with cytochrome c-GFP as described before (33Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Cerulean-tagged villin was cloned as described previously (34George S.P. Wang Y. Mathew S. Srinivasan K. Khurana S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26528-26541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). HeLa GFP-cytochrome c cells were transiently transfected with cerulean-tagged villin, treated with 1 μm staurosporine for 0-5 h, and live cell images captured at different time points (0-5 h) using confocal laser scanning microscope and a 63× oil objective (LSM 5 PASCAL; Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). For GFP-cytochrome c an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission wavelength of 505 nm and for cerulean-villin an excitation wavelength of 458 nm and emission wavelength of 474 nm were used. Representative individual cell images were processed using MetaMorph software. Preparation of Mitochondria-free Cytosolic Fractions—This assay was performed essentially as described by Waterhouse et al. (35Waterhouse N.J. Goldstein J.C. von Ahsen O. Schuler M. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 10 min in 200 μl of ice-cold buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 80 mm KCl, and 200 μg/ml digitonin. The cells were pelleted (1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant containing the cytosolic protein was obtained. The pellets were incubated in buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.3% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitor mixture at 4 °C for 10 min and centrifuged (10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant containing the mitochondrial fraction was obtained. 45 μg of protein from each sample was separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting using antibodies against cytochrome c and VDAC. Equal loading was ensured by probing the same blot with monoclonal anti-actin antibody. Immunohistochemical Staining—Mice were sacrificed, and the colon was removed and fixed in 3.7% formalin. Paraffin-embedded sections of 5-μm thickness were prepared, and hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed. Endogenous peroxidase was inactivated by 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 min. TUNEL staining was performed on paraffin sections using an in situ cell death detection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. A negative control lacking the TUNEL reaction mixture was included in each assay. For villin staining, paraffin-embedded tissues were also deparaffinized in xylene for 10 min, followed by 5 min each in serial dilutions of ethanol (100, 95, and 75%). After antigen retrieval, sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-villin antibody at 1:1000 dilution. For the amplification of signals, Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-mouse antibody was applied to the slides for 1 h at room temperature, followed by three washes in TBS (100 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). Hoechst 33258 was used for nuclear staining. Negative control studies were done by incubating samples without the primary antibody. Villin-null Mice Demonstrate Increased Epithelial Cell Apoptosis and Are More Sensitive to DSS-induced Injury—In an effort to examine the in vivo function of villin in intestinal epithelial cell injury, we elected to treat villin-null mice and their wild-type littermates with established protocols to induce DSS-induced colitis, namely 3% DSS dissolved in sterile, distilled drinking water fed ad libitum. Control mice were fed sterile, distilled drinking water. This procedure is known to induce colonic epithelial injury in mice following five cycles of 7 days each of DSS treatment (36Mashimo H. Wu D.C. Podolsky D.K. Fishman M.C. Science. 1996; 274: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 37Okayasu I. Hatakeyama S. Yamada M. Ohkusa T. Inagaki Y. Nakaya R. Gastroenterology. 1990; 98: 694-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows confocal analysis of immunohistochemical staining of ileal tissue from wild-type (WT) and villin-/- (VKO) mice with anti-villin antibody. Villin expression is noted in epithelial cells along the crypt-villi axis in the WT mice but not in the VKO mice. Before DSS treatment, both wild-type as well as villin-null mice had normal stools that were heme-negative (data not shown). Occult blood and rectal bleeding was first detected in some villin-null mice as early as 4 days post-treatment and in all villin-null mice by day 7. Rectal bleeding was never seen in the wild-type mice by day 7 of DSS treatment. Our studies were limited to a maximum of 7 days of DSS treatment because of the severe injury and rectal bleeding noted in the villin-null mice by day 7. In control mice, in the absence of any treatment, the morphology of the colon was very similar in both villin-null mice as well as their wild-type littermates (supplemental Fig. 1A). In villin-null mice receiving DSS, the most severe ulcerative lesions were consistently found in the distal colon and very often in the proximal colon (data not shown). In wild-type mice, the lesions were more restricted, confined only to the distal colon and were generally much less severe (Fig. 1B). It may be noted that more severe lesions were noted in the wild-type littermates following 13 consecutive days of DSS treatment, consistent with this model of injury (data not shown). However, the villin-null mice do not survive such long exposures to DSS. There was some loss of the epithelial layer and limited infiltration of inflammatory cells in the wild-type mice. In contrast, in the villin-null cells there was almost complete loss of the epithelium by day 7 of DSS treatment, disappearance of mucosal crypts, and significant increase in infiltration of inflammatory cells, including neutrophils and lymphocytes, thickening and severe edema of the muscularis, glandular atrophy, and fibrosis (Fig. 1B). The colons were also assigned a grade consistent with the percentage of colon affected with crypt damage as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 1C most villin-null mice demonstrated a grade close to 3, indicating that ∼75% of the crypts was damaged in these mice by day 7 of DSS treatment. Body weight changes (shown as percentage change from base-line body weight on day 0) are shown in Fig. 1D. There was significant weight loss between days 5 and 7 in villin-null mice compared with wild-type littermates following DSS treatment. The onset of rectal bleeding corresponded closely to the development of weight loss in villin-null mice. In contrast, the wild-type mice showed very limited clinical symptoms of UC on day 7. We hypothesized that the absence of villin may result in increased apoptosis in DSS-treated mice and further that this increase in apoptosis possibly preceded the development of ulcerative lesions in the villin-null mice. To assess the levels of apoptosis in wild-type and villin-null mice after DSS treatment, we used the TUNEL assay to measure the response to DSS treatment. As shown in Fig. 2, villin-null mice showed a significant increase in apoptosis relative to littermate control wild-type mice at day 3 in mice receiving DSS. The absence of villin was associated with an enhanced DNA fragmentation as recorded by the TUNEL assay (Fig. 2, A and B; p < 0.01, n = 5, denoted by arrowheads) as well as enhanced activation of caspase-3 in the epithelium following DSS treatment (Fig. 2C; denoted by arrowheads). Apoptotic cells were also noted histologically in hematoxylin and eosin sections of proximal and distal colon of wild-type and villin-null mice and the data correlated with the TUNEL assay. There was no significant difference in the number of apoptotic cells between villin-null and wild-type mice in untreated control animals (data not shown). This marked increase in apoptosis in villin-null mice occurred early in the course of DSS treatment (day 3). The increased apoptotic signal was localized largely to the surface epithelial cells, which include mostly differentiated epithelial cells. This is consistent w"

CpcS-I copurified with His6-tagged (HT) CpcU as a heterodimer, CpcSU. When CpcSU was assayed for bilin lyase activity in vitro with phycocyanobilin (PCB) and apophycocyanin, the reaction product had an absorbance maximum of 622 nm and was highly fluorescent (λmax = 643 nm). In control reactions with PCB and apophycocyanin, the products had absorption maxima at 635 nm and very low fluorescence yields, indicating they contained the more oxidized mesobiliverdin (Arciero, D. M., Bryant, D. A., and Glazer, A. N. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 18343–18349). Tryptic peptide mapping showed that the CpcSU-dependent reaction product had one major PCB-containing peptide that contained the PCB binding site Cys-82. The CpcSU lyase was also tested with recombinant apoHT-allophycocyanin (aporHT-AP) and PCB in vitro. AporHT-AP formed an ApcA/ApcB heterodimer with an apparent mass of ∼27 kDa. When aporHT-AP was incubated with PCB and CpcSU, the product had an absorbance maximum of 614 nm and a fluorescence emission maximum at 636 nm, the expected maxima for monomeric holo-AP. When no enzyme or CpcS-I or CpcU was added alone, the products had absorbance maxima between 645 and 647 nm and were not fluorescent. When these reaction products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and zinc-enhanced fluorescence emission, only the reaction products from CpcSU had PCB attached to both AP subunits. Therefore, CpcSU is the bilin lyase-responsible for attachment of PCB to Cys-82 of CpcB and Cys-81 of ApcA and ApcB. The Synechococcus sp.

The products of two genes, cpcE and cpcF, which occur downstream of the cpcBA structural genes that encode the β and α subunits of PC, respectively, comprise a heterodimeric lyase that specifically attaches PCB to Cys-84 of α-PC (CpcA) (13Zhou J.

PCC 7120. The PBS core linker, also known as LCM or ApcE, contains a PBP-like domain at its N terminus that is related in sequence to all other PBP but has the Cys residue for PCB attachment at a structurally distinct position (5Bryant D.A.

Scheer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1706: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have shown that PCB addition to ApcE can occur in the absence of lyases in vitro, although it is currently not known if this also occurs in vivo. Moreover, PCB addition to ApcA (α-AP) may not require a lyase when the protein is synthesized in Escherichia coli cells that co-express apcA and the genes required to synthesize PCB from heme (30Hu I.C. Lee T.R. Lin H.F. Chiueh C.C. Lyu P.C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7092-7099Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). When purified HT-ApcA and PCB were combined in vitro, PCB addition occurred, and the resulting product was reported to have an absorption spectrum that matched that of native holo-AP subunits (30Hu I.C. Lee T.R. Lin H.F. Chiueh C.C. Lyu P.C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7092-7099Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In some studies in which no requirement for lyases was reported, detergents or urea were added to modify the conformation of the PBP, the bilin, or both (29Zhao K.H. Su P. Bohm S. Song B. Zhou M.

We have used a combination of reverse genetics and biochemical methods to identify and characterize the PCB lyases of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. In an accompanying manuscript (25Shen G. Schluchter W.M. Bryant D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7503-7512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we have presented strong evidence that null mutants for cpcS-I and cpcU define a heterodimeric PCB lyase that attaches PCB to Cys-82 of β-PC. The characterization of these mutants also suggested that CpcS-I and CpcU are required for PCB attachment to Cys-81 of the α and β subunits of AP (23Shen G. Saunee N.A. Gallo E. Begovic Z. Schluchter W.M. Bryant D.A. Niederman R.A. Blankenship R.E. Frank H. Robert B. van Grondelle R. Photosynthesis 2004 Light-Harvesting Systems Workshop, August 26–29, 2004.

In the studies presented here, the conclusions from these reverse genetics analyses are validated in vitro, and we show that CpcS-I and CpcU form a 1:1 heterodimer that attaches PCB to Cys-82 of β-PC. Neither CpcS-I nor CpcU alone is able to perform this lyase reaction. Additionally, we show that these two proteins are also required for correct attachment of PCB to the α and β subunits of AP in vitro. Construction of Recombinant Expression Plasmids—The cpcS-I gene was amplified by PCR from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 chromosomal DNA using primers 7002cpcS5 (5′-AATTTTTCCATATGCAAAGCTTTGCGGATGCC-3′) and 7002cpcS3 (5′-TTGACTCGAGCAACACGGATATCTCTGTGGG-3′). The PCR product was cloned into pAED4 T7 expression vector using the restriction enzymes NdeI and XhoI (underlined in the primer sequences). The cpcU gene was amplified by PCR from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 chromosomal DNA using two primers (7002cpcU5, 5′-GTAACTGTTCATATGGATATCAATGCCTTTATCC-3′; 7002cpcU3, 5′-CTAAAAGCTTTCGTTAGTTACTGGCTTCAGCGG-3′). The PCR product was cloned into pBS150v vector using NdeI and HindIII (underlined in the primer sequences). The pBS150v vector includes a His6 tag for easy purification of the protein. The cpcV gene was amplified by PCR using primers 7002cpcV5 (5′-GCTCTTCGCATATGAATTTACTTGCGAC-3′) and 7002cpcV3 (5′-TTTAAGCTTACTAAAGACGCGTTTCTAAATACTGCGC-3′). After PCR amplification, the cpcV gene was cloned into vectors pAED4 and pBS150v using restriction enzymes NdeI and HindIII (underlined in the primer sequences). The cpcB and cpcA genes were cloned into pAED4 as described (24Shen G. Saunée N.A. Williams S.R. Gallo E.F. Schluchter W.M. Bryant D.A. J. Biol.

Keck Conservation and Molecular Genetics laboratory (University of New Orleans) to confirm that no unwanted mutations had been introduced. Protein Overexpression and Purification—Expression plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21 DE3 cells, and colonies were selected on Luria Bertani plates in the presence of ampicillin (100 μg ml–1) or spectinomycin (100 μg ml–1). For expression of cpcS-I, cpcU, and cpcV, cells from a 50-ml starter culture were added to 1 liter of Luria-Bertani medium with the appropriate antibiotic and grown for 4 h. Cells harboring plasmids encoding cpcS-I or cpcV were grown at 30 °C, whereas those encoding cpcU were grown at 37 °C. Production of proteins was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. Cells were incubated with shaking for another 4 h before cells were harvested by centrifugation, and pellets were frozen at –20 °C until required. Purification of rCpcBA and aporHT-AP was performed as described (24Shen G. Saunée N.A. Williams S.R. Gallo E.F. Schluchter W.M. Bryant D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17768-17778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To purify CpcS-I, cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and lysed by three passages through a chilled French pressure cell at 138 megapascals. The lysed cell suspension was centrifuged for 25 min at 17,000 × g to remove unbroken cells and inclusion bodies. The supernatant was brought to 40% saturation with ammonium sulfate and left at 4 °C overnight. After centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 20 min, the pellet containing the CpcS-I protein was resuspended in a small amount and dialyzed exhaustively against the same buffer to remove the ammonium sulfate. Aliquots (10 ml) of the CpcS-I (pI 4.79) solution were loaded onto a DEAE column (Whatman DE-52: 2.5 × 12.5 cm) that had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm NaN3 (buffer 1; sodium azide was added to prevent microbial growth during storage of the column/buffer) by using the BioLogic LP system at room temperature (Bio-Rad). The column was developed using the same procedure described for CpcT (24Shen G. Saunée N.A. Williams S.R. Gallo E.F. Schluchter W.M. Bryant D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17768-17778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Fractions containing CpcS-I were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. CpcS-I was concentrated using an Amicon YM-10 concentrator and stored in 2-ml aliquots at ×20 °C until required. The CpcS-I protein has a calculated molecular mass of 22,526.3 Da. Antibodies were raised against the CpcS-I protein present in inclusion bodies. Inclusion bodies were washed as described in Fairchild et al. (15Fairchild C.D. Zhao J. Zhou J. Colson S.E. Bryant D.A. Glazer A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and CpcS-I was purified by preparative SDS-PAGE on a 15% (w/v) acrylamide gel. The band corresponding to CpcS-I was excised and minced, and protein was electroeluted from the gel slices using a procedure recommended by Sigma Genosys, who generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the protein. Because CpcU is produced with an N-terminal His6 tag, it was purified by metal affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). E. coli cells containing HTCpcU were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl (buffer 0) and lysed by three passages through a chilled French pressure cell at 138 megapascals. After clarification of the extract by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 25 min, the supernatant was added to 10 ml of Ni-NTA resin that had been washed with buffer 0. The resin and the extracts were incubated together for 15 min and then loaded into a column. The column was washed as described in Shen et al. (24Shen G. Saunée N.A. Williams S.R. Gallo E.F.

The HT-CpcU protein has a calculated molecular mass of 23,471.71 Da. The HT-CpcV protein was purified in the same manner and had a molecular mass of 22,728.2 Da. CpcV (non-tagged; calculated molecular mass of 19,851.3 Da) was not purified; whole cell extracts containing CpcV were used in some enzyme assays. Interaction Assays—A pulldown interaction assay was performed to determine whether HT-CpcU and CpcS-I interacts in vitro. An aliquot (50 μl) of E. coli whole-cell extract containing HT-CpcU was mixed with a whole-cell extract (50 μl) containing CpcS-I, and the solution was incubated on ice for 15 min. The Ni-NTA resin (150 μl) was pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 4 min. The supernatant was discarded, and 500 μl of buffer 0 was added. The resin was pelleted again under the same conditions, and the supernatant was discarded. The protein solution was then added to the washed resin and incubated for 30 min with gentle agitation. The mixture was then centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 × g. The supernatant was discarded, and 500 μl of buffer A1 was added, and the resin was pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 3000 × g. The same procedure was followed for buffer B and buffer A2 (as described in Shen et al. (24Shen G. Saunée N.A. Williams S.R. Gallo E.F. Schluchter W.M. Bryant D.A. J. Biol.

For purification of large amounts of the CpcSU complex, whole cell extracts containing each subunit were incubated together on ice for 1 h, and then the complexes were purified using metal affinity chromatography in the same way as described above for HT-CpcU.

https://openalex.org/W2035464887,"Peters Plus syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by anterior eye chamber defects, disproportionate short stature, developmental delay, and cleft lip and/or palate. It is caused by splice site mutations in what was thought to be a β1,3-galactosyltransferase-like gene (B3GALTL). Recently, we and others found this gene to encode a β1,3-glucosyltransferase involved in the synthesis of the disaccharide Glc-β1,3-Fuc-O-that occurs on thrombospondin type 1 repeats of many biologically important proteins. No functional tests have been performed to date on the presumed glycosylation defect in Peters Plus syndrome. We have established a sensitive immunopurification-mass spectrometry method, using multiple reaction monitoring, to analyze O-fucosyl glycans. It was used to compare the reporter protein properdin from Peters Plus patients with that from control heterozygous relatives. In properdin from patients, we could not detect the Glc-β1,3-Fuc-O-disaccharide, and we only found Fuc-O-at all four O-fucosylation sites. In contrast, properdin from heterozygous relatives and a healthy volunteer carried the Glc-β1,3-Fuc-O-disaccharide. These data firmly establish Peters Plus syndrome as a new congenital disorder of glycosylation.

Recently, Lesnik Oberstein et al. (3Lesnik Oberstein S.A. Kriek M. White S.J. Kalf M.E. Szuhai K. den Dunnen J.T. Breuning M.H. Hennekam R.C. Am. J. Hum.

The characteristic features of this disorder include anterior eye chamber defects, disproportionate short stature, developmental delay, and cleft lip and/or palate (5Maillette de Buy Wenniger-Prick L.J. Hennekam R.C.M. Ann. Genet. 2002; 45: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Peters Plus syndrome was classified as a putative CDG (2Jaeken J. Matthijs G. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2007; 8: 261-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), because it is not known whether the mutations affect a specific enzymatic activity or cause the formation of a defective glycan structure.In the meantime, we and others (6Sato T.

TSRs are independent folding modules of ∼60 amino acids in length that contain three disulfide bonds and a core consisting of alternating tryptophan and arginine residues. The human genome encodes ∼100 TSR-containing proteins that perform a variety of important biological functions, including regulation of the coagulation system by proteolysis, inhibition of angiogenesis, and cell and axon guidance (12Tucker R.P.

Subsequently, β3Glc-T transfers the glucose onto TSR-fucose. A number of studies have addressed the importance of O-fucosylation. We have recently demonstrated that an enzymatically inactive POFUT2 gene in Caenorhabditis elegans results in abnormal distal tip cell migration and shape of the gonad (13Canevascini S. Kozma K.

Both POFUT2 and β3Glc-T are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (7Kozma K. Keusch J.J. Hegemann B. Luther K.B. Klein D. Hess D. Haltiwanger R.S. Hofsteenge J. J. Biol.

Abolishing O-fucosylation causes a diminished secretion of ADAMTS-like 1 and ADAMTS-13 in cell culture experiments (10Wang L.W. Dlugosz M. Somerville R.P. Raed M. Haltiwanger R.S. Apte S.S. J. Biol.

Therefore, it has been proposed that O-fucosylation plays a role in the quality control of folding in the early part of the secretory pathway, possibly by tagging properly folded protein.An alternative O-fucosylation pathway operates on proteins that contain epidermal growth factor-like repeats (15Haltiwanger R.S. Stanley P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The first step is catalyzed by POFUT1, which is followed by extension of the fucose by Fringe, a β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase. Further elongation by β4-galactosyltransferase 1 and a sialyltransferase yields the tetrasaccharide NeuAcα2,6Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,3Fuc-α1-O- (16Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L.

It is important to note that the enzymes of the two pathways are specific for either TSRs or epidermal growth factor-like repeats and do not cross-react (6Sato T. Sato M. Kiyohara K. Sogabe M.

More recently, it has become apparent that the use of mass spectrometry (MS) provides the needed detailed information to unravel the complexity of some of these disorders (19Wada Y. J. Chromatogr. 2006; 838: 3-8Google Scholar, 20Hülsmeier A.J. Paesold-Burda P. Hennet T. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; 6: 2132-2138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To investigate the putative glycosylation defect in Peters Plus syndrome, a suitable protein that contains TSRs is required. We have developed a sensitive immunopurification-MS method that detects the O-fucosyl glycans in the reporter protein properdin, the positive regulator of complement. Comparison of patient and control samples shows that in patients that carry the exon 8-skipping mutation in the gene encoding β3Glc-T, the glucosyl residue is missing at all four properdin O-fucosylation sites.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Monoclonal anti-properdin antibody HYB039-06 and goat anti-human properdin were purchased from the Antibody Shop, Gentofte, Denmark. MagnaBind carboxylated derivatized beads were from Pierce. Properdin was obtained from Complement Technology, Inc., Tyler, TX, and its concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm, using the extinction coefficient provided by the manufacturer (A1%280 = 17.8). Trypsin was from Promega.Patients—Blood was drawn and collected in a coagulation tube and serum obtained by centrifugation from Peters Plus patients, their parents, and a healthy control. The samples are from seven individuals (numbered 1–7, see Table 1). Individual 1 is a healthy control. Individuals 4 and 5 are two brothers with Peters Plus syndrome that are compound heterozygous for the c.660 + 1G→ A exon 8 donor splice site mutation in the B3GALTL on the paternal allele and a ∼1.5-Mb 13q12.3q13.1, B3GALTL including deletion on the maternal allele. Their healthy parents are individuals 2 and 3 and are heterozygous for the respective mutations in their sons. Individuals 6 and 7 have Peters Plus syndrome and are not related to each other or the other patients. Both are homozygous for the c.660 + 1G→ A exon 8 donor splice-site mutation. The project was approved by the ethical committee of the Leiden University Medical Center, and written and oral informed consent were given by each individual or his/her legal guardian.TABLE 1Characteristics of the individuals examined in this studyIndividualaAll individuals were of Dutch origin; individuals 2-5 were from the same family.SexB3GALTL mutationsbData are from Lesnik Oberstein et al.

Open table in a new tab Properdin ELISA—Nunc Maxisorp 96-well microtiter plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl per well of 2 μg/ml monoclonal antibody HYB039-06 in bicarbonate buffer (50 mm Na2CO3, 117 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6, 10 mm NaN3). At this point, and between all other additions of protein, the plates were washed three times with TBS-T (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween 20). Unbound sites were blocked with 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, containing 1% bovine serum albumin (buffer A) for 1 h at 37°C. One hundred microliters of serum samples diluted 1:500, 1:1000, and 1:5000 in buffer A or 100 μl of standard human properdin (0.6–80 ng/ml buffer A) were added in duplicate for 2.5 h at 37 °C. The plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 100 μl of goat anti-human properdin diluted 1:5000 in buffer A. Donkey F(ab′)2 anti-goat IgG-peroxidase (100 μl; Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:15,000 in TBS-T was added for 1 h at 37°C. After the last wash, the plates were rinsed with TBS and developed with 100μl of FAST o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma). The reaction was stopped with 50 μl of 1 n H2SO4 and the absorbance read at 490 nm.Immunopurification of Properdin—Monoclonal anti-properdin antibodies were coupled to MagnaBind carboxylated derivatized beads using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide at a concentration of 2.7 mg/ml, following the manufacturer's instructions. Two hundred microliters of serum were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 10 μl of washed antibody beads overnight on a roller shaker in LoBind Eppendorf tubes. The beads were washed with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, transferred to a clean tube, washed with 4 × 200 μl of TBS, 3 × 200 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 3 m NaCl, pH 7.5, 200 μl of TBS, 2 × 200 μl of TBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 3 × 200 μl of TBS, transferred to a clean tube, and eluted with 20 μl of 0.1 m Gly-HCl, pH 2.5. The eluate was immediately neutralized with 2 μl of Tris base. Purified protein was stored at 4 °C.Peptide Mapping and Mass Spectrometry—Preliminary experiments revealed that in-gel tryptic digests of properdin did not yield the relevant glycopeptides (data not shown), which necessitated an in-solution digestion approach. Purified properdin (1 μg) was precipitated with chloroform/methanol (21Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3127) Google Scholar), reduced, carboxymethylated (22Krieg J. Hartmann S. Vicentini A. Gläsner W. Hess D. Hofsteenge J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and digested with 300 ng of trypsin at 37 °C for 2 h, followed by another 200 ng for 2.5 h in a total volume of 42 μl. The digest was diluted 5-fold with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, containing 2% CH3CN, and 5 μl (∼400 fmol) were injected onto a reversed phase column for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis in the information-dependent acquisition mode. Electrospray ionization LC-MSMS was performed using a Magic C18 HPLC column (100 μm × 10 cm; Spectronex) in an 1100 Nano-HPLC system (Agilent Technologies) that was connected to a 4000 Q Trap (Applied Biosystems). The peptides were loaded onto a peptide captrap (Michrom BioResources) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. They were eluted at a flow rate of 300 nl/min with a linear gradient of 3.6–38% CH3CN in 0.1% formic acid/H2O in 40 min. Information-dependent acquisition analyses were done according to the manufacturer's recommendations, i.e. 1 enhanced multicharge, 4 enhanced resolutions, and 4 enhanced product ion scans, were repeatedly cycled, and precursors were excluded for 60 s after their second occurrence. Individual MSMS spectra, containing sequence information for a single peptide, were compared by the program Mascot (23Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6711) Google Scholar), using a data base that only contained the properdin sequence (SwissProt entry number P27918). The modifications Fuc-O- and Glc-Fuc-O-of Ser and Thr were defined as neutral losses of 146.1 and 308.1 Da, respectively, and the C-mannosyl on tryptophans as a stable modification (+162.1 Da). The MS instrument was operated under the following conditions: ion spray voltage, 3500; gas1, 25; declustering potential, 80 V; Q1 and Q3, low resolution (500 at m/z 1000); and dwell time, 60 ms. Amino acids and tryptic peptides have been numbered as they occur in the sequence defined in SwissProt entry number P27918.For quantitative comparison of a specific glycoform of peptide T7 between different properdin samples, we injected 0.5 μl of the 5-fold diluted tryptic digest (∼40 fmol) for LC-MSMS in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The CID tandem mass spectra of the MMFG and MMF0 forms (see Fig. 1C for the nomenclature) of peptide T7 are indistinguishable (supplemental Table S1). This results from the loss of the fucosyl glycan, because of the gas phase instability of the sugar-peptide linkage. In an MRM LC-MSMS experiment, they can, however, be distinguished by the 162-Da difference in mass of their precursor ions. The y9 (m/z = 1037.5) and y13 (m/z = 1480.6) product ions from the triply charged precursors at m/z 1044.8 and 990.8 were recorded to detect the MMFG and MMF0 glycoforms, respectively. To distinguish the two isobaric forms MMF0 and M0FG, the formation of the [M + 2H-Fuc]2+ quasimolecular ion from the same precursor was monitored under low collision energy conditions in the same LC-MS experiment. To allow for a quantitative comparison of specific glycoforms between properdin samples, we also measured transitions that are specific for two nonglycosylated peptides (T24 and T28). The intensity of the latter was used to normalize all other transitions for the amount of analyzed protein.RESULTSSerum Levels of Properdin in Patients with Peters Plus Syndrome Are Slightly Reduced—For the analysis of the structural consequences of mutations in the gene encoding β3Glc-T in patients with Peters Plus syndrome, we chose properdin, the positive regulator of the complement system (24Nolan K.F. Reid K.B. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This protein is well suited as a reporter for this disorder, because it is relatively abundant, can easily be purified, and the positions of the four Glc-β1,3-Fuc-O-disaccharides have been determined (9Gonzalez de Peredo A. Klein D. Macek B. Hess D. Peter-Katalinic J. Hofsteenge J. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 11-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 25Hartmann S. Hofsteenge J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28569-28574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To examine whether its level in patients with Peters Plus syndrome had significantly changed, we performed an ELISA on serum from four individuals that are homozygous or compound heterozygous for a mutation in the gene encoding β3Glc-T. The concentration of properdin in the heterozygous individuals 2 and 3 (Table 1) was very similar to that of a control individual (Fig. 1A). In contrast, we observed a 1.3–1.7-fold reduced level in the patients. At this point, however, we do not know how general this observation is, because of the relatively small number of individuals examined.Properdin from Peters Plus Patients Lacks Glucosylation of O-Linked Fucose—Properdin was isolated from the serum of four patients and three control individuals (Table 1) by immunoadsorption. SDS-PAGE showed that the procedure yields properdin of sufficient purity for further analysis (Fig. 1B). It contained as a major contaminant a 75-kDa protein that was found by mass spectrometric analysis to be histidine-rich glycoprotein (data not shown), as well as a minor amount of an unidentified protein with a mass of 40 kDa that we did not further analyze. Both proteins, but not properdin, were also isolated when nonspecific mouse IgG was used in a control experiment. This indicates that they do not interact with properdin but rather with the immunoaffinity beads (data not shown).TSRs contain, in addition to the Glc-β1,3-Fuc-O-disaccharide, C-linked mannosyl residues on most of their tryptophans. Because the two types of modification are not always complete, we chose to analyze the major glycoforms of the four O-fucosylated tryptic peptides (9Gonzalez de Peredo A. Klein D. Macek B. Hess D. Peter-Katalinic J. Hofsteenge J. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 11-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 25Hartmann S. Hofsteenge J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28569-28574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), indicated in Fig. 1C, by LC-MSMS.The MMFG form of peptide T7 from the controls (individuals 1–3; Table 1) had a mass of 3129.6 Da (mono-isotopic; Table 2), and its CID tandem mass spectrum (supplemental Table S1) was in agreement with its previously determined structure (9Gonzalez de Peredo A. Klein D. Macek B. Hess D. Peter-Katalinic J. Hofsteenge J. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 11-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This form of peptide T7 was not observed in properdin from the four patients. Instead we found a strong signal for a glycopeptide with a 162-Da lower mass (2967.3 Da; Table 2), which corresponds to the MMF0 glycoform. Theoretically, this mass difference could also result from the lack of a C-mannosyl residue. This could be excluded, however, because the b7 and b8 ions that show the presence of a C-mannose on Trp-83 and -86 were present in the CID tandem mass spectrum (Fig. 2). It is important to note that none of the observed fragment ions carried the O-fucosyl glycan. Its loss in tandem MS experiments in a quadrupole-based instrument is well documented (8Hofsteenge J.

Peter-Katalinic J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 15: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and is a result from the gas phase instability of this sugar-peptide linkage. However, the identity of the O-fucosyl glycan can be deduced from the neutral loss observed in a CID experiment at low collision energy. The MMF0 form of the peptides from the patients (as well as the minor component with the same structure from the controls) underwent a 146-Da loss (the mass of a fucosyl residue), whereas the MMFG and M0FG glycoforms from healthy controls lost 308 Da, corresponding to the residue of the disaccharide. Thus, peptide T7 from patients is only substituted with the Fuc-O-monosaccharide.TABLE 2Mass spectrometric analysis of the O-fucosylated peptides from properdinIndividualObserved mass (Da)aValues given are either monoisotopic (italic type) or average masses (regular type).

In properdin from control individuals, we detected the MMMFG form of peptide T11, the MMFG form of T23, as well as the MM0FG and MMMFG forms of peptide T17 + 18 (Table 2), in agreement with our previous findings (9Gonzalez de Peredo A. Klein D. Macek B. Hess D. Peter-Katalinic J. Hofsteenge J. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 11-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For peptides T11 and T23, the observed neutral loss of 308 Da provided further evidence for the Glc-β1,3-Fuc-O-disaccharide. In comparison, in properdin from patients we did not identify any of the glucosylated glycoforms, but instead we observed the corresponding peptides with a 162-Da lower mass (Table 2). Peptides T11 and T23 underwent a 146-Da neutral loss (Table 2), demonstrating that they carried the Fuc-O-monosaccharide. For the larger peptide T17 + 18, we could not establish conditions for neutral loss experiments to distinguish between the lack of glucose or C-mannose without fragmenting the polypeptide backbone too much. Therefore, we relied on the different chromatographic behavior of C- and O-glycosylated peptides to assign the glycoforms. In agreement with our previous experience, we consistently observed in the LC-MSMS experiments with peptide T7 that the presence of a C-mannosyl residue caused a much larger decrease in retention time than an O-linked hexose (see also below and Fig. 3, A and B). This allowed us to identify the 162-Da lighter version of peptide T17 + 18 that had an elution time very similar to that of the MMMFG form, as MMMF0, and the well separated but later eluting isobaric one as MM0FG. Consistent with this, the form observed in patients that was still another 162 Da lighter (MM0F0) eluted close to MM0FG. Taken together, the mass spectrometry data on the O-fucosyl glycan-carrying properdin peptides from the patients with Peters Plus syndrome showed that glucosylation is lacking at all four sites.FIGURE 3Analysis of peptide T7 from properdin in the multiple reaction monitoring mode.

https://openalex.org/W2149753304,"Orexins acting at the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) OX1R have recently been shown to promote dramatic apoptosis in cancer cells. We report here that orexin-induced apoptosis is driven by an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) (IIY(358)NFL) present in the OX1R. This effect is mediated by SHP-2 phosphatase recruitment via a mechanism that requires Gq protein but is independent of phospholipase C activation. This is based on the following observations: 1) mutation of Y(358) into F abolished orexin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in ITIM, orexin-induced apoptosis, and uncoupled OX1R from Gq protein in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells; 2) orexin-induced apoptosis in CHO cells expressing recombinant OX1R and in colon cancer cells expressing the native receptor was abolished by treatment with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor PAO and by transfection with a dominant-negative mutant of SHP-2; 3) orexins were unable to promote apoptosis in fibroblast cells invalidated for the G alpha q subunit and transfected with OX1R cDNA, whereas they promoted apoptosis in cells equipped with G alpha q and OX1R; and 4) the phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122 blocked orexin-stimulated inositol phosphate formation, whereas it had no effect on orexin-induced apoptosis in CHO cells expressing OX1R. These data unravel a novel mechanism, whereby ITIM-expressing GPCRs may trigger apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2065751797,"Proteins with a weak sequence similarity to tubulin and FtsZ are expressed from large plasmids of Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus thuringiensis and are probably involved in plasmid segregation. Previously designated RepX and TubZ, we designate them here as TubZ-Ba and TubZ-Bt. We have expressed and purified the proteins for in vitro studies. TubZ-Ba and TubZ-Bt share only 21% amino acid identity, but they have remarkably similar biochemical properties. They both assemble into two-stranded filaments and larger bundles above a critical concentration, and they hydrolyze GTP at a very high rate, ∼20 GTP min–1 TubZ–1. Assembly is also supported by GTPγS. A tiny amount of GTPγS stabilizes polymers assembled in GTP and inhibits the GTPase by a mechanism involving cooperativity. The nucleotide in the polymers is almost 100% GDP, which is similar to microtubules but very different from the 20–30% GDP in FtsZ polymers. This suggests that the TubZ polymers have a capping mechanism that may be related to the GTP cap that produces dynamic instability of microtubules. Proteins with a weak sequence similarity to tubulin and FtsZ are expressed from large plasmids of Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus thuringiensis and are probably involved in plasmid segregation. Previously designated RepX and TubZ, we designate them here as TubZ-Ba and TubZ-Bt. We have expressed and purified the proteins for in vitro studies.

The nucleotide in the polymers is almost 100% GDP, which is similar to microtubules but very different from the 20–30% GDP in FtsZ polymers. This suggests that the TubZ polymers have a capping mechanism that may be related to the GTP cap that produces dynamic instability of microtubules. FtsZ and tubulin have the same complex folding patterns and are therefore considered homologs, i.e. they are derived from a common ancestor. FtsZs share 40–50% sequence identity across most bacterial and archaeal species, and tubulins are even more highly conserved across eukaryotic species. However, the sequence identity between FtsZ and tubulin is so low, 10–15% as to be hardly recognizable. Erickson (1Erickson H.P. Bioessays. 2007; 29: 668-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) has suggested that the reason for this extreme divergence is that FtsZ is performing the same function, cytokinesis, in all prokaryotic species, but tubulin has lost this function and acquired new ones. Several Bacillus species have large, low-copy plasmids that code for toxins. These plasmids also code for a protein that is distantly related to FtsZ. Although originally termed “FtsZ-like” (2Vaughan S. Wickstead B. Gull K. Addinall S.G. J. Mol. Evol. 2004; 58: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), further analysis showed a similar 15–20% sequence identity to either tubulin or FtsZ, and the proteins have some conserved regions that align with FtsZ, and others that align with tubulin (3Larsen R.A. Cusumano C. Fujioka A. Lim-Fong G. Patterson P. Pogliano J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1340-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the FtsZ-like proteins produced by the plasmids of different Bacillus species are almost as divergent from each other as they are from FtsZ and tubulin. The ones that have been studied so far are from the pXO1 plasmid of Bacillus anthracis and the pBtoxis plasmid of Bacillus thuringiensis. These show only 21% amino acid identity to each other (4Berry C. O'Neil S. Ben-Dov E. Jones A.F. Murphy L. Quail M.A. Holden M.T. Harris D. Zaritsky A. Parkhill J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 5082-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The FtsZ/tubulin-like protein from pXO1 was shown to be essential for maintaining the plasmid in B. anthracis (5Tinsley E. Khan S.A. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2829-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). That study went on to show that this was the only plasmid-encoded protein that was necessary for plasmid stability. A minireplicon containing only a short DNA sequence from pXO1 (presumably a centromere-like segment) could be maintained provided the FtsZ/tubulin-like protein was produced, either from the same plasmid or in trans. Tinsley and Khan (5Tinsley E. Khan S.A. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2829-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) suggested that this protein might be involved in replicating the plasmid DNA and named the protein RepX. An alternative is that RepX is involved in partitioning the low-copy plasmids to daughter cells, as originally suggested by Berry et al. (4Berry C. O'Neil S. Ben-Dov E. Jones A.F. Murphy L. Quail M.A. Holden M.T. Harris D. Zaritsky A. Parkhill J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 5082-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We now believe this to be the case, especially in light of the more detailed analyses of TubZ from pBtoxis. The FtsZ/tubulin-like protein from pBtoxis, ORF156, was identified as one of two plasmid-encoded proteins needed for plasmid maintenance in B. thuringiensis (6Tang M. Bideshi D.K. Park H.W. Federici B.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 6948-6954Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Similar to the study of pXO1, a minireplicon expressing these two proteins and containing a short DNA sequence with an iteron repeat (a centromere-like segment) was stably maintained. Tang et al. (6Tang M. Bideshi D.K. Park H.W. Federici B.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 6948-6954Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) suggested that the protein was functioning for plasmid partitioning. Larsen et al. (3Larsen R.A. Cusumano C. Fujioka A. Lim-Fong G. Patterson P. Pogliano J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1340-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) were interested in this protein as a distant relative of tubulin and FtsZ, and named it TubZ. They constructed a GFP-tagged version that they expressed in B. thuringiensis and in Escherichia coli. In both species the TubZ assembled into a single filament that spanned most of the length of the cell. The filaments were remarkably uniform in fluorescence, both along the length of the filament and between filaments in different cells. The filaments demonstrated a treadmilling behavior, growing at one end and shrinking at the other, at a rate of about 30 nm per s. Margolin (7Margolin W. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: R633-R636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) has reviewed the discoveries and mechanisms of these two proteins. The likely function of TubZ from B. thuringiensis is plasmid partitioning (3Larsen R.A. Cusumano C. Fujioka A. Lim-Fong G. Patterson P. Pogliano J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1340-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 4Berry C. O'Neil S. Ben-Dov E. Jones A.F. Murphy L. Quail M.A. Holden M.T. Harris D. Zaritsky A. Parkhill J. Appl. Environ.

Microbiol. 2006; 72: 6948-6954Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We believe this also applies to RepX. To avoid the confusion of different names for the FtsZ/tubulin-like proteins from different species, we propose a simple and uniform nomenclature. We will use the name TubZ, which was meant to designate the similarity to tubulin and FtsZ (3Larsen R.A. Cusumano C. Fujioka A. Lim-Fong G. Patterson P. Pogliano J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1340-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and we will add a species identification. Thus, we will designate the proteins from B. anthracis and B. thuringiensis TubZ-Ba and TubZ-Bt. This nomenclature can be easily extended to the larger group of FtsZ/tubulin-like proteins on other plasmids and Archaea (3Larsen R.A. Cusumano C. Fujioka A. Lim-Fong G. Patterson P. Pogliano J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1340-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). An advantage of this nomenclature is that it implies nothing about function. Assembly of TubZ-Bt has been characterized in the cytoplasm of B. thuringiensis and E. coli as discussed above (3Larsen R.A. Cusumano C. Fujioka A. Lim-Fong G. Patterson P. Pogliano J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1340-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Assembly has not been studied in vitro. Assembly of TubZ-Ba has not been studied either in vitro or in vivo. Their extreme sequence divergence from each other suggests that their functions could be as different as those of FtsZ and tubulin. To explore these proteins further, we have expressed and purified both of them and characterized their assembly properties in vitro. Protein Expression and Purification—We used PCR to clone the TubZ-Ba sequence from plasmid pDSW208-FtsZPXO1-GFP, a gift from Dr. Theresa Koehler, University of Texas Medical Center, which was generated from B. anthracis strain 7702. BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites were added at the ends and used to insert TubZ-Ba into the pGEX2T expression vector, which adds an N-terminal GST tag. The TubZ-Ba-pGEX2T vector was then transferred into E. coli strain BL21. Protein was expressed by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the culture when its absorbance at 600 nm was ∼1.0. After 3 h, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 300 mm KCl. 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme were added, and cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were lysed with a French pressure cell and centrifuged at 32,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was then mixed with 5 ml of glutathione-agarose (Sigma, G4510) for 1 h at 4 °C. The agarose was loaded onto a column and washed with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 300 mm KCl. GST-TubZ-Ba protein was eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione, in the same buffer. The GST tag was removed by adding 2 units/ml of thrombin for 2 h at 4 °C. The protein was further purified by chromatography on a Source Q 10/10 column (GE Health Care, Piscataway, NJ), eluted with a linear gradient of 50 mm to 500 mm KCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol. Peak fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE and stored at –80 °C. For most experimental measurements, the protein was dialyzed into assembly buffer, sometimes referred to as HMK100: 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 100 mm KAc, 5 mm MgAc, 1 mm EGTA. The TubZ-Bt gene was obtained from MosquitoDunks® (Summit Chemical Co.), a commercial sample of B. thuringiensis subsp Isrealiensis. Bacteria were propagated and genomic DNA, including the DNA of the plasmid pBtoxis, was isolated. The TubZ-Bt gene was obtained by PCR and transferred to pET15. The His tag protein was expressed and purified by affinity chromatography on a Talon column (Clontech Lab, Inc.). The His tag was removed with 2 units/ml of thrombin, and the protein further purified on a Source Q column. GTPase Assay—To measure the GTPase activity, we used the continuous, regenerative coupled GTPase assay of Ingerman et al. (8Ingerman E. Nunnari J. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 404: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our assay mixture included 0.4 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.3 mm NADH, 20 units/ml each pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma), and 0.1–0.5 mm GTP. Each GDP released from TubZ-Ba is regenerated to GTP with the loss of one molecule of NADH. The NADH concentration was monitored by its absorbance at 340 nm (extinction coefficient 6220 m–1 cm–1) using a Shimadzu UV-2401PC spectrophotometer. Following addition of GTP, the absorbance showed a linear decrease over time. We measured the slope of the straight line after 100 s, typically between 100 and 300 s, and used the extinction coefficient of NADH to determine the GTP hydrolysis rate. We then plotted the rate versus TubZ concentration, and the slope of this line (above the critical concentration) gave the overall rate of GTP hydrolysis in GTP per min per TubZ. Light Scattering Measurements—90 degree light scattering was measured using a Shimadzu RF-5301 PC spectrofluorometer, with both excitation and emission set at 350 nm. Assembly reactions were initiated by adding 20–500 μm GTP, and/or the indicated concentrations of GTP analogue, into 3–10 μm TubZ. Light scattering measurements were begun about 2–3 s after nucleotide addition. Electron Microscopy—TubZ filaments were visualized by negative stain EM. About 10 μl of the sample (5–10 μm) in the appropriate buffer was incubated with GTP for 1–2 min and applied to a carbon-coated copper grid. Samples were negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate, and photographed using a Philips 301 electron microscope at ×50,000 magnification. Measurement of Filament-bound Guanine Nucleotide—We used the method of Romberg and Mitchison (9Romberg L. Mitchison T.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) to determine the content of nucleotide bound to TubZ polymers. TubZ at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 μm was added to 10 μl of a GTP-regenerating system (2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 40 units/ml pyruvate kinase). 20 μm GTP and 0.8 μCi of [α-32P]GTP were added, and after 100 s, the samples were denatured with 30 μl of 1 m perchloric acid and 10 mm EDTA. The mixture was neutralized with 20 μl of 1 m Na2CO3, and the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min to remove the precipitate. The nucleotides in the sample were analyzed on poly(ethylenimine)-cellulose thin-layer chromatography plates. Plates were pre-run in water and dried, and a 5-μl sample was spotted. The plates were run in 1 m LiCl. The dried plates were exposed to a Fujix bas 1000 phosphorimager plate, which was read in a Typhoon 9400 Variable Mode imager and analyzed by Image-Quant software. The amount of GDP as a fraction of total nucleotide was determined. Because all free GDP is immediately converted to GTP by the regenerating system, the measured GDP must come from nucleotide bound to filaments. We repeated the experiment with FtsZ from E. coli (EcFtsZ) as a control. TubZ-Ba Has a Very High GTPase Activity and Assembles into Double Helical Filaments—Fig. 1 shows the GTP hydrolysis rate for increasing concentrations of TubZ-Ba. The GTPase was linearly proportional to the TubZ-Ba concentration above a critical concentration of 0.2–0.4 μm (depending on the buffer), giving 24 GTP TubZ-Ba–1 min–1 (Fig. 1). The rate did not vary significantly with pH, being 21∼25 GTP TubZ-Ba–1 min–1 at room temperature in most buffers (pH 6.5, 7.0, and 7.7 with 100 mm KAc and 5 mm MgAc). We have reported that the GTPase activity of E. coli FtsZ (EcFtsZ) 2The abbreviations used are:EcFtsZFtsZ from E. coliEMelectron microscopyGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-[γ-thio]triphosphateGMPCPPguanosine 5′-(a,b-methylene)triphosphateGFPgreen fluorescent proteinGSTglutathione S-transferase. is around 4–7 GTP FtsZ–1 min–1 at room temperature (10Chen Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22549-22554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus the GTPase of TubZ-Ba is 3–4-fold higher than that of EcFtsZ. FtsZ from E. coli electron microscopy guanosine 5′-O-[γ-thio]triphosphate guanosine 5′-(a,b-methylene)triphosphate green fluorescent protein glutathione S-transferase. Negative stain EM showed that TubZ-Ba assembled into short, twisted two-stranded filaments and some larger bundles (Fig. 2). The filaments alternate between wider and straight segments that show the two strands and narrow edge views that show a gentle curvature. The flattened structure in the negative stain image suggests a three-dimensional structure in which the two-stranded ribbon forms a helix, with a diameter of ∼7 nm and pitch of 75 nm. Occasionally the ribbon showed a third strand. The assembly required GTP or a GTP analogue. We then tested TubZ-Ba in crowding solution conditions that should mimic the conditions of the bacterial cytoplasm (11Minton A.P. J. Pharm. Sci. 2005; 94: 1668-1675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 12Minton A.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 13Gonzalez J.M. Jimenez M. Velez M. Mingorance J. Andreu J.M. Vicente M. Rivas G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37664-37671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). When assembled in buffer containing 10% polyvinyl alcohol, TubZ-Ba retained its very high GTPase activity, about 18 GTP TubZ-Ba–1 min–1. Assembly, however, was substantially changed. Instead of the short, twisted two-stranded filaments, in polyvinyl alcohol TubZ-Ba assembled very long bundles of ∼2–10 protofilaments (Fig. 2e). GTPγS Can Support TubZ-Ba Filament Assembly, and a Tiny Amount Can Stabilize Assembly with GTP—GTPγSisa GTP analogue that can substitute for GTP in many GTP-binding proteins and is either slowly hydrolyzed or not hydrolyzed at all. When GTPγS was added to TubZ-Ba, it assembled into filaments similar to those assembled in GTP. However, the GTPγS filaments were much longer and tended to cluster into somewhat larger irregular bundles (Fig. 2c). We note that in rare cases the two-stranded filaments unwound and left lengths of single filaments that were apparently stable without the lateral contacts. Polymers assembled with 100 μm GTP plus 1 μm GTPγS appeared similar to those assembled with 20 μm GTPγS (Fig. 2d). A light scattering assay showed that in 100 μm GTP, polymers rapidly assembled and immediately began to disassemble (Fig. 3a). The 5 μm TubZ-Ba would have consumed 50% of the 100 μm GTP in 25 s. The disassembly began even before this, so it is probably induced by the accumulation of GDP. Light scattering was back to the baseline after 80 s. When assembly was initiated with 1.5 μm GTPγS, the light scattering rose somewhat more slowly and remained at the plateau. With 1.5 μm GTPγS, we expect only 1.5 μm TubZ-Ba to assemble. When 100 μm GTP was added to this assembly at 400 s, the light scattering increased further and then decreased back to the original plateau. We believe that the initial assembly of TubZ-Ba in GTPγS formed filaments that were very stable. When GTP was added later, the remaining TubZ subunits assembled into filaments that were either separate from or attached to the end of the GTPγS filaments. These new filaments rapidly hydrolyzed the GTP and disassembled, leaving the stable GTPγS filaments. The GTPγS subunits, once assembled into their original polymers, apparently did not mix with the GTP subunits. We then tested assembly initiated by a mixture of 1.5 μm GTPγS plus 100 μm GTP. The light scattering rose to a value twice that with 1.5 μm GTPγS alone, and when it reached the plateau it decreased only very slowly. EM showed that the filaments assembled in 1.0 μm GTPγS plus 100 μm GTP were very similar to those assembled in 20 μm GTPγS (Fig. 2d). To investigate this further, we assayed the rate of GTP hydrolysis for 5 μm TubZ-Ba, with 20, 100, and 500 μm GTP, and variable amounts of GTPγS. For this experiment we assayed the steady state GTP hydrolysis rate as the slope of the absorbance curve as soon as it became linear, typically from 100 to 300 s following initiation of assembly. As shown in Fig. 3b, the GTPase was completely inhibited at 1, 2, and 5 μm GTPγS for the three concentrations of GTP. GMPCPP is a slowly hydrolyzable GTP analog that supports assembly of tubulin and FtsZ. We found that it induced assembly of TubZ-Ba into bundles that were similar to those assembled in GTPγS. GMPCPP also inhibited the GTPase activity of TubZ-Ba, but only at much higher concentrations. GMPCPP needed to be approximately equimolar to GTP to completely inhibit the GTPase of 5 μm TubZ-Ba (Fig. 3c). These results suggest that GMPCPP binds TubZ-Ba with an affinity similar to that of GTP, while GTPγS binds with much higher affinity. One possible mechanism for the inhibition of GTPase would be simple competitive binding to block GTP binding. In this case, a plot of 1/GTPase versus GTPγS or GMPCPP concentration should be linear. A linear plot was obtained for the case of FtsZ and GMPCPP (Fig. 3e), but both analogs gave non-linear curves for TubZ-Ba (Fig. 3d and data not shown). The non-linearity was suggestive of cooperativity, so we re-plotted the data in the form of a Hill plot. We assumed the equation log[Y/(1 – Y)] = nlog[M] + k, where Y is the fractional inhibition of the GTPase activity and M is the concentration of GTPγSor GMPCPP. As shown in Fig. 3f, both GTPγS and GMPCPP gave linear Hill plots for TubZ-Ba. For GTPγS, the Hill coefficient was about 1.7 for the three GTP concentrations, and for GMPCPP it was 1.6 and 1.9 for 30 and 100 μm GTP. These values are all close to 2, so we take this as the measure of the cooperativity for the analogs inhibiting the GTPase. For a comparison we tested the inhibition of the GTPase of FtsZ by GMPCPP. The plot of 1/GTPase versus GMPCPP was linear (Fig. 3e), and the Hill coefficient was 1 (Fig. 3f). To explore the differences between GMPCPP and GTPγS, we tested how excess GDP would affect polymers of TubZ-Ba assembled with the GTP analogs. We had already observed that polymers assembled in GTP rapidly disassembled as the GTP was depleted and GDP accumulated (Fig. 3a). Polymers assembled in 20 μm GMPCPP showed a complex disassembly when a 10-fold excess of GDP was added. An initial rapid phase of disassembly was followed by a slow phase (Fig. 4a). However, for TubZ-Ba assembled in 20 μm GTPγS, 200 μm GDP had almost no effect. Significant filament disassembly was only obtained with 1–5 mm GDP (Fig. 4b). The disassembly induced by 5 mm GDP for the GTPγS assembly was similar to that produced by 0.2 mm GDP for GMPCPP assembly. This is consistent with the suggestion that TubZ-Ba protein has a much higher binding affinity for GTPγS than for GMPCPP, GTP, and GDP. The Nucleotide in TubZ-Ba Filaments Is Almost Exclusively GDP—Romberg and Mitchison (9Romberg L. Mitchison T.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) confirmed that microtubules contained almost 100% GDP, but the nucleotide content of FtsZ filaments was only 20% GDP (9Romberg L. Mitchison T.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We used their assay to determine the nucleotide content of TubZ-Ba filaments. TubZ-Ba was incubated with 20 μm GTP and 0.8 μCi of [α-32P]GTP in the presence of a GTP-regenerating system (see details under “Experimental Procedures”). The GTP-regenerating system rapidly converts all free GDP to GTP, so the only GDP that exists in the assembly mixture is that which is protected from regeneration by being bound to polymers. Fig. 5 shows the GDP in increasing concentrations of TubZ-Ba protein, with a comparable assay of FtsZ as a control. For FtsZ about 30% of the nucleotide was GDP, similar to the 20% value determined previously by Romberg and Mitchison (9Romberg L. Mitchison T.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). (The previous measure was at pH 6.5, 50 mm potassium, and ours was at pH 7.7, 100 mm potassium.) In contrast, in the TubZ-Ba polymers 95% of the nucleotide was GDP. In this respect TubZ-Ba polymers are similar to microtubules. Assembly and GTPase of TubZ-Bt—We did a similar analysis of TubZ-Bt, the tubulin-like protein from the plasmid pBtoxis of B. thuringiensis (3Larsen R.A. Cusumano C. Fujioka A. Lim-Fong G. Patterson P. Pogliano J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1340-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 6Tang M. Bideshi D.K. Park H.W. Federici B.A. Appl. Environ.

Negative stain EM showed that assembly in 100 μm GTP produced filaments similar to those of TubZ-Ba, although the two-stranded structure was less obvious (Fig. 6a). Assembly in 1 μm GTPγS gave filaments that were much longer and somewhat more bundled, and showed more clearly the two-stranded structure (Fig. 6b). Assembly in 100 μm GTP plus 1 μm GTPγS gave much larger bundles (Fig. 6c). In crowding condition (10% polyvinyl alcohol), TubZ-Bt assembled into long bundles similar to TubZ-Ba (not shown). The biochemical properties of TubZ-Bt were remarkably similar to those of TubZ-Ba. TubZ-Bt had a very high GTPase activity, 16∼18 GTP TubZ-Bt–1 min–1, and a critical concentration of 0.8 μm (Fig. 6d). The nucleotide in TubZ-Bt filaments was almost exclusively GDP, similar to TubZ-Ba and tubulin. Light scattering showed a very rapid assembly in 100 μm GTP, followed by disassembly as the GTP was consumed (Fig. 6e). In GTPγS the assembly occurred more slowly, but when the plateau was reached at ∼80 s, it was stable. In the mixture of 100 μm GTP plus 1 μm GTPγS assembly occurred in a first phase at an intermediate rate to 40 s, followed by a steady increase in scattering. The second phase is probably due to the increased bundling seen by EM (Fig. 6c). Finally, we found that the GTPase was strongly inhibited by very small amounts of GTPγS. In 100 μm GTP, the GTPase of 3 μm TubZ-Bt was reduced by 80% by 1 μm GTPγS (not shown). The plot of 1/GTPase versus GTPγS was non-linear (not shown). The Hill plot was linear with a Hill coefficient of 1.9 (Fig. 6f). Assembly of TubZ-Ba and TubZ-Bt both showed two aspects of cooperativity, which may not be related to each other. The first aspect of cooperativity is the characteristic critical concentration (Cc) at steady state. Below Cc there is no polymer, and above Cc all excess protein assembles into polymer. Actin and microtubules are among the best characterized cooperative assemblies, and they show a classic Cc. FtsZ also shows a Cc, although the basis for cooperativity is still obscure for this one-subunit thick filament (15Chen Y. Bjornson K. Redick S.D. Erickson H.P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The second aspect of cooperativity is the Hill coefficient of ∼2 found for the inhibition of GTP hydrolysis by GTPγS and GMPCPP. This is an unusual application of the Hill equation but we think it is informative. The normal application of the Hill equation is to describe binding of a ligand to multiple sites on an enzyme or other substrate. In our application we used it to describe the inhibition of GTPase by GTPγS, in particular how the inhibition depends on the concentration of GTPγS. Steady state GTP hydrolysis probably involves several steps. By analogy with tubulin, and probably also FtsZ, exchange of nucleotide probably occurs only on free subunits. Following a hydrolysis event the subunit must disassemble and exchange its GDP for GTP. The subunit can then reassemble and undergo another round of hydrolysis. We suggest that the inhibition of steady state GTP hydrolysis by GTPγS may involve a block in the disassembly stage. The Hill coefficient of 2 then suggests that to block disassembly there needs to be two adjacent subunits with GTPγS. This may in turn be related to the two-stranded structure of the filaments, which is especially obvious for TubZ-Ba. Note that for FtsZ, which assembles primarily one-stranded protofilaments, the Hill coefficient for GMPCPP inhibition was 1. A Possible Capping Mechanism—The TubZ-Ba and TubZ-Bt polymers share several features with microtubules that may indicate a capping mechanism related to dynamic instability. Most important, nearly 100% of the nucleotide in the polymer is GDP for both microtubules and TubZ. Because the GDP polymer is unstable and disassembles, a mechanism is needed to stabilize the polymers and promote growth. This has been explored in detail for microtubules, where a small GTP cap at each end is thought to stabilize the GDP tubulin in the core (16Desai A. Mitchison T.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar, 17Erickson H.P. O'Brien E.T. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Struct. Biol. 1992; 21: 145-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). A similar capping mechanism for TubZ is suggested by the fact that the filaments are maintained in solution, despite being nearly 100% TubZ-GDP. Capping is also suggested by the substoichiometric stabilization of polymers by GTPγS. The GTPase of 5 μm FtsZ in 100 μm GTP was inhibited 50 and 100% by 1 and 2 μm GTPγS (Fig. 3b), this correlated with the almost complete stabilization of polymers at 1.5 μm GTPγS (Fig. 3a). Assuming that GTPγS binds much more tightly than GTP, the polymers from this mix would contain 1.5 μm GTPγS and 3.5 μm GTP (a more accurate analysis would require knowledge of the KD for binding each nucleotide). That the 3.5 μm GTP subunits are mostly stabilized by the minority GTPγS subunits implies a cooperative mechanism for filament stabilization, or capping. The Hill coefficient of ∼2 further suggests that the cap might consist of two GTP or GTPγS subunits at the end of the two-stranded filament. This is at present a preliminary speculation, but further study may shed light on mechanisms common to TubZ and tubulin. GTPγS does not support assembly of FtsZ by itself. However, when protofilament bundles were assembled with GTP in the presence of Ca, GTPγS could stabilize these polymers (18Scheffers D.J. den Blaauwen T. Driessen A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A capping mechanism was suggested to explain this stabilization (18Scheffers D.J. den Blaauwen T. Driessen A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This mechanism appears to be quite different from what we observe for TubZ, where GTPγS can generate assembly by itself, and is incorporated into the polymers. A capping mechanism generates dynamic instability in microtubules, but TubZ-Bt behaves very differently from microtubules in vivo. Microtubules show dynamic instability at both ends, elongating for several μm, and then shortening by several μm. TubZ-Bt showed a very different treadmilling behavior when assembled in bacteria (3Larsen R.A. Cusumano C. Fujioka A. Lim-Fong G. Patterson P. Pogliano J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1340-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The filament grew continually at one end and shrank at the other. It is possible that the long filament of TubZ-Bt seen in bacteria has a GTP cap at the growing end, and GDP on all other subunits, including the shrinking minus end. Continuous growth at the GTP end and disassembly at the GDP end would generate treadmilling. An alternative possibility is that there is a GTP cap at each end, at one end the growth phase greatly exceeds shrinking, and at the other end the shrinking phase exceeds growth. This kind of differential dynamic instability can produce treadmilling in microtubules (17Erickson H.P. O'Brien E.T. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Struct. Biol. 1992; 21: 145-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In this case, GTPγS would stabilize the polymers by placing permanent caps at both ends. Divergent Sequences but Identical Biochemistry—The weak sequence similarity of TubZ-Bt to FtsZ suggested a possible role in plasmid partitioning (3Larsen R.A. Cusumano C. Fujioka A. Lim-Fong G. Patterson P. Pogliano J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1340-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 4Berry C. O'Neil S. Ben-Dov E. Jones A.F. Murphy L. Quail M.A. Holden M.T. Harris D. Zaritsky A.

Although TubZ-Ba was originally suggested to function in DNA replication (hence the name RepX), we believe that it functions like TubZ-Bt in plasmid partitioning. However, TubZ-Ba showed only 21% sequence identity to TubZ-Bt, suggesting that the two proteins may have functions as different as those of FtsZ and tubulin (1Erickson H.P. Bioessays. 2007; 29: 668-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Our in vitro analyses show, however, that TubZ-Ba and TubZ-Bt have remarkably similar biochemical properties. How can one reconcile the extremely divergent sequences with the apparently identical biochemistry? One possibility would be that they had separate origins as divergent genes, and acquired the virtually identical biochemistry by convergent evolution. A second is that they had a common origin and somehow diverged rapidly in the different Bacillus species. A comparison of the two plasmids favors the second possibility, a common origin followed by divergence of sequence. 29 of 125 predicted pBtoxis proteins showed sequence similarity to predicted proteins from pXO1(4). Several groups of these genes map to the two plasmids with similar spacing, suggesting a common ancestry. In particular, the TubZ-Ba and TubZ-Bt genes are both located just before the likely replication origin (4Berry C. O'Neil S. Ben-Dov E. Jones A.F. Murphy L. Quail M.A. Holden M.T. Harris D. Zaritsky A. Parkhill J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 5082-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Why then does FtsZ have 40–50% sequence identity across almost all bacterial and archaeal species, yet TubZ-Ba and TubZ-Bt share only 21% sequence identity? We suggest that the function of TubZ in plasmid partition may be much less stringent than the function of FtsZ in cytokinesis, and permit the greater divergence. Apart from the TubZ proteins of Bacillus plasmids, a number of very divergent FtsZ/tubulin-like sequences have been identified in the genomes of various archaea (2Vaughan S. Wickstead B. Gull K. Addinall S.G. J. Mol. Evol. 2004; 58: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 3Larsen R.A. Cusumano C. Fujioka A. Lim-Fong G. Patterson P. Pogliano J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1340-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These do not appear to be involved in cell division, because each species has one or more conventional FtsZs. It may be that these divergent FtsZ's function primarily to assemble long cytoskeletal filaments, as a part of some still unknown mechanism. Plasmid Partitioning—Plasmid partitioning can be achieved not only with very divergent tubulin homologs, but with at least two other protein systems unrelated to tubulin. The ParA/SopA system partitions a wide range of plasmids, and also bacterial chromosomes (19Gerdes K. Moller-Jensen J. Bugge Jensen R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 455-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 20Ebersbach G. Ringgaard S. Moller-Jensen J. Wang Q. Sherratt D.J. Gerdes K. Mol.

Many of the ParA proteins from different plasmids and bacterial species show only 25–30% sequence identity to ParA of plasmid P1. Another well-studied partitioning system is based on the actin homolog ParM (22Moller-Jensen J. Borch J. Dam M. Jensen R.B. Roepstorff P. Gerdes K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1477-1487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 23Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Weibel D.B. Mullins R.D. Science. 2007; 315: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A second actin-homolog partitioning system is the newly discovered AlfA (24Becker E. Herrera N.C. Gunderson F.Q. Derman A.I. Dance A.L. Sims J. Larsen R.A. Pogliano J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5919-5931Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). AlfA forms long, dynamic filaments in the cytoplasm, and appears to function like ParM. Yet the amino acid sequence identity between AlfA and ParM is only 15%, less even than the 21% identity between TubZ-Ba and TubZ-Bt. It is remarkable that a plasmid partitioning machine can apparently be constructed from three completely unrelated proteins. The one thing the proteins have in common is the ability to polymerize into long, thin filaments, which can apparently also bind a plasmid at each end. It may be that plasmid partitioning requires only a protein that can assemble a long filament, and some mechanism for attaching the plasmid to it. This apparently permits several different proteins to serve this cytoskeletal function, and for any given cytoskeletal protein a wide range of sequence divergence is apparently possible."

Autoantibodies present in PV patients can promote detrimental effects by triggering altered transduction of signals, which results in a final acantholysis. To investigate mechanisms involved in PV, cultured keratinocytes were treated with PV serum. PV sera were able to promote the cell cycle progression, inducing the accumulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2). Microarray analysis on keratinocytes detected that PV serum induced important changes in genes coding for one and the same proteins with known biological functions involved in PV disease (560 differentially expressed genes were identified). Then, we used two different approaches to investigate the role of Cdk2. First, small interfering RNA depletion of Cdk2 prevented cell-cell detachment induced by PV sera. Second, pharmacological inhibition of Cdk2 activity through roscovitine prevented blister formation and acantholysis in the mouse model of the disease. In vivo PV serum was found to alter multiple different pathways by microarray analysis (1463 differentially expressed genes were identified). Major changes in gene expression induced by roscovitine were studied through comparison of effects of PV serum alone and in association with roscovitine. The most significantly enriched pathways were cell communication, gap junction, focal adhesion, adherens junction, and tight junction.

Pemphigus is traditionally considered as a group of autoimmune blistering diseases affecting skin and mucous membranes. It is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against the intercellular substance of keratinocytes (1Stanley J.R. Amagai M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 355: 1800-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Although several subtypes of pemphigus can be recognized on the basis of both clinical and laboratory criteria, two main forms have been described so far, namely pemphigus vulgaris (PV) 3The abbreviations used are:PVpemphigus vulgarisPFpemphigus foliaceusPBSphosphate-buffered salinesiRNAsmall interfering RNANSnormal serum. 3The abbreviations used are:PVpemphigus vulgarisPFpemphigus foliaceusPBSphosphate-buffered salinesiRNAsmall interfering RNANSnormal serum. and foliaceus (PF). The best characterized autoantigens of PV and PF are the desmosomal proteins Dsg3 and Dsg1 (desmoglein 3 and 1), respectively (2Bystryn J.C. Rudolph J.L. Lancet. 2005; 366: 61-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), belonging to the cadherin family of calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecules (3Amagai M. Klaus-Kovtun V. Stanley J.R. Cell. 1991; 67: 869-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). The common denominator of all types of pemphigus is the disruption of the intercellular bridges among keratinocytes, termed acantholysis. Morphological changes occurring in PV acantholytic cells have been reproduced both in cultured keratinocytes and in vivo in neonatal mice (4Farb R.M. Dykes R. Lazaurs G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 5Anhalt G.J. Labib R.S. Voorhees J.J. Beals T.F. Diaz L.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1982; 306: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet clear whether PV IgG can experimentally mimic the disease on its own, since the action of serum factors other than IgG in PV blistering has been recently emphasized (6Puviani M. Marconi A. Cozzani E. Pincelli C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 164-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 7Amagai M. Ahmed A.R. Kitajima Y. Bystryn J.C. Milner Y.

Dermatol. 2006; 15: 815-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Despite years of research on PV pathophysiology, to date precise molecular mechanisms underlying acantholysis have not yet been fully understood. Until recently, it was believed that disruption of cell-cell contacts resulted from the simple interaction of PV autoantibodies with Dsgs by steric hindrance (8Mahoney M.G. Wang Z. Rothenberger K. Koch P.J. Amagai M. Stanley J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 9Tsunoda K. Ota T. Aoki M. Yamada T. Nagai T. Nakagawa T. Koyasu S. Nishikawa T. Amagai M. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2170-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, today this model appears untenable, since (a) autoimmunity in PV is not just restricted to adhesion molecules (10Nguyen V.T. Ndoye A. Shultz L.D. Pittelkow M.R. Grando S.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1467-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), (b) serum factors other than IgG could play a role in PV pathogenesis (11Feliciani C. Toto P. Amerio P. Pour S.M. Coscione G. Shivji G. Wang B. Sauder D.N. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 114: 71-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and (c) a number of signal transduction cascades seem to be crucially involved in acantholysis (12Williamson L. Raess N.A. Caldelari R. Zakher A. de Bruin A. Posthaus H. Bolli R. Hunziker T. Suter M.M. Muller E.J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3298-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Berkwitz P. Hu P.

With regard to this, an emerging concept is that phosphorylation events could be impaired in PV. Consistently, activation of signaling through both protein kinase C isoforms and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase have been proposed to initiate acantholytic changes by inducing desmosome disassembling and cytoskeleton reorganization (12Williamson L. Raess N.A. Caldelari R. Zakher A. de Bruin A. Posthaus H. Bolli R. Hunziker T. Suter M.M. Muller E.J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3298-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 14Osada K. Seishima M.

Enzymatic phosphorylation has proven to be the most rapid reversible post-translational modification of proteins affecting their activity, localization, and stability. Phosphorylation events are controlled by protein kinases, which can regulate the onset and transition through mitosis (15Mausacchio A. Hardwick K.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Thus, PV sera may influence the cell cycle progression of keratinocytes. One of the central kinases involved in G1 regulation is the Cdk2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2), an essential component of the cell cycle machine, which can be altered in several diseases, such as cancer and gestational trophoblatic disease (16Garcia J.F.

To date, no precise correlations between PV and keratinocyte cell cycle progression have been established. The goal of the present study was to investigate the pathogenic molecular events involved in PV. Antibodies and Reagents—Polyclonal IgGs against Perk, phospho-Perk, Akt, phospho-Akt, Ask1, αPAK, phospho-αPAK, Jak1, Cdk2, PKR, phospho-PKR, phospho-p38, CK1, Dsg1, STE-20, β-actin, pancytokeratin, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Nitrocellulose membranes were purchased from Invitrogen; reagents for enhanced chemiluminescence and films were from Amersham Biosciences. All reagents used for protein extraction and cell cultures were obtained from Sigma, except keratinocyte growth medium and antibiotics/antimicotic, purchased from Invitrogen. Roscovitine was obtained from Calbiochem. Patients and Sera—Sera of patients with untreated active PV (n = 4, named PV1-PV4) and from two volunteers without any skin disease (n = 2, NS1 and NS2) have been used for the experiments. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, who have collaborated in our studies for 30 years (20Gombos F. Caruso F. Mazzarella G. Arch. Stomatol. 1974; 15: 69-79Google Scholar, 21Gombos F. Serpico R. Arch. Stomatol. 1978; 19: 239-246Google Scholar). The diagnosis of PV was made based on the results of both clinical and histological examinations, according to well established criteria (22Lanza A. Femiano F. De Rosa A. Cammarota M. Lanza M. Cirillo N. Int. J. Immunopathol. Pharmacol. 2006; 19: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). PV patient skin biopsies used for diagnosis served as samples for immunohistochemical analyses. In pilot experiments (n = 2), PV IgG was purified from sera by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by affinity chromatography on Protein G (HiTrap; Amersham Biosciences). IgG fractions were dialyzed against PBS and sterile filtered, and CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The presence of autoantibodies in sera was determined by indirect immunofluorescence using monkey esophagus as substrate (values above 1:40 of circulating anti-intercellular substance antibodies were considered as positive) and confirmed by Western blotting against Dsg1 and Dsg3. Cell Cultures and Treatments—We have exposed cultured cells to PV patient sera as proposed originally by Swanson and Dahl (23Swanson D.L. Dahl M.V. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1983; 81: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). On the basis of both our preliminary experiments with PV IgG and other studies (22Lanza A. Femiano F. De Rosa A.

Physiol. 2007; 210: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we preferred to set experiments in the presence of PV serum instead of isolated IgG. Primary human keratinocytes were isolated from tongue specimens of patients undergoing glossoplasty. Each specimen was rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and submerged for 30 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% antibiotics/antimycotic. The epithelial sheet was partially separated from the connective tissues after overnight incubation in dispase at 4 °C. Keratinocytes were isolated by treatment in 0.25% trypsin for 30 min at 37 °C and plated in modified FAD (F-12 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and fungizone (2.5 μg/ml) (25Cirillo N. Gombos F. Lanza A. Immunology. 2007; 121: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). FAD was than changed with serum-free keratinocyte growth medium. HaCaT cells, a human immortalized keratinocyte cell line capable of forming normally differentiated epidermis (26Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium enriched with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics/anti-mycotic, as described (22Lanza A.

Glass C.K. Palinski W. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1996-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Primary keratinocytes and HaCaT were growth at 37 °C in an atmosphere humidified with 5% CO2. At the time of the experiment, cells were seeded on 35-mm Petri plastic dishes and growth to confluence. Cell Cycle Analysis—In order to study major effects of PV serum on the keratinocyte cell cycle, HaCat keratinocytes were starved, 16 h after plating, with 0.5% of fetal bovine serum for 48 h. The starvation method has been set by the use of a colorimetric immunoassay based on the measurement of bromodeoxyuridine incorporation during DNA synthesis (cell proliferation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Roche Applied Science). Synchronized cells have been treated with PV serum (30%) and normal serum (30%) for 24 h. Fresh cells were pretreated with 100 g/ml RNase for 30 min at 37 °C and stained with 20 g/ml propidium iodide before flow cytometric analysis (FACSCalibur; BD Biosciences). Cell distribution in the G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle was calculated from the resulting DNA histogram with BD CellQuest software. Results are representative of six separate experiments in duplicate. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Differences were assessed by t test, and a p value of <0.05 was considered to be significant. Western Blot Analysis—50-μg cytosolic extracts of sample were separated by 8-12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitro-cellulose membranes as described (25Cirillo N. Gombos F. Lanza A.

Primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated species-specific IgG were diluted 1:1,000 and 1:10,000, respectively. Bound antibodies were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence immunodetection system. To ascertain that blots were loaded with equal amounts of protein lysates, filters were stripped and subsequently incubated with a polyclonal antibody against β-actin protein. Band intensity was quantified by scanning films with the LKB densitometry analysis system (27Napoli C. Quehenberger O. de Nigris F. Abete P. Glass C.K. Palinski W. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1996-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In Vitro Model of PV Using Cultured Keratinocytes—The standard protocols for treatment of keratinocyte monolayers with pemphigus serum were followed (23Swanson D.L. Dahl M.V. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1983; 81: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Cirillo N. Gombos F. Lanza A. J. Cell.

For reproducing the in vitro model of PV on cell cultures, keratinocytes were incubated with 30% sera from PV patients and controls for 24, 48, or 72 h. In some cases, cells were exposed transiently to PV serum, and the medium was replaced after selected time points (see Fig. 1, e and f, and Fig. 2, a and c). Specific changes in cytoskeleton organization, such as retraction of keratin filaments from cell borders onto nucleus and detachment of keratinocytes from one another evaluated by staining of desmosomal components, such as Dsg3, both have been considered as the hallmarks of pemphigus acantholysis in vitro (23Swanson D.L.

Shown are Western blot analyses of the following kinases: Perk, phospho-Perk, Akt, p-Akt, Ask1, αPAK, phospho-αPAK, Jak-1, Cdk2, PKR, phospho-PKR, and CK1. Loading controls were obtained by using β-actin protein. Images shown represent the typical appearance of blots obtained in three independent experiments. Differences were assessed by densitometry analyses. *, p < 0.05; #, p > 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) siRNA Treatment—Cdk2-directed siRNA pool (L-003236) and negative control pool (D-001206-13-05) were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The siRNAs were transfected at a final concentration of 100 nm using Dharmafect 1 according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The siRNAs were incubated with glass coverslip-cultured HaCaT cells overnight. Afterward, cells were treated with 30% PV and 30% control sera for both 24 and 48 h and then formalin-fixed for immunofluorescence studies or lysed as described below for Western blot analyses. The efficiency of transfection was monitored by using siglo cyclophilin B as control (D-001610-01-05) as well as by Western blot for Cdk2 expression. In Vivo Model of PV by Passive Transfer of Sera in Neonatal Mice—This study was conducted according to the Guidelines for Animal Experiments of the American Heart Association and rules of the National Institutes of Health (National Institutes of Health publication 85-23, revised 1985) and approved by the institutional care of experimental committees. All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering. Quality standards of laboratories at the University of Naples (Italy) are in accordance with rules established by the Italian Ministry of Health and the European College of Laboratory Animal Medicine. As described by Amagai et al. (30Amagai M. Tsunoda K. Suzuki H. Nishifuji K. Koyasu S. Nishikawa T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and Li et al. (31Li N. Zhao M. Hilario-Vargas J. Prisayanh P. Warren S. Diaz L.A. Roopenian D.C. Liu Z. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 3440-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), 8-12-h-old neonatal BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally through a 30-gauge needle with 150 μl of 10-fold concentrated sera. Some pups were pretreated with 100 μg/g roscovitine (32Schang L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1697: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) in 20 μl of PBS (n = 6) or 20 μl of PBS alone as a control (n = 6). After 12 h, the animals were subjected to gentle scraping of the lumbar skin to induce eventually the Nikolskiy phenomenon, and then, 24 h after injection, mice were evaluated for macroscopic blistering. Biopsies were taken from perilesional areas, if any, by using a standard 5-mm skin biopsy punch. After rinsing in PBS, these skin samples were either stored at -80 °C and subsequently subjected to RNA extraction or immediately fixed in 10% formalin for regular histological analysis. Immunofluorescence, Immunohistochemistry, and Histology—Immunofluorescence studies were carried out as described previously (24Cirillo N. Gombos F. Lanza A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 210: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 28Cirillo N. Femiano F. Gombos F. Lanza A. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 3276-3281Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on glass coverslips and incubated with normal or PV sera. After washing with PBS, cells were fixed and permeabilized in paraformaldehyde solution (3% paraformaldehyde in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100) for 20 min at room temperature and then washed three times in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin to block nonspecific sites. Samples were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody (1:10) for 1 h on ice, washed in bovine serum albumin/PBS, and fixed in 10% formalin for 10 min. Finally, cells were exposed to species-specific antibodies (1:100) conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or Texas Red (Dako Denmark A/S). In some experiments, cells were directly incubated with anti-human IgG to investigate deposits of serum antibodies in the intercellular space. Specimens were examined with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) at ×400 magnification, and fluorescence images were acquired with an Evolution VF fast digital camera (MediaCybernetics, UK). For histologic analysis, neonatal mouse tissues were fixed in 10% formalin, processed for paraffin sectioning, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin by routine methods (33Lavker R.M. Dong G. Zheng P. Murphy G.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 687-697PubMed Google Scholar, 34Napoli C. Glass C.K. Witztum J.L. Deutsch R. D'Armiento F.P. Palinski W. Lancet. 1999; 354: 1234-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded skin biopsies from pemphigus patients were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis as described in detail (33Lavker R.M. Dong G. Zheng P. Murphy G.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 687-697PubMed Google Scholar, 34Napoli C. Glass C.K. Witztum J.L. Deutsch R. D'Armiento F.P. Palinski W.

Morphometric Analysis of Cell-Cell Detachment—The extent of cell detachment (acantholysis) in cell monolayers was measured by modifying previously published protocols (35Arredondo J. Chernyavsky A.I. Karaouni A. Grando S.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 167: 1531-1544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cells were subjected to immunofluorescence procedures, and the images of 10 representative microscopic fields were recorded. The percentage of acantholysis in each field observed by immunofluorescence was computed (Adobe Photoshop) by subtracting the percentage of the area covered by the cells from the total areas of the microscopic field, taken as 100%. RNA Extraction, Microarray Analysis, and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until use. Total RNAs were extracted from mouse tissues and cultured cells using Trizol™ solution (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The integrity of the RNA was assessed by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis (virtual presence of sharp 28 and 18 S bands) and spectrophotometry (36Napoli C. de Nigris F. Welch J.S. Calara F.B. Stuart R.O. Glass C.K. Palinski W. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1360-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 37Napoli C. de Nigris F. Sica V. Methods Mol. Med. 2005; 108: 215-233PubMed Google Scholar). 5 μg of total RNA was used as starting material for the cDNA preparation. The first and second strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the GeneChip One-Cycle cDNA Synthesis Kit (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Labeled cRNA was prepared using the GeneChip IVT Labeling Kit (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following the IVT reaction, the unincorporated nucleotides were removed using RNeasy columns (Qiagen) (36Napoli C. de Nigris F. Welch J.S. Calara F.B. Stuart R.O. Glass C.K. Palinski W. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1360-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 37Napoli C. de Nigris F. Sica V. Methods Mol. Med. 2005; 108: 215-233PubMed Google Scholar). 15 μg of cRNA was for hybridization onto the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 and Affymetrix Human Genome U133 2.0 probe array cartridge. The washing and staining procedure was performed in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450. The probe arrays were scanned at 560 nm using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (GeneChip® Scanner 3000). The readings from the quantitative scanning were analyzed by the Affymetrix Gene Expression Analysis Software (37Napoli C. de Nigris F. Sica V. Methods Mol. Med. 2005; 108: 215-233PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was reverse transcribed with Superscript III (Invitrogen) using 1 μg of total RNA and 100 ng of random primers. Primer sequences and corresponding PCR conditions are shown in the supplemental data (Table S1). Results were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, used as a housekeeping gene. We used a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-specific fragment to verify the integrity of the RNA preparation. The intensity of the amplified bands was quantified by densitometry and referred to that obtained with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Quantity One; Bio-Rad). Ontology Assessment—We subjected the list of differentially expressed transcripts to gene ontology using DAVID (Data base for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery), Web-based applications that allow access to a relational data base of functional annotation (38Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Hosack D.A. Yang J. Gao W. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: P3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Densitometry analysis data are given as mean ± S.D. Differences were assessed by t test, and a p value less than 0.05 was considered to be significant. Cell Cycle Analysis—To analyze the effects of PV serum on cell cycle progression on keratinocytes, we have incubated synchronized HaCat cells with control serum (30%) and PV serum (30%) for 24 h (Fig. 1, a and b). Treatment of HaCat cells with PV serum increased the proportion of cells in S phase (from 44 to 72%) (Fig. 1, a-c). Almost no cells (0-0.03%) were found in G2/M phase with NS treatment, whereas a small percentage of cells was observed with PV serum treatment (4.2%) (Fig. 1, a and b). PV Serum Promotes Activation of Protein Kinases in Keratinocytes—The expression of selected kinases belonging to different branches of kinome was evaluated by Western blots. We determined optimal conditions in pilot assays and then incubated cells for 1, 3, 10, 30, 60, and 180 min with PV or control sera (and then the supplemented medium was removed and replaced with normal medium). After a short term exposure to serum, Perk was found to be up-regulated by PV sera (Fig. 2a). Moreover, Akt and Ask1 levels diminished in PV-treated cells in comparison with controls within 10 min (Fig. 2b). Phosphorylation of Akt was virtually abolished in cells exposed to PV sera. Later events included Jak-1, Cdk2, and PKR overexpression (Fig. 2c). On the basis of these preliminary findings, we chose to investigate more in depth Cdk2 showing higher responsiveness to PV serum (Fig. 2c). PV Sera Modulate Dose-dependently Cdk2 Expression—Western blot revealed that PV serum induced a strong 10-fold increase of Cdk2 Expression in Keratinocytes Compared with Normal Serum (Fig. 3, a and b). To further investigate correlations between PV serum (10 and 30%) and Cdk2 levels, we carried out extensive experiments by incubating cells with PV and normal sera at selected time points. Keratinocytes exposed to lower quantities (10%, v/v) of PV sera exhibited a less sustained up-regulation of Cdk2 levels in comparison with those incubated with higher concentrations (30%) of PV serum (Fig. 3c). In both conditions (10 and 30%), PV sera strongly increased the amount of Cdk2 if compared with control sera, as revealed by densitometry analysis (Fig. 3c). Pilot experiments conducted with PV isolated IgG (instead of serum) showed a similar pattern of Cdk2 overexpression (data not shown). To evaluate whether major changes in Cdk2 levels seen in cultured cells were also appreciable in vivo, we performed immunohist"

It is widely found in secretory and glandular tissues, with a possible involvement in transferrin trafficking. Transient and steady-state kinetic studies of human myosin Vc were performed using a truncated, single-headed construct. Steady-state actin-activated ATPase measurements revealed a Vmax of 1.8 ± 0.3 s-1 and a KATPase of 43 ± 11 μm. Unlike previously studied vertebrate myosin Vs, the rate-limiting step in the actomyosin Vc ATPase pathway is the release of inorganic phosphate (∼1.5 s-1), rather than the ADP release step (∼12.0–16.0 s-1). Nevertheless, the ADP affinity of actomyosin Vc (Kd = 0.25 ± 0.02 μm) reflects a higher ADP affinity than seen in other myosin V isoforms. Using the measured kinetic rates, the calculated duty ratio of myosin Vc was ∼10%, indicating that myosin Vc spends the majority of the actomyosin ATPase cycle in weak actin-binding states, unlike the other vertebrate myosin V isoforms. Consistent with this, a fluorescently labeled double-headed heavy meromyosin form showed no processive movements along actin filaments in a single molecule assay, but it did move actin filaments at a velocity of ∼24 nm/s in ensemble assays. Kinetic simulations reveal that the high ADP affinity of actomyosin Vc may lead to elevations of the duty ratio of myosin Vc to as high as 64% under possible physiological ADP concentrations. This, in turn, may possibly imply a regulatory mechanism that may be sensitive to moderate changes in ADP concentration.

Class V myosins are part of the myosin superfamily, currently composed of as many as 37 types of myosins (1Richards T.A. Cavalier-Smith T. Nature. 2005; 436: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). This diverse superfamily is constituted with proteins that have been identified from conserved sequences in the catalytic domain (motor), which are needed for actin binding and ATP hydrolysis (2Sellers J.R.

Within this actin-based molecular motor superfamily, class V myosins are one of the most ancient and widely distributed forms (4Berg J.S. Powell B.C. Cheney R.E. Mol. Biol.

In recent years, various studies using assorted scientific techniques, including both in vitro single molecule/ensemble biochemical and biophysical assays, as well as cell biological assays, have contributed to our current understanding of the mechanisms used by myosin V family members (9Wu X.S.

Myosin Vb is expressed in many tissue types, but Northern blot hybridization has shown that this protein is found primarily in the testes, kidney, liver, lung, and the heart (13Zhao L.P. Koslovsky J.S. Reinhard J. Bahler M. Witt A.E. Provance Jr., D.W. Mercer J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10826-10831Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In vivo studies have shown that myosin Vb is associated with recycling of numerous receptors, including the transferrin receptor (25Lapierre L.A. Kumar R. Hales C.M. Navarre J. Bhartur S.G.

It has been suggested that one role of myosin Vc in vivo is membrane trafficking, specifically that of the transferrin receptor, where myosin Vb is also implicated.

Myosin Va is an oligomeric protein, which is composed of a dimerized heavy chain, each containing a motor domain, a lever arm containing six IQ motifs that bind a total of six light chains (mostly or entirely calmodulins) per heavy chain, followed by a coiled-coil region and a C-terminal globular tail. The sequence alignment of the three vertebrate myosin V isoforms showed that throughout the class there is ∼50% amino acid identity. Myosin Vc, for example, shares ∼62% identity to the myosin Va and Vb motor domains, ∼20–30% identity in the coiled-coil region, and some differences in the globular tail region, such as the absence of the PEST site, found in myosin Va and Vb (14Rodriguez O.C.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2729-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and Vc has not been studied as thoroughly as myosin Va; however, the predicted structures from the amino acid sequence analysis exhibited that three isoforms are comparatively similar. The lack of the PEST domain for the myosin Vc reduces its size to ∼12 kDa smaller than the other myosin Vs. To characterize the molecular mechanism of these vertebrate myosin V isoforms, steady-state and transient solution kinetic studies have been performed using both myosin Va (32Nascimento A.A.

Ensemble solution kinetics is a powerful technique that can be used to elucidate the fundamental kinetic properties of the different types of myosin, and a detailed kinetic analysis can furthermore be used to gain insights into the chemo-mechanical coupling of the molecular motor, as done for myosin Va (34De La Cruz E.M.

One of the unique properties that distinguished the kinetic mechanism of myosin Va from the other previously studied myosins (2Sellers J.R. Ridley A. Frampton J. Myosins. 2nd Ed.

These kinetic properties are consistent with this myosin being a processive motor, i.e. a protein that undergoes multiple enzymatic cycles while at least one of the motor domains of the molecule is attached to the filamentous actin, such that it can take multiple steps (40Mehta A.D.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2729-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and showed indications that also this molecule is processive; however, direct observations that the dimerized form of this molecule is processive have not been shown. The kinetic mechanism of myosin Vc has not yet been studied in detail, and a detailed kinetic mechanism may be needed to understand its physiological function in vivo. Furthermore, the question whether myosin Vc isoform is processive or not would be of interest to unravel, because Drosophila myosin V was recently determined as a low duty ratio motor (i.e. a myosin head that spends only a small fraction of the catalytic cycle strongly bound to actin) that is presumably nonprocessive (44Toth J.

In this study, we report a full biochemical kinetic characterization of the Homo sapiens myosin Vc subfragment-1 (MVc-S1) protein. Steady-state and transient solution kinetic characterizations were performed using a recombinant single-headed MVc-S1 construct, bound with a single calmodulin. Additionally, to directly investigate if the recombinant form of the H. sapiens myosin Vc translocates actin in an in vitro actin gliding assay and, furthermore, in an attempt to visualize processive motion of single molecules of H. sapiens myosin Vc, a heavy meromyosin (HMM) 3The abbreviations used are:HMMheavy meromyosinTIRFtotal internal reflection fluorescenceMANT-2′-(or-3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-MDCCN-[2-(1-maleimidyl)-1ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carboxamideMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidPBPphosphate-binding proteineGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinMVc-S1myosin Vc subfragment-1. form of the double-headed construct, intact with six IQ motifs and an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) attached to each motor domain (eGFP-MVc-HMM) on the N-terminal end, was expressed and purified from the Sf9 baculovirus system. The biochemical kinetic characterization revealed that MVc-S1 is a low duty ratio motor, which spends most of its time during the actomyosin ATPase cycle residing in the states weakly bound to actin. Unlike the other two vertebrate myosins, Va and Vb, the kinetic cycle of myosin Vc is not rate-limited by its ADP release but by the inorganic phosphate (Pi) release, which is biochemically closer in resemblance to myosins that form ensemble structures to function in physiological conditions, such as skeletal muscle myosin II. heavy meromyosin total internal reflection fluorescence 2′-(or-3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)- N-[2-(1-maleimidyl)-1ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carboxamide 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid phosphate-binding protein enhanced green fluorescent protein myosin Vc subfragment-1. We conclude that myosin Vc is a nonprocessive motor protein and therefore employs a different mechano-chemical mechanism to perform its tasks in the cytoskeleton compared with both myosin Va and Vb. Acto-MVc has a relatively high ADP affinity, and this unusual kinetic difference may possibly make the mechanical activity sensitive to ADP concentration, i.e. the duty ratio of this motor may increase at even the moderate ADP concentrations in an in vivo environment, consistent with our kinetic simulation results, as well as reported for non-muscle myosin IIB (45Kovacs M.

In addition to the subfragment-1-like construct, a heavy meromyosin-like myosin Vc construct with an N-terminally fused enhanced GFP (eGFP-MVc-HMM) was also engineered by encoding the first 1108 amino acids, containing the motor domain, the six predicted IQ motifs, and the predicted coiled-coil region. These amplified clones were subcloned into the pFastBac1 baculovirus transfer vector (Invitrogen) designed with a FLAG epitope tag (DYKDDDDK) fused C-terminally to aid in purification (46Yang Y.

Double-stranded DNA sequencing was performed to confirm the complete nucleotide sequencing from both engineered vectors. Both constructs were coexpressed with Xenopus calmodulin in the Sf9 baculovirus system and purified essentially as described previously (46Yang Y. Kovacs M. Xu E. Anderson J.B. Sellers J.R. J. Biol.

Actin and Reagents—Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared as described previously (47Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pyrene iodoacetamide-labeled actin was prepared by labeling Cys-374 with pyrene iodoacetamide (Invitrogen) (48Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Pyrene-labeled actin was depolymerized by dialysis against G-buffer (1 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm NaN3), centrifuged, and gel-filtered using a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove free dye. Actin concentration was determined using the extinction coefficient as follows: unlabeled actin, A290 = 26,600 m-1 cm-1 (49Houk Jr., T.W. Ue K. Anal.

Labeled filaments lacking biotinylated globular actin were used for the in vitro actin gliding assay, and biotinylated filaments only for the single molecule TIRF assays. MANT-ATP and MANT-ADP were purchased from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen) and stored at -20 °C. MDCC-labeled, phosphate-binding protein (MDCC-PBP) (52Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R.

Stopped-flow Experiments—All measurements were performed using an SF-2001 stopped-flow apparatus (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX) at 25 °C. For constancy, all stopped-flow experiments were performed using buffer (SF buffer) having the same contents. The SF buffer contained the following reagents: 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm EGTA, and 50 mm KCl. To determine the kinetic parameters for Pi release, double-mixing stopped-flow experiments using MDCC-PBP (55Brune M. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R.

MVc-S1 and acto-MVc-S1 were preincubated with 0.02 units/ml of apyrase for at least 30 min at 25 °C to deplete any nucleotide in the sample when required. The optical setups of the apparatus are described in depth elsewhere (44Toth J. Kovacs M. Wang F. Nyitray L. Sellers J.R. J. Biol.

Because l-fucose (l-Fuc) is activated mainly in the form of GDP derivatives in seed plants, the salvage reactions for l-Fuc are expected to be independent from those for Glc, Gal, l-arabinose, and glucuronic acid, which are activated as UDP-sugars. For this study we have identified, in the genomic data base of Arabidopsis, the gene (designated AtFKGP) of a bifunctional enzyme with similarity to both l-fucokinase and GDP-l-Fuc pyrophosphorylase. Recombinant AtFKGP (rAt-FKGP) expressed in Escherichia coli showed both l-fucokinase and GDP-l-Fuc pyrophosphorylase activities, generating GDP-l-Fuc from l-Fuc, ATP, and GTP as the starting substrates. Point mutations in rAtFKGPs at either Gly133 or Gly830 caused loss of GDP-l-Fuc pyrophosphorylase and l-fucokinase activity, respectively. The apparent Km values of l-fucokinase activity of rAtFKGP for l-Fuc and ATP were 1.0 and 0.45 mm, respectively, and those of GDP-l-Fuc pyrophosphorylase activity for l-Fuc 1-phosphate and GTP were 0.052 and 0.17 mm, respectively. The expression of AtFKGP was detected in most cell types of Arabidopsis, indicating that salvage reactions for free l-Fuc catalyzed by AtFKGP occur ubiquitously in Arabidopsis. Loss-of-function mutants with tDNA insertion in AtFKGP exhibited higher accumulation of free l-Fuc in the soluble fraction than the wild-type plant.

Recent studies have identified a xyloglucan-specific l-fucosyltransferase, AtFUT1 (7Perrin R.M. DeRocher A.E. Bar-Peled M. Zeng W. Norambuena L. Orellana A. Raikhel N.V. Keegstra K. Science. 1999; 284: 1976-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and the related l-fucosyltransferase genes (AtFUT2–10) have also been found in the genome of Arabidopsis (8Sarria R.

Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). rhamnogalacturonan II A. thaliana l-fucokinase/GDP-l-Fuc pyrophosphorylase galacturonic acid glucuronic acid high performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection high performance liquid chromatography monosaccharide 1-phosphate 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid O. sativa l-fucokinase/GDP-l-Fuc pyrophosphorylase phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride P. sativum UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase recombinant open reading frame. GDP-l-Fuc, the activated form of l-Fuc, is generated through both de novo and salvage pathways (9Reiter W.-D. Vanzin G.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 95-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 10Bonin C.P. Reiter W.-D. Plant J. 2000; 21: 445-454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the importance of levels of GDP-l-Fuc for the architecture of l-Fuc-containing cell wall polysaccharides was demonstrated through the study of the l-Fuc-deficient mutant of Arabidopsis, mur1. The mur1 mutant has reduced l-Fuc content in RG-II because of a defect in GDP-Man 4,6-dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.47) that catalyzes the first step of conversion of GDP-Man to GDP-l-Fuc in the de novo pathway (11O'Neill M.A. Eberhard S. Albersheim P. Darvill A.G. Science. 2001; 294: 846-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 12Bonin C.P. Freshour G. Hahn M.G. Vanzin G.F. Reiter W.-D. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The loss of l-fucosyl residues indispensable for the boron-mediated dimer formation of pectic RG-II reduces the growth of rosette leaves in the mutant. The dwarf phenotype of mur1, however, can be rescued by exogenously applied monomeric l-Fuc, possibly because a compensating supply of GDP-l-Fuc is generated from l-Fuc via l-Fuc 1-phosphate (l-Fuc-1-P) in the salvage pathway (11O'Neill M.A. Eberhard S. Albersheim P. Darvill A.G. Science. 2001; 294: 846-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). It is highly probable that such salvage reactions utilizing free l-Fuc released during degradation of cell wall polysaccharides and glycoproteins also occur in normal plants; however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of salvage reactions for free l-Fuc in seed plants. The salvage pathways convert free monosaccharides to nucleotide sugars as their activated forms and involve two reaction processes, phosphorylation of the monosaccharides and formation of nucleotide sugars from monosaccharide 1-phosphates (monosaccharide 1-Ps) and corresponding nucleoside triphosphates. Whereas Glc, Gal, glucuronic acid (GlcA), galacturonic acid (GalA), and l-arabinose (l-Ara) are activated mainly as UDP derivatives, l-Fuc and Man appear as GDP derivatives in the salvage pathways (9Reiter W.-D. Vanzin G.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 95-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Recently, we have identified a UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.64), designated PsUSP (Pisum sativum UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase), with broad substrate specificity toward various monosaccharide 1-Ps in pea sprouts. Consistent with the activated forms of monosaccharides, PsUSP catalyzed the formation of UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, UDP-GlcA, UDP-GalA, and UDP-l-Ara from respective monosaccharide 1-Ps and UTP but failed to convert l-Fuc-1-P and Man-1-P to respective UDP-sugars (13Kotake T.

Ishimizu T. Hase S. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 352: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This suggests that free l-Fuc and Man are converted to the respective GDP-sugars by specific enzymes distinct from those acting on Glc, Gal, GlcA, GalA, and l-Ara in the salvage pathways. The enzymes participating in the salvage reactions for free l-Fuc have been well characterized in mammals, particularly in pigs. A pig kidney l-fucokinase (EC 2.7.1.52) specifically converts free l-Fuc to l-Fuc-1-P using ATP as the phosphate donor (15Park S.H. Pastuszak I. Drake R. Elbein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5685-5891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Based on the amino acid sequence, the l-fucokinase is categorized into the GHMP (Galactokinase, Homoserine kinase, Mevalonate kinase, Phosphomevalonate kinase) family, which includes galactokinase (EC 2.7.1.6) and l-arabinokinase (EC 2.7.1.46) found in seed plants (16Tsay Y.H. Robinson G.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 620-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 17Lange B.M. Croteau R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13714-13719Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). GDP-l-Fuc pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.30) catalyzing the formation of GDP-l-Fuc from l-Fuc-1-P and GTP has also been characterized in the pig kidney (18Pastuszak I. Ketchum C. Hermanson G. Sjoberg E.J. Drake R. Elbein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30165-30174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). By the action of the GDP-l-Fuc pyrophosphorylase, l-Fuc-1-P, possibly formed by the l-fucokinase in intact cells, is converted to GDP-l-Fuc in the presence of GTP. In short, free l-Fuc is probably collaboratively salvaged by l-fucokinase and GDP-l-Fuc pyrophosphorylase in mammalian cells. On the other hand, a bifunctional enzyme with both l-fucokinase and GDP-l-Fuc pyrophosphorylase activities, designated Fkp, has been identified in Bacteroides fragilis, which mammals harbor as a symbiont in their intestines (19Coyne M.J. Reinap B. Lee M.M. Comstock L.E. Science. 2005; 307: 1778-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Although several genes have been annotated as GHMP family proteins or nucleotide sugar pyrophosphorylases in the genomes of Arabidopsis and rice, neither l-fucokinase nor GDP-l-Fuc pyrophosphorylase has been identified so far in seed plants. To clarify the molecular mechanism of free l-Fuc salvage in seed plants, we searched the genomic data base and identified a gene that encodes a protein with similarity to both l-fucokinase and GDP-l-Fuc pyrophosphorylase in Arabidopsis. From the properties of the recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli, it can be inferred that the gene product has both l-fucokinase and GDP-l-Fuc pyrophosphorylase activities. Loss-of-function mutants were used to confirm the physiological functions of the gene product in Arabidopsis. Materials—Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col) was used in this study. The tDNA insertion lines, SALK-012400 and SALK-053913 (genetic background, Col), and the mur1-1 mutant (genetic background, Col) were provided by the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center (Loughborough, UK). Arabidopsis plants were grown on rockwool fibers (Nittobo, Tokyo, Japan) under continuous light at 23 °C for 35 days. The genotype of the At1g01220 gene in the tDNA insertion lines was determined by genomic PCR using specific primers. A partial fragment derived from the wild-type At1g01220 gene, including the tDNA insertion site in SALK-012400, was amplified by genomic PCR with specific primers 012400-F-1 (5′-GGACGGACACTCCTTGACACTGGG-3′) and 012400-R-1 (5′-GCCAATCATGCCTTGAAGGAACCC-3′), and a fragment of the wild-type At1g01220 gene in SALK-053913 was amplified with 053913-F-1 (5′-GTTGGAGCATAAAGTATGGGGAGC-3′) and 053913-R-1 (5′-ATGTGTAGCTCGTTTCCAGCGTCG-3′). The tDNA insertion was confirmed by amplifying a genomic fragment with LBb1 (5′-GCGTGGACCGCTTGCTGCAACT-3′) and 012400-F-1 in SALK-012400 and LBb1 and 053913-F-1 in SALK-053913 using ExTaq (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan) under the following conditions: 0.5 min denaturing at 94 °C, 0.5 min annealing at 65 °C, and 2.0 min amplification at 72 °C, 35 cycles. ATP, CTP, GDP, GTP, ITP, UTP, PPi, l-Ara, l-Fuc, Gal, l-Gal, GalA, Glc, GlcA, GlcNAc, Man, l-Rha, Xyl, Gal-1-P, Glc-1-P, GlcA-1-P, GlcNAc-1-P, l-Fuc-1-P, Man-1-P, Xyl-1-P, and GDP-l-Fuc were purchased from Sigma. l-Ara-1-P (β-l-arabinopyranose 1-P) was chemically synthesized according to the methods of Aspinall et al. (20Aspinall G.O. Cottrell I.W. Matheson N.K. Can. J. Biochem. 1972; 50: 574-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and MacDonald (21MacDonald D.L. J. Org. Chem. 1962; 27: 1107-1109Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Protein Determination—The concentration of protein was determined by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. In the analysis of the enzymatic properties, substrate specificities, and kinetic values, the concentration of the recombinant enzyme was determined based on the color intensity of the stain with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 on SDS-PAGE (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) compared with the bovine serum albumin standard. cDNA Cloning—Total RNA was extracted from 2-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings containing cotyledons, true leaves, and roots. The seedlings were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then homogenized with a mortar and pestle. The RNA was extracted with an Isogen kit (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Single strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA from Arabidopsis seedlings using a reverse transcriptase, ReverTra Ace-α-(Toyobo, Osaka, Japan), and an oligo(dT) adaptor primer (5′-GCGACATCATCGAATTCCGATGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′). For cloning of At1g01220 cDNA, a set of primers, At1g01220-F-1 (5′-CGAATTCATGTCTAAGCAGAGGAAG-3′) and At1g01220-R-1 (5′-GGAATTCAAATACAGATGCTCC-3′), was designed based on the genomic data base of Arabidopsis. The PCR was performed with proofreading polymerase (KOD-Plus, Toyobo) and the set of primers, using the single strand cDNA as a template under the following conditions: 0.5 min denaturing at 94 °C, 0.5 min annealing at 55 °C, and 3.0 min amplification at 68 °C, 35 cycles. The amplified cDNA fragment was treated with ExTaq at 72 °C for 5 min to allow the subsequent cloning into a pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega, Madison WI). Point mutations were introduced at Gly133 and Gly830 of At1g01220 into cDNA by PCR using sets of primers, FKGP-PM1-F (5′-AGGTGACTCCAAAAGGGTTC-3′) and FKGP-PM1-R (5′-GCAGCATGAAGCATCAATAC-3′), and FKGP-PM2-F (5′-TCTAGGAACCTCGAGCATTC-3′) and FKGP-PM2-R (5′-GCACTGCCACGAGGAACATTG-3′), respectively. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned fragment was determined with an ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Enzyme—The coding region of the cloned At1g01220 cDNA was excised from the pGEM T-Easy vector and then subcloned into an EcoRI site of a pET32a expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) to give rise to a plasmid construct, At1g01220/pET32a, which was designed to express the recombinant enzyme fused to thioredoxin and His6 tags at the N terminus. The plasmid construct was transfected into the BL21 (DE3) gold strain of E. coli (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cells were grown at 10 °C, and the recombinant protein was induced by treatment with 1.0 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 24 h. To stabilize the recombinant protein in E. coli, chaperone proteins, GroES and GroEL, were co-expressed using the pGro7 plasmid (Takara Bio Inc.). The cells were harvested and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 0.2 m NaCl, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 0.2% lysozyme from chicken egg (Wako, Osaka, Japan). The lysate was put on a 1.5 × 6.0-cm chelating Sepharose FF column (GE Healthcare, Tokyo, Japan) that had been equilibrated with the buffer without PMSF and lysozyme. The column was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 20% (w/v) glycerol, and 50 mm imidazole, and the bound protein was then eluted with the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The purified recombinant enzyme (0.2 mg from a 500-ml culture of E. coli) was digested with 1.0 unit of thrombin (Novagen) at 22 °C for 24 h to split off the fused thioredoxin and His6 tags. The purified recombinant enzyme was examined for its purity, properties, and substrate specificity. Enzyme Assay—The l-fucokinase activity of the recombinant enzyme was determined by monitoring the formation of l-Fuc-1-P in the presence of l-Fuc and ATP. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm l -Fuc, 2 mm ATP, 5% (w/v) glycerol, and enzyme in a final volume of 0.2 ml. After incubation at 35 °C, the reaction was terminated by dipping the mixture in a boiling water bath for 2 min; this assay method was defined as the standard assay condition for l-fucokinase activity. The reaction products were detected using high performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) system equipped with a CarboPac PA-1 column (4 × 250 mm, Dionex Japan, Osaka, Japan). The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–0.2 m sodium acetate in 0.1 m NaOH (0–20 min), followed by isocratic elution with 0.5 m sodium acetate in 0.1 m NaOH (20–30 min) at a flow rate of 1 ml per min. The amount of l-Fuc-1-P produced was estimated from the peak area based on the curve of standard l-Fuc-1-P. One unit of l-fucokinase activity was defined as the amount capable to produce 1 μmol of l-Fuc-1-P from l-Fuc and ATP per min. Elution times of standard sugars were 2.3 min for l-Fuc and 10.3 min for l-Fuc-1-P (supplemental Fig. S1A). The GDP-l-Fuc pyrophosphorylase activity of the recombinant enzyme was determined using a reaction mixture consisting of 50 mm MOPS-KOH buffer, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.25 m m l -Fuc-1-P, 1 mm GTP, and enzyme in a final volume of 40 μl. After incubation at 35 °C, the reaction was terminated as above (this was defined as the standard assay condition for GDP-l-Fuc pyrophosphorylase activity), and the reaction products were analyzed according to the method described previously (13Kotake T.

Olsen C.E. Nunan K.J. Scheller H.V. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 278: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The reaction products were applied to a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with a Shimadzu LC-10AD equipped with a CarboPac PA-1 column. The column was eluted with 0.05 m sodium acetate for the initial 2 min, then by a linear gradient of 0.05–1.0 m sodium acetate (2–40 min), followed by isocratic elution with 1 m sodium acetate (40–46 min) at a flow rate of 1 ml per min. The reaction products were monitored by measuring absorbance at 262 nm, and the amount of GDP-sugar produced was estimated from the peak area based on the curve of standard GDP-l-Fuc. Elution times of the standards were as follows: GDP-l-Fuc, 30.2 min; GTP, 38.9 min (supplemental Fig. S1B). One unit of GDP-l-Fuc pyrophosphorylase activity was defined as the amount capable of producing 1 μmol of GDP-l-Fuc from l-Fuc-1-P and GTP per min. The assay for pyrophosphorolysis activity of GDP-l-Fuc (reverse direction of the enzyme action) was performed in a 0.1-ml reaction mixture containing 50 mm MOPS-KOH buffer, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GDP-l-Fuc, 1 mm PPi, and enzyme. Here, the enzyme activity was measured in a manner analogous to the above with GTP as the calibration standard and expressed as μmol of GTP produced per min. Successive reactions of l-fucokinase and GDP-l-Fuc pyrophosphorylase activities were carried out using a reaction mixture consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 m m l -Fuc, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm GTP, 5% (w/v) glycerol, and enzyme in a final volume of 100 μl. After incubation at 35 °C, the reaction was terminated, and the reaction products were analyzed as described above. To identify GDP-l-Fuc (the reaction product) formed from l-Fuc, ATP, and GTP by the recombinant enzyme, the product was purified by chromatography on a charcoal column (Wako), paper chromatography, then HPLC (the details of product preparation are given in the legend of supplemental Fig. S2), and analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. The sample was dissolved in D2O, and 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 400 MHz and at room temperature with a Bruker DPX-400 spectrometer. HDO was used as the internal standard (4.78 ppm). Ring-proton assignments in NMR were made by first-order analysis of the spectra and confirmed by H-H COSY experiments. Quantitative Analysis of mRNA—The relative amount of At1g01220 mRNA was estimated by quantitative PCR. Single strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA of the tissues or organs using (dT)12–18 primer. A set of specific primers for the At1g01220 gene, At1g01220-RTP-F (5′-GAACCAGACCTTTGGGTGAA-3′) and At1g01220-RTP-R (5′-AAACCGTAGTTGCAGGGATG-3′) and for ACTIN2 (ACT2), ACT2-RTP-F (5′-ACCTTGCTGGACGTGACCT-3′) and ACT2-RTP-R (5′-CACCAATCGTGATGACTTGC-3′), were designed using the Primer 3.0 program. The PCR was performed with a SYBR Premix ExTaq kit (Takara Bio Inc.) under the following conditions: 10 s denaturing at 95 °C, 30 s annealing at 60 °C, and 20 s amplification at 72 °C, 40 cycles. The PCR product was detected with Opticon 2 (Bio-Rad), and the relative amount of the mRNA to ACT2 mRNA was calculated. Determination of Free Monosaccharide Contents in Plants—A soluble fraction containing free monosaccharides was prepared from Arabidopsis plants grown for 35 days. Aerial parts of the plants were homogenized with a mortar and pestle in water. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected as the soluble fraction. To recover free monosaccharides completely, the precipitate was homogenized again and centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was combined with the soluble fraction. The soluble fraction was applied to a 1.5 × 2.0-cm DEAE-Sephadex A-25 (GE Healthcare) column. Neutral monosaccharides were eluted with 40 ml of water, concentrated by an evaporator, and then analyzed by HPAEC-PAD as described previously (25Ishikawa M. Kuroyama H. Takeuchi Y. Tsumuraya Y. Planta. 2000; 210: 782-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Separation of standard monosaccharides is shown in supplemental Fig. S3. Identification of Bifunctional l-Fucokinase/GDP-l-fucose Pyrophosphorylase in the Arabidopsis Genome—To elucidate the salvage pathway for free l-Fuc in plants, we searched for open reading frames (ORFs) with similarity to the mouse l-fucokinase gene (Mus musculus, AJ297482) (26Niittymäki J. Mattila P. Roos C. Huopaniemi L. Sjöblom S. Renkonen R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) in the Arabidopsis genome. The BLAST search revealed that the protein encoded by ORF At1g01220 has the highest similarity (23% identical) with murine l-fucokinase. Although Arabidopsis contains several ORFs other than At1g01220 encoding GHMP kinase family proteins, including galactokinase (GAL1, At3g06580) (27Kaplan C.P. Tugal H.B. Baker A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 34: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and l-arabinokinase (ARA1, At4g16130) (28Sherson S. Gy I. Medd J. Schmidt R. Dean C. Kreis M. Lecharny A. Cobbett C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), these ORFs did not show significant similarity to the l-fucokinase sequence. We also used the amino acid sequence of human (Homo sapiens) GDP-l-Fuc pyrophosphorylase (AF017445) (18Pastuszak I. Ketchum C. Hermanson G. Sjoberg E.J. Drake R. Elbein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30165-30174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) for a BLAST search of the Arabidopsis genome. The protein encoded by At1g01220 appears to possess significant similarity (22% identical) to the GDP-l-Fuc pyrophosphorylase if one considers only the N-terminal half-region (from Trp34 to Leu565). Other ORFs possibly encoding nucleotide sugar pyrophosphorylases were less similar to the human GDP-l-Fuc pyrophosphorylase sequence. Because At1g01220 encodes a protein that shares similarities with both l-fucokinase and GDP-l-Fuc pyrophosphorylase, we designated it as AtFKGP (Arabidopsis thaliana l-fucokinase/GDP-l-Fuc pyrophosphorylase). Although the sequence similarity to the murine l-fucokinase was observed over nearly all of AtFKGP, that to the human GDP-l-Fuc pyrophosphorylase was limited to the N-terminal half-region. At1g01220 also exhibited low but significant sequence similarity (17% identical) to a bacterial bifunctional l-fucokinase/GDP-l-Fuc pyrophosphorylase, Fkp, from B. fragilis (19Coyne M.J. Reinap B. Lee M.M. Comstock L.E. Science. 2005; 307: 1778-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The cDNA for AtFKGP was isolated by reverse transcription-PCR using cDNA from Arabidopsis seedlings as the template, and the nucleotide sequence of AtFKGP was determined (supplemental Fig. S4). The comparison of the cDNA sequence with the genomic sequence of Arabidopsis (TAIR) revealed that the AtFKGP gene consists of seven exons and six introns, which is in accordance with the computer-based annotation by the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative. AtFKGP encodes a polypeptide of 1,055 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 116,351.5 Da and a theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of 5.87. The peptide sequence of AtFKGP did not contain a secretory signal or transmembrane domain, suggesting that AtFKGP exists inside the cells. A BLAST search of the rice (Oryza sativa) genome identified an ORF closely related (62% identical) to AtFKGP, which we designated OsFKGP (Oryza sativa l-fucokinase/GDP-l-Fuc pyrophosphorylase) (supplemental Fig. S4). Based on the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA, AtFKGP appeared to contain a region (from Leu129 to Lys146) similar to the pyrophosphorylase consensus motif (L(X)2GXGTXM(X)4PK) conserved for nucleotide sugar pyrophosphorylases (13Kotake T.

Yamada-Okabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14392-14397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a region from Pro826 to Ser835 of AtFKGP was highly similar to the known ATP-binding motif (PX3GL(G/S)SSA) that forms a phosphate-binding loop wrapping around the β-phosphate group of ATP in GHMP family proteins (Fig. 1A) (30Hartley A. Glynn S.E. Barynin V. Baker P.J. Sedelnikova S.E. Verhees C. de Geus D. van der Oost J. Timson D.J. Reece R.J. Rice D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both the pyrophosphorylase consensus and the ATP-binding motifs were also conserved in OsFKGP (supplemental Fig. S4 and Fig. 1A), suggesting that these motifs are important for the functions of FKGP proteins in seed plants. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that AtFKGP forms a plant FKGP family together with OsFKGP, which is apparently independent from the vertebrate l-fucokinase family and bacterial Fkp (19Coyne M.J. Reinap B. Lee M.M. Comstock L.E. Science. 2005; 307: 1778-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B).

This study investigates M-CSF-mediated MEK/ERK activation and identifies a downstream effector of this pathway. M-CSF activates MEK/ERK and induces MEK-dependent expression of the immediate early gene Egr2. Inhibition of either MEK1/2 or inhibition of Egr2 increases osteoclast apoptosis. In contrast, wild-type Egr2 or an Egr2 point mutant unable to bind the endogenous repressors Nab1/2 (caEgr2) suppresses basal osteoclast apoptosis and rescues osteoclasts from apoptosis induced by MEK1/2 or Egr2 inhibition. Mechanistically, Egr2 induces pro-survival Blc2 family member Mcl1 while stimulating proteasome-mediated degradation of pro-apoptotic Bim. In addition, Egr2 increased the expression of c-Cbl, the E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes Bim ubiquitination. M-CSF, therefore, promotes osteoclast survival through MEK/ERK-dependent induction of Egr2 to control the Mcl1/Bim ratio, documenting a novel function of Egr2 in promoting survival.

In contrast, wild-type Egr2 or an Egr2 point mutant unable to bind the endogenous repressors Nab1/2 (caEgr2) suppresses basal osteoclast apoptosis and rescues osteoclasts from apoptosis induced by MEK1/2 or Egr2 inhibition. Mechanistically, Egr2 induces pro-survival Blc2 family member Mcl1 while stimulating proteasome-mediated degradation of pro-apoptotic Bim. In addition, Egr2 increased the expression of c-Cbl, the E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes Bim ubiquitination. M-CSF, therefore, promotes osteoclast survival through MEK/ERK-dependent induction of Egr2 to control the Mcl1/Bim ratio, documenting a novel function of Egr2 in promoting survival. Although bone in young adults is continually resorbed and rebuilt in a balanced manner, unbalanced bone loss results from increased bone resorption without concomitant replacement with an equal amount of new bone. Osteoclastic bone resorption is governed primarily by the numbers of osteoclasts present at the site of bone remodeling and the activity of those osteoclasts (1Rodan G.A. Martin T.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1508-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). Therefore, factors affecting osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast survival are key to regulating the amount of bone resorbed. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) 2The abbreviations used are: M-CSFmacrophage colony-stimulating factorRANKLreceptor activator for nuclear factor-κB ligandMAPmitogen-activated proteinERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseMEKMAP kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinaseαMEMα-minimum essential mediumRTreverse transcription. and receptor activator for nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) are two cytokines both necessary and sufficient to mediate osteoclast differentiation from hematopoietic cells within the monocyte/macrophage lineage (2Takahashi N.

M-CSF binds to the receptor tyrosine kinase member c-fms, which then activates intracellular signaling through an autophosphorylation event (4Jaworowski A. Christy E. Yusoff P. Byrne R. Hamilton J.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 1011-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although M-CSF is known to promote osteoclast survival, the mechanism by which M-CSF mediates survival is unknown. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are specific protein kinases influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. All three MAP kinase pathways, namely the MEK/ERK, p38 MAPK, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase pathways, play roles in osteoclasts either in differentiation and/or in mediating osteoclast function and survival (5Gingery A.

Chemical inhibition of MEK1/2, which inhibits the phosphorylation of the MAP kinases ERK1/2, increases osteoclast apoptosis and leads to a loss of cell polarity (5Gingery A. Bradley E. Shaw A. Oursler M.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 89: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 7Nakamura H. Hirata A. Tsuji T. Yamamoto T. J. Bone Miner.

Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar). In osteoclasts, ERK activation has been demonstrated to influence survival (5Gingery A. Bradley E. Shaw A. Oursler M.J. J.

M-CSF promotes expression of the early gene response (Egr) family of transcription factors during macrophage differentiation (11Carter J.H. Tourtellotte W.G. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 3038-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This immediate early gene family is part of the Kruppel-like zinc finger transcription factor family and is comprised of Egr1, Egr2, Egr3, Egr4, and the Wilms' Tumor transcription factor. Egr1, Egr2, and Egr3 contain a repressor domain involved in binding of two corepressors, Nab1 and Nab2 (12Russo M.W. Sevetson B.R. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although the zinc finger binding domains of the Egr family members are virtually identical, the remaining domains differ significantly, implying unique functions for each of these transcription factors (14O'Donovan K.J. Tourtellotte W.G. Millbrandt J. Baraban J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 167-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Egr1 up-regulation in prostate cancer cells is thought to promote cell growth and transformation through increased expression of cyclin D1 (15Xiao D. Chinnappan D. Pestell R. Albanese C. Weber H.C.

Egr2 expression has been primarily reported to promote apoptosis through transactivation of p53, FasL, Bak, and BNIP3 or suppress proliferation through PTEN expression (20Droin N.M. Pinkoski M.J.

To date, a pro-survival role for Egr2 has not been reported in any cell type. Promotion of osteoclast apoptosis is triggered by an internal mechanism regulated by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and subsequent caspase activation (23Oursler M.J. Bradley E.W. Elfering S.L. Giulivi C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 288: 156-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c release is controlled by the influence Bcl2 family proteins have on the stability of the mitochondrial membrane. The two main classes of Bcl2 family proteins are divided by their ability to either promote or inhibit apoptotic responses and their structural similarity. Family members with the most homology to Bcl2 antagonize apoptosis. These pro-survival Bcl2 members include Bcl2, BclxL, Mcl1, and Bclw. In contrast to Bcl2, there are also family members that promote apoptosis. The pro-apoptotic members include Bax, Bak, Bim, Bad, Bik, Blk, Hrk, Bid, Bok/Mtd, and Bcl-xS, a splice variant of BclxL (24Boyd J.M. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Houghton A.B. Malstrom S. Avery B.J.

Although heterodimerization is not a requirement for the function for the pro-survival members, it is essential for the function of some members that promote apoptosis (34Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). These members are localized within the cytosol and must form a dimer with another member located on a membrane to exert their action. Expression of Bcl2 promotes survival of osteoclasts, rescues cells from cycloheximide-induced apoptosis, and reduces caspase 9 activation (23Oursler M.J. Bradley E.W. Elfering S.L. Giulivi C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 288: 156-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, Bim deficiency leads to increased bone density and increased osteoclast survival (35Akiyama T. Bouillet P. Miyazaki T. Kadono Y. Chikuda H. Chung U.I. Fukuda A. Hikita A. Seto H. Okada T. Inaba T. Sanjay A. Baron R. Kawaguchi H. Oda H. Nakamura K. Strasser A. Tanaka S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6653-6664Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, endogenous responses mediated by activation of the MEK/ERK pathway leading to altered expression of pro-survival and/or pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family members has yet to be identified. Bim levels are regulated through degradation by the 26 S proteasome (36Ley R. Balmanno K. Hadfield K. Weston C. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18811-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), and events catalyzed by polyubiquitination are mediated by the E3 ligase c-Cbl in osteoclasts (35Akiyama T. Bouillet P. Miyazaki T. Kadono Y. Chikuda H. Chung U.I. Fukuda A. Hikita A. Seto H. Okada T. Inaba T. Sanjay A. Baron R. Kawaguchi H. Oda H. Nakamura K. Strasser A. Tanaka S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6653-6664Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The Cbl proteins, c-Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-c, are RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligases (37Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A.

Tsygankov A.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 209: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In addition to controlling levels of Bim, c-Cbl modulates osteoclast resorption, motility, and podosome formation through c-Src interactions and cytoskeletal regulation (40Tanaka S. Amling M. Neff L. Peyman A. Uhlmann E. Levy J.B. Baron R. Nature. 1996; 383: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 41Sanjay A. Houghton A. Neff L. DiDomenico E. Bardelay C. Antoine E. Levy J. Gailit J.

Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Given the role M-CSF plays in supporting osteoclast survival, the molecular signals through which M-CSF promotes survival were investigated. The work reported here shows that M-CSF transiently activates the MEK/ERK pathway to promote osteoclast survival. Activation of this pathway by M-CSF leads to expression of Egr1 and Egr2. The specific roles Egr1 and Egr2 play in regulation of osteoclast survival were examined. Egr1 did not function to promote osteoclast survival, whereas the findings reported here demonstrate a novel pro-survival function for Egr2 downstream of M-CSF-mediated MEK/ERK activation. In this report we also identify the mechanism of Egr2-promoted osteoclast survival. Egr2 function is required for expression of pro-survival Bcl2 family member Mcl1, whereas Egr2 also promotes proteasome-mediated degradation of proapoptotic Bim by regulating expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl. Thus, Egr2 functions through a novel pro-survival mechanism in osteoclasts by increasing Mcl1 expression and increasing targeted degradation of Bim through up-regulation of c-Cbl. Unless otherwise noted, all chemical were purchased form Sigma-Aldrich. Osteoclast Differentiation—Mouse marrow osteoclast precursors were obtained from female Balb/c mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) as previously described (23Oursler M.J. Bradley E.W. Elfering S.L. Giulivi C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 288: 156-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Long bones of the hind limbs of 4-6-week-old mice were removed after sacrifice, and the marrow was flushed out with sterile phosphate-buffered saline. Marrow aspirates were plated at a density of 2.9 × 107 in 100-mm dishes in αMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 25 ng/ml M-CSF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 24 h. Non-adherent cells were collected and plated in αMEM, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at a density of 2 × 105 cells/cm in 24 well-plates and supplemented with 25 ng/ml M-CSF and 100 ng/ml recombinant RANKL. Cells were fed after 3 days in culture with αMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 25 ng/ml M-CSF, and 100 ng/ml recombinant RANKL. Once mature, osteoclasts were treated as per experimental design. Real-time RT-PCR—Osteoclasts were differentiated as above and serum-starved for 1 h in αMEM. After serum starvation, osteoclasts were harvested immediately for total RNA or cultured with 25 ng/ml M-CSF for the indicated period, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested for total RNA. Total RNA was harvested in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and phenol/chloroform was extracted from which 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) primers. The resulting cDNA samples were used in real-time RT-PCR analysis of Egr1 (gacgagttatcccagccaaa, ggcagaggaagacgatgaag), Egr2 (gaaggaacggaagagcagtg, atctcacggtgtcctggttc), Egr3 (agacgtggaggccatgtatc, gggaaaagattgctgtccaa), Mcl1 (gcagagcctgttgtgtgtgt, agtgaagagcacagggagga), Bim (ccctcctaggacctccattc, gcgacgtttgcactctaaca), c-Cbl (ttttgccgatgtgaaatcaa, ccatggagaatggagaggaa), and tubulin (ctgctcatcagcaagatcagag, gcattatagggctccaccacag) expression as outlined in Karst et al. (43Karst M. Gorny G. Galvin R.J. Oursler M.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 200: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Expression of Egr1, Egr2, and Egr3 transcripts was normalized to tubulin transcript levels for each sample. -Fold changes for each sample as compared with time 0 were then calculated. Data are the result of three replicate biological samples. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Western Blotting—Osteoclasts were differentiated as above and serum-starved in αMEM for 1 h. The MEK1/2 inhibitor UO126 was used at a concentration of 10 μm where indicated during serum starvation and subsequent treatments. The 26 S proteasome inhibitor MG-132 was used at a concentration of 42 nm as indicated during serum starvation and culture. After serum starvation, osteoclasts were either harvested immediately for Western blotting or cultured with 25 ng/ml M-CSF for the indicated time period, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested for Western blotting. Harvesting was accomplished by scraping into SDS sample buffer lacking β-mercaptoethanol and bromphenol blue. To ensure that equal cell protein was analyzed, total protein was quantified using the Bio-Rad Dc assay as per the manufacturer's instructions, and equal protein (60 μg) was loaded (Bio-Rad). Before loading, 1 μl of β-mercaptoethanol and bromphenol blue were added to each sample. Western blotting was carried out using antibodies directed against total and phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser-217/221), total and phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204), Egr1, Bim, ubiquitin (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), Egr2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), Nab2 (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA), Mcl1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), c-Cbl (BD Transduction Laboratories), and tubulin (E7, Hybridoma Bank, Iowa State, IA) at a 1:1000 dilution and the corresponding secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling) at a 1:10,000 dilution with chemiluminescent detection using the Pierce femto reagent. Blots were stripped and reprobed for total protein expression using a Western blot Recycling Kit (Alpha Diagnostics, San Antonio, TX). Each experiment was carried out a minimum of three times. Bim Ubiquitination Assay—Osteoclasts were differentiated as above, serum-starved for 1 h, and either harvested in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) containing sodium orthovanadate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture or incubated with 25 ng/ml M-CSF as indicated. After M-CSF treatment, osteoclasts were harvested in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as above. A 500-μg sample of the resulting cell lysates was incubated with total Bim antibody for 15 min at 4 °C, after which a 60-μl aliquot of 50% protein A-agarose slurry was added and incubated with the samples overnight at 4 °C. A 60-μg sample of total cell lysate was saved for total tubulin levels as assayed by Western blotting. After overnight incubation, beads were pelleted and washed 2 times with each of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% SDS; 10 mm Tris pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% SDS, 0.5% dideoxycholate, and 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% SDS. SDS sample buffer containing bromphenol blue and β-mercaptoethanol was then added to the beads. Samples were boiled and pelleted. The resulting supernatant was used in a Western blot for ubiquitin and stripped and reprobed for total Bim. Apoptosis Detection—Mature osteoclasts were serum-starved for 60 min and treated with 25 ng/ml M-CSF for 8 h and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde. Fixed osteoclasts were stained for 60 min with Hoechst 33258 diluted to 5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.01% Tween 20 as described in Gingery et al. (5Gingery A. Bradley E. Shaw A. Oursler M.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 89: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The cells were then tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-stained as previously described and examined using fluorescent microscopy for apoptotic osteoclasts displaying strongly condensed nuclei (5Gingery A. Bradley E. Shaw A. Oursler M.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 89: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). For apoptosis and osteoclast cell number measurements, six replicate coverslips were plated and analyzed for each treatment. Each experiment was repeated three times, where n = 6 with representative data reported. Adenovirus Infections—Adenoviral constructs for Nab2, wild type, and caEgr1 were a kind gift from Dr. M. Ehrengruber (65Ehrengruber M.U. Muhlebach S.G. Sohrman S. Leutenegger C.M. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Gene. 2000; 258: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The adenoviral construct for dominant negative MEK1 was received from L. F. Parada. Wild-type Egr2 virus was purchased from Vector Biolabs, Philadelphia, PA. An expression construct for caEgr2 containing an I268N transversion, a gift from Dr. J. Milbrandt, was used in a custom construction of the corresponding adenovirus (Vector Biolabs). Viruses were expanded and titered according to standard procedures as needed. Mature osteoclasts were infected with each indicated virus at a multiplicity of infection of 100 for 18 h before the experimental procedures. Statistical Analysis—Data obtained are the mean ± S.D. and are representative of three replicate experiments. The effect of treatment was compared with control values using Student's t test to assess significant differences using Microsoft Excel Apple software. M-CSF Transiently Activates the MEK/ERK Pathway to Promote Osteoclast Survival—Mature osteoclasts were serum-starved and treated with 25 ng/ml M-CSF for 0-30 min (Fig. 1A). A rapid increase in the phosphorylation of both MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 was induced by M-CSF. To determine whether blocking MEK could block M-CSF-mediated activation of this pathway, MEK activity was blocked through chemical inhibition of MEK1/2 by UO126 (Fig. 1B). M-CSF stimulated activation of ERK after 5 min, and chemical inhibition of MEK1/2 blocked ERK1/2 activation induced by M-CSF administration (Fig. 1B). Because these data confirmed M-CSF-mediated MEK/ERK activation, the influences of M-CSF-mediated activation of the MEK/ERK pathway on osteoclast survival were examined. To examine the role of MEK in M-CSF-mediated osteoclast survival, osteoclasts were treated with M-CSF in the presence of the MEK1/2 inhibitor, vehicle control, or no treatment. As documented previously, examination of nuclear condensation clearly delineated apoptotic osteoclasts (Fig. 1C) (5Gingery A. Bradley E. Shaw A. Oursler M.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 89: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Using this basis, the percentage of apoptotic osteoclasts associated with each treatment were determined. M-CSF treatment sustained osteoclast survival under serum-free conditions as previously described (Fig. 1D) (44Fuller K. Owens J.M. Jagger C.J. Wilson A. Moss R. Chambers T.J. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1733-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Blocking MEK1/2 activity through UO126 treatment abolished the pro-survival effects of M-CSF and increased osteoclast apoptosis (Fig. 1D). Thus, M-CSF-promoted osteoclast survival can be blocked through chemical inhibition of MEK1/2. The Immediate Early Genes Egr1 and Egr2 Are Induced by M-CSF-mediated Activation of the MEK/ERK Pathway—Because activation of the MEK/ERK pathway in response to M-CSF is crucial in supporting osteoclast survival, potential downstream targets of this pathway were next examined. The Egr (early gene response) family genes Egr1, Egr2, and Egr3 are induced by M-CSF during macrophage differentiation (11Carter J.H. Tourtellotte W.G. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 3038-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For this reason, Egr1, Egr2, and Egr3 were identified as candidate downstream effectors of the MEK/ERK pathway potentially involved in osteoclast survival. To explore this possibility, expression of the Egr transcription factors in response to M-CSF treatment of mature osteoclasts was evaluated. Mature osteoclasts were serum-starved and treated with M-CSF as indicated in Fig. 2. After M-CSF treatment, total RNA was harvested and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR for Egr1, Egr2, and Egr3 transcripts. As indicated in Fig. 2A, M-CSF treatment led to a robust and transient increase in Egr1 and Egr2 transcripts. A change in Egr3 transcript levels was not observed with M-CSF addition (data not shown). Because transcript levels of Egr1 and Egr2 were up-regulated by M-CSF, MEK-dependent protein expression of Egr1 and Egr2 downstream of M-CSF was tested. The addition of M-CSF after serum starvation increased expression of both Egr1 and Egr2 (Fig. 2B). This response was blocked through chemical inhibition of MEK1/2 (Fig. 2C). These data demonstrate that M-CSF treatment of mature osteoclasts leads to MEK-dependent expression of two Kruppel-like transcription factors, Egr1 and Egr2. Egr2 Function Suppresses Osteoclast Apoptosis—Given the rapid, transient MEK-dependent expression of these immediate early genes upon M-CSF treatment, potential roles for this gene family in suppression of osteoclast apoptosis were explored. To inhibit the function of all Egr family members, the Egr family corepressor Nab2, which binds to a specific repressor domain shared by Egr1, Egr2, and Egr3, was employed (12Russo M.W. Sevetson B.R. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6873-6877Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 13Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Apel E.D. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3545-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). We also determined if additive effects caused by MEK inhibition and Nab2 expression were evident, as this would imply separate mechanisms. An increase in osteoclast apoptosis with Nab2 expression as compared with vector infection was observed (Fig. 3A), supporting a role for the Egr transcription factors in promotion of osteoclast survival. Although both Nab2 and MEK inhibition increased osteoclast apoptosis, a further increase in osteoclast apoptosis with Nab2 expression in combination with UO126 treatment was not evident (Fig. 3A). In addition, numbers of total osteoclasts were also determined (Fig. 3B). A difference in overall total numbers of osteoclasts was not observed. A trend toward decreased overall cell numbers in osteoclasts treated with UO126 in combination with Nab2 infection as compared with either treatment alone was observed (Fig. 3B). These data suggest a role for Egr1 and/or Egr2 in M-CSF-suppressed osteoclast apoptosis and demonstrate the necessity of Egr family members in the promotion of MEK-dependent osteoclast survival. Because Nab2 expression increased osteoclast apoptosis and both Egr1 and Egr2 were expressed in response to M-CSF in mature osteoclasts, Egr1 and Egr2 were evaluated as potential regulators of osteoclast apoptosis. Wild-type forms of both Egr1 and Egr2 as well as two point mutants (caEgr1 and caEgr2) were used to test this possibility. This point mutation occurs within the repressor domain of each transcription factor and abolishes the interaction between Egr1/2 and Nab1/2. Osteoclasts were infected with each respective adenovirus and treated with M-CSF after serum starvation. Expression of ei"

Investigating combinational therapy in an established Drosophila model of Huntington's disease (HD), we show that Hsp70 and intrabody actually affect different aspects of the disease. Overexpression of human Hsp70 resulted in improved survival of HD flies to eclosion and prolonged adult life compared with intrabody treatment alone. An additive effect on adult survival was observed when the two therapies were combined. Intrabody was more successful at suppressing neurodegeneration in photoreceptors than was Hsp70. Furthermore, Hsp70 treatment alone did not block aggregation of mutant huntingtin, a process slowed by intrabody. Expression of each is restricted to the nervous system, which implies different neuronal populations respond distinctly to these treatments. Importantly, a role for endogenous Hsp70 in suppression of mutant huntingtin pathology was confirmed by a separate set of genetic studies in which HD flies deficient for Hsp70 showed significantly increased pathology. We conclude that a combinational approach of intrabody with enhanced Hsp70 expression is beneficial in addressing multiple pathologies associated with HD and has potential application for other neurodegenerative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2002615215,"Vascular ATP-sensitive K+ channels are activated by multiple vasodilating hormones and neurotransmitters via PKA. A critical PKA phosphorylation site (Ser-1387) is found in the second nucleotide-binding domain (NBD2) of the SUR2B subunit. To understand how phosphorylation at Ser-1387 leads to changes in channel activity, we modeled the SUR2B using a newly crystallized ABC protein SAV1866. The model showed that Ser-1387 was located on the interface of NBD2 with TMD1 and physically interacted with Tyr-506 in TMD1. A positively charged residue (Arg-1462) in NBD2 was revealed in the close vicinity of Ser-1387. Mutation of either of these three residues abolished PKA-dependent channel activation. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that Ser-1387, Tyr-506, and Arg-1462 formed a compact triad upon Ser-1387 phosphorylation, leading to reshaping of the NBD2 interface and movements of NBD2 and TMD1. Restriction of the interdomain movements by engineering a disulfide bond between TMD1 and NBD2 prevented the channel activation in a redox-dependent manner.

It is unclear how phosphorylation at the Ser-1387 residue in SUR2B leads to channel activation. SURs belong to the ABC transporter protein family (19Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar). All ABC proteins have an essential domain assembly, i.e. two transmembrane domains (TMD1 and TMD2) and two intracellular nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2). In addition, SURs have another transmembrane domain containing 5 helical segments termed TMD0 (Fig. 1A). The cytosolic NBDs of several ABC proteins have been crystallized (20Gaudet R. Wiley D.C.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4250-4258Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) are known to be important for nucleotide binding. How the channel is activated with nucleotide binding, however, is still not fully understood. Experimental evidence suggests that TMDs play a major role in interacting with Kir6 subunits (29Schwappach B. Zerangue N. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 26: 155-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Such interaction has been observed in recombinant Kir6.2/SUR1 channels using electronic microscopy (30Mikhailov M.V. Campbell J.D. de Wet H. Shimomura K. Zadek B. Collins R.F. Sansom M.S.P. Ford R.C. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4166-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Moreover, the TMD0 and ICL0 are involved in KATP gating by channel modulators and nucleotides (31Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41577-41580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 32Chan K.W. Zhang H. Logothetis D.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3833-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Therefore, signals of NBDs must be coupled to TMDs to fulfill channel gating. Several ABC proteins have been crystallized in full-length with TMDs (33Hollenstein K. Frei D.C. Locher K.P. Nature. 2007; 446: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 34Locher K.P.

These include the recently crystallized SAV1866 that is a homologue of mammalian ABC proteins (36Dawson R.J. Locher K.P. Nature. 2006; 443: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar) and shows the highest sequence similarity to SUR2B. Using the SAV1866 crystal structure, we modeled the core of SUR2B (SUR2B_core) containing TMD1, TMD2, NBD1, and NBD2 with particular attention to conformational changes after Ser-1387 phosphorylation. Our combined studies of modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, functional assays, and mutational analysis showed that Ser-1387 was located on the interface between TMDs and NBDs where it formed a triad with Tyr-506 and Arg-1462 after phosphorylation. The triad appeared to strengthen the interaction of NBD2 with TMD1, and enhanced the necessary force coupling between the two protein domains for channel gating. The model also indicates that the NBD-TMD interaction in SURs can be well represented by the SAV1866 structure. Modeling of the SUR2B_core was based on the crystal structure of SAV1866 (PDB: 2HYD). The sequences of SAV1866 were aligned with both halves of the SUR2B_core (TM-NBD1 and TM-NBD2) using ClustalW. SAV1866 was 21.5% identical to the TM-NBD1 of SUR2B (46.5% similarities) and 21.3% to TM-NBD2 (47.8% similarities). The NBDs were highly conserved: 28.7% identical in NBD1 and 33.5% identical in NBD2. SAV1866_TMD were 16.0 and 12.8% identical to SUR2B_TMD1 and TMD2, respectively (∼35% when amino acids with similar side chains were considered). Although the homology in amino acid sequences of TMDs is low, they can be aligned using the conserved topology within each TMD, i.e. six transmembrane helices (determined by hydrophobicity of the residues) in each domain with similar lengths. The sizes and positions of extracellular and intracellular linker regions were also comparable. There were only a few short gaps in the alignment (4 in TMD1 and 2 in TMD2, supplemental Fig. S1). The atomic coordinates of amino acids, nucleotides, and water molecules in the template (SAV1866) were transferred to the SUR2B_core model. The ADP molecule in the first nucleotide-binding pocket was replaced with ATP. The coordinates of ATP-binding Mg2+ and ADP-binding Mg2+ were obtained using the crystal structures of the ABC transporters HlyB (1XEF) and TAP1 (1JJ7), respectively. The linker regions between TMD1 and NBD1 (residues 618–665), and between TMD2 and NBD2 (residues 1290–1309) were modeled as surface loops in the structure. The linker between NBD1 and TMD2 (residues 914–975) was omitted from the model because of the lack of a template. Energy minimization was performed using 1000 steps of conjugate gradient optimization with the latest AMMP potential set (version tuna) (37Chen X. Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. J. Mol. Model. 2004; 10: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The model was viewed with PyMOL. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to study the conformational change in the NBD-ICL2 interface. The SUR2B_core model contained many hydrophobic transmembrane segments that would require a very large molecular dynamics simulation including the lipid bilayer. Therefore, we constructed two models containing NBDs and an extended segment of ICL2 (residues 500–512) with and without a phosphate group linked to atom Og of Ser-1387. 7500 H2O were added to the model molecules to ensure an aqueous environment. Additional ions were added to neutralize the total charge of the protein. No screening dielectric term or bulk solvent correction was included. A constant dielectric of one was used. The amortized fast multipole algorithm in AMMP was used for the long-range terms in the non-bonded and electrostatic potentials so that no cutoff radius was employed (38Harrison R.W. Gatton T.M. Dey P.P. Amin M.N. Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Science and Its Applications. U.S. Education Service LLC, San Diego, CA2003: 71-81Google Scholar). Simulations were performed with a constant NVT ensemble corresponding to a pressure of about 1 atm with the classical molecular mechanics MD program AMMP (37Chen X. Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. J. Mol. Model. 2004; 10: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 39Harrison R.W. Weber I.T. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1353-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The temperature was set at 310 K. 1000 frames, one for each picosecond, were logged over a 1-ns MD run. The mode structures, which represent the most frequent position of each atom (37Chen X. Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. J. Mol. Model. 2004; 10: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the root mean-squared deviation of Cαs of each residue were calculated over 1000 frames. Rat Kir6.1 (GenBank™ D42145) and mouse SUR2B (GenBank™ D86038) were used in the present study. The cDNAs were cloned in a eukaryotic expression vector pcNDA3.1. Site-specific mutations were generated using a site-directed mutagenesis kit based on the Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cDNAs were expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) as previously described (5Shi Y. Wu Z. Cui N. Shi W. Yang Y. Zhang X. Rojas A. Ha B.T. Jiang C. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2007; 293: R1205-R1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Whole-cell patch clamp experiments were performed as detailed in a previous work (supplemental Fig. S2) (5Shi Y. Wu Z. Cui N. Shi W. Yang Y. Zhang X. Rojas A. Ha B.T. Jiang C. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2007; 293: R1205-R1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Data are presented as means ± S.E. Differences in means were tested with the analysis of variance or Student's t test and accepted as significant if p ≤ 0.05. Modeling of the SUR2B_Core—The dimerized SAV1866 was crystallized in the ADP-binding form (PDB: 2hyd). Based on this structure, we built a model of the SUR2B_core in which sequence identities to SAV1866 are 21.5% for the TM-NBD1 of SUR2B (46.5% similarities), and 21.3% for TM-NBD2 (47.8% similarities) (supplemental Fig. S1). NBD1 and NBD2 formed a tight heterodimer (Fig. 1C). There were two nucleotide-binding pockets on the interface between NBD1 and NBD2. A MgATP molecule was incorporated in the first nucleotide-binding pocket and a MgADP in the second pocket. Different nucleotides were used, because the first pocket was likely to be a high affinity ATP-binding site, and the second was likely to bind to MgADP (18Matsuo M. Kimura Y. Ueda K. J Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2005; 38: 907-916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 40Bienengraeber M. Alekseev A.E. Abraham M.R. Carrasco A.J. Moreau C. Vivaudou M. Dzeja P.P. Terzic A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1943-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the SUR2B_core model, TMDs interact with NBDs via four short helices of intracellular linkers (ICLs, Fig. 1C). ICL1 and ICL3 interacted with the NBD surface across the nucleotide-binding regions. ICL2 from TMD1 inserted deeply into NBD2, while ICL4 from TMD2 inserted into NBD1 (Fig. 1C). NBD2 formed a spindle-like groove where a β-sheet (β5) formed the bottom while the Q-loop, C-loop, and several α-helices (α2, α3, and α6) lined the wall. Ser-1387 was located on β5 within the reach of ICL2 (<4 Å, Fig. 1D). The side-chain of an aromatic residue (Tyr-506) in ICL2 was inserted deeply into the NBD2 groove and was close to Ser-1387 in ∼4 Å (Fig. 2A). Around Ser-1387 there was a positively charged residue (Arg-1462) in NBD2 at a distance that allows electrostatic interaction between them when Ser-1387 is phosphorylated (Fig. 2A). Activation of the Kir6.1/SUR2B Channel by Protein Kinase A—In our previous studies (5Shi Y. Wu Z. Cui N. Shi W. Yang Y. Zhang X. Rojas A. Ha B.T. Jiang C. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2007; 293: R1205-R1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Yang Y. Shi Y. Guo S. Zhang S. Cui N. Shi W. Zhu D. Jiang C. Biochem. Biophys. Act. 2008; 1778: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we found that β-adrenergic receptor agonists and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide activated vascular KATP channels in the rat mesenteric artery, a response that could be reproduced in recombinant Kir6.1/SUR2B channels expressed in HEK293 cells. We thereby chose to use the recombinant Kir6.1/SUR2B in our current study because the expression system allowed us to manipulate the channel protein. Also because PKA is a common signal molecule by which multiple hormonal vasodilators activate the channel, we used forskolin (10 μm) to investigate the PKA effects. Kir6.1 and SUR2B were expressed in HEK293 cells. Forskolin was applied to the cell when the baseline currents were stabilized in 4–6 min. The exposure to forskolin activated K+ currents that were sensitive to both pinacidil and glibenclamide (Fig. 2B; supplemental Fig. S2). After currents were normalized between maximum channel inhibition by 10 μm glibenclamide and maximum activation by 10 μm pinacidil, the baseline currents averaged 6.0 ± 1.9% (n = 10) of the maximum channel activity. Forskolin (10 μm) increased the currents to 38.5 ± 3.0% (n = 10, Fig. 2E). Elimination of PKA Activation by Mutation at Arg-1462 or Tyr-506—In the SUR2B_core model, a positively charged residue Arg-1462 was located in the close vicinity of Ser-1387. The distance of the charge of Arg-1462 (measured at the center of two Nh atoms) to the Ser-1387 side chain (Og) was ∼8 Å (Fig. 2A). Such a distance may allow an electronic attraction when Ser-1387 is phosphorylated. The mutation of Arg-1462 to alanine indeed eliminated the forskolin-induced channel activation (Fig. 2C). Based on our model prediction, a positive charge at this site is important. This prediction was verified by mutating the Arg-1462 to lysine, and the R1462K mutant remained strongly activated by forskolin (68.5 ± 5.8%, n = 5). The Arg-1462 is located in a consensus PKA site (RKSS), although neither Ser-1464 nor Ser-1465 is a functional PKA phosphorylation site (5Shi Y. Wu Z. Cui N. Shi W. Yang Y. Zhang X. Rojas A. Ha B.T.

Thus, a positively charged residue critical for the PKA-dependent channel activation is identified in the SUR2B_core model, although it is far from Ser-1387 in the primary sequence. An aromatic residue, Tyr-506, was found on the ICL2 segment, the side chain of which dipped deeply into NBD2 and physically interacted with Ser-1387 (Fig. 2A). When the Tyr-506 was mutated to alanine, the forskolin-induced channel activation was almost completely abolished (Fig. 2D). A phenylalanine residue is found at the corresponding site in SAV1866 and ICL4 of SUR2B (supplemental Fig. S1). Phenylalanine has a similar side chain as tyrosine but lacks a hydroxyl group. Interestingly, when Tyr-506 was mutated to phenylalanine, the channel failed to be activated by forskolin (Fig. 2E), indicating that the hydroxyl group of Tyr-506 residue is required for channel activation. Formation of the Ser-1387/Arg-1462/Tyr-506 Triad Following PKA Phosphorylation—Our modeling suggests that PKA phosphorylation at Ser-1387 may induce local conformational changes. To understand these changes, we used MD simulations to reveal changes in residues and the peptide backbone. Our SUR2B_core contained many hydrophobic transmembrane segments that would necessitate time-consuming simulations in the lipid bilayer environment. We therefore constructed two additional models consisting of NBDs and the ICL2 helix with and without Ser-1387 phosphorylation. MD simulations were undertaken at 310 K and 1 atm. After 1000 runs, ICL2 still stayed in the NBD2 groove, suggesting a strong interaction between ICL2 and NBD2. The side chain distances among the three critical residues were monitored (Fig. 3, A and B). Without phosphorylation, the average distance between Tyr-506 and Ser-1387 was 3.8 Å, a distance that allows hydrogen bond formation between these two residues. The Tyr-506/Arg-1462 and Ser-1387/Arg-1462 distances were around 6–7 Å (Fig. 3, A and C), suggesting that there is no direct contact between Arg-1462 and the other two residues before Ser-1387 phosphorylation. When the Ser-387 was phosphorylated, distances of all three were less than 4 Å (Fig. 3C), indicating formation of a compact triad (Fig. 3, D and E). The hydroxyl group of Tyr-506 appeared to be critical for stabilization of the triad, which was able to form hydrogen bonds with oxygen atoms of the phosphate group of pSer-1387 and Nh atoms in Arg-1462, consistent with our observation that forskolin failed to activate the Y506F mutant (Fig. 2E). The Movement of ICL2—Following phosphorylation, the Tyr-506 Cα atoms moved by 9.2 Å in the mode structures. The movement led to a horizontal shift of ICL2 from a position close to the center of NBD2 toward the edge of NBD2 along the NBD2 groove. Because the MD data were acquired after removing most TMDs, the restriction of ICL2 by TMDs was not evaluated. Therefore, this ∼10 Å movement might be overestimated. However, the direction appeared reasonable. The Arg-1462 was located at the end of the α6-helix, close to the edge of NBD2, while Ser-1387 was located on the bottom of the NBD2 groove. With the triad formation, ICL2 was pulled toward NBD2 with lateral sliding along the groove. Meanwhile, the α2-helix in NBD2 made a lateral move and left space for ICL2 (Fig. 4C). Reshaping of the NBD2 Groove by Phosphorylation—Studying the conformations of NBD2 of pre-versus post-phosphorylation, we found that NBD2 underwent major conformational changes on the interface with ICL2. The groove for ICL2 binding consisted of residues from β5, α2, α3, α6, Q-loop, and C-loop. The Arg-1462 was the last residue of the long α6-helix, located close to the edge of NBD2. The α6-helix was expected to be stable because it was buried in the structure. Indeed, Cαs in the corresponding segment in NBD1 did not significantly change their positions (1.8 ± 0.2 Å, Fig. 5D) in comparison to overall movements of Cαs in NBDs (3.4 ± 0.1 Å). However, the phospho-Ser-1387 (pSer-1387) attracted the positively charged Arg-1462, moving the residue by 4.5 Å toward ICL2 (measured at Cα, Fig. 5, C and D). This movement had major effects on the C-terminal-half (tail) of α6 (residues 1455–1462) but not the N-terminal-half (head) (residues 1448–1454). The average movement of Cαs in the tail was 4.2 ± 0.3 Å, much greater than the head (2.2 ± 0.3 Å). Consequently, the α6-helix was slightly bent around Phe-1454 and turned toward ICL2 with an angle ∼10°. The movement of the α6-helix appeared to cause the α3-helix to move toward ICL2 about 4.2 ± 0.7 Å. Similar to the head of the α6-helix, the Q-loop was quite stable (2.4 ± 0.3 Å). The Cαsinthe β5-sheet moved toward ICL2 with a distance of 3.0 ± 0.4 Å. The β5 movement was greater than the overall movements of β-sheets in NBD2 (2.3 ± 0.2 Å, p = 0.11) and the corresponding segment in NBD1 (2.4 ± 0.2 Å, p = 0.07). The movement of these segments toward ICL2 suggested a stronger interaction between ICL2 and NBD2 following phosphorylation. In the model, we also observed a large movement (6.9 ± 0.3 Å) of the α2-helix. The α2-helix appeared flexible in the SUR2B_core model; it moved toward the edge of NBD2 and yielded space for ICL2. To make sure that these movements were not random events, the MD simulations were repeated twice for a total of three times with different starting velocities. We observed the same triad formation and protein domain movements in every run. Therefore, even though there may be technical limitations in the MD simulations, we were able to conclude that ICL2 interacted with NBD2 rather loosely before phosphorylation, and the interaction of the two domains was strengthened with the Tyr-506/pSer-1387/Arg-1462 triad formation after phosphorylation. Restriction of the Interdomain Movement by an Introduced Disulfide Bond—Mutations were engineered in the channel to test the hypothesis that interdomain motion plays a critical role in PKA-dependent channel activation. Forming a disulfide bond between the two domains can restrict the motion thus limiting the channel activation if the motion is critical. Examining all residues in the NBD2 groove and ICL2, we found that a cysteine (Cys-1408) on the wall of the NBD2 groove was close to Ala-507 in ICL2 (Fig. 6A). The distance between the Cαsof the two residues was ∼8 Å. When the Ala-507 was mutated to cysteine, the channel activation by forskolin was completely eliminated (Fig. 6B). Because the Ala-507 is located next to Tyr-506, the mutation itself instead of the disulfide bond formation could have affected the channel activation. To address this possibility, we included 3 mm reduced glutathione in the pipette solution and found that the Kir6.1/SUR2B_A507C channel activation by forskolin was nicely restored (29.7 ± 3.0%, n = 5, Fig. 6C). To show whether the introduced Cys-507 indeed formed a disulfide bond with Cys-1408, but not with another unidentified cysteine residue, we mutated Cys-1408 to serine, a residue close to cysteine in side chain properties but unable to form disulfide bonds. The mutant channel (Kir6.1/SUR2B_A507C_C1408S) was activated by forskolin to the same extent as the wild-type channel (Fig. 6, D and E). Thus, the formation of an artificial disulfide bond between residues 507 and 1408 locked the channel in the pre-phosphorylation state and disrupted the channel activation by forskolin, supporting the hypothesis that a relative movement between ICL2 and NBD2 is necessary for channel activation by PKA. We also tried to use the disulfide bond to lock the channel in its open state without success. Modeling SUR2B_Core with SAV1866—The regulatory subunits SURs (ABCC8 and ABCC9) of KATP channels belong to the ABC transporter superfamily. Four ABC proteins have been crystallized in full-length with TMDs and NBDs. The NBDs are similar to each other in their overall structures and assemblies. The TMDs however, are quite different. There are 10 TMHs in each TMD in HI1470/1 (35Pinkett H.W. Lee A.T. Lum P. Locher K.P. Rees D.C. Science. 2007; 315: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and BtuCD (34Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), while there are 6 in each TMD in SAV1866 (36Dawson R.J. Locher K.P. Nature. 2006; 443: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar) and ModBC (33Hollenstein K. Frei D.C. Locher K.P. Nature. 2007; 446: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The TMD in ModBC is much shorter than that in SUR2B, and no evident sequence homology can be found between them. In contrast, the TMD topology of SAV1866 is the same as that of SUR2B, suggesting the validity of modeling the SUR2B_core based on the SAV1866 structural template. In our SUR2B_core model, NBD1 and NBD2 dimerize to form two nucleotide-binding pockets on their interface, consistent with the models of SUR1-NBDs in previous studies (41Campbell J.D. Proks P. Lippiat J.D. Sansom M.S.P. Ashcroft F.M. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S123-S127Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 42Campbell J.D. Sansom M.S.P. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A significant development of our model is to include TMDs and to show the interaction between TMDs and NBDs. SUR2B_TMD1 interacts with NBDs via two short segments ICL1 and ICL2. ICL1 interacts with both NBDs at their borders around the first nucleotide-binding region, while ICL2 is inserted deeply into NBD2. Therefore, the TMD1 mainly interacts with the NBD2. Similar cross-interaction is found in TMD2-NBD1. Our disulfide bond experiment and functional analysis indicate that Cys-1408 in NBD2 is located close to Ala-507 in the TMD1. Evidence supporting such a TMD-NBD cross-interaction also comes from a recent biochemical study (43Zolnerciks J.K. Wooding C. Linton K.J. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3937-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) on human multidrug transporter (ABCB1), a close homologue of SURs. Importance of Defining the TMD-NBD Interaction in SURs—The TMD-NBD interaction in SUR2B is not only important for PKA activation, but may also provide a structural basis to explain SUR-mediated channel gating by other ligands. For instance, it is well known that NBDs are important for Mg2+-nucleotide activation on KATP channels (13Gribble F.M. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 25Shyng S. Ferrigni T. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 26Yamada M. Ishii M. Hibino H. Kurachi Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 28Matsuo M. Dabrowski M. Ueda K. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4250-4258Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although KCOs activate KATP channels via binding to segments in TMDs (12Moreau C. Prost A-L. Derand R. Vivaudou M. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2005; 38: 951-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), NBDs are also necessary for KCO effects (13Gribble F.M. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 24Yamada M. Kurachi Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1198-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25Shyng S. Ferrigni T. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), suggesting an allosteric modulation between these two distinct groups of channel activators. It is unclear how signals in NBDs are coupled to TMDs. Indeed, cis-interaction (TMD1 interacts with NBD1, TMD2 with NBD2) has been assumed to occur in SUR1 (31Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41577-41580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and SUR2 (24Yamada M. Kurachi Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1198-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) based on the mis-assembled MSBA structure (44Chang G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Therefore, experimental demonstration of the SAV1866-based NBD-TMD cross-interaction in SUR2B contributes significantly to the understanding of the SUR-mediated gating of KATP channels. Mechanism of Channel Activation by PKA Phosphorylation—The SUR2B_core model improves our understanding of the mechanism underlying PKA activation of vascular KATP channels. Ser-1387 is a critical phosphorylation site for PKA-dependent activation of Kir6.1/SUR2B channel (5Shi Y. Wu Z. Cui N. Shi W. Yang Y. Zhang X. Rojas A. Ha B.T. Jiang C. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2007; 293: R1205-R1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Data from the current study further support its role in channel activation. Phosphorylation of Ser-1387 leads to a change in the NBD2 conformation and strengthens the interaction of NBD2 with ICL2 through the formation of an interacting triad of residues in different protein domains. Every residue of the triad is critical, as shown in our mutational analysis. The interaction of pSer-1387 and Arg-1462 is apparently caused by the electrostatic attraction. The interactions of Tyr-506 with the other two seem to rely on hydrogen bonds. Our simulation study indicates that the triad is stable and may act as a primary force for the changing conformations of NBD2 and IC2 on their interface. ICL2 appears to move toward NBD2 with phosphorylation, while NBD2 is reshaped and moves toward ICL2, especially the α6-tail and the α3-helix and probably the β5-sheet as well. Thus the two domains interact with each other more tightly post-phosphorylation, allowing NBDs to couple with TMDs more effectively. Such a strong NBD-TMD coupling is likely to ensure the transfer of mechanical forces and movements necessary for channel gating between these protein domains. Because such a coupling is weakened without Ser-1387 phosphorylation, the mechanical forces and movements produced in NBDs may not be sufficient for channel gating. By enhancing the NBD-TMD interaction, vasodilators seem to be able to use the existing forces to augment the channel activity without producing additional mechanical work. It is noteworthy that the NBD-TMD force transfer depends on elaborate interactions of the triad, as restriction of these domains with a disulfide bond does not lead to channel activation. Possible Cooperation of PKA and Nucleotide Activators—The SAV1866 is crystallized in ADP-binding forms (PDB: 2hyd), which is represented as a dimer in NBDs. The NBD dimerization has been seen in almost all the ABC proteins including NBDs of SUR1 (41Campbell J.D. Proks P. Lippiat J.D. Sansom M.S.P. Ashcroft F.M. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S123-S127Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 42Campbell J.D. Sansom M.S.P. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In our SUR2B_core model, the two NBDs form a heterodimer with two nucleotide-binding pockets on the interface. Such dimerization of NBD1 and NBD2 in SURs suggests a channel conformation in the active state. Nevertheless, the channel activity is rather low (less than 10% of maximal activity by pinacidil according to our observation in previous and current studies), probably because the interaction between TMDs and NBDs is quite loose at the baseline. PKA phosphorylation enhances the interaction of TMD1 (via ICL2) with NBD2 and thus drastically activates the channel. It is possible that the NBD dimerization by nucleotide binding is necessary for PKA activation. A study (45Light P.E. Manning Fox J.E. Riedel M.J. Wheeler M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2135-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) on the Kir6.2/SUR1 channel indeed indicates that ADP concentrations determine whether the channel is activated or inhibited by PKA. Although we have not observed inhibition on Kir6.1/SUR2B, we did see a reduction in the PKA effects with decreasing ADP concentrations. 5Y. Shi, Z. Wu, and C. Jiang, unpublished data. It is of interest to know whether PKA acts on the channel without nucleotides. In conclusion, the SAV1866-based modeling provides novel information of SUR2B structures, and suggests a mechanism for the Kir6.1/SUR2B channel activation by PKA phosphorylation, information that is necessary for the understanding of how vasodilators activate KATP channels and relax vascular tension. The discovery of the Ser-1387/Tyr-506/Arg-1462 triad and its critical location for the interaction between TMDs and NBDs contribute significantly to our understanding of SUR-mediated KATP channel gating. Furthermore, our combined studies of SUR2B_core model with mutational analysis support the accuracy of the SAV1866 crystal structure on the NBD-TMD interface and indicate that the SUR2B can be well represented by the SAV1866 structure.

Although FXa is known to specifically inhibit the Arg506 cleavage, the effect of prothrombin has not been confined to one cleavage site. We used recombinant FV variants, FV:R506Q/R679Q and FV:R306Q/R679Q, to investigate the effect of prothrombin on the individual cleavage sites. The APC-mediated FVa inhibition was monitored by a prothrombinase-based FVa assay, and apparent first order rate constants were calculated for each of the cleavage sites both in the presence and absence of prothrombin. Prothrombin impaired cleavages at both Arg306 and Arg506 and the inhibition correlated with a delayed appearance of proteolytic products on Western blots. Almost complete inhibition was obtained at around 3 μm prothrombin, whereas half-maximal inhibition was obtained at 0.7 μm prothrombin. After cleavage of prothrombin by thrombin, the inhibitory activity was lost. The inhibitory effect of prothrombin on APC-mediated inhibition of FVa was seen both in the presence and absence of protein S, but in particular for the Arg306 sites, it was more pronounced in the presence of protein S. Thus, prothrombin inhibition of APC inactivation of FVa appears to be due to both impaired APC function and decreased APC cofactor function of protein S. In conclusion, FVa, being part of the prothrombinase complex, is protected from APC by both FXa and prothrombin. Release of products of prothrombin activation from the prothrombinase complex would alleviate the protection, allowing APC-mediated inactivation of FVa.

Normal hemostasis is the result of a delicate balance between pro- and anticoagulant pathways, thrombin playing key roles in both (1Dahlback B. J. Intern.

Prothrombin (PT), the precursor of thrombin, is the most abundant of the vitamin K-dependent zymogens, circulating in blood at a concentration of 1.4 μm. PT is activated by factor Xa (FXa) by sequential cleavages of two peptide bonds. During activation of PT, activated FV (FVa) plays a crucial role, since it binds to FXa on negatively charged membrane surfaces, thus forming the prothrombinase (PTase) complex (4Mann K.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 6Kalafatis M. Swords N.A. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1227: 113-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this complex, the catalytic efficiency of FXa is increased 105–106-fold as compared with FXa alone. FVa promotes the binding of FXa to the membrane surface and in addition increases the kcat of FXa for PT (7Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W. Zwaal R.F. Hemker H.C. J. Biol.

Moreover, FVa promotes the binding of PT to the PTase complex, thus lowering the Km for the reaction (9Rijn van J.L. Govers-Riemslag J.W. Zwaal R.F. Rosing J.

This loss in FVa activity is caused by a 40-fold reduction in FXa binding affinity (24Gale A.J. Xu X. Pellequer J.L. Getzoff E.D. Griffin J.H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2091-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The Arg306 cleavage is required for full loss of FVa function. After cleavages at both Arg306 and Arg506, the 306–506 fragment dissociates, which results in complete loss of FVa activity (25Mann K.G. Hockin M.F. Begin K.J. Kalafatis M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20678-20683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The importance of the cleavage at Arg679 has not been fully elucidated, but it is believed that this cleavage plays a minor role in the inactivation of FVa. The physiological importance of the APC cleavage sites in FVa is demonstrated by naturally occurring point mutations. The most common is a substitution of Arg506 with a Gln (FV Leiden), resulting in the APC resistance phenotype (26Bertina R.M. Koeleman B.P. Koster T. Rosendaal F.R. Dirven R.J. Ronde de H. der Velden van P.A. Reitsma P.H. Nature. 1994; 369: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (3811) Google Scholar, 27Dahlback B. Carlsson M. Svensson P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This is associated with a 5–10-fold increased risk for venous thrombosis in heterozygous carriers and 50–100-fold in homozygous cases. Two naturally occurring mutations affect the Arg306 site, FV Hong Kong (R306G) and FV Cambridge (R306T) (29Chan W.P. Lee C.K. Kwong Y.L. Lam C.K. Liang R. Blood. 1998; 91: 1135-1139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Williamson D. Brown K. Luddington R. Baglin C. Baglin T. Blood. 1998; 91: 1140-1144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, although the Arg306 cleavage is believed to be of crucial importance for the FVa inactivation, these mutations are not associated with an increased risk for venous thrombosis and APC resistance in heterozygous carriers (31Shen M.C. Lin J.S. Tsay W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Several plasma proteins affect the rate of FVa inactivation by APC. Protein S is an important cofactor to APC, mainly enhancing the cleavage at Arg306 (23Rosing J. Hoekema L. Nicolaes G.A. Thomassen M.C. Hemker H.C. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Tans G. J. Biol.

PT has also been reported to inhibit the APC-mediated inactivation of FVa (34Mitchell C.A. Jane S.M. Salem H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 2142-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 35Smirnov M.D. Safa O. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. Blood. 1999; 94: 3839-3846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Smirnov M.D. Safa O. Regan L. Mather T. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Rezaie A.R. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9031-9040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It was originally suggested that PT inhibited the APC cleavage by serving as a competitive inhibitor to protein S (34Mitchell C.A. Jane S.M. Salem H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 2142-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, more recent studies demonstrated inhibition of APC-mediated FVa inactivation also in the absence of protein S (35Smirnov M.D. Safa O. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. Blood. 1999; 94: 3839-3846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Smirnov M.D. Safa O. Regan L. Mather T. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Rezaie A.R. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9031-9040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the PT-dependent inhibition of APC and/or protein S is not known. Moreover, it is not known which of the APC cleavage sites in FVa are affected by the PT inhibition. The aim of the present study was to further elucidate the mechanisms of the PT-mediated inhibition of the FVa inactivation. In particular, we wanted to determine the effect of PT on the individual APC cleavage sites in FVa. For this purpose, recombinant FV variants, FV:R506Q/R679Q and FV:R306Q/R679Q, that were only cleaved at Arg306 or Arg506, respectively, were used. PT was found to inhibit both Arg306 and Arg506 cleavages to similar extents. The inhibition did not require the presence of protein S but was more prominent when protein S was present. Reagents—Human FXa and PT were from Kordia (Leiden, Netherlands). Human α-thrombin was from Haematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Recombinant human wild-type protein C was expressed, isolated, and activated as described (37Shen L. Shah A.M. Dahlback B. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16025-16031Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the APC concentration was determined by chromogenic substrate S2366. Human protein S was purified as reported (38Dahlback B. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) with minor modifications, as described (39Dahlback B. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12769-12777Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody AHV-5146 against the heavy chain of human FV was from Haematologic Technologies. Ovalbumin and bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma. The natural phospholipids phosphatidylserine (brain extract), phosphatidylethanolamine (egg extract), and phosphatidylcholine (egg extract) as well as synthetic phospholipids 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylserine, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine, and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). The synthetic substrates S2366 and S2238 were kindly provided by Chromogenix (Milan, Italy). Dynabeads M-128 was from Dynal Biotech ASA (Oslo, Norway). Hirudin was from Pentapharm (Basel, Switzerland). Trypsin inhibitor type II-S (soybean) was from Sigma, and snake venom Echis carinatus (Ecarin) was from Sigma. Expression and Quantification of Recombinant Factor V Variants—The recombinant FV variants R306Q/R679Q and R506Q/R679Q have been utilized in previous studies and were constructed and transiently expressed as previously described (40Norstrom E. Thorelli E. Dahlback B. Blood. 2002; 100: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The proteins were harvested in serum-free medium (Opti-MEM) 60–70 h after transfection and concentrated in Vivaspin concentrator with a molecular weight cut-off of 100,000 (Vivaspin). Aliquots were frozen at –80 °C. The concentrations of the recombinant proteins were determined with both an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the PTase assay. The ELISA for factor V was performed as described (40Norstrom E. Thorelli E. Dahlback B. Blood. 2002; 100: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Affinity Purification of Recombinant FV Variants—The recombinant FV variants were purified as previously described (41Sun Y.H. Tran S. Norstrom E.A. Dahlback B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47528-47535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In brief, a biotinylated monoclonal antibody against the B-chain of FV (MK30) was bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. Thereafter, the recombinant variants were incubated with the beads and subjected to a series of washing steps. To release FV from the beads and to activate FV, the beads were incubated with thrombin. Because the epitope of MK30 is in the B-domain of FV, the activated form of FV is released from the beads, whereas the B-domain remains associated with the MK-30 coated beads. Our earlier results have shown that the affinity-purified FVa yielded similar APC degradation curves and kinetic constants as the unpurified FV in the condition medium (33Norstrom E.A. Tran S. Steen M. Dahlback B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31486-31494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 41Sun Y.H. Tran S. Norstrom E.A. Dahlback B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47528-47535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For the Western blotting experiments, the affinity-purified FVa was used. Phospholipid Vesicle Preparation—The phospholipid stocks were dissolved in 10/90 (v/v) methanol/chloroform solution, and the concentrations were determined by phosphate analysis (42Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Mixtures of the lipids (weight-based) were prepared in 10/90 methanol/chloroform and kept at –20 °C. Aliquots were drawn from the stocks, dried under N2, and then resuspended in Hepes buffer at room temperature. Phospholipids for the PTase assay were sonicated in an XL 2020 sonicator (Misonix, Farmingdale, NY) at amplitude 3 for 10 min. Fresh phospholipid vesicles were prepared every day. For the FVa inactivation assay, extruded phospholipid vesicles were used. The extrusion was performed using LiposoFast basic extruder (Armatis, Germany), as described (43MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B.P. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). The phospholipid mixtures dissolved in buffer were subjected to freeze-thaw cycles and subsequently extruded through a membrane with 100 nm pore size 19 times. The extruded phospholipids were used for 2 days. If not otherwise mentioned, the natural phospholipids were used. PTase-based FVa Assay—To determine the procoagulant activity of FVa, a PTase-based assay was used, as described (40Norstrom E. Thorelli E. Dahlback B. Blood. 2002; 100: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, a mixture of 0.5 μm PT and 50 μm phospholipid vesicles (10:90 PS/PC) was prepared in HNO buffer (25 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.7, containing 0.5 mg/ml ovalbumin). FV was activated by thrombin (final concentration 0.5 units/ml) at 37 °C for 10 min. The FVa concentration was 0.8 nm in the FVa inactivation, and it was diluted in total 1:125 when present in the PTase assay, yielding a final concentration of 64 pm. FXa (10 μl, yielding final concentrations of 5 nm for FVa:WT and FVa:R506Q/R679Q and 0.5 nm for FVa:R306Q/R679Q) and the FVa samples (10 μl of the 1:5 diluted aliquot; see below) were added to the PTase mix (230 μl), and after 2 min, the PT activation was stopped by 40-fold dilution in ice-cold EDTA buffer. The low FXa concentration (0.5 nm) used with FVa:R306Q/R679Q was chosen because the Arg506-cleaved FVa had much lower remaining activity at this FXa concentration than at the standard 5 nm concentration that was used for the FVa:WT and FVa:R506Q/R679Q variants. The EDTA buffer contained 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 1% polyethylene glycol 6000, pH 7.9. The amount of thrombin formed was measured kinetically with the chromogenic substrate, S2238. FVa Inactivation Assay—To study the time course of FVa inactivation, recombinant FV variants FV:R506Q/R679Q and FV:R306Q/R679Q as well as wild-type FV were used in a FVa inactivation assay. The FV variants (final concentrations 0.8 nm) were incubated with thrombin (0.5 units/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C to activate FV, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of hirudin (final concentration 5 units/ml). Thereafter, phospholipids (final concentration in most experiments was 25 μm, but in control experiments 100 and 200 μm were used), protein S (final concentration 100 nm) and PT (final concentration 1.4 μm) were added. Aliquots were drawn from the mixtures and diluted 1:5 in HNBSACa buffer (25 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.7, with 5 mg/ml BSA and 5 mm CaCl2). The inactivation was started with the addition of APC (concentration indicated for each individual experiment). At different time points, subsamples were drawn from the inactivation mixture and diluted 1:5 in ice-cold HNBCACa buffer and then kept on ice until measured. The remaining FVa activity of each subsample was measured using the PTase assay, as described above. PT and protein S titrations were also performed in the FVa inactivation assay to determine the dose response of PT and protein S. In these experiments, the FV:R306Q/R679Q was activated as described above, and phospholipids (10:20:70 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-PS/PE/PC synthetic, final concentration 25 μm) were added. Aliquots of the FVa were added to parallel tubes, and different concentrations of PT and or protein S were added. The APC-mediated inactivation was started by the addition of APC (final concentration 0.05 nm), and the reaction was stopped after 10 min by 1:5 dilution in ice-cold HNBSCa. The remaining FVa activity was measured using the PTase assay as described above. Western Blot Analysis of Recombinant FV Variants—Affinity-purified FVa variants (final concentration 0.8 nm) in HNBSACa buffer were incubated with APC (concentration indicated for each individual experiment) with or without 1.4 μm PT in the presence of 25 μm phospholipids (10:20:70, PS/PE/PC). The assay was performed both in the presence and absence of 100 nm protein S. At different time points, the inactivation was stopped by the addition of denaturing sample preparation solution. The samples were run under reducing conditions in a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. To detect the FVa fragments, a monoclonal antibody against the heavy chain of FVa, AH5146, was used together with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and the Supersignal West Dura extended duration chemiluminescence substrate. The chemiluminescence was traced with a Fuji LAS 3000IR CDD camera, and the signals were quantified with the Image-Gauge program. Equations Used for Curve Fitting—To calculate pseudo-first order rate constants for APC-mediated cleavages at Arg306 and Arg506, inactivation of FVa R506Q/R679Q and FVa:R306Q/R679Q, respectively, was followed in time. The inactivation curves were fitted to an equation, as reported (23Rosing J. Hoekema L. Nicolaes G.A. Thomassen M.C. Hemker H.C. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Tans G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27852-27858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The equation was modified because only one cleavage occurs in our FV variants at the APC concentrations used. For calculation of the rate constant of the Arg506 cleavage, the time curves obtained for FVa:R306Q/R679Q were fitted to Equation 1, Vat=Va0·e-(k506)·t+B·Va0·(1-e(-(k506)·t))(Eq. 1) in which Vat represents the cofactor activity determined at time t, Va0 is the cofactor activity determined before APC is added, B is the remaining procoagulant cofactor activity of FVa cleaved at position 506, and k506 is the rate constant of cleavage at position 506. For calculation of the rate constant of the Arg306 cleavage, the Equation 2 was used, Vat=Va0·e-(k306)·t+C·Va0·(1-e(-(k306)·t))(Eq. 2) to fit the time curve obtained with FVa R506Q/R679Q. C is the remaining procoagulant cofactor activity of FVa cleaved at position 306, and k306 is the rate constant of cleavage at position 306. It is only valid to use the equation when the inactivation rates are independent of the FVa concentration (percentage of FVa inactivation versus time), and the inactivation rates are linear for the concentration of APC. Control experiments were performed, and the inactivation curves were found to fulfill these criteria. Purification of PT—It was crucially important that the PT preparation be completely free of contaminating FXa, since traces of FXa would be sufficient to bind to FVa and cleave PT. We found this to be a problem with the PT batches that were tried. Therefore, the human PT was subjected to an additional purification step to remove contaminating traces of FXa. Soybean trypsin inhibitor (20 mg) was coupled to a 1-ml NHS-activated Hitrap column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with HN buffer (25 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.7) and 1 ml of 50 μm human PT with 10 μm PPACK was added to the column and allowed to incubate for 2 h in 37 °C. Thereafter, the PT was eluted in 1-ml fractions with HN buffer. The buffer was changed to TBS using a PD-10 column. The concentration of PT was determined with S2238 after activation of PT with the snake venom Ecarin (0.025 units/ml Ecarin for 15 min at 37 °C). To ensure that the PT preparation was free of any traces of FXa, the PT was incubated with factor Va and phospholipid (like in a PTase assay), and thrombin generation was tested as in a PTase assay. Cleavage of Prothrombin by Thrombin—Human PT (2.0 mg/ml) was incubated with 10 units/ml thrombin for 2 h at 37 °C to generate fragment 1 and prethrombin 1, and the fragmentation was followed by SDS-PAGE. The thrombin was inhibited by Hirudin (30 units/ml). PT Inhibits the APC-mediated Inactivation of FVa—To elucidate the effect of PT on the APC-mediated inactivation of FVa, the inactivation of FVa:WT was followed over time in a PTase-based assay (Fig. 1A). The inactivation was performed in the presence of protein S. Under these conditions, both cleavages at Arg306 and Arg506 occur early, since protein S enhances the rate of the slow Arg306 cleavage. In the absence of PT, the inactivation of FVa:WT was rapid, with a loss of 60% activity within the first few minutes. This was followed by a slower phase of inactivation. After 20 min, only 20% of the FVa activity remained. In the presence of PT, the inactivation of FVa was inhibited. To correlate the loss of FVa activity with the appearance of proteolytic products, aliquots from the inactivation assay were withdrawn and subjected to Western blotting (Fig. 1, B and C). The monoclonal antibody recognized an epitope located between Arg306 and Arg506. Incubation of FVa:WT with APC resulted in the appearance of two fragments. Initially, after only 30 s, a fragment of about 75 kDa appeared, corresponding to the 1–506 fragment. This coincided with the rapid loss of intensity of the heavy chain band. Within the first minute, a fragment of about 30 kDa appeared, corresponding to fragment 307–506. At the same time, the intensity of the 1–506 fragment declined. Thus, in the presence of protein S, the cleavage at Arg506 occurs first, followed shortly after by cleavage at Arg306, resulting in the 307–506 fragment. In the presence of PT, the appearances of both fragments were delayed, but the presence of PT did not change the order of cleavage, indicating that both the Arg306 and the Arg506 cleavage were inhibited by PT. Effect of PT on the APC-mediated Cleavage at Arg306—The FVa:R506Q/R679Q variant was used to investigate the effect of PT on the APC-mediated cleavage at Arg306. When no protein S was added, a high APC concentration (3.3 nm) was used, and the FVa-inactivation reaction was followed for 20 min. The rate of inactivation of FVa:R506Q/R679Q was low, consistent with a slow cleavage at Arg306 in the absence of protein S (Fig. 2A). In the presence of PT, the inactivation of FVa:R506Q/R679Q was inhibited. Based on the FVa inactivation time curves, apparent second order rate constants were calculated (Table 1). The addition of PT resulted in an approximately 3.5-fold decrease in inactivation rate (k306 = 1.3 × 106 m–1 s–1 in the absence of PT versus k306 = 3.9 × 105 m–1 s–1 in the presence of PT). When the FVa inactivation was performed in the presence of protein S, the APC concentration was lowered to 0.2 nm, since protein S enhances the rate of Arg306 cleavage. The rate of inactivation of FVa:R506Q/R679Q was greatly stimulated by the addition of protein S when no PT was present (k306"
https://openalex.org/W2056451196,"During the early stage of protein import into chloroplasts, precursor proteins synthesized in the cytosol irreversibly bind to chloroplasts to form the early translocation intermediate under stringent energy conditions. Many efforts have been made to identify the components involved in protein import by analyzing the early intermediate. However, the state of the precursor within the intermediate has not been well investigated so far. In this study, an attempt was made to evaluate the extent of translocation of the precursor by determining the state of the precursor in the early intermediate under various conditions and analyzing the fragments generated by limited proteolysis of the precursors docked to chloroplasts. Our results indicate that three different sets of early intermediate are formed based on temperature and the hydrolysis of GTP/ATP. These have been identified based on the size of proteolytic fragments of the precursor as “energy-dependent association,” “insertion,” and “penetration” states. These findings suggest two individual ATP-hydrolyzing steps during the early stage of protein import, one of which is temperature-sensitive. Our results also demonstrate that translocation through the outer envelope membrane is mainly dependent on internal ATP.

Our results also demonstrate that translocation through the outer envelope membrane is mainly dependent on internal ATP. Most chloroplastic proteins are encoded in the nuclear genome. The majority of these proteins are synthesized as precursors with chloroplastic targeting signals, the transit peptides, at their amino termini and are considered to translocate through the general import pathway. The general import pathway is composed of translocons at the outer and the inner envelope membranes, the Toc and the Tic complexes, respectively (for review, see Ref. 1Bédard J. Jarvis P.P. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 2287-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Many components of the Toc/Tic complexes have been reported and are being characterized biochemically and genetically by various research groups. In vitro studies indicate that the process of protein import into chloroplasts consists of two energy-dependent stages, “docking” and “translocation.” In “docking,” the precursor proteins irreversibly bind to chloroplasts to form the early translocation intermediates. A low level of ATP (less than 0.1 mm) is required for this step (2Olsen L.J. Theg S.M. Selman B.R. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6724-6729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A low level of GTP also supports this step and enhances ATP-dependent docking, but GTP is unable to substitute for ATP (2Olsen L.J. Theg S.M. Selman B.R. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6724-6729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Olsen L.J. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 433-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Young M.E. Keegstra K.

In “translocation,” which requires a higher level of ATP (more than 1 mm) at higher temperatures, precursors translocate across both the envelope membranes, and their transit peptides are cleaved by the stromal processing peptidase (7Chua N-H.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4401-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The requirement of GTP for docking is accounted for by the two GTPases in the Toc complex, Toc159 and Toc34, regarded as the receptors for incoming precursors (9Kessler F. Schnell D.J. Traffic. 2006; 7: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the requirement of a low level of ATP for docking is far from understood. It is possible that the intermembrane space molecular chaperone, HSP70-IAP (10Schnell D.J. Kessler F. Blobel G. Science. 1994; 266: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), may be contributing to the ATP requirement cooperating with Toc12, which contains the J-domain (11Becker T. Hritz J.

Many of the Toc and Tic components have been isolated and identified from the early intermediates by incubating precursors with isolated chloroplasts at different temperatures in the presence of GTP and/or ATP (10Schnell D.J.

Akita M. Davila-Aponte J. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 935-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Previous reports suggest that precursors reach deeper in the early intermediate stage at 25 °C rather than at 4 °C in the presence of 0.1 mm ATP (17Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1991; 1: 149-158Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar); however, direct comparisons of the early intermediates formed under different conditions have never been attempted. Hence, the following questions have remained unsolved. How far does the precursor reach in the intermediate formed under different conditions? Are similar intermediates formed in the presence of GTP and ATP? Does temperature affect the intermediate formation? In this report, the authors have attempted to evaluate the early intermediates by assessing the location of precursors in the intermediates formed under different conditions. To conduct the docking reaction under stringent conditions, purified recombinant precursors, free from any cytosolic factors, were used. These precursors were applied to the in vitro protein import assay system to estimate the extent of translocation in the early intermediate that was formed under various conditions, and the outer surface of the chloroplast was subjected to limited proteolysis. Analysis of the undigested fragments of the precursor protected by the outer envelope membrane showed the presence of different sets of intermediates based on their requirement for GTP/ATP and temperature. Each set consisted of three different types of intermediates with precursors in different stages of translocation, indicated by the sizes of the proteolytic fragments: “energy-dependent association,” “insertion,” and “penetration” states. The finding that transition from one to the forward step required ATP hydrolysis indicates that two individual ATP hydrolysis steps are present during the early stage of protein import. Growth of Plants and Isolation of Chloroplasts—Pea (Pisum sativum) plants were grown for 8–10 days in a growth chamber under a cycle of 14 h of light at 24 °C and 10 h of dark at 20 °C. Intact chloroplasts were isolated as described earlier (18Bruce B.D. Perry S. Froehlich J. Keegstra K. Plant Molecular Biology Manual. J1. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, MA1994: 1-15Google Scholar). After isolation, chloroplasts were suspended in import buffer (I-buffer 3The abbreviations used are: I-bufferimport bufferS-buffersolubilization bufferTricineN-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycineAPalkaline phosphataseHAhuman influenza hemagglutininprSSprecursor to the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenasebiotin-maleimideN-biotinoyl-N′-(6-maleimidohexanoyl)hydrazidemSSmature form of the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenaseDHAPdihydroxyacetone phosphateGTPγSguanosine-5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)ATPγSadenosine-5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). : 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 330 mm sorbitol) at a concentration of 2 mg of chlorophyll/ml. import buffer solubilization buffer N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine alkaline phosphatase human influenza hemagglutinin precursor to the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase N-biotinoyl-N′-(6-maleimidohexanoyl)hydrazide mature form of the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase dihydroxyacetone phosphate guanosine-5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) adenosine-5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). Preparation of Recombinant Precursor Protein—Expression plasmid harboring mutant types of precursors (Fig. 1A) was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis from pET8c-pS (19Schnell D.J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying the plasmid was incubated at 37 °C until midlogarithmic phase when 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to overexpress the precursor and then incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Recombinant precursor protein was recovered in inclusion bodies. After several washes with H2O, inclusion bodies were solubilized in denaturing/wash buffer (8 m urea, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole). The precursor proteins were further purified from inclusion bodies on Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Solubilized inclusion bodies and resins pre-equilibrated with denaturing/wash buffer were mixed in a microtube and incubated for 20 min at room temperature with frequent mixing. After recovery of resins by centrifugation (700 × g, 5 min at room temperature), resins were washed with denaturing/wash buffer twice. Precursor protein bound to resins was eluted with elution buffer (7.2 m urea, 45 mm HEPEPS-KOH, pH 7.0, 270 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole). Precursor protein was then precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid to remove imidazole, followed by washes with acetone and ethanol. After drying the precipitate, precursor protein was dissolved in solubilization buffer (S-buffer: 8 m urea-25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5–50 mm KCl-2 mm MgCl2). Protein was determined by the method of Lowry (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the precursor was suspended in S-buffer at a concentration of 0.1 mm. Biotinylation of the Precursor—To modify precursor proteins with biotin, 2.5 mm biotin-maleimide (Sigma) was added to 100 μm precursor in S-buffer, and the mixture was incubated for 1–4 h on ice in the dark. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 5 mm dithiothreitol, and the mixture was further incubated for 15 min on ice. Excess biotin-maleimide was removed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and the final pellet was solubilized in S-buffer and stored in the freezer until use. The Docking and the Import Reaction—Isolated chloroplasts were incubated on ice in the dark for 1 h and then diluted twice with 5 μm nigericin in I-buffer and incubated for 10 min at 25 °C in the dark. Chloroplasts were then diluted 5-fold with I-buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm GTP, and/or 0.1 mm ATP incubated at 4 or 25 °C for 5 min in the dark. The docking reaction was initiated by the addition of 200 nm precursor in S-buffer and incubated at either 4 or 25 °C for 5 min in the dark. Chloroplasts were recovered by centrifuging (1,500 × g) the reaction mixture on a 40% cushion of Percoll in I-buffer at 4 °C for 5 min and washed once with I-buffer. Protease Treatment—After recovery of chloroplasts, they were treated with thermolysin or trypsin. Recovered chloroplasts were suspended (1 mg of chlorophyll/ml) in I-buffer with 0.8 mg of thermolysin/mg of chlorophyll in 4 mm CaCl2 or 0.1 mg of trypsin/mg of chlorophyll in 1 mm CaCl2 and incubated for 30 min on ice in the dark, unless stated otherwise. The mixture was diluted 4-fold in I-buffer in the presence of protease inhibitors to quench proteolysis and incubated for a further 10 min on ice. The following protease inhibitors were used for quenching: 12 mm EDTA for the thermolysin treatment; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05 mg/ml Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 2 μg/ml aprotinin and 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor for the trypsin treatment. After quenching, intact chloroplasts were reisolated through a 40% Percoll cushion containing the same protease inhibitors and washed with I-buffer containing inhibitors. The resulting pellet was suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer of Laemmli's system (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar) containing 1 mm EDTA for thermolysin-treated samples or 1 mm PMSF for trypsin-treated samples and immediately boiled for 10 min. Electrophoresis, Immunoblotting, and Quantification—Proteolytic fragments were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in the Tris-Tricine-buffered system (22Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10457) Google Scholar) on 16.5% polyacrylamide gel, and other samples were analyzed by Laemmli's SDS-PAGE (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar) on 7.5–15% polyacrylamide gradient gels. Blotting was performed as described earlier (14Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). After blotting, polypeptides on the blots were decorated with the antibodies against the respective polypeptides, followed by the alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated secondary antibodies. Biotinylated polypeptides on the blots were decorated with AP-conjugated streptavidin. Color development by AP was carried out by soaking the blots in 33 ng/ml nitro blue tetrazolium and 8.3 ng/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate in AP-buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 9.5) until optimal color development occurred. The blots were washed in H2O and dried for storage. Images of the blots were scanned, and then the docked precursor and the proteolytic fragments were quantified from the digitized images by UN-SCAN-IT version 5.1 (Silk Scientific, Orem, UT). Sources of Antibodies—Except for the monoclonal antibody against HA tag produced in mouse clone HA-7 (Sigma), all antibodies used in this study were rabbit polyclonal and were a gift from Dr. Ken Keegstra. For the detection of proteolytic fragments, AP-conjugated streptavidin was used (Invitrogen). Experimental Design—A precursor to the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (prSS) in modified form, overexpressed in E. coli cells, was used as the import substrate (Fig. 1A). Recombinant precursor was recovered in inclusion bodies and affinity-purified under denaturing conditions. Mutant precursors, designated as prSSCn(X)HAHAH (where n is the number of cysteine residues, and X is the position of cysteine residue), had two features; first, the double-HA tag (HAHA) and a hexahistidinyl tag (H) were fused to the carboxyl terminus of prSS; second, prSS with tags was designed to carry zero or one cysteine residue at various positions. The wild-type prSS has three cysteine residues at positions –1, +41, and +112 (Fig. 1A). The carboxyl-terminal end of the transit peptide is set at –1, whereas the amino-terminal end of the mature part of the precursor is set at +1. Both modifications were valuable tools for the detection of the precursor. When the cysteine residue was modified with the SH-reactive biotin reagent, biotin-maleimide, the precursor was detected through biotin with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Fig. 1B, lane 1 in St) as well as through epitope tags at the carboxyl-terminal end (Fig. 1B, lane 1 in αHA). In this study, we have used prSSC1(–52)HAHAH, carrying a single cysteine residue at position –52. Development of the Assay System—Translocation of the amino-terminal end of the precursor in the early intermediate inside chloroplasts was evaluated by analyzing the proteolytic fragments generated by limited proteolysis of the precursor docked to chloroplasts. To this end, conditions for limited proteolysis were first established. The docking reaction was performed by incubating biotinylated prSSC1(–52)HAHAH with chloroplasts in the presence of 0.1 mm GTP and 0.1 mm ATP at 4 °C for 5 min. To avoid the light-mediated precursor docking, chloroplasts were incubated with nigericin to inhibit ATP synthesis generated by F0F1-ATPase embedded in the thylakoid membrane by uncoupling electron transport through the thylakoid membrane (23Theg S.M. Bauerle C. Olsen L.J. Selman B.R. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6730-6736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All further experiments were performed with chloroplasts treated with nigericin. Approximately 5–8% of the precursor used in the docking reaction was bound to chloroplasts (Fig. 1B, lane 2 in αHA and lane 12 in St). Biotinylation did not affect the interaction between the precursor and chloroplasts 4H. Inoue and M. Akita, unpublished observations. or protein import 4H. Inoue and M. Akita, unpublished observations. (24Froehlich J.E. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8077-8082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Proteolytic fragments were analyzed by Tris-Tricine-buffered PAGE, since this electrophoresis system efficiently separates small polypeptides (22Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10457) Google Scholar). However, in this PAGE system, the biotinylated precursor was hindered by one of the two endogenous streptavidin-reactive proteins in chloroplasts (Fig. 1B , lane 2 in St). The precursor was completely separated from the endogenous protein in the Laemmli Tris-glycine-buffered PAGE system (Fig. 1B, lane 12 in St). After chloroplasts were recovered, they were treated with 0.8 mg of thermolysin/mg of chlorophyll equivalent of chloroplasts at 4 °C. Thermolysin is known to digest the outer surface of chloroplasts (25Cline K. Werner-Washburne M. Andrews J. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 675-678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 5 min of proteolysis, prSS disappeared completely (Fig. 1B, lane 3 in αHA) and smaller fragments (less than 25 kDa) started to appear (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 in St). These fragments were detected only by streptavidin (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–8 in St), and no fragment was detected by the anti-HA antibody,4 indicating that these fragments were derived from the amino-terminal part of the precursor. As the proteolytic period was increased, these fragments were degraded further, and four major fragments (open circles), with molecular masses between 7.8 and 12 kDa, were observed after 30 min of proteolysis (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–5 in St). When the concentration of thermolysin was increased 2-fold, these four fragments did not degrade further (Fig. 1B, lanes 6–8 in St). These fragments were not observed when the precursor was treated with thermolysin in the absence of chloroplasts, demonstrating that they were not representing the protease-resistant domains of the precursor (Fig. 1C, lanes 5–7 in St). Accessibility of thermolysin was evaluated by monitoring two outer envelope membrane proteins at the same time. The outer envelope membrane protein, Toc34, a large amino-terminal domain facing the cytosol, was completely degraded after 5 min of thermolysin treatment (Fig. 1B, lane 3 in αToc34). On the other hand, the integral outer envelope membrane protein, Toc75, remained intact even after 30 min of proteolysis (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 8 in αToc75). Two proteolytic fragments (open squares) were generated from the precursor docked to chloroplasts treated with 0.1 mg of trypsin/mg of chlorophyll equivalent of chloroplasts at 4 °C for 30 min (Fig. 1C, lane 4). The molecular masses of trypsin-generated proteolytic fragments were observed in the same molecular mass range as those produced by thermolysin (Fig. 1C, lane 3). With the trypsin treatment, two Toc components, Toc34 and Toc75, displayed the same behavior as with the thermolysin treatment (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4). The similar sizes of proteolytic fragments, generated from the biotinylated precursor at –52, were also observed when the biotinylated precursor carrying the cysteine residue at position –33 or +4 was treated by these proteases.4 This observation, along with the size of the proteolytic fragments, indicates that the entire part of the transit peptide completely crossed the outer envelope membrane under this docking condition. Proteolytic Fragments Were Produced by the Import-competent Precursor Associating with the Membranes—Since proteolytic fragments were observed only when the precursor was incubated with chloroplasts, we further verified the docking specificity of the precursor. The precursor docked to chloroplasts in the presence of 0.1 mm GTP and 0.1 mm ATP at 4 °C was chased with 2.5 mm ATP at 25 °C. Following the chase, the docked precursor (Fig. 2A, lane 3 in αHA) was decreased significantly, and the protease-resistant mature form of the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (mSS) was observed (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 7 in αHA). Since the transit peptide was cleaved after translocation, mSS, processed from the precursor biotinylated at position –52, was not detected by streptavidin (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 7 in St). Proteolytic fragments also disappeared following the chase (Fig. 2A, lane 7 in St). From these results, it can be concluded that the precursor was bound specifically to chloroplasts and that the chloroplast-docked precursor maintains import competence. Because proteolytic fragments were recovered with chloroplasts, they were expected to be localized in the membranes. Thus, their location was determined. After proteolysis, chloroplasts were lysed hypertonically and fractionated into soluble and insoluble fractions (Fig. 2B). The docked precursor (Fig. 2B, lane 3 in αHA) and proteolytic fragments (open circles and squares in Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 7 in St) were observed only in the insoluble fraction, demonstrating that proteolytic fragments were recovered in the membranes. These results demonstrate that the experimental procedure in the present study was effective in analyzing the precursor in the early intermediates. Hence, the conditions for proteolysis were set at 0.8 mg of thermolysin/mg of chlorophyll equivalent of chloroplasts for 30 min at 4 °C. Limited Proteolysis of the Early Translocation Intermediate Formed under Different Energy Conditions—Once the proteolytic conditions were set, the early translocation intermediates formed under different conditions were analyzed. Biotinylated prSSC1(–52)HAHAH was incubated with chloroplasts at either 4 °C (Fig. 3, A, B, E, and F) or 25 °C (Fig. 3, C, D, G, and H) in the presence of different concentrations of GTP and/or ATP to initiate the docking reaction. Apyrase was added to the docking reaction to deplete the external NTP as control (Fig. 3, lane 2). The precursor docked to chloroplasts before the protease treatment and proteolytic fragments produced by the thermolysin treatment detected on the blots are shown in Fig. 3, A and C, and Fig. 3, E and G, respectively. In addition, the amount of the docked precursor (Fig. 3, B and D) and the proteolytic fragments (Fig. 3, F and H) were quantified. The ratio of the quantified value to the value of precursor added to the docking reaction (Fig. 3, A, C, E, and G, lane 1) is shown in these panels. With respect to precursor docking, the amount of the docked precursor was increased more than three times from the basal level when the docking reaction was conducted in the presence of 0.1 mm ATP at 4 °C, regardless of the presence of GTP (Fig. 3, A and B, compare lane 3 with lanes 5, 7, and 8). When ATP concentration was increased from 0.1 to 2.5 mm at 4 °C, the amount of the docked precursor was increased 1.4-fold (Fig. 3, A and B, compare lane 8 with lane 9). Furthermore, when the docking reaction was conducted at 25 °C, more precursor was docked to chloroplasts than at 4 °C under the same NTP conditions (compare Fig. 3, A and B, with Fig. 3, C and D). In the presence of 2.5 mm ATP incubated at 25 °C (Fig. 3C, lane 9), both the chloroplast-docked precursor and imported mSS were observed. When the docking reaction was conducted in the presence of GTP alone, the amount of the docked precursor was almost the same as the basal level (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 4 and 6; Fig. 3, C and D, lane 4), except in the presence of 2.5 mm GTP incubated at 25 °C. Under this condition, the amount of the docked precursor was approximately twice the basal level (Fig. 3, C and D, lane 6). After chloroplasts were treated with thermolysin, four proteolytic fragments (open circles) were produced from the precursor docked to chloroplasts in the presence of ATP, irrespective of the incubation temperature (Fig. 3, E and G). Furthermore, when the precursor was docked to chloroplasts in the presence of ATP, three larger proteolytic fragments, with molecular masses between 13.5 and 15 kDa (filled circles), were generated (Fig. 3G, lanes 5 and 7-9), which were also generated from the precursor docked in the presence of 2.5 mm GTP alone at 25 °C but to a lesser extent (Fig. 3G, lane 6). A similar molecular mass range to those of the larger fragments was also produced by trypsin treatment.4 In addition, the larger fragments, as well as the smaller fragments (Fig. 2B) were localized in the membranes.4 We quantified the four smaller fragments (open circles in Fig. 3, E and G) and the three larger fragments (filled circles in Fig. 3, E and G), and the results are shown in Fig. 3, F and H (the amounts of the smaller, and the larger fragments were represented by the open bars and the filled bars, respectively). From this analysis, we concluded that the differences in the proteolytic fragments derived from the precursor are dependent on the degree of translocation through the outer envelope membrane during the docking step (Fig. 3, compare E with G). For instance, when the docking reaction was conducted at 4 °C, approximately half of the docked precursor was completely degradable by thermolysin, whereas the remaining portion of the precursor was partially sensitive, yielding the smaller proteolytic fragments (open circles in Fig. 3E). Conversely, when the docking reaction was conducted at 25 °C, a much lesser amount of the docked precursor was completely degradable by thermolysin. Under these conditions, the majority of the precursor was partially sensitive to protease treatment and degraded to either the smaller or the larger fragments (Fig. 3G, open and filled circles, respectively), indicating that the precursor was sufficiently translocated through the outer envelope membrane. These observations suggest that early intermediates formed under different energy conditions consisted of different combinations of the intermediates. In addition, the observation of the completely degradable precursor docked in the presence of ATP demonstrates the existence of the early intermediate within which the precursor is tightly associated with the outer surface of chloroplasts, although not inserted into the outer envelope membrane, in an energy-dependent manner. Significance of Internal ATP in the Docking—As seen earlier, different sets of proteolytic fragments were generated from the precursor docked under different temperatures (Fig. 3, E and G). In a previous report, internal ATP was shown to be sufficient for docking (3Olsen L.J. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 433-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether a different docking state of the precursor is dependent on internal ATP, the docking reaction was performed with chloroplasts treated in two different ways prior to incubation with the precursor and NTP. (i) Chloroplasts were treated with glycerate to deplete internal ATP (Fig. 4). Nigericin inhibits ATP synthesis in chloroplasts but does not deplete endogenous ATP level, which is lowered by the action of glycerate kinase upon exogenously added glycerate (2Olsen L.J. Theg S.M. Selman B.R. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6724-6729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) Chloroplasts were treated with apyrase to deplete external ATP under the dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) system to generate ATP internally (Fig. 5). The DHAP system consisted of DHAP, oxaloacetate, and Pi (2Olsen L.J. Theg S.M. Selman B.R. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6724-6729Abstract Ful"

HCV is an important public health problem because it is the leading cause of acute and chronic liver disease in humans, including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (1Chen S.L. Morgan T.R. Int. J. Med. Sci. 2006; 3: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 2Penin F. Dubuisson J. Rey F.A. Moradpour D. Pawlotsky J.M.

Currently, there are no vaccines to prevent HCV infection and the available therapeutic agents have very limited efficacy against the virus (4Qureshi S.A. Med. Res. Rev. 2007; 27: 353-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The HCV genome consists of one translational open reading frame encoding a polyprotein precursor of ∼3010 amino acids in length, including structural and non-structural proteins, which is cleaved by host and viral proteases (Fig. 1A). The HCV genome is widely heterogeneous; replication errors cause a high rate of mutations (5Pozzetto B. Bourlet T. Grattard F. Bonnevial L. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1996; 11: 2-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). HCV entry into the host cell is achieved by fusion of viral and cellular membranes, and the morphogenesis and virion budding has been suggested to take place in the endoplasmic reticulum (6Vauloup-Fellous C. Pene V. Garaud-Aunis J. Harper F. Bardin S. Suire Y. Pichard E. Schmitt A. Sogni P. Pierron G. Briand P. Rosenberg A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27679-27692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, the viral region implicated in fusion to and/or budding from the cells must interact with the membrane and should be a conserved sequence. The variability of the HCV proteins gives the virus the ability to escape the host immune surveillance system and notably hampers the development of an efficient vaccine. Thus, finding inhibitors of protein-membrane and protein-protein interactions involved in virus fusion and/or budding could be an alternative and valuable strategy against HCV infection because they could be potential therapeutic agents. hepatitis C virus bovine brain l-α-phosphatidylserine 5-carboxyfluorescein cholesterol ergosta-5,7,9(11),22-tetraen-3β-ol 4-(2-(6-(dioctylamino)-2-naphthalenyl)-(ethenyl)-1-(3-sulfopropyl)-pyridinium inner salt 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)];DPH,1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene;EPA,eggl-α-phosphatidicacid egg l-α-phosphatidylcholine endoplasmic reticulum fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran with an average molecular weight of 10,000 largeunilamellarvesicles;MLV,multilamellarvesicles;NBD-PE,N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)-1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine Lissamine rhodamine B 1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine doxylstearic acid 3-(4-(6-phenyl)-1,3,5-hexatrienyl)-phenylpropionic acid small-angle X-ray diffraction sphingomyelin temperature of the gel to liquid crystalline phase transition transmembrane domain 1-(4-trimethylammoniumphenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene fluorescein phosphatidylethanolamine thioflavin T magic angle spinning 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. Protein p7 gene is located between the structural and the non-structural regions of the HCV polyprotein precursor, specifically between the E2 and NS2 genes. Cleavage of p7 is mediated by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) signal peptidases of the host cell (7Mizushima H. Hijikata M. Asabe S. Hirota M. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6215-6222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lin C. Lindenbach B.D. Pragai B.M. McCourt D.W. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5063-5073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein p7 is classified neither as a structural protein nor as non-structural (9Sakai A. Claire M.S. Faulk K. Govindarajan S. Emerson S.U. Purcell R.H. Bukh J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11646-11651Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and locates in the cell ER. The role of p7 in the virus life cycle has been elusive. It has been shown that p7 is not critical for RNA replication (10Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar), although homologous proteins from other members of the Flaviviridae family are critical for cell culture infectivity (11Tokita H. Kaufmann G.R. Matsubayashi M. Okuda I. Tanaka T. Harada H. Mukaide M. Suzuki K. Cooper D.A. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 3450-3452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent report, however, demonstrated that p7 is essential for efficient assembly and release of infectious virions indicating that p7 is primarily involved in the late phase of the virus replication cycle (12Steinmann E. Penin F. Kallis S. Patel A.H. Bartenschlager R. Pietschmann T. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e103Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). At a molecular level, p7 is a small transmembrane protein of 63 amino acids with two transmembrane helical domains, TM1 and TM2, connected by a loop. Whereas the loop is oriented toward the cytoplasm, the amino- and carboxyl-terminal tails are oriented toward the ER lumen (13Patargias G. Zitzmann N. Dwek R. Fischer W.B. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 14Carrere-Kremer S. Montpellier-Pala C. Cocquerel L. Wychowski C. Penin F. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3720-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Mutations in the loop region abrogate the channel activity of p7, which has been described to be a viroporin-like protein (12Steinmann E. Penin F. Kallis S. Patel A.H. Bartenschlager R. Pietschmann T. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e103Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 15Gonzalez M.E. Carrasco L.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). These functional groups of proteins form ion channels that might be important for virus assembly and/or release; p7 is capable of forming cation-selective ion channels in artificial lipid membranes at physiological pH. Akin to other viral proteins such as M2, NB, and Vpu, secondary structure predictions suggest that p7 may form a hexameric bundle of helical dimers with a pore diameter of 3–5 nm (13Patargias G. Zitzmann N. Dwek R. Fischer W.B. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16Griffin S.D. Beales L.P. Clarke D.S. Worsfold O. Evans S.D. Jaeger J. Harris M.P. Rowlands D.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). One possible role for this protein could be the transport of ions from the ER to the cytoplasm of HCV-infected host cells. Amantadine, hexamethylene amiloride, and long alkyl-chain amino sugar derivatives are ion channel inhibitors that block ion transport mediated by p7 in lipid membranes (16Griffin S.D. Beales L.P.

We have recently identified the membrane-active regions of the HIV gp41, SARS-CoV spike, and HCV E1 and E2 glycoproteins by observing the effect of glycoprotein-derived peptide libraries on model membrane integrity (19Guillen J. Perez-Berna A.J. Moreno M.R. Villalain J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 1743-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Perez-Berna A.J. Moreno M.R. Guillen J. Bernabeu A. Villalain J.

Acta. 2006; 1758: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These results allowed us to propose the location of different segments in these proteins that are implicated in protein-lipid and protein-protein interactions. These studies have helped us to understand the mechanisms underlying the interaction between viral proteins and membranes. Using a similar approach, we have carried the analysis of the membrane-active regions of p7 by investigating the effect of a p7-derived peptide library from the HCV strain HCV_1B4J, on the integrity of different membrane model systems. Here, we report the identification of a membranotropic region in p7 coincidental with the loop domain of the protein, which exhibits membrane-interacting properties akin to those found for the loop domain of HIV gp41 (21Moreno M.R. Giudici M. Villalain J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Pascual R. Moreno M.R. Villalain J. J.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3196-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have focused on the possible functional roles of the p7 loop domain by an in-depth study of a peptide patterned after this domain, peptide p7L. We have studied the binding and interaction of p7L with the lipid bilayer, as well as the structural changes induced in both the peptide and phospholipid molecules upon membrane binding. We show that p7L strongly partitions into phospholipid membranes, interacts with negatively charged phospholipids, locates in a shallow position in the membrane, and oligomerizes in the membrane. Materials and Reagents—Three sets of 11 peptides derived from HCV_1B4J protein p7 (strictly speaking, p7 spans from residue 746 to residue 809 of the HCV polyprotein precursor) were obtained through the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD). The peptide p7L corresponding to the sequence 771FFCAAWYIKGRLAPGAAY788 (with NH2-terminal acetylation and COOH-terminal amidation) was obtained from Genemed Synthesis, San Francisco, CA. The peptide p7L was purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (Vydac C-8 column, 250 × 4.6 mm, flow rate 1 ml/min, solvent A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, solvent B, 99.9 acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) to better than 95% purity, and its composition and molecular mass were confirmed by amino acid analysis and mass spectroscopy. Because trifluoroacetate has a strong infrared absorbance at ∼1673 cm–1, which interferes with the characterization of the peptide Amide I band (24Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Chapman D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar), residual trifluoroacetic acid, used both in peptide synthesis and in the high-performance liquid chromatography mobile phase, was removed by several lyophilization/solubilization cycles in 10 mm HCl (25Zhang Y.P. Lewis R.N. Hodges R.S. McElhaney R.N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11572-11578Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).

The lipid composition of the synthetic endoplasmic reticulum was EPC/BPS/bovine brain l-α-phosphatidylinositol/SM/Chol at a molar ratio of 51:2.4:5.3:7.48:33.42 (26Bretscher M.S. Sci. Am. 1985; 253: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). All other reagents used were of analytical grade from Sigma. Water was deionized, twice distilled, and passed through Milli-Q equipment (Millipore Ibérica, Madrid, Spain) to a resistivity better than 18 mΩ cm. Vesicle Preparation—Aliquots containing the appropriate amount of lipid in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) were placed in a test tube, the solvents were removed by evaporation under a stream of O2-free nitrogen, and finally, traces of solvents were eliminated under vacuum in the dark for more than 3 h. The lipid films were resuspended in an appropriate buffer and incubated either at 25 or 10 °C above the phase transition temperature (Tm) with intermittent vortexing for 30 min to hydrate the samples and obtain multilamellar vesicles (MLV). The samples were frozen and thawed five times to ensure complete homogenization and maximization of peptide/lipid contacts with occasional vortexing. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) with a mean diameter of 0.1 and 0.2 μm for either leakage or hemifusion and fusion experiments were prepared from multilamellar vesicles by the extrusion method (27Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar) using polycarbonate filters with a pore size of 0.1 and 0.2 μm (Nuclepore Corp., Cambridge, CA). The phospholipid and peptide concentration were measured by methods described previously (28Böttcher C.J.F. Van Gent C.M. Fries C. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1961; 1061: 203-204Crossref Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 29Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar). Membrane Leakage Measurement—LUVs with a mean diameter of 0.1 μm were prepared as indicated above in buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and either CF at a concentration of 40 mm or FD10 at a concentration of 100 mg/ml. Non-encapsulated CF or FD10 were separated from the vesicle suspension through a filtration column containing Sephadex G-75 or Sephadex S500HR Sephacryl, respectively (GE Healthcare), eluted with buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Membrane rupture (leakage) of intraliposomal CF was assayed by treating the probe-loaded liposomes (final lipid concentration, 0.125 mm) with the appropriate amounts of peptide on microtiter plates using a microplate reader (FLUOstar; BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany), stabilized at 25 °C, with the appropriate amounts of peptide, each well containing a final volume of 170 μl. The medium in the microtiter plates was continuously stirred to allow the rapid mixing of peptide and vesicles. Membrane leakage of intraliposomal FD10 was carried out using 5 × 5-mm quartz cuvettes stabilized at 25 °C in a final volume of 400 μl (100 μm lipid concentration). Leakage was assayed until no more change in fluorescence was obtained. The fluorescence was measured using a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter. Changes in fluorescence intensity were recorded with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 492 and 517 nm, respectively. Excitation and emission slits were set at 5 nm. One hundred percent release was achieved by adding Triton X-100 to either the microtiter plate or to the cuvette to a final concentration of 0.5% (w/w). For details see Refs. 30Bernabeu A. Guillen J.

Phospholipid Mixing Measurement—Peptide-induced vesicle lipid mixing was measured by resonance energy transfer (32Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). This assay is based on the decrease in resonance energy transfer between two probes (NBD-PE and RhB-PE) when the lipids of the probe-containing vesicles are allowed to mix with lipids from vesicles lacking the probes. The concentration of each of the fluorescent probes within the liposome membrane was 0.6% mol. LUVs with a mean diameter of 0.2 μm were prepared as described above. Labeled and unlabeled vesicles at a proportion of 1:4 were placed in a 5 × 5-mm fluorescence cuvette at a final lipid concentration of 100 μm in a final volume of 400 μl, stabilized at 25 °C under constant stirring. The fluorescence was measured using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer using 467 and 530 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. Excitation and emission slits were set at 10 nm. The proportion of labeled and unlabeled vesicles, lipid concentration, and other experimental and measurement conditions were the same as indicated previously (31Moreno M.R. Guillen J. Perez-Berna A.J. Amoros D. Gomez A.I. Bernabeu A. Villalain J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 10572-10584Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Inner Monolayer Phospholipid Mixing (Fusion) Measurement—Peptide-induced phospholipid mixing of the inner monolayer was measured by a modification of the phospholipid mixing measurement stated above (33Meers P. Ali S. Erukulla R. Janoff A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 227-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This assay is based on the decrease in resonance energy transfer between two probes (NBD-PE and RhB-PE) when the lipids of the probe-containing vesicles are allowed to mix with lipids from vesicles lacking the probes. The concentration of each of the fluorescent probes within the liposome membrane was 0.6% mol. LUVs with a mean diameter of 0.2 μm were prepared as described above. LUVs were treated with sodium dithionite to completely reduce the NBD-labeled phospholipid located at the outer monolayer of the membrane. Final concentration of sodium dithionite was 100 mm (from a stock solution of 1 m dithionite in 1 m Tris, pH 10.0) and incubated for ∼1 h on ice in the dark. Sodium dithionite was then removed by size exclusion chromatography through a Sephadex G-75 filtration column (GE Healthcare) eluted with buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. The proportion of labeled and unlabeled vesicles, lipid concentration, and other experimental and measurement conditions were the same as indicated above for the phospholipid mixing assay. Peptide Binding to Vesicles—The partitioning of the peptide into the phospholipid bilayer was monitored by the fluorescence enhancement of tryptophan. Fluorescence spectra were recorded in a SLM Aminco 8000C spectrofluorometer with excitation and emission wavelengths of 290 and 348 nm, respectively, and 4-nm spectral bandwidths. Measurements were carried out in 20 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Intensity values were corrected for dilution, and the scatter contribution was derived from lipid titration of a vesicle blank. The data were analyzed as previously described (31Moreno M.R. Guillen J. Perez-Berna A.J. Amoros D. Gomez A.I. Bernabeu A. Villalain J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 10572-10584Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Steady-state Fluorescence Anisotropy—DPH and its derivatives represent popular membrane fluorescent probes for monitoring the organization and dynamics of membranes; whereas DPH is known to partition mainly into the hydrophobic core of the membrane, PA-DPH and TMA-DPH probes are oriented at the membrane bilayer with their charge localized at the lipid-water interface, TMA-DPH nearer the membrane surface than PA-DPH (34Lentz B.R. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1993; 64: 99-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). MLVs were formed in 100 mm NaCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Aliquots of PA-DPH, TMA-DPH, or DPH in N,N′-dimethylformamide (2 × 10–4 m) were directly added into the lipid dispersion to obtain a probe/lipid molar ratio of 1:500. Samples were incubated for 15, 45, or 60 min when TMA-DPH, PA-DPH, or DPH were used, respectively, 10 °C above the gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition temperature Tm of the phospholipid mixture. Afterward, the peptides were added to obtain a peptide/lipid molar ratio of 1:15 and incubated 10 °C above the Tm of each lipid for 1 h, with occasional vortexing. All fluorescence studies were carried using 5 × 5-mm quartz cuvettes in a final volume of 400 μl (315 μm lipid concentration). All the data were corrected for background intensities and progressive dilution. The steady-state fluorescence anisotropy, 〈r〉, was measured with an automated polarization accessory using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer, coupled to a Peltier device (Varian) for automatic temperature change. The data were analyzed as previously described (31Moreno M.R. Guillen J. Perez-Berna A.J. Amoros D. Gomez A.I. Bernabeu A. Villalain J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 10572-10584Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Quenching of Trp Emission by Water-soluble and Lipophilic Probes—For acrylamide quenching assays, aliquots from a 4 m solution of the water-soluble quencher were added to the solution-containing peptide in the presence and absence of liposomes at a peptide/lipid molar ratio of 1:100. The results obtained were corrected for dilution and the scatter contribution was derived from acrylamide titration of a vesicle blank. The data were analyzed according to the Stern-Volmer equation (35Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5546-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), I0/I = 1 + KSV(Q), where I0 and I represent the fluorescence intensities in the absence and the presence of the quencher (Q), respectively, and Ksv is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant, which is a measure of the accessibility of Trp to acrylamide. Quenching studies with lipophilic probes were performed by successive addition of small amounts of 5-NS or 16-NS in ethanol to the samples of the peptide incubated with LUV. The final concentration of ethanol was kept below 2.5% (v/v) to avoid any significant bilayer alterations. After each addition an incubation period of 15 min was kept before the measurement. The data were analyzed as previously described (31Moreno M.R. Guillen J. Perez-Berna A.J. Amoros D. Gomez A.I. Bernabeu A. Villalain J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 10572-10584Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Measurements Using FPE-labeled Membranes—LUVs with a mean diameter of 0.1 μm were prepared in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The vesicles were labeled exclusively in the outer bilayer leaflet with FPE as described previously (36Wall J. Ayoub F. O'Shea P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2673-2682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, LUVs were incubated with 0.1 mol % FPE dissolved in ethanol (never more than 0.1% of the total aqueous volume) at 37 °C for 1 h in the dark. Any remaining unincorporated FPE was removed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with the appropriate buffer. FPE vesicles were stored at 4 °C until use in an oxygen-free atmosphere. Fluorescence time courses of FPE-labeled vesicles were measured after the desired amount of peptide was added into 400 μl of lipid suspensions (200 μm lipid) using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 490 and 520 nm, respectively, using excitation and emission slits set at 5 nm. Temperature was controlled with a thermostatic bath at 25 °C. The contribution of light scattering to the fluorescence signals was measured in experiments without the dye and was subtracted from the fluorescence traces. Data were fitted either to a hyperbolic binding model (37Golding C. Senior S. Wilson M.T. O'Shea P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10931-10937Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using the following equation, F = (Fmax [P]/Kd + [P], where F is the fluorescence variation, Fmax the maximum fluorescence variation, [P] the peptide concentration, and Kd the dissociation constant of the membrane binding process. The experimental points shown in the figures are the mean values of at least three measurements. Thioflavin T Assay for Peptide Aggregation—Peptide aggregation was assayed by using thioflavin T (ThT). Thioflavin T associates rapidly with aggregated peptides giving rise to a new excitation maximum at 450 nm and a enhanced emission at 482 nm (38LeVine 3rd, H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). Buffer contained 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 25 μm ThT, pH 7.4, LUVs (final phospholipid concentration of 0.5 mm), and a peptide concentration of 5 μm. Fluorescence was measured before and after the desired amount of peptide was added into the cuvette using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer. Temperature was controlled with a thermostatic bath at 25 °C under constant stirring. Samples were excited at 450 nm (slit width, 5 nm) and fluorescence emission was recorded at 482 nm (slit width, 5 nm). Aggregation was quantified on a percentage basis according to equation: %A = [(Ff – F0) × 100] (Fmax – F0), where Ff is the value of fluorescence after peptide addition"
https://openalex.org/W2104887197,"MAb 2G12 neutralizes HIV-1 by binding with high affinity to a cluster of high-mannose oligosaccharides on the envelope glycoprotein, gp120. Screening of phage-displayed peptide libraries with 2G12 identified peptides that bind specifically, with K(d)s ranging from 0.4 to 200 microM. The crystal structure of a 21-mer peptide ligand in complex with 2G12 Fab was determined at 2.8 A resolution. Comparison of this structure with previous structures of 2G12-carbohydrate complexes revealed striking differences in the mechanism of 2G12 binding to peptide vs. carbohydrate. The peptide occupies a site different from, but adjacent to, the primary carbohydrate-binding site on 2G12, and makes only slightly fewer contacts to the Fab than Man(9)GlcNAc(2) (51 vs. 56, respectively). However, only two antibody contacts with the peptide are hydrogen bonds in contrast to six with Man(9)GlcNAc(2), and only three of the antibody residues that interact with Man(9)GlcNAc(2) also contact the peptide. Thus, this mechanism of peptide binding to 2G12 does not support structural mimicry of the native carbohydrate epitope on gp120, since it neither replicates the oligosaccharide footprint on the antibody nor most of the contact residues. Moreover, 2G12.1 peptide is not an immunogenic mimic of the 2G12 epitope, since antisera produced against it did not bind gp120."
https://openalex.org/W2043694037,"The three-dimensional structure of the hexameric (αβ)6 1.2-MDa complex formed by glutamate synthase has been determined at subnanometric resolution by combining cryoelectron microscopy, small angle x-ray scattering, and molecular modeling, providing for the first time a molecular model of this complex iron-sulfur flavoprotein. In the hexameric species, interprotomeric α-α and α-β contacts are mediated by the C-terminal domain of the α subunit, which is based on a β helical fold so far unique to glutamate synthases. The αβ protomer extracted from the hexameric model is fully consistent with it being the minimal catalytically active form of the enzyme. The structure clarifies the electron transfer pathway from the FAD cofactor on the β subunit, to the FMN on the α subunit, through the low potential [4Fe-4S]1+/2+ centers on the β subunit and the [3Fe-4S]0/1+ cluster on the α subunit. The (αβ)6 hexamer exhibits a concentration-dependent equilibrium with αβ monomers and (αβ)2 dimers, in solution, the hexamer being destabilized by high ionic strength and, to a lower extent, by the reaction product NADP+. Hexamerization seems to decrease the catalytic efficiency of the αβ protomer only 3-fold by increasing the Km values measured for l-Gln and 2-OG. However, it cannot be ruled out that the (αβ)6 hexamer acts as a scaffold for the assembly of multienzymatic complexes of nitrogen metabolism or that it provides a means to regulate the activity of the enzyme through an as yet unknown ligand. The three-dimensional structure of the hexameric (αβ)6 1.2-MDa complex formed by glutamate synthase has been determined at subnanometric resolution by combining cryoelectron microscopy, small angle x-ray scattering, and molecular modeling, providing for the first time a molecular model of this complex iron-sulfur flavoprotein. In the hexameric species, interprotomeric α-α and α-β contacts are mediated by the C-terminal domain of the α subunit, which is based on a β helical fold so far unique to glutamate synthases. The αβ protomer extracted from the hexameric model is fully consistent with it being the minimal catalytically active form of the enzyme. The structure clarifies the electron transfer pathway from the FAD cofactor on the β subunit, to the FMN on the α subunit, through the low potential [4Fe-4S]1+/2+ centers on the β subunit and the [3Fe-4S]0/1+ cluster on the α subunit. The (αβ)6 hexamer exhibits a concentration-dependent equilibrium with αβ monomers and (αβ)2 dimers, in solution, the hexamer being destabilized by high ionic strength and, to a lower extent, by the reaction product NADP+. Hexamerization seems to decrease the catalytic efficiency of the αβ protomer only 3-fold by increasing the Km values measured for l-Gln and 2-OG. However, it cannot be ruled out that the (αβ)6 hexamer acts as a scaffold for the assembly of multienzymatic complexes of nitrogen metabolism or that it provides a means to regulate the activity of the enzyme through an as yet unknown ligand.

GltS are found in bacteria, yeast, and plants, where they form with glutamine synthetase an essential pathway for ammonia assimilation (1Vanoni M.A. Curti B. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 617-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 2van den Heuvel R.H. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Cell Mol.

Bacterial NADPH-dependent GltS (NADPH-GltS) is formed by one α subunit (αGltS) and one β subunit (βGltS) of 162 and 52 kDa, respectively, for the Azospirillum brasilense GltS. The αβ protomer contains one FAD (on βGltS), one FMN (on αGltS), and three different iron-sulfur clusters (one [3Fe-4S]0/1+ cluster on αGltS and two [4Fe-4S]1+/2+ centers on βGltS; Fig. 1A). On the basis of sequence, structural, and mechanistic similarities, the NADPH-GltS serves as a model for the other two main forms of GltS, namely (i) the ferredoxin-dependent GltS found in cyanobacteria and photosynthetic tissues of plants, which is similar to αGltS and (ii) the eukaryotic type of GltS, which is NADH-dependent and is found in yeast, nonphotosynthetic tissues of plants, and lower eukaryotes; this GltS species is formed by a single polypeptide chain derived from the fusion of bacterial α and β subunits. glutamate synthase α subunit of glutamate synthase β subunit of glutamate synthase 2-oxoglutarate 2-iminoglutarate electron microscopy dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase 1,4-dithiothreitol midpoint potential glutamate synthase formed by the wild-type α subunit and a β subunit form carrying a C-terminal hexahistidinyl extension GltSHis variant resulting from deletion of the C-terminal 7 or 40 residues, respectively, of the α subunit l-methionine sulfone molecular mass NAD(P)H-dependent glutamate synthase small angle x-ray scattering. Several lines of evidence support an essential role of GltS in all of these cell types, making it a potential target of novel drugs. For example, the NADPH-GltS has been found to be essential in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, where it has been shown that <1 μm azaserine, a GltS inhibitor, is sufficient to inhibit growth of greater than 90% cells (4Lamichhane G. Zignol M. Blades N.J. Geiman D.E. Dougherty A. Grosset J. Broman K.W. Bishai W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7213-7218Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans, inactivation of the GltS-encoding gene (W07E11) leads to a lethal phenotype (see the WormBase data base on the World Wide Web). Finally, in plants, inactivation of the genes encoding the NADH- or the ferredoxin-dependent GltS forms leads to mutants impaired in growth due to the involvement of the enzyme in primary nitrogen assimilation and in photorespiration (5Coschigano K.T. Melo-Oliveira R. Lim J. Coruzzi G.M. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 6Lancien M. Martin M. Hsieh M.H. Leustek T. Goodman H. Coruzzi G.M. Plant J. 2002; 29: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). On the other hand, enhancing the GltS activity through protein and metabolic engineering is a viable option for modulating the NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H ratio (or the 2-OG level) in bioconversions (e.g. see Ref. 7Kong Q.X. Cao L.M. Zhang A.L. Chen X. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2007; 73: 1382-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the nitrogen assimilation pathway in nitrogen-fixing bacteria used as biofertilizers, or the response to osmotic or acid stress (8Natera V. Sobrevals L. Fabra A. Castro S. Curr. Microbiol. 2006; 53: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). NADPH-GltS from A. brasilense, a root-growth promoting nitrogen-fixing bacterium, is the best studied GltS. The three-dimensional structure of αGltS in complex with l-methionine sulfone (MetS, an l-Gln analog) and the 2-OG substrate has been solved by x-ray crystallography (9Binda C. Bossi R.T. Wakatsuki S. Arzt S. Coda A. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 8: 1299-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (77) Google Scholar), providing insights into the glutaminase and the synthase reactions taking place in this subunit (Fig. 1A). A combination of structural and functional experiments has shown that at least five steps at three different locations are necessary to carry out the overall reaction (1Vanoni M.A. Curti B. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 617-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 2van den Heuvel R.H. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 669-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 3Vanoni M.A. Curti B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 193-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A), namely NADPH oxidation (step 1) and transfer of reducing equivalents from FAD (on βGltS) to FMN (on αGltS) through at least two of the three [Fe-S] clusters (step 2) and binding and hydrolysis of l-Gln at the glutaminase site in the Type II (PurF) glutamine amidotransferase domain of αGltS (step 3) followed by transfer of the released ammonia molecule to the synthase site through the intramolecular tunnel (step 4). At the synthase site, the 2-iminoglutarate (2-IG) intermediate formed upon the addition of ammonia to 2-OG is reduced to l-Glu by reduced FMN (step 5). A striking feature of GltS is its ability to coordinate the activities of the NADPH-oxidizing site on βGltS, and the glutaminase and synthase sites on αGltS, the latter sites being connected by the intramolecular ammonia tunnel. In GltS, l-Gln hydrolysis occurs only when the enzyme is in its reduced state and bound to 2-OG, thus avoiding the waste of l-Gln (10Vanoni M.A. Edmondson D.E. Rescigno M. Zanetti G. Curti B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11478-11484Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, crystallization experiments of the NADPH-GltS αβ holoenzyme have been so far unsuccessful. Thus, the structure of βGltS, its association with its related α subunit partner within the αβ protomer, and, possibly, its association with other subunits within the complex remain to be established. Furthermore, the location and the role of the [4Fe-4S]1+/2+ clusters of βGltS only rely on indirect observations. Interestingly, the sequence of βGltS and, in particular, the spacing of its N-terminal conserved cysteine residues are similar to those of several other proteins or protein domains (1Vanoni M.A. Curti B. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 617-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), among which only the Pyrococcus furiosus sulfide dehydrogenase α subunit (11Hagen W.R. Silva P.J. Amorim M.A. Hagedoorn P.L. Wassink H. Haaker H. Robb F.T. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 527-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the bovine dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) (12Rosenbaum K.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 650-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) have been characterized to different extents. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments allowed us to confirm the location of the DPD-like [4Fe-4S] clusters of GltS within βGltS. It was also shown that they are not only involved in the electron transfer between FAD (on βGltS) and FMN (on αGltS) but also in the structuring of the N-terminal subdomain of βGltS forming the interface between the α and β GltS subunits (15Agnelli P. Dossena L. Colombi P. Mulazzi S. Morandi P. Tedeschi G. Negri A. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 436: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the loss of coupling of the glutaminase and synthase catalytic subsites within the isolated αGltS suggests that a conformational change occurs in this subunit upon association with βGltS (16Vanoni M.A. Fischer F. Ravasio S. Verzotti E. Edmondson D.E. Hagen W.R. Zanetti G. Curti B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1828-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For all of these reasons, obtaining information on the three-dimensional structure of the GltS αβ protomer is a key step toward the understanding of the sophisticated mechanism of action and regulation of this essential enzyme. In the present work, we used three-dimensional cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), and modeling to investigate the stoichiometry and the structure of the active oligomeric NADPH-GltS species in solution. The combined use of cryo-EM and SAXS allowed us to obtain an electron density map of the GltS (αβ)6 hexamer at a subnanometer resolution, which has been reached only recently, and only in a few cases, for cryo-EM-based structure determinations (17Connell S.R.

J. 2007; 36: 995-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Moreover, we propose a homology model of βGltS, and, more importantly, that of the αβ protomer. The latter sheds light on the intramolecular electron transfer process from FAD to FMN along the enzyme iron-sulfur clusters. Finally, modeling of the (αβ)6 oligomer of NADPH-GltS into the 9.5 Å resolution cryo-EM-derived electron density shows how the C-terminal β helical domain of αGltS acts as a structural spacer, which establishes interprotomeric α-α and α-β contacts, playing a key role in the oligomerization process. Enzymes—GltS or the species formed by the wild-type α subunit and a C-terminally His6-tagged variant of the β subunit (GltS-His) were overproduced in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and purified, quantified, and assayed as described previously (15Agnelli P.

Vanoni M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2720-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). αGltS was prepared and characterized as described in Ref. 16Vanoni M.A. Fischer F. Ravasio S. Verzotti E. Edmondson D.E. Hagen W.R. Zanetti G. Curti B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1828-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar. Steady-state kinetic analyses were carried out as in Ref. 15Agnelli P. Dossena L. Colombi P. Mulazzi S. Morandi P. Tedeschi G. Negri A. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 436: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar and references therein. Construction of GltS deletion mutants and other techniques are described in the supplemental material. Prior to each experiment, the protein solutions were transferred in 25 mm Hepes/KOH buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol by gel filtration through Sephadex G25 (medium) columns (PD10, prepacked disposable columns; GE Healthcare) equilibrated and eluted with the same buffer. If needed, the enzyme solution was concentrated to 10–30 mg/ml and stored frozen at –80 °C after flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. The same buffer was used for all dilutions. Small Angle X-ray Diffraction Data Collection—Synchrotron x-ray scattering data from solutions of GltS in the presence and absence of ligands and/or substrates were collected at the X33 beamline (DESY, Hamburg) (24Roessle M.W. Klaering R. Ristau U. Robrahn B. Jahn D. Gehrmann T. Konarev P.V. Round A. Fiedler S. Hermes C. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: s190-s194Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar) at protein concentrations (c) ranging from 0.75 to 10.0 mg/ml. At a sample-detector distance of 2.7 m, the range of momentum transfer 0.1 < s < 5 nm–1 was covered (s = 4π sin(θ)/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle and λ = 0.15 nm is the x-ray wavelength). The data were processed using standard procedures by the program package PRIMUS (25Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2374) Google Scholar). The forward scattering I(0) and the radii of gyration (Rg) were evaluated by the program AUTORG (26Petoukhov M.V. Konarev P.V. Kikhney A.G. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: s223-s228Crossref Scopus (371) Google Scholar) using the Guinier approximation (27Guinier A. Ann. Phys. (Paris). 1939; 12: 161-237Google Scholar), assuming that at very small angles (s < 1.3/Rg), the intensity is represented as I(s) = I(0) exp(–(sRg)2/3). The effective molecular mass of the solute (MM) was estimated by comparison of the forward scattering I(0) with that from reference solutions of bovine serum albumin (MM = 66 kDa). For the NaCl-containing solutions, the MM estimates were appropriately corrected to account for contrast reduction (factors 1.5 and 2.4 for 1 and 2 m NaCl, respectively). The scattering intensities for the monomeric, dimeric, and hexameric GltS computed by CRYSOL (28Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2790) Google Scholar) from the atomic coordinates taken from the cryo-EM model were employed to analyze the oligomeric composition of all of the samples. The program OLIGOMER (25Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2374) Google Scholar) was used to find the volume fractions of components minimizing the discrepancy χ2 (normalized sum of the reduced S.D. values) between the linear superposition of the weighted intensities of the components and the experimental data from the mixture. Specimen Preparation and Cryo-EM Data Collection—Grids with holey carbon films were prepared and vitrified by flash freezing in liquid ethane (29Adrian M. Dubochet J. Lepault J. McDowall A.W. Nature. 1984; 308: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). For the initial three-dimensional reconstruction, a GltS sample (6.2 mg/ml) was observed in a Philips CM12 electron microscope using an acceleration voltage of 120 kV and a magnification of ×45,000. Each field was recorded with subsequent tilt angles of 45 and 0° and with defocus values of –1.6 and –1.2 μm, respectively. Additional untilted specimen images of the wild-type GltS complex and of the isolated αGltS were recorded on the same instrument, with sample concentrations of 9.25 mg/ml and 7 mg/ml, respectively. For high resolution studies, the sample was observed in a JEOL JEM 2100F, using an acceleration voltage of 200 kV, a spherical aberration of 0.5 mm, and a magnification of ×50,000. Images were recorded under low dose conditions (10 electrons/Å2) on Kodak SO 163 film. Three-dimensional Reconstruction—For the initial three-dimensional reconstruction, 437 pairs of particles were extracted from 12 pairs of tilted-untilted images, interactively, using the program WEB (30Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). A preliminary three-dimensional model was reconstructed with the software package SPIDER (30Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar) using the random conical tilt series method (31Radermacher M. Wagenknecht T. Verschoor A. Frank J. J. Microsc. 1987; 146: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). This model was refined using the projection matching method (32Penczek P.A. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1994; 53: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) with 1344 particle images extracted from five additional untilted specimen images. A few final refinement iterations were performed with imposed D3 symmetry until the resolution stabilized at 26 Å, as estimated with the Fourier shell correlation criterion (33Harauz G. van Heel M. Optik. 1986; 73: 146-156Google Scholar). For the high resolution reconstruction, micrographs with anisotropic or no diffraction rings were removed using the enhanced power spectra sorting method (34Jonic S. Sorzano C.O. Cottevieille M. Larquet E. Boisset N. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). 60,000 particle images were selected automatically from 84 remaining micrographs using Roseman's particle selection algorithm (35Roseman A.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 145: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, only 13000 particle images were kept after visual inspection and splitting in defocus groups. The parameters of the contrast transfer function of the electron microscope were computed for each particle with the program CTFTILT (36Mindell J.A. Grigorieff N. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 142: 334-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). An iterative refinement of the low resolution three-dimensional model was performed with SPIDER, using the projection matching method coupled with the method of correction of the contrast transfer function by Wiener filtering of volumes from focal series (37Penczek P.A. Zhu J. Schröder R. Frank J. Scanning Microsc. 1997; 11: 147-154Google Scholar). D3 symmetry was imposed, and different filters were applied on the reference volume at different stages of the refinement until the resolution improved and stabilized at 9.5 Å (33Harauz G. van Heel M. Optik. 1986; 73: 146-156Google Scholar). The Fourier amplitudes of the final, nonfiltered volume were enhanced using the GltS SAXS data as described in Ref. 38Gabashvili I.S. Agrawal R.K. Spahn C.M.

Atomic Structure Fitting and Modeling—Sequences of βGltS (SwissProt accession number Q05756) and DPD (Protein Data Bank code 1h7w (14Dobritzsch D. Schneider G. Schnackerz K.D. Lindqvist Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 650-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar)) were first roughly aligned using ClustalW (39Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J.

Then the secondary structure prediction methods SOPMA, PHD, and PREDATOR, integrated in the metaserver [email protected] (41Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deleage G. Trends Biochem.

Life Sci. 1997; 53: 621-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) were applied to βGltS. The secondary structures predicted for βGltS were compared with the corresponding ones of DPD calculated by DSSP (44Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12421) Google Scholar), allowing us to optimize the alignment. This alignment was used with MODELLER 7v7 (45Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) to generate homology models by satisfaction of spacial restraints derived from the alignment. The α2 GltS dimer (Protein Data Bank code 1ea0 (9Binda C. Bossi R.T. Wakatsuki S. Arzt S. Coda A. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 8: 1299-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (77) Google Scholar)) was submitted to the algorithm “loop” of MODELLER to model the unresolved regions 305–307, 1172–1179, and 1194–1202 of chains A and B. Only the seven C-terminal residues (residues 1473–1479) of αGltS, absent in the Protein Data Bank file, remain missing in the final pseudoatomic model of GltS. To perform the fitting of atomic data into the cryo-EM map, the following programs were compared: (i) rigid body fitting in Fourier space with Colores and Colacor algorithms of SITUS (46Wriggers W. Milligan R.A. McCammon J.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 47Chacon P. Wriggers W. J. Mol.

Biol. 2001; 308: 1033-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar); (iii) real space fitting using the operation “Fit Model in Map” of Chimera (50Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S.

Biol. 2007; 157: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). A first α2 dimer was fitted, and the 3-fold symmetry was used to calculate the atomic coordinates of the other two. Due to the unambiguous dispositions of the subunits, these different programs yielded equivalent results. Then a βGltS model was fitted independently, and D3 symmetry was used to calculate the positions of the other ones. An automatic check with Chimera software showed no significant steric hindrance between the fitted subunits. This fitting was compared with another procedure, consisting of fitting independently the α- and βGltS monomers. However, this approach did not improve the model. Molecular graphics images were produced using the UCSF Chimera package from the Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics at the University of California, San Francisco (supported by National Institutes of Health Grant P41 RR-01081). The experimental density map (accession code EMD-1440) and the fitted atomic coordinates of GltS (Protein Data Bank code 2vdc) have been deposited in the Macromolecular Structure Database. To obtain a preliminary three-dimensional reconstruction volume, preparations of GltS were observed by cryo-EM with the specimen grid tilted at 45 and 0°, respectively (Fig. 1B). Digitized images were subjected to the random conical tilt series technique, a three-dimensional reconstruction method inspired by tomographic approaches (31Radermacher M. Wagenknecht T. Verschoor A.

The volume obtained at this stage was solved at a resolution of 26 Å, which was sufficient to clarify two important points concerning the structure of the oligomeric complex. First, although no symmetry was enforced during the three-dimensional reconstruction process, the particles produced well defined rectangular side views (Fig. 1C) and triangular top views (Fig. 1D), specific for a 322 point group symmetry. Second, using the rigid body fitting techniques of SITUS (46Wriggers W. Milligan R.A. McCammon J.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 47Chacon P.

Hence, the stoichiometry of the whole complex was unambiguously determined with six αGltS, forming the three pillars of the complex, and six smaller masses, connecting these pillars, most likely corresponding to βGltS. Interestingly, the crystallographic asymmetric unit of αGltS contains α2 dimers, but the analysis of the geometry of adjacent dimers in the crystals revealed that they interact to form tetramers, with a structure essentially corresponding to that of two adjacent pillars of the cryo-EM-derived hexameric model of GltS (supplemental Fig. 1). To improve the resolution of the three-dimensional reconstruction, as needed to propose a complete structural model of the (αβ)6 oligomeric GltS complex, additional cryo-EM images were collected with the specimen grid untilted, using a JEOL 2100F electron microscope under low dose conditions. Micrographs of the highest quality were selected as described in Ref. 34Jonic S. Sorzano C.O. Cottevieille M. Larquet E. Boisset N. J. Struct.

https://openalex.org/W2047386514,"The N terminus-truncated splicing variant of TAp63 is known as ΔNp63. ΔNp63 lacks transactivation function and is thought to antagonize the transcriptional regulation of the p53 and TAp63 target genes. Overexpression of ΔNp63 has been observed in a number of human cancers, suggesting a role in carcinogenesis. In the present study we present data showing that the ΔNp63 gene promoter activity is positively regulated by ΔNp63α, and such positive autoregulation is mediated via activation of STAT3 activity. We show that expression of ΔNp63α in Hep3B cells induces Stat3 phosphorylation on Tyr-705 and Ser-727. A putative STAT3-responsive element (STAT3-RE) is identified in the ΔNp63 promoter region. Electrophoretic mobility shift and avidin biotin-Conjugated DNA assays show direct binding of STAT3 to STAT3-RE of the ΔNp63 promoter, and such binding is stimulated by ΔNp63α. Binding of the endogenous STAT3 to the ΔNp63 promoter in Hep3B cells was demonstrated by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The stimulation of the ΔNp63 transcriptional activity by ΔNp63α is abolished by Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/STAT3 inhibitor AG490, dominant-negative STAT3, STAT3 small interfering RNA, and deletion of the STAT3-RE sequence from ΔNp63 promoter. Taken together these observations clearly indicated that autoregulation of ΔNp63 gene transcription is mediated through activation of STAT3 and its subsequent binding to the STAT3RE. Because the activation of STAT3 by interleukin-6 also leads to ΔNp63 up-regulation and the blockade of ΔNp63 or STAT3 expression by siRNA leads to repression of the cell growth, the identified regulatory pathway is presumably of cell physiological significance.

The discovery of the transcription factor p63 was soon followed by back-to-back reports showing that p63 is essential for the development of a number of epithelial structures, including skin, breast, prostate, urothelia, and others (1Mills A.A. Zheng B. Wang X-J. Vogel H. Roop D.R. Bradley A. Nature. 1999; 398: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). High levels of p63 expression were found in the basal cells of many stratified epithelial tissues in which a majority of human neoplasm develops (1Mills A.A. Zheng B. Wang X-J. Vogel H. Roop D.R. Bradley A. Nature. 1999; 398: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). A number of studies contended that p63 identifies keratinocyte stem cells (2Pellegrini G. Dellambra E. Golisano O. Martinelli E. Fantozzi I. Bondanza S. Ponzin D. McKeon F. De Luca M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3156-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar); however, subsequent work by others soon found that p63 expression is not limited to stem cells of the epithelial tissues that express this gene (3Wang D-Y. Hsueh Y.-J. Yang V.C. Chen J.-K. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 4698-4704Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). p63 is a transcription factor that transactivates p53 target genes. Splicing variants lacking N-terminal transactivation domain, known as ΔNp63, are thought to antagonize p53 and p63 (4Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dotsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D. McKeon F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar). ΔNp63 is predominantly expressed in the basal cells of various stratified epithelia and is overexpressed in some human cancers including bladder carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancers, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and liver cancers. These observations suggest that overexpression of ΔNp63 may have important implications in carcinogenesis (5Massion P.P. Taflan P.M. Jamshedur Rahman S.M. Yildiz P. Shyr Y. Edgerton M.E.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7607-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) reported the presence of a p53 binding site located at –495 to –473 relative to the transcriptional start site of exon-3′ in the ΔNp63 promoter region, suggesting that p53 may regulate the promoter activity of the ΔNp63 gene. In addition, they showed that ΔNp63 is also recruited to this element and may contribute to the down-regulation of ΔNp63 promoter activity. It is likely that ΔNp63 promoter is a positive and negative transcriptional target of p53 and ΔNp63, respectively.

Recently, STAT3 was found to negatively regulate the induction of the innate and adaptive immunity by tumor cells, suggesting further implications of the STAT3 pathway in human tumors (10Wang T. Niu G. Kortylewski M. Burdelya L. Shain K. Zhang S. Bhattacharya R. Gabrilovich D. Heller R. Coppola D. Dalton W. Jove R. Pardoll D. Yu H.

Leukemia-inhibiting factor signals through a heteromeric receptor to activate STAT3; this signal has been shown to play essential roles in maintaining self-renewal of the stem cells (11Niwa H. Burdon T. Chambers I. Smith A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2048-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). Like other STAT proteins, STAT3 is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation at a single site close to the C terminus (Tyr-705) as well as by serine phosphorylation at a site within the transactivation domain (Ser-727). Tyrosine phosphorylation in response to cytokine stimulation is mediated by a Janus kinase, most often the JAK1. Tyr-705 phosphorylation is required for STAT3 dimerization, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding, resulting in enhanced transcription of STAT-responsive genes, such as the c-fos, junB, vascular endothelial growth factor, and vasoactive intestinal peptide genes (12Guschin D.

Several observations suggest a positive role for Ser-727 phosphorylation in STAT3 transcriptional activity, presumably through enhanced recruitment of some necessary transcriptional cofactors (15Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). To date, a linkage between STAT3 activity and ΔNp63 expression has not been reported. signal transducers and activators of transcription STAT3-responsive element small interfering RNA 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-dipheyl tetrazolium bromide Janus kinase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mitogen-activated protein c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase interleukin DNA binding domain 4-dimethylaminopyridine. In the present study we show that ΔNp63α exerts a positive regulatory effect (autoregulation) on the activity of ΔNp63 promoter in Hep3B human liver carcinoma cells, and activation of STAT3 is critical for the ΔNp63 promoter activity. The ΔNp63α-induced autoregulation was repressed when STAT3 activity was blocked by AG490, transfection of dominant-negative STAT3 (Y705F), and STAT3 siRNA. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the autoregulation of the ΔNp63 promoter, we identified a putative STAT3-responsive element (STAT3-RE) in the ΔNp63 promoter region. We show that this putative STAT3-RE is involved in the up-regulation of the ΔNp63 promoter activity by ΔNp63. Cell Culture—Human liver cancer cell line Hep3B was obtained from Food Industry Research and Development Institute, Taiwan. The cells were maintained in basal medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 at 3:1, v/v; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2, 95% air. Construction of ΔNp63 Promoter-Luciferase Constructs and Expressing Vectors—The PCR reactions were carried out with the sequence-specific primer pairs; these primers were all designed to contain a XhoI site and a HindIII site for the subsequent cloning reactions. Desired DNA fragments were PCR-amplified and inserted into luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic, a promoter- and enhancer-less vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The inserts were positioned in sense orientation relative to the luciferase coding sequence between XhoI and HindIII sites. Proper insertion was verified by direct DNA sequencing. The nomenclature of pGL3-823-Luc was based on the length of the insert upstream to the transcriptional start site of the ΔNp63 promoter. The 494-bp fragment containing the human GAPDH promoter (16Trompeter H-I. Gomez-Lozano N. Santourlidis S. Eisermann B. Wernet P. Vilches C. Uhrberg M. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 4135-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was amplified from human DNA using primers 5′-CCCCTCGAGTCGAGGAGAAGTTCCCCAACTTTC-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTCGAAGCGGGAGGCTGCGGGCTCA-3′. The fragment was inserted into pGL3-Basic via XhoI and HindIII site to obtain vector pGL3-GAPDH-Luc. The STAT3 luciferase reporter, pGL3-STAT3RE-Luc, was constructed with five tandem copies of STAT3-RE from the 5′-flanking region of the ΔNp63 gene followed by one copy of minimal TATA box. The construct is subcloned into pGL3-basic. A full-length human ΔNp63α cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 1–586 lacking the stop codon was generated by oligo-dT-primed reverse transcription-PCR using total RNA isolated from human bladder cancer cell line HT1376. The primers used were: forward, 5′-GCCATGTTGTACCTGGAAAACAATGCC-3′; reverse, 5′-CTCCCCCTCCTCTTTGATGCGCTGTT-3′. The forward primer was designed to contain the start codon triplet of the human ΔNp63α cDNA. The STAT3 wild type cDNA was generated by reverse transcription-PCR. The primers used were: forward, 5′-AGGATGGCCCAATGGAATCAGCTAC-3′; reverse, 5′-CATGGGGGAGGTAGCGCACTCCGAGG-3′. The PCR products were cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-HisTOPO vector (Invitrogen) to generate the plasmid pCMV-ΔNp63α and pCMV-STAT3 wild type, respectively. Site-directed Mutagenesis of pGL3-823-Luc Vector—To construct pGL3-823-Luc vector containing a deletion mutation in the STAT3-responsive element (pGL3–823ρSTAT3-Luc), the consensus STAT3 binding site, –557 to –539 relative to the transcriptional start site of ΔNp63, was deleted. Site-directed mutagenesis of pGL3-823-Luc vector was carried out using PCR methods. Briefly, the PCR mixture contained 1 μgof pGL3-823-Luc vector, 12.5 μl of 2× Extensor Hi-fidelity PCR Master Mix (ABgene) (consisting 350 μm dNTP, 2.25 μm MgCl2, and 2.5 units of extensor PCR enzyme), and 0.1 μg of each primer. The synthetic oligonucleotide primers were 5′-GGACACATTTATCAGGATTATGGATGTTTGTTTGTTTTTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAAAAACAAACAAACATCCATAATCCTGATAAATGTGTCC-3′ (antisense). pCMV-STAT3-DN (Y705F) and pCMV-STAT3-C (constitutive) were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. The primers used for these mutations were as described previously (17Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5961-5964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). PCR was performed by three-temperature cycles; 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 8 min for a total of 12 cycles. After PCR, the methylated parental DNA template was digested with 20 units of DpnI (NEB, Schwalbach, Germany) at 37 °C overnight. The DNA fragment containing the desired mutation was transformed into competent Escherichia coli JM109 cells, which are capable of repairing the nicked DNA. Colonies were selected on LB agar plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. The presence of the desired mutation was verified by direct DNA sequencing. Luciferase Assay—Transient transfection of luciferase reporter plasmids was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the protocol recommended by the supplier. The cells were seeded in 12-well tissue culture plates at 2 × 105 per well in 1 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) 24 h before transfection. On the day of transfection, the cells were exposed to DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 mixtures containing 0.5 μg of luciferase reporter plasmids and 0.2 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase control vector (Promega). To analyze the ΔNp63 promoter activity in response to appropriate expressing vector, various amounts of pCMV-expressing vector and pCMV empty vectors (Invitrogen) were added to the DNA-Lipofectamine mixtures. The same amounts of pCMV-empty vectors were used as controls. After incubation for 24 h, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 150 μl of 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Lysates were used directly for luciferase activity assay (Promega) performed according to the manufacturer's protocols. β-Galactosidase enzyme assay (Promega) was also performed with the same lysates to standardize the transcription efficiency. All experiments were performed at least three times, and the mean relative luciferase activity was obtained. siRNA Transfection—The sense siRNA sequences were purchased from MWG-Biotech (AG), including STAT3 siRNA, 5′-AGUCAGGUUGCUGGUCAAA-3′ (19Silver D.L. Naora H. Liu J. Cheng W. Montell D.J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3550-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), ΔNp63 siRNA, 5′-UCAAUGCCCAGACUCAAUU-3′, p63-DBD siRNA, 5′-CCAUGAGCUGAGCCGUGAA-3′ (20Lee H-O. Lee J.-H. Choi E. Seol J.Y. Yun Y. Lee H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and control non-silencing siRNA, 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′. The Hep3B Cells were grown in Opti-MEM till 60% confluent. The cells were cotransfected with the desired siRNA (40 nm), pSV-β-galactosidase vector (0.2 μg/ml) and pGL3-823-Luc (0.5 μg/ml) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity and β-galactosidase activity were measured. Preparation of Cell Lysate and Western Blot Analysis—The cells (1 × 106) were seeded into 100-mm tissue culture plates 1 day before transfection and were transfected with an appropriate amount of the expression plasmid or pCMV-empty vector. For the preparation of total cell lysate, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (M-PER; Pierce). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extract were prepared using nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction Kits (NE-PER™ Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents; Pierce), respectively. All the lysis buffers contained 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1× mixture protease inhibitor (Sigma). Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Protein samples were fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto Immobilon(TM)-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), blocked in Tris-buffered saline-Tween, and probed with primary antibodies (1:1000 for phospho-STAT3 (Ser-727 and Tyr-705), phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-204), phospho-JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185), phospho-p38 MAP kinase (Thr-180/Tyr-182), 1:2000 for p63, STAT3, V5, and 1:10000 for GAPDH) overnight at 4° C. The membrane was then incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000 in Tris-buffered saline-Tween). Immunoreactive protein bands were visualized by Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). Primary antibodies used were p63 (4A4) monoclonal antibody, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase monoclonal antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), V5 polyclonal antibody (Novus, Littleton, CO), STAT3 polyclonal antibody, phospho-STAT3 (Ser-727 and Tyr-705) antibody, phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody, phospho-JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185) antibody, and phospho-p38 MAP kinase (Thr-180/Tyr-182) antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Cells were transfected with various amounts of pCMV-empty or pCMV-ΔNp63α for 24 h. STAT3-specific DNA binding assay was performed using a LightShift chemiluminescent electrophoretic mobility shift assay kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclear extract prepared from cells transfected with ΔNp63α was used for analysis. Briefly, an aliquot of nuclear extract containing 3 μg of protein was incubated with 2 μl of 10× binding buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl; 10 mm dithiothreitol) containing 2.5% glycerol, 20 fmol of biotin-labeled STAT3-RE probe, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)) in a total volume of 20 μl for 20 min at room temperature. The STAT3-RE probe used for the reaction contains the putative STAT3 binding site of the ΔNp63 promoter with a sequence of 5′-GGATTCCTATTTCCCGTACATAATATGGAT-3. The reaction mixtures were fractionated on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon-NY+ membrane (Millipore). After the membrane was incubated with LightShift stabilized streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, the luminol/enhancer and stable peroxide solution, the STAT3 and DNA complexes were visualized by exposure of the membrane to x-ray film. The specificity of the identified STAT3 and DNA binding activity was confirmed by using a 200-fold excess of unlabeled hSIE oligonucleotides. hSIE is a high-affinity serum-inducible consensus STAT3 binding element derived from the c-fos promoter. Avidin Biotin-conjugated DNA Binding Assay—Five hundred μg of pCMV-empty or pCMV-ΔNp63α-transfected whole-cell extracts were precleared with 30 μl of a 50% slurry of streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads (Pierce) in avidin biotin-conjugated DNA binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× mixture protease inhibitor; Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. The suspensions were incubated with 10 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 100 pmol of biotinylated annealed probes at room temp for 20 min. The biotinylated annealed probes used were STAT3-RE, 5′-GGATTCCTATTTCCCGTACATAATATGGAT-3, and STAT3-REmut, 5′-GGATTCCTATCGTACGTACATAATATGGAT-3. The DNA-protein complex was precipitated with 30 μl of streptavidin-agarose for 30 min, washed 3 times in binding buffer, eluted by boiling in 2× SDS loading buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by Western blotting using anti-STAT3 (Cell Signaling) antibody for detection. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin Immunoprecipitation assay was performed using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions with some modifications. Briefly, Hep3B cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde (Sigma) at room temperature for 10 min and stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm for 5 min. The cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and collected in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged for 4 min at 2000 rpm. The cell pellet was resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for 10 min on ice. Cell lysate was then centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm, and the supernatant was sonicated to shear the DNA to obtain a size of ∼200 –1000 bp. Sonicated lysate was then diluted to 1 ml with chromatin Immunoprecipitation dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 167 mm NaCl) followed by preclearing with 80 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose beads for 30 min at 4 °C with rotation. The precleared lysate was next immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-STAT3 (Cell Signaling) or 1 μg of nonimmunized goat IgG at 4 °C overnight with rotation. Chromatin-antibody complexes were collected with 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose beads and washed once with 1 ml each of low salt immune complex wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 150 mm NaCl), high salt immune complex wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 500 mm NaCl), and LiCl immune complex wash buffer (250 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) and twice with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA). Immune complexes were then eluted using freshly prepared elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3). Cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C for 4 h in the presence of NaCl followed by RNase A treatment for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were treated with proteinase K and incubated at 45 °C for 1 h. The DNA was recovered by a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After purification, PCR was used to analyze immunoprecipitated DNA with the following primers: ΔNp63–719, 5′-CATAGATGCATCACGTGCA-3′ (sense); ΔNp63–464, 5′-GCAATTACAAAATAAGCTACCTG-3′ (antisense). One microliter of the purified DNA was subjected to 30 cycles of PCR amplification in a volume of 25 μl (denaturing at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 50 °C for 1 min, extension at 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 3 min) by means of Go Taq® Green Master Mix (Promega). The PCR reactions was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. 3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-dipheyl Tetrazolium Bromide (MTT) Cell Survival Assay—Hep3B cells (5 × 104) per well in 96-well plate were treated with various concentrations of AG490. After 24 h, 10 μl of MTT labeling reagent was added to each well. Four hours later, the cells were lysed, and absorbance at 550 was measured. The assays were performed in triplicate, and the result was presented as means ± S.D. Colony Formation Assay—The Hep3B cells (2 × 105 cells) were seeded in 35-mm dishes. The cells were transfected with either non-silencing siRNA, ΔNp63 siRNA, STAT3 siRNA, or p63-DBD siRNA (40 nm). Twenty-four hours after siRNA transfection, the cells were harvested and seeded in 60-mm dishes at 800 cells per dish. The medium was changed every 3 days, and cell colonies were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stained with 0.25% crystal violet on day 10. ΔNp63 Exerts a Positive Effect on the ΔNp63 Promoter Activity—ΔNp63 has been suggested to repress ΔNp63 gene expression through suppression of the p53-induced ΔNp63 transcriptional activity (9Harmes D.C. Bresnick E. Lubin E.A. Watson J.K. Heim K.E. Curtin J.C. Suskind A.M. Lamb J. DiRenzo J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7607-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the present study we reexamined the possible role of ΔNp63 on the ΔNp63 promoter activity. We cotransfected ΔNp63 expressing vector pCMV-ΔNp63α with pGL3-823-Luc into Hep3B cells and examined the reporter activity. As shown in Fig. 1, pGL3-823-Luc reporter activity was dose dependently stimulated by an increasing transfection dose of pCMV-ΔNp63α; an increase of the reporter activity from 1.7- to 4.4-fold was observed when pCMV-ΔNp63α was increased from 0.05 to 0.2 μg/ml compared with that of the pCMV-ΔNp63α-untransfected control cells. To examine the promoter specificity, we used reporter vector containing GAPDH promoter in the luciferase assay as a parallel control. We showed that an increased transfection dose of pCMV-ΔNp63α does not significantly affect the promoter activity of pGL3-GAPDH-Luc (Fig. 1). STAT3 Transactivates ΔNp63 Gene—The role of STAT3 in the regulation of the ΔNp63 gene expression was further examined. It has been reported (18Kaptein A. Paillard V. Saunders M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5961-5964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) that substitution of two cysteine residues in the C-terminal SH2 domain of STAT3 resulted in constitutive activation. The constitutive STAT3 is designated as STAT3-C in this report. The cells were transfected with STAT3-DN- or STAT3-C-expressing vector (both at 0.2 μg/ml) for 24 h and were then treated with IL-6 (50 ng/ml), a STAT3-activating cytokine (21Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Biochem. J. 2003; 15: 1-20Crossref Google Scholar), for another 24 h to induced expression of ΔNp63α. ΔNp63α protein level in Hep3B cells was analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2A, in empty vector-transfected cells, the ΔNp63α protein level was increased by IL-6 stimulation compared with that of the unstimulated control cells, and the increase was abolished by STAT3-DN. Transfection with STAT3-C exhibited no further effect on a IL-6-induced increase in ΔNp63α protein level. To demonstrate STAT3 alone is sufficient to transactivation of ΔNp63 gene, STAT3 expressing vector, pCMV-STAT3-C, or pCMV-STAT3-DN (Y705F) was cotransfected with pGL3-823-Luc into Hep3B cells. Fig. 2B shows that pGL3-823-Luc reporter activity (24 h after transfection) was increased by 4.0-fold or was unchanged in cells transfected with STAT3-C or STAT3-DN vector, respectively. These results suggest that activated STAT3 can transactivate ΔNp63. Our results clearly showed that the transcriptional activity of the ΔNp63 promoter was positively regulated by ΔNp63α (Fig. 1), cytokine IL-6 (Fig. 2A), or activated STAT3 (Fig. 2, A and B). We next examined whether STAT3 and ΔNp63α protein act in parallel. We suggested that if ΔNp63α and STAT3 act through the same pathway, then exposure of the ΔNp63α-transfected cells to STAT3 activator (IL-6) would have no further stimulatory effect on the ΔNp63 promoter activity. On the other hand, if STAT3 and ΔNp63α act on separate signaling pathways, the transactivation would be additive. As shown in Fig. 2C, in empty vector-transfected cells, the luciferase activity was increased by 3.5-fold upon IL-6 stimulation compared with that of the IL-6-untreated cells. The IL-6-induced promoter activity was further confirmed by ΔNp63 Western blot analysis as shown in Fig. 2A. Clearly, IL-6-induced ΔNp63 promoter activity was not further increased by pCMV-ΔNp63α transfection, suggesting ΔNp63α and STAT3 probably act through the same signaling pathway. A STAT3-responsive Element Is Present in the ΔNp63 Promoter—For STAT3 to transactivate ΔNp63 gene transcription, it is assumed that at least a STAT3 responsive element (RE) has to be present in the promoter region. We used TRANSFAC data base and MatInspector program to do the search. A putative STAT3 binding site was identified in the 5′-flanking region at –557 to –539 (Fig. 3A). To examine if the putative STAT3-RE responds to STAT3 for transcriptional regulation, Hep3B cells were cotransfected with STAT3-expressing vector and pGL3-STAT3RE-Luc reporter, which contains five tandem copies of the putative STAT3-RE (–557 to –539) followed by a minimal TATA box and a luciferase gene. The luciferase activity was increased by 7.4-fold by STAT3-C transfection compared with that of the empty vector control (Fig. 3B). Cotransfection with STAT3-DN exhibited a very minor effect on the luciferase activity. ΔNp63 Activates STAT3 in Hep3B Cells—The positive autoregulation of the ΔNp63 gene transcriptio"

The potato tuber small subunit (SS) displays both catalytic and regulatory properties, whereas the exact role of the large subunit (LS), which contains substrate and effector binding sites, remains unresolved. We identified a mutation, S302N, which increased the solubility of the recombinant potato tuber LS and, in turn, enabling it to form a homotetrameric structure. The LS302N homotetramer possesses very little enzyme activity at a level 100-fold less than that seen for the unactivated SS homotetramer.

Res. 2004; 79: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). These subunit types share considerable sequence identity (∼53%) and similarity (∼73%) indicating that both subunits originated from a common gene ancestor which has diverged at different rates over time (5Georgelis N. Braun E.L. Shaw J.R. Hannah L.C. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1458-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 6Hwang S.K. Hamada S. Okita T.W.

Chem. 2005; 280: 10189-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). When expressed in bacteria, the SS (SWT) of the potato tuber AGPase is capable of forming a catalytically active homotetrameric enzyme (8Salamone P.R. Greene T.W. Kavakli I.H. Okita T.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Compared with the wild-type AGPase heterotetramer, the potato SWT homotetramer requires nearly 24-fold greater levels of 3-PGA for maximal enzyme activity and is more sensitive to the inhibitor inorganic phosphate (Pi) (8Salamone P.R. Greene T.W. Kavakli I.H. Okita T.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9Hwang S.K. Salamone P.R. Okita T.W. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). When fully activated by high concentrations of 3-PGA, the kinetic behavior of the SWT homotetramer is similar to the wild-type heterotetramer and cyanobacterial AGPases (10Gomez-Casati D.F. Preiss J. Iglesias A.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the LS is essential for optimal allosteric regulatory properties of the heterotetrameric enzyme. It is also noteworthy that introduction of only one or two amino acid changes generates a SS homotetramer with regulatory properties that are comparable to or more sensitive to 3-PGA than the wild-type heterotetrameric enzymes (8Salamone P.R. Greene T.W. Kavakli I.H. Okita T.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Salamone P.R. Kavakli I.H. Slattery C.J. Okita T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1070-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Earlier studies (12Ballicora M.A. Frueauf J.B. Fu Y. Schurmann P. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1315-1320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 13Fu Y. Ballicora M.A. Leykam J.F. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25045-25052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) suggested that the inter-subunit disulfide bond between two SSs of the potato tuber AGPase heterotetramer also plays a significant role in controlling enzyme activity and stability. When the bond was cleaved by reduction of cysteine residues by DTT or thioredoxins, the AGPase became more sensitive to activation by low levels of 3-PGA and less stable at elevating temperature. This redox modification of the plant AGPase was more evident in planta and significantly affected AGPase activities and starch synthesis (14Geigenberger P. Kolbe A. Tiessen A. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 1469-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 15Kolbe A. Tiessen A. Schluepmann H. Paul M. Ulrich S. Geigenberger P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar).By contrast, less information is available on the role of the LS subunit in enzyme function. Unlike the SS, the potato tuber AGPase LS is unable to self-assemble into an active tetramer when expressed in bacteria and readily forms inclusion bodies. Hence, all available evidence on the role of LS for the potato tuber AGPase activity has been obtained by studying its operability with the SS. Site-directed mutagenesis studies on conserved residues predicted to bind to effectors and substrates in the potato tuber subunits, suggest that the SS is catalytic and regulatory, whereas the LS lacked these properties and simply modulates the regulatory activity of the SS by protein-to-protein interactions (18Fu Y. Ballicora M.A. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 19Frueauf J.B. Ballicora M.A. Preiss J. Plant J. 2003; 33: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). An alternative view on subunit roles in enzyme function was obtained by the study of potato heterotetrameric enzymes formed by different combinations of wild-type and mutant LSs and SSs (9Hwang S.K. Salamone P.R. Okita T.W. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Such results showed that the net allosteric properties of the heterotetrameric enzyme is contributed by both subunits and is a product of synergy between LS and SS interactions. A similar conclusion for a regulatory role for the LS was also made for the maize endosperm AGPase (20Cross J.M. Clancy M. Shaw J.R. Greene T.W. Schmidt R.R. Okita T.W. Hannah L.C. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).The LS of the potato tuber AGPase is also likely to significantly participate in catalysis by affecting the capacity of the heterotetrameric enzyme to bind substrates and effectors (6Hwang S.K. Hamada S. Okita T.W. Phytochemistry. 2007; 68: 464-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Substantial evidence for a catalytic role, albeit indirect, for the LS was obtained by identification of a substrate binding site for ATP by photoaffinity labeling studies with 8-N3-ATP (21Hwang S.K. Hamada S. Okita T.W. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6741-6748Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Mutations of selected residues located within ATP binding site of the LS significantly altered the catalytic properties of the AGPase heterotetramer.Based on homology studies of other structurally related sugar nucleotide pyrophosphorylases (22Brown K. Pompeo F. Dixon S. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4096-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 23Blankenfeldt W. Asuncion M. Lam J.S. Naismith J.H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 46319-46325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the metal-binding Asp143 (originally assigned as Asp145) of the potato AGPase SS was suggested to be essential for catalytic activity, a prediction verified by site-directed mutagenesis of this residue, which lowered catalytic rate more than four orders of magnitude compared with the wild-type enzyme. A similar mutation in the conserved Asp158 of the LS, however, reduced catalysis only 1.5- to 2.6-fold (19Frueauf J.B. Ballicora M.A. Preiss J. Plant J. 2003; 33: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our recent result, however, showed that the replacement of Asp158 by Leu lowered catalytic rates by 11-fold and catalytic efficiencies by 23- to 26-fold depending on the substrates of the enzyme (21Hwang S.K. Hamada S. Okita T.W. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6741-6748Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), indicating the Asp158 residue in the LS is important for enzyme catalysis. Interestingly, introduction of a single residue replacement, T51K, or double mutations, K41R and T51K, into the wild-type LS resurrected partially (5% of wild-type activity) the catalytic activity of the heterotetrameric enzyme containing the catalytic silenced SD143N (7Ballicora M.A. Dubay J.R. Devillers C.H. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10189-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Overall, these results, together with those obtained from earlier studies on substrate and effector binding, indicate that the LS is catalytically inefficient but has many of the necessary elements for this function.Although available evidence indicates that the LS, which is capable of binding substrates (6Hwang S.K. Hamada S. Okita T.W. Phytochemistry. 2007; 68: 464-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Fu Y. Ballicora M.A. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and effectors (25Ball K. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24706-24711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is catalytically defective, direct evidence for this property has yet to be obtained as all available evidence in support of this view is deduced from studies of the heterotetrameric enzyme forms. To further enhance our understanding of the role of LS in enzyme function, we identified a mutant LS containing a S302N replacement, which significantly elevated solubility of the LS and enabling assembly and formation of LS homotetramer. Results from biochemical and kinetic analysis of LS homotetramer and heterotetrameric forms with catalytic-silenced SD143N showed that the LS in the absence of SS displays very low catalytic activity and is allosteric-insensitive. When operating with the SS, however, catalysis by the LS is stimulated, and allosteric regulatory properties of the LS are unmasked.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[14C]Glucose 1-phosphate and [32P]pyrophosphate were purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals and PerkinElmer Life Sciences, respectively.

For high throughput expression of AGPase subunits E. coli EA3457 cell was made by transforming the pRARE plasmid isolated from Rosseta™ cell (Novagen) into EA345 cell. For purification of the SS homotetramer the His6-tagged SWT protein (26Hwang S.K. Salamone P.R. Kavakli H. Slattery C.J. Okita T.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 38: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was expressed in EA3457 cells. AGPases were purified as described previously using a Bio-Logic DuoFlow Chromatography system (Bio-Rad) (6Hwang S.K. Hamada S. Okita T.W.

Briefly, the active AGPase fractions obtained from a DEAE-Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences) chromatography and TALON™-IMAC (Clontech Lab) were subjected to POROS 20 HQ (PerSeptive Biosystems) column chromatography. Aliquots of the purified enzyme preparation were stored frozen in liquid nitrogen and shelved at –80 °C until used for analysis.AGPase Assay and Kinetics—AGPase activities were assayed in the pyrophosphorylase direction (Assay A) during enzyme purification and in the ADP-glucose synthesis direction (Assay B) for kinetic characterization (6Hwang S.K.

One enzyme unit is defined as 1 micromole of ATP (Assay A) or ADP-glucose (Assay B) formed for 1 min at 37 °C.

After neutralization with 400 μl of 1.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) the plasmid DNAs were then precipitated in 80% (v/v) ethanol. The plasmid DNAs were then used to transform E. coli EA345 cells expressing SSi. Cells were grown on NZCYM media supplemented with 100 mg/liter ampicillin and 50 mg/liter kanamycin with 0.4% (v/v) glycerol as the carbon source, which readily allows the efficient induced expression of both subunits from the lac promoters (6Hwang S.K.

After overnight culture at 37 °C, the bacterial colonies were screened for glycogen production by exposure to iodine vapor. Plasmid DNAs expressing the LS mutants were purified and were subjected to DNA sequencing to identify changes in nucleotide sequence.Site-directed mutagenesis of the AGPase subunit sequence was accomplished using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described previously (21Hwang S.K.

Coordinates for the AGPase structures (1yp3) were retrieved from RCSB Protein Data Bank. Pov-Ray was used for rendering the structure.Protein Analysis—Protein concentration was measured using the Advanced Protein Assay Reagent from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO) with bovine serum albumin (fraction V) as the standard.

Immunoblot analysis was performed using anti-potato AGPase LS or anti-potato AGPase SS as described before (6Hwang S.K. Hamada S. Okita T.W. Phytochemistry. 2007; 68: 464-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).RESULTSSubstitution of Ser302 with Asn in the LS Significantly Enhanced Glycogen Production in Bacterial Host Cells—To provide further insights on the role of the potato tuber LS in AGPase function, the expression plasmid DNA containing His6-tagged LK41R·T51K (abbreviated LRK) was subjected to chemical mutagenesis (supplemental Fig. S1A) and co-expressed with the catalytic-silenced SD143N (abbreviated SSi) mutant (7Ballicora M.A. Dubay J.R.

FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6741-6748Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) in bacterial cells lacking AGPase activity. These cells were then analyzed for glycogen production by exposure to iodine vapor. Under these conditions, cell expressing LWTSSi are devoid of glycogen and do not stain, whereas cells expressing LRKSSi enzyme stain lightly as they accumulate small but readily detectable levels of glycogen due to the low catalytic activity of this enzyme (supplemental Fig. S1B). More than 6 × 104 bacterial colonies derived from the mutagenized potato tuber AGPase LS were examined by iodine staining resulting in the identification of 26 colonies, which exhibited significantly enhanced glycogen accumulation (supplemental Fig. S1B). Interestingly, sequence analysis showed that all 26 LS sequences obtained from these excess glycogen accumulating cells contained a common third mutation, S302N, in addition to the pre-existing K41R and T51K mutations (for brevity, LS containing these three mutations will be denoted as LRKN). Six plasmids contained silent mutations in addition to S302N, whereas a single plasmid contained a fourth mutation V159I in LS. Thus, addition of S302N mutation in the LS enhances net AGPase activity which, in turn, increases glycogen production.The S302N Mutation Dramatically Increases LS Solubility—Heterotetrameric forms of the LRKSSi and mutant LRKNSSi enzymes were purified to near homogeneity (>95%) by multiple chromatography steps. During the final clean-up of the enzyme activity using a strong anion-exchange chromatography step, an anomalous protein elution profile was observed for the LRKNSSi enzyme. Typically, the wild-type AGPase elutes from the anion-exchange column as a single major protein peak at 0.3 m NaCl with very little protein eluting at lower salt concentrations (21Hwang S.K. Hamada S. Okita T.W. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6741-6748Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Similar elution profile was also observed for the LRKSSi enzyme (Fig. 1A). Although much of the LRKNSSi enzyme also eluted at 0.3 m NaCl, a prominent peak was also observed eluting at 0.15 m NaCl (peak a of Fig. 1A, lower panel). Results from SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis showed that the 0.15 m NaCl fraction contained only the LS (Fig. 1B), indicating that a significant amount of LRKN was unassembled with the SS and remained soluble throughout the enzyme purification steps. Analysis of the 0.15 m NaCl protein fraction by Superdex-200 gel filtration chromatography indicated that the LRKN eluted with a molecular size of 223 kDa (supplemental Fig. S2). Hence, the soluble LRKN readily self-assembles into a homotetrameric form. Further studies showed that the soluble LN also readily self-assembles into a 220 kDa oligomer (supplemental Fig. S2).S302N Mutation Is Responsible for the Enhanced Solubility and Formation of the Potato LS Homotetramer—To determine whether the Asn302 residue was responsible for the increase in solubility of the potato tuber LS we compared the total and soluble expression of various LSs containing or lacking this mutation. When expressed in E. coli cells alone without the SS counterpart, all of the various LS types were expressed at nearly equal levels when total cell extracts were examined by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S3A). When only the soluble fractions were examined, however, only the LS forms containing S302N were found at substantial levels while the same LS forms lacking S302N were present at very low levels indicating that the bulk of the expressed LS was insoluble (supplemental Fig. S3, B and C). Quantitative analysis of the soluble forms of the homotetramers after enzyme purification showed that LRKN and LN were 376- and 77-fold more soluble than LKR and wild-type L (LWT), respectively (supplemental Table S1). These observations indicate that introduction of an Asn residue at position 302 is responsible for the enhanced solubility of the potato tuber LS.The LS Homotetramer Is Not Affected by Allosteric Effectors—Examination of the enzymatic activity of purified LN homotetrameric protein showed that it had very low but measurable activity (∼0.4 unit/g). This activity was 93-fold less than that measured for the homotetramer SWT (37 units/g) when assayed in the absence of the activator 3-PGA (Table 1). AGPase activity was elevated >800-fold by the introduction of K41R and T51K substitutions into LN to yield LRKN (330 units/g).TABLE 1Regulatory properties of the AGPasesSubunit3-PGA, A0.5Specific activityLargeSmallNo 3-PGA3-PGAaSpecific activity was obtained at saturated concentrations of 3-PGA except that 0.5 mm 3-PGA was used to measure activity of LRKN and LN.ActivationbFold activation = maximal specific activity in the presence of saturated concentration of 3-PGA/specific activity in the absence of 3-PGA.μmnHunits/g-foldLRKSSi25 ± 1(0.8)63 ± 103,200 ± 4551LRKNSSi6 ± 1(0.9)48 ± 53,400 ± 16071LNSSi78 ± 17(0.7)0.4 ± 0.112 ± 130LRKN—n/ccn/c: non-calculable due to lack of activation by 3-PGA (LRKN) or very low enzyme activity (LN and SSi).(n/c)330 ± 12320 ± 31LN—n/c(n/c)0.4 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.11—SSin/c(n/c)<0.2<0.32—SWT10400 ± 380(1.0)37 ± 123,000 ± 1,600622LWTSSi90 ± 11(1.0)0.5 ± 0.113 ± 026LRKNSWT109 ± 15(1.2)292 ± 4955,300 ± 6,100189LNSWT89 ± 5(1.0)146 ± 851,000 ± 1,150349LWTSWT79 ± 2(1.0)149 ± 445,000 ± 1,290302a Specific activity was obtained at saturated concentrations of 3-PGA except that 0.5 mm 3-PGA was used to measure activity of LRKN and LN.b Fold activation = maximal specific activity in the presence of saturated concentration of 3-PGA/specific activity in the absence of 3-PGA.c n/c: non-calculable due to lack of activation by 3-PGA (LRKN) or very low enzyme activity (LN and SSi). Open table in a new tab To determine whether the relatively low catalytic activity of LN and LRKN homotetramers was due to its dependence on allosteric activation, the enzyme activity was assayed over a broad range of 3-PGA concentrations. Interestingly, unlike the allosteric behavior of the homotetrameric SWT, which requires nanomolar levels of 3-PGA for maximum activation, the catalytic activity of LRKN (or LN) was not affected by low amounts of 3-PGA and was slightly inhibited at 3-PGA levels of >1 mm (Fig. 2). Likewise, LRKN homotetramer activity was not affected by the metabolic inhibitor, Pi, in the presence of 0.5 mm 3-PGA (Fig. 3). Hence, these results indicate that the LRKN homotetramer is not allosterically regulated by 3-PGA or Pi. Other metabolites (0.5 mm each of 2-PGA, phosphoenol pyruvate, fructose 6-phosphate, fructose 1,6-diphosphate, and AMP) tested showed no discernible effects on enzyme activity of the LS homotetramer (supplemental Fig. S4).FIGURE 23-PGA activation profiles of the AGPase wild-type and mutants.

Interestingly, unlike the LN and LRKN homotetramers, which are not subject to allosteric activation by 3-PGA, LNSSi, LRKSSi, and LRKNSSi readily respond to this effector. Activity of LNSSi increased 30-fold in the presence of 3-PGA. LRKSSi and LRKNSSi showed a different activity pattern in the absence and presence of 3-PGA. Without 3-PGA, the activities of the heterotetramers LRKSSi and LRKNSSi were significantly lower (5- and 7-fold, respectively) than the LRKN homotetramer, whereas the presence of 3-PGA mediated a 51- to 71-fold increases in enzyme activities of these heterotetramers.The LS Mutant Homotetramer Is Catalytically Very Inefficient—The LRKN homotetramer showed significantly low affinity toward ATP and Glc 1-P compared with the heterotetrameric enzyme forms (Table 2). The S0.5 values for ATP were 1927 μm (nH = 1.9) in the presence of 0.5 mm 3-PGA and 1880 μm (nH = 1.6) in the absence of 3-PGA. The S0.5 values for Glc 1-P were 4307 or 4175 μm (nH = 1.3 or 1.4) in the presence or absence of 0.5 mm 3-PGA. When kinetic study was done in the pyrophosphorylase direction, similar trends in S0.5 values were obtained for ADP-glucose and PPi with the LRKN homotetramer having S0.5 values of 3- to 5-fold and 2- to 3-fold higher than LRKNSWT, respectively (Table 3). These results also indicate that the catalytic properties of the LS mutant are not affected by 3-PGA, and the LS mutant is less efficient at substrate binding than the enzyme forms containing SS.TABLE 2Catalytic properties of the various AGPases in the ADP-gluco"
https://openalex.org/W1990650937,"Eukaryotic type Ser/Thr protein kinases have recently been shown to regulate a variety of cellular functions in bacteria. PknA, a transmembrane Ser/Thr protein kinase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, when constitutively expressed in Escherichia coli resulted in cell elongation and therefore has been thought to be regulating morphological changes associated with cell division. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that PknA has N-terminal catalytic, juxtamembrane, transmembrane, and C-terminal extracellular domains, like known eukaryotic type Ser/Thr protein kinases from other bacteria. To identify the minimum region capable of exhibiting phosphorylation activity of PknA, we created several deletion mutants. Surprisingly, we found that the catalytic domain itself was not sufficient for exhibiting phosphorylation ability of PknA. However, the juxtamembrane region together with the kinase domain was necessary for the enzymatic activity and thus constitutes the catalytic core of PknA. Utilizing this core, we deduce that the autophosphorylation of PknA is an intermolecular event. Interestingly, the core itself was unable to restore the cell elongation phenotype as manifested by the full-length protein in E. coli; however, its co-expression along with the C-terminal region of PknA can associate them in trans to reconstitute a functional protein in vivo. Therefore, these findings argue that the transmembrane and extracellular domains of PknA, although dispensable for phosphorylation activities, are crucial in responding to signals. Thus, our results for the first time establish the significance of different domains in a bacterial eukaryotic type Ser/Thr kinase for reconstitution of its functionality.

Thus, our results for the first time establish the significance of different domains in a bacterial eukaryotic type Ser/Thr kinase for reconstitution of its functionality. Signal transduction in living organisms plays a pivotal role in controlling several aspects of cellular processes such as metabolism, cell growth, cell motility, cell division, and differentiation. These processes need to be tightly regulated to ensure signaling fidelity, and this synchronization in eukaryotes is mediated primarily through phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and/or tyrosine residues catalyzed by protein kinases. Although they exhibit similarities in their catalytic domains, different kinases may contain additional regions, allowing a multitude of mechanisms for their control. The role of these Ser/Thr or Tyr protein kinases in eukaryotic signal transduction is well established and widely documented (1Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholar). Considerably less is known about the prevalence and role of these protein kinases in bacteria and Archaea, where phosphorylation events are predominantly materialized by two-component His kinases along with response regulators, which do not share any sequence similarity with Ser/Thr or Tyr kinases (2West A.H. Stock A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 369-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). In fact, in the advent of genome sequencing, the presence of genes encoding eukaryotic type Ser/Thr protein kinases in diverse bacterial species raises the possibility of their indispensable involvement in complex network of signal transduction cascade. Although the phosphorylation of these bacterial kinases has been intensively established, the experimental proof of their physiological function and regulation is scarce. Thus, a detailed study of eukaryotic type kinases in bacteria is indeed essential to have insights on their contribution to signaling events. In this context, we focused on the dreadful pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis. The medical impact of tuberculosis (3Ginsberg A.M. Spigelman M. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), which infects nearly one-third of the world's human population causing considerable mortality annually, therefore provides the rationale for investigating these regulatory proteins in the signaling process.The genome of M. tuberculosis has unveiled the presence of a family of 11 eukaryotic type Ser/Thr kinases (4Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K.

Squares R. Squares S. Sulston J.E. Taylor K. Whitehead S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6450) Google Scholar). All of these kinases, except PknG and PknK, encode predicted receptors with a single transmembrane helix dividing the protein into N-terminal intracellular and C-terminal extracellular domains (5Av-Gay Y. Everett M. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 238-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Unlike most of the eukaryotes, the N terminus contains a kinase domain, which is linked to the transmembrane region through a variable length of juxtamembrane linker (6Greenstein A.E. Grundner C. Echols N. Gay L.M. Lombana T.N. Miecskowski C.A. Pullen K.E. Sung P. Alber T. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2005; 9: 167-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain outside the cell presumably binds signaling ligands and is attached to the transmembrane sequence. The architecture of these eukaryotic type kinases is very similar throughout bacteria and typical of receptor-like kinases in plants (7McCarty D.R. Chory J. Cell. 2000; 103: 201-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Majority of them (PknA, PknB, PknD, PknE, PknF, PknG, PknH PknI, and PknL) have been shown to catalyze autophosphorylation and substrates for few of them have been identified (8Koul A. Choidas A.K.

Besides, the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of PknB was solved, which provided valuable information regarding the regulatory mechanism of this kinase (19Ortiz-Lombardia M. Pompeo F.

Raje M. Chakraborti P.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our recent study with this kinase further indicated its association in regulating functionality of FtsZ, the protein involved in the process of cytokinesis (21Thakur M. Chakraborti P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40107-40113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, very little structural information of PknA is available as yet, which could aid in elaborative understanding of this kinase, especially the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of phosphorylation activity as such toward its functionality. In this study, we report the identification of the catalytic core of PknA, which is capable of autophosphorylation as well as substrate phosphorylation. We further demonstrate that the autophosphorylation is a bimolecular reaction. It occurs in trans and follows the universal activation mechanism like PknB. Interestingly, unlike PknB, the juxtamembrane region is the integral part of the kinase domain in constituting the catalytic core of PknA. However, for reconstituting the functionality of PknA, the catalytic core itself is not sufficient. Furthermore, we unambiguously establish here that the catalytic core together with transmembrane and C-terminal extracellular domains is critical for the PknA function. Thus, we provide here for the first time the experimental evidence toward functional significance of various domains of a mycobacterial eukaryotic type Ser/Thr kinase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Restriction/modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs.

Oligonucleotides used in this study were custom-synthesized (Biobasic Inc.). [γ-32P]ATP (3000-5000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Jonaki Laboratories, Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology, Hyderabad, India.Construction of Deletion and Point Mutants—Genomic DNA isolated from M. tuberculosis strain H37Ra was used for PCR amplification and subsequent cloning of the pknA gene (Rv0015c, ∼1.3 kb) in different vectors (pUC-PknA, pMAL-PknA, and p19Kpro-PknA) as described elsewhere (9Chaba R. Raje M. Chakraborti P.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The deletion mutants, like Δ23-33, Δ17-130, and Δ143-200, were created by restriction digestion (AgeI, PstI, and AatII) of pMAL-PknA, followed by re-ligating the backbone (see Fig. 1B). Other deletion mutants (Δ269-431, Δ278-431, Δ339-431, Δ1-252, and Δ1-338) were constructed employing PCR methods using specific primers (CACAGGAATTCCATATGAGCCCCCGAGTTGG/CACCAAGCTTTCAGGCGAACGGTCCCCCAC for Δ269-431; CACAGGAATTCCATATGAGCCCCCGAGTTGG/CCCAAGCTTTCAGCCGGCGCGCACC for Δ278-431; CACAGGAATTCCATATGAGCCCCCGAGTTGG/CACCCAAGCTTTCAACGCTGACCGGACGAAAAC for Δ339-431; CAACAGTATAGAATTCGTGAAGAACCCCGCGATG/CAACAGTATAGTCGACTCATTGCGCTATCTCGTATCG for Δ1-252; GGGAATTCGCGCTGCTCTGGGCCG/CCCAAGCTTTCATTGCGCTATCTCTATCGG for Δ1-338; all sequences are 5′ to 3′) and pMAL-PknA as the template. PCR amplified fragments (Δ269-431, Δ278-431, Δ339-431, and Δ1-252) were digested with EcoRI/HindIII and subcloned in pMAL-c2X. The deletion mutants Δ1-252 and Δ1-338, following digestion with EcoRI/SalI and EcoRI/HindIII, respectively, were subcloned at the corresponding sites of pGEX-KG. The Δ339-431 mutant was also subcloned in Mycobacterium-Escherichia coli shuttle vector (p19kpro-Core) for constitutive expression in E. coli following a similar strategy as described elsewhere (9Chaba R. Raje M. Chakraborti P.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Besides these, the deletion mutant, Δ1-252, was digested with EcoRI/SmaI and subcloned in pGEX-KG to obtain pGEX-253/363 (amino acids 253-363 of PknA) construct. The 363/431 (amino acids 363-431 of PknA) mutant, on the other hand, was obtained by digesting the full-length pUC-PknA with SmaI/BamHI followed by subcloning at corresponding sites of pGEX-KG.Two point mutants of PknA, T172A/T174A (threonine substituted with alanine at amino acid residues 172 and 174), were generated using Expand long template PCR system (mixture of Pwo and TaqDNA polymerases; Roche Applied Science) following overlap extension method (22Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar). For each mutation, two external (CATATGAGCCCCCGAGTTGG/TCATTGCGCTATCTCGTATCGG, all sequences are 5′ to 3′) and two internal primers (AGCGCCCGTGGCCCAGACC/GGTCTGGGCCACGGGCGCT for T172A; CGTGACCCAGGCCGGCATG/CATGCCGGCCTGGGTCACG for T174A, all sequences are 5′ to 3′ and underlined bases indicate mismatch) were used. To create mutations, two sets of primary (pMAL-PknA as the template) and one set of secondary (mixture of primary reaction products as the template) PCRs were carried out. PCR products containing desired mutations were digested with XhoI/XmaI and incorporated in the corresponding sites of pMAL-PknA. The kinase-dead mutant of PknA, p19kpro-K42N, described earlier (9Chaba R. Raje M. Chakraborti P.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), was also used in this study. The same mutation was also introduced in Δ339-431 mutant to obtain p19kpro-K42N-Core. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing using an automated DNA sequencer. All constructs and the wild type were transformed in E. coli strain DH5α to build up the DNA for further processing.Expression of Recombinant Proteins—Cells harboring MBP-PknA or different MBP fusion constructs were grown in LB broth at 37 °C and induced with 0.3 mm IPTG at A600 of 0.5. Cells were harvested after 3 h, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA containing 0.15 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin), and sonicated. The supernatant fraction was further loaded on an amylose column, and fusion protein was finally eluted with lysis buffer containing 10 mm maltose. For purification of PknA deletion mutants as GST fusion proteins, overnight cultures (∼15 h at 37 °C in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin) were reinoculated and grown to an A600 of ∼0.6. Cells were then induced with 0.4 mm IPTG, harvested after 3 h, and suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Cells were sonicated, and the supernatant fraction was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity column, and protein was eluted with lysis buffer containing 10 mm glutathione. For use as controls, in similar manner MBP-βgal/GST proteins were prepared and purified from E. coli cells transformed with vectors.Kinase Assay—The ability of autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation of PknA or its mutants as purified fusion proteins was determined in an in vitro kinase assay. Aliquots (usually 1 μg/20 μl reaction volume) of fusion protein were mixed with 1× kinase buffer (50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MnCl2), and the reaction was initiated by adding 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Following incubation at room temperature for 20 min, the reaction was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer (30 mm Tris·Cl, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, and 0.01% bromphenol blue). Samples were boiled for 5 min and resolved on 8-12.5% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried in a gel dryer (Bio-Rad) at 70 °C for 2 h, and analyzed in a phosphorimaging device (Molecular Imager FX, Bio-Rad) and also exposed to x-ray films (Eastman Kodak Co.).Co-transformation—E. coli (strain DH5α) cells were co-transformed with two incompatible plasmids, pMAL/pGEX-KG and p19Kpro, harboring different constructs. The presence of different antibiotic selections (ampicillin in pMAL/pGEX and hygromycin in p19Kpro) facilitated the co-expression of foreign proteins in E. coli using these incompatible plasmids (21Thakur M. Chakraborti P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40107-40113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 23Yang W. Zhang L. Lu Z. Tao W. Zhai Z. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 22: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The E. coli cells harboring pMAL or pGEX with gene(s) of interest were grown in the presence of ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and made competent using standard methods (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. 2nd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.82-1.84Google Scholar). The cells were then transformed with p19Kpro containing the desired gene(s) and plated on LB agar with both ampicillin (75 μg/ml) and hygromycin (200 μg/ml). Clones obtained were cultured in LB broth in the presence of both the antibiotics and induced with 0.2 mm IPTG (37 °C/3 h). Cells were further processed for microscopy or Western blotting.Western Blotting—Purified fusion proteins (∼800 ng) or samples obtained in co-transformation experiments were resolved in 8-10% SDS-PAGE and transferred at 250 mA for 45 min to nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 μm) in a mini-transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad) using Tris-glycine-SDS buffer (48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 0.037% SDS, and 20% methanol, pH ∼ 8.3). Primary antibodies (anti-MBP from New England Biolabs and anti-Thr(P) from Cell Signaling Technology) used for different immunoblots were either commercially available (New England Biolabs) or raised as mentioned elsewhere (9Chaba R. Raje M. Chakraborti P.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (GE Healthcare) was chosen depending on the primary antibody used and subsequently processed with the ECL detection system (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol.Pulldown Assay—Purified fusion proteins (GST-(253/363), GST-(363/431), GST-(Δ1-252) and MBP-Core; 100 μg of each protein/reaction) were mixed in 600 μl of binding buffer (200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA in 20 mm Tris·Cl, pH 8) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. This was followed by the binding reaction (1 h at 4 °C) in the presence of amylose beads (25 μl) and glutathione (final concentration of 10 mm to avoid nonspecific binding of GST to amylose resin). Following washing of beads (five times with binding buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20; 1 ml/wash), the resin-bound proteins were extracted and subsequently processed for Western blotting using anti-GST/anti-MBP antibody.Solid Phase Interaction Assay—The association between purified GST and MBP fusion proteins was identified by solid phase interaction assay as described elsewhere (20Young T.A. Delagoutte B. Endrizzi J.A. Falick A.M. Alber T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified MBP-Core after dialysis against PBS was incubated (2 h at 25 °C with gentle mixing) with 10-fold molar excess of biotin-NHS. The mixture was extensively dialyzed and used as a source of biotinylated protein after estimation (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213510) Google Scholar). For binding studies, different GST constructs (GST-(253/363), GST-(363/431), and GST-(Δ1-252); 1 μg/well) were coated in microtiter plates for 3 h at 37 °C. Following washing with PBS containing 0.5% Tween (PBS-T), the wells were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS-T for 1 h at 37 °C. After extensive washing with PBS-T, the wells were incubated (1 h at 37 °C) with different concentrations of biotinylated MBP-Core. The interaction was finally monitored by addition of streptavidin-HRP (1 μg/ml for 30 min at 37 °C), and enzyme activity in each well was detected using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine as the substrate. Binding of biotinylated core with immobilized Δ1-252 was assessed in the presence of different concentrations of nonbiotinylated Δ1-252 to determine the specificity of the interaction. In each case, for controls instead of fusion proteins an equivalent amount of BSA was adsorbed to the wells of microtiter plates.Bioinformatic Analysis—The multiple sequence alignment of the protein sequences retrieved from the mail server at the National Institutes of Health was carried out using the ClustalX1.81 program (26Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35214) Google Scholar). Secondary structure of the protein was predicted using PSIPRED server (27McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2665) Google Scholar), and for tertiary structure prediction an automated protein homology-modeling server “Swiss Model” was used (28Schwede T. Koppl J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4425) Google Scholar). Using LSQMAN (Least Square Manipulation; see Ref. 29Sierk M.L. Kleywegt G.J. Structure (Lond.). 2004; 12: 2103-2111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the predicted structure of PknA was superimposed with that of the PknB structure, which has been complexed with nucleotide triphosphate analog. For 260 Cα atoms the root mean square deviation was 0.47 Å. The superimposed structure was generated using PyMOL (30DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA1998Google Scholar).Microscopy—E. coli (strain DH5α) cells transformed/cotransformed with different plasmid constructs (p19kpro-Core, pMAL-253/363, pMAL-363/431, and pMAL-Δ1-252) were reinoculated at an initial A600 of 0.05 and grown further for 12 h. Because there was leaky expression of the MBP fusion proteins (pMAL-253/363, pMAL-363/431, and pMAL-Δ1-252), the cultures were not induced with IPTG. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and subjected to fixation with ethanol after washing with PBS. The fixed cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS. The cells were spread on polyl-lysine-coated glass slides and examined under microscope (Carl Zeiss) following staining with 1% methylene blue solution.RESULTSKinase Domain Together with the Juxtamembrane Region Constitutes the Catalytic Core of PknA—Analysis of the nucleotide-derived amino acid sequence of PknA indicated the presence of a highly conserved catalytic domain, followed immediately by a juxtamembrane region rich in alanine and proline. The juxtamembrane region leads to a hydrophobic stretch of 23 amino acids constituting the putative transmembrane and the C-terminal extracellular domain. On aligning the sequence with PknB, another mycobacterial Ser/Thr kinase located adjacent to the PknA in the genome and with known crystal structure, the catalytic domain was found to be highly homologous (∼78% homology with ∼42% identity). Furthermore, the predicted secondary structure (using “PSIPRED” server) and the modeled tertiary structure of PknA (using the “Swiss-Model”) catalytic domain revealed a remarkably high similarity with PknB. However, the homology between the juxtamembrane regions of these two kinases was considerably less (∼47% homology with ∼15% identity) (Fig. 1A). Because the catalytic domain in PknB is sufficient for autophosphorylation as well as substrate phosphorylation (31Duran R. Villarino A. Bellinzoni M. Wehenkel A. Fernandez P. Boitel B. Cole S.T. Alzari P.M. Cervenansky C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 858-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), it was intriguing to know whether the catalytic domain alone of PknA could perform a similar function. To have insight on this aspect, several deletion mutations were constructed as outlined in Fig. 1B. The deletion mutants were purified as MBP fusion proteins, and expression was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with the rabbit polyclonal antisera against MBP-PknA (Fig. 1C, upper panel). The autophosphorylating status of the deletion mutants was analyzed by an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 1C, middle panel) and further confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-Thr(P) antibody (Fig. 1C, lower panel). On analyzing the kinase activity, we found that only the Δ339-431 deletion mutant of PknA harboring the catalytic domain and juxtamembrane region retained the autophosphorylating ability. However, unlike PknB, further shortening of this domain (Δ269-431) by deleting the putative juxtamembrane region completely abolished the kinase activity (Fig. 1C, middle panel). This observation was further supported by the fact that anti-phosphothreonine antibody recognized only the Δ339-431 protein among all mutants and MBPβ-galactosidase control (Fig. 1C, lower panel). Thus our results argue that the catalytic domain along with the juxtamembrane region (residues 1-338) are required for PknA autophosphorylation, and hereafter we designate the mutant as the “core” of PknA.The boundary of the catalytic domain was identified on the basis of primary sequence alignment. However, on careful analysis of the predicted secondary structure and tertiary structures of PknA, using PknB as template, it was found that the Δ269-431 deletion construct missed more than half of the α1 helix, which has been found to be involved in a four-helix bundle in PknB (20Young T.A. Delagoutte B. Endrizzi J.A. Falick A.M. Alber T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 2A, the superimposed structure of PknA with PknB highlights the presence of a helix (αI) toward the end of the catalytic domain. The boundary of the helix was further marked by analyzing the predicted secondary structure of PknA (Fig. 2A, inset), and it extended to VRAG (ending at residue 277) corresponding to VHNG (ending at residue 279) in PknB (Fig. 1A). Therefore, to analyze the role of this region in the activity of PknA, another deletion mutant, Δ278-431 (retaining the helix), was constructed. The mutant was tested for its autophosphorylation ability by in vitro kinase assay as well as immunoblotting with anti-Thr(P) antibody. As shown in Fig. 2B, no incorporation of γ-32P occurred even with 10 μg of the Δ278-431 mutant; however, 2.5 μg of the Δ339-431 mutant (core) exhibited phosphorylation (compare lanes 2, 4, and 6). This observation was further supported by immunoblotting anti-Thr(P) antibody, which did not recognize the Δ278-431 mutant (Fig. 2C, lane 2). These observations thus established that, unlike PknB, the catalytic domain alone was insufficient for phosphorylation in PknA.FIGURE 2Model of PknA catalytic domain superimposed on PknB. A, amino acid residues 1-273 of PknA modeled using Swiss-Prot were superimposed on the structure of PknB (residues 1-279).

https://openalex.org/W2090284543,"We investigated whether adipose-derived adult stromal (ADAS) are of neural crest origin and the extent to which Notch 1 regulates their growth and differentiation. Mouse ADAS cells cultured in media formulated for neural stem cells (NSC) displayed limited capacity for self-renewal, clonogenicity, and neurosphere formation compared to NSC from the subventricular zone in the hippocampus. Although ADAS cells expressed Nestin, GFAP, NSE and Tuj1 in vitro, exposure to NSC differentiation supplements did not induce mature neuronal marker expression. In contrast, in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) media, ADAS cells retained their ability to proliferate and differentiate beyond 20 passages and expressed high levels of Nestin. In neuritizing cocktails, ADAS cells extended processes, downregulated Nestin expression, and displayed depolarization-induced Ca(2+) transients but no spontaneous or evoked neural network activity on Multi-Electrode Arrays. Deletion of Notch 1 in ADAS cell cultures grown in NSC proliferation medium did not significantly alter their proliferative potential in vitro or the differentiation-induced downregulation of Nestin. Co-culture of ADAS cells with fibroblasts that stably expressed the Notch ligand Jagged 1 or overexpression of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) did not alter ADAS cell growth, morphology, or cellular marker expression. ADAS cells did not display robust expression of neural crest transcription factors or genes (Sox, CRABP2, and TH); and lineage tracing analyses using Wnt1-Cre;Rosa26R-lacZ or -EYFP reporter mice confirmed that fewer than 2% of the ADAS cell population derived from a Wnt1-positive population during development. In summary, although media formulations optimized for MSCs or NSCs enable expansion of mouse ADAS cells in vitro, we find no evidence that these cells are of neural crest origin, that they can undergo robust terminal differentiation into functionally mature neurons, and that Notch 1 is likely to be a key regulator of their cellular and molecular characteristics."

Approximately 194 million people worldwide, or 5.1%, in the age group 20–79 were estimated to have diabetes in 2003. This estimate is expected to increase to some 333 million, or 6.3% of the adult population, by 2025 (1Gan D.E. 3rd Ed. Diabetes Atlas. International Diabetes Federation, Brussels, Belgium2007Google Scholar). Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of diabetes is characterized by defects in insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and elevated hepatic glucose production. Both increased gluconeogenesis and increased glycogenolysis contribute to excessive hepatic glucose output despite hyperglycemia (2DeFronzo R.A. Ann. Intern. Med. 1999; 131: 281-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Several novel pharmacological strategies are aiming to treat hyperglycemia by normalizing or increasing depleted glycogen stores (3Cohen P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). For example, drug discovery has focused on competitive as well as allosteric inhibition of glycogen phosphorylase activity (4Henke B.R. Sparks S.M. Mini. Rev. Med. Chem. 2006; 6: 845-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Glycogen phosphorylase (GP) 2The abbreviations used are: GPglycogen phosphorylaseGLglycogen targeting subunit of PP1PP1protein phosphatase 1SPAscintillation proximity assayhlGPhuman liver GPBES2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid. is an important allosteric enzyme in carbohydrate metabolism that catalyzes phosphorolysis of an α-1,4-glycosidic bond of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate. In humans there are three GP isoforms (liver, muscle, and brain GP), which are named after the tissues where they are predominantly expressed. Glycogen phosphorylase is a homodimer that cycles between two conformations: active (R) and inactive (T) state. Phosphorylation of Ser14 by phosphorylase kinase and active site as well as allosteric binders modulate the equilibrium between both states (5Johnson L.N. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2274-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), but the isozymes differ in their responsiveness to regulatory mechanisms. In the liver, phosphorylation is the major regulator of GP activation. Conversion of unphosphorylated liver GPb to phosphorylated GPa fully activates the enzyme. AMP stimulates liver GPb by 10–20%, whereas it does not further activate GPa (6Kobayashi M. Soman G. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14041-14047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, AMP activates the unphosphorylated muscle isoform to 80% of the maximal activity and increases the activity of phosphorylated muscle GPa by a further 10%. Crystallographic studies have shown endogenous and synthetic modulators bound to four major sites (see Fig. 1a): active site (7Rath V.L. Ammirati M. LeMotte P.K. Fennell K.F. Mansour M.N.

Important for glycogen metabolism is the strong reciprocal control between GPa and glycogen synthase activity. Activation of glycogen synthase via its phosphatase (protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)) can be allosterically inhibited by binding of GPa (12Alemany S. Cohen P.

Glycogen targeting subunits bind to PP1, modulate its activity toward substrates, localize it to specific cellular sites, and are proposed to function as a scaffold for the assembly and regulation of glycogen metabolizing enzymes. There is an increasing number of glycogen-targeting subunits. So far, seven family members of glycogen-targeting subunits are described in humans: GM (PPP1R3A) (14Chen Y.H. Hansen L. Chen M.X.

Bioessays. 2002; 24: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of the rat liver targeting subunit GL has identified three separate regions that are responsible for binding to PP1 (residues 59–94), glycogen (residues 94–257), and phosphorylase a (residues 269–284 at the GL C terminus) (21Armstrong C.G. Doherty M.J. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The GL C-terminal region is unique in GL and absent in other glycogen targeting subunits but is conserved between rodent and human. Pharmacological inhibition of the interaction of phosphorylase a with GL could provide a novel mechanism to lower blood glucose levels by inducing the dephosphorylation and activation of glycogen synthase (3Cohen P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Here we show that the GL C-terminal region structurally and functionally mimics AMP binding to human liver glycogen phosphorylase (hlGP). Using x-ray crystallography we identify the C terminus of GL bound in the allosteric regulator site of hlGP. Using functional assays we map binding contributions of the GL peptide and show that it activates phosphorylase b, in vitro. Protein Production—Human liver glycogen phosphorylase was prepared as described (7Rath V.L. Ammirati M. LeMotte P.K. Fennell K.F. Mansour M.N. Danley D. sE. Hynes T.R. Schulte G.K. Wasilko D.J.

Briefly, full-length hlGPa was expressed in insect cells and purified using copper-chelating, anion exchange, and size exclusion chromatography. hlGPb was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified analogously. Crystallization and Structure Determination—Crystals were obtained at 20 °C in 1 + 1 μl hanging drops from hlGPa concentrated to 8 mg/ml in 20 mm BES, pH 6.7, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm glucose, 0.5 mm AMP over a reservoir of 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5, 7–8% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000. Macroseeding improved crystal size and reproducibility. The GL complex was obtained by soaking crystals for 24 h in reservoir supplemented with 1 mm GL-Cterm peptide (see below). For cryoprotection the mother liquor was incrementally exchanged to 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5, 20% glycerol, 20% polyethylene glycol 8000, 1 mm GL-Cterm peptide. The crystals were then flash frozen in a 100 K nitrogen stream. The diffraction data were collected on the PX-1 beamline at the SLS (Villigen, CH) and processed with XDS (22Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3243) Google Scholar) (see Table 1). The complex structure was solved using difference Fourier methods with the coordinates of hlGPa-AMP (Protein Data Bank accession code 1FA9) as a template. Following rigid body refinement the (Fo – Fc)αcalc maps included easily interpretable electron density for the bound ligand. Restrained refinement was performed with REFMAC (23Murshudov G.N.

The final model has been completed to residues 4–838 of hlGPa, residues 281–284 of GL, and 154 water molecules. 98.5% of residues are in the most favored and additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, and 0.3% are in disallowed regions. Several regions were not well defined in the final electron density and are omitted from the final model (residues 162–165, 251–262, 282–285, and 317–322).

The sequence of the 16mer GL C-terminal peptide is NH2-PEWPSYLGYEKLGPYY-COOH (Gl-Cterm). A biotin-labeled 17-mer GL-peptide, biotin-FPEW-PSYLGYEKLGPYY-COOH (GL probe) was synthesized by Interactiva (Ulm, Germany). SPA Assay for GL/hlGPa Interaction—A SPA was used to measure the interaction between 33P-radiolabeled hlGPa and a biotin-labeled GL-peptide (GL probe). A one-step phosphorylation reaction by phosphorylase kinase (Sigma) transformed hlGPb into 33P-radiolabeled hlGPa. The incubation reaction contained test compound, 5 μgof 33P-hlGPa, 50 pmol of GL probe, 0.4 mg SPA-Beads (streptavidin-SPA beads; Amersham Biosciences, RPNQ 0007) in test buffer (50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5)/well in a 384-well format. Scintillation was measured after overnight incubation at room temperature. Triplicate determinations were made in all of the binding experiments. rmGPb Activation Assay—Activation of enzymatic activity of rabbit muscle glycogen phosphorylase b (rmGPb from Sigma) was measured in direction of glycogen degradation by coupling glucose-1-phosphate production to NADP consumption (25Serrano F.S.J. Lopez J.L.S. Martin O.G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Activation experiments were performed as triplicate determinations. All of the reagents and enzymes were purchased from Sigma. Structure of GL Bound to hlGPa—To identify the molecular basis of GL binding, we diffused a peptide comprising the last 16 residues of GL (Gl-Cterm, 269GL-284GL; numbering refers to the sequence of rat GL) into crystals of hlGPa and determined the crystal structure of the resulting hlGPa-GL complex (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Only the terminal four amino acids (residues 281GL–284GL, Gly-Pro-Tyr-Tyr) were visible in difference electron density maps (Fig. 2A), whereas the remainder of the peptide was disordered. The GL-binding site is located at the subunit interface and overlaps with the binding site for the allosteric regulator AMP (Fig. 2C). The binding site is ∼14 Å from the Ser14 phosphorylation site, 32 Å from the catalytic site, and 25 Å from the central cavity where the allosteric inhibitor CP-403700 binds (9Rath V.L. Ammirati M. Danley D.E. Ekstrom J.L. Gibbs E.M. Hynes T.R. Mathiowetz A.M. McPherson R.K. Olson T.V. Treadway J.L. Hoover D.J. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 677-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The allosteric site is lined by helices α2 and α8, and a short strand, β7, and is closed by the cap′ region (residues 36′-47′; the prime symbol refers to residues from the second chain of the homodimer) from the other subunit. GL binds in an U-shaped, hydrophobically collapsed conformation where it exploits numerous polar and hydrophobic contacts to hlGPa (Fig. 2, A and B). The GL peptide protrudes deep into the pocket, and 78% (542 Å2) of its total solvent-accessible surface becomes buried upon binding. The terminal carboxylate group mimics the AMP phosphate by addressing an arginine-rich region that also comprises the binding site for the allosteric effector phosphate. The Tyr284GL side chain points into the ribose binding region, where it forms hydrophobic contacts to Trp67, Gln71, Tyr75, and Val45′ and a strong hydrogen bond to Asp42′. Tyr283GL protrudes into a region that is not contacted by AMP. Its phenol group is incorporated in a hydrogen bonding network with Asp306 and Arg242. We further observe an edge-to-face interaction with Phe196 and stacking of the phenol ring against the Arg309 guanidinium group. The pyrrolidine of Pro282GL is packed through hydrophobic stacking interactions between the two subunits: the phenolic side chain of Tyr75 from subunit A and two residues from the subunit B cap region (carbonyl oxygen of Asn44′ and CG2 of Val45′). In this it partially mimics the stacking interactions of the AMP adenine between Tyr75 and Asn44′ (Fig. 2C). With Gly281GL, the GL peptide leaves the pocket and protrudes into the solvent. The last notable interaction is a van der Waals' contact of its carbonyl oxygen to Cβ of Ala313. Conformational Changes—Prior to soaking with GL, hlGPa was crystallized in the active, AMP-bound conformation (7Rath V.L. Ammirati M. LeMotte P.K. Fennell K.F. Mansour M.N. Danley D. sE. Hynes T.R. Schulte G.K. Wasilko D.J. Pandit J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and on the subunit level there are no large conformational changes upon GL binding. The backbone atoms of hlGP-GL and hlGP-AMP align with an root mean square deviation of 0.48 Å. However, the side chains of three residues undergo local reorganization to accommodate the Tyr283GL phenol (Phe196 and Arg309) or adapt to the terminal carboxylic acid (Tyr155). Moreover, there is a subtle change in quaternary structure as the two subunits rotate ∼2° toward each other (not shown). Within the allosteric pocket this translates to a 0.7-Å shift of the cap′ loop (Fig. 2C) to improve contacts to Pro282GL. Phosphorylase a is a potent allosteric inhibitor of the PP1-GL complex (12Alemany S. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1986; 198: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Armstrong C.G. Doherty M.J. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), whereas the inactive phosphorylase b is not (12Alemany S. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1986; 198: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To address the molecular basis of this finding we compared hlGPa-GL to a complex with the inhibitor N-acetyl-β-d-glucopyranosylamine (hlGPa-GlcNac), which defines the inactive (T state) conformation (7Rath V.L. Ammirati M. LeMotte P.K. Fennell K.F. Mansour M.N. Danley D. sE. Hynes T.R. Schulte G.K. Wasilko D.J. Pandit J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Upon inhibitor binding the subunits rotate “outward” by ∼7°, and the dimer interface (including the allosteric site) is remodeled (Fig. 2D). Consequently, several interactions that stabilize the GL complex are lost (for example: cap′ interactions, stacking with Tyr75, hydrogen bond to Tyr155) or would lead to steric conflicts (for example: Arg309, Phe196, and Asp306). Functional Analysis of GL Recognition by Glycogen Phosphorylase—After solving the complex structure, we sought to elucidate the determinants that are crucial for conferring binding potency. We developed a SPA to measure the competitive binding of a biotinylated GL peptide to 33P-labeled hlGPa. The dissociation constant (KD) for the interaction of the GL peptide with hlGP was determined from a saturation binding curve (Fig. 3A) to be 145 nm. Next, we measured the competitive displacement of the GL probe through several peptide variants as well as AMP. Representative binding curves for the displacement of the GL probe by Gl-Cterm and AMP are shown in Fig. 3B. The apparent IC50 values of the different peptides (Table 2) allow an assessment of the relative importance of individual amino acids for binding. We find that the hexa- to tetrapeptides inhibit the hlGPa-GL interaction in a similar range as the complete Gl-Cterm. This is in agreement with the structure, because residues 269GL–280GL are not ordered and therefore are not supposed to contribute strongly to binding. An approximately 8-fold drop in affinity is observed once truncation includes Gly281GL, and no binding could be detected when only the two terminal tyrosines were probed. Likewise, mutation of either tyrosine to alanine or truncation of Tyr284GL was deleterious for binding. Again, this is in good agreement to the numerous contacts these residues involve in the structure. AMP is not a good competitor and inhibits the hlGPa-GL interaction only with an IC50 of 21 μm, roughly 10 times weaker than Gl-Cterm.TABLE 2Functional analysis of ligand bindingLigandGL displacement (IC50)aThe values are the means of three independent measurements unless noted otherwise.

Open table in a new tab We then tested the ability of GL derivatives to activate the inactive rabbit muscle phosphorylase b (rmGPb; Table 2) and compared it with AMP-induced activation (6Kobayashi M. Soman G. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14041-14047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, GL peptides are able to activate rmGPb. Activation through Gl-Cterm matches that of AMP at 30 μm, which represents a maximally active concentration. Also the three shorter, tightly binding peptides still activate rmGPb between 20 and 30%. GL as an AMP Mimic—In vitro binding studies have shown that AMP is able to inhibit the specific interaction between phosphorylase a and recombinant GL protein (15Doherty M.J. Moorhead G. Morrice N. Cohen P. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The structural analysis of the GPa-GL complex revealed that the very C terminus of GL binds in an AMP-competitive fashion, mimicking many of the nucleotides interactions. Additional contacts (mostly provided by Tyr283GL) result in a 10-fold tighter binding compared with AMP. The improved potency might be necessary to counterbalance the high cellular AMP levels. Phosphorylase itself can accommodate GL smoothly, without undergoing any larger conformational changes. A structural comparison between active and inactive states of hlGP explains why the latter cannot directly accommodate GL and consequently is not effective as an inhibitor of PP1 (12Alemany S. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1986; 198: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, GL peptides are able to activate muscle GPb. Because GL cannot directly bind to GPb in its inactive (T state) conformation, we propose that the peptide acts analogous to AMP (5Johnson L.N. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2274-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and shifts the equilibrium between active and inactive conformations toward the R state. The hlGP-GL Interface as a Drug Target—Inhibiting the interaction of phosphorylase a and GL has the potential to block the allosteric inhibition of the PP1/GL activity on glycogen synthase by phosphorylase a. It has been hypothesized that a stimulation of the glycogen synthase pathway via pharmacological dissociation of phosphorylase a from GL could help to normalize hyperglycemia (3Cohen P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We identified the AMP site as a high affinity binding site for GL. Our data indicate that it might be feasible to antagonize binding of GL protein to GPa with small molecules. Because in humans GL is expressed in liver and muscle cells, glycogen synthesis might be activated in both tissues. Increasing GL activity by overexpression was found in cultured primary human myotubes (26Montori-Grau M. Guitart M. Lerin C. Andreu A.L. Newgard C.B. Garcia-Martinez C. Gomez-Foix A.M. Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) as well as in primary hepatocytes (27Gasa R. Jensen P.B. Berman H.K. Brady M.J. Paoli-Roach A.A. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26396-26403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) to stimulate glycogen synthase activity and to exhibit a high glycogenic effect. The effects of increasing activity of different glycogen targeting subunits by hepatic overexpression have also been studied in animal models (28Gasa R. Clark C. Yang R. Paoli-Roach A.A. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1524-1530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29Yang R. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23418-23425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Despite the profound effects of hepatic GL overexpression on glycogen stores in the livers of these animal models, no or only modest and transient effects on hyperglycemia are reported. This is in contrast to the improved glycemic situation following the expression of GMΔC, a truncated version of the muscle-targeting subunit in diabetic rats. The difference was explained by a larger increment in hepatic glycogen storage under oral glucose tolerance test with GMΔC overexpression than with GL overexpression. Higher glycogen stores even in the fasted state following GL overexpression were discussed as indicative for reduced glycogenolytic sensitivity. Therefore, the potential in vivo profile of an inhibitor of GL binding to GP with respect to effects on glycogenic and glycogenolytic pathways is hard to predict. It is clear that our small peptides might not exhibit the ideal profile, because they behave like AMP with respect to rmGPb activation. Increasing GP activity might counterbalance the stimulation of glycogen synthesis, thus neutralizing potential beneficial effects. Therefore, drug development strategies should aim for compounds lacking GP activating properties.

https://openalex.org/W2035715360,"Makorin-2 belongs to the makorin RING zinc finger gene family, which encodes putative ribonucleoproteins. Here we cloned the Xenopus makorin-2 (mkrn2) and characterized its function in Xenopus neurogenesis. Forced overexpression of mkrn2 produced tadpoles with dorso-posterior deficiencies and small-head/short-tail phenotype, whereas knockdown of mkrn2 by morpholino antisense oligonucleotides induced double axis in tadpoles. In Xenopus animal cap explant assay, mkrn2 inhibited activin, and retinoic acid induced animal cap neuralization, as evident from the suppression of a pan neural marker, neural cell adhesion molecule. Surprisingly, the anti-neurogenic activity of mkrn2 is independent of the two major neurogenesis signaling cascades, BMP-4 and Wnt8 pathways. Instead, mkrn2 works specifically through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt-mediated neurogenesis pathway. Overexpression of mkrn2 completely abrogated constitutively active PI3K- and Akt-induced, but not dominant negative glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β)-induced, neural cell adhesion molecule expression, indicating that mkrn2 acts downstream of PI3K and Akt and upstream of GSK-3β.

To date, nine MKRN family loci scattered throughout the human genome have been identified (1Gray T.A. Hernandez L. Carey A.H. Schaldach M.A. Smithwick M.J. Rus K. Marshall Graves J.A. Stewart C.L. Nicholls R.D. Genomics. 2000; 66: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The most studied member of this family is makorin-1 gene (MKRN1), which was recently documented to modulate telomere length homeostasis (2Kim J.H. Park S.M. Kang M.R. Oh S.Y. Lee T.H. Muller M.T. Chung I.K. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription (3Omwancha J. Zhou X.F. Chen S.Y. Baslan T. Fisher C.J. Zheng Z.

MKRN1 is widely transcribed in mammals, particularly in murine embryonic nervous system and adult testis (1Gray T.A. Hernandez L. Carey A.H. Schaldach M.A. Smithwick M.J. Rus K. Marshall Graves J.A.

We had previously identified a new gene makorin-2 (MKRN2), formerly designated as HSPC070, from human CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (4Zhang Q.H. Ye M. Wu X.Y. Ren S.X. Zhao M. Zhao C.J.

Genomics. 2001; 77: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the function of MKRN2 remains elusive. Here we report the cloning of the Xenopus ortholog of human MKRN2 (mkrn2) and the characterization of its functions in Xenopus neurogenesis. In both gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies, we showed that dysregulation of mkrn2 produced morphological defects in neural development. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we employed animal cap (AC) explant culture system to examine the effect of mkrn2 on the expression of a key neural marker, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) (6Kintner C.R. Melton D.A. Development (Camb.). 1987; 99: 311-325PubMed Google Scholar). Xenopus AC is a unique model system for studying neural and mesodermal induction as it is capable of giving rise to either neural or mesodermal tissues in the presence of suitable inducers. We showed that forced expression of mkrn2 could inhibit activin- and retinoic acid-induced AC neuralization and NCAM expression. In contrast, knockdown of mkrn2 by morpholino antisense oligonucleotide led to enhanced neuralization and NCAM induction. To our surprise, mkrn2 is not involved in the two major neurogenesis signaling cascades, BMP-4 and Wnt8. Instead, it works specifically and exclusively in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/GSK-3β-mediated neurogenesis pathway we previously reported (7Peng Y. Jiang B.H. Yang P.H. Cao Z. Shi X. Lin M.C. He M.L. Kung H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28509-28514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cloning of mkrn2—The cDNA encoding mkrn2 was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using the primer pair: 5′-ATG AGT CCC AAG CAG GTG ACG TGC A-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGG AAC TCC CTG CAC CCT TTA ACT G-3′ (reverse). Total RNA isolated from Xenopus oocytes was used as template. The PCR product was ligated into PCR 3.1 vector, double-digested with restriction endonucleases (SmaI and StuI), and then subcloned into pSP64TS plasmid. The cDNA sequence of mkrn2 was deposited in GenBank™ (accession number EF626804). Design of Morpholino Antisense Oligonucleotides—Two separate 25-mer morpholinos (Gene Tools LLC, Philomath, OR) were designed based on the cDNA sequence of mkrn2: MOa, 5′-TGC ACG TCA CCT GCT TGG GAC TCA T-3′, and MOb, 5′-CTG CAC GTC ACC TGC TTG GGA CTC A-3′. Embryo Microinjection and Animal Cap Assay—Xenopus embryos obtained by artificial insemination were cultured as described previously (7Peng Y. Jiang B.H. Yang P.H. Cao Z. Shi X. Lin M.C. He M.L. Kung H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28509-28514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Embryos were staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (8Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin). Garland Publishing, New York1994: 162-188Google Scholar). Embryos at two-cell stage were injected with various mRNAs and morpholinos in the animal poles. For microinjection at four-cell stage, mkrn2 sense RNA and morpholinos were injected into the two blastomeres at the dorsal marginal zone (DMZ) and ventral marginal zone (VMZ), respectively. Injected embryos were maintained up to stage 33 in 30% Marc's modified Ringer's solution for morphological observations. In case of AC assay, ACs were dissected at stages 8.5–9 from two-cell stage injected embryos and cultured at 22 °C in 67% Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Invitrogen) with 7 mm Tris-HCI (pH 7.5) and gentamicin (50 μg/ml), in the presence or absence of retinoic acid (10-5 m) and activin (10 ng/ml). For each experiment, eight ACs were pooled at stage 22 for RT-PCR or Western blot analysis. Antibodies and Immunoblotting—A peptide composed of 20 amino acids at the C-terminal end of mkrn2 (EVGKLGELFMHLSGADRGTP) was used to generate polyclonal antibodies in rabbits (Boster Co., Wuhan, China). For Western blot analysis, embryos were homogenized in solution of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Protein extracts were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane followed by immunoblotting analysis. RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR amplification was performed using SuperScript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). Primer sets and PCR conditions for elongation factor 1α (EF-1α) (27 cycles), NCAM (29 cycles), OTX2 (29 cycles), HoxB9 (30 cycles), and En2 (28 cycles) have already been described (9Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Melton D.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 273-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 10Umbhauer M. Penzo-Mendez A. Clavilier L. Boucaut J. Riou J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2865-2875PubMed Google Scholar). For each RT-PCR primer pair, a pilot experiment was done to determine the linear amplification range. Then the optimal cycle number was chosen as the approximate midpoint of the linear range. The forward and reverse primer pairs for mkrn2, Krox20, and GSK-3β were as follows: mkrn2, 5′-AAG AGA TGT CGC CCG TAC TCA G-3′ and 5′-GGC AGT AGG TGT GGT TAC AGT TGG-3′; Krox20, 5′-CTA CCT CCA GAA GAT GAG ACT C-3′ and 5′-GGA GCC ACT GCC TTC GTA ATC G-3′; GSK-3β, 5′-AGA AAT GAA CCC CAA CTA CAC-3′ and 5′-GAT GAG AAT TGA GGA GAG AGA A-3′. PCR conditions for mkrn2, Krox20, and GSK-3β were as follows: 15 min at 95 °C followed by 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C (or 60 °C for mkrn2), and 1 min at 72 °C for 29 cycles (or 30 cycles for Krox20). PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on 1% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel. The band intensity was quantitated by ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare) and summarized as mean value with standard error. Statistical Analysis—All RT-PCR and Western blot results were confirmed by three independent experiments, in which only the representative bands were shown. Differences, as compared with control, were considered to be statistically significant at p < 0.05 in two-tailed Student's t test (GraphPad Prism 3.0, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). We also performed analysis of variance to determine the statistical significance between the mRNA levels of different treatment groups. Differences were established at 95% confidence interval. Ectopic Overexpression of mkrn2 in Xenopus Embryos Produced Tadpoles with Dorso-posterior Deficiencies—To explore the role of mkrn2 during Xenopus embryonic development, we conducted both gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies by microinjecting into the two animal poles of two-cell stage embryos with mkrn2 sense RNA (mkrn2(s)) and two morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (MOa and MOb) that specifically suppressed the translation of endogenous mkrn2. By Western blotting analysis using polyclonal antibody targeting mkrn2, it was confirmed that microinjection of MOa or MOb significantly reduced, whereas mkrn2(s) enhanced, the protein level of mkrn2 in embryos (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, we showed that mkrn2 is required for early development as knockdown of mkrn2 caused embryonic death, possibly due to the defect in dorsal closure (Fig. 1B, top left panel, and Fig. 1C, 60/75, 80%). In contrast, microinjection of mkrn2(s) did not cause death at early stages but produced tadpoles with different degrees of dorso-posterior deficiencies and small head-short tail phenotype at stages 30–33 (Fig. 1B, right panels, and Fig. 1C, 39/75, 52%). However, these phenotypes could be rescued by the co-injection of MOa, suggesting that their effects are mkrn2-specific (Fig. 1B, bottom left panel, and Fig. 1C). These observations suggested that mkrn2 may have anti-neurogenic activity in Xenopus embryonic development. mkrn2 Regulated Neurogenesis and Axis Formation in Xenopus Embryos—We further validated the anti-neurogenic activity of mkrn2 by microinjecting its sense RNA into the DMZ of four-cell stage embryos. DMZ is a key embryonic region involved in body axis organization and neural induction. When compared with β-galactosidase-injected control embryos at stage 30, overexpression of mkrn2 at DMZ resulted in tadpoles with diminished head structure and short tail phenotype (Fig. 2A, bottom left panel, and Fig. 2B, 57/75, 76%), and the phenotype could be rescued by co-injection of MOa (Fig. 2B). Moreover, knockdown of mkrn2 by microinjection of MOa at VMZ did not cause embryonic death; however, the surviving tadpoles displayed axis duplication (Fig. 2A, top right panel, the arrows indicate the double axis, and Fig. 2B, 16/75, 21%), and the phenotype could be rescued by co-injection of mkrn2(s) (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results strongly suggested that mkrn2 plays a negative role in neurogenesis and axis formation during Xenopus embryonic development. mkrn2 Expression Was Comparatively Low in Adult Xenopus Brain and Skin Tissues—By RT-PCR analysis, we showed that high levels of mkrn2 mRNA could be detected in testis, small intestine, stomach, heart, liver, kidney, lung, large intestine, and muscle of adult male Xenopus (Fig. 2C). Consistent with its potential role as a neurogenesis inhibitor, mkrn2 mRNA levels were significantly lower in brain and skin. Overexpression of mkrn2 Inhibited Animal Cap Neuralization and NCAM Expression—Using the Xenopus AC explant system (Fig. 3A), we examined the effect of microinjection of mkrn2(s) or morpholino antisense oligonucleotide on the morphology of AC explant at stage 22 equivalent. As expected, in the presence of a neural-inducing factor retinoic acid and mesoderm-inducing factor activin, microinjection of control β-galactosidase mRNA was sufficient to induce neural-like extension in AC (Fig. 3B, β-gal). We found that overexpression of mkrn2 abrogated the retinoic acid plus activin induced AC neuralization, as the resulting AC exhibited round shaped epidermal-like phenotype (Fig. 3B, mkrn2(s)). Furthermore, knockdown of mkrn2 by MOa further enhanced the AC elongation and neuralization phenotype (Fig. 3B, MOa), and the co-injection of mkrn2(s) fully restored the normal AC phenotype (Fig. 3B, mkrn2(s)+MOa). To further verify the neuroinhibitory activity of mkrn2, we measured its effect on the expression of a key pan-neural marker NCAM in AC explant by RT-PCR. We showed that overexpression of mkrn2 suppressed, whereas knockdown of mkrn2 by MOa significantly stimulated, NCAM expression (Fig. 3C, lanes 2 and 3). Moreover, co-injection of mkrn2(s) fully abrogated MOa-induced NCAM expression (Fig. 3C, lane 4). These results are consistent with observations in AC morphology assay, further suggesting that mkrn2 is a neurogenesis inhibitor. mkrn2 Did Not Affect DN-BR-mediated Neurogenesis—It is well documented that blocking BMP-4 signaling by the dominant negative mutant of BMP-4 receptor (DN-BR) induces neural differentiation in Xenopus ectoderm (11Maeno M.

Commun. 1995; 212: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We tested whether mkrn2 is involved in this pathway. We first confirmed by RT-PCR that knockdown of mkrn2 by MOa was sufficient to induce NCAM expression even in the absence of retinoic acid and activin (Fig. 4A, lane 4). BMP-4 could not abolish MOa-induced NCAM expression, whereas mkrn2 effectively abolished MOa-induced NCAM expression (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 6). Furthermore, we showed that suppression of BMP-4 signaling by DN-BR induced NCAM expression (Fig. 4B, lane 2), and mkrn2 failed to suppress DN-BR-induced NCAM expression (Fig. 4B, lane 5). These results indicated that the anti-neurogenic activity of mkrn2 is independent of DN-BR signaling pathway. It has been reported that DN-BR mainly induces the expressions of NCAM and anterior neural marker OTX2 in AC explant. We then compared the ability of MOa and DN-BR to induce different neural markers. We found that knockdown of mkrn2 by MOa not only induced the expressions of NCAM and OTX2 but also induced the expressions of hindbrain marker Krox20, spinal cord marker HoxB9, and midbrain-hindbrain boundary marker En2 (Fig. 4C, lane 3). mkrn2 Acted Downstream of PI3K and Akt and Upstream of GSK-3β—We previously reported a novel role of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in axis formation and neural development during Xenopus embryogenesis (7Peng Y. Jiang B.H. Yang P.H. Cao Z. Shi X. Lin M.C. He M.L. Kung H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28509-28514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To determine whether and how mkrn2 modulates the PI3K signal, we interfered with the PI3K/Akt cascade to investigate the effect of mkrn2 on this signaling pathway. We first co-expressed mkrn2(s) with PI3K signal inducers, including the active form of the PI3K catalytic subunit (p110α*), the active form of Akt (Myr-Akt), and the dominant negative mutant of GSK-3β (DN-GSK3β) and examined their effects on NCAM expression in an AC explant assay. We showed that mkrn2 completely inhibited p110α*- and Myr-Akt-induced, but not DN-GSK3β-induced, NCAM expression (Fig. 5A, lanes 6–8). In contrast, we employed a truncated form of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (p85ΔiSH2) and dominant negative mutant of Akt (DN-Akt) to suppress the activities of endogenous PI3K and Akt, respectively. Ectopic expression of p85ΔiSH2 or DN-Akt could not inhibit MOa-induced NCAM expression, whereas MOa-induced NCAM expression was suppressed by GSK-3β (Fig. 5B, lanes 6–8). Taken together, these results indicated that mkrn2 acts downstream of PI3K and Akt and upstream of GSK-3β. In addition, we examined the ability of PI3K signals to induce different neural markers. Surprisingly, the neural marker expression patterns of p110α*, Myr-Akt, and DN-GSK3β (Fig. 5C, lanes 3–5) were essentially the same as that triggered by MOa (Fig. 5C, lane 2). These results further support the hypothesis that mkrn2 inhibits neurogenesis through modulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Cross-talk between PI3K and Wnt8 Signaling Pathways at GSK-3β but Not mkrn2—As Wnt8 signaling is one of the major pathways for neural development in Xenopus embryos (14Baker J.C. Beddington R.S. Harland R.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3149-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and GSK-3β is a common downstream target of both PI3K and Wnt8 signaling, we tested whether mkrn2 plays a role in the cross-talk between Wnt8- and PI3K-induced NCAM expression. We showed that XWnt8-induced NCAM expression (Fig. 6A, lane 2) could not be abolished by co-expression of mkrn2(s), p85ΔiSH2, or DN-Akt (Fig. 6A, lanes 7–9). In contrast, GSK-3β abolished XWnt8-mediated NCAM induction (Fig. 6A, lane 12) and XWnt8 did not affect mkrn2 expression (Fig. 6B, lane 4), indicating that the cross-talk between PI3K and Wnt signaling pathways is mediated by GSK-3β, but not mkrn2. mkrn2 Positively Regulated GSK-3β mRNA Expression—As mkrn2 had been showed to work upstream of GSK-3β, we investigated how mkrn2 regulates GSK-3β. We found by RT-PCR that overexpression of mkrn2 induced GSK-3β expression, whereas knockdown of mkrn2 suppressed the expression of GSK-3β (Fig. 7A, lanes 2 and 3). We also noticed that PI3K signal inducers (p110α* and Myr-Akt) inhibited mkrn2 and GSK-3β expression (Fig. 7A, lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, the mRNA levels of mkrn and GSK-3β significantly increased upon the suppression of PI3K and Akt (Fig. 7B, lanes 4 and 5). These results suggested that upstream PI3K/Akt signal inhibits both GSK-3β and mkrn2 at mRNA level, and mkrn2 positively regulates GSK-3β. To study the correlation between mkrn2 and GSK-3β, we measured mkrn2 and GSK-3β mRNA levels in different injection groups (Fig. 7C). We found a significant positive correlation between the mRNA levels of mkrn2 and GSK-3β (Fig. 7D). Consistent with the result from RT-PCR, Western blot analysis showed that mkrn2 also up-regulated the protein level of GSK-3β (Fig. 7E). These results suggested that mkrn2 preferentially up-regulates the expression of GSK-3β mRNA and subsequently leads to an increased level of GSK-3β protein. In summary, we uncovered a novel role of mkrn2 in inhibiting axis formation and neurogenesis during Xenopus embryonic development. Based on our previous report that the signal of PI3K activation is transmitted through its downstream target Akt, which in turn inhibits the activity of GSK-3β and regulates neural development (7Peng Y. Jiang B.H. Yang P.H. Cao Z. Shi X. Lin M.C. He M.L. Kung H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28509-28514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we provided evidence that mkrn2 achieves its anti-neurogenic effect by acting downstream of PI3K/Akt to up-regulate the expression of GSK-3β (Fig. 8). MKRN2 is the latest member in the makorin gene family. This gene is highly conserved throughout evolution, and its ancestral origin can be traced back to 450 million years ago, possibly arising from gene duplication of MKRN1 (5Gray T.A. Azama K. Whitmore K. Min A. Abe S. Nicholls R.D. Genomics. 2001; 77: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have performed sequence analysis and found that human MKRN1 and MKRN2 possess the same set of functional protein domains, suggesting that they may share similar functions or regulatory mechanisms (supplemental Fig. 1). Since MKRN2 is rarely studied and its biological function has never been reported, we employed Xenopus laevis as a model system to characterize the role of mkrn2 in Xenopus neurogenesis. We demonstrated that misexpression of mkrn2 resulted in tadpoles with dorsal-posterior deficiencies (Fig. 1), whereas knockdown by microinjection of morpholino was sufficient to induce axis duplication (Fig. 2). In AC explants, mkrn2 overexpression inhibited AC neuralization and neural marker NCAM expression (Fig. 3). These results provided strong indication that mkrn2 inhibits neurogenesis and is essential for proper neural development in Xenopus embryos. In fact, mkrn2 is highly expressed in adult Xenopus tissues that do not require extensive neural development, and only a low level of mkrn2 expression is observed in brain and skin (Fig. 2C). This tissue expression pattern can be rationally explained by our proposed anti-neurogenic activity of mkrn2. BMP-4 inhibition and activation of canonical Wnt signaling cascades are the two major mechanisms for neural induction (13Xu R.H. Kim J. Taira M. Zhan S. Sredni D. Kung H.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 14Baker J.C. Beddington R.S. Harland R.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3149-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 15Stern C.D. Development (Camb.). 2005; 132: 2007-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Using an AC explant culture system, we found that mkrn2 is involved in neither BMP-4 nor XWnt8 signaling pathway (Figs. 4 and 6A), but alternatively, participated in PI3K-mediated neurogenesis that we previously reported (Fig. 5) (7Peng Y.

PI3K is involved, through its downstream target Akt, in a wide range of cellular processes, such as cell survival (16Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar), myogenic differentiation (17Jiang B.H. Aoki M. Zheng J.Z. Li J. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 2001; 7: 482-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), angiogenesis (20Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Aoki M. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1749-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), and transformation (21Chang H.W. Aoki M. Fruman D. Auger K.R. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P.N. Cantley L.C. Roberts T.M. Vogt P.K. Science. 1997; 276: 1848-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Activated PI3K transmits survival signals from growth factors to Akt (22Duronio V. Scheid M.P. Ettinger S. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Akt then phosphorylates GSK-3β at residue Ser-9 and thereby inhibits its activity (23Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar). Inactivation of GSK-3β leads to decreased suppression of β-catenin and thus subsequently promotes axis formation and neurogenesis. Here we showed that mkrn2 abolished p110α*- and Myr-Akt-, but not DN-GSK3β-induced, NCAM expression (Fig. 5A). In addition, mkrn2 up-regulated the expression of GSK-3β at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 7). These results suggested that mkrn2 acts between Akt and GSK-3β in the PI3K pathway to antagonize the inactivation of GSK-3β (Fig. 8). The molecular mechanism involved in Akt/mkrn2/GSK-3β signaling is still far from clear at present. Since Akt is a serine threonine kinase, it is possible that Akt phosphorylates and inactivates mkrn2 by a mechanism similar to that of GSK-3β suppression. In silico kinase-specific phosphorylation prediction using Scansite (24Obenauer J.C. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3635-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar) and NetPhosK (25Blom N. Sicheritz-Ponten T. Gupta R. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 1633-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar) revealed that mkrn2 has a potential phosphorylation site at Ser-252. mkrn2 possesses four C3H zinc fingers that may be responsible for RNA binding (26Hudson B.P. Martinez-Yamout M.A. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). With these RNA-binding domains, mkrn2 may up-regulate the expression of GSK-3β mRNA at post-transcriptional level, rather than increasing the transcription of the GSK-3β gene. mkrn2 may be essential for the stabilization of GSK-3β mRNA or the transport of GSK-3β mRNA from nucleus to cytoplasm for translation via RNA binding activity (27Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 28De J. Lai W.S. Thorn J.M. Goldsworthy S.M. Liu X. Blackwell T.K. Blackshear P.J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The tandem repeat of C3H zinc fingers may provide high specificity for RNA binding (26Hudson B.P. Martinez-Yamout M.A. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Alternatively, as mkrn2 presumptively possesses ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) activity intimated by the presence of a highly conserved C3HC4 RING zinc finger domain (2Kim J.H. Park S.M. Kang M.R. Oh S.Y. Lee T.H. Muller M.T. Chung I.K. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 29Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that mkrn2 may favor the expression of GSK-3β by degrading yet unknown GSK-3β inhibitors via ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Dysregulation of PI3K/Akt pathway has been implicated in a wide range of human cancers (30Wymann M.P. Marone R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 31Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5100) Google Scholar). Data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), a public repository for microarray gene expression data, indicated that human MKRN2 is overexpressed in various cancer cell lines. For example, MKRN2 was significantly up-regulated by more than 4-fold in metastatic colon cancer cell line SW620, as compared with its primary tumor counterpart SW840 (GEO accession number GDS756). Moreover, MKRN2 was found to be up-regulated by more than 2-fold in breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-436, as compared with normal mammary epithelial cells (GEO accession numbers GDS820 and GDS823). The overexpression of mammalian MKRN2 in cancer cell lines raises the possibility that MKRN2 may involve in PI3K/Akt pathway for tumor progression. In conclusion, our results illustrate for the first time a functional role of mkrn2 in negatively regulating neurogenesis via PI3K/Akt signaling in Xenopus embryos. The detailed molecular mechanisms and the potential functions of mammalian MKRN2 remain to be studied. We thank Oscar G. W. Wong and Vanessa W. S.

Here, a porous titanium implant was fabricated for the delivery of microencapsulated bioactive cues. Control-released transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) promoted the proliferation and migration of human mesenchymal stem cells into porous implants in vitro. At 4 wk of implantation in the rabbit humerus, control-released TGF-beta1 from porous implants significantly increased bone-to-implant contact (BIC) by 96% and bone ingrowth by 50% over placebos. Control-released 100 ng TGF-beta1 induced equivalent BIC and bone ingrowth to adsorbed 1 microg TGF-beta1, suggesting that controlled release is effective at 10-fold less drug dose than adsorption. Histomorphometry, scanning electron microscopy, and microcomputed tomography showed that control-released TGF-beta1 enhanced bone ingrowth in the implant's pores and surface. These findings suggest that solid prostheses can be transformed into porous implants to serve as drug delivery carriers, from which control-released bioactive cues augment host tissue integration."
https://openalex.org/W2116641466,"Production of antisera able to recognize individual heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunits resulted in rapid expansion of information on their distribution and function. However, no antibodies that specifically recognize the active state have been available. Four-way primary screening of 763 hybridomas generated from mice immunized with guanosine 5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate-loaded G alpha(i1) and isolated using an automated robotic colony picker identified three antibodies that interacted with the constitutively active, Q(204)L, mutant but neither the constitutively inactive, G(203)A, mutant nor wild-type G alpha(i1). This profile extended to other closely related G(i) family G proteins but not to the less closely related G alpha(s) and G alpha(q)/G alpha(11) families. Each antibody was, however, also able to identify wild-type, GDP-bound G(i) family G proteins in the presence of fluoroaluminate, which mimics the presence of the terminal phosphate of GTP and hence generates an active/transition state conformation. Stimulation of cells coexpressing a wild-type G alpha(i) subunit and the dopamine D2 receptor with the agonist ligand nor-apomorphine also allowed these conformationally selective antibodies to bind the G protein. Such reagents allow the specific identification of activated G proteins in a native environment and may allow the development of label-free screening assays for G protein-coupled receptor-mediated activation of G(i) family G proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2126364842,"Methylation of promoter DNA contributes to transcriptional silencing of various tumor-suppressor genes in cancer. Transcriptional silencing of 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1) promotes tumorigenesis. Methylation of 15-LOX-1 promoter DNA occurs in some cancers, but its mechanistic role in 15-LOX-1 transcriptional silencing is unclear. We examined the mechanistic role of 15-LOX-1 promoter DNA methylation in 15-LOX-1 transcriptional regulation in human colorectal cancers. 15-LOX-1 promoter methylation occurred in colorectal cancer cells in vitro, in 36% of tumor tissue samples of colorectal cancer patients, and in virtually no normal colonic mucosa samples of 50 human subjects with no history of colorectal cancer or polyps. 15-LOX-1 promoter DNA methylation levels, however, did not correlate with 15-LOX-1 expression levels (Spearman's r=0.21; P=0.38). We employed siRNA knockdown and genetic disruption models of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) to study the effects of this methylation on 15-LOX-1 expression in colon cancer cells. 15-LOX-1 promoter demethylation was insufficient to reestablish 15-LOX-1 expression. 15-LOX-1 transcription was activated by the histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) only after DNMT-1 dissociation from the 15-LOX-1 promoter and without altering 15-LOX-1 promoter DNA methylation. DNMT-1 protein hypomorphism impaired DNMT-1 recruitment to the 15-LOX-1 promoter, which allowed 15-LOX-1 transcription activation by SAHA. DNMT-1 has a direct suppressive role in 15-LOX-1 transcriptional silencing that is independent of 15-LOX-1 promoter DNA methylation."

This suggests that Na+- and H+-bound versions of hCNT3 have significantly different conformations of the nucleoside binding pocket and/or translocation channel. Here, we describe a conformationally sensitive pore-lining cysteine residue in TM12 of hCNT3 whose accessibility to the hydrophilic membrane-impermeant thiol reagent p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate (PCMBS) reports a specific H+-activated state of the transporter. Site-directed Mutagenesis and DNA Sequencing—hCNT3 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AF305210) in the Xenopus expression vector pGEM-HE (23Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar) provided the template for construction of hCNT3 mutants by the oligonucleotide-directed technique (24Kirsch R.D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1848-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) using reagents from the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's directions. Constructs were sequenced in both directions by Taq dideoxy-terminator cycle sequencing to ensure that only the correct mutation had been introduced. hCNT3 cDNA also provided the template for the construction of a cysteine-free version of hCNT3 (hCNT3C-) in which all 14 endogenous cysteine residues of wild-type hCNT3 were converted to serine (25Zhang J. Tackaberry T. Ritzel M.W. Raborn T. Barron G. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 389-398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also in pGEM-HE, hCNT3C- was then used as the template for the construction of hCNT3C- mutants. Production of Wild-type and Mutant hCNT3 Proteins in Xenopus Oocytes—hCNT3 cDNAs were transcribed with T7 polymerase using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ (Ambion) transcription system and produced in oocytes of Xenopus laevis by standard procedures (26Yao S.Y.M.

Healthy defolliculated stage VI oocytes were microinjected with 20 nl of water or 20 nl of water containing RNA transcript (20 ng) and incubated in modified Barth's medium (changed daily) at 18 °C for 72 h before the assay of transport activity. Oocytes producing recombinant wild-type hCNT1 and hCNT2 (GenBank™ accession numbers U62968 and AF036109, respectively) were prepared identically. Flux Assays—Transport was measured as described previously (21Slugoski M.D. Loewen S.K. Ng A.M.L. Smith K.M. Yao S.Y.M. Karpinski E. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D.

Groups of 12 oocytes were incubated at room temperature (20 °C) in 200 μl of transport medium containing either 100 mm NaCl or choline chloride (ChCl) and 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 and 8.5, or MES, pH 5.5. The uridine concentration was 20 μm unless otherwise stated. Uptake was traced with 14C- or 3H-labeled uridine (1 or 2 μCi/ml, respectively) (GE Healthcare) using a 1-min uptake interval to measure initial rates of transport (influx). In transport assays with adenosine, 1 μm deoxycoformycin was also included to inhibit adenosine breakdown by adenosine deaminase. At the end of the incubation period, extracellular label was removed by six rapid washes in ice-cold Na+-free 100 mm ChCl transport medium, pH 7.5, and individual oocytes were dissolved in 1% (w/v) SDS for quantitation of oocyte-associated radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting (LS 6000 IC; Beckman). In PCMBS inhibition studies oocytes were pretreated with PCMBS on ice for 10 min and then washed 5 times with ice-cold transport medium to remove excess organomercurial before the assay of transport activity. Control experiments established that a 10-min exposure to PCMBS resulted in maximum inhibition of hCNT3 transport activity. Corresponding pretreatment with the methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents MTSEA, MTSES, and MTSET was performed at room temperature (20 °C) for 5 min. In substrate protection experiments, unlabeled uridine (20 mm) was included along with PCMBS (28Yao S.Y.M. Sundaram M. Chomey E.G. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 387-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To demonstrate reversal of inhibition, PCMBS-treated oocytes were subjected to a second preincubation with 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) at room temperature for 1 min (28Yao S.Y.M. Sundaram M. Chomey E.G. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 387-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The flux values shown represent mediated transport, corrected for basal uridine uptake measured in control water-injected oocytes, and are the means ± S.E. of 10–12 oocytes. IC50 values (±S.E.) were calculated using ENZFITTER software (Elsevier-Biosoft). Each experiment was performed at least twice on different batches of cells. Electrophysiology—Steady-state and presteady-state currents in hCNT3-producing oocytes were measured at room temperature (20 °C) using the whole-cell, two-electrode voltage clamp (GeneClamp 500B, Molecular Devices Corp.) as previously described (16Smith K.M.

The GeneClamp 500B was interfaced to an IBM-compatible PC via a Digidata 1322A A/D converter and controlled by pCLAMP software (Version 9.0, Molecular Devices Corp.). The microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 megaohms. After microelectrode penetration, resting membrane potential was measured over a 10-min period before the start of the experiment. Oocytes exhibiting an unstable membrane potential or a potential more positive than -30 mV were discarded. Individual oocytes with good resting membrane potentials were clamped at -50 mV. Steady-state currents were measured using a uridine concentration of 100 μm. Presteady-state (transient) currents were studied using a voltage pulse protocol. Membrane voltage was stepped from the holding potential (Vh) of -50 mV to a range of test potentials (Vt) from -130 to +30 mV in 20 mV increments. The voltage rise time of the clamp was adjusted by use of an oscilloscope such that it varied between 200 and 500 μs. Current measurements were sampled before and after incubation with 500 μm PCMBS (100 mm NaCl, pH 5.5, 10 min) in the appropriate transport medium of the same composition used in radioisotope transport assays (100 mm NaCl or ChCl, pH 8.5). Current signals were filtered at 2 kHz (fourpole Bessel filter) at a sampling interval of 200 μs/point (corresponding to a sampling frequency of 5 kHz). For data presentation, the current at each test potential was averaged from 5 sweeps and further filtered at 0.75 kHz by pCLAMP 9.0 software (Molecular Devices Corp.). In contrast to Na+-specific hCNT1 and hCNT2, hCNT3 is able to couple uphill nucleoside transport to both Na+ and H+ electrochemical gradients (9Ritzel M.W.L. Yao S.Y.M. Huang M.Y. Elliott J.F.

Five of the hCNT3 cysteine residues are located in putative TMs (TMs 1, 11, 12, and 13), and the remainder reside within the extramembranous N- and C-terminal regions of the protein. In this report we have used site-directed mutagenesis and heterologous expression of hCNT1–3 in Xenopus oocytes to reveal a unique H+-activated conformational state of hCNT3 in which one of the conserved cysteine residues becomes reactive to PCMBS.

https://openalex.org/W2153085034,"MyoD, a skeletal muscle transcription factor, is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. MyoD interacts with ubiquitously expressed E2A or inhibitor of DNA binding (Id) proteins to activate or inhibit transcription, respectively. Furthermore, MyoD has been shown to modulate the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Id1 and E2A proteins, E12 and E47. The molecular mechanisms governing these events are not clear but are hypothesized to occur via heterodimer formation. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a technique for evaluation of protein-protein interactions in vivo. Using acceptor photobleaching FRET and chimeric proteins composed of MyoD, Id1, E12, E47, E12(NLS), or MyoD(NLS) and either cyan fluorescent protein or yellow fluorescent protein, we show that each of the wild-type proteins is capable of homodimerization. In addition, heterodimers form between Id1 and E2A proteins, as well as between MyoD and E2A proteins. The Id1:E2A interaction is stronger than the MyoD:E2A interaction, which is consistent with the notion that inhibition of MyoD action occurs by the sequestration of E2A proteins by Id. The stronger interaction of Id1 with E2A may also explain the decrease in the rate of ubiquitin-proteasome degradation of Id1 that is significantly greater than that of MyoD when E2A proteins are abundant. Thus, these studies extend our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of MyoD action."

A computational model for the enzyme is presented that sheds light on the structural aspects of interest in this family of enzymes. The main mechanism of resistance of bacteria to aminoglycoside antibiotics is the enzymatic modification of the amino or hydroxyl groups of these drugs (1Vakulenko S.B. Mobashery S. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 16: 430-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar).

This mechanism of resistance is particularly relevant for clinical enterococcal and staphylococcal isolates (2Magnet S. Blanchard J.S. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 477-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Despite the widespread occurrence of aminoglycoside phosphotransferases in pathogenic bacteria, only a few of these enzymes have been characterized mechanistically (3Martel A. Masson M. Moreau N.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12681-12688Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The most prevalent aminoglycoside phosphotransferases are the APH(3′)s, which transfer a phosphate group to the 3′-hydroxyl of kanamycin A (7Kim C. Mobashery S. Bioorg. Chem. 2005; 33: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). From this class, APH(3′)-IIIa has been the best studied (4McKay G.A. Wright G.D.

Product and dead end inhibition, solvent isotope, and viscosity effect experiments have shown that this enzyme follows a Theorell-Chance mechanism for turnover chemistry, with ordered substrate binding (ATP prior to aminoglycoside) and sequential product release (the release of ADP occurs last in the rate-limiting step) (4McKay G.A. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8680-8685Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that this enzyme involves a loose, or dissociative, transition state for the phosphate transfer (9McKay G.A. Wright G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24686-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), in agreement with the findings for the nonenzymatic phosphate transfer in monoesters (11Cleland W.W.

The presence of what came to be known as the aph(2″) antibiotic resistance genes (aph(2″)-Ia, -Ib, -Ic, and -Id) in enterococci was shown to eliminate the synergistic killing achieved by the combination of gentamicin with a cell wall active antimicrobial agent, such as ampicillin (12Lee H.K. Vakulenko S.B. Clewell D.B. Lerner S.A. Chow J.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3253-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The results that are described herein reveal for the first time that the mechanistic information precludes the grouping of these enzymes collectively as APH(2″) type I (a, b, c, and d subgroups) enzymes. The enzyme previously designated as APH(2″)-Ic, the subject of our study, is classified as APH(2″)-IIIa in this report. We report the cloning, purification, and mechanistic investigations of this enzyme from Enterococcus spp. Cloning, Protein Expression, and Purification—The aph(2″)-IIIa gene, previously cloned into the pBluescript II KS(+) vector (12Lee H.K. Vakulenko S.B. Clewell D.B. Lerner S.A. Chow J.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3253-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), was used as a template for cloning into the expression vector. The plasmid pBluescript::aph(2″)-Ic was digested with NdeI and HindIII, and the aph(2″)-IIIa gene was cloned into the unique NdeI-HindIII sites of pET22a vector (Novagen) to produce pET22a::aph(2″)-IIIa. Chemically competent Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with this plasmid, and selection was performed on LB agar supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. A solution of 1.4 liters of LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 mm l-proline was inoculated with 15 ml of an overnight culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring the pET22a::aph(2″)-IIIa plasmid. The medium was incubated at 37 °C in a shaking bath until the culture reached an optical density of 1.25 at 600 nm. The culture was cooled to 10 °C, and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.8 mm. The cells were grown at 10 °C (200 rpm) for 16 h and were harvested by centrifugation at 3500 × g. The cell pellet was resuspended in 40 ml of buffer A (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA), and the bacteria were disrupted by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 30 min, and streptomycin sulfate (1.5%) was added to the supernatant to precipitate nucleic acids. The resultant solution was centrifuged at 3500 × g for 20 min, followed by dialysis of the supernatant against two changes of buffer A. The dialysate was centrifuged at 3500 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was loaded unto a kanamycin affinity (Affi-Gel 15; Bio-Rad) column (2.5 × 10 cm) prepared as previously described (13Kim C. Haddad J. Vakulenko S.B. Meroueh S.O. Wu Y. Yan H. Mobashery S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2373-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). APH(2″)-IIIa was eluted by a linear gradient of buffer B (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA) in buffer A from 25 to 40% over two column volumes. Fractions were analyzed by assay of dibekacin phosphorylation and by SDS-PAGE for enzyme purity. Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated to 30 ml, dialyzed overnight against buffer A, and applied to a gentamicin affinity column (2.5 × 10 cm) prepared as previously described (13Kim C. Haddad J. Vakulenko S.B. Meroueh S.O. Wu Y. Yan H. Mobashery S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2373-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). APH(2″)-IIIa was eluted with a 55-75% gradient of buffer B in buffer A over two column volumes. Fractions of >95% purity of APH(2″)-IIIa were pooled, concentrated to 0.35 mg/ml, dialyzed against the storage buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and stored at -80 °C without significant loss of activity over 4 months. The protein concentration was determined using the calculated extinction coefficient at 280 nm (Δϵ280 = 31,900 m-1 cm-1), using the program from the ExPASy server (available on the World Wide Web). Kinetic Studies—Enzyme activity was monitored (unless otherwise stated) by coupling the release of NDP (GDP, ADP, UDP, IDP, CDP, or TDP) from the APH(2″)-IIIa-catalyzed phosphorylation of the aminoglycosides to pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, as previously described (5Siregar J.J. Lerner S.A. Mobashery S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In a typical experiment, 480 μl of assay mixture (100 mm buffer, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 0.2 mm NADH, 2 mm PEP, 12 units of pyruvate kinase, 27 units of lactate dehydrogenase) was mixed with NTP and APH(2″)-IIIa (23-230 nm); the reaction was started by adding the aminoglycoside. When CTP and TTP were used as the phosphate donors, higher levels of pyruvate kinase were used (i.e. 60 and 120 units, respectively), due to the poor turnover of CDP and TDP by this enzyme. All experiments were carried out at 25 °C. The buffers used for the pH profiles were as follows: MES (pH 5.8-6.7), HEPES (pH 6.8-7.8), and TAPS (pH 7.9-8.6). The pD values were taken as pH meter reading + 0.4. For the inhibition experiments with GDP and also when using GTPγS as a substrate, the regeneration of GTP from the product (GDP) was interrupted by decoupling the pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase system (PEP was excluded from the assay buffer). After different incubation times, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 1 mm neomycin; PEP was then added, and the change in absorbance at 340 nm (Δϵ340 = 6700 m-1 cm-1) (8Mckay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6936-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) gave the amount of product formed at different times (the background absorbance change due to GDP present in the system was always subtracted). For measuring the thio effect, defined as kO/kS, where kO and kS are the rate constants for GTP and GTPγS, respectively, kanamycin A was used at a saturating value of 50 μm, and GTP (or GTPγS) was used at four different concentrations (5, 10, 20, and 40 μm). Isolation of Turnover Product of Kanamycin A—Phosphorylated kanamycin A was synthesized in vitro by incubating 40 mg of kanamycin A in 10 ml of reaction buffer (100 mm HEPES, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, pH 7.5, 40 mm PEP, 7 mm GTP, 3.4 μm APH(2″)-IIIa, 540 units of pyruvate kinase) for 6 h at 25 °C, after which additional pyruvate kinase (400 units) was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for a further 14 h. The reaction mixture at that point contained less than 1% kanamycin A, as determined from a kinetic assay. The solution was filtered through a 10 kDa cut-off membrane to remove the proteins, and the filtrate was applied to a silica gel column; the column was washed with an H2O/MeOH (1:1) mixture (200 ml), followed by an H2O/MeOH/NH4OH (1:1:0.5) mixture (80 ml). The latter contained the phosphorylated kanamycin A, as shown by TLC (EtOH/MeOH/H2O/NH4OH (1:1:0.9:0.9), Rf = 0.57). The 80-ml fraction was dried by evaporation in vacuo, and the residue was resuspended in water (5 ml). The insoluble matter was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was loaded onto an Amberlite CG 50 ion exchange resin (Sigma) column (2.5 × 10 cm), previously activated with 1% NH4OH and equilibrated with water. The column was washed with water (200 ml), and the sample was eluted stepwise with different concentrations of NH4OH in water (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1% (v/v)), 30 ml (3 × 10 ml fractions) for each concentration. Phosphokanamycin A eluted at 0.6-0.8% NH4OH over 30 ml (TLC). The fractions containing phosphokanamycin A were dried by evaporation in vacuo, the residue was resuspended in water (1 ml), and the solution was centrifuged to remove the insoluble impurities. The supernatant was loaded unto a G10 Sephadex (Sigma) column (1 × 120 cm) pre-equilibrated with water. It was eluted with water, and fractions (1 ml) were collected; phosphokanamycin A eluted at 35-50 ml. The fractions were monitored by TLC as described above, and those containing phosphokanamycin A were concentrated to dryness in vacuo. 1H NMR of purified 2″-phosphokanamycin A has been reported previously in conjunction with the reaction of APH(2″)-Ib (14Toth M. Zajicek J. Kim C. Chow J.W. Smith C. Mobashery S. Vakulenko S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5570-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and the spectrum of our sample was identical to the literature report. Data Analysis—For determining kcat and kcat/Km for the aminoglycoside and NTP substrates, the concentration of the second substrate was kept constant and at saturating levels, and the kinetic data were fit to the simple Michaelis-Menten equation, v=Vm[A]Ka+[A](Eq. 1) where Vm represents the maximum velocity, and [A] and Ka are the concentration and the Michaelis constant of the variable substrate. The true dissociation constants of the substrates from the free enzyme (Kia for substrate A and Kib for substrate B) were determined by fitting the initial velocities to Equation 2, corresponding to a random mechanism (where KiaKb = KibKa). v=Vm[A][B]KiaKb+Ka[B]+Kb[A]+[A][B](Eq. 2) The inhibition constants, Kis (corresponding to the dissociation of the EI complex) and Kii (corresponding to the dissociation of the EIB complex) of the substrate analogues (aminoglycosides and GMP-PNP) were determined from fitting the initial velocities obtained at several concentrations of inhibitor to Equation 3 for a noncompetitive inhibition of a substrate A analogue against substrate B at fixed concentrations of substrate A, as described by Morrison (15Morrison J.F. Encycl. Life Sci. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., Chichester, UK2001: 1-8Google Scholar). v=Vm[A][B]KiaKb1+[I]Kis+Kb[A]+Ka[B]1+[I]Kii+[A][B](Eq. 3) For the competitive inhibition of a substrate A analogue against substrate A, the apparent competitive inhibition constant, Kic, was determined and was found to be in good agreement with the calculated value (Kic = (Kib/[B] + 1)/(Kib/Kis[B] + 1/Kii) using the Kis and Kii values determined from the noncompetitive plots. We have used this approach rather than just determining the competitive and noncompetitive inhibition constants, because for a random mechanism, the latter are not true dissociation constants (15Morrison J.F. Encycl. Life Sci. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., Chichester, UK2001: 1-8Google Scholar). The same procedure was used for calculating Kis and Kii for the product inhibition of GDP (for a product inhibition pattern with one dead-end complex in a random mechanism). For 2″-phosphokanamycin A, the Kis was calculated from Equation 4 (for a product inhibition pattern with no dead end complexes in a random mechanism). v=Vm[A][B]KiaKb1+[I]Kis+Kb[A]+Ka[B]+[A][B](Eq. 4) Viscosity Effects—The effect of solvent viscosity was determined in the presence of sucrose and polyethylene glycol 8000. Sucrose was used at concentrations of 14, 22, and 30% (w/v) that correspond to relative viscosities (η/η0) of 1.5, 2.0, and 3.2 (16Lide D.R. 85th Ed. Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2004: 58-84Google Scholar). Polyethylene glycol 8000 was used at a concentration of 6.7% (w/v) (η/η0 = 3.6 (15Morrison J.F. Encycl. Life Sci. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., Chichester, UK2001: 1-8Google Scholar)). The assays were performed at fixed concentrations of kanamycin A (50 μm) or dibekacin (100 μm) and variable concentrations of GTP, GTPγS (5-400 μm), ITP (20-400 μm), and ATP (0.5-2.0 mm). The viscosity effect is given by the slope of a plot of k0/k against relative viscosity (i.e. (k0/k)η, where k0 and k are the rate constants in the absence and presence of viscosigen, respectively). Molecular Modeling—A three-stage molecular modeling was performed to generate the computational model of APH(2″)-IIIa. The analysis is based on the structure of the homologous APH(2″)-IIa (previously described as APH(2″)-Ib), whose x-ray structure was recently solved in collaboration with Dr. C. Smith. 3C. Smith and S. Vakulenko, unpublished data. Primary alignment using the Web-based BLAST program shows that the sequence identity is 26% and gaps are 7% at an expectation value (E-value) of 1e-15. The critical residues visualized in Sybyl (version 7.0, Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO) are conserved in these two enzymes, as will be described. The positions of several conserved residues were used to thread in the Swiss model (17Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4506) Google Scholar) the sequence for APH(2″)-IIIa to that of APH(2″)-IIa and enabled us to wrap amino acids one by one to the backbone residues of APH(2″)-IIa. The gaps in both target and template sequences required further processing of the computational model in the second stage of modeling. We carried out a template library search based on the hidden Markov method (18Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar) and aligned the initial structure of APH(2″)-IIIa from the first stage to the template of APH(3′)-IIa (Protein Data Bank code 1n4d). The resulting E-value improved to 2.95e-18. The third stage of modeling was the optimization of the solvated structure at room temperature (300 K). This was performed by the Amber software package of molecular dynamics programs (19Case D.A. Darden D.A. Cheatman T.E. Simmerling C.L. Wang J. Duke R.E. Luo R. Merz K.M. Wang B. Perlman D.A. Crowley M. Brozell S. AMBER 8. University of California, San Francisco2004Google Scholar). With atoms restrained in harmonic potential, the model was energy minimized with 250,000 steps in Cartesian space, using the steepest descent method. Subsequently, the six individual molecular dynamics simulations were carried out by gradually relaxing the restraints on the entire APH(2″)-IIIa model, expressed in a force constant from 500 kcal mol-1 A2 to 100, 50, 10, 2, and 0 kcal mol-1 A2. The fully relaxed system was then subjected to a molecular dynamics run of 12 ps during heating from 0 to 100 K and 4 ps equilibrated at 100 K. The procedure was repeated for temperatures ranging between 100 and 200 K and 200 and 300 K. At 300 K, a 2000-step equilibrating process was completed, and the averaged structure was selected for imaging. Substrate Profile—We investigated ATP, GTP, ITP, UTP, CTP, and TTP as phosphate donors for the reaction with kanamycin A, kanamycin B, dibekacin, and tobramycin. CTP and TTP are poor substrates for APH(2″)-IIIa for phosphorylation of dibekacin and tobramycin, with kcat/Km values smaller than 10 m-1 s-1 (Table 1). Among the other four nucleotide triphosphates, GTP had the lowest Km value (4.0 μm), followed by ITP (Km = 39 μm). UTP and ATP have Km values of 1.3 and 1.6 mm, respectively, at pH 7.5. Although the kcat values are similar for GTP, ITP, UTP, and ATP with kanamycin B, dibekacin, and tobramycin, there was a larger difference in catalytic efficiency of the enzyme for kanamycin A when different NTPs were used as phosphate donor (Table 1). The highest kcat for kanamycin A phosphorylation was seen with ITP as a phosphate donor, and it was 2.5-fold higher than with GTP and 15- and 20-fold higher than with UTP and ATP, respectively. However, the Km for kanamycin A increases with increases of the Km for NTP (i.e. from GTP to ITP to ATP to UTP), which makes GTP the most efficient second substrate for kanamycin A phosphorylation in terms of kcat/Km values. This trend (increase in Km of kanamycin A with increase in the Km for the NTP) might suggest a positive cooperativity effect in substrate binding.TABLE 1NTP substrate profile of APH(2″)-IIIa, determined in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.50, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl at 25 °C The Km and kcat/Km values were determined for aminoglycosides at fixed concentrations of NTP.NTPKanamycin AKanamycin BDibekacinTobramycinkcatKmKcat/KmkcatKmkcat/KmkcatKmkcatKms–1μmm–1 s–1s–1μmm–1 s–1s–1μms–1μmGTP (100 μm)0.8 ± 0.14.5 ± 0.5(1.8 ± 0.3) × 1050.8 ± 0.1<0.5>(1.6 ± 0.2) × 1060.7 ± 0.1<0.30.7 ± 0.1<0.3ITP (1.0 mm)2.1 ± 0.239 ± 4(5.6 ± 0.5) × 1041.7 ± 0.2<1>(1.7 ± 0.2) × 1061.5 ± 0.1<0.51.5 ± 0.1<0.5ATP (3.0 mm)0.09 ± 0.0290 ± 10(1.0 ± 0.1) × 1030.6 ± 0.12.4 ± 0.4(2.5 ± 0.5) × 1050.9 ± 0.1<10.9 ± 0.1<1UTP (3.0 mm)0.14 ± 0.02100 ± 10(1.4 ± 0.2) × 1030.7 ± 0.15.0 ± 0.6>(1.3 ± 0.2) × 1050.9 ± 0.1<10.9 ± 0.1<1 Open table in a new tab The preference for GTP over ATP is unusual for aminoglycoside phosphotransferases (4McKay G.A.

However, the ATP and GTP concentrations in bacteria have been estimated to be ∼3 and 1 mm, respectively (20Gaal T. Bartlett M.S. Ross W. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Gourse R.L. Science. 1997; 278: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Therefore, given the more ready saturation of APH(2″)-IIIa by GTP (Km = 4.0 μm) over ATP (Km = 1.6 mm), it is likely that this enzyme uses GTP as the phosphate donor in vivo. Consequently, the steady-state kinetic parameters for catalysis by APH(2″)-IIIa and the mechanistic model were determined with GTP as the second substrate. The aminoglycoside substrate profile for APH(2″)-IIIa with GTP is shown in Table 2. These studies reveal that only the 4,6-disubstituted aminoglycosides (kanamycin A, kanamycin B, dibekacin, tobramycin, gentamicin C, and netilmicin) showed significant turnover, with kcat values in the range of 0.7-0.9 s-1 at pH 7.5. The Km value could only be determined accurately for kanamycin A, since for the rest of these aminoglycosides the rate is independent of their concentrations from 2.5 to 100 μm, indicative of saturation at lower concentrations. Sensitivity of the assay did not permit us to use lower concentrations of the aminoglycosides in these experiments.TABLE 2Steady-state kinetic parameters and dissociation constants for APH(2″)-IIIa, determined in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.50, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl at 25 °C For the phosphorylation reaction, GTP concentration was held constant at saturating levels (100 μm), whereas for the inhibition studies, GTP concentration was varied around the Km value (4.0 μm).AminoglycosideMICaMIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; E coli JM83 with pBluescript::aph(2″)-IIIa plasmid/E. coli JM83 with pBluescript plasmid as described by Lee et al.

For two of these inhibitors, apramycin and neamine, the slope and intercept replots of the Lineweaver-Burk analysis were not linear at higher concentrations of inhibitor. We established that this nonlinearity is due to a residual GTPase activity (GTP hydrolase) of the enzyme (kcat of 0.012 ± 0.002 s-1 and a kcat/Km of (5.7 ± 0.8) × 102 m-1 s-1 at pH 7.5). This activity is actually enhanced in the presence of apramycin and neamine (kcat = 0.038 ± 0.004 s-1, kcat/Km = (3.4 ± 0.6) × 103 m-1 s-1 with apramycin and kcat = 0.041 ± 0.005 s-1, kcat/Km = (5.7 ± 0.7) × 103 m-1 s-1 with neamine). The Km parameter for GTP in the GTPase activity is decreased from 21 ± 3 μm (in the absence of the aminoglycosides) to 11 ± 1 and 7.2 ± 1 μm in the presence of apramycin and neamine, respectively. The numbers in the presence of the two aminoglycosides for the Km of GTP approach the Km value determined in the aminoglycoside phosphorylation reaction (4.0 ± 0.5 μm). Therefore, the dissociation constants for these antibiotics were determined by treating them as activators of the enzyme-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis (21Leskovac V. Comprehensive Enzyme Kinetics. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2003: 111-116Google Scholar). In fact, apramycin and neamine were the only nonphosphorylatable aminoglycosides studied that showed activation of the GTPase activity at concentrations below 100 μm, possibly due to a conformational change on the part of the enzyme combined with the accessibility of a water molecule to the catalytic site. It is worth noting that the kinetic parameters for kanamycin B with the four NTPs studied are significantly different from those for kanamycin A and closer to those for tobramycin and dibekacin (Table 1). The only structural difference between kanamycin A and B is the presence of an amino group in the 2′-position in kanamycin B, which replaces the hydroxyl group in kanamycin A (Fig. 1). The 2′ amino group is present in all other aminoglycoside substrates of APH(2″)-IIIa (Table 2). Hence, it appears that this amino group has a significant contribution in lowering the Km values of dibekacin, tobramycin, gentamicin C, and netilmicin with GTP as a phosphate donor (Table 2). The presence of the 2′ amino group also increases the turnover numbers and lowers aminoglycoside Km values for APH(2″)-IIIa with ATP and UTP as second substrates (Table 1). Our data demonstrate that APH(2″)-IIIa has a narrow aminoglycoside substrate profile compared with other enzymes of its class. The APH(2″)-Ia domain of AAC(6)-APH(2″)-Ia has a broad substrate profile, including the 4,6- and 4,5-disubstituted aminoglycosides; however, it exhibits somewhat modest kcat/Km values (103-105 m-1 s-1) (14Toth M.

We demonstrate here that there is no change in the affinity of the MEM83 antibody for the I-domain in either its low (wild-type) or high affinity form and that MEM83 does not enhance the binding of the wild-type I-domain to ICAM-1. Furthermore, we show that the antibody acts as an activating agent to induce LFA-1/ICAM-1-dependent homotypic cell aggregation only as an IgG, but not as a Fab fragment. On the basis of these data, we propose an avidity-based mechanism that requires no direct activation of the LFA-1 I-domain by the binding of the antibody; rather, activation is enhanced when there is an interaction with both arms of the IgG. A molecular model of the antibody interaction with LFA-1 illustrates the symmetry and accessibility of the two MEM83 epitopes across the LFA-1/ICAM-1 heterotetramer. We hypothesize that MEM83 stabilizes adjacent LFA-1 molecules in their active form by the free energy that is gained from the binding of the I-domains to each arm of the IgG. This leads to stabilization of the open state of the integrin and outside-in signaling.

Recognition and binding of its ICAM-1 ligand by LFA-1 are mediated through the inserted domain (I-domain) in its α-subunit; this forms a heterotetrameric complex through D1/D1-domain dimerization within ICAM-1 (28Shimaoka M.

Biochem. 2003; 270: 1710-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The epitope of MEM83 maps to two regions within the I-domain (Asp153–Phe183 and Thr217–Ile248), with Asp182 being required in the first region and Glu218 being required combinatorially in the second (51Lu C. Shimaoka M. Salas A. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3972-3978Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here, we investigate potential mechanisms for MEM83 interaction with LFA-1. LFA-1 I-domain Constructs—Wild-type (WT) and mutant (high affinity (HA) and intermediate (IA) affinity) I-domains (Gly123–Tyr304) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells using supplemented M9 minimal medium. The recombinant proteins were subsequently refolded and purified as described (52Shimaoka M. Lu C. Palframan R.T. von Andrian U.H. McCormack A. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2000; 295: 1251-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Proteins were concentrated using Centriprep C10 (Millipore Corp.), and sample concentrations were determined using BCA (Pierce) and at A280 nm. Each LFA-1 I-domain was also 15N-labeled to allow acquisition of 1H/15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance spectra for quality assurance prior to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis (data not shown). MEM83 Binding Assays—MEM83 was provided as a gift by Dr. Václav Hořejší (Institute of Molecular Genetics AS CR, Prague, Czech Republic) and was purified by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex™ 75, GE Healthcare). An aliquot of MEM83 was digested by papain, and the Fab fragments were purified on a protein A column as described (41Landis R.C. Bennett R.I. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1519-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). MEM83 fractions (either IgG or Fab) were concentrated, and sample concentrations were determined by both Bradford (Bio-Rad) and BCA assays. MEM83 IgG was coupled to a CM5 sensor chip (Biacore/GE Healthcare) by amine coupling following the manufacturer's protocols to a response unit of 4630. LFA-1 I-domains (WT, IA, and HA) at concentrations of 20, 50, and 100 nm were subsequently injected over the chip at 10 μl/min with Running Buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgSO4, and 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20). For the Fab binding analysis, the HA I-domain was bound to a CM5 chip by amine coupling to a response unit of 743. Buffers and binding conditions were as described for the MEM83 binding experiments. ICAM-1/Fc Binding Assays—ICAM-1/Fc (R&D Systems) was coupled to a CM5 sensor chip by amine coupling. LFA-1 I-domains (WT, IA, and HA) at concentrations of 100, 200, and 400 nm and LFA-1 I-domains complexed with excess (10-fold) MEM83 were injected over the chip at 10 μl/min with Running Buffer A. Negative binding controls with matching MEM83 concentrations were run as described above except that 3 mm EDTA was substituted for MgSO4 (Running Buffer B). Biacore Binding Analysis—All SPR (Biacore) sensorgrams were analyzed from triplicate runs using a 1:1 Langmuir model by Scrubber (Version 2.0, Center for Biomolecular Interaction Analysis, University of Utah). Homotypic Aggregation Assay—The aggregation experiment was performed in flat-bottom 96-well plates at 100 μl cells/well as described (35Tanaka Y. Histol. Histopathol. 2000; 15: 1169-1176PubMed Google Scholar). Human JY cells were washed twice and diluted in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (1000 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin; Invitrogen) to a final concentration of 107 cells/ml. Cells were treated with 10 ng/ml PMA, 0.5 μm Mn2+, 0.5 μm Ca2+, and MEM83 or MEM83 Fab at various concentrations and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The cells were observed, and photographs were taken under a light microscope. SPR binding assays for the MEM83 Fab fragment were performed both before and after the cell assays to ensure there was no inactivation of LFA-1 binding activity. Binding of LFA-1 I-domains by MEM83 as Measured by SPR—A potential mode of MEM83 activation may be due to an enhanced affinity of the antibody for the I-domain in its open HA form relative to its closed low affinity (WT) form. Hence, activation is mediated by direct tertiary interactions within the I-domain. To test this, we expressed recombinant LFA-1 I-domains (Gly123–Tyr307) in E. coli and purified and refolded these protein samples from inclusion bodies. We used SPR (Biacore) to measure the affinity of MEM83 IgG and Fab for the WT, disulfide-locked IA (L161C/F299C), and HA (K287C/K294C) forms (52Shimaoka M. Lu C. Palframan R.T. von Andrian U.H. McCormack A. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6009-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). No binding preference for the open form was observed (Fig. 1, A–C, and Table 1); thus, activation cannot be mediated by an induced tertiary switch directly upon antibody binding.TABLE 1SPR binding parameters of MEM83 for the LFA-1 I-domains Values are the means ± S.D. from three independent measurements at three different concentrations: 20, 50, and 100 nm.LFA-1 I-domainkonkoffKDm–1 s–1s–1nmHA230,000 ± 40,0000.0009 ± 0.00014.0 ± 0.4HA Fab520,000 ± 300,0000.0017 ± 0.00133.0 ± 0.8IA280,000 ± 90,0000.0010 ± 0.00024.0 ± 1.1WT340,000 ± 80,0000.00089 ± 0.000062.8 ± 0.7 Open table in a new tab To determine whether ICAM-1 and the MEM83 antibody are both required to enhance LFA-1 I-domain activation (47Knorr R. Dustin M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 719-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we bound ICAM-1/Fc to the Biacore CM5 chip surface and measured the affinity of ICAM-1 for the HA and WT LFA-1 I-domains in the presence and absence of the antibody (Fig. 2). Although there was an increased response unit upon premixing the antibody with the HA I-domain, no change in affinity was observed (Table 2). The presence of a divalent cation was required, as the addition of EDTA to the running buffer prevented the interaction with ICAM-1 (data not shown). Finally, no binding was observed for the WT I-domain in either the presence or absence of the antibody (Fig. 2).TABLE 2SPR binding parameters of the LFA-1 I-domains for ICAM-1 in the presence and absence of MEM83 Values are the means ± S.D. from three independent measurements at three different concentrations: 100, 200, and 400 nm.konkoffKDm–1 s–1s–1nmHA I-domain420,000 ± 34,0000.120 ± 0.100310 ± 60HA I-domain/MEM8368,000 ± 29,0000.019 ± 0.007290 ± 30WT I-domainaIndicates binding below the level of detectionaIndicates binding below the level of detectionaIndicates binding below the level of detectionWT I-domain/MEM83aIndicates binding below the level of detectionaIndicates binding below the level of detectionaIndicates binding below the level of detectiona Indicates binding below the level of detection Open table in a new tab Our data indicate that MEM83 neither directly enhanced nor blocked the binding of the LFA-1 I-domain to ICAM-1. The HA I-domain in its open conformation enhances stable adhesion with ICAM-1 (53Salas A. Shimaoka M. Chen S. Carman C.V. Springer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50255-50262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 54Astrof N.S. Salas A. Shimaoka M. Chen J. Springer T.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15020-15028Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and was not blocked by the addition of MEM83 (Table 2). This is consistent with the mapped MEM83 epitope, which indicates that the antibody binds to a region within the I-domain that does not significantly change its local structure upon activation (Fig. 1D) (51Lu C. Shimaoka M. Salas A. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3972-3978Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Published work on glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored LFA-1 I-domains showed increased cell rolling upon binding of MEM83 (47Knorr R. Dustin M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 719-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Based on our data, this increase in rolling efficiency in the presence of MEM83 may be due to an increased affinity that is below the threshold of detection for SPR. Alternatively, MEM83 binding may preferentially orient the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored I-domain for ICAM-1 binding or be the result of shear flow conditions (55Eniola A.O. Krasik E.F. Smith L.A. Song G. Hammer D.A. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 3577-3588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Avidity and Steric Wedge Activation Mechanisms—Rather than a directly induced change in the tertiary structure of the I-domain, our data suggest that the activation mechanism for MEM83 results from induced changes in the overall quaternary structure of LFA-1. We propose two models, avidity and steric wedge, for MEM83-mediated activation of LFA-1 that are based on the accessibility of the antibody to bind the I-domain in the full-length protein. An avidity model is based on the binding of the LFA-1 I-domains to both arms of the IgG. In this model, MEM83 can bind only one I-domain in the bent/closed conformation because of the close proximity of the I-domain to the membrane, whereas the IgG is able to bind and cross-link I-domains from two separate LFA-1/ICAM-1 heterotetramers (28Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.H. Yang Y. Dong Y. Jun C.D. McCormack A. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Takagi J. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Cell. 2003; 112: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) in its extended/open conformation. Thus, an avidity model of outside-in activation of LFA-1 links both arms of an IgG molecule to two LFA-1/ICAM-1 heterotetramers, and vice versa, two I-domains within a single heterotetramer to two separate IgG molecules, to generate a one-dimensional array. An alternative mode of activation could be that MEM83 acts as a steric wedge between the LFA-1 I-domain and the adjacent β-propeller domain or that the accessibility for the MEM83 epitope is blocked by the membrane when the integrin is in its closed form. Electron microscopy studies of the closed form of LFA-1 have estimated a distance of 8–74 Å between the I-domain and cell membrane; in the open form of LFA-1, this distance increases to 230–250 Å (56Nishida N. Xie C. Shimaoka M. Cheng Y. Walz T. Springer T.A. Immunity. 2006; 25: 583-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Thus, as the integrin exchanges between both conformations, the MEM83 antibody would bind and stabilize the extended/open form of LFA-1. The primary difference between these models is that the avidity model depends on the presence of two binding sites on the intact IgG portion of MEM83. Thus, to explore whether both binding sites are required, we used homotypic cell aggregation assays (41Landis R.C. Bennett R.I. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1519-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 57Johnston S.C. Dustin M.L. Hibbs M.L. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1181-1187PubMed Google Scholar) to compare the MEM83 IgG and Fab forms. We obtained identical results in three independent homotypic cell aggregation dose dependence experiments with MEM83 IgG, where the aggregation score dropped to 3 at 0.4 nm, and no aggregation above background was observed below 0.04 nm. Cell aggregation was evident only in the MEM83 IgG samples, with an aggregation profile similar to that of the Mn2+- and PMA-positive controls (Fig. 3). However, the Fab fragment of the antibody did not induce cell aggregation at the same concentrations. These data indicate that LFA-1 I-domain binding by both arms of MEM83 IgG is necessary for activation and suggest that only one arm is accessible to bind when the I-domain is in its closed conformation. Our cell assay data are in contrast to those from a previous study in which both MEM83 IgG and Fab resulted in homotypic aggregation (41Landis R.C. Bennett R.I. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1519-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for these differences is that the closed form of LFA-1, with its I-domain close to the cell membrane (56Nishida N. Xie C. Shimaoka M. Cheng Y. Walz T. Springer T.A. Immunity. 2006; 25: 583-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), may become sensitive to the accessibility of MEM83 Fab under variable glycosylation patterns of the integrin in the different cell lines and culture media that were used. We note, however, that the literature for MEM83 abounds with seemingly conflicting reports of its role as both an activating and a blocking antibody as well as its being activation-insensitive (40Bazil V. Stefanova I. Hilgert I. Kristofova H. Vanek S. Hořejší V. Folia Biol. (Praha). 1990; 36: 41-50PubMed Google Scholar, 41Landis R.C. Bennett R.I. Hogg N. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 10638-10641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A Molecular Model of MEM83-mediated LFA-1 Activation—On the basis of our data, we generated a molecular model of the MEM83 interaction with LFA-1 and ICAM-1 (Fig. 4). Our model makes use of the LFA-1 IA I-domain/ICAM-1 D1/D2-domain heterotetrameric crystal structure (28Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.H. Yang Y. Dong Y. Jun C.D. McCormack A. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Takagi J. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Cell. 2003; 112: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) and a template human IgG structure (59Padlan E.A. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 169-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). The hypervariable region of this template IgG was oriented adjacent to MEM83 epitope residues Asp182 and Glu218 within the first I-domain, creating one repeating unit of our avidity model. In this orientation, positioning of Repeating Unit 2 required simply a translation along the x axis (Fig. 4A). We used domain models of ICAM-1 and LFA-1 in its open conformation to illustrate the overall arrangement of the complex across two cell membranes (Fig. 4B). The relative orientation of the I-domain was dictated by the requirement to place the C-terminal α7-helix Glu310 residue proximal to the β2 I-domain (60Alonso J.L. Essafi M. Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Arnaout M.A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R340-R342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 61Yang W. Shimaoka M. Salas A. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our model demonstrates how cross-linking through both the IgG and two accessible MEM83 epitopes across the heterotetramer would lead to the formation of a one-dimensional array. This accessibility of the MEM83 epitope is supported by modeling and electron microscopy studies indicating that the α I-domain within the integrin headpiece is largely exposed (1Shimaoka M. Springer T.A. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2004; 4: 1485-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 56Nishida N. Xie C. Shimaoka M. Cheng Y. Walz T. Springer T.A. Immunity. 2006; 25: 583-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 60Alonso J.L. Essafi M. Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Arnaout M.A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R340-R342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 62Luo B.H. Springer T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 63Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Considerable rotational freedom is envisaged within our model for an IgG molecule relative to the MEM83 epitope. Because of steric considerations of the C2 symmetry, a single IgG molecule binding both LFA-1 I-domains within the heterotetramer is unlikely. MEM83 acts as a blocking antibody for the interaction of LFA-1 with ICAM-3 (42Landis R.C. McDowall A. Holness C.L. Littler A.J. Simmons D.L. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 47Knorr R. Dustin M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 719-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which is likely due to overlap of the MEM83 epitope residues and the I-domain/ICAM-3 epitope D (Asp182–Ser184) (64Binnerts M.E. Van Kooyk Y. Edwards C.P. Champe M. Presta L. Bodary S.C. Figdor C.G. Berman P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9962-9968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). MEM83 was also reported to completely block the interaction of LFA-1 with ICAM-4 (50Ihanus E. Uotila L. Toivanen A. Stefanidakis M. Bailly P. Cartron J.P. Gahmberg C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1710-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We note that, unlike ICAM-1 and ICAM-3, ICAM-2 and ICAM-4 have only two extracellular Ig-like domains (65Bailly P. Hermand P. Callebaut I. Sonneborn H.H. Khamlichi S. Mornon J.P. Cartron J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5306-5310Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Orientation of the IgGs within our model exhibits how the MEM83 antibody could block an interaction of ICAM-4 with LFA-1 (Fig. 4B). Our model can readily incorporate ICAM-1 D4/D4-domain dimerization to form a one-dimensional array of adjacent heterotetramers (66Yang Y. Jun C.D. Liu J.H. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Springer T.A. Wang J.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 269-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), together with MEM83-linked I-domain dimerization. This would link an increase in avidity to an increase in affinity of LFA-1. In this manner, clustering induced by the MEM83 antibody may be analogous to that induced by the T cell receptor in the immunological synapse of the T cell (23Grakoui A. Bromley S.K. Sumen C. Davis M.M. Shaw A.S. Allen P.M. Dustin M.L. Science. 1999; 285: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar). In light of our data indicating that the binding of MEM83 to isolated I-domains is activation-insensitive, we hypothesize that MEM83 can stabilize adjacent LFA-1 molecules only while they are in their active form. This stabilization occurs via I-domain binding to each arm of the IgG hypervariable regions. The resting state of LFA-1 is the closed/low affinity form, and cross-linking this form by a non-blocking antibody would not enhance integrin activation. Alternately, a non-blocking antibody such as MEM83, which can recognize two I-domain epitopes across two LFA-1/ICAM-1 heterotetramers, would provide the additional free energy necessary to stabilize the active form of LFA-1. Hence, this array-mediated stabilization of the open/high affinity conformation of the integrin leads to outside-in signaling. We thank Professor Václav Hořejší for generously providing the MEM83 antibody; Professor Timothy A. Springer for advice and providing the LFA-1 I-domain clones; Andrea L. Creath and John W. Craft, Jr., for help with this manuscript; and Dr. Laura Gutiérrez."
