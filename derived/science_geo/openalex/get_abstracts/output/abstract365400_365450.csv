https://openalex.org/W2022837310,"A 2-year follow-up of a randomized field experiment previously reported in Science is presented. A subtle intervention to lessen minority students' psychological threat related to being negatively stereotyped in school was tested in an experiment conducted three times with three independent cohorts ( N = 133, 149, and 134). The intervention, a series of brief but structured writing assignments focusing students on a self-affirming value, reduced the racial achievement gap. Over 2 years, the grade point average (GPA) of African Americans was, on average, raised by 0.24 grade points. Low-achieving African Americans were particularly benefited. Their GPA improved, on average, 0.41 points, and their rate of remediation or grade repetition was less (5% versus 18%). Additionally, treated students' self-perceptions showed long-term benefits. Findings suggest that because initial psychological states and performance determine later outcomes by providing a baseline and initial trajectory for a recursive process, apparently small but early alterations in trajectory can have long-term effects. Implications for psychological theory and educational practice are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2025919590,"Genes are not simply turned on or off, but instead their expression is fine-tuned to meet the needs of a cell. How genes are modulated so precisely is not well understood. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates target genes by associating with specific DNA binding sites, the sequences of which differ between genes. Traditionally, these binding sites have been viewed only as docking sites. Using structural, biochemical, and cell-based assays, we show that GR binding sequences, differing by as little as a single base pair, differentially affect GR conformation and regulatory activity. We therefore propose that DNA is a sequence-specific allosteric ligand of GR that tailors the activity of the receptor toward specific target genes."
https://openalex.org/W2152231606,"Tarpey et al. carry out a large-scale systematic sequencing of the majority of X-chromosome coding exons from 208 families with multiple individuals with mental retardation and a pattern of transmission compatible with X linkage in order to identify XLMR-causative mutations. They find several mutations that appear to be causative in loci already known to be involved in XLMR, as well as new data about those loci, and make inferences about the role of the different classes of variants in these diseases. Large-scale systematic resequencing has been proposed as the key future strategy for the discovery of rare, disease-causing sequence variants across the spectrum of human complex disease. We have sequenced the coding exons of the X chromosome in 208 families with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR), the largest direct screen for constitutional disease-causing mutations thus far reported. The screen has discovered nine genes implicated in XLMR, including SYP, ZNF711 and CASK reported here, confirming the power of this strategy. The study has, however, also highlighted issues confronting whole-genome sequencing screens, including the observation that loss of function of 1% or more of X-chromosome genes is compatible with apparently normal existence."
https://openalex.org/W2130912501,"Engineering artificial gene networks from modular components is a major goal of synthetic biology. However, the construction of gene networks with predictable functions remains hampered by a lack of suitable components and the fact that assembled networks often require extensive, iterative retrofitting to work as intended. Here we present an approach that couples libraries of diversified components (synthesized with randomized nonessential sequence) with in silico modeling to guide predictable gene network construction without the need for post hoc tweaking. We demonstrate our approach in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by synthesizing regulatory promoter libraries and using them to construct feed-forward loop networks with different predicted input-output characteristics. We then expand our method to produce a synthetic gene network acting as a predictable timer, modifiable by component choice. We use this network to control the timing of yeast sedimentation, illustrating how the plug-and-play nature of our design can be readily applied to biotechnology."
https://openalex.org/W2007771322,"Using deep sequencing (deepCAGE), the FANTOM4 study measured the genome-wide dynamics of transcription-start-site usage in the human monocytic cell line THP-1 throughout a time course of growth arrest and differentiation. Modeling the expression dynamics in terms of predicted cis-regulatory sites, we identified the key transcription regulators, their time-dependent activities and target genes. Systematic siRNA knockdown of 52 transcription factors confirmed the roles of individual factors in the regulatory network. Our results indicate that cellular states are constrained by complex networks involving both positive and negative regulatory interactions among substantial numbers of transcription factors and that no single transcription factor is both necessary and sufficient to drive the differentiation process."
https://openalex.org/W2166795672,"Retrotransposons and repetitive DNA elements in eukaryotes are silenced by small RNA-directed heterochromatin formation. In Arabidopsis, this process involves 24-nt siRNAs that bind to ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) and facilitate the targeting of complementary loci via unknown mechanisms. Nuclear RNA polymerase V (Pol V) is an RNA silencing enzyme recently shown to generate noncoding transcripts at loci silenced by 24-nt siRNAs. We show that AGO4 physically interacts with these Pol V transcripts and is thereby recruited to the corresponding chromatin. We further show that DEFECTIVE IN MERISTEM SILENCING3 (DMS3), a structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) hinge-domain protein, functions in the assembly of Pol V transcription initiation or elongation complexes. Collectively, our data suggest that AGO4 is guided to target loci through base-pairing of associated siRNAs with nascent Pol V transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W2104010088,"Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS) technology appears to be a general strategy to generate pluripotent stem cells from any given mammalian species. So far, iPS cells have been reported for mouse, human, rat, and monkey. These four species have also established embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines that serve as the gold standard for pluripotency comparisons. Attempts have been made to generate porcine ESC by various means without success. Here we report the successful generation of pluripotent stem cells from fibroblasts isolated from the Tibetan miniature pig using a modified iPS protocol. The resulting iPS cell lines more closely resemble human ESC than cells from other species, have normal karyotype, stain positive for alkaline phosphatase, express high levels of ESC-like markers (Nanog, Rex1, Lin28, and SSEA4), and can differentiate into teratomas composed of the three germ layers. Because porcine physiology closely resembles human, the iPS cells reported here provide an attractive model to study certain human diseases or assess therapeutic applications of iPS in a large animal model."

https://openalex.org/W2014104667,"The molecular mechanisms controlling the termination of cortical interneuron migration are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that, prior to synaptogenesis, migrating interneurons change their responsiveness to ambient GABA from a motogenic to a stop signal. We found that, during migration into the cortex, ambient GABA and glutamate initially stimulate the motility of interneurons through both GABA(A) and AMPA/NMDA receptor activation. Once in the cortex, upregulation of the potassium-chloride cotransporter KCC2 is both necessary and sufficient to reduce interneuron motility through its ability to reduce membrane potential upon GABA(A) receptor activation, which decreases the frequency of spontaneous intracellular calcium transients initiated by L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channel (VSCC) activation. Our results suggest a mechanism whereby migrating interneurons determine the relative density of surrounding interneurons and principal cells through their ability to sense the combined extracellular levels of ambient glutamate and GABA once GABA(A) receptor activation becomes hyperpolarizing."
https://openalex.org/W1999838582,"Input comparison is thought to occur in many neuronal circuits, including the hippocampus, where functionally important interactions between the Schaffer collateral and perforant pathways have been hypothesized. We investigated this idea using multisite, whole-cell recordings and Ca2+ imaging and found that properly timed, repetitive stimulation of both pathways results in the generation of large plateau potentials in distal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. These dendritic plateau potentials produce widespread Ca2+ influx, large after-depolarizations, burst firing output, and long-term potentiation of perforant path synapses. Plateau duration is directly related to the strength and temporal overlap of pathway activation and involves back-propagating action potentials and both NMDA receptors and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Thus, the occurrence of highly correlated SC and PP input to CA1 is signaled by a dramatic change in output mode and an increase in input efficacy, all induced by a large plateau potential in the distal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2040414277,"We recently showed that improved perceptual performance on a visual motion direction-discrimination task corresponds to changes in how an unmodified sensory representation in the brain is interpreted to form a decision that guides behavior. Here we found that these changes can be accounted for using a reinforcement-learning rule to shape functional connectivity between the sensory and decision neurons. We modeled performance on the basis of the readout of simulated responses of direction-selective sensory neurons in the middle temporal area (MT) of monkey cortex. A reward prediction error guided changes in connections between these sensory neurons and the decision process, first establishing the association between motion direction and response direction, and then gradually improving perceptual sensitivity by selectively strengthening the connections from the most sensitive neurons in the sensory population. The results suggest a common, feedback-driven mechanism for some forms of associative and perceptual learning."
https://openalex.org/W2137701569,"Actions performed by others may have different relevance for the observer, and thus lead to different behavioral responses, depending on the regions of space in which they are executed. We found that in rhesus monkeys, the premotor cortex neurons activated by both the execution and the observation of motor acts (mirror neurons) are differentially modulated by the location in space of the observed motor acts relative to the monkey, with about half of them preferring either the monkey's peripersonal or extrapersonal space. A portion of these spatially selective mirror neurons encode space according to a metric representation, whereas other neurons encode space in operational terms, changing their properties according to the possibility that the monkey will interact with the object. These results suggest that a set of mirror neurons encodes the observed motor acts not only for action understanding, but also to analyze such acts in terms of features that are relevant to generating appropriate behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2016576552,"An active microbial assemblage cycles sulfur in a sulfate-rich, ancient marine brine beneath Taylor Glacier, an outlet glacier of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, with Fe(III) serving as the terminal electron acceptor. Isotopic measurements of sulfate, water, carbonate, and ferrous iron and functional gene analyses of adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate reductase imply that a microbial consortium facilitates a catalytic sulfur cycle. These metabolic pathways result from a limited organic carbon supply because of the absence of contemporary photosynthesis, yielding a subglacial ferrous brine that is anoxic but not sulfidic. Coupled biogeochemical processes below the glacier enable subglacial microbes to grow in extended isolation, demonstrating how analogous organic-starved systems, such as Neoproterozoic oceans, accumulated Fe(II) despite the presence of an active sulfur cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1986981536,"Piwi family proteins are essential for germline development and bind piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). The grandchildless gene aub of Drosophila melanogaster encodes the piRNA-binding protein Aubergine (Aub), which is essential for formation of primordial germ cells (PGCs). Here we report that Piwi family proteins of mouse, Xenopus laevis and Drosophila contain symmetrical dimethylarginines (sDMAs). We found that Piwi proteins are expressed in Xenopus oocytes and we identified numerous Xenopus piRNAs. We report that the Drosophila homologue of protein methyltransferase 5 (dPRMT5, csul/dart5), which is also the product of a grandchildless gene, is required for arginine methylation of Drosophila Piwi, Ago3 and Aub proteins in vivo. Loss of dPRMT5 activity led to a reduction in the levels of piRNAs, Ago3 and Aub proteins, and accumulation of retrotransposons in the Drosophila ovary. Our studies explain the relationship between aub and dPRMT5 (csul/dart5) genes by demonstrating that dPRMT5 is the enzyme that methylates Aub. Our findings underscore the significance of sDMA modification of Piwi proteins in the germline and suggest an interacting pathway of genes that are required for piRNA function and PGC specification."
https://openalex.org/W2113150782,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) regulate zebrafish dorsoventral patterning through two distinct receptor complexes. Surprisingly, BMPs function as an obligate heterodimer of BMP-2 and -7, while BMP homodimers are inactive. Patterning the embryonic dorsoventral axis of both vertebrates and invertebrates requires signalling through bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs)1. Although a well-studied process, the identity of the physiologically relevant BMP signalling complex in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo is controversial2,3, is generally inferred from cell culture studies and has not been investigated in vertebrates. Here, we demonstrate that dorsoventral patterning in zebrafish, Danio rerio, requires two classes of non-redundant type I BMP receptors, Alk3/6 and Alk8 (activin-like kinases 3/6 and 8). We show, under physiological conditions in the embryo, that these two type I receptor classes form a complex in a manner that depends on Bmp2 and Bmp7. We found that both Bmp2–7 heterodimers, as well as Bmp2 and Bmp7 homodimers, form in the embryo. However, only recombinant ligand heterodimers can activate BMP signalling in the early embryo, whereas a combination of Bmp2 and Bmp7 homodimers cannot. We propose that only heterodimers, signalling through two distinct classes of type I receptor, possess sufficient receptor affinity in an environment of extracellular antagonists to elicit the signalling response required for dorsoventral patterning."
https://openalex.org/W1980244548,"Inappropriate elevation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) is reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The object of this study was to identify the molecular mechanism underlying this increase of MMP9 expression, and here we show that oxidative stress-dependent reduction of a protein deacetylase, SIRT1, known as a putative antiaging enzyme, causes elevation of MMP9 expression. A sirtuin inhibitor, splitomycin, and SIRT1 knockdown by RNA interference led an increase in MMP9 expression in human monocytic U937 cells and in primary sputum macrophages, which was detected by RT-PCR, Western blot, activity assay, and zymography. In fact, the SIRT1 level was significantly decreased in peripheral lungs of patients with COPD, and this increase was inversely correlated with MMP9 expression and MMP9 promoter activation detected by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. H(2)O(2) reduced SIRT1 expression and activity in U937 cells; furthermore, cigarette smoke exposure also caused reduction of SIRT1 expression in lung tissue of A/J mice, with concomitant elevation of MMP9. Intranasal treatment of a selective and novel SIRT1 small molecule activator, SRT2172, blocked the increase of MMP9 expression in the lung as well as pulmonary neutrophilia and the reduction in exercise tolerance. Thus, SIRT1 is a negative regulator of MMP9 expression, and SIRT1 activation is implicated as a novel therapeutic approach to treating chronic inflammatory diseases, in which MMP9 is abundant."
https://openalex.org/W2080505000,"Here we describe the parametric response map (PRM), a voxel-wise approach for image analysis and quantification of hemodynamic alterations during treatment for 44 patients with high-grade glioma. Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and flow (rCBF) maps were acquired before treatment and after 1 and 3 weeks of therapy. We compared the standard approach using region-of-interest analysis for change in rCBV or rCBF to the change in perfusion parameters on the basis of PRM (PRM(rCBV) and PRM(rCBF)) for their accuracy in predicting overall survival. Neither the percentage change of rCBV or rCBF predicted survival, whereas the regional response evaluations made on the basis of PRM were highly predictive of survival. Even when accounting for baseline rCBV, which is prognostic, PRM(rCBV) proved more predictive of overall survival."
https://openalex.org/W2057222381,"The distinct electrical properties of axonal and dendritic membranes are largely a result of specific transport of vesicle-bound membrane proteins to each compartment. How this specificity arises is unclear because kinesin motors that transport vesicles cannot autonomously distinguish dendritically projecting microtubules from those projecting axonally. We hypothesized that interaction with a second motor might enable vesicles containing dendritic proteins to preferentially associate with dendritically projecting microtubules and avoid those that project to the axon. Here we show that in rat cortical neurons, localization of several distinct transmembrane proteins to dendrites is dependent on specific myosin motors and an intact actin network. Moreover, fusion with a myosin-binding domain from Melanophilin targeted Channelrhodopsin-2 specifically to the somatodendritic compartment of neurons in mice in vivo. Together, our results suggest that dendritic transmembrane proteins direct the vesicles in which they are transported to avoid the axonal compartment through interaction with myosin motors."

https://openalex.org/W2025627720,"Ligand-mediated dimerization has emerged as a universal mechanism of growth factor receptor activation. Neurotrophins interact with dimers of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)), but the mechanism of receptor activation has remained elusive. Here, we show that p75(NTR) forms disulphide-linked dimers independently of neurotrophin binding through the highly conserved Cys(257) in its transmembrane domain. Mutation of Cys(257) abolished neurotrophin-dependent receptor activity but did not affect downstream signaling by the p75(NTR)/NgR/Lingo-1 complex in response to MAG, indicating the existence of distinct, ligand-specific activation mechanisms for p75(NTR). FRET experiments revealed a close association of p75(NTR) intracellular domains that was transiently disrupted by conformational changes induced upon NGF binding. Although mutation of Cys(257) did not alter the oligomeric state of p75(NTR), the mutant receptor was no longer able to propagate conformational changes to the cytoplasmic domain upon ligand binding. We propose that neurotrophins activate p75(NTR) by a mechanism involving rearrangement of disulphide-linked receptor subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2034538997,"Many theories of neural networks assume rules of connection between pairs of neurons that are based on their cell types or functional properties. It is finally becoming feasible to test such pairwise models of connectivity, due to emerging advances in neuroanatomical techniques. One method will be to measure the functional properties of connected pairs of neurons, sparsely sampling pairs from many specimens. Another method will be to find a “connectome,” a dense map of all connections in a single specimen, and infer functional properties of neurons through computational analysis. For the latter method, the most exciting prospect would be to decode the memories that are hypothesized to be stored in connectomes. Many theories of neural networks assume rules of connection between pairs of neurons that are based on their cell types or functional properties. It is finally becoming feasible to test such pairwise models of connectivity, due to emerging advances in neuroanatomical techniques. One method will be to measure the functional properties of connected pairs of neurons, sparsely sampling pairs from many specimens. Another method will be to find a “connectome,” a dense map of all connections in a single specimen, and infer functional properties of neurons through computational analysis. For the latter method, the most exciting prospect would be to decode the memories that are hypothesized to be stored in connectomes. In constructing a neural network model of brain function, it is standard to start from a mathematical description of spiking and synaptic transmission, make assumptions about how neurons are connected by synapses and then numerically simulate or analytically derive the activity patterns of the network. Success is declared if the model's activity patterns reproduce those measured by neurophysiologists. Initially, the model neurons used in such networks were highly simplified to the point of being naive. But they have become more sophisticated over the years, incorporating findings about intrinsic and synaptic currents in neurons. In contrast, many assumptions about neural connectivity have been used by theorists for decades without revision, because they have been difficult to test empirically. It has been popular to assume that the connectivity between any pair of neurons is a function of variables associated with the neurons. These variables, which I dub cell labels, are attributes of a neuron that can be measured without determining its connectivity directly. The cell label can include what neuroanatomists call cell type, which is defined classically by shape and location (Bota et al., 2003Bota M. Dong H.W. Swanson L.W. From gene networks to neural networks.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 795-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, Masland, 2004Masland R.H. Neuronal cell types.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R497-R500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In the retina, photoreceptors make connections onto horizontal cells, a rule of connectivity based on cell type (Masland, 2001bMasland R.H. The fundamental plan of the retina.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). A cell label could also include some property that is determined by a neurophysiologist through activity measurements. For example, some models of the primary visual cortex assume that excitatory neurons with similar preferred orientations are connected (Somers et al., 1995Somers D.C. Nelson S.B. Sur M. An emergent model of orientation selectivity in cat visual cortical simple cells.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5448-5465PubMed Google Scholar, Ben-Yishai et al., 1995Ben-Yishai R. Bar-Or R.L. Sompolinsky H. Theory of orientation tuning in visual cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 3844-3848Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), so that the cell label is preferred orientation. For testing such a pairwise model of neural connectivity, two standard neuroanatomical methods are available. Sparse reconstruction relies on light microscopy and sparse labeling of neurons, and dense reconstruction relies on electron microscopy and dense labeling. Both methods have been problematic. Axons can be less than 100 nm in diameter (Shepherd and Harris, 1998Shepherd G.M.G. Harris K.M. Three-dimensional structure and composition of CA3→ CA1 axons in rat hippocampal slices: implications for presynaptic connectivity and compartmentalization.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8300-8310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and dendritic spine necks can be even narrower (Fiala and Harris, 1999Fiala J.C. Harris K.M. Dendrite structure.in: Stuart G. Spruston N. Häusser M. Dendrites. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 1-34Google Scholar). Since 100 nm is less than the wavelength of visible light, these structures cannot be resolved with a light microscope if they are entangled in a densely stained neuropil (but see Hell, 2007Hell S.W. Far-field optical nanoscopy.Science. 2007; 316: 1153-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (2170) Google Scholar for exceptions to this rule). However, one can see a single neuron stained with dye, as long as the surrounding neurons are unstained and hence remain invisible. This trick was employed by Golgi, who invented a stain that marked a sparse subset of neurons in the brain. Cajal used Golgi's stain to reconstruct the branching patterns of neurons. If two neurons made contact with each other, Cajal inferred that they were connected. However, he could not rigorously prove this inference, because he could not see synapses. Contact suggests that a connection exists, but a synapse must be identified to prove it. In short, connection = contact + synapse. In the 1970s, neuroanatomists began to use electron microscopy for dense reconstruction of neurons. In principle, this imaging method has enough spatial resolution to see all of the axons and dendrites in a densely labeled neuropil. It is also possible to identify synapses through telltale markers such as vesicles. Most famously, electron microscopy was used to map every connection in the nervous system of the nematode C. elegans (White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For every synapse between two neurites, the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons were identified by tracing the neurites back to their parent cell bodies. Although the C. elegans nervous system is quite small (see http://wormatlas.org for about 300 neurons and 7000 synapses), mapping its connections consumed over a decade of effort. White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar called the fruits of their labors a “reconstructed nervous system.” Others dubbed it a “wiring diagram,” comparing the branches of neurons with the wires of an electronic device. Today we use the term connectome to refer to the complete map of all connections in a brain or piece of brain (Sporns et al., 2005Sporns O. Tononi G. Kotter R. The human connectome: a structural description of the human brain.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2005; 1: e42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar, Lichtman and Sanes, 2008Lichtman J.W. Sanes J.R. Ome sweet ome: what can the genome tell us about the connectome?.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2008; 18: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Because of the Herculean labor involved, dense reconstruction has not been extended to more complex connectomes than that of C. elegans. To diagnose the problems succinctly, sparse reconstruction has yielded contacts rather than connections, while dense reconstruction has been too laborious to be practical. Fortunately, these deficiencies are being rectified by emerging technical advances. The advent of genetic methods of fluorescent labeling has improved the confidence with which sparse reconstruction can identify synaptically coupled pairs of neurons (Smith, 2007Smith S.J. Circuit reconstruction tools today.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, Luo et al., 2008Luo L. Callaway E.M. Svoboda K. Genetic dissection of neural circuits.Neuron. 2008; 57: 634-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). And the automation of sectioning, electron microscopy, and image analysis is making the finding of connectomes more efficient (Briggman and Denk, 2006Briggman K.L. Denk W. Towards neural circuit reconstruction with volume electron microscopy techniques.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, Smith, 2007Smith S.J. Circuit reconstruction tools today.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Improved methods for determining neural connectivity will aid neuroscience in many ways. In the study of neural development, it will become possible to precisely specify the goals of the processes that wire up the brain and characterize what happens when these processes malfunction. We will learn the exact nature of “connectopathies,” pathologies of neural connectivity that are associated with mental disorders (Catani and ffytche, 2005Catani M. ffytche D.H. The rises and falls of disconnection syndromes.Brain. 2005; 128: 2224-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The study of interspecies differences in connectivity will shed light on brain evolution (Striedter, 2006Striedter G.F. Prècis of principles of brain evolution.Behav. Brain Sci. 2006; 29: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar). These are all exciting possibilities, but I will take a more parochial view, considering only the implications for pairwise models of connectivity. Testing these models will either provide evidence for neural network models or refute them conclusively if the assumptions about connectivity are inconsistent with empirical data. The latter possibility is perhaps more important for scientific progress, if the definition of science rests on the Popperian criterion of falsifiability. It is obvious how to use sparse reconstruction to test pairwise models. Simply determine the cell labels of connected pairs of neurons. Doing this repeatedly will eventually yield good estimates of pairwise statistics. If the cell label is just classical cell type, it can be determined by neuroanatomical means from the shape and location of the neuron. If the cell label also contains functional properties, finding it will require measurements of activity by electrophysiology or optical imaging. In this paper, I'd like to advance a thesis that is less obvious: pairwise models will be testable by dense reconstruction, even if the cell labels are unknown. It may be possible to treat cell labels as hidden variables and infer their values by computational analysis of connectomes. In general, the hidden-variable approach will use dense information about connectivity to amplify the utility of sparse information about activity for understanding neural networks. The retina will be an important arena for testing the new methods of sparse and dense reconstruction. Its neurons are divided into five broad classes, which are further subdivided into classical cell types, estimated to number 50–60 in the mammalian retina (Masland, 2001bMasland R.H. The fundamental plan of the retina.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). According to one hypothesis, the connectivity between a pair of retinal neurons is a function of their cell types and locations. The hypothesis appears to be true in the outer plexiform layer of the retina. Current research is focused on the inner plexiform layer, where the connectivity is still mostly unknown. Success in the retina will be followed by more ambitious projects. An exciting prospect is testing the old theory that memories are stored in neural connections. If the theory is true, then a connectome might be compared to a book in which memories are written. To read a book, we must see the letters on the page and also decode their meaning. Dense reconstruction will enable us to “see” connectomes. Computational methods that infer cell labels by treating them as hidden variables will allow us to “decode” connectomes. I will describe possible methods of reading procedural memories from avian brain area HVC (Li and Greenside, 2006Li M.R. Greenside H.

Monosynaptic restriction of transsynaptic tracing from single, genetically targeted neurons.Neuron. 2007; 53: 639-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar used a genetically modified rabies virus to label the presynaptic partners of a sparse set of neurons in vitro. More work will be required to verify the accuracy of this approach, as tracing errors could result if the virus fails to cross certain kinds of synapses or spreads between neurons that are not synaptically connected. The challenge of delivering the virus to specific cells or cell types in vivo also remains. But it's safe to say that sparse reconstruction has already improved dramatically in its ability to measure neural connectivity. In dense reconstruction, both image acquisition and analysis have been laborious. Electron microscopy is coupled with the technique of serial sectioning to create 3D volume images of neural tissue (Harris et al., 2006Harris K.M. Perry E. Bourne J. Feinberg M. Ostroff L. Hurlburt J. Uniform serial sectioning for transmission electron microscopy.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 12101-12103Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The specimen is manually cut into extremely thin sections, and electron microscopy is applied to produce a sequence of 2D images. This sequence is equivalent to a 3D volume image, up to the distortions that are produced by the process of sectioning and imaging. In expert hands, the best section thickness is about 50 nm, which limits the spatial resolution in the direction of cutting. Since axons can be less than 100 nm in diameter, they can become difficult or impossible to trace accurately when axons are nearly parallel to the cutting plane (White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Hobert and Hall, 1999Hobert O. Hall D.H. Neuroanatomy: A second look with GFP reporters and some comments.Worm Breed. Gaz. 1999; 16: 24Google Scholar). By eliminating manual handling of sections, it is possible to cut thinner than the classical limit of 50 nm and yet reliably yield long sequences of 2D images. In serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM), the ultramicrotome is placed inside the vacuum chamber of an electron microscope (Denk and Horstmann, 2004Denk W. Horstmann H. Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy to reconstruct three-dimensional tissue nanostructure.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e329Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Thin sections are repeatedly cut off and discarded without imaging them. Instead, the exposed face of the block is repeatedly imaged with backscattered electrons. The entire process requires no manual intervention and yields a vertical resolution of better than 30 nm (Briggman and Denk, 2006Briggman K.L. Denk W. Towards neural circuit reconstruction with volume electron microscopy techniques.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the automatic tape-collecting lathe ultramicrotome (ATLUM) is an instrument that cuts serial sections and collects them on a tape (Kasthuri et al., 2007Kasthuri N. Hayworth K. Lichtman J. Erdman N. Ackerley C.A. New technique for ultra-thin serial brain section imaging using scanning electron microscopy.Microsc. Microanal. 2007; 13: 26-27Crossref Google Scholar). Once the fragile sections are on the sturdy tape, they can be handled for SEM imaging with relative ease. But improved methods of image acquisition are not enough to make finding connectomes routine. White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar reconstructed C. elegans neurons by manually tracing their cross sections through the images using a primitive technology, pen marks on photographic prints. Image analysis is becoming faster and more accurate through the use of computers. In an ongoing project to find the connectome of the C. elegans male, computer software displays images to human users and captures and organizes their annotations (S. Emmons, personal communication). This computer-assisted approach has sped up image analysis by roughly ten times, making it probable that the connectomes of the male and larval stages will finally be completed in the near future. The approach has also enabled the reconstruction of highly branched neurons in the male, which were difficult or impossible by the original pen-based methods. Scaling up the computer-assisted approach to larger connectomes would require large armies of human operators. Alternatively, it may be possible to reduce human effort by automating most of the analysis. This will depend on advances in computer vision, a branch of artificial intelligence. In general, it has been difficult to make computers perform visual tasks with accuracy approaching that of humans, and the task of tracing neurons in 3D electron microscopic images is no exception. One promising approach is based on machine learning. Examples of the tracing tasks are collected from human experts, and a computer is trained to emulate these examples (Jain et al., 2007Jain, V., Murray, J.F., Roth, F., Turaga, S., Zhigulin, V., Briggman, K.L., Helmstaedter, M.N., Denk, W., and Seung, H.S. (2007). Supervised learning of image restoration with convolutional networks. IEEE 11th International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 1–8.Google Scholar, Andres et al., 2008Andres B. Köthe U. Helmstaedter M. Denk W. Hamprecht F.A. Segmentation of SBFSEM volume data of neural tissue by hierarchical classification.in: Rigoll G. Pattern Recognition: 30th DAGM Symposium. Springer, New York2008: 142-152Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Historically, the machine learning approach has prevailed in speech and image recognition. Most likely, it will also produce superior accuracy in the neuron tracing problem. The automation of image acquisition and analysis are crucial for speeding up the process of finding connectomes. At the present time, the spatial resolution and general quality of image acquisition is a prime concern. Once these problems are solved, the focus will turn to image analysis. There is still a long way to go before it becomes practical to find connectomes more complex than that of C. elegans, but there is reason to be optimistic. In time, technical progress will give rise to a new field called “connectomics,” dedicated to the high-throughput generation of data about neural connectivity and the mining of that data for knowledge about the brain (Lichtman and Sanes, 2008Lichtman J.W. Sanes J.R. Ome sweet ome: what can the genome tell us about the connectome?.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2008; 18: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). New methods for sparse and dense reconstruction of neural connectivity will find many applications in neuroscience. One important application will be to formulate and test pairwise models of connectivity, which associate a variable li with each neuron i. The probability of a connection from neuron j to neuron i isPr[Cij=1]=Φ(li,lj)(1) where Cij = 1 means that the i ← j connection exists. In effect, the function Φ specifies a set of rules of connection. I will call the variable li the cell label of neuron i. Since the point of the model is to relate connectivity to other quantities, cell labels include attributes of neurons other than their connectivity. The cell label could include the location of the cell body, the shape of the dendrite, and the projection targets of the axon, all part of the classical notion of cell type (Masland, 2004Masland R.H. Neuronal cell types.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R497-R500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Revisionists would prefer to define cell type based on other attributes, like gene expression, intrinsic firing properties, and synaptic properties (Markram et al., 2004Markram H. Toledo-Rodriguez M. Wang Y. Gupta A. Silberberg G. Wu C. Interneurons of the neocortical inhibitory system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar, Nelson et al., 2006Nelson S.B. Hempel C. Sugino K. Probing the transcriptome of neuronal cell types.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which could also enter in the cell label. In the classic approach, it's assumed that cell types have functional significance, even though they are defined morphologically (Masland, 2004Masland R.H. Neuronal cell types.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R497-R500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Neurophysiologists are expected to find that each cell type possesses a distinct and well-defined function. If indeed cell types have functional significance, then a pairwise model indirectly relates the connectivity of a neural network to its function. Neurophysiologists describe the encoding of information in neural activity using concepts like the preferred orientation of a neuron in primary visual cortex. Such attributes are functional properties of neurons and could also be included in the cell label. When cell labels contain functional properties, a pairwise model directly relates the connectivity of a neural network to its function. Cell type is generally considered to be a discrete quantity. In other words, neurons are assumed to fall into distinct clusters in some parametric space, though formal tests of this assumption have been scarce (Badea and Nathans, 2004Badea T.C. Nathans J. Quantitative analysis of neuronal morphologies in the mouse retina visualized by using a genetically directed reporter.J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 480: 331-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, Kong et al., 2005Kong J. Fish D.R. Rockhill R.L. Masland R.H. Diversity of ganglion cells in the mouse retina: Unsupervised morphological classification and its limits.J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 489: 293-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). There is no such restriction on cell labels: both discrete and continuous attributes are allowed. According to Equation 1, the rules of connection are probabilistic rather than deterministic, allowing for “sloppiness” in the connectivity. Here I have written a Bernoulli model in which the number of i ← j connections is either 0 or 1. An alternative is a Poisson model that allows multiple connections, in which case Φ would specify the mean of the Poisson distribution. The model can also be generalized to apply to analog strengths of synapses, in addition to binary connectivity. In the C. elegans nervous system, connectivity is trivially a function of classical cell type. Since neurons have unique names and can be identified based on its shape and location, every neuron can be regarded as its own cell type. In a pairwise model of connectivity, the cell labels are simply the names of the neurons. Alternatively, a slightly more compact model results from taking the cell label to be one of the 118 classes into which White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar divided the 302 neurons of the hermaphrodite worm (a left/right attribute would also be necessary). The cell types or classes of C. elegans neurons are structurally defined, but it turns out that they also have functional significance. Perusal of the online database http://www.wormatlas.org/neuroimageinterface.htm shows that researchers have successfully identified functions for many of the worm's neurons. The touch avoidance response is a good example. The worm responds to a gentle touch near the head or tail by swimming in the opposite direction. Motor neurons important for this behavior were identified by their connections to the dorsal and ventral body muscles used in swimming. Lesion studies using laser ablation of neurons or their precursors showed that some motoneurons are required for backward swimming, and others are required for forward swimming (Chalfie et al., 1985Chalfie M. Sulston J.E. White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The neural circuit for touch sensitivity in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 956-964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Candidate touch receptor neurons were identified by a genetic screen and confirmed by laser ablation studies (Chalfie and Sulston, 1981Chalfie M. Sulston J. Developmental genetics of the mechanosensory neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans.Dev. Biol. 1981; 82: 358-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Interneurons were identified on the basis of their connections to both sensory and motor neurons. Laser ablation studies showed that some were specialized for forward motion, whereas others were specialized for backward motion (Chalfie et al., 1985Chalfie M. Sulston J.E. White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The neural circuit for touch sensitivity in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 956-964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these studies, the researchers used the connectome to formulate hypotheses about neuronal function, which were then tested using laser ablation. This strategy for relating structure to function was later applied to work out the neural basis of other behaviors, such as feeding (Avery and Horvitz, 1989Avery L. Horvitz H.R. Pharyngeal pumping continues after laser killing of the pharyngeal nervous system of C. elegans.Neuron. 1989; 3: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and navigation (Gray et al., 2005Gray J.M. Hill J.J. Bargmann C.I. A circuit for navigation in Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 3184-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). In more complex nervous systems than C. elegans, the number of cell types is much less than the number of neurons. This is especially the case in neural systems with a repeated, columnar organization. For example, the compound eye of the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus is composed of about 1000 repeated units called ommatidia, each of which receives visual input from a particular direction (reviewed by Ratliff, 1965Ratliff F. Mach Bands: Quantitative Studies on Neural Networks in the Retina. Holden-Day, San Francisco1965Google Scholar, Hartline and Ratliff, 1972Hartline H.K. Ratliff F. Inhibitory interaction in the retina of Limulus.in: Fuortes M.G.F. Handbook of Sensory Physiology. Physiology of Photoreceptor Organs, Volume VII/2. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1972: 381-447Crossref Google Scholar). Most ommatidia contain a single eccentric cell that sends action potentials through the optic nerve to the brain. The axon collaterals of eccentric cells appear to form an interconnected plexus that mediates inhibitory interactions. Hartline, Ratliff, and their collaborators devised a pairwise model of these inhibitory connections, based on neurophysiological measurements. According to the model, the interactions depend on the separation between cells, but not on th"

Non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs), which represent around 80% of lung tumors, exhibit poor prognosis and are usually refractory to conventional chemotherapy. Elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms that are dysregulated in NSCLCs may lead to new possibilities for targeted therapy or enhanced efficacy of current therapies. Here we demonstrate Wnt pathway activation in around 50% of human NSCLC cell lines and primary tumors, through different mechanisms, including autocrine Wnt pathway activation involving upregulation of specific Wnt ligands. Downregulation of activated Wnt signaling inhibited NSCLC proliferation and induced a more differentiated phenotype. Together, our findings establish importance of activated Wnt signaling in human NSCLCs and offer the possibility of targeting upregulated Wnt signaling as a new therapeutic modality for this disease."

Our results indicate that corticogeniculate feedback in the primate is stream specific, and provide strong evidence in support of the view that corticothalamic feedback can influence the transmission of sensory information from the thalamus to the cortex in a stream-selective manner."

https://openalex.org/W2059018336,"In reverberant environments, acoustic reflections interfere with the direct sound arriving at a listener's ears, distorting the spatial cues for sound localization. Yet, human listeners have little difficulty localizing sounds in most settings. Because reverberant energy builds up over time, the source location is represented relatively faithfully during the early portion of a sound, but this representation becomes increasingly degraded later in the stimulus. We show that the directional sensitivity of single neurons in the auditory midbrain of anesthetized cats follows a similar time course, although onset dominance in temporal response patterns results in more robust directional sensitivity than expected, suggesting a simple mechanism for improving directional sensitivity in reverberation. In parallel behavioral experiments, we demonstrate that human lateralization judgments are consistent with predictions from a population rate model decoding the observed midbrain responses, suggesting a subcortical origin for robust sound localization in reverberant environments."

In cerebellar Purkinje cells, climbing fiber synapses provide an instructive signal for plasticity at parallel fiber synapses. Here, we show that noradrenaline activates α2-adrenergic receptors to control short-term and long-term associative plasticity of parallel fiber synapses. This regulation of plasticity does not reflect a conventional direct modulation of the postsynaptic Purkinje cell or presynaptic parallel fibers. Instead, noradrenaline reduces associative plasticity by selectively decreasing the probability of release at the climbing fiber synapse, which in turn decreases climbing fiber-evoked dendritic calcium signals.

Associative synaptic plasticity is a candidate substrate for the formation of real-world associations (Hebb, 1949Hebb D.O. The Organization of Behavior. John Wiley & Sons, New York1949Google Scholar). Synaptic plasticity typically requires precisely timed coactivation of a presynaptic input with postsynaptic events including depolarization and elevation of dendritic calcium (Abbott and Nelson, 2000Abbott L.F.

Much less is known about whether associative plasticity can be controlled by modulating instructive synaptic inputs. Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) are well suited to studying the role of instructive synapses in the regulation of associative plasticity. PCs receive two very different classes of excitatory inputs: weak synaptic inputs from roughly 100,000 granule cell parallel fibers (PFs) (Eccles et al., 1966bEccles J.C. Llinas R. Sasaki K. Parallel fibre stimulation and the responses induced thereby in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum.Exp. Brain Res. 1966; 1: 17-39PubMed Google Scholar) and a strong synaptic input from a single climbing fiber (CF) (Eccles et al., 1966aEccles J.C. Llinas R. Sasaki K. The excitatory synaptic action of climbing fibres on the purinje cells of the cerebellum.J. Physiol. 1966; 182: 268-296PubMed Google Scholar). The CF provides an important instructive signal that controls the induction of associative plasticity at the PF synapse and which is thought to be important for motor learning (Gilbert and Thach, 1977Gilbert P.F. Thach W.T. Purkinje cell activity during motor learning.Brain Res. 1977; 128: 309-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, Kitazawa et al., 1998Kitazawa S. Kimura T. Yin P.B.

Lisberger S.G. Neural learning rules for the vestibulo-ocular reflex.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9112-9129PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the CF synapse elicits a characteristic postsynaptic complex spike that elevates calcium throughout PC dendrites (Schmolesky et al., 2002Schmolesky M.T. Weber J.T. De Zeeuw C.I. Hansel C. The making of a complex spike: ionic composition and plasticity.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2002; 978: 359-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Activation of PFs followed by complex spikes within several hundred milliseconds leads to rapid synaptic suppression resulting from endocannabinoid release from PCs and retrograde activation of type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptors (Brenowitz and Regehr, 2005Brenowitz S.D. Regehr W.G. Associative short-term synaptic plasticity mediated by endocannabinoids.Neuron. 2005; 45: 419-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Repetition of this stimulus for minutes induces cerebellar long-term depression (LTD) of PF synapses onto PCs (Ito, 2001Ito M.

Rev. 2001; 81: 1143-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, Safo and Regehr, 2005Safo P.K. Regehr W.G. Endocannabinoids control the induction of cerebellar LTD.Neuron. 2005; 48: 647-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that altering the strength of CF inputs to PCs can provide a way to control the induction of associative plasticity (Coesmans et al., 2004Coesmans M. Weber J.T.

Bidirectional parallel fiber plasticity in the cerebellum under climbing fiber control.Neuron. 2004; 44: 691-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), but the circumstances under which such regulation might occur remain unclear. The cerebellum receives monoaminergic inputs from neuromodulatory centers throughout the brain. They, together with mossy fibers and CFs, comprise the three classes of cerebellar afferent input, and are a relatively poorly understood element of the cerebellar circuitry (Schweighofer et al., 2004Schweighofer N.

Here we ask whether neuromodulation can control the induction of associative plasticity through selective regulation of instructive signals conveyed to Purkinje cells by climbing fibers. We find that noradrenaline acts through α2-adrenergic receptors to decrease the probability of release at the CF synapse. This in turn decreases CF-evoked dendritic calcium transients and interferes with the induction of short-term and long-term associative plasticity of PF synapses. We conclude that noradrenaline controls synaptic plasticity of PF synapses through selective regulation of instructive signals, thereby providing a mechanism that could allow for dynamic, context-dependent regulation of learning. We examined synaptic responses in Purkinje cells by making whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings with a Cs-based internal solution to minimize the contributions of active postsynaptic conductances. Climbing fibers were stimulated with pairs of stimuli separated by 30 ms. In control conditions, CF-EPSCs exhibited marked paired-pulse depression as previously described (Eccles et al., 1966aEccles J.C. Llinas R. Sasaki K. The excitatory synaptic action of climbing fibres on the purinje cells of the cerebellum.J. Physiol. 1966; 182: 268-296PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of noradrenaline (NA; 5 μM) on the CF-EPSC are shown (Figure 1A). NA decreased the EPSC amplitude and increased the paired-pulse ratio by 29% ± 5% (n = 6, p < 0.01) and 32% ± 3% respectively (n = 6, p < 0.01; Figure 1B). This decrease in paired-pulse depression is consistent with NA acting presynaptically to decrease the probability of release at the CF synapse (Foster and Regehr, 2004Foster K.A. Regehr W.G.

We used selective agonists and antagonists to pharmacologically characterize the involvement of various adrenergic receptors in modulating CF-EPSCs. α1, α2, and β adrenergic receptors are expressed in cerebellum (Nicholas et al., 1996Nicholas A.P.

Sci. 1996; 17: 245-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that β adrenergic receptors can modulate PC output through direct postsynaptic effects on PCs (Hoffer et al., 1971Hoffer B.J. Siggins G.R. Bloom F.E.

Beta-1 adrenergic receptors mediate noradrenergic facilitation of Purkinje cell responses to gamma-aminobutyric acid in cerebellum of rat.Neuropharmacology. 1983; 22: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We found that the α2-receptor agonist UK14304 mimicked the effects of noradrenaline and the α2-receptor antagonist yohimbine reversed the effects of noradrenaline on the amplitude and paired-pulse ratio of CF-EPSCs (Figures 1C and 1D). UK14304 reduced EPSC amplitude and paired-pulse depression to a similar extent as NA (26% ± 4% decrease in EPSC1 and a 36% ± 4% increase in PPR, n = 5, p = 0.87; Figure 1D). In contrast, application of the α1 and β-adrenergic receptor agonists phenylephrine and isoproterenol (10 μM each) did not affect EPSC amplitude or paired-pulse ratio (Figures 1G and 1H). Thus, the decrease in probability of release at CF synapses by noradrenaline is mediated by α2-adrenergic receptors. Previously described modulators of the CF synapse, including activation of mGluRs, CB1Rs, adenosine receptors, and GABABRs, lack specificity, modulating PF-PC inputs to an even larger degree (Glaum et al., 1992Glaum S.R.

Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5693-5702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A previous study using field recordings in mice has suggested that α2-receptor activation can cause a small (up to 18% with 100 μM NA) reduction of PF synapses (Zhou et al., 2003Zhou Y.D. Turner T.J. Dunlap K. Enhanced G protein-dependent modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission in the cerebellum of the Ca2+ channel-mutant mouse, tottering.J. Physiol. 2003; 547: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether the adrenergic modulation of CF-EPSCs we observe was specific to climbing fibers, or whether parallel fiber-to-Purkinje cell synapses were also subject to this modulation. We assessed the effects of α2-receptor activation on PF synapses in voltage-clamp with a Cs-based internal solution, and found that neither NA nor yohimbine significantly altered the amplitude or paired-pulse ratio of PF-EPSCs (Figures 1E–1H). Neuromodulators can either act directly or indirectly to modulate transmission (Maejima et al., 2001Maejima T. Hashimoto K. Yoshida T. Aiba A. Kano M.

Regehr W.G. Cholinergic modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission in the CA3 area of the hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 75-83PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether activation of α2-adrenergic receptors indirectly modulated release at CF synapses through other signaling systems and receptors (Hashimoto and Kano, 1998Hashimoto K.

Pre- and postsynaptic determinants of EPSC waveform at cerebellar climbing fiber and parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapses.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5693-5702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coapplication of antagonists of group l and II mGluRs, GABABRs, adenosine A1Rs, and cannabinoid CB1Rs (MCPG, 500 μM; CGP 55845A, 2 μM; DPCPX, 5 μM; AM251, 5 μM) did not affect the ability of NA to decrease the EPSC and alter paired-pulse plasticity (Figures 1G and 1H; 36% ± 4% suppression in blockers versus 29% ± 5% in control, n = 7, p = 0.31). This indicates that noradrenaline does not act indirectly in a manner that requires the activation of any of these signaling systems and is consistent with noradrenaline decreasing the probability of release by acting directly on CF terminals. Together, these findings (Figure 1) indicate that NA selectively decreases the amplitude and increases the PPR of CF-EPSCs by activating α2-receptors. The decrease in paired-pulse depression of CF-EPSCs is consistent with α2-adrenergic receptors acting presynaptically to decrease transmitter release (Foster and Regehr, 2004Foster K.A. Regehr W.G.

Noradrenaline increases high-frequency firing at the calyx of held synapse during development by inhibiting glutamate release.J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 87: 2297-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, transmission at the powerful CF synapse is influenced by postsynaptic saturation of AMPA receptors, which could potentially make it difficult to distinguish between postsynaptic and presynaptic sites of modulation (Wadiche and Jahr, 2001Wadiche J.I. Jahr C.E. Multivesicular release at climbing fiber-Purkinje cell synapses.Neuron. 2001; 32: 301-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). We therefore used two additional approaches to further investigate the mechanism of noradrenergic suppression of the CF synapse. First, we used the rapid, low affinity AMPA receptor antagonist DGG to relieve postsynaptic receptor saturation and provide a more accurate readout of presynaptic glutamate release (Wadiche and Jahr, 2001Wadiche J.I. Jahr C.E. Multivesicular release at climbing fiber-Purkinje cell synapses.Neuron. 2001; 32: 301-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar; Foster et al., 2002Foster K.A.

Interaction of postsynaptic receptor saturation with presynaptic mechanisms produces a reliable synapse.Neuron. 2002; 36: 1115-1126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). When NA was applied in the presence of DGG, we found that CF-EPSCs were more strongly suppressed by NA than in control conditions (Figures 2A and 2B versus Figures 1A and 1B; 42% ± 5% suppression in DGG versus 29% ± 5%, suppression in control, n = 7). Similarly, NA increased the paired-pulse ratio to a larger extent in DGG compared to control (60% ± 6% increase in DGG versus 32% ± 3% increase in control). The greater effect of NA in the presence of DGG suggests that NA causes a presynaptic decrease in glutamate release. Interestingly, in the presence of DGG, the α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine not only blocked the effect of NA but caused an enhancement of synaptic transmission relative to control conditions (Figure 2B). This finding is consistent with the observation that by relieving saturation, DGG unmasks the effects of modulators that increase release at the high-p CF synapse (Foster et al., 2002Foster K.A. Kreitzer A.C. Regehr W.G. Interaction of postsynaptic receptor saturation with presynaptic mechanisms produces a reliable synapse.Neuron. 2002; 36: 1115-1126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The enhancement of CF synaptic strength in yohimbine could be due to inverse agonist properties of the drug (Murrin et al., 2000Murrin L.C. Gerety M.E. Happe H.K. Bylund D.B. Inverse agonism at alpha(2)-adrenoceptors in native tissue.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 398: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or tonic α2-receptor activation in control conditions. Second, to further distinguish between presynaptic and postsynaptic effects of NA at the CF synapse, we measured the effect of NA on miniature CF-EPSC amplitude and frequency. To do this, we replaced the calcium in our extracellular recording solution with strontium (Figures 2C–2G). In the presence of strontium, vesicles are released asynchronously (Miledi, 1966Miledi R.

J. 1999; 76: 2029-2042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The prolongation of release in response to a CF stimulus allows us to isolate CF-mEPSCs from PF-mEPSCs and measure amplitude and frequency of miniature CF synaptic events (Otis et al., 1997Otis T.S. Kavanaugh M.P. Jahr C.E. Postsynaptic glutamate transport at the climbing fiber-Purkinje cell synapse.Science. 1997; 277: 1515-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In the presence of Sr, NA greatly reduced the evoked EPSC amplitude (Figure 2C) and the frequency of CF-mEPSCs (Figure 2D, red versus black; Figure 2G; 64% ± 10% reduction in mini frequency), but did not affect the amplitude of CF-mEPSCs (Figures 2E–2G; 0% ± 1% change, p = 0.72, paired t test). This suggests that NA acts presynaptically to reduce mEPSC frequency and does not affect the postsynaptic sensitivity of AMPA receptors. Further, because of the reduction in synchronous release together with the fact that strontium is less effective than calcium at driving transmitter release overall (Xu-Friedman and Regehr, 2000Xu-Friedman M.A. Regehr W.G. Probing fundamental aspects of synaptic transmission with strontium.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4414-4422PubMed Google Scholar), strontium relieves both presynaptic and postsynaptic saturation at the CF synapse (Foster et al., 2002Foster K.A. Kreitzer A.C. Regehr W.G.

https://openalex.org/W1971480400,"Long-chain acyl-acyl carrier proteins (acyl-ACP) are established biochemical regulators of bacterial type II fatty acid synthases due to their ability to feedback-inhibit the early steps in the biosynthetic pathway. In Streptococcus pneumoniae, the expression of the fatty acid synthase (fab) genes is controlled by a helix-turn-helix transcriptional repressor called FabT. A screen of pathway intermediates identified acyl-ACP as a ligand that increased the affinity of FabT for DNA. FabT bound to a wide range of acyl-ACP chain lengths in the absence of DNA, but only the long-chain acyl-ACPs increase the affinity of FabT for DNA. FabT affinity for DNA increased with increasing acyl-ACP chain length with cis-vaccenoyl-ACP being the most effective ligand. Thus, FabT is a new ACP-interacting partner that acts as a transcriptional rheostat to fine tune the expression of the fab genes based on the demand for fatty acids."

By heterologous expression in E. coli, Na+/H+ exchange activities could be shown for NhaS1–5 (5Hamada A. Hibino T. Nakamura T. Takabe T. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 6Inaba M. Sakamoto A. Murata N. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1376-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Inactivation of nhaS1 and nhaS2 results in retardation of growth of Synechocystis (5Hamada A. Hibino T. Nakamura T. Takabe T. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 6Inaba M. Sakamoto A. Murata N. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1376-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It has been reported that in these mutants the concentration of Na+ in cytosol and intrathylakoid space (lumen) increases and impairs the photosynthetic and/or respiratory activity of the cell (9Allakhverdiev S.I. Nishiyama Y. Suzuki I. Tasaka Y. Murata N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5862-5867Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 10Allakhverdiev S.I. Sakamoto A. Nishiyama Y. Inaba M. Murata N. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Therefore the Na+ extrusion by Synechocystis Na+/H+ antiporters similar to E. coli NhaA, NhaB, and ChaA is essential for the adaptation to salinity stress. In contrast to the case in E. coli, Na+ is an essential element for the growth of some cyanobacteria (11Miller A.G. Turpin D.H. Canvin D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 100-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kaplan A. Scherer S. Lerner M. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 1220-1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Na+/H+ antiporter homolog NhaS4 was identified as an uptake system for Na+ from the medium during a screen for mutations in Synechocystis that result in lack of growth at low Na+ concentrations (7Mikkat S. Milkowski C. Hagemann M. Plant Cell Environ. 2000; 23: 549-559Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The requirement of a Na+ uptake antiporter for cell growth is consistent with the physiology of Synechocystis. Specifically, photoautotrophic bacteria like cyanobacteria share some components (plastoquinone, cytochrome b6f, and c6) of the thylakoid membrane for electron transport for both photophosphorylation and respiratory oxidative phosphorylation. Na+/H+ antiporters therefore may coordinate both H+ and Na+ gradients across the plasma and thylakoid membranes to adapt to daily environmental changes (11Miller A.G. Turpin D.H. Canvin D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 100-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether the six Na+/H+ antiporters are localized to the plasma membrane or to the thylakoid membrane in Synechocystis. Information on the membrane localization will also provide information on the physiological role in Synechocystis. In this study, we explored the membrane localization of NhaS3, the role of specific amino acid residues for its function, and the effect of CO2 concentration and circadian rhythms on the expression pattern of nhaS3 to gain insight into the physiological role of NhaS3 in Synechocystis. Synechocystis cells were grown at 30 °C in BG11 medium (13Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) containing 20 mm TES-KOH 3The abbreviation used is: TES2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid. (pH 8.0) and bubbled with either 2% CO2 in air (v/v) or air alone (0.035% v/v CO2). Solid medium contained BG11 buffered at pH 8.0, 1.5% agar, and 0.3% sodium thiosulfate. Continuous illumination was provided by fluorescent lamps (50 μmol of photons m−2 s−1; 400–700 nm). To test the activation of expression of the nhaS3 promoter-luciferase fusions (see below), cells grown under low CO2 conditions (0.035% v/v CO2) were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min at 30 °C, washed with fresh growth medium to remove dissolved CO2, and inoculated into fresh medium that was aerated with air containing 2% (v/v) CO2. Control cells were kept at 0.035% (v/v CO2). 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid. For heterologous expression in E. coli, the nhaS3 (sll0689) gene was isolated from chromosomal DNA by PCR using KpnI site-containing forward primer 5′-ATAGGTACCAGGAGGGAAAAGAATGTTTATGAACCCAT-3′ and SalI site-containing reverse primer 5′-AAAGTCGACCTAATCTGGGGTGGGAAC-3′. The KpnI-SalI DNA fragment was ligated into the corresponding sites in pPAB404 (14Buurman E.T. Kim K.T. Epstein W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6678-6685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and the resulting plasmid was used to transform E. coli strain LB2003, which lacks the three K+ uptake systems (15Stumpe S. Bakker E.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), or E. coli strain TO114, which lacks the three Na+ extrusion type Na+/H+ antiporters (4Ohyama T. Igarashi K. Kobayashi H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4311-4315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth tests of the transformed strains were carried out as described previously (16Matsuda N. Kobayashi H.

For replacement of NhaS3 with E. coli NhaA in Synechocystis, the E. coli nhaA gene was cloned behind the iron-transporter promoter in a plasmid containing the spectinomycin resistance gene (18Katoh H.

For disruption of nhaS3, the kanamycin resistance gene was amplified by PCR using HpaI site-containing forward primer 5′-CAGTGTTAACAAAGCCACGTTGTGTCTC-3′ and HpaI site-containing reverse primer 5′-CAGTGTTAACGCGCTGAGGTCTGCCTCG-3′. The HpaI-digested DNA fragment was inserted into the EcoRV site in the middle of the nhaS3 gene of the nhaA-expressing strain. For generation of the NhaS3 knockdown strain, the same HpaI-digested DNA fragment was inserted into the EcoRV site in the middle of the nhaS3 gene of wild type Synechocystis. For generation of nhaS3-overexpressing Synechocystis, the full-length coding sequence of NhaS3 was amplified by PCR using NdeI site-containing forward primer 5′-CGGCATATGATGTTTATGAACCCATTG-3′ and SalI site-containing reverse primer 5′-AAGTCGACCTAATCTGGGGTGGGAAC-3′. The NdeI-SalI DNA fragment was ligated into the corresponding sites in p68TS4OxCm4 and inserted by homologous recombination into targeting site 4 of the chromosomal DNA of Synechocystis (16Matsuda N.

This vector contains the inducible trc promoter. Expression of nhaS3 was induced by the addition of 0.25 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the medium. Thylakoid and plasma membranes were prepared from Synechocystis cells as described previously (19Norling B. Zak E. Andersson B. Pakrasi H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). An anti-NhaS3 antibody was raised against synthetic peptides with the two sequences NH2-LAEINRLSSNEGQI-COOH and NH2-KKEEAPEKPVPTPD-COOH (Operon Biotechnologies, Japan). Polyclonal antibodies raised against the plasma membrane nitrate transporter NrtA (20Omata T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or against the thylakoid membrane proteins NdhD3 and NdhF3 (21Zhang P. Battchikova N. Jansen T. Appel J. Ogawa T. Aro E.M. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3326-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) were used to identify they Synechocystis plasma membrane, or thylakoid membrane fractions, respectively. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10 or 12% polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated for 1 h with primary antibody (1:1000 in blocking buffer) and were then incubated for 30 min with the secondary antibody with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000; Amersham Biosciences) and subsequently subjected to chemiluminescence detection (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Synechocystis cells grown to an optical density of about 1.2 in BG11 medium were frozen and then fixed with anhydrous acetone containing 1% glutaraldehyde at −80 °C. The samples were warmed and embedded in LR White resin as described (22Toyooka K. Moriyasu Y. Goto Y. Takeuchi M. Fukuda H. Matsuoka K. Autophagy. 2006; 2: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Ultra-thin sections were first labeled with the IgG fraction of NhaS3 antiserum (1:20) in Tris-buffered saline and then with 12-nm colloidal gold particles coupled to goat anti-rabbit IgG. IgG fractions were purified from the NhaS3 or preimmune serum using the MelonTM Gel IgG Spin Purification Kit (Pierce). The sections were stained with uranyl acetate and examined with a 1010EX transmission electron microscope (JEOL) at 80 kV as described (22Toyooka K. Moriyasu Y. Goto Y. Takeuchi M. Fukuda H. Matsuoka K. Autophagy. 2006; 2: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A 1000-bp nhaS3 promoter sequence was fused to the bacterial luciferase gene set luxAB at the BglII and NdeI sites of p68TS1ΩLuxAB(+)PLNK,4 and the construct was inserted into the TS1 region in Synechocystis chromosomal DNA (23Kucho K. Aoki K. Itoh S. Ishiura M. Genes Genet. Syst. 2005; 80: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Bioluminescence from cells grown on the solid BG11 medium was measured as described previously (24Onai K. Morishita M. Itoh S. Okamoto K. Ishiura M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4972-4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Okamoto K. Onai K. Furusawa T. Ishiura M. Plant Cell Environ. 2005; 28: 1305-1315Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26Okamoto K. Onai K. Ishiura M. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 340: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The selected cells were cultured in liquid BG11 medium at 30 °C under 91 μmol of white light illumination m−2 s−1 with bubbling of air and stirring. The optical density of the culture at 730 nm was maintained at ∼0.35 by dilution with fresh BG11 medium. To entrain the circadian clock, the culture was placed in darkness for 12 h and then kept under constant light conditions. Bioluminescence was measured every hour. The preparation of E. coli membrane vesicles was carried out as described previously (27Kuroda T. Shimamoto T. Inaba K. Tsuda M. Tsuchiya T. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Na+/H+ antiporter activity was measured by the acridine orange fluorescence quenching method (27Kuroda T. Shimamoto T. Inaba K. Tsuda M. Tsuchiya T. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) at 25 °C in an assay mixture (2 ml) in the buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 140 mm choline chloride, 5 mm MgSO4, 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol) supplemented with 1 μm acridine orange. The membrane vesicles equal to 50 μg of protein were added to the assay mixture. Tris-dl-lactate (2 mm) was added to initiate fluorescence quenching caused by respiration. Changes in fluorescence were monitored after the addition of 5 mm NaCl. Then 20 ml of 5% Triton X-100 were added to dissipate the pH gradient across the membrane. Fluorescence emission was monitored at 530 nm with excitation at 495 nm. K+ uptake by E. coli was measured at described previously (16Matsuda N. Kobayashi H. Katoh H. Ogawa T. Futatsugi L. Nakamura T. Bakker E.P. Uozumi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54952-54962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The cells expressing nhaS3 or containing the empty vector were incubated with 1 mm KCl in HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm glucose, and aliquots were withdrawn at the times indicated in Fig. 3. The cellular K+ content was determined by flame photometry. Previously it had been reported that NhaS3 is an essential gene in Synechocystis 6803 (6Inaba M. Sakamoto A. Murata N. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1376-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 8Elanskaya I.V. Karandashova I.V. Bogachev A.V. Hagemann M. Biochemistry. 2002; 67: 432-440PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise our attempts to construct a null mutant of nhaS3 were also not successful (see Fig. 5). In contrast, in E. coli even disruption of all three Na+/H+ antiporter genes is not lethal. Based on these observations we hypothesized that NhaS3 may have additional unknown characteristics. To test this hypothesis, we tried to replace nhaS3 in Synechocystis with the E. coli nhaA gene encoding a plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiporter (28Goldberg E.B. Arbel T. Chen J. Karpel R. Mackie G.A. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2615-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 29Karpel R. Olami Y. Taglicht D. Schuldiner S. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10408-10414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a first step nhaA was introduced into the Synechocystis genome (Fig. 1A). Next, nhaS3 was disrupted in this background by insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette, and recovery of a fully segregated mutant of nhaS3 expressing E. coli nhaA was attempted. PCR analysis of kanamycin-resistant cells showed that nhaS3 was not fully disrupted by the kanamycin resistance gene because of the incomplete segregation of chromosomes (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that nhaA cannot replace nhaS3 functionally.FIGURE 1Introduction of E. coli nhaA into Synechocystis. A, E. coli nhaA under control of the iron-inducible promoter was introduced at a site between slr0370 and sll0337 of Synechocystis chromosome (left panel). During growth in BG11 medium, nhaA is constitutively expressed. Correct insertion of the expression construct was confirmed by PCR on genomic DNA using specific primers a and b; the results are shown in the right panel. WT, wild type; +nhaA, nhaA-expressing cells; Spe, spectinomycin resistance gene. B, disruption of nhaS3 in the strain expressing E. coli nhaA was performed by insertion of the kanamycin resistance gene (Km) into nhaS3. Correct integration of the kanamycin gene was tested by PCR on genomic DNA using specific primers c and d. The results for four independent clones and WT are shown in the right panel. Note that nhaA could not replace nhaS3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The finding that E. coli nhaA cannot substitute for nhaS3 (Fig. 1) suggested that NhaS3 might differ from E. coli NhaA with respect to its activity and/or subcellular localization. We therefore performed immunolocalization experiments using anti-NhaS3 antibodies to determine the subcellular localization of NhaS3. Membrane fractions of thylakoid and plasma membranes were prepared by aqueous polymer two-phase partitioning followed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (19Norling B. Zak E. Andersson B. Pakrasi H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, a single protein band of the corresponding molecular mass of NhaS3 was found in the thylakoid membrane fraction, which was identified by the presence of the thylakoid membrane marker proteins NdhD3 and NdhF3 (21Zhang P. Battchikova N. Jansen T. Appel J. Ogawa T. Aro E.M. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3326-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 30Ohkawa H. Price G.D. Badger M.R. Ogawa T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2591-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Only a weak signal for NhaS3 was found in the plasma membrane fraction, which was identified by the presence of the nitrate transporter NrtA (20Omata T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This indicated that NhaS3 was localized in the thylakoid membrane in Synechocystis. In addition, the subcellular localization of the NhaS3 protein was analyzed by immunogold labeling followed by electron microscopy. A cross-section of wild type Synechocystis cells grown under standard conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) showed gold particles decorating the thylakoid membrane when the IgG fraction of NhaS3 antiserum was used (Fig. 2, B and C). Only a small amount of the label was found on the plasma membrane or in other locations. Control experiments with IgG fraction of preimmune serum did not show any significant labeling (data not shown). These results indicate that NhaS3 is associated with the thylakoid membrane fraction (Fig. 2A). The activity of NhaS3 may be influenced by the proton gradient formed through respiration or photosynthesis across the thylakoid membrane. In E. coli, three Na+/H+ antiporters, NhaA, NhaB, and ChaA, show different pH dependence from each other and also have different physiological roles (31Shijuku T. Saito H. Kakegawa T. Kobayashi H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1506: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 32Shijuku T. Yamashino T. Ohashi H. Saito H. Kakegawa T. Ohta M. Kobayashi H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In Synechocystis it has been reported that NhaS3 has antiporter activity at pH 8.5 (6Inaba M. Sakamoto A. Murata N. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1376-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), but its detailed properties remain to be studied. To measure the pH dependence of NhaS3, E. coli strain TO114, which possesses low Na+/H+ exchange activity, was used as a host (4Ohyama T. Igarashi K. Kobayashi H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4311-4315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inverted membrane vesicles were prepared from E. coli TO114 cells transformed with plasmids encoding NhaS3 or NhaA or the empty plasmid pPAB404. Transport activities were assessed by measuring the dequenching of acridine orange fluorescence upon the addition of 5 mm NaCl at different pH values (Fig. 3A). E. coli NhaA had a peak of activity at pH 8.0 and 8.5, which is consistent with the pH profile of NhaA previously reported (33Inoue H. Sakurai T. Ujike S. Tsuchiya T. Murakami H. Kanazawa H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast, NhaS3 showed a similar level of activity across the entire pH spectrum tested (pH 6.5–9.0). This indicates that NhaS3 activity is pH-independent. Na+/H+ antiporter activities affect K+ transport across the membrane and the balance of the cytosolic Na+/K+ concentration ratio (34Serrano R. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 35Shi H. Quintero F.J. Pardo J.M. Zhu J.K. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 36Venema K. Belver A. Marin-Manzano M.C. Rodríguez-Rosales M.P. Donaire J.P. J. Biol.

A. 2003; 100: 12510-12515Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To test the influence of NhaS3 on K+ uptake, it was expressed in an E. coli strain, LB2003, lacking three major K+ uptake systems and unable to grow at low K+ concentrations (15Stumpe S. Bakker E.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). NhaS3 restored growth of the LB2003 strain at low K+ concentrations (10 mm) (Fig. 3B). Under the same conditions, expression of the Synechocystis K+ uptake system, KtrABE (16Matsuda N. Kobayashi H. Katoh H. Ogawa T. Futatsugi L. Nakamura T. Bakker E.P. Uozumi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54952-54962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which was used as a positive control, rescued the mutant. No growth was observed with the empty vector alone. Although the initial net K+ uptake of the cells expressing NhaS3 was higher than that of the cells containing the empty vector (Fig. 3C), NhaS3 did not show K+/H+ exchange activity (Fig. 3D). The measurement was performed under conditions where NhaS3 showed Li+/H+ as well as Na+/H+ antiporter activities, but no Mg2+/H+ antiporter activity (Fig. 3D). These data indicate that NhaS3 either functions as a K+ uptake transporter or that Na+ extrusion mediated by NhaS3 may indirectly increase the influx of K+ into the cells. NhaS3 may contribute to maintaining the balance of the cytosolic Na+/K+ ratio. In the NhaA antiporter protein negatively charged residues in the hydrophobic transmembrane domains play a crucial role for Na+ or H+ electrostatic interaction and ion transport function (3Hunte C. Screpanti E. Venturi M. Rimon A. Padan E. Michel H. Nature. 2005; 435: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Two aspartates, corresponding to Asp217 and Asp218 in NhaS3, are proposed to be the ion binding site in NhaS3 (3Hunte C. Screpanti E. Venturi M. Rimon A. Padan E. Michel H. Nature. 2005; 435: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Another negatively charged residue, glutamate (Glu402), is located in the eleventh hydrophobic domain of NhaS3 but is not conserved in the other Synechocystis Na+/H+ antiporters or in E. coli NhaA (supplemental Fig. S1). To test the role of these charged residues in the transport function of NhaS3, mutant versions of NhaS3 were generated. In these mutant proteins single negatively charged residues (Asp or Glu) were replaced by either a neutral nonpolar residue (alanine) or a neutral polar residue (asparagine or glutamine). The mutant proteins were then expressed in E. coli, and their antiporter activity was determined by fluorescence dequenching in membrane vesicles (Fig. 4A). Amino acid substitutions at Asp217, Asp218, and Glu402 abolished the transport activities of NhaS3 regardless of the replacing amino acid. The protein expression levels of these NhaS3 variants that caused loss of transport activity were verified by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 4B). There was no difference in the amount of protein present, indicating that the loss of activity was not caused by a lack of protein. The lower bands seen on the blots are most likely degradation products of the full-length protein (upper band). Based on data available for NhaA (3Hunte C. Screpanti E. Venturi M. Rimon A. Padan E. Michel H. Nature. 2005; 435: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), Asp217, Asp218, and Glu402 are likely to be part of the structure for translocation of Na+/H+. Replacement of Asp99, Glu114, Glu121, and Glu359 caused a marked decrease in the activities only in the case of one of the substituted amino acids (Fig. 4B). In these cases the replacement of the residues affected the transport activity, but the results suggest that they may not be essential for binding or translocation of cations. These results show that the conserved negative residues Asp217 and Asp218 in NhaS3 have the same function as their counterparts in NhaA, which provides further evidence that NhaS3 functions as a Na+/H+ antiporter. Based on the above data on NhaS3-mediated Na+ transport activities, we examined whether NhaS3 contributes to the cellular ion homeostasis in response to environmental stress. It was tested whether the amount of NhaS3 affects the stress tolerance of Synechocystis. An nhaS3 knockdown strain was obtained by insertion of kanamycin resistance gene into nhaS3 (Fig. 5A). The decrease in NhaS3 protein was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 5C). A Synechocystis strain overexpressing nhaS3 was generated by integration of a copy of nhaS3 under control of the inducible trc promoter (Fig. 5B). Overexpression of nhaS3 and the increased presence of the NhaS3 protein was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 5C). Both knockdown cells and cells overexpressing nhaS3 were grown under conditions of salinity stress and hyperosmotic stress (Fig. 5, D and E). The nhaS3 knockdown strain grew less well on solid or liquid medium supplemented with either 500 mm NaCl or 500 mm sorbitol when compared with the growth of wild type or overexpressor. This suggests that NhaS3 contributes to the osmoadaptation of Synechocystis. Overexpression of NhaS3 did not increase the salt or osmotolerance of the cells. In wild type cells the amount"

https://openalex.org/W2017887404,"In single neurons, glutamatergic synapses receiving distinct afferent inputs may contain AMPA receptors (-Rs) with unique subunit compositions. However, the cellular mechanisms by which differential receptor transport achieves this synaptic diversity remain poorly understood. In lateral geniculate neurons, we show that retinogeniculate and corticogeniculate synapses have distinct AMPA-R subunit compositions. Under basal conditions at both synapses, GluR1-containing AMPA-Rs are transported from an anatomically defined reserve pool to a deliverable pool near the postsynaptic density (PSD), but further incorporate into the PSD or functional synaptic pool only at retinogeniculate synapses. Vision-dependent activity, stimulation mimicking retinal input, or activation of CaMKII or Ras signaling regulated forward GluR1 trafficking from the deliverable pool to the synaptic pool at both synapses, whereas Rap2 signals reverse GluR1 transport at retinogeniculate synapses. These findings suggest that synapse-specific AMPA-R delivery involves constitutive and activity-regulated transport steps between morphological pools, a mechanism that may extend to the site-specific delivery of other membrane protein complexes."

We found memory utilization is most efficient when (1) very few synapses are modified to store each pattern, (2) LTP, the learning operation, is dendrite-specific and gated by distinct pre- and postsynaptic thresholds, (3) HD, the forgetting operation, co-occurs with LTP and targets least-recently potentiated synapses, and (4) both LTP and HD are all-or-none, leading de facto to binary-valued synaptic weights. In networks containing up to 40 million synapses, the learning scheme led to order-of-magnitude capacity increases compared to conventional plasticity rules."

Mutations in human SPT cause hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy type 1, a disease characterized by loss of feeling in extremities and severe pain. The human enzyme is a membrane-bound hetereodimer, and the most common mutations are located in the enzymatically incompetent monomer, suggesting a “dominant” or regulatory effect. The molecular basis of how these mutations perturb SPT activity is subtle and is not simply loss of activity. To further explore the structure and mechanism of SPT, we have studied the homodimeric bacterial enzyme from Sphingomonas paucimobilis. We have analyzed two mutants (N100Y and N100W) engineered to mimic the mutations seen in hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy type 1 as well as a third mutant N100C designed to mimic the wild-type human SPT. The N100C mutant appears fully active, whereas both N100Y and N100W are significantly compromised. The structures of the holoenzymes reveal differences around the active site and in neighboring secondary structure that transmit across the dimeric interface in both N100Y and N100W. Comparison of the l-Ser external aldimine structures of both native and N100Y reveals significant differences that hinder the movement of a catalytically important Arg378 residue into the active site. Spectroscopic analysis confirms that both N100Y and N100W mutants subtly affect the chemistry of the PLP. Furthermore, the N100Y and R378A mutants appear less able to stabilize a quinonoid intermediate. These data provide the first experimental insight into how the most common disease-associated mutations of human SPT may lead to perturbation of enzyme activity.

The reaction is a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent, decarboxylative, Claisen condensation of the amino acid l-serine and the long chain (C16) fatty acid palmitoyl-CoA, which produces the sphingolipid precursor, 3-ketodihydrosphingosine (KDS). hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy type 1 serine palmitoyltransferase pyridoxal phosphate 3-ketodihydrosphingosine 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid root mean square 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase 5-aminolevulinate synthase 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate-CoA ligase polyethylene glycol.

In marked contrast, eukaryotic SPTs are heterodimeric, membrane-bound proteins consisting of two subunits, SPT1 and SPT2 (encoded by the lcb1 and lcb2 gene, respectively) (24Hanada K. Hara T. Fukasawa M. Yamaji A. Umeda M. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33787-33794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Analysis of a number of HSAN1 patients has revealed the four most common mutations to be C133W, C133Y, V144D, and G387A, with the cysteine mutations appearing to be the most prevalent in populations (10Dawkins J.L.

The impact that these mutations have on SPT activity and sphingolipid metabolism has been the focus of attention by a number of groups. Most surprisingly, these disease-associated mutations occur in the SPT1 monomer, a protein that must be inactive, since it lacks the key lysine, histidine, and aspartate residues necessary to bind and stabilize the PLP cofactor. It is the SPT2 protein that contains the conserved, active site lysine residue that forms a Schiff base internal aldimine with the PLP. However, both subunits are essential to produce functionally active SPT heterodimer (26Buede R. Rinker-Schaffer C. Pinto W.J. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J.

A transgenic mouse model also revealed that the LCB1 C133W mutation led to mice with decreased tissue SPT activity and HSAN1 symptoms despite unaltered ceramide concentrations (31McCampbell A. Truong D. Broom D.C. Allchorne A. Gable K. Cutler R.G. Mattson M.P. Woolf C.J. Frosch M.P. Harmon J.M. Dunn T.M. Brown Jr., R.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3507-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A different study found that SPT activity was decreased in the tissues of HSAN1 patients, and in a Chinese hamster ovary model, hamster LCB1 C133Y and C133W mutations could not rescue cells lacking endogenous LCB1 (32Bejaoui K. Uchida Y. Yasuda S. Ho M. Nishijima M. Brown Jr., R.H. Holleran W.M. Hanada K. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1301-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These combined studies revealed that the HSAN1 mutations act directly on the SPT enzyme but the pathological consequence on sphingolipid metabolism is unclear. Very recently, Dunn and colleagues discovered a small 80-amino acid protein (TSC3p) in yeast that stimulated yeast SPT activity, but its role is still unclear (33Gable K. Slife H. Bacikova D. Monaghan E. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7597-7603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Recently, a third eukaryotic subunit (SPT3) has been characterized and appears to be required for optimum SPT activity, although it is expressed most highly in placental tissue and human trophoblasts (34Hornemann T. Richard S. Rütti M.F. Wei Y. von Eckardstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37275-37281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these three subunits could form a higher order SPT complex (35Hornemann T. Wei Y. von Eckardstein A. Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The instability and hydrophobic nature of eukaryotic SPTs has made their isolation and therefore biophysical characterization particularly challenging (24Hanada K. Hara T. Fukasawa M. Yamaji A.

We have targeted homodimeric SPT from Sphingomonas paucimobilis EY2395 to provide molecular insight into the enzymatic properties of SPT (39Ikushiro H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol.

Recently, we reported the first high resolution x-ray crystal structure of the S. paucimobilis holo-SPT (41Yard B.A. Carter L.G. Johnson K.A. Overton I.M. Dorward M. Liu H. McMahon S.A. Oke M. Puech D. Barton G.J. Naismith J.H. Campopiano D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 370: 870-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and showed that the active site containing the PLP cofactor is at the dimer interface. We used this structure to model the human enzyme and map the human cysteine residue (Cys133) of SPT1 onto Asn100 of the bacterial SPT (41Yard B.A. Carter L.G. Johnson K.A. Overton I.M. Dorward M.

We found that Asn100 is proximal to the PLP binding site and lies at the dimer interface. To explore the effects of the HSAN1 mutations on human SPT activity and structure, we have studied mutants of the bacterial enzyme. We made the N100C mutant to better mimic native human SPT and N100W and N100Y to mimic the most common mutations in human SPT. We have characterized the mutations using kinetics, spectroscopy, and structural biology, including structures of the external l-Ser aldimine. These data provide molecular insights into the effects of HSAN1 mutations. Also, as part of these studies, we identify residues that play a role in the stabilization of intermediates in the SPT reaction and have been able to generate new insights into the substrate specificity and mechanism of the α-oxamine synthase family. Plasmids and Escherichia coli competent cells were purchased from Novagen, and all chromatography columns were from GE Healthcare. All buffers and reagents were from Sigma. Palmitoyl-CoA was from Fluka and Avanti Lipids, and [U-14C]l-serine (specific activity 1.85 MBq/ml) was from GE Healthcare. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene. The decanoyl-CoA (10:0), lauroyl-CoA (12:0), myristoyl-CoA (14:0), stearoyl-CoA (18:0), and arachidoyl-CoA (20:0) were from Sigma. Oligonucleotide primers were sourced from SigmaGenosys. PEG 3350 was from Fluka. S-(2-oxoheptadecyl)-CoA was a kind gift from Dr. Hiroko Ikushiro (Department of Biochemistry, Osaka Medical College, Japan).

The recombinant plasmids were used to transform E. coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells, and selection was carried out on LB agar containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin. For each mutant (and native), a single colony was used to inoculate 500 ml of 2YT broth (16 g/liter Bacto-tryptone, 10 g/liter Bacto-yeast extract, 5 g/liter sodium chloride (pH 7.5)), which was shaken at 250 rpm overnight at 37 °C. The overnight culture was added to 4 liters of 2YT broth supplemented with kanamycin and grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to give a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and growth was continued for 5 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested (Sorvall RC5B centrifuge) by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The proteins were purified essentially according to the previously described method, which is based polyhistidine-tagged protein binding to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) (41Yard B.A. Carter L.G.

After elution, fractions were pooled and desalted by dialysis against 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 25 μm PLP. A gel filtration step (Sephacryl S200 26/60 HR; GE Healthcare) was carried out in the same buffer. For enzymatic assays and UV-visible spectroscopy, this buffer is also used. For x-ray crystal trials, the protein was exchanged into 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 25 μm or 250 μm PLP. For storage, the enzymes were transferred to the same buffer containing 20% glycerol (v/v) and stored at −80 °C until use. Protein identity and integrity were confirmed by high pressure liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry on a MicroMass Platform II quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ion source. The experimentally determined masses of recombinant S. paucimobilis SPT WT and each of the mutants were within 0.1% of the theoretical mass, which includes the C-terminal LEHHHHHH fusion affinity tag with the enzyme lacking the N-terminal methionine (41Yard B.A. Carter L.G.

All UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Cary 50 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian) and analyzed using Cary WinUV software (Varian). Prior to enzymatic assays, SPT was converted to the holo-form by dialysis against freshly prepared 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl and 25 μm PLP for 1 h at 4 °C. Excess PLP was removed by passing the protein through a PD-10 (Sephadex G-25M) desalting column (GE Healthcare) before concentration to 10–20 mg/ml using a VivaSpin 30 kDa cut-off concentration filter. For UV-visible assays, the concentration of recombinant SPT was 10 μm, and the spectrophotometer was blanked with 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl. Assays were carried out in 0.5-ml quartz cuvettes (1-cm path length) and typically contained 10 μm SPT in 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5). Varying amounts of l-serine (0–80 mm) were used in each assay. After the addition of substrate, the reactants were mixed and allowed to equilibrate for 15 min at 25 °C. Small base-line changes were corrected using Sigma Plot software. Changes in absorbance at 425 nm (SPT WT, N100C, R378A, and R378N) and 420 nm (SPT N100W and N100Y) were plotted against l-serine concentrations, and data points were fitted to a hyperbolic saturation curve (Equation 1) using Sigma Plot software, ΔAobs=ΔAmax[ serine ]Kd+[ serine ](Eq. 1) where ΔAobs represents the observed change in absorbance at 422 nm, and ΔAmax is the maximal absorbance change, [serine] is the l-serine concentration, and Kd is the dissociation constant (Table 1).

A final enzyme concentration of 10 μm SPT in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) was incubated with 20 mm [U-14C]l-serine (9250 Bq, 0.250 μCi; GE Healthcare) and 1.6 mm palmitoyl-CoA in a final volume of 125 μl. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, and then the reaction was quenched by the addition of 30 μl of 2.0 m NH4OH (final concentration 0.4 m). This was then extracted with an equal volume of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, v/v). The sample was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, and the aqueous phase was discarded before the organic phase was allowed to evaporate overnight. The resulting lipid residue was resuspended in 15 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, v/v) and spotted onto a silica gel 60 TLC plate. Separation was carried out with a mobile phase of CHCl3/CH3OH/NH4OH (40:10:1, v/v/v), using a KDS reference standard (Matreya). The TLC was developed with a Storage PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare) for 4 days at room temperature, and the phosphor screen was visualized using ImageJ software. SPT activity was also measured using a continuous spectrophotometric assay by monitoring the release of CoASH from acyl-CoA substrates and reaction with 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) (42Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21474) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out in 0.5-ml cuvettes in a Varian Cary-50 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The enzyme was incubated with l-serine in a buffered solution containing DTNB, and the assay was started by the addition of the second substrate, palmitoyl-CoA. The CoASH thiol product was monitored by observation of the TNB− anion at 412 nm ϵmax = 14,150 m−1 cm−1 (43Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Initial rates were measured at increasing concentrations of l-serine (0.12–50 mm) while maintaining palmitoyl-CoA in excess. A typical experiment to determine the Km value for l-serine contained 0.16 μm SPT, 0.1–50 mml-serine, 250 μm palmitoyl-CoA, and 0.2 mm DTNB in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Kinetic constants (kcat and Km values; Table 1) were calculated from Michaelis-Menten plots using Sigma Plot. Kinetic constant values were calculated in a similar way for CoA substrates (decanoyl, lauroyl, myristoyl, palmitoyl, stearoyl, and arachidoyl) but by maintaining l-serine (100 mm) in excess (Table 2). As a check, the kcat/Km parameters for CoA substrates were also determined by the method of complete condensation when [CoA] was ≪Km. In this case, kcat/Km is calculated at a single substrate concentration as an observed rate constant (kobs) by monitoring disappearance of the substrate. The data were fitted to the equation, A = Alim × (1 − exp(−kobs × t)), where A is the absorbance at 412 nm, Alim is the limiting absorbance value when the substrate has completely disappeared, kobs is the observed rate constant, and t is the time in seconds. The errors are asymptotic S.E. values of each parameter derived from the curve fitting procedure within Sigma Plot. The values obtained were reproducible over a number of enzyme preparations, and the errors can be used as a gauge of the fitted curve's accuracy and were generally less than 5% of the value of the parameter.TABLE 2Chain length specificity of wild-type SPTAcyl-CoAkcatKmCoAkcat/KmCoAs−1μmm−1 s−1Decanoyl (10:0)0.045 ± 0.0022324.9 ± 175.119.4Lauroyl (12:0)0.262 ± 0.006822.2 ± 32.6318.7Myristoyl (14:0)0.601 ± 0.01297.1 ± 5.16189.5Palmitoyl (16:0)1.150 ± 0.03035.4 ± 2.032,485.9Stearoyl (18:0)0.898 ± 0.01213.7 ± 0.865,547.4Arachidoyl (20:0)0.327 ± 0.014<10>32,700 Open table in a new tab The three mutant proteins were screened for suitable crystallization conditions at the Scottish Structural Proteomics Facility.

Crystallization trials were set up in hanging drop plates (EasyXtal DG-CrystalSupport; Qiagen) using 2–3 μl of the protein solution and 1 μl of well solution in the hanging drop. Crystals of the mutant SPTs were obtained in the form of yellow plates corresponding to the high resolution form of the holo wild-type SPT. The SPT N100W mutant was crystallized at 20 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 25 μm PLP using a well solution of 0.1 m MgCl2, 22% (w/v) PEG 3350, and 0.10 m Hepes (pH 6.5).

https://openalex.org/W2049879168,"The processes underlying dynamic changes in human behavior during real situations contain much irrelevant information and represent a key issue facing neuroscientists. Although the roles played by the frontal cortex in this switching behavior have been well documented, little is known regarding how neural pathways governing sensorimotor associations accomplish such a switch. We addressed this question by recording activities of middle temporal (MT) neurons in monkeys switching between direction versus depth discrimination tasks. Although the monkeys successfully switched between the tasks, neural sensitivity did not change as a function of task. More importantly, neurons that signaled the same motor output showed trial-to-trial covariation between neuronal responses and perceptual judgments during both tasks, whereas neurons that signaled the opposite motor output showed no covariation in either task. These results suggest that task switching is accomplished via communication from distinct populations of neurons when sensorimotor associations switch within a short time period."

https://openalex.org/W2015100272,"We previously demonstrated that aldosterone, which stimulates collagen production through the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)-dependent pathway, also induces elastogenesis via a parallel MR-independent mechanism involving insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) signaling. The present study provides a more detailed explanation of this signaling pathway. Our data demonstrate that small interfering RNA-driven elimination of MR in cardiac fibroblasts does not inhibit aldosterone-induced IGF-IR phosphorylation and subsequent increase in elastin production. These results exclude the involvement of the MR in aldosterone-induced increases in elastin production. Results of further experiments aimed at identifying the upstream signaling component(s) that might be activated by aldosterone also eliminate the putative involvement of pertussis toxin-sensitive Galphai proteins, which have previously been shown to be responsible for some MR-independent effects of aldosterone. Instead, we found that small interfering RNA-dependent elimination of another heterotrimeric G protein, Galpha13, eliminates aldosterone-induced elastogenesis. We further demonstrate that aldosterone first engages Galpha13 and then promotes its transient interaction with c-Src, which constitutes a prerequisite step for aldosterone-dependent activation of the IGF-IR and propagation of consecutive downstream elastogenic signaling involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt. In summary, the data we present reveal new details of an MR-independent cellular signaling pathway through which aldosterone stimulates elastogenesis in human cardiac fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1990598615,"The transcription factor Ets-1 is implicated in various physiological processes and invasive pathologies. We identified a novel variant of ets-1, ets-1Δ(III–VI), resulting from the alternative splicing of exons III to VI. This variant encodes a 27 kDa isoform, named Ets-1 p27. Ets-1 p27 lacks the threonine-38 residue, the Pointed domain and the transactivation domain, all of which are required for the transactivation of Ets-1 target genes. Both inhibitory domains surrounding the DNA-binding domain are conserved, suggesting that Ets-1 p27, like the full-length Ets-1 p51 isoform, is autoinhibited for DNA binding. We showed that Ets-1 p27 binds DNA in the same way as Ets-1 p51 does and that it acts both at a transcriptional and a subcellular localization level, thereby constituting a dual-acting dominant negative of Ets-1 p51. Ets-1 p27 blocks Ets-1 p51-mediated transactivation of target genes and induces the translocation of Ets-1 p51 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, Ets-1 p27 overexpression represses the tumor properties of MDA-MB-231 mammary carcinoma cells in correlation with the known implication of Ets-1 in various cellular mechanisms. Thus the dual-acting dominant-negative function of Ets-1 p27 gives to the Ets-1 p27/Ets-1 p51 ratio a determining effect on cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W2078799403,"The G protein betagamma subunit dimer (Gbetagamma) and the Gbeta5/regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) dimer play fundamental roles in propagating and regulating G protein pathways, respectively. How these complexes form dimers when the individual subunits are unstable is a question that has remained unaddressed for many years. In the case of Gbetagamma, recent studies have shown that phosducin-like protein 1 (PhLP1) works as a co-chaperone with the cytosolic chaperonin complex (CCT) to fold Gbeta and mediate its interaction with Ggamma. However, it is not known what fraction of the many Gbetagamma combinations is assembled this way or whether chaperones influence the specificity of Gbetagamma dimer formation. Moreover, the mechanism of Gbeta5-RGS assembly has yet to be assessed experimentally. The current study was undertaken to directly address these issues. The data show that PhLP1 plays a vital role in the assembly of Ggamma2 with all four Gbeta1-4 subunits and in the assembly of Gbeta2 with all twelve Ggamma subunits, without affecting the specificity of the Gbetagamma interactions. The results also show that Gbeta5-RGS7 assembly is dependent on CCT and PhLP1, but the apparent mechanism is different from that of Gbetagamma. PhLP1 seems to stabilize the interaction of Gbeta5 with CCT until Gbeta5 is folded, after which it is released to allow Gbeta5 to interact with RGS7. These findings point to a general role for PhLP1 in the assembly of all Gbetagamma combinations and suggest a CCT-dependent mechanism for Gbeta5-RGS7 assembly that utilizes the co-chaperone activity of PhLP1 in a unique way."

In INS-1 cells overexpressing doxycycline-inducible HNF-1α dominant-negative (DN-) gene mutations, and islets from Hnf-1α knock-out mice, insulin secretion was impaired in response to glucose (15 mm) and other nutrient secretagogues. Decreased rates of insulin secretion in response to glutamine plus leucine and to methyl pyruvate, but not potassium depolarization, indicate defects specific to mitochondrial metabolism. To identify the biochemical mechanisms responsible for impaired insulin secretion, we used 31P NMR measured mitochondrial ATP synthesis (distinct from glycolytic ATP synthesis) together with oxygen consumption measurements to determine the efficiency of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial uncoupling was significantly higher in DN-HNF-1α cells, such that rates of ATP synthesis were decreased by approximately one-half in response to the secretagogues glucose, glutamine plus leucine, or pyruvate. In addition to closure of the ATP-sensitive K+ channels with mitochondrial ATP synthesis, mitochondrial production of second messengers through increased anaplerotic flux has been shown to be critical for coupling metabolism to insulin secretion. 13C-Isotopomer analysis and tandem mass spectrometry measurement of Krebs cycle intermediates revealed a negative impact of DN-HNF-1α and Hnf-1α knock-out on mitochondrial second messenger production with glucose but not amino acids.

The impaired responsiveness of these cells to glucose may be explained in part by these changes in glucose metabolism. However, it is uncertain whether the impaired GSIS can be attributed primarily to changes in glycolysis, or whether mitochondrial dysfunction is also a contributor. The products of mitochondrial metabolism are integral to fuel-stimulated insulin secretion, with the ATP/ADP ratio as the primary messenger, and putative secondary messengers that act to facilitate either the transfer of mitochondrial reducing equivalents to generate cytosolic NADPH (i.e. citrate, malate) or lipid synthesis (citrate).

INS-1 cells (DN-HNF-1α) engineered with expression of the dominant-negative mutations of HNF-1α under control of the dox-dependent transcriptional activator were used in these studies (7Wang H.

The effects of the HNF-1α mutations were evaluated by comparison of cells exposed to dox with the same cells that are not exposed to dox and therefore do not express the DN-HNF-1α gene. INS-1 cells were cultivated as monolayers in RPMI 1640 medium, pH 7.4, with 11.1 mmd-glucose supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Tet System-approved fetal bovine serum, Clontech), antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin), 10 mm HEPES, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. The cells were cultured with 150 μg/ml G418 sulfate (Clontech) and 100 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen) to maintain selection pressure. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C under humidified conditions (5% CO2, 95% air). Once cells reached 60–70% confluence in culture, either 24 or 48 h prior to any study, the media were changed to RPMI 1640 medium as above except with 3 mm glucose (G3) and with doxycycline (500 ng/ml) added to induce expression of the DN-HNF-1α mutant gene or without doxycycline for the control. Dox-regulated expression of DN-HNF-1α mRNA was verified by PCR, and protein was verified by Western blotting using an antibody generated against mouse Hnf-1α 70-269 (BD Biosciences). Cell viability was assessed by the trypan blue staining assay. For assessing cell functionality and LC/MS/MS analysis, cells were seeded into 6-well plates and treated with G3 RPMI medium with or without dox for 24 h in advance of the study. For NMR studies of isotopic labeling or entrapment for 31P-measured rates of ATP synthesis, cells were subcultured into 10-cm diameter Petri dishes (three per condition).

The pancreas was harvested from anesthetized mice (pentobarbital sodium, 50 mg/kg; Abbott), minced and digested with type P collagenase, hand-picked into CMRL (pH 7.4, supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin), and incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2, 95% air. Cells were seeded into 6-well plates and grown in culture until they reached 60–70% confluence and treated 24 h in advance with 3 mm glucose supplemented with dox for the test cells or without dox for the control. After the 24 h, the cells were preincubated for 0.5 h at low glucose (G3) in Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB) with 0.2% fatty acid-free BSA to establish basal conditions. The buffer was then replaced with either KRB with glucose at either 3 or 15 mm or 3 mm glucose supplemented with 4 mm glutamine and 10 mm leucine. Media aliquots were taken at the end of the 2-h incubation and immediately centrifuged at low speed (4 °C) to pellet out any cell contamination while avoiding cell disruption. A portion of the supernatant was placed into a clean tube placed on ice and then stored at −20 °C for insulin analysis. Cells in the remaining incubation buffer were placed on ice, washed with ice-cold PBS, and extracted with ice-cold 0.1% Triton for immediate protein determination. The remaining cell lysate was stored −20 °C for total insulin content. Islets (50–80) were layered between a slurry of acrylamide gel column beads (Bio-Gel P4G (156-4124)) and perifusion buffer (KRB with 3 mm glucose and 0.2% fatty acid free BSA) within the perifusion chamber. The islets were then perifused (100 μl/min) for a 1-h equilibration period using a Bio-Rep (Miami, FL) perifusion instrument that provides precise temperature and flow control and collection of eluant into 96-well plate format. After the stabilization period, the islets were perifused with the indicated agonists. Perifusate solutions were gassed with 5% CO2, 95% air and maintained at 37 °C. Secreted insulin was determined by ELISA for mouse insulin (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden). At the end of the perifusion, islet DNA was extracted and assayed following the manufacturer's recommended protocol with PicoGreen double strand DNA quantitation reagent kit (Invitrogen). Cells were extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) from 6-well plates that were treated for 24 h with G3 ± dox as described above. RNA was reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs) to cDNA using RT-PCR technology (Bio-Rad). Forward and reverse sequence primers (IDT) were designed for each of the genes of interest, and quantitative real time PCR using Fast SYBR Green reagent (Applied Biosystems) was performed on the 7500 Fast Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) and evaluated using the Sequence Detection software version 1.4 for mRNA expression. Quantitative analysis was determined by Δ/ΔCT method normalized to both the nontreated cells and β-actin message. Reaction efficiencies were determined to be greater than 99% for each gene of interest. Sequences for rat primers used were as follows: GLUT2, 5′-CAA TTT CAT CAT CGC CCT CT-3′ and 5′-TGC AGC AAT TTC GTC AAA AG-3′; glucokinase, 5′-CAG TGG AGC GTG AAG ACA AA-3′ and 5′-CTT GGT CCA ATT GAG GAG GA-3′; liver-type pyruvate kinase, 5′-CGT TCA GCC CAG CTT CTA TC-3′ and 5′-CCT GTC ACC ACA ATC ACC AG-3′; SCS-ATP, 5′-TGT GGT ACG GTT ACA AGG TAC A-3′ and 5′-ACA ACC ATT TTA GCA GCT TCA T-3′; SCS-GTP, 5′-GAG GAA GAG GAA AAG GTG TCT T-3′ and 5′-GAG GAA GAG GAA AAG GTG TCT T-3′; ME1, 5′-ATG GAG AAG GAA GGT TTA TCA AAG-3′ and 5′-GGC TTC TAG GTT CTT CAT TTC TT-3′; ME2, 5′-GGC TTT AGC TGT TAT TCT CTG TGA-3′ and 5′-TGA ATA TTA GCA AGT GAT GGG TAA A-3′; mtPEPCK, 5′-CTG AGG CCT TAG GCT AGC AA-3′ and 5′-CGT GAG GAC AAA TGG GAA GT-3′; UCP2, 5′-AGT TCT ACA CCA AGG GCT CAG A-3′ and 5′-CTC TCG TGC AAT GGT CTT GTA G-3′; adenine nucleotide translocase, 5′-CCC GAT CGA GAG GGT CAA A-3′ and 5′-TGT ACT GTT TCT CTG CAC TGA TCT GT-3′; ACC1, 5′-GGG AAA TAA AGT GAT TGA GAA GGT-3′ and 5′-TAG TGA TCC GCC ATC TTA ATG TAT-3′; HMG-CoA reductase, 5′-CAT GCT GCC AAC ATC GTC A-3′ and 5′-CCC ACA TTC TGT GCT GCA TC-3′; insulin 1, 5′-GCC CAG GCT TTT GTC AAA CA-3′ and 5′-CTC CCC ACA CAC CAG GTA GAG-3′; Insulin 2, 5′-CAG CAC CTT TGT GGT TCT CA-3′ and 5′-CAG TGC CAA GGT CTG AAG GT-3′; Zn2+ transporter, 5′-TCA AGG CCC CCT TCC AA-3′ and 5′-ACC GAG GAT CTC TGC TCG ATA C-3′. An index of oxidative phosphorylation was calculated from the ratio of the 31P NMR rates of ATP synthesis and fluorometrically measured oxygen consumption rates as described below. Entrapped DN-HNF-1α cells were perifused with KRB (0.2% BSA) supplemented with nutrient agonists (1 ml/min, 37 °C) in the bioreactor in the bore of the AVANCE-500 NMR spectrometer. After a pre-equilibration period with 3 mm glucose, 31P NMR spectra and saturation transfer experiments were acquired during step changes in metabolic substrates and inhibitors. 31P NMR spectra were continuously collected in 20-min experiments, with 3–4 measurements collected for each substrate level (15Cline G.W. Vidal-Puig A.J. Dufour S. Cadman K.S. Lowell B.B. Shulman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20240-20244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Substrate concentrations were adjusted by addition of substrate to the perifusate reservoir, thereby ensuring thorough mixing and temperature and oxygen equilibration of the media before reaching the bioreactor. Spectra were acquired at basal glucose concentration of 3 mm and during sequential additions of the glutamine (4 mm) plus leucine (10 mm), glucose (15 mm), or pyruvate (2 mm). ATP synthesis rates were determined by 31P NMR saturation-transfer techniques (15Cline G.W. Vidal-Puig A.J. Dufour S. Cadman K.S. Lowell B.B. Shulman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20240-20244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), as described below. To achieve the high cell density necessary for adequate signal to noise at reasonable time intervals, we used a packed bed perfusion bioreactor loaded with cells entrapped within a biocompatible polymer (i.e. alginate). The alginate maintained cell viability and function by allowing for adequate oxygen and nutrient delivery and for removal of waste by-products. The custom-built perifusion system enabled the maintenance and monitoring of well oxygenated cells within the bore of the NMR spectrometer at physiological pH and temperature. After 24 h of culture in RPMI, 3 mm glucose (±dox), the cells were entrapped in alginate beads of ∼1–2 mm diameter (16Papas K.K. Jarema M.A.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E1100-E1106PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were detached from the plate with trypsin and centrifuged, and the cell pellet was resuspended in a 3% alginate solution in PBS (w/v). Beads (∼2 mm diameter) were formed by extruding the slurry from a 28-gauge needle into a 1.1% BaCl2 solution. The cells were allowed to recover overnight in a spinner flask with RPMI (G3 ± dox) culture medium. Recently, it has been shown that in the INS-1E cell line, two distinct pools of intracellular Pi can be distinguished with cytosolically and mitochondrially targeted fluorescent pH-sensitive probes (18Abad M.F. Di Benedetto G. Magalhães P.J. Filippin L. Pozzan T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11521-11529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 19Wiederkehr A. Park K.S. Dupont O. Demaurex N. Pozzan T. Cline G.W. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial pH was found to have a higher basal pH than the cytosol, and glucose stimulation caused a further alkalinization of the mitochondria but not in the cytosol. Because the chemical shift of Pi is pH-dependent, these results prompted us to investigate whether distinct cytosolic and mitochondrial pools of Pi could be observed, and rates of ATP synthesis were measured, using 31P NMR saturation-transfer experiments. Chemical shifts were referenced to the α-phosphate of ATP at 10.2 ppm, which is not affected in the range of pH observed in these studies (20Gadian D.G. Radda G.K. Richards R.E. Seeley P.J. Shulman R.G. Biological Application of Magnetic Resonance. Academic Press, New York1979: 463-535Google Scholar). Although a robust Pi-pH titration curve can be obtained from the Pi and phosphocreatine chemical shift differences, the variable concentrations of phosphocreatine under different substrate conditions in our cells led us to choose the α-phosphate resonance of ATP as the frequency reference (20Gadian D.G. Radda G.K. Richards R.E. Seeley P.J. Shulman R.G. Biological Application of Magnetic Resonance. Academic Press, New York1979: 463-535Google Scholar, 21Petroff O.A. Prichard J.W. Behar K.L. Alger J.R. den Hollander J.A. Shulman R.G. Neurology. 1985; 35: 781-788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A calibration curve of Pi chemical shift frequencies with respect to pH was determined with Pi in buffered salt solutions, with the chemical shift difference increasing with pH. In the standard pulse-acquire spectra, we were able to directly observe an intracellular Pi resonance distinct from the buffer Pi with a pH of ∼7.0 corresponding to the cytosolic compartment (Fig. 4A). With phosphate buffering of KRB at pH 7.4, the extracellular Pi co-resonates with any putative mitochondrial Pi pool and interferes with its direct observation. However, in the difference spectrum (Fig. 4, B and C) of control spectra (Fig. 4A) and the γ-ATP saturation spectra (data not shown), we could measure a metabolically active Pi pool that corresponded to the mitochondrial pH and was responsive to changes in glucose or amino acid stimuli. ATP synthesis rates were calculated as follows: k−1 × [Pi]in, where k−1 is the rate constant k (min−1) = δM/Mo × 1/T1, and [Pi]in is the intracellular Pi concentration. δM/Mo is the change in the intracellular Pi signal when the terminal phosphate of ATP is saturated compared with the Pi signal with a saturation pulse offset an equal distance downfield from the Pi resonance (δM/Mo = (Mo − Mz)/Mo) (15Cline G.W. Vidal-Puig A.J. Dufour S. Cadman K.S. Lowell B.B. Shulman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20240-20244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The longitudinal relaxation time, T1, for both the extracellular and intracellular Pi was measured in separate studies at basal (3 mm) glucose and upon addition of substrates. T1 values were measured using standard inversion-recovery experiments. T1 for extracellular Pi was calculated to be 4.13 s, and T1 for intracellular Pi was calculated to be 1.58 s at basal glucose. Intracellular Pi concentration was calculated from relative signal intensity of the extracellular and intracellular Pi at steady state for each condition, and the measured concentration of intracellular Pi (13.0 ± 1.2 nmol/mg-protein) at basal conditions by tandem mass spectrometry (as described below). The mitochondrial Pi was assumed constant under all conditions, as has been shown in nerve cells as the result of the combined action of Pi and Ca2+ transport into and buffering of Pi by complexation with mitochondrial Ca2+ (22David G. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7495-7506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Variation in the cell number of encapsulated cells and packing within the bioreactor was minimal as shown from the consistency of the relative intensities of the intracellular and extracellular Pi at basal conditions, and it was confirmed by measurement of the protein concentration of the entrapped cells at the end of the study. Oxygen consumption rates of freshly trypsinized cells or encapsulated cells were measured using a fiber optic oxygen monitor (model 210, Instech Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA) (23Papas K.K. Pisania A. Wu H. Weir G.C. Colton C.K. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2007; 98: 1071-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A 250-μl chamber was loaded with ∼2 × 106 cells or ∼5 beads, and changes in the oxygen concentration were monitored under buffer conditions and substrate additions identical to 31P NMR experiments for measurement of ATP synthesis rates. Mitochondrial superoxide production was evaluated in mitochondria isolated from DN-HNF-1α cells cultured with or without doxycycline for 24 h. The mitochondria were isolated and resuspended in an isotonic buffer as described previously (14Pongratz R.L. Kibbey R.G. Shulman G.I. Cline G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 200-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Superoxide production was determined from the oxidation of hydroethidine (HEt) (Molecular Probes, Inc.), using a modification of previously described methods (24Krauss S. Zhang C.Y. Scorrano L. Dalgaard L.T. St-Pierre J. Grey S.T. Lowell B.B. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1831-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Briefly, the mitochondria were aliquoted into a 96-well plate (∼50 ng of mDNA per well) and equilibrated to 37 °C, and HEt was added at a concentration of 5 μm. The oxidation of HEt was monitored at 5-s intervals as the increase in fluorescence (excitation, 545 nm; emission, 590 nm) with a FlexStation3 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). After a 15-min equilibration period, pyruvate was added (10 mm final concentration), and fluorescence was monitored for an additional 15 min, followed by addition of carbonyl cyanide 4-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP, 2 μm final concentration) to collapse the mitochondrial membrane potential and determine the rate of HEt oxidation independent of superoxide production. Rates of HEt oxidation due to reaction with superoxide were calculated from the difference i"

Overexpression of REL is acutely transforming in chicken lymphoid cells, but has not been shown to transform any mammalian lymphoid cell type. In this report, we show that overexpression of a highly transforming mutant of REL (RELDeltaTAD1) increases the oncogenic properties of the human B-cell lymphoma BJAB cell line, as shown by increased colony formation in soft agar, tumor formation in SCID (severe combined immunodeficient) mice, and adhesion. BJAB-RELDeltaTAD1 cells also show decreased activation of caspase in response to doxorubicin. BJAB-RELDeltaTAD1 cells have increased levels of active nuclear REL protein as determined by immunofluorescence, subcellular fractionation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Overexpression of RELDeltaTAD1 in BJAB cells has transformed the gene expression profile of BJAB cells from that of a germinal center B-cell subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (GCB-DLBCL) to that of an activated B-cell subtype (ABC-DLBCL), as evidenced by increased expression of many ABC-defining mRNAs. Upregulated genes in BJAB-RELDeltaTAD1 cells include several NF-kappaB targets that encode proteins previously implicated in B-cell development or oncogenesis, including BCL2, IRF4, CD40 and VCAM1. The cell system we describe here may be valuable for further characterizing the molecular details of REL-induced lymphoma in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2112773201,"Drugs that inhibit Na,K-ATPases, such as digoxin and ouabain, alter cardiac myocyte contractility. We recently demonstrated that agrin, a protein first identified at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction, binds to and regulates the activity of α3 subunit-containing isoforms of the Na,K-ATPase in the mammalian brain. Both agrin and the α3 Na,K-ATPase are expressed in heart, but their potential for interaction and effect on cardiac myocyte function was unknown. Here we show that agrin binds to the α3 subunit of the Na,K-ATPase in cardiac myocyte membranes, inducing tyrosine phosphorylation and inhibiting activity of the pump. Agrin also triggers a rapid increase in cytoplasmic Na+ in cardiac myocytes, suggesting a role in cardiac myocyte function. Consistent with this hypothesis, spontaneous contraction frequencies of cultured cardiac myocytes prepared from mice in which agrin expression is blocked by mutation of the Agrn gene are significantly higher than in the wild type. The Agrn mutant phenotype is rescued by acute treatment with recombinant agrin. Furthermore, exposure of wild type myocytes to an agrin antagonist phenocopies the Agrn mutation. These data demonstrate that the basal frequency of myocyte contraction depends on endogenous agrin-α3 Na,K-ATPase interaction and suggest that agrin modulation of the α3 Na,K-ATPase is important in regulating heart function.

Na,K-ATPases, or sodium pumps, are integral membrane enzymes found in all animal cells. Using energy from the hydrolysis of ATP they transport three Na+ ions out of the cell for every two K+ ions into the cell, resulting in a transmembrane chemical gradient that is reflected in the resting membrane potential and used to drive a variety of secondary transport processes. Each Na,K-ATPase is a heterodimer consisting of an α- and β-subunit. The α-subunit is the catalytic subunit and contains the binding sites for Na+ and K+. The β-subunit is required for pump function and targeting of the α-subunit to the plasma membrane. Four α- and three β-subunit genes have been identified. All combinations of α- and β-subunits form functional pumps, but developmental, cellular, and subcellular differences in expression suggest functional adaptation of the different isoforms (1Kaplan J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 511-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Na,K-ATPases play a central role in regulating the contractile activity of cardiac muscle (2Bers D.M. Barry W.H. Despa S. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 57: 897-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). They are directly responsible for the Na+ gradient required for propagation of action potentials that initiate myocyte contraction. Moreover, because of the dependence of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) 3The abbreviations used are: NCXNa+/Ca2+ exchangerE18embryonic day 18P0postnatal day 0ANOVAanalysis of variancePBSphosphate-buffered salineBS3bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberateMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidDSdissecting solutionFCSfetal calf serumSBFIsodium-binding benzofuran isophthalateMuSKmuscle-specific kinase. on the Na+ gradient as the source of counterions for transport of Ca2+ out of the cell, they play a critical role in Ca2+ homeostasis and excitation-contraction coupling. For example, inhibition of Na,K-ATPases by digoxin, ouabain, or other cardiac glycoside results in a decline of the Na+ gradient, reducing NCX activity and Ca2+ efflux. The inotropic effects of cardiac glycosides result from uptake of this “excess” cytoplasmic Ca2+ into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, raising the level of Ca2+ in intracellular stores, which, when released during excitation, enhances muscle contraction (3Levi A.J.

In light of the importance of Na,K-ATPases for cardiac muscle function, it is not surprising that mechanisms have evolved to regulate their activity. Na,K-ATPases are susceptible to phosphorylation by either cAMP-dependent protein kinase or protein kinase C, and neurotransmitter- and peptide hormone-dependent activation of these cytoplasmic kinases have been shown to regulate pump activity (4Glitsch H.G. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1791-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Other molecules exert their effects through direct interaction with the Na,K-ATPase. For example, phospholemman, a member of the FXYD family of membrane proteins expressed in heart, is tightly associated with the Na,K-ATPase and inhibits its function (5Crambert G. Fuzesi M. Garty H.

Phosphorylation of phospholemman by either protein kinase C or cAMP-dependent protein kinase, however, relieves inhibition thereby restoring the activity of the pump (8Despa S. Bossuyt J. Han F.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 2440-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Ouabain, or closely related molecules, is synthesized by the adrenal gland and hypothalamus, and increased circulating levels of these compounds observed in patients with congestive heart failure has been suggested as an adaptive response to improve heart function (11Gottlieb S.S. Rogowski A.C. Weinberg M. Krichten C.M. Hamilton B.P. Hamlyn J.M. Circulation. 1992; 86: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Recent studies in the central nervous system have identified the protein agrin as a new endogenous ligand that regulates Na,K-ATPase function through interaction with its extracellular domains (12Hilgenberg L.G. Su H. Gu H. O'Dowd D.K. Smith M.A. Cell. 2006; 125: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Agrin was first identified as an extracellular matrix protein at the neuromuscular junction where, by signaling through a muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase called MuSK, it mediates the motor neuron-induced accumulation of acetylcholine receptors in the postsynaptic muscle fiber membrane (13Ngo S.T. Noakes P.G. Phillips W.D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Agrin is also expressed in other tissues (14Godfrey E.W. Dietz M.E. Morstad A.L.

Fluorescence images were captured on a Nikon Optiphot 2 using a Spot camera and software. Recombinant 15- and 20-kDa COOH-terminal agrin fragments, C-Ag15 and C-Ag20, were expressed and purified as described (22Hoover C.L. Hilgenberg L.G. Smith M.A. J.

Chemical cross-linking to either endogenous agrin (i.e. saline-treated) or agrin fragments was performed on pieces of ventricular muscle using bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3, Pierce). Briefly, ventricles were placed in ice-cold PBS containing 1.8 mm CaCl2 (PBS2+) and cleaned of blood, connective tissue, and major blood vessels. Ventricular tissue was then teased into small pieces (∼1 mm3) and incubated for 5 min in PBS (Ca2+-free) followed by preincubation for 15 min with recombinant agrin or vehicle in 0.9 ml of PBS2+ on ice. Cross-linking was started by the addition of 0.1 ml of 1 mm BS3, and the tissue was incubated for 30 min on ice before the reaction was stopped by washing three times in PBS containing 50 mm ethanolamine. Ten to twenty pieces of tissue were processed per reaction. BS3 cross-linking of cultured myocytes was performed as described (12Hilgenberg L.G. Su H. Gu H. O'Dowd D.K. Smith M.A. Cell. 2006; 125: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Following cross-linking, pieces of tissue or cultured cells were collected into ice-cold TI buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors (P8340, Sigma-Aldrich)), and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g to remove debris and the resulting supernatant centrifuged for 1 h at 40,000 × g to pellet the membrane fraction. Membrane pellets were resuspended in TI buffer, and protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Western blot analysis of α1, α2, and α3 subunits was performed using 9A-5, AB9094, and XVIF9-G10, respectively (18Arystarkhova E. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol.

Antibody specificity was confirmed in preliminary experiments in which blots were probed with second antibody alone (data not shown). Cross-linked agrin-α3 subunit complexes were also analyzed by immunoprecipitation. Following cross-linking, tissue was Dounce-homogenized in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) plus protease inhibitors, and the homogenate was cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 15,000 × g. The protein concentration of the resulting supernatant was determined, and primary antibody (10 μl of XVIF9-G10 or 5 μl of RαAg-1) was added to the cleared homogenate (250 μg of protein) in a final volume of 400 μl followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Antigen-antibody complexes were precipitated by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with 20 μl of 1:1 slurry of protein G- or protein A-Sepharose beads (Millipore). The beads were then washed in several changes of immunoprecipitation buffer and eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for Western blot analysis. Agrin induced phosphorylation of different α-subunits was determined from Western blots of immunoprecipitated phosphoproteins. Briefly, small pieces of tissue were preincubated with recombinant agrin alone or in the presence of 0.1 mm genistein in 250 μl of buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 3.3 mm Na2HPO4, 4.4 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2 and then transferred to a water bath for 5 min at 37 °C. Tissue was then cooled on ice and homogenized in ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Tissue extracts were cleared by centrifugation, and aliquots of the detergent-soluble fraction (250 μg of protein) were incubated with 4 μl of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (mAb4G10, Millipore) with gentle agitation overnight at 4 °C. Antigen-antibody complexes were precipitated and Western-blotted as described above. Quantitative analysis of Western blots was performed using the gel analyzer routine in the public domain ImageJ software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Cultured cells or pieces of tissue were homogenized in ice-cold SE buffer (318 mm sucrose, 40 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2) and sarcolemmal or other cell membranes recovered by centrifugation as described (23Lucchesi P.A. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9327-9331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting membrane pellets were resuspended in SE and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. To measure Na,K-ATPase activity, aliquots of membrane material (10–25 μg of protein) were preincubated with either 5 mm ouabain (25× stock in H2O) or recombinant agrin fragment (diluted from a stock solution containing 250 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0) for 1 h in the dark on ice in a buffer containing 130 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 30 mm imidazole, pH 7.4. Samples were then transferred to a 37 °C water bath, and the reaction was started by the addition of ATP to a final concentration of 4 mm (final volume 100 μl). The reaction was stopped after 10 min by the addition of 10 μl of 20% SDS. ATPase activity was determined from the rate of ATP hydrolysis based on release of inorganic phosphate. Briefly, 400 μl of reagent A (1.8% ascorbic acid, 0.3 n HCl, 0.3% ammonium molybdate) and 500 μl of reagent B (2% sodium meta-arsenite, 2% trisodium citrate, 2% acetic acid) was added to each reaction, and the absorbance at 850 nm was measured. The molar concentration of inorganic phosphate was determined by comparison with a NaH2PO4 standard. Na,K-ATPase-dependent ATPase activity was defined as the fraction of total ATPase activity inhibited by 5 mm ouabain. Primary ventricular myocytes were prepared from E18 mouse hearts using a modification of the protocol as described (24Mitcheson J.S. Hancox J.C. Levi A.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 39: 280-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Hearts were placed into ice-cold dissecting solution (DS; 130 mm NaCl, 23 mm HEPES, 21 mm glucose, 20 mm taurine, 5 mm creatine, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, 4.5 mm KCl, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 0.75 mm Ca2+, pH 7.3), and the atria, major blood vessels, and connective tissue were removed. Ventricles were washed in fresh DS, minced into small pieces with jewelers forceps, and then washed in Ca2+-free DS containing 3.3 μm EGTA. Tissue pieces were subsequently incubated in DS containing 0.1 mm Ca2+, crude collagenase type 1A (0.5 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), and protease type XIV (0.1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min at 37 °C followed by washing in fresh DS containing 0.1 mm Ca2+. The tissue was gently triturated and the resulting cell suspension transferred to a 15-ml conical centrifuge tube and stored on ice. The cycle of enzyme digestion and trituration was repeated until all of the tissue was dissociated. The pool of dissociated cells was pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 199 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 5 mm creatine, 5 mm taurine, 2 mmd-carnitine, 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 μm insulin, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and plated onto laminin-coated culture dishes or glass coverslips. Cultures were maintained in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. BHK cells were grown in minimum Eagle's medium (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10% FCS and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Mouse cerebrocortical glial cells were prepared and maintained as described (12Hilgenberg L.G. Su H. Gu H. O'Dowd D.K. Smith M.A. Cell. 2006; 125: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). All handling and treatment of animals was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, Irvine. Intracellular Na+ was monitored by ratiometric imaging of the membrane-permeant Na+ binding dye, SBFI-AM (Invitrogen), essentially as described (12Hilgenberg L.G. Su H. Gu H. O'Dowd D.K. Smith M.A. Cell. 2006; 125: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Hilgenberg L.G. Smith M.A. J. Neurobiol. 2004; 61: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 4–7-day-old cultured myocytes growing on glass-bottomed culture dishes (MatTek) were loaded with SBFI-AM (5 μg/ml) in HEPES-buffered salt solution (HBSS; 120 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 15 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 5% fetal calf serum (HBSS-FCS) and 0.1% Pluronic F-127 (Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature. Cultures were then washed in fresh HBSS-FCS followed by de-esterification for a further 30 min at room temperature. Recordings were done in HBSS. Excitation wavelengths were selected using band specific filters at 340 and 380 nm, and ratio images at alternating excitation wavelengths were acquired at 510 nm at 1 Hz using an Orca 100 digital CCD camera (Hamamatsu) and analyzed using Metafluor 4.6 software (Molecular Devices). To accommodate for the small spontaneous fluctuations in Na+, the Na+ level in normal saline was defined as the average level during the 6-s period prior to treatment with agrin or ouabain. Similarly, the response to each drug was defined as the average response during the 6-s period beginning 1 s prior to the peak response. To control for variation in dye loading, the agrin response of each cell was normalized to the maximal response induced by a mixture 5 mm ouabain and 5 μm gramicidin at the end of each experiment. 4–5-day-old cultured cardiac myocytes were viewed at ×400 magnification, and contractions during 30 s was counted in three to five random fields/culture dish. All counts were performed blind with respect to genotype and treatment. Curve fitting was performed using classical nonlinear models provided in Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). The concentration dependence of Na,K-ATPase activity on C-Ag20 and C-Ag15 was fit by a variable slope sigmoidal dose-response equation, y=B+(T−B)1+10(logEC50−x)HillSlope (Eq. 1) where B and T are minimal and maximal values for Na,K-ATPase activity, respectively. Data describing the effects of C-Ag20 on ouabain inhibition of Na,K-ATPase activity were fit by a two-site competition model, y=B+(T−B)[F11+10x−log⁡EC501+1−F11+10x−log⁡EC502](Eq. 2) where F1 is the fraction of sites with EC501 and F2 is the fraction of sites with EC502. All statistical analyses (t test, paired t test, ANOVA) were performed on raw data using DataDesk 6.2 (Data Description, Inc.). We recently demonstrated that the α3 Na,K-ATPase is a receptor for agrin in central nervous system neurons. Whereas previous studies had shown that agrin and the α3 Na,K-ATPase are expressed in heart, little was known about the cellular distribution of these two proteins and their potential for interaction in cardiac tissue. Using double-label immunohistochemistry we examined the pattern of agrin and α3 Na,K-ATPase expression in sections of embryonic and adult mouse heart. At E18, both agrin and the α3 Na,K-ATPase were readily detectable and relatively evenly dispersed throughout the ventricular and atrial myocardium (Fig. 1, A and A′). Previous studies in rat have shown that α3 Na,K-ATPase is expressed in Purkinje and other fibers of the heart conduction system (26Zahler R. Sun W. Ardito T. Zhang Z.T. Kocsis J.D. Kashgarian M. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 870-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A population of high α3 Na,K-ATPase-expressing fibers, most notable in the ventricular septum, likely represents elements of the developing conducting fiber system. Staining with the anti-agrin serum was specific, based on the low background staining in sections from agrin knock-out (Agrn−/−) mice (supplemental Fig. 1). Similar low levels of nonspecific staining were observed in the absence of the α3 Na,K-ATPase monoclonal antibody (not shown). Expression of agrin and α3 Na,K-ATPase was also detected in sections of adult heart (Fig. 1, B and B′). Whereas staining for agrin was relatively uniform and similar to that seen in embryonic myocytes, α3 Na,K-ATPase appeared as intensely labeled foci distributed within a lower, evenly labeled background. Previous studies have also reported low levels of α3 subunit expression in adult rodent heart (23Lucchesi P.A. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9327-9331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Harada K. Lin H. Endo Y. Fujishiro N. Sakamoto Y. Inoue M. J. Physiol. Sci. 2006; 56: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 28Quintas L.E. Noël F. Wibo M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 565: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The low resolution of the immunohistochemical studies made it difficult to determine whether agrin and the α3 Na,K-ATPase were present at the cell surface. Therefore, to learn more about their subcellular distribution and potential interaction, we used chemical cross-linking of live cells with the membrane-impermeant bifunctional reagent BS3 followed by Western blot analysis of partially purified membranes to look for evidence of native agrin-α3 Na,K-ATPase complexes in cardiac tissue (Fig. 1C). Western blots of teased pieces of embryo (E18) or adult ventricular muscle probed with the α3 Na,K-ATPase subunit monoclonal antibody revealed a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 110 kDa which, as expected for the α3 subunit, was more abundant in embryo versus adult. Cross-linking with BS3, however, resulted in the appearance of a new α3 antibody cross-reacting band with a molecular mass of ≥300 kDa. Agrin has a predicted molecular mass of 198 kDa, but because of variable glycosylation the native protein runs as a broad band of ≥200 kDa, raising the possibility that the ≥300-kDa band represents a complex of endogenous agrin and the α3 subunit. Supporting this hypothesis, cross-linking in the presence of a saturating concentration (100 pm) of either of two short COOH-terminal fragments of agrin, C-Ag15 or C-Ag20 (apparent molecular mass of 15 and 20 kDa, respectively), which bind to the α3 Na,K-ATPase on neuron cell membranes (12Hilgenberg L.G. Su H. Gu H. O'Dowd D.K. Smith M.A. Cell. 2006; 125: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 22Hoover C.L. Hilgenberg L.G. Smith M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), blocked the formation of the putative agrin-α3 subunit complex resulting instead in the appearance of 125- and 130-kDa bands predicted for each agrin fragment-α3 subunit adduct. Because neither the agrin fragments nor BS3 is hydrophobic, the ability of the agrin fragments to block formation of the high molecular weight complex suggests that agrin secreted by cardiac myocytes binds to one or more extracellular domains of the α3 Na,K-ATPase. Interestingly, not all α3 subunits could be cross-linked even in the presence of a concentration of the agrin fragments sufficient to antagonize cross-linking to endogenous agrin. A portion of the cross-link-resistant pool of α3 subunits may be due to poor penetration of reagents; however, similar results in parallel studies on live cultured cardiac myocytes (supplemental Fig. 2), where access should be greatly improved, suggest that distinct populations of α3 Na,K-ATPases may exist. Apparent competition between endogenous agrin and the agrin fragments argues for the presence of a limited number of specific agrin binding sites on cardiac myocyte membranes. But cardiac myocytes also express α1 and α2 Na,K-ATPases that are structurally similar to α3, raising the possibility that agrin may also interact with these other pump isoforms. Cross-linking, however, did not affect the electrophoretic mobility of either α1 or α2 (Fig. 1C), evidence that agrin binds specifically to the α3 subunit in heart as it does in brain. Finally, to test directly for interaction between agrin and the α3 subunit, detergent extracts of embryo and adult ventricular myocyte membranes were immunoprecipitated with the anti-α3 monoclonal antibody and the immunoprecipitates analyzed by Western blotting with the anti-agrin serum. Consistent with the results of the Western blots probed with the anti-α3 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1C), cross-linking in saline alone resulted in the appearance of a broad band of ≥300 kDa that contained epitopes for both the α3 subunit and agrin (Fig. 1D). Formation of this high molecular mass band was blocked by cross-linking in the presence of either C-Ag15 or C-Ag20, which instead produced the characteristic bands at 125 and 130 kDa expected for the C-Ag15-α3 subunit and C-Ag20-α3 subunit adducts. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that native agrin and the α3 Na,K-ATPase are expressed and interact in both embryonic and adult heart muscle fibers. Agrin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the α3 subunit of the Na,K-ATPase, and inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity blocks agrin signaling in neurons (12Hilgenberg L.G. Su H. Gu H. O'Dowd D.K.

To learn whether agrin might play a similar role regulating Na,K-ATPase activity in cardiac myocytes, we tested the ability of"

Besides the uncertainty about the subunit stoichiometry, it is still unclear how bestrophin subunits assemble and interact in functional channels. Understanding how disease-causing mutations might adversely affect the assembly and interaction of bestrophin subunits is important for elucidating the molecular mechanism underlying the Best disease. The hBest1 protein contains six transmembrane domains (TMD1–6) with intracellularly located N and C termini. There are three “hot spots” of disease-causing mutations in hBest1: the N-terminal region, TMD2, and the C terminus proximal to TMD6 (13Hartzell H.C. Qu Z. Yu K. Xiao Q. Chien L.T. Physiol.

How mutations distributed around the N- and C-terminal regions cause Best disease is less clear, although strong evidence recently suggested that certain mutations in the C terminus disrupt hBest1 channel gating by Ca2+ (16Xiao Q.

In the present study we tested the hypothesis that an interaction between the N and C termini plays an important role in normal hBest1 channel function, and weakening or disruption of this interaction by mutations leads to channel dysfunction. To test our hypothesis, we introduced disease-causing mutations into the N- or C-terminal regions of hBest1 expressed in HEK293 cells and tested the effects of mutations on subunit interaction and channel function with a combination of electrophysiological, biochemical, and optical methods. We found that these mutations not only disrupted channel function but also caused N- and C-terminal dissociation both in vitro and in vivo. The findings suggest a novel molecular mechanism for the mutations in hBest1 to cause human Best disease. hBest1 cDNA in pRK5 vectors was generously provided by Jeremy Nathans (John Hopkins University). For FRET measurements, hBest1 or its mutants were subcloned into pEYFP-N3 and pCerulean-N3 vectors (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), respectively. Site-specific mutations in hBest1 were made using a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange kit; Stratagene) as described previously (4Qu Z. Fischmeister R. Hartzell C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). hBest1 wild type (WT), 3The abbreviations used are: WTwild typeFRETfluorescence resonance energy transferPBSphosphate-buffered salineGSTglutathione S-transferaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinCFPcyan fluorescent proteinYFPyellow fluorescent proteinTMDtransmembrane domain. point mutants, or fluorescent-fused hBest1 cDNAs were transfected into HEK293 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). pEGFP (Invitrogen) was co-transfected with nonfluorescent hBest1 wild type or mutants to identify successfully transfected cells. 0.6 μg of DNA was used to transfect one 35-mm culture dish.

Recordings were performed using whole cell recording configuration of the patch clamp (21Neher E. Science. 1992; 256: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes were made with borosilicate glass (Sutter Instrument Co.), pulled by a Sutter P-2000 puller (Sutter Instrument Co.), and fire-polished. Patch pipettes had resistances of 2–3.5 MΩ. The bath was grounded via a 3 m KCl-agarose bridge connected to a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Holding potential was 0 mV. Step voltages in 20-mV increments were applied between −100 and 100 mV with 1-s duration to record Cl− currents. The data were acquired by an Axopatch 200A amplifier controlled by Clampex 8.1 via a Digidata 1322A data acquisition system (Axon Instruments). The experiments were conducted at room temperature (23–25 °C). The standard pipette solution (high intracellular Ca2+ solution) contained 146 mm CsCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Ca2+-EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm sucrose, pH 7.3, adjusted with N-methyl-d-glucamine. The calculated Ca2+ concentration in the internal solution was 4.5 μm (4Qu Z. Fischmeister R. Hartzell C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The standard extracellular solution (150 mm Cl− solution) contained 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. with NaOH. This combination of solutions set the reversal potential, Erev, for chlorine currents to zero, whereas cation currents carried by Na+ or Cs+ had very positive or negative Erev, respectively. Extracellular Cl− was replaced on an equiosmolar basis with SO42− (100 mm Na2SO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3), which is impermeant, to verify that the current was carried by Cl−. Voltage ramps from −100 to +100 mV were used for this purpose. Because the chlorine currents were time-independent, voltage ramps provided a reliable I-V relationship. For quantitative analysis and graphical presentation, we used OriginPro 7.0 software (Microcal). The data are presented as the means ± S.E.; statistic significance was analyzed with Student's t test. hBest1 WT or mutant-transfected and native HEK-293 cells were placed on ice, washed with PBS, and then biotinylated with 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC Biotin (Pierce) in PBS for 30 min. The cells were washed with PBS and incubated in 100 mm glycine in PBS to quench free biotin for 30 min. After washing, the cells were scraped from the dish, collected by centrifugation, and suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture III (Calbiochem), and 10 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) 250 μl/100-mm dish. The extract was clarified at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Biotinylated proteins in supernatant were isolated by incubation of 200 μl of extract with 100 μl of streptavidin beads (Pierce) overnight with gentle agitation at 4 °C. The beads were collected by simple centrifugation and washed four times with 0.6 ml of lysis buffer plus 200 mm NaCl. The biotinylated proteins were eluted from beads with 200 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer and loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel with ∼10 μl of protein supernatant/well. The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellurose membrane for Western blotting. The immunoblots were probed with anti-Myc and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibodies, followed by secondary anti-mouse IgG. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit; Amersham Biosciences). The cDNA fragments encoding the N or C terminus of hBest1 were synthesized using the Pfu polymerase chain reaction with hBest1 cDNA as a template. The hBest1 N terminus (hBest1-N) was subcloned into pGEX-4T-3 vector (Amersham Biosciences) in which the N terminus was fused to GST. To express GST-hBest1-N protein, the vector was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells (Amersham Biosciences), and the fusion protein synthesis was induced using 0.25 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Amersham Biosciences) at 25–30 °C for 3–5 h. Bacteria were lysed in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors. Low Ca2+ lysis buffer included 5 mm EDTA, whereas high Ca2+ included 0.1 mm CaCl2. Solubilized proteins were collected as the supernatant of a 17,000 × g centrifugation. GST fusion proteins were purified with glutathionine-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). hBest1-C terminus carrying six Myc tags was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 and expressed in HEK293. The proteins were extracted with lysis buffer 48 h after transfection. Glutathionine-Sepharose beads that had been prelinked to GST fusion proteins were mixed with HEK cell extracts in lysis buffer and rotated at 4 °C for 2 h to allow protein-protein interaction. Similar amounts of GST fusion proteins were used for each assay. The beads were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 2 min and washed three times with lysis buffer. After a final wash, the beads were heated in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE, and unbound proteins were separated with 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). After transferring to a nitrocellurose membrane, hBest1-C was detected by an anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen) followed by a secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1/7,000) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Immunoreactive bands were visualized as described above. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with a C-terminal Cerulean fluorescent protein-tagged hBest1 construct (hBest1-CFP) and a C-terminal enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-tagged hBest1 construct (hBest1-YFP) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. Fluorescence imaging was conducted at room temperature 1–2 days after transfection using a fully automated, inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX-81). Two filter cubes (Chroma) were used to collect spectroscopic images from each cell (excitation, dichroic): Cube I, D436/20, 455dclp; Cube II, HQ500/20, Q515lp. Under our experimental conditions, autofluorescence from untransfected cells was negligible. Most transfected cells exhibited clear plasma membrane fluorescence. However, there were also strong intracellular fluorescence signals in these cells. Our study focused on the plasma membrane fluorescence using the following approach. Fluorescence emission was detected using a Hamamasu HQ CCD camera in conjunction with a spectrograph (Acton SpectraPro 2150i). The captured spectra images contained emissions from a thin section of the cell covered by the spectrograph input slit. Because fluorescence signals sampled along the slit represent different parts of the cell, the approach allowed selective analysis of FRET signals from functional channel proteins in the plasma membrane region (22Cheng W. Yang F. Takanishi C.L. Zheng J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 191-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 23Bykova E.A. Zhang X.D. Chen T.Y. Zheng J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 1115-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because the signal from fluorescently labeled channel proteins in the plasma membrane greatly exceeded the nonspecific background signal in the neighboring area, the fluorescence intensity represented predominately the functional channel proteins in the cell surface membrane. Emission spectra from these fluorescence signals were constructed and used for FRET analysis (22Cheng W. Yang F. Takanishi C.L. Zheng J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 191-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). FRET efficiency was estimated from the enhanced acceptor (YFP) emission as previously described (24Zheng J. Zagotta W.N. Neuron. 2000; 28: 369-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Enhanced acceptor emission was quantified by comparing CFP-YFP cells to those expressing only YFP constructs, as shown in Fig. 5. The measured FRET efficiency, Eapp, was calculated as follows,Eapp=( Ratio A Ratio A0−1)ϵAϵD(Eq. 1) in which RatioA is the fluorescence intensity ratio of YFP excited at 436 and 500 nm from CFP+YFP samples, RatioA0 is the ratio from YFP-only samples, and ϵA and ϵD are extinction coefficient for YFP and CFP, respectively. We determined ϵA/ϵD at the CFP excitation wavelength (436 nm) from standard excitation spectra for CFP and YFP. Because the random assembly of CFP- and YFP-labeled subunits yielded a mixture of all possible combinations of the fluorophores pairs, we fitted the distribution of measured FRET efficiency values from individual cells as a function of the CFP-to-YFP intensity ratio (FC/FY) with models specific for multisubunit protein complexes (25Takanishi C.L. Bykova E.A. Cheng W. Zheng J. Brain Res. 2006; 1091: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The expression levels of CFP- and YFP-tagged constructs varied dramatically from cell to cell and yielded variable FC/FY, which appeared to be a general feature for expressing exogenous channel proteins through cell transfection (23Bykova E.A. Zhang X.D. Chen T.Y. Zheng J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 1115-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Takanishi C.L. Bykova E.A. Cheng W. Zheng J. Brain Res. 2006; 1091: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Results from fits with a model based on dimeric channel complexes (23Bykova E.A. Zhang X.D. Chen T.Y. Zheng J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 1115-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) are presented (see Fig. 7), although an alternative model based on tetrameric channel complexes (22Cheng W. Yang F. Takanishi C.L. Zheng J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 191-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) yielded a similar difference between the wild type and mutant channels. The dimer model is described by the following equations (25Takanishi C.L. Bykova E.A. Cheng W. Zheng J. Brain Res. 2006; 1091: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar),Eapp=E⋅r1+r(Eq. 2) FCFY=1+r−E1+1r+EϵCϵY⋅SCSY(Eq. 3) in which r is the relative expression level between CFP and YFP, E is the FRET efficiency, and SC and SY are system transfer functions for CFP and YFP, respectively (25Takanishi C.L. Bykova E.A. Cheng W. Zheng J. Brain Res. 2006; 1091: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). SC/SY can be determined from measurements of a donor-acceptor pair with a known E value or from a global fit of multiple datasets collected with the same recording system and the same fluorophores. When Equations 2 and 3 are combined, the unknown parameter r is cancelled, leaving E as the only unknown parameter. To estimate E, we incorporated equations 2 and 3 in Microsoft Excel and fitted our data sets by varying E to achieve minimum chi-square. For this approach, we have previously estimated that the confidence interval is about 5% (22Cheng W. Yang F. Takanishi C.L. Zheng J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 191-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In the N terminus of hBest1, Arg25 and Lys30 are well conserved among mammalian bestrophins. Disease-causing mutations have been found to occur in Arg25 (R25W or R25Q) and Lys30 (K30R). Our study focused on these two positively charged residues as well as Arg19, assuming that this charged residue may also be important for structural integrity of the channel protein. These residues were mutated individually into a cysteine. Consistent with the disease phenotypes, both R25C and K30C lost ∼95% of channel activities. (Fig. 1, C and F). hBest1-R19C mutant channels remained functional, but the current was dramatically reduced (Fig. 1, B and F). These results indicate that all three charged residues are important for hBest1 function. In the C terminus, there is a highly conserved, highly charged acidic domain (297PFGEDDDDFE306) immediately after TMD6, the function of which has been long pursued (13Hartzell H.C. Qu Z. Yu K. Xiao Q. Chien L.T. Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 639-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Recently, Xiao et al. (16Xiao Q. Prussia A. Yu K. Cui Y.Y. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 132: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) identified a C-terminal region of hBest1 (amino acids 312–323) as a putative Ca2+-binding loop (EF hand) that is involved in the gating of hBest1 by Ca2+; Ca2+ binding to this EF hand activates the channel in a process that requires the acidic domain (amino acids 293–308) and another regulatory domain (amino acids 350–390). In the present study we focused on disease-causing mutations either within the acidic domain, G299E and D301N, or the EF hand, D312N. We found that both G299E and D301N led to nonfunctional chlorine channels (Fig. 1). In addition, these point mutations dominant-negatively inhibited wild type hBest1 function. Mutation D312N led to lower channel activity (Fig. 1, D and F). To test whether dysfunction of the mutant channels was due to trafficking defects, we conducted cell surface protein biotinylation test. We found that hBest1 channels with N-terminal R25C or K30C mutation trafficked to the membrane normally (Fig. 2). Our previous membrane biotinylation experiments also showed that the hBest1 proteins with C-terminal mutations were trafficked to the plasma membranes (26Yu K. Qu Z. Cui Y. Hartzell H.C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 4694-4705Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, fluorescently labeled mutant channels were also found to locate at the plasma membrane, as indicated by the fluorescence signal distribution (data not shown). Overall, these data suggest that the lack or reduction of channel current by the N- or C-terminal mutations was not due to a protein trafficking abnormality but due to disruption of channel function. Because N-C termini interactions are involved in activation of inward rectifier K+ channels and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (17Qu Z. Yang Z. Cui N. Zhu G. Liu C. Xu H. Chanchevalap S. Shen W.

A. 2006; 103: 15635-15640Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the above results suggested to us that hBest1 N and C termini may associate during activation of the channel. To test the potential role N and C termini may play in intersubunit interaction in bestrophin channels, we synthesized and isolated N- and C-terminal proteins of hBest1. The N terminus segment (amino acids 1–30) was fused with GST at the N-terminal end (GST-N), whereas the C terminus segment (amino acids 292–586) was fused with a six-Myc tag at the C-terminal end (C-6×Myc). GST and GST-fused N-terminal proteins were synthesized and purified from E. coli. 6×Myc-fused C-terminal proteins were expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Glutathione-agarose, which binds GST with high affinity, was used to pull down the GST-N proteins and proteins bound to it. Association of the C-terminal segment with the N-terminal segment was detected by an antibody against the 6×Myc tag in Western blot. Consistent with our hypothesis, hBest1 N and C termini did interact in vitro (Fig. 3C). In addition, we showed that the C terminus did not associate with Glutathione-agarose-GST complex, indicating that the interaction between GST-N and C-terminal was specific (Fig. 3, C and D). To our knowledge, this finding is the first direct demonstration of the hBest1 N-C-terminal interaction, indicating a possible functional role in hBest1. Because hBest1 activation is mediated by intracellular Ca2+ (2Sun H. Tsunenari T. Yau K.W. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4008-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 16Xiao Q. Prussia A. Yu K. Cui Y.Y. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 132: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 27Tsunenari T. Sun H. Williams J. Cahill H. Smallwood P. Yau K.W. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41114-41125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that Ca2+ might activate the channel via promoting the N-C interaction. However, the interaction was positively detected even in the absence of Ca2+ in the solutions (Fig. 3C). Therefore, the N-C association of hBest1 may not be mediated by channel Ca2+ sensing. Based on the results described above, we introduced mutations into the hBest1 N or C terminus and tested the effect of these mutations on the interaction between the two parts. For this purpose, we selected one mutation (R25C) in the N terminus and three mutations (G299E, D301E, or D312N) in the C terminus. As shown in Fig. 3D, the N-terminal R25C mutant (GST-N-R25C) did not bind to the wild type C terminus (C-6×Myc). In addition, none of the C-terminal segments containing G299E, D301E, or D312N mutant bound to the wild type N terminus (GST-N). The results demonstrated that the selected mutations in the N and C termini disrupted the interaction between the two counterparts and suggested that disruption of the N-C interaction underlies the mutation phenotypes. To determine whether hBest-1 form functional multimers, we tested hBest-1 multimerization using a spectrum-based FRET method as previously described (25Takanishi C.L. Bykova E.A. Cheng W. Zheng J. Brain Res. 2006; 1091: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For this purpose we constructed fusion constructs in which CFP or YFP was attached to either the N or C terminus of hBest1. However, we found that hBest1 constructs carrying a fluorescent protein at its N terminus lost chlorine channel function, even though the protein appeared to have normal cellular distribution (data not shown). For this reason, we focused on the two C-terminal hBest1 fusion constructs that did exhibit functional chlorine channel activities (Fig. 4) as well as strong plasma fluorescence (Fig. 5) when transfected into HEK293 cells, although hBest1-YFP had lower channel activity (Fig. 4). Fluorescent protein-fused D301N mutants also remained nonfunctional. Given that multiple hBest1 subunits associate to yield channel function, we predicted that the C-terminally attached CFP and YFP would be positioned close enough in the channel complex to generate FRET signals. To test this prediction, hBest1-CFP and hBest1-YFP were co-expressed, and the fluorescence emission was recorded from the plasma membrane region of individual cells (Fig. 5). Both CFP and YFP emissions were clearly observed from co-transfected cells (Fig. 6A). Using a standard CFP spectrum collected from a cell expressing only hBest1-CFP, we could extract the YFP emission from cells co-expressing hBest1-CFP and hBest1-YFP. To determine whether this YFP emission contained any FRET signal, the ratio between the extracted YFP signal and the total YFP emission upon direct excitation (Fig. 6B, left panel) was compared with a similar ratio between signals from cells expressing only hBest1-YFP (which should not contain any FRET) (Fig. 6B, right panel). Because the fluorescence ratio is independent of the expression level, the method allowed reliable comparison across cells with different expression levels. The extra YFP signal from the hBest1-CFP/hBest1-YFP co-expression cell indicated that FRET indeed occurred (Fig. 6B). To more quantitatively study assembly between hBest1 subunits, the FRET efficiency value in individual cells was determined from the spectral information as previously described (24Zheng J. Zagotta W.N. Neuron. 2000; 28: 369-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The FRET efficiency values exhibited a"

However, the role of APP in bone is unknown. In this study, the expression, cleavage, and function of APP were investigated during osteogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Expression of all gamma-secretase subunits was confirmed in human primary osteoprogenitors cells, and a significant increase in enzyme activity was observed during osteogenic differentiation using a specific fluorimetric assay. Application of selective inhibitors confirmed gamma-secretase-dependent cleavage of APP within osteogenic cells, and secretion of Abeta by mature osteoblasts was demonstrated with the use of a chemiluminescent immunoassay. Osteoprogenitors showed a selective and significant increase in adhesion to extracellular matrices containing aged Abeta plaques compared with nonaged Abeta peptide controls. Abeta on the endosteal and periosteal surfaces of adult rat ulnae were identified by immunohistochemistry. MicroCT analysis of vertebrae from an AD mouse model, Tg2576, identified a decrease in bone volume, surface area, and thickness compared with wild-type controls. These findings indicate that APP functions as a novel regulator of osteoblast activity and suggest that the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AD may also influence bone."
