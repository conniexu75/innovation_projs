https://openalex.org/W2968499116,"The DNA sequencing technologies in use today produce either highly accurate short reads or less-accurate long reads. We report the optimization of circular consensus sequencing (CCS) to improve the accuracy of single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing (PacBio) and generate highly accurate (99.8%) long high-fidelity (HiFi) reads with an average length of 13.5 kilobases (kb). We applied our approach to sequence the well-characterized human HG002/NA24385 genome and obtained precision and recall rates of at least 99.91% for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), 95.98% for insertions and deletions <50 bp (indels) and 95.99% for structural variants. Our CCS method matches or exceeds the ability of short-read sequencing to detect small variants and structural variants. We estimate that 2,434 discordances are correctable mistakes in the ‘genome in a bottle’ (GIAB) benchmark set. Nearly all (99.64%) variants can be phased into haplotypes, further improving variant detection. De novo genome assembly using CCS reads alone produced a contiguous and accurate genome with a contig N50 of >15 megabases (Mb) and concordance of 99.997%, substantially outperforming assembly with less-accurate long reads. High-fidelity reads improve variant detection and genome assembly on the PacBio platform."

https://openalex.org/W2966884791,"The microscopic assessment of tissue samples is instrumental for the diagnosis and staging of cancer, and thus guides therapy. However, these assessments demonstrate considerable variability and many regions of the world lack access to trained pathologists. Though artificial intelligence (AI) promises to improve the access and quality of healthcare, the costs of image digitization in pathology and difficulties in deploying AI solutions remain as barriers to real-world use. Here we propose a cost-effective solution: the augmented reality microscope (ARM). The ARM overlays AI-based information onto the current view of the sample in real time, enabling seamless integration of AI into routine workflows. We demonstrate the utility of ARM in the detection of metastatic breast cancer and the identification of prostate cancer, with latency compatible with real-time use. We anticipate that the ARM will remove barriers towards the use of AI designed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2968529981,"TRK fusions are found in a variety of cancer types, lead to oncogenic addiction, and strongly predict tumor-agnostic efficacy of TRK inhibition1-8. With the recent approval of the first selective TRK inhibitor, larotrectinib, for patients with any TRK-fusion-positive adult or pediatric solid tumor, to identify mechanisms of treatment failure after initial response has become of immediate therapeutic relevance. So far, the only known resistance mechanism is the acquisition of on-target TRK kinase domain mutations, which interfere with drug binding and can potentially be addressable through second-generation TRK inhibitors9-11. Here, we report off-target resistance in patients treated with TRK inhibitors and in patient-derived models, mediated by genomic alterations that converge to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. MAPK pathway-directed targeted therapy, administered alone or in combination with TRK inhibition, re-established disease control. Experimental modeling further suggests that upfront dual inhibition of TRK and MEK may delay time to progression in cancer types prone to the genomic acquisition of MAPK pathway-activating alterations. Collectively, these data suggest that a subset of patients will develop off-target mechanisms of resistance to TRK inhibition with potential implications for clinical management and future clinical trial design."

https://openalex.org/W2968159044,"Hundreds of cellular proteins require iron cofactors for activity, and cells express systems for their assembly and distribution. Molecular details of the cytosolic iron pool used for iron cofactors are lacking, but iron chaperones of the poly(rC)-binding protein (PCBP) family play a key role in ferrous ion distribution. Here we show that, in cells and in vitro, PCBP1 coordinates iron via conserved cysteine and glutamate residues and a molecule of noncovalently bound glutathione (GSH). Proteomics analysis of PCBP1-interacting proteins identified BolA2, which functions, in complex with Glrx3, as a cytosolic [2Fe-2S] cluster chaperone. The Fe-GSH-bound form of PCBP1 complexes with cytosolic BolA2 via a bridging Fe ligand. Biochemical analysis of PCBP1 and BolA2, in cells and in vitro, indicates that PCBP1-Fe-GSH-BolA2 serves as an intermediate complex required for the assembly of [2Fe-2S] clusters on BolA2-Glrx3, thereby linking the ferrous iron and Fe-S distribution systems in cells."

https://openalex.org/W2968456699,"Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is an immune checkpoint protein; however, emerging data suggest that tumor cell PD-L1 may regulate immune-independent and intrinsic cellular functions. We demonstrate regulation of PD-L1 by oncogenic BRAFV600E and investigated its ability to influence apoptotic susceptibility in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Endogenous or exogenous mutant vs. wild-type BRAF were shown to increase PD-L1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression that was attenuated by MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase) inhibition or c-JUN and YAP knockdown. Deletion of PD-L1 reduced tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Loss of PD-L1 was also shown to attenuate DNA damage and apoptosis induced by diverse anti-cancer drugs that could be reversed by restoration of wild-type PD-L1, but not mutants with deletion of its extra- or intracellular domain. The effect of PD-L1 on chemosensitivity was confirmed in MC38 murine tumor xenografts generated from PD-L1-knockout vs. parental cells. Deletion of PD-L1 suppressed BH3-only BIM and BIK proteins that could be restored by re-expression of PD-L1; re-introduction of BIM enhanced apoptosis. PD-L1 expression was significantly increased in BRAFV600E human colon cancers, and patients whose tumors had high vs. low PD-L1 had significantly better survival. In summary, BRAFV600E can transcriptionally upregulate PD-L1 expression that was shown to induce BIM and BIK to enhance chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. These data indicate an intrinsic, non-immune function of PD-L1, and suggest the potential for tumor cell PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker."
https://openalex.org/W2967597466,"Vocal learners use early social experience to develop auditory skills specialized for communication. However, it is unknown where in the auditory pathway neural responses become selective for vocalizations or how the underlying encoding mechanisms change with experience. We used a vocal tutoring manipulation in two species of songbird to reveal that tuning for conspecific song arises within the primary auditory cortical circuit. Neurons in the deep region of primary auditory cortex responded more to conspecific songs than to other species’ songs and more to species-typical spectrotemporal modulations, but neurons in the intermediate (thalamorecipient) region did not. Moreover, birds that learned song from another species exhibited parallel shifts in selectivity and tuning toward the tutor species’ songs in the deep but not the intermediate region. Our results locate a region in the auditory processing hierarchy where an experience-dependent coding mechanism aligns auditory responses with the output of a learned vocal motor behavior. Like humans, songbirds learn to communicate vocally early in life. Moore and Woolley taught birds the songs of a different species to identify how vocal experience and auditory tuning mechanisms create neural representations of communication sounds."
https://openalex.org/W2968896536,"Chondrosarcoma is the second most common malignant bone tumor. It is characterized by low vascularity and an abundant extracellular matrix, which confer these tumors resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. There are currently no effective treatment options for relapsed or dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma, and new targeted therapies need to be identified. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations, which are detected in ~50% of chondrosarcoma patients, contribute to malignant transformation by catalyzing the production of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), a competitive inhibitor of α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. Mutant IDH inhibitors are therefore potential novel anticancer drugs in IDH mutant tumors. Here, we examined the efficacy of the inhibition of mutant IDH1 as an antitumor approach in chondrosarcoma cells in vitro and in vivo, and investigated the association between the IDH mutation and chondrosarcoma cells. DS-1001b, a novel, orally bioavailable, selective mutant IDH1 inhibitor, impaired the proliferation of chondrosarcoma cells with IDH1 mutations in vitro and in vivo, and decreased 2-HG levels. RNA-seq analysis showed that inhibition of mutant IDH1 promoted chondrocyte differentiation in the conventional chondrosarcoma L835 cell line and caused cell cycle arrest in the dedifferentiated JJ012 cell line. Mutant IDH1-mediated modulation of SOX9 and CDKN1C expression regulated chondrosarcoma tumor progression, and DS-1001b upregulated the expression of these genes via a common mechanism involving the demethylation of H3K9me3. DS-1001b treatment reversed the epigenetic changes caused by aberrant histone modifications. The present data strongly suggest that inhibition of mutant IDH1 is a promising therapeutic approach in chondrosarcoma, particularly for the treatment of relapsed or dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2967748274,"Although Weber’s law is the most firmly established regularity in sensation, no principled way has been identified to choose between its many proposed explanations. We investigated Weber’s law by training rats to discriminate the relative intensity of sounds at the two ears at various absolute levels. These experiments revealed the existence of a psychophysical regularity, which we term time–intensity equivalence in discrimination (TIED), describing how reaction times change as a function of absolute level. The TIED enables the mathematical specification of the computational basis of Weber’s law, placing strict requirements on how stimulus intensity is encoded in the stochastic activity of sensory neurons and revealing that discriminative choices must be based on bounded exact accumulation of evidence. We further demonstrate that this mechanism is not only necessary for the TIED to hold but is also sufficient to provide a virtually complete quantitative description of the behavior of the rats. Using data from rats and humans, the authors study the time it takes to make sensory judgments. The authors define the new regularity as the time–intensity equivalence in discrimination (TIED), which provides a mechanistic basis of Weber’s law."
https://openalex.org/W2968334385,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is an aggressive cancer with limited treatment options1. Approximately 10% of cases exhibit familial predisposition, but causative genes are not known in most families2. We perform whole-genome sequence analysis in a family with multiple cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and identify a germline truncating mutation in the member of the RAS oncogene family-like 3 (RABL3) gene. Heterozygous rabl3 mutant zebrafish show increased susceptibility to cancer formation. Transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches implicate RABL3 in RAS pathway regulation and identify an interaction with RAP1GDS1 (SmgGDS), a chaperone regulating prenylation of RAS GTPases3. Indeed, the truncated mutant RABL3 protein accelerates KRAS prenylation and requires RAS proteins to promote cell proliferation. Finally, evidence in patient cohorts with developmental disorders implicates germline RABL3 mutations in RASopathy syndromes. Our studies identify RABL3 mutations as a target for genetic testing in cancer families and uncover a mechanism for dysregulated RAS activity in development and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2968998455,"Bacterial speciation is a fundamental evolutionary process characterized by diverging genotypic and phenotypic properties. However, the selective forces that affect genetic adaptations and how they relate to the biological changes that underpin the formation of a new bacterial species remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the spore-forming, healthcare-associated enteropathogen Clostridium difficile is actively undergoing speciation. Through large-scale genomic analysis of 906 strains, we demonstrate that the ongoing speciation process is linked to positive selection on core genes in the newly forming species that are involved in sporulation and the metabolism of simple dietary sugars. Functional validation shows that the new C. difficile produces spores that are more resistant and have increased sporulation and host colonization capacity when glucose or fructose is available for metabolism. Thus, we report the formation of an emerging C. difficile species, selected for metabolizing simple dietary sugars and producing high levels of resistant spores, that is adapted for healthcare-mediated transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2967099009,"Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND), caused by marine bacteria Vibrio Parahaemolyticus, is a huge problem in shrimp farms. The V. parahaemolyticus infecting material is contained in a plasmid which encodes for the lethal toxins PirABVp, whose primary target tissue is the hepatopancreas, causing sloughing of epithelial cells, necrosis, and massive hemocyte infiltration. To get a better understanding of the hepatopancreas response during AHPND, juvenile shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei were infected by immersion with V. parahaemolyticus. We performed transcriptomic mRNA sequencing of infected shrimp hepatopancreas, at 24 hours post-infection, to identify novel differentially expressed genes a total of 174,098 transcripts were examined of which 915 transcripts were found differentially expressed after comparative transcriptomic analysis: 442 up-regulated and 473 down-regulated transcripts. Gene Ontology term enrichment analysis for up-regulated transcripts includes metabolic process, regulation of programmed cell death, carbohydrate metabolic process, and biological adhesion, whereas for down-regulated transcripts include, microtubule-based process, cell activation, and chitin metabolic process. The analysis of protein- protein network between up and down-regulated genes indicates that the first gene interactions are connected to oxidation-processes and sarcomere organization. Additionally, protein-protein networks analysis identified 20-top highly connected hub nodes. Based on their immunological or metabolic function, ten candidate transcripts were selected to measure their mRNA relative expression levels in AHPND infected shrimp hepatopancreas by RT-qPCR. Our results indicate a close connection between the immune and metabolism systems during AHPND infection. Our RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR data provide the possible immunological and physiological scenario as well as the molecular pathways that take place in the shrimp hepatopancreas in response to an infectious disease."
https://openalex.org/W2967612925,"Cellular senescence is a phenotypic state that contributes to age-related diseases through the secretion of matrix-degrading and inflammatory molecules. An emerging therapeutic strategy for osteoarthritis (OA) is to selectively eliminate senescent cells by initiating apoptosis. This study establishes a cartilage explant model of senescence induction and senolytic clearance using p16Ink4a expression as a biomarker of senescence. Growth-factor stimulation of explants increased the expression of p16Ink4a at both the mRNA and protein levels. Applying this culture system to cartilage from p16tdTom reporter mice (a knockin allele with tdTomato fluorescent protein regulated by the endogenous p16Ink4a promoter) demonstrated the emergence of a p16-high population that was quantified using flow cytometry for tdTomato. Cell sorting was used to separate chondrocytes based on tdTomato fluorescence and p16-high cells showed higher senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and increased gene expression of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype as compared with p16-low cells. The potential for effective senolysis within the cartilage extracellular matrix was assessed using navitoclax (ABT-263). Navitoclax treatment reduced the percentage of p16-high cells from 17.9 to 6.1% (mean of 13 matched pairs; P < 0.001) and increased cleaved caspase-3 confirmed apoptotic activity. Together, these findings establish a physiologically relevant cartilage explant model for testing the induction and elimination of senescent chondrocytes, which will support investigations of senolytic therapy for OA.-Sessions, G.

https://openalex.org/W2968855766,"Multicellular organisms achieve greater complexity through cell divisions that generate different cell types. We engineered a simple genetic circuit that induces asymmetric cell division and subsequent cell differentiation in Escherichia coli. The circuit involves a scaffolding protein, PopZ, that is stably maintained at a single cell pole over multiple asymmetric cell divisions. PopZ was functionalized to degrade the signaling molecule, c-di-GMP. By regulating synthesis of functionalized PopZ via small molecules or light, we can chemically or optogenetically control the relative abundance of two distinct cell types, characterized by either low or high c-di-GMP levels. Differences in c-di-GMP levels can be transformed into genetically programmable differences in protein complex assembly or gene expression, which in turn produce differential behavior or biosynthetic activities. This study shows emergence of complex biological phenomena from a simple genetic circuit and adds programmable bacterial cell differentiation to the genetic toolbox of synthetic biology and biotechnology. Small molecule or light-inducible gene circuits in Escherichia coli enable asymmetric cell pole localization of diguanylate phosphodiesterase and facilitate asymmetric cell division regulated by c-di-GMP-responsive transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2968730900,"We describe a synthetic genetic circuit for controlling asymmetric cell division in Escherichia coli in which a progenitor cell creates a differentiated daughter cell while retaining its original phenotype. Specifically, we engineered an inducible system that can bind and segregate plasmid DNA to a single position in the cell. Upon cell division, colocalized plasmids are kept by one and only one of the daughter cells. The other daughter cell receives no plasmid DNA and is irreversibly differentiated from its sibling. In this way, we achieved asymmetric cell division through asymmetric plasmid partitioning. We then used this system to achieve physical separation of genetically distinct cells by tying motility to differentiation. Finally, we characterized an orthogonal inducible circuit that enables the simultaneous asymmetric partitioning of two plasmid species, resulting in cells that have four distinct differentiated states. These results point the way toward the engineering of multicellular systems from prokaryotic hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2973172290,"Estrogen receptor α (ERα) is the major driving transcription factor in the mammary gland development as well as breast cancer initiation and progression. However, the genomic landscape of ERα binding sites in the normal mouse mammary gland has not been completely elucidated. Here, we mapped genome-wide ERα binding events by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) in the mouse mammary gland in response to estradiol. We identified 6237 high confidence ERα binding sites in two biological replicates and showed that many of these were located at distal enhancer regions. Furthermore, we discovered 3686 unique genes in the mouse genome that recruit ER in response to estradiol. Interrogation of ER-DNA binding sites in ER-positive luminal epithelial cells showed that the ERE, PAX2, SF1, and AP1 motifs were highly enriched at distal enhancer regions. In addition, comprehensive transcriptome analysis by RNA-seq revealed that 493 genes are differentially regulated by acute treatment with estradiol in the mouse mammary gland in vivo. Through integration of RNA-seq and ERα ChIP-seq data, we uncovered a novel ERα targetome in mouse mammary epithelial cells. Taken together, our study has identified the genomic landscape of ERα binding events in mouse mammary epithelial cells. Furthermore, our study also highlights the cis-regulatory elements and cofactors that are involved in estrogen signaling and may contribute to ductal elongation in the normal mouse mammary gland."
https://openalex.org/W2969083961,"Background It is cost-effective to perform an HIV test in people with specific indicator conditions (IC) with an undiagnosed HIV prevalence of at least 0.1%. Our aim was to determine the HIV prevalence for 14 different conditions across 20 European countries. Methods Individuals aged 18–65 years presenting for care with one of 14 ICs between January 2012 and June 2014 were included and routinely offered an HIV test. Logistic regression assessed factors associated with testing HIV positive. Patients presenting with infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome (IMS) were recruited up until September 2015. Results Of 10,877 patients presenting with an IC and included in the analysis, 303 tested positive (2.8%; 95% CI 2.5–3.1%). People presenting with an IC in Southern and Eastern Europe were more likely to test HIV positive as were people presenting with IMS, lymphadenopathy and leukocytopenia/ thrombocytopenia. One third of people diagnosed with HIV after presenting with IMS reported a negative HIV test in the preceding 12 months. Of patients newly diagnosed with HIV where data was available, 92.6% were promptly linked to care; of these 10.4% were reported lost to follow up or dead 12 months after diagnosis. Conclusion The study showed that 10 conditions had HIV prevalences > 0.1%. These 10 ICs should be adopted into HIV testing and IC specialty guidelines. As IMS presentation can mimic acute HIV sero-conversion and has the highest positivity rate, this IC in particular affords opportunities for earlier diagnosis and public health benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2968187317,"The contemporary environmental-stewardship programmes primarily aimed at curbing the global warming potential by adopting a multidisciplinary approach. Manipulating the feeding strategies has great potential in reducing the environmental footprints of livestock production. This study intends to assess the effect of soybean meal (SBM) replacement with varying levels of coated urea (SRU) on both zoo-technical (nutrient digestibility, heat increment, and physio-biochemical parameters) and environmental attributes. The coated urea was used to replace the SBM at 0, 25, 50, and 75 percent levels. Eight adult rams (43.02 ± 0.76) maintained in a conventional shed were used in a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square design. Not all the physiological parameters viz. rectal temperature, pulse rate, and respiratory rate were affected (P>0.05)f by varying levels of SRU incorporation. The SRU fed animals had higher (P<0.05) crude protein digestibility compared to SBM fed animals; however, the replacements did not affect the nutrient digestibility coefficients of DM, OM, NFC, NDFap, ADF, and hemicellulose components. The SRU did not affect various biochemical parameters such as serum glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, urea, creatinine, ALT, AST, Ca, P and T3, and T4 levels; however, post-prandial serum urea N (SUN) values showed a diurnal quadratic pattern (P<0.05) with a dose-dependent relationship. Further, the SBM replacements had no effect on the calcium excretion, while the SRU incorporation decreased the faecal phosphorous content, thereby abating the eutrophication phenomenon. Although the SBM replacements did not affect in vivo water variables and faecal solid fractions, they managed to decrease the land and virtual water requirement along with global warming potential (GWP) of the entire trial. The GWP-perceptual map unveils the fact that replacement of conventional feed ingredients with NPN compounds aids in eco-friendly livestock production. Further, the conjectural analysis of the carbon footprint methodology revealed that agricultural by-products consideration could cause a huge increase in the GWP share of feed consumed, thus compelling the importance of research pertaining to feed production perspective as equal as ruminal methane amelioration."
https://openalex.org/W2966976792,"Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infectious disease that causes tubal occlusion and other pelvic and abdominal adhesions. The incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) has increased due to the sexually active status of the young population. This leads to a more serious problem and a larger effect than previously observed. However, there have been few studies on this topic in Asian populations.We aimed to evaluate the risk of preterm labor and/or ectopic pregnancy in Taiwanese women following PID.Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database, we designed a retrospective cohort study that included 12- to 55-year-old pregnant women between 2000 and 2010. We selected a 1:3 age-matched control group of non-PID women. The endpoint was any episode of preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy; otherwise, the patients were tracked until 31 December 2010.The risk factors for preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy were explored. For cases included from the index date until the end of 2010, we analyzed the risk of incident preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy. With the use of a multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, we calculated the hazard ratio (HR) with a 95% CI and compared it with that of the control group.This study examined 30,450 patients with PID and 91,350 controls. During the follow-up period, patients in the PID group were more likely to develop preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy than patients in the control group. The cumulative incidence rates for developing preterm labor were 1.84% (561/30,450 individuals) in patients with PID and 1.63% (1492/91,350 individuals) in patients without PID. On the other hand, the cumulative incidence rate for developing ectopic pregnancy in patients with PID was 0.05% (14/30,450 individuals) but was only 0.04% (33/91,350 individuals) in patients without PID. Compared with those without PID, the patients with PID had a 1.864 times (P<0.001) higher risk of developing preterm labor and a 2.121 times (P = 0.003) higher risk of developing ectopic pregnancy.Our study provided evidence of an increased risk of preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy in PID patients."
https://openalex.org/W2967502564,"The flagellar hook protein FlgE from spirochaete bacteria self-catalyzes the formation of an unusual inter-subunit lysinoalanine (Lal) crosslink that is critical for cell motility. Unlike other known examples of Lal biosynthesis, conserved cysteine and lysine residues in FlgE spontaneously react to form Lal without the involvement of additional enzymes. Oligomerization of FlgE via its D0 and Dc domains drives assembly of the crosslinking site at the D1–D2 domain interface. Structures of the FlgED2 domain, dehydroalanine (DHA) intermediate and Lal crosslinked FlgE subunits reveal successive snapshots of the reaction. Cys178 flips from a buried configuration to release hydrogen sulfide (H2S/HS−) and produce DHA. Interface residues provide hydrogen bonds to anchor the active site, facilitate β-elimination of Cys178 and polarize the peptide backbone to activate DHA for reaction with Lys165. Cysteine-reactive molecules accelerate DHA formation, whereas nucleophiles can intercept the DHA intermediate, thereby indicating a potential for Lal crosslink inhibitors to combat spirochaetal diseases. Structural and biochemical characterization of the spirochaete flagellar hook protein FlgE reveals how cysteine and lysine residues spontaneously react to form an interdomain lysinoalanine crosslink without the involvement of additional enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2968451481,"BIN1 is the most important risk locus for Late Onset Alzheimer’s Disease (LOAD), after ApoE. BIN1 AD-associated SNPs correlate with Tau deposition as well as with brain atrophy. Furthermore, the level of neuronal-specific BIN1 isoform 1 protein is decreased in sporadic AD cases in parallel with neuronal loss, despite an overall increase in BIN1 total mRNA. To address the relationship between reduction of BIN1 and neuronal cell loss in the context of Tau pathology, we knocked-down endogenous murine Bin1 via stereotaxic injection of AAV-Bin1 shRNA in the hippocampus of mice expressing Tau P301S (PS19). We observed a statistically significant reduction in the number of neurons in the hippocampus of mice injected with AAV-Bin1 shRNA in comparison with mice injected with AAV control. To investigate whether neuronal loss is due to deletion of Bin1 selectively in neurons in presence Tau P301S, we bred Bin1flox/flox with Thy1-Cre and subsequently with PS19 mice. Mice lacking neuronal Bin1 and expressing Tau P301S showed increased mortality, without increased neuropathology, when compared to neuronal Bin1 and Tau P301S-expressing mice. The loss of Bin1 isoform 1 resulted in reduced excitability in primary neurons in vitro, reduced neuronal c-fos expression as well as in altered microglia transcriptome in vivo. Taken together, our data suggest that the contribution of genetic variation in BIN1 locus to AD risk could result from a cell-autonomous reduction of neuronal excitability due to Bin1 decrease, exacerbated by the presence of aggregated Tau, coupled with a non-cell autonomous microglia activation."

Study design Maternal-to-fetal transfer across the term human placenta was investigated with the ex-vivo dually perfused cotyledon model, in 5 closed-circuit, recirculating experiments. Dolutegravir was added to a maternal perfusate containing antipyrine, a marker to validate the cotyledon’s viability, and 2 g/liter of human albumin. Results After 3h of recirculating perfusion, the mean (± SD) DTG concentrations in the maternal and in the fetal compartments were respectively 2450 ± 286 ng/mL and 715 ± 369 ng/mL, with a fetal-to-maternal ratio of 34% ± 18% and a clearance index (in comparison with antipyrine transfer) of 79% ± 23%. The mean cotyledon accumulation index was 153% ± 25%. Conclusion Fetal transplacental exposure to dolutegravir was considerable as well as accumulation in placental tissue. Whether this may lead to risks for the exposed fetus requires more investigation."

Many brown bear populations in Central Asia are small and geographically isolated, yet their phylogeographic relationships, genetic diversity, and contemporary connectivity are poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we collected brown bear samples from the Gobi Desert (n = 2360), Altai, Sayan, Khentii, and Ikh Khyangan mountains of Mongolia (n = 79), and Deosai National Park in the Himalayan Mountain Range of Pakistan (n = 5) and generated 927 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data and genotypes at 13 nuclear DNA microsatellite loci. We documented high levels of mtDNA and nDNA diversity in the brown bear populations of northern Mongolia (Altai, Sayan, Buteeliin nuruu and Khentii), but substantially lower diversity in brown bear populations in the Gobi Desert and Himalayas of Pakistan. We detected 3 brown bear mtDNA phylogeographic groups among bears of the region, with clade 3a1 in Sayan, Khentii, and Buteeliin nuruu mountains, clade 3b in Altai, Sayan, Buteeliin nuruu, Khentii, and Ikh Khyangan, and clade 6 in Gobi and Pakistan. Our results also clarified the phylogenetic relationships and divergence times with other brown bear mtDNA clades around the world. The nDNA genetic structure analyses revealed distinctiveness of Gobi bears and different population subdivisions compared to mtDNA results. For example, genetic distance for nDNA microsatellite loci between the bears in Gobi and Altai (FST = 0.147) was less than that of the Gobi and Pakistan (FST = 0.308) suggesting more recent male-mediated nuclear gene flow between Gobi and Altai than between Gobi and the Pakistan bears. Our results provide valuable information for conservation and management of bears in this understudied region of Central Asia and highlight the need for special protection and additional research on Gobi brown bears."
https://openalex.org/W2968204451,"Difficulty performing activities of daily living (""functional impairment"") is common in homeless adults aged 50 and older. However, little is known about the trajectory of these impairments, nor the extent to which these trajectories are similar to those of older adults in the general population. We identified trajectories of functional impairment in homeless adults aged 50 and older, and risk factors for differing trajectories. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 350 homeless adults, aged 50 and older, recruited via population-based sampling in Oakland, California and interviewed at 6-month intervals for up to 3 years. We assessed functional trajectories based on self-reported difficulty performing 5 activities of daily living. We used multivariable multinomial logistic regression to identify baseline risk factors for each trajectory. At baseline, participants' mean age was 58 years (SD, 5.3), 24.1% were women, 80.9% were African American, and 38.6% had difficulty performing 1 or more activities of daily living. We identified 4 distinct functional trajectories: minimal impairment in 136 participants (41.1%); persistent impairment in 81 (25.4%); partial improvement in 74 (23.5%); and decline in 28 (10.0%). Risk factors for persistent impairment included falls in the 6 months before baseline, depressive symptoms, and low physical performance. Although functional impairment improved in some homeless adults, it persisted or worsened in many others. These findings suggest that, similar to older adults in the general population, functional impairment among older homeless persons is not a transient phenomenon, but instead a chronic issue requiring long-term solutions."

Our hypothesis is that people experience and learn the underlying air quality to decide their adaptation, and they have a stronger incentive to behaviorally adapt to the air quality as it deteriorates. We tested our hypothesis on a sample of approximately 25,700 individuals from South Korea from 2002 to 2013 that contained information on daily doctor's visits due to respiratory disease. We matched individuals to the mean of the past seven-day concentration of the particulate matter of size between 2.5 and 10 micrometers (PM10) in their county of residence. We examined whether people living in counties with greater air pollution suffer less from respiratory disease when the concentration increases. For the analysis, we separated counties into quintiles based on their mean seven-day PM10, and regressed the binary indicator of a daily doctor's visit with a resulting diagnosis of respiratory disease on the seven-day PM10 concentration of the county of residence interacted with the quintile dummies. The key findings are that a 1-standard-deviation increase in the seven-day PM10 concentration in the two lowest quintiles is associated with an increase of 0.054 percentage points in the likelihood of a doctor's visit with a resulting diagnosis of respiratory disease, which is about 40% larger than the effect in higher quintiles, and the size of 1-standard-deviation gradually increases from 0.037 percentage points in the third quintile to 0.040 percentage points in the fifth quintile. The smaller increase in the likelihood of respiratory disease in more polluted locations can be explained by the behavioral adaptation to the environment, but the effectiveness of the adaptation seems limited among the highly polluted locations."
https://openalex.org/W2967555835,"Regulators of G Protein Signaling (RGS proteins) inhibit G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling by accelerating the GTP hydrolysis rate of activated Gα subunits. Some RGS proteins exert additional signal modulatory functions, and RGS12 is one such protein, with five additional, functional domains: a PDZ domain, a phosphotyrosine-binding domain, two Ras-binding domains, and a Gα·GDP-binding GoLoco motif. RGS12 expression is temporospatially regulated in developing mouse embryos, with notable expression in somites and developing skeletal muscle. We therefore examined whether RGS12 is involved in the skeletal muscle myogenic program. In the adult mouse, RGS12 is expressed in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle, and its expression is increased early after cardiotoxin-induced injury, suggesting a role in muscle regeneration. Consistent with a potential role in coordinating myogenic signals, RGS12 is also expressed in primary myoblasts; as these cells undergo differentiation and fusion into myotubes, RGS12 protein abundance is reduced. Myoblasts isolated from mice lacking Rgs12 expression have an impaired ability to differentiate into myotubes ex vivo, suggesting that RGS12 may play a role as a modulator/switch for differentiation. We also assessed the muscle regenerative capacity of mice conditionally deficient in skeletal muscle Rgs12 expression (via Pax7-driven Cre recombinase expression), following cardiotoxin-induced damage to the TA muscle. Eight days post-damage, mice lacking RGS12 in skeletal muscle had attenuated repair of muscle fibers. However, when mice lacking skeletal muscle expression of Rgs12 were cross-bred with mdx mice (a model of human Duchenne muscular dystrophy), no increase in muscle degeneration was observed over time. These data support the hypothesis that RGS12 plays a role in coordinating signals during the myogenic program in select circumstances, but loss of the protein may be compensated for within model syndromes of prolonged bouts of muscle damage and repair."
https://openalex.org/W2967637401,Reflective or translucent materials are a challenge to digitize in 3D. Results are better with a matt coating although objects from museum collections are often too fragile or too valuable to be treated in this way. It is therefore essential that alternative solutions are found. This study analyzed spectral photogrammetry as a possible solution. Spectral photogrammetry is an emerging technique which uses images at different wavelengths to create 3D models. Tooth enamel is a challenging material to digitize. Six sets of teeth were photographed at different wavelengths. The results showed that the quality of the models enamels parts improved when taken with ultraviolet wavelengths whilst models were less accurate when photogrammetry was performed with the red and infrared spectrum. This can be explained by the optical properties of enamel. This study demonstrates that knowing the optical properties of a material beforehand could help future photogrammetric digitization of challenging materials.
https://openalex.org/W2968415141,"Objective To assess triage compliance and the effect of the time from screening to triage on follow-up among HPV-positive women. Methods We recruited 1232 women in a screening campaign in Madagascar from February to October 2015. In the first period (February–May), HPV tests were performed remotely using the cobas test. In the second period (May–October), testing was performed on-site using the Xpert HPV assay. HPV-positive women were invited for triage with visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and Lugol’s iodine (VILI). Systematic biopsy and endocervical brushing were performed on all HPV-positive women for quality control. Three groups were defined according to time from HPV testing to triage invitation for HPV-positive women—Group I: delayed (> 3 months), Group II: prompt (24–48 hours), and Group III: immediate (< 24 hours). Results A total 1232 self-sampled HPV tests were performed in the study period (496 in Group I, 512 in Group II, and 224 in Group III). Participants’ mean age was 43.2 ± 9.3 years. Mean time from screening to VIA/VILI testing was 103.5 ± 43.6 days. Overall HPV prevalence was 28.0%. HPV prevalence was 27.2% in Group I (cobas test), 29.2% in Group 2 (Xpert test), and 26,7% in Group III (Xpert test). The VIA/VILI compliance rate was 77.8% for Group I, 82.7% for Group II, and 95.0% for Group III. Of women undergoing VIA/VILI, 56.3% in Group I and 43.5% in Groups II/III had positive results. Prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse among HPV-positive women was 9.8% for Group I and 6.8% for Groups II/III. Non-adherence was higher among rural women, uneducated women, and women in Group I. Conclusion HPV-positive women with immediate VIA/VILI triage invitation had the best triage compliance. A single-day test and triage strategy is preferred for low-resource settings."
https://openalex.org/W2969100470,"Patients with small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (SI-NETs) frequently develop spread disease; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms of disease progression are not known and effective preventive treatment strategies are lacking. Here, protein expression profiling was performed by HiRIEF-LC-MS in 14 primary SI-NETs from patients with and without liver metastases detected at the time of surgery and initial treatment. Among differentially expressed proteins, overexpression of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 was identified in samples from patients with liver metastasis. Further, NEDD8 correlation analysis indicated co-expression with RBX1, a key component in cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs). In vitro inhibition of neddylation with the therapeutic agent pevonedistat (MLN4924) resulted in a dramatic decrease of proliferation in SI-NET cell lines. Subsequent mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of pevonedistat effects and effects of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib revealed stabilization of multiple targets of CRLs including p27, an established tumor suppressor in SI-NET. Silencing of NEDD8 and RBX1 using siRNA resulted in a stabilization of p27, suggesting that the cellular levels of NEDD8 and RBX1 affect CRL activity. Inhibition of CRL activity, by either NEDD8/RBX1 silencing or pevonedistat treatment of cells resulted in induction of apoptosis that could be partially rescued by siRNA-based silencing of p27. Differential expression of both p27 and NEDD8 was confirmed in a second cohort of SI-NET using immunohistochemistry. Collectively, these findings suggest a role for CRLs and the ubiquitin proteasome system in suppression of p27 in SI-NET, and inhibition of neddylation as a putative therapeutic strategy in SI-NET."
https://openalex.org/W2966957790,"DNA replication stress is a major source of genomic instability and is closely linked to tumor formation and progression. Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerases1/2 (PARP1/2) enzymes are activated in response to replication stress resulting in poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) synthesis. PARylation plays an important role in the remodelling and repair of impaired replication forks, providing a rationale for targeting highly replicative cancer cells with PARP1/2 inhibitors. The human oncoprotein DEK is a unique, non-histone chromatin architectural protein whose deregulated expression is associated with the development of a wide variety of human cancers. Recently, we showed that DEK is a high-affinity target of PARylation and that it promotes the progression of impaired replication forks. Here, we investigated a potential functional link between PAR and DEK in the context of replication stress. Under conditions of mild replication stress induced either by topoisomerase1 inhibition with camptothecin or nucleotide depletion by hydroxyurea, we found that the effect of acute PARP1/2 inhibition on replication fork progression is dependent on DEK expression. Reducing DEK protein levels also overcomes the restart impairment of stalled forks provoked by blocking PARylation. Non-covalent DEK-PAR interaction via the central PAR-binding domain of DEK is crucial for counteracting PARP1/2 inhibition as shown for the formation of RPA positive foci in hydroxyurea treated cells. Finally, we show by iPOND and super resolved microscopy that DEK is not directly associated with the replisome since it binds to DNA at the stage of chromatin formation. Our report sheds new light on the still enigmatic molecular functions of DEK and suggests that DEK expression levels may influence the sensitivity of cancer cells to PARP1/2 inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2967266541,"This paper presents an evaluation of the effectiveness of two types of deceleration markings on freeways in China: fishbone-shaped (FS) markings and edge-rate (ER) markings. An actual 4-lane, 6-km long freeway in Province Hebei was created in a driving simulator and used for the experiments. Three scenarios of deceleration markings were adopted: one without markings, one with FS markings, and the third with ER markings. For each scenario, three traffic flow levels were adopted (low, medium, and heavy). The appropriate dimensions of deceleration markings were first established using relevant design guidelines and then used to develop the simulation scenarios using Multigen Creator software. Sixty drivers carried out the simulation experiments with eye tracker equipment. The adequacy of deceleration markings was analyzed with respect to speed, perceived distance, pupil diameter, and geometric parameters. The results showed that both types of deceleration markings made a certain effect on vehicle speed, drivers'visual behavior, and mental characteristics. However, the effect of the FS markings was more pronounced than that of the ER marking. Specifically, the FS markings showed a speed reduction of 12.3 km/h to 15.2 km/h and a perceived distance of 70 m to 90 m, compared with 6.7 km/h to 9.9 km/h and 40 m to 60 m, respectively, for the ER markings. Application comments of the results are provided in the conclusion."
https://openalex.org/W2967981306,"Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), severe drug reactions, are often misdiagnosed due to their rarity and lack of information on differential diagnosis. The objective of the study was to develop an electronic medical record (EMR)-based algorithm to identify patients with SJS/TEN for future application in database studies. From the EMRs of a university hospital, two dermatologists identified all 13 patients with SJS/TEN seen at the Department of Dermatology as the case group. Another 1472 patients who visited the Department of Dermatology were identified using the ICD-10 codes for diseases requiring differentiation from SJS/TEN. One hundred of these patients were then randomly sampled as controls. Based on clinical guidelines for SJS/TEN and the experience of the dermatologists, we tested 128 algorithms based on the use of ICD-10 codes, clinical courses for SJS/TEN, medical encounters for mucocutaneous lesions from SJS/TEN, and items to exclude paraneoplastic pemphigus. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of each algorithm were calculated, and the optimal algorithm was defined as that with high PPV and maximal sensitivity and specificity. One algorithm, consisting of a combination of clinical course for SJS/TEN, medical encounters for mucocutaneous lesions from SJS/TEN, and items to exclude paraneoplastic pemphigus, but not ICD-10 codes, showed a sensitivity of 76.9%, specificity of 99.0%, PPV of 40.5%, NPV of 99.8%, and DOR of 330.00. We developed a potentially optimized algorithm for identifying SJS/TEN based on clinical practice records. The almost perfect specificity of this algorithm will prevent bias in estimating relative risks of SJS/TEN in database studies. Considering the small sample size, this algorithm should be further tested in different settings."
https://openalex.org/W2968454964,"Previous surveys of neonatal medicine in China have not collected comprehensive information on antibiotic use in newborns. The goal of the present study was to assess the trends in antibiotic use in inpatient newborns from advanced hospitals in mainland China and to evaluate the contributing factors. We extracted retrospective data on newborn clinical units from a database containing key clinical subspecialty area indicators from provincial or ministerial (Class A level III) hospitals over three consecutive years (2008–2010) and in 25 of 31 provincial districts of mainland China. Fifty-five newborn units were included in the study. The results showed that two thirds (65.7% ± 23.1%) of inpatient newborns were prescribed antibiotic products. Antibiotic use rates were significantly different by newborn ward bed capacity (p = 0.023; 60.6% for d capacity (ficant65.7% ± 23–100 beds group, and 77.1% for (ficant65.7% ± 23.1%) of inpatient newb significantly different by type of hospital, geographic area, admission to physician or nurse ratio, or physician or nurse academic degree. Factors contributing significantly to antibiotic use included ward bed capacity, physician to nurse ratio, average hospital stay, and pneumonia to preterm infant ratio. Our data suggested that the use of antibiotics among inpatient newborns in advanced hospitals in mainland China was prevalent and should be subject to rigorous monitoring, and highlighted the need to explore how newborn ward bed capacity potentially impacts antibiotic use."
https://openalex.org/W2968570425,"The advent of new technologies in medical imaging and 3D printing in recent years has made customization of surgical tools and implants more accessible, revolutionizing many surgical fields. In many human diseases, these implants have led to superior surgical outcomes and greatly improved patients’ quality of life. Thus, it is of great interest to apply these technologies to the treatment of animal diseases. In this study, we report the use of computed tomography (CT) and 3D printing for the treatment of a Great Hornbill at Jurong Bird Park that was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the casque. A 3D printed prosthesis that perfectly fitted the subject was implanted to replace its resected casque. The subject exhibited natural eating behaviour with no post-operative complications. Using this case as an example, the positive outcomes suggest a great potential in applying these technologies to the treatment of other wildlife diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2968988470,"Infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV) in pregnancy may lead to serious outcomes both for the mother and the newborn. Targeted screening and vaccination of non-immune women during reproductive age could prevent varicella infection in pregnancy. Currently, no universal varicella screening of pregnant women is implemented in Norway, but serological testing in pregnancy is recommended in particular situations. We examined seroprevalence of VZV in a national pregnancy cohort in order to help assess a need for VZV screening of women during reproductive age.We determined the susceptibility to VZV and the reliability of self-reported history of VZV infection in the Norwegian obstetric population by using a random sample of 1,184 pregnant women from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort study (MoBa). The MoBa study included approximately 95,200 pregnant women in Norway between 1998 and 2009. Blood samples taken at gestational week 17-18 were analysed using a commercial enzyme immunoassay for specific IgG antibodies to Varicella-Zoster virus. Second sample taken at birth was tested if the first sample result was negative or equivocal.Of the 1,184 pregnant women, 98.6% (n = 1,167) were seropositive, 0.83% (n = 10) remained seronegative, and four women (0.34%) seroconverted during their pregnancy. No significant associations were found between serological status and women's age at birth, gestational age, women's country of birth and year of child's birth. One woman reported prior history of varicella, whereas 143 (12.1%) women reported a household exposure to childhood diseases with fever and rash, of which 25 reported exposure to varicella, of which all were seropositive.The findings support antenatal screening recommendations in Norway advising testing for VZV in pregnant women with unknown immunity to VZV. Further studies are however needed to better identify target groups for screening and vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2969031389,"Proactive people take initiative when others do not and persist in improving their environment or themselves. Although scholars assume that how we feel influences how proactive we are, there is no experimental research yet to support this. This experiment therefore tests whether positive and negative affect influence proactive behavior and additionally investigates whether engaging in proactivity also has affective consequences. While current theory proposes that positive affect enhances proactive behavior by stimulating broad-flexible thinking, we argue that negative affect should make people proactive through stimulating systematic-persistent thinking. Furthermore, we propose that proactive behavior increases subsequent positive affect rather than positive affect increasing proactive behavior. Last, we hypothesize that affective causes and consequences of proactive behavior are different for people who are rarely proactive (trait-passive-reactive individuals) and people who are often proactive (trait-proactive individuals). We pre-tested 180 participants on trait-proactivity. In the lab, we manipulated affect (negative/positive/neutral), measured proactive behavior in a team interaction task, and repeatedly measured participants' affective experiences and physiological activation. Results showed that the link between affect and proactive behavior differed depending on participants' trait-proactivity. First, positive affect made trait-proactive individuals less proactive, whereas negative affect made passive-reactive individuals more proactive. Second, passive-reactive individuals reported decreased negative affect after engaging in proactivity, whereas proactive individuals reported increased positive affect. These results suggest that proactive behavior can serve an affect regulation purpose, which is different for trait proactive individuals (up regulating positive affect) than for trait passive-reactive individuals (down regulating negative affect). These results are limited to core affect (feeling pleasant or unpleasant) and do not apply to specific emotions (feeling proud or anxious), and they are limited to short term and successful proactive behavior and do not apply to more long term, or unsuccessful proactive behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2967779101,"While there have been many studies using machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict process outcomes and device performance in semiconductor manufacturing, the extensively developed technology computer-aided design (TCAD) physical models should play a more significant role in conjunction with ML. While TCAD models have been effective in predicting the trends of experiments, a machine learning statistical model is more capable of predicting the anomalous effects that can be dependent on the chambers, machines, fabrication environment, and specific layouts. In this paper, we use an analytics-statistics mixed training (ASMT) approach using TCAD. Under this method, the TCAD models are incorporated into the machine learning training procedure. The mixed dataset with the experimental and TCAD results improved the prediction in terms of accuracy. With the application of ASMT to the BOSCH process, we show that the mean square error (MSE) can be effectively decreased when the analytics-statistics mixed training (ASMT) scheme is used instead of the classic neural network (NN) used in the baseline study. In this method, statistical induction and analytical deduction can be combined to increase the prediction accuracy of future intelligent semiconductor manufacturing."
https://openalex.org/W2968130864,"This paper studies the heterogeneous effects of exchange rate and stock market on carbon emission allowance price in four emissions trading scheme pilots in China. We employ a panel quantile regression model, which can describe both individual and distributional heterogeneity. The empirical results illustrate that the effects of explanatory variables on carbon emission allowance price is heterogeneous along the whole quantiles. Specifically, exchange rate has a negative effect on carbon emission allowance price at lower quantiles, while becomes a positive effect at higher quantiles. In addition, a negative effect exists between domestic stock market and carbon emission allowance price, and the intensity decreasing along with the increase of quantile. By contrast, an increasing positive effect is discovered between European stock market and domestic carbon emission allowance prices. Finally, heterogeneous effects on carbon emission allowance price can also be proved in European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU-ETS)."

https://openalex.org/W2969138488,"During the lactation period, rat pups are fed by the dam, and the patterns of mother-pup interaction change during this period. Additionally, there are changes in feeding; first, mother´s milk is the only food needed for sustenance, and later, it is combined with solid food and water. GH serum concentrations depend on both maternal-pup interaction and energy metabolism. In the artificial rearing (AR) procedure, pups are deprived of mother-pup interaction, and the feeding pattern is controlled. This rearing paradigm has been used in rats to analyze the effects of maternal deprivation on social behavior. In the present study, we analyzed the variation in GH, acylated ghrelin and IGF-1 serum concentrations throughout the lactation period in AR pups. At pnd7, the maternal rearing (MR) pups responded to a 4 h fast with a drop in GH serum concentration, which is a well-known response to maternal deprivation. GH serum levels in the AR pups did not change, suggesting an adaptation phenomenon. A dopamine inhibitory effect of GH secretion was observed in pnd7 cultured somatotropes, suggesting dopamine regulation of GH secretion at this age. Acylated ghrelin serum levels in the AR pups showed an inverted pattern compared to that in the MR pups, which was related to the artificial feeding pattern. IGF-1 serum levels were lower in the AR pups than in MR pups, which was associated with hepatic GH resistance and with low Igf1 mRNA expression at pnd7. Interestingly, at pnd14, both pup groups showed high hepatic Igf1 mRNA expression but low IGF-1 serum levels, and this was inverted at pnd21. However, serum glucose levels were lower in the AR pups at pnd14 but reached the same levels as the MR pups at pnd21. Moreover, hepatomegaly and higher hepatic GH-receptor levels were observed in the AR pups at pnd21, which was in agreement with an absence of a solid food meal. During AR, the pups lost the maternal interaction-stimulated GH secretion, which correlated with lower IGF-1 serum levels during the first week of postnatal development. Later, the AR pups exhibited hepatic responses, in order to satisfy the metabolic demand for the normal weaning, with low carbohydrates levels in their meal."
https://openalex.org/W2968935440,"This study aimed to assess patient investigational medication knowledge and to identify factors associated with medication understanding by adult outpatients included in clinical trials. A cross-sectional prospectively designed survey was conducted on consecutive volunteers at 21 university teaching hospitals (in France) from February to December 2014. Investigational medication understanding was assessed at the time of the first dispensing using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire based on information obtained from the literature that provided an 8-point score. Demographic and other baseline data were collected using structured interviews. Of the 236 participants, 139 (58.9%) of the respondents were male, and the median age was 54.9 years (range: 18–83 years). The mean understanding score was 6.24 and 72.5% of the patients had a score of 6 or higher. In univariate analysis, the medication understanding score was negatively correlated with age (r = -0.15, p = 0.0247) and positively correlated with the level of education (r = 0.25, p = 0.0002). In multivariate analysis, prognostic factors of a higher medication understanding score were: graduation from high school or a higher level of education; HIV infection; phase II/III/IV studies; mention of the drug on the prescription form, and the dispensing of a single investigational medication. Only a quarter of the adult outpatients included in clinical trials had a maximum possible investigational medication understanding score. Being old and having a low level of education were found to be important risk factors for inadequate medication understanding. This and other data suggest that sponsors should encourage initiatives aimed at improving investigational medication understanding in adults enrolled in clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2969058135,"Over the last few decades, the Internet has experienced tremendous growth in data traffic. This continuous growth due to the increase in the number of connected devices and platforms has dramatically boosted content consumption. However, retrieving content from the servers of Content Providers (CPs) can increase network traffic and incur high network delay and congestion. To address these challenges, we propose a joint deep learning and auction-based approach for congestion-aware caching in Named Data Networking (NDN), which aims to prevent congestion and minimize the content downloading delays. First, using recorded network traffic data on the Internet Service Provider (ISP) network, we propose a deep learning model to predict future traffic over transit links. Second, to prevent congestion and avoid high latency on transit links, which may experience congestion in the future; we propose a caching model that helps the ISP to cache content that has a high predicted future demand. Paid-content requires payment to be downloaded and cached. Therefore, we propose an auction mechanism to obtain paid-content at an optimal price. The simulation results show that our proposal prevents congestion and increases the profits of both ISPs and CPs."

This article reports on quality of data on child health and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) indicators in Botswana. The main objective of the study was to assess the quality of administrative data from Expanded Immunization Program (EPI) and condom use, Depo-Provera uptake and domiciliary care attendance in Botswana. This was a retrospective study entailing a review of data retrieved from district health records and District Health Information System (DHIS). A total of 30 clinics and health posts were randomly selected from two cities, a town and three rural villages which makes up 6 districts commonly denoted urban, semi-urban and rural respectively. Through a stratified random sampling health facilities were selected. EPI data (Penta 3- third dose of pentavalent vaccine and Measles vaccine) and SRH data (condom use, Depo-Provera uptake and Domiciliary care) were assessed for completeness, discrepancies and verification factor using WHO Routine data quality (RDQA) assessment tool. A verification score of less than 90%% was considered as underreporting while more than 110% is over reporting. However, the score which is within +-10% is acceptable, reliable and a good indicator of data quality and reporting system. About 56% (9/16) SRH indicators had a verification factor score outside the accepted range and 87% (13/15) discrepancy value outside the accepted range. For immunization, 10% (1/10) had a verification factor score outside the accepted range and 33% (3/9) had a discrepancy value outside the accepted range. The level of completeness was high for both Penta3 and Measles coverage and it was lowest for condom. Our findings highlight a poorer data quality for SRH indicators compared to child health indicators. A comprehensive program review drawing lessons from the child health indicators is required to improve the quality of administrative data in Botswana."
