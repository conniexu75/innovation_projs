https://openalex.org/W3216259585,"Solar thermal collectors distribute, capture, and transform the solar energy into a solar thermal concentration device. The present paper provides a mathematical model for analyzing the flow characteristics and transport of heat to solar collectors (SCs) from non-Newtonian nanofluids. The non-Newtonian power-law scheme is considered for the nanofluid through partial slip constraints at the boundary of a porous flat surface. The nanofluid is assumed to differ in viscosity and thermal conductivity linearly with temperature changes and the magnetic field is appliqued to the stream in the transverse direction. The method of similarity conversion is used to convert the governing structure of partial differential formulas into the system of ordinary differential ones. Using the Keller box procedure, the outcoming ordinary differential formulas along with partial slip constraints are numerically resolved. A discussion on the flowing and heat transport characteristics of nanofluid influenced by power law index, Joule heating parameter, MHD parameter and slip parameters are included from a physical point of view. Comparison of temperature profiles showed a marked temperature increase in the boundary layer due to Joule heating. The thickness of the motion boundary-layer is minimized and the transport of heat through boundary-layer is improved with the partial slip velocity and magnetic parameters rising. Finally, With an increase in the Eckert number, the distribution of temperature within boundary layer is increased."
https://openalex.org/W3216754201,"Background Vietnam is one of the fastest-aging countries in the world with a rising number of people with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). Families in Vietnam provide most of the care for persons living with dementia, yet our understanding of their experiences and needs is limited. This study examined the family caregiving experience in a semi-rural region outside of central Hanoi from the perspectives of family caregivers and other key informants. Materials Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 key stakeholders (12 family caregivers and 9 healthcare providers and community leaders). A descriptive, thematic analysis was conducted. Results Qualitative data analysis revealed four themes related to the family caregiving experience: 1) perceptions of dementia symptoms as a normal part of aging rather than a disease, 2) caregiving as a moral and expected familial obligation, 3) patterns of caregiving that are heavily influenced by both gender and sibling order, and 4) multiple challenges or hardships, including time constraints, loss of income, increased social isolation, a toll on their perceived physical health, and emotional distress. Caregivers rejected the notion that caregiving was a “burden” and expressed their distress through terms such as frustration, sadness, and exhaustion. Conclusions In this low-resource setting, the stress of family caregiving may be amplified by lack of community resources, cultural stigma discouraging outside help-seeking, and economic impact of care provision. The study highlights the vulnerability and predicament of Vietnamese women who often face multiple challenges in their caregiving role as well as the urgent need for the development of community-based programs and supports."
https://openalex.org/W3217296107,"Human agriculture, wastewater, and use of fossil fuels have saturated ecosystems with nitrogen and phosphorus, threatening biodiversity and human water security at a global scale. Despite efforts to reduce nutrient pollution, carbon and nutrient concentrations have increased or remained high in many regions. Here, we applied a new ecohydrological framework to ~12,000 water samples collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from streams and lakes across the contiguous U.S. to identify spatial and temporal patterns in nutrient concentrations and leverage (an indicator of flux). For the contiguous U.S. and within ecoregions, we quantified trends for sites sampled repeatedly from 2000 to 2019, the persistence of spatial patterns over that period, and the patch size of nutrient sources and sinks. While we observed various temporal trends across ecoregions, the spatial patterns of nutrient and carbon concentrations in streams were persistent across and within ecoregions, potentially because of historical nutrient legacies, consistent nutrient sources, and inherent differences in nutrient removal capacity for various ecosystems. Watersheds showed strong critical source area dynamics in that 2-8% of the land area accounted for 75% of the estimated flux. Variability in nutrient contribution was greatest in catchments smaller than 250 km2 for most parameters. An ensemble of four machine learning models confirmed previously observed relationships between nutrient concentrations and a combination of land use and land cover, demonstrating how human activity and inherent nutrient removal capacity interactively determine nutrient balance. These findings suggest that targeted nutrient interventions in a small portion of the landscape could substantially improve water quality at continental scales. We recommend a dual approach of first prioritizing the reduction of nutrient inputs in catchments that exert disproportionate influence on downstream water chemistry, and second, enhancing nutrient removal capacity by restoring hydrological connectivity both laterally and vertically in stream networks."
https://openalex.org/W3216616806,"Rapid assessments have been emerging on the effects of COVID-19, yet rigorous analyses remain scant. Here, rigorous evidence of the impacts of COVID-19 on several livelihood outcomes are presented, with a particular focus on heterogenous effects of COVID-19. We use a household-level panel dataset consisting of 880 data points collected in rural Bangladesh in 2018 and 2020, and employ difference-in-differences with fixed effects regression techniques. Results suggest that COVID-19 had significant and heterogenous effects on livelihood outcomes. Agricultural production and share of production sold were reduced, especially for rice crops. Further, diet diversity and education expenditure were reduced for the total sample. Households primarily affected by (fear of) sickness had a significantly lower agricultural production, share of crop market sales, and lower health and education expenditure, compared to households affected by other COVID-19 effects, such as travel restrictions. In turn, (fear of) sickness and the correlated reduced incidence of leaving the house, resulted in higher off-farm incomes suggesting that households engage in less physically demanding and localized work. Policy-makers need to be cognizant of these heterogenous COVID-19 effects and formulate policies that are targeted at those households that are most vulnerable (e.g., unable/willing to leave the house due to (fear of) sickness)."
https://openalex.org/W3215052529,"Men with have sex with men (MSM) in Africa face high levels of stigma due to elevated HIV exposure (actual or perceived), same-sex practices, and gender non-conformity. These stigmas are documented barriers to HIV prevention and treatment. Most stigma-reduction interventions have focused on single-level targets (e.g., health care facility level [HCF]) and addressed one type of stigma (e.g., HIV), without engaging the multiple intersecting stigmas that MSM encounter. Determining the feasibility and acceptability of multi-level intervention of reducing intersectional stigma and estimating its efficacy on increasing HIV testing are needed.We proposed a mixed method study among MSM in Ghana. First, we will develop the intervention protocol using the Convergence Framework, which combines three interventions that were previously implemented separately in Ghana for reducing stigma at the HCF-level, increasing HIV testing at the peer group-level, and increasing peer social support at the individual-level. Then, we will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial with four pairs of HCFs matched on staff size. HCFs within each pair are randomized to the HCF-level stigma-reduction intervention or control arm. MSM (n = 216) will be randomized to receive the group-level and individual-level interventions or standard of care control arm. MSM will be assigned to receive HIV testing at one of the HCFs that match their study assignment (intervention or control facility). The frequency of HIV testing between MSM in the study arms at 3 and 6 months will be compared, and the predictors of HIV testing uptake at the HCF, peer group and individual-levels will be assessed using multi-level regression models.These findings from this study will provide important evidence to inform a hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial of a public health intervention strategy for increasing HIV case detection among key populations in sub-Saharan African communities. Accurate information on HIV prevalence can facilitate epidemic control through more precise deployment of public health measures aimed at HIV treatment and viral load suppression, which eliminates risk of transmission.This study was prospectively registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT04108078, on September 27, 2019."
https://openalex.org/W3215187624,"Plasma-derived intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) products contain a dynamic spectrum of immunoglobulin (Ig) G reactivities reflective of the donor population from which they are derived. We sought to model the concentration of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG which could be expected in future plasma pool and final-product batches of CSL Behring's immunoglobulin product Privigen.Data was extracted from accessible databases, including the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status, antibody titre in convalescent and vaccinated groups and antibody half-life. Together, these parameters were used to create an integrated mathematical model that could be used to predict anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in future IVIg preparations.We predict that anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentration will peak in batches produced in mid-October 2021, containing levels in the vicinity of 190-fold that of the mean convalescent (unvaccinated) plasma concentration. An elevated concentration (approximately 35-fold convalescent plasma) is anticipated to be retained in batches produced well into 2022. Measurement of several Privigen batches using the Phadia™ EliA™ SARS-CoV-2-Sp1 IgG binding assay confirmed the early phase of this model.The work presented in this paper may have important implications for physicians and patients who use Privigen for indicated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3215296770,"The study examined if maturity status bio-banding reduces within-group variance in anthropometric, physical fitness and functional movement characteristics of 319, under-14 and under-15 players from 19 UK professional soccer academies. Bio-banding reduced the within-bio-banded group variance for anthropometric values, when compared to an aggregated chronological banded group (chronological: 5.1-16.7%CV; bio-banded: 3.0-17.3%CV). Differences between these bio-banded groups ranged from moderate to very large (ES = 0.97 to 2.88). Physical performance variance (chronological: 4.8-24.9%CV; bio-banded: 3.8-26.5%CV) was also reduced with bio-banding compared to chronological aged grouping. However, not to the same extent as anthropometric values with only 68.3% of values reduced across banding methods compared to 92.6% for anthropometric data. Differences between the bio-banded groups physical qualities ranged from trivial to very large (ES = 0.00 to 3.00). The number of functional movement metrics and %CV reduced by bio-banding was lowest within the 'circa-PHV' groups (11.1-44.4%). The proportion of players achieving the threshold value score of ≥ 14 for the FMS™ was highest within the 'post-PHV' group (50.0-53.7%). The use of maturity status bio-banding can create more homogenous groups which may encourage greater competitive equity. However, findings here support a bio-banding maturity effect hypothesis, whereby maturity status bio-banding has a heightened effect on controlling for characteristics which have a stronger association to biological growth."
https://openalex.org/W3216092381,"Now-a-days, plant-based extracts, as a cheap source of growth activators, are being widely used to treat plants grown under extreme climatic conditions. So, a trial was conducted to assess the response of two maize (Zea mays L.) varieties, Sadaf (drought tolerant) and Sultan (drought sensitive) to foliar-applied sugar beet extract (SBE) under varying water-deficit conditions. Different SBE (control, 1%, 2%, 3% & 4%) levels were used in this study, and plants were exposed to water-deficit [(75% and 60% of field capacity (FC)] and control (100% FC) conditions. It was observed that root and shoot dry weights (growth), total soluble proteins, RWC-relative water contents, total phenolics, chlorophyll pigments and leaf area per plant decreased under different water stress regimes. While, proline, malondialdehyde (MDA), RMP-relative membrane permeability, H2O2-hydrogen peroxide and the activities of antioxidant enzymes [CAT-catalase, POD-peroxidase and SOD-superoxide dismutase] were found to be improved in water stress affected maize plants. Exogenous application of varying levels of SBE ameliorated the negative effects of water-deficit stress by enhancing the growth attributes, photosynthetic pigments, RWC, proline, glycinebetaine (GB), activities of POD and CAT enzymes and levels of total phenolics, whereas it reduced the lipid peroxidation in both maize varieties under varying water stress levels. It was noted that 3% and 4% levels of SBE were more effective than the other levels used in enhancing the growth as well as other characteristics of the maize varieties. Overall, the sugar beet extract proved to be beneficial for improving growth and metabolism of maize plants exposed to water stress."
https://openalex.org/W3216527919,"Several nonlanguage factors influence literacy development, and motor skills are among those most studied. Despite the publication of several studies that have supported the existence of this relationship, the type of influence and underlying mechanisms have been little explored. Herein, we propose modeling the relationship between motor skills and literacy through structural equation modeling, testing the contribution of executive functions and handwriting skills as the possible mediators of this relationship. In a study of 278 third-grade children, we used a wide range of measures related to written language (reading, spelling, reading comprehension, and written production), fine motor skills (dominant hand, nondominant hand, and bimanual dexterity), executive functions (verbal and visuospatial working memory, inhibition, and shifting), and handwriting. Structural equation modeling of the relationship between these different variables indicated that in the third grade, the influence of fine motor skills on literacy is fully mediated by both executive functions and handwriting skills. These motor skills effects are observed for both low levels of processing (reading, spelling) and high levels of processing (reading comprehension, written production). The results are discussed in terms of the potential mechanisms underlying different literacy skills and their implications for pedagogical programs."
https://openalex.org/W3217262997,"This study explores the development of Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for detection of rose rosette virus (RRV), a technique with the potential to be translated to rose nurseries. RRV is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus which is a member of the genus Emaravirus (Family Fimoviridae) and the causal agent of the rose rosette disease (RRD). Although RRV symptoms are characteristics, early visual diagnosis of RRD can be misleading and confusing since it may appear like herbicide damage. Moreover, it may take incubation time for symptoms to appear after virus infection. Two sets of RRV gene sequences RNA3 and RNA4 were analyzed and two sets of four LAMP primers were designed. The direct antigen-capture method for direct trapping of RRV in plastic was used for RNA extraction followed by cDNA synthesis. RT-LAMP reactions were for 1 hour at 64°C (RRV-P3) and 66.5°C (RRV-P4) using either a thermocycler or a portable dry bath. RT-qLAMP was also optimized using DNA polymerase GspSSD LD using the same RRV sets of primers. RRV was detected in symptomatic and non-symptomatic RRD tissue from Oklahoma. The limit of detection (LoD) was 1pg/μL and 1 fg/μL using Bst 2.0 LAMP and GspSSD LD quantitative LAMP, respectively. In visual colorimetric pre- and post-reactions, the LoD was 10 pg/μL and 0.1 pg/μL using hydroxy naphthol blue (HNB, 120 μM) and SYBR green I (1:10 dilution), respectively. No cross-reactivity was detected in the RT-LAMP reaction testing cDNAs of eight commonly co-infecting rose viruses and one virus taxonomically related to RRV. Four different dyes were tested, and visible colorimetric reactions were obtained with RT-LAMP Bst 2.0 combined with SYBR I or HNB. RT-qLAMP with GspSSD2.0 offers LoD equal to RT-PCR and it is faster since it works with RNA directly."
https://openalex.org/W3217754982,"Current data indicates 70% of adults with obesity report experiencing bias and stigmatisation when engaging with healthcare. Most studies to date, have focused on weight bias from a healthcare professional's perspective. Few have explored weight bias from the perspective of the individual living with obesity and no study has conducted this research in the Irish context.This study explored, the lived-in experience of individuals afflicted with obesity, when interacting with the Irish healthcare system. It examined whether participants encountered weight bias and stigma, if so, how it may have impacted them and gathered their suggestions on how it could be best addressed.Employing a phenomenological approach, purposive sampling and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 individuals living with class II (BMI 35.0-39.9) or III obesity (BMI ≥40kg/m2) who reported regular and consistent engagement with the Irish healthcare system. Predominant emergent themes were categorised using the interview domains; (1) experiences of obesity bias and stigma, (2) impact of this bias and stigma and (3) suggested avenues to reduce bias and stigma.Participants reported experiencing high levels of weight bias and stigmatisation. Relating to experiences, three themes were identified; interpersonal communication, focus of care and physical environment. In terms of its impact, there were two emergent themes; negativity towards future healthcare and escalation of unhealthy behaviours. Suggested avenues to eliminate bias and stigma included the introduction of a timely and clear clinical pathway for obesity management and a focus on HCPs education in relation to obesity causes and complexity.Outside of specialist obesity tertiary care, weight bias and stigmatisation is commonly reported in the Irish healthcare system. It is a significant issue for those living with obesity, detrimental to their physiological and psychological health. A concerted effort by HCPs across clinical, research and educational levels is required to alleviate its harmful effects."
https://openalex.org/W3215011527,"Poultry infected with Salmonella mount an immune response initially, however the immune responses eventually disappear leading the bird to be a carrier of Salmonella. The hypothesis of this study is that Salmonella infection induces T regulatory cell numbers and cytokine production and suppress host T cells locally in the gut to escape the host immune responses. An experiment was conducted to comparatively analyze the effect of S. enterica ser. Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) and S. enterica ser. Heidelberg (S. Heidelberg) infection on CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cell properties in chickens. A total of 144 broiler chicks were randomly distributed into three experimental groups of non-infected control, S. Enteritidis infected and S. Heidelberg infected groups. Chickens were orally inoculated with PBS (control) or 5x106 CFU/mL of either S. Enteritidis or S. Heidelberg at 3 d of age. Each group was replicated in six pens with eight chickens per pen. Chickens infected with S. Enteritidis had 6.2, 5.4, and 3.8 log10 CFU/g, and chickens infected with S. Heidelberg had 7.1, 4.8, and 4.1 log10 CFU/g Salmonella in the cecal contents at 4, 11, and 32 dpi, respectively. Both S. Enteritidis and S. Heidelberg were recovered from the liver and spleen 4 dpi. At 4, 11, and 32 dpi, chickens infected with S. Enteritidis and S. Heidelberg had increased CD4+CD25+ cell numbers as well as IL-10 mRNA transcription of CD4+CD25+ cells compared to that in the control group. CD4+CD25+ cells from S. Enteritidis- and S. Heidelberg-infected chickens and restimulated with 1 μg antigen in vitro, had higher (P < 0.05) IL-10 mRNA transcription than the CD4+CD25+ cells from the non-infected controls Though at 4dpi, chickens infected with S. Enteritidis and S. Heidelberg had a significant (P < 0.05) increase in CD4+CD25- IL-2, IL-1β, and IFNγ mRNA transcription, the CD4+CD25- IL-2, IL-1β, and IFNγ mRNA transcription, were comparable to that in the control group at 11 and 32dpi identifying that the host inflammatory response against Salmonella disappears at 11 dpi. It can be concluded that S. Enteritidis and S. Heidelberg infection at 3 d of age induces a persistent infection through inducing CD4+CD25+ cells and altering the IL-10 mRNA transcription of CD4+CD25+ cell numbers and cytokine production in chickens between 3 to 32 dpi allowing chickens to become asymptomatic carriers of Salmonella after 18 dpi."
https://openalex.org/W3215465622,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and also the most invasive brain cancer. GBM progression is rapid and its prognosis is poor. Therefore, finding molecular targets in GBM is a critical goal that could also play important roles in clinical diagnostics and treatments to improve patient prognosis. We jointly analyzed the GSE103227, GSE103229, and TCGA databases for differentially expressed RNA species, obtaining 52 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), 31 microRNAs (miRNAs), and 186 mRNAs, which were used to build a competing endogenous RNA network. Kaplan-Meier and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses revealed five survival-related lncRNAs: H19, LINC01574, LINC01614, RNF144A-AS1, and OSMR-AS1. With multiple optimization mRNAs, we found the H19-hsa-miR-338-3P-NRP1 regulatory pathway. Additionally, we noted high NRP1 expression in GBM patients, and Kaplan-Meier and ROC analyses showed that NRP1 expression was associated with GBM prognosis. Cox analysis indicated that NRP1 is an independent prognostic factor in GBM patients. In conclusion, H19 and hsa-miR-338-3P regulate NRP1 expression, and this pathway plays an important role in GBM."
https://openalex.org/W3216383355,"After a complete remission to treatment for hepatoblastoma, some children still have recurrence. We identified and explored the factors that influence recurrence after complete remission in a retrospective study.Of 197 children with hepatoblastoma, 140 (71.1%) achieved initial complete remission and were enrolled in factor analysis. Variables consisted of age, sex, PRE-Treatment EXTent of tumor (PRETEXT) stage, pathologic type, metastatic disease, serum alpha-fetoprotein level, vascular involvement, and surgical margin status. We employed univariate and multivariate analyses to assess the relationship between each factor and tumor recurrence.Of 140 children who achieved initial complete remission, 42 (30%) had recurrent hepatoblastoma. The 5-year overall survival rates for the non-recurrence and recurrence group were 99.0% and 78.6%, respectively. The overall 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were 77.8%, 69.8%, and 69.8%, respectively. All recurrences occurred within 2 years from complete remission. The RFS rate was significantly higher in children younger than 3 years and in those with mixed pathological type, PRETEXT II and III, without metastatic disease, without vascular involvement, and microscopic negative margin than in that of children older than 3 years, with epithelial pathological type, PRETEXT IV, metastatic disease, vascular involvement, and macroscopic positive margin (P < 0.001, = 0.020, < 0.001, = 0.004, = 0.002, and < 0.001, respectively). The independent risk factors for recurrence after complete remission were age ≥3 years, PRETEXT IV, and metastatic disease (P < 0.05).Age, PRETEXT stage, metastatic disease, vascular involvement, pathologic type, and surgical margin status might be associated with recurrent hepatoblastoma after complete remission; meanwhile, age ≥3 years, PRETEXT IV, and metastatic disease are independent risk factors of recurrence. Further research is needed on the causes of tumor recurrence, which may improve the long-term outcomes of children with hepatoblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W3203028626,"Online data collection offers a wide range of benefits including access to larger and more diverse populations, together with a reduction in the experiment cycle. Here we compare performance in a spatial memory task, in which participants had to estimate object locations following viewpoint shifts, using data from a controlled lab-based setting and from an unsupervised online sample. We found that the data collected in a conventional laboratory setting and those collected online produced very similar results, although the online data was more variable with standard errors being about 10% larger than those of the data collected in the lab. Overall, our findings suggest that spatial memory studies using static images can be successfully carried out online with unsupervised samples. However, given the higher variability of the online data, it is recommended that the online sample size is increased to achieve similar standard errors to those obtained in the lab. For the current study and data processing procedures, this would require an online sample 25% larger than the lab sample."
https://openalex.org/W3214744074,"Direct-to-consumer genetic testing is marketed as a tool to uncover ancestry and kin. Recent studies of actual and potential users have demonstrated that individuals' responses to the use of these tests for these purposes are complex, with privacy, disruptive consequences, potential for misuse, and secondary use by law enforcement cited as potential concerns. We conducted six focus groups with a diverse sample of participants (n = 62) who were aware of but had not used direct-to-consumer genetic tests, in an effort to understand more about what people considering these tests think about the potential value, risks, and benefits of such testing, taking into account use by third parties, such as potential kin and law enforcement. Participants differed widely in the perceived value of direct-to-consumer genetic tests for ancestry and kinship information for their own lives, including the desirability of contact with previously unknown relatives. Some perceived ancestry testing as mere curiosity or entertainment, while others, particularly those who had gaps in their family history, few living relatives, or who were adopted, saw greater value. Concerns about intrusion into one's life by purported kin and control of data were widespread, with many participants expressing concern about secondary uses of data that could harm users or their families. The use of direct-to-consumer genetic tests data for forensic genealogy elicited a particularly wide array of reactions, both spontaneously and in response to specific discussion prompts, mirroring the current public debate about law enforcement access to such data. The themes uncovered through our investigation warrant specific attention in the continued development of the science, policy, and practice of commercial direct-to-consumer genetic testing."
https://openalex.org/W3215943979,"Intermittency are a common and challenging problem in demand forecasting. We introduce a new, unified framework for building probabilistic forecasting models for intermittent demand time series, which incorporates and allows to generalize existing methods in several directions. Our framework is based on extensions of well-established model-based methods to discrete-time renewal processes, which can parsimoniously account for patterns such as aging, clustering and quasi-periodicity in demand arrivals. The connection to discrete-time renewal processes allows not only for a principled extension of Croston-type models, but additionally for a natural inclusion of neural network based models—by replacing exponential smoothing with a recurrent neural network. We also demonstrate that modeling continuous-time demand arrivals, i.e., with a temporal point process, is possible via a trivial extension of our framework. This leads to more flexible modeling in scenarios where data of individual purchase orders are directly available with granular timestamps. Complementing this theoretical advancement, we demonstrate the efficacy of our framework for forecasting practice via an extensive empirical study on standard intermittent demand data sets, in which we report predictive accuracy in a variety of scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W3216172748,"Mosquitoes are hematophagous insects that transmit parasites and pathogens with devastating effects on humans, particularly in subtropical regions. Different mosquito species display various behaviors, breeding sites, and geographic distribution; however, they can be difficult to distinguish in the field due to morphological similarities between species and damage caused during trapping and transportation. Vector control methods for controlling mosquito-borne disease epidemics require an understanding of which vector species are present in the area as well as the epidemiological patterns of disease transmission. Although molecular techniques can accurately distinguish between mosquito species, they are costly and laborious, making them unsuitable for extensive use in the field. Thus, alternative techniques are required. Geometric morphometrics (GM) is a rapid and inexpensive technique that can be used to analyze the size, shape, and shape variation of individuals based on a range of traits. Here, we used GM to analyze the wings of 1,040 female mosquitoes from 12 different species in Thailand. The right wing of each specimen was removed, imaged microscopically, and digitized using 17 landmarks. Wing shape variation among genera and species was analyzed using canonical variate analysis (CVA), while discriminant function analysis was used to cross-validate classification reliability based on Mahalanobis distances. Phenetic relationships were constructed to illustrate the discrimination patterns for genera and species. CVA of the morphological variation among Aedes, Anopheles, Armigeres, Culex, and Mansonia mosquito genera revealed five clusters. In particular, we demonstrated a high percentage of correctly-distinguished samples among Aedes (97.48%), Armigeres (96.15%), Culex (90.07%), and Mansonia (91.67%), but not Anopheles (64.54%). Together, these findings suggest that wing landmark-based GM analysis is an efficient method for identifying mosquito species, particularly among the Aedes, Armigeres, Culex, and Mansonia genera."
https://openalex.org/W3214992392,"This paper addresses the relationship between age and international research collaboration. The main research question is: do younger researchers collaborate more internationally than their senior colleagues? A common assumption is that younger generations are generally more internationally oriented than older generations. On the other hand, senior researchers may have larger international networks compared to younger colleagues. The study is based on data for 5,600 Norwegian researchers and their publication output during a three-year period (44,000 publications). Two indicators for international collaboration are used: The share of researchers involved in international collaboration measured by co-authorship and the average proportion of publications with international collaboration per researcher. These indicators reflect two different dimensions of international collaboration. Although the findings are not consistent across age cohorts and indicators of internationalization, the overall trend is that international collaboration tends to decline with increasing age. This holds both at aggregate levels and within groups of academic positions. However, the generational differences are not very large, and other variables such as the field of research explain more of the differences observed at an individual level."
https://openalex.org/W3215903674,"In birds, incubation temperature has received increased attention as an important source of phenotypic variability in offspring. A lower than optimal incubation temperature may negatively affect aspects of nestling physiology, such as body growth and energy metabolism. However, the long-term effects of sub-optimal incubation temperature on morphology and physiology are not well understood. In a previous study, we showed that zebra finches from eggs incubated at a low temperature (35.9°C) for 2/3 of the total incubation time suffered a lower post-fledging survival compared to individuals that had been incubated at higher temperatures (37.0 and 37.9°C). In the present study, we investigated whether these variations in incubation temperature could cause permanent long-lasting differences in body mass, body size, or basal metabolic rate. Furthermore, we tested whether the observed differences in survival between treatment groups would be reflected in the rate of physiological deterioration, assessed through oxidative damage and decreased metabolic rate with age (i.e. 'metabolic aging'). Incubation temperature did not significantly affect embryonic or nestling body growth and did not influence final adult body mass or body size. Nor was there any long-term effect on basal metabolic rate. Birds from eggs incubated at the lowest temperature experienced an accumulation of oxidative damage with age, although this was not accompanied by an accelerated rate of metabolic aging. The present results suggest that the low survival in these birds was possibly mediated by increased oxidative stress, but independent of body growth and the basal metabolic rate."
https://openalex.org/W3216452501,"The aims of this study were to examine the relationship between anthropometric variables, physical performance, and functional test with serve velocity regarding tennis players’ level and to design regression models that effectively predict serve velocity. A sample of sixteen male tennis players participated in this study (national level = 8, professional level = 7). Anthropometric measurements (body mass, height, body mass index and body segments) and physical test (hand strength, countermovement jump, jump on serve, and serve velocity) and functional test (medicine ball throw overhead and shot put) were performed. No differences in anthropometrics and physical test were found between national and professional levels. A significant positive correlation ( p &lt; 0.05, ranging for 0.603 to 0.932) was found between some anthropometrics measurements (body mass, height, arm, forearm, and leg segments), physical parameters (hand strength, countermovement jump) and functional test (medicine ball throw shot put and overhead) with serve velocity for all tennis players. Multiple regression analysis indicated that medicine ball throw shot put was the most important test to explain serve velocity ( r 2 = 0.869). The results showed how the combination of physical and anthropometric factors have an impact on serve velocity. In addition, a new functional fitness test (medicine ball throw shot put) is proposed as an alternative to traditional medicine ball throw overhead due to its high reproducibility (inter-trial reliability) and predictive validity values, as well as by multi-segmental coordination movement similar to tennis serve."

Yet, there is a paucity of research on the experiences of men living with infertility, especially in West Africa. This study explored men's aetiological knowledge, views and experiences of infertility in the West Coast region of The Gambia, West Africa.An explorative qualitative study was conducted among men living in the rural and urban communities of the West Coast region of The Gambia using in-depth interviews. Data collection and analysis were performed concurrently, and thematic data analysis was an iterative process carried out using NVivo 11 Analysis Software.Gambian men had generally poor knowledge of infertility, allocating it to God, spiritual powers and bodily (biomedical) factors. While societal norms meant that infertility was generally attributed to women, some men allocated male-factor infertility to poor sperm quality and impotence. Infertility threatened participants' sense of masculinity and resulted in psychosocial distress, including stigma, feelings of isolation, and low self-esteem.Normative gendered frameworks of infertility result in high levels of female responsibilisation in the Gambian context. Yet men diagnosed with infertility experience significant, often unrecognized, psychological and social distress. We therefore call for increased attention to male-factor infertility, and the promotion of male engagement with infertility-care and services, both of which are essential for successfully addressing infertility and it's psychosocial consequences in The Gambia."

We estimated costs and days in hospital for CRC cases, stratified by site (colon/rectal cancer) and disease stage, to inform detailed analyses of CRC-related healthcare.Incident CRC patients were identified using the Australian 45 and Up Study cohort linked with cancer registry records. We analysed linked hospital admission records, emergency department records, and reimbursement records for government-subsidised medical services and prescription medicines. Cases' health system costs (2020 Australian dollars) and hospital days were compared with those for cancer-free controls (matched by age, sex, geography, smoking) to estimate excess resources by phase of care, analysed by sociodemographic, health, and disease characteristics.1200 colon and 546 rectal cancer cases were diagnosed 2006-2013, and followed up to June 2016. Eighty-nine percent of cases had surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and excess costs were predominantly for hospitalisations. Initial phase (12 months post-diagnosis) mean excess health system costs were $50,434 for colon and $60,877 for rectal cancer cases, with means of 16 and 18.5 excess hospital days, respectively. The annual continuing mean excess costs were $6,779 (colon) and $8,336 (rectal), with a mean of 2 excess hospital days each. Resources utilised (costs and days) in these phases increased with more advanced disease, comorbidities, and younger age. Mean excess costs in the year before death were $74,952 (colon) and $67,733 (rectal), with means of 34 and 30 excess hospital days, respectively-resources utilised were similar across all characteristics, apart from lower costs for cases aged ≥75 at diagnosis.Health system costs and hospital utilisation for CRC care are greater for people with more advanced disease. These findings provide a benchmark, and will help inform future cost-effectiveness analyses of potential approaches to CRC screening and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3217610256,"There is a growing need to use green alternative larvicidal control for Aedes larvae compared to chemical insecticides. Substantial reliance on chemical insecticides caused insecticide resistance in mosquito populations. Thus, research for alternate chemical compounds from natural products is necessary to control Aedes larvae. This study explores the analysis of chemical compositions from Areca catechu nut as a potential larvicide for Aedes (Diptera: Culicidae).The Areca catechu nut collected from Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia was grounded into powder and used for Soxhlet extraction. The chemical analysis of the extracts and their structures were identified using the GCMS-QP2010 Ultra (Shimadzu) system. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Chemistry WebBook, Standard Reference Database 69 (https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/) and PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), the two databases used to retrieve the synonyms, molecular formula, molecular weight, and 2-dimensional (2D) structure of chemical compounds. Next, following WHO procedures for larval bioassays, the extracts were used to asses larvicidal activity against early 4th instar larvae of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus.The larvicidal activities were observed against early 4th stage larvae with different concentrations in the range from 200 mg/L to 1600 mg/L. The LC50 and LC95 of Aedes aegypti were 621 mg/L and 2264 mg/L respectively; whereas the LC50 and LC95 of Aedes albopictus were 636 mg/L and 2268 mg/L respectively. Mortality was not observed in the non-target organism test. The analysis using gas chromatography and mass spectrometer recovered several chemical compounds such as Arecaidine, Dodecanoic acid, Methyl tetradecanoate, Tetradecanoic acid <n->, and n-Hexadecanoic acid bioactive components. These chemical constituents were used as additive formulations in pesticides, pest control, insect repellent, and insecticidal agents.Our study showed significant outcomes from the extract of Areca catechu nut and it deserves further investigation in relation to chemical components and larvicidal actions between different species of Aedes mosquitoes. Even though all these findings are fundamental, it may have some interesting potentials to be developed as natural bio-larvicidal products."

It is likely treatment burden changes over time as circumstances change for patients and health services. However, there are a lack of population-level studies of treatment burden change and factors associated with this change over time. Furthermore, there are currently no practical screening tools for treatment burden in time-pressured clinical settings or at population level.This is a three-year follow-up of a cross-sectional survey of 723 people with multimorbidity (defined as three or more long-term conditions; LTCs) registered at GP practices in in Dorset, England. The survey will repeat collection of information on treatment burden (using the 10-item Multimorbidity Treatment Burden Questionnaire (MTBQ) and a novel single-item screening tool), sociodemographics, medications, LTCs, health literacy and financial resource, as at baseline. Descriptive statistics will be used to compare change in treatment burden since the baseline survey in 2019 and associations of treatment burden change will be assessed using regression methods. Diagnostic test accuracy metrics will be used to evaluate the single-item treatment burden screening tool using the MTBQ as the gold-standard. Routine primary care data (including demographics, medications, LTCs, and healthcare usage data) will be extracted from medical records for consenting participants. A forward-stepwise, likelihood-ratio logistic regression model building approach will be employed in order to assess the utility of routine data metrics in quantifying treatment burden in comparison to self-reported treatment burden using the MTBQ.To the authors' knowledge, this will be the first study investigating longitudinal aspects of treatment burden. Findings will improve understanding of the extent to which treatment burden changes over time for people with multimorbidity and factors contributing to this change, as well as allowing better identification of people at risk of high treatment burden."
https://openalex.org/W3214856224,"Fin-tech is an emerging field, inspiring revolutionary innovations in the financial field. It may initiate the evolutionary episode of the financial research, where volatility forecasting is a crucial topic in finance. For forecasting volatility, GARCH model is a prevailing model, however, further improvement of the GARCH model is still challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate how Fintech can play a part in volatility forecasting by employing a metaheuristic procedure called Genetic Programming. On the basis, we are able to develop a new volatility forecasting model, which can beat GARCH family models (including GARCH, IGARCH and TGARCH models) in a significant way. Since genetic programming is an evolutionary algorithm based on the principles of natural selection, this innovative work will be a breakthrough point in the financial area. The innovation of this paper demonstrates how GP technology can be applied in the financial field, attempting to explore the volatility forecasting area from the combination of new technology and finance, known as fintech. More importantly, when the formula of volatility forecasting is unknown as we introduce a new factor, namely, the liquidity factor, we unveil that how GP method can be helpful in determining the specific volatility forecasting model format. We thereby exhibit the liquidity effects on volatility forecasting filed from the fintech perspective."
https://openalex.org/W3215561016,"Quantifying pathogenic genes with q-PCR in complex samples to determine the pathogen loads is influenced by a wide range of factors, including choice of extraction method, standard curve, and the decision to use relative versus absolute quantification of the genes. The aim was to investigate the standardisation of q-PCR methods to determine enumerated E. coli gene ratios grown with the IDEXX Colilert® Quanti-Trays® using enteropathogenic E. coli as the model pathogen. q-PCR targeting the eaeA and gadAB genes was used to calculate the eaeA: gadAB ratios for clinical strains collected between [2005-2006 (n = 55)] and [2008-2009 (n = 19)] using the LinRegPCR software and Corbett Research Thermal cycler software. Both programs grouped the isolates into two distinct groups based on the gene ratios although the Corbett Research Thermal cycler software gave results one log higher than the LinRegPCR program. Although the eaeA: gadAB ratio range was determined using extracted E. coli DNA, the impact of free DNA and other bacteria present in the sample needed to be understood. Standard curve variations using serially diluted extracted E. coli DNA, serially diluted pure E. coli culture followed by DNA extraction from each dilution with or without other bacteria was tested using the eaeA q-PCR to quantify the genes. Comparison of the standard curves showed no significant difference between standard curves prepared with diluted DNA or with cells diluted before the DNA is extracted (P = 0.435). Significant differences were observed when background DNA was included in the diluent or Coliform cells added to the diluent to dilute cells before the DNA is extracted (P < 0.001). The ""carrier"" DNA and Coliform cells enhanced the DNA extraction results resulting in better PCR efficiency. This will have an influence on the quantification of gene ratios and pathogen load in samples containing lower numbers of E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W3214775278,"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic required careful management of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, to reduce ICU overload while facing limitations in resources. We implemented a standardized, physiology-based, ICU admission criteria and analyzed the mortality rate of patients refused from the ICU. Materials and methods In this retrospective observational study, COVID-19 patients proposed for ICU admission were consecutively analyzed; Do-Not-Resuscitate patients were excluded. Patients presenting an oxygen peripheral saturation (SpO 2 ) lower than 85% and/or dyspnea and/or mental confusion resulted eligible for ICU admission; patients not presenting these criteria remained in the ward with an intensive monitoring protocol. Primary outcome was both groups’ survival rate. Secondary outcome was a sub analysis correlating SpO 2 cutoff with ICU admission. Results From March 2020 to January 2021, 1623 patients were admitted to our Center; 208 DNR patients were excluded; 97 patients were evaluated. The ICU-admitted group (n = 63) mortality rate resulted 15.9% at 28 days and 27% at 40 days; the ICU-refused group (n = 34) mortality rate resulted 0% at both intervals (p &lt; 0.001). With a SpO 2 cut-off of 85%, a significant correlation was found (p = 0.009), but with a 92% a cut-off there was no correlation with ICU admission (p = 0.26). A similar correlation was also found with dyspnea (p = 0.0002). Conclusion In COVID-19 patients, standardized ICU admission criteria appeared to safely reduce ICU overload. In the absence of dyspnea and/or confusion, a SpO 2 cutoff up to 85% for ICU admission was not burdened by negative outcomes. In a pandemic context, the SpO 2 cutoff of 92%, as a threshold for ICU admission, needs critical re-evaluation."

This paper presents an application of goal programming as an aid for the optimizing marketing mix elements. It describes a project undertaken at one of the Universities in Poland considering the marketing mix includes all 7Ps elements at University. The constraints are first identified based on interviews with academic experts and survey. The analytic hierarchy process method is used to select the forms of promotional activities and Activity-Based Costing method are performed to determine the costs of the activities. Then, based on constraints, the multiple-criteria-programming model is built and applied to construct the marketing mix model at university, and it was solved using LP-Solve software AMPL. A comparison between the newly designed marketing mix and the existing one in terms of each of the criteria shows that the overall objective function could be greatly improved, optimized value can be obtained, and the model can be easily applied in any other high education sectors. The consequence of using the model is the optimal selection (with existing limitations) of promotional activities, taking into account their impact on the perception of the image of the university, significant from the perspective of students and impact on profitability, which is important from the perspective of the university management."
https://openalex.org/W3215132163,"Objective To determine the diagnostic value of virtual autopsy using post mortem-MRI (pm-MRI) at 3Tesla (T) compared to classic autopsy for the confirmation of fetal structural anomalies and secondly to establish which cases of termination of pregnancy would benefit mostly from a virtual autopsy. Methods In each of 32 fetuses included in the study, 32 anatomical structures were assessed, after termination of pregnancy in the second trimester. All cases were evaluated by prenatal ultrasonography, virtual autopsy and classic autopsy, and then divided into four groups: Cerebral Group, Cardiac Group, Renal Group and Other Group (miscellaneous group). The concordance of virtual autopsy with classic autopsy was calculated overall and for each group and each structural item. Also, the concordance between the two methods was assessed using a diagnostic error score (DgE_score), calculated as the absolute value of the difference between the number of malformations detected by classic autopsy per case (CA score) and the number of malformations detected at virtual autopsy per case (VA score). Results Overall virtual autopsy demonstrated a diagnostic sensitivity (Se) compared to classic autopsy of 67.33% [95% CI 57.28–76.33], with a specificity (Sp) of 98.37% [95% CI 97.33–99.09], a positive predictive value (PPV) of 81.93% [95% CI 71.95–89.52], a negative predictive value (NPV) of 96.49% [95% CI 95.11–97.57] achieving a diagnostic accuracy of 95.31% [95% CI 93.83–96.52]. Overall, no statistic significant correlation was demonstrated between DgE_score and the gestational age of the fetuses or between DgE_score and the weight of the fetuses, but a significant correlation was revealed between the virtual autopsy and classic autopsy score. The diagnostic utility of virtual autopsy using pm-MRI at 3 T as compared to classic autopsy for each category of termination of pregnancy revealed in the Cerebral Group a Se of 80.00% [95% CI 28.36–99.49], with a 96.30% [95% CI 81.03–99.91], a PPV of 80.00% [95% CI 35.75–96.64] a NPV of 96.30% [95% CI 81.81–99.34], with a diagnostic accuracy of 93.75% [95% CI 79.19% to 99.23] and a Cohen’s Kappa coefficient of 0.76 [95% CI 0.4494–1.0765]; in the Renal Group a Se and Sp of 100%, but in the Cardiac Group the Se was only 60.00% [95% CI 26.24–87.84], Sp 75% [95% CI 34.91–96.81], the PPV 75.00% [95% CI 44.92–91.69], NPV 60% [95% CI 38.87–77.96], with a diagnostic accuracy of 66.67% [95% CI 40.99–86.66] and a Cohen’s Kappa coefficient of 0.32 [95% CI -0.07–0.76]. Conclusions The results support virtual autopsy using pm-MRI at 3T as a reliable alternative to classic autopsy for the non-forensic analysis of second trimester fetuses. Analyzing the diagnostic utility of virtual autopsy using pm-MRI at 3 T for the confirmation of prenatal ultrasound findings in second trimester fetuses as compared to classic autopsy, the best results were obtained in the Cerebral and Renal Group. Reserved results were found in the Cardiac Group. Therefore, for the pregnancies with termination of pregnancy for cerebral or renal abnormalities, virtual autopsy by pm-MRI at 3T can be taken into consideration as a first-line investigation to confirm the prenatal findings."

We hypothesized that a score-based delirium detection using the Nudesc score identifies more patients compared to a traditional diagnosis of delirium by ICU physicians.In this retrospective study, all patients treated on a general medical ICU with 30 beds in a university hospital in 2019 were analyzed. Primary outcome was a documented physician diagnosis of delirium, or a delirium score ≥2 using the Nudesc.In 205/943 included patients (21.7%), delirium was diagnosed by ICU physicians compared to 438/943 (46.4%; ratio 2.1) by Nudesc≥2. Both assessments were independent predictors of ICU stay (p<0.01). The physician diagnosis however was no independent predictor of mortality (OR 0.98 (0.57-1.72); p = 0.989), in contrast to the score-based diagnosis (OR 2.31 (1.30-4.10); p = 0.004). Subgroup analysis showed that physicians underdiagnosed delirium in case of hypoactive delirium and delirium in patients with female gender and in patients with an age below 60 years.Delirium in patients with hypoactive delirium, female patients and those below 60 years was underdiagnosed by physicians. The score-based delirium diagnosis detected delirium more frequently and correlated with ICU mortality and stay."
https://openalex.org/W3215535153,"The spectrum of somatic genetic variation in colorectal adenomas caused by biallelic pathogenic germline variants in the MSH3 gene, was comprehensively analysed to characterise mutational signatures and identify potential driver genes and pathways of MSH3 -related tumourigenesis. Three patients from two families with MSH3 -associated polyposis were included. Whole exome sequencing of nine adenomas and matched normal tissue was performed. The amount of somatic variants in the MSH3-deficient adenomas and the pattern of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) was similar to sporadic adenomas, whereas the fraction of small insertions/deletions (indels) (21–42% of all small variants) was significantly higher. Interestingly, pathogenic somatic APC variants were found in all but one adenoma. The vast majority (12/13) of these were di-, tetra-, or penta-base pair (bp) deletions. The fraction of APC indels was significantly higher than that reported in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) (p &lt; 0.01) or in sporadic adenomas (p &lt; 0.0001). In MSH3-deficient adenomas, the occurrence of APC indels in a repetitive sequence context was significantly higher than in FAP patients (p &lt; 0.01). In addition, the MSH3-deficient adenomas harboured one to five (recurrent) somatic variants in 13 established or candidate driver genes for early colorectal carcinogenesis, including ACVR2A and ARID genes. Our data suggest that MSH3 -related colorectal carcinogenesis seems to follow the classical APC -driven pathway. In line with the specific function of MSH3 in the mismatch repair (MMR) system, we identified a characteristic APC mutational pattern in MSH3-deficient adenomas, and confirmed further driver genes for colorectal tumourigenesis."

Baseline descriptive statistics were used to examine the patient demographics and identify the timing of the postpartum visit. Univariate tests were used to identify significant predictors for admission. A multivariate model was developed based on backward selection from these significant factors to identify admission predictors.There were 381 visits identified, and the average age of the patients was 31.22 years (SD: 4.83), with median gravidity of 2 (IQR: 1-3). Most patients delivered via spontaneous vaginal delivery (53.0%). The median time of presentation to the ED was 5.0 days, with the following most common reasons: abdominal pain (21.5%), wound-related issues (12.6%), and urinary issues (9.7%). Delivery during the weekend (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.00-3.65, P = 0.05) was predictive of admission while Group B Streptococcus positive patients were less likely to be admitted (OR 0.22, CI 0.05-0.97, P<0.05).This was the first study in a busy community setting that examined ED visits over a short postpartum period.

https://openalex.org/W3216634258,"Traffic congestion in large urban networks may take different shapes and propagates non-uniformly variations from day to day. Given the fact that congestion on a road segment is spatially correlated to adjacent roads and propagates spatiotemporally with finite speed, it is essential to describe the main pockets of congestion in a city with a small number of clusters. For example, the perimeter control with macroscopic fundamental diagrams is one of the effective traffic management tools. Perimeter control adjusts the inflow to pre-specified regions of a city through signal timing on the border of a region in order to optimize the traffic condition within the region. The precision of macroscopic fundamental diagrams depends on the homogeneity of traffic condition on road segments of the region. Hence, previous studies have defined the boundaries of the region under perimeter control subjected to the regional homogeneity. In this study, a cost-effective method is proposed for the mentioned problem that simultaneously considers homogeneity, contiguity and compactness of clusters and has a shorter computational time. Since it is necessary to control the cost and complexity of perimeter control in terms of the number of traffic signals, sparse parts of the network could be potential candidates for boundaries. Therefore, a community detection method (Infomap) is initially adopted and then those clusters are improved by refining the communities in relation to roads with the highest heterogeneity. The proposed method is applied to Shenzhen, China and San Francisco, USA and the outcomes are compared to previous studies. The results of comparison reveal that the proposed method is as effective as the best previous methods in detecting homogenous communities, but it outperforms them in contiguity. It is worth noting that this is the first method that guarantees the connectedness of clusters, which is a prerequisite of perimeter control."

Development of rapid and easier diagnostic laboratory tests for HPeVs is desired. Methods Original inner primers, outer primers, and loop-primers were designed on the 5′ untranslated region of HPeV3. HPeV3 ribonucleic acids (RNAs), other viral RNAs, and clinical stool samples were used to confirm whether the designed primers would allow the detection of HPeV3 with the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) technique. Results Three combinations of primers were created and it was confirmed that all primer sets allowed the detection of HPeV3 RNAs. The primer sets had cross-reactivity with HPeV type 1 (HPeV1), but all sets showed negative results when applied to coxsackievirus, echovirus, enterovirus, norovirus, and adenovirus genomes. Four of six stool samples, obtained from newborn and infant patients with sepsis-like symptoms, showed positive results with our RT-LAMP technique. Conclusions This manuscript is the first description of an RT-LAMP for the diagnosis of HPeVs, allowing a faster, easier, and cheaper diagnosis. This technique is clinically useful for newborns and infants who have sepsis-like symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3215733642,"Sepsis, an important and preventable cause of death in the newborn, is associated with high out of pocket hospitalization costs for the parents/guardians. The government of Nepal’s Free Newborn Care (FNC) service that covers hospitalization costs has set a maximum limit of Nepalese rupees (NPR) 8000 i.e. USD 73.5, the basis of which is unclear. We aimed to estimate the costs of treatment in neonates and young infants fulfilling clinical criteria for sepsis, defined as clinical severe infection (CSI) to identify determinants of increased cost. This study assessed costs for treatment of 206 infants 3–59 days old, enrolled in a clinical trial, and admitted to the Kanti Children’s Hospital in Nepal through June 2017 to December 2018. Total costs were derived as the sum of direct costs for bed charges, investigations, and medicines and indirect costs calculated by using work time loss of parents. We estimated treatment costs for CSI, the proportion exceeding NPR 8000 and performed multivariable linear regression to identify determinants of high cost. Of the 206 infants, 138 (67%) were neonates (3–28 days). The median (IQR) direct costs for treatment of CSI in neonates and young infants (29–59 days) were USD 111.7 (69.8–155.5) and 65.17 (43.4–98.5) respectively. The direct costs exceeded NPR 8000 (USD 73.5) in 69% of neonates with CSI. Age &lt;29 days, moderate malnutrition, presence of any sign of critical illness and documented treatment failure were found to be important determinants of high costs for treatment of CSI. According to this study, the average treatment cost for a newborn with CSI in a public tertiary level hospital is substantial. The maximum limit offered for free newborn care in public hospitals needs to be revised for better acceptance and successful implementation of the FNC service to avert catastrophic health expenditures in developing countries like Nepal.

The architecture of the neural network optimal punch model included an input layer of 600 nodes-the values of absolute accelerations and angular velocities, four hidden ones, as well as a binary output layer (the best and not the best punch). To measure accelerations and angular velocities, inertial measuring devices were attached to the boxers' wrists. Highly qualified participated in the data set for the development of the optimal model. The best punches were chosen according to the criteria of strength and speed. The punch force was determined using a boxing pad with the function of measuring the punch force. In order to be able to compare punches, a unified parameter was developed, called the punch quality, which is equal to the product of the effective force and the punch speed. To study the effects of biofeedback, the boxing pads were equipped with five LEDs. The more LEDs were turned on, the more the punch corresponded to the optimal model. As a result of the study, an almost linear relationship was found between the quality of the punch of entry-level boxers and the optimal model. The use of feedback allowed for an increase in the quality of punches from 11 to 25%, which is on average twice as high as in the group where the feedback method was not used. Studies have shown that it is possible to develop an optimal punch model. According to the degree of compliance with this model, you can evaluate and train boxers in the technique."
https://openalex.org/W3216833137,"Whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) is an important pest of cotton causing direct damage as sap feeder and vector of Cotton leaf curl virus (CLCuV). Previous few studies suggest that female whiteflies are more efficient vector of begomovirusthan males, however the sex-biased transmission efficiency is still not clearly understood. Present studies with B. tabaci AsiaII-1 haplotype showed higher virus transmission efficiency of females compared to males. This variable begomovirus transmission efficiency has been related to previously identifiedkey factors associated with B. tabaci. The higher density of endosymbiont Arsenophonus and variable expression of some midgut proteins genes i.e. Cyclophilin, Knottin, Hsp40, Hsp70 may be possibly imparting higher vector competency to the females compared to males. The present studies suggest low abundance of Arsenophonus spp. as well as lower expressionof Cyclophilin genein males as compared to females. This is further supplemented by overexpression of Knottin, Hsp40, and Hsp70 genes in males compared to females and thus collectively all these factors might be playing a key role in low virus transmission efficiency of males. The relative density of Arsenophonus spp. and expression of midgut proteins genes in male and female whitefly first time enriches our understanding about sex-biased transmission efficiency of begomovirus."

The present study reports on the antipredator behavior of newts (Cynops pyrrhogaster) in response to snakes. Newts displayed a significant amount of tail-wagging and tail-undulation in response to a contact stimulus from the snake's tongue, which is a snake-specific predator stimulus, as compared to a control stimulus (behavioral scores: tongue, 1.05 ± 0.41; control, 0.15 ± 0.15). Newts that were kept in warm temperature conditions, 20°C (at which snakes are active in nature), performed tail displays more frequently than newts kept in low-temperature conditions, 4°C (at which snakes are inactive in nature). Our results suggest that the tail displays of C. pyrrhogaster could function as an antipredator defense; they direct a snake's attention to its tail to prevent the snake from attacking more vulnerable body parts. We also discussed the reason for inter-populational variation in the tendency of newts to perform tail displays."
https://openalex.org/W3217544824,"The present study evaluated the importance of auxiliary traits of a principal trait based on phenotypic information and previously known genetic structure using computational intelligence and machine learning to develop predictive tools for plant breeding. Data of an F2 population represented by 500 individuals, obtained from a cross between contrasting homozygous parents, were simulated. Phenotypic traits were simulated based on previously established means and heritability estimates (30%, 50%, and 80%); traits were distributed in a genome with 10 linkage groups, considering two alleles per marker. Four different scenarios were considered. For the principal trait, heritability was 50%, and 40 control loci were distributed in five linkage groups. Another phenotypic control trait with the same complexity as the principal trait but without any genetic relationship with it and without pleiotropy or a factorial link between the control loci for both traits was simulated. These traits shared a large number of control loci with the principal trait, but could be distinguished by the differential action of the environment on them, as reflected in heritability estimates (30%, 50%, and 80%). The coefficient of determination were considered to evaluate the proposed methodologies. Multiple regression, computational intelligence, and machine learning were used to predict the importance of the tested traits. Computational intelligence and machine learning were superior in extracting nonlinear information from model inputs and quantifying the relative contributions of phenotypic traits. The R2 values ranged from 44.0% - 83.0% and 79.0% - 94.0%, for computational intelligence and machine learning, respectively. In conclusion, the relative contributions of auxiliary traits in different scenarios in plant breeding programs can be efficiently predicted using computational intelligence and machine learning."

In addition, in order to understand the effect that multiple fractional laser treatments have on skin rejuvenation, several sites were treated sequentially with either 1, 2, 3, or 4 treatments (with 28 days between treatments) followed by the collection of 4 mm punch biopsies. RNA was extracted from the biopsies, analyzed using Affymetrix U219 chips and gene expression was compared between untreated and treated sites. We observed dramatic changes in gene expression as early as 1 day after fractional laser treatment with changes remaining elevated even after 1 month. Analysis of individual genes demonstrated significant and time related changes in inflammatory, epidermal, and dermal genes, with dermal genes linked to extracellular matrix formation changing at later time points following fractional laser treatment. When comparing the age-related changes in skin gene expression to those induced by fractional laser, it was observed that fractional laser treatment reverses many of the changes in the aging gene expression. Finally, multiple fractional laser treatments, which cover different regions of a treatment area, resulted in a sustained or increased dermal remodeling response, with many genes either differentially regulated or continuously upregulated, supporting previous observations that maximal skin rejuvenation requires multiple fractional laser treatments. In conclusion, fractional laser treatment of human skin activates a number of biological processes involved in wound healing and tissue regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3212801732,"Recent technological advances have facilitated the collection of large-scale administrative data and the online surveying of the Indian population. Building on these we propose a strategy for more robust, frequent and transparent projections of the Indian vote during the campaign. We execute a modified MrP model of Indian vote preferences that proposes innovations to each of its three core components: stratification frame, training data, and a learner. For the post-stratification frame we propose a novel Data Integration approach that allows the simultaneous estimation of counts from multiple complementary sources, such as census tables and auxiliary surveys. For the training data we assemble panels of respondents from two unorthodox online populations: Amazon Mechanical Turks workers and Facebook users. And as a modeling tool, we replace the Bayesian multilevel regression learner with Random Forests. Our 2019 pre-election forecasts for the two largest Lok Sahba coalitions were very close to actual outcomes: we predicted 41.8% for the NDA, against an observed value of 45.0% and 30.8% for the UPA against an observed vote share of just under 31.3%. Our uniform-swing seat projection outperforms other pollsters-we had the lowest absolute error of 89 seats (along with a poll from 'Jan Ki Baat'); the lowest error on the NDA-UPA lead (a mere 8 seats), and we are the only pollster that can capture real-time preference shifts due to salient campaign events."
https://openalex.org/W3215346692,"A novel real-time 2+1 three-dimensional(3D) measuring method based on bicolor grating video projection is proposed. Firstly, only two frames of bicolor gratings, in which the red channels are two sinusoidal fringes with a shifting phase of π/2 and the blue channels are the same background light equivalent to the DC component of the two sinusoidal fringes are encoded and arranged alternatively to synthesize into a repetitive bicolor grating video, While this video is projected onto the measured object, the real-time bicolor deformed pattern video can be recorded by using a color CMOS camera, and the bicolor deformed pattern sequence at different moments can be extracted by computer processing, so that the 2+1 algorithm can be used to accomplish real-time 3D measurement of moving object. Before measuring, we used the same method to design two sinusoidal fringes with a difference of π in their red channels, respectively, to calibrate the sensitivity ratio between the red and blue channels of the CMOS camera, which can effectively eliminate the chromaticity imbalance between R and B channels and reduce the color crosstalk. Experimental results and analysis confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. Because the proposed method needs a repetitive bicolor grating video synthesized with only two-frame bicolor gratings to be projected, the 3D measurement acquisition speed and real-time accuracy will be improved compared with the traditional 2+1 3D measuring method."
https://openalex.org/W3215510056,"The purpose of this cross-sectional survey study is to quantitatively examine the differences in patient trust towards physicians between four different clinical departments in a Chinese hospital. Using a validated modified Chinese version of the Wake Forest Physician Trust Scale, we measured patient trust in each department, and also collected data on patient demographics. A total of 436 patients or family members were surveyed in the departments of emergency medicine, pediatrics, cardiology, and orthopedic surgery. Significant differences were found between the departments, especially between pediatrics (trust score 43.23, range 11–50) and emergency medicine and cardiology (trust scores 45.29 and 45.79, respectively with range of 11–50). The average total score across all four departments was 44.72. There are indications that specifically comparing departments, such as patient demographics or department structure, could be helpful in tailoring patient care to improve physician-patient relationships."
https://openalex.org/W3215878106,"It is now a matter of scientific consensus that priming, a recency effect of activation in memory, has a significant impact on language users' choice of linguistic means. However, it has long remained unclear how priming effects coexist with the creative aspect of language use, and the importance of the latter has been somewhat downplayed. By introducing the results of two experiments, for English and Russian native speakers, this paper seeks to explain the mechanisms establishing balance of priming and language creativity. In study 1, I discuss the notion of collective language creativity that I understand as a product of two major factors interacting: cognitive priming effects and the unsolicited desire of the discourse participants to be linguistically creative, that is, to say what one wants to say using the words that have not yet been used. In study 2, I explore how priming and antipriming effects work together to produce collective language creativity. By means of cluster analysis and Bayesian network modelling, I show that patterns of repetition for both languages differ drastically depending on whether participants of the experiment had to communicate their messages being or not being able to see what others had written before them."
https://openalex.org/W3215964635,"Appropriate dietary adjustment in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is important, and nutritional guidelines recommend different dietary management depending on the CKD stage. However, there is no study, to our knowledge, of the characteristics of dietary intake according to CKD stages. We tried to assess the comparison of nutritional intake according to CKD stages. A cross-sectional study was conducted to reveal the characteristics of dietary intake among patients with CKD based on the Korean National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey between 2011 and 2014. Of 16,878 participants, we classified non-CKD (n = 14,952) and CKD (n = 1,926), which was stratified into five groups (I, II, IIIa, IIIb, and IV-V). We investigated the characteristics of dietary intake, such as energy, water, protein, fat, carbohydrate, sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus, according to stage of CKD. We also explored nutritional intake according to CKD stage among patients with early CKD (stage I and II) and advanced CKD (stage IIIa, IIIb, and IV-V). Intake of majority of nutrients and energy tended to be decreased as CKD progressed. In early CKD stage, intake of energy, water, protein, fat, carbohydrate, potassium, calcium and phosphorus seemed to be statistically significant decreased as CKD progressed. In advanced CKD stage, intake of potassium and calcium seemed to be decreased as CKD progressed, but the intake of energy was about to be lower limit. Appropriate dietary education and CKD recognition are needed to improve nutritional intake depending on the CKD stage."
https://openalex.org/W3216024550,"Little data exists regarding the association of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on outcomes in the setting of in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). We sought to assess the impact of COPD on mortality and neurologic outcomes in adults with IHCA.The study population included 593 consecutive hospitalized patients with IHCA undergoing ACLS-guided resuscitation at an academic tertiary medical center from 2012-2018. The primary and secondary outcomes of interest were survival to discharge and favorable neurological outcome (defined as a Glasgow Outcome Score of 4-5) respectively.Of the 593 patients studied, 162 (27.3%) had COPD while 431 (72.7%) did not. Patients with COPD were older, more often female, and had higher Charlson Comorbidity score. Location of cardiac arrest, initial rhythm, duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and rates of defibrillation and return of spontaneous circulation were similar in both groups. Patients with COPD had significantly lower rates of survival to discharge (10.5% vs 21.6%, p = 0.002) and favorable neurologic outcomes (7.4% vs 15.9%, p = 0.007). In multivariable analyses, COPD was independently associated with lower rates of survival to discharge [odds ratio (OR) 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30-0.98, p = 0.041].In this contemporary prospective registry of adults with IHCA, COPD was independently associated with significantly lower rates of survival to discharge."
https://openalex.org/W3216094845,"Environmental metabolomics has become a growing research field to understand biological and biochemical perturbations of organisms in response to various abiotic or biotic stresses. It focuses on the comprehensive and systematic analysis of a biologic system’s metabolome. This allows the recognition of biochemical pathways impacted by a stressor, and the identification of some metabolites as biomarkers of potential perturbations occurring in a body. In this work, we describe the development and optimization of a complete reliable methodology based on liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) for untargeted metabolomics studies within a fish model species, the three-spined stickleback ( Gasterosteus aculeatus ). We evaluated the differences and also the complementarities between four different matrices (brain, gills, liver and whole fish) to obtain metabolome information. To this end, we optimized and compared sample preparation and the analytical method, since the type and number of metabolites detected in any matrix are closely related to these latter. For the sample preparation, a solid-liquid extraction was performed on a low quantity of whole fish, liver, brain, or gills tissues using combinations of methanol/water/heptane. Based on the numbers of features observed in LC-HRMS and on the responses of analytical standards representative of different metabolites groups (amino acids, sugars…), we discuss the influence of the nature, volume, and ratio of extraction solvents, the sample weight, and the reconstitution solvent. Moreover, the analytical conditions (LC columns, pH and additive of mobile phases and ionization modes) were also optimized so as to ensure the maximum metabolome coverages. Thus, two complementary chromatographic procedures were combined in order to cover a broader range of metabolites: a reversed phase separation (RPLC) on a C18 column followed by detection with positive ionization mode (ESI+) and a hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) on a zwitterionic column followed by detection with negative ionization mode (ESI-). This work provides information on brain, gills, liver, vs the whole body contribution to the stickleback metabolome. These information would help to guide ecotoxicological and biomonitoring studies."
https://openalex.org/W3216217445,"Many mammals and some owls have parallel grooved structures associated with auditory structures that may be exploiting acoustic products generated by groove arrays. To test the hypothesis that morphological structures in the ear can manipulate acoustic information, we expose a series of similar-sized models with and without groove arrays to different sounds in identical conditions and compare their amplitude and frequency responses. We demonstrate how two different acoustic signals are uniquely influenced by the models. Depending on multiple factors (i.e., array characteristics, acoustic signal used, and distance from source) the presence of an array can increase the signal strength of select spectral components when compared to a model with no array. With few exceptions, the models with arrays increased the total amplitude of acoustic signals over that of the smooth model at all distances we tested up to 160 centimeters. We conclude that the ability to uniquely alter the signal based on an array's characteristics is evolutionarily beneficial and supports the concept that different species have different array configurations associated with their biological needs."
https://openalex.org/W3217776804,"High quality radiology reporting of chest X-ray images is of core importance for high-quality patient diagnosis and care. Automatically generated reports can assist radiologists by reducing their workload and even may prevent errors. Machine Learning (ML) models for this task take an X-ray image as input and output a sequence of words. In this work, we show that ML models for this task based on the popular encoder-decoder approach, like 'Show, Attend and Tell' (SA&T) have similar or worse performance than models that do not use the input image, called unconditioned baseline. An unconditioned model achieved diagnostic accuracy of 0.91 on the IU chest X-ray dataset, and significantly outperformed SA&T (0.877) and other popular ML models (p-value < 0.001). This unconditioned model also outperformed SA&T and similar ML methods on the BLEU-4 and METEOR metrics. Also, an unconditioned version of SA&T obtained by permuting the reports generated from images of the test set, achieved diagnostic accuracy of 0.862, comparable to that of SA&T (p-value ≥ 0.05)."
