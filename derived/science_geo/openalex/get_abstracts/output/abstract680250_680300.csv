https://openalex.org/W3184174289,"Although sex dimorphism is increasingly recognized as an important factor in pain, female-specific pain signaling is not well studied. Here we report that administration of IL-23 produces mechanical pain (mechanical allodynia) in female but not male mice, and chemotherapy-induced mechanical pain is selectively impaired in female mice lacking Il23 or Il23r. IL-23-induced pain is promoted by estrogen but suppressed by androgen, suggesting an involvement of sex hormones. IL-23 requires C-fiber nociceptors and TRPV1 to produce pain but does not directly activate nociceptor neurons. Notably, IL-23 requires IL-17A release from macrophages to evoke mechanical pain in females. Low-dose IL-17A directly activates nociceptors and induces mechanical pain only in females. Finally, deletion of estrogen receptor subunit α (ERα) in TRPV1+ nociceptors abolishes IL-23- and IL-17-induced pain in females. These findings demonstrate that the IL-23/IL-17A/TRPV1 axis regulates female-specific mechanical pain via neuro-immune interactions. Our study also reveals sex dimorphism at both immune and neuronal levels."

Data collected for each person include genome sequencing, longitudinal cognitive scores, and quantitative neuropathology. The utility of this resource is exemplified here by analyses of neurons derived from these lines, revealing significant associations between specific Aβ and tau species and the levels of plaque and tangle deposition in the brain and, more importantly, with the trajectory of cognitive decline. Proteins and networks are identified that are associated with AD phenotypes in iPSC neurons, and relevant associations are validated in brain. The data presented establish this iPSC collection as a resource for investigating person-specific processes in the brain that can aid in identifying and validating molecular pathways underlying AD."
https://openalex.org/W3196914758,"The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a significant burden on the mental health and wellbeing of frontline health and social care workers. The need to support frontline staff has been recognised. However, there is to date little research specifically on how best to support the mental health needs of frontline workers, and none on their own experiences and views about what might be most helpful.We set out to redress this research gap by qualitatively exploring UK frontline health and social care workers' own experiences and views of psychosocial support during the pandemic.Frontline health and social care workers were recruited purposively through social media and by snowball sampling via healthcare colleagues. Workers who volunteered to take part in the study were interviewed remotely following a semi-structured interview guide. Transcripts of the interviews were analysed by the research team following the principles of Reflexive Thematic Analysis.We conducted 25 interviews with frontline workers from a variety of professional groups working in health and social care settings across the UK. Themes derived from our analysis showed that workers' experiences and views about psychosocial support were complex. Peer support was many workers' first line of support but could also be experienced as a burden. Workers were ambivalent about support shown by organisations, media and the public. Whilst workers valued psychological support services, there were many disparities in provision and barriers to access.The results of this study show that frontline health and social care workers are likely to need a flexible system of support including peer, organisational and professional support. More research is needed to fully unpack the structural, systemic and individual barriers to accessing psychosocial support. Greater collaboration, consultation and co-production of support services and their evaluation is warranted."

IntroductionMyelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are bone marrow (BM) failure disorders derived from abnormal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that give rise to dysplastic myeloid cells and cause multilineage blood cytopenias (Gangat et al., 2016Gangat N. Patnaik M.M. Tefferi A. Myelodysplastic syndromes: Contemporary review and how we treat.Am. J. Hematol. 2016; 91: 76-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). MDS can transform to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which has a poor prognosis (Sperling et al., 2017Sperling A.S. Gibson C.J. Ebert B.L.

Germline heterozygous mutations in DDX41, a DEAD-box RNA helicase gene, cause inherited susceptibility to adult MDS and/or AML with a median age of disease onset of 69 years (Polprasert et al., 2015Polprasert C.

DDX41 mutation carriers also have an increased incidence of idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS), suggesting that germline DDX41 mutations predispose to BM defects prior to MDS/AML (Choi et al., 2021Choi E.J. Cho Y.U. Hur E.H. Jang S. Kim N. Park H.S. Lee J.H. Lee K.H. Kim S.H. Hwang S.H. et al.Unique ethnic features of DDX41 mutations in patients with idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance, myelodysplastic syndrome, or acute myeloid leukemia.Haematologica. 2021; (Published online February 25, 2021)https://doi.org/10.3324/haematol.2020.270553Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). MDS in individuals with DDX41 mutations is unique in that the BM is often hypocellular, whereas adult MDS is typically hypercellular (Choi et al., 2021Choi E.J. Cho Y.U. Hur E.H. Jang S. Kim N. Park H.S. Lee J.H. Lee K.H. Kim S.H. Hwang S.H. et al.Unique ethnic features of DDX41 mutations in patients with idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance, myelodysplastic syndrome, or acute myeloid leukemia.Haematologica. 2021; (Published online February 25, 2021)https://doi.org/10.3324/haematol.2020.270553Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar).Many functions have been ascribed to DDX41, and, thus, the role of these mutations in MDS pathogenesis remains undefined. In dendritic cells and macrophages, DDX41 responds to cytosolic viral ligands, such as dsDNA, and induces innate immune signaling through STING (Lee et al., 2015Lee K.G. Kim S.S. Kui L. Voon D.C.

DDX41 is also thought to function in splicing, RNA:DNA hybrid accumulation, and ribosomal RNA transcription (Polprasert et al., 2015Polprasert C. Schulze I. Sekeres M.A. Makishima H. Przychodzen B.

The most common germline mutations in individuals with DDX41 MDS are frameshift mutations at aspartic acid (D) 52 or D140, which likely result in an inactive protein (Cheah et al., 2017Cheah J.J.C. Hahn C.N. Hiwase D.K. Scott H.S. Brown A.L. Myeloid neoplasms with germline DDX41 mutation.Int. J. Hematol. 2017; 106: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The majority of these individuals also acquire a somatic mutation at arginine 525 to histidine (R525H) in their residual DDX41 allele (Polprasert et al., 2015Polprasert C. Schulze I.

Haematol. 2021; 192: 1006-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The mutation at R525 diminishes the ATPase function of the helicase domain, indicating that both DDX41 alleles encode inactive or hypomorphic proteins in the somatically acquired biallelic DDX41 mutant cells (Kadono et al., 2016Kadono M.

These observations suggest that decreased function of DDX41 promotes hematopoietic cell defects associated with the pathogenesis of MDS. Here we set out to determine the effect of DDX41 mutations on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to better understand their role in disease. We show that DDX41 is required for small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) processing and snoRNA-mediated ribosomal RNA pseudouridylation in HSPCs. We also report that biallelic DDX41 mutant HSPCs exhibit reduced protein synthesis and are a disease-modifying minor clone in the context of monoallelic DDX41 mutant BM. Our findings suggest that co-existence of monoallelic and biallelic DDX41 mutant cells contributes to hematopoietic defects in DDX41-mutated individuals.ResultsDDX41 function is critical for hematopoiesis and HSPC proliferation and viabilityTo recapitulate the DDX41 frameshift mutation at D140 that is present in the germline of the majority of individuals with inherited susceptibility to MDS, we generated a conditional knockout mouse where exons 7–9 of Ddx41 are floxed (Ddx41flox), resulting in a truncated non-expressed peptide (Figures 1A and 1B ). Because DDX41 individuals often acquire a second somatic mutation in DDX41 at R525H, we also generated a conditional Ddx41R525H knockin (KI) mouse by inserting a floxed wild-type cDNA cassette coding for exons 12–17 of Ddx41 into intron 11 of the endogenous gene and then creating a mutation in exon 15 to code for R525H (Figure 1B). After Cre expression, the wild-type Ddx41 cassette is excised, allowing expression of Ddx41R525H from the endogenous allele (Figure 1B). To model the genetics of individuals with DDX41, we crossed Ddx41R525H mice with Ddx41flox and Rosa26-CreERT2 mice, resulting in mice with combined loss-of-function (flox) and R525H (KI) mutations upon tamoxifen-inducible Cre activation (hereafter called KI/−). To confirm expression of the Ddx41 alleles, we harvested lineage-negative (Lin−) BM cells from Ddx41KI/+ or Ddx41KI/flox;Rosa26-CreERT2 mice and treated the cells with 4-OH-tamoxifen in vitro. We confirmed the expected Ddx41 cDNA sequence in each genotype and protein expression in Lin− BM cells (Figures 1C and 1D; Figure S1A). To determine the requirement of Ddx41 for hematopoietic function, we first assessed hematopoietic reconstitution in lethally irradiated recipient mice. BM cells isolated from wild-type (+/+), Ddx41flox (+/− or −/−), and Ddx41KI (KI/+ or KI/−) mice administered tamoxifen daily for 3 days were transplanted into lethally irradiated recipient mice (Figure 1E). All mice reconstituted with BM cells from biallelic mutant Ddx41−/− or Ddx41KI/− mice died within 20 days from BM failure (BMF) (Figure 1F). In contrast, mice reconstituted with BM cells from monoallelic mutant Ddx41+/− or Ddx41KI/+ mice survived for the duration of the experiment and were indistinguishable from Ddx41+/+ mice. Mice reconstituted with BM cells from biallelic mutant Ddx41−/− or Ddx41KI/− mice exhibited hypocellular BM, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and pancytopenia (Figures 1G and 1H). However, mice reconstituted with Ddx41+/+, Ddx41+/−, or Ddx41KI/+ BM cells had comparable BM and spleen pathology and did not exhibit significant changes in PB counts up to 12 weeks (Figure S1B). These findings indicate that Ddx41 is required for regeneration of hematopoiesis, whereas a single copy of Ddx41 is sufficient for maintaining hematopoiesis without evidence of hematologic disease for up to 12 weeks. We excluded defective HSPC homing to the BM as a reason for hematopoietic failure in mice transplanted with DDX41-deficient BM cells (Figure S1C). To determine the requirement of Ddx41 for hematopoiesis after engraftment of BM cells has been established, we transplanted recipients with BM cells from wild-type and monoallelic and biallelic Ddx41 mutant mice, allowed the BM to engraft for 4 weeks, and then treated mice with tamoxifen (Figure 1I). 10–18 weeks after tamoxifen treatment, a subset of Ddx41−/− or Ddx41KI/− mice became moribund because of pancytopenia (Figures 1J and 1K). These mice also exhibited hypocellular BM and extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen, suggestive of BMF (Figure S1D). The surviving Ddx41−/− or Ddx41KI/− mice had one unexcised Ddx41 allele, indicating strong selection for cells escaping excision of both Ddx41 alleles (Figure S1E).To investigate the reason for the rapid BMF following deletion of DDX41, we next assessed hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) function in vitro by isolating Lin− BM cells. Wild-type, Ddx41+/−, or Ddx41KI/+ HPCs formed equivalent numbers of colonies in methylcellulose (Figure 1L) and grew in liquid culture at similar rates (Figure 1M). In contrast, Ddx41−/− and Ddx41KI/− Lin− BM cells were incapable of forming colonies and failed to expand in liquid culture (Figures 1L and 1M). The impaired function and proliferation of Ddx41−/− and Ddx41KI/− HPCs were due to significant G1 cell cycle arrest (Figure 1N) and increased apoptosis (Figure 1O). To assess whether the requirement for Ddx41 extends to leukemic cells, we immortalized Lin− cells from wild-type and Ddx41 mutant mice by retroviral expression of the KMT2A/MLL1-AF9 fusion gene, which induces a Hox gene expression program commonly implicated in AML, referred to here as leukemic stem/progenitor cells (LSPCs ) (Figure S1F). Consistent with the requirement of Ddx41 in normal HSPCs, we found that Ddx41 is also required for LSPC proliferation and survival (Figures S1G–S1I). Upon loss of Ddx41 or expression of Ddx41R525H, LSPCs underwent significant cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Figures S1H and S1I). Cell viability observed 48 h after tamoxifen was comparable between wild-type and Ddx41 mutant LSPCs (Figure S1I), whereas at 72 h, the viability of Ddx41−/− and Ddx41KI/− LSPCs decreased significantly (Figure S1I). These findings suggest that the function of DDX41 is required for proliferating HSPCs. Ddx41+/− LSPCs were indistinguishable from wild-type LSPCs in these assays, indicating that a single copy of DDX41 is sufficient to maintain the function of these cells. To confirm these observations, we expressed wild-type or DDX41R525H in Ddx41−/− LSPCs (from Figure S1J). We found that Ddx41−/− LSPC growth was rescued by expression of wild-type DDX41 but not the R525H mutant (Figure S1K). Last, to evaluate the requirement of DDX41 in human AML, we expressed short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting DDX41 (shDDX41) in a human AML cell line (THP1) (Figure S1L). We found that THP1 cells expressing shDDX41 failed to proliferate and had increased apoptosis compared with non-targeting control shRNA-expressing cells (Figures S1M and S1N). These findings indicate that DDX41 expression and activity are required for the viability, proliferation, and function of normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells.Monoallelic mutations of DDX41 confer an HSPC competitive advantageTo determine the consequences of the monoallelic and biallelic Ddx41 mutations on HSPC function, we performed competitive BM transplants by engrafting equal numbers of CD45.2+ Ddx41flox (+/− or −/−) and Ddx41KI (KI/+ or KI/−);Rosa26-CreERT2 cells with CD45.1+ competitor BM cells into lethally irradiated CD45.1+ recipient mice (Figure 2A). Four weeks after engraftment, chimeric mice were administered tamoxifen to induce recombination of the floxed alleles and then examined for 16 weeks (Figure 2A). The chimerism of biallelic Ddx41 mutant (−/− and KI/−) peripheral blood (PB) cells diminished from ∼50% to 15% after 16 weeks (Figures 2B and 2C). In the BM, the chimerism of Ddx41−/− and Ddx41KI/− mononuclear cells (MNCs) and Lin−cKit+Sca1+ (LSK) HSPCs was reduced significantly at 16 weeks (Figure 2D). In addition, the proportions of LT-HSCs, HPC-1, HPC-2, and MPP populations were also reduced in chimeric mice reconstituted with Ddx41−/− and Ddx41KI/− BM cells compared with Ddx41+/+ chimeric mice (Figure 2E). These findings suggest that DDX41 expression and activity are required for HSPC function in vivo. In contrast, the chimerism of monoallelic Ddx41 mutant (+/− and KI/+) PB cells increased progressively from ∼50% to 70% after 16 weeks (Figure 2C). Moreover, the BM chimerism of Ddx41+/− and Ddx41KI/+ HSPCs (LSK, HPC-1, and MPP), and HSCs (LT-HSCs) was increased modestly at 16 weeks (Figures 2D and 2E). In a secondary BM transplant, the chimerism of Ddx41+/− and Ddx41KI/+ MNCs in the PB and BM and HSPCs (LSK) within the BM remained elevated compared with wild-type cells (Figures 2F and 2G). These data indicate that Ddx41 is required for HSPC function and that loss of a single allele of Ddx41 confers a competitive HSPC advantage.Figure 2DDX41 haploinsufficiency confers an HSPC competitive advantageShow full caption(A) Tamoxifen injection schedule of competitive BM transplants.(B) Representative flow cytometry plots of blood.(C) Percentage of CD45.2+ cells in the blood of competitive transplant recipients over 16 weeks (∗p < 0.05, n = 7 mice per group).(D) Percent CD45.2+ in BM mononuclear cells (MNCs) and LSK of competitive transplant recipient mice 16 weeks after tamoxifen (∗p < 0.01, n = 7 mice per group).(E) Percent CD45.2+ in BM LT-HSCs (LSK CD48−CD150+), HPC-1 (LSK CD48+CD150−), HPC-2 (LSK CD48+CD150+), and MPPs (LSK CD48−CD150−) of competitive transplant recipient mice 16 weeks after tamoxifen (∗p < 0.05).(F) Percentage of CD45.2+ cells in the blood of secondary transplant recipients over 16 weeks (∗p < 0.01, n = 3 mice per group).(G) Percent CD45.2+ in BM MNCs of secondary competitive transplant recipient mice 16 weeks after tamoxifen (∗p < 0.01).(H) Percent CD45.2+ in the LSK gate of secondary competitive transplant recipient mice 16 weeks after tamoxifen (∗p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Monoallelic mutations of DDX41 causes age-dependent hematopoietic defectsIndividuals with heterozygous germline DDX41 mutations typically develop disease in adulthood; therefore, we wanted to find out whether mice with monoallelic-Ddx41 mutant BM cells develop hematopoietic defects upon aging. BM cells isolated from wild-type, Ddx41+/f (+/−), and Ddx41KI/+ (KI/+) mice administered tamoxifen daily for 3 days were transplanted into lethally irradiated recipient mice (as in Figure 1L) and then examined for 15 months. Although there was no survival difference between the groups, characterization of the mice at termination of the experiment revealed hematopoietic defects in mice engrafted with Ddx41+/− BM cells. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a myeloid cell bias were observed in Ddx41+/− recipients compared with Ddx41+/+ recipients (Figures 3A and 3B ). The Ddx41+/− group also had reduced BM cellularity and enlarged spleens (Figures 3C and 3D). We did not observe a significant difference in the relative proportions of HSPCs or mature cells in the BM between each group (Figures 3E–3G). Mice engrafted with Ddx41+/− BM cells developed hypocellular BM with evidence of dysplastic neutrophils (Figure 3H). These mice also exhibited extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen associated with myeloid expansion compared with mice engrafted with wild-type or Ddx41KI/+ BM cells (Figure 3H). We did not observe evidence of leukemic blasts in mice engrafted with Ddx41+/− or Ddx41KI/+ BM cells (Figure 3H). These observations suggest that mice engrafted with Ddx41+/− BM cells upon aging exhibit impaired hematopoiesis with features resembling human ICUS and MDS but without evidence of overt AML. Interestingly, mice engrafted with Ddx41KI/+ BM cells did not have the same hematopoietic defects as mice engrafted with Ddx41+/− BM cells, suggesting that the R525H mutation is not functionally equivalent to the frameshift loss-of-function allele.Figure 3Monoallelic Ddx41 mutations causes age-dependent hematopoietic defectsShow full caption(A) Blood counts 15 months after transplantation (∗∗p < 0.01, ∗p < 0.05).(B) Proportion of myeloid and lymphoid MNCs in blood of transplant recipient mice.(C) Cell counts of 2 tibiae and 1 femur 15 months after transplantation (∗p < 0.05).(D) Spleen weight 15 months after transplantation (∗p < 0.05).(E) Number of LSK cells in the BM of mice 15 months after transplantation.(F) Number of HSPCs in the BM of mice 15 months after transplantation.(G) Percent of CD45.2+ mature BM cells 15 months after transplantation.(H) Histology of mice 15 months after transplantation.

BM cells isolated from wild-type (+/+) and Ddx41+/f (+/−) mice were transplanted into lethally irradiated recipient mice and, after 4 weeks, were administered tamoxifen (Figure S2A). A subset (6 of 16) of Ddx41+/− mice developed variable hematopoietic abnormalities in the first 150 days, and another group became moribund 1 year after transplantation (Figure S2B). Examination of all remaining mice 15 months after tamoxifen administration revealed that the Ddx41+/− group was anemic and thrombocytopenic and exhibited reduced BM cellularity, an enlarged spleen, and variable expansion of neutrophils compared with Ddx41+/+ mice (Figures S2C–S2E). The spleen showed an increased percentage of myeloid cells in Ddx41+/− mice compared with Ddx41+/+ mice (Figure S2F). Histological examination revealed dysplastic myeloid cells in the BM and fewer circulating white blood cells (Figure S2G). These studies indicate that monoallelic DDX41 loss-of-function mutations can contribute to age-dependent hematopoietic defects, leading to phenotypes that resemble human disease.DDX41 is required for snoRNA processing in HSPCsTo determine the molecular basis of the functional decline of DDX41 mutant HSPCs, RNA sequencing was performed on Ddx41+/+ and Ddx41−/− LSPCs (48 h after treatment with tamoxifen). We identified 638 differentially expressed genes between Ddx41+/+ and Ddx41−/− LSPCs (2.0-fold, p < 0.05; Table S1). We found that snoRNAs were overexpressed significantly in Ddx41−/− LSPCs (Figure 4A; Figure S3A). snoRNAs are short, non-polyadenylated, non-coding RNAs that guide small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes (snRNPs) to catalyze chemical modifications of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA) (Sloan et al., 2017Sloan K.E.

We assessed the expression of all 110 snoRNAs in the mouse genome and found that nearly all of them had increased expression in Ddx41−/− LSPCs compared with Ddx41+/+ LSPCs, with 33 of them being statistically significant (Figure 4B; Figure S3B). We also found enrichment of a Reactome snoRNA gene signature in Ddx41−/− LSPCs compared with Ddx41+/+ LSPCs (Figure 4C). We confirmed increased expression of Snora16a, Snora7a, and Snora70 by qRT-PCR in Lin− BM cells isolated from Ddx41−/− and Ddx41KI/− mice (Figure 4D; Figure S3C). A similar increase in snoRNA expression was observed in Ddx41−/− LSPCs and in human AML cells expressing shRNAs targeting DDX41 (Figures S3D and S3E). In eukaryotic cells, snoRNAs are encoded predominantly within introns of host genes. In most cases, snoRNAs are released from excised, debranched introns by exonucleolytic trimming and/or endonucleolytic cleavage of flanking intronic RNA (Kufel and Grzechnik, 2019Kufel J. Grzechnik P. Small Nucleolar RNAs Tell a Different Tale.Trends Genet. 2019; 35: 104-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar; Figure 4E). We compared the expression of each snoRNA and its host gene in Ddx41−/− and Ddx41+/+ HSPCs and found that expression of the affected snoRNAs in Ddx41−/− HSPCs was increased relative to the respective host genes, suggesting that defective snoRNA processing contributes to the increased abundance of snoRNAs in DDX41 mutant cells and is not simply due to increased expression of the respective host genes (Figure 4F).Figure 4DDX41 is required for snoRNA processingShow full caption(A) Differentially expressed genes in Ddx41−/− LSPCs (Ddx41f/f + TAM) compared with Ddx41f/f.(B) Venn diagram of upregulated genes in Ddx41−/− LSPCs and the 110 snoRNAs in the mouse genome.(C) Gene set enrichment analysis for SNORA/D genes in Ddx41−/− LSPCs versus Ddx41f/f.(D) Expression of snoRNAs in Lin− BM cells (∗p < 0.05, n = 3 per group from independent biological replicates).(E) Schematic of snoRNA processing from host gene introns by splicing and exonuclease digestion to form mature snoRNA.(F) Differential expression of snoRNAs compared with their host genes in Ddx41−/− and Ddx41+/+ LSPCs.(G) Schematic of HyperTRIBE analysis for protein-RNA interactions.

Properly understanding risk factors for hospitalization will help improve clinical management and facilitate targeted prevention messaging and forecasting and prioritization of clinical and public health resource needs.To identify risk factors for hospitalization using patient questionnaires and chart abstraction.We randomly selected 600 of 1,738 laboratory-confirmed Colorado COVID-19 cases with known hospitalization status and illness onset during March 9-31, 2020. In April 2020, we collected demographics, social history, and medications taken in the 30 days before illness onset via telephone questionnaire and collected underlying medical conditions in patient questionnaires and medical record abstraction.Overall, 364 patients participated; 128 were hospitalized and 236 were non-hospitalized.

https://openalex.org/W3198017887,"<h2>Summary</h2> The strychnine-sensitive pentameric glycine receptor (GlyR) mediates fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the mammalian nervous system. Only heteromeric GlyRs mediate synaptic transmission, as they contain the β subunit that permits clustering at the synapse through its interaction with scaffolding proteins. Here, we show that α2 and β subunits assemble with an unexpected 4:1 stoichiometry to produce GlyR with native electrophysiological properties. We determined structures in multiple functional states at 3.6–3.8 Å resolutions and show how 4:1 stoichiometry is consistent with the structural features of α2β GlyR. Furthermore, we show that one single β subunit in each GlyR gives rise to the characteristic electrophysiological properties of heteromeric GlyR, while more β subunits render GlyR non-conductive. A single β subunit ensures a univalent GlyR-scaffold linkage, which means the scaffold alone regulates the cluster properties."

Methods and study design A prospective cohort study was conducted in 87 COVID-19 confirmed cases who recovered and discharged from a medical school hospital in Thailand. At the follow-up visit on day 60 after onset of symptoms, patients underwent an evaluation by spirometry (FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, FEF25-75, and PEF), a six-minute-walk test (6MWT), and a chest radiograph. Results There were 35 men and 52 women, with a mean age of 39.6±11.8 years and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 23.8±4.3 kg/m 2 . Of all, 45 cases had mild symptoms; 35 had non-severe pneumonia, and 7 had severe pneumonia. Abnormality in spirometry was observed in 15 cases (17.2%), with 8% of restrictive defect and 9.2% of obstructive defect. Among the patients with an abnormal spirometry, the majority of the cases were in the severe pneumonia group (71.4%), compared with 15.6% in the non-severe pneumonia group, and 10.2% in the mild symptom group ( p = 0.001). The mean six-minute-walk distance (6MWD) in the mild symptom and non-severe pneumonia groups was 538±56.8 and 527.5±53.5 meters, respectively. Although the severe pneumonia group tended to have a shorter mean 6-min walking distance, but this was not statistically significant ( p = 0.118). Twelve patients (13.8%) had abnormal chest radiographs that showed residual fibrosis. This abnormality was more common in the severe pneumonia group (85.7%) and in others (7.5%) ( p &lt;0.001). Conclusions Abnormal spirometry was noted in 17.2% of COVID-19 survivors with both restrictive and obstructive defects. Severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients had higher prevalence rates of abnormal spirometry and residual fibrosis on the chest radiographs when compared to patients in the mild symptom and non-severe pneumonia groups."

Herein, we have examined the surface modification of urinary catheter by embedding with eco-friendly synthesized phytomolecules-capped silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) to prevent the invasion and colonization of uropathogens. The preliminary confirmation of AgNPs production in the reaction mixture was witnessed by the colour change and surface resonance plasmon (SRP) band at 410nm by UV–visible spectroscopy. The morphology, size, crystalline nature, and elemental composition of attained AgNPs were further confirmed by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The functional groups of AgNPs with stabilization/capped phytochemicals were detected by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Further, antibiofilm activity of synthesized AgNPs against biofilm producers such as Staphylococcus aureus , Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were determined by viability assays and micrographically. AgNPs coated and coating-free catheters performed to treat with bacterial pathogen to analyze the mat formation and disruption of biofilm formation. Synergistic effect of AgNPs with antibiotic reveals that it can enhance the activity of antibiotics, AgNPs coated catheter revealed that, it has potential antimicrobial activity and antibiofilm activity. In summary, C . carandas leaf extract mediated synthesized AgNPs will open a new avenue and a promising template to embed on urinary catheter to control clinical pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3198769357,"Introduction Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy (DCM) is a common and disabling condition, with a relatively modest research capacity. In order to accelerate knowledge discovery, the AO Spine RECODE-DCM project has recently established the top priorities for DCM research. Uptake of these priorities within the research community will require their effective dissemination, which can be supported by identifying key opinion leaders (KOLs). In this paper, we aim to identify KOLs using artificial intelligence. We produce and explore a DCM co-authorship network, to characterise researchers’ impact within the research field. Methods Through a bibliometric analysis of 1674 scientific papers in the DCM field, a co-authorship network was created. For each author, statistics about their connections to the co-authorship network (and so the nature of their collaboration) were generated. Using these connectedness statistics, a neural network was used to predict H-Index for each author (as a proxy for research impact). The neural network was retrospectively validated on an unseen author set. Results DCM research is regionally clustered, with strong collaboration across some international borders (e.g., North America) but not others (e.g., Western Europe). In retrospective validation, the neural network achieves a correlation coefficient of 0.86 (p&lt;0.0001) between the true and predicted H-Index of each author. Thus, author impact can be accurately predicted using only the nature of an author’s collaborations. Discussion Analysis of the neural network shows that the nature of collaboration strongly impacts an author’s research visibility, and therefore suitability as a KOL. This also suggests greater collaboration within the DCM field could help to improve both individual research visibility and global synergy."
https://openalex.org/W3197949962,"Due to COVID-19, many countries including Japan have implemented a suspension of economic activities for infection control. It has contributed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 but caused severe economic losses. Today, several promising vaccines have been developed and are already being distributed in some countries. Therefore, we evaluated various vaccine and intensive countermeasure strategies with constraint of economic loss using SEIR model to obtain knowledge of how to balance economy with infection control in Japan. Our main results were that the vaccination strategy that prioritized younger generation was better in terms of deaths when a linear relationship between lockdown intensity and acceptable economic loss was assumed. On the other hand, when a non-linearity relationship was introduced, implying that the strong lockdown with small economic loss was possible, the old first strategies were best in the settings of small basic reproduction number. These results indicated a high potential of remote work when prioritizing vaccination for the old generation. When focusing on only the old first strategies as the Japanese government has decided to do, the strategy vaccinating the young next to the old was superior to the others when a non-linear relationship was assumed due to sufficient reduction of contact with small economic loss."

Because the mechanism controlling sorafenib-resistance is not well understood, this study focused on the connection between tumor characteristics and the Nrf2 signaling pathway in a sorafenib-resistant HCC cell line.A sorafenib-resistant HCC cell line (Huh7) was developed by increasing the dose of sorafenib in the culture medium until the target concentration was reached. Cell morphology, migration/invasion rates, and expression of stemness-related and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes were compared between sorafenib-resistant Huh7 cells and parental Huh7 cells. Next, a small interfering RNA was used to knock down Nrf2 expression in sorafenib-resistant Huh7 cells, after which cell viability, stemness, migration, and ABC transporter gene expression were examined again.Proliferation, migration, and invasion rates of sorafenib-resistant Huh7 cells were significantly increased relative to the parental cells with or without sorafenib added to the medium. The expression levels of stemness markers and ABC transporter genes were up-regulated in sorafenib-resistant cells. After Nrf2 was knocked down in sorafenib-resistant cells, cell migration and invasion rates were reduced, and expression levels of stemness markers and ABC transporter genes were reduced.Nrf2 signaling promotes cancer stemness, migration, and expression of ABC transporter genes in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells."
https://openalex.org/W3197955098,"Sleep loss is reported to influence affective processing, causing changes in overall mood and altering emotion regulation. These aspects of affective processing are seldom investigated together, making it difficult to determine whether total sleep deprivation has a global effect on how affective stimuli and emotions are processed, or whether specific components of affective processing are affected selectively. Sixty healthy adults were recruited for an in-laboratory study and, after a monitored night of sleep and laboratory acclimation, randomly assigned to either a total sleep deprivation condition ( n = 40) or a rested control condition ( n = 20). Measurements of mood, vigilant attention to affective stimuli, affective working memory, affective categorization, and emotion regulation were taken for both groups. With one exception, measures of interest were administered twice: once at baseline and again 24 hours later, after the sleep deprived group had spent a night awake (working memory was assessed only after total sleep deprivation). Sleep deprived individuals experienced an overall reduction in positive affect with no significant change in negative affect. Despite the substantial decline in positive affect, there was no evidence that processing affectively valenced information was biased under total sleep deprivation. Sleep deprived subjects did not rate affective stimuli differently from rested subjects, nor did they show sleep deprivation-specific effects of affect type on vigilant attention, working memory, and categorization tasks. However, sleep deprived subjects showed less effective regulation of negative emotion. Overall, we found no evidence that total sleep deprivation biased the processing of affective stimuli in general. By contrast, total sleep deprivation appeared to reduce controlled processing required for emotion regulation."
https://openalex.org/W3196670832,"Structured protocols offer a transparent and systematic way to elicit and combine/aggregate, probabilistic predictions from multiple experts. These judgements can be aggregated behaviourally or mathematically to derive a final group prediction. Mathematical rules (e.g., weighted linear combinations of judgments) provide an objective approach to aggregation. The quality of this aggregation can be defined in terms of accuracy, calibration and informativeness. These measures can be used to compare different aggregation approaches and help decide on which aggregation produces the ""best"" final prediction. When experts' performance can be scored on similar questions ahead of time, these scores can be translated into performance-based weights, and a performance-based weighted aggregation can then be used. When this is not possible though, several other aggregation methods, informed by measurable proxies for good performance, can be formulated and compared. Here, we develop a suite of aggregation methods, informed by previous experience and the available literature. We differentially weight our experts' estimates by measures of reasoning, engagement, openness to changing their mind, informativeness, prior knowledge, and extremity, asymmetry or granularity of estimates. Next, we investigate the relative performance of these aggregation methods using three datasets. The main goal of this research is to explore how measures of knowledge and behaviour of individuals can be leveraged to produce a better performing combined group judgment. Although the accuracy, calibration, and informativeness of the majority of methods are very similar, a couple of the aggregation methods consistently distinguish themselves as among the best or worst. Moreover, the majority of methods outperform the usual benchmarks provided by the simple average or the median of estimates."

Scores were standardized according to chronological age and corrected age and differences between mean chronological and corrected scores were compared, along with the proportion of children whose scores could be classified as impaired.When scores were standardized according to chronological age instead of corrected age there was a large significant difference of 17.3 points on the mental scale (79.5 vs. 96.8, respectively) and 11.8 points on the motor scale (84.8 vs. 96.6, respectively) at 18 months. By seven years, the difference in IQ scores remained, although of a smaller magnitude at 1.9 points between mean chronological and corrected age scoring (97.2 vs. 99.1, respectively).Consistent with previous literature, outcome assessments for preterm infants consistently differed according to use of chronological or corrected age to standardized scores. Cognitive scores were impacted more severely than motor scores, and differences were more substantial in early childhood than later in childhood. For clinical purposes, correction for preterm birth is only likely to have an impact during early childhood, however assessments for research purposes should continue to correct into childhood to account for the persistent bias due to preterm birth."
https://openalex.org/W3198173470,"The elite Indian rice variety, Naveen is highly susceptible to major biotic and abiotic stresses such as blast, bacterial blight (BB), gall midge (GM) and drought which limit its productivity in rainfed areas. In the present study, a combined approach of marker-assisted forward (MAFB) and back cross (MABC) breeding was followed to introgress three major genes, viz., Pi9 for blast, Xa21 for bacterial blight (BB), and Gm8 for gall midge (GM) and three major QTLs, viz., qDTY1.1, qDTY2.2 and qDTY4.1 conferring increased yield under drought in the background of Naveen. At each stage of advancement, gene-based/linked markers were used for the foreground selection of biotic and abiotic stress tolerant genes/QTLs. Intensive phenotype-based selections were performed in the field for identification of lines with high level of resistance against blast, BB, GM and drought tolerance without yield penalty under non-stress situation. A set of 8 MAFB lines and 12 MABC lines with 3 to 6 genes/QTLs and possessing resistance/tolerance against biotic stresses and reproductive stage drought stress with better yield performance compared to Naveen were developed. Lines developed through combined MAFB and MABC performed better than lines developed only through MAFB. This study exemplifies the utility of the combined approach of marker-assisted forward and backcrosses breeding for targeted improvement of multiple biotic and abiotic stress resistance in the background of popular mega varieties."
https://openalex.org/W3198230876,"Finding optimal parameters for force fields used in molecular simulation is a challenging and time-consuming task, partly due to the difficulty of tuning multiple parameters at once. Automatic differentiation presents a general solution: run a simulation, obtain gradients of a loss function with respect to all the parameters, and use these to improve the force field. This approach takes advantage of the deep learning revolution whilst retaining the interpretability and efficiency of existing force fields. We demonstrate that this is possible by parameterising a simple coarse-grained force field for proteins, based on training simulations of up to 2,000 steps learning to keep the native structure stable. The learned potential matches chemical knowledge and PDB data, can fold and reproduce the dynamics of small proteins, and shows ability in protein design and model scoring applications. Problems in applying differentiable molecular simulation to all-atom models of proteins are discussed along with possible solutions and the variety of available loss functions.

https://openalex.org/W3196596186,"Imidacloprid is a neonicotinoid insecticide widely used in the production and cultivation of crops. In recent years, the extensive use of imidacloprid in agricultural production has resulted in large amounts of pesticide residues in agricultural products and the environment. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a rapid, accurate, sensitive and convenient method for detecting imidacloprid pesticide residues to ensure the safety of agricultural products and the environment. To clarify how to use the molecular imprinting method for the electrochemical rapid residue detection of imidacloprid. This paper selected reduced graphene oxide and gold nanoparticles as modifiers modified on screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE) chitosan as a functional monomer, and imidacloprid as template molecule to prepare molecularly imprinted polymer, and applied this sensor to the residue detection of imidacloprid. The results showed that the concentration of imidacloprid showed a good linear relationship with the peak response current, and the detection limit of imidacloprid was 0.5 μM, while the sensor had good repeatability and interference resistance. The recoveries of imidacloprid spiked on three samples, mango, cowpea and water, were in the range of 90–110% (relative standard deviation, RSD&lt;5%), which proved the practicality and feasibility of the assay established in this paper. The results of this paper can be used as a basis for the research on the detection of imidacloprid pesticide residues in food or environment."
https://openalex.org/W3196793974,"Obesity prevalence is increasing in many countries in the world, including Asia. Maternal obesity is highly associated with fetal and neonatal deaths. This study investigated whether maternal obesity is a risk factor of fetal death (measured in terms of miscarriage and stillbirth) and neonatal mortality in South and South-East Asian countries.This cross-sectional study pooled the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) from eight South and South-East Asian countries (2014-2018). Multivariate logistic regression was deployed to check the relationships between maternal obesity with fetal and neonatal deaths. Finally, multilevel logistic regression model was employed since the DHS data has a hierarchical structure.The pooled logistic regression model illustrated that maternal obesity is associated with higher odds of miscarriage (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.20-1.33) and stillbirths (aOR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.27-1.67) after adjustment of confounders. Children of obese mothers were at 1.18 (aOR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.08-1.28) times greater risk of dying during the early neonatal period than mothers with a healthy weight. However, whether maternal obesity is statistically a significant risk factor for the offspring's late neonatal deaths was not confirmed. The significant association between maternal obesity with miscarriage, stillbirth and early neonatal mortality was further confirmed by multilevel logistic regression results.Maternal obesity in South and South-East Asian countries is associated with a greater risk of fetal and early neonatal deaths. This finding has substantial public health implications. Strategies to prevent and reduce obesity should be developed before planning pregnancy to reduce the fetal and neonatal death burden. Obese women need to deliver at the institutional facility centre that can offer obstetrics and early neonatal care."
https://openalex.org/W3198047668,"In French Polynesia, the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected on March 10 th , 2020, in a resident returning from France. Between March 28 th and July 14 th , international air traffic was interrupted and local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was brought under control, with only 62 cases recorded. The main challenge for reopening the air border without requiring travelers to quarantine on arrival was to limit the risk of re-introducing SARS-CoV-2. Specific measures were implemented, including the obligation for all travelers to have a negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 carried out within 3 days before departure, and to perform another RT-PCR testing 4 days after arrival. Because of limitation in available medical staff, travelers were provided a kit allowing self-collection of oral and nasal swabs. In addition to increase our testing capacity, self-collected samples from up to 10 travelers were pooled before RNA extraction and RT-PCR testing. When a pool tested positive, RNA extraction and RT-PCR were performed on each individual sample. We report here the results of COVID-19 surveillance (COV-CHECK PORINETIA) conducted between July 15 th , 2020, and February 15 th , 2021, in travelers using self-collection and pooling approaches. We tested 5,982 pools comprising 59,490 individual samples, and detected 273 (0.46%) travelers positive for SARS-CoV-2. A mean difference of 1.17 Ct (CI 95% 0.93–1.41) was found between positive individual samples and pools (N = 50), probably related to the volume of samples used for RNA extraction (200 μL versus 50 μL, respectively). Retrospective testing of positive samples self-collected from October 20 th , 2020, using variants-specific amplification kit and spike gene sequencing, found at least 6 residents infected by the Alpha variant. Self-collection and pooling approaches allowed large-scale screening for SARS-CoV-2 using less human, material and financial resources. Moreover, this strategy allowed detecting the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in French Polynesia."
https://openalex.org/W3196614268,"Plant species distribution is constrained by both dynamic and static environmental variables. However, relative contribution of dynamic and static variables in determining species distributions is not clear and has far reaching implications for range change dynamics in a changing world. Prunus eburnea (Spach) Aitch. &amp; Hemsl. is an endemic and medicinal plant species of Iran. It has rendered itself as ecologically important for its functions and services and is currently in need of habitat conservation measures requiring investigation of future potential distribution range. We conducted sampling of 500 points that cover most of Iran plateau and recorded the P . eburnea presence and absence during the period 2015–2017. In this study, we evaluated impacts of using only climatic variables versus combined with topographic and edaphic variables on accuracy criteria and predictive ability of current and future habitat suitability of this species under climate change (CCSM4, RCP 2.6 in 2070) by generalized linear model and generalized boosted model. Models’ performances were evaluated using area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity and the true skill statistic. Then, we evaluated here, driving environmental variables determining the distribution of P . eburnea by using principal component analysis and partitioning methods. Our results indicated that prediction with high accuracy of the spatial distribution of P . eburnea requires both climate information, as dynamic primary factors, but also detailed information on soil and topography variables, as static factors. The results emphasized that environmental variable grouping influenced the modelling prediction ability strongly and the use of only climate variables would exaggerate the predicted distribution range under climate change. Results supported using both dynamic and static variables improved accuracy of the modeling and provided more realistic prediction of species distribution under influence of climate change."

Hence, this study was initiated to investigate a system of novel CRC biomarkers that could commonly be employed to the CRC patients and helpful to overcome the heterogenetic-specific barrier.Initially, CRC-related hub genes were extracted through PubMed based literature mining. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the extracted hub genes was constructed and analyzed to identify few more closely CRC-related hub genes (real hub genes). Later, a comprehensive bioinformatics approach was applied to uncover the diagnostic and prognostic role of the identified real hub genes in CRC patients of various clinicopathological features.Out of 210 collected hub genes, in total 6 genes (CXCL12, CXCL8, AGT, GNB1, GNG4, and CXCL1) were identified as the real hub genes. We further revealed that all the six real hub genes were significantly dysregulated in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) patients of various clinicopathological features including different races, cancer stages, genders, age groups, and body weights. Additionally, the dysregulation of real hub genes has shown different abnormal correlations with many other parameters including promoter methylation, overall survival (OS), genetic alterations and copy number variations (CNVs), and CD8+T immune cells level. Finally, we identified a potential miRNA and various chemotherapeutic drugs via miRNA, and real hub genes drug interaction network that could be used in the treatment of CRC by regulating the expression of real hub genes.In conclusion, we have identified six real hub genes as potential biomarkers of CRC patients that could help to overcome the heterogenetic-specific barrier across different clinicopathological features."

A portable respiratory monitor based on pneumotachography was used to sample the included patient’s physiological respiratory parameters. A questionnaire with information about present symptoms and background data was completed. COVID-19 diagnoses and hospital admissions were gathered from the electronic medical record system. The physiological respiratory parameters of patients with and without COVID-19 were then analyzed using descriptive statistical analysis and logistic regression. Results Between May 2020 and January 2021, 95 patients were included, and their physiological respiratory parameters analyzed. Of these patients, 53 had COVID-19. Using adjusted logistic regression, the odds of having COVID-19 increased with respiratory rate (95% CI 1.000–1.118), tidal volume (95% CI 0.996–0.999) and negative inspiratory pressure (95% CI 1.017–1.152). Patients admitted to hospital had higher respiratory rates (p&lt;0.001) and lower tidal volume (p = 0.010) compared to the patients who were not admitted. Using adjusted logistic regression, the odds of hospital admission increased with respiratory rate (95% CI 1.081–1.324), rapid shallow breathing index (95% CI 1.006–1.040) and dead space percentage of tidal volume (95% CI 1.027–1.159). Conclusion Patients taking smaller, faster breaths with less pressure had higher odds of having COVID-19 in this study. Smaller, faster breaths and higher dead space percentage also increased the odds of hospital admission. Physiological respiratory parameters could be a useful tool in detecting COVID-19 and predicting hospital admissions, although more research is needed."
https://openalex.org/W3152995722,"High titers of anti-NMDAR1 autoantibodies in brain cause anti-NMDAR1 encephalitis that displays psychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia and/or other psychiatric disorders in addition to neurological symptoms. Low titers of anti-NMDAR1 autoantibodies are reported in the blood of a subset of the general human population and psychiatric patients. Since ~0.1-0.2% of blood circulating antibodies cross the blood-brain barriers and antibodies can persist for months and years in human blood, it is important to investigate whether chronic presence of these blood circulating anti-NMDAR1 autoantibodies may impair human cognitive functions and contribute to the development of psychiatric symptoms. Here, we generated mice carrying low titers of anti-NMDAR1 autoantibodies in blood against a single antigenic epitope of mouse NMDAR1. Mice carrying the anti-NMDAR1 autoantibodies are healthy and display no differences in locomotion, sensorimotor gating, and contextual memory compared to controls. Chronic presence of the blood circulating anti-NMDAR1 autoantibodies, however, is sufficient to impair T-maze spontaneous alternation in the integrity of blood-brain barriers across all 3 independent mouse cohorts, indicating a robust cognitive deficit in spatial working memory and/or novelty detection. Our studies implicate that chronic presence of low titers of blood circulating anti-NMDAR1 autoantibodies may impair cognitive functions in both the general healthy human population and psychiatric patients."
https://openalex.org/W3196723300,"Mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a prevalent cystic fibrosis (CF) lung colonizer, producing an extracellular matrix (ECM) composed predominantly of the extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) alginate. The ECM limits antimicrobial penetration and, consequently, CF sufferers are prone to chronic mucoid P. aeruginosa lung infections. Interactions between cations with elevated concentrations in the CF lung and the anionic EPS, enhance the structural rigidity of the biofilm and exacerbates virulence. In this work, two large mucoid P. aeruginosa EPS models, based on β-D-mannuronate (M) and β-D-mannuronate-α-L-guluronate systems (M-G), and encompassing thermodynamically stable acetylation configurations-a structural motif unique to mucoid P. aeruginosa-were created. Using highly accurate first principles calculations, stable coordination environments adopted by the cations have been identified and thermodynamic stability quantified. These models show the weak cross-linking capability of Na+ and Mg2+ ions relative to Ca2+ ions and indicate a preference for cation binding within M-G blocks due to the smaller torsional rearrangements needed to reveal stable binding sites. The geometry of the chelation site influences the stability of the resulting complexes more than electrostatic interactions, and the results show nuanced chemical insight into previous experimental observations."

Established on the dynamic capability view, the researchers have analyzed the connections between IT capabilities and CE, in addition to the performance results of SMEs. The research has explored these novel relationships by utilizing partial least square-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) with a data sample of 447 SMEs of the manufacturing sector in Pakistan. The findings present that IT capabilities positively influence the market and financial performance of SMEs through the mediating role of CE dimensions. The study uniquely determines the mediating role of dimensional effects of corporate entrepreneurship between IT capabilities and performance outcomes of firms. Thus, the study would enable the management of SMEs to realize the potential of IT-related CE dimensions and their use to improve firms' performance."
https://openalex.org/W3197688432,"Official data on birth is important to monitor the specific targets of SDGs. About 2.7 million children under age five years do not have official birth registration document in India. Unavailability of birth registration document may deprive the children from access to government-aided essential services such as fixed years of formal education, healthcare, and legal protection. This study examines the effect of socioeconomic, demographic and health care factors on birth registration in India. We also examined the spatial pattern of completeness of birth registration that could be useful for district level intervention.We used data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), 2015-16. We carried out the descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis. Besides, we used multilevel binary logistic regression to identify significant covariates of birth registration at the individual, district, and state levels. We used GIS software to do spatial mapping of completeness of birth registration at district level.The birth registration level was lower than national average (80.21%) in the 254 districts. In Uttar Pradesh, 12 out of 71 districts recorded lower than 50% birth registration. Also, some districts from Arunachal Pradesh, J&K, and Rajasthan recorded lower than 50% birth registration. We also found a lower proportion of children are registered among children of birth order three and above (62.83%) and rural resident (76.62%). Children of mothers with no formal education, no media exposure, poorest wealth quintile, OBC and muslims religion have lower level of birth registration. Multilevel regression result showed 25 percent variation in birth registration lie between states while the remaining 75 percent variation lie within states. Moreover, children among illiterate mother (AOR = 0.57, CI [0.54, 0.61], p<0.001), Muslims households (AOR = 0.90, CI [0.87, 0.94], p<0.001), and poorest wealth quintile (AOR = 0.38, CI [0.36, 0.41], p<0.001) showed lower odds for child's birth registration.We strongly suggest linking the birth registration facilities with health institutions."
https://openalex.org/W3197920497,"Objectives This study assessed associations between recent transactional sex (TS) and potential determinants and variations in patterns across two geographic regions with high HIV burden compared to the rest of Uganda, among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW). Methods In 2015, a nationally representative cross-sectional household survey was conducted in Uganda. A stratified multi-stage cluster sample design produced nationally representative estimates and sub-national estimates for AGYW in two high HIV burden regions, DREAMS Central 1 (Bukomansimbi, Ssembabule, and Rakai districts) and DREAMS Central 2 (Mubende, Mityana, Gomba, and Mukono districts), and the rest of Uganda. To identify associations between recent TS (defined as sex in the past 12 months in exchange for material support or help) and risk factors, multivariable logistic regressions were conducted. Interaction terms assessed the associations between violence and recent TS across geographic regions. Results Nationally, 14.2% of sexually active AGYW engaged in recent TS. Region-specific significant associations emerged between recent TS and marriage, family wealth, friendship, orphanhood, and sexual debut. In DREAMS Central 1 and 2, AGYW who witnessed violence in the home or community, or experienced sexual, physical, or emotional violence had higher odds of recent TS than AGYW who did not experience that form of violence (adjusted odds ratio ranged between 2.10 (95% CI, 1.07, 4.13) and 8.25 (95% CI, 3.40, 20.06)). The magnitude of association between recent TS and types of violence varied by region. Conclusions Violence is strongly and consistently associated with recent TS, and patterns in prevalence and risk factors vary across regions in Uganda. Given the high risk of HIV association with recent TS, HIV epidemic control efforts may benefit from focus on comprehensive violence prevention and target persons who engage in TS. Comprehensive HIV prevention programming aimed at keeping AGYW HIV-negative should incorporate prevention of violence and TS as key components to facilitate HIV epidemic control in this vulnerable population."
https://openalex.org/W3154472244,"Tobacco smoking might be impacted by various influences, including psychological, socio-cultural, and economic factors. A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in Syrian Arab Republic from March to April 2019 using a web-based questionnaire. The survey aimed at assessing tobacco use (shisha and cigarettes) as well as examining the association between current tobacco use and various sociodemographic and war-related factors. The sample comprised 978 participants (251 males: 727 females) and had a mean age of 24.7 years (SD: 7.60). Most participants were single (n = 825, 84.4%), reside in Damascus and Rif-Dimashq (n = 579, 59.2%), and had a college/university education (n = 911, 93.1%). Concerning smoking, a total of 371 participants (37.9%) were identified to be current tobacco smokers, of whom 211, 84, 76 were exclusive shisha smokers, exclusive cigarette smokers, and dual smokers, respectively. The prevalence of cigarette smoking (exclusive and dual) among males and females was found to be 34.7%, and 10.0%, respectively. On the other hand, the prevalence of shisha smoking (exclusive and dual) among males and females was around 34.3% and 27.6%, respectively. Additionally, various factors have predicted a higher likelihood of cigarette smoking including male gender (AOR = 4.152; 95% CI: 2.842-6.064; p<0.001), and losing someone due to the war (AOR = 1.487; 95% CI: 1.028-2.151; p = 0.035), while unemployed individuals were found to have lower odds of being cigarette smokers (AOR = 0.634; 95% CI: 0.429-0.937; p = 0.022). Concerning shisha smoking, married (AOR = 0.622; 95% CI: 0.402-0.963; p = 0.033), and unemployed individuals (AOR = 0.679; 95% CI: 0.503-0.916; p = 0.011) were found to have lower odds of shisha smoking. Amid the tobacco epidemic in the region, rates of tobacco use in Syria are still worrying. The Syrian armed conflicts may possess a double-edged effect on smoking, and tobacco users who adopt smoking to cope with various stressors should be targeted with well-structured health education, along with appropriate psychological services."
https://openalex.org/W3197306924,"Objective To construct a prediction model for optimal tracheal tube depth in pediatric patients using machine learning. Methods Pediatric patients aged &lt;7 years who received post-operative ventilation after undergoing surgery between January 2015 and December 2018 were investigated in this retrospective study. The optimal location of the tracheal tube was defined as the median of the distance between the upper margin of the first thoracic(T1) vertebral body and the lower margin of the third thoracic(T3) vertebral body. We applied four machine learning models: random forest, elastic net, support vector machine, and artificial neural network and compared their prediction accuracy to three formula-based methods, which were based on age, height, and tracheal tube internal diameter(ID). Results For each method, the percentage with optimal tracheal tube depth predictions in the test set was calculated as follows: 79.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 73.5 to 83.6) for random forest, 77.4 (95% CI, 71.8 to 82.2; P = 0 . 719 ) for elastic net, 77.0 (95% CI, 71.4 to 81.8; P = 0 . 486 ) for support vector machine, 76.6 (95% CI, 71.0 to 81.5; P = 1 . 0 ) for artificial neural network, 66.9 (95% CI, 60.9 to 72.5; P &lt; 0 . 001 ) for the age-based formula, 58.5 (95% CI, 52.3 to 64.4; P&lt; 0.001) for the tube ID-based formula, and 44.4 (95% CI, 38.3 to 50.6; P &lt; 0 . 001 ) for the height-based formula. Conclusions In this study, the machine learning models predicted the optimal tracheal tube tip location for pediatric patients more accurately than the formula-based methods. Machine learning models using biometric variables may help clinicians make decisions regarding optimal tracheal tube depth in pediatric patients."
https://openalex.org/W3198275898,"Smooth-shelled blue mussels, Mytilus spp., have a worldwide antitropical distribution and are ecologically and economically important. Mussels of the Mytilus edulis species complex have been the focus of numerous taxonomic and biogeographical studies, in particular in the Northern hemisphere, but the taxonomic classification of mussels from South America remains unclear. The present study analysed 348 mussels from 20 sites in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and the Falkland Islands on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South America. We sequenced two mitochondrial locus, Cytochrome c Oxidase subunit I (625 bp) and 16S rDNA (443 bp), and one nuclear gene, ribosomal 18S rDNA (1770 bp). Mitochondrial and nuclear loci were analysed separately and in combination using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods to identify the combination of the most informative dataset and model. Species delimitation using five different models (GMYC single, bGMYC, PTP, bPTP and BPP) revealed that the Mytilus edulis complex in South America is represented by three species: native M. chilensis, M. edulis, and introduced Northern Hemisphere M. galloprovincialis. However, all models failed to delimit the putative species Mytilus platensis. In contrast, however, broad spatial scale genetic structure in South America using Geneland software to analyse COI sequence variation revealed a group of native mussels (putatively M. platensis) in central Argentina and the Falkland Islands. We discuss the scope of species delimitation methods and the use of nuclear and mitochondrial genetic data to the recognition of species within the Mytilus edulis complex at regional and global scales."
https://openalex.org/W3198698979,"In the 21st century, understanding how population migration impacts human health is critical. Namibia has high migration rates and HIV prevalence, but little is known about how these intersect. We examined the association between migration and HIV-related outcomes using data from the 2017 Namibia Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (NAMPHIA).The NAMPHIA survey selected a nationally representative sample of adults in 2017. All adults aged 15-64 years were invited to complete an interview and home-based HIV test. Recent infection (<130 days) was measured using HIV-1 LAg avidity combined with viral load (>1000 copies/mL) and antiretroviral analyte data. Awareness of HIV status and antiretroviral use were based on self-report and/or detectable antiretrovirals in blood. Viremia was defined as having a viral load ≥1000 copies/mL, including all participants in the denominator regardless of serostatus. We generated community viremia values as a weighted proportion at the EA level, excluding those classified as recently infected. Significant migrants were those who had lived outside their current region or away from home >one month in the past three years. Recent cross-community in-migrants were those who had moved to the community <two years ago. Separate analyses were done to compare significant migrants to non-migrants and recent cross-community in-migrants to those who in-migrated >two years ago to determine the association of migration and timing with recent infection or viral load suppression (VLS). All proportions are weighted. Of eligible adults, we had HIV results and migration data on 9,625 (83.9%) of 11,474 women and 7,291 (73.0%) of 9,990 men. Most respondents (62.5%) reported significant migration. Of cross-community in-migrants, 15.3% were recent. HIV prevalence was 12.6% and did not differ by migration status. Population VLS was 77.4%. Recent cross-community in-migration was associated with recent HIV infection (aOR: 4.01, 95% CI 0.99-16.22) after adjusting for community viremia. Significant migration (aOR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55-0.97) and recent cross-community in-migration (aOR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.35-0.92) were associated with lower VLS, primarily due to lack of awareness of HIV infection. The study was limited by lack of precise data on trajectory of migration.Despite a high population-level VLS, Namibia still has migrant populations that are not accessing effective treatment for HIV. Targeting migrants with effective prevention and testing programs in communities with viremia could enable further epidemic control."
https://openalex.org/W3196339301,"Great gerbil ( Rhombomys opimus Lichtenstein, 1823) is distributed in Central Asia and some parts of the Middle East. It is widely found in central and northeast parts of Iran with two distinct genetic lineages: R . o . sodalis in the northern slopes of the Elburz Mountains and R . o . sargadensis in the southern slopes. This large rodent acts as the main host of natural focal diseases. No study has surveyed the ecological niche of the lineages and how their distribution might be influenced by different climatic variables. To examine the distribution patterns of this murid rodent, we aimed to determine the habitat preferences and effects of environmental variables on the ecological niche. Using a species distribution approach for modeling of regional niche specialization, suitable habitats predicted for R . o . sodalis were mainly located in Golestan province in northern Iran, along the northern slope of Elburz, while R . o . sargadensis , showed great potential distribution along the southern slope of Elburz and around the Kavir Desert and the Lut Desert. Despite the widest potential distribution of R . o . sargadensis from northeast to northwest and through Central Iran, the geographic range of R . o . sodalis was smaller and mostly confined to Golestan province. The results support the presence of the two genetic lineages of Rhombomys in Iran and confirm that there is no significant niche overlap between the two subspecies. Furthermore, it provided several perspectives for future taxonomic studies and prevention hygiene programs for public health."
https://openalex.org/W3197466513,"Motor Imagery (MI) is a powerful tool to stimulate sensorimotor brain areas and is currently used in motor rehabilitation after a stroke. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether an illusion of movement induced by visuo-proprioceptive immersion (VPI) including tendon vibration (TV) and Virtual moving hand (VR) combined with MI tasks could be more efficient than VPI alone or MI alone on cortical excitability assessed using Electroencephalography (EEG).We recorded EEG signals in 20 healthy participants in 3 different conditions: MI tasks involving their non-dominant wrist (MI condition); VPI condition; and VPI with MI tasks (combined condition). Each condition lasted 3 minutes, and was repeated 3 times in randomized order. Our main judgment criterion was the Event-Related De-synchronization (ERD) threshold in sensori-motor areas in each condition in the brain motor area.The combined condition induced a greater change in the ERD percentage than the MI condition alone, but no significant difference was found between the combined and the VPI condition (p = 0.07) and between the VPI and MI condition (p = 0.20).This study demonstrated the interest of using a visuo-proprioceptive immersion with MI rather than MI alone in order to increase excitability in motor areas of the brain. Further studies could test this hypothesis among patients with stroke to provide new perspectives for motor rehabilitation in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3198302438,"Cosegmentation is a newly emerging computer vision technique used to segment an object from the background by processing multiple images at the same time. Traditional plant phenotyping analysis uses thresholding segmentation methods which result in high segmentation accuracy. Although there are proposed machine learning and deep learning algorithms for plant segmentation, predictions rely on the specific features being present in the training set. The need for a multi-featured dataset and analytics for cosegmentation becomes critical to better understand and predict plants' responses to the environment. High-throughput phenotyping produces an abundance of data that can be leveraged to improve segmentation accuracy and plant phenotyping. This paper introduces four datasets consisting of two plant species, Buckwheat and Sunflower, each split into control and drought conditions. Each dataset has three modalities (Fluorescence, Infrared, and Visible) with 7 to 14 temporal images that are collected in a high-throughput facility at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The four datasets (which will be collected under the CosegPP data repository in this paper) are evaluated using three cosegmentation algorithms: Markov random fields-based, Clustering-based, and Deep learning-based cosegmentation, and one commonly used segmentation approach in plant phenotyping. The integration of CosegPP with advanced cosegmentation methods will be the latest benchmark in comparing segmentation accuracy and finding areas of improvement for cosegmentation methodology."

Body weight, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), whole blood and plasma serotonin, tail bleeding time, blood cell count, plasma TGF-β1 and plasma natriuretic peptide concentrations were measured. Myocardium and mitral valves were characterized by histology. mRNA mitral expression of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors was measured in the anterior leaflet. Cardiac anatomy and function were assessed by echocardiography.Compared to C57BL/6J, FVB mice strains did not significantly differ regarding body weight increase, arterial blood pressure and heart rate. A progressive augmentation of plasma pro-ANP was observed in FVB mice. Nevertheless, no cardiac hypertrophy or left-ventricular fibrosis were observed. Accordingly, plasma TGF-β1 was not different among the three strains. Conversely, FVB mice demonstrated a high prevalence of fibromyxoid highly cellularized and enriched in glycosaminoglycans lesions, inducing major mitral leaflets thickening without increase in length. The increased thickness was correlated with urinary 5-HIAA and blood platelet count. Whole blood serotonin concentration was similar in the two strains but, in FVB, a reduction of plasma serotonin was observed together with an increase of the bleeding time. Finally, echocardiography identified left atrial and left ventricular remodeling associated with thickening of both mitral leaflets and mitral insufficient in 30% of FVB mice but no systolic protrusion of mitral leaflets towards the atrium.The FVB mouse strain is highly prone to spontaneous mitral myxomatous degeneration. A contribution of the peripheral serotonergic system is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W3197351699,"Chronic musculotendinous retraction, shortening and fibrosis after distal biceps tendon tears makes a primary reconstruction often difficult or even impossible. Interposition reconstruction with allograft provides a solution, however there is no consensus about appropriate intraoperative graft length adjustment. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to find a practical reference value for distal biceps tendon length adjustment. Three-dimensional surface models of healthy distal biceps tendons were created based on 85 MRI scans. The tendon length was measured from the myotendinous junction to the insertion on the bicipital tuberosity. Inter-epicondylar distance (IED) and radial head diameter (RHD) were measured on antero-posterior radiographs as a surrogate for patient size. Correlations between the tendon length and IED, RHD and patient’s height (PH) were calculated. Mean length of the external part of the distal biceps tendon was 69mm (female 64mm, male 71mm). The tendon length in mm was on average 1.1 times of the IED (mm), 3 times of the RHD (mm) and 0.4 times of PH (cm). Herewith, the tendon length could be predicted within a narrow range of +/-1cm in 84% by using IED, 82% by using RHD and 80% by using PH. Intra- and inter-reader reliabililty of IED and RHD was excellent (R 2 = 0.938–0.981). The distal biceps tendon length can be best predicted within 1cm with an accuracy of 82–84% using the IED and RHD with an excellent intra- and inter-reader reliability."

Lack of knowledge and fear of side effects are the most reported reasons for non-use of contraceptives amongst refugee adolescents. Peer counselling, the use of trained adolescents to offer contraceptive counselling to fellow peers, has showed effectiveness in increasing use of contraceptives in non-refugee adolescent resarch.To determine the effect of peer counselling on acceptance of modern contraceptives among female refugee adolescents in northern Uganda.A randomised controlled trial carried out in Palabek refugee settlement in northern Uganda, May to July 2019. Adolescents were included if they were sexually active or in any form of union, wanted to delay child bearing, and were not using any contraceptives. A total of 588 consenting adolescents were randomised to either peer counselling or routine counselling, the standard of care.Adolescents who received peer counselling were more likely to accept a contraceptive method compared to those who received routine counselling (PR: 1·24, 95% CI: 1·03 to 1·50, p = 0·023). Adolescents whose partners had attained up to tertiary education were more likely to accept a method than those whose partners had secondary or less education (PR: 1·45, 95% CI: 1·02 to 2·06, p = 0·037). In both groups, the most frequently accepted methods were the injectable and implant, with the commonest reasons for non-acceptance of contraception being fear of side effects and partner prohibition.Our data indicates that peer counselling has a positive effect on same day acceptance of modern contraceptives and should therefore be considered in future efforts to prevent adolescent pregnancies in refugee settings. Future peer counselling interventions should focus on how to effectively address adolescents' fear of side effects and partner prohibition, as these factors continue to impede decision making for contraceptive uptake."
https://openalex.org/W3196834656,"The study is aimed at the frosting problem of the air source heat pump in the low temperature and high humidity environment, which reduces the service life of the system. First, the frosting characteristics at the evaporator side of the air source heat pump system are analyzed. Then, a new defrost technology is proposed, and dimensional theory and neural network are combined to predict the transfer performance of the new system. Finally, an adaptive network control algorithm is proposed to predict the frosting amount. This algorithm optimizes the traditional neural network algorithm control process, and it is more flexible, objective, and reliable in the selection of the hidden layer, the acquisition of the optimal function, and the selection of the corresponding learning rate. Through model performance, regression analysis, and heat transfer characteristics simulation, the effectiveness of this method is further confirmed. It is found that, the new air source heat pump defrost system can provide auxiliary heat, effectively regulating the temperature and humidity. The mean square error is 0.019827, and the heat pump can operate efficiently under frosting conditions. The defrost system is easy to operate, and facilitates manufactures designing for different regions under different conditions. This research provides reference for energy conservation, emission reduction, and sustainable economic development."
https://openalex.org/W3197022233,"Furtive predation is an uncommon predation strategy within aphidophagous insects, as it can be constrained by several factors. So far, the few reported furtive predators are characterized by their small body-size, vermiform shape, and slow movement. They live within the aphid colonies, without triggering significant defensive acts, nor disrupting colony structure. In this study, we aim to determine how body-size may prevent adoption of a furtive predation strategy. For that, the American hoverfly, Eupeodes americanus (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Syrphidae) was selected as a model species, according to the great body-size increase experienced during the larval stage. We hypothesized that smaller instars will be furtive predators, whereas larger ones will be active-searching predators. After the inoculation close to a pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) colony, several behavioral parameters of the different larval instars were recorded. The elicited aphid colony disturbance was also evaluated and compared with that of the active-searching ladybird beetle, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), and of the furtive predator, Aphidoletes aphidimyza (Rondani) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae). Aphids showed significantly fewer defensive behaviors in the presence of E. americanus larvae than in the presence of the active-searching H. axyridis. Furthermore, our results clearly indicate that body-size increase was not a limit, since the three larval instars of the American hoverfly acted as furtive predators, just like the furtive A. aphidimyza. It is the first time a furtive predatory behavior has been recorded on such a large aphidophagous predator. The obtained results provide essential information about the biology of E. americanus, a potential biological control agent of aphids."

We study changes in the configurations of different technology fields via the power-law, small-world, preferential attachment, shrinking diameter, densification law, and gelling point hypotheses. Similar to the existing literature, we obtain mixed results. Based on network statistics, we argue that the sudden rise of large networks in six technology sectors can be understood as a phase transition in which small, isolated networks form one giant component. In two other technology sectors, such a transition occurred much later and much less dramatically. The examination of inventor networks over time reveals the increased complexity of all technology sectors, regardless of the individual characteristics of the network. Therefore, we introduce ideas associated with the technological diversification of inventors to complement our analysis, and we find evidence that inventors tend to diversify into new fields that are less mature. This behavior appears to be correlated with the compliance of some of the expected network rules and has implications for the emerging patterns among the different collaboration networks under consideration here."

In a study conducted in a large multicultural hospital emergency department, we examined how cultural factors relating to ethnicity interact to enhance care receivers' satisfaction and reduce their aggressive tendencies. Specifically, we explored how care receivers' cultural affiliation, individual cultural characteristics, and the cultural situational setting interact to increase care receivers' satisfaction and reduce their aggressive tendencies.Data were collected using survey responses from 214 care receivers. We use structural equation models and the bootstrap method to analyze the data.Care receivers' openness to diversity (an individual cultural characteristic) was positively related to their satisfaction that was associated with lower aggressive tendencies, only when they were affiliated with a cultural minority group and when the cultural situational setting included language accessibility.Our results demonstrate that cultural affiliation, individual cultural characteristics, and cultural situational setting can affect care receivers' satisfaction and aggressive tendencies in a multicultural emergency department context. In particular, high cultural openness of care receivers, and making information accessible in their native language, increased satisfaction and reduced aggressive tendencies among cultural minority care receivers in our study."

We model the prediction of links as a knowledge base completion problem, and find that sharing neighbors is highly predictive of the formation of new links. Importantly, We distinguish between grounded neighbors and neighbors in the embedding space, and find that the latter is more predictive of tie formation. The paper discusses the implications of this finding in explaining the high levels of elite endogamy in Santiago."
https://openalex.org/W3157104996,"Emotion regulation is an indispensable part of mental health and adaptive behavior. Research into emotion regulation processes has largely focused on the concurrent effects of volitional emotion regulation. However, there is scarce evidence considering post-regulatory effects with regard to neural mechanisms and emotional experiences. Therefore, we compared concurrent effects of cognitive emotion regulation with effects at different (immediate, short- and long-term) time intervals. In an fMRI study with N = 46 (N = 30 at re-exposure) young healthy adults, we compared neuronal responses to negative and neutral pictures while participants had to distance themselves from or to actively permit emotions in response to these pictures. We investigated the temporal dynamics of activation changes related to regulation in cognitive control brain networks as well as in the amygdala during stimulation (concurrent effects, timepoint 1) and post-stimulation (immediate, timepoint 2), as well as during re-exposure with the same pictures after short (10 minutes, timepoint 3) and long (1 week, timepoint 4) time intervals. At timepoint 1, negative pictures (versus neutral pictures) elicited a strong response in regions of affective processing, including the amygdala. Distancing (as compared to permit) led to a decrease of this response, and to an increase of activation in the right middle frontal and inferior parietal cortex. We observed an interaction effect of time (stimulation vs. post-stimulation) and regulation (distance vs. permit), indicating a partial reversal of regulation effects during the post-stimulation phase (timepoint 2). Similarly, after 10 minutes (timepoint 3) and after 1 week (timepoint 4), activation in the amygdala was higher during pictures that participants were previously instructed to distance from as compared to permit. These results show that the temporal dynamics are highly variable both within experimental trials and across brain regions. This can even take the form of paradoxical aftereffects at immediate and persistent effects at prolonged time scales."
https://openalex.org/W3196314395,"The Chicago River's north branch intersects multiple urban land uses, including residential, industrial, commercial, and recreational. The north branch also supports a diversity of birds exploiting a variety of resources and structures along the river as habitat. From three breeding seasons of point count surveys, I assess the breeding bird communities in four different sections, representing four different restoration or management styles. These four river sections are also very different with regards to the surrounding neighborhood demographics. These data serve as both a baseline for future studies to evaluate restoration projects along the Chicago River, and as a snapshot to compare bird diversity and community composition between these river sections given current conditions. Unsurprisingly, the section of the river with the most extensive and longest established restoration effort had the highest species richness (number of species) of native birds. In terms of aquatic and riparian birds, however, that section was comparable to river sections with much less management in measures of both species richness and species composition. I discuss ways that river restoration efforts can be sensitive to demographic context, to avoid contributing to eco-gentrification and displacement."
https://openalex.org/W3197358634,"The suicide rate for transgender people is among the highest of any group in the United States. Yet, we know little about disadvantages or resources available to transgender people to prevent suicide. The overall purpose of this study is to assess how marital status modifies the risk of suicide among transgender people. We analyzed data from the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey to predict marital status differences in both suicide ideation and suicide attempt in the past year. The analytic sample for suicide ideation included 17,117 transgender respondents (9,182 transwomen and 7,935 transmen), and the analytic sample for suicide attempt was limited to 8,058 transgender respondents (4,342 transwomen and 3,716 transmen) who reported suicide ideation in the last 12 months. Results from binary logistic regression models suggested that never married and previously married transmen and transwomen, regardless of their partnership status, generally had higher risk of both suicide ideation and attempt than their married transgender counterparts with only one exception: never married transwomen had lower risk of suicide ideation (but not attempt) than their married transwomen counterpart after sociodemographic characteristics were accounted for. These findings draw attention to the heterogeneity of the transgender population, highlighting marital status as a key social factor in stratifying the life experiences of transgender people."
https://openalex.org/W3197853356,"Changes in the acoustic signalling of animals occupying urban ecosystems is often associated with the masking effects of noise pollution, but the way in which they respond to noise pollution is not straightforward. An increasing number of studies indicate that responses can be case specific, and some species have been found to respond differently to high levels of natural versus anthropogenic noise, as well as different levels of the latter. While the perception of noise between species may vary with its source, amplitude and temporal features, some species may possess broader environmental tolerance to noise pollution, as they use higher frequency vocalizations that are less masked by low-frequency urban noise. In this study, we explored the song variation of two closely related leaf warblers, the Common Chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita and the Willow Warbler Phylloscopus trochilus , inhabiting urban green spaces and nonurban forests. The main goal of our study was to evaluate the impact of moderate levels of noise pollution on the songs of species which use higher frequency vocalizations and large frequency bandwidth. Previous studies found that the Common Chiffchaff modified their song in response to intense noise pollution, while no such data is available for the Willow Warbler. However, the majority of urban green spaces, which serve as wildlife hot spots in urban environments are usually polluted with moderate noise levels, which may not mask the acoustic signals of species that communicate with higher frequency. We analysed the spectral and temporal song parameters of both warblers and described the ambient noise present in males’ territories. Additionally, we looked at the social and seasonal aspects of bird song, since there is more than just noise in urban ecosystems which may affect acoustic communication. We found no evidence for noise-related bird song divergence in either species, however, we showed that social factors, time of day and season influence certain Common Chiffchaff and Willow Warbler song characteristics. Lack of noise-related bird song divergence may be due to the relatively low variation in its amplitude or other noise features present within the song frequency range of the studied species. Similar results have previously been shown for a few songbird species inhabiting urban ecosystems. Although in many cases such results remain in the shadow of the positive ones, they all contribute to a better understanding of animal communication in urban ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W3198125704,"A high-density crowd state is prone to cause large-scale crowd stampede accidents that seriously threaten the people's security and property. The key to preventing crowd congestion is to accurately predict the location and time of crowd events, particularly when there is a high density of people. In this paper, the entropy theory is used to characterize the state of a crowded system. The theoretical entropy Sr and the actual entropy S of the crowd system are obtained according to the area occupied by the different crowd state The maximum entropy value and the actual entropy value under different conditions of the system are compared to judge the state of crowded extent. The results show that the model is practical and effective. According to the situation of the crowd, different management and evacuation measures are considered to prevent the occurrence of crowd accidents."
https://openalex.org/W3198189088,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are at an extremely high risk of silent myocardial ischemia (SMI). However, there is a dearth of evidence on the worldwide prevalence of this very lethal and yet unrecognizable complication of CKD. The proposed systematic review and meta-analysis aims to estimate the global prevalence of SMI among CKD patients.This protocol was conceived according to the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (PRISMA-P) statement. The systematic review will involve all observational studies and clinical trials published until April 30, 2021, and reporting on the prevalence of SMI in CKD patients. Electronic sources including MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane database of systematic reviews will be perused for potentially eligible studies, restricted to only studies published in English or French. Two investigators will independently select studies and use a pre-pilot tested form to extract data. Further, they will independently perform a qualitative assessment of the risk of bias and overall quality of the selected studies, followed by a quantitative assessment using funnel plots and Egger's tests. The heterogeneity between studies will be assessed with the Cochrane's Q statistic, and the I2 statistic will measure the percentage of variation across studies that is due to their heterogeneity rather than chance; the I2 will decide if a meta-analysis can be conducted. In case it cannot be conducted, a descriptive analysis will be performed. Otherwise, study-specific estimates will be pooled using either a fixed-effects or a random-effects model, depending on the value of the I2 statistic. Subgroup and random effects meta-regression analyses will further investigate the potential sources of heterogeneity. Finally, sensitivity analyses will be performed to measure the impact of low-quality studies on the results of the meta-analysis, and power calculations will determine the probability that we will detect a true effect if it does exist.CRD42020211929.The intended systematic review and meta-analysis will fill the knowledge gap on the global prevalence of silent myocardial ischemia (SMI) in CKD patients. The eligible studies will be identified through a methodic literature search followed by a rigorous screening process; we will then use robust meta-analysis tools to pool the data and provide reliable estimates of the global prevalence of SMI in CKD patients. Two major limitations could be: the predominance of clinical trials that might limit the generalizability of the findings, given that some informative patients might have been sidelined by the strict inclusion criteria of these studies; the high probability of type 1 error originating from the important number of subgroup and sensitivity analyses."
https://openalex.org/W3198559278,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is manifested along with non-motor symptoms such as impairments in basic emotion regulation, recognition and expression. Yet, self-conscious emotion (SCEs) such as self-disgust, guilt and shame are under-investigated. Our previous research indicated that Parkinson patients have elevated levels of self-reported and induced self-disgust. However, the cause of that elevation-whether lower level biophysiological factors, or higher level cognitive factors, is unknown.To explore the former, we analysed Skin Conductance Response (SCR, measuring sympathetic activity) amplitude and high frequency Heart Rate Variability (HRV, measuring parasympathetic activity) across two emotion induction paradigms, one involving narrations of personal experiences of self-disgust, shame and guilt, and one targeting self-disgust selectively via images of the self. Both paradigms had a neutral condition.Photo paradigm elicited significant changes in physiological responses in patients relative to controls-higher percentages of HRV in the high frequency range but lower SCR amplitudes, with patients to present lower responses compared to controls. In the narration paradigm, only guilt condition elicited significant SCR differences between groups.Consequently, lower level biophysiological factors are unlikely to cause elevated self-disgust levels in Parkinson's disease, which by implication suggests that higher level cognitive factors may be responsible."
https://openalex.org/W3198804310,"Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is a transcriptional factor that can be activated by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The synthetic protease inhibitor nafamostat mesilate (NM) inhibits NF-κB activity and exerts antitumor actions in various types of cancer. In the present study, we hypothesized that NM might enhance the antitumor action of radiotherapy on gallbladder cancer (GBC) cells by inhibiting radiation-induced NF-κB activity. Thus, we investigated the correlation between radiotherapy and NF-κB activity in GBC cells. We assessed the in vitro effects of radiotherapy with or without NM on NF-κB activity, apoptosis of GBC cells (NOZ and OCUG-1), induction of apoptotic cascade, cell cycle progression, and viability of GBC cells using four treatment groups: 1) radiation (5 Gy) alone; 2) NM (80 μg/mL and 40 μg/mL, respectively) alone; 3) combination (radiation and NM); and 4) vehicle (control). The same experiments were performed in vivo using a xenograft GBC mouse model. In vitro, NM inhibited radiation-induced NF-κB activity. Combination treatment significantly attenuated cell viability and increased cell apoptosis and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest compared with those in the other groups for NOZ and OCUG-1 cells. Moreover, combination treatment upregulated the expression of apoptotic proteins compared with that after the other treatments. In vivo, NM improved the antitumor action of radiation and increased the population of Ki-67-positive cells. Overall, NM enhanced the antitumor action of radiotherapy on GBC cells by suppressing radiation-induced NF-κB activity. Thus, the combination of radiotherapy and NM may be useful for the treatment of locally advanced unresectable GBC."
