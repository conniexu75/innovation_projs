https://openalex.org/W2019403534,"One of the most common questions asked before starting a new population genetic study using microsatellite allele frequencies is “how many individuals do I need to sample from each population?” This question has previously been answered by addressing how many individuals are needed to detect all of the alleles present in a population (i.e. rarefaction based analyses). However, we argue that obtaining accurate allele frequencies and accurate estimates of diversity are much more important than detecting all of the alleles, given that very rare alleles (i.e. new mutations) are not very informative for assessing genetic diversity within a population or genetic structure among populations. Here we present a comparison of allele frequencies, expected heterozygosities and genetic distances between real and simulated populations by randomly subsampling 5–100 individuals from four empirical microsatellite genotype datasets (Formica lugubris, Sciurus vulgaris, Thalassarche melanophris, and Himantopus novaezelandia) to create 100 replicate datasets at each sample size. Despite differences in taxon (two birds, one mammal, one insect), population size, number of loci and polymorphism across loci, the degree of differences between simulated and empirical dataset allele frequencies, expected heterozygosities and pairwise FST values were almost identical among the four datasets at each sample size. Variability in allele frequency and expected heterozygosity among replicates decreased with increasing sample size, but these decreases were minimal above sample sizes of 25 to 30. Therefore, there appears to be little benefit in sampling more than 25 to 30 individuals per population for population genetic studies based on microsatellite allele frequencies."

Nucleotide microarrays are well established in plant research, but carbohydrate microarrays are much less established, and one reason for this is a lack of suitable glycans with which to populate arrays. Polysaccharide microarrays are relatively easy to produce because of the ease of immobilizing large polymers noncovalently onto a variety of microarray surfaces, but they lack analytical resolution because polysaccharides often contain multiple distinct carbohydrate substructures. Microarrays of defined oligosaccharides potentially overcome this problem but are harder to produce because oligosaccharides usually require coupling prior to immobilization. We have assembled a library of well characterized plant oligosaccharides produced either by partial hydrolysis from polysaccharides or by de novo chemical synthesis. Once coupled to protein, these neoglycoconjugates are versatile reagents that can be printed as microarrays onto a variety of slide types and membranes. We show that these microarrays are suitable for the high throughput characterization of the recognition capabilities of monoclonal antibodies, carbohydrate-binding modules, and other oligosaccharide-binding proteins of biological significance and also that they have potential for the characterization of carbohydrate-active enzymes.

Glycans are crucial for plant life and are used for storage, defense, and signaling and as structural cell wall components (1Bacic A. Harris A.J. Stone B.A. Preiss J. The Biochemistry of Plants.

Plant oligo- and polysaccharides are also important components of food and feed and have numerous industrial applications. Starch is the most common carbohydrate in the human diet, whereas plant cell walls provide bulk materials including timber, paper, and cloth, as well as fine chemicals, food ingredients, and biofuel feedstocks (1Bacic A.

The complexity and diversity of plant polysaccharides underpin their biological roles and many of their industrially important characteristics, but also produce challenges for research and optimal utilization. A detailed knowledge of the structures, functions, interactions, and occurrence of plant glycans is essential for understanding their complex contributions to plant life and to fully exploit their commercial potential. However, unlike proteins and nucleotides, complex carbohydrates are not readily amenable to sequencing or synthesis, and existing biochemical techniques for glycan analysis, although powerful, are usually low throughput (3Fry S.C.

The development of rapid genome sequencing methods and improvements in protein expression techniques enable the production of large numbers of carbohydrate-active enzymes and carbohydrate-binding proteins including carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs). 2The abbreviations used are: CBMcarbohydrate-binding moduleHTPhigh throughputAGParabinogalactan proteinRGIrhamnogalacturonan I.

The rate-limiting step in CBM, mAb, and enzyme production is often a lack of efficient methods for screening their specificities.

However, the representation of glycomes on these arrays is generally far less comprehensive than is the coverage of transcriptomes/genomes and proteomes by nucleotide and protein arrays, respectively. The primary reason for this is the lack of facile methods for the production of sets of homogeneous, sequence-defined plant oligosaccharide structures (27Feizi T. Fazio F. Chai W. Wong C.H.

In contrast, partially defined polysaccharides are relatively easy to obtain, and microarrays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) populated with such samples have shown potential for HTP screening (29Sørensen I.

However, most plant polysaccharides and especially those from plant cell walls are complex heteropolymers and, even if pure, will typically accommodate a range of smaller oligosaccharide substructures (or epitopes), and so, polysaccharide-based assays, whether they be microarrays or ELISAs, lack analytical resolution (30Klopffleisch K.

J. 2008; 25: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We have developed a new generation of glycan microarrays for plant research based on defined oligosaccharide structures produced either by isolation from polysaccharides or by de novo chemical synthesis. Once coupled to bovine serum albumin (BSA), these neoglycoprotein sets are highly versatile, and microarrays can be printed on a variety of slides and membranes. Most of the oligosaccharides we describe here are derived from, or based on, cell wall polysaccharides that are among the most complex in nature and present particular challenges for HTP analysis, but we have also included starch-related oligosaccharides and novel synthesized structures. Oligosaccharides were produced either by partial enzymatic or by chemical hydrolysis of source polysaccharides followed by fractionation and purification or were prepared by chemical synthesis. For detailed information on all oligosaccharide samples, see supplemental Table 1. Analysis was performed as described in Ref. 33Clausen M.H. Madsen R.

Novel rat monoclonal antibodies were obtained as follows. LM23 was derived subsequent to immunization with a complex pectic immunogen from apple fruits, and this antibody binds to xylosyl residue in a range of antigenic contexts including xylogalacturonan and xylan. LM24 and LM25 were derived subsequent to immunization with a neoglycoprotein generated from a mixture of XXLG and XLLG xyloglucan oligosaccharides (Megazyme, Bray, Ireland). LM12 was derived subsequently to immunization with a neoglycoprotein generated with oligosaccharide structure 16 (see Fig. 1). In all these cases, immunization and hybridoma isolation protocols were carried out as described (35Willats W.G. Marcus S.E. Knox J.P. Generation of monoclonal antibody specific to (1→5)-α-l-arabinan.Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 308: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). CBMs were produced as described (40Cicortas Gunnarsson L. Nordberg Karlsson E. Albrekt A.S. Andersson M. Holst O. Ohlin M. A carbohydrate binding module as a diversity-carrying scaffold.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 41von Schantz L. Gullfot F. Scheer S. Filonova L. Cicortas Gunnarsson L. Flint J.E. Daniel G. Nordberg-Karlsson E. Brumer H.

Oligosaccharides were conjugated to BSA essentially as described (42Roy R. Katzenellenbogen E. Jennings H.J. Improved procedures for the conjugation of oligosaccharides to protein by reductive amination.Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1984; 62: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, BSA was mixed with oligosaccharides and NaCNBH3 (Sigma-Aldrich) in a borate buffer at pH 8. The reaction was allowed to progress at ambient temperature for 96 h. Where necessary, conjugates were purified from reaction mixtures using a spin column with a 10-kDa cut off (Pall, Lund, Sweden). The conjugates were stored in the reaction buffer at 20 °C before use and were stable for at least 6 months whereby CN− from the reducing agent presumably acts as a preservative. Carbohydrate microarrays were printed using two types of microarrays robot, a pin-based MicroGrid II (Digilab/Genomic Solutions, Huntingdon, UK) and a piezoelectric Sprint (Arrayjet, Roslin, UK). For printing on the MicroGrid II, microarrays were printed using four split pins or four solid pins (Digilab), and oligosaccharides were diluted to a 2 mg/ml and a 0.04 mg/ml concentration in deionized water immediately before use and transferred to a 96-well microplate for printing. Microarrays were printed at 16 °C at 35% humidity with one deposit per spot. The same procedure was used to print onto nitrocellulose membrane with a pore size of 0.45 μm (Whatman, Maidstone, UK), FAST Slides (Whatman) nitrocellulose-coated glass slides (Schott, Mainz, Germany), and a range of other surface-modified glass slides (Schott). For printing on the Arrayjet Sprint, the Sprint microarrayer was equipped with a 12-sample high capacity JetSpyder sample pick-up device. Microarrays were printed at 19 °C at 55% humidity, using six drops per spots when printing on nitrocellulose membrane and two drops per spot when printing on all glass slide types. Samples were printed in 55.2% glycerol, 44% water, 0.8% Triton X-100, and the same slides and nitrocellulose as for the MicroGrid II were used. Arrays were blocked by incubation for 1 h in PBS (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.7 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5) containing 5% w/v low fat milk powder (MPBS) for nitrocellulose probing, 0.05% Tween 20 for FAST Slides, and Schott nitrocellulose-coated glass slides and 0.5 m borate buffer containing 50 mm ethanolamine, pH 8.5, for all other slide types. Arrays were probed for 2 h with antibodies diluted 1/10 in PBS containing 5% w/v low fat milk powder for nitrocellulose membrane or in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for all other slide types. After washing with PBS (all microarray types), nitrocellulose microarrays were incubated for 2 h in either anti-rat or anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma, Poole, UK) diluted 1/5000 in 5% MPBS. After further washing in PBS, microarrays were developed using a substrate containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium in alkaline phosphatase buffer (100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm diethanolamine, pH 9.5). All glass-based slides were incubated for 2 h in either anti-rat or anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, Life Technologies Europe BV Nærum, Denmark) and subsequently washed in PBS and then de-ionized water. Microarrays on nitrocellulose membrane were scanned using a flatbed scanner (Cannon 8800, Søborg, Denmark) and converted to 16-bit grayscale TIFFs. Slides were scanned using a slide scanner (GenePix 4100, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The output from all scanning was analyzed using microarray analysis software (ImaGene 6.0, BioDiscovery, El Segundo, CA). Output from the analysis was further processed as necessary using Excel (Microsoft Denmark, Hellerup, Denmark) and presented as heat maps in which color intensity is correlated to mean spot signals. The array was blocked by incubation for 1 h in PBS (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.7 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5) containing 5% w/v BSA powder. After blocking, the array was washed three times for 5 min with 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. Following the washes, the array was probed with 1 mg/ml rabbit muscle phosphorylase a (P1261, Sigma) and 50 kBq of [14C]glucose 1-phosphate (GE Healthcare) for 2 h at 25 °C under continuous shaking (25 rpm). After incubation, the array was washed with PBS for 15 min. This was followed by a two washes with 2× PBS with 0.05% v/v Tween 20 for each 5 min. After this, a sample from the washing buffer was taken, and the radioactivity was analyzed. If radioactivity was reduced to base-line levels, the membrane was left drying and subsequently analyzed on a PhosphorImager system (445 SI, GE Healthcare). The cell wall imaging of xyloglucan mAb binding to tobacco stem pith parenchyma cell walls pretreated with pectate lyase was performed as described (38Marcus S.E. Verhertbruggen Y. Hervé C. Ordaz-Ortiz J.J. Farkas V. Pedersen H.L. Willats W.G. Knox J.P. Pectic homogalacturonan masks abundant sets of xyloglucan epitopes in plant cell walls.BMC Plant Biol. 2008; 8: 60Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). A set of oligosaccharides was assembled either by the enzymatic cleavage of polysaccharides followed by purification of constituent oligosaccharides or by chemical synthesis (Fig. 1, upper panel). Each structure shown in Fig. 1, upper panel has been assigned a code number (bolded to distinguish them from reference numbers), which is consistent throughout the text. Some of the oligosaccharides have been previously described, whereas four chemically synthesized galactosyl oligosaccharides were newly produced (structures 19, 20, 21, and 22). Details of all oligosaccharides are provided in supplemental Table 1. The purities of the oligosaccharides were determined by a variety of methods that have been described previously and referenced in supplemental Table 1. The purity of oligosaccharides produced from polysaccharides was generally at least 90%, and for chemically synthesized oligosaccharides, it was ∼99%. Oligosaccharides were coupled to BSA by reductive amination with sodium cyanoborohydride, which produced a ring-opened sugar residue between the oligosaccharide and the BSA (Fig. 1, lower panel). MALDI-TOF MS analysis of 20 selected neoglycoproteins indicated that on average 8.4 oligosaccharides were attached to each BSA molecule (supplemental Table 2). Several types of substrate surface were tested including a range of surface-treated glass slides (Fig. 2, A–C), glass slides coated with nitrocellulose (Fig. 2, D and E), and nitrocellulose membrane (Fig. 2, F–H). Two types of spotting robot were used, one piezoelectric (Arrayjet Sprint, Fig. 2, A–F) and one pin-based (MicroGrid II, Fig. 2, G and H). The test prints shown were made using BSA conjugated with (1→4)-β-d-mannohexaose and (1→5)-α-l-arabinopentaose printed in sextuplet and at 10 concentrations from 2 mg/ml to 7.6 ng/ml (Fig. 2, A–H). The arrays were probed with the anti-mannan or anti-arabinan mAbs LM21 and LM6, respectively. The oligosaccharides were successfully presented for recognition on all the surfaces used, but there were differences in detection limits and spot morphologies. Of the glass slides, the nitrocellulose-coated Nexterion E slide (Fig. 2D) and the FAST Slide (Fig. 2E) yielded the most sensitive detection (2 μg/ml for (1→4)-β-d-mannohexaose), and the least sensitive detection was obtained using the Nexterion P slide (125 μg/ml for (1→4)-β-d-mannohexaose) (Fig. 2C). Although similar in detection limits, arrays produced on the FAST Slide (Fig. 2E) were superior to those produced on the Nexterion E slide because they had a more consistent spot size across the concentration range, and this is an important consideration when quantifying spot signals. Nitrocellulose membrane was also a suitable substrate for microarray production using both the pin-based and the piezoelectric printers. With the piezoelectric Arrayjet printer, the detection limit on nitrocellulose was 122.1 ng/ml (Fig. 2F), and using the pin-based printer, the detection limit was 2 μg/ml for split pins (Fig. 2G) and 0.5 μg/ml for solid pins (Fig. 2H). These data demonstrated that the neoglycoprotein oligosaccharides are a versatile resource for the manufacture of microarrays on diverse surfaces. The reproducibility of microarrays produced on the piezoelectric Arrayjet robot was tested by producing 12 separate copies of arrays both on nitrocellulose membrane (Fig. 2I) and on slides (Fig. 2J), probing with selected antibodies, and then quantifying the spot signals from these replicate experiments (Fig. 2, I and J). For both nitrocellulose and slides, six arrays were probed with the anti-mannan mAbs LM21, six were probed with the anti-arabinan mAb LM6, and mean spot signals from three arrays were compared with the corresponding three replicate arrays. The data sets were plotted against each other, and r2 values were calculated (Fig. 2, I and J). In all cases, there was a low level of variability in the arrays, with r2 values of greater than 0.9 in all cases. Similarly high levels of reproducibility have been previously reported for arrays produced using the pin-based MicroGrid robot (32Moller I. Marcus S.E. Haeger A. Verhertbruggen Y. Verhoef R. Schols H. Ulvskov P. Mikkelsen J.D. Knox J.P. Willats W.

Most of the applications envisaged for oligosaccharide microarrays involve the interrogation of arrayed samples by a number of different glycan-binding proteins, ligands, or enzymes, which must be kept separate during probing. To achieve this, we designed our array production to be compatible with multipad slides that fit into a probing apparatus that forms a seal around each pad. An example of a typical array setup used is shown in supplemental Fig. 1A, where each of the 16 pads on each slide accommodates at least 324 spots in an area 6 × 6 mm, and each oligosaccharide is usually represented by four spots (two replicates at two different concentrations). As shown in supplemental Fig. 1B, the probing apparatus accommodates four such slides so that in a sing"

However, little is known about the functions of BACE1. BACE1-deficient mice exhibit mild but complex neurological phenotypes suggesting therapeutic BACE1 inhibition may not be completely free of mechanism-based side effects. Recently, we have reported that BACE1 null mice have axon guidance defects in olfactory sensory neuron projections to glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Here, we show that BACE1 deficiency also causes an axon guidance defect in the hippocampus, a shortened and disorganized infrapyramidal bundle of the mossy fiber projection from the dentate gyrus to CA3. Although we observed that a classical axon guidance molecule, EphA4, was cleaved by BACE1 when co-expressed with BACE1 in HEK293 cells, we could find no evidence of BACE1 processing of EphA4 in the brain. Remarkably, we discovered that the axon guidance defects of BACE1−/− mice were strikingly similar to those of mice deficient in a recently identified BACE1 substrate, the neural cell adhesion molecule close homolog of L1 (CHL1) that is involved in neurite outgrowth. CHL1 undergoes BACE1-dependent processing in BACE1+/+, but not BACE1−/−, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb, indicating that CHL1 is a BACE1 substrate in vivo. Finally, BACE1 and CHL1 co-localize in the terminals of hippocampal mossy fibers, olfactory sensory neuron axons, and growth cones of primary hippocampal neurons. We conclude that BACE1−/− axon guidance defects are likely the result of abrogated BACE1 processing of CHL1 and that BACE1 deficiency produces a CHL1 loss-of-function phenotype. Our results imply the possibility that axon mis-targeting may occur in adult neurogenic and/or regenerating neurons as a result of chronic BACE1 inhibition and add a note of caution to BACE1 inhibitor development.

Disease mortality is due primarily to metastatic spread, highlighting the urgent need to identify factors involved in this progression. Activation of the genetic epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) program is implicated as a major contributor of PCa progression. Initiation of EMT confers invasive and metastatic behavior in preclinical models and is correlated with poor clinical prognosis. Extracellular Hsp90 (eHsp90) promotes cell motility and invasion in cancer cells and metastasis in preclinical models, however, the mechanistic basis for its widespread tumorigenic function remains unclear. We have identified a novel and pivotal role for eHsp90 in driving EMT events in PCa. In support of this notion, more metastatic PCa lines exhibited increased eHsp90 expression relative to their lineage-related nonmetastatic counterparts. We demonstrate that eHsp90 promoted cell motility in an ERK and matrix metalloproteinase-2/9-dependent manner, and shifted cellular morphology toward a mesenchymal phenotype. Conversely, inhibition of eHsp90 attenuated pro-motility signaling, blocked PCa migration, and shifted cell morphology toward an epithelial phenotype. Last, we report that surface eHsp90 was found in primary PCa tumor specimens, and elevated eHsp90 expression was associated with increased levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2/9 transcripts.

Although these reports strongly implicate eHsp90 in disease progression, a mechanistic basis for this putative function remains largely unknown. The present study identifies eHsp90 as a pivotal regulator of E-cadherin function in PCa. Importantly, we demonstrate that modest, physiologically relevant expression of secreted eHsp90 reduces the expression and alters the localization of E-cadherin in phenotypically epithelial cell lines. In addition, eHsp90 modulates numerous genetic events consistent with activation of EMT, as well as promoting diminished cell adhesion, conversion to a more mesenchymal morphology, and increased cell motility. In addition to its role in initiating EMT events, eHsp90 is also essential for sustaining the mesenchymal properties and behavior of more aggressive PCa cell types. Finally, we report that surface eHsp90 is found in primary PCa tumor specimens and is correlated with markedly elevated expression of a subset of pro-tumorigenic eHsp90-regulated transcripts. This newly identified role for eHsp90 as a mediator of EMT events provides a mechanistic basis for its ability to promote cancer progression and metastasis in a variety of preclinical models. Moreover, the newly identified expression of eHsp90 in PCa specimens, coupled with its potential role in modulating gene expression, implicates a clinical role for eHsp90 in PCa progression. Cell extracts for Western blot analysis were prepared and performed as described (30Gopal U. Bohonowych J.E. Lema-Tome C. Liu A. Garrett-Mayer E. Wang B. Isaacs J.S.

Mouse monoclonal LRP1 antibody (11H4) was purified from a hybridoma cell line (CRL 1936) purchased from ATCC. The hybridoma supernatant was concentrated with a Vivacell 70 concentrator (Sartorius Biolab Products) and purified with an NAb protein G antibody purification kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and aliquots were stored at −20 °C. Recombinant Hsp90α protein was obtained from Enzo Life Sciences (ADI-SPP-776). Geldanamycin was obtained from the Experimental Therapeutics Branch, National Cancer Institute, DMAG-N-oxide modified geldanamycin (or nonpermeable GA, NPGA used at 1 μm) was synthesized by Chris Lindsey and Craig Beeson (Pharmaceutical Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina). MMP inhibitors GM6001 (CC1010 used at 1 μm), MMP-2/9 inhibitor IV (444274 used at 1 μm), and MMP-3 inhibitor IV (444243 used at 5 μm) were obtained from EMD Millipore Chemicals. MEK inhibitor U0126 (V112A used at 10 μm) was obtained from Promega. The prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and LNCaP were obtained from ATCC, the ARCaP cell pair was purchased from Novicure Biotechnology, and C4–2B was obtained from Viromed. The P69/M12 cell pair was a gift from Joy Ware. The ARCaP and P69/M12 cell pair was maintained in T-media supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and the LNCaP and C4-2B pair was maintained in their specified media supplemented with 1% HEPES and 1% penicilin/streptomycin in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. The plasmid for shLRP1 was as previously described (29Cheng C.F. Fan J. Fedesco M. Guan S. Li Y. Bandyopadhyay B. Bright A.M. Yerushalmi D. Liang M. Chen M. Han Y.P. Woodley D.T. Li W.

The sequence for Hsp90α was cloned in-frame to a 5′ signal peptide to direct its extracellular localization, and 3′ to a V5 tag and His6 epitope, with each epitope separated by a flexible linker. The product was assembled in a Gateway entry vector and recombined (CRE) into Plenti6.3V5-Dest (Invitrogen). To obtain viral particles for LRP1 suppression and constitutive eHsp90 secretion, 293FT cells (Invitrogen) were co-transfected with the viral packaging plasmids vesicular stomatitis virus G and PΔR 8.71, along with the corresponding lentiviral vector. All plasmid transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Following viral plasmid transfection, cell medium was harvested at 48 h, the lentiviral supernatant was concentrated by ultracentrifugation, titered, and 5 × 104 particles were used to infect the recipient cells in the presence of Polybrene (8 μg/ml). Cells transduced with eHsp90 virus were selected in blasticidin (Invivogen), whereas GFP-shLRP1-transduced cells were selected by flow cytometry to isolate the highest GFP expressing cells. Selection for eHsp90-transduced cells was performed for 2 weeks, whereupon surviving cells were pooled. Human prostate tissue was obtained via an approved research protocol with informed written consent of all participants. Adjacent tissue specimens were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen or fixed in formalin and paraffin-embedded for histological analysis. Tumor tissue specimens were mechanically and enzymatically digested as previously described (42Garraway I.P. Sun W. Tran C.P. Perner S. Zhang B. Goldstein A.S. Hahm S.A. Haider M. Head C.S.

Cells were resuspended and incubated (15 min at 4 °C) with either isotype-matched control or anti-Hsp90 antibody (SPS-771-PE, 1:50), and subjected to FACS analysis (BD FACS Aria II system). Cell populations corresponding to eHsp90high and eHsp90low subtypes were gated and isolated (minimum signal threshold set at 10e2). RNA purification from patient samples was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Qiagen RNeasy Plus Micro kit; 74034). RNA purification from cells was performed following a TRIzol/chloroform extraction (Qiagen miRNeasy kit; 217004). mRNA from cells and patient material was converted into complimentary DNA (OriGene first strand cDNA synthesis kit; NP100042, and Bio-Rad iScript advanced cDNA synthesis kit; 170–8842, respectively) and amplified. Array samples were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen RT2 first strand kit; 330401), and further analyzed using an EMT profiler array (Qiagen; PAHS-090A). Biological replicates were utilized for the initial array analysis, and select results were validated with additional biological replicates. Primers (supplemental Table S1) were purchased from IDT. Wounding assays were performed as previously described (30Gopal U. Bohonowych J.E. Lema-Tome C. Liu A. Garrett-Mayer E. Wang B. Isaacs J.S. A novel extracellular Hsp90 mediated co-receptor function for LRP1 regulates EphA2-dependent glioblastoma cell invasion.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e17649Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, a thin sterile pipette tip was used to create a scratch wound in confluent cell monolayers. Pictures were taken at 0 and 16–20 h with an inverted Nikon eclipse TE 2000-S microscope with ×10 magnification, and the extent of migration was calculated by measurement of the gap area using Image J software. For all motility experiments, mitomycin C (5 μg/ml) (Sigma) was added at the time of plating to suppress proliferation. The gelatinolytic activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was determined by gelatin zymography in 0.1% gelatin, 10% acrylamide gels. Samples were prepared by plating cells at 50% confluence, and conditioned medium (0.25% serum in DMEM) was collected after 36 h. 1 mm O-phenanthroline monohydrate was added to halt MMP activity. Conditioned medium was incubated with gelatin-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare, 17-0956-01) and the eluted samples were run in nonreducing conditions. Gels were washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 renaturing buffer, incubated in a Tris-HCl/Brij 35 developing buffer (42 °C for 24 h), and subsequently stained with a 5% Coomassie solution. To detect expression of secreted Hsp90α, equivalent cell numbers (7.5 × 105) were plated overnight and replenished with complete media 24 h prior to harvest. Conditioned medium was collected, debris was removed by centrifugation (5 min, 1200 × g), and Hsp90α levels was detected by ELISA (Enzo Life Sciences). Values are presented as fold-change of Hsp90/ml of conditioned medium with the standard deviation shown.

https://openalex.org/W1966851131,"The miR-106b-25 microRNA (miRNA) cluster is a candidate oncogene in human prostate cancer. Here, we report that miRNAs encoded by miR-106b-25 are upregulated in both primary tumors and distant metastasis. Moreover, increased tumor miR-106b expression was associated with disease recurrence and the combination of high miR-106b and low CASP7 (caspase-7) expressions in primary tumors was an independent predictor of early disease recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio=4.1; 95% confidence interval: 1.6–12.3). To identify yet unknown oncogenic functions of miR-106b, we overexpressed it in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells to examine miR-106b-induced global expression changes among protein-coding genes. The approach revealed that CASP7 is a direct target of miR-106b, which was confirmed by western blot analysis and a 3′-untranslated region reporter assay. Moreover, selected phenotypes induced by miR-106b knockdown in DU145 human prostate cancer cells did not develop when both miR-106b and CASP7 expression were inhibited. Further analyses showed that CASP7 is downregulated in primary prostate tumors and metastatic lesions across multiple data sets and is by itself associated with disease recurrence and disease-specific survival. Using bioinformatics, we also observed that miR-106b-25 may specifically influence focal adhesion-related pathways. This observation was experimentally examined using miR-106b-25-transduced 22Rv1 human prostate cancer cells. After infection with a miR-106b-25 lentiviral expression construct, 22Rv1 cells showed increased adhesion to basement membrane- and bone matrix-related filaments and enhanced soft agar growth. In summary, miR-106b-25 was found to be associated with prostate cancer progression and disease outcome and may do so by altering apoptosis- and focal adhesion-related pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2110264417,"Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is highly expressed in epithelial-transformed neoplasia and tumor-initiated cells (TICs), but the role that EpCAM plays in the stemness properties of TICs is still unclear. Here we show that EpCAM and reprogramming factors (c-Myc, Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2) were concomitantly elevated in TICs, which were shown to have superior self-renewal, invasiveness, and tumor-initiating abilities. Elevation of EpCAM enhanced tumorsphere formation and tumor initiation. Knockdown of EpCAM inhibited the expressions of reprogramming factors and epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes, thereby suppressing tumor initiation, self-renewal, and invasiveness. In addition, EpCAM, especially intracellular domain of EpCAM (EpICD), bound to and activated the promoter of reprogramming factors. Treatment with the inhibitor of γ-secretase (DAPT) led to the blockage of the expressions of reprogramming factors and epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes, which was accompanied by the reduction of tumor self-renewal and invasion. Furthermore, the increased release of EpEX enhanced production of EpICD and regulated the expression of reprogramming factors. Together, these findings suggest that EpCAM plays an important role in regulating cancer-initiating abilities in TICs of colon cancer. This discovery can be used in the development of new strategies for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2031108531,"Osteoclasts, highly differentiated bone-resorbing cells of hematopoietic origin, have two conflicting tendencies: a lower capacity to survive and a higher capacity to execute energy-consuming activities such as bone resorption. Here, we report that when compared with their precursors, mature mitochondria-rich osteoclasts have lower levels of intracellular ATP, which is associated with receptor activator of nuclear factor κ-B ligand (RANKL)-induced Bcl-x(L) down-regulation. Severe ATP depletion, caused by disrupting mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) gene, leads to increased bone-resorbing activity despite accelerated apoptosis. Although AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation by ATP depletion is not involved in the regulation of osteoclast function, the release of ATP from intracellular stores negatively regulates bone-resorbing activity through an autocrine/paracrine feedback loop by altering cytoskeletal structures. Furthermore, osteoclasts derived from aged mice exhibit reduced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and intracellular ATP levels with increased bone-resorbing activity, implicating the possible involvement of age-related mitochondrial dysfunction in osteoporosis. Thus, our study provides evidence for a mechanism underlying the control of cellular functions by reciprocal changes in intracellular and extracellular ATP, which regulate the negative correlation between osteoclast survival and bone resorption."
https://openalex.org/W1981134537,"The abundance and structural diversity of glycans on glycoproteins and glycolipids are highly regulated and play important roles during vertebrate development. Because of the challenges associated with studying glycan regulation in vertebrate embryos, we have chosen to study mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells as they differentiate into embryoid bodies (EBs) or into extraembryonic endodermal (ExE) cells as a model for cellular differentiation. We profiled N- and O-glycan structures isolated from these cell populations and examined transcripts encoding the corresponding enzymatic machinery for glycan biosynthesis in an effort to probe the mechanisms that drive the regulation of glycan diversity. During differentiation from mouse ES cells to either EBs or ExE cells, general trends were detected. The predominance of high mannose N-glycans in ES cells shifted to an equal abundance of complex and high mannose structures, increased sialylation, and increased α-Gal termination in the differentiated cell populations. Whereas core 1 O-glycan structures predominated in all three cell populations, increased sialylation and increased core diversity characterized the O-glycans of both differentiated cell types. Increased polysialylation was also found in both differentiated cell types. Differences between the two differentiated cell types included greater sialylation of N-glycans in EBs, whereas α-Gal-capped structures were more prevalent in ExE cells. Changes in glycan structures generally, but not uniformly, correlated with alterations in transcript abundance for the corresponding biosynthetic enzymes, suggesting that transcriptional regulation contributes significantly to the regulation of glycan expression. Knowledge of glycan structural diversity and transcript regulation should provide greater understanding of the roles of protein glycosylation in vertebrate development."
https://openalex.org/W1992473001,"The RNA helicase p68 (DDX5) is an established co-activator of the p53 tumour suppressor that itself has a pivotal role in orchestrating the cellular response to DNA damage. Although several factors influence the biological outcome of p53 activation, the mechanisms governing the choice between cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we show that, while p68 is critical for p53-mediated transactivation of the cell-cycle arrest gene p21(WAF1/CIP1), it is dispensable for induction of several pro-apoptotic genes in response to DNA damage. Moreover, p68 depletion results in a striking inhibition of recruitment of p53 and RNA Pol II to the p21 promoter but not to the Bax or PUMA promoters, providing an explanation for the selective effect on p21 induction. Importantly, these findings are mirrored in a novel inducible p68 knockout mouse model in which p68 depletion results in a selective inhibition of p21 induction in several tissues. Moreover, in the bone marrow, p68 depletion results in an increased sensitivity to γ-irradiation, consistent with an increased level of apoptosis. These data highlight a novel function of p68 as a modulator of the decision between p53-mediated growth arrest and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2135734220,"We study a mechanism by which dimerization of the EGF receptor (EGFR) cytoplasmic domain is transmitted to the ectodomain. Therapeutic and other small molecule antagonists to the kinase domain that stabilize its active conformation, but not those that stabilize an inactive conformation, stabilize ectodomain dimerization. Inhibitor-induced dimerization requires an asymmetric kinase domain interface associated with activation. EGF and kinase inhibitors stimulate formation of identical dimer interfaces in the EGFR transmembrane domain, as shown by disulfide cross-linking. Disulfide cross-linking at an interface in domain IV in the ectodomain was also stimulated similarly; however, EGF but not inhibitors stimulated cross-linking in domain II. Inhibitors similarly induced noncovalent dimerization in nearly full-length, detergent-solubilized EGFR as shown by gel filtration. EGFR ectodomain deletion resulted in spontaneous dimerization, whereas deletion of exons 2-7, in which extracellular domains III and IV are retained, did not. In EM, kinase inhibitor-induced dimers lacked any well defined orientation between the ectodomain monomers. Fab of the therapeutic antibody cetuximab to domain III confirmed a variable position and orientation of this domain in inhibitor-induced dimers but suggested that the C termini of domain IV of the two monomers were in close proximity, consistent with dimerization in the transmembrane domains. The results provide insights into the relative energetics of intracellular and extracellular dimerization in EGFR and have significance for physiologic dimerization through the asymmetric kinase interface, bidirectional signal transmission in EGFR, and mechanism of action of therapeutics."

All cell surfaces in nature are covered by a glycocalyx, a dense “sugar coat” formed by a complex array of glycans, the oligo- and polysaccharides attached to glycoproteins and glycolipids (1Varki A. Schauer R. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, NY2009: 199-218Google Scholar).

Sias are nine-carbon backbone amino sugars found abundantly on mammalian cell surfaces and secretions (3Schauer R. Chemistry, metabolism, and biological functions of sialic acids.Adv. Carbohydr.

Sialic acids: fascinating sugars in higher animals and man.Zoology. 2004; 107: 49-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). These acidic sugars serve a wide variety of biological roles, ranging from structural roles based on their negative charge to involvement in molecular recognition during development, immune regulation, and carcinogenesis (1Varki A. Schauer R. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, NY2009: 199-218Google Scholar). Although there are >50 different forms of Sias in nature, the two most common Sias found in mammals are N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and its derivative N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) (1Varki A. Schauer R. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, NY2009: 199-218Google Scholar). Sias are found as the outermost monosaccharide, where they cap the majority of glycans at the sperm cell surface. The sperm sialome refers to the totality of Sias present on sperm. The sialome of each mature sperm cell consists of tens of millions of Sia molecules and is acquired during spermatogenesis and epididymal maturation and by incorporation of seminal fluid components into the sperm membrane during ejaculation (5Bernal A.

As foreign cells, sperm face important challenges once deposited inside the female reproductive tract (7Drobnis E.Z. Overstreet J.W. Natural history of mammalian spermatozoa in the female reproductive tract.Oxf. Rev. Reprod. Biol. 1992; 14: 1-45PubMed Google Scholar). Humoral and cellular female immune factors lead to the rapid demise of most sperm after insemination when the leukocytic reaction in the female unleashes countless leukocytes in the uterus (8Pandya I.J. Cohen J. The leukocytic reaction of the human uterine cervix to spermatozoa.Fertil. Steril. 1985; 43: 417-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 9Thompson L.A. Barratt C.L.

Antibodies and complement are also present in female reproductive tract secretions (10Brandtzaeg P. Mucosal immunity in the female genital tract.J. Reprod. Immunol. 1997; 36: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mammalian leukocytes express lineage-specific combinations of Sia-binding immune regulatory lectins (Siglecs (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin superfamily lectins)). Most of these Siglecs exert inhibitory effects upon binding Sias, and properly engaging these Siglecs is likely to be important for sperm survival (11Crocker P.R. Paulson J.C. Varki A. Siglecs and their roles in the immune system.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). Insufficient decoration with Sias will thus put sperm at increased risk of female immune discrimination. The complement system also relies in part on appropriate sialylation of cells to detect “self” and to inhibit activation based on factor H binding (12Meri S. Pangburn M.K. Discrimination between activators and nonactivators of the alternative pathway of complement: regulation via a sialic acid/polyanion-binding site on factor H.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Sia content of mammalian sperm has been shown to correlate positively with protection from phagocytosis but negatively with the capacity of sperm to bind to the zona pellucida of the ovum (13Toshimori K.

In primates, sperm are also abundantly coated with sialylated β-defensin 126 in the distal epididymis, and this coating helps prevent the recognition of potent sperm antigens by female antibodies (16Yudin A.I.

It is also established that the mammalian process of sperm capacitation is accompanied by a reduction in sialylation (17Familiari G. Motta P.M.

Existing studies of Sia modulation in sperm have relied mostly on indirect measures of loss of sialoglycoconjugates, and mechanisms remain unknown. Sialidase activity has been reported in the sperm acrosome and female genital tract (19Srivastava P.N. Zaneveld L.J. Williams W.L. Mammalian sperm acrosomal neuraminidases.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The aim of this study was to gain insight into the mechanism of sperm sialome loss during capacitation. We found evidence for shed Sia monosaccharides, quantified their release from sperm incubated under capacitating conditions, and measured sperm sialidase activity. We then probed mouse and human sperm for the presence of sialidases and used a sialidase inhibitor to test the role of sperm sialidases in capacitation and zona pellucida binding. All samples used for this study were anonymized. Samples were from volunteer participants who gave written informed consent. The sample collection was approved by University of California San Diego Human Subject Protection Institutional Review Board 040613 or by University of Cincinnati Human Subject Protection Institutional Review Board 10-36. C57BL/6 mice were kept under University of California San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Protocol S01227. Sperm were harvested from the cauda epididymides of males killed at 12–20 weeks of age. The cauda epididymis was squashed and kept on a shaker at room temperature for 10 min. Sperm were washed and subjected to a swim-up procedure in Biggers-Whitten-Whittingham (BWW) buffer following published procedures (21Nixon B. MacIntyre D.A. Mitchell L.A. Gibbs G.M. O'Bryan M.

For lectin binding, sperm were fixed with 3% freshly thawed paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and blocked with 1% BSA in TBS/Tween. Biotinylated Sambucus nigra lectin, Maackia amurensis lectin II, and Erythrina crista-galli lectin (1:1000; Vector Labs) were used at room temperature for 30 min and detected with Alexa Fluor 555/488-conjugated streptavidin (1:1000; Invitrogen) at room temperature for 30 min. For detection of peanut agglutinin (PNA) on live sperm, propidium iodide (1:1000; Roche Applied Science) and FITC-PNA (1:1000; Vector Labs) were used at room temperature for 10 min. For detection Neu1 and Neu3, sperm were fixed with methanol for 20 min at −20 °C and then blocked with 1% BSA in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. For Neu1, sperm were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature. Anti-Neu1 and anti-Neu3 antibodies (1:100 were used at 4 °C for 1 h. Goat anti-mouse/rabbit antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (1:200; Invitrogen) were used at 4 °C for 1 h. For detection of PY20, sperm were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min. Anti-PY20 antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 and mouse IgG2b (1:1000; BioLegend) were used at 4 °C for 1 h. Stained sperm were analyzed by flow cytometry on a BD FACSCalibur. A smear of stained sperm was also made for microscopy and microphotography on an Applied Precision DeltaVision inverted deconvolution system. Sperm membrane-bound Sias were prepared by exposing washed sperm cells to double-distilled H2O for 15 min at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Sia contents of sperm were analyzed by HPLC of Sia extracts of sperm membrane obtained after 2 m acetic acid hydrolysis at 80 °C for 3 h. Released Sias were filtered through Microcon 10 columns (Millipore), treated with mild base, and derivatized in 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene (Sigma) reagent for 2.5 h at 50 °C in the dark. HPLC was performed over a Varian C18 reverse phase column under isocratic conditions in 83% water, 7% methanol, and 8% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min over 50 min using a Hitachi HPLC system (25Manzi A.E.

Sia standards were from bovine submaxillary mucin as well as commercially available Neu5Ac (Nacalai) and Neu5Gc (Inalco). Supernatants were separately analyzed by 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene derivatization and HPLC. Sia monosaccharides released into the medium were determined by 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene derivatization with trifluoroacetic acid (27Cheng M.C. Lin S.L. Wu S.H. Inoue S. Inoue Y.

Assays were carried out in 100 μl of BWW buffer containing 25 μl of 0.2 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5), 2.5 μl of 2 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Sigma), and 2.5 μl of 10 mg/ml BSA (Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 2 h, after which the supernatant was collected. A reference standard was generated by hydrolyzing 1 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid in 10 mm HCl at 80 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 200 μl of 20 mm sodium bicarbonate (pH 10.6) and read using a SpectraMax M3 microplate reader at an excitation of 365 nm and an emission of 450 nm (28Moore M.L.

At the same time, 2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid (DANA) and free Neu5Ac were used at 1 mm to inhibit sialidase activity in each experimental group. Sialidase activity was assayed with and without protease inhibitor (protease inhibitor mixture set III, EDTA-free (1:100), Calbiochem) in the capacitation medium and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. A C57BL/6 male mouse was caged with two estrus females at 8:30 a.m. Females were inspected for the presence of a vaginal plug every 30 min thereafter. Mated females were killed 1.5 h post-mating, and the uterus was excised, clamped shut with forceps, and flushed with PBS (29Yamauchi Y. Ajduk A. Riel J.M. Ward M.A. Ejaculated and epididymal mouse spermatozoa are different in their susceptibility to nuclease-dependent DNA damage and in their nuclease activity.Biol. Reprod. 2007; 77: 636-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Three-week-old FVB/N female mice were superovulated by sequential administration of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin and human chorionic gonadotropin (Sigma) (30Singavarapu R. Buchinsky N. Cheon D.J. Orsulic S. Whole ovary immunohistochemistry for monitoring cell proliferation and ovulatory wound repair in the mouse.Reprod. Biol. Endocrinol. 2010; 8: 98Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Oocytes were collected by flushing the oviduct and stripped of the cumulus cell by treatment with 1 mg/ml bovine hyaluronidase (Irvine Scientific) for 5 min. Fresh cauda epididymal sperm were incubated in the capacitation medium with or without DANA and added to the oocytes for co-incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The eggs were individually aspirated into a new drop of medium, placed on glass, kept on ice for 5 min, stained with DAPI (1:50,000; Sigma) at room temperature for 2 min, and analyzed under a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope. Data sets were tested for normal distribution using a Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test and analyzed for statistical significance by one-way analysis of variance using Prism software. All values shown are means ± S.E. We detected free Sia monosaccharides in the supernatant of the capacitation medium (Fig. 1, A and B) by HPLC. Mice sperm released both Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc, whereas human sperm released only NeuAc. The presence of free Sias in the supernatant corresponded with a decrease in Sias on sperm after in vitro incubation under capacitating conditions. Furthermore, sialoglycoconjugates were also released from the sperm surface (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). These experiments show that the sperm lost ∼20% of the sperm membrane Sias during capacitation and that ∼30% of the released Sias appeared to have been released in their monosaccharide form. Correspondingly, after incubation under capacitating conditions, the number of exposed underlying galactose residues increased (Fig. 1, C and D), as revealed by the increased binding of the galactose-specific E. crista-galli lectin and PNA, confirming the loss of Sias from both N- and O-linked glycans. E. crista-galli lectin is specific for galactose linked β1–4 to N-acetylglucosamine found mostly on N-glycans, whereas PNA is specific for galactose in β1–3-glycosidic linkage to N-acetylgalactosamine mostly found on O-glycans. The major cell surface glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored sialoglycopeptide is CD52, which sperm gain during epididymal maturation (31Schröter S. Derr P. Conradt H.S. Nimtz M. Hale G. Kirchhoff C. Male-specific modification of human CD52.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29862-29873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We incubated epididymal mouse sperm with seminal vesicle fluid to allow acquisition of CD52. We measured the change in CD52 in sperm incubated under capacitating conditions using an antibody specific for the peptide of CD52 (supplemental Fig. 4A). We detected a minor loss, indicating that this key glycoprotein remains mostly on the sperm surface and thus must be one of the targets of the sperm sialidases. The release of Sia monosaccharides during in vitro capacitation of sperm, in the absence of any female enzymatic factors, indicates the existence of a sperm cell-autonomous enzymatic mechanism for desialylation. To detect sialidase activity on sperm during capacitation, we used 4-methylumbelliferylsialic acid substrate, which generates a fluorescent product when cleaved by any sialidase. Sialidase activity increased under in vitro capacitating conditions in mouse and human sperm and could be specifically inhibited by addition of the sialidase inhibitor DANA (Fig. 1, E and F). Furthermore, analysis of sialidase activity in vivo also revealed a marked increase in uterine fluid but not in sperm retrieved from the uterus at that time (Fig. 1G). There are four known vertebrate sialidases/neuraminidases (32Monti E. Bonten E. D'Azzo A. Bresciani R. Venerando B. Borsani G. Schauer R. Tettamanti G.

Takahashi K. Hata K. Shiozaki K. Yamaguchi K. Sialidase significance for cancer progression.Glycoconj. J. 2012; (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Two (Neu1 and Neu3) have been reported at the cell membrane. We stained mouse sperm with antibodies specific for Neu1, a lysosomal neuraminidase known to be active at the cell membrane, where it can associate with cathepsin A and β-galactosidase (34Coutinho M. Lacerda L. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Baptista E. Ribeiro H. Prata M. Alves S. Lysosomal multienzymatic complex-related diseases: a genetic study among Portuguese patients.Clin. Genet. 2012; 81: 370-393Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and for Neu3, the neuraminidase known to act specifically on gangliosides (35Hasegawa T. Yamaguchi K. Wada T. Takeda A. Itoyama Y. Miyagi T. Molecular cloning of mouse ganglioside sialidase and its increased expression in Neuro2a cell differentiation.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8007-8015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Flow cytometry revealed a reduction in the levels of Neu1 and Neu3 after in vitro capacitation. Both flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy showed that anti-Neu1 and anti-Neu3 antibodies bound to uncapacitated mouse epididymal sperm in the head region and, to a lesser degree, after in vitro capacitation (Fig. 2, A and B). Neu1 and Neu3 were detected on the surface of mouse sperm in the cauda epididymis and on ejaculated human sperm (Fig. 2D). In contrast, neither sialidase was detected on mouse sperm in the testes or caput of the epididymis (Fig. 2C), suggesting a delayed expression of Neu1/3 transcripts. Both sialidases appeared to be released during in vitro incubation under capacitating conditions as measured by dot blotting as well by Western blotting of sperm membranes (Fig. 2E). Protease inhibition prevented much of this shedding and also reduced sialidase activity (Fig. 3D), indicating that shedding of sialidases depends at least in part on protease activity. The loss of α2–3- and α2–6-Sias, as well as exposure of the underlying β1–4-Gal, was only partly inhibited by treatment with DANA (supplemental Fig. 3, A–C). We also found Neu1 in the oviductal epithelium and Neu3 in the uterine luminal/glandular and oviductal epithelia (supplemental Fig. 2). Surprisingly, inhibition of sperm sialidases by DANA also resulted in increased shedding of the enzymes from the sperm (Fig. 2, C and D), indicating that merely engaging the binding pocket of the sialidases triggers their shedding.FIGURE 3Function of neuraminidase during capacitation.

The effect of sperm sialidase activity on mouse and human sperm capacitation status and on the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway was analyzed by assessing tyrosine phosphorylation using antibodies against phosphotyrosine (PY20) and phosphorylated ERK. Inhibition of sperm sialidases by DANA led to reductions in tyrosine phosphorylation as well as ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3, B and C) in mice and humans, suggesting that functional sperm sialidases mediate sperm glycocalyx changes associated with sperm cell signaling. We established a flow cytometry-based assay for sperm NEU1/3 and analyzed human sperm samples collected at an infertility clinic. We found that out of 22 samples, four had very low levels of NEU3, one lacked NEU1, and one had low levels of both NEU1 and NEU3 (Fig. 4, A and B). Of these six subjects, only two had abnormal sperm parameters, whereas the other four had normal sperm parameters (based on computer-assisted sperm analysis and World Health Organization (2009) criteria for concentration, motility, and morphology). All 16 normal control samples had both NEU1 and NEU3 on their sperm surfaces. We used chimeric Siglec-6 Fc probes and a flow cytometry-based assay to test the binding of Siglec-6 to mouse sperm. Live mouse epididymal sperm bound strongly to Siglec-6 Fc probes (supplemental Fig. 4B), indicating that the sperm sialome is efficiently “probed” by this Siglec. As foreign cells, mammalian sperm face numerous challenges during their transit through the female reproductive tract en route to fertilization (7Drobnis E.Z. Overstreet J.W. Natural history of mammalian spermatozoa in the female reproductive tract.Oxf. Rev. Reprod. Biol. 1992; 14: 1-45PubMed Google Scholar). Surviving the onslaught of female immune factors is an absolute prerequisite for sperm to reach the upper oviduct for fertilization. Abundant sialylation likely facilitates tolerance by female innate pattern recognition molecules, both secreted molecules such as complement (factor H, which binds to Sia and prevents complement deposition (36Ram S. Sharma A.K. Simpson S.D. Gulati S. McQuillen D.P. Pangburn M.K. Rice P.A. A novel sialic acid-binding site on factor H mediates serum resistance of sialylated Neisseria gonorrhoeae.J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar)) and cell-bound molecules on female leukocytes such as Siglecs (11Crocker P.R. Paulson J.C. Varki A. Siglecs and their roles in the immune system.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar, 37Varki A. Gagneux P. Multifarious roles of sialic acids in immunity.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2012; 1253: 16-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In addition, terminal Sia decoration may mask potentially antigenic sperm molecules until after sperm have undergone capacitation. Removal of Sias exposes the underlying functional groups as the sperm nears the egg and its vestment. Such a antigen-masking role has been demonstrated for the highly sialylated β-defensin 126 on primate sperm (16Yudin A.I. Generao S.E. Tollner T.L. Treece C.A. Overstreet J.W. Cherr G.N. β-Defensin 126 on the cell surface protects sperm from immunorecognition and binding of anti-sperm antibodies.Biol. Reprod. 2005; 73: 1243-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Changes in sperm sialylation levels en route to fertilization have been reported for several decades. It has been proposed that such a loss involves small molecular weight sialoglycopeptides or gangliosides bearing α2–3- and α2–6-linked Sias prior to fertilization (18Focarelli R. Giuffrida A. Rosati F. Changes in the sialylglycoconjugate distribution on the human sperm surface during in vitro capacitation: partial purification of a 20-kDa sialylglycoprotein of capacitated spermatozoa.Hum. Reprod. 1995; 10: 2755-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 38Davis B.K. Byrne R. Bedigian K.

Androl. 1990; 11: 97-104PubMed Google Scholar). The shedding of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored sialoglycopeptides is also a distinct possibility. In our study, we detected, for the first time, the free Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc monosaccharides in the supernatant from the in vitro capacitation medium, indicating that some of the sialome loss is mediated by sperm sialidase activity (Fig. 1). We have reported the presence of two sperm enzymes (Neu1 and Neu3) that appear to modulate the sperm sialome by cleaving Sia molecules from sialoglycoconjugates during capacitation. Although we found evidence for some loss of CD52, the majority of this glycocalyx molecule remained on sperm after incubation under capacitating conditions. We could demonstrate sialidase activity as well as its selective inhibition with DANA, a known inhibitor of Neu1 and Neu3 (40Stamatos N.M. Carubelli I. van de Vlekkert D. Bonten E.J. Papini N. Feng C. Venerando B. d'Azzo A. Cross A.S. Wang L.X. Gomatos P.J. LPS-induced cytokine production in human dendritic cells is regulated by sialidase activity.J. Leukocyte Biol. 2010; 88: 1227-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The shedding of sialoglycoproteins and gangliosides might result from alteration in sperm membrane fluidity with cholesterol efflux induced by BSA and NaHCO3 (41Osheroff J.E. Visconti P.E. Valenzuela J.P. Travis A.J. Alvarez J. Kopf G.S. Regulation of human sperm capacitation by a cholesterol efflux-stimulated signal transduction pathway leading to protein kinase A-mediated up-regulation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation.Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1999; 5: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Neu1 and Neu3 were shed from capacitated sperm as indicated by a reduction in antibody staining and their detection in the supernatant of the capacitation medium. It remains to be determined to what degree residual function of the shed sialidases could play a role, such as in the desialylation of highly sialylated and sperm-modulating glycodelin-A in the oviduct (42Chiu P.C. Chung M.K. Koistinen R. Koistinen H. Seppala M. Ho P.C. Ng E.H. Lee K.F. Yeung W.S. Cumulus oophorus-associated glycodelin-C displaces sperm bound glycodelin-A and -F and stimulates spermatozoa-zona pellucida binding.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5378-5388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our finding that protease inhibition interfered with sialidase activity and shedding of sialidases from sperm in vitro indicates that a capacitation-associated enzymatic cleavage of Neu1 and Neu3 is required for function and shedding. Treatment with DANA strongly reduced the shedding of the two sialidases (Fig. 2, C and D). Neu1 and Neu3 were both found along the female reproductive tract as well (supplemental Fig. 2). The distribution of Neu1 in the uterus and Neu3 in the fallopian tube in female mice would indicate that Sias from glycoproteins and glycolipids (gangliosides) might be differentially targeted. To what extent the sialidases on sperm and those along the female reproductive tract might synergize or conflict for modifying sperm remains unclear. Inhibition with DANA affected the function and capacitation status of sperm (Fig. 3) as determined by sperm-egg binding assay and by analysis of phosphorylation levels. These findings indicate that the partial loss of sperm Sias represents not just a side effect of capacitation but rather plays a key role in mediating the process of sperm capacitation. We investigated the potential role of sperm sialidase NEU1 and NEU3 levels in human male idiopathic infertility (Fig. 4B). Male infertility is a common condition (43Akanji Tijani H. Bhattacharya S. The role of intrauterine insemination in male infertility.Hum. Fertil. 2010; 13: 226-232Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), with ∼75% involving idiopathic factors. It is conceivable that inappropriate sialidase expression on sperm (total absence or low levels) might underlie some of the unexplained male infertility. Our results indicate that such inadequate levels of sperm sialidase might underlie some forms of idiopathic male infertility. Furthermore, lack of appropriate protease function might also hinder sialidase shedding during capacitation. The precise consequences of controlled and enzymatically mediated partial loss of Sias from the sperm surface on sperm function during capacitation remain unknown. The partial Sia loss may serve to uncover critical receptors and contribute to membrane reorganization. It may also potentially allow uncapped desialylated glycans to engage lectins of the female tract in a manner that contributes to clustering of the sperm surface glycoconjugates and, in the process, facilitate signaling (Fig. 5), analogous to that of T-cell and dendritic cell regulation (40Stamatos N.M. Carubelli I. van de Vlekkert D. Bonten E.J. Papini N. Feng C. Venerando B. d'Azzo A. Cross A.S. Wang L.X. Gomatos P.J.

Immunol. 2009; 182: 4036-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Having identified two types of sialidases on sperm with a role in mediating capacitation in vitro opens the way to studies of Sia modulation and its significance for sperm function in vivo. The recent finding that human sperm bind to a sialylated ligand (sialyl-LewisX) on the zona pellucida (45Pang P.C. Chiu P.C. Lee C.L. Chang L.Y. Panico M. Morris H.R. Haslam S.M. Khoo K.H. Clark G.F.

https://openalex.org/W1971450255,"Ewing sarcoma is a pediatric bone tumor characterized in 85% of cases by the fusion between EWS and FLI1 genes that results in the expression of the EWS-FLI1 aberrant transcription factor. Histologically, the Ewing tumor expresses high levels of the CD99 membrane glycoprotein. It has been recently described that CD99 expression contributes to the Ewing tumor oncogenesis by modulating growth and differentiation of tumor cells. Different studies have also shown that overexpression of EWS-FLI1 induces CD99 expression in non-Ewing cells. At the opposite, the knockdown of EWS-FLI1 expression by siRNA approaches has no significant effect on CD99 mRNA level in Ewing cells. Here, by in vivo and in vitro studies, we show that while EWS-FLI1 inhibition has only slight effects on the amount of CD99 transcript, it induces a dramatic decrease of the CD99 protein expression level, hence suggesting post-transcriptional regulations, possibly mediated by microRNAs. To further investigate this issue, we identified a set of 91 miRNAs that demonstrate EWS-FLI1 modulation, three of them being predicted to bind CD99 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR). Among these, we show that miR-30a-5p has the ability to interact with the 3′UTR region of CD99 and to regulate its expression. Moreover, the re-expression of miRNA-30a-5p in Ewing cell line induces decreased cell proliferation and invasion. In this study, we therefore show that miR-30a-5p constitutes a major functional link between EWS-FLI1 and CD99, two critical biomarkers and therapeutic targets in Ewing sarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2017901652,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive and the commonest primary brain tumor with a tendency for local invasiveness. The pathways of neoplasia, invasion and inflammation are inextricably linked in cancer and aberrations in several regulatory pathways for these processes have been identified. Here we have studied the FAT1 (Homo sapiens FAT tumor-suppressor homolog 1 (Drosophila)) gene to identify its role in the tumorigenecity of the gliomas. The expression of FAT1 was found to be high in grade IV glioma cell lines (U87MG, A172, U373MG and T98G) but low in grade III glioma cell lines (GOS3 and SW1088). Two cell lines (U87MG and A172) with high FAT1 expression were chosen for in vitro FAT1-knockdown studies. FAT1 knockdown by small interfering RNA resulted in decreased migration and invasion of both the cell lines along with increased expression of the tumor-suppressor gene programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4). Increased PDCD4 expression led to the attenuation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription by inhibiting c-Jun phosphorylation and resulted in concomitant decrease in the expression of AP-1-target genes like MMP3, VEGF-C and PLAU, the pro-inflammatory regulator COX-2 and cytokines IL1β and IL-6. Conversely, simultaneous silencing of PDCD4 and FAT1 in these cells significantly enhanced AP-1 activity and expression of its target genes, resulting in increase in mediators of inflammation and in enhanced migratory and invasive properties of the cells. We also observed a negative correlation between the expression of FAT1 and PDCD4 (P=0.0145), a positive correlation between the expression of FAT1 and COX-2 (P=0.048) and a similar positive trend between FAT1 and IL-6 expression in 35 primary human GBM samples studied. Taken together, this study identifies a novel signaling mechanism mediated by FAT1 in regulating the activity of PDCD4 and thereby the key transcription factor AP-1, which then affects known mediators of neoplasia and inflammation."

We report here that transgenic Sirt1 expression is oncogenic in murine thyroid and prostate carcinogenesis initiated by Pten-deficiency. Based on mRNA expression analyses of pre-tumoral murine thyroids, we find that SIRT1 increases c-MYC transcriptional programs. Moreover, we show higher c-MYC protein levels in murine thyroid cancers from Sirt1 transgenic mice. Similarly, SIRT1 is overexpressed in human thyroid cancers and it is positively correlated with c-MYC protein levels. Finally, we show in cultured thyroid cancer cells that SIRT1 stabilizes c-MYC protein. These results implicate SIRT1 as a new candidate target for the treatment of thyroid carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2168017678,"Amyloid formation and accumulation is a hallmark of protein misfolding diseases and is associated with diverse pathologies including type II diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In vitro, amyloidogenesis is widely studied in conditions that do not simulate the crowded and viscous in vivo environment. A high volume fraction of most biological fluids is occupied by various macromolecules, a phenomenon known as macromolecular crowding. For some amyloid systems (e.g. α-synuclein) and under shaking condition, the excluded volume effect of macromolecular crowding favors aggregation, whereas increased viscosity reduces the kinetics of these reactions. Amyloidogenesis can also be catalyzed by hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfaces, represented by the air-water interface in vitro and diverse heterogeneous interfaces in vivo (e.g. membranes). In this study, we investigated the effects of two different crowding polymers (dextran and Ficoll) and two different experimental conditions (with and without shaking) on the fibrilization of amyloid-β peptide, a major player in AD pathogenesis. Specifically, we demonstrate that, during macromolecular crowding, viscosity dominates over the excluded volume effect only when the system is spatially non homogeneous (i.e. an air-water interface is present). We also show that the surfactant activity of the crowding agents can critically influence the outcome of macromolecular crowding and that the structure of the amyloid species formed may depend on the polymer used. This suggests that, in vivo, the outcome of amyloidogenesis may be affected by both macromolecular crowding and spatial heterogeneity (e.g. membrane turn-over). More generally, our work suggests that any factors causing changes in crowding may be susceptibility factors in AD."
https://openalex.org/W1971683400,"Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2) is one of the most highly responsive interferon-stimulated genes, but its biological functions are poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to explore the underlying mechanisms by which depleting IFIT2 induces the migration of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. Stable IFIT2-depleted cells underwent epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and exhibited enhanced cell motility and invasiveness compared with control cells. Furthermore, our results indicated that atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) was activated in IFIT2-depleted cells. Inhibition of aPKC using a specific myristoylated PKCζ pseudosubstrate or aPKC-targeting small interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished IFIT2 depletion-induced EMT, migration and invasion, indicating that the activation of aPKC has an essential role in regulating the cellular responses induced by IFIT2 depletion. Following tail-vein injection, IFIT2-depleted OSCC cells colonized not only the lungs but also the heart, head and neck, retroperitoneal, and peritoneal cavities; whereas control cells predominantly localized in the lungs. IFIT2 mRNA and protein expression was positively associated with E-cadherin expression in OSCC patient specimens. The loss of E-cadherin and IFIT2 expression was observed at the invasive front of OSCC tumors, suggesting that the loss of IFIT2 may induce EMT and lead to the metastasis of OSCCs. OSCC patients possessing reduced IFIT2-expression levels (IFIT2 <50%) exhibited greater rates of distant metastasis and poor prognoses compared with OSCC patients who expressed greater levels of IFIT2 (IFIT2 ⩾50%). These results demonstrate that IFIT2 depletion activates the aPKC pathway and consequently induces EMT, cell migration and invasion. Most importantly, depleting IFIT2 may participate in OSCC tumor progression, particularly during metastasis. Taken together, our study demonstrates that IFIT2, a protein responsible for interferon stimulation, may prevent OSCC metastasis and serve as a valuable prognostic marker."
https://openalex.org/W2038011382,"Testis differentiation in zebrafish involves juvenile ovary to testis transformation initiated by an apoptotic wave. The molecular regulation of this transformation process is not fully understood. NF-κB is activated at an early stage of development and has been shown to interact with steroidogenic factor-1 in mammals, leading to the suppression of anti-Müllerian hormone (Amh) gene expression. Because steroidogenic factor-1 and Amh are important for proper testis development, NF-κB-mediated induction of anti-apoptotic genes could, therefore, also play a role in zebrafish gonad differentiation. The aim of this study was to examine the potential role of NF-κB in zebrafish gonad differentiation. Exposure of juvenile zebrafish to heat-killed Escherichia coli activated the NF-κB pathways and resulted in an increased ratio of females from 30 to 85%. Microarray and quantitative real-time-PCR analysis of gonads showed elevated expression of NF-κB-regulated genes. To confirm the involvement of NF-κB-induced anti-apoptotic effects, zebrafish were treated with sodium deoxycholate, a known inducer of NF-κB or NF-κB activation inhibitor (NAI). Sodium deoxycholate treatment mimicked the effect of heat-killed bacteria and resulted in an increased proportion of females from 25 to 45%, whereas the inhibition of NF-κB using NAI resulted in a decrease in females from 45 to 20%. This study provides proof for an essential role of NF-κB in gonadal differentiation of zebrafish and represents an important step toward the complete understanding of the complicated process of sex differentiation in this species and possibly other cyprinid teleosts as well.

The molecular mechanism of sex determination is unknown in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Earlier, neither cytogenetic studies (1Sola L. Gornung E.

In mice, homozygous mutation of Sox9 binding site in Amh leads to lack of its transcription and development of pseudohermaphrodites (12Arango N.A. Lovell-Badge R. Behringer R.R.

Zebrafish gonadal differentiation starts with the formation of a juvenile ovarian structure that either matures into adult ovaries or transforms into testes (14Takahashi H. Juvenile Hermaphroditism in the Zebrafish, Brachydanio rerio.Bull. Fac. Fish. Hokkaido Univ. 1977; 28: 57-65Google Scholar, 15Wang X.G. Bartfai R. Sleptsova-Freidrich I. Orban L. The timing and extent of “juvenile ovary” phase are highly variable during zebrafish testis differentiation.J. Fish Biol. 2007; 70: 33-44Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The testis transformation process has been suggested to depend on apoptosis (16Uchida D. Yamashita M. Kitano T. Iguchi T. Oocyte apoptosis during the transition from ovary-like tissue to testes during sex differentiation of juvenile zebrafish.J. Exp. Biol. 2002; 205: 711-718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This was further supported by a recent study where mutations in the Fanconi anemia, complementation group L (fancl) gene led to germ cell apoptosis and consequently activated the testis development pathway (17Rodríguez-Marí A. Cañestro C. Bremiller R.A. Nguyen-Johnson A. Asakawa K. Kawakami K. Postlethwait J.H. Sex reversal in zebrafish fancl mutants is caused by Tp53-mediated germ cell apoptosis.PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1001034Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Introducing mutations in the tumor protein p53 (tp53) gene counteracted the effect of the fancl mutations (17Rodríguez-Marí A. Cañestro C. Bremiller R.A. Nguyen-Johnson A. Asakawa K. Kawakami K. Postlethwait J.H. Sex reversal in zebrafish fancl mutants is caused by Tp53-mediated germ cell apoptosis.PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1001034Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for apoptosis in this process. In line with this, germ cell numbers are also important for ovarian development and complete absence of germ cells results in development of sterile males (9Siegfried K.R. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Germ line control of female sex determination in zebrafish.Dev. Biol. 2008; 324: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 18Slanchev K. Stebler J. de la Cueva-Méndez G. Raz E.

Nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) is involved in regulation of inflammation, apoptosis, cell growth, and differentiation and can be activated by various physical and chemical factors (19Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Structure, regulation, and function of NF-κB.Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a protein complex composed of homo- or heterodimers of five members of the Rel family including NF-κB1 (p50), NF-κB2 (p52), Rel A (p65), Rel B, and c-Rel. These proteins are capable of binding one another with different binding specificities resulting in different DNA binding properties. The p65/p50 dimer is the most abundant heterodimeric form present in cells and is involved in transcription activation of a multitude of genes (19Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Structure, regulation, and function of NF-κB.Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar, 20Ghosh S. Hayden M.S. New regulators of NF-κB in inflammation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). NF-κB subunits are generally sequestered in the cytoplasm by the inhibitor protein IκB. Numerous factors including UV irradiation, stress, cytokine, and free radicals can promote IκB degradation of the IκB/NF-κB complex, allowing the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus resulting in subsequent induction of the transcription of its target genes (20Ghosh S. Hayden M.S. New regulators of NF-κB in inflammation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 21Xiao W.

The emerging role of phosphorylation and proteolysis.Immunity. 1995; 3: 263-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). NF-κB activation blocks apoptotic processes and promotes cell survival by interacting with the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family of genes (23Aggarwal B.B. Sethi G. Nair A. Ichikawa H. Nuclear factor-κB. A holy grail in cancer prevention and therapy.Curr. Signal Transduct. Ther. 2006; 1: 25-52Crossref Google Scholar, 24Srinivasula S.M. Ashwell J.D. IAPs. What's in a name?.Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 123-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). NF-κB is also known to interact with other nuclear receptors including the glucorticoid and androgen receptor as well as with other proteins to regulate gene expression (25Rao N.A. McCalman M.T. Moulos P. Francoijs K.J. Chatziioannou A. Kolisis F.N. Alexis M.N. Mitsiou D.J. Stunnenberg H.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24151-24156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). NF-κB is highly expressed in mammalian Sertoli cells; it is involved in regulation of spermatogenesis (27Delfino F. Walker W.H. Stage-specific nuclear expression of NF-κB in mammalian testis.Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1696-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and down-regulates the Amh gene expression in mammalian testis. This is due to NF-κB interaction with steroidogenic factor-1, which in turn leads to the recruitment of histone deacetylase and suppression of Amh gene expression (28Hong C.Y. Park J.H. Seo K.H. Kim J.M. Im S.Y. Lee J.W. Choi H.S. Lee K. Expression of MIS in the testis is down-regulated by tumor necrosis factor α through the negative regulation of SF-1 transactivation by NF-κB.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6000-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). NF-κB is also involved in the interleukin 1- and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)-mediated down-regulation of Sox9 expression in mouse chondrocytic cells (29Murakami S. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. Potent inhibition of the master chondrogenic factor Sox9 gene by interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3687-3692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Zebrafish embryos and larvae are dependent on a functional innate immune system at an early stage of development (≥1 days post fertilization (dpf)). This includes macrophage and neutrophil differentiation (30Meijer A.H. van der Sar A.M. Cunha C. Lamers G.E. Laplante M.A. Kikuta H. Bitter W. Becker T.S. Spaink H.P. Identification and real-time imaging of a myc-expressing neutrophil population involved in inflammation and mycobacterial granuloma formation in zebrafish.Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2008; 32: 36-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), indicating that the NF-κB signaling system is present and active before testis transformation. In addition, a study on goldfish has shown that TNFα inhibits testicular testosterone production (31Lister A. Van Der Kraak G. Modulation of goldfish testicular testosterone production in vitro by tumor necrosis factor a, interleukin-1β, and macrophage conditioned media.J. Exp. Zool. 2002; 292: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to investigate the possible role of NF-κB in zebrafish sex differentiation. Induction of the NF-κB signaling pathway resulted in up-regulation of inflammatory and anti-apoptotic genes, and this correlated to female-biased sex ratio. In contrast, inhibition of NF-κB resulted in an increased proportion of males. This study demonstrates the involvement of NF-κB signaling in the maintenance of ovarian development and the inhibition of the transformation of juvenile ovaries to adult testis. Adult zebrafish were maintained in a recirculating system (Aquaneering) with a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle. The fish were fed twice a day with newly hatched Artemia salina nauplii and commercial flake food (Tetrarubin). The male and female brooders were kept in separate aquaria at 26–27 °C, and they were allowed to breed once a week. The fish handling procedures were approved by the Swedish Ethical Committee in Linköping (Permit 32-10). E. coli MG1655 was grown on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar and incubated at 37 °C overnight. One colony was inoculated into 10 ml of LB broth and incubated on a shaker (200 rpm) at 37 °C overnight. The bacteria were then centrifuged and washed with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma). The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of PBS and killed by heating to 70 °C for 1 h. To ensure 100% bacteria death, 10 μl of the heat-killed suspension was plated and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The pGL4 plasmid with promoter-less Luciferase gene and neomycin selection marker was purchased from Promega, and the NFκB cis-element insert was obtained from commercially available pNFκB-Luc plasmid (BD Biosciences). The pGL4 luciferase plasmid and the pNFκB-Luc plasmid were cut with HindIII and KpnI (Fermentas) and gel-purified by using Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega). The NFκB cis-element and the pGL4 luciferase plasmid were ligated using T4 DNA ligase (Fermentas). ZFL cells were maintained at 28 °C and 3% CO2 in a humidified incubator in a complex media containing 50% L15 (Invitrogen), 35% DMEM-high glucose (PAA Laboratories), and 15% Ham's F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 15 mm Hepes buffer (Lonza), 0.15 g/liter sodium bicarbonate (Biochrom AG), 50 ng/ml mouse EGF, and 0.01 mg/ml bovine insulin. For stable transfection, ZFL cells were plated in 24-well plates (BD Biosciences) (80,000 cells/well). The next day the cells were transfected with the NFκB-pGL4 plasmid (500 ng/well) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 48 h the cells were treated with 1 mg/ml G418 antibiotic (Duchefa Biochemie). Antibiotic-resistant colonies were selected, and the cells were screened for NFκB activity using the Luciferase assay kit (Promega). Before exposure the stably transfected ZFL cells (nZFL) were plated in 24-well plates (80,000 cells/well) and incubated for 16–18 h at 28 °C and 3% CO2. Wild type ZFL cells were plated in 12-well plates (BD Biosciences) (2 × 105 cells/well) and incubated for 16–18 h at 28 °C and 3% CO2. The experiments were started by adding heat-killed bacteria at 5 × 106, 1 × 107, 5 × 107, or 1 × 108 colony forming units (cfu)/ml, sodium deoxycholate (DOC) at 200 or 300 μm (Sigma), or 40 nm NF-κB activation inhibitor (NAI) (Calbiochem) prepared in fresh media to the cells. The cells were incubated for 12 h (Luciferase assays) or 24 h (quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays) at 28 °C and 3% CO2. Detection of luciferase activity was performed using Luciferase assay kit, whereas cells used for qRT-PCR analysis were lysed with TRI-Reagent (Sigma). In the evening, pairs of adult zebrafish brooders were transferred to mating containers (Aquaneering). The next morning fertilized embryos were collected and divided in groups of 50 in 115-mm diameter crystallization dishes containing 100 ml of water and maintained at 28 °C. At 4 dpf, the juveniles were transferred to the circulating system. The water flow was adjusted to 20–30 drops/min, 14-h light/10-h dark cycle and fed twice with newly hatched A. salina nauplii and commercial flake food (Larval AP 100). At the time of exposure, juvenile zebrafish were transferred back to crystallization dishes of 115-mm diameter with 100 ml of water (15 or 20 dpf) or 1-liter containers (180/100 mm) with 500 ml of water (41 or 70 dpf) with 20 individuals in each container. The juveniles were exposed to heat-killed E. coli (1× 106, 5 × 106, 1× 107, 5 × 107), DOC (200 μm), or NAI (20 nm). The fish were fed twice a day, and 50% of the water was changed every third day and heat-killed E. coli, DOC, or NAI was replenished to maintain the original concentrations. The water quality was monitored over the course of studies. The temperature was maintained at 25 ± 0.2 °C. Water pH averaged 7.3 ± 0.2, and salinity averaged 0.08 ± 0.01%. The nitrite level averaged 0.04 ± 0.05 mg/liter, whereas nitrate and ammonia level remained undetectable. Survival through the experimental exposures averaged 85 ± 5%. There was no effect of the different treatments on these parameters. The exposures were terminated at different time points depending on the experiment and assay. For sample collection at 21 dpf, zebrafish juveniles were sacrificed by snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until further use. Juveniles of 35, 42, and 71 dpf of age were dissected under a stereomicroscope, and their gonads were isolated, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until further use. For sex ratio determination, the fishes were transferred back to the circulating system at the end of exposure (at 35 dpf), and the sex ratios were determined after dissection and microscopic observation of the gonads at 70 dpf. Cells, juvenile zebrafish, and isolated gonads were homogenized in 200 μl Trizol Reagent (Sigma) and RNA was isolated according to manufacturer's instruction. cDNA synthesis was performed using qScript cDNA synthesis kit (Quanta Biosciences). Primers were designed for listed genes (supplemental Table S1). SYBR Green (Quanta) was used to determine the expression levels of all genes. Thermocycling conditions for SYBR Green consisted of a denaturation step for 5 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 2 s and 60 °C for 30 s. Data analysis was performed using standard curve method and ΔΔCt method (32Schmittgen T.D. Livak K.J. Analyzing real-time PCR data by the comparative CT method.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (17381) Google Scholar). The gonads of 35 dpf juvenile zebrafish were isolated, and RNA was extracted from individual samples using TRIzol reagent according to manufacturer's instruction. Amplification and labeling of total RNA was performed as described previously (33Sreenivasan R. Cai M. Bartfai R. Wang X. Christoffels A. Orban L. Transcriptomic analyses reveal novel genes with sexually dimorphic expression in the zebrafish gonad and brain.PLoS One. 2008; 3: e1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) with the following modifications; 5 μg of antisense RNA was labeled with Alexa Fluor 647, whereas 20 μg of a common reference consisting of pooled antisense RNA from one individual in each treatment group (a total of 4 individuals) was labeled with Alexa Fluor 555. Microarray printing, hybridization, scanning, and data processing were performed as described previously (33Sreenivasan R. Cai M. Bartfai R. Wang X. Christoffels A. Orban L. Transcriptomic analyses reveal novel genes with sexually dimorphic expression in the zebrafish gonad and brain.PLoS One. 2008; 3: e1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A total of 11 samples were analyzed: 6 control individuals, 3 individuals from the intermediate treatment, and 2 individuals from the highest treatment dose. Raw expression values obtained from the GenePix Pro 6.0 software were background-corrected and normalized using R 2.9.0 (34Ihaka R. Gentleman R. R: A language for data analysis and graphics.J. Comput. Graph. Stat. 1996; 5: 299-314Google Scholar) and the BioC limma 2.18.2 package (35Smyth G.K. Linear models and empirical bayes methods for assessing differential expression in microarray experiments.Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol. Biol. 2004; 3: 3Crossref Scopus (9172) Google Scholar, 36Smyth G.K. Speed T. Normalization of cDNA microarray data.Methods. 2003; 31: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1485) Google Scholar). Briefly, array intensity values were background corrected using the normexp method (37Ritchie M.E. Silver J. Oshlack A. Holmes M. Diyagama D. Holloway A. Smyth G.K. A comparison of background correction methods for two-color microarrays.Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 2700-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) followed by print-tip loess normalization within arrays and quantile normalization between arrays. Differential expression was calculated by fitting a linear model to a group means parameterization. Multiple testing was corrected by controlling the false discovery rate (38Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. Controlling the false discovery rate. A practical and powerful approach to multiple testing.J. R. Stat. Soc. B. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar). Principal component analysis of the normalized expression values was conducted in R using the prcomp function. The gene symbol and putative function for each EST sequence was obtained based on the best zebrafish BLAST hit against the RefSeq RNA database (as of April 12, 2011) unless indicated otherwise. The full set of microarray expression data has been deposited in ArrayExpress under the accession number E-MEXP-3249. Adult zebrafish were euthanized, and their testes were isolated. The testes were sterilized with 0.5% v/v commercial bleach in PBS (Sigma) for 2 min and washed 3 times in PBS. The testes were transferred to 24-well plate (BD Biosciences) and maintained at 28 °C and 3% CO2 in a humidified incubator in ZFL cell media containing antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Invitrogen). The explants were cultured in parallel and exposed to heat-killed bacteria (5 × 107), DOC (200 μm), and NAI (20 nm) for 24 h. The ovary samples from 71 dpf individuals were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% DOC, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Protein content was quantified using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad), and 30 μg of each sample was resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was incubated for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween to prevent nonspecific binding and probed with anti-caspase 3a antibody (AnaSpec) at 1:1000 dilution overnight. The HRP-conjugated anti rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) was used at a 1:3000 dilution for 1 h, and the immunoreactive complex was detected by Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific). The membrane was then stripped and probed for β-actin using mouse anti β-actin antibody (Sigma) at a 1:5000 dilution. The HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) was used at 1:3000 dilution for 1 h. The bands were quantified using the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) and normalized with their respective β-actin level. Statistical significance were determined using a two-tailed non-paired Student's t test for two-group comparison or one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett post test for multiple group comparison, and differences were considered significant if the p values were <0.05 (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software). ZFL cells stably transfected with the NF-κB-pGL4 vector (nZFL) were exposed to heat-killed E. coli to determine whether this would result in activation of NF-κB. A dose-dependent activation of NF-κB was observed after exposure of nZFL cells to heat-killed E. coli (Fig. 1A). The qPCR analysis also showed up-regulation of inflammatory genes like p65, p50, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2a (ptgs2a), interleukin 8 (il8), and tumor necrosis factor a (tnfa) in response to heat-killed E. coli after exposure of ZFL cells (Fig. 1, B–F). Zebrafish juveniles are known to enter a juvenile ovary stage between 14 and 28 dpf (14Takahashi H. Juvenile Hermaphroditism in the Zebrafish, Brachydanio rerio.Bull. Fac. Fish.

The timing and extent of “juvenile ovary” phase are highly variable during zebrafish testis differentiation.J. Fish Biol. 2007; 70: 33-44Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This transition was indicated by the elevated levels of female-specific zona pellucida (zp2) gene at 19 dpf (Fig. 2A). Based on this information, all the exposures were started before or at the time of entry into the juvenile ovary stage. Exposure to heat-killed bacteria from 15 to 21 dpf resulted in dose-dependent up-regulation of the zp2 gene expression and showed a bell-shaped curve with no effect at the highest dose (Fig. 2B). Next, zebrafish juveniles were exposed to 1 × 107 cfu/ml heat-killed bacteria for 24 h at 20 dpf to determine whether this would result in in vivo up-regulation of NF-κB. The tran"
https://openalex.org/W1972383046,"Sustained urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) expression is detected in aggressive breast tumors. Although uPA can be transiently upregulated by diverse extracellular stimuli, sustained, but not transiently upregulated uPA expression contributes to breast cancer invasion/metastasis. Unfortunately, how sustained uPA expression is achieved in invasive/metastatic breast cancer cells is unknown. Here, we show that sustained and transiently upregulated uPA expression are regulated by distinct mechanisms. Using a collection of transcription factor-targeted small-interfering RNAs, we discovered that interleukin enhancer-binding factor 3 (ILF3) is required for sustained uPA expression. Two discrete mechanisms mediate ILF3 action. The first is that ILF3 activates uPA transcription by binding to the CTGTT sequence in the nucleotides -1004∼-1000 of the uPA promoter; the second is that ILF3 inhibits the processing of uPA mRNA-targeting primary microRNAs (pri-miRNAs). Knockdown of ILF3 led to significant reduction in in vitro cell growth/migration/invasion and in vivo breast tumor development. Importantly, immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that nuclear ILF3, but not cytoplasmic ILF3 staining correlates with elevated uPA level and higher grades of human breast tumor specimens. Nuclear localization of ILF3 highlights the role of ILF3 in sustained uPA expression as a transcription activator and pri-miRNA processing blocker. In conclusion, this study shows that ILF3 promotes breast tumorigenicity by regulating sustained uPA expression."
https://openalex.org/W2073297535,"Integration of cellular signaling pathways with androgen receptor (AR) signaling can be achieved through phosphorylation of AR by cellular kinases. However, the kinases responsible for phosphorylating the AR at numerous sites and the functional consequences of AR phosphorylation are only partially understood. Bioinformatic analysis revealed AR serine 213 (S213) as a putative substrate for PIM1, a kinase overexpressed in prostate cancer. Therefore, phosphorylation of AR serine 213 by PIM1 was examined using a phosphorylation site-specific antibody. Wild-type PIM1, but not catalytically inactive PIM1, specifically phosphorylated AR but not an AR serine-to-alanine mutant (S213A). In vitro kinase assays confirmed that PIM1 can phosphorylate AR S213 in a ligand-independent manner and cell type-specific phosphorylation was observed in prostate cancer cell lines. Upon PIM1 overexpression, AR phosphorylation was observed in the absence of hormone and was further increased in the presence of hormone in LNCaP, LNCaP-abl and VCaP cells. Moreover, phosphorylation of AR was reduced in the presence of PIM kinase inhibitors. An examination of AR-mediated transcription showed that reporter gene activity was reduced in the presence of PIM1 and wild-type AR, but not S213A mutant AR. Androgen-mediated transcription of endogenous PSA, Nkx3.1 and IGFBP5 was also decreased in the presence of PIM1, whereas IL6, cyclin A1 and caveolin 2 were increased. Immunohistochemical analysis of prostate cancer tissue microarrays showed significant P-AR S213 expression that was associated with hormone refractory prostate cancers, likely identifying cells with catalytically active PIM1. In addition, prostate cancers expressing a high level of P-AR S213 were twice as likely to be from biochemically recurrent cancers. Thus, AR phosphorylation by PIM1 at S213 impacts gene transcription and is highly prevalent in aggressive prostate cancer."

Y., Matsumoto, N., Hirabayashi, J., and Yamamoto, K. (2011) Mol. Biol. Cell 22, 3559–3570). The sugar binding activity of malectin is required for this process. However, because G2M9 N-glycans are generated at the very early stage of processing and are typically found on both misfolded glycoproteins and glycoproteins undergoing folding, other mechanisms must underlie the preference of malectin for misfolded glycoproteins. Here, we searched for proteins that were co-immunoprecipitated with malectin, and we found that malectin formed a stable complex with an endoplasmic reticulum-resident transmembrane protein, ribophorin I. Co-expression of malectin and ribophorin I significantly enhanced the association between malectin and a folding-defective α1-antitrypsin variant (null Hong Kong) and reduced its secretion; however, secretion of wild-type α1-antitrypsin was not affected. The enhanced association and reduced secretion were counteracted by siRNA-mediated down-regulation of ribophorin I. Also, a reporter assay revealed that ribophorin I preferentially interacted with misfolded ribonuclease A but not with the native form, suggesting that ribophorin I may function as a chaperone that recognizes misfolded proteins inside cells. These results provide the first evidence of the mechanism by which malectin preferentially associates with misfolded glycoproteins.

https://openalex.org/W1981948280,"Deguelin is known to suppress the growth of cancer cells; however, its anti-metastatic effects have not been studied so far in any cancer model. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the anti-metastatic potential of deguelin in vivo and in tumor growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1)-stimulated cells. Our results demonstrate that tumor growth, peritoneal dissemination and liver/lung metastasis of orthotopically implanted PanC-1-luc cells were significantly reduced in deguelin-treated mice along with the induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, deguelin-treated tumors showed increased epithelial signature such as increased expression of E-Cadherin and cytokeratin-18 and decreased expression of Snail. Similar observations were made when PanC-1, COLO-357 and L3.6pl cells were treated in vitro with deguelin. Moreover, E-cadherin was transcriptionally upregulated and accumulated in the membrane fraction of deguelin-treated cells, as indicated by increased interaction of E-Cadherin with β-catenin. TGFβ1-induced downregulation of E-Cadherin and upregulation of Snail were abrogated by deguelin treatment. In addition, deguelin inhibited TGFβ1-induced Smad3 phosphorylation and Smad4 nuclear translocation in PanC-1 cells. Furthermore, when TGFβ1-induced nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) activation was inhibited, TGFβ1-induced Snail upregulation or E-Cadherin downregulation was blocked. Deguelin also significantly downregulated the constitutive phosphorylation and DNA binding of NFκB in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, overexpression of either NFκB or Snail completely abrogated deguelin-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) inhibition, whereas overexpression of NFκB but not Snail rescued cells from deguelin-induced apoptosis. Hence, deguelin targets NFκB to induce reversal of EMT and apoptosis but downstream effectors might be different for both processes. Taken together, our results suggest that deguelin suppresses both pancreatic tumor growth and metastasis by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting EMT."
https://openalex.org/W2056159891,"The signaling pathway mediated by BMPs plays an essential role during development as well as the maintenance of homeostasis in adult. Aberrant activation or inactivation of BMP signaling can lead to developmental defects and various human disorders. To fine-tune its activity, BMP signaling is regulated both positively and negatively by extrinsic and intrinsic regulatory factors that modulate binding of ligand to the receptors, and the activity of receptors and their dedicated signal transducers, the Smad proteins. Upon BMP binding to the receptor complex, Smad proteins translocate to the nucleus and modulate gene expression transcriptionally by directly associating with the promoter region of target genes, or post-transcriptionally through modulation of microRNA (miRNA) synthesis. In this study, we demonstrate that BMP signaling down-regulates transcription of the miRNA-302∼367 gene cluster. We show that the type II BMP receptor (BMPRII) is a novel target of miR-302. Upon overexpression, miR-302 targets a partially complementary sequence localized in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of BMPRII transcripts and leads to destabilization of the transcripts and down-regulation of BMP signaling. We propose that the negative regulatory loop of BMP4-miR-302-BMPRII is a potential mechanism for the maintenance and fine-tuning of the BMP signaling pathway in various systems."

This understanding could lead to a new approach to regulate the glycemic response and glucose-related physiologic responses in the human body. There are six digestive enzymes for starch: salivary and pancreatic α-amylases and four mucosal α-glucosidases, including N- and C-terminal subunits of both maltase-glucoamylase and sucrase-isomaltase. Only the mucosal α-glucosidases provide the final hydrolytic activities to produce substantial free glucose. We report here the unique and shared roles of the individual α-glucosidases for α-glucans persisting after starch is extensively hydrolyzed by α-amylase (to produce α-limit dextrins (α-LDx)). All four α-glucosidases share digestion of linear regions of α-LDx, and three can hydrolyze branched fractions. The α-LDx, which were derived from different maize cultivars, were not all equally digested, revealing that the starch source influences glucose generation at the mucosal α-glucosidase level. We further discovered a fraction of α-LDx that was resistant to the extensive digestion by the mucosal α-glucosidases.

https://openalex.org/W1986264056,"Erythrocyte-binding antigen 140 (PfEBA-140) is a critical Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte invasion ligand that engages glycophorin C on host erythrocytes during malaria infection. The minimal receptor-binding region of PfEBA-140 contains two conserved Duffy binding-like (DBL) domains, a fold unique to Plasmodium species. Here, we present the crystal structure of the receptor-binding region of PfEBA-140 at 2.4 Å resolution. The two-domain binding region is present as a monomer in the asymmetric unit, and the structure reveals novel features in PfEBA-140 that are likely determinants of receptor specificity. Analysis by small-angle x-ray scattering demonstrated that the minimal binding region is monomeric in solution, consistent with the crystal structure. Erythrocyte binding assays showed that the full-length binding region containing the tandem DBL domains is required for erythrocyte engagement, suggesting that both domains contain critical receptor contact sites. The electrostatic surface of PfEBA-140 elucidates a basic patch that constitutes a putative high-affinity binding interface spanning both DBL domains. Mutation of residues within this interface results in severely diminished erythrocyte binding. This study provides insight into the structural basis and mechanism of PfEBA-140 receptor engagement and forms a basis for future studies of this critical interaction. In addition, the solution and crystal structures allow the first identification of likely determinants of erythrocyte receptor specificity for P. falciparum invasion ligands. A complete understanding of the PfEBA-140 erythrocyte invasion pathway will aid in the design of invasion inhibitory therapeutics and vaccines."

The phosphotyrosine-binding F3 subdomain of the Talin FERM domain has been shown to bind to an NPXY motif in the cytoplasmic tails of the integrin β-subunit, eliciting the activation of integrins to a high affinity state (17Anthis N.J.

Thus, as currently understood, intracellular integrin activation involves both Talin and one of the Kindlins. Whether Talin and Kindlin bind together or separately to the β-tails had been unclear, but evidence that Kindlin-2 forms a ternary complex with β3 integrin tails and the Talin head domain has been found recently (24Bledzka K.

There are good structural data showing that Talin recognizes a conserved (“membrane proximal”) NPXY motif close to the transmembrane region of the integrin cytoplasmic tail (17Anthis N.J.

There is no structural information about Kindlin-integrin interactions, but mutational and functional studies indicate that Kindlins bind to a second (“membrane distal”) conserved NPXY motif (19Harburger D.S. Bouaouina M. Calderwood D.A. Kindlin-1 and -2 directly bind the C-terminal region of β-integrin cytoplasmic tails and exert integrin-specific activation effects.J. Biol.

Mutational and biochemical analyses have also suggested that a Ser/Thr-rich region between the two NPXY motifs is critical for Kindlin binding to the β-integrin cytoplasmic tails; this is exemplified by a specific β3 integrin S732P mutation that causes Glanzmann thrombasthenia in humans (13Moser M.

Here, we describe the expression, using a baculovirus-driven system, of recombinant Kindlin-3 in sufficient quantities to perform a biophysical characterization of the full-length protein. The three-dimensional arrangement of the domains within Kindlin-3 was investigated at low resolution using small-angle x-ray scattering in solution. Ab initio envelopes from small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) together with other shape estimates in solution reveal that Kindlin-3 is elongated and conformationally similar to Talin but with the prominent addition of the PH domain. Kindlin-3 is also shown to form a ternary complex with the Talin head region and integrin β-tails. Induced changes in NMR spectra show that Kindlin-3 binds directly to the membrane-distal NPXY motif and that the preceding Ser/Thr contributes to this binding. KINLDIN3 cDNA (a kind gift from R. Fässler, Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany) was amplified using primers 5′-aggagatataccatgATGGCGGGTATGAAGACAGC-3′ and 5′-gtgatggtgatgtttGAAGGCCTCATGGCCTCC-3′ and subsequently cloned into the pOPINE vector (27Berrow N.S. Alderton D. Sainsbury S. Nettleship J. Assenberg R. Rahman N. Stuart D.I. Owens R.J. A versatile ligation-independent cloning method suitable for high-throughput expression screening applications.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) encoding a C-terminal hexahistidine tag using the In-fusion enzyme system (Clontech). Plasmid DNA was sequence-verified (Geneservice, Ltd., Oxford, United Kingdom) and purified using standard methods. Baculovirus generation and insect cell culture maintenance were carried out using standard protocols (28Merrington C.L. Bailey M.J. Possee R.D. Manipulation of baculovirus vectors.Mol. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 283-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, insect cells (Spodoptera frugiperda) were co-transfected with recombinant transfer vector, and linearized viral DNA was cultured in Sf900II serum-free media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 μg/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Virus-containing supernatant was harvested between 6 and 7 days after transfection. Virus was amplified prior to expression using standard methods with a multiplicity of infection of ∼0.1. Kindlin-3 expression was achieved by infecting suspension cultures of Sf9 cells in Sf900II supplemented with 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1% FCS with amplified recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 1. Infected cells were harvested 72 h post-infection by centrifugation (1000 × g) and stored at −20 °C (or −80 °C for long-term storage). Frozen baculovirus-infected insect cell pellets expressing recombinant Kindlin-3 were thawed and resuspended with 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 1% (v/v) Tween-20 supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) on ice prior to purification. Complete cell lysis was achieved by incubating the resuspension with the detergent. The recombinant protein was purified using three chromatographic steps after the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with precharged and equilibrated nickel-Sepharose for 1–2 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected and washed using the batch method; 10 bed volumes of 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole buffer were used to wash the beads. The protein was eluted and collected using 1–3 bed volumes of 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.45, and 500 mm NaCl, and 500 mm imidazole. The protein composition of the eluant was assessed by SDS-PAGE and, in the first instance, Western blotting using an anti-His5 antibody. The eluant containing Kindlin-3 was pooled and buffer-exchanged into 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl via a series of dilutions into buffer, and the sample was concentrated using a centrifuge protein concentrator (Millipore) with a 50-kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO). The buffer-exchanged protein solution was applied onto a pre-equilibrated HiTrap heparin HP column (5 ml column volume, GE Healthcare). The protein that bound to the column was eluted using a linear NaCl gradient in the same buffer that increased from 200 mm to 1 m NaCl at a rate of 10 mm/ml. The protein composition of the fractionated eluant was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, and those containing Kindlin-3 were pooled and concentrated using a centrifuge protein concentrator (Millipore) with a 50-kDa MWCO to 0.5 ml-2 ml sample size. Finally, the concentrated protein was polished and buffer-exchanged using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). The protein was injected onto a pre-equilibrated Superdex S200 (16/60) or (10/30) (GE Healthcare) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT at a rate of 1 ml/min. The eluant from the column was fractionated into 1-ml samples, and the protein elution was monitored using absorbance at 280 nm. The fractions corresponding to a single absorbance peak that resulted from SEC were assessed by SDS-PAGE to determine homogeneity. The purified Kindlin-3 was assessed as >95% pure after this step. The protein was concentrated using a centrifuge protein concentrator (Millipore) with a 50-kDa MWCO to ∼15 mg/ml in the gel filtration buffer, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until used. The protein concentration was assessed spectroscopically using a calculated extinction coefficient (ϵ) of 109,320 m−1 cm−1 (assuming all Cys residues were reduced). Full-length Kindlin-3 was expressed and purified as described above. The C-terminal His6 tag was removed prior to size-exclusion chromatography by incubating the purified Kindlin-3 with carboxypeptidaseA-agarose (Sigma) at room temperature for 4 h. Kindlin-3 samples were prepared in buffer at pH 6.1 (10 mm bis-Tris, pH 6.1, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT) or at pH 7.0 (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, and 2 mm TCEP). Full-length β-integrin tails were prepared as reported earlier for the β3 tail (29Oxley C.L. Anthis N.J. Lowe E.D. Vakonakis I. Campbell I.D. Wegener K.L. An integrin phosphorylation switch: the effect of β3 integrin tail phosphorylation on Dok1 and Talin binding.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5420-5426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). 15N-Labeled tails were expressed in Escherichia coli grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 15NH4Cl. The tails were purified under denaturing conditions (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 8 m urea, and 0.035% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0) by Talon immobilized metal affinity chromatography (Clontech), eluting the polyhistidine-tagged integrin tail in 200 mm imidazole. Further purification was performed by C18 reverse phase HPLC using a 5–70% acetonitrile gradient. The polyhistidine tag was removed by overnight cleavage at 4 °C with 3C protease, and the cleaved tails were then purified again by C18 reverse phase HPLC. AUC was carried out using a Beckman (Palo Alto, CA) Optima XL-I AUC operating in velocity mode, initially with 12-mm sector-shaped centerpieces. Data were collected using 280 nm absorbance optics at a speed of 40,000 rpm with one scan taken every 6 min for a total of 60 scans. The sixth to 30th scans were determined as providing the best resolution of the sedimenting species using initial analyses in SedFit software (30Brown P.H. Schuck P. Macromolecular size-and-shape distributions by sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation.Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 4651-4661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), and the data were analyzed using the c(s,f/f0) method whereby the distribution of apparent sedimentation coefficients shown by the sample is plotted over a third dimension, the population of species with diffusion coefficients of specific magnitudes as influenced by the frictional ratio of the species. For the initial study of isolated Kindlin-3, a resolution in s of 100 was used and a resolution in f/f0 of 10. For subsequent studies of mixtures of Kindlin-3, Talin head, and integrin β1A tails, 3-mm path-length cells, the 11th to 60th data scans, and a resolution of s = 50 were used. SedFit was also used to compute the hydrodynamic radius, frictional coefficient, and axial ellipsoidal ratio from the AUC data. The frictional coefficient is a unitless quantity that is the ratio between the theoretical behavior of a species, given its weight, partial specific volume, and the experimental conditions, and its actual sedimentation behavior. Plots presented as generated using ProFit software (Uetikon am See, Switzerland) were fitted with a Gaussian function to determine peak centers (which are the species sedimentation coefficients) and peak variances (which are proportional to the diffusion coefficient of the species). All samples were in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl. Dynamic light scattering measurements were conducted on a Protein Solutions DynaPro instrument at 22 °C. Approximately 1 μg of protein was diluted in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min before being placed in the cuvette. SAXS data were collected at EMBL beamline X33 at the DORIS III storage ring, DESY (Hamburg, Germany) (31Roessle M.W. Klaering R. Ristau U. Robrahn B. Jahn D. Gehrmann T. Konarev P. Round A.

Crystallogr. 2007; 40: S190-S194Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The measurements were carried out at 288 K in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm DTT. A MAR345 image plate at a sample detector distance of 2.43 m and wavelength λ of 0.93 Å, covering the momentum transfer range 0.04 < Q < 5.1 nm-1 (Q = 4π sin(θ)/λ where 2θ is the scattering angle), was used. The data were processed using standard procedures by the program package PRIMUS (32Konarev P. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H. Svergun D.I. A Windows PC-based system for small-angle scattering data analysis.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2351) Google Scholar). SAXS data sets for Kindlin-3 were collected at the following concentrations: 8.7, 4.35, 2.18, and 1.09 mg/ml. The reduced, rotationally averaged SAXS profiles were analyzed using the program GNOM (33Svergun D.I. Determination of the regularization parameter in indirect-transform methods using perceptual criteria.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2961) Google Scholar). A series of alternative possible maximum dimensions for Kindlin-3 were used to locate a Dmax defined by the data, which also showed a good fit to the experimental scattering curve. Distance distribution functions p(r) were then used to calculate reconstituted models ab initio with the program GASBOR (34Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Determination of domain structure of proteins from X-ray solution scattering.Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Models calculated starting from the premise of an unknown overall shape were consistently elongated, prolate structures, and therefore a prolate assumption was used in calculating the structures presented. For those samples showing no or limited intermolecular scattering (the two lowest concentrations), 20 models were calculated ab initio each time, and then they were sorted in pairwise groups of 10, aligned, averaged, and trimmed to a consensus core structure using the DAMAVER package (35Volkov V.V.

This produced two independent scattering bead models from each data set, which were then aligned to each other in CHIMERA (36Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M.

https://openalex.org/W2054283483,"Several studies support an association between the chronic inflammatory diseases periodontitis and atherosclerosis with a crucial role for the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis. However, the interplay between this pathogen and the adaptive immune system, including T-cells, is sparsely investigated. Here we used Jurkat T-cells to determine the effects of P. gingivalis on T-cell-mediated adaptive immune responses. We show that viable P. gingivalis targets IL-2 expression at the protein level. Initial cellular events, including ROS production and [Ca2+]i, were elevated in response to P. gingivalis, but AP-1 and NF-κB activity dropped below basal levels and T-cells were unable to sustain stable IL-2 accumulation. IL-2 was partially restored by Leupeptin, but not by Cathepsin B Inhibitor, indicating an involvement of Rgp proteinases in the suppression of IL-2 accumulation. This was further confirmed by purified Rgp that caused a dose-dependent decrease in IL-2 levels. These results provide new insights of how this periodontal pathogen evades the host adaptive immune system by inhibiting IL-2 accumulation and thus attenuating T-cell proliferation and cellular communication."
https://openalex.org/W2089536861,"Aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) catalyzes the bioactivation of nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate, GTN) in blood vessels, resulting in vasodilation by nitric oxide (NO) or a related species. Because the mechanism of this reaction is still unclear we determined the three-dimensional structures of wild-type (WT) ALDH2 and of a triple mutant of the protein that exhibits low denitration activity (E268Q/C301S/C303S) in complex with GTN. The structure of the triple mutant showed that GTN binds to the active site via polar contacts to the oxyanion hole and to residues 268 and 301 as well as by van der Waals interactions to hydrophobic residues of the catalytic pocket. The structure of the GTN-soaked wild-type protein revealed a thionitrate adduct to Cys-302 as the first reaction intermediate, which was also found by mass spectrometry (MS) experiments. In addition, the MS data identified sulfinic acid as the irreversibly inactivated enzyme species. Assuming that the structures of the triple mutant and wild-type ALDH2 reflect binding of GTN to the catalytic site and the first reaction step, respectively, superposition of the two structures indicates that denitration of GTN is initiated by nucleophilic attack of Cys-302 at one of the terminal nitrate groups, resulting in formation of the observed thionitrate intermediate and release of 1,2-glyceryl dinitrate. Our results shed light on the molecular mechanism of the GTN denitration reaction and provide useful information on the structural requirements for high affinity binding of organic nitrates to the catalytic site of ALDH2."
https://openalex.org/W2092422722,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a nutrient- and metabolic stress-sensing enzyme activated by the tumor suppressor kinase, LKB1. Because macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and its functional homolog, d-dopachrome tautomerase (d-DT), have protumorigenic functions in non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) but have AMPK-activating properties in nonmalignant cell types, we set out to investigate this apparent paradox. Our data now suggest that, in contrast to MIF and d-DTs AMPK-activating properties in nontransformed cells, MIF and d-DT act cooperatively to inhibit steady-state phosphorylation and activation of AMPK in LKB1 wild type and LKB1 mutant human NSCLC cell lines. Our data further indicate that MIF and d-DT, acting through their shared cell surface receptor, CD74, antagonize NSCLC AMPK activation by maintaining glucose uptake, ATP production, and redox balance, resulting in reduced Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase β-dependent AMPK activation. Combined, these studies indicate that MIF and d-DT cooperate to inhibit AMPK activation in an LKB1-independent manner."

https://openalex.org/W2082251107,"The Escherichia coli O9a and O8 polymannose O-polysaccharides (O-PSs) serve as model systems for the biosynthesis of bacterial polysaccharides by ATP-binding cassette transporter-dependent pathways. Both O-PSs contain a conserved primer-adaptor domain at the reducing terminus and a serotype-specific repeat unit domain. The repeat unit domain is polymerized by the serotype-specific WbdA mannosyltransferase. In serotype O9a, WbdA is a bifunctional α-(1→2)-, α-(1→3)-mannosyltransferase, and its counterpart in serotype O8 is trifunctional (α-(1→2), α-(1→3), and β-(1→2)). Little is known about the detailed structures or mechanisms of action of the WbdA polymerases, and here we establish that they are multidomain enzymes. WbdAO9a contains two separable and functionally active domains, whereas WbdAO8 possesses three. In WbdCO9a and WbdBO9a, substitution of the first Glu of the EX7E motif had detrimental effects on the enzyme activity, whereas substitution of the second had no significant effect on activity in vivo. Mutation of the Glu residues in the EX7E motif of the N-terminal WbdAO9a domain resulted in WbdA variants unable to synthesize O-PS. In contrast, mutation of the Glu residues in the motif of the C-terminal WbdAO9a domain generated an enzyme capable of synthesizing an altered O-PS repeat unit consisting of only α-(1→2) linkages. In vitro assays with synthetic acceptors unequivocally confirmed that the N-terminal domain of WbdAO9a possesses α-(1→2)-mannosyltransferase activity. Together, these studies form a framework for detailed structure-function studies on individual domains and a strategy applicable for dissection and analysis of other multidomain glycosyltransferases. The Escherichia coli O9a and O8 polymannose O-polysaccharides (O-PSs) serve as model systems for the biosynthesis of bacterial polysaccharides by ATP-binding cassette transporter-dependent pathways. Both O-PSs contain a conserved primer-adaptor domain at the reducing terminus and a serotype-specific repeat unit domain. The repeat unit domain is polymerized by the serotype-specific WbdA mannosyltransferase. In serotype O9a, WbdA is a bifunctional α-(1→2)-, α-(1→3)-mannosyltransferase, and its counterpart in serotype O8 is trifunctional (α-(1→2), α-(1→3), and β-(1→2)). Little is known about the detailed structures or mechanisms of action of the WbdA polymerases, and here we establish that they are multidomain enzymes. WbdAO9a contains two separable and functionally active domains, whereas WbdAO8 possesses three. In WbdCO9a and WbdBO9a, substitution of the first Glu of the EX7E motif had detrimental effects on the enzyme activity, whereas substitution of the second had no significant effect on activity in vivo. Mutation of the Glu residues in the EX7E motif of the N-terminal WbdAO9a domain resulted in WbdA variants unable to synthesize O-PS. In contrast, mutation of the Glu residues in the motif of the C-terminal WbdAO9a domain generated an enzyme capable of synthesizing an altered O-PS repeat unit consisting of only α-(1→2) linkages. In vitro assays with synthetic acceptors unequivocally confirmed that the N-terminal domain of WbdAO9a possesses α-(1→2)-mannosyltransferase activity. Together, these studies form a framework for detailed structure-function studies on individual domains and a strategy applicable for dissection and analysis of other multidomain glycosyltransferases."
https://openalex.org/W2096977686,"The mechanisms regulating breast cancer differentiation state are poorly understood. Of particular interest are molecular regulators controlling the highly aggressive and poorly differentiated traits of basal-like breast carcinomas. Here we show that the Polycomb factor EZH2 maintains the differentiation state of basal-like breast cancer cells, and promotes the expression of progenitor-associated and basal-lineage genes. Specifically, EZH2 regulates the composition of basal-like breast cancer cell populations by promoting a ‘bi-lineage’ differentiation state, in which cells co-express basal- and luminal-lineage markers. We show that human basal-like breast cancers contain a subpopulation of bi-lineage cells, and that EZH2-deficient cells give rise to tumors with a decreased proportion of such cells. Bi-lineage cells express genes that are active in normal luminal progenitors, and possess increased colony-formation capacity, consistent with a primitive differentiation state. We found that GATA3, a driver of luminal differentiation, performs a function opposite to EZH2, acting to suppress bi-lineage identity and luminal-progenitor gene expression. GATA3 levels increase upon EZH2 silencing, mediating a decrease in bi-lineage cell numbers. Our findings reveal a novel role for EZH2 in controlling basal-like breast cancer differentiation state and intra-tumoral cell composition."
https://openalex.org/W2030908980,"Background/Aims Dietary supplementation with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) has been proven to minimize intestinal damage and facilitate regeneration after mucosal injury. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of oral TGF-β2 supplementation on intestinal structural changes, enterocyte proliferation and apoptosis following methotrexate (MTX)-induced intestinal damage in a rat and in a cell culture model. Methods Caco-2 cells were treated with MTX and were incubated with increasing concentrations of TGF-β2. Cell apoptosis was assessed using FACS analysis by annexin staining and cell viability was monitored using Trypan Blue assay. Male rats were divided into four experimental groups: Control rats, CONTR- TGF-β rats were treated with diet enriched with TGF-β2, MTX rats were treated with a single dose of methotrexate, and MTX- TGF-β rats were treated with diet enriched with TGF-β2. Intestinal mucosal damage, mucosal structural changes, enterocyte proliferation and enterocyte apoptosis were determined at sacrifice. Real Time PCR and Western blot were used to determine bax and bcl-2 mRNA, p-ERK, β-catenin, IL-1B and bax protein expression. Results Treatment of MTX-pretreated Caco-2 cells with TGF-B2 resulted in increased cell viability and decreased cell apoptosis. Treatment of MTX-rats with TGF-β2 resulted in a significant increase in bowel and mucosal weight, DNA and protein content, villus-height (ileum), crypt-depth (jejunum), decreased intestinal-injury score, decreased level of apoptosis and increased cell proliferation in jejunum and ileum compared to the untreated MTX group. MTX-TGF-β2 rats demonstrated a lower bax mRNA and protein levels as well as increased bcl-2 mRNA levels in jejunum and ileum compared to MTX group. Treatment with TGF-β2 also led to increased pERK, IL-1B and β-catenin protein levels in intestinal mucosa. Conclusions Treatment with TGF-β2 prevents mucosal-injury, enhances p-ERK and β-catenin induced enterocyte proliferation, inhibits enterocyte apoptosis and improves intestinal recovery following MTX-induced intestinal-mucositis in rats."
https://openalex.org/W2130583755,"Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most severe and irreversible side effects caused by treatment from several chemotherapeutic drugs, including paclitaxel (Taxol®) and vincristine. Strategies are needed that inhibit this unwanted side effect without altering the chemotherapeutic action of these drugs. We previously identified two proteins in the cellular pathway that lead to Taxol-induced peripheral neuropathy, neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) and calpain. Prolonged treatment with Taxol induces activation of calpain, degradation of NCS-1, and loss of intracellular calcium signaling. This paper has focused on understanding the molecular basis for prevention of peripheral neuropathy by testing the effects of addition of two candidate compounds to the existing chemotherapeutic drug regime: lithium and ibudilast. We found that the co-administration of either lithium or ibudilast to neuroblastoma cells that were treated with Taxol or vincristine inhibited activation of calpain and the reductions in NCS-1 levels and calcium signaling associated with these chemotherapeutic drugs. The ability of Taxol to alter microtubule formation was unchanged by the addition of either candidate compound. These results allow us to suggest that it is possible to prevent the unnecessary and irreversible damage caused by chemotherapeutic drugs while still maintaining therapeutic efficacy. Specifically, the addition of either lithium or ibudilast to existing chemotherapy treatment protocols has the potential to prevent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.

Specifically, the addition of either lithium or ibudilast to existing chemotherapy treatment protocols has the potential to prevent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Paclitaxel (Taxol) and vincristine are natural products that have potent chemotherapeutic action. Administration of these compounds causes an irreversible peripheral neuropathy in a high percent of patients, especially those administered a high dose of these compounds (1Hilkens P.H. ven den Bent M.J. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.J. Peripher. Nerv. Syst. 1997; 2: 350-361PubMed Google Scholar, 2Mielke S. Sparreboom A. Mross K. Peripheral neuropathy: a persisting challenge in paclitaxel-based regimens.Eur. J. Cancer. 2006; 42: 24-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although both of these drugs bind to tubulin, they are known to evoke opposite responses to microtubule stability. This difference suggests that the biochemical mechanism underlying peripheral neuropathy is independent of the microtubule changes associated with the chemotherapeutic ability of these drugs. In this way, preventative strategies or interventions against this unwanted side effect without altering the chemotherapeutic action should be possible. Taxanes, such as Taxol and docetaxel, are a group of chemotherapeutic drugs used for treating a number of types of cancer. Taxol is one of the most effective and commonly used treatment options for patients suffering from breast and ovarian cancer (3Spencer C.M. Faulds D. Paclitaxel: a review of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic potential in the treatment of cancer.Drugs. 1994; 48: 794-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 4Preston N.J. Paclitaxel (Taxol): a guide to administration.Eur. J. Cancer Care. 1996; 5: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The Taxol mechanism of action was first discovered in 1979 and is believed to work by enhancing the polymerization of tubulin to form stable microtubule polymers and essentially prevents depolymerization (5Schiff P.B. Fant J. Horwitz S.B. Promotion of microtubule assembly in vitro by Taxol.Nature. 1979; 277: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (3144) Google Scholar). Docetaxel has a similar mechanism of action and is believed to be more effective as a treatment for ovarian cancer because it has been found to preferentially accumulate in ovarian cancer cells (6Lyseng-Williamson K.A. Fenton C. Docetaxel: a review of its use in metastatic breast cancer.Drugs. 2005; 65: 2513-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 7Hennequin C. Giocanti N. Favaudon V. S-phase specificity of cell killing by docetaxel (Taxotere) in synchronised HeLa cells.Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 71: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Vincristine, another class of chemotherapeutic compounds, is also used to treat a variety of forms of cancer including Hodgkin disease (8Muthuraman A. Singh N. Jaggi A.S. Protective effect of Acorus calamus L. in rat model of vincristine-induced painful neuropathy: an evidence of anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activity.Food Chem. Toxicol. 2011; 49: 2557-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Its chemotherapeutic mechanism of action is believed to stem from its high binding affinity for several neuronal cytoskeletal proteins including β-tubulin, which then inhibits microtubule assembly. Although the disruption of microtubule polymerization caused by administration of vincristine is opposite to the effect of Taxol, which stabilizes microtubules, the administration of either compound is neurotoxic (8Muthuraman A. Singh N. Jaggi A.S. Protective effect of Acorus calamus L. in rat model of vincristine-induced painful neuropathy: an evidence of anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activity.Food Chem. Toxicol. 2011; 49: 2557-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Like Taxol, axonal degeneration has been found in animal models of vincristine (9Wang M.S. Davis A.A. Culver D.G. Wang Q.

NCS-1 is a member of a well known family of calcium-binding proteins possessing a high affinity (100 nm range) (13Philippov P.P. Koch K.W. Neuronal Calcium Sensor Proteins. Nova Science Publishers, 2006Google Scholar, 14Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. The neuronal calcium sensor family of Ca2+-binding proteins.Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), and it recently was identified as a Taxol-binding partner (10Boehmerle W. Splittgerber U. Lazarus M.B. McKenzie K.M. Johnston D.G. Austin D.J. Ehrlich B.E. Paclitaxel induces calcium oscillations via an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor and neuronal calcium sensor 1-dependent mechanism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 18356-18361Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). NCS-1 contains four EF hand calcium-binding domains of which three functionally bind calcium (14Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. The neuronal calcium sensor family of Ca2+-binding proteins.Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Addition of NCS-1 enhances intracellular calcium signaling through its interaction with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) and modulates the function of the InsP3R in a calcium-dependent manner (15Schlecker C. Boehmerle W. Jeromin A. DeGray B. Varshney A. Sharma Y. Szigeti-Buck K. Ehrlich B.E. Neuronal calcium sensor-1 enhancement of InsP3 receptor activity is inhibited by therapeutic levels of lithium.J.

Treatment with Taxol also activates calpain, a calcium-dependent enzyme, which cleaves a number of substrates, including NCS-1 (11Boehmerle W. Zhang K. Sivula M. Heidrich F.M. Lee Y. Jordt S.E.

The ability of small molecule inhibitors of calpain to protect Taxol-treated mice from developing peripheral neuropathy (9Wang M.S. Davis A.A. Culver D.G. Wang Q. Powers J.C. Glass J.D.

This paper has focused on the biochemical pathways used in inhibition and prevention of peripheral neuropathy by addition of candidate compounds to the existing chemotherapeutic drug regimen. The hypothesis is that it is possible to protect cells from unnecessary damage and maintain the therapeutic efficacy of Taxol because the cellular pathway for treatment and for injury can be separated. Two candidates were identified: lithium and ibudilast. Lithium is used in the treatment of bipolar disease (15Schlecker C. Boehmerle W. Jeromin A. DeGray B. Varshney A. Sharma Y. Szigeti-Buck K.

NCS-1 expression is elevated in bipolar patients (20Koh P.O. Undie A.S. Kabbani N. Levenson R. Goldman-Rakic P.S. Lidow M.S.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), a condition that would enhance the activity of the InsP3R activity and increase intracellular calcium signals (12Benbow J.H.

Chem. 2011; 286: 34575-34582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Addition of lithium did not alter NCS-1 binding to the InsP3R, but did reduce intracellular calcium signals to control levels (12Benbow J.H. DeGray B. Ehrlich B.E.

Because Taxol increased intracellular calcium signaling in a NCS-1-dependent manner (11Boehmerle W. Zhang K. Sivula M. Heidrich F.M. Lee Y. Jordt S.E. Ehrlich B.E. Chronic exposure to paclitaxel diminishes phosphoinositide signaling by calpain-mediated neuronal calcium sensor-1 degradation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 11103-11108Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the addition of lithium during chemotherapy with Taxol would have the potential to inhibit the initial Taxol-induced increase in activation of the InsP3R, that results in an eventual decrease in overall calcium signaling after prolonged treatment and prevent pathological intracellular calcium signals in neurons. Ibudilast has been used in several Asian countries to treat bronchial asthma, cerebrovascular disorders, poststroke dizziness, and ocular allergies (21Cho Y. Crichlow G.V. Vermeire J.J. Leng L. Du X.

Although there are questions remaining, the mechanism of action for ibudilast for the conditions listed here is thought to be related to its ability to inhibit phosphodiesterases and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (21Cho Y.

Because ibudilast also regulates various neuronal and glial targets linked to neuropathic pain generation (21Cho Y. Crichlow G.V. Vermeire J.J. Leng L. Du X. Hodsdon M.E. Bucala R. Cappello M. Gross M. Gaeta F. Johnson K. Lolis E.J. Allosteric inhibition of macrophage migration inhibitory factor revealed by ibudilast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 11313-11318Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that co-administering ibudilast with either Taxol or vincristine could also prevent the enhanced calcium signaling associated with chemotherapeutic drugs. In this paper, we found that the addition of either lithium or ibudilast to neuroblastoma cells treated with Taxol protected both NCS-1 levels as well as intracellular calcium signaling. Vincristine was also found to decrease intracellular calcium signaling, and the presence of either candidate compound was also found to protect the cells. The ability of Taxol to alter microtubule formation was unchanged by the addition of lithium or ibudilast. These results suggest that the addition of either lithium or ibudilast to the existing chemotherapy treatment has the potential to prevent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. NCS-1 was expressed and purified as described previously (12Benbow J.H. DeGray B. Ehrlich B.E. Protection of neuronal calcium sensor 1 protein in cells treated with paclitaxel.J. Biol.

Additional experiments were performed with 1.0 μg of NCS-1 and either 2.0 μm ibudilast or 2.0 mm lithium with increasing concentrations of Taxol or vincristine to determine whether ibudilast or lithium interfered with the ability of NCS-1 to bind to the chemotherapeutic drugs. Control experiments with buffer (10 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm CaCl2) alone and increasing concentrations of each drug alone were subtracted from the experiments containing NCS-1.

SHSY-5Y cells were also treated for 6 h with 500 nm vincristine with and without 1.0 μm ibudilast or 5.0 mm lithium or a combination of both. N2A cells were treated with 800 ng/ml Taxol or 500 nm vincristine. Briefly, SHSY-5Y and N2A cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Hepes buffer containing 1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Pluronic F-127 and 5 μm Fluo-4 (Invitrogen). A Zeiss LSM 710 scanning laser confocal microscope equipped with a C-Apochromat ×40/1.2 water immersion objective (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) was used. Cells were excited with 1 μm ATP to induce a transient release of calcium from intracellular stores. After the calcium signal returned to base line following ATP stimulation, 10 μm thapsigargin was added to indicate that the intracellular stores were filled and the cells were viable. A minimum of 4–5 wells over several days with 80–150 total cells was compared for each condition. Calcium-induced fluorescence intensity ratio, F/F0, was plotted as a function of time in seconds with F0 calculated as the average of the first 10 points of the base line. Response duration was defined as the time the calcium signal remains consecutively over 50% of the peak value. The Tubulin Polymerization Assay Kit (Cytoskeleton) was used to measure tubulin polymerization in the presence of Taxol and ibudilast or lithium. Experiments were performed following the standard manufacturer's protocol using a Corning half-area 96-well plate and a Tecan Infinite M200 spectrometer with Tecan i-control software. Each assay was performed with 3 mg/ml tubulin, and the effects of 1 μm Taxol with and without 2 μm ibudilast or 2 mm lithium were tested. Spectrometer readings of these assays were taken at 340 nm every minute for 1 h at 37 °C, and the results were scaled and plotted. Binding between NCS-1 and various chemotherapeutic drugs was assessed using tryptophan fluorescence. Taxol, docetaxel, and vincristine all bind NCS-1 in the low micromolar range (Fig. 1, A and B). NCS-1 bound Taxol with an affinity of 0.066 ± 0.008 μm, docetaxel with an affinity of 0.062 ± 0.009 μm, and vincristine with an affinity of 0.024 ± 0.01 μm (Fig. 1, A and B). As a negative control, the interaction between oxaliplatin and NCS-1 was tested. Oxaliplatin did not bind NCS-1 (Fig. 1C). To verify that lithium binds to NCS-1 without interfering with the ability of NCS-1 to bind to the chemotherapeutic drugs, tryptophan fluorescence was tested in the presence and absence of each drug with lithium present. Lithium alone bound to NCS-1 with a binding affinity of 0.54 ± 0.05 mm (Fig. 2A). With increasing concentrations of Taxol or vincristine, the binding curves with NCS-1 were unchanged by the presence of 2.0 mm LiCl (Fig. 2, C and D). The binding affinities in the presence of lithium were 0.058 ± 0.009 μm and 0.02 ± 0.006 μm for Taxol and vincristine, respectively. To verify that NCS-1 is binding these drugs, NMR of NCS-1 in the presence and absence of the drugs was performed. The NMR shifted upon addition of the chemotherapeutic drugs, which confirmed binding to NCS-1 (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3NMR spectra of NCS-1 binding to ibudilast, vincristine sulfate, lithium, and Taxol.

Ibudilast ligand was at a 3.5-fold molar excess relative to the 15N NCS1 protein.

Paclitaxel ligand was added at a 10-fold molar excess relative to the 15N NCS1 protein and precipitated ligand removed through centrifugation. D, overlaid two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectra of 130 μm uniformly labeled 15N NCS1 apo (red contours) and with LiCl (blue contours) in 50 mm Tris buffer, 100 mm KCl at pH 7.4, with 9% v/v dimethyl-d6 sulfoxide and 1 mm TCEP. Lithium was added to a concentration of 10 mm in the holo spectrum. All buffers contained saturating concentrations of Ca2+ (∼20 mm) and Mg2+ (∼10 mm). Unlike the other ligands, there is a discrepancy between the NMR (shown here) and fluorescence results for lithium (Fig. 2A) which can be explained in one of two ways. First, lithium ions may be able to penetrate the NCS-1 structure and alter the solvation shell of buried tryptophans in a manner that potassium ions, with its larger ionic radius, cannot. Second, binding of lithium may involve only interactions with fixed side chain atoms with no alteration in chemical environment of backbone atoms. Proton chemical shifts are reported relative to 3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-propanesulfonic acid referenced to 0 ppm. All NMR experiments were conducted on a Varian INOVA 600 MHz spectrometer using a 5-mm triple-resonance probe equipped with triple-axis pulsed magnetic field gradients and utilized pulse sequences from the Varian BioPack User Library (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) and processed using NMRPipe (Refs. 29Delaglio F.

The tail region has dual functions as a regulator of membrane binding/enzyme activation and as an inhibitor of catalysis in the unbound form of the enzyme, suggesting conformational plasticity. These functions are well conserved in CCTs across diverse phyla, although the sequences of the tail regions are not. CCT regulatory tails of diverse origins are composed of a long membrane lipid-inducible amphipathic helix (m-AH) followed by a highly disordered segment, reminiscent of the Parkinson disease-linked protein, α-synuclein, which we show shares a novel sequence motif with vertebrate CCTs. To unravel features required for silencing, we created chimeric enzymes by fusing the catalytic domain of rat CCTα to the regulatory tail of CCTs from Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae or to α-synuclein. Only the tail domains of the two invertebrate CCTs were competent for both suppression of catalytic activity and for activation by lipid vesicles. Thus, both silencing and activating functions of the m-AH can tolerate significant changes in length and sequence. We identified a highly amphipathic 22-residue segment in the m-AH with features conserved among animal CCTs but not yeast CCT or α-synuclein. Deletion of this segment from rat CCT increased the lipid-independent Vmax by 10-fold, equivalent to the effect of deleting the entire tail, and severely weakened membrane binding affinity. However, membrane binding was required for additional increases in catalytic efficiency. Thus, full activation of CCT may require not only loss of a silencing conformation in the m-AH but a gain of an activating conformation, promoted by membrane binding. phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT), an amphitropic enzyme that regulates phosphatidylcholine synthesis, is composed of a catalytic head domain and a regulatory tail.

Two diverse examples of catalytic silencing by an m-AH motif are the Escherichia coli pyruvate oxidase and eukaryotic CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT). Pyruvate oxidase binding to membranes, stimulated by increases in pyruvate concentration, facilitates the transfer of electrons between flavins and ubiquinone, the latter being located in the membrane (7Neumann P.

For both enzymes, the membrane-bound forms are associated with catalytic activation, where the m-AH helical conformation is stabilized by membrane binding.

In fact, it is not known whether the regulatory AH segment makes contact with the catalytic domain as part of the silencing mechanism. Because silencing is a feature of CCT m-AH segments across phyla that have divergent M sequences, it is possible that the silencing mechanism does not involve an ordered contact between the two domains. membrane-inducible amphipathic helix CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase egg phosphatidylcholine egg phosphatidylglycerol 1,2-dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine oleic acid N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine amphipathic helix dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine.

The CCT m-AH, responsible for maintaining its activity status, resides in a domain referred to as domain M, for membrane binding. We use the terms domain M and m-AH interchangeably. Although its boundaries are not certain, it includes at least 69 residues in rat CCTα, from Phe-234 to Met-302 (16Taneva S.G. Lee J.M. Cornell R.B.

Although these models are not mutually exclusive, the conflicting results from very similar truncation variants need resolution. Although several reports have tried to define the subregions and features of domain M required for membrane binding and lipid activation (15Yang W. Boggs K.P. Jackowski S.

Both functions of the M domain operate in CCTs even though the sequence diversity of this region is high between phyla. Vertebrate CCTs are characterized by a set of tandem 11-mer motifs, whose similarity with the 11-mer motif in the m-AH segment of the Parkinson disease protein, α-synuclein, has been noted (16Taneva S.G. Lee J.M. Cornell R.B. The amphipathic helix of an enzyme that regulates phosphatidylcholine synthesis remodels membranes into highly curved nanotubules.Biochim. Biophys.

In α-synuclein, the role of the 11-mer has been described as a means to enhance membrane interactions by maintaining the amphipathic register of a very long segment as a 3–11 α-helix (29Bussell Jr., R.

However, the 11-mer motif is not an obvious feature of invertebrate or yeast CCTs that are lipid-regulated, which raises the following question. What, if any, is the function of this motif in CCTs? In this study, we have focused on features of the M domain critical for silencing. We initially asked three questions: Is the predicted structure (or lack of it) in this region conserved? Is there strong binding between the catalytic and M domains in the lipid-free form? Can the M domain of a CCT lacking a repeated 11-mer motif substitute for the native M domain in mammalian CCT with respect to silencing or activation? These explorations led to the identification of a conserved segment within domain M that is a key contributor to its silencing and activation functions. Rat CCTα was analyzed with all 17 servers available at the rosetta design group server. We selected programs within this set for evaluating CCTs from other species based on two criteria: (i) accuracy in correlating order/disorder with elements from the solved structure of the catalytic domain of rat CCTα (Protein Data Bank code 3HL4); and (ii) low or negligible weighting of structural data from protein data banks obtained from sequence blasts. We found that DISOclust, DISOPRED, DISpro, and POODLE-I performed this task the best. The analysis of the physicochemical properties of the m-AH segments of M domains utilized the HeliQuest server (30Gautier R. Douguet D. Antonny B. Drin G. HELIQUEST. A web server to screen sequences with specific α-helical properties.Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 2101-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). 10 CCTα and -β (40 11-mers) and 11 α-, β-, and γ-synucleins (61 11-mers) from four classes of vertebrates were used to generate a hidden Markov sequence profile (31Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Finn R.D. Sonnhammer E.L.

The input sequences and the output for the profile sequence are shown in the supplemental Table S1. This profile was used to search an ENSEMBL base (version 48) of vertebrate and invertebrate eukaryotic proteomes listed in the supplemental Table S1. The constraints imposed on the search were ≥2 11-mers with at least 1 11-mer matching the hidden Markov sequence profile. The retrieved sequences with e-values ≥2.0 were converted to FASTA format and aligned with ClustalW (32Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Using CLUSTAL for multiple sequence alignments.Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To assemble a phylogenetic tree, we used PHYLIP (33Felsenstein J. Phylogenies from molecular sequences. Inference and reliability.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 521-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar) and TreeView programs (34Page R.D. TreeView.

Caenorhabditis briggsae Dur-1 was arbitrarily assigned as the progenitor. The preparation of full-length His-tagged rat CCTα was described in Xie et al. (35Xie M. Smith J.L. Ding Z. Zhang D.

The preparation of the CCT head domain (CCT-236) encompassing residues 1–236 was described by Taneva et al. (11Taneva S. Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B.

A circular dichroism study.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11768-11776Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Chimeric CCTs contained His tags linked to residues 1–236 of rat CCTα, which was fused to the tail domains of Drosophila melanogaster (residues 239–381), C. elegans (residues 226–347), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (residues 263–424), or the complete sequence (140 residues) of human α-synuclein. Chimeras were created by engineering complementary primers for PCR at the 3′ end of the rat CCT head domain and the 5′ end of the non-rat CCT tail domains, both containing a SapI type IIs restriction site (36Beck R. Burtscher H. Introduction of arbitrary sequences into genes by use of class IIs restriction enzymes.Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 886-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). After amplification, digestion of the PCR products with SapI and ligation generated in-frame fusion of head and tail domains. Rat CCTα Δ272–293 (CCT-Δ22) was created by QuikChange mutagenesis using WT His6-rat CCTα as template and PCR primers complementary to the sequence flanking the 66 nucleotides to be excised. All constructs were checked for accuracy by sequencing. Constructs were expressed in COS cells, using 48 h of transfection time and purified by nickel-agarose affinity chromatography as described (14Taneva S. Dennis M.K. Ding Z. Smith J.L. Cornell R.B.

The phosphomimic version is the same segment but with all 16 serines between residues 314 and 367 substituted with glutamate. Purified rat CCTα head domain (His-CCT236) was pre-spun for 15 min at 13,000 rpm to remove insoluble particulates. His-CCT236 (0.3 nmol) was mixed with 0.3 nmol of rat CCTα tail segments (M + P or M + P − PM) in 40 μl of 30 mm phosphate, pH 8.15, 0.15 m NaCl, 40 mm imidazole, 2 mm DTT, where M is membrane-binding; P is phosphorylation region; PM is phosphomimic. The protein samples also contributed 15 μm octyl glucoside and 40 μm Triton X-100. This mix was added to pre-washed nickel-agarose beads and incubated for 20 min at 20 °C, end-over-end. After centrifugation at 2000 × g for 1 min, the supernatant was transferred to another tube. The beads were washed with ⅓ volume of mixing buffer and centrifuged as above. Proportional fractions of the combined supernatants and pellet were examined by SDS-PAGE. The Coomassie-stained protein bands were quantified using ImageQuant. CCT activity was performed as described (14Taneva S. Dennis M.K. Ding Z. Smith J.L. Cornell R.B.

https://openalex.org/W2005106341,"The E6AP E3 ubiquitin ligase has been linked to the regulation of cell growth and to the cellular stress response. However, the specific stress conditions that are controlled by E6AP have not been defined. An important stress condition that controls cell growth is oxidative stress, where the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulate the appropriate cellular response. Here, we describe a novel role for E6AP in the control of oxidative stress response. Cells lacking E6AP expression have reduced capacity to accumulate ROS, and oxidative DNA damage, in response to 20% cell culture oxygen levels, treatment with hydrogen peroxide and expression of oncogenic RAS. This effect of E6AP is associated with the regulation of the anti-oxidant enzyme, Prx1, a previously identified target of E6AP, and can be corrected by downregulation of Prx1 or by reconstitution of E6AP expression. Consequently, cells with compromised E6AP have impaired senescent and apoptotic response to sub-lethal and lethal doses of oxidative stress, respectively. In a xenograft model, downregulation of E6AP renders transplanted tumours refractory to growth-suppressive effects of hydrogen peroxide. Our results provide the first demonstration that E6AP is an important regulator of ROS-mediated cellular senescence and cell death."

However, the molecular mechanisms that determine human LY6K transcription are completely unknown. To elucidate the mechanisms involved in human LY6K gene regulation and expression, multiple cis-elements were predicted using TRANSFAC software, and the LY6K regulatory region was identified using the luciferase assay in the human LY6K gene promoter. We performed ChIP, EMSA, and supershift assays to investigate the transcription factor activity on the LY6K promoter, and the effect of a SNP and CpG site methylation on AP-1 transcription factor binding affinity. AP-1 and the CREB transcription factor bound to LY6K promoter within −550/−1, which was essential for LY6K expression, but only the AP-1 heterodimer, JunD, and Fra-1, modulates LY6K gene transcriptional level. A decrease in LY6K was associated with the SNP242 C allele, a polymorphic G/C-SNP at the 242 nucleotide in the LY6K promoter region (rs2585175), or methylation of the CpG site, which was closely located with the AP-1 site by interfering with binding of the AP-1 transcription factor to the LY6K promoter.

The AP-1 dimeric complex binds to the DNA regulatory sequence, called the TPA response element, which regulates gene expression in response to a variety of stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, and ultraviolet radiation (13Karin M.

DNA methylation occurs when a methyl group is added to a CpG site and is an epigenetic event that plays an important role in gene regulation. In particular, methylation of the gene promoter CpG islands is tightly linked to histone modifications and nucleosome remodeling mechanisms that cause gene silencing (24Bird A.

In the present study, we identified the regulatory region essential for LY6K promoter activity. We also provide the first evidence that LY6K gene expression is regulated by SNP or DNA methylation in the proximal promoter region. Our findings suggest that the AP-1 transcription factor affects invasion and metastasis by regulating LY6K expression in breast cancer cells and that SNP242 or DNA methylation of a specific CpG site within the LY6K promoter down-regulates LY6K by effectively interfering with AP-1 binding, suggesting a reduced risk of breast cancer. The human breast carcinoma cells used in this study included the MCF7 and MCF7-ADR, sublines, which are adriamycin-resistant (obtained from Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (WelGENE, Inc., Daejeon, Korea) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (WelGENE) and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 and 95% air. Promoter constructs encompassing the region from −2.0 kb to 0.2 kb relative to the transcription start site of the human LY6K gene were amplified from human genomic DNA using specifically designed forward and reverse primers containing the XhoI and HindIII restriction enzyme sites, respectively. Each fragment was digested with XhoI and HindIII purified using the HiYield Gel/PCR extraction kit (RBC Bioscience, Taipei, Taiwan) according to the manufacturer's recommendations and cloned into the pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Deleted constructs from −500 to −1 and from −1550 to −1050 were also amplified by PCR with primers, including specific restriction enzyme sites, which were purified using the HiYield gel/PCR extraction kit (RBC Bioscience), and cloned into the pGL3-basic vector. MCF7-ADR cells were seeded in a 12-well plate at 1 × 105 per well and temporarily transfected with 1 μg of the LY6K promoter reporter vector using the FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cells were co-transfected with 40 ng of the phRL-CMV vector to verify transfection efficiency. After 24–48 h of transfection, the cells were lysed in 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay (Promega) and a luminometer (Tuner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA fragments for AP-1 and SNP242 point mutated sites were created by PCR using specifically designed primers (supplemental Table 1) by incorporating the required base pair substitutions and using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The template for this process was the pGL3-LY6K-0.5 vector. The PCR cycling parameters were as follows: 1 cycle of 95 °C for 30 s, 12 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 1 min for point mutation. The insert sequence was verified by DNA sequence analysis. The imprint chromatin immunoprecipitation kit (CHP1, Sigma-Aldrich) was used for the ChIP assay. Briefly, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde and quenched with 1.25 m glycine, and the DNA was sheared by sonication on ice (total time, 15 min; on time, 30 s; off time, 2 min). The sheared DNA was incubated with IgG as a negative control, and c-Jun (sc-1694), JunB (sc-8051), JunD (sc-74), c-Fos (sc-52), FosB (sc-28213), Fra-1 (sc-183), Fra-2 (sc-604), and PAX3 (sc-81351) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) in a strip well overnight at 4 °C. The strip well was washed, the cross-link was reversed, and the DNA was purified with the GenElute Binding Column G (C6863, Sigma-Aldrich). Prepared samples were amplified using specifically designed ChIP primers for the region of interest (supplemental Table 1). PCR conditions for the ChIP analysis were as follows: 1 cycle of 95 °C for 2 min, 50 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 5 min, and storage at 4 °C. Nuclear extracts were prepared using a nuclear extraction kit (Panomics, Inc., Santa Clara, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of the predicted transcription binding site probe within the 550-bp human LY6K promoter region are presented in Table 1. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the AP-1 and CREB consensus sites were purchased from Promega. The sequences of the wild type and mutant probes containing the transcription binding site are presented in supplemental Table 1. For binding assays, 10 μg of nuclear extract samples were incubated with purified γ-32P-labeled probe using G-50 Sephadex columns (Roche Applied Science) at room temperature for 30 min in a buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 30 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm ethylenediaminetatraacetic acid (EDTA), 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, proteinase inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml luepeptin) and 0.2 μg poly(dI-dC) in a 20-μl reaction volume. DNA-protein complexes were analyzed on 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels that had been prerun at 200 V for 30 min in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer.

The gels were run at 180 V for 3 h, dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 1 h, and then exposed to a FLA-7000 cassette. MCF7-ADR cells were transfected with several small interfering RNA (siRNAs) at a concentration of 30 nm for 48 h using Lipofectamine RNAi Max (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. siRNAs specific to LY6K (sc-77440), JunD (sc-35728), c-Fos (sc-29221), Fra-1 (sc-35405), and Fra-2 (sc-35407) were used to silence target genes. A control siRNA (sc-37007), which had no considerable homology to any known human sequence, was transfected as the negative control. All siRNAs were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Total cellular RNAs were extracted with a NucleoSpin RNA/Protein kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 5 μg of RNA was used for reverse transcription with the M-MLV Reverse Transcription kit (Promega). A 100–300-ng portion of template cDNA was mixed with 1 μl of primer mix of forward and reverse preimers (supplemental Table 1) and 5 μl of SYBR Green Mastermix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Reciprocal IP was performed using 100-mm dishes of MCF7-ADR cells. The cells were washed with 1× cold PBS and harvested in 1 ml of 1× cold PBS following centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 1 min at 4 °C. The pellets were lysed by vortexing with 100 μl of IP150 buffer/Nonidet P-40 (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm EDTA) and incubated for 15 min in ice. Lysates were diluted with 400 μl of IP150 buffer without Nonidet P-40 (37.5 mm NaCl, 6.25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2.5% glycerol, and 0.25 mm EDTA) and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C to remove debris. The supernatants were incubated at 4 °C with anti-JunD rabbit polyclonal antibody (sc-74), anti-Fra-1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (sc-183), and anti-IgG rabbit polyclonal antibody as a negative control for 90 min. Immunoglobulin G (IgG)-Sepharose beads were used to immunoprecipitate the proteins. Following the incubation, the beads were washed three times with IP wash buffer (225 mm NaCl, 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.125% Nonidet P-40 and 0.25 mm EDTA). The washed beads containing the bound proteins were suspended in 20 μl of 6× SDS gel loading buffer and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. The released polypeptides in 15 μl of heated sample were resolved on 10–12% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins from breast cancer cells were extracted using a NucleoSpin RNA/protein kit, (Macherey-Nagel), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of extracted protein were loaded on polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinyl difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk and incubated with specific primary antibodies. The antibody bound membranes were washed and then incubated with secondary antibodies and an anti-biotin marker. The membranes with bound antibodies were analyzed using the Amersham Biosciences ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (GE Healthcare). The primary antibodies were LY6K (sc-87282), JunD (sc-74), c-Fos (sc-52), Fra-1 (sc-183), and Fra-2 (sc-604) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and anti-biotin (7075) from Cell Signaling Technology. The secondary antibodies were HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal (SAB-300J), and goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 polyclonal (SAB-100J), from Assay Designs (Ann Arbor, MI). The data, normalized to base line or control activity in individual experiments, were presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed by a Student's paired t test using GraphPad InStat Software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). For all analyses, p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. In all figures, an asterisk represents a p value < 0.01. We have previously reported that LY6K is a potential breast cancer biomarker that affects invasive ability and metastasis (8Lee J.W. Lee Y.S. Yoo K.H. Lee K.H. Park K. Ahn T. Ko C. Park J.H. LY-6K gene: a novel molecular marker for human breast cancer.Oncol. Rep. 2006; 16: 1211-1214PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the regulatory mechanism of the LY6K gene, a series of LY6K-luc promoter constructs −2050/+182 were transfected into MCF7-ADR cells, and the levels of promoter activity were measured. The pGL3-control vector and the pGL3-basic vector were transfected as positive and negative controls, respectively. Transcriptional activity of LY6K-luc was normalized with the pGL3-basic vector, and we confirmed that the activity significantly increased −550/−200 and −1550/−1050 bps (Fig. 1A). Then, truncated constructs were specifically designed with deletions from −500 to −1 and from −1550 to −1050 to identify a more important site for controlling gene expression. The deletion from −550 to −1 sharply and significantly reduced promoter activity. However, deletion of −1550/−1050 did not alter promoter activity (Fig. 1B). These findings suggest the presence of a putative transcription binding site within the −550/−1 that regulates basal LY6K gene expression. Given that promoter activity was reduced in −550/−1 deleted constructs, we investigated the DNA binding motif using TRANSFAC gene tool software, which is schematically listed in Table 1 and presented in Fig. 1C. We examined which transcription factor bound the LY6K promoter using EMSA (supplemental Fig. S1). We observed the formation of a prominent DNA-protein complex for the double-stranded oligonucleotide probes containing AP-1, cAMP-responsive element (CRE), and TATA sequences of the LY6K promoter. Various sized LY6K promoter constructs ligated to the luciferase reporter gene were transiently transfected into MCF7-ADR cells (Fig. 1C). The shorter pGL3−73 construct, which encompassed nucleotides −73 to +182, contained a minimal TATA box. This construct represented basal LY6K promoter activity. The pGL3−133 construct showed basal-like activity in the MCF7-ADR cell line. The pGL3−312 construct directed a 5-fold increase above basal transcription activity, suggesting the presence of important cis-regulatory elements, AP-1 and NF-κB, between nucleotides −133 and −312 of the LY6K promoter (Fig. 1C). Based on these results, we focused our study on the region encompassing nucleotides −312 to −133 of the LY6K promoter. The LY6K gene had the rs2585175 SNP located at nucleotide 242 within −312 to −133 of the LY6K promoter (called SNP242). We designed mutant constructs for AP-1 and SNP242 using site-directed mutagenesis to determine the functional role of AP-1 and SNP242 in regulating the LY6K promoter. The pGL3-basic vector was transfected as the negative control, and transcriptional activity was measured. As shown in Fig. 1D, the normalized promoter activity of the AP-1 mutated LY6K-luc vector significantly decreased ∼8-fold, suggesting that the transcription factor bound to the AP-1 consensus binding site within the −550 regulatory elements in the LY6K promoter. Interestingly, the single base pair mutated LY6K-luc reporter SNP242 decreased transcriptional activity 2-fold in MCF7-ADR cells. Taken together, we conclude that a transcription factor bound to the AP-1 binding site within the LY6K promoter and regulated expression of the LY6K gene and that the SNP242 mutation (G→C) reduced levels of the LY6K gene transcript. The EMSA was conducted with the wt and mt AP-1 probe to confirm that the AP-1 binding site was within the LY6K promoter. First, it was determined whether the nuclear extract (NE) from MCF7-ADR cells had the AP-1 factor that bound to the consensus AP-1 probe in the presence or absence of unlabeled probe (Fig. 2A). Then, binding of NE from MCF7-ADR cells to the wt 22-bp probe within the LY6K promoter was investigated (Fig. 2B). A shifted band was observed in lane 3, which was a mixture of NE from MCF7-ADR cells with the wt 22-bp oligonucleotide probe (Fig. 2B). The shifted band disappeared in lanes 4 and 5 in the presence of the unlabeled or AP-1 mutated probe. Therefore, it was concluded that the shifted band was a complex of the transcription factor and radiolabeled oligonucleotide. The EMSA was performed with the wild type and mutant CREB probes to confirm which transcription factors bound the CRE element of the LY6K promoter. The CRE binding factors present within the NE of MCF7-ADR cells demonstrated significant binding to a consensus CRE probe (supplemental Fig. 2A). We observed the formation of one prominent DNA-protein complex for the wild type CRE probe analyzed (supplemental Fig. 2B). In a supershift experiment, we confirmed that adding anti-CREB antibody produced a supershift complex but that the anti-CREB binding protein CBP antibody had no effect (supplemental Fig. 2, C and D). These results suggest that the AP-1 and CREB transcription factors bind to the LY6K promoter within −253/−246 and −130/−111 but that only AP-1 modulates LY6K gene transcription levels. ChIP and supershift assays were used to demonstrate in vitro interactions between the AP-1 transcription factor and the AP-1 binding site within the LY6K promoter. First, a ChIP analysis using c-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2 antibodies was carried out and confirmed by PCR. Input and IgG were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The results revealed that JunD directly bound to the DNA fragment containing the AP-1 binding site of LY6K (Fig. 2C). c-Fos and Fra-1 also bound to the LY6K promoter, but the signal was weak (Fig. 2C). Next, we examined which AP-1 transcription factors bound to the wt 22-bp probe contained at the AP-1 binding site. As shown in Fig. 2D, mixtures with JunD, Fra-1, and Fra-2 antibodies were supershifted. In the presence of the mutant AP-1 probe, supershifted bands were completely abolished compared with that of the wt AP-1 probe (Fig. 2E). Taken together, AP-1 factor binding to the proximal AP-1 binding site of the LY6K promoter suggested that these factors might be important in regulating LY6K promoter activity. To determine which AP-1 transcription factor forms a dimer with JunD, we used siRNAs specifically directed against LY6K, JunD, c-Fos, Fra-1, and Fra-2 to silence their expression in MCF7-ADR cells. Transfection of several siRNAs abrogated LY6K, JunD, c-Fos, Fra-1, and Fra-2 mRNA and protein expression, respectively, in MCF7-ADR cells assayed by real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, we found that blocking JunD or Fra-1 expression induced a decrease in LY6K mRNA and protein level in MCF7-ADR cells, whereas transfection of the control siRNA did not alter this expression (Fig. 3, A and B). Endogenous proteins were immunoprecipitated to confirm the endogenous interaction between JunD and Fra"

S100A1 is a member of the Ca(2+)-binding S100 protein family. It is expressed in brain and heart tissue, where it plays a crucial role as a modulator of Ca(2+) homeostasis, energy metabolism, neurotransmitter release, and contractile performance. Biological effects of S100A1 have been attributed to its direct interaction with a variety of target proteins. The (patho)physiological relevance of S100A1 makes it an important molecular target for future therapeutic intervention. S-Nitrosylation is a post-translational modification of proteins, which plays a role in cellular signal transduction under physiological and pathological conditions. In this study, we confirmed that S100A1 protein is endogenously modified by Cys(85) S-nitrosylation in PC12 cells, which are a well established model system for studying S100A1 function. We used isothermal calorimetry to show that S-nitrosylation facilitates the formation of Ca(2+)-loaded S100A1 at physiological ionic strength conditions. To establish the unique influence of the S-nitroso group, our study describes high resolution three-dimensional structures of human apo-S100A1 protein with the Cys(85) thiol group in reduced and S-nitrosylated states. Solution structures of the proteins are based on NMR data obtained at physiological ionic strength. Comparative analysis shows that S-nitrosylation fine tunes the overall architecture of S100A1 protein. Although the typical S100 protein intersubunit four-helix bundle is conserved upon S-nitrosylation, the conformation of S100A1 protein is reorganized at the sites most important for target recognition (i.e. the C-terminal helix and the linker connecting two EF-hand domains). In summary, this study discloses cysteine S-nitrosylation as a new factor responsible for increasing functional diversity of S100A1 and helps explain the role of S100A1 as a Ca(2+) signal transmitter sensitive to NO/redox equilibrium within cells."
https://openalex.org/W1964144670,"PKCδ signaling to mitochondria has been implicated in both mitochondrial apoptosis and metabolism. However, the mechanism by which PKCδ interacts with mitochondria is not well understood. Using FRET-based imaging, we show that PKCδ interacts with mitochondria by a novel and isozyme-specific mechanism distinct from its canonical recruitment to other membranes such as the plasma membrane or Golgi. Specifically, we show that PKCδ interacts with mitochondria following stimulation with phorbol esters or, in L6 myocytes, with insulin via a mechanism that requires two steps. In the first step, PKCδ translocates acutely to mitochondria by a mechanism that requires its C1A and C1B domains and a Leu-Asn sequence in its turn motif. In the second step, PKCδ is retained at mitochondria by a mechanism that depends on its C2 domain, a unique Glu residue in its activation loop, intrinsic catalytic activity, and the mitochondrial membrane potential. In contrast, of these determinants, only the C1B domain is required for the phorbol ester-stimulated translocation of PKCδ to other membranes. PKCδ also basally localizes to mitochondria and increases mitochondrial respiration via many of the same determinants that promote its agonist-evoked interaction. PKCδ localized to mitochondria has robust activity, as revealed by a FRET reporter of PKCδ-specific activity (δCKAR). These data support a model in which multiple determinants unique to PKCδ drive a specific interaction with mitochondria that promotes mitochondrial respiration."

Increased surface expression of SLAMF3 and SLAMF6 has been linked with disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus. Here we demonstrate that in human total T lymphocytes the canonical CD28 and the non-canonical SLAMF3/SLAMF6 co-stimulatory pathways cooperate in the recruitment of the transcription factor NFAT1 to the IL17A promoter. Furthermore, the dominance of the SLAMF3/SLAMF6 pathway in inducing IL-17A production can be attributed to an increased nuclear abundance and recruitment of RORγt to the IL17A promoter.

Co-activation of T lymphocytes with anti-SLAMF3 or anti-SLAMF6 antibodies along with CD3-T cell receptor stimulation induces IL-17A production and contributes to Th17 generation. However, the molecular downstream mechanisms following SLAM receptor activation and the involved transcription factor repertoires are not yet elucidated. The calcium-dependent transcription factor family that is referred to as nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) plays a central role during T helper lymphocyte differentiation.

SR1001 is a specific suppressor of RORα and RORγt activity. The application of SR1001 to in vitro T lymphocyte cultures results in reduced IL17A promoter activities and inhibits Th17 differentiation. In the Th17-dependent experimental autoimmune encephalopathy model, application of SR1001 results in an improvement of clinical scores and reduced expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-17A, IL-21, and IL-22 (27Solt L.A.

In this report, we demonstrate that both transcription factors, NFAT1 and RORγt, together are required in order to optimally induce IL17A in response to co-stimulation with CD28 and SLAMF3/SLAMF6. Differences in IL-17A expression levels in response to co-stimulation through the canonical CD28 pathway and the non-canonical SLAMF3/SLAMF6 co-stimulatory pathways can be explained by increased nuclear abundance of RORγt in response to SLAMF3/SLAMF6 signaling, resulting in enhanced recruitment to a RORγt(−183) binding site within the IL17A promoter and increased trans-activation. Blood samples were obtained from healthy platelet donors at the Kraft Family Blood Donor Center (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). Primary total T cells were isolated from peripheral venous blood by negative selection as described previously (15Rauen T. Hedrich C.M. Juang Y.T. Tenbrock K.

All plasmid DNA preparations were carried out with DNA purification kits (Qiagen) and sequence-verified (Genewiz, Cambridge, MA). Site-directed mutagenesis at the NFAT sites (−212 and −170) and the RORγt site (−183) within both reporter constructs IL17Ap(−465)_luc and IL17Ap(−195)_luc was performed using the PfuTurbo® DNA polymerase (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three million primary human T cells were transfected with a total amount of 3 μg of plasmid DNA by the Amaxa transfection system (Lonza). Each reporter experiment included 10 ng of Renilla luciferase construct as an internal control. Eighteen hours after transfection, cells were collected and lysed, and luciferase activity was quantified using the Promega Dual-Luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase experiments were repeated at least four times, and values in the bar diagrams are given as mean and S.E. Cell culture plates were precoated overnight with 0.5 μg/ml monoclonal anti-CD3 (BioXcell, clone OKT3), 0.5 μg/ml anti-CD28 (Biolegend), 0.5 μg/ml anti-SLAMF6 (Genentech, clone 24D8.1H5.1F5), or 0.5 μg/ml anti-SLAMF3 antibodies (Biolegend, clone HLy-9.1.25) as indicated. For transcription factor inhibition experiments and transcription factor immunoblotting assays, naive CD4+ T cells were differentiated into Th17 cells in serum-free X-VIVO10 medium (BioWhittaker) by the addition of IL-6 (25 ng/ml), TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml), IL-1β (12.5 ng/ml), IL-21 (25 ng/ml), and IL-23 (25 ng/ml) for the indicated time periods. IL-6, IL-1β, IL-23, and TGF-β1 were obtained from R&D Systems, and IL-21 was purchased from Cell Sciences. Supernatants were collected at different time points and tested for IL-17A (eBioscience) by ELISA. T lymphocytes were collected at different time points and tested for 1) the nuclear abundance of NFAT1 or RORγt at 72 or 120 h or 2) used for ChIP analysis (NFAT1 or RORγt recruitment) at 120 h as indicated. In order to assess the influence of NFAT and RORγt effects on IL-17A expression, both transcription factors were antagonized by applying specific inhibitors. NFAT was inhibited with 0.5 nm FK506/tacrolimus (Sigma) or 10 nm cyclosporin A (Sigma) as indicated, and RORγt was antagonized by 10 nm SR1001 (Cayman Chemical). Vehicle controls (DMSO for FK506/tacrolimus and CSA; 96% ethanol for SR1001) were included in order to exclude effects of the solvent on IL-17A expression.

Cells and supernatants were harvested in order to assess IL-17A expression by ELISA (eBioscience) and quantitative RT-PCR. NFAT1 mRNA knockdown efficiency was ∼60–70% as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR with NFAT1-specific primers. For nuclear protein extraction, cells were handled on ice and lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, supplemented with freshly added 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 2 mm aprotinin, 1 mm leupeptin, 10 mm NaF, and 2 mm Na3VO4 for 15 min. Subsequently, Nonidet P-40 was added to the reaction mixture at a concentration of 0.6%. Nuclei were pelleted, resuspended, and washed. Nuclear extracts were resolved on 4–12% BisTris gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h, incubated with primary antibody (1:1,000) overnight (NFATc2 and RORγt, both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), washed three times with TBS-T, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2,000) for 1 h, washed three times with TBS-T, developed with ECL reagents (GE Healthcare), and visualized on a Fujifilm LAS-4000 imager (GE Healthcare). Anti-NFAT1 antibodies were from Abcam, and anti-RORγt was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Nonspecific normal rabbit and normal mouse IgG were obtained from Upstate (Millipore). ChIP grade Protein A/G Plus-agarose was purchased from Pierce (Thermo Scientific). The ChIP assay was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology/Millipore). Briefly, human T cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were sonicated to shear DNA and sedimented, and diluted supernatants were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies. A proportion (20%) of the diluted supernatants was kept as “input” (input represents PCR amplification of the total sample). Protein-DNA complexes were eluted in 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3 and reverse-cross-linked at 65 °C. DNA was recovered using the QIAamp DNA minikit (Qiagen) and subjected to PCR analysis on an ABI OneStepPlus real-time PCR system. The amount of immunoprecipitated DNA was subtracted by the amplified DNA that was bound by the nonspecific normal IgG and subsequently calculated as relative to the respective input DNA. Reporter-ChIP was performed from T lymphocytes transfected with wild type IL17Ap(−195)_wild type, IL17Ap(−195)_mNFAT(−170), or IL17Ap(−195)_RORc(−183) plasmids. Subsequently, cells were lysed, DNA was sheared by sonication, and ChIP was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology/Millipore). Immunoprecipitated DNA was quantified by quantitative RT-PCR with sequence-specific primers. The paired two-tailed Student's t test was used for statistical analyses. A thorough analysis of the human IL17A promoter yielded three putative RORγt sites and two potential NFAT sites (Fig. 1A). To investigate whether NFAT and RORγt regulate IL-17A expression in response to canonical co-stimulation through CD28 and/or co-stimulation through SLAMF3 or SLAMF6 at the transcriptional level, we performed luciferase assays using reporter constructs spanning the proximal 465 or 195 bp of the human IL17A promoter (Fig. 1A). Indeed, stimulation of T lymphocytes with anti-CD3 antibodies plus anti-CD28, anti-SLAMF3 (Fig. 1, B and C), or anti-SLAMF6 (Fig. 1, D and E) antibodies resulted in significant up-regulation of IL17A promoter activities in both constructs as compared with pGL3 empty vector. Next, we deleted either NFAT site (−212 or −170) within the 465 bp-spanning construct (Fig. 1, B and D) or the sole NFAT site (−170) within the 195 bp-spanning IL17A reporter construct (Fig. 1, C and E) and noted that the activity of both constructs lacking NFAT sites was significantly reduced (p < 0.001 under all conditions in the 465-bp construct and p < 0.01 in the 192-bp construct). These results suggest that both NFAT sites are crucial for IL17A transcription in human T cells. To investigate whether RORγt regulates IL17A transcription in response to canonical co-stimulation through CD28 and/or co-stimulation through SLAMF3 or SLAMF6, we performed luciferase assays using the aforementioned reporter constructs spanning the proximal 465 or 195 bp of the human IL17A promoter (Fig. 1A). Stimulation of T lymphocytes with anti-CD3 antibodies plus anti-CD28, anti-SLAMF3 (Fig. 1B), or anti-SLAMF6 (Fig. 1C) antibodies resulted in a significant induction of IL17A promoter activities in both constructs as compared with pGL3 empty vector. However, co-stimulation with anti-SLAMF3 or anti-SLAMF6 antibodies was superior to co-stimulation with anti-CD28 antibodies. Next, we deleted the RORγt site (−183) within the 195 bp-spanning IL17A reporter construct and noted that promoter activity was significantly reduced (p < 0.01). These results suggest that the RORγt(−183) site is crucial for RORγt-mediated IL17A transcription in human T cells in response to CD28 and SLAMF co-stimulation (Fig. 2, B and D). In order to further investigate the involvement of NFAT and RORγt signaling in the induction of IL-17A expression and Th17 differentiation in response to either canonical CD28 or SLAMF3/SLAMF6 co-stimulation, we applied inhibitors for NFAT (FK506/tacrolimus and cyclosporin A) (29Cippà P.E.

Co-stimulation through SLAMF3/SLAMF6 resulted in significantly increased IL-17A expression when compared with canonical co-stimulation through CD28 (Figs. 3A and 4). Both NFAT inhibitors, FK506/tacrolimus and cyclosporin A, almost completely blocked IL-17A expression (p < 0.001) (Fig. 3A). The RORγt antagonist SR1001 significantly reduced IL-17A expression into the supernatant. However, IL-17A expression was not completely abrogated, suggesting additional effects of RORγt in addition to “preexisting” NFAT signaling that seems to be necessary for the induction of IL-17A expression (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 4IL-17A expression depends on RORγt.

https://openalex.org/W2078486441,"Integrins are extracellular matrix (ECM) receptors that are key players in the regulation of tumour cell invasion. The laminin-binding integrin α3β1 has previously been shown to regulate adhesion and migration of carcinoma cells in part through co-operative signalling with the tetraspanin family of transmembrane proteins. However, the spatial and temporal regulation of crosstalk between these families of transmembrane proteins in intact cells remains poorly understood. Here we have used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to demonstrate for the first time that α3β1 and the tetraspanin CD151 directly associate at the front and retracting rear of polarised migrating breast carcinoma cells in both two-dimentional (2D) and three-dimentional (3D)matrices. Furthermore, localised α3β1–CD151 binding correlates with lower CD151 homodimerisation in cells migrating on laminin or within matrigel. Loss of α3β1 integrin leads to increased CD151 homodimer formation, increased activation of Rho GTPase, loss of cell polarity and decreased invasion in 3D ECM. As a result, α3-silenced cells show decreased actin-based membrane protrusion and retraction in both 2D and 3D environments. These data demonstrate that associations between α3β1 and CD151 occur dynamically within discrete subcellular compartments and act to establish local GTPase signalling to promote tumour cell invasion. These novel findings shed light on the complex crosstalk and switching between receptor complexes in response to different extracellular cues during cell invasion in 3D environments."
https://openalex.org/W2039330081,"Airway submucosal glands are important sites of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride (Cl(-)) channel expression and fluid secretion in the airway. Whereas both mouse and human submucosal glands and their serous acinar cells express CFTR, human glands and serous cells secrete much more robustly than mouse cells/glands in response to cAMP-generating agonists such as forskolin and vasoactive intestinal peptide. In this study, we examined mouse and human serous acinar cells to explain this difference and reveal further insights into the mechanisms of serous cell secretion. We found that mouse serous cells possess a robust cAMP-activated CFTR-dependent Cl(-) permeability, but they lack cAMP-activated calcium (Ca(2+)) signaling observed in human cells. Similar to human cells, basal K(+) conductance is extremely small in mouse acinar cells. Lack of cAMP-activated Ca(2+) signaling in mouse cells results in the absence of K(+) conductances required for secretion. However, cAMP activates CFTR-dependent fluid secretion during low-level cholinergic stimulation that fails to activate secretion on its own. Robust CFTR-dependent fluid secretion was also observed when cAMP stimulation was combined with direct pharmacological activation of epithelial K(+) channels with 1-ethyl-2-benzimidazolinone (EBIO). Our data suggest that mouse serous cells lack cAMP-mediated Ca(2+) signaling to activate basolateral membrane K(+) conductance, resulting in weak cAMP-driven serous cell fluid secretion, providing the likely explanation for reduced cAMP-driven secretion observed in mouse compared with human glands."
https://openalex.org/W1967334902,"The malignant cell in classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is the binucleated giant Reed-Sternberg cell. Chromosomal instability and mitotic errors may contribute to HL pathogenesis; one potential mitotic regulator is the kelch protein KLHDC8B, which localizes to the midbody, is expressed during mitosis, and is mutated in a subset of familial and sporadic HL. We report that disrupting KLHDC8B function in HeLa cells, B lymphoblasts, and fibroblasts leads to significant increases in multinucleation, multipolar mitoses, failed abscission, asymmetric segregation of daughter nuclei, formation of anucleated daughter cells, centrosomal amplification, and aneuploidy. We recapitulated the major pathologic features of the Reed-Sternberg cell and concluded that KLHDC8B is essential for mitotic integrity and maintenance of chromosomal stability. The significant impact of KLHDC8B implicates the central roles of mitotic regulation and chromosomal segregation in the pathogenesis of HL and provides a novel molecular mechanism for chromosomal instability in HL."
https://openalex.org/W2043880865,"Estrogen receptor α (ERα) has critical roles in the development and progression of breast cancer, and the coiled-coil co-activator (CoCoA) is an important ERα co-activator for estrogen-induced gene expression. The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) pathway is hyperactivated in breast cancer, but the mechanism by which SUMOylation regulates ERα-mediated transcription remains poorly understood. Here, we identified ZFP282 as a CoCoA-binding protein. ZFP282 associates directly with ERα and cooperates synergistically with CoCoA to enhance ERα function. ZFP282 is required for estrogen-induced expression of ERα target genes and estrogen-dependent breast cancer cell growth and tumorigenesis. In addition, we found that ZFP282 is SUMOylated and that SUMOylation positively regulates the co-activator activity of ZFP282 by increasing its binding affinity to ERα and CoCoA, and consequently increasing recruitment of ZFP282–CoCoA complex to the promoter of ERα target genes. These findings reveal essential roles for ZFP282 and its SUMOylation in estrogen signaling and breast tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2012553164,"The oligosaccharides from fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe contain large amounts of D-galactose (Gal) in addition to D-mannose (Man), in contrast to the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Detailed structural analysis has revealed that the Gal residues are attached to the N- and O-linked oligosaccharides via α1,2- or α1,3-linkages. Previously we constructed and characterized a septuple α-galactosyltransferase disruptant (7GalTΔ) anticipating a complete lack of α-Gal residues. However, the 7GalTΔ strain still contained oligosaccharides consisting of α1,3-linked Gal residues, indicating the presence of at least one more additional unidentified α1,3-galactosyltransferase. In this study we searched for unidentified putative glycosyltransferases in the S. pombe genome sequence and identified three novel genes, named otg1(+)-otg3(+) (α one, three-galactosyltransferase), that belong to glycosyltransferase gene family 8 in the Carbohydrate Active EnZymes (CAZY) database. Gal-recognizing lectin blotting and HPLC analyses of pyridylaminated oligosaccharides after deletion of these three additional genes from 7GalTΔ strain demonstrated that the resultant disruptant missing 10 α-galactosyltransferase genes, 10GalTΔ, exhibited a complete loss of galactosylation. In an in vitro galactosylation assay, the otg2(+) gene product had Gal transfer activity toward a pyridylaminated Man(9)GlcNAc(2) oligosaccharide and pyridylaminated Manα1,2-Manα1,2-Man oligosaccharide. In addition, the otg3(+) gene product exhibited Gal transfer activity toward the pyridylaminated Man(9)GlcNAc(2) oligosaccharide. Generation of an α1,3-linkage was confirmed by HPLC analysis, α-galactosidase digestion analysis, (1)H NMR spectroscopy, and LC-MS/MS analysis. These results indicate that Otg2p and Otg3p are involved in α1,3-galactosylation of S. pombe oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W2004072559,"Background Lysosomal protein transmembrane 4 beta (LAPTM4B) is a novel cancer-related gene which has two alleles designated LAPTM4B*1 and LAPTM4B*2. In this study we investigated the correlation of LAPTM4B genotype with prognosis and clinicopathologic features in patients who had undergone curative resection for gallbladder carcinoma (GBC). Methodology/Principal Findings PCR assay was performed to determine the LAPTM4B genotype in 85 patients. The correlation of LAPTM4B genotype with clinicopathologic parameters was assessed with the Chi-squared test. Differences in patient survival were determined by the Kaplan–Meier method. Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors was carried out with Cox regression analysis. Patients with LAPTM4B *2 had both significantly shorter overall survival (OS) and shorter disease-free survival (DFS) (both P<0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that LAPTM4B genotype is a prognostic factor for OS and DFS (both P<0.001). Conclusions/Significance LAPTM4B allele *2 is a risk factor associated with poor prognosis in patients with resected GBC, and LAPTM4B status may be therefore be useful preoperatively as an adjunct in evaluation of the operability of GBC."

A screen was developed to identify inhibitors of NMO-IgG-dependent, complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Screening of 50,000 synthetic small molecules was done using CHO cells expressing human AQP4 and a human NMO recombinant monoclonal antibody (rAb-53). The screen yielded pyrano[2,3-c]pyrazoles that blocked rAb-53 binding to AQP4 and prevented cytotoxicity in cell culture and spinal cord slice models of NMO. Structure-activity analysis of 82 analogs yielded a blocker with IC(50) ∼ 6 μm. Analysis of the blocker mechanism indicated idiotype specificity, as (i) pyrano[2,3-c]pyrazoles did not prevent AQP4 binding or cytotoxicity of other NMO-IgGs, and (ii) surface plasmon resonance showed specific rAb-53 binding. Antibody structure modeling and docking suggested a putative binding site near the complementarity-determining regions.

https://openalex.org/W1968225905,"Although prostanoids are known to be involved in regulation of the spontaneous beating rate of cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, the various subtypes of prostanoid receptors have not been investigated in detail.

Two prostanoid IP receptor agonists (iloprost and beraprost) induced first a marked drop in the beating rate and then definitive abrogation of beating. In contrast, the prostanoid DP receptor agonists (PGD(2) and BW245C) and TP receptor agonists (U-46619) produced increases in the beating rate. Sulprostone (a prostanoid EP(1) and EP(3) receptor agonist) induced marked increases in the beating rate, which were suppressed by SC-19220 (a selective prostanoid EP(1) antagonist). Butaprost (a selective prostanoid EP(2) receptor agonist), misoprostol (a prostanoid EP(2) and EP(3) receptor agonist), 11-deoxy-PGE(1) (a prostanoid EP(2), EP(3) and EP(4) receptor agonist) did not alter the beating rate. Our results strongly suggest that prostanoid EP(1) receptors are involved in positive regulation of the beating rate. Prostanoid EP(1) receptor expression was confirmed by western blotting with a selective antibody. Hence, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes express both prostanoid IP and FP receptors (which negatively regulate the spontaneous beating rate) and prostanoid TP, DP(1) and EP(1) receptors (which positively regulate the spontaneous beating rate)."

Deletion of Bax and Bak causes marked resistance to death stimuli in a variety of cell types. Bax−/−Bak−/− mice are predominantly non-viable and survivors exhibit multiple developmental abnormalities characterized by cellular excess, including accumulation of neural progenitor cells in the periventricular, hippocampal, cerebellar and olfactory bulb regions of the brain. To explore the long-term pathophysiological consequences of BAX/BAK deficiency in a stem cell niche, we generated Bak−/− mice with conditional deletion of Bax in Nestin-positive cells. Aged NestinCreBaxfl/flBak−/− mice manifest progressive brain enlargement with a profound accumulation of NeuN- and Sox2-positive neural progenitor cells within the subventricular zone (SVZ). One-third of the mice develop frank masses comprised of neural progenitors, and in 20% of these cases, more aggressive, hypercellular tumors emerged. Unexpectedly, 60% of NestinCreBaxfl/flBak−/− mice harbored high-grade tumors within the testis, a peripheral site of Nestin expression. This in vivo model of severe apoptotic blockade highlights the constitutive role of BAX/BAK in long-term regulation of Nestin-positive progenitor cell pools, with loss of function predisposing to adult-onset tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2071746117,"Calcium-binding protein 7 (CaBP7) is a member of the calmodulin (CaM) superfamily that harbors two high affinity EF-hand motifs and a C-terminal transmembrane domain. CaBP7 has been previously shown to interact with and modulate phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III-β (PI4KIIIβ) activity in in vitro assays and affects vesicle transport in neurons when overexpressed. Here we show that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of CaBP7 is sufficient to mediate the interaction of CaBP7 with PI4KIIIβ. CaBP7 NTD encompasses the two high affinity Ca(2+) binding sites, and structural characterization through multiangle light scattering, circular dichroism, and NMR reveals unique properties for this domain. CaBP7 NTD binds specifically to Ca(2+) but not Mg(2+) and undergoes significant conformational changes in both secondary and tertiary structure upon Ca(2+) binding. The Ca(2+)-bound form of CaBP7 NTD is monomeric and exhibits an open conformation similar to that of CaM. Ca(2+)-bound CaBP7 NTD has a solvent-exposed hydrophobic surface that is more expansive than observed in CaM or CaBP1. Within this hydrophobic pocket, there is a significant reduction in the number of methionine residues that are conserved in CaM and CaBP1 and shown to be important for target recognition. In CaBP7 NTD, these residues are replaced with isoleucine and leucine residues with branched side chains that are intrinsically more rigid than the flexible methionine side chain. We propose that these differences in surface hydrophobicity, charge, and methionine content may be important in determining highly specific interactions of CaBP7 with target proteins, such as PI4KIIIβ."
