https://openalex.org/W2592958909,"Stem-cell-based therapies can potentially reverse organ dysfunction and diseases, but the removal of impaired tissue and activation of a program leading to organ regeneration pose major challenges. In mice, a 4-day fasting mimicking diet (FMD) induces a stepwise expression of Sox17 and Pdx-1, followed by Ngn3-driven generation of insulin-producing β cells, resembling that observed during pancreatic development. FMD cycles restore insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis in both type 2 and type 1 diabetes mouse models. In human type 1 diabetes pancreatic islets, fasting conditions reduce PKA and mTOR activity and induce Sox2 and Ngn3 expression and insulin production. The effects of the FMD are reversed by IGF-1 treatment and recapitulated by PKA and mTOR inhibition. These results indicate that a FMD promotes the reprogramming of pancreatic cells to restore insulin generation in islets from T1D patients and reverse both T1D and T2D phenotypes in mouse models.

We determined a 3.2 Å crystal structure of the A1-AR bound to the selective covalent antagonist, DU172, and identified striking differences to the previously solved adenosine A2A receptor (A2A-AR) structure. Mutational and computational analysis of A1-AR revealed a distinct conformation of the second extracellular loop and a wider extracellular cavity with a secondary binding pocket that can accommodate orthosteric and allosteric ligands. We propose that conformational differences in these regions, rather than amino-acid divergence, underlie drug selectivity between these adenosine receptor subtypes. Our findings provide a molecular basis for AR subtype selectivity with implications for understanding the mechanisms governing allosteric modulation of these receptors, allowing the design of more selective agents for the treatment of ischemia-reperfusion injury, renal pathologies, and neuropathic pain.

Our findings provide a molecular basis for AR subtype selectivity with implications for understanding the mechanisms governing allosteric modulation of these receptors, allowing the design of more selective agents for the treatment of ischemia-reperfusion injury, renal pathologies, and neuropathic pain. The purine nucleoside, adenosine, is a vital cytoprotective molecule mediating effects through activation of four subtypes of Class A G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the A1, A2A, A2B, and A3 adenosine receptors (ARs) (Fredholm et al., 2011Fredholm B.B. IJzerman A.P. Jacobson K.A. Linden J. Müller C.E. International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology. LXXXI. Nomenclature and classification of adenosine receptors--an update.Pharmacol. Rev. 2011; 63: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Given the broad distribution of ARs in the central nervous system and the periphery, strategies for enhancing or inhibiting the activity of ARs have been pursued for potential treatments of disorders associated with cardiovascular function, blood flow, anxiety, dementia, Parkinson’s disease, pain, respiration, sleep, inflammation, and immunity (Jacobson and Gao, 2006Jacobson K.A. Gao Z.-G. Adenosine receptors as therapeutic targets.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, very few AR drug candidates have successfully progressed through clinical trials. One reason for this failure is the widespread distribution of ARs. If a drug candidate has insufficient selectivity for a given AR subtype, then the potential exists for off-target side-effects (Chen et al., 2013Chen J.-F. Eltzschig H.K. Fredholm B.B. Adenosine receptors as drug targets--what are the challenges?.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2013; 12: 265-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Even when appropriate selectivity can be achieved, a second reason for drug candidate failures is that, like most GPCRs, ARs couple to multiple signaling pathways and can thus mediate both beneficial and undesirable effects, depending on the pathway. In this regard, the A1-AR is a key model for addressing these challenges. For instance, A1-AR activation can reduce cardiac and renal ischemia reperfusion injury, atrial fibrillation, and neuropathic pain (Jacobson and Gao, 2006Jacobson K.A. Gao Z.-G. Adenosine receptors as therapeutic targets.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar), whereas inhibition of A1-ARs may prove useful for developing potassium sparing diuretics or cognition enhancers (Müller and Jacobson, 2011Müller C.E. Jacobson K.A. Recent developments in adenosine receptor ligands and their potential as novel drugs.BBA - Biomembranes. 2011; 1808: 1290-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, clinical trials of A1-AR selective agonists for ischemic heart disease have failed predominantly due to dose-limiting on-target bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and hypotension (Braunwald, 2011Braunwald E.

Alternative paths are thus required for improving drug action at the A1-AR. One approach is to selectively target allosteric sites, which are spatially distinct from the orthosteric site and can also promote conformational states that emphasize beneficial signaling while minimizing on-target adverse effects—a phenomenon referred to as “biased agonism” (Changeux and Christopoulos, 2016Changeux J.-P.

Christopoulos A. Signalling bias in new drug discovery: detection, quantification and therapeutic impact.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2013; 12: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Indeed, the A1-AR possesses at least one allosteric site (Bruns and Fergus, 1990Bruns R.F. Fergus J.H. Allosteric enhancement of adenosine A1 receptor binding and function by 2-amino-3-benzoylthiophenes.Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 939-949PubMed Google Scholar) that has been exploited to promote biased agonism (Valant et al., 2014Valant C. May L.T. Aurelio L. Chuo C.H. White P.J. Baltos J.A. Sexton P.M.

However, despite mutational analyses implicating the extracellular regions of the A1-AR in allosteric modulator action (Kennedy et al., 2014Kennedy D.P. McRobb F.M. Leonhardt S.A. Purdy M. Figler H.

Pharmacol. 2012; 84: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the precise location of this site remains undetermined, as do mechanisms underlying A1-AR allostery. A second major avenue for improving GPCR drug selectivity is to exploit recent breakthroughs in structural biology that may guide structure-based drug design (Jazayeri et al., 2015Jazayeri A.

Unfortunately, the low sequence identity between A2A- and A1-ARs, especially in the extracellular loops, makes homology modeling of this region unreliable. In contrast, there exists a very high conservation of residues between the A1- and A2A-ARs in the orthosteric site, yet this fact is difficult to reconcile with the known array of subtype-selective agonists and antagonists that have been reported for these receptors. Here, we present the high-resolution crystal structure of the A1-AR in complex with a covalent antagonist, DU172 (originally published as ‘compound 23a’ in Beauglehole et al., 2000Beauglehole A.R. Baker S.P. Scammells P.J. Fluorosulfonyl-substituted xanthines as selective irreversible antagonists for the A(1)-adenosine receptor.J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 4973-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Compared to the A2A-AR, the A1-AR possesses a more open binding site cavity that can accommodate orthosteric and allosteric ligands. We propose that spatial differences due to rearrangements of TMs 1, 2, 3, 7, ECL3, and a single amino acid substitution at position 270, rather than specific differences in residues lining the orthosteric binding pocket, underlie drug selectivity between A1- and A2A-ARs and offer an alternative template for AR structure-based drug design. To aid with A1-AR expression, 22 amino acids of the human M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor N terminus, containing 3 N-glycosylation sites, were inserted before the A1-AR N terminus, followed by a 3C protease cleavage site (Figure 1A). To promote A1-AR crystallization, a thermostable apocytochrome b562RIL (BRIL) (Chun et al., 2012Chun E. Thompson A.A. Liu W. Roth C.B. Griffith M.T. Katritch V. Kunken J. Xu F. Cherezov V. Hanson M.A. Stevens R.C. Fusion partner toolchest for the stabilization and crystallization of G protein-coupled receptors.Structure. 2012; 20: 967-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) was inserted into the third intracellular loop 3 (ICL3) between residues 211 and 220 (all numbering is relative to the unmodified human A1-AR: “A1wt-AR”); the A1-AR C terminus was truncated after amino acid 311 by inserting a 3C protease cleavage site, and a single A1-AR N-glycosylated residue, N159, was mutated to alanine. For optimization of the BRIL insertion sites, we also substituted amino acids 220–228 of the A1-AR with those of the A2A-AR. Importantly, unmodified A1wt, “A1expr” (before 3C cleavage), and “A1cryst” (crystallized construct) showed no difference in binding affinities for the A1-AR antagonist DPCPX or the irreversible antagonist DU172 (Figures 1B, 1C, S1, and Table S1), although A1cryst displayed a lower Bmax, most likely reflecting variability in the transient transfections used for these experiments. As noted previously with T4 lysozyme fusions of the A2A-AR or β2 adrenergic receptors (Jaakola et al., 2008Jaakola V.-P. Griffith M.T. Hanson M.A. Cherezov V. Chien E.Y.T. Lane J.R. Ijzerman A.P.

GPCR engineering yields high-resolution structural insights into beta2-adrenergic receptor function.Science. 2007; 318: 1266-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar), the engineered A1-AR constructs exhibited higher affinity for agonists, in this instance, NECA and R-PIA (Figure 1C and Table S2). However, consistent with findings at the A2A-AR (Liu et al., 2012Liu W. Chun E. Thompson A.A. Chubukov P. Xu F. Katritch V. Han G.W. Roth C.B. Heitman L.H. IJzerman A.P. et al.Structural basis for allosteric regulation of GPCRs by sodium ions.Science. 2012; 337: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar), BRIL insertion into the A1-AR ICL3 prevented G protein coupling, resulting in no functional response (Figure 1D).Figure S1Selective A1-AR Ligands Investigated in This Study, Related to Figures 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, S2, S6, and S7View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Subsequently, we tested a variety of non- and subtype-selective AR agonists and antagonists for their ability to increase the melting temperature (Tm) of the A1-AR in a thermal stability assay (Figure S2) (Alexandrov et al., 2008Alexandrov A.I. Mileni M. Chien E.Y.T. Hanson M.A. Stevens R.C. Microscale fluorescent thermal stability assay for membrane proteins.Structure. 2008; 16: 351-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Among all the ligands tested, only highly selective A1-AR antagonists substantially increased the stability of the A1-AR construct used for crystallization. The covalent compounds, FSCPX and DU172, promoted the largest increase in thermal stability (∼16°C), and due to the higher chemical stability of DU172 compared to FSCPX (Beauglehole et al., 2000Beauglehole A.R. Baker S.P. Scammells P.J. Fluorosulfonyl-substituted xanthines as selective irreversible antagonists for the A(1)-adenosine receptor.J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 4973-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), DU172 was used in all subsequent crystallization trials. The A1-AR·DU172 complex was crystallized in a lipid cubic phase. Data from 29 crystals were merged together, yielding a dataset at 3.2 Å resolution (Figures 2 and S3 and Table S3). The A1-AR crystallized with two receptor copies per asymmetric unit in parallel orientations (Figure S3). Overall, electron density maps were of good quality with well-resolved amino acid side chains, with the exception of poor density around BRIL in chain A. Interestingly, we noted two types of receptor-receptor interfaces (Figure 3). The first was a non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry interface (Figures 3A, 3B, S3A, and S3C) stabilized through contacts at the extracellular side of TM3 through a π-π interaction between two Y763.21 residues in chains A and B, an interaction between two H783.23 residues (superscript refers to Ballesteros-Weinstein numbering [Ballesteros and Weinstein, 1995Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Integrated methods for the construction of three-dimensional models and computational probing of structure-function relations in G protein-coupled receptors.Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2471) Google Scholar]). and an unidentified molecule (a 12σ blob in the Fo-Fc map). A second, more extensive, interface between two adjacent A1-AR molecules (Figures 3C, 3D, S3B, and S3C) occurs between crystallographic symmetry mates of chain A (between repeating units within a crystal), which buries a large hydrophobic area of TM4 and TM5 (860 Å2) with a number of residues, V1374.55, F1444.62, W1464.64, Y1825.40, F1835.41, V1875.45, and W1885.46, forming hydrophobic contacts bringing both ECL2s in close proximity (Figure 3D). Interestingly, a recent mutagenesis study (Nguyen et al., 2016aNguyen A.T. Baltos J.-A. Thomas T. Nguyen T.D. Muñoz L.L. Gregory K.J. White P.J. Sexton P.M. Christopoulos A. May L.T. Extracellular loop 2 of the adenosine A1 receptor has a key role in orthosteric ligand affinity and agonist efficacy.Mol. Pharmacol. 2016; 90: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) identified resides of the A1AR ECL2 (N148, E153, S150, R154, and W156) to be key determinants in the signaling efficacy of the orthosteric agonist, NECA. Our structure now reveals that all of these residues are located in the A1-AR ECL2 helical region, with R154 and S150 in particular (Figure 3D) forming contacts between ECL2 loops of two A1AR monomers. This finding provides a possible structural explanation for why these residues are key to agonist efficacy, particularly in the context of an emerging view that ECL2 can contribute to the transition of GPCRs between different active states (Avlani et al., 2007Avlani V.A. Gregory K.J. Morton C.J. Parker M.W. Sexton P.M. Christopoulos A.

Collectively, and in light of another recent study suggesting that the A1-AR could form homodimers capable of cooperative orthosteric ligand binding (Gracia et al., 2013Gracia E. Moreno E. Cortés A. Lluís C. Mallol J. McCormick P.J. Canela E.I. Casadó V. Homodimerization of adenosine A1 receptors in brain cortex explains the biphasic effects of caffeine.Neuropharmacology. 2013; 71: 56-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), this interface is an attractive target for future investigation, but additional pharmacological experiments will be required to confirm that observed interaction is physiologically relevant rather than an artifact of crystallization.Figure S3Crystals and Crystal Packing of the A1-AR, Related to Figures 2 and 3Show full caption(A–C) Contacts within the A1-AR crystals.

(C and D) Crystallographic contacts featuring extensive hydrophobic contacts between two A1-AR monomers in parallel orientation. See also Figure S3. Overall, the structure of the A1-AR is typical of other Class A GPCRs crystallized in an inactive conformation (Figures 2A and 2C) with a partially formed “ionic lock” (Figure S4) that constrains GPCRs in an inactive state and may thus explain why the A1-AR displays relatively low constitutive activity (Savinainen et al., 2003Savinainen J.R. Saario S.M. Niemi R. Järvinen T. Laitinen J.T. An optimized approach to study endocannabinoid signaling: evidence against constitutive activity of rat brain adenosine A1 and cannabinoid CB1 receptors.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 140: 1451-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). There is little difference intracellularly, with the exception of a 2 Å outward shift of TM5 and TM6 at the BRIL insertion site due to crystal contacts (Figure 2C). However, the extracellular ends of the TM helices move considerably compared to the A2A-AR (Figure 2B), with lateral movements of TMs 1, 2, 3, and 7. A highly conserved Class A GPCR disulphide bond (C803.25 and C169) tethers ECL2 to TM3 (Figure 2D), and an additional disulphide, C260-C263 (Figure 2B), present in both A1- and A2A-ARs, “staples” ECL3. The compact arrangement of the TM bundle of the A2A-AR might thus be the result of its unique disulphide bond, C74-C146, tethering the beginning of TM3 to the end of ECL2 (Figure 2D). Lack of this interaction in the A1-AR allows for shifts in TMs 1, 2, and 3. TM7 also tilts toward TM6, possibly as a result of a shorter ECL3 in the A1-AR due to the deletion of one amino acid. The most striking difference between the A1- and A2A-ARs is the conformation of their ECL2s (Figure 2D). In both chains A and B of the A1-AR, ECL2 is well resolved and adopts an identical orientation despite different crystallographic environments, indicating that the observed loop conformation is not a crystallographic artifact nor is it influenced by the location of the BRIL fusion (which is more than 10 Å away). Of note, ECL2 residues from N148 to S161 form a longer helix compared to the A2A-AR (from K150 to G158) (Figure 2E), extending it away from the A1-AR transmembrane regions and almost perpendicular to the plane of the membrane (Figure 2D). This conformation likely results from the absence of another A2A-AR disulphide bond (between C71 and C159) in the A1-AR, which tethers the A2A-AR ECL2 helix to ECL1. Instead, it is partially compensated for by the presence of a salt bridge between E164 and H783.24 on TM3 in the A1-AR, which stabilizes a short β sheet between amino acids 75–77 of ECL1 and 165–167 of ECL2 (Figure 2D). Interestingly, the helical part of ECL2 in previously solved β1 and β2 adrenergic receptors also adopts a conformation parallel to the plane of the membrane due to intra-loop disulphides. As such, the presence of extra disulphide bonds likely serves to restrict the mobility of ECL2 in β1, β2, and A2A receptors, whereas this is not the case for the A1-AR. The electron density for the covalent antagonist, DU172, allowed for its unambiguous placement within the binding site of the A1-AR and identified Y2717.36 as the site of covalent attachment via a benzenesulfonate linkage (Figure 4A and Figure S5). Key interactions with the ligand are formed via residues located on TMs 1, 3, 6, 7, and ECL2 (Figure 4C). Compared to the orientation of ZM241385 in A2A-AR structures (Hino et al., 2012Hino T.

Despite different orientations of the xanthine ring relative to the triazolo-triazine substructure of ZM241385, key interactions anchoring the ligand in the binding site are preserved, including a π-stacking interaction with F171 (F168 in A2A-AR) and a bidentate hydrogen bond with N2546.55 (Figures 4B–4F and S5). However, the chemical nature of DU172 leads to formation of a different set of H bonds with residue N6.55. In the A2A-AR, N2536.55 contacts the oxygen of the furan ring and the amine substituent of the triazine ring of ZM241385; the corresponding N2546.55 in A1-AR interacts with the 6-oxy group and N7 of the DU172 xanthine ring (Figure 4B). This H-bonding shift results in DU172 positioning deeper in the A1-AR orthosteric site compared to ZM241385 in the A2A-AR. DU172 is further stabilized by an H bond of the amide linker with Y121.35, which can explain why DU172-like FSCPX derivatives, in which the amide linker was exchanged to two methylenes, display lower affinity for the A1-AR (Beauglehole et al., 2000Beauglehole A.R.

We describe here the synthesis and testing of potential small-molecule pan-RAS ligands, which were designed to interact with adjacent sites on the surface of oncogenic KRAS. One compound, termed 3144, was found to bind to RAS proteins using microscale thermophoresis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry and to exhibit lethality in cells partially dependent on expression of RAS proteins. This compound was metabolically stable in liver microsomes and displayed anti-tumor activity in xenograft mouse cancer models. These findings suggest that pan-RAS inhibition may be an effective therapeutic strategy for some cancers and that structure-based design of small molecules targeting multiple adjacent sites to create multivalent inhibitors may be effective for some proteins."

Arabidopsis HAP2 (GCS1) is a sperm-specific gene required for pollen tube guidance and fertilization.Development. 2006; 133: 4761-4769Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). A screen for genes essential for gamete fusion in the green alga Chlamydomonas independently uncovered HAP2, showing that it is expressed only in minus gametes and is exclusively present on an apically localized membrane protuberance termed the minus mating structure (Liu et al., 2008Liu Y. Tewari R. Ning J. Blagborough A.M. Garbom S. Pei J. Grishin N.V. Steele R.E. Sinden R.E. Snell W.J. Billker O.

Studies in Chlamydomonas and Plasmodium (the pathogen causing malaria in humans) revealed that hap2 mutant gametes in both organisms were fully capable of robust adhesion to gametes of the opposite mating type or sex, but merger of the lipid bilayers was abrogated (Liu et al., 2008Liu Y.

In both organisms, adhesion relies on proteins that are species-limited: FUS1 in Chlamydomonas plus gametes and its unidentified receptor in minus gametes (Misamore et al., 2003Misamore M.J. Gupta S. Snell W.J. The Chlamydomonas Fus1 protein is present on the mating type plus fusion organelle and required for a critical membrane adhesion event during fusion with minus gametes.Mol. Biol.

Based on these findings, which have since been confirmed in Arabidopsis thaliana (Mori et al., 2014Mori T. Igawa T. Tamiya G. Miyagishima S.Y. Berger F.

Biol. 2014; 24: 170-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila (Cole et al., 2014Cole E.S. Cassidy-Hanley D. Fricke Pinello J. Zeng H. Hsueh M. Kolbin D. Ozzello C. Giddings Jr., T. Winey M. Clark T.G. Function of the male-gamete-specific fusion protein HAP2 in a seven-sexed ciliate.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 2168-2173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), a model emerged positing that HAP2, a single-pass transmembrane protein, functions after species-limited adhesion in the membrane fusion process between gametes (Liu et al., 2008Liu Y. Tewari R. Ning J. Blagborough A.M. Garbom S. Pei J. Grishin N.V. Steele R.E. Sinden R.E. Snell W.J. Billker O. The conserved plant sterility gene HAP2 functions after attachment of fusogenic membranes in Chlamydomonas and Plasmodium gametes.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1051-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in all of these organisms, HAP2 is required in only one of the two gametes, raising the possibility that it may function similarly to fusion proteins of enveloped viruses (Wong and Johnson, 2010Wong J.L. Johnson M.A. Is HAP2-GCS1 an ancestral gamete fusogen?.Trends Cell Biol. 2010; 20: 134-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, Harrison, 2015Harrison S.C. Viral membrane fusion.Virology. 2015; 479-480: 498-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). To understand the function of HAP2 at the molecular level we carried out concerted bioinformatic, functional, and X-ray structural analyses of HAP2 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Initial bioinformatic analyses identified weak similarity to class II fusion proteins, revealing a segment within a cysteine-rich portion of HAP2 that could potentially correspond to the fusion loop. We demonstrate by mutational analysis and fusion-blocking antibodies targeting this segment that it has elements that are essential for HAP2 function. Finally, we show that the recombinant HAP2 ectodomain is monomeric, but inserts into liposomes by concomitantly forming trimers, the X-ray structure of which revealed a class II fusion protein fold in the typical trimeric post-fusion “hairpin” conformation. HAP2 has 16 conserved cysteine residues with a signature distribution in the ectodomain (Figure 1B). Early alignments of HAP2 family members identified a characteristic ∼50 aa domain (residues 352–399 in Chlamydomonas HAP2) with several conserved residues that was designated the HAP2/GCS1 PFAM domain (PF10699) (see http://pfam.xfam.org/family/pf10699) (Finn et al., 2016Finn R.D. Coggill P. Eberhardt R.Y. Eddy S.R. Mistry J. Mitchell A.L. Potter S.C. Punta M. Qureshi M. Sangrador-Vegas A. et al.The Pfam protein families database: towards a more sustainable future.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: D279-D285Crossref PubMed Scopus (3565) Google Scholar). A previous mutagenesis analysis in Chlamydomonas failed to identify functional properties in the PF10699 domain, as the mutant proteins tested either were not transported to the mating structure, or were nearly indistinguishable from wild-type in their ability to support fusion with plus gametes (Liu et al., 2015Liu Y. Pei J. Grishin N. Snell W.J. The cytoplasmic domain of the gamete membrane fusion protein HAP2 targets the protein to the fusion site in Chlamydomonas and regulates the fusion reaction.Development. 2015; 142: 962-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Database searches for additional conserved regions using the HHpred protein homology detection server (Söding et al., 2005Söding J. Biegert A. Lupas A.N. The HHpred interactive server for protein homology detection and structure prediction.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 (W244–248)Crossref Scopus (2631) Google Scholar) indicated that a cysteine-rich region in the N-terminal half of the ectodomain exhibited weak similarity to class II fusion proteins. In particular, HHpred identified a polypeptide segment in C. reinhardtii HAP2 (170–204, SQVWDDTFGSSKERTRANLDCDFWSDPLDILIGRK) that fell in the fusion loop region of the flavivirus envelope protein E in the resultant amino-acid-sequence alignment (Figure S1). Analysis of HAP2 orthologs showed that the sequence in this region is highly variable, with a number of deletions and insertions and is framed at each side by relatively conserved segments: amino acids (aa) 159–167 upstream (including conserved cysteines 5–7) and aa 208–219 downstream (including conserved cysteine 9) (Figures 1B and 1C). Only amino acids R185 and C190 (in bold in the sequence above) within the identified segment are conserved, suggesting that they may play a role in HAP2 function. To investigate the functional importance of this segment we transformed Chlamydomonas wild-type (WT) or mutant HAP2 transgenes carrying an influenza virus hemagglutinin tag (HA) into a fusion-defective, hap2 mutant strain (Liu et al., 2008Liu Y. Tewari R. Ning J. Blagborough A.M. Garbom S. Pei J. Grishin N.V. Steele R.E. Sinden R.E. Snell W.J. Billker O. The conserved plant sterility gene HAP2 functions after attachment of fusogenic membranes in Chlamydomonas and Plasmodium gametes.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1051-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and assessed HAP2-HA expression and trafficking to the mating structure as well as fusion of the transformed hap2 minus gametes with WT plus gametes. HAP2-HA was detected in hap2 minus gametes transformed with WT HAP2-HA as the expected doublet in SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting (Figure 1D), the upper form of which was present on the cell surface as assessed by its sensitivity to protease treatment of live gametes (Liu et al., 2008Liu Y. Tewari R. Ning J. Blagborough A.M. Garbom S. Pei J. Grishin N.V. Steele R.E. Sinden R.E. Snell W.J. Billker O. The conserved plant sterility gene HAP2 functions after attachment of fusogenic membranes in Chlamydomonas and Plasmodium gametes.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1051-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). All mutant proteins were expressed at levels similar to wild-type HAP2-HA (Figure 1D), trafficked to the cell surface as assessed by their sensitivity to trypsin treatment of live gametes (examples shown in Figure 1E), and localized at the mating structure (example shown in Figure 1F). Thus, any defects in gamete fusion could be ascribed directly to the functional properties of the mutant HAP2 proteins. HAP2 with a deletion of residues 184TRA186 (HAP2-ΔTRA-HA), which includes the conserved R185 was non-functional and failed to rescue fusion in the hap2 mutant when mixed with wild-type plus gametes (Figure 1D). A mutant HAP2 with a lysine sustituted for the conserved R185 (the HAP2-R185K-HA mutant) was fully functional, whereas the HAP2-R185A-HA or HAP2-R185Q-HA mutants failed to rescue fusion (Figure 1D). A reverse-order HAP2-RA185-86 mutant (HAP2-R185A-A186R-HA) also was non-functional, indicating that a positively charged residue at position 185 is essential for the fusion activity. Finally, hap2 minus gametes expressing HAP2-F192A-W193A-HA were impaired in fusion, although fusion was not abolished by these mutations, indicating that these nearby aromatic residues also play a role in HAP2 fusion function (Figure 1D). Thus, the segment HAP2170-204, bounded by a pair of conserved cysteines, contains residues that are dispensable for protein expression, folding and localization, but are essential for the membrane fusion activity. In an independent approach to examine the function of the HHpred-identified region, we generated a rabbit antibody against a synthetic peptide, HAP2168-190, spanning the functionally important R185 residue. The affinity-purified antibody (α-HAP2168-190) immunoprecipitated epitope-tagged HAP2-HA from lysates of HAP2-HA minus gametes (Figure 2A), confirming its reactivity with HAP2. To test whether α-HAP2168-190 interfered with gamete fusion, we incubated minus gametes with undiluted antibody, mixed them with plus gametes, and determined the percentage of gametes that had fused to form zygotes. Pre-incubation of minus gametes with α-HAP2168-190 had no effect on motility or adhesion but inhibited gamete fusion by over 75%, whereas pre-incubation with a control IgG had no effect on fusion (Figures 2B and 2C). Antibody dilution resulted in a loss of fusion-blocking activity, suggesting a low concentration of HAP2-specific antibodies in the polyclonal mixture, probably due to a low immunogenicity of the synthetic peptide. Pre-incubation of plus gametes with the antibody did not affect their ability to fuse; and the fusion-blocking activity of α-HAP2168-190 was neutralized by pre-incubation with the HAP2168-190 peptide, but not with a control peptide (Figure 2C), further documenting the specificity of the antibody. Finally, immunolocalization experiments using an anti-HA antibody showed that HAP2-HA on α-HAP2168-190-treated minus gametes remained at the mating structure (Figure 2D), indicating that α-HAP2168-190 did not alter HAP2 localization, but directly interfered with its function. These functional studies with Chlamydomonas mutant gametes and the anti-peptide antibody indicated that in its native conformation on live gametes, the 168–190 segment of HAP2 is accessible at the protein surface and its integrity and availability are essential for fusion of gametes. We used a Drosophila expression system to produce a soluble form of C. reinhardtii HAP2 aa 23–592 (comprising almost the entire ectodomain, Figure 1B) and purified it to homogeneity (see STAR Methods; Figure S2). Analysis by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and multi-angle static laser light-scattering (MALLS; Figure S2) showed that the protein behaved as a monomer in solution (fraction labeled HAP2e), but had a tendency to oligomerize with time (especially under high ionic strength conditions) to elute at a volume corresponding roughly to hexamers (HAP2eh fraction in Figure S2). The purified protein from the HAP2e monomeric fraction efficiently neutralized the fusion-inhibition potential of the α-HAP2168-190 antibody (Figure 2C), indicating that at least part of the 168–190 segment is exposed in HAP2e and accessible to the antibody. To detect membrane insertion, we incubated the recombinant protein with liposomes of a standard lipid composition (see STAR Methods) and monitored binding by co-flotation on a sucrose gradient (Figure 3E) followed by immunoblot detection of lipid-inserted HAP2e using a monoclonal antibody raised against HAP2e (mAb K3; see Figure S2; STAR Methods). We observed efficient co-flotation of the monomeric HAP2e fraction (Figure 3E), but not of the multimeric HAP2eh fraction (not shown). Electron microscopy analysis showed that HAP2e decorated the liposome surface as projecting rods about 12 nm long (Figures 3B–3D), which are similar to those formed by viral class II fusion proteins in their trimeric, post-fusion form, such as the alphavirus E1 protein (Gibbons et al., 2003Gibbons D.L. Erk I. Reilly B. Navaza J. Kielian M. Rey F.A. Lepault J. Visualization of the target-membrane-inserted fusion protein of Semliki Forest virus by combined electron microscopy and crystallography.Cell. 2003; 114: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The size and shape of membrane-bound HAP2e suggested that it had also oligomerized upon membrane insertion. Of note, 3-fold symmetry was apparent in some top views of unbound proteins present in the background (Figure 3D, arrowheads). We confirmed that HAP2e had indeed trimerized upon membrane insertion by detergent-solubilizing it from the liposomes and analyzing it by native PAGE (Figure 3F) and by SEC (Figure S3). These results indicated that HAP2e behaves similarly to the alphaviruses and flaviviruses class II proteins, with membrane insertion concomitant with trimerization of a monomeric pre-fusion form (Klimjack et al., 1994Klimjack M.R.

Virol. 2002; 76: 3784-3790Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), except that HAP2e did not require an acidic environment for lipid binding and trimerization. This difference is in line with the ability of HAP2 to induce gamete fusion in the extracellular environment, whereas alpha- and flaviviruses require the acidic environment of an endosome for fusion.Figure S3Lipid Insertion of HAP2, Related to Figure 3Show full captionRecombinant C. reinhardtii HAP2 was subjected to SEC on a Superdex 200 column and the fraction eluting as monomer (HAP2e, peak on the right in the blue curve) was mixed with liposomes and loaded onto a sucrose gradient (as in Figure 3E). Upon centrifugation (see STAR Methods), the fraction recovered from the top of the gradient was again run in the same SEC column (red plot). This time the elution profile showed a major peak of UV 280 nm absorption near the void volume, likely resulting from the UV absorption of large mixed detergent/lipid micelles, as SDS-PAGE analysis of the individual elution fractions of the SEC column followed by Coomassie staining (shown below the profile) revealed that this peak contained no protein. The protein bands in the other fractions were quantified and the amount of HAP2e in the individual fractions is shown in the superposed histogram, indicating that solubilized HAP2e elutes from the column in between the peaks corresponding to the monomeric and the hexameric HAP2e fraction, as expected for a trimer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Recombinant C. reinhardtii HAP2 was subjected to SEC on a Superdex 200 column and the fraction eluting as monomer (HAP2e, peak on the right in the blue curve) was mixed with liposomes and loaded onto a sucrose gradient (as in Figure 3E).

This time the elution profile showed a major peak of UV 280 nm absorption near the void volume, likely resulting from the UV absorption of large mixed detergent/lipid micelles, as SDS-PAGE analysis of the individual elution fractions of the SEC column followed by Coomassie staining (shown below the profile) revealed that this peak contained no protein. The protein bands in the other fractions were quantified and the amount of HAP2e in the individual fractions is shown in the superposed histogram, indicating that solubilized HAP2e elutes from the column in between the peaks corresponding to the monomeric and the hexameric HAP2e fraction, as expected for a trimer. Because the co-flotation experiments demanded relatively high amounts of purified recombinant protein for detection, it was impractical to assess flotation inhibition by the undiluted polyclonal α-HAP2168-190 antibody. But we tested the effect of the mutations described in Figure 1 by recombinantly expressing the mutant HAP2 ectodomains. These experiments showed that the mutations that impaired gamete fusion also affected the co-flotation capacity of the mutant HAP2e (Figure 3G). The R185K HAP2e mutant co-floated with liposomes as efficiently as wild-type, whereas those in which the charge at position 185 was removed—the R185A and R185Q mutants—co-floated poorly (Figure 3G). Co-flotation with the liposomes was also essentially abrogated with the HAP2e-ΔTRA and HAP2e-F192A-W193A mutants. The combination of the in vivo (Figures 1 and 2) and in vitro (Figure 3) analyses indicates that HAP2 has the capacity to directly interact with membranes and that altering the conserved residues of the HHpred-identified segment affects this interaction. We obtained crystals of HAP2e diffracting to a maximum resolution of 3.3 Å. Details of the crystallization and structure determination are described in the STAR Methods, and the crystallographic statistics are listed in Table S1. We determined the X-ray structure by the single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS) method using a PtCl4 derivative. The experimental electron density map allowed the tracing of 442 amino acids out of 569 in the HAP2e expression construct (aa 23–592; Figure 1B) from amino acids 24 to 581 with internal breaks at several disordered loops (listed in the STAR Methods). The atomic model of C. reinhardtii HAP2 revealed a trimer with unambiguous structural homology to class II fusion proteins, featuring the three characteristic β sheet-rich domains, termed I, II, and III, arranged in a “hairpin” conformation typical of class II fusion proteins in their post-fusion form (Bressanelli et al., 2004Bressanelli S.

The overall shape of the HAP2e trimer is totally compatible with the projections from the liposomes observed in the electron micrographs, with the predicted membrane interacting region at the tapered end of the rods (Figures 3C and 3D).

https://openalex.org/W2594204182,"Regulatory variation influencing gene expression is a key contributor to phenotypic diversity, both within and between species. Unfortunately, RNA degrades too rapidly to be recovered from fossil remains, limiting functional genomic insights about our extinct hominin relatives. Many Neanderthal sequences survive in modern humans due to ancient hybridization, providing an opportunity to assess their contributions to transcriptional variation and to test hypotheses about regulatory evolution. We developed a flexible Bayesian statistical approach to quantify allele-specific expression (ASE) in complex RNA-seq datasets. We identified widespread expression differences between Neanderthal and modern human alleles, indicating pervasive cis-regulatory impacts of introgression. Brain regions and testes exhibited significant downregulation of Neanderthal alleles relative to other tissues, consistent with natural selection influencing the tissue-specific regulatory landscape. Our study demonstrates that Neanderthal-inherited sequences are not silent remnants of ancient interbreeding but have measurable impacts on gene expression that contribute to variation in modern human phenotypes."

We aimed to evaluate the epidemiologic features of HF patients, the 1-year follow-up outcomes and the independent predictors of those outcomes at a population level. Methods and results Population-based longitudinal study including all prevalent HF cases in Catalonia (Spain) on December 31st, 2012. Patients were divided in 3 groups: patients without a previous HF hospitalization, patients with a remote (>1 year) HF hospitalization and patients with a recent (<1 year) HF admission. We analyzed 1year all-cause and HF hospitalizations, and all-cause mortality. Logistic regression was used to identify the independent predictors of each of those outcomes. A total of 88,195 patients were included. Mean age was 77 years, 55% were women. Comorbidities were frequent. Fourteen percent of patients had never been hospitalized, 71% had a remote HF hospitalization and 15% a recent hospitalization. At 1-year follow-up, all-cause and HF hospitalization were 53% and 8.8%, respectively. One-year all-cause mortality rate was 14%, and was higher in patients with a recent HF hospitalization (24%). The presence of diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation or chronic kidney disease was independently associated with all-cause and HF hospitalization and all-cause mortality. Hospital admissions and emergency department visits the previous year were also found to be independently associated with the three study outcomes. Conclusions Outcomes are different depending on the HF population studied. Some comorbidity, an all-cause hospitalization or emergency department visit the previous year were associated with a worse outcome."

https://openalex.org/W2593242044,"De novo copy number variants (dnCNVs) arising at multiple loci in a personal genome have usually been considered to reflect cancer somatic genomic instabilities. We describe a multiple dnCNV (MdnCNV) phenomenon in which individuals with genomic disorders carry five to ten constitutional dnCNVs. These CNVs originate from independent formation incidences, are predominantly tandem duplications or complex gains, exhibit breakpoint junction features reminiscent of replicative repair, and show increased de novo point mutations flanking the rearrangement junctions. The active CNV mutation shower appears to be restricted to a transient perizygotic period. We propose that a defect in the CNV formation process is responsible for the CNV-mutator state, and this state is dampened after early embryogenesis. The constitutional MdnCNV phenomenon resembles chromosomal instability in various cancers. Investigations of this phenomenon may provide unique access to understanding genomic disorders, structural variant mutagenesis, human evolution, and cancer biology."

Life-threatening staphylococcal disease occurred during childhood in the proband, but not in the other seven homozygotes.

This defective response was reversed in the patient, but not in interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK-4)-deficient individuals, by anti-LTA monoclonal antibody (mAb). Anti-LTA mAb also rescued the macrophage response in mice lacking TIRAP, but not TLR2 or MyD88.

Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive bacterium that colonizes the skin and nostrils of most healthy individuals (Li et al., 2015Li Z. Peres A.G. Damian A.C. Madrenas J.

It is also a common cause of human diseases, ranging from minor cutaneous infections to invasive hematogenous infections, as observed in children and young adults with necrotizing staphylococcal pneumonitis (Gillet et al., 2002Gillet Y. Issartel B. Vanhems P. Fournet J.C. Lina G. Bes M. Vandenesch F. Piémont Y. Brousse N. Floret D. Etienne J.

Most severe staphylococcal diseases remain unexplained. Various acquired immunodeficiencies, including those resulting from infection with HIV, hemodialysis, chemotherapy, intravenous drug use, central catheters and vascular lines, increase the likelihood of severe staphylococcal disease (Lowy, 1998Lowy F.D. Staphylococcus aureus infections.N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 520-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (4627) Google Scholar). The pathogenesis of invasive staphylococcal disease is complex in such settings, often involving neutropenia, skin breaches, or both. Alternatively, severe staphylococcal disease may result from various single-gene inborn errors of immunity, including disorders of phagocytes in particular (Zhang et al., 2015Zhang Y. Su H.C. Lenardo M.J. Genomics is rapidly advancing precision medicine for immunological disorders.Nat. Immunol. 2015; 16: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Disorders of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin (IL)-1R pathway, inborn errors of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), severe congenital neutropenia, chronic granulomatous disease, leukocyte adhesion deficiency, and autosomal dominant hyper immunoglobulin E (IgE) syndrome have all been implicated in severe staphylococcal disease (Bousfiha et al., 2015Bousfiha A. Jeddane L. Al-Herz W. Ailal F. Casanova J.L. Chatila T. Conley M.E. Cunningham-Rundles C. Etzioni A. Franco J.L. et al.The 2015 IUIS phenotypic classification for primary immunodeficiencies.J. Clin. Immunol. 2015; 35: 727-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). All these defects affect phagocytes, albeit in different ways. Clinical features differ between patients with staphylococcal disease, reflecting the diversity of the underlying inborn errors. Autosomal recessive MyD88 and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK-4) deficiencies selectively impair signaling via the TLR and IL-1R pathway (Picard et al., 2003Picard C. Puel A. Bonnet M. Ku C.L. Bustamante J. Yang K. Soudais C. Dupuis S. Feinberg J.

Camcioglu Y. et al.Pyogenic bacterial infections in humans with MyD88 deficiency.Science. 2008; 321: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). More than 80 patients with these deficiencies have been diagnosed worldwide (reviewed in Picard et al., 2010Picard C. von Bernuth H. Ghandil P. Chrabieh M. Levy O. Arkwright P.D. McDonald D. Geha R.S. Takada H. Krause J.C. et al.Clinical features and outcome of patients with IRAK-4 and MyD88 deficiency.Medicine (Baltimore). 2010; 89: 403-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). These patients are susceptible to invasive bacterial infections, particularly those caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, but also those caused by S. aureus. They also develop superficial staphylococcal infections (Picard et al., 2011Picard C. Casanova J.L. Puel A. Infectious diseases in patients with IRAK-4, MyD88, NEMO, or IκBα deficiency.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2011; 24: 490-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Leukocytes from patients with deficiencies of IRAK-4 or MyD88 do not respond to activation via IL-1Rs or TLRs other than TLR3, which signals via toll/IL-1 receptors (TIR)-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF), but not MyD88, and TLR4, which signals via TRIF or MyD88. The molecular and cellular basis of staphylococcal disease in these patients remains unknown. We investigated this aspect by testing the hypothesis that severe staphylococcal disease in otherwise healthy children may be caused by mutations in other genes of the TLR and IL-1R pathway (Casanova, 2015aCasanova J.L.

We investigated a 9-year-old girl admitted to the intensive care unit with pneumonia and sepsis caused by Panton Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-producing S. aureus, at the age of 3 months (P1; V.1; Figure 1A). She was born to consanguineous parents of Pakistani descent living in the United Kingdom. The presumed complete genetic tree was assessed by inferring relationships with King software based on genome-wide SNP genotyping (Manichaikul et al., 2010Manichaikul A. Mychaleckyj J.C. Rich S.S.

Known genetic etiologies of primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) associated with life-threatening staphylococcal diseases were excluded by whole-exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing. We searched for rare variants (minor allele frequency [MAF] < 1%) and identified a homozygous substitution, c.361C > T, in exon 5 of TIRAP, which encodes a TIR-domain-containing adaptor of TLR2 and TLR4 (Fitzgerald et al., 2001Fitzgerald K.A.

We confirmed the TIRAP mutation by Sanger sequencing of P1’s genomic DNA extracted from whole blood cells (WBCs), Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B lymphocytes (EBV-B cells), and SV40-immortalized fibroblasts (SV40 fibroblasts) (Figure 1B). This missense variant results in the replacement of the arginine residue in position 121 of the TIR domain of TIRAP with a tryptophan residue (R121W; Figure 1C). The R121 residue of TIRAP has been strongly conserved throughout evolution (Figure 1D). It is also conserved in 21 of the other 26 human molecules containing a TIR domain identified to date (e.g., R196 in MyD88; Figure S1B). In silico analysis with combined annotation dependent depletion (CADD) and mutation significant cutoff (MSC) predicted that the R121W variant would be deleterious (Itan et al., 2016Itan Y. Shang L.

TIRAP is well conserved in the human population, with a neutrality index of 0.2346 (McDonald and Kreitman, 1991McDonald J.H. Kreitman M.

No other rare or common variants of TIRAP were found in P1. No rare bi-allelic mutations were found in other genes of the TIR pathway, including those encoding individual TLRs and the other three TLR adaptors (TRAM, SARM, and TRIF). Moreover, no other candidate variant was identified in the linkage regions defined by parametric multipoint linkage analysis (STAR Methods section) or among the other 107 non-synonymous rare homozygous variants found in P1 (Table S1). The patient was therefore homozygous for a potentially deleterious rare allele of TIRAP.Figure S1The TIRAP R121W Mutation Is a Rare Mutation Affecting the TIR Domain of TIRAP, with a Modest Impact at the mRNA and Protein Levels, Related to Figure 1Show full captionA.

This variant was not detected in 140 Pakistani individuals from the human genome diversity cell line -Centre d’Étude du Polymorphisme Humain (HGDP-CEPH) panel. Eight heterozygous but no homozygous individuals were reported among 57,085 individuals from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAc) database (MAF = 0.00007). This variant was detected, in the heterozygous state, in 3 of 3,033 individuals (6,066 chromosomes) in our in-house exome database. This patient was therefore homozygous for a rare TIRAP missense allele, with a MAF of less than 1/10,000. Surprisingly, however, seven relatives of P1 were also found to be homozygous for the R121W TIRAP mutation, including the proband’s father (aged 33 years), four of the father’s siblings (aged 20–28 years) and both his parents (aged 53 and 54 years; Figure 1A). None of these individuals carried TIRAP polymorphisms. The proband’s mother and younger sister were heterozygous for the R121W allele. None of these relatives, whether heterozygous or homozygous for the TIRAP allele, had ever suffered from any severe infection, including staphylococcal infections in particular. Thus, eight individuals from a consanguineous Pakistani kindred, including a child with severe staphylococcal infection and seven asymptomatic adults, were homozygous for a rare and probably deleterious TIRAP allele. These data suggested that P1 had autosomal recessive TIRAP deficiency, with incomplete penetrance for severe staphylococcal disease. We therefore investigated whether the eight individuals had TIRAP deficiency and the mechanisms underlying incomplete clinical penetrance. Human TIRAP encodes two isoforms (Figure 1C) generated by four different transcripts. Two transcripts (NCBI: NM_001039661.1 and NM_001318777) encode isoform A, which contains 221 amino acids (aas) (23.8 kDa), whereas the other two transcripts (NCBI: NM_001318776 and NM_148910) encode isoform B, which contains 235 aas (25.3 kDa). The R121W mutation is located in exon 5 of reference transcript (encoding a sequence present in all isoforms). We assessed the impact of the mutation by inserting the wild-type (WT) and R121W alleles into pCDNA3.1-V5 vectors encoding a C-terminally tagged version of each of the isoforms of TIRAP. Following the transient transfection of HEK293T cells, the R121W allele yielded levels of both isoforms (A and B) about 50% lower than those obtained with the WT allele (Figure 1E). This suggested that both R121W TIRAP isoforms were somewhat less stable than the WT isoforms, at least when tagged molecules were overproduced in HEK293T cells. We then evaluated TIRAP mRNA levels for both isoforms by qRT-PCR and RT-PCR in SV40 fibroblasts from P1, her father (R121W/R121W), and her mother (R121W/WT) and by qRT-PCR in EBV-B cells from P1 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from P1 and her aunt (R121W/R121W; Figures 1F, S1C, and S1D). P1, her father, mother, and aunt had mRNA levels within the normal range for the controls, with transcripts encoding isoform A predominating in the three cell types tested and in all individuals tested. We were unable to detect the endogenous expression of either of the two TIRAP isoforms by western blotting (WB) in SV40 fibroblasts from healthy controls, whereas TIRAP protein levels in control EBV-B cells varied considerably between individuals, consistent with the variability of mRNA levels between controls (data not shown; Figure 1F). In PBMCs from healthy controls, only a 24-kDa protein, probably corresponding to isoform A, was detected, consistent with qRT-PCR results (Figure 1G). Homozygous family members had normal levels of this isoform of TIRAP in PBMCs. Overall, these data suggested that the R121W mutation had no detectable impact on mRNA or protein levels in circulating leukocytes. We assessed the subcellular distribution of the mutant TIRAP molecules. Fluorescence microscopy of HEK293T cells transiently transfected with a pcDNA3.1 vector encoding the WT isoform A of TIRAP V5-tagged and labeled with Alexa-488-conjugated anti-V5 antibodies showed WT TIRAP to be present in precise small dots in the cytoplasm, whereas transfection with the R121W TIRAP construct resulted in diffuse cytoplasmic staining (Figure 2A). For the quantification of this subcellular localization phenotype, we cotransfected cells with constructs encoding V5-tagged WT TIRAP and either myc-tagged WT or R121W TIRAP and then assessed the colocalization of the encoded proteins by determining Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) (Figure 2B). WT TIRAP had a PCC of 0.85 for colocalization with itself, whereas its PCC for colocalization with R121W was 0.25 (p < 0.0001). The R121W mutation therefore impaired the subcellular localization of TIRAP. We then investigated whether this cellular localization defect had an impact on the colocalization of TIRAP with its partner, MyD88. We obtained a PCC of 0.6 for the colocalization of WT TIRAP and MyD88, whereas the PCC for the colocalization of R121W TIRAP and MyD88 was 0.2 (Figure 2C; p < 0.0001). These data suggest that the R121W mutation impairs TIRAP trafficking within cells, thereby reducing the accessibility of this molecule to MyD88. Following stimulation, TLR2 or TLR4 recruits TIRAP, which recruits MyD88 to the receptor complex through TIR domain interactions (Horng et al., 2001Horng T. Barton G.M. Medzhitov R.

The TIR domain interactions between MyD88 and TLR2 or TLR4 have been characterized in structural studies (Nada et al., 2012Nada M. Ohnishi H. Tochio H. Kato Z. Kimura T. Kubota K. Yamamoto T.

Structural basis for the multiple interactions of the MyD88 TIR domain in TLR4 signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 10260-10265Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Four residues of MyD88 have been identified as essential for this interaction, including R196, which is mutated (R196C) in three MyD88-deficient patients (von Bernuth et al., 2008von Bernuth H. Picard C. Jin Z. Pankla R. Xiao H. Ku C.L. Chrabieh M. Mustapha I.B. Ghandil P. Camcioglu Y. et al.Pyogenic bacterial infections in humans with MyD88 deficiency.Science. 2008; 321: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The R196 residue of MyD88 corresponds to the R121 residue of TIRAP (Figure S1B; Valkov et al., 2011Valkov E. Stamp A. Dimaio F. Baker D. Verstak B. Roversi P. Kellie S. Sweet M.J. Mansell A. Gay N.J. et al.Crystal structure of Toll-like receptor adaptor MAL/TIRAP reveals the molecular basis for signal transduction and disease protection.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 14879-14884Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Like the R196C mutation of MyD88, the R121W mutation of TIRAP seems to have at most a modest impact on protein levels (Figure 1G). The R121W mutation may impair the interaction of TIRAP with MyD88, thereby preventing downstream signaling and the activation of target gene transcription. The R121W mutation may also impair TIRAP interaction with TLR2 and TLR4 (Lin et al., 2012Lin Z. Lu J. Zhou W. Shen Y. Structural insights into TIR domain specificity of the bridging adaptor Mal in TLR4 signaling.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e34202Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We tested these hypotheses by first performing in vitro co-immunoprecipitation assays in HEK293T cells transfected with the WT and R121W TIRAP isoforms A and B, together with TLR2 or MyD88. Both WT TIRAP isoforms interacted with TLR2, whereas this interaction was strongly impaired when HEK293T cells were transfected with the R121W TIRAP isoforms (Figure 2D). Similarly, both WT TIRAP isoforms interacted with MyD88, whereas this interaction was strongly impaired when HEK293T cells were transfected with either R121W TIRAP isoform (Figure 2E). We also assessed TLR2/MyD88 co-immunoprecipitation after PAM2CSK4 (PAM2) stimulation in SV40 fibroblasts from healthy controls, P1’s mother (heterozygous for TIRAP R121W), and P1 and her father, who are both homozygous for the mutant form of TIRAP (Figure 2F). The co-immunoprecipitation of TLR2 and MyD88 was observed upon TLR2 stimulation in both control and R121W-heterozygous fibroblasts, but not in R121W-homozygous fibroblasts, whereas MyD88 mutant fibroblasts (L93P/R196C) displayed an intermediate pattern. These data suggest that the R121W mutation disrupts the interaction of both TIRAP isoforms with their TLR2 (and presumably TLR4) and MyD88 partners. These data, therefore, suggest that individuals homozygous for R121W have a complete functional deficiency of TIRAP. The transient transfection of SV40 fibroblasts from P1 and her father with a vector encoding WT TIRAP isoform A or B induced IL-6 production to levels similar to those in transfected control cells (Figure 3A). With this high background, the increase in response to TLR2 or TLR4 stimulation was only modest, in both cell types (data not shown). By contrast, the transfection of these SV40 fibroblasts with constructs encoding either of the R121W TIRAP isoforms had no effect (Figure 3A). Overexpression of the WT MyD88 allele in SV40 fibroblasts from the control, P1, her father, or a MyD88-deficient patient led to the constitutive activation of IL-6 production, but the overproduction of WT TIRAP in MyD88-deficient fibroblasts did not. Moreover, the stable transfection of fibroblasts from P1 or her father with lentiviral particles encoding WT TIRAP isoform A or B, or both, rescued constitutive IL-6 production, whereas no such rescue was observed after stable transfection with the R121W TIRAP construct or the empty vector (Figure S2A). Finally, the overproduction of each TIRAP WT isoform in HEK293T cells, as already shown for TIRAP isoform A, induced constitutive activation of the NF-κB pathway and IL-6 production (Figure 3B; Horng et al., 2001Horng T. Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. TIRAP: an adapter molecule in the Toll signaling pathway.Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar), whereas no such activation was observed following the overproduction of TIRAP R121W isoforms. Thus, the R121W TIRAP allele is loss of function, at least for constitutive and MyD88-dependent IL-6 induction following overexpression in fibroblasts.Figure S2The TIRAP R121W Allele Is Loss of Function, Related to Figure 3Show full captionA.

https://openalex.org/W2590676280,"The processes leading to genetic isolation influence a population’s local extinction risk, and should thus be identified before conservation actions are implemented. Natural or human-induced circumstances can result in historical or contemporary barriers to gene flow and/or demographic bottlenecks. Distinguishing between these hypotheses can be achieved by comparing genetic diversity and differentiation in isolated vs. continuous neighboring populations. In Ontario, American black bears (Ursus americanus) are continuously distributed, genetically diverse, and exhibit an isolation-by-distance structuring pattern, except on the Bruce Peninsula (BP). To identify the processes that led to the genetic isolation of BP black bears, we modelled various levels of historical and contemporary migration and population size reductions using forward simulations. We compared simulation results with empirical genetic indices from Ontario black bear populations under different levels of geographic isolation, and conducted additional simulations to determine if translocations could help achieve genetic restoration. From a genetic standpoint, conservation concerns for BP black bears are warranted because our results show that: i) a recent demographic bottleneck associated with recently reduced migration best explains the low genetic diversity on the BP; and ii) under sustained isolation, BP black bears could lose between 70% and 80% of their rare alleles within 100 years. Although restoring migration corridors would be the most effective method to enhance long-term genetic diversity and prevent inbreeding, it is unrealistic to expect connectivity to be re-established. Current levels of genetic diversity could be maintained by successfully translocating 10 bears onto the peninsula every 5 years. Such regular translocations may be more practical than landscape restoration, because areas connecting the peninsula to nearby mainland black bear populations have been irreversibly modified by humans, and form strong barriers to movement."
https://openalex.org/W2590378689,"The massive meat production of broiler chickens make them continuously exposed to potential stressors that stimulate releasing of stress-related hormones like corticosterone (CORT) which is responsible for specific pathways in biological mechanisms and physiological activities. Therefore, this research was conducted to evaluate a wide range of responses related to broiler performance, immune function, plasma biochemistry, related gene expressions and cell death morphology during and after a 7-day course of CORT injection. A total number of 200 one-day-old commercial Cobb broiler chicks were used in this study. From 21 to 28 d of age, broilers were randomly assigned to one of 2 groups with 5 replicates of 20 birds each; the first group received a daily intramuscular injection of 5 mg/kg BW corticosterone dissolved in 0.5 ml ethanol:saline solution (CORT group), while the second group received a daily intramuscular injection of 0.5 ml ethanol:saline only (CONT group). Growth performance, including body weight (BW), daily weight gain (DG), feed intake (FI) and feed conversion ratio (FC), were calculated at 0, 3 and 7 d after the start of the CORT injections. At the same times, blood samples were collected in each group for hematological (TWBC’s and H/L ratio), T- and B-lymphocytes proliferation and plasma biochemical assays (total protein, TP; free triiodothyronine hormone, fT3; aspartate amino transaminase, AST; and alanine amino transaminase, ALT). The liver, thymus, bursa of Fabricius and spleen were dissected and weighed, and the mRNA expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 gene (IGF-1) in liver and cell-death-program gene (caspase-9) in bursa were analyzed for each group and time; while the apoptotic/necrotic cells were morphologically detected in the spleen. From 28 to 35 d of age, broilers were kept for recovery period without CORT injection and the same sampling and parameters were repeated at the end (at 14 d after initiation of the CORT injection). In general, all parameters of broiler performance were negatively affected by the CORT injection. In addition, CORT treatment decreased the plasma concentration of fT3 and the mRNA expression of hepatic IGF-1. A significant increase in liver weight accompanied by an increase in plasma TP, AST and ALT was observed with CORT treatment, indicating an incidence of liver malfunction by CORT. Moreover, the relative weights of thymus, bursa and spleen decreased by the CORT treatment with low counts of TWBC’s and low stimulation of T & B cells while the H/L ratio increased; indicating immunosuppressive effect for CORT treatment. Furthermore, high expression of caspase-9 gene occurred in the bursa of CORT-treated chickens, however, it was associated with a high necrotic vs. low apoptotic cell death pathway in the spleen. Seven days after termination of the CORT treatment in broilers, most of these aspects remained negatively affected by CORT and did not recover to its normal status. The current study provides a comprehensive view of different physiological modulations in broiler chickens by CORT treatment and may set the potential means to mount a successful defense against stress in broilers and other animals as well."
https://openalex.org/W2589343226,"Radio- and chemo-resistance represent major obstacles in the therapy of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not known. In the present study, during induction of radio- or chemo-resistance in NSCLC cells, dynamic analyses revealed that decreased expression of let-7 induced by irradiation or cisplatin resulted in increased expression of its target gene LIN28, and increased expression of LIN28 then contributed to further decreased expression of let-7 by inhibiting its maturation and biogenesis. Moreover, we showed that down-regulation of let-7 and up-regulation of LIN28 expression promoted resistance to irradiation or cisplatin by regulating the single-cell proliferative capability of NSCLC cells. Consequently, in NSCLC cells, let-7 and LIN28 can form a double-negative feedback loop through mutual inhibition, and disturbance of the let-7/LIN28 double-negative feedback loop induced by irradiation or chemotherapeutic drugs can result in radio- and chemo-resistance. In addition, low expression of let-7 and high expression of LIN28 in NSCLC patients was associated significantly with resistance to radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Therefore, our study demonstrated that disturbance of the let-7/LIN28 double-negative feedback loop is involved in the regulation of radio- and chemo-resistance, and that let-7 and LIN28 could be employed as predictive biomarkers of response to radiotherapy or chemotherapy in NSCLC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2589543330,"Species are fundamental units in many biological disciplines, but there is continuing disagreement as to what species are, how to define them, and even whether the concept is useful. While some of this debate can be attributed to inadequate data and insufficient statistical frameworks in alpha taxonomy, an equal part results from the ambiguity over what species are expected to represent by the many who use them. Here, mtDNA data, microsatellite data, and sequence data from 17 nuclear loci are used in an integrated and quantitative manner to resolve the presence of evolutionary lineages, their contemporary and historical structure, and their correspondence to species, in a species complex of Amazonian peacock ""bass"" cichlids (Cichla pinima sensu lato). Results suggest that the historical narrative for these populations is more complex than can be portrayed by recognizing them as one, two, or four species: their history and contemporary dynamics cannot be unambiguously rendered as discrete units (taxa) at any level without both choosing the supremacy of one delimitation criterion and obscuring the very information that provides insight into the diversification process. This calls into question the utility of species as a rank, term, or concept, and suggests that while biologists may have a reasonable grasp of the structure of evolution, our methods of conveying these insights need updating. The lack of correspondence between evolutionary phenomena and discrete species should serve as a null hypothesis, and researchers should focus on quantifying the diversity in nature at whatever hierarchical level it occurs."

https://openalex.org/W2589902966,"Background Pre-operative administration of benzodiazepines can cause hypoventilation—a decrease in minute ventilation (MV)—commonly referred to as “respiratory compromise or respiratory depression.” Respiratory depression can lead to hypercarbia and / or hypoxemia, and may heighten the risk of other respiratory complications. Current anesthesia practice often places patients at risk for respiratory complications even before surgery, as respiratory monitoring is generally postponed until the patient is in the operating room. In the present study we examined and quantified the onset of respiratory depression following the administration of a single dose of midazolam in pre-operative patients, using a non-invasive respiratory volume monitor that reports MV, tidal volume (TV), and respiratory rate (RR). Methods Impedance-based Respiratory Volume Monitor (RVM) data were collected and analyzed from 30 patients prior to undergoing orthopedic or general surgical procedures. All patients received 2.0 mg of midazolam intravenously at least 20 minutes prior to the induction of anesthesia and the effects of midazolam on the patient's respiratory function were analyzed. Results Within 15 minutes of midazolam administration, we noted a significant decrease in both MV (average decrease of 14.3% ± 5.9%, p<0.05) and TV (22.3% ± 4.5%, p<0.001). Interestingly, the corresponding RR increased significantly by an average of 10.3% ± 4.7% (p<0.05). Further analysis revealed an age-dependent response, in which elderly patients (age≥65 years, n = 6) demonstrated greater reductions in MV and TV and a lack of compensatory RR increase. In fact, elderly patients experienced an average decrease in MV of 34% ± 6% (p<0.05) compared to an average decrease of 9% ± 6% (p<0.05) in younger patients. Conclusions We were able to quantify the effects of pre-operative midazolam administration on clinically significant respiratory parameters (MV, TV and RR) using a non-invasive RVM, uncovering that the respiratory depressive effect of benzodiazepines affect primarily TV rather than RR. Such respiratory monitoring data provide the opportunity for individualizing dosing and adjustment of clinical interventions, especially important in elderly patients. With additional respiratory data, clinicians may be able to better identify and quantify respiratory depression, reduce adverse effects, and improve overall patient safety."
https://openalex.org/W2589484507,"The second messenger cAMP stimulates cellular gene expression via the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB and through dephosphorylation of the cAMP-responsive transcriptional coactivators (CRTCs). Under basal conditions, CRTCs are phosphorylated by members of the AMPK family of Ser/Thr kinases and sequestered in the cytoplasm via a phosphorylation-dependent association with 14-3-3 proteins. Increases in cAMP promote the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of CRTCs, where they bind to CREB and stimulate relevant target genes. Although they share considerable sequence homology, members of the CRTC family exert non-overlapping effects on cellular gene expression through as yet unidentified mechanisms. Here we show that the three CRTCs exhibit distinct patterns of 14-3-3 binding at three conserved sites corresponding to S70, S171, and S275 (in CRTC2). S171 functions as the gatekeeper site for 14-3-3 binding; it acts cooperatively with S275 in stabilizing this interaction following its phosphorylation by the cAMP-responsive SIK and the cAMP-nonresponsive MARK kinases. Although S171 contains a consensus recognition site for phosphorylation by AMPK family members, S70 and S275 carry variant motifs (MNTGGS275LPDL), lacking basic residues that are otherwise critical for SIK/MARK recognition as well as 14-3-3 binding. Correspondingly, the activity of these motifs differs between CRTC family members. As the variant (SLPDL) motif is present and apparently phosphorylated in other mammalian proteins, our studies suggest that the regulation of cellular targets by AMPK family members is more extensive than previously appreciated."

Considering the wide distribution of the crusts, archaeal and bacterial communities on these crusts potentially play a significant role in biogeochemical cycling between oceans and seamounts; however little is known about phylogenetic diversity, abundance and function of the crust communities. To this end, we collected the crusts from the northwest Pacific basin and the Philippine Sea. We performed comprehensive analysis of the archaeal and bacterial communities of the collected crust samples by culture-independent molecular techniques. The distance between the sampling points was up to approximately 2,000 km. Surrounding sediments and bottom seawater were also collected as references near the sampling points of the crusts, and analyzed together. 16S rRNA gene analyses showed that the community structure of the crusts was significantly different from that of the seawater. Several members related to ammonia-oxidizers of Thaumarchaeota and Betaproteobacteria were detected in the crusts at most of all regions and depths by analyses of 16S rRNA and amoA genes, suggesting that the ammonia-oxidizing members are commonly present in the crusts. Although members related to the ammonia-oxidizers were also detected in the seawater, they differed from those in the crusts phylogenetically. In addition, members of uncultured groups of Alpha-, Delta- and Gammaproteobacteria were commonly detected in the crusts but not in the seawater. Comparison with previous studies of ferromanganese crusts and nodules suggests that the common members determined in the present study are widely distributed in the crusts and nodules on the vast seafloor. They may be key microbes for sustaining microbial ecosystems there."

We provide an in-depth analysis of the Twitter volume and sentiment about the 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index, over a period of three years. We focus on Earnings Announcements and show that there is a considerable difference with respect to when the announcements are made: before the market opens or after the market closes. The two different timings of the Earnings Announcements were already investigated in the financial literature, but not yet in the social media. We analyze the differences in terms of the Twitter volumes, cumulative abnormal returns, trade returns, and earnings surprises. We report mixed results. On the one hand, we show that the Twitter sentiment (the collective opinion of the users) on the day of the announcement very well reflects the stock moves on the same day. We demonstrate this by applying the event study methodology, where the polarity of the Earnings Announcements is computed from the Twitter sentiment. Cumulative abnormal returns are high (2--4\%) and statistically significant. On the other hand, we find only weak predictive power of the Twitter sentiment one day in advance. It turns out that it is important how to account for the announcements made after the market closes. These after-hours announcements draw high Twitter activity immediately, but volume and price changes in trading are observed only on the next day. On the day before the announcements, the Twitter volume is low, and the sentiment has very weak predictive power. A useful lesson learned is the importance of the proper alignment between the announcements, trading and Twitter data."
https://openalex.org/W2589635880,"The potential of beekeeping to mitigate the exposure of rural sub-Sahara African farmers to economic stochasticity has been widely promoted by an array of development agencies. Robust outcome indicators of the success of beekeeping to improve household well-being are unfortunately lacking. This study aimed to identify the key drivers and barriers of beekeeping adoption at the household level, and quantified the associated income contribution in three agro-ecological zones in Uganda. Beekeepers were generally the most economically disadvantaged people in the study areas and tended to adopt beekeeping following contact with non-government organisations and access to training. Whilst incomes were not statistically lower than their non-beekeeping counterparts; their mean household well-being scores were significantly lower than non-beekeeping households. The inability of beekeeping to significantly improve well-being status can in part be attributed to a lack of both training in bee husbandry and protective equipment provision such as suits, gloves and smokers. These are critical tools for beekeepers as they provide the necessary confidence to manage honey bees. Rather than focussing solely on the socio-economic conditions of farmers to effectively adopt beekeeping, future research should also attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of development agencies’ provision to the beekeeping sector."

Using a new methodology, we orthogonally manipulated the upper facial height and the bizygomatic width to test their selective effect in the formation of impressions. Subjects (n = 90) saw pair of faces and had to select the face expressing better different social traits (trustworthiness, aggressiveness and femininity). We further investigated how sex and fWHR components interact in the formation of these judgements. Across experiments, changes along the vertical component better predicted participants' ratings rather than the horizontal component. Faces with smaller height were perceived as less trustworthy, less feminine and more aggressive. By dissociating fWHR and testing the contribution of its components independently, we obtained a powerful and discriminative measure of how facial morphology guides social judgements."

https://openalex.org/W2591337910,"Factors affecting contribution of spontaneous physical activity (SPA; activity associated with everyday tasks) to energy balance of humans are not well understood, as it is not clear whether low activity is related to dietary habits, precedes obesity or is a result of thereof. In particular, human studies on SPA and basal metabolic rates (BMR, accounting for >50% of human energy budget) and their associations with diet composition, metabolic thrift and obesity are equivocal. To clarify these ambiguities we used a unique animal model—mice selected for divergent BMR rates (the H-BMR and L-BMR line type) presenting a 50% between-line type difference in the primary selected trait. Males of each line type were divided into three groups and fed either a high fat, high carb or a control diet. They then spent 4 months in individual cages under conditions emulating human “sedentary lifestyle”, with SPA followed every month and measurements of metabolic risk indicators (body fat mass %, blood lipid profile, fasting blood glucose levels and oxidative damage in the livers, kidneys and hearts) taken at the end of study. Mice with genetically determined high BMR assimilated more energy and had higher SPA irrespective of type of diet. H-BMR individuals were characterized by lower dry body fat mass %, better lipid profile and lower fasting blood glucose levels, but higher oxidative damage in the livers and hearts. Genetically determined high BMR may be a protective factor against diet-induced obesity and most of the metabolic syndrome indicators. Elevated spontaneous activity is correlated with high BMR, and constitutes an important factor affecting individual capability to sustain energy balance even under energy dense diets."

Survey items included beliefs and attitudes toward e-cigarettes, attitudes toward e-cigarette regulation and preparedness on discussing e-cigarettes with their patients.Most respondents believed that e-cigarettes are not safer than conventional tobacco cigarettes (75.7%) or smokeless tobacco (83.2%), and feared that discussing e-cigarettes with the patients would encourage use (65.4%). They did not consider it a smoking cessation treatment (78.3%), and thus would not recommend it to smokers who do not want to quit (82.2%) or who failed to quit with conventional smoking cessation treatment (74.1%). Most respondents supported all examples of e-cigarette regulations, including the safety and quality check (97.8%), warning label (97.8%), advertisement ban (95.1%), restriction of flavoring (78.4%), minimum purchasing age (99.5%), and restriction of indoor use (94.6%). Most learned about e-cigarettes from media and advertisements, or conversation with patients rather than through professional scientific resources, and reported discomfort when discussing e-cigarette with patients.Lung cancer specialist physicians in Korea doubt the safety of e-cigarette and use of e-cigarette as smoking cessation treatment, and supported strict regulation. However, only 20% reported that they obtained information on e-cigarettes from the scientific literature and many lacked adequate knowledge based on scientific evidence, suggesting the need for better preparedness. Nevertheless, the views of professionals revealed from our study could help to develop clinical guidelines and regulatory guidance."
https://openalex.org/W2590542683,"Plasma D-dimer level is clinically useful for diagnosing patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, the cut-off value for the D-dimer level remains controversial and undetermined with regard to total hip arthroplasty (THA). The objective of this study was to estimate the efficacy of an age- and D-dimer-based index for diagnosing DVTs in asymptomatic cases before THA. We enrolled 224 patients with no symptoms associated with DVT before THA. All the patients underwent ultrasonography, and the plasma D-dimer level was recorded about 1 month preoperatively. The optimal cut-off value was calculated using multiple logistic regression and receiver operating curve analyses. DVTs were detected in 13 patients (5.8%) using ultrasonography. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.13; p = 0.007) and D-dimer value (OR: 1.74; p = 0.003) were related to the existence of preoperative DVT. A DVT index (0.12 × age + 0.45 × the D-dimer value) of 8.15 was the most reasonable cut-off value according to the receiver operating curve analysis. This value caused 100% sensitivity and 70.1% specificity, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.905 (range, 0.836-0.975). For age and D-dimer value, the AUCs were 0.828 (0.749-0.907) and 0.716 (0.522-0.910), respectively. This study demonstrated that age and D-dimer index can be useful in screening patients for DVTs before THA. This DVT index is also easy to calculate and may be clinically significant."

Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is a common complication of pancreatic surgery. Despite improvement in mortality, the rate of POPF still remains high and unsolved. To identify risk factors for POPF after laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy, clinicopathological variables on 120 patients who underwent LDP with stapler closure were retrospectively analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors for POPF. The rate of overall and clinically significant POPF was 30.8% and13.3%, respectively. Higher BMI (≥25kg/m2) (p-value = 0.025) and longer operative time (p-value = 0.021) were associated with overall POPF but not clinically significant POPF. Soft parenchymal texture was significantly associated with both overall (p-value = 0.012) and clinically significant POPF (p-value = 0.000). In multivariable analyses, parenchymal texture (OR, 2.933, P-value = 0.011) and operative time (OR, 1.008, P-value = 0.022) were risk factors for overall POPF. Parenchymal texture was an independent predictive factor for clinically significant POPF (OR, 7.400, P-value = 0.001)."
https://openalex.org/W2589187898,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) consists of an arrest of pulmonary vascular and alveolar growth, with persistent hypoplasia of the pulmonary microvasculature and alveolar simplification. In 25 to 40% of the cases, BPD is complicated by pulmonary hypertension (BPD-PH) that significantly increases the risk of morbidity. In vivo studies suggest that increased pulmonary vascular tone could contribute to late PH in BPD. Nevertheless, an alteration in vasoreactivity as well as the mechanisms involved remain to be confirmed. The purpose of this study was thus to assess changes in pulmonary vascular reactivity in a murine model of BPD-PH. Newborn Wistar rats were exposed to either room air (normoxia) or 90% O2 (hyperoxia) for 14 days. Exposure to hyperoxia induced the well-known features of BPD-PH such as elevated right ventricular systolic pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary vascular remodeling and decreased pulmonary vascular density. Intrapulmonary arteries from hyperoxic pups showed decreased endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine without any alteration of relaxation to the NO-donor sodium nitroprusside. This functional alteration was associated with a decrease of lung eNOS phosphorylation at the Ser1177 activating site. In pups exposed to hyperoxia, serotonin and phenylephrine induced exacerbated contractile responses of intrapulmonary arteries as well as intracellular calcium response in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMC). Moreover, the amplitude of the store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), induced by store depletion using a SERCA inhibitor, was significantly greater in PASMC from hyperoxic pups. Altogether, hyperoxia-induced BPD-PH alters the pulmonary arterial reactivity, with effects on both endothelial and smooth muscle functions. Reduced activating eNOS phosphorylation and enhanced Ca2+ signaling likely account for alterations of pulmonary arterial reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W2590376170,"Background Shrimp in the genus Lysmata have a unique and rare sexual system referred to as protandric simultaneous hermaphroditism, whereby individuals mature first as male (male phase), and then the female function may also develop as the shrimp grow, so that the gonad is able to produce both eggs and sperms simultaneously, a condition called simultaneous hermaphroditism (euhermaphrodite phase). To date, the mechanisms of sex control in this sexual system still remain poorly understood. Many studies indicate that an insulin-like androgenic gland factor (IAG) is involved in controlling sex differentiation in gonochoric crustaceans, but its role in the protandric simultaneous hermaphrodite is still not clear. Results To determine whether an IAG is involved in sex control in the hermaphrodite, here we, for the first time, cloned the IAG gene cDNA sequence from Lysmata wurdemanni (termed Lw-IAG: L. wurdemanni insulin-like AG factor), a protandric simultaneous hermaphroditic shrimp. The IAG contains an open reading frame of 528 bp, corresponding to 176 amino acids, which consists of a signal peptide, B chain, C peptide, and A chain. The organization is similar to the IAGs found in other decapods. The IAG gene was expressed in both male and euhermaphrodite phases, but the expression level was significantly higher in the male phase than in the euhermaphrodite phase. Immunofluorescence analysis and Western Blotting revealed that the IAG protein was expressed in the androgenic gland, and its expression level was higher in the male phase than in the euhermaphrodite phase. Conclusions Data presented here suggest that the IAG gene may be a factor controlling sex in the protandric simultaneous hermaphrodite, and that the euhermaphrodite phase is maintained by reduced gene expression, i.e., the presence of the androgenic gland (or the androgenic hormone it produces) completely inhibits ovarian development in the male phase, and incomplete degeneration of the androgenic gland in the euhermaphrodite phase results in simultaneous hermaphroditism. The findings presented in the current study can help to reveal how protandric simultaneous hermaphroditism evolved in crustaceans."
https://openalex.org/W2590957264,"Phenotypic traits, such as the frog advertisement call, are generally correlated with interspecific genetic variation, and, as a consequence of strong sexual selection, these behaviors may carry a phylogenetic signal. However, variation in acoustic traits is not always correlated with genetic differences between populations (intraspecific variation); phenotypic plasticity and environmental variables may explain part of such variation. For example, local processes can affect acoustic properties in different lineages due to differences in physical structure, climatic conditions, and biotic interactions, particularly when populations are isolated. However, acoustic traits can be used to test phylogenetic hypotheses. We analyzed the advertisement calls of Dendropsophus elegans males from 18 sites and compared them with those of four closely related congeneric species, in order to test for differences between inter and intraspecific variation. We analyzed 451 calls of 45 males of these five species. Because males from distant sites were grouped together without population congruence, differences found in advertisement calls among individuals were not correlated with phylogeographical clades. Phylogenetic and cluster analyses of the D. elegans clades and those of closely related species grouped all five species into the same topology, as reported by previous molecular and morphological phylogenies. However, the topology of the D. elegans phylogeographical clades did not match the topology previously reported. Acoustic communication in D. elegans seems to be conserved among populations, and the phylogeographical history of the species does not explain the variation among lineages in call properties, despite some congruent phylogenetic signals evident at the species level. Based on molecular clocks retrieved from the literature, it seems that more than 6.5 million years of divergence (late Miocene) are necessary to allow significant changes to occur in the acoustic properties of these treefrog calls, making it possible to recover their phylogenetic history only based on acoustic evidence."
https://openalex.org/W2591089596,"In patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), Double Inversion Recovery (DIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to identify cortical lesions (CL). We sought to evaluate the reliability of CL detection on DIR longitudinally at multiple subsequent time-points applying the MAGNIMs scoring criteria for CLs.26 MS patients received a 3T-MRI (Siemens, Skyra) with DIR at 12 time-points (TP) within a 16 months period. Scans were assessed in random order by two different raters. Both raters separately marked all CLs on each scan and total lesion numbers were obtained for each scan-TP and patient. After a retrospective re-evaluation, the number of consensus CLs (conL) was defined as the total number of CLs, which both raters finally agreed on. CLs volumes, relative signal intensities and CLs localizations were determined. Both ratings (conL vs. non-consensus scoring) were compared for further analysis.A total number of n = 334 CLs were identified by both raters in 26 MS patients with a first agreement of both raters on 160 out of 334 of the CLs found (κ = 0.48). After the retrospective re-evaluation, consensus agreement increased to 233 out of 334 CL (κ = 0.69). 93.8% of conL were visible in at least 2 consecutive TP. 74.7% of the conL were visible in all 12 consecutive TP. ConL had greater mean lesion volumes and higher mean signal intensities compared to lesions that were only detected by one of the raters (p<0.05). A higher number of CLs in the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobe were identified by both raters than the number of those only identified by one of the raters (p<0.05).After a first assessment, slightly less than a half of the CL were considered as reliably detectable on longitudinal DIR images. A retrospective re-evaluation notably increased the consensus agreement. However, this finding is narrowed, considering the fact that retrospective evaluation steps might not be practicable in clinical routine. Lesions that were not reliably identifiable by both raters seem to be characterized by lower signal intensity and smaller size, or located in distinct anatomical brain regions."
https://openalex.org/W2589634619,"Insulin is secreted in a pulsatile manner from multiple micro-organs called the islets of Langerhans. The amplitude and phase (shape) of insulin secretion are modulated by numerous factors including glucose. The role of phase modulation in glucose homeostasis is not well understood compared to the obvious contribution of amplitude modulation. In the present study, we measured Ca2+ oscillations in islets as a proxy for insulin pulses, and we observed their frequency and shape changes under constant/alternating glucose stimuli. Here we asked how the phase modulation of insulin pulses contributes to glucose regulation. To directly answer this question, we developed a phenomenological oscillator model that drastically simplifies insulin secretion, but precisely incorporates the observed phase modulation of insulin pulses in response to glucose stimuli. Then, we mathematically modeled how insulin pulses regulate the glucose concentration in the body. The model of insulin oscillation and glucose regulation describes the glucose-insulin feedback loop. The data-based model demonstrates that the existence of phase modulation narrows the range within which the glucose concentration is maintained through the suppression/enhancement of insulin secretion in conjunction with the amplitude modulation of this secretion. The phase modulation is the response of islets to glucose perturbations. When multiple islets are exposed to the same glucose stimuli, they can be entrained to generate synchronous insulin pulses. Thus, we conclude that the phase modulation of insulin pulses is essential for glucose regulation and inter-islet synchronization."

The most frequent Mediterranean mutations for β-thalassemia are: β039, β+IVSI-110, β+IVSI-6 and β0IVSI-1. Several molecular techniques for the detection of point mutations have been developed based on the amplification of the DNA target by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but they could be labor-intensive and technically demanding. On the contrary, TaqMan® genotyping assays are a simple, sensitive and versatile method suitable for the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping affecting the human β-globin gene. Four TaqMan® genotyping assays for the most common β-thalassemia mutations present in the Mediterranean area were designed and validated for the genotype characterization of genomic DNA extracted from 94 subjects comprising 25 healthy donors, 33 healthy carriers and 36 β-thalassemia patients. In addition, 15 specimens at late gestation (21-39 gestational weeks) and 11 at early gestation (5-18 gestational weeks) were collected from pregnant women, and circulating cell-free fetal DNAs were extracted and analyzed with these four genotyping assays. We developed four simple, inexpensive and versatile genotyping assays for the postnatal and prenatal identification of the thalassemia mutations β039, β+IVSI-110, β+IVSI-6, β0IVSI-1. These genotyping assays are able to detect paternally inherited point mutations in the fetus and could be efficiently employed for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of β-globin gene mutations, starting from the 9th gestational week."
https://openalex.org/W2591048960,"Designing a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) to achieve a high Quality of Service (QoS) (network performance and durability) is a challenging problem. We address it by focusing on the performance of the 802.15.4 communication protocol because the IEEE 802.15.4 Standard is actually considered as one of the reference technologies in WSNs. In this paper, we propose to control the sustainable use of resources (i.e., energy consumption, reliability and timely packet transmission) of a wireless sensor node equipped with photovoltaic cells by an adaptive tuning not only of the MAC (Medium Access Control) parameters but also of the sampling frequency of the node. To do this, we use one of the existing control approaches, namely the viability theory, which aims to preserve the functions and the controls of a dynamic system in a set of desirable states. So, an analytical model, describing the evolution over time of nodal resources, is derived and used by a viability algorithm for the adaptive tuning of the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC protocol. The simulation analysis shows that our solution allows ensuring indefinitely, in the absence of hardware failure, the operations (lifetime duration, reliability and timely packet transmission) of an 802.15.4 WSN and one can temporarily increase the sampling frequency of the node beyond the regular sampling one. This latter brings advantages for agricultural and environmental applications such as precision agriculture, flood or fire prevention. Main results show that our current approach enable to send more information when critical events occur without the node runs out of energy. Finally, we argue that our approach is generic and can be applied to other types of WSN."
https://openalex.org/W2591380109,"Avoiding biases in next generation sequencing (NGS) library preparation is crucial for obtaining reliable sequencing data. Recently, a new library preparation method has been introduced which has eliminated the need for the ligation step. This method, termed SMART (switching mechanism at the 5′ end of the RNA transcript), is based on template switching reverse transcription. To date, there has been no systematic analysis of the additional biases introduced by this method. We analysed the genomic distribution of sequenced reads prepared from genomic DNA using the SMART methodology and found a strong bias toward long (≥12bp) poly dA/dT containing genomic loci. This bias is unique to the SMART-based library preparation and does not appear when libraries are prepared with conventional ligation based methods. Although this bias is obvious only when performing paired end sequencing, it affects single end sequenced samples as well. Our analysis demonstrates that sequenced reads originating from SMART-DNA libraries are heavily skewed toward genomic poly dA/dT tracts. This bias needs to be considered when deciding to use SMART based technology for library preparation."
https://openalex.org/W2591400458,"The Bolivian Amazon holds a complex configuration of people and forested landscapes in which communities hold secure tenure rights over a rich ecosystem offering a range of livelihood income opportunities. A large share of this income is derived from Amazon nut (Bertholletia excelsa). Many communities also have long-standing experience with community timber management plans. However, livelihood needs and desires for better living conditions may continue to place these resources under considerable stress as income needs and opportunities intensify and diversify. We aim to identify the socioeconomic and biophysical factors determining the income from forests, husbandry, off-farm and two keystone forest products (i.e., Amazon nut and timber) in the Bolivian Amazon region. We used structural equation modelling tools to account for the complex inter-relationships between socioeconomic and biophysical factors in predicting each source of income. The potential exists to increase incomes from existing livelihood activities in ways that reduce dependency upon forest resources. For example, changes in off-farm income sources can act to increase or decrease forest incomes. Market accessibility, social, financial, and natural and physical assets determined the amount of income community households could derive from Amazon nut and timber. Factors related to community households’ local ecological knowledge, such as the number of non-timber forest products harvested and the number of management practices applied to enhance Amazon nut production, defined the amount of income these households could derive from Amazon nut and timber, respectively. The (inter) relationships found among socioeconomic and biophysical factors over income shed light on ways to improve forest-dependent livelihoods in the Bolivian Amazon. We believe that our analysis could be applicable to other contexts throughout the tropics as well."
https://openalex.org/W2590332431,"In response to limited physician adoption of various healthcare initiatives, we sought to propose and assess a novel approach to policy development where one first characterizes diverse physician groups' common interests, using a medical student and constructivist grounded theory.In 6 months, a medical student completed 36 semi-structured interviews with interventional radiologists, gynecologists, and vascular surgeons that were systematically analyzed according to constructivist grounded theory to identifying common themes. Common drivers of clinical decision making and professional values across 3 distinct specialty groups were derived from physicians' descriptions of their clinical decision making, stories, and concerns.Common drivers of clinical decision making included patient preference/benefit, experience, reimbursement, busyness/volume, and referral networks. Common values included honesty, trustworthiness, loyalty, humble service, compassion and perseverance, and practical wisdom. Although personal gains were perceived as important interests, such values were easily sacrificed for the good of patients or other non-financial interests. This balance was largely dependent on the incentives and security provided by physicians' environments.Using a medical student interviewer and constructivist grounded theory is a feasible means of collecting rich qualitative data to guide policy development. Healthcare administrators and medical educators should consider incorporating this methodology early in policy development to anticipate how value differences between physician groups will influence their acceptance of policies and other broad healthcare initiatives."
https://openalex.org/W2591527278,"Background Recent implementation of electronic health records (EHR) has dramatically changed medical ward organization. While residents in general internal medicine use EHR systems half of their working time, whether computer usage impacts residents’ workflow remains uncertain. We aimed to observe the frequency of task-switches occurring during resident’s work and to assess whether computer usage was associated with task-switching. Methods In a large Swiss academic university hospital, we conducted, between May 26 and July 24, 2015 a time-motion study to assess how residents in general internal medicine organize their working day. Results We observed 49 day and 17 evening shifts of 36 residents, amounting to 697 working hours. During day shifts, residents spent 5.4 hours using a computer (mean total working time: 11.6 hours per day). On average, residents switched 15 times per hour from a task to another. Task-switching peaked between 8:00–9:00 and 16:00–17:00. Task-switching was not associated with resident’s characteristics and no association was found between task-switching and extra hours (Spearman r = 0.220, p = 0.137 for day and r = 0.483, p = 0.058 for evening shifts). Computer usage occurred more frequently at the beginning or ends of day shifts and was associated with decreased overall task-switching. Conclusion Task-switching occurs very frequently during resident’s working day. Despite the fact that residents used a computer half of their working time, computer usage was associated with decreased task-switching. Whether frequent task-switches and computer usage impact the quality of patient care and resident’s work must be evaluated in further studies."
https://openalex.org/W2589256999,"Culex bidens and C. interfor, implicated in arbovirus transmission in Argentina, are sister species, only distinguishable by feature of the male genitalia; however, intermediate specimens of the species in sympatry have been found. Fourth-instar larvae and females of both species share apomorphic features, and this lack of clear distinction creates problems for specific identification. Geometric morphometric traits of these life stages also do not distinguish the species. The aim of the present study was to assess the taxonomic status of C. bidens and C. interfor using two mitochondrial genes and to determine the degree of their reproductive isolation using microsatellite loci. Sequences of the ND4 and COI genes were concatenated in a matrix of 993 nucleotides and used for phylogenetic and distance analyses. Bayesian and maximum parsimony inferences showed a well resolved and supported topology, enclosing sequences of individuals of C. bidens (0.83 BPP, 73 BSV) and C. interfor (0.98 BPP, 97 BSV) in a strong sister relationship. The mean K2P distance within C. bidens and C. interfor was 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, and the interspecific variation was 2.3%. Bayesian clustering also showed two distinct mitochondrial lineages. All sequenced mosquitoes were successfully identified in accordance with the best close match algorithm. The low genetic distance values obtained indicate that the species diverged quite recently. Most morphologically intermediate specimens of C. bidens from Córdoba were heterozygous for the microsatellite locus GT51; the significant heterozygote excess observed suggests incomplete reproductive isolation. However, C. bidens and C. interfor should be considered good species: the ventral arm of the phallosome of the male genitalia and the ND4 and COI sequences are diagnostic characters."

More specifically, immunostaining was found in areas known to be involved in amino acid sensing and signaling pathways e.g. piriform cortex and hypothalamus. SLC38A9 immunoreactivity co-localized with both GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, but not with astrocytes. SLC38A9 play a key role in the mTORC1 pathway, and therefore we performed in vivo starvation and high-fat diet studies, to measure gene expression alterations in specific brain tissues and in larger brain regions. Following starvation, Slc38a9 was upregulated in brainstem and cortex, and in anterior parts of the brain (Bregma 3.2 to -2.1mm).

https://openalex.org/W2590420810,"Across species, the performance of vocal signals can be modulated by the social environment. Zebra finches, for example, adjust their song performance when singing to females ('female-directed' or FD song) compared to when singing in isolation ('undirected' or UD song). These changes are salient, as females prefer the FD song over the UD song. Despite the importance of these performance changes, the neural mechanisms underlying this social modulation remain poorly understood. Previous work in finches has established that expression of the immediate early gene EGR1 is increased during singing and modulated by social context within the vocal control circuitry. Here, we examined whether particular neural subpopulations within those vocal control regions exhibit similar modulations of EGR1 expression. We compared EGR1 expression in neurons expressing parvalbumin (PV), a calcium buffer that modulates network plasticity and homeostasis, among males that performed FD song, males that produced UD song, or males that did not sing. We found that, overall, singing but not social context significantly affected EGR1 expression in PV neurons throughout the vocal control nuclei. We observed differences in EGR1 expression between two classes of PV interneurons in the basal ganglia nucleus Area X. Additionally, we found that singing altered the amount of PV expression in neurons in HVC and Area X and that distinct PV interneuron types in Area X exhibited different patterns of modulation by singing. These data indicate that throughout the vocal control circuitry the singing-related regulation of EGR1 expression in PV neurons may be less influenced by social context than in other neuron types and raise the possibility of cell-type specific differences in plasticity and calcium buffering."
https://openalex.org/W2589927677,"Along with the global climate change, there is an increasing interest for its effect on phenological patterns such as start and end of the growing season. Scientific digital webcams are used for this purpose taking every day one or more images from the same natural motive showing for example trees or grassland sites. To derive phenological patterns from the webcam images, regions of interest are manually defined on these images by an expert and subsequently a time series of percentage greenness is derived and analyzed with respect to structural changes. While this standard approach leads to satisfying results and allows to determine dates of phenological change points, it is associated with a considerable amount of manual work and is therefore constrained to a limited number of webcams only. In particular, this forbids to apply the phenological analysis to a large network of publicly accessible webcams in order to capture spatial phenological variation. In order to be able to scale up the analysis to several hundreds or thousands of webcams, we propose and evaluate two automated alternatives for the definition of regions of interest, allowing for efficient analyses of webcam images. A semi-supervised approach selects pixels based on the correlation of the pixels' time series of percentage greenness with a few prototype pixels. An unsupervised approach clusters pixels based on scores of a singular value decomposition. We show for a scientific webcam that the resulting regions of interest are at least as informative as those chosen by an expert with the advantage that no manual action is required. Additionally, we show that the methods can even be applied to publicly available webcams accessed via the internet yielding interesting partitions of the analyzed images. Finally, we show that the methods are suitable for the intended big data applications by analyzing 13988 webcams from the AMOS database. All developed methods are implemented in the statistical software package R and publicly available in the R package phenofun. Executable example code is provided as supplementary material."

In this study, we describe the construction of a versatile reporter system for Yersinia enterocolitica serotype O:3 (YeO3) based on the luxCDABE operon. In strain YeO3-luxCDE we integrated the luciferase substrate biosynthetic genes, luxCDE, into the genome of the bacterium so that the substrate is constitutively produced. The luxAB genes that encode the luciferase enzyme were cloned into a suicide vector to allow cloning of any promoter-containing fragment upstream the genes. When the obtained suicide-construct is mobilized into YeO3-luxCDE bacteria, it integrates into the recipient genome via homologous recombination between the cloned promoter fragment and the genomic promoter sequence and thereby generates a single-copy and stable promoter reporter. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-antigen (O-ag) and outer core hexasaccharide (OC) of YeO3 are virulence factors necessary to colonization of the intestine and establishment of infection. To monitor the activities of the OC and O-ag gene cluster promoters we constructed the reporter strains YeO3-Poc::luxAB and YeO3-Pop1::luxAB, respectively. In vitro, at 37°C both promoter activities were highest during logarithmic growth and decreased when the bacteria entered stationary growth phase. At 22°C the OC gene cluster promoter activity increased during the late logarithmic phase. Both promoters were more active in late stationary phase. To monitor the promoter activities in vivo, mice were infected intragastrically and the reporter activities monitored by the IVIS technology. The mouse experiments revealed that both LPS promoters were well expressed in vivo and could be detected by IVIS, mainly from the intestinal region of orally infected mice."

The use of the real-time PCR in diagnostic routine procedures has resulted in a substantial increase in confirmed bacterial meningitis cases. However, in resource-poor countries, these assays are only available in reference laboratories. Sample transportation to these laboratories is a critical constraint, as it requires specialized, high cost courier services. To overcome this barrier we evaluated the use of FTATM Elute filter paper cards for the conservation and processing of samples under normal environmental conditions, as they would be when transported from remote and under-equipped healthcare facilities to the reference centers. A total of 401 samples received in 2015 as part of Sao Paulo's national surveillance for routine diagnosis were selected for this study.The sensitivity and specificity of real-time PCR were evaluated using fresh serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples processed using our laboratory's standard DNA extraction, and processing the same samples after being dried and stored on FTATM card, and DNA extracted following the manufacturer's instructions.The sensitivities for detection of Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae from CSF dried and stored on FTATM cards were 98%, 92%, and 100%, respectively, and with serum samples were 73%, 88%, and 100%, respectively. When compared to our laboratory's standard methodology, results showed high concordance, with Kappa index ranges of 0.9877-1.00 for CSF, and 0.8004-1.00 for serum samples.The use of FTATM cards for CSF and serum conservation and transport represents a rapid, reliable, and cost-effective alternative that will allow obtaining valuable epidemiological information that would otherwise be lost."

Nutrient concentrations were above growth-rate-saturating concentrations throughout the bay, with the possible exception of phosphate at some stations. The presence of the patches therefore appeared to reflect the distribution of water temperature and variation of light penetration restricted by water turbidity. There was no patch of high phytoplankton biomass or production in a third, linear patch of water with characteristics suitable for rapid phytoplankton growth; the absence of a bloom in that patch likely reflected the fact that the width of the patch was less than the critical size required to overcome losses of phytoplankton to turbulent diffusion. The bottom waters of virtually all of the eastern half of the bay were below the depth of the mixed layer, and the lowest bottom water oxygen concentrations, 3-5 mg L-1, were found in that part of the bay. The water column in much of the remainder of the bay was within the mixed layer, and oxygen concentrations in both surface and bottom waters exceeded 5 mg L-1."

Further, recent studies have suggested that social information about actors who behave fairly or unfairly may influence the judgement of fairness in infants. Therefore, to compare the sense of fairness between infants and adults, the study using paradigm in infant research is required. We examined how social information about two characters, either prosocial or antisocial, affects the event-related potential response (ERP) to fair or unfair resource distributions in adults. In the habituation phase, participants were informed about characters' social information through their actions. One character then distributed resources fairly or unfairly, and ERP was measured at the end of the distribution. Data from eighteen adult participants were analysed. A significant interaction of social information and fairness was found for late positive potential (LPP), but a post-hoc t test revealed a significant difference between fair and unfair conditions only for actions of the antisocial character. We found that LPP can reflect the sense of fairness affected by social information. Comparison with infant studies suggests that the sense of fairness may change during development."

Burgess et al. examine how the relative expression of mutant and wild-type KRAS modulates clonal fitness and sensitivity to MEK inhibitors in a model of KrasG12D mutant acute myeloid leukemia and propose its use as a predictive biomarker. Targeting of the RAS pathway has long been a critical therapeutic challenge in oncology. Burgess et al. examine how the relative expression of mutant and wild-type KRAS modulates clonal fitness and sensitivity to MEK inhibitors in a model of KrasG12D mutant acute myeloid leukemia and propose its use as a predictive biomarker. Decades of research on Ras biology have highlighted the central role of this family of small GTPases in human malignancies (reviewed in Karnoub and Weinberg, 2008Karnoub A.E. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 517-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar and Stephen et al., 2014Stephen A.G. Esposito D. Bagni R.K. McCormick F. Cancer Cell. 2014; 25: 272-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Ras proteins transmit signals from cell surface receptors and activate downstream signaling cascades, including the RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT pathways, to regulate cell growth, differentiation, survival, motility, and adhesion. Despite tremendous interest, most strategies employed to target RAS have had less efficacy than hoped in clinical trials, due in part to a complex web of alternative pathways and feedback loops. In this issue of Cell, Burgess and colleagues demonstrate that murine leukemia cells bearing homozygous KrasG12D mutations have a clonal advantage relative to cells with an additional wild-type (WT) Kras allele, and a striking sensitivity to MEK inhibitors (Burgess et al., 2017Burgess M.R. Hwang E. Mroue R. Bielski C.M. Wandler A.M. Huang B. Firestone A.J. Young A. LaCap J.A. Crocker L. et al.Cell. 2017; 168 (this issue): 817-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Mutations that activate RAS signaling, such as mutations in RAS genes (NRAS, KRAS, or HRAS) or RAS regulators (NF1, PTPN11, or CBL), are among the most common genetic abnormalities in cancer. More than 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) bear such mutations, with NRAS and PTPN11 mutations occurring more commonly than KRAS mutations (Papaemmanuil et al., 2016Papaemmanuil E. Gerstung M. Bullinger L. Gaidzik V.I. Paschka P. Roberts N.D. Potter N.E. Heuser M. Thol F. Bolli N. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2016; 374: 2209-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (2261) Google Scholar). While oncogene mutations are traditionally considered to be dominant, with heterozygous lesions driving malignant transformation, some oncogenes have genetic amplification of the mutant allele, deletion of the WT allele, or uniparental disomy resulting in homozygosity for the oncogenic mutation. For example, mutant oncogenes including RAS and EGFR undergo focal amplification (Beroukhim et al., 2010Beroukhim R. Mermel C.H. Porter D. Wei G. Raychaudhuri S. Donovan J. Barretina J. Boehm J.S. Dobson J. Urashima M. et al.Nature. 2010; 463: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (2682) Google Scholar), and JAK2 mutations are frequently associated with uniparental disomy (Wang et al., 2014Wang L. Swierczek S.I. Lanikova L. Kim S.J. Hickman K. Walker K. Wang K. Drummond J. Doddapaneni H. Reid J.G. et al.Leukemia. 2014; 28: 938-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recurrence of such genomic events suggests that they confer a clonal advantage to a cell. In addition, alterations in the ratio of mutant to WT oncogene alleles may influence response to therapy. Burgess and colleagues tested the sensitivity of KrasG12D- driven mouse models of AML to MEK inhibition. Among the four models studied, all generated using retroviral insertional mutagenesis followed by a conditional hematopoietic-specific knock-in of KrasG12D, one model, AML101, showed increased sensitivity to the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 (PD901). In search of the causative link for this enhanced therapeutic response and subsequent evolution of PD901 resistance in this model, the authors performed a suite of analyses in samples pre- and post- PD901 treatment. These studies demonstrated duplication of the KrasG12D allele and a loss of WT Kras allele in the pre-treatment AML101 sample. In leukemia that relapsed following treatment with PD901 (AML101-R), the authors identified trisomy 6 with duplication of mutant Kras and a single copy of WT Kras. FISH analysis revealed the presence of a small pre-existing trisomy 6 subclone in AML101 prior to therapy, which expanded and became dominant at the time of relapse. Short-term in vivo competition studies demonstrated that AML101 had enhanced clonal expansion relative to AML101-R in the absence of drug treatment, while AML101 was particularly sensitive to PD901 (Figure 1). Similarly, overexpression of WT Kras in AML101 rendered it more resistant to PD901 and decreased its competitive fitness. The authors extended their observations in murine leukemia models to KRAS-mutated solid tumor cell lines. They demonstrated that higher mutant KRAS allele fraction was associated with increased sensitivity to MEK and ERK inhibition in colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines, but not in lung and pancreatic cancer cell lines. CRISPR/Cas9 editing of a KRAS WT allele to the G13D mutant allele in a KRASG13D heterozygous CRC cell line increased MEK inhibitor sensitivity, as well as RAS-GTPase activity and growth. Finally, analysis of 1,168 primary KRAS-mutant tumors across 30 different cancer types identified copy number changes involving the KRAS locus, including heterozygous loss of WT KRAS in the presence or absence of whole genome duplication, copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity, and genomic gain and amplification of KRAS mutant allele in more than half of the cases. Burgess et al. therefore propose the use of ratio of mutant to WT KRAS transcripts as a predictive biomarker in future clinical trials of MEK inhibitors. Several lines of evidence support the importance of the relative expression of mutant and WT KRAS for tumorigenesis and therapeutic responses. It has been long appreciated that amplification of mutant Ras accompanied by loss of WT Ras is a frequent event in cancer development, suggesting a tumor suppressive effect of the WT Ras protein (Bremner and Balmain, 1990Bremner R. Balmain A. Cell. 1990; 61: 407-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Bar-Sagi and colleagues demonstrated that decreased expression of WT HRAS or NRAS sensitizes KRAS-mutated cancer cell lines to DNA damaging agents (Grabocka et al., 2014Grabocka E. Pylayeva-Gupta Y. Jones M.J. Lubkov V. Yemanaberhan E. Taylor L. Jeng H.H. Bar-Sagi D. Cancer Cell. 2014; 25: 243-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition, focal mutant KRAS genomic amplifications and elevated KRAS protein expression are associated with sensitivity of cell lines to KRAS-targeted shRNAs (Singh et al., 2009Singh A. Greninger P. Rhodes D. Koopman L. Violette S. Bardeesy N. Settleman J. Cancer Cell. 2009; 15: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The current study complements these findings and stratifies KRAS-mutated cell lines into MEK inhibitor sensitive and resistant using the relative expression of mutant versus WT KRAS. It is possible that the WT KRAS allele may mediate MEK inhibitor resistance by reactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases and ERK signaling as has been seen in BRAF-mutant tumors treated with RAF inhibitors (Lito et al., 2013Lito P. Rosen N. Solit D.B. Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Future studies will be needed to understand the molecular basis of the tissue specificity in Burgess et al.’s observation, and to test whether the same principle applies to different oncogenic RAS alleles, some of which preferentially activate different downstream effector pathways. The findings here indicate that the ratio of mutant and WT RAS alleles could be a predictive biomarker for MEK inhibitors. Retrospective analysis of existing datasets from MEK inhibitor trials and carefully designed prospective studies will be critical to address this point. In human AML, the mutant RAS allele frequency tends to be low as the mutations are acquired late in disease ontogeny, complicating the determination of the zygosity of RAS mutations within an individual cell. Rapid advancement of single-cell technologies, including single-cell DNA- and RNA-sequencing, could be instrumental in this context. Since RAS mutations are generally acquired late in leukemogenesis, even complete response of a RAS-mutant clone to MEK inhibitor therapy may leave behind highly oncogenic, MEK insensitive ancestral clones. Finally, since oncogenic activation of the RAS pathway may occur through a myriad of different combinations of mutation or copy number alteration of RAS genes and regulators, it will be important to understand whether this observation holds true in cases of RAS activation by NRAS, PTPN11, and NF1, which are more frequently mutated and/or lost in AML than KRAS. Studies of genetic predictors of therapeutic response to targeted agents in cancer often focus on associations with particular mutations. The study by Burgess and colleagues illustrates that sensitivity to MEK inhibition is influenced not only by whether a KRAS mutation is present, but also by the precise configuration of mutations in KRAS alleles. Determination of the ratio of mutant and WT oncogene alleles within a single cancer cell may be critical for prediction of response to targeted cancer therapies.

https://openalex.org/W2589748240,"Vibrio cholerae experiences a highly hostile environment at human intestine which triggers the induction of various heat shock genes. The hchA gene product of V. cholerae O395, referred to a hypothetical intracellular protease/amidase VcHsp31, is one such stress-inducible homodimeric protein. Our current study demonstrates that VcHsp31 is endowed with molecular chaperone, amidopeptidase and robust methylglyoxalase activities. Through site directed mutagenesis coupled with biochemical assays on VcHsp31, we have confirmed the role of residues in the vicinity of the active site towards amidopeptidase and methylglyoxalase activities. VcHsp31 suppresses the aggregation of insulin in vitro in a dose dependent manner. Through crystal structures of VcHsp31 and its mutants, grown at various temperatures, we demonstrate that VcHsp31 acquires two (Type-I and Type-II) dimeric forms. Type-I dimer is similar to EcHsp31 where two VcHsp31 monomers associate in eclipsed manner through several intersubunit hydrogen bonds involving their P-domains. Type-II dimer is a novel dimeric organization, where some of the intersubunit hydrogen bonds are abrogated and each monomer swings out in the opposite directions centering at their P-domains, like twisting of wet cloth. Normal mode analysis (NMA) of Type-I dimer shows similar movement of the individual monomers. Upon swinging, a dimeric surface of ~400Å2, mostly hydrophobic in nature, is uncovered which might bind partially unfolded protein substrates. We propose that, in solution, VcHsp31 remains as an equilibrium mixture of both the dimers. With increase in temperature, transformation to Type-II form having more exposed hydrophobic surface, occurs progressively accounting for the temperature dependent increase of chaperone activity of VcHsp31."
https://openalex.org/W2589750670,"Gln27Glu (rs1042714) polymorphism of the β2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) has been association with cardiovascular functionality in healthy subjects. However, it is unknown whether the presence of the ADRB2 Gln27Glu polymorphism influences neurovascular responses during exercise in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). We tested the hypothesis that patients with ACS homozygous for the Gln allele would have increased muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) responses and decreased forearm vascular conductance (FVC) responses during exercise compared with patients carrying the Glu allele (Gln27Glu and Glu27Glu). In addition, exercise training would restore these responses in Gln27Gln patients.Thirty-days after an ischemic event, 61 patients with ACS without ventricular dysfunction were divided into 2 groups: (1) Gln27Gln (n = 35, 53±1years) and (2) Gln27Glu+Glu27Glu (n = 26, 52±2years). MSNA was directly measured using the microneurography technique, blood pressure (BP) was measured with an automatic oscillometric device, and blood flow was measured using venous occlusion plethysmography. MSNA, mean BP, and FVC were evaluated at rest and during a 3-min handgrip exercise. The MSNA (P = 0.02) and mean BP (P = 0.04) responses during exercise were higher in the Gln27Gln patients compared with that in the Gln27Glu+Glu27Glu patients. No differences were found in FVC. Two months of exercise training significantly decreased the MSNA levels at baseline (P = 0.001) and in their response during exercise (P = 0.02) in Gln27Gln patients, but caused no changes in Gln27Glu+Glu27Glu patients. Exercise training increased FVC responses in Gln27Glu+Glu27Glu patients (P = 0.03), but not in Gln27Gln patients.The exaggerated MSNA and mean BP responses during exercise suggest an increased cardiovascular risk in patients with ACS and Gln27Gln polymorphism. Exercise training emerges as an important strategy for restoring this reflex control. Gln27Glu polymorphism of ADRB2 influences exercise-induced vascular adaptation in patients with ACS."
