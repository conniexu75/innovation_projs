https://openalex.org/W1988006132,"The late Precambrian tube-forming Cloudina, the earliest known animal to produce a mineralized exoskeleton, shows evidence of having been attacked by shell-boring organisms. Of more than 500 tubes from Shaanxi Province, China, 2.7% have rounded holes 40 to 400 micrometers in diameter. The relation between the size of the holes and the width of the bored tubes suggests that the attacking organism was a predator, selecting its prey for size. If true, this would be the oldest case of predation in the fossil record and would support the hypothesis that selection pressures from predation was a significant factor in the evolution of animal skeletons around the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary."
https://openalex.org/W2036983976,"The structure, energetics, and dynamics of shock conditions generated in a nano-cluster upon impact on a crystalline surface are investigated with molecular-dynamics simulations for a 561-atom argon cluster incident with a velocity of 3 kilometers per second onto a sodium chloride surface. The ""piling-up"" shock phenomenon occurring upon impact, coupled with cascades of energy and momentum transfer processes and inertial confinement of material in the interior of the cluster, creates a transient medium lasting for about a picosecond and characterized by extreme local density, pressure, and kinetic temperature. The nano-shock conditions and impulsive nature of interactions in the newly formed compressed nonequilibrium environment open avenues for studying chemical reactivity and dynamics catalyzed via cluster impact."
https://openalex.org/W4252272805,"An atomic force microscope (AFM) has been used to machine complex patterns and to form free structural objects in thin layers of MoO(3) grown on the surface of MoS(2). The AFM tip can pattern lines with </=10-nanometer resolution and then image the resulting structure without perturbation by controlling the applied load. Distinct MoO(3) structures can also be defined by AFM machining, and furthermore these objects can be manipulated on the MoS(2) substrate surface with the AFM tip. These results suggest application to nanometer-scale diffraction gratings, high-resolution lithography masks, and possibly the assembly of nanostructures with novel properties."
https://openalex.org/W2051296018,Hydrographic time-series data recorded during the past 42 years in the upper 500 meters off the coast of southern California indicate that temperatures have increased by 0.8 degrees C uniformly in the upper 100 meters and that temperatures have risen significantly to depths of about 300 meters. The effect of warming the surface layer of the ocean and there by expanding the water column has been to raise sea level by 0.9 +/- 0.2 millimeter per year. Tide gauge records along the coast are coherent with steric height and show upward trends in sea level that vary from about 1 to 3 millimeters per year.
https://openalex.org/W2083554546,"An extremely small, conically shaped Pt microelectrode tip (with a radius of 30 nanometers) and the precise positioning capabilities of the scanning electrochemical microscope were used to penetrate a thin (200 nanometers) polymer film and obtain directly the standard potential and kinetic parameters of an electrode reaction within the film. The thickness of the film was determined while it was immersed in and swollen by an electrolyte solution. The film studied was the perfluorosulfonate Nafion containing Os(bpy)(3)(2+) (bpy, 2,2'-bipyridine) cast on an indium tin oxide surface. The steady-state response at the ultramicroelectrode allowed direct determination of the rate constant for heterogeneous electron transfer K(o) and the diffusion coefficient D without complications caused by transport in the liquid phase, charge exchange at the liquid-polymer interface, and resistive drop."

https://openalex.org/W1993690923,"Incommensurate charge density waves (CDWs) in some materials form domains within which the CDWs may be commensurate. However, two questions have remained controversial: What is the geometrical structure of these domains, and are they or are they not identical on the surface and in the bulk? To address these issues in the triclinic (T) phase of tantalum disuffide (1T-TaS(2)) the CDW domain structure has been accurately determined for both the crystal surface and the crystal bulk. By analyzing the bulk CDW wave vectors and associated satellites by x-ray diffraction, it is found that the bulk contains three dimensionally ordered striped domains that have previously been misidentified. Scanning tunneling microscope images show that the striped domain configuration propagates unaltered to the crystal surface, and their Fourier transforms yield the same satellite positions as the x-rays. These observations demonstrate that the surface and bulk CDW domain structures in 1T-TaS(2) are identical."
