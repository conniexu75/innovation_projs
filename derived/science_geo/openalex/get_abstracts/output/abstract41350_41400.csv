We identify two short regions of GAL4, each of which activates transcription when fused to the DNA-binding region of the molecule. Very large portions of GAL4 are not required for gene activation."

https://openalex.org/W2001803423,"We have isolated cDNA clones encoding the beta subunit of the human LFA-1, Mac-1, and p150,95 family of leukocyte adhesion proteins. The deduced 769-amino-acid sequence defines a cysteine-rich polypeptide with the characteristic features of an integral membrane protein. Peptide sequence data, Northern blot analysis, and Southern blot analysis suggest that a single gene encodes the beta subunit of all three leukocyte adhesion proteins. There is 45% homology between the beta subunit sequence and band III of integrin, a chick fibronectin and laminin receptor. This homology defines a new supergene family of cellular adhesion proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2047855213,"When DNA synthesis is inhibited, the mRNAs coding for the replication-dependent histone proteins are selectively destabilized. The histone genes have been altered and reintroduced into tk- mouse L cells by cotransfection with the herpesvirus thymidine kinase gene. Two features of the mRNA are necessary for regulation of degradation: first, the hairpin loop must be present at the 3' end of the histone mRNA; and second, the histone mRNA must be capable of being translated to within 300 nucleotides of the 3' end of the RNA. Polyadenylated histone mRNAs are stable, as are histone mRNAs that contain in-frame termination codons early in the coding region or 500 nucleotide 3' untranslated regions with a normal hairpin loop at the 3' end."
https://openalex.org/W2077419364,"We have isolated cis-acting mutations in the gene encoding the yeast vacuolar protein carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) that result in missorting and aberrant secretion of up to 95% of newly synthesized CPY. The CPY polypeptides synthesized by these mutants use the late secretory pathway to exit the cell, since the late-acting sec1 mutation prevents their secretion. The mutant versions of CPY are secreted as the proCPY zymogen and are enzymatically activatable in vivo and in vitro. All the mutations, including small deletions and an amino acid substitution, map to the amino-terminal propeptide region and define a discrete yeast vacuolar localization domain whose integrity is required for efficient sorting of the CPY zymogen. Thus, the N-terminal propeptide of CPY carries out at least three functions: it mediates translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum, renders the enzyme inactive during transit, and targets the molecule to the vacuole."
https://openalex.org/W2023314628,"We have mapped a sequence determinant in the vacuolar glycoprotein carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) that directs intracellular sorting of this enzyme. Through the study of hybrid proteins, consisting of amino-terminal segments of CPY fused to the secretory enzyme invertase, we have found that the N-terminal 50 amino acids of CPY are sufficient to direct delivery of a CPY-Inv hybrid protein to the yeast vacuole. Our data suggest that this 50 amino acid segment of CPY contains two distinct functional domains; an N-terminal signal peptide followed by a segment of 30 amino acids that contains the vacuolar sorting signal. Deletion of this putative vacuole sorting signal from an otherwise wild-type CPY protein leads to missorting of CPY. Furthermore, examination of the Asn-linked oligosaccharides present on CPY and CPY-Inv hybrid proteins suggests that an additional determinant in CPY specifies the extent to which these proteins are glycosylated in the Golgi complex."
https://openalex.org/W2082918093,"Isochromosomal, respiratory-deficient yeast strains, such as a mit-, a hypersuppressive petite, and a petite lacking mitochondrial DNA, are phenotypically identical in spite of differences in their mitochondrial genomes. Subtractive hybridizations of complementary DNA's to polyadenylated RNA isolated from derepressed cultures of these strains reveal the presence of nuclear-encoded transcripts whose abundance varies not only between them and their respiratory-competent parent, but among the respiratory-deficient strains themselves. Transcripts of some nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins, like cytochrome c and the alpha and beta subunits of the mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase, whose abundance is affected by glucose or heme, do not vary. In the absence of major metabolic variables, yeast cells seem to respond to the quality and quantity of mitochondrial DNA and modulate the levels of nuclear-encoded RNA's, perhaps as a means of intergenomic regulation."

https://openalex.org/W1589662393,"Reticulocytes contain a nonlysosomal proteolytic pathway that requires ATP and ubiquitin. By DEAE chromatography and gel filtration, we were able to fractionate the ATP-dependent system into a 30-300-kDa fraction that catalyzes the ATP-dependent conjugation of ubiquitin to substrates (Conjugation Fraction) and a high mass fraction (greater than 450 kDa) necessary for hydrolysis of the conjugated proteins. The latter contains two distinct proteases. One protease is unusually large, approximately 1500 kDa, and degrades proteins only when ATP and the conjugating fractions are added. This activity precipitates at 0-38% (NH4)2SO4 saturation and is essential for ATP-dependent proteolysis. Like crude extracts, it is labile in the absence of nucleotides and is inhibited by heparin, poly(Glu-Ala-Tyr), 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, hemin, decavanadate, N-ethylmaleimide, and various peptide chloromethyl ketones. It lacks amino-peptidase and insulin-degrading activities and does not require tRNA for activity. The ubiquitin-conjugate degrading enzyme, which we suggest be named UCDEN, is inactive against substrates that cannot undergo ubiquitin conjugation. The smaller protease (670 kDa), which precipitates at 40-80% (NH4)2SO4 saturation, does not require ATP or ubiquitin and is therefore not required for ATP-dependent proteolysis. It is stimulated by N-ethylmaleimide and 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin and is stable at 37 degrees C. It hydrolyzes fluorometric tetrapeptides and proteins, including proteins which cannot be conjugated to ubiquitin. Thus, reticulocytes contain two large cytosolic proteases: one is essential for the degradation of ubiquitin conjugates, while the function of the other is uncertain."
https://openalex.org/W1596185709,"A hydrophobic amine, SCH 28080, 2-methyl-8-(phenylmethoxy)imidazo(1,2a)pyridine-3-acetonitrile, previously shown to inhibit gastric acid secretion in vivo and in vitro, was also shown to inhibit basal and stimulated aminopyrine accumulation in isolated gastric glands when histamine, high K+ concentrations, or dibutyryl cAMP were used as secretagogues. Stimulated, but not basal, oxygen consumption was also inhibited. Neutralization of the acid space of the parietal cell by high concentrations of the weak base, imidazole, reduced the potency of the drug, suggesting that SCH 28080 was active when protonated. Studies on the isolated H+,K+-ATPase showed that the compound inhibited the enzyme competitively with K+, whether ATP or p-nitrophenyl phosphate were used as substrates. In contrast, the inhibition was mixed with respect to p-nitrophenyl phosphate and uncompetitive with respect to ATP. The drug reduced the steady state level of the phosphoenzyme but not the observed rate constant for phosphoenzyme formation in the absence of K+ nor the quantity of phosphoenzyme reacting with K+. The drug quenched the fluorescence of fluorescein isothiocyanate-modified enzyme and also inhibited the ATP-independent K+ exchange reaction of the H+,K+-ATPase. Its action on gastric acid secretion can be explained by inhibition of the H+,K+-ATPase by reversible complexation of the enzyme. This class of compound, therefore, acts as a reversible inhibitor of gastric acid secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1967013096,"We have investigated the use of the Escherichia coli lac operator-repressor system to regulate expression of transfected genes in mammalian cells. We show that lac repressor produced in mouse L cells by transfection of a lacl expression vector blocks transcription of an MSV-CAT fusion gene when the lac operator is inserted at any one of the following sites within the promoter region: between the initiation codon (ATG) and the transcription start site; between the transcription start and TATA box regions; or upstream of the TATA box region. This last result suggests that the repressor may prevent protein-protein interactions involved in transcription activation. The inducer IPTG causes a marked derepression of CAT expression. The lac repressor-operator complex may be useful as an on/off ""switch"" in the regulation of gene expression for gene transfer experiments."

https://openalex.org/W1602119380,"Pantothenate kinase catalyzes the rate-controlling step in the coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthetic pathway, and its activity is modulated by the size of the CoA pool. The effect of nonesterified CoA (CoASH) and CoA thioesters on the activity of pantothenate kinase was examined to determine which component of the CoA pool is the most effective regulator of the enzyme from Escherichia coli. CoASH was five times more potent than acetyl-CoA or other CoA thioesters as an inhibitor of pantothenate kinase activity in vitro. Inhibition by CoA thioesters was not due to their hydrolysis to CoASH. CoASH inhibition was competitive with respect to ATP, thus providing a mechanism to coordinate CoA production with the energy state of the cell. There were considerable differences in the size and composition of the CoA pool in cells grown on different carbon sources, and a carbon source shift experiment was used to test the inhibitory effect of the different CoA species in vivo. A shift from glucose to acetate as the carbon source resulted in an increase in the CoASH:acetyl-CoA ratio from 0.7 to 4.3. The alteration in the CoA pool composition was associated with the selective inhibition of pantothenate phosphorylation, consistent with CoASH being a more potent regulator of pantothenate kinase activity in vivo. These results demonstrate that CoA biosynthesis is regulated through feedback inhibition of pantothenate kinase primarily by the concentration of CoASH and secondarily by the size of the CoA thioester pool."
https://openalex.org/W2063910839,"The HO gene, which encodes an endonuclease responsible for initiating mating type switching in yeast, is transcribed at START during the cell cycle of mother cells but not at all during the cell cycle of daughter cells. At least six genes, called SWI1–6, are necessary for HO transcription. We describe the isolation and characterization of mutations in two new genes called SDI1 and SDI2, which partially suppress the requirement for SWI5 and which cause daughter cells to express HO. The analysis of mating type switching in swi5− sdi1− and SWI5+ sdi1− strains suggests that the mother cell specificity of HO transcription is due exclusively to the selective action of SWI5 in mother cells. SDI1 encodes (or regulates) a repressor protein that binds to the HO promoter and prevents HO transcription in daughter cells by causing HO to be fully SWI5 dependent."
https://openalex.org/W1540416564,"Phospholipase C cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to form both inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and inositol 1,2-cyclic 4,5-trisphosphate (cInsP3). The further metabolism of these inositol trisphosphates is determined by two enzymes: a 3-kinase and a 5-phosphomonoesterase. The first enzyme converts Ins(1,4,5)P3 to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (InsP4), while the latter forms inositol 1,4-bisphosphate and inositol 1,2-cyclic 4-bisphosphate from Ins(1,4,5)P3 and cInsP3, respectively. The current studies show that the 3-kinase is unable to phosphorylate cInsP3. Also, the 5-phosphomonoesterase hydrolyzes InsP4 with an apparent Km of 0.5-1.0 microM to form inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate at a maximal velocity approximately 1/30 that for Ins(1,4,5)P3. The apparent affinity of the enzyme for the three substrates is InsP4 greater than Ins(1,4,5)P3 greater than cInsP3; however, the rate at which the phosphatase hydrolyzes these substrates is Ins(1,4,5)P3 greater than cInsP3 greater than InsP4. The 5-phosphomonoesterase and 3-kinase enzymes may control the levels of inositol trisphosphates in stimulated cells. The 3-kinase has a low apparent Km for Ins(1,4,5)P3 as does the 5-phosphomonoesterase for InsP4, implying that the formation and breakdown of InsP4 may proceed when both it and its precursor are present at low levels. Ins(1,4,5)P3 is utilized by both the 3-kinase and 5-phosphomonoesterase, while cInsP3 is utilized relatively poorly only by the 5-phosphomonoesterase. These findings imply that inositol cyclic trisphosphate may be metabolized slowly after its formation in stimulated cells."
https://openalex.org/W1617966995,"We have previously reported that alpha-thrombin induces in resting hamster fibroblasts (CCL39) the formation of inositol phosphates (IP) by activating a GTP-binding protein (G protein) sensitive to pertussis toxin (Paris, S., and Pouyssegur, J. (1986) EMBO J. 5, 55-60). Here we show that IP formation in CCL39 cells can also be induced by NaF with AlCl3 and by vanadate. In the presence of Li+, IP accumulation is linear over 30 min with no detectable lag and is concentration-dependent. NaF alone is slightly stimulatory, but a marked potentiation is observed in the presence of AlCl3, by itself without effect. Maximal stimulation is obtained with 10 mM NaF and 3 microM AlCl3, and with vanadate half-maximal effect is achieved at 0.3 mM. Both stimulations are markedly inhibited (up to 80%) by pertussis toxin (half-maximal inhibition at 1-2 ng/ml). We therefore conclude that phospholipase C is stimulated by NaF plus AlCl3 (presumably acting as AlF-4) and by vanadate by direct activation of the regulatory G protein. In addition, NaF inhibits the inositol-1-phosphatase, but this effect is not potentiated by AlCl3. Similarly, vanadate inhibits inositol trisphosphate degradation. Maximal stimulations of phospholipase C by AlF-4 and vanadate are not additive, whereas they are both additive with thrombin effects. Pretreatment of cells for 15 min with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate nearly completely abolishes induction of IP formation by AlF-4 and vanadate, suggesting that protein kinase C exerts a feedback negative control either on the G protein or on phospholipase C itself. An increase in cellular cyclic AMP similarly results in a marked attenuation of AlF-4-induced IP formation, indicating that activation of phospholipase C can be controlled also by cyclic AMP. However, the stimulatory effect of AlF-4 on phospholipase C is clearly dissociated from its effect on the adenylate cyclase system."
https://openalex.org/W2137286428,"Formation of oxyperoxidase from the reaction of ferryl horseradish peroxidase with H2O2 is inhibited by a small amount of tetranitromethane (TNM), a powerful scavenger of superoxide anion radical. The inhibition by TNM, however, does not exceed 35% as the TNM concentration is increased above 5 microM. The stoichiometry of the reaction in the presence of TNM suggests the following equation for TNM-sensitive formation of oxyperoxidase. Ferryl peroxidase + H2O2----(ferric peroxidase + O2- + H+)----oxyperoxidase The kinetic study on the TNM-resistant formation of oxyperoxidase suggests that the displacement of the oxygen with H2O2 takes place at the sixth coordination position at maximal rates of 0.048 and 0.054 s-1 for peroxidases A and C, respectively, at 5 degrees C. The TNM-sensitive and -resistant reactions are concluded to occur in parallel, and both yield oxyperoxidase. In either mechanism, the protonated form of ferryl peroxidase is active and the pK alpha value is 7.1 for peroxidase A and 8.6 for peroxidase C. Oxyperoxidase decomposes spontaneously with a large activation energy (23.0 kcal/mol), and the reaction of ferryl peroxidase with H2O2 reaches a steady level of oxyperoxidase, which depends on pH and the concentration of H2O2."
https://openalex.org/W1560257150,"Particles closely resembling rat high density lipoproteins (HDL) in terms of equilibrium density profile and particle size were prepared by sonication of apoA-I with a microemulsion made with egg lecithin and cholesterol oleate. These particles, like authentic HDL, allowed selective uptake of their cholesterol ester moieties by cultured cells without parallel uptake of the particle itself. That uptake was saturable and competed by HDL. In rats, the plasma decay kinetics and sites of uptake of a cholesteryl ether tracer were similar whether that tracer was incorporated into synthetic or authentic HDL. Synthetic particles containing other apoproteins were made by generally the same method, but using in place of apoA-I either a mixture of rat apoCs or apoE that was either competent or reductively methylated to prevent interaction with the B/E receptor. These particles, of lower density and larger Stokes radius than those made with apoA-I, also allowed selective uptake of cholesterol esters, albeit with a lower degree of selectivity than in the case of apoA-I. Thus a specific apoprotein component in the subject lipoprotein particle is not required for selective uptake. However, selective uptake was shown to be a function of particle density or size, and part of the difference in rates of selective uptake from the particles made with various apoproteins was explained by their differences in density or size."
https://openalex.org/W127362080,"The energy requirement for protein translocation across membrane was studied with inverted membrane vesicles from an Escherichia coli strain that lacks all components of F1F0-ATPase. An ompF-lpp chimeric protein was used as a model secretory protein. Translocation of the chimeric protein into membrane vesicles was totally inhibited in the presence of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) or valinomycin and nigericin and partially inhibited when either valinomycin or nigericin alone was added. Depletion of ATP with glucose and hexokinase resulted in the complete inhibition of the translocation process, and the inhibition was suppressed by the addition of ATP-generating systems such as phosphoenolpyruvate-pyruvate kinase or creatine phosphate-creatine kinase. These results indicate that both the proton motive force and ATP are required for the translocation process. The results further suggest that both the membrane potential and the chemical gradient of protons (delta pH), of which the proton motive force is composed, participate in the translocation process."
https://openalex.org/W1556144574,"Cellular retinol binding protein II (CRBP II) is an abundant, 134-residue protein present in the small intestinal epithelium. It is thought to participate in the uptake and/or intracellular metabolism of vitamin A. We have isolated and sequenced the rat CRBP II gene. Its four exons span 0.65 kilobases and are interrupted by three introns with an aggregate length of 19.5 kilobases. Southern blot hybridization analysis indicated that this gene is highly conserved in rats, mice, and humans. CRBP II belongs to a protein family that contains eight known members. Computer-assisted comparative sequence analyses indicated that a region of internal homology spans its first two exons and that oligopeptide domains specified by these first two exons exhibit significant homology to all other family members as well as to a portion of the all-trans-retinol binding domain that has previously been defined in serum retinol binding protein. The CRBP II gene was mapped in mice using recombinant inbred strains and restriction fragment length polymorphisms. It is located on chromosome 9 within 5.3 centimorgans of the phosphoglucomutase-3 locus and is closely linked (within 3.0 centimorgans) to the gene specifying a highly homologous intracellular retinol binding protein known as CRBP. Mouse-human somatic cell hybrids were used to determine that both the CRBP and CRBP II genes are located on human chromosome 3."
https://openalex.org/W1577905636,"Escherichia coli helicase II has been purified to near homogeneity from cells harboring a multicopy plasmid containing the structural gene for helicase II, uvrD. In this paper a detailed description of the single-stranded DNA-dependent nucleoside 5'-triphosphatase and helicase reactions catalyzed by helicase II is presented. The results of this study suggest that nucleoside 5'-triphosphate hydrolysis provides the energy required for translocation of the enzyme along single-stranded DNA. Measurements of the rate of ATP hydrolysis using a variety of single-stranded DNAs of known structure and length suggest a processive translocation mechanism for helicase II. Single-stranded DNA coated with either Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) or bacteriophage T4 gene 32 protein fails to support helicase II ATPase activity. Moreover, helicase II is apparently unable to displace a molecule of bound SSB protein from single-stranded DNA when it is encountered in the process of translocation along a single-stranded DNA effector. The helicase reaction has been characterized using an in vitro strand displacement helicase assay. The helicase reaction requires concomitant nucleoside 5'-triphosphatase hydrolysis that is satisfied by the hydrolysis of either rATP or dATP. As the length of duplex DNA present in the partial duplex helicase substrate is increased from 71 base pairs to 343 base pairs, the fraction of duplex DNA molecules that are unwound by helicase II decreases in the absence of any accessory proteins. However, the total number of base pairs of duplex DNA unwound depends primarily on the amount of enzyme added to the helicase reaction and not on the length of the duplex DNA present in the partial duplex DNA substrate. These data suggest the number of base pairs of duplex DNA unwound is directly proportional with the concentration of helicase II in the reaction mixture. In addition, the rate of the unwinding reaction is independent of the length of the duplex DNA available for unwinding. Helicase II has been shown to dissociate from single-stranded DNA molecules infrequently acting as an ATPase. However, the enzyme dissociates from partial duplex helicase substrates more frequently. This suggests a more distributive reaction mechanism on duplex DNA than was observed on single-stranded DNA substrates. The fraction of 343-base pair partial duplex DNA molecules unwound by helicase II can be increased by the addition of appropriate concentrations of E. coli SSB to the reaction. This suggests that helicase II and SSB may act in a concerted reaction to unwind duplex DNA."
https://openalex.org/W123355458,"The influence of phospholipid on thrombin-thrombomodulin-catalyzed activation of protein C has been studied by incorporating thrombomodulin into vesicles by dialysis from octyl glucoside-phospholipid mixtures. Thrombomodulin was incorporated into vesicles ranging from neutral (100% phosphatidylcholine) to highly charged (30% phosphatidylserine and 70% phosphatidylcholine). Thrombomodulin is randomly oriented in vesicles of different phospholipid composition. Incorporation of thrombomodulin into phosphatidylcholine, with or without phosphatidylserine, alters the Ca2+ concentration dependence of protein C activation. Soluble thrombomodulin showed a half-maximal rate of activation at 580 microM Ca2+, whereas half-maximal rates of activation of liposome-reconstituted thrombomodulin were obtained between 500 microM Ca2+ and 2 mM Ca2+, depending on the composition (protein:phospholipid) of the liposomes. The Ca2+ dependence of protein C activation fits a simple hyperbola for the soluble activator, while the Ca2+ dependence of the membrane-associated complex is distinctly sigmoidal with a Hill coefficient greater than 2.4. In contrast, the Ca2+ dependence of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domainless protein C activation is unchanged by membrane reconstitution (1/2 max = 53 +/- 10 microM) and fits a simple rectangular hyperbola. Incorporation of thrombomodulin into pure phosphatidylcholine vesicles reduces the Km for protein C from 7.6 +/- 2 to 0.7 +/- 0.2 microM. Increasing phosphatidylserine to 20% decreased the Km for protein C further to 0.1 +/- 0.02 microM. Membrane incorporation has no influence on the activation of protein C from which the Gla residues are removed proteolytically (Km = 6.4 +/- 0.5 microM). The Km for protein C observed on endothelial cells is more similar to the Km observed when thrombomodulin (TM) is incorporated into pure phosphatidylcholine vesicles than into negatively charged vesicles, suggesting that the protein C-binding site on endothelial cells does not involve negatively charged phospholipids. In support of this concept, we observed that prothrombin and fragment 1, which bind to negatively charged phospholipids, do not inhibit protein C activation on endothelial cells or TM incorporated into phosphatidylcholine vesicles, but do inhibit when TM is incorporated into phosphatidylcholine:phosphatidylserine vesicles. These studies suggest that neutral phospholipids lead to exposure of a site, probably on thrombomodulin, capable of recognizing the Gla domain of protein C."
https://openalex.org/W1556752416,"Final steps in the synthesis of platelet activating factor (PAF) occur via two enzymatic reactions: the acetylation of 1-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine by a specific acetyltransferase or the transfer of the phosphocholine base group from CDP-choline to 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol by a dithiothreitol (DTT)-insensitive cholinephosphotransferase. Our studies demonstrate that rat kidney inner medulla microsomes synthesize PAF primarily via the DTT-insensitive cholinephosphotransferase since the specific activity of this enzyme is greater than 100-fold higher than the acetyltransferase. The two cholinephosphotransferases that catalyze the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine and PAF have similar Mg2+ or Mn2+ requirements and are inhibited by Ca2+. Also topographic experiments indicated that both activities are located on the cytoplasmic face of microsomal vesicles. PAF synthesis was slightly stimulated by 10 mM DTT, whereas the enzymatic synthesis of phosphatidylcholine was inhibited greater than 95% under the same conditions. The concept of two separate enzymes for PAF and phosphatidylcholine synthesis is further substantiated by the differences in the two microsomal cholinephosphotransferase activities with respect to pH optima, substrate specificities, and their sensitivities to temperature, deoxycholate, or ethanol. Study of the substrate specificities of the DTT-insensitive cholinephosphotransferase showed that the enzyme prefers a lipid substrate with 16:0 or 18:1 sn-1-alkyl chains. Short chain esters at the sn-2 position (acetate or propionate) are utilized by the DTT-insensitive cholinephosphotransferase, but analogs with acetamide or methoxy substituents at the sn-2 position are not substrates. Also, CDP-choline is the preferred water-soluble substrate when compared to CDP-ethanolamine. Utilization of endogenous neutral lipids as a substrate by the DTT-insensitive cholinephosphotransferase demonstrated that sufficient levels of alkylacetylglycerols are normally present in rat kidney microsomes to permit the synthesis of physiological quantities of PAF. These data suggest the renal DTT-insensitive cholinephosphotransferase could be a potentially important enzyme in the regulation of systemic blood pressure."
https://openalex.org/W1595513249,"The molecular basis of the familial apoE deficiency was investigated by gene cloning and comparative expression studies of the normal and the deficient apoE gene. For the latter studies the apoE genes were placed under the control of the mouse metallothionein I promoter in a bovine papilloma virus vector. The studies showed that in the normal gene the mouse metallothionein I promoter directs the synthesis of normal apoE mRNA and protein. In contrast, in the deficient apoE gene the same promoter directs the synthesis of two abnormal apoE mRNA forms, which are similar to those observed in the peripheral blood monocyte macrophage cultures of the patient. Restriction analysis of the cloned gene and partial DNA sequence has shown an A to G substitution in the penultimate 3' nucleotide of the third intron of the apoE gene. This single base substitution abolishes the correct 3' splice site thus creating two abnormally spliced mRNA forms. The smaller form contains 53 nucleotides and the larger form contains the entire third intron of the apoE gene. Both of these mRNA species contain chain termination codons within the intronic sequence and code for short apoE peptides that are not detectable by gel electrophoretic techniques. These findings show that this form of familial apoE deficiency results from a point mutation in the 3' splice junction of the third intron of the apoE gene. Furthermore, the expression system we have employed to study apoE deficiency can be utilized to analyze a broad spectrum of genetic diseases associated with mRNA processing mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2020425157,"We have undertaken a detailed structure-function analysis of v-fos protein, taking the ability to induce transformation and immortalization as criteria of biological activity. Our results demonstrate that the evolutionarily conserved center region of fos, comprising ca. 28% of the protein, is indispensable for its function. A single amino acid change (Glu 138----Val 138) in this region activates the immortalizing potential of v-fos without affecting its transforming capacity. The presence of additional either N- or C-terminal amino acids, however, is required for efficient expression of a stable protein, and significantly increases its biological activity. In contrast, sequences in the C-terminal half (between positions 228 and 267) strongly downmodulate the transforming activity of v-fos protein without decreasing its immortalizing potential."
https://openalex.org/W1540041742,"In the preceding paper (Paris, S., and Pouyssegur J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 1970-1976), AlF4- and vanadate have been shown to induce inositol phosphate formation in resting hamster fibroblasts (CCL39). In this study, we show that these two phosphate analogs are good tools to explore the causal relationship between phosphoinositide breakdown and early mitogenic events. AlF4- can activate, very similarly to the mitogen alpha-thrombin: the amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ antiport, the bumetanide-sensitive Na+/K+/Cl- co-transport, and the expression of c-myc mRNA. The link between phospholipase C activation and these early events of the mitogenic response is demonstrated by the similarity of all dose-response curves for NaF and AlCl3 and by the common sensitivity of the four events to pertussis toxin. Vanadate likewise stimulates the Na+/H+ antiport through a pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway. On longer incubations, both fluoride and vanadate were found to be toxic and failed to induce DNA synthesis. Therefore, we have used pertussis toxin to investigate the link between phospholipase C activation and commitment to DNA synthesis. We show that pertussis toxin strikingly inhibits thrombin-induced reinitiation of DNA synthesis but does not affect the stimulation by the epidermal or fibroblast growth factors, two mitogens that do not stimulate phosphoinositide breakdown in CCL39 cells. In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that activation of phospholipase C, if not an obligatory step in the action of all growth factors, plays a crucial role in the mitogenic signaling pathway of alpha-thrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1568892768,"The synthesis and processing of the human lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A was examined in normal and Fabry fibroblasts. In normal cells, alpha-galactosidase A was synthesized as an Mr = 50,500 precursor, which contained phosphate groups in oligosaccharide chains cleavable by endoglucosaminidase H. The precursor was processed via ill-defined intermediates to a mature Mr 46,000 form. Processing was complete within 3-7 days after synthesis. In the presence of NH4Cl and in I-cell fibroblasts, the majority of newly synthesized alpha-galactosidase A was secreted as an Mr = 52,000 form. For comparison, the processing and stability of alpha-galactosidase A were examined in fibroblasts from five unrelated patients with Fabry disease, which is caused by deficient alpha-galactosidase A activity. In one cell line, synthesis of immunologically cross-reacting polypeptides was not detectable. In another, the synthesis, processing, and stability of alpha-galactosidase A was indistinguishable from that in normal fibroblasts. In a third Fabry cell line, the mutation retarded the maturation of alpha-galactosidase A. Finally, in two cell lines, alpha-galactosidase A polypeptides were synthesized that were rapidly degraded following delivery to lysosomes. These results clearly indicate that Fabry disease comprises a heterogeneous group of mutations affecting synthesis, processing, and stability of alpha-galactosidase A."
https://openalex.org/W1586265889,"The characteristics of the Ah receptor from rat liver were investigated following the incubation of cytosol with [3H]2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) under various conditions, and using DEAE- and DNA-Sepharose chromatography and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. These studies indicated that the Ah receptor can exist in three distinct forms in vitro that are dependent on the presence or absence of TCDD and the duration and temperature of incubation. The unoccupied receptor was distinguished by its elution from DEAE-Sepharose columns at 0.20-0.23 M NaCl and lack of affinity for DNA-Sepharose. Following the incubation of the unoccupied receptor with [3H]TCDD, two occupied forms were distinguished based on their overall surface charges and affinities for DNA. One of these forms was predominant following short incubations (2 h) with [3H]TCDD at a low temperature (0 degree C) and was characterized by having the same elution profile on DEAE-Sepharose as the unoccupied form, but demonstrated some affinity for DNA. Another occupied form was predominant following an incubation for a longer time (20 h, 0 degree C) or at an elevated temperature (2 h, 20 degrees C). This form had an overall surface charge that was less negative and a greater affinity for DNA. These changes in receptor characteristics were dependent on the presence of TCDD and were not accompanied by apparent changes in the sedimentation coefficients of the two occupied forms. Anion exchange chromatography of the [3H]TCDD-receptor complex extracted from hepatic nuclei of [3H]TCDD-treated rats indicated that the ligand-induced change of the unoccupied receptor to a less negatively charged form had occurred in vivo. These results indicated a biochemical heterogeneity of the Ah receptor and suggested the occurrence of a ligand- and temperature-dependent transformation process in vivo and in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W61751351,"The present investigation using molecular cloning and sequence analysis concerns the examination of the molecular basis for different expression patterns of two types of the rat kininogen genes. We show that the low molecular weight and high molecular weight forms of K kininogens are produced from a single gene through alternative usage of two 3'-coding regions, whereas only the low molecular weight forms of T kininogens are generated as a result of several mutational changes in the high molecular weight-specifying regions of both T-I and T-II kininogen genes. The mutational changes include a nucleotide substitution at the polyadenylation/processing signal site, nucleotide deletions resulting in the frame-shift mutation, and an insertion of the type 2 Alu-equivalent sequence. Because kininogens represent a multifunctional protein comprising the proteinase-inhibitory activity, the kinin moiety, and the clotting activity, these results present evidence indicating the molecular basis for the disappearance of a part of the gene functions. We also show that the K and T kininogen genes as well as the two T kininogen genes are extremely homologous, excluding and including the above mutational changes, respectively. These structural relationships allow us to envisage evolutionary processes for the generation of the rat kininogen gene family, particularly for the disappearance of a part of the gene functions."
https://openalex.org/W1532873029,"Messenger RNA capping enzyme (GTP:mRNA guanylyltransferase) purified from yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae consisted of two polypeptides (45 and 39 kDa) and possessed two enzymatic activities, i.e. mRNA guanylyltransferase and RNA 5'-triphosphatase (Itoh, N., Mizumoto, K., and Kaziro, Y. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 13923-13929). In this paper, we describe an improved procedure suitable for the large scale purification of the enzyme. The steps include glass beads disruption of the cells and several ion-exchange and affinity column chromatographies. The enzyme was purified from kilogram quantities of yeast cells to apparent homogeneity. The purified enzyme had an approximate Mr of 180,000 and consisted of two heterosubunits of 80 and 52 kDa and had the same two enzymatic activities as above. We consider that this is the more intact form of the enzyme. Using the in situ assays on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, RNA 5'-triphosphatase, and mRNA guanylyltransferase activities were located on the 80- and 52-kDa chains, respectively. In agreement with this, the 52-kDa enzyme-[32P]GMP complex was formed on incubation of the enzyme with [alpha-32P]GTP. Guinea pig antisera against purified yeast capping enzyme recognized both 80- and 52-kDa chains in Western blot analysis. The antibody did not cross-react with the enzymes from rat liver. Artemia salina, or vaccinia virus. Nuclear localization of the enzyme was demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W1991984809,"The Hin recombinase binds to specific sites on DNA and mediates a recombination event that results in DNA inversion. In order to define the DNA-binding domain of the Hin protein two peptides 31 and 52 amino acids long were synthesized. Even though the 31mer encompassed the sequence encoding the putative helix-coil-helix-binding domain, it was not sufficient for binding to the 26-base pair DNA crossover site. However, the 52mer specifically interacted with the site and also effectively inhibited the Hin-mediated recombination reaction. The 52mer bound effectively to both the 26-base pair complete site and to a 14-base pair ""half site."" Nuclease and chemical protection studies with the 52mer helped to define the DNA base pairs that contributed to the specificity of binding. The synthetic peptide provides opportunities for new approaches to the study of the nature of protein-DNA interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2023433934,"SP6-initiated in vitro transcripts, representing the three major classes of early SV40 mRNAs, early-early (EE) and two late-early (LE) transcripts, were assayed by in vitro translation to compare their relative efficiencies for synthesis of the SV40 T antigens. The presence of one or two potential AUG initiator codons in the leader sequences of the LE RNAs inhibits efficient translation from the downstream T-antigen initiator AUG. In vitro translation of the capped form of the shorter SV40 LE RNA resulted in the synthesis of a 2.7-kd protein. In vivo pulse labeling of SV40-infected CV-1 cells demonstrated the accumulation of a peptide of similar size at late times after lytic infection, indicating that it is an authentic viral protein encoded by the early leader sequence of SV40."
https://openalex.org/W1505399167,"An in vitro cell culture system utilizing continuous human liver cells has been developed which, upon specific induction, will respond by synthesizing, de novo, the prototype acute phase reactant, C-reactive protein (CRP). Induction of CRP in vitro is not brought about by the types of hormones, steroids, and chemicals which affect other acute phase proteins. In particular, interleukin-1 thought to be directly responsible for acute phase induction is not found to be active. Direct testing of other purified biological response modifiers, i.e. alpha, beta, and gamma-interferon, interleukin-2, and tumor necrosis factor, demonstrates no inducing activity. However, we find that human peripheral blood monocytes, stimulated by endotoxin, produce a factor(s) which directly induces CRP synthesis in hepatoma cells. In addition, the human promyelocyte-like cell line HL-60 in the presence of phorbol ester and certain T-cell lines containing human retroviruses also produce this CRP-inducing factor(s). Isolation and partial purification of the CRP-inducing factor(s) indicate that it is a protein(s) with a molecular weight of approximately 30,000."
https://openalex.org/W1503440750,"The kinetoplast DNA of trypanosomes is comprised of thousands of DNA minicircles and 20-50 maxicircles catenated into a single network. Replication intermediates of minicircle DNA from the trypanosomatid species Crithidia fasciculata contain site-specific discontinuities in both heavy (H) and light (L) strands. These discontinuities map to two small regions situated 180 degrees apart on the minicircle; each region has two sites at which a discontinuity can occur, one on each strand. We have determined the position of these discontinuities on the minicircle DNA sequence and have characterized their structure. H-strand discontinuities occur within a 4-5-nucleotide sequence and consist of single nicks, only one of which appears to be a DNA-DNA junction. Characterization of the remaining H-strand nicks indicates a structure other than a typical DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA junction. Discontinuities on the L-strand can be either a nick or a short gap which overlaps a 12-nucleotide sequence universally conserved among minicircles from various trypanosome species. Up to 6 nucleotides are hydrolyzed from the 5' terminus facing the gap upon treatment with alkali, suggesting the presence of an RNA primer. Based on the structures of minicircle replication intermediates, we present a model for replication of minicircle DNA in which the site-specific discontinuities closely coincide with the origins of replication."
https://openalex.org/W1582418918,"Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency in humans is associated with a severe defect in T-lymphocyte function. The mutant gene was cloned from one PNP-deficient patient who was the offspring of a consanguineous mating. The exons and intron/exon boundaries of the mutant PNP gene were sequenced and compared with the wild-type cDNA sequence. A single base difference was found in the coding region of the mutant gene, a G to A transition in the third exon. This single base mutation alters the codon at position 89 from Glu to Lys, a result which is consistent with previously published peptide mapping data. The patient was demonstrated to be autozygous for the single base mutation on the basis of hybridization of synthetic oligomers to genomic DNA digests. A mammalian expression vector was constructed containing the entire mutant gene under the transcriptional regulation of its own promoter. In another construction, the single base mutation was reverted to the wild-type sequence by in vitro mutagenesis. An isoelectric focusing gel containing extracts of the cells transfected with the mutant and reverted PNP gene was stained histochemically for PNP activity. The proteins from a similar gel were blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoreactive human PNP protein was visualized. Cells transfected with the mutant gene contained no human PNP activity, but expressed immunoreactive PNP which focused at an abnormally alkaline pI. Cells transfected with the reverted gene expressed human PNP activity which co-focused with human PNP from a HeLa cell control, proving that the observed single base change was responsible for the loss of catalytic function."
https://openalex.org/W1607823427,"The primosome is a mobile multiprotein priming apparatus that requires seven Escherichia coli proteins for assembly (the products of the dnaB, dnaC and dnaG genes; replication factor Y (protein n'); and proteins i, n, and n''). While the primosome is analagous to the phage T7 gene 4 protein and phage T4 gene 41/61 proteins in its DNA G-catalyzed priming function, its ability to act similarly also as a DNA helicase has remained equivocal. The role of the primosome in unwinding duplex DNA strands was investigated in the coliphage phi X174 SS(c)—replicative form DNA replication reaction in vitro, which requires the E. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein, the primosomal proteins, and the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. Multigenome-length, linear, double-stranded DNA molecules were generated in this reaction, presumably via a rolling circle-type mechanism. Synthesis of these products required the presence of a helicase-catalyzed strand-displacement activity to permit multiple cycles of continuous complementary (-) strand synthesis. The participation of the primosome in this helicase activity was supported by demonstrating that other SS(c) DNA templates (G4 and alpha-3), which lack primosome assembly sites, failed to support significant linear multimer production and that replication of phi X174 with the general priming system (the DNA B and DNA G proteins and DNA polymerase III holoenzyme) resulted in a 13-fold lower rate of linear multimer synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1515540436,"Isolated rat hepatocytes, treated with metabolic energy poisons such as NaN3 in the absence of exogenous ligand, lose surface galactosyl (Gal) receptor activity (Clarke, B. L., and Weigel, P. H. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 128-133). We have used 125I-labeled asialo-orosomucoid and affinity-purified anti-receptor IgG to quantitate, respectively, the activity and the amount of Gal receptor protein. Cells were treated with NaN3 at 37 degrees C and the surface or total (surface and intracellular) binding of these two probes was measured at 4 degrees C, respectively, in intact cells or in cells permeabilized with digitonin. As a function of NaN3 concentration, both surface receptor activity and protein decreased in parallel by 50-80%. Virtually all of the lost surface receptor protein was found inside the cell, but only about 50% of all cellular Gal receptors were active. As determined by equilibrium binding studies, this decreased receptor activity reflected an overall loss of ligand binding sites with little change in binding affinity of the remaining Gal receptors for asialo-orosomucoid. When ATP was restored, normal surface receptor activity and number completely recovered even in the absence of protein synthesis. We conclude that a subpopulation of Gal receptors constitutively recycles and undergoes an inactivation/reactivation cycle. In the absence of ligand, these receptors are normally internalized and then inactivated. Loss of cellular ATP blocks receptor reactivation, prevents the reappearance of receptors at the cell surface and redistributes Gal receptors as inactive receptors accumulate intracellularly."
https://openalex.org/W1585943980,"Calmodulin purified from bacteria which express a cloned chicken calmodulin gene can be selectively conjugated with ubiquitin, using enzymes present in reticulocyte extracts. Analyses of peptide products generated from limited proteolytic digestion of the calmodulin conjugate containing a single ubiquitin indicate that lysine 115 on calmodulin is the site of linkage. This linkage site is identical to that previously reported for calmodulin purified from Dictyostelium discoideum. Substrate-dependent ATP hydrolysis by a partially purified ubiquitin conjugation enzyme system from reticulocyte extracts was used to determine the enzyme affinity to calmodulin. Km values of 7 and 9 microM were determined for dictyostelium and the bacterially expressed calmodulin, respectively. The bacterially expressed calmodulin, unlike the Dictyostelium protein, can also form conjugates containing a 2-5 molar ratio of ubiquitin but at a slower rate than that observed for conjugation at lysine 115. Results from these studies further support our hypothesis that the post-translational methylation of lysine 115 found in most forms of calmodulin serves the important function of protecting calmodulin from ubiquitination and from degradation by the cytoplasmic ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway. The capability of the bacterially expressed calmodulin to form conjugates with a high molar ratio of ubiquitin suggests that the post-translational acetylation of the N terminus of calmodulin may serve a similar function."
https://openalex.org/W2078082514,"The human T-cell leukemia viruses, HTLV-I and HTLV-II, contain a gene, termed x, with transcriptional regulatory function. The properties of the x proteins were analyzed by constructing mutant genes containing site-directed deletions and point mutations. The results demonstrate that the amino terminal 17 amino acids of the x protein constitute part of a functional domain that is critical for the transcriptional activating properties of the protein. Within this region, substitution of a leucine residue for a proline residue results in major changes in the trans-activation phenotype of the protein. The mutant HTLV-II x protein, though incapable of activating the HTLV-II long terminal repeat, will block trans-activation of the HTLV-II long terminal repeat by the wild-type protein. The altered phenotype of this mutant suggests a potential negative regulatory function of the x protein."
https://openalex.org/W1995400197,"Human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) types I and II are unusual among replication-competent retroviruses in that they contain a fourth gene (chi) necessary for replication. The chi gene product, p chi, transcriptionally transactivates the viral long repeat (LTR), and is thus a positive regulator. To investigate p chi transactivation, sequences from the U3 regions of the LTRs of HTLV-I and -II were inserted into the Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) LTR by recombinant DNA techniques. Transient expression assays of the chimeric LTRs indicated that the HTLV sequences conferred to the M-MuLV LTR responsiveness to HTLV p chi protein. M-MuLV enhancers were not required for function of the chimeric LTRs. Infectious recombinant M-MuLVs containing chimeric LTRs were also generated. These viruses showed higher infectivity when assayed in mouse cells expressing HTLV-II p chi protein compared to normal mouse cells. Thus the HTLV sequences were able to confer p chi responsiveness to infectious M-MuLV. The generation of a virus dependent on a transactivating protein for its replication has implications for the evolution of the human T-cell leukemia viruses."

Mitochondrial DNA rearrangements accompany the formation of these small plasmids indicating their derivation from a plastic region of the mitochondrial genome. A possible relationship between the direct repeat sequences, the palindromic regions, and the excision process is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1519904613,"The major Mn2+-activated phosphoprotein phosphatase of the human erythrocyte has been purified to homogeneity from the cell hemolysate. It is sensitive to both inhibitors 1 and 2 of rabbit skeletal muscle, preferentially dephosphorylates the beta subunit of the phosphorylase kinase, and dephosphorylates a broad range of substrates including phosphorylase a, p-nitro-phenyl phosphate, phosphocasein, the regulatory subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, and both spectrin (Km = 10 microM) and pyruvate kinase (Km = 18 microM) purified from the human erythrocyte. The purified enzyme is stimulated by Mn2+ and to a lesser extent by higher concentrations of Mg2+. The purification procedure was selected to avoid any change in molecular weight, hence subunit composition, between the crude and purified enzyme. Maintenance of the original structure is demonstrated by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis and gel filtration chromatography. Gel filtration of the purified holoenzyme shows a single active component with a Stokes radius of 58 A at a molecular weight position of 180,000. Sedimentation velocity in a glycerol gradient gives a value of 6.1 for S20, w. Together these data indicate a molecular weight of about 135,000. Two bands of equal intensity appear on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis at molecular weights of 61,700 and 36,300, suggesting a subunit composition of two 36,000 and one 62,000 subunits. The 36-kDa catalytic subunit can be isolated by freezing and thawing the holoenzyme or by hydrophobic chromatography of the holoenzyme. The catalytic subunit shows unchanged substrate and inhibitor specificity but altered metal ion activation."
https://openalex.org/W1594140881,"We examined by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy in far- and near-ultraviolet three different molecular forms of Escherichia coli adenylate kinase: the wild type protein, the enzyme carboxymethylated at a single cysteine residue (Cys-77), and the thermosensitive adenylate kinase. The thermosensitive enzyme differs from the wild type protein in that a serine is substituted for a proline residue at position 87 (Gilles, A.-M., Saint Girons, I., Monnot, M., Fermandjian, S., Michelson, S., and Bârzu, O. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 83, 5798-5802). We also examined the CD spectra of isolated peptides resulting from chemical cleavage of adenylate kinase at Cys-77 (C1, residues 1-76; C2, residues 77-214). The secondary structure composition of wild type bacterial adenylate kinase (50% alpha-helix and 15% beta-sheet) was close to that derived from x-ray analysis of pig muscle enzyme (Schulz, G.E., Elzinga, M., Marx, F., and Schirmer, R. H. (1974) Nature 250, 120-123). Carboxymethylation of wild type protein did not greatly affect the CD spectrum. The secondary structure of the thermosensitive adenylate kinase was observed to be significantly different from that of the wild type enzyme (reduction in alpha-helix content to 39%). Changes in ellipticities at 222 nm as a function of temperature indicated that the melting temperature for thermosensitive adenylate kinase was 38 degrees C and that for the wild type enzyme was 54 degrees C. Isolated C1 and C2 peptides had a large proportion of unordered structures. When mixed, C1 and C2 fragments reassociated into structures resembling native, uncleaved adenylate kinase. The recovery of ordered structures, indicated by CD spectroscopy, paralleled the recovery of catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1512147802,"We have examined the chromatin structure of the metallothionein (MT) gene region in MT- S49 mouse lymphoma cells and in derivatives which express MT-I alone, MT-II alone, or both genes. In all lines, these genes are contained in a 16-kilobase pair region between two DNase I sensitive sites: one site located 5.3 kilobase pairs 5' of MT-II (the 5' gene) is present in naked DNA and retained in the chromatin of all lines; the other site located 3.1 kilobase pairs 3' of MT-I is hypersensitive. Hypersensitivity at three other sites is dependent on the expression of MT genes. Two sites 5' of MT-II disappear, and a site 3' of MT-I appears regardless of which gene is activated. The fact that these sites respond when either gene is activated suggests that the regulation of the two genes is interdependent and that the region undergoes a general change in conformation with MT activation. In addition, a single site in the 5' region of MT-II becomes hypersensitive with activation of the gene and may be related directly to expression."
https://openalex.org/W1535643285,"In two recent publications we showed that rapid inactivation of cell-bound C3b is a protective mechanism of human melanoma cells against killing by the R24 monoclonal antibody and human complement (Panneerselvam, M., Welt, S., Old, L.J., and Vogel, C.-W. (1986) J. Immunol. 136, 2534-2541) and that this protective mechanism can be inhibited by both the free and immobilized anthracycline glycoside doxorubicin (adriamycin) resulting in an enhanced complement susceptibility (Panneerselvam, M., Bredehorst, R., and Vogel, C.-W. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83, 9144-9148). In this paper we show that the complement enhancing effect of both free and immobilized doxorubicin is caused by the generation of reactive oxygen species including superoxide anion radical, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical. The complement-enhancing effect of the anthracyclines can be completely inhibited by the reactive oxygen scavengers superoxide dismutase, catalase, and dimethyl sulfoxide. Consistent with this observation, 5-iminodaunorubicin, an anthracycline glycoside with an imine-substituted quinone moiety and, therefore, with a significantly reduced ability to form oxygen radicals, did not cause an enhanced-complement susceptibility. The complement-enhancing effect of the anthracycline glycosides could also be inhibited by bivalent metal chelators but was unaffected by sulfhydryl-blocking reagents or glutathione. Our results suggest that the anthracycline glycosides generate in a metal- (most probably iron) dependent reaction superoxide anion radicals with subsequent formation of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals. These reactive oxygen species then cause alterations in the melanoma cells resulting in the enhanced complement susceptibility. While the target molecule(s) of the reactive oxygen species responsible for the enhanced complement susceptibility is not known, the data obtained with immobilized doxorubicin suggest that the target molecule(s) is located in the cell membrane."

Using reactivation of phoshorylated fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase as assay, a protein phosphatase was about 2,000-fold purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Upon incubation with phosphorylated fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase the purified protein phosphatase not only reverses the 50% inactivation caused by phosphorylation, but also the previously observed change in the pH optimum and in the ratio of activity with Mg2+ or Mn2+. The phosphatase is strongly inhibited by heparin and fluoride. L-Carnitine, orthophosphate, pyrophosphate, and succinate inhibit to 50% at concentrations from 1 to 10 mM. The molecular mass of the native phosphatase was found to be 180,000 Da. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis suggested four subunits with a molecular mass of 45,000 Da each. Half-maximal activity was observed with 5 mM Mg2+ or Mn2+, the pH optimum of activity was found at pH 7. Using polyclonal antibodies, disappearance of 32P-labeled fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and concomitant liberation of the expected amount of inorganic [32P] phosphate was demonstrated."

(1986) Mol. Cell. Biol. 6, 2957-2962). In order to determine whether this nucleobase transport system was bidirectional, mutant cell lines possessing this high affinity base transport capability were derived from a nucleoside transport-deficient derivative of an adenylosuccinate synthetase-deficient S49 cell line. The resulting progeny excreted significantly greater amounts of purine into the cell culture medium than parental cells. This purine was identified as hypoxanthine. These results demonstrate genetically that the high affinity purine base transport system can mediate both the influx and efflux of hypoxanthine."
