https://openalex.org/W2128840474,"Genomic DNA encompassing the terminal exons of the gene for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor was isolated from J. D., a patient with familial hypercholesterolemia whose receptor fails to cluster in coated pits. The DNA sequence revealed a substitution of a cysteine codon for a tyrosine codon at residue 807 in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. We reproduced this substitution through oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the normal human receptor cDNA. Upon transfection into receptor-deficient hamster cells, the cDNA specified a receptor that bound LDL normally, but entered the cell slowly. Electron microscopy showed that this receptor was distributed diffusely over the cell surface, whereas the receptor produced by the normal cDNA was concentrated in coated pits. These results support the hypothesis that cytoplasmic domains direct receptors to coated pits, thereby determining the high rate of receptor internalization in animal cells."

We found that fully reconstituted templates supported no specific initiation by RNA polymerase II; however, DNA exposed to the reconstitution extracts under conditions which did not allow nucleosome deposition was transcribed normally. A set of successively less reconstituted templates was also transcribed. No initiation occurred on reconstitutes with more than two-thirds of the physiological nucleosome density; reconstitutes with less than one-third of the physiological nucleosome density were transcribed as efficiently as naked DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1486105253,"Skin secretions from the South African frog Xenopus laevis have been chromatographed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), fractionated, and analyzed by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS). The HPLC chromatograms showed the secretion to be a complex mixture with over 30 components at similar levels to the four peptides previously isolated from X. laevis skin, i.e. xenopsin, caerulein, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and PGLa. FAB-MS analysis of the HPLC fractions gave numerous protonated molecular ions ranging from m/z 491 to 2662. Preliminary assignments of these components were made by comparing these experimental molecular weights to those predicted for regions within the xenopsin, caerulein, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and PGLa precursors. These results suggested that many of these skin secretions were peptides originating from additional processing of the xenopsin, caerulein, and PGLa precursors, primarily involving cleavage at single arginine residues, and a novel cleavage at the NH2-terminal side of single lysines. These assignments were subsequently confirmed by Edman degradation, FAB-MS peptide sequencing, and amino acid analysis. All of these peptides contain one or more lysines and would be expected to have amphiphilic structures. As yet, nothing is known about their activity, although they resemble in composition the mast cell degranulating peptides melittin and the bombolitins. These precursor fragments were also found to have limited sequence homology to bombinin, a hemolytic amphibian peptide isolated from the European Bombina toad."

https://openalex.org/W1522769801,"Since phospholipids are major components of all serum lipoproteins, the role of phospholipid biosynthesis in lipoprotein secretion from cultured rat hepatocytes has been investigated. In liver, phosphatidylcholine is made both by the CDP-choline pathway and by the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine, which in turn is derived from both serine (via phosphatidylserine) and ethanolamine (via CDP-ethanolamine). Monolayer cultures of rat hepatocytes were incubated in the presence of [methyl-3H]choline, [1-3H] ethanolamine, or [3-3H]serine. The specific radioactivity of the phospholipids derived from each of these precursors was measured in the cells and in the secreted lipoproteins of the cultured medium. The specific radioactivities of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine derived from [1-3H]ethanolamine were markedly lower (approximately one-half and less than one-tenth, respectively) in the secreted phospholipids than in the cellular phospholipids. Thus, ethanolamine was not an effective precursor of the phospholipids in lipoproteins. On the contrary, the specific radioactivity of phosphatidylcholine made from [methyl-3H]choline was approximately equal in cells and lipoproteins. In addition, over the first 4 h of incubation with [3-3H]serine, the specific radioactivities of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were significantly higher in the lipoproteins than in the cells. These data indicate that there is not a random and homogeneous labeling of the phospholipid pools from the radioactive precursors. Instead, specific pools of phospholipids are selected, on the basis of their routes of biosynthesis, for secretion into lipoproteins."

https://openalex.org/W1594391093,"The effect of dexamethasone on the synthesis of total cellular and extracellular proteins and specifically on the synthesis of type I procollagen chains, fibronectin, and a 50-kDa extracellular noncollagenous polypeptide was examined in cultured rat dermal fibroblasts. A slight but consistent inhibition of total protein synthesis by dexamethasone was dose and time dependent. Treatment of cells with 1 microM dexamethasone for 24 h while abolishing procollagen synthesis nearly completely (less than 95%) had the opposite effect (5-7-fold increase) on the synthesis of an extracellular noncollagenous 50-kDa polypeptide. Dexamethasone did not significantly affect the rates of synthesis of fibronectin. Cell-free translation of mRNA from dexamethasone-treated cells revealed corresponding changes in the steady-state levels of functional mRNAs coding for procollagens, the 50-kDa polypeptide, and fibronectin. Northern blot hybridization using nick-translated cDNA plasmids coding for pro-alpha 1(I), fibronectin, and cytoplasmic beta-actin mRNA corroborated the data obtained from cell-free translation experiments. Run-off transcription assays using nuclei from cells treated with 1 microM dexamethasone for 24 h revealed that glucocorticoid treatment did not significantly affect the rate of transcription of type I collagen genes; similarly, the rate of transcription of fibronectin and cytoplasmic beta-actin genes also remained unchanged under these conditions. An analysis of the kinetics of decay of radiolabeled mRNA coding for pro-alpha 1(I), pro-alpha 2(I), and fibronectin in dexamethasone-treated cells revealed that procollagen mRNAs were turned over at an accelerated rate in glucocorticoid-treated cells. These data suggest that dexamethasone regulates type I collagen gene expression by preferentially decreasing the stability of pro-alpha 1(I) and pro-alpha2(I) mRNAs. Although dexamethasone increased the levels of translatable mRNAs coding for a 50-kDa polypeptide, the molecular mechanism(s) of how hormone exerts this effect remains unknown."

https://openalex.org/W1819281803,"A fatty acid-binding protein has been isolated from rat heart and purified by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G-75 and anion-exchange chromatography on DE52. The circular dichroic spectrum of this protein was not affected by protein concentration, suggesting that it does not aggregate into multimers. Computer analyses of the circular dichroic spectrum predicted that rat heart fatty acid-binding protein contains approximately 22% alpha-helix, 45% beta-form and 33% unordered structure. Immunological studies showed that the fatty acid-binding proteins from rat heart and rat liver are immunochemically unrelated. The amino acid composition and partial amino acid sequence of the heart protein indicated that it is structurally related to, but distinct from, other fatty acid-binding proteins from liver, intestine, and 3T3 adipocytes. Using a binding assay which measures the transfer of fatty acids between donor liposomes and protein (Brecher, P., Saouaf, R., Sugarman, J. M., Eisenberg, D., and LaRosa, K. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 13395-13401), it was shown that both rat heart and liver fatty acid-binding proteins bind 2 mol of oleic acid or palmitic acid/mol of protein. The structural and functional relationship of rat heart fatty acid-binding protein to fatty acid-binding proteins from other tissues is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1643253926,"We have purified the human erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.2 to greater than 85% homogeneity. The protein was extracted from spectrin-actin-depleted inside-out vesicles in a pH 11 medium and purified by gel filtration in the presence of 1 M KI. The purified protein was heterogeneous and had an average S20,w of 5.5 and an average Stokes radius of 82 A. By electron microscopy, the protein appeared heterogeneous in size and shape, having a diameter ranging from 80 to 150 A. The protein bound saturably to band 4.2-depleted red cell inside-out vesicles, and the binding exhibited a concave Scatchard plot. Binding was reduced greater than 90% by proteolytic digestion of membranes. Digestion studies suggested that there are two classes of binding sites for band 4.2 on the cytoplasmic aspect of red cell membranes, one of which is likely to be band 3. The purified 43-kDa cytoplasmic domain of band 3 competed for band 4.2 binding to red cell membranes and could completely abolish binding when added at a concentration of greater than 200 micrograms/ml. The purification of band 4.2 and the characterization of its association with red cell membranes should facilitate the discovery of the function of this major red cell membrane protein."
https://openalex.org/W1530321233,"This paper describes a protocol for the preparation of highly purified A (A1 and A2) and B chains of the plant toxin, ricin, and biochemical and biological characterization of these proteins. Intact ricin was bound to acid-treated Sepharose 4B and was split on the column into A and B chains with 2-mercaptoethanol. The A chains were eluted with borate buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol. A1 and A2 were then partially separated by cation exchange chromatography and the contaminating B chain was removed by affinity chromatography on Sepharose-asialofetuin and Sepharose-monoclonal anti-B chain. The B chain was eluted from the Sepharose 4B column by treatment with galactose and was further purified by cation and anion exchange chromatography; contaminating A chains were removed by affinity chromatography on Sepharose-monoclonal anti-A chain. The purified A and B chains were active as determined by their ability to inhibit protein synthesis in a cell-free assay and their binding to asialofetuin, respectively. Furthermore, by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, toxicity in mice, and toxicity on several different cell types, both A and B chains were shown to be minimally cross-contaminated. Finally, it was shown that ammonium chloride significantly enhanced the nonspecific toxicity of B chains for cells in vitro. In contrast, ammonium chloride did not enhance either the nonspecific toxicity of A chains in vitro or the specific toxicity of A chain-containing immunotoxins prepared with the highly purified A1, A2 chains."
https://openalex.org/W1488999743,"Oxidants can alter erythrocyte membrane properties and cause ultimate hemolysis, but the mechanisms responsible for these changes are not understood. A protein skeleton preserves the normal integrity of the erythrocyte membrane. In this study, we investigated the effects of limited chemical oxidation on the structure and function of the major skeletal protein, spectrin. After mild treatment of spectrin with 2.5 microM diamide, with formation of an average of only one disulfide bond, we observed a 50% reduction in the ability of protein 4.1 to amplify spectrin-actin binding. The oxidized spectrin specifically lacked the ability to bind protein 4.1, whereas all other spectrin functions remained intact. However, oxidation also produced a structural change in spectrin. A rapidly migrating species appeared on non-denaturing gels in a dose-dependent manner with increasing diamide concentrations. By electron microscopy, the oxidized spectrin appeared as single-stranded signet rings with irregular knob-like protrusions. Fifty per cent of spectrin was converted to the ring form after the formation of an average of two disulfide bonds. Both the structural and functional defects were reversed by chemical reduction. The loss of spectrin function or the structural transformation in spectrin may contribute to erythrocyte membrane failure in the oxidative environment."
https://openalex.org/W1519346233,"A new fucoganglioside, disialosyl Lea, has been found in the disialoganglioside fraction of human colonic adenocarcinoma. The ganglioside has been isolated from four other disialogangliosides by high-performance liquid chromatography followed by preparative high-performance thin-layer chromatography. The structure of the antigen was characterized by its conversion to lactofucopentaosyl(II)ceramide (Lea-active ceramide pentasaccharide), methylation analysis, and high-mass range electron-impact as well as field-desorption mass spectrometry of the permethylated derivative, as shown below: (Formula; see text) Specific removal of alpha 2----3-linked sialosyl residue by influenza virus A2 sialidase, or preferential hydrolysis of the same residue by Clostridium perfringens sialidase in the absence of detergent, resulted in the formation of an intermediate product, monosialosyl LeaII (III4FucIII6NeuAcLc4), which reacted with anti-Lea antibody and with monoclonal antibody FH7 and may have a sialic acid linked at the 6 position of GlcNAc. The IgG3 monoclonal antibody FH7 was established, which reacts specifically with disialosyl Lea and monosialosyl LeaII as above, but does not react with disialosyllactotetraosylceramide (IV3NeuAcIII6Neu-AcLc4), monosialosyl LeaI (IV3NeuAcIII4FucLc4), and other mono- and disialogangliosides isolated from the same cancer tissue. The antibody FH7 may be useful in the detection of human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1499909373,"Cholesterol esters accumulating in human plasma high density lipoproteins (HDL) are important in conversion of HDL3 to larger HDL2. We studied whether mechanisms of removal of cholesterol esters from HDL might be important in a reverse direction, i.e. conversion of HDL2 to HDL3. Native HDL2 or HDL3 is incubated with very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and lipoprotein-poor plasma (d greater than 1.21 g/ml) at 37 degrees C. After incubation, (M) VLDL, and HDL2 or HDL3 are reisolated by ultracentrifugation. In modified M-HDL2 or M-HDL3, triglyceride becomes the major core lipid as the triglyceride/cholesterol ester weight ratio increases 8-10-fold relative to native HDL. With only small changes in protein/phospholipid ratios in M-HDLs, the large decrease in cholesterol ester/protein ratios suggest net cholesterol ester loss from HDL. Quantitative recovery analyses prove that the cholesterol esters lost from HDL are transferred to M-VLDL, which is now richer in cholesterol ester and poorer in triglyceride. These substantial exchanges of HDL lipids are not associated by significant transfer of HDL apoproteins but are dependent on neutral lipid transfer factors present in human lipoprotein-poor plasma (d greater than 1.21 g/ml). Similar results are obtained when purified core lipid transfer protein replaces d greater than 1.21 g/ml plasma in these incubations. After depletion of cholesterol ester from HDL, most but not all, exchanged triglyceride can be removed by lipolysis with either hepatic or lipoprotein lipase, resulting in a post-lipolysis HDL2 with an increased triglyceride content relative to normal HDL. With successive incubations with VLDL, and core lipid transfer factors, HDL2 loses more than two-thirds of its cholesterol esters. After lipolysis of acquired triglyceride, HDL2 is remodeled, in both composition and flotation parameters, toward HDL3."
https://openalex.org/W1505515420,"Bromoperoxidase was purified from the crude extract of Corallina pilulifera to be homogeneous upon polyacrylamide disc gel and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses according to the procedures previously reported (Itoh, N., Izumi, Y., and Yamada, H. (1985) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 131, 428-435). The enzyme had a molecular weight of approximately 790,000 and was composed of 12 subunits of identical molecular weights (Mr 64,000). Hexagonal molecular shapes of the enzyme were observed by electron microscopy. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was 3.0, and the predominance of acidic amino acids was revealed by amino acid analysis of the enzyme. The enzyme was specific for I- and Br- and inactive toward Cl- and F-. The optimum pH of the enzyme was 6.0, and the enzyme was stable in a range from pH 5.0 to 11.0. The enzyme had no hemeor flavin-like compounds as a prosthetic group. Plasma emission spectroscopy revealed that the enzyme contains 2.3 +/- 0.2 atoms of iron and 1.6 +/- 0.1 atoms of magnesium/molecule of protein. Hence, bromoperoxidase of C. pilulifera was distinct from other haloperoxidases and many peroxidases, which are hemoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1549306050,"The phosphorylation characteristics of insulin receptor from control and insulin-treated rat H-35 hepatoma cells 32P-labeled to equilibrium have been documented. The 32P-labeled insulin receptor is isolated by immunoprecipitation with patient-derived insulin receptor antibodies in the presence of phosphatase and protease inhibitors to preserve the native phosphorylation and structural characteristics of the receptor. The unstimulated insulin receptor contains predominantly [32P] phosphoserine and trace amounts of [32P]phosphothreonine in its beta subunit. In response to insulin, the insulin receptor beta subunit exhibits marked tyrosine phosphorylation and a 2-fold increase in total [32P]phosphoserine contents. High pressure liquid chromatography of the tryptic hydrolysates of the 32P-labeled receptor beta subunit from quiescent cells results in the resolution of up to 9 fractions containing [32P]phosphoserine. The insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation is concentrated in two of these receptor phosphopeptide fractions, whereas the increase in [32P]phosphoserine content is scattered in low abundance over all receptor tryptic fractions. Insulin receptors affinity-purified by lectin- and insulin-agarose chromatographies from insulin-treated, 32P-labeled cells exhibit a 22-fold increase in the Vmax of receptor tyrosine kinase activity toward histone when compared to controls. The elevated kinase activity of the insulin receptor derived from insulin-treated cells is not due to the presence of hormone bound to the receptor because the receptor kinase activity is assayed while immobilized on insulin-agarose. Furthermore, the insulin-activated receptor kinase activity is reversed following dephosphorylation of the receptor beta subunit with alkaline phosphatase in vitro. The correlation between the insulin-stimulated site specific tyrosine phosphorylation on receptor beta subunit and the elevation of receptor tyrosine kinase activity strongly suggests that the insulin receptor kinase is activated by hormone-stimulated autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues in intact cells, as previously demonstrated for the purified receptor."

On ganglioside mapping, at least seven gangliosides were detected, and the structures of the five major molecules were determined by degradation with exoglycosidases and methylation analysis. GM3, GD3, and GT3 were found to comprise 80% of the total gangliosides. The other two gangliosides had a new core structure with a branched oligosaccharide chain. One was a novel monosialoganglioside with a 2----6 linked sialic acid residue with the following structure: (Formula, see text) There were 41 nmol of this ganglioside/g of buttermilk (4.5% of total gangliosides).

https://openalex.org/W2155630701,"We have investigated the effect of surface charge on the rate of assembly of alpha beta dimers of human hemoglobin A: alpha + beta k a----alpha beta. Heme intact beta A subunits were compared with four mutant subunits which differ by integral units of charge: beta N(Lys-95----Glu) (2-); beta J(Gly-16----Asp) (1-); beta S(Glu-6----Val) (1+); beta C(Glu-6----Lys) (2+). Subunit competition experiments were performed as follows. Varying amounts of 3H-labeled alpha A subunits were added to a mixture containing equal amounts of beta A and beta X subunits so that alpha/(beta A + beta X) ranged from 0.05-1.0. The reconstituted 3H-labeled Hbs A and X were analyzed by ion-exchange high pressure liquid chromatography as well as by gel electrofocusing and fluorography. Under the solvent conditions employed (10 mM PO4(Na), pH 7.0, 0 degrees C) a predominant proportion of the beta subunits was monomeric. Therefore, the ratio of Hb X to Hb A formed from subunit reconstitution when alpha/(beta X + beta A) approached zero provides a direct measure of the relative rates of monomer combination: kXa/kAa. The experimental values of this ratio decreased monotonically with the overall charge of the variant beta subunit: beta N = 2.6; beta J = 1.5; beta S = 0.41; beta C = 0.13. In contrast surface charge had no significant effect on the rate of dissociation of the alpha beta dimer: alpha beta kd----alpha + beta. At pH 8.0, where the alpha chains lack a net surface charge, they combined equally well to beta A and beta C chains. These experiments are consistent with a two-step mechanism, alpha + beta in equilibrium (alpha...beta) in equilibrium alpha beta, where the oppositely charged monomers diffuse together under the influence of their mutual electrostatic interaction to form a nonspecifically bound encounter complex [alpha...beta] that undergoes a surface charge-independent rearrangement to form the stable dimer."
https://openalex.org/W1559233894,"Polysialoglycoprotein, a novel type of glycoprotein found in the eggs of rainbow trout has been shown to undergo dramatic depolymerization (200- to 9-kDa) upon fertilization of the eggs. Molecular mechanism of this depolymerization has been elucidated to be the result of proteolysis catalyzed by a highly specific protease induced at fertilization. The low molecular weight polysialoglycoprotein obtained from the fertilized eggs accounted for about 85% of total polysialoglycoprotein and comprised glycotridecapeptides with a uniform peptide sequence which was determined to be Asp-Asp-Ala-Thr*-Ser*-Glu-Ala-Ala-Thr*-Gly-Pro-Ser-Gly, where * indicates the site of glycosylation. This glycotridecapeptide constitutes a repeating unit of the 200-kDa polysialoglycoprotein in the unfertilized eggs: (Asp) 0-2-Ala-Thr*-Ser*-Glu-Ala-Ala-Thr*-Gly-Pro-Ser-Gly-(Asp-Asp-Ala-Thr*-Ser *-Glu- Ala-Ala-Thr*-Gly-Pro-Ser-Gly)n (n = 25) (Kitajima, K., Inoue, Y., and Inoue, S. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 5262-5269). The fertilization-induced depolymerization of polysialoglycoprotein appeared to be completed within 5 min postfertilization. The same reaction was also induced by parthenogenetic activation of the eggs by immersing in fresh water or nonelectrolyte solutions. Thus the phenomenon is closely associated with the exocytosis of cortical vesicles (alveoli) of the eggs."

This fraction made up 0.28 +/- 0.09 of total VLDL triglyceride. Interconversion of the two isolated VLDL fractions was not detected during incubation (2 h, 37 degrees C) and they may represent the physical forms of apo-B corresponding to distinct metabolic pathways in plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1491860216,"Stimulation of the D-2 dopamine receptor inhibits pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) synthesis in isolated rat intermediate lobe tissue. Intermediate lobe tissue was incubated in the absence or presence of various dopaminergic compounds, and then its capacity to incorporate [3H]tyrosine into POMC was tested. D-2 dopaminergic agonists caused a dose-dependent inhibition of POMC synthesis; the maximal inhibitory effect was approximately a 50% reduction in the amount of POMC synthesized. D-2 dopaminergic antagonists blocked the inhibitory effect of each agonist. Pretreatment of the tissue with pertussis toxin abolished the D-2 dopaminergic inhibition of POMC synthesis. The potency of pertussis toxin in abolishing the dopaminergic inhibition of POMC synthesis corresponded to its potency in abolishing the D-2 dopaminergic inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. Cholera toxin, forskolin, and 8-bromo-cAMP, compounds that activate the cAMP pathway, enhanced the capacity of intermediate lobe tissue to synthesize POMC and counteracted the dopaminergic inhibition of POMC synthesis. Incubation of intermediate lobe tissue for 24 h with bromocriptine, a D-2 dopaminergic agonist, decreased the POMC mRNA content by 46% as determined by hybridization of RNA to a 32P-labeled probe. Incubation of intermediate lobe tissue with forskolin increased the level of POMC mRNA; incubation of the tissue with a combination of bromocriptine and forskolin also resulted in an increase in the level of POMC mRNA. It is proposed that Ni, the inhibitory guanyl nucleotide binding protein, and possibly adenylate cyclase mediate the dopaminergic inhibition of POMC synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1889952315,"Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods have been applied to a study of the structure and metabolism of the triacylglycerols from rat epididymal fat pad adipocytes. Complete NMR signal assignments are provided for adipocytes, the extracted triacylglycerols, and methyl esters of the derived fatty acids. 13C NMR yielded rapid, nondestructive, quantitative analysis of the amounts of unsaturation of the fatty acyl chains; in cells from rats given ad libitum access to a standard laboratory diet the predominant fatty acids were found to be palmitate (29.9%), oleate (27.9%), and linoleate (34.1%). These results agreed with gas chromatographic separation of the derived methyl esters of the extracted lipids. Lipid dynamics were examined in situ and showed a substantial restriction of motion of glyceride-glycerol as compared with free glycerol; the nuclear magnetic spin-lattice relaxation times for free glycerol of 2.52 +/- 0.12 (C1,3) and 4.37 +/- 0.21 (C2) s decreased to 0.15 +/- 0.009 and 0.21 +/- 0.013 s, respectively, upon esterification. Segmental motion of the chains, monitored by relaxation time measurements, increased progressively from the alpha-carbon (nT1 = 0.70 s) to the methyl ends of the chains (nT1 = 9.63). The incorporation of C-13-labeled substrates ([1-13C]glucose and [3-13C]lactate) into the glycerol moiety of triacylglycerols was monitored in real time, in the presence of insulin. Lactate (10 mM) inhibited the incorporation of glucose (5.5 mM) into glyceride-glycerol. Lipolysis at the natural abundance level of 13C was measured in the presence of 10 microM isoproterenol. Simultaneous lipogenesis and lipolysis were found to occur in situ and were measured with the aid of [1-13C]glucose and isoproterenol; the labeling pattern of medium glycerol versus extracted triacylglycerols was significantly different from that found using natural abundance glucose. Our results indicate that 13C NMR is a useful new method for the real-time monitoring of lipid structure and metabolism in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1600370018,"In order to study branched chain alpha-keto acid oxidative decarboxylation in skeletal muscle mitochondria, an improved procedure was developed for isolating muscle mitochondria. The procedure uses the protease Nagase in mannitol sucrose media (Procedure A). These mitochondria exhibited high rates of oxygen consumption, good respiratory control ratios, and improved rates of branched chain alpha-keto acid oxidation. At 20 microM [1-14C]alpha-ketoisovalerate (KIV), rates were 1.99 +/- 0.09 nmol/mg of mitochondrial protein/min versus 0.85 +/- 0.02 in mitochondria prepared in electrolyte media without Nagase treatment (Procedure B). The apparent kinetic constants for KIV and alpha-ketoisocaproate (KIC) oxidation were determined. In the presence of ATP, the Vmax and K0.5 for KIV were 17.7 +/- 2.5 nmol/mg of mitochondrial protein/min and 82 microM, respectively. The K0.5 for KIV was at least 2-fold higher than for KIC as were apparent Vmax values. Branched chain alpha-keto acid oxidative decarboxylation in skeletal muscle mitochondria was compared to the activity in mitochondria isolated from liver, heart, and kidney. Rates of KIV and KIC oxidative decarboxylation were highest in heart mitochondria and quite similar in skeletal muscle, liver, and kidney mitochondria. It is the low mitochondrial content of mixed skeletal muscle, not the specific activity of the branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase, that limits muscle oxidative capacity. The data also indicate that the total activity in muscle has been routinely underestimated. Addition of ATP which increased the matrix pH (increases delta pH) stimulated the rate of oxidative decarboxylation of branched chain alpha-keto acids. On the other hand, addition of uncoupler which decreased the delta pH inhibited the rate of oxidation. Nigericin in low K+ medium inhibited oxidation to about the same degree as uncoupler, while addition of valinomycin in high K+ medium, which will decrease the electrical potential, had little effect on oxidation rates. Transport of branched chain alpha-keto acids should be sensitive to the mitochondrial pH gradient. Hence, the effects of ATP and the mitochondrial inhibitors on rates of branched chain alpha-keto acid oxidation suggest that mitochondrial transport may be partially rate-controlling for oxidation at physiological concentrations of the branched chain alpha-keto acids."
https://openalex.org/W1525436853,"We have investigated the biochemical actions of Neplanocin A (Nepl A), a carbocyclic adenosine analog, on purified calf liver S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and in the GH4C1 strain of functional rat pituitary cells. Addition of 1 mol of Nepl A/2 mol of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase subunit led to rapid and complete inactivation. Concomitant with inactivation, half of the enzyme-bound NAD was reduced and adenine was released stoichiometrically from Nepl A. In GH4C1 cells Nepl A caused a dose-dependent rapid (within 5 min) and irreversible inactivation of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and concomitant increase in intracellular S-adenosylhomocysteine. In cells treated with Nepl A for 4-5 days, methylation of DNA cytosine was depressed approximately 50%, and the level of cytoplasmic prolactin mRNA was elevated 2-fold. While acute (30 min) release of prolactin from intracellular stores was unaffected, Nepl A acted in a dose- and time-dependent manner to increase the production of both prolactin and growth hormone, the two hormones synthesized and secreted by GH4C1 cells. The lowest effective dose was 0.12 microM, the concentration required to decrease S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase activity by 50%. By 4-7 days the production of both hormones in Nepl A-treated cells was increased 2-3 times above control. The action on hormone production persisted for at least 7 days after removal of Nepl A from the culture medium. We conclude that Nepl A inhibits S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, raises cellular S-adenosylhomocysteine, decreases bulk DNA methylation, and increases hormone synthesis in GH4C1 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2108662734,"The effects of human fibrinogen and Cl- on the activation of native human plasminogen by streptokinase, at 37 degrees C, in isotonic buffers, consisting of 10 mM Hepes-NaOH, 150 mM NaOAc-NaCl, pH 7.4, have been examined. We find that Cl- acts as a mixed-type inhibitor of plasminogen activation, with a Ki in the range of 6.4-9.2 mM, in the absence and presence (1.0 microM) of fibrinogen. Fibrinogen displays an effect on plasminogen activation kinetics consistent with its function as a mixed-type nonessential activator, with Ka values between 110 and 240 nM, in the absence and presence (50 mM) of Cl-. These observations suggest opposing roles for fibrinogen and Cl- in regulating plasminogen activation."

The purity of the glycolipid was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography, analysis of its composition, and proton magnetic resonance spectrometry. The component carbohydrates were glucose, galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, and 3-O-methylgalactose. Most (90%) of the fatty acid was palmitic acid and the major sphingosine bases were octadeca-4-sphingenine (51%) and anteisononadeca-4-sphingenine (38%). 2-Aminoethylphosphonyl-6-galactose was identified after its partial hydrolysis. From studies by methanolysis, permethylation, mild acid hydrolysis, hydrogen fluoride treatment, chromium trioxide oxidation combined with thin-layer chromatography, gas liquid chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and proton magnetic resonance spectrometry, the structure of the glycolipid was concluded to be 3-OMeGal beta 1----3GalNAc alpha 1----3[6'-O-(2-aminoethylphosphonyl)-Gal alpha 1----2](2-aminoethylphosphonyl----6)Gal beta 1----4Glc beta 1----1Cer."
https://openalex.org/W1495618944,"Metabolism of (+)-, (-)-, and (+/-)-trans-3,4-dihydroxy-3, 4-dihydrobenzo[c]phenanthrenes by liver microsomes from rats and mice and by a purified monooxygenase system reconstituted with cytochrome P-450c has been examined. Bay-region 3,4-diol 1,2-epoxides are minor metabolites of both enantiomers of the 3,4-dihydrodiol with liver microsomes from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats or with the reconstituted system (less than 10% of total metabolites). Microsomes from control and phenobarbital-treated rats and from control mice form higher percentages of these diol epoxides (13-36% of total metabolites). Microsomes from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats and cytochrome P-450c in the reconstituted system form exclusively the diol expoxide-1 diastereomer, in which the benzylic hydroxyl group and oxirane oxygen are cis to each other, from the (+)-(3S,4S)-dihydrodiol. The same enzymes selectively form the diol expoxide-2 diastereomer, with its oxirane oxygen and benzylic hydroxyl groups trans to each other, from the (-)-(3R,4R)-dihydrodiol (77% of the total diol epoxides). Liver microsomes from control rats show similar stereoselectivity whereas liver microsomes from phenobarbital-treated rats and from control mice are less stereoselective. Three bis-dihydrodiols and three phenolic dihydrodiols are also formed from the enantiomeric 3,4-dihydrodiols of benzo[c]phenanthrene. A single diastereomer of one of these bis-dihydrodiols with the newly introduced dihydrodiol group at the 7,8-position accounts for 79-88% of the total metabolites of the (-)-(3R,4R)-dihydrodiol formed by liver microsomes from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats or by the reconstituted system containing epoxide hydrolase. In contrast, the (+)-(3S,4S)-dihydrodiol is metabolized to two diastereomers of this bis-dihydrodiol, a third bis-dihydrodiol, and two phenolic dihydrodiols."
https://openalex.org/W2103414438,"Abstract A monoclonal antibody (8G11-C6) that is directed to a region near the ligand-binding site of the glucocorticoid receptor was obtained by an auto-anti-idiotypic route, using a derivative of triamcinolone coupled to thyroglobulin to immunize a mouse. The resulting hybridomas were screened for anti-idiotypic antibody (anti-antisteroid) with Fab fragments of affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-triamcinolone antibody. The anti-idiotypes were then screened for binding to rat cytosol glucocorticoid receptor by a depletion procedure, yielding a clone, 8G11-C6, whose specificity for receptor was verified by sucrose density and Western blot analyses. Depletion was not significantly reduced by prelabeling the cytosol with [3H]triamcinolone acetonide. The anti-idiotype (8G11-C6) bound to Fab fragments of antisteroid and to partially purified receptor in a concentration-dependent manner. Both binding reactions were inhibited only by rabbit serum albumin conjugates of steroids known to bind to the glucocorticoid receptors. Triamcinolone derivatives of lysine and of oligopeptides containing up to six amino acids inhibited the binding of the anti-idiotype to the Fab fragments but not to the receptor, implying that the target epitope of the antisteroid antibody may be closer to its glucocorticoid-binding site than the cross-reacting epitope of the receptor. Our findings demonstrate further the versatility of the auto-anti-idiotypic route for the preparation of anti-receptor antibodies."

https://openalex.org/W1604898554,"The dimeric enzyme glutathione S-transferase B is composed of two dissimilar subunits, referred to as Ya and Yc. Transferase YaYc and the YaYa homodimer were purified from rat liver cytosol. An enol ester derivative of bilirubin (bilirubin-Woodward's reagent K) was prepared and used to label covalently the nonsubstrate ligand-binding site on these two proteins. There was a linear relationship between the amount of bilirubin-Woodward's reagent K added to the reaction mixture and the amount of labeling achieved up to a ratio of 2:1 (bilirubin-Woodward's reagent K: protein-YaYc). A maximum of 0.87 mol of label bound per mol of transferase YaYc. At higher molar ratios, the label appeared to also be binding at a second site on the enzyme. The label blocked the nonsubstrate ligand-binding site of the two transferases but not the catalytic site. The divalent reagent was shown to label equally the Ya and Yc subunits of transferase YaYc, suggesting that the single high affinity bilirubin-binding site present on this protein is formed by an interaction between the subunits rather than residing on a specific subunit. At low ratios of label to protein, bilirubin-Woodward's reagent K appears to label specifically the nonsubstrate ligand-binding site of two forms of glutathione S-transferase, and use of this label should allow for the localization of the nonsubstrate ligand-binding site in the primary amino acid sequence of the Ya and Yc subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1551146573,"N-Formylnorleucylleucylphenylalanine (f-Nle-LeuPhe) bound to rabbit peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes at 4 degrees C exists in at least two compartments that can be differentiated by their off rates. The off rate of one compartment is similar to that of the receptor characterized previously, about 0.4 min-1 (Aswanikumar, S., Corcoran, B., Schiffmann, E., Day, A. R., Freer, R. J., Showell, H. J., Becker, E. L., and Pert, C. B. (1977) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 74, 810-817; Sullivan, S. J., and Zigmond, S. H. (1980) J. Cell Biol. 85, 703-711); the off rate of the second compartment is about 0.005 min-1. Lysis of the cells at 4 degrees C with 1% Triton does not affect the peptide release from either compartment. Accumulation of peptide at 4 degrees C into the fast off-rate compartment is rapid, reaching a plateau in about 5 min, while peptide in the slow off-rate compartment continues to increase for up to 4 h. The rate of accumulation in the slow off-rate compartment is approximately proportional to the amount of peptide bound to the fast off-rate compartment. Cells lysed at 4 degrees C before binding are still able to accumulate peptide into both compartments. Three possible models to explain the data are presented."
https://openalex.org/W1584951653,"Chemoattractant receptors on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) stimulate a series of important biological responses. In an attempt to better understand the mechanism of stimulus response coupling of chemoattractant receptors, the kinetics of N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-[3H]phenylalanine (fMet-Leu-[3H]Phe) binding to PMNs was evaluated. Unexpectedly, extensive degradation of the ligand was found to occur rapidly at 37 degrees C. Exposure of 10(7) cells/ml to 10 nM fMet-Leu-[3H]Phe led to the specific uptake of approximately 1% of the ligand within 10 min, while approximately 50% of the extracellular chemoattractant was hydrolyzed to free amino acids. Under the same conditions, isolated plasma membranes equivalent to 2.5 X 10(7) PMNs/ml bound specifically approximately 1% of the ligand and degraded about one-half of it primarily to Leu-[3H]Phe. The fMet-Leu-[3H]Phe hydrolysis commenced with no apparent latency, yet disobeyed first order kinetics as a 100-fold excess unlabeled ligand enhanced the initial consumption rate of 10 nM fMet-Leu-[3H]Phe by 500-fold, yielding an enhancement of the relative hydrolysis to approximately 70%. 1-butanol at 0.25%, which accelerates chemotaxis but inhibits superoxide anion and lysosomal enzyme secretion, reduced the hydrolysis to about 15% independent of the fMet-Leu-[3H]Phe specific activity. Lysosomal secretion could not mediate the hydrolysis process, since the supernatants of PMNs exposed either to 10 nM of 1 microM fMet-Leu-Phe reveal no degradation capacity toward fMet-Leu-[3H]Phe. These data indicate that the hydrolysis of the chemoattractant occurs at the cell surface and is dependent on the plasma membrane physical state. This phenomenon may well modulate the chemotactic signal due to its ability to profoundly alter the level of the chemoattractant proximate to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1508251440,"The collagenous components of Ascaris suum intestinal basement membrane were isolated by extraction with 0.1 M Tris-HC1, 0.5 M NaC1, 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.3, and Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration. Rotary-shadowing electron microscopy showed that the collagenous components occur as monomers and dimers with mean contour lengths of 469 +/- 21 and 918 +/- 24 nm, respectively. The molecules each contain a globular domain, with that of the dimer being slightly larger than that of the monomer. Electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions revealed two polypeptides of Mr = 185,000 and 179,000. A similarity to type IV collagen was indicated by a glycine content of less than 33 mol % and the presence of fucose, mannose, and glucosamine residues. Treatment of the collagen with pepsin resulted in loss of the globular domains but retention of 90% of the length of fibrous collagen segments. Collagenase, however, removed the fibrous regions but left the globular moieties intact. These results extend the previously proposed model (Hung, C.-H., Noelken, M. E., and Hudson, B. G. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 3822-3826) in which the collagenous domain consists of two monomer-sized triple-helical subunits joined end-to-end by disulfide bonds, with the constituent chains of each subunit being cross-linked by disulfide bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1578813902,"Rat apolipoprotein E (apo-E) exists in plasma as four unique isoelectric forms (designated E-1, E-2, E-3, or E-4 from acidic to basic, respectively). We have examined the processes accounting for this polymorphism using intact rats or cultured rat hepatocytes. Intrahepatic precursors of rat apo-E were isolated and analyzed on isoelectric focusing gels. The primary translation product of rat liver apo-E mRNA focused as two isoproteins with more basic pI values than the isoproteins of plasma apo-E. The microsome-processed translation product also focused as two isoproteins having pI values corresponding to apo-E-4 and apo-E-3 isoproteins of plasma apo-E. Following a bolus injection of [3H]leucine into the portal vein, intrahepatic isoproteins corresponding to plasma apo-E-2 and apo-E-1 isoproteins were first detected in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and Golgi fractions, respectively. The apparent molecular weight of intrahepatic apo-E increased as it passed from the RER to the Golgi. Only the most acidic isoform, apo-E-1, of plasma apo-E was sensitive to neuraminidase treatment indicating that sialic acid residues are responsible, in part, for the polymorphism of rat apo-E. Using cultured hepatocytes, tunicamycin (1 microgram/ml) inhibited the incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into both molecular weight forms of apolipoprotein B but did not influence the synthesis, glycosylation (as measured by [3H]glucosamine incorporation), or secretion of apo-E. Tunicamycin-inhibited hepatocytes secreted the normal complement of apo-E isoforms including apo-E-1, thus confirming that apo-E-1 is not an N-linked glycoprotein. These results suggest that post-translational modifications involving both RER and Golgi-specific reactions contribute to the polymorphism of rat apo-E."
https://openalex.org/W1538540461,"UDP-glucose 4-epimerase from Saccharomyces fragilis was inactivated by the arginine-specific reagents phenylglyoxal, 1,2-cyclohexanedione, and 2,3-butanedione following pseudo first order reaction kinetics. The reaction order with respect to phenylglyoxal was 1.8 and that with respect to the other two diones was close to unity. Protection afforded by substrate and competitive inhibitors against inactivation by phenylglyoxal and the reduced interaction of 1-anilinonaphthalene 8-sulfonic acid, a fluorescent probe for the substrate-binding region after phenylglyoxal modification, suggested the presence of an essential arginine residue at the substrate-binding region. Experiments with [7-14C]phenylglyoxal in the presence of UMP, a ligand known to interact at the substrate-binding region, showed that only the arginine residue at the active site could be modified by phenylglyoxal. The characteristic coenzyme fluorescence of the yeast enzyme was found to be enhanced three times in phenylglyoxal-inactivated enzyme suggesting the incorporation of the phenyl ring near the pyridine moiety of NAD."
https://openalex.org/W1563170921,"Tropomyosin has been isolated from microvilli preparations from 13762 rat mammary adenocarcinoma ascites tumor cells by Triton extraction and pelleting of the microvillar microfilament core, extraction of the microfilament core with 1 M KCl, heat treatment, and hydroxyapatite chromatography. Three major isoforms, designated 31K-a (acidic), 31K-b (basic), and 29K, were identified as tropomyosins by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing-dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis, a urea shift on dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis, chemical cross-linking, amino acid analysis, and molecular weight determinations. The native (60,000) and subunit (31,000 and 29,000) molecular weights, the amino acid composition, and the stoichiometry for binding to F-actin (actin/tropomyosin, 6:1) were typical of nonmuscle tropomyosins. The amount of tropomyosin present in the microvilli preparations is sufficient to saturate about half of the microvillar F-actin. By two-dimensional isoelectric focusing-dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis, the 31K isoforms appeared similar to isoforms of normal rat kidney cells but the 29K isoform was apparently smaller than any normal rat kidney isoforms. All three isoforms bound to F-actin, but the 29K form bound most strongly. Its behavior was similar to that of muscle tropomyosin, exhibiting saturable binding as a function of both ionic strength and Mg2+ concentration. In contrast, the 31K isoforms bound more weakly and required higher concentrations of Mg2+ for binding than that required for saturation with 29K (4 mM). These results clearly indicate that nonmuscle tropomyosin isoforms from a single source and location (subplasmalemmal) in the cell can exhibit different properties."

https://openalex.org/W1551923710,"A novel lectin has been found in human plasma. The lectin was purified by affinity chromatography using an adsorbent in which 2-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-O-beta-D-galactopyranosylhydroxylysine (Glc-Gal-Hyl) was coupled to Sepharose. The molecular weight of the lectin was determined by gradient gel electrophoresis to be approximately 240,000. On polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulphate, the subunit had the molecular weight of 29,500. Composition analysis has shown the lectin is a glycoprotein in which 12% of the molecule consists of carbohydrate. Native human, horse, calf, sheep, rabbit, and rat erythrocytes were agglutinated by the lectin in the presence of calcium. Glc-Gal-Hyl, N-acetylated Glc-Gal-Hyl, and stachyose inhibited the hemagglutination, whereas monosaccharides, maltose, cellobiose, lactose, raffinose, galactosylhydroxylysine, and N-acetylated galactosylhydroxylysine were not inhibitory. The lectin is strongly inhibited by the desialylated bovine erythrocyte glycoprotein, which contains galactose beta 1-3galactose beta-sequence at the nonreducing termini of the sugar chains, whereas disialylated orosomucoid did not inhibit the lectin. These results indicate that the lectin recognizes the penultimate galactose residue in a hapten molecule in contrast to usual galactose-binding proteins or galactose-specific lectins, which recognize exposed, terminal galactose residues of sugar chains."
https://openalex.org/W1479708666,"Oxaloacetate keto-enol tautomerase, partially purified from porcine kidney, catalyzes the conversion of enol- to keto-oxaloacetate by a mechanism in which solvent protons end up equally distributed between the two prochiral positions at C3 of keto-oxaloacetate. This conclusion is based upon the observation that when enzyme catalyzed ketonization is conducted in 3H2O in the presence of excess malate dehydrogenase and NADH, only 50% of the 3H in the isolated (2S)-[3-3H]malate is labilized to solvent upon treatment with fumarase. From a stereochemical perspective, this enzyme is unlike phenylpyruvate keto-enol tautomerase that is known to catalyze stereospecific proton transfer between solvent and the pro-R position of keto-substrate. As a result of an attempt to clarify the physiological importance of oxaloacetate tautomerase activity, keto-oxaloacetate was demonstrated to be directly transported across the inner membrane of rat liver mitochondria on the basis of the results of kinetic and isotope-trapping experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1544224284,"The present study has made use of a covalent cross-linking agent, dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate), to study the self-association of prothrombin and has demonstrated that the covalent dimerization reaction involves the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid region of prothrombin (1-42 of 582). An essential role for the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues of prothrombin in the association reaction was demonstrated by experiments that converted gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues to gamma-methylene glutamic acid or glutamic acid and resulted in a prothrombin species that was inactive in our cross-linking assay. Other experiments showed that very high concentrations of calcium ion inhibit the cross-linkage of prothrombin. This result is most consistent with an essential gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-calcium ion-gamma-carboxyglutamic acid bridge(s) in the calcium-dependent self-associated form of prothrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1568954601,"In concentrations exceeding 1 mg/ml, bovine factor IX exhibits a pink color that arises from a broad absorption band with a lambda max = 500 nm. Analysis by x-ray fluorescence reveals the presence of iron but no other transition metals in the factor IX preparation. Quantitative analysis by atomic absorption spectroscopy indicates that 1 g atom of iron is bound tightly to 1 mol of factor IX. The iron is removed slowly (t1/2 = 3 h) by EDTA. In contrast, prothrombin binds no detectable iron, and factor X binds less than 0.2 g atom/mol. alpha-Hydroxybutyrate chelates Fe3+ with sufficient stability to preclude formation of [Fe(OH)3]n. It is proposed that factor IX binds iron with physiologically significant affinity and that the beta-hydroxyaspartate residue in factor IX is a chelator for the bound metal."
https://openalex.org/W1590510974,"Both the triple-helical and denatured forms of nonfibrillar bovine dermal type I collagen were tested as substrates for the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in an in vitro reaction. Native, triple-helical collagen was not phosphorylated, but collagen that had been thermally denatured into individual alpha chains was a substrate for the protein kinase. Catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylated denatured collagen to between 3 to 4 mol of phosphate/mol of (alpha 1(I)2 alpha 2(I). Pepsin-solubilized and intact collagens were phosphorylated similarly, as long as each was in a nonhelical conformation. The first 2 mol of phosphate incorporated into type I collagen by the protein kinase were present in the alpha 2(I) chain. The alpha 1(I) chain was only phosphorylated during long incubations in which the stoichiometry exceeded 2 mol of phosphate/mol of (alpha 1(I)2 alpha 2(I). Phosphoserine was the only phosphoamino acid identified in collagen that had been phosphorylated to any degree by the protein kinase. The 2 mol of phosphate incorporated into the alpha 2(I) chain were localized to the alpha 2(I)CB4 cyanogen bromide fragment. The catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylated denatured pepsin-solubilized collagen with a Km of 8 microM and a Vmax of approximately 0.1 mumol/min/mg of enzyme. Denatured, but not triple-helical, type I collagen was also phosphorylated by cGMP-dependent protein kinase, although it was a poorer substrate for this enzyme than for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Collagen was not a substrate for phospholipid-sensitive Ca2+-dependent protein kinase. These results suggest the potential for nascent alpha chains of type I collagen to be susceptible to phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase in vivo prior to triple-helix formation. Such a phosphorylation of collagen could be relevant to the action of cAMP to increase the intracellular degradation of newly synthesized collagen."
