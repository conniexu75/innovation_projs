https://openalex.org/W2031623064,"From an economic standpoint, the modern computer is simply the most recent of a long line of new technologies that increase productivity and cause a gradual shift from manufacturing to service employment. The empirical evidence provides no support for the claim sometimes made that the computer ""mechanizes"" and ""dehumanizes"" work. Perhaps the greatest significance of the computer lies in its impact on Man's view of himself. No longer accepting the geocentric view of the universe, he now begins to learn that mind, too, is a phenomenon of nature, explainable in terms of simple mechanisms. Thus the computer aids him to obey, for the first time, the ancient injunction, ""Know thyself."""
https://openalex.org/W1979070393,"The rapid development of large-scale integrated circuits in the last two decades has revolutionized information handling. Higher levels of integration have been achieved principally by making the individual circuit elements smaller, but reduction of random defects and innovations in circuit design have also been important factors. Practical limits to the size of integrated circuits, such as those imposed by the use of photolithography to define the circuits, can be avoided by using other methods, such as solid-state diffusion or electron beams. The prospects are that dimensions and defect densities will continue to be reduced while speed increases. Redundancy in circuits will lead to lower costs and higher levels of integration. As logic becomes more complex and applications narrower, the increased number of unique circuit designs needed tends to increase costs. The microprocessor was developed to answer this problem and will have a radical influence on future computing systems."
https://openalex.org/W2012804698,"Although the limitations of the methods of lithography in use at a particular time are easily recognized and attract substantial attention, experience shows that technological ingenuity keeps pushing them to ever-smaller dimensions. There seems to be no fundamental reason to expect that lithographic limits will not continue to recede. The limits to the advance of miniaturization are to be found in the ability of materials to withstand high electric fields and in the ability of packaging technology to remove heat from active components and provide for power distribution, signal interconnection, and flexible mechanical assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2107917745,"The systematic position of the small invertebrate group, Priapulida, is uncertain. In more recent publications they are classified usually as pseudocoelomates in the division Aschelminthes. A histological investigation of Priapulus caudatus, a widely distributed species, reveals the body cavity to be a coelom, its lining a peritoneum. These features, and others, indicate the priapulids to be. coelomates rather than pseudocoelomates. Unique morphology perhaps qualifies the group for the status of phylum."

https://openalex.org/W2041748847,"Since we do not know of any completely workable solutions to the problems we have considered, we shall settle for a few general observations: 1) The public availability of socially useful computer communications services is and has been held back by legal battles that are now under way between the potential suppliers. 2) No simple resolution of these issues in the near future seems likely in view of the past conceptual separation of computers and communications doctrines. 3) The current policy is to determine whether the nation shall or shall not have certain computer communications services, by the adversary process. In this process, often only the voices of the loudest adversary suppliers are heard. 4) Although there can be no certainty that better alternatives cannot be devised, we believe that such a possibility assumes a higher probability if the key actors come from the technical community sectors more representative of the future consumers. 5) If we are to have the new services that are possible, we need an approach that makes better use of the technologists' dreams and goals rather than have future prospects excessively bound by lawyers paid to preserve the interests of their clients, irrespective of any secondary consequences. 6) We cannot be sanguine about this possibility, as technological statesmanship is too easily corrupted by the same forces that have placed us in this predicament. Furthermore, even if not corrupted, beneficial cooperation can too readily be regarded as simply collusion. 7) Although we do not have any clear answer, we do know that present approaches are not taking us where we want to go very rapidly and that alternative approaches should at least be considered."

https://openalex.org/W2046933638,"By taking daily autoradiographs of a uniformly labeled soil in which plants are growing, patterns of actual ion uptake from the soil can be established. This technique can be used to study such influences on ion uptake as that of plant species ion diffusion, moisture and temperature stresses, and different physical, chemical, and biological properties of the soil."
https://openalex.org/W2008399445,"Demands for more effective information management, coupled with advances in computer hardware and software technology, have resulted in the emergence of the information utility concept, whereby computers specialized for information storage and processing serve as information nodes. The information nodes, which may be interconnected, can provide information management services to both conventional and personal computers. In this article the key hardware and software components of classical information systems are described to provide background on the requirements for an information utility. Four approaches to the development of specialized information nodes, drawing on various advances in technology, are presented: (i) firmware enhancement, (ii) intelligent controllers, (iii) minicomputer back-end processors, and (iv) highly modular database machines. The benefits of these advances will be systems that are more efficient, reliable, and easy to use."

That part of the standard of living which is based on large-scale consumption of energy is not likely to improve during this century. However, those who prefer optimism have reason for hope. Human ingenuity in solving problems is great. And native intelligence has been amplified enormously by the use of knowledge accumulated through research. An important product of research and a basis for hoping for a bright new future is the vitality of the electronics revolution, which promises to be of more enduring consequencethan the earlier industrial revolution."

One basalt pebble was found. The adjacent continental shelf is cut by submarine valleys. Peter I Island, a dissected basaltic volcano 250 miles to the northeast, was visited."

https://openalex.org/W2022047618,"There are two salient points which convey the essence of the impact of integrated electronics in medicine. First, the quality and availability of health care are becoming increasingly dependent on radically new diagnostic, monitoring, and prosthetic instruments provided by electronics. Second, many of these new instruments, such as ultrasonic imaging systems, blood flowmeters, and artificial inner ears, impose very stringent performance requirements, which can be met only through innovative application of integrated electronics. In summary, the initial impact of integrated electronics on health care is now visible, and consequently it is apparent that we are beginning a new era of revolutionary advances in medical instrumentation. Health care may indeed present the most promising opportunity to improve the quality of life in our society through electronics."
https://openalex.org/W2048949400,"Computers today use a hierarchy of large-capacity, relatively slow mechanically accessed memories in conjunction with fast electronically accessed memories of relatively small capacity. While the gap between these is spanned by ingenious organizations and programming, it would be highly desirable to fill it instead by some device of sufficient capacity and speed. Candidates for gap-filling memories include metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) random-access memories (RAM's) made by large-scale integration (LSI); charge-coupled devices; magnetic bubble devices based on cylindrical domains of magnetization; electron beam-addressed memories; and optical memories based on lasers, holography, and electrooptical effects. At present, the MOS RAM is the prime contender. Its natural evolution and the evolution of magnetic-recording techniques on which mass storage is based are likely to continue to shape the future as they have for more than a decade. On the other hand, radically new technologies, still at an early laboratory stage, are aimed at a more ideal solution than today's hierarchy."
https://openalex.org/W2088568949,"What is electronics? Once we associated
electronics with vacuum tubes, but
vacuum tubes are almost obsolete. Perhaps
electronics is semiconductor devices.
But then, what of magnetic cores
and bubbles and liquid crystals? I think
that electronics has really come to mean
all electrical devices for communication,
information processing, and control.
This would include pre-vacuum-tube devices
such as the electric telegraph,
which replaced such light-wave communication
as semaphore telegraphs, signal
flags, and heliographs. It would include
the telephone."

Today, 16 electronic systems can be found on the automobile, and future engine and emission control systems will soon be added. Truck systems of interest include wheel-lock control, vehicle weighing systems, and tire pressure warning devices. Digital electronic displays and multiplex wiring systems are expected to be near-term developments and, on a longer-range basis, it is expected that automatic radar brakes and intoxicated-driver interlocks will receive considerable attention."
