https://openalex.org/W1980259340,"Individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) may be asymptomatic or have AIDS-related complex or the acquired immuno deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Little is known about the factors that influence progression of infection to AIDS. In this study of isolates of HIV-1 obtained at intervals during the infection of four individuals, the development of disease was found to be correlated with the emergence of HIV-1 variants that were more cytopathic in vitro as the disease progressed and that replicated more efficiently in a wide variety of different human cells. The biologic properties of HIV-1 in vitro thus appear to reflect its virulence in the host. Further studies of such sequentially isolated viruses may lead to the identification of viral genes that govern pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1964961772,"The primary structure of the rat liver prolactin receptor has been deduced from a single complementary DNA clone. The sequence begins with a putative 19 amino acid signal peptide followed by the 291 amino acid receptor that includes a single 24 amino acid transmembrane segment. In spite of the fact that the prolactin receptor has a much shorter cytoplasmic region than the growth hormone receptor, there is strong localized sequence identity between these two receptors in both the extracellular and cytoplasmic domains, suggesting that the two receptors originated from a common ancestor."
https://openalex.org/W2003532781,"Specific σ binding sites have been identified in the mammalian brain and lymphoid tissue. In this study, certain gonadal and adrenal steroids, particularly progesterone, were found to inhibit σ receptor binding in homogenates of brain and spleen. The findings suggest that steroids are naturally occurring ligands for σ receptors and raise the possibility that these sites mediate some aspects of steroid-induced mental disturbances and alterations in immune functions."
https://openalex.org/W1993993130,"Genetically transformed maize plants were obtained from protoplasts treated with recombinant DNA. Protoplasts that were digested from embryogenic cell suspension cultures of maize inbred A188 were combined with plasmid DNA containing a gene coding for neomycin phosphotransferase (NPT II) next to the 35S promoter region of cauliflower mosaic virus. A high voltage electrical pulse was applied to the protoplasts, which were then grown on filters placed over feeder layers of maize suspension cells (Black Mexican Sweet) and selected for growth in the presence of kanamycin. Selected cell lines showed NPT II activity. Plants were regenerated from transformed cell lines and grown to maturity. Southern analysis of DNA extracted from callus and plants indicated the presence of the NPT II gene."
https://openalex.org/W2058317622,"Site-directed mutagenesis of the large fragment of DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) yielded two mutant proteins lacking 3',5'-exonuclease activity but having normal polymerase activity. Crystallographic analysis of the mutant proteins showed that neither had any alteration in protein structure other than the expected changes at the mutation sites. These results confirmed the presumed location of the exonuclease active site on the small domain of Klenow fragment and its physical separation from the polymerase active site. An anomalous scattering difference Fourier of a complex of the wild-type enzyme with divalent manganese ion and deoxythymidine monophosphate showed that the exonuclease active site has binding sites for two divalent metal ions. The properties of the mutant proteins suggest that one metal ion plays a role in substrate binding while the other is involved in catalysis of the exonuclease reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1986388523,"A new type of agonist-binding subunit of rat neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) was identified. Rat genomic DNA and complementary DNA encoding this subunit (alpha2) were cloned and analyzed. Complementary DNA expression studies in Xenopus oocytes revealed that the injection of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for alpha2 and beta2 (a neuronal nAChR subunit) led to the generation of a functional nAChR. In contrast to the other known neuronal nAChRs, the receptor produced by the injection of alpha2 and beta2 mRNAs was resistant to the α-neurotoxin Bgt3.1. In situ hybridization histochemistry showed that alpha2 mRNA was expressed in a small number of regions, in contrast to the wide distribution of the other known agonist-binding subunits (alpha3 and alpha4) mRNAs. These results demonstrate that the alpha2 subunit differs from other known agonist-binding α-subunits of nAChRs in its distribution in the brain and in its pharmacology."
https://openalex.org/W2067245236,"The elastin receptor complex contains a component of 67 kilodaltons that binds to a glycoconjugate affinity column containing beta-galactoside residues and is eluted from this column with lactose. This protein component is also released from the surface of cultured chondroblasts by incubation with lactose, and its association with immobilized elastin is inhibited by lactose. Since lactose also blocks elastic fiber formation by cultured chondroblasts, the galactoside-binding property of the elastin receptor is implicated in this process."
https://openalex.org/W1605746073,"A monoclonal antibody, P1H5, to the human fibroblast class II extracellular matrix receptor (ECMR II) specifically inhibits human fibroblast adhesion to collagen and immunoprecipitates a cell surface receptor containing an alpha and beta subunit of approximately 140 kilodaltons each (Wayner, E. A., and Carter, W. G. (1987) J. Cell Biol. 105, 1873-1884). We report here that P1H5 also specifically inhibits adhesion of unactivated human platelets to type I and III collagens, but not to fibronectin. Immunoprecipitation of the class II ECMR from Triton X-100 detergent lysates of platelets, after cell surface iodination, identified the platelet collagen receptor. Peptide mapping confirmed that the II alpha and II beta subunits immunoprecipitated from platelets are structurally homologous with those derived from fibroblasts. The platelet ECMR II alpha and -beta subunits comigrate with platelet membrane glycoproteins Ia and IIa, respectively, on two-dimensional nonreduced-reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. These results indicate that platelet and fibroblast adhesion to collagen are both mediated by a similar receptor and that the alpha and beta subunits of this receptor are identical to platelet membrane glycoproteins Ia and IIa, respectively. Although glycoprotein Ia has been previously implicated as a collagen binding protein, our results are the first direct evidence that platelet glycoprotein Ia is associated with glycoprotein IIa in a heterodimer complex and that this complex, by mediating platelet attachment, is an actual receptor for platelet adhesion to collagen."
https://openalex.org/W1565745037,"Thioredoxin, a dithiol polypeptide, has been examined as a potential contributor to the recovery of lens epithelial cells from oxidative insult. It is reported that Escherichia coli thioredoxin can (a) effectively reduce lens-soluble protein disulfide bonds generated by H2O2, (b) restore to its initial activity H2O2-inactivated glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, (c) act as an effective source of reducing potential for lens methionine sulfoxide peptide reductase, and (d) act as a free radical quencher based on studies with a stable free radical system generated by ascorbic acid and 2,6-dimethoxy-p-benzoquinone. Thioredoxin is much more effective than dithiothreitol in restoring glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity and as a cofactor for methionine sulfoxide peptide reductase. Upon incubation with epithelial cells, thioredoxin can be observed in the cell using rocket immunoelectrophoresis. These cells recover from H2O2 insult more rapidly than control cell preparations based upon 1) analyses of plasma membrane-related activities: leucine and 86Rb uptake and 2) analyses of parameters primarily related to the internal cell metabolism: ATP concentration and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. Analysis of thioredoxin in cell preparations indicates that only about 9% is in the reduced state implying a low effective concentration of the polypeptide. The experiments suggest that low levels of thioredoxin may significantly increase the ability of lens epithelial cells to recover from exposure to H2O2."
https://openalex.org/W1512804327,"The distribution of hepatic binding sites for the calcium-mobilizing second messenger, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), was analyzed in subcellular fractions of the rat liver by binding studies with [32P]IP3 and compared with the Ca2+ release elicited by IP3 in each fraction. Three major subcellular fractions enriched in plasma membrane, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum were characterized for their 5'-nucleotidase, glucose-6-phosphatase, succinate reductase, and angiotensin II binding activities. The fraction enriched in plasma membrane showed 7- and 20-fold increases in IP3 binding capacity over those enriched in endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, respectively, and contained a single class of high-affinity binding sites with Kd of 1.7 +/- 1.0 nM and concentration of 239 +/- 91 fmol/mg protein. IP3 binding reached equilibrium in 30 min at 0 degrees C, and the half-time of dissociation was about 15 min. The specificity of the IP3 binding sites was indicated by their markedly lower affinities for inositol 1-phosphate, phytic acid, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate. The Ca2+-releasing activity of IP3 in the subcellular fractions was monitored with the fluorescent indicator, Fura-2. All three fractions showed ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake and rapidly released Ca2+ in response in IP3. The fraction enriched in plasma membrane was the most active in this regard, releasing 174 +/- 67 pmol Ca2+/mg of protein compared to 45 +/- 10 and 48 +/- 7 pmol/mg protein for the fractions enriched in endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, respectively. These data suggest that the [32P]IP3 binding sites represent specific intracellular receptors through which IP3 mobilizes Ca2+ from a storage site associated (or co-purifying) with the plasma membrane of the rat liver. It is likely that a specialized vesicular system (to which IP3 can bind and trigger the release of Ca2+) is located in close proximity with the plasma membrane and is thus adjacent to the site at which IP3 is produced during stimulation of the hepatocyte by Ca2+-mobilizing hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1572696798,"Trypsin exerts insulin-like effects in intact cells and on partially purified preparations of insulin receptors. To elucidate the mechanism of these insulinomimetic effects, we compared the structures of insulin- and trypsin-activated receptor species with their functions, including insulin binding, autophosphorylation, and tyrosine kinase activity. In vitro treatment of wheat germ agglutinin-purified receptor preparations with trypsin resulted in proteolysis of both alpha- and beta-subunits. The activated form of the receptor had an apparent molecular mass of 110 kDa under nonreducing conditions, compared to the 400-kDa intact receptor, and was separated following reduction into an 85-kDa beta-subunit related fragment and a 25-kDa alpha-subunit related fragment. Treatment of whole cells with trypsin prior to isolation of the insulin receptor resulted in proteolytic modification of the alpha-subunit only. In this case, the total molecular mass of the activated species was 116 kDa, comprised of an intact 92-kDa beta-subunit and again a 25-kDa alpha-subunit related fragment. Values of Km for peptide substrate phosphorylation and Ki for inhibition of receptor autophosphorylation, and sites of autophosphorylation within the beta-subunits were similar for receptors activated either by insulin or trypsin. Insulin had no additional effect on the rate of autophosphorylation of the truncated receptor, and no binding of insulin by the truncated receptor was detected either by direct assay or cross-linking with bifunctional reagents. Based on the deduced amino acid sequence of the insulin receptor and the structural studies presented here we concluded that this activated form of the receptor resulted from tryptic cleavage at the dibasic site Arg576-Arg577. This was accompanied by loss of the insulin binding site and separation of alpha-beta heterodimers. As truncation of the alpha-subunit results in beta-subunit activation, it appears that the beta-subunit is a constitutively activated kinase and that the function of the alpha-subunit in the intact receptor is to inhibit the beta-subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2073073419,"The transition from the expression of alpha, the first set of five herpes simplex virus genes expressed after infection, to beta and gamma genes, expressed later in infection, requires the participation of infected cell protein 4 (alpha 4), the major viral regulatory protein. The alpha 4 protein is present in complexes formed by proteins extracted from infected cells and viral DNA fragments derived from promoter domains. This report shows that the alpha 4 protein forms specific complexes with DNA fragments derived from 5' transcribed noncoding domains of late (gamma 2) genes whose expression requires viral DNA synthesis as well as functional alpha 4 protein. Some of the DNA fragments to which alpha 4 binds do not contain homologs of the previously reported DNA binding site consensus sequence, suggesting that alpha 4 may recognize and interact with more than one type of DNA binding site. The alpha 4 proteins can bind to DNA directly. A posttranslationally modified form of the alpha 4 protein designated alpha 4c differs from the alpha 4a and alpha 4b forms with respect to its affinity for DNA fragments differing in the nucleotide sequences of the binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W2011630904,"Transcription of the yeast C upsilon C1 gene (iso-1-cytochrome c) is regulated in part by the upstream activation site UAS2. Activity of UAS2 requires both the HAP2 and HAP3 activators, which bind to UAS2 in an interdependent manner. To distinguish whether these factors bound to UAS2 cooperatively or formed a complex in the absence of DNA, HAP2 and HAP3 were tagged by gene fusion to LexA and beta-galactosidase, respectively, and purified through four chromatographic steps. The copurification of LexA-HAP2, HAP3 beta-galactosidase, and UAS2 binding activity shows that HAP2 and HAP3 associate in the absence of DNA to form a multisubunit activation complex."
https://openalex.org/W1513797942,"The gene coding for the ethanol-inducible, developmentally regulated P450IIE1 was isolated from an lambda EMBL 3 rat genomic library and completely sequenced. The gene spanned 10,373 base pairs and contained nine exons. Upstream and downstream DNA of 1530 and 825 base pairs, respectively, was also sequenced, and the transcription start site was identified by both S1 mapping and primer extension. A typical TATA box was found just upstream of the start site; however, no CCAAT box was apparent. Other repetitive sequences were identified including a partial R.dre.1 sequence upstream of the gene and a long stretch of 160 alternating purines in the second intron. This latter repetitive element is found in many mammalian genes. By use of a panel of mouse-hamster somatic cell hybrids, the P450IIE1 gene was localized to mouse chromosome 7. The hepatic P450IIE1 gene is transcriptionally activated within 1 day after birth and reaches a maximal level of expression at 6 days of age. Using restriction endonuclease sites generated from the gene sequence data and the cytosine methylation-sensitive enzymes HhaI and HpaII, we found that this transcriptional activation during early development is coincident with specific demethylation only at the 5' end of the P450IIE1 gene. Interestingly, other cytosine residues in the middle of the gene became demethylated as rats aged from 1 to 10 weeks, at which time no changes in gene expression occur."
https://openalex.org/W1608917238,"Platelet responses to agonists are believed to be mediated by at least two pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins: Gi which inhibits adenylyl cyclase and Gp, which stimulates phospholipase C. The present studies compare the properties of Gi and Gp and examine their interactions with the receptors for various platelet agonists. In permeabilized platelets and platelet membranes, pertussis toxin [32P]ADP-ribosylated a protein(s) (alpha 41) which migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis fractionally below rabbit and bovine alpha i (Mr = 41,000). Prior exposure of the platelets to an agonist inhibited the [32P]ADP-ribosylation of alpha 41 to an extent which correlated with the pattern of responses to that agonist. Thrombin, which elicited responses that were mediated by both Gi and Gp, decreased radiolabeling by greater than 90%. Epinephrine, which was functionally coupled only to Gi, decreased radiolabeling by 50%, as did vasopressin and platelet-activating factor (PAF), which were coupled only to Gp. U46619, a thromboxane analog which neither inhibited cAMP formation nor caused pertussis toxin-sensitive phosphoinositide hydrolysis, had no effect on 32P-ADP-ribosylation. These results suggest that either G alpha 41 regulates more than one enzyme or that alpha subunits from more than one G protein comigrate within alpha 41. Two-dimensional electrophoresis was used to test the latter possibility. Upon isoelectric focusing, alpha 41 resolved into two distinct subspecies. However, these appear to be minor variants rather than functionally distinct alpha subunits since: 1) both proteins produced the same proteolytic fragments after digestion with chymotrypsin or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and 2) preincubation of the platelets with agonists, including those which appear to interact in intact platelets solely with Gp (PAF and vasopressin) or solely with Gi (epinephrine), inhibited the [32P]ADP-ribosylation of both proteins to the same extent. The pattern of functional responses produced by some of the agonists was found to depend upon the conditions used for the assay. Although unable to inhibit cAMP formation in intact platelets, both PAF and vasopressin caused pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in isolated membranes. Collectively, these observations suggest that 1) in platelets a single pertussis toxin-sensitive, alpha 41-containing G protein may be involved in the regulation of both adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C and 2) additional constraints which are altered during membrane isolation may help to determine which enzyme is coupled to which agonist."
https://openalex.org/W124868806,"We report the sequences of cDNA clones for two different integrin beta subunits isolated from a Xenopus laevis neurula cDNA library. mRNAs corresponding to both genes are first detected at gastrulation. We show that these two beta subunits are very highly related (98% identity in amino acid sequence) and probably arose at the time of tetraploidization of the X. laevis genome around 50 million years ago. Comparison of these sequences with those of various other vertebrate integrin beta subunit establishes that all species analyzed to date contain a highly conserved integrin beta subunit (beta 1). The interspecies homologies within this class of integrin beta subunits (82-86% identity in amino acid sequence) are much greater than those among the three different beta subunits which are known in humans (40-48% identity in amino acid sequence). Analysis of the homologies clearly indicates duplication and divergence of this multigene family more than 500 million years ago prior to the appearance of the vertebrates. We also observe cross-hybridization between cDNA probes for chicken integrin beta subunits and genomic DNAs of several invertebrate species. Despite the divergence in sequence among different integrin beta subunits, certain features of their structure are remarkably conserved."
https://openalex.org/W1499670582,"Binding of 125I-labeled high molecular weight kininogen (high Mr kininogen) to cultured human endothelial cells derived from the umbilical cord was demonstrated. The binding was time-dependent, specific, and saturable and required the presence of zinc ions. Maximal binding of 125I-labeled high Mr kininogen was observed at 50 microM Zn2+. Calcium ions inhibited the Zn2+-dependent binding of 125I-labeled high Mr kininogen to endothelial cells. In the presence of 3 mM CaCl2 the total binding of 125I-labeled high Mr kininogen was significantly decreased, and a concentration of 100 microM Zn2+ was then required for the binding of 125I-labeled high Mr kininogen to the cells. Higher calcium concentrations did not further decrease the binding of 125I-labeled high Mr kininogen. Analysis of the binding data by the LIGAND computer program indicated 3.2 X 10(6) binding sites per cell for high Mr kininogen with an apparent Kd of 35 nM at 50 microM ZnCl2 and 1 mM CaCl2. Binding of high Mr kininogen also occurred at physiological plasma Zn2+ concentrations. Saturation of the high Mr kininogen binding sites at 25 microM ZnCl2 occurred at 80 nM of high Mr kininogen with 2.8 X 10(6) molecules of high Mr kininogen bound per cell. At 10 microM ZnCl2, the high Mr kininogen binding sites appeared to be saturated at 130 nM with 1.6 X 10(6) molecules bound per cell. In addition it was demonstrated that endothelial cells internalize 125I-labeled high Mr kininogen, since 125I-labeled high Mr kininogen was detected in solubilized endothelial cells after the cell-bound 125I-labeled high Mr kininogen had been removed with dextran sulfate."
https://openalex.org/W1583600685,"Protein n' of Escherichia coli functions in assembly and translocation of the primosome, a mobile multiprotein complex involved in priming DNA replication (Kornberg, A. (1982) Supplement to DNA Replication, Freeman Publications, San Francisco). By itself, protein n' translocates on single-stranded DNA and destabilizes duplex regions by acting as a DNA helicase, using the energy of ATP or dATP hydrolysis. Single-stranded DNA binding protein was required for melting of duplex regions longer than 40 base pairs. Initial binding of protein n' to a specific site on DNA (Shlomai, J., and Kornberg, A. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 77, 799-803) is essential for its helicase function. The polarity of protein n' translocation on DNA, in the 3' to 5' direction of the chain, suggests a mechanism for how the primosome may contribute to concurrent replication of both strands at a replication fork."
https://openalex.org/W1509980140,"The ability of insulin to activate the insulin receptor protein is shown to be completely dependent on prior beta subunit autophosphorylation. Autophosphorylation in the presence of insulin is a highly concerted reaction; tryptic digestion of insulin receptor beta subunits derived from preparations whose activation ranges from under 5% to 100% of maximal yields the same array of [32P]Tyr(P)-containing peptides over the entire range. Of special note is the significant contribution of multiply phosphorylated forms of tryptic peptides corresponding to proreceptor residues 1144-1152 (from the tyrosine kinase domain) and 1314-1329 (near the carboxyl terminus) to overall beta subunit phosphorylation at activations of 5% and under. Thus, partially activated/autophosphorylated receptor preparations consist of mixtures of unactivated unphosphorylated receptors and activated fully (or nearly fully) phosphorylated receptors. The latter can be selectively removed by adsorption to antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. This abrupt multiple phosphorylation of individual receptor molecules explains why, in the presence of insulin, overall beta subunit phosphorylation tracks closely with kinase, up to approximately 90% activation. Insulin stimulates phosphorylation into all domains (involving at least 6 of the 13 tyrosines on the intracellular portion of the beta subunit) but does not cause the appearance of new 32P-labeled species. Rather, insulin directs 32P incorporation preferentially into those domains most productive of activation. Phosphorylation of the residues at 1146, 1150, and 1151 correlates most closely with activation. These residues show the largest 32P incorporation during rapid activation; moreover, in comparisons of receptors with similar overall autophosphorylation but very different activations (or similar activations but different extents of autophosphorylation), achieved by omitting insulin or varying [ATP], the phosphorylation of peptide 1144-1152 tracks closely with activation, and phosphorylation of sites and Mr 4000-5000 tryptic peptide (presumably Tyr 953 and/or 960) tract nearly as well. By contrast the extent of phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal peptide is frequently dissociated from the extent of activation. Phosphorylation of this latter domain probably underlies a beta subunit function other than activity."
https://openalex.org/W2061682021,"To examine the correlation between CheA phosphorylation and bacterial chemotaxis, cheA mutations leading to defects in chemotaxis were mapped and characterized. Mutant CheA proteins were tested in vitro for phosphorylation and were grouped into four classes: nonphosphorylated, partially phosphorylated, phosphorylated but not dephosphorylated by CheB and CheY, and phosphorylated and dephosphorylated. Nearly all the mutants were found to be defective in an aspect of phosphorylation. Furthermore, the mutant phenotypes were found to cluster in different regions of the cheA gene. We suggest that the CheA protein has three functional domains: one for interaction with CheB and CheY, a second for regulating phosphorylation and controlling the stability of the protein, and a third for receiving input signals regulating CheA activity."

Their long-range electron transfer with zinc-substituted cytochrome c peroxidase (ZnCcP) has been studied by two kinetic techniques. The charge-separated complex, [(ZnCcP)+,FeIICc] converts to [ZnCcP,FeIIICc] by a single, intracomplex electron transfer step that is not governed by ""gating"" through possible rapid dissociation of the complex or isomerization (for example, heme-ligand) by FeIICc subsequent to its formation from FeIIICc.

https://openalex.org/W2031458084,"The effects of lithium on inositol phosphate metabolism may account for the therapeutic actions of lithium in affective disorder. Muscarinic stimulation of the phosphoinositide system blocks synaptic inhibitory actions of adenosine in the hippocampal slice. At therapeutic concentrations, lithium diminished this muscarinic response, whereas rubidium, which does not affect phosphoinositide metabolism, had no effect. A dampening of phosphoinositide-mediated neurotransmission may explain the normalizing effects of lithium in treating both mania and depression."
https://openalex.org/W1501497997,"The plasma cholesteryl ester-transfer protein (CETP, Mr 74,000) promotes exchange of both neutral lipids and phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, PC) between lipoproteins. To investigate the mechanism of facilitated lipid transfer, CETP was incubated with unilamellar egg PC vesicles containing small amounts of cholesteryl ester (CE) or triglyceride, and then analyzed by gel filtration chromatography. There was rapid transfer of radiolabeled CE or triglyceride and PC from vesicles to CETP. The CETP with bound lipids was isolated and incubated with low density lipoproteins (LDL), resulting in transfer of the lipids to LDL. The CETP bound up to 0.9 mol of CE or 0.2 mol of triglyceride and 11 mol of PC/mol of CETP. para-Chloromercuriphenylsulfonate, an inhibitor of CE and triglyceride transfer, was found to decrease the binding of radiolabeled CE and triglyceride by CETP. Under various conditions the CETP eluted either as an apparent monomer with bound lipid (Mr 75,000-93,000), or in complexes with vesicles. The distribution of CETP between these two states was influenced by the presence of apoA-I or albumin, incubation time, vesicle/CETP ratio, and buffer pH and ionic strength. The results indicate that the CETP has binding sites for CE, triglyceride, and PC which readily equilibrate with lipoprotein lipids and suggest that CETP can act as a carrier of lipid between lipoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W66667037,"We have compared the modes and rates of cytochrome c diffusion to the rates of cytochrome c-mediated electron transport in isolated inner membranes and in whole intact mitochondria. For inner membranes, an increasing ionic strength results in an increasing rate of cytochrome c diffusion, a decreasing concentration (affinity) of cytochrome c near the membrane surface as well as near its redox partners, and an increasing rate of electron transport. For intact mitochondria, an increasing ionic strength results in a parallel, increasing rate of cytochrome c-mediated electron transport. In both inner membranes and intact mitochondria the rate of cytochrome c-mediated electron transport is highest at physiological ionic strength (100-150 mM), where the diffusion rate of cytochrome c is highest and its diffusion mode is three-dimensional. In intact mitochondria, succinate and duroquinol-driven reduction of endogenous cytochrome c is greater than 95% at all ionic strengths, indicating that cytochrome c functions as a common pool irrespective of its diffusion mode. Using a new treatment to obtain bimolecular diffusion-controlled collision frequencies in a heterogenous diffusion system, where cytochrome c diffuses laterally, pseudo-laterally, or three-dimensionally while its redox partners diffuse laterally, we determined a high degree of collision efficiency (turnover/collisions) for cytochrome c with its redox partners for all diffusion modes of cytochrome c. At physiological ionic strength, the rapid diffusion of cytochrome c in three dimensions and its low concentration (affinity) near the surface of the inner membrane mediate the highest rate of electron transport through maximum collision efficiencies. These data reveal that the diffusion rate and concentration of cytochrome c near the surface of the inner membrane are rate-limiting for maximal (uncoupled) electron transport activity, approaching diffusion control."
https://openalex.org/W1482744074,"Fusion of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with Vero cells was measured after exposure of the virus to low pH under a variety of experimental conditions. The method of relief of fluorescence self-quenching of the probe octadecylrhodamine was used to monitor fusion. Incubation of the virus at pH 5.5 prior to binding to cells led to significant enhancement of fusion at the plasma membrane, whereas fusion via the endocytic pathway was inhibited. Fusion of pH 5.5-pretreated VSV showed a similar pH threshold for fusion as nontreated virus, and it was blocked by antibody to VSV G protein. Activation of VSV by pretreatment at low pH was only slightly dependent on temperature. In contrast, when VSV was first bound to target cells and subsequently exposed at 4 degrees C to the low pH, activation of the fusion process did not occur. The pH 5.5-mediated activation of VSV could be reversed by returning the pH to neutral in the absence of target membranes. The low pH pretreatment also led to aggregation of virus; large aggregates could be pelleted by low speed centrifugation and only the effects of the supernatant, which consist of single virions and/or microaggregates, were considered. The data were analyzed in the framework of an allosteric model according to which viral spike glycoproteins undergo a pH-dependent conformational transition to an active (fusion-competent) state. Based on that analysis we conclude that the conformational transition to the active state is rate-limiting for fusion and that the viral spike glycoproteins are fusion-competent only in their protonated form."
https://openalex.org/W1560917940,"Detergent extraction of plasma membranes from differentiated HL60 cells, specifically labeled with the chemoattractant, formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-[125I-Tyr] Lys, resulted in the solubilization of a receptor-radioligand complex. GTP-binding activity coeluted with the radioligand when the sodium cholate extract was purified by chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose 6MB. A molecular size of approximately 59 A was estimated for the lectin-Sepharose-purified receptor complex by gel filtration chromatography on Ultrogel AcA 34. The isolated complex eluted from the gel filtration column exhibited an enhanced rate of ligand dissociation in response to GTP gamma S. Approximately 0.65 mol of pertussis toxin substrate/mol of receptor was estimated following partial purification of the receptor-ligand complex by sequential chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose, DEAE-Fractogel, and Ultrogel AcA 34. The pertussis toxin substrate which copurified with the receptor was compared with two distinct G proteins, containing alpha-subunits of 40 and 41 kDa, previously purified from HL60 cell plasma membranes. Approximately 86% of the pertussis toxin substrate identified in the receptor preparation consisted of the 40-kDa polypeptide. Differences in the peptide maps indicate that the predominant G protein which coelutes with the receptor is distinct from the purified G protein with an alpha-subunit of 41 kDa but homologous to the purified G protein with an alpha-subunit of 40 kDa."
https://openalex.org/W1608161746,"We have determined the modes and rates of cytochrome c diffusion as well as the collision frequencies of cytochrome c with its redox partners at the surface of the isolated, mitochondrial inner membrane over a broad range (0-150 mM) of ionic strengths. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, resonance energy transfer, and direct binding assay, we determined that the diffusion coefficient of cytochrome c is independent of its concentration and quantity bound to the inner membrane, that the distance of cytochrome c from the membrane surface increases with increasing ionic strength, and that there is no significant immobile fraction of cytochrome c on the membrane regardless of ionic strength. The rate of cytochrome c diffusion increases while its mode of diffusion changes progressively from lateral to three-dimensional with increasing ionic strength. At physiological ionic strength (100-150 mM), the diffusion of cytochrome c is three-dimensional with respect to the surface of the inner membrane with a coefficient of 1.0 x 10(-6) cm2/s, and little, if any cytochrome c is bound to the membrane regardless of its concentration. Furthermore, as ionic strength is raised from zero to 150 mM, the cytochrome ckd for the inner membrane increases, its mean occupancy time on the inner membrane to collide with a redox partner (tau) decreases, and its diffusion-based collision frequencies with its redox partners decrease. These data reveal the significance of both diffusion and concentration (affinity) of cytochrome c near the surface of the inner membrane in the control of the collision frequency of cytochrome c with its redox partners."
https://openalex.org/W1607369685,"The nucleotide sequence of the fabA gene encoding beta-hydroxydecanoyl thioester dehydrase, a key enzyme of the unsaturated fatty acid synthesis pathway of Escherichia coli, has been determined by the dideoxynucleotide sequencing technique. Most of the sequence was obtained by sequencing intragenic insertions of the transposon, Tn1000, isolated in vivo. A synthetic primer complementary to a portion of the inverted repeat sequences at the ends of the transposon was used to prime DNA synthesis into the flanking fabA sequences. The gene is composed of 516 nucleotides (171 amino acid residues) encoding a protein with a molecular weight of 18,800. Approximately half of the derived amino acid sequence was confirmed by automated Edman sequencing of peptides obtained by cyanogen bromide cleavage. The active site histidine residue (His-70) has been identified by analysis of the peptides labeled by reaction with 14C-labeled 3-decynoyl-N-acetylcysteamine, a specific mechanism-activated inhibitor. A cysteine residue (Cys-69) adjacent to the active site histidine may play the role in catalysis previously assigned to a tyrosine residue. We also report a simplified purification process for the dehydrase beginning with extracts of a brain which greatly overproduces the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1491645799,"In order to characterize the mechanism of activation of the enzyme 1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.67) which is the limiting step in the regulation of the synthesis of the potent inflammatory mediator 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; homogenates from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes were incubated in the presence of the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and in the presence of a partially purified phospholipid sensitive, calcium-dependent protein kinase (PrKC). The first kinase was found to enhance up to 3-fold acetyltransferase activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In homogenates from PMN previously stimulated with complement-coated zymosan particles, the decay of acetyltransferase activity was partially prevented by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor and almost completely inhibited when the homogenates were supplemented with inhibitors of alkaline phosphatase such as 50 mM KF and 100 microM paranitrophenylphosphate. Under these conditions it was possible to initiate the decay of acetyltransferase activity by adding an excess of alkaline phosphatase. Preincubation of PMN with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate previous or simultaneously to the addition of ionophore A23187 reduced the increase in acetyltransferase produced by ionophore A23187, whereas the generation of superoxide anions was enhanced. Addition of partially purified PrKC to homogenates from ionophore A23187-stimulated PMN, reduced acetyltransferase activity by 63%, whereas only a 16% inhibition was observed on homogenates from resting PMN. These data indicate the modulation of acetyltransferase activity in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes by a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanism linked to cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Phospholipid sensitive, calcium-dependent protein kinase seems not to be involved in the mechanism of activation, but, most probably, in the generation of negative activation signals."
https://openalex.org/W1526200492,"Rat Leydig cells possess functional high-affinity receptors for angiotensin II (AII). AII inhibits adenylate cyclase activity in Leydig cell membranes and reduces basal and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-stimulated cAMP pools and testosterone production in intact cells. Treatment of cells with an inhibitory dose of forskolin (10(-9) M) and a submaximal dose of AII caused additive inhibition of hCG-stimulated events. The inhibitory action of AII was largely prevented by pertussis toxin prior to the addition of AII alone or in the presence of hCG. This study and our recent report on inhibitory action of low doses of forskolin, 10(-12)-10(-9) M (Khanum, A., and Dufau, M.L. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11456-11459) are indicative of a pertussis toxin-sensitive subunit of adenylate cyclase available for acute regulation of Leydig cell function. 8-bromo-cAMP bypasses the inhibitory effect of forskolin as well as AII. We have, therefore, demonstrated functional AII high-affinity receptor and an acute inhibitory effect of AII on hCG action in Leydig cells. Our results have provided evidence for a pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide inhibitory protein as mediator of the effect of AII. These findings further emphasized the importance of the cAMP pathway in the Leydig cells, and studies also suggest that tubular and locally produced AII could negatively modulate luteinizing hormone stimulation of Leydig cells."
https://openalex.org/W1641422244,"Treatment of Ehrlich ascites cells with 2 mM oleic acid causes a greater than 10-fold increase in the formation of platelet-activating factor (PAF; 1-[3H]alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) from the de novo precursor of PAF, 1-[3H]alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol. Under these conditions, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity, which is known to catalyze the rate-limiting step in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, was stimulated 32% (p less than 0.001) over control cells. Surprisingly, the dithiothreitol-insensitive choline-phosphotransferase activity, which catalyzes the final step in PAF biosynthesis, was reduced approximately 95% in membranes isolated from cells that were pre-treated with 2 mM oleic acid. However, calculations of product formation at this reduced cholinephosphotransferase activity revealed that it was still sufficient to accommodate the increased synthesis of PAF observed in the intact oleic acid-treated cells. Kinetic studies and experiments done with cells treated with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (an acetylhydrolase inhibitor) indicate the various metabolic products formed are derived through the following sequence of reactions: 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol—-1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3- phosphocholine—-1-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine—-1-alkyl- 2(long-chain) acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. These results indicate PAF is the source of alkylacylglycerophosphocholine through the action of an acetylhydrolase and a transacylase as shown in other cell systems. The relative amounts of PAF, lyso-PAF, and alkylacylglycerophosphocholine produced after treatment of the cells with oleic acid in the absence of the phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride inhibitor indicate that the acylation rate for lyso-PAF is considerably slower (i.e. rate-limiting) than the deacetylation of PAF by acetylhydrolase. We further conclude that the final step in the de novo pathway for PAF biosynthesis is under the direct control of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, which emphasizes the importance of this regulatory (rate-limiting) step in the biosynthesis of both phosphatidylcholine and PAF."
https://openalex.org/W1548678457,"The effect of volume perturbation on the interaction of Na+ and H+ with the intracellular and extracellular faces of the Na+/H+ exchanger was studied in UMR-106 cells, a rat osteosarcoma cell line. Osmotic shrinkage of the cells stimulated the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger. Kinetic analysis of this stimulation demonstrated that in hyperosmotically stressed cells, the apparent affinities for intracellular H+ and intracellular Na+ are modified in opposite directions. While there is an increased apparent affinity for protons from 0.275 +/- 0.03 to 0.107 +/- 0.025 microM in isotonic and hypertonic conditions, respectively, the apparent affinity for intracellular Na+ decreases from 83 +/- 9 to 126 +/- 6 mM under the same conditions. Osmotic swelling induced a decreased exchanger activity which appeared to involve reduction in Vmax only without changes in the apparent affinities of either H+i or Na+i. We conclude that: 1) osmotic shrinkage and swelling modify the kinetic behavior of the Na+/H+ exchanger in different modes; 2) in hyperosmotically stressed cells, the interactions of intracellular H+ and Na+ are modified in a selective mode. The described phenomenon may serve as a general mechanism for activation of the exchanger by various stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W261194047,"The cytochrome d complex is one of two membrane-bound terminal oxidases of the Escherichia coli aerobic respiratory chain. Previous studies have shown that this enzyme reconstituted into proteoliposomes rapidly oxidizes ubiquinol-8 as well as the soluble homologue, ubiquinol-1, and that quinol oxidase activity is accompanied by the formation of a transmembrane H+ electrochemical gradient. The enzyme also oxidizes the artificial reductant, N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) with the generation of a H+ electrochemical gradient. In this work, it is established that trypsin digestion of the purified cytochrome d complex cleaves subunit I while subunit II is unaffected. Proteolysis of subunit I is correlated with loss of ubiquinol-8 and ubiquinol-1 oxidase activities. Trypsin digestion has no effect on TMPD oxidase activity. The cytochrome d complex is concluded to possess three distinct active sites for 1) ubiquinol oxidation, 2) TMPD oxidation, and 3) oxygen binding and reduction. Data also suggest that both sites of ubiquinol and TMPD oxidations are located on the periplasmic side of the E. coli membrane while the site of oxygen reduction is on the opposite side."
https://openalex.org/W1552673783,"Antibodies specific for the 80-amino acid hypothetical protein encoded by the in-frame, 3'-extension of a human ubiquitin gene were produced in rabbits by immunization with a 14-residue synthetic peptide. When used to probe HeLa cell extracts for the non-ubiquitin product of this natural fusion gene, the antipeptide sera detected a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 16,000 Da by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. An immunoreactive protein of identical mobility was detected in organisms ranging from Acanthamoeba to man, indicating that the extension protein, like ubiquitin, is highly conserved. The immunoreactive protein was isolated from calf thymus, and direct sequencing revealed the first 16 amino acids to be identical to those predicted from the extension portion of the human cDNA. Thus, ubiquitin was no longer present at the amino terminus. The purified bovine extension protein failed to react with a ubiquitin-specific antibody indicating the absence of isopeptide-linked ubiquitin as well. Moreover, by denaturing gel permeation chromatography the extension has a molecular weight of 10,000 Da, a value that corresponds more closely to the size of the extension alone (9,000 Da) than to the intact fusion protein (17,500 Da). The extension protein, which was found in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of HeLa cells, persisted at high levels when protein synthesis was blocked with cycloheximide or puromycin. These results show that the 80-residue extension protein is the stable, processed product of the ubiquitin fusion gene."
https://openalex.org/W1563267809,"We have isolated two overlapping 17-kilobase (kb) genomic clones which, together, encode the rabbit fast-twitch skeletal muscle calsequestrin. The calsequestrin gene is 8.6 kb in length and consists of 11 exons. S1 nuclease protection and primer extension analyses position the transcription initiation site 191 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation codon. The 5'-flanking sequence contains a CCAAT sequence and two CG-rich sequences but does not have an identifiable TATA box sequence in the anticipated position just upstream of the transcription initiation site. The sequence of the calsequestrin gene confirmed the sequence deduced from cDNA clones derived from neonatal muscle mRNA (Fliegel, L., Ohnishi, M., Carpenter, M. R., Khanna, V. K., Reithmeier, R. A. F., and MacLennan, D. H. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 84, 1167-1171). We could not detect any potential alternative splicing of the transcript in an analysis of this region of the gene that would account for the different sequence found at the carboxyl terminus of adult rabbit fast-twitch skeletal muscle calsequestrin."
https://openalex.org/W1559044977,"Abstract To determine the translation initiation potential of the 5' proximal four AUGs of the polycistronic P/C mRNA of Sendai virus, we have developed an efficient system for oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis utilizing a plasmid vector which contains the replication origin of the single-stranded DNA phage f1 and the phage SP6 promoter. Utilizing uridine containing single-stranded DNA templates of the plasmid vector carrying the P/C gene we introduced point mutations in all four of the putative initiator codons (AUGs) of the P/C gene. Based on the analysis of in vitro translation products from the SP6 polymerase-directed transcripts of the mutants, the first and second AUG codons were assigned to the P and C proteins, respectively. Proteins detected in vitro, Y1 and Y2, initiated from the third and fourth AUG codons, respectively, and originated within the C reading frame. Since the C' protein is encoded in the same reading frame as the C protein but did not initiate from any of the 5' proximal AUGs, the synthesis of the C' protein may start from a non-AUG initiator codon in the P/C gene."
https://openalex.org/W136324177,"A single sulfur substitution for either the axial or the equatorial exocyclic oxygen of adenosine cyclic 3', 5'-phosphate (cAMP) results in diastereometric phosphorothioate analogs of cAMP with agonist versus antagonist properties towards activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Sulfur substitutions for both of the exocyclic oxygens of cAMP results in a dithioate analog of cAMP, adenosine cyclic 3', 5'-phosphorodithioate (cAMPS2), which has antagonist properties. cAMPS2 displaced [3H]cAMP from the binding sites on bovine heart Type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase as demonstrated by equilibrium dialysis experiments with an apparent Kd of 6.3 microM. The addition of 10, 30, or 100 microM cAMPS2 when measuring cAMP-induced activation of pure porcine heart Type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in the amount of cAMP required to produce half-maximal activation (EC50). A plot of the EC50 values as a function of the cAMPS2 concentration resulted in a straight line from which a KI value of 4 microM was derived. cAMPS2 had no significant effect on the degree of cooperativity (n) of cAMP activation of the holoenzyme. These data suggest that the most important structural requirement for the dissociation of the holoenzyme is an equatorial exocyclic oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W1597185663,"The steady-state levels of calcyclin mRNA are regulated by growth factors. Using deletion mutants of the 5'-flanking region and a linked reporter (the bacterial chloroamphenicol transferase gene), we have investigated the elements of the calcyclin gene's promoter that respond to growth factors. By a transient expression assay after transfection in BALB/c/3T3 cells, we have been able to show that the serum-inducible sequences are contained in a 164-base pair fragment just upstream of the cap site. This fragment also contains an enhancer, and responds to platelet-derived growth factor as well as to serum. The sequences from -1371 to -1194 upstream of the cap site contain an element which is negatively regulated by epidermal growth factor. These findings have been confirmed in hamster cell lines in which the deletion mutants of the calcyclin promoter controlled the expression of the cDNA for human thymidine kinase. These results indicate that, like in other growth-regulated genes the activity of the calcyclin promoter is modulated by both positive and negative elements. Even more intriguing, though, is the finding that some of these negative elements may be influenced by growth factors in the environment."
https://openalex.org/W1493954404,"Inhibitors of calcium-dependent proteases (calpains) such as leupeptin and antipain have been shown to selectively inhibit platelet activation by thrombin. Based upon this observation, it has been proposed that calpains play a role in the initiation of platelet activation. In the present studies, we have examined the effect of leupeptin on the earliest known event in thrombin-induced platelet activation: the interaction between the agonist, its receptors, and the guanine nucleotide-binding proteins which stimulate phospholipase C (Gp) and inhibit adenylyl cyclase (Gi). We found that leupeptin inhibited thrombin's ability to stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis, suppress cAMP formation, and dissociate Gp and Gi into subunits. Leupeptin had no effect, however, on the same responses to other agonists or on thrombin binding to platelets. Although these observations might suggest, as others have concluded, that calpain is involved in the initiation of platelet activation by thrombin, we also found that: 1) substituting platelet membranes for intact platelets and decreasing the free Ca2+ concentration below the threshold required for calpain activation did not diminish the effects of leupeptin on phosphoinositide hydrolysis and cAMP formation, 2) washing the platelets after incubation with leupeptin reversed the effects of the inhibitor, 3) permeabilizing the platelets with saponin did not enhance the inhibitory effects of leupeptin, and 4) leupeptin inhibited the proteolysis of fibrinogen and the hydrolysis of S2238 by thrombin. Similar results in these assays were obtained with antipain. Therefore, our observations suggest that the inhibition of platelet activation by leupeptin is due to a direct interaction with thrombin and need not reflect a role for calpain in the initiation of platelet activation."
https://openalex.org/W1486307645,"Monoclonal antibodies specific for the dicarboxylate transporter of pea mitochondria were prepared and used to identify this substrate carrier. The hybridoma library was derived from mice that had been immunized with total mitochondrial membranes. The monoclonal antibodies specific for the dicarboxylate transporter were selected by screening hybridoma supernatants for their ability to inhibit malate- and succinate-dependent oxalacetate reduction by osmotically shocked pea leaf mitochondria. Three monoclonal antibodies were shown to be specific for the dicarboxylate transporter by their ability to 1) inhibit malate and succinate metabolism without affecting alpha-ketoglutarate, citrate, pyruvate, glycine, glutamate, or aspartate metabolism by mitochondria and 2) inhibit malate uptake by a partially purified transporter fraction reconstituted into asolectin vesicles. The dicarboxylate transporter was identified by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation and had an apparent molecular mass of 26,000 Da. The techniques described should prove useful for identifying a number of membrane proteins that can be assayed in situ but are difficult to assay following dissolution of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2115344464,"Wild-type strains of the yeast S. cerevisiae can grow on media containing 90% D20. Using chemical mutagenesis we obtained a number of strains that grow on H2O-containing media but not on otherwise identical media containing 90% D2O. The frequency of these D20-sensitive (ds) mutants is comparable to the frequency of conventional temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants in the same mutagenized sample, and the ds mutations are distributed over a large number of complementation groups. Furthermore, most ds mutants do not display other conditional phenotypes, such as heat, cold, or osmotic sensitivity. Conversely, of 17 cell division cycle is mutants tested, only 2 are also ds. Thus, the ds technique should be useful for producing conditional mutations in genes that are not amenable to the is and cs approaches, and also for generating alternative conditional (ds) alleles in many other genes. In addition, the ds technique should make it possible to generate conditional (ds) mutants in homeothermic animals, thereby extending the advantages of conditional phenotypes to mammalian and avian genetics."
https://openalex.org/W1530234455,"Discrete peptide domains within the primary sequence of cell-surface receptor glycoproteins are believed to regulate not only their function but also their targeting to the cell membrane. To identify sequence elements required for intracellular transport and ligand binding by the human Tac interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor, we prepared expression plasmids encoding a series of artificially mutated or naturally occurring variants of the Tac cDNA. In particular, we sought to further delineate the functional role of the sequences contributed by each of the eight exons that together encode the Tac protein. Deletion of exons 5 through 8 of the receptor had no detectable effect on IL-2 binding or intracellular transport of the Tac protein, and resulted in secreted forms of this IL-2-binding protein. Removal of sequences corresponding to all of exon 4 ablated IL-2 binding activity yet still permitted transport to the cell surface. In contrast, partial deletion of exon 4 sequences resulted in proteins that not only lacked IL-2 binding activity but also were sequestered within the endoplasmic reticulum. Removal of one or both of the N-linked glycosylation sites present in the Tac protein did not impair receptor transport or ligand binding. These results demonstrate that exon 4 of the Tac gene encodes amino acid residues that play an important role in regulating both the intracellular transport and function of this IL-2 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1606331919,"We have analyzed, at nucleotide resolution, the progress of the B-to-Z transition as a function of superhelical density in a 2.2-kilobase plasmid containing the sequence d(C-A)31.d(T-G)31. The transition was monitored by means of reactivity to two chemical probes: diethyl pyrocarbonate, which is sensitive to the presence of Z-DNA, and hydroxylamine, which detects B-Z junctions. At a threshold negative superhelical density between about 0.048 and 0.056, hyper-reactivity to diethyl pyrocarbonate appears throughout the CA/TG repeat and remains as the superhelical density is further increased. However, there is no reactivity characteristic of B-Z junctions until the superhelical density reaches 0.084, when single cytosines at each end of the repeat become hyper-reactive to hydroxylamine. A two-dimensional gel analysis of this system by others (Haniford, D. B., and Pulleyblank, D. E. (1983) Nature 302, 632-634) indicates that only about half of the 62 base pairs of the CA/TG repeat undergo the initial transition at omega = 0.056. Our results indicate that this region of Z-DNA is free to exist anywhere along the CA/TG repeat and is probably constantly in motion. Well defined B-Z junctions are seen only when there is sufficient supercoiling to convert the entire CA/TG sequence to Z-DNA. The implications for possible B-Z transitions in chromosomal domains of different sizes are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2083613709,"A mutation in the white gene of Drosophila mauritiana resulting from insertion of the transposable element mariner exhibits genetic instability in germline and somatic cells. The instability is greatly enhanced in the presence of the trans-acting autosomal factor Mos, giving eye-color mosaics with pigmented sectors of tissue on an otherwise peach-colored background. The Mos factor, when introduced into the genome of the sibling species Drosophila simulans, exhibited a dramatic maternal effect on expression of the mosaic phenotype. When D. simulans mosaic females (heterozygous for Mos) were crossed with non-mosaic males, two distinct classes of mosaic offspring occurred, one resulting from a maternal effect in which the non-Mos offspring were nevertheless mosaic. The maternal effect was mediated by a product acting after fertilization, and was expressed to varying extents in different backcross strains."
https://openalex.org/W1571368341,"Hemopexin alters conformation upon binding heme as shown by circular dichroism (CD), but hemopexin binds the heme analog, iron-meso-tetra-(4-sulfonatophenyl)-porphine (FeTPPS), without undergoing concomitant changes in its CD spectrum. Moreover, FeTPPS, unlike heme, does not increase the compactness of the heme-binding domain (I) of hemopexin shown by an increased sedimentation rate in sucrose gradients. On the other hand, like heme, FeTPPS forms a bishistidyl coordination complex with hemopexin and upon binding protects hemopexin from cleavage by plasmin. Competitive inhibition and saturation studies demonstrate that FeTPPS-hemopexin binds to the hemopexin receptor on mouse hepatoma cells but with a lower affinity (Kd 125 nM) more characteristic of apo-hemopexin than heme-hemopexin (Kd 65 nM). This provides evidence that conformational changes produced in hemopexin upon binding heme, but not upon binding FeTPPS, are important for increasing the affinity of hemopexin for its receptor. The amount of cell-associated radiolabel from 55FeTPPS-hemopexin increases linearly for up to 90 min but at a rate only about a third of that of the mesoheme-complex. As expected from the recycling of hemopexin, more iron-tetrapyrrole than protein is associated with the Hepa cells, but the ratio of 55Fe-ligand to 125I-hemopexin is only 2:1 for FeTPPS-hemopexin compared to 4:1 for mesoheme complexes. [55Fe]Mesoheme was associated at 5 min with lower density fractions containing plasma membranes and at 30 min with fractions containing higher density intracellular compartments. In contrast, 55FeTPPS was found associated with plasma membrane fractions at both times and was not transported into the cell. Although FeTPPS-hemopexin binds to the receptor, subsequent events of heme transport are impaired. The results indicate that upon binding heme at least three types of conformational changes occur in hemopexin which have important roles in receptor recognition and that the nature of the ligand influences subsequent heme transport."
https://openalex.org/W1485963302,"The effect of novobiocin, a coumarin class antibiotic, on rat ribosomal gene (rDNA) transcription in a fractionated extract derived from adenocarcinoma ascites cells (fraction DE-B) was studied. This drug inhibited transcription of rDNA by blocking initiation of transcription, whereas it had no effect on the elongation of the rRNA transcript. Order of addition experiments indicated that the novobiocin effect was at a step(s) in preinitiation complex formation. Preincubation of fraction DE-B with ATP before exposure to this antibiotic prevented inhibition of rDNA transcription. Since novobiocin has been shown to inhibit RNA polymerases II- and III-directed transcription of linear DNAs by interfering with a step(s) in the initiation reaction, these data suggest that initiation of transcription of all classes of RNA is inhibited by novobiocin by a mechanism independent of its effect on DNA topoisomerase II."
https://openalex.org/W1585567362,"The pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase from Propionibacterium freudenreichii is rapidly inactivated by low concentrations of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP). The inactivation is first order with respect to PLP and the rate increases linearly with PLP concentrations suggesting that over the concentration range used no significant E-PLP complex accumulates during inactivation. The rate of inactivation decreases at high and low pH and this is discussed in terms of the mechanism of Schiff base formation. The presence of any reactants decreases the rate of inactivation to 0 at infinite concentration. This protection against inactivation has been used to obtain the pH dependence of the dissociation constants of all enzyme-reactant binary complexes. Reduction of the PLP-inactivated enzyme with NaB[3H]4 indicates that about 7 lysines are modified in free enzyme and fructose 6-phosphate protects 2 of these from modification. The pH dependence of the enzyme-reactant dissociation constants suggests that the phosphates of fructose 6-phosphate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, inorganic phosphate, and Mg-pyrophosphate must be completely ionized and that lysines are present in the vicinity of the 1- and 6-phosphates of the sugar phosphate and bisphosphate probably directly coordinated to these phosphates."
https://openalex.org/W132886757,"Abstract The carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin is activated in the presence of ATP to enter the ubiquitin cycle in cells. Peptides corresponding to the COOH-terminal region of ubiquitin were synthesized to investigate their effects on the ATP/ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway. Their activities in the PPi exchange assay with ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1) were proportional to their length. The hexapeptide Ac-Leu-Arg-Leu-Arg-Gly-Gly reacted with ATP to form an enzyme-adenylate-hexapeptide complex and at high concentrations was 20-25% as active as human ubiquitin in the PPi exchange assay with E1. However, the hexapeptide was not transferred to the sulfhydryl thiol site on E1. In addition, the COOH-terminal peptides did not support the degradation of 125I-bovine serum albumin in the reticulocyte lysate system. A nonhomologous peptide of equivalent length was inactive in all assays. Thus, synthetic COOH-terminal peptide(s) of ubiquitin can partially substitute for ubiquitin in its reactions with E1 but do not support subsequent steps of the energy-dependent proteolytic pathway. These results show that it may be possible to design small molecules that either serve as substrates or inhibitors for other specific steps in ubiquitin-dependent pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1531246996,"Heterobifunctional cross-linking reagents have been introduced into the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase as potential probes for identifying specific points of contact between the catalytic (C)-subunit and the type II regulatory (RII) subunit in the holoenzyme complex. Since at least one of the 2 cysteine residues in the C-subunit is known to be in close proximity to the interaction site between the C-subunit and the RII-subunit, these cysteines were chosen initially as targets for covalent modification by two heterobifunctional cross-linking reagents, p-azidophenacyl bromide and N-4-(azidophenylthio)phthalimide. Treatment of the C-subunit with each reagent led to the stoichiometric modification of Cys-199 and Cys-343. In each case, the modified C-subunit was still capable of forming a stable complex with the RII-subunit. Both modified C-subunits also could be covalently cross-linked to the RII-subunit; however, the mechanisms for cross-linking differed. Catalytic subunit modified by p-azidophenacyl bromide was cross-linked to the RII-subunit in a photodependent manner by a mechanism that was maximal when holoenzyme was formed and cAMP was absent. In contrast, the C-subunit modified by N-4-(azidophenylthio)phthalimide was cross-linked to the RII-subunit by a mechanism that was independent of photolysis. In this case, cross-linking was enhanced by the presence of cAMP. This cross-linking was the result of a disulfide interchange between a modified cysteine in the C-subunit and an unmodified cysteine in the RII-subunit."
