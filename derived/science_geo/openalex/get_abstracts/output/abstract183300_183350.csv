We have examined the effects of ischemia (30 min) and ischemia followed by reperfusion (15 min) of rat hearts on the activity of complex III and on the cardiolipin content in isolated mitochondria. Mitochondrial production of H2O2 and lipid peroxidation was also measured. The capacity of mitochondria to produce both H2O2 and lipid peroxidation increased upon reperfusion. The activity of complex III was 22% and 46% lower in ischemic and reperfused rat heart mitochondria, respectively, than that of controls. These changes in complex III activity were associated to parallel changes in state 3 respiration. The mitochondrial content of cardiolipin, which is required for optimal activity of complex III, decreased by 28% and by 50% as a function of ischemia and reperfusion, respectively. The lower complex III activity in mitochondria from reperfused rat hearts could be completely restored to the level of normal hearts by exogenously added cardiolipin. It is proposed that the loss of complex III activity in reperfused rat hearts can be mainly ascribed to a loss of cardiolipin content, due to oxidative attack by oxygen free radicals."

However, their molecular mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. Here we report a novel mechanism that underlies the PPAR-γ agonist-mediated suppression of brain inflammation. We show that 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) and rosiglitazone reduce the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 as well as Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and JAK2 in activated astrocytes and microglia. The PPAR-γ agonist-mediated reduction in phosphorylation leads to the suppression of JAK-STAT-dependent inflammatory responses. The effects of 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone are not mediated by activation of PPAR-γ. 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone rapidly induce the transcription of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 1 and 3, which in turn inhibit JAK activity in activated glial cells. In addition, Src homology 2 domain-containing protein phosphatase 2 (SHP2), another negative regulator of JAK activity, is also involved in their anti-inflammatory action. Our data suggest that 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone suppress the initiation of JAK-STAT inflammatory signaling independently of PPAR-γ, thus attenuating brain inflammation.

They are rapidly activated in response to pathological stimuli and lead to various inflammatory processes. Upon activation, astrocytes and microglia change their immunophenotype as well as the expression pattern of inflammatory mediators including cytokines, chemokines, and neurotoxic substances at the transcriptional level (1Stroll G. Jander S. Schroeter M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1998; 56: 149-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 2Xiao B.G. Link H.

Although transient activation is beneficial for defense processes, either chronic activation or overactivation may lead to or exacerbate neuronal diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, ischemia, and human immunodeficiency virus encephalitis (3Kreutzberg G.W. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 312-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3687) Google Scholar). Inflammatory mediators are involved in many effects of activated glial cells. Whereas cytokines such as interleukin-10 reduce glial cytotoxicity (4Balasingam V. Yong V.W. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2945-2955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), other cytokines such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ)1 cause activation of glial cells (5Yong V.W. Moumdjian R. Yong F.P. Ruijs T.C. Freedman M.S. Cashman N. Antel J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7016-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), eventually leading to neuronal injury via inflammatory cascade. The JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription) cascade is an essential inflammatory signaling pathway that mediates immune responses. Specific subtypes of JAK and STAT are activated by different signals and transduce signals from cell surface receptors to different subsets of target genes, many of which are involved in immune responses (6Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar, 7Darnell J. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar). To prevent detrimental effects, the intensity and duration of JAK-STAT activation are tightly regulated. Recently, a family of proteins called suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) has been isolated (8Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S.

Generally, SOCS are present in cells at very low levels but are rapidly transcribed after exposure of cells to stimulus. SOCS can negatively regulate the response of immune cells either by inhibiting JAK activity or by competing with signaling molecules for binding to the phosphorylated receptor (11Hilton D.J. Richardson R.T. Alexander W.S. Viney E.M. Willson T.A. Sprigg N.S. Starr R. Nicholson S.E. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). For example, SOCS1 and SOCS3 bind to the JAKs and inhibit their tyrosine kinase activity (12Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H.

The ability of SOCS to suppress cytokine signaling in vivo has been confirmed by animal models including knock-out mice (13Suzuki A. Hanada T. Mitsuyama K. Yoshida T. Kamizono S. Hoshino T. Kubo M.

SOCS family is now considered as important regulators of normal immune physiology and immune disease (15Alexander W.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ is a ligand-dependent nuclear receptor whose ligands include several prostanoids including 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2(15d-PGJ2) (16Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2701) Google Scholar) and antidiabetic thiazolidinediones such as rosiglitazone (17Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O.

Although PPAR-γ was originally shown to play a key role in adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism (18Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar), some PPAR-γ ligands have recently been reported to exert anti-inflammatory actions by reducing inflammation-associated molecules such as cytokines and nitric oxides (19Ricote M.

However, the precise mechanisms of action underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of PPAR-γ agonists are poorly understood. Here we provide new insights into the anti-inflammatory actions of 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone based on their effects on JAK-STAT inflammatory signaling. We found that there is a PPAR-γ-independent link between the anti-inflammatory action of 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone and the induction of SOCS1 and SOCS3. Our findings suggest not only a novel molecular explanation for the therapeutic efficacy of PPAR-γ agonists but also a new potential therapeutic intervention for inflammatory diseases. Lipopolysaccharide was purchased from Sigma, and IFN-γ was from Calbiochem. 15d-PGJ2 was purchased from Biomol (Butler Pike, PA). Rosiglitazone was a kind gift from Dr. K. S. Park (Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea). Antibodies against STAT1, Tyr-701-phosphorylated STAT1, and Tyr-705-phosphorylated STAT3 were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against phosphorylated JAK1 and JAK2 were from Affinity Bioreagents (Denver, CO). Primary astrocytes and microglia were cultured from the cerebral cortices of 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. The cortices were triturated into single cells in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated for 2–3 weeks. Microglia were detached from the flasks, and the cells remaining in the flask were harvested with 0.1% trypsin to prepare pure astrocytes. BV2 murine microglia cells were obtained from Dr. E. J. Choi and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 5% fetal bovine serum. Total RNA was isolated using RNAzol B (TEL-TEST, Inc., Friendswood, TX), and cDNA was prepared using AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI). The sequences of PCR primers were as follows and as previously described (25Kim O.S. Park E.J. Joe E. Jou I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40594-40601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar): reverse 5′-ACACTCACTTCCGCACCTTC-3′ and forward 5′-AGCAGCTCGAAAAGGCAGTC-3′ for SOCS1; reverse 5′-GTGGAGCATCATACTGATCC-3′ and forward 5′-ACCAGCGCCACTTCTTCACG-3′ for SOCS3; and reverse 5′-ATGGAAGACCACTCGCATT-3′ and forward 5′-CATGGACACCATACTTGAG-3′ for PPAR-γ. For transcript quantification purposes, the LightCyclerTM system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used. The mRNA levels were determined using LightCycler-RNA Master SYBR Green1 or LightCycler-DNA Master SYBR Green1. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase housekeeping gene set (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used as external standards, and the variability in the initial quantities of cDNA was normalized to the internal control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Negative control was included in each set of experiments. Melting curve analysis was performed to enhance specificity of amplification reaction, and the LightCycler software, version 3.5, was used to compare amplification in the experimental samples during the log-linear phase to the standard curve. Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with primary antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and then visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Promega). For Western blot analysis and RT-PCR, cells were serum-starved at least 24 h before drug treatment. Transient transfections were performed in duplicate on 35-mm dishes using LipofectAMINE Plus reagents (Invitrogen). To normalize the variations in cell number and transfection efficiency, all of the cells were co-transfected with pCMV-β-galactisodase. Cell extracts were prepared by using modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm NaVO4). 500 μg lysates were incubated with 1 μg of SHP2 (Transduction Laboratories) at 4 °C for overnight and precipitated with protein G-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Western blot analysis was performed with either 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology) or SHP2. To better define the mechanism of action by which PPAR-γ agonists suppress inflammation, we examined the effects of 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone on JAK-STAT inflammatory signaling in rat brain. Pretreatment of 15d-PGJ2 or rosiglitazone for 2 h markedly suppressed the IFN-γ-stimulated phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 in rat primary astrocytes (Fig.1a). At all of the time points tested from 2 min to 2 h after IFN-γ treatment, phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 was strongly reduced by treatment with either of the PPAR-γ agonists (data not shown). We then investigated whether PPAR-γ agonists affected the activation of JAK1 and JAK2, because phosphorylation of STATs mainly depends on the activation of JAKs (26Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK2 by IFN-γ were reduced in the presence of PPAR-γ agonists (Fig.1b). We obtained similar results with another activator of brain inflammation, lipopolysaccharide. Stimulation with lipopolysaccharide resulted in phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3, but this was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with PPAR-γ agonists (Fig. 1c). Similar effects were observed in primary microglia and C6 astroglioma cells (data not shown). These results show that 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone can inhibit the activation of JAK-STAT signaling by reducing their phosphorylation. We further investigated the events downstream of STAT activation to evaluate the functional importance of the reduction in phosphorylation by 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone. First, we examined the γ-interferon-activated sequence (GAS) promoter activity in primary astrocytes, because activated STAT dimers bind to GAS elements. Transient transfection analysis showed that PPAR-γ agonists significantly reduced the IFN-γ responsiveness of the GAS promoter (Fig. 2a). We then examined the mRNA level of genes whose promoters have binding sites for STATs and act as mediators of inflammation, namely monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (27Zhou Z.H. Chaturvedi P. Han Y.L. Aras S. Li Y.S. Kolattukudy P.E. Ping D. Boss J.M. Ransohoff R.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3908-3916PubMed Google Scholar) and interferon-inducible protein-10 (28Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6677-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IFN-γ rapidly induced the transcription of both genes, but this induction was inhibited by pretreatment with 15d-PGJ2 or rosiglitazone (Fig. 2b). Similar patterns of transcriptional repression were observed for pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β (Fig. 2c). We further tested the effects of PPAR-γ agonists at the level of protein expression. As expected, PPAR-γ agonists suppressed the IFN-γ-stimulated induction of interferon regulatory factor-1 protein, which is a regulator of host defense and has binding sites for STAT in its promoter (Fig. 2d) (29Taniguchi T. Ogasawara K. Takaoka A. Tanaka N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 623-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). These observations convincingly demonstrate that PPAR-γ agonists can exert inhibitory actions on JAK-STAT inflammatory signaling, thus regulating brain inflammation. An important question raised by the above findings is how PPAR-γ agonists influence JAK-STAT signaling. To address this question, we examined whether PPAR-γ mediates the inhibitory action of its agonists on JAK-STAT signaling. First, we determined the existence of PPAR-γ in rat primary astrocytes and microglia. Even in unstimulated cells, PPAR-γ transcripts could be detected (Fig.3a and data not shown). We then compared the inhibitory effects of PPAR-γ agonists on JAK-STAT signaling between cells transiently transfected with PPAR-γ and vector. Interestingly, we did not observe any differences of GAS-luciferase activity in cells with PPAR-γ compared with cells with vector (Fig. 3b). Different concentrations either of PPAR-γ constructs or of drugs also did not affect the GAS activity (data not shown). In contrast, a significant activation of PPAR-γ-responsive element (PPRE)-luciferase was observed in the same experimental conditions (Fig. 3b). Thus, overexpression of PPAR-γ did not lessen GAS activity but enhanced PPRE activity, indicating that PPAR-γ agonists act independently of PPAR-γ activation in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Overexpression of PPAR-γ consistently failed to improve the inhibitory effects of PPAR-γ agonists on JAK-STAT phosphorylation. In cells transiently transfected with vector, PPAR-γ, or PPAR-γ, S112A (a PPAR-γ active mutant) (30Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar), PPAR-γ agonists exerted equivalent effects on the phosphorylation of STATs (Fig. 3c). To further confirm this effect, we examined the effects of PPAR-γ agonists in murine BV2 microglial cells that are reported to lack PPAR-γ or express it at very low levels (31Petrova T.V. Akama K.T. Eldik L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4668-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We could not detect the PPAR-γ transcripts in BV2 cells, but we did observe an inhibitory effect of PPAR-γ agonists on STAT phosphorylation (Fig.4a). Furthermore, PPAR-γ agonists reduced the transcription of not only IFN-γ-responsive genes but also inflammation-associated genes in BV2 cells (Fig. 4,b and c). Thus, we conclude that the inhibitory actions of 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone on JAK-STAT signaling occur independently of PPAR-γ activation in brain.Figure 4PPAR-γ is not required for the anti-inflammatory actions of its agonists.a, BV2 cells were pretreated with rosiglitazone (20 μm) for 2 h and stimulated with IFN-γ (10 units ml−1) for 5 min.

We considered the possibility that SOCS1 and SOCS3 could be involved in these events because they have been identified as negative regulators of JAK activation and as key regulators in the immune system (15Alexander W.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that 15d-PGJ2and rosiglitazone rapidly induced the transcription of SOCS1 as well as SOCS3 in primary astrocytes and BV2 cells. Within 1–2 h after treatment of either 15d-PGJ2 or rosiglitazone, the transcript levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 were significantly elevated in a dose-dependent fashion (Figs. 5 and 6). In agreement with JAK-STAT signaling events, overexpression of PPAR-γS112A failed to increase the ability of PPAR-γ agonists to induce SOCS1 and SOCS3 (Fig. 6d), indicating that elevation of SOCS transcripts occurs independently of PPAR-γ. To confirm the functional role of SOCS in brain inflammatory responses, we tested whether overexpression of SOCS1 or SOCS3 attenuated the phosphorylation of STATs in primary astrocytes. Levels of phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT3 were considerably attenuated in primary astrocytes transiently transfected with either SOCS1 or SOCS3 compared with vector (Fig. 6e). These results suggest that SOCS1 and SOCS3 may mediate the anti-inflammatory action of 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone.Figure 6Effects of 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone on expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3.a–c, primary astrocytes (a and c) and BV2 (b) cells were treated with IFN-γ (10 units ml−1), 15d-PGJ2 (15d) (10 μm), or rosiglitazone (20 μm) as indicated. RT-PCR analysis was performed using SOCS1 primers (a andb) and SOCS3 primers (c), and the products were analyzed on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel. d, primary astrocytes were transiently transfected with pSV or PPAR-γS112A, and the cells were treated with IFN-γ or 15d-PGJ2 for 2 h.

Thus, we further examined the mechanism explaining the rapid inhibition of JAK-STAT activation following treatment with 15d-PGJ2 or rosiglitazone. Because SHP has been known to be an important negative regulator of JAK-STAT signaling, we investigated the involvement of SHP in anti-inflammatory action of 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone. Interestingly, we observed that SHP2 was phosphorylated within 5 min after treatment of 15d-PGJ2 (Fig.7). The activity of SHP2 has been reported to correlate with its phosphorylation, and the phosphorylated SHP2 can catalyze the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAKs, receptor, or other cellular proteins (32Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). In this regard, the activation of SHP2 may be part of a mechanism involved in inhibitory action of 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone. Some PPAR-γ agonists have been reported to effectively suppress inflammation and are thus promising potential therapeutic agents for chronic inflammatory diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (33Combs C.K. Johnson D.E. Karlo J.C. Cannady S.B. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 558-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recentin vivo studies provide evidence for the therapeutic potential of PPAR-γ agonists in various inflammatory diseases (22Diab A. Deng C. Smith J.D. Hussain R.Z. Phanavanh B. Lovett-Racke A.E.

Most of the information on the mechanism of action of PPAR-γ agonists is based on studies of NFκB activity. PPAR-γ agonists have been shown to inhibit multiple steps in the NFκB signaling pathway through covalent modifications of IκB kinase (31Petrova T.V. Akama K.T. Eldik L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3227) Google Scholar, 21Chawla A. Barak Y. Nagy L. Liao D. Tontonoz P. Evans R.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). In this paper, we suggest a novel pathway underlying the anti-inflammatory action of PPAR-γ agonists in activated glial cells based on the JAK-STAT signaling in inflammatory response. The possible involvement of STAT in the anti-inflammatory action of PPAR-γ agonists had been previously proposed (19Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3227) Google Scholar), but evidence to directly support this hypothesis was lacking. Here, we show that 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone can act at two points: first by rapidly attenuating JAK phosphorylation followed by later modulation of JAK-STAT inflammatory signaling in brain (Figs. 1 and 2). Recent reports indicate that JAKs and STATs play important roles in many diverse cellular events in brain (37Cattaneo E. Conti L. De-Fraja C. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 365-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 38Xuan Y.-T. Guo Y. Han H. Zhu Y. Bolli R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Matsumoto Y. J. Neuroimmunol. 2001; 114: 40-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is interesting to note that PPAR-γ agonists can inhibit the activity of JAK and STAT, which may provide an explanation for previous reports of the beneficial actions of PPAR-γ agonists in the treatment of neuronal diseases (33Combs C.K. Johnson D.E. Karlo J.C. Cannady S.B. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 558-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the anti-inflammatory action of PPAR-γ agonists, PPAR-γ has received much attention as a target for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs (24Murphy G.J. Holder J.C. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 21: 469-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (358) Google Scholar). However, whether the anti-inflammatory effects of PPAR-γ agonists are PPAR-γ-dependent or independent is controversial (19Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3227) Google Scholar, 21Chawla A. Barak Y. Nagy L. Liao D. Tontonoz P. Evans R.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar, 31Petrova T.V. Akama K.T. Eldik L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4668-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated the involvement of PPAR-γ in the inhibition of JAK-STAT phosphorylation by its agonists. In all of the signaling events that we tested, PPAR-γ agonists appeared to act independently of PPAR-γ activation. Previously, other researchers reported that PPAR-γ agonists could reduce inflammation independently of PPAR-γ via direct modulation of NFκB activity (36Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar, 37Cattaneo E. Conti L. De-Fraja C. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 365-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Consistent with these works, our present data indicate that PPAR-γ agonists also act in JAK-STAT inflammatory signaling independently of PPAR-γ These observations support the recent proposal by Chawla et al. (21Chawla A. Barak Y. Nagy L. Liao D. Tontonoz P. Evans R.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar) that PPAR-γ is required for lipid metabolism but not for anti-inflammatory effects. How then might PPAR-γ agonists act independently of PPAR-γ? Interestingly, we found that PPAR-γ agonists rapidly induced the transcription of SOCS1 and SOCS3, key physiological regulators of immune responses and therapeutic targets for human immune diseases (15Alexander W.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). One consequence of SOCS induction is the inhibition of JAK activation, thus reducing inflammatory signaling. We also found that overexpression of either SOCS1 or SOCS3 led to suppression of STAT phosphorylation in primary astrocytes (Fig. 6e). Recently, Wesemann et al. (41Wesemann D.R. Dong Y. O'Keefe G.M. Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2354-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) report that overexpression of SOCS1 inhibits CD40 expression by blocking STAT1 activation in macrophage, resulting in the suppression of IFN-γ-induced tumor necrosis factor-α secretion and subsequent activation of NFκB. Thus, it is possible that SOCS induction could suppress NFκB activity in addition to JAK-STAT activity. There have been several reports regarding the beneficial actions of SOCS in the treatment of immune diseases such as hematological malignancies (42Frantsve J. Schwaller J. Sternberg D.W. Kutok J. Gilliland D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3547-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), inflammatory arthritis (14Shouda T. Yoshida T. Hanada T. Wakioka T. Oishi M. Miyoshi K. Komiya S. Kosai K. Hanakawa Y. Hashimoto K. Nagata K. Yoshimura A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 108: 1781-1788Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar), and infectious disease (43Dalpke A.H. Opper S. Zimmermann S. Heeg K. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7082-7089Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The results we report here further support the therapeutic role of SOCS. It is interesting that 15d-PGJ2and rosiglitazone are potent inducers of SOCS expression, because the only SOCS-inducing agents known previously were cytokines and growth factors (15Alexander W.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). These observations lead to the question of how expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 might be induced by 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone. Although SOCS are negative feedback regulators that are rapidly transcribed in a STAT-dependent manner (15Alexander W.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), we could not observe the phosphorylation of JAKs and STATs by treatment of PPAR-γ agonists alone for 5 min to 2 h (Fig.8 and data not shown), indicating that other pathways are responsible for their induction. Preliminary data from our laboratory suggest a role for protein kinases A and C in the induction of SOCS1 and SOCS3 by PPAR-γ agonists. 2E. J. Park, S. Y. Park, E.-h. Joe, and I. Jou, unpublished observations. It has been previously reported that the promoter of SOCS1 and SOCS3 contain cAMP binding sites and that either cAMP (44Bousquet C. Chesnokova V. Kariagina A. Ferrand A. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1880-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (45Terstegen L. Gatsios P. Bode J.G. Schaper F. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18810-18817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) can stimulate the transcription of SOCS3. Thus, it is conceivable that certain protein kinases may mediate the induction of SOCS, but additional studies are needed to evaluate this possibility. Here we suggest the interesting note that there is a PPAR-γ-independent link between anti-inflammatory action of PPAR-γ agonists and induction of SOCS. In addition to SOCS1 and SOCS3, SHP2, another negative regulator of JAK-STAT signaling, seems to be also involved in anti-inflammatory action of 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone. As shown in Fig. 7, SHP2 was phosphorylated upon treatment of 15d-PGJ2. The phosphatase activity of SHPs has been reported to depend primarily on their phosphorylation and interaction with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins such as JAKs, receptor, and other cellular proteins (32Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). This observation is in agreement with our recent data obtained from other experiments. We recently revealed that the activation of SHPs may be closely related with attenuation of brain inflammation in activated microglia, 3H. Y. Kim, E. J. Park, E.-h. Joe, and I. Jou, submitted for publication. which supports that SHP2 as well as SOCS1 and SOCS3 may be involved in the inflammatory action of 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone. Although work on the contribution of SOCS to human immune diseases is still in its infancy, some studies suggest that the enforced expression of SOCS might be beneficial for the treatment of some immune diseases. Thus, our results provide a strong foundation for the future development of therapeutic drugs for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. We thank Dr. J. B. Kim of Seoul National University for providing PPAR-γ constructs and many helpful discussions. We also thank Dr. Y. J.

Together with Hsp70 and other accessory proteins, Hsp90 not only helps newly synthesized proteins to fold but also regulates activities of transcription factors and protein kinases. Although the gene coding for heat shock protein 90 fromPlasmodium falciparum (PfHsp90) has been characterized previously, there is very little known regarding its function in the parasite. We have analyzed PfHsp90 complexes and addressed its role in parasite life cycle using Geldanamycin (GA), a drug known to interfere with Hsp90 function. Sedimentation analysis and size exclusion chromatography showed PfHsp90 to be in 11s20,w complexes of ∼300 kDa in size. Similar to the hetero-oligomeric complexes of Hsp90 in mammals, PfHsp70 was found to be present in PfHsp90 complexes. Homology modeling revealed a putative GA-binding pocket at the amino terminus of PfHsp90. The addition of GA inhibited parasite growth with LD50 of 0.2 μm. GA inhibited parasite growth by arresting transition from Ring to trophozoite. Transition from trophozoite to schizonts and reinvasion of new erythrocytes were less significantly affected. While inducing the synthesis of PfHsp70 and PfHsp90, GA did not significantly alter the pattern of newly synthesized proteins. Pre-exposure to heat shock attenuated GA-mediated growth inhibition, suggesting the involvement of heat shock proteins. Specificity of GA action on PfHsp90 was evident from selective inhibition of PfHsp90 phosphorylation in GA-treated cultures.

During its asexual life cycle in human erythrocytes, the parasite progresses through three growth phases (1Bannister L.H. Hopkins J.M. Fowler R.E. Krishna S. Mitchell G.H. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 6: 427-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The early form following invasion called the Ring stage is the phase of establishment in the erythrocyte. Trophozoite stage is the metabolically most active biosynthetic phase, whereas the schizont stage represents the phase of nuclear division before release of merozoites from the erythrocyte. Heat shock proteins of the class Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 are known to be expressed by the parasite during the intraerythrocytic stages in the vertebrate host (2Das A. Syin C. Fujioka H. Zheng H. Goldman N. Aikawa M. Kumar N. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 88: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 3Kumar N. Koski G. Harada M. Aikawa M. Zheng H. Mol. Biochem.

Although these heat shock proteins share significant homologies with their mammalian counterparts, there is very limited information available regarding their functional roles in parasite development. We have focused our study on the role of parasite-heat shock protein 90 expressed during erythrocytic cycle in humans. Previous reports have shown that the gene coding for Hsp90 fromP. falciparum is present on chromosome 7, has a single intron of 800 bp, and encodes protein with 745 amino acids, giving a molecular mass of 86 kDa (5Su Q. Wellems T.E. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 6Bonnefoy S. Attal G. Langsley G. Tekaia F. Puijalon O.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 67: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison shows 59% identity and 69% similarity to human Hsp90. There is significant similarity at the NH2-terminal nucleotide-binding domain in the central acidic hinge region as well as at the COOH-terminal substrate-binding domain. The presence of EEVD motif at the COOH terminus suggests cytosolic localization of heat shock protein 90 fromP. falciparum(PfHsp90)1 (7Buchberger A. Bakau B. Gething M.J. Guidebook to Molecular Chaperones and Protein-folding Catalysts. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1997: 147Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, cytosolic Hsp90 is a highly abundant protein organized in the form of a multi-chaperone complex. Two obvious roles have been ascribed to Hsp90. 1) Together with Hsp70 and Hsp60, Hsp90 helps newly synthesized proteins to fold and 2) it helps modulate the activities of transcription factors (steroid hormone receptors and nuclear receptors) and protein kinases (8Neckers L. Mimnaugh E. Schulte T.W. Latchman D.S. Stress Proteins: Handbook to Experimental Pharmacology. 136. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1998: 9-32Google Scholar, 9Eggers D.K. Welch W.J. Hansen W.J.

Ther. 1998; 79: 129-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). The latter activity of Hsp90 puts it at the center stage of signal transduction events, crucial for cell survival and growth. Indeed, experiments performed in yeast, fruit fly, plant, and animal systems support the idea that in addition to helping newly synthesized proteins to fold, Hsp90 also regulates cell cycle and development (11Nathan D.F. Vos M.H. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12949-12956Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 12Rutherford S.L. Lindquist S.

In addition to the common approaches of gene disruption in yeast and mutational analysis in Drosophila, a new approach of pharmacologically interfering with Hsp90 function has been described in the literature (14Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 15Schneider C. Lorenzino L. Nimmesgern E. Ouerfelli O.

Nature Genet. 2003; 33: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The approach involves the use of a benzoquinone ansamycin drug called Geldanamycin (GA), which specifically binds to Hsp90 and interferes with its ATP-dependent chaperone function (14Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). The specificity of GA interaction with Hsp90 has been described at the molecular level through the crystal structure of human Hsp90 complexed to GA (17Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). The use of GA in Drosophila and Arabidopsis has provided important insights into the profound involvement of Hsp90 in various cellular functions. We have examined the complexes of PfHsp90 and analyzed its role in parasite growth in human erythrocytes using GA. Using an antibody specific to PfHsp90 and by employing sucrose gradient sedimentation as well as gel filtration chromatography, we have characterized the complexes of PfHsp90 in the parasite cytoplasm. In addition to demonstrating its presence in a complex similar in size to mammalian Hsp90, we also show PfHsp70 to be a part of the PfHsp90 multi-chaperone complex. Most importantly, we show that GA inhibits parasite growth in human erythrocytes. Modeling the NH2-terminal domain of PfHsp90 based on its high degree of sequence identity to human Hsp90 uncovered a putative GA-binding pocket at its amino terminus. The addition of GA to parasite cultures inhibited parasite growth with an LD50 of 0.2 μm. The involvement of heat shock proteins in GA-mediated growth inhibition was evident from the observation that parasites pre-exposed to heat shock resisted growth inhibitory effects of GA. The specificity of GA action on PfHsp90 was evident from a selective inhibition of PfHsp90 phosphorylation in GA-treated cultures without a significant change in overall protein phosphorylation. Our results show that GA inhibits parasite growth through its interaction with PfHsp90 and suggests an essential role for PfHsp90 in parasite growth in human erythrocytes. Antisera to PfHsp70 and PfHsp90 were generated against the recombinant COOH-terminal fragments of proteins in rabbit (18Banumathy G. Singh V. Tatu U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3902-3912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). DSP was obtained from Pierce. GA, herbimycin A (HA), and apyrase were purchased from Sigma. [35S]Cys- and [35S]Met-labeled trophozoites were cross-linked in vivo using DSP (9Eggers D.K. Welch W.J. Hansen W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 15559-15573Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cells were hypotonically lysed (18Banumathy G. Singh V. Tatu U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3902-3912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and the lysates were layered onto 5–25% continuous sucrose gradient. The gradient was spun at 40,000 rpm for 15 h at 4 °C in SW41 rotor. 500-μl fractions were immunoprecipitated with PfHsp90 antiserum and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. For gel filtration analysis, saponin-released parasites (18Banumathy G. Singh V. Tatu U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3902-3912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) were sonicated briefly in phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors on ice. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × gfor 20 min at 4 °C and passed through Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Manually collected fractions (500 μl each) were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and immunoblotted for PfHsp90. Thyroglobulin (669 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (66 kDa) were used as molecular size standards. The peak fraction of PfHsp90 (corresponding to elution volume 10.5 ml) was collected, and protein complexes were cross-linked using DSP (see above). Iodination of cross-linked proteins was carried out using [125I] by chloramine T method (19Hermanson G.T. Bioconjugate Techniques. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 400-405Google Scholar). The iodinated fraction was precleared using protein A-agarose beads and immunoprecipitated using anti-PfHsp90, anti-PfHsp70, or preimmune serum. The immune pellets were solubilized in Laemmli buffer and analyzed as above. Parasites were metabolically labeled with [35S]Cys and Met and lysed in 20 volumes of NETT buffer (150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, and 1% Triton X-100) (18Banumathy G. Singh V. Tatu U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3902-3912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) containing 20 units/ml apyrase, protease inhibitors, and phosphatase inhibitors. This lysate was used for non-denaturing immunoprecipitation (IP). For denaturing IP, cells were directly lysed in Laemmli buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and diluted to 0.1% SDS concentration with NETT buffer. PfHsp70 or PfHsp90 immunoprecipitated from these lysates were solubilized in two-dimensional lysis buffer or Laemmli buffer for analysis. To examine induction of heat shock proteins following GA treatment, cells were treated with Me2SO or 10 μm GA for 14h and metabolically labeled in the last 2 h. Cells were lysed in 2× Laemmli buffer, boiled at 95 °C for 5 min, and diluted with NETT buffer to 0.1% SDS concentration. Clarified lysate was used for immunoprecipitation of PfHsp70 and PfHsp90. Early Ring-infected erythrocytes at 2% hematocrit and with 1–2% parasitemia were treated with Me2SO (as a control) or various concentrations of GA (0.05, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 μm) for 24 h (21Schlichtherle M. Wahlgren M. Perlmann H. Scherf A. Schlichtherle M. Wahlgren M. Perlmann H. Scherf A. Methods in Malaria Research. 3rd ed. Malaria Research and Reference Reagent Resource Center, Manassas, VA2000: 30Google Scholar). At the end of 24 h, [3H]hypoxanthine at 10 μCi/ml was added and incubated for an additional 3 h. At the end of labeling, cells were lysed and DNA was collected in glass fiber filters using a cell harvester and the radioactivity incorporated was measured by liquid scintillation counting. For phosphate labeling of proteins, parasites were cultured in phosphate-free medium supplemented with 0.5% human serum, [32P]- orthophosphoric acid, and 1 mCi/ml medium at 37 °C for 6 h in the absence or presence of GA. Cells were lysed at the end of treatment in Laemmli buffer in presence of 2 mm NaF and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The lysate was treated with DNase and RNase in the presence of protease inhibitors. The lysate was diluted to 0.1% SDS concentration with NETT buffer, which was used for IP or measurement of cpm in a liquid scintillation counter. Amino-terminal sequence of PfHsp90 (1–177 amino acids) was submitted to SWISS MODEL program (www.expasy.ch) to obtain the three-dimensional structure using the crystal structure of amino-terminal human Hsp90 (Protein Data Bank code 1YET) as a template. This model was superimposed over the structure of human Hsp90·GA complex using STAMP (Structure Alignment of Multiple Protein) program (20Russell R.B. Barton G.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 14: 309-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Sorbitol-synchronized Ring-infected cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium to 5% hematocrit. 200-μl cell suspension was treated with Me2SO or with GA in Me2SO at various concentrations for 24 h. Smears were taken at the end of treatment, Giemsa-stained, and viewed under microscope. The same experiment was performed with early trophozoites and also schizonts. To examine the effect of GA and HA on parasitemia, Ring-infected erythrocytes were either treated with Me2SO or with 5 μm drug for 48 h (culture was replenished with medium and GA every 24 h) and parasitemia was calculated. A change in percentage of parasitemia with respect to control was plotted against the duration of drug treatment. To analyze stage-specific expression of PfHsp90, synchronous cultures of infected erythrocytes were harvested at 10 h (Ring), 20 h (early trophozoite), 30 h (late trophozoite), and 40 h (schizont) and lysed in 10 volumes of NETT buffer. The protein content of the lysates was estimated by the Bradford method. Equal protein from the different stages was analyzed for the presence of PfHsp90 by Western blotting. An asynchronous culture of infected erythrocytes at ∼20% parasitemia was given heat shock at 41 °C for 1 h in complete RPMI 1640 medium and then recovered at 37 °C for 2 h. As a control, an equal number of cells were kept at 37 °C for 3 h. Parasitemia was calculated at the end of recovery period in both control and heat-shocked cells following which the cells were treated with either Me2SO alone or 1 μm GA for 24 h. Parasitemia was calculated again at the end of treatment period. Ring stage parasites were treated with Me2SO or 0.5 μm GA for 6 h. Parasites were released using 0.01% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline, and hypotonic lysates were prepared from these parasites. 6 μg of lysate from GA-treated or untreated parasites was used in a kinase assay using 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP with or without 5 μg of dephosphorylated bovine milk casein as substrate in 1× kinase buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μmZnSO4) in the presence of 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 1 mm NaF. The kinase assay was performed at 37 °C for 30 min and terminated by the addition of Laemmli buffer and boiling. Phosphorylation of casein was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Synchronous Ring-infected erythrocytes were treated with 10 μm GA for 16 h at 37 °C followed by the addition of [35S]Cys and Met at 100 μCi/ml for 3 h. As a control, Ring stage parasites (normal Rings) were labeled with [35S]Met at 100 μCi/ml for 3 h. The cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and parasites were released by saponin lysis. Parasites were sonicated in 50 volumes of 20 mm Tris buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitors. Lysates containing equal cpm were acetone-precipitated, solubilized in two-dimensional lysis buffer, and analyzed on a pH 3.5–9.5 tube gel in the first dimension and 7.5% SDS-PAGE in the second dimension followed by fluorography. Mammalian Hsp90 is known to be organized in a 11 s20,w hetero-oligomeric complex consisting of Hsp70 and other accessory co-chaperones. To examine whether PfHsp90 is organized in a complex similar to that of mammalian Hsp90, we employed techniques of sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatography. Synchronous cultures of P. falciparum were metabolically labeled with radiolabeled amino acids for 24 h, and the lysates were subjected to centrifugation on sucrose gradients as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fractions collected after run were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to PfHsp90 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. As shown in Fig. 1A (top panel), PfHsp90 was found in complexes ranging in size from 4.5 to 9 s20,w, indicative of heterogeneous populations ranging from monomeric forms to complexes as high as 150 kDa in size. To examine whether our lysis protocol was disrupting complexes of PfHsp90 in the cell, we used an approach of in vivo cross-linking to freeze complexes of PfHsp90 before preparing parasite lysates. We used DSP, which is a membrane-permeable, reversible cross-linker to cross-link PfHsp90 complexes. As seen in Fig. 1A, upon cross-linking (+DSP), PfHsp90 was found in complexes ranging from 5 s20,w to as high as 11 s20,w, corresponding to approximately 300 kDa in size. Fig. 1A, bottom panel, shows quantitation of these results. We also employed size exclusion chromatography using HPLC to analyze PfHsp90 complexes. Lysates were prepared from synchronous cultures of the parasite as described under “Materials and Methods” and analyzed on a gel filtration column Superdex 200 interfaced to HPLC. Fractions were collected up to a one-bed volume of the column and analyzed for the presence of PfHsp90 and PfHsp70 by trichloroacetic acid precipitation of fractions and Western blotting using specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1B (top panel), PfHsp90 eluted as a single peak at a volume of 10–11 ml. A comparison with the elution volumes of standards indicated that the complex corresponded to ∼300 kDa in size. This was in agreement with the 11s20,w complexes observed on sucrose gradient analysis of cross-linked samples. On the other hand, PfHsp70 was found to elute at a volume of 10.5–13.5 ml, ranging in size from monomeric forms to complexes as high as 300 kDa (bottom panel). Quantitation of this profile is presented in thebottom panel of Fig. 1B. To analyze the composition of the 300-kDa complex seen on HPLC, we iodinated the peak fractions corresponding to elution volumes 10–10.5 ml after cross-linking and immunoprecipitated the labeled complex using antibodies to PfHsp90 and PfHsp70. An equal volume of the labeled fraction was also incubated with protein A beads and pre-immune serum to ascertain the specificity of immunoprecipitation. Fig. 1Cshows an analysis of the immunoprecipitate by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. As expected, a clear band corresponding to PfHsp90 (lane 2) was visible on SDS-PAGE, which was absent in the control (lane 1). In addition to PfHsp90, three other bands corresponding in size to ∼75-, 60-, and 50-kDa proteins were also seen in PfHsp90 immunoprecipitate. To examine whether the 75-kDa protein was PfHsp70, an equal volume of iodinated fraction was immunoprecipitated using antibodies to PfHsp70. As shown in Fig.1C (lane 3) in addition to a signal corresponding to PfHsp70, we also found a signal for PfHsp90. The result indicated that PfHsp70 was included in the 300-kDa complex of PfHsp90 in the parasite cytoplasm. To further examine possible interactions between PfHsp70 and PfHsp90, we used a more direct approach of co-immunoprecipitation from labeled parasite lysates. Synchronous cultures of P. falciparum were metabolically labeled for 2 h with radiolabeled amino acids and lysed with detergent containing buffer in the presence of apyrase as described under “Materials and Methods.” Apyrase was included in the lysis buffer to stabilize possible association of PfHsp70 and PfHsp90 (9Eggers D.K. Welch W.J. Hansen W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 15559-15573Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The lysates were divided into three equal aliquots. One aliquot was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to PfHsp90. The second aliquot was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to PfHsp70; whereas the third aliquot was incubated with preimmune serum alone to serve as a control. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography as described under “Materials and Methods.” As seen in Fig. 2A, in samples immunoprecipitated with antibodies to PfHsp70 (lane 2), we could detect a band corresponding to itself but, in addition, a band corresponding in size to PfHsp90 was also evident. Similarly, in sample immunoprecipitated with antibodies to PfHsp90, we could find a band corresponding to PfHsp70 in addition to itself (lane 3). Preimmune serum control (lanes 1 and 4) did not show any specific signal. Immunoprecipitation done under denaturing conditions for Pfhsp70 and PfHsp90 pulled down only the respective proteins (lanes 5 and 6). To ascertain that the co-precipitating bands indeed correspond to PfHsp70 and PfHsp90, we also analyzed the immunoprecipitates by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. We have previously defined the positions of PfHsp70 and PfHsp90 spots on two-dimensional gels (18Banumathy G. Singh V. Tatu U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3902-3912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, in PfHsp70 immunoprecipitates, we found a spot of PfHsp70 (arrowhead). In PfHsp90 immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2C) in addition to a spot corresponding to PfHsp90 (arrow) at a position expected from its size (90 kDa) and pI (4.8), we also found a distinct 75-kDa spot (arrowhead) corresponding in size (74.3 kDa) and pI (5.4) to PfHsp70. The preimmune serum control on the other hand did not show the presence of either of these spots on two-dimensional gels (data not shown). When a small aliquot of PfHsp90 IP (apyrase) was mixed with denaturing PfHsp70 IP (which pulls down only PfHsp70 as shown in Fig. 2A,lane 5), there was an increase in the intensity of the 75-kDa spot (compare PfHsp90:PfHsp70 ratios between panels Cand D) showing that PfHsp70 is co-precipitated with PfHsp90 under non-denaturing conditions. The results confirmed that PfHsp90 and PfHsp70 were present in a common complex. GA, a benzoquinone ansamycin drug with antitumor properties, is known to specifically bind the amino-terminal domain of human Hsp90. The structure of the complex of human Hsp90 with GA has shown that the drug interacts with the amino-terminal ATP-binding domain of Hsp90 (17Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). To examine the presence of putative GA binding site in PfHsp90, we aligned sequences corresponding to the amino-terminal GA-binding domain of human Hsp90 with PfHsp90 (see Fig.3A). The amino-terminal domain of PfHsp90 shows 69% identity with human Hsp90 and contains a GXXGXG motif essential for ATP binding. The contact-making residues, critical in the binding to GA, were conserved in PfHsp90 (indicated by asterisk). Based on the high degree of sequence similarity between human Hsp90 and PfHsp90 in this region, we modeled the structure of the PfHsp90. We used the structure of human Hsp90 in complex with GA as a template for this purpose (Protein Data Bank code 1YET). Modeling the amino-terminal domain of PfHsp90 (residues 3–177) indicated that the overall fold in this region was highly similar to that in human Hsp90 (Fig.3B). The contact-making residues, namely Lys-58, Asp-93, Gly-97, Lys-112, Phe-138, and Gly-183, were similarly positioned in PfHsp90 (Fig. 3C). The structures could be superimposed with a root mean square deviation of 0.07. The analysis indicated that GA is likely to interact with PfHsp90 in a manner similar to its association with human Hsp90. To examine the effect of GA on parasitemia, synchronous Ring stage parasites were treated with 5 μm GA as described under “Materials and Methods” and percentage parasitemia was determined every 12 h until 48 h. We also examined the effect of a closely related benzoquinone ansamycin, HA, on parasite growth. The results were plotted as percentage parasitemia with respect to control versus hours of drug treatment. As shown in Fig.4A, there was a progressive decline in the percentage parasitemia in cultures exposed to 5 μm GA. Although 5 μm HA treatment also resulted in reduction in parasitemia, the effect was less drastic. [3H]Hypoxanthine incorporation in GA-treated cultures (Fig. 4B) confirmed growth inhibitory effects of GA, and the LD50 value was determined to be 0.2 μm. To examine the effect of GA on growth of the parasite, we used highly synchronous cultures of P. falciparum in Ring stage and treated them with different concentrations of GA. At the end of 24 h of GA treatment, smears were taken to determine the stage of the parasite and percent parasitemia. The results were compared, in parallel, with mock-treated Ring stage culture. As expected, in the absence of GA treatment, Ring stage cultures progressed to the trophozoite stage (see Fig. 5A, left panel, arrow). Fig. 5A, middle panel, also shows a smear from culture treated with 10 μm GA. Most of the parasites persisted in the Ring stage (see arrow) even at the end of 24 h in the presence of the drug. In cultures treated with GA at a concentration of 0.5, 1, 5, or 10 μm for 24 h, we found a progressive decline in the number of parasites progressing to the trophozoite stage.Right panel shows the extent of progression from Ring to trophozoite stage at increasing concentrations of GA. A similar experiment was carried out with synchronous cultures in the trophozoite stage progressing to schizont stage in the presence of different concentrations of GA. As shown in Fig. 5B, in the absence of GA treatment (left panel), trophozoite stage culture effectively progressed to schizonts (arrow), but in the presence of GA (middle panel), there was persistence of trophozoites (arrow) even after 24 h. The degree of inhibition in stage progression increased with an increase in GA concentration. Fig. 5B, right panel, shows quantitation of the inhibitory effect of GA on progression from trophozoite to schizont stages. The inhibitory effect of GA was more pronounced for progression from Ring to trophozoite stage than from trophozoite to schizont stage. Importantly, GA did not significantly affect the release of merozoites from schizonts, and their reinvasion to gave rise to new Rings (5C). To examine the levels of PfHsp90 present in different stages of parasite growth, we prepared lysates from equal number of Rings, early trophozoites, late trophozoites, and schizonts and examined equal amounts of protein from different stages by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Fig. 5D, top panel, shows Western blot of PfHsp90 in the Ring (lane 1), early trophozoite (lane 2), late trophozoite (lane 3), and schizont (lane 4) stages, and the quantitation is presented in the bottom panel. The result indicated that PfHsp90 was present in maximal amounts during trophozoite stage. To examine the effect of GA treatment on"

The purpose of the current study was to determine whether the CR-associated increase in life span occurs in all strains of mice or only in some genotypes and whether the effects of CR and ad libitum (AL) feeding on mortality accrue gradually or are rapidly inducible and reversible. In one experiment, groups of male C57BL/6, DBA/2, and B6D2F1 mice were fed AL or CR (60% of AL) diets beginning at 4 months of age until death. In the companion study, separate groups of mice were maintained chronically on AL or CR regimens until 7, 17, or 22-24 months of age, after which, half of each AL and CR group was switched to the opposite regimen for 11 wk. This procedure yielded four experimental groups for each genotype, namely AL-->AL, AL-->CR, CR-->CR, and CR-->AL, designated according to long-term and short-term caloric regimen, respectively. Long-term CR resulted in increased median and maximum life span in C57BL/6 and B6D2F1 mice but failed to affect either parameter in the DBA/2 mice. The shift from AL-->CR increased mortality in 17- and 24-month-old mice, whereas the shift from CR-->AL did not significantly affect mortality of any age group. Such increased risk of mortality following implementation of CR at older ages was evident in all three strains but was most dramatic in DBA/2 mice. Results of this study indicate that CR does not have beneficial effects in all strains of mice, and it increases rather than decreases mortality if initiated in advanced age."

We set out to identify the signal transduction cascade linking EET generation to enhanced proliferation and angiogenesis. In human endothelial cells overexpressing CYP 2C9, cell number was increased compared with control cells and was inhibited by the CYP 2C9 inhibitor, sulfaphenazole. CYP 2C9 overexpression was associated with the activation of Akt and an increase in cyclin D1 expression, effects that were abolished by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor inhibitor, AG1478, which also prevented the CYP 2C9-induced increase in cell proliferation. Stimulation of EGF receptor overexpressing cells with 11,12-EET or transfection of these cells with CYP 2C9 enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor. Endothelial tube formation in a fibrin gel was significantly enhanced (6-fold) in CYP 2C9 overexpressing cells and was comparable with the tube formation induced by EGF. In the chick chorioallantoic membrane, 11,12-EET stimulated vessel formation (3.5-fold) and induced vessel convergence, an effect that was abolished by cotreatment with either an EGF receptor-neutralizing antibody or AG1478. These results indicate that CYP 2C9-derived EETs stimulate angiogenesis by a mechanism involving the activation of the EGF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1976589295,"Transmigration of neutrophils across the endothelium occurs at the cell-cell junctions where the vascular endothelium cadherin (VE cadherin) is expressed.

We propose that neutrophil transmigration across the vascular endothelium goes in parallel with cleavage of VE cadherin by elastase and cathepsin G present on the surface of neutrophils. This hypothesis is supported by the following lines of evidence. 1) Proteolytic fragments of VE cadherin are released into the culture medium upon adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cell monolayers; 2) conditioned culture medium, obtained after neutrophil adhesion to endothelial monolayers, cleaves the recombinantly expressed VE cadherin extracellular domain; 3) these cleavages are inhibited by inhibitors of elastase; 4) VE cadherin fragments produced by conditioned culture medium or by exogenously added elastase are identical as shown by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis; 5) both elastase- and cathepsin G-specific VE cadherin cleavage patterns are produced upon incubation with tumor necrosis factor α-stimulated and fixed neutrophils; 6) transendothelial permeability increases in vitro upon addition of either elastase or cathepsin G; and 7) neutrophil transmigration is reduced in vitro in the presence of elastase and cathepsin G inhibitors.

Our results suggest that cleavage of VE cadherin by neutrophil surface-bound proteases induces formation of gaps through which neutrophils transmigrate. The endothelium constitutes a physical barrier between blood and the underlying tissues and is the point of entry of leukocytes into inflamed tissues. The mechanism of leukocyte entrance into tissues is a complex, multistep event involving leukocyte adhesion to endothelium and subsequent migration across the blood vessel wall (1Worthylake R.A. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Whereas the early steps leading to leukocyte adhesion are well understood (2Dunon D. Piali L. Imhof B.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 714-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 3Johnson-Leger C. Aurrand-Lions M. Imhof B.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 921-933PubMed Google Scholar), it is still unclear how leukocytes crawl through the endothelial wall. Many studies demonstrated that leukocytes exit blood vessels by squeezing between adjacent endothelial cells (4Shaw S.K. Bamba P.S. Perkins B.N. Luscinskas F.W. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2323-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), but a recent study suggested that leukocytes could pass across the body of endothelial cells using a transcellular route (5Feng D.

These ectodomain-based interactions are reinforced by interactions involving the cytoplasmic domain of VE cadherin, which binds, in a mutually exclusive manner, the armadillo proteins β or γ catenin (13Ozawa M.

An other member of the armadillo family, p120ctn or δ catenin, binds to the membrane proximal region of the VE cadherin cytoplasmic part and modulates the adhesive strength of VE cadherin (17Ferber A.

By establishing these multiple interactions, VE cadherin plays an important role in the maintenance of the endothelial integrity (18Gulino D. Delachanal E. Concord E. Genoux Y. Morand B. Valiron M.O.

VE cadherin also possesses a critical role in the transmigration of leukocytes. Indeed, treatment with anti-VE cadherin antibodies, able to disrupt interendothelial junctions, results in an increase of neutrophil transmigration in vitro (20Hordijk P.L. Anthony E. Mul F.P. Rientsma R. Oomen L.C. Roos D. J. Cell Sci. 112. 1999; 12: 1915-1923Google Scholar) and in vivo (19Corada M. Mariotti M. Thurston G. Smith K. Kunkel R. Brockhaus M. Lampugnani M.G. Martin-Padura I.

Moreover, immunofluorescence staining reveals that VE cadherin and α, β, and γ catenins disappear from cell-to-cell contacts following neutrophil adhesion to endothelial monolayers. This effect appears only where neutrophils firmly adhere, whereas VE cadherin-based complexes remain intact in areas devoid of adherent neutrophils (21Allport J.R. Ding H. Collins T. Gerritsen M.E. Luscinskas F.W. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 22Del Maschio A. Zanetti A. Corada M. Rival Y. Ruco L. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. J.

Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 497-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The exact role played by VE cadherin in the transmigration process is still controversial. It was first proposed that leukocyte adhesion might trigger intracellular signals, leading to the destabilization of VE cadherin-based complexes and thus allowing leukocyte transmigration to occur through the formed gaps (22Del Maschio A. Zanetti A. Corada M. Rival Y. Ruco L. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 497-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 21Allport J.R. Ding H. Collins T. Gerritsen M.E.

Biol. 1996; 16: 488-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) generally parallels with the tyrosine phosphorylation of the different partners within the cadherin complex. These phosphorylation events may be modulated by the capacity of VE cadherin to associate with kinases such as the receptor tyrosine kinase VEGFR-2 (24Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (3494) Google Scholar, 25Shay-Salit A. Shushy M. Wolfovitz E. Yahav H. Breviario F. Dejana E. Resnick N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Res. 2002; 273: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A second and more recent hypothesis concerning the role of VE cadherin in transmigration proposes that migrating leukocytes locally push VE cadherin in the plane of the junction thus allowing their passage through the intercellular gaps (4Shaw S.K. Bamba P.S. Perkins B.N. Luscinskas F.W. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2323-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In this study, transmigration of fluorescently labeled leukocytes was followed in real time by two-color fluorescence microscopy using HUVECs expressing endogenous VE cadherin and a VE cadherin protein fused in its C-terminal part with green fluorescent protein. This study shows that transmigration occurs through both preexisting gaps and through de novo gap formation. Gap widening accommodates to the size of the transmigrating leukocyte allowing a narrow contact between endothelial cell and leukocyte. This widening of the gaps seems to be accompanied by a clustering of the VE cadherin protein fused in its C-terminal part with green fluorescent protein molecules on the edge of the forming clefts. After transmigration, the displaced molecules diffuse back to reconstitute the junctions. These results were recently confirmed by a real-time study following the differential movements of VE cadherin in living endothelial cells during transmigration of neutrophils using antibodies which do not interfere with transendothelial migration (29Su W.H. Chen H.I. Jen C.J. Blood. 2002; 100: 3597-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The lateral movement of VE cadherin was hypothesized to be a consequence of its decoupling from the cytoskeleton, probably initiated by an intracellular signal as a result of leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. A possible role for neutrophil proteases is also suspected in transmigration (30Cepinskas G. Sandig M. Kvietys P.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1937-1945PubMed Google Scholar). These proteases could cleave proteins participating in the elaboration of intercellular contacts, thus facilitating the progression of neutrophils across the endothelial junctions. Among the proteases susceptible to involvement in transmigration are serine proteases (including elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3) and matrix metalloproteases (such as MMP-8 and MMP-9), all packed in the azurophil granules of neutrophils (31Owen C.A. Campbell E.J. Semin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recently, elastase was suspected to be able to degrade components of VE cadherin complexes during contact between neutrophils and endothelial cells (22Del Maschio A. Zanetti A. Corada M. Rival Y. Ruco L. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 497-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 21Allport J.R. Ding H. Collins T. Gerritsen M.E. Luscinskas F.W. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), but this result remains controversial. Indeed, the adhesion-dependent degradation of endothelial catenins described by Del Maschio et al. (22Del Maschio A. Zanetti A. Corada M. Rival Y. Ruco L. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 497-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and Allport et al. (21Allport J.R. Ding H. Collins T. Gerritsen M.E. Luscinskas F.W. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) probably does not reflect transmigration events but rather a release of neutrophil proteases upon cell lysis (32Moll T. Dejana E. Vestweber D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Moreover, the fact that, in MMP-9- and neutrophil elastase-deficient mice, neutrophils transmigrate as efficiently as in wild-type mice suggests that elastase and MMP-9 are not essential for the leukocyte transmigration process (33Allport J.R. Lim Y.C. Shipley J.M. Senior R.M. Shapiro S.D. Matsuyoshi N. Vestweber D. Luscinskas F.W. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 821-828PubMed Google Scholar). This is in conflict with the results of Cepinskas et al. (30Cepinskas G. Sandig M. Kvietys P.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1937-1945PubMed Google Scholar), who found that, on migrating neutrophils, membrane-bound elastase, which localizes to the migrating front, facilitates transendothelial migration. Moreover, in some pathological situations, administration of an elastase inhibitor attenuates the transmigration of neutrophils (34Carden D. Xiao F. Moak C. Willis B.H. Robinson-Jackson S. Alexander S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H385-H392PubMed Google Scholar). In the present report, we study the role of proteases and VE cadherin in neutrophil transmigration. We demonstrate that, following adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial monolayers, VE cadherin fragments are released from the surface of endothelial cells, suggesting that proteases are involved in the transmigration process. We present evidence that purified elastase and cathepsin G can cleavein vitro the extracellular part of VE cadherin. The exact positioning of the cleavage sites for each protease allows us to clearly identify elastase and cathepsin G as the surface-bound proteases able to cleave VE cadherin. Moreover, we also demonstrate that specific blockage of both elastase and cathepsin G at the neutrophil surface significantly reduces their transmigration in anin vitro assay. This strongly suggests that proteolytic events such as the cleavage of VE cadherin occurring at cell-cell junctions are required for neutrophil transmigration. Neutrophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers by using dextran-Ficoll (35Weiss J. Kao L. Victor M. Elsbach P. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and resuspended in M199 medium (Biowhittaker, Verviers, Belgium). Human endothelial cells were isolated from umbilical veins and cultured in M199 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Biowhittaker), 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Biowhittaker) and kept at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere, as previously described (10Lampugnani M.G.

Elastase was purchased from Athens Research (Athens, GA); cathepsin G was from Elastin Products Co., Inc. (Owensville, MI); human Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) was from R&D Systems Europe (Abingdon, UK); the specific human leukocyte elastase inhibitorN-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val chloromethyl ketone (MeOSuc-AAPV) was from Sigma-Aldrich Chimie (St Quentin Fallavier, France). Human tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) andN-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Meylan, France) and Sigma, respectively. The bacterially expressed VE-EC1–4 fragment was produced as previously described (11Bibert S. Jaquinod M. Concord E. Ebel C. Hewat E. Vanbelle C. Legrand P. Weidenhaupt M. Vernet T. Gulino-Debrac D.

Four fragments, designated as EC1, EC4, Cad1, and Cad3, encompassing various regions of the VE cadherin protein were used as antigens to raise the anti-VE cadherin polyclonal antibodies named anti-EC1, anti-EC4, anti-Cad1, and anti-Cad3, respectively. The shorter fragments VE-EC1 and VE-EC4 were produced as described (11Bibert S. Jaquinod M. Concord E. Ebel C. Hewat E. Vanbelle C. Legrand P. Weidenhaupt M. Vernet T. Gulino-Debrac D. J. Biol.

The resulting plasmids expressed the VE cadherin fragments Cad1 and Cad3 (amino acid stretches 1–439 for Cad1 and 259–439 for Cad3) fused at their N termini with a 16-amino acid fusion peptide (18Gulino D. Delachanal E. Concord E. Genoux Y. Morand B. Valiron M.O. Sulpice E. Scaife R. Alemany M. Vernet T. J. Biol.

Each polyclonal antibody was directly purified by applying the corresponding antiserum on an affinity column coupled to the recombinant fragment used as an antigen. The characterization of these polyclonal antibodies was performed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis on Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human VE cadherin, by immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting as previously described (18Gulino D.

The anti-fragment antibodies were biotinylated withd-biotinoyl-ε-aminocaproic acidN-hydroxysuccimide ester according to the instructions from the supplier (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Polyvinyl microtiter wells were coated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of either anti-EC1 or anti-EC4 or anti-Cad3 antibodies diluted at 10 μg/ml in 0.1 m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. The plates were postcoated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, washed with 0.05 m phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated with 100 μl of cell supernatants overnight at 4 °C. Following incubation with supernatants, extensive washing was performed with 0.05 m phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20. Bound VE cadherin-derived fragments were detected by adding 100 μl of either biotinylated anti-Cad 1 or biotinylated anti-Cad 3 diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and incubation was performed for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin was added for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, binding was quantified usingp-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate for alkaline phosphatase and measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. Following its proteolysis, VE-EC1–4 was subjected to 12.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Separated fragments were then electroblotted onto pure nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France) and blocked with 3% gelatin-containing PBS. The blots were incubated overnight with the polyclonal anti-Cad3 antibody in PBS containing 1% gelatin, and protein bands were then detected by a peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Prior to the addition of neutrophils, confluent endothelial cell monolayers were treated with 100 units/ml TNFα for 24 h and then washed with PBS. Neutrophils, suspended in M199 medium containing 10 μm fMLP, were then added to monolayers at final leukocyte:endothelial cell ratios of either 10:1 (Fig. 3) or 4:1 (Figs.4 and 5) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Under this condition, the integrity of endothelial cell monolayers was preserved. In some experiments, neutrophils were layered on resting endothelial cells. Following an incubation of 1 h, cell culture media containing nonadherent neutrophils were collected and gently centrifuged (300 × g, 10 min) to avoid neutrophil crushing. Supernatants were separated from neutrophil cells and then tested for their capacity to cleave the recombinant fragment VE-EC1–4.Figure 4Nature of the supernatant-containing proteases.

The mixtures were incubated for different periods of time at 37 °C prior to Western blot or matrix-assisted laser desorption (MALDI) mass spectrometry analyses. In some assays, the purified proteases or the supernatants were preincubated with the protease inhibitors MeOSuc-AAPV or with SLPI at 37 °C during 20 min before addition of the fragment VE-EC1–4. Neutrophils were stimulated for 30 min at 37 °C both with fMLP (10−8m) and TNFα (100 units/ml) as previously described (36Owen C.A. Campbell M.A. Sannes P.L. Boukedes S.S. Campbell E.J. J.

Following stimulation, neutrophils were fixed for 3 min at 4 °C with PBS containing 3% paraformaldehyde (w/v) and 1% glutaraldehyde (v/v). Neutrophils were then centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min, washed three times in PBS, and resuspended in cell culture medium M199 without serum. Either fixed neutrophils (105 cells) or purified human leukocyte elastase (7 × 10−4 units) or purified human leukocyte cathepsin G (7 × 10−4units) were added to the recombinant fragment VE-EC1–4 (5 μg) in the presence or absence of either SLPI (10−10 mol) or MeOSuc-AAPV (10−10 mol) and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h.

https://openalex.org/W2053521976,"Platelets interact vigorously with subendothelial collagens that are exposed by injury or pathological damage of a vessel wall. The collagen-bound platelets trap other platelets to form aggregates, and they expose phosphatidylserine (PS) required for coagulation. Both processes are implicated in the formation of vaso-occlusive thrombi. We previously demonstrated that the immunoglobulin receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI), but not integrin alpha2beta1, is essential in priming platelet-collagen interaction and subsequent aggregation. Here, we report that these receptors have yet a complementary function in ex vivo thrombus formation during perfusion of whole blood over collagen. With mice deficient in GPVI or blocking antibodies, we found that GPVI was indispensable for collagen-dependent Ca2+ mobilization, exposure of PS, and aggregation of platelets. Deficiency of integrin beta1 reduces the GPVI-evoked responses but still allows the formation of loose platelet aggregates. By using mice deficient in G(alpha)q or specific thromboxane A2 and ADP antagonists, we show that these autocrine agents mediated aggregation but not collagen-induced Ca2+ mobilization or PS exposure. Collectively, these data indicate that integrin alpha2beta1 facilitates the central function of GPVI in the platelet activation processes that lead to thrombus formation, whereas the autocrine thromboxane A2 and ADP serve mainly to trigger aggregate formation."
https://openalex.org/W2115637560,"Recent studies indicate that the proinflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, an enzyme involved in inflammatory cascades but also normal neuronal activities, is elevated in the brain and spinal cord of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients and ALS mouse model systems. On the basis of this evidence, we explored the impact of COX-2 inhibition on the onset and progression of ALS-like disease in the G93A human superoxide dismutase (SOD)1 mouse model of ALS. We found that prophylactic administration of nimesulide, a preferential COX-2 inhibitor, in the feed resulted in a significant delay in the onset of ALS type motor impairment. This delay of ALS symptomatology temporally overlapped with the inhibition of prostaglandin E2 elevation in the spinal cord of SOD1-G93A transgenic mice relative to untreated SOD1-G93A controls. This study strongly supports a role for COX-2 in the pathophysiology of ALS and provides the first experimental evidence that prophylactic treatment with COX-2 inhibitors can significantly delay the onset of motor dysfunction in the SOD1-G93A transgenic mouse model of ALS."

https://openalex.org/W2070393186,"We recently demonstrated that RASSF1A, a new tumour-suppressor gene located at 3p21.3 is frequently inactivated by promoter region hypermethylation in a variety of human cancers including lung, breast, kidney and neuroblastoma. We have identified another member of the RASSF1 gene family by in silico sequence analysis using BLAST searches. NORE1 located at 1q32.1 exists in three isoforms (NORE1Aalpha, NORE1Abeta and NORE1B). Both NORE1A and NORE1B isoforms have separate CpG islands spanning their first exons. NORE1Aalpha Produces a 418 aa protein containing a Ras-association (RA) domain and a diacylglycerol (DAG) binding domain. NORE1Abeta produces a C-terminal truncation of the RA domain. NORE1B also contains the RA domain but not the DAG domain. NORE1 is the human homologue of the mouse Ras effector Nore1. No inactivating somatic mutations were found in lung tumour lines; however, NORE1A promoter region CpG island was hypermethylated in primary tumours and tumour cell lines. NORE1A promoter was methylated in 10/25 breast, 4/40 SCLC, 3/17 NSCLC, 1/6 colorectal and 3/9 kidney tumour cell lines, while NORE1B promoter was unmethylated in the same tumour cell lines. While 24% (6/25) of primary NSCLC underwent NORE1A methylation, methylation in SCLC was a rare event (0/22); (P = 0.0234). NORE1A expression in tumour cell lines was reactivated after treatment with a demethylating agent. There was no correlation between NORE1A and RASSF1A methylation status in NSCLC. Our results demonstrate that NORE1A is inactivated in a subset of human cancers by CpG island promoter hypermethylation, and in lung cancer this hypermethylation may be histological type specific."
https://openalex.org/W2097208307,"Endothelial dysfunction is a characteristic of, and may be pathogenic in, inflammatory cardiovascular diseases, including sepsis. The mechanism underlying inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction may be related to the expression and activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). This possibility was investigated in isolated resistance (mesenteric) and conduit (aorta) arteries taken from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated (12.5 mg/kg i.v.) or saline-treated iNOS knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. LPS pretreatment (for 15 h, but not 4 h) profoundly suppressed responses to acetylcholine (ACh) and significantly reduced sensitivity to the NO donor spermine-NONOate (SPER-NO) in aorta and mesenteric arteries of WT mice. This effect was temporally associated with iNOS protein expression in both conduit and resistance arteries and with a 10-fold increase in plasma NOx levels. In contrast, no elevation of plasma NOx was observed in LPS-treated iNOS KO animals, and arteries dissected from these animals did not express iNOS or display hyporeactivity to ACh or SPER-NO. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon may be suppression of eNOS expression, as observed in arteries of WT animals, that was absent in arteries of iNOS KO animals. These results clearly demonstrate that iNOS induction plays an integral role in mediation of the endothelial dysfunction associated with sepsis in both resistance and conduit arteries."

Although it is possible to knock out the G6PD gene in the mammalian cell line, as it was shown in male mouse embryonic stem cells (6Pandolfi P.P. Sonati F. Rivi R. Mason P. Grosveld F. Luzzatto L.

On the other hand G6PD-null mutants isolated in the unicellular organisms Escherichia coli andS. cerevisiae were both viable (7Fraenkel D.G. J.

It has important functions in intermediary metabolism since it catalyzes the first step in the pentose phosphate pathway, which supplies the cell with the reductive potential in the form of NADPH, required for a variety of biosynthetic pathways and redox reactions. Apart from generating NADPH, the pentose phosphate pathway contributes to the synthesis of ribose 5-phosphate, required for the biosynthesis of some amino acids, nucleotides, and coenzymes (3Stryer L.

Moreover, we found recently that human G6PD can functionally replace this enzyme inSaccharomyces cerevisiae. 4D. Grabowska, manuscript in preparation.4D. Grabowska, manuscript in preparation.

Although it is possible to knock out the G6PD gene in the mammalian cell line, as it was shown in male mouse embryonic stem cells (6Pandolfi P.P. Sonati F. Rivi R. Mason P. Grosveld F. Luzzatto L.

https://openalex.org/W2032471037,"A number of studies have demonstrated that the STAT pathway is an important signaling cascade utilized by the IL-6 cytokine family to regulate a variety of cell functions. However, the downstream target genes of STAT activation that mediate the cytokine-induced cellular responses are largely uncharacterized. The aims of the current study are to determine whether the STAT signaling pathway is critically involved in the oncostatin M (OM)-induced growth inhibition and morphological changes of MCF-7 cells and to identify STAT3-target genes that are utilized by OM to regulate cell growth and morphology. We show that expression of a dominant negative (DN) mutant of STAT3 in MCF-7 cells completely eliminated the antiproliferative activity of OM, whereas expression of DN STAT1 had no effect. The growth inhibition of breast cancer cells was achieved through a concerted action of OM on cell cycle components. We have identified four cell cycle regulators including c-myc, cyclin D1, c/EBPdelta, and p53 as downstream effectors of the OM-activated STAT3 signaling cascade. The expression of these genes is differentially regulated by OM in MCF-7 cells, but is unaffected by OM in MCF-7-dnStat3 stable clones. We also demonstrate that the OM-induced morphological changes are correlated with increased cell motility in a STAT3-dependent manner. Expression analysis of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins leads to the identification of fibronectin as a novel OM-regulated ECM component. Our studies further reveal that STAT3 plays a key role in the robust induction of fibronectin expression by OM in MCF-7 and T47D cells. These new findings provide a molecular basis for the mechanistic understanding of the effects of OM on cell growth and migration."
https://openalex.org/W2142952303,"The mechanisms underlying CD95 ligand (CD95L)- and hyperosmolarity-induced activation of the CD95 system [Reinehr, R., Graf, D., Fischer, R., Schliess, F., and Haussinger, D. (2002) Hepatology 36, 602-614] as initial steps of apoptosis were studied. Hyperosmotic exposure (405 mosmol/l) of rat hepatocytes induced within 1 min oxidative stress and antioxidant-sensitive activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-Jun-N-terminal-kinase (JNK). After 30 min of hyperosmotic exposure EGFR associated with CD95 and CD95 became tyrosine phosphorylated. Inhibition of JNK or protein kinase C (PKC) had no effect on EGFR phosphorylation but abolished CD95/EGFR association, CD95-tyrosine phosphorylation, membrane targeting, and Fas-associated death domain/caspase 8 recruitment to CD95 [death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) formation]. Inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity prevented CD95 tyrosine phosphorylation and DISC formation but not hyperosmolarity-induced EGFR phosphorylation and EGFR association with CD95. Tyrosine-phosphorylated CD95 was enriched in the plasma membrane. All maneuvers preventing CD95 tyrosine phosphorylation inhibited CD95 membrane trafficking and DISC formation. Stimulation of EGFR by EGF induced EGFR phosphorylation but no association with CD95 or CD95 phosphorylation. Addition of CD95L also induced EGFR and JNK activation, EGFR/CD95 association, CD95 tyrosine phosphorylation, DISC formation, and CD95 membrane targeting with an inhibitor sensitivity profile similar to that of hyperosmotic CD95 activation, except that inhibition of PKC was ineffective. The data suggest that moderate hyperosmolarity or CD95L trigger oxidative stress and EGFR activation followed by a JNK-dependent EGFR/CD95association and CD95 tyrosine phosphorylation, probably through EGFR tyrosine kinase activity. This provides a signal for CD95 membrane trafficking and DISC formation."
https://openalex.org/W2156575905,"Green tea polyphenols (GTPs), which possess antioxidant properties, have been shown to inhibit the development of atherosclerotic lesions. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant GTP, displays antiproliferative effects in a variety of cell types. Here, we examined the effects of GTPs on aortic smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation. Treatment with a GTP mixture or EGCG at a dose of 40 to 50 microg/ml slowed SMC growth, while at a higher dose of 80 microg/ml EGCG also induced cell death as judged by TUNEL assay. Apoptosis was mainly observed in proliferating SMCs in subconfluent cultures; whereas at higher confluency, cell viability was largely unaffected. Treatment with 80 microg/ml EGCG induced the tumor suppressor p53, which was functional as judged by activation of the target cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP1. Inhibition of p53 activity with a dominant negative mutant reduced cell death. The increase in p53 protein was due to increased stability. EGCG also induced functional nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) complexes, and inhibition of this activity reduced the extent of cell death. Thus, EGCG inhibits growth and induces death of SMCs in a p53- and NF-kappaB-dependent manner. These results provide evidence for a new molecular mechanism whereby green tea polyphenols inhibit SMC proliferation and function to prevent the development of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2162327400,"Oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL) exhibit proinflammatory properties and play a role in atherosclerosis plaque formation, rupture, and subsequent thrombosis. OxLDL alter the activity of the transcription factor NF-kappaB that is involved in the expression of immune and inflammatory genes. In contrast, high-density lipoproteins (HDL) are anti-atherogenic and exhibit anti-inflammatory properties. This work aimed to investigate how oxLDL activate NF-kappaB and whether and how HDL may prevent NF-kappaB activation. In cultured rabbit smooth muscle cells, mitogenic concentrations of mildly oxLDL trigger a rapid and transient NF-kappaB activation, which is strongly inhibited by HDL. Growth factors, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, and sphingosine kinase pathways are not implicated in the oxLDL-induced NF-kappaB activation and are not targets of HDL. OxLDL induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and proteasome activation, which are implicated in NF-kappaB activation, as suggested by the inhibitory effect of the antioxidants N-acetyl-L-cysteine and pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate and the proteasome inhibitor PSI. HDL were able to prevent the intracellular ROS rise triggered by oxLDL or H2O2, thereby inhibiting the subsequent proteasome activation, IkappaB degradation, and NF-kappaB activation. In conclusion, the oxLDL-induced NF-kappaB activation involves ROS generation and proteasome activation, both events being inhibited by HDL. This 'antioxidant' and potentially anti-inflammatory effect of HDL may participate in their general anti-atherogenic properties."
https://openalex.org/W1967269037,"Elevated levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II are associated with a poor prognosis in human pulmonary adenocarcinoma; however, a causal role for IGF-II in pulmonary adenocarcinoma has not been demonstrated. Here, we show that transgenic overexpression of IGF-II in lung epithelium induces lung tumors in 69% of mice older than 18 months of age. These tumors displayed morphological characteristics of human pulmonary adenocarcinoma such as their epithelial origin, tubulo-acinar architecture and expression of TTF-1, SP-B and proSP-C. Examination of signaling molecules downstream of the IGF-IR showed the activation of either the Erk1/Erk2 or p38 MAPK pathways, but not both, within the lung tumors. Notably, all lung tumors contained high levels of phosphorylated CREB, suggesting that both the Erk1/Erk2 and p38 MAPK pathways converged on this transcription factor. Moreover, IGF-II induced proliferation and CREB phosphorylation in human lung cancer cell lines, suggesting that IGF-II and CREB also contribute to the growth of human lung tumors. Thus, IGF-II is an important genetic factor in the development of lung tumorigenesis, in which activation of CREB is a ubiquitous event. The MMTV-IGF-II transgenic mice provide a critical model for elucidating the role of IGF-II in this fatal human disease."

This is followed by apoE re-secretion and association of apoE with high density lipoproteins (HDL). Because HDL and apoE can independently promote cholesterol efflux, we investigated whether recycling of TRL-derived apoE in human hepatoma cells and fibroblasts could be linked to intracellular cholesterol transport.

During apoE re-secretion, HDL3-derived apoA-I is found in these early endosome antigen 1, cholesterol-containing endosomes.

Drug Delivery Rev. 2001; 49: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we investigated whether recycling of TRL-derived apoE is accompanied by the mobilization of cellular cholesterol. In this study we demonstrate that HDL3-inducible apoE recycling is associated with cholesterol efflux. Life cell imaging and confocal microscopy revealed that this process involves the targeting of HDL3-derived apoA-I to EEA1-positive endosomes containing both TRL-derived apoE and cholesterol. After re-secretion, TRL-derived apoE and cholesterol are found associated with extracellular HDL particles. Taken together, these findings indicate that apoE recycling provides an efficient mechanism to re-supply plasma with apoE-containing HDL particles. This process would ultimately accelerate the enrichment of CR with apoE and stimulate the hepatic clearance of CR in the postprandial state.

Angelin B. Beisiegel U. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1733-1742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoE3 was isolated by preparative SDS-PAGE (14Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TRL were radiolabeled by the iodine monochloride method, whereas apoE was radiolabeled with Iodogen (16Heeren J. Grewal T. Jäckle S. Beisiegel U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42333-42338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). 100 μg of unlabeled or 125I-labeled apoE were associated with TRL (0.5 mg of protein) to prepare apoE-TRL (final concentration 0.28 mg of protein/ml) or 125I-apoE-TRL as described (16Heeren J. Grewal T. Jäckle S. Beisiegel U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42333-42338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations of the 125I-TRL and the 125I-apoE-TRL preparations were 0.2 ± 0.05 mg/ml, and the specific radioactivity was 100–180 cpm/ng protein, respectively. 125I-TRL and the 125I-apoE-TRL preparations were routinely separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and radiolabeling of TRL apoproteins was confirmed by autoradiography. For the labeling of lipoproteins with [3H]Chol, 100 μl of [3H]Chol (3.7 MBq) was dried under liquid nitrogen, resuspended in 100 μl of DMEM + 2% BSA, and incubated overnight with 0.5–1 mg of 125I-apoE-TRL ([3H]Chol/125I-apoE-TRL) or 3–5 mg of LDL ([3H]Chol-LDL) in PBS + 10 mm EDTA at 37 °C. Non-incorporated [3H]Chol was removed by PD10 gel chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). For immunofluorescence experiments, apoE-TRL (0.2 mg) were labeled with Cy3 (Cy3-apoE-TRL), and HDL3 apoproteins (1 mg) were labeled with Alexa 568 nm (Alexa-HDL3) or Cy5 (Cy5-HDL3) according to the instructions of the manufacturers. Fluorescent label was found predominantly in apoE of Cy3-apoE-TRL (∼80–90%) and apoA-I of Alexa-HDL3 or Cy5-HDL3 (∼90–95%) as determined by SDS-PAGE, respectively (data not shown). To label Cy3-apoE-TRL with NBD-cholesterol, 0.2 mg of Cy3-apoE-TRL was incubated with 250 μg of NBD-cholesterol in PBS, 1 mm EDTA at 37 °C overnight. Non-incorporated NBD-cholesterol was removed by PD10 gel chromatography. For electron microscopy, HDL3 (600 μg; pI 5.5) and apoE3 (100 μg; pI 5.78) were labeled with colloidal gold of 5 (gold-HDL) and 12 nm gold, respectively, according to Handleyet al. (26Handley D.A. Arbeeny C.M. Witte L.D. Chien S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Then apoE3 was associated with TRL (gold-apoE-TRL) as described above. Conjugations of gold-HDL3 and gold-labeled apoE3 were confirmed after staining with sodium phosphotungstate by electron microscopy (data not shown). For radioactive pulse-chase experiments, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with125I-TRL (2.5 μg/ml) for 60 min at 37 °C in 1 ml of DMEM containing 5% BSA (pH 7.4). The cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS, and surface-bound ligands were released with 770 units/ml heparin (14Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). To promote recycling, 125I-TRL labeled cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with DMEM + 0.1% BSA supplemented with 50 μg/ml HDL3, 100 μg/ml LDL, or 10% human serum. Then the content of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable, recycled radioactivity in the harvested media was determined. Cells were solubilized in 0.1 n NaOH to calculate the amount of internalized and recycled radioactivity (14Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In one set of experiments, recycled and radiolabeled TRL apoproteins from cell culture media were subjected to density gradient ultracentrifugation (KBr density from 1.006 to 1.21 g/ml) (23Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). After gradient fractionation, the radioactivity in each fraction was determined. The positions of lipoproteins were identified according to their density and the cholesterol profile of the gradient (data not shown). In another set of experiments, the recycled radiolabeled TRL apoproteins were separated by FPLC analysis with a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). Cholesterol and protein profiles from standards (TRL, LDL, HDL, albumin) allowed the identification of the fractions containing lipoproteins and albumin (lipoprotein-free fraction (LFF)). For immunofluorescence experiments, fibroblasts and hepatoma cells were incubated with apoE-TRL (1 μg/ml) in DMEM + 2% BSA for 60 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed in DMEM and treated with heparin at 4 °C for 15 min (see above). Then cells were incubated for an additional 0, 15, or 60 min at 37 °C in DMEM (0.1% BSA) ± 50 μg/ml unlabeled or fluorescent-labeled HDL3(Alexa-HDL3, Cy5-HDL3). Cells were washed in PBS and fixed in 4% PFA, and indirect immunofluorescence against apoE, AP1, and EEA1 was performed (14Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular cholesterol was visualized using 50 μg/ml filipin (27De Diego I. Schwartz F. Siegfried H. Dauterstedt P. Heeren J. Beisiegel U.

Full cell images were taken with an Axiovert 100 microscope equipped with a Zeiss Axiocam. Confocal images were collected using a Zeiss LSM 510 (version 3.0) equipped with an UV laser to detect filipin-stained cholesterol. For living cell microscopy, fibroblasts were incubated with double-labeled NBD-cholesterol/Cy3-apoE-TRL (1 μg/ml) in DMEM + 2% BSA for 0–30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed in DMEM and incubated for an additional 10 min with 50 μg/ml Cy5-HDL3. Confocal images were taken every minute in the multitrack mode using optimized pinhole adjustment for each fluorochrome. For electron microscopy, a pre-embedding procedure was performed. Hepatoma cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml gold-apoE-TRL (12 nm) in DMEM + 2% BSA for 60 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed, treated with heparin (see above), and incubated with 5 μg/ml gold-HDL3(5 nm) at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed in 2% PFA, 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 60 min at room temperature. Then fixed cells were scraped and post-fixed in 2% PFA in PBS for 2 days at 4 °C. Samples were washed, treated with 1% OsO4, 0.8% potassium ferricyanide (Sigma) in PBS, dehydrated with acetone, and embedded in Spurr resin (Sigma). Ultrathin sections were obtained and counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate as described previously (28Ortega D. Pol A. Biermer M. Jäckle S. Enrich C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 261-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fibroblasts and hepatoma cells were incubated with apoE-TRL (1 μg/ml) for 60 min at 37 °C, washed, and incubated for an additional 0 or 60 min at 37 °C ± 50 μg/ml HDL3 in DMEM + 0.1% BSA. The media were harvested, filtered (inner diameter, 0.45 μm), and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted against apoE. After incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, the reaction product was detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). In the first set of experiments, cells were incubated with double-labeled [3H]Chol/125I-apoE-TRL (1 μg/ml) for 60 min at 37 °C and then washed with ice-cold PBS and heparin to remove surface-bound ligands (see above). [3H]Chol/125I-apoE-TRL labeled cells were incubated for additional 60 min at 37 °C in DMEM + 0.1% BSA in the presence or absence of 50 μg/ml HDL3. The media were harvested to quantify 125I-apoE recycling after trichloroacetic acid precipitation (see above), whereas [3H]Chol efflux was determined after Dole extraction (29Merkel M. Heeren J.

In the second set of experiments, intracellular cholesterol pools were radiolabeled overnight with [3H]Chol-LDL (100,000 cpm/ml) at 37 °C. Non-internalized [3H]Chol-LDL was removed by heparin treatment (see above). Then cells were incubated with or without apoE-TRL for 60 min at 37 °C. After heparin treatment (see above), cells were incubated in DMEM + 0.1% BSA in the presence or absence of 50 μg/ml HDL3 for an additional 60 min at 37 °C. The media were harvested, and cells were lysed in 0.1 n NaOH. Dole extraction of media and cell lysates was performed to determine [3H]Chol efflux. We have demonstrated previously (9Heeren J. Beisiegel U. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 42333-42338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) that the recycling of internalized TRL-derived apoE and LPL requires the presence of an extracellular lipoprotein acceptor. To compare the ability of different lipoproteins to mediate TRL recycling, human hepatoma cells were preincubated with 125I-TRL, and recycling of 125I-TRL proteins was induced with human serum, LDL, or HDL3 (Fig.1A). Consistent with previous results (16Heeren J. Grewal T. Jäckle S. Beisiegel U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42333-42338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), addition of 10% human serum stimulated recycling of internalized 125I-TRL proteins 2-fold compared with the lipoprotein-free control (Fig. 1A,w/o). Similarly, in the presence of HDL3(50 μg/ml protein), a 1.8-fold increase of 125I-TRL recycling was observed. This stimulatory effect of HDL3 on125I-TRL recycling was already detectable at very low levels of HDL3 (2.5 μg/ml), dose-dependent, and saturable in the presence of 50 μg/ml HDL3 (Fig.1B). In contrast, no significant stimulation of125I-TRL recycling was determined when LDL (100 μg/ml protein) was utilized (Fig. 1A). These findings indicated that HDL3 could stimulate 125I-TRL recycling and serve as an acceptor for recycled 125I-TRL proteins. To analyze the association of recycled 125I-TRL proteins with lipoproteins, the media containing the lipoprotein acceptors and the released 125I-TRL-derived radioactivity were harvested and separated either by density gradient centrifugation (Fig.2A) or gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 2B). Recycled 125I-TRL proteins from the media of cells incubated with human serum identified ∼60% of TRL radioactivity in the HDL fractions (fractions 7–11 in Fig. 2A), whereas 40% was found in the lipid-free bottom of the gradient (fractions 1–4). It is likely that lipid-free apoA-I in human serum is responsible for the association of 125I-TRL proteins in these bottom fractions, because lipid-free apoA-I also induced recycling of 125I-TRL proteins into these fractions (data not shown). When 125I-TRL-loaded cells were incubated with HDL3, a predominant association of recycled125I-TRL proteins with HDL was observed (fractions 7–11, Fig. 2A). To confirm the association of recycled125I-TRL with HDL, re-secreted 125I-TRL proteins were separated by Superdex 200 gel filtration (Fig.2B), which is appropriate for the resolution of small sized lipoproteins (10–600 kDa). As expected HDL3-induced recycling of internalized 125I-TRL resulted in the association of 125I-labeled apoproteins with HDL (fractions 24–28; Fig. 2B). In addition 125I-TRL proteins were found in lipid-free fractions (LFF; fractions 29–31), which were representative of recycled 125I-TRL proteins when lipid-free apoA-I was used as an acceptor (data not shown). Independent of density gradient or gel filtration analysis, we never detected significant amounts of recycled 125I-TRL proteins in the fractions containing LDL (fractions 16–18 in Fig. 2A), TRL (fractions 21 and 22 in Fig. 2A), or both LDL and TRL (fractions 17–19 in Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that TRL or LDL do not serve as acceptors for recycled125I-TRL apoproteins. Taken together, these results indicate that HDL in human serum is capable of stimulating TRL protein recycling (Fig. 1, A and B) and serve as an acceptor for recycled TRL proteins (Fig. 2, A andB).Figure 2Density gradient and FPLC analysis of recycled 125I-TRL-derived apoproteins.

Fractions from bottom to top (500 μl) were collected, and the radioactivity was determined in each fraction. The gradient distribution (mean values of duplicate samples) of recycled 125I-TRL apoproteins (counts/min) of a representative experiment is shown (n= 3). The fractions containing TRL (fractions 21 and 22), LDL (fractions 16–18), HDL (fractions 7–11), and the lipid-free bottom (fractions 1–4) are indicated and were identified by their respective density and cholesterol content. B, the non-degraded radioactivity of media from cells analyzed in Fig. 1A, which were incubated with media alone (○, w/o) or with 50 μg/ml HDL3 (●, HDL3) were separated by a Superdex 200 column (see “Experimental Procedures”); 500-μl fractions were collected, and the radioactivity was determined in each fraction. The distribution of recycled 125I-TRL apoproteins (counts/min) for a representative experiment is shown (n = 3). The fractions containing TRL/LDL (fractions 17–19) and HDL (fractions 24–28) are indicated. The LFF (fractions 29–31) contain proteins in the range of 20–80 kDa. The positions of lipoproteins were identified by the comparison of cholesterol profiles from the analyzed samples with isolated preparations of TRL, LDL, and HDL, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is well known that HDL can stimulate cellular cholesterol efflux (19von Eckardstein A.

Because HDL-dependent re-secretion of 125I-TRL (see above) mainly involves recycling of apoE (14Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether recycling of TRL-derived apoE could be linked to intracellular cholesterol transport. Therefore, the distribution of TRL-derived apoE and cholesterol in the presence or absence of HDL3 was first studied by immunocytochemistry. In initial experiments with human hepatoma cells, immunostaining against TRL-derived apoE interfered with endogenous apoE expression (data not shown). Thus, human fibroblasts with no detectable amounts of endogenous apoE were analyzed. These cells, similar to the HuH7 hepatoma cells described above, efficiently recycled TRL proteins through peripheral endosomal compartments (14Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the following set of experiments, fibroblasts were incubated with apoE-enriched TRL (apoE-TRL), which was followed by a 60-min chase ± HDL3 (Fig. 3). The cells were then fixed, immunostained against apoE to detect TRL-derived apoE, a"

The immediate events leading to ecdysis, which are initiated upon release of ecdysis-triggering hormones (ETH) into the bloodstream, include respiratory inflation and sequential stereotypic behaviors that facilitate shedding of the cuticle. Here we report that the Drosophila geneCG5911 encodes two functionally distinct subtypes of G protein-coupled receptors through alternative splicing (CG5911a and CG5911b) that respond preferentially to ecdysis-triggering hormones of flies and moths. These subtypes show differences in ligand sensitivity and specificity, suggesting that they may play separate roles in ETH signaling. At significantly higher concentrations (>100-fold), certain insect and vertebrate peptides also activate these receptors, providing evidence that CG5911 is evolutionarily related to the thyrotropin-releasing hormone and neuromedin U receptors. The ETH signaling system in insects is a vital system that provides opportunities for the construction of models for the molecular basis of stereotypic animal behavior as well as a target for the design of more sophisticated insect-selective pest control strategies.

Ewer J. Ball E.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 749-758PubMed Google Scholar). This complex process, by which the insect escapes its outer shell and sheds the cuticular lining of the foregut, hindgut, and respiratory system, is mediated by a peptide hormone-signaling cascade that results in a sequence of precisely timed physiological and behavioral events. Initiation of the ecdysis sequence coincides with the appearance of ecdysis-triggering hormones (ETHs)1 in the bloodstream, which act directly on the central nervous system to elicit patterned motor output characteristic of pre-ecdysis and ecdysis behaviors (2Zitnan D.

Biol. 2000; 203: 1329-1340PubMed Google Scholar). In the moth Manduca sexta, two peptides called MasPETH and MasETH act in concert to trigger successive phases of the ecdysis behavioral sequence. Remarkably, the temporal features of these motor patterns recorded from the isolated nervous system closely reflect the behavior observed in whole animals. Related peptides inDrosophila melanogaster known as ETH1 and ETH2 trigger ecdysis, although their respective roles in the recruitment of different parts of the ecdysis sequence are less clear. As yet the molecular and cellular targets of ETHs have not been described. Additional signaling molecules operating downstream of ETH within the central nervous system include the eclosion hormone and the crustacean cardioactive peptide (2Zitnan D. Ross L.S. Zitnanova I.

Identification of ETH receptors would be of great help in defining the cellular elements involved in ecdysis behaviors. With this objective, we took advantage of the Drosophila genome project to investigate G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are likely to respond to ETH (8Hewes R.S. Taghert P.H.

The search for ETH receptors was narrowed to a small number of candidates on the basis of an assumption of ligand-receptor co-evolution, in which receptors for peptides having a C-terminal amino acid motif consisting of PRX amide would have high sequence homology. An exhaustive analysis of theDrosophila genome yielded two groups of GPCRs, the neuromedin U (NMU) group and the vasopressin group (10Park Y. Kim Y.J. Adams M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11423-11428Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Functional analysis revealed that the NMU group likely arose through ligand-receptor co-evolution, because it responds to several groups of peptides with a C-terminal PRX amide motif characteristic of the ETHs. In contrast, the vasopressin group responds to unrelated peptides, and thus the PRX amide in this group appears to have arisen through convergent evolution. The monophyletic group of NMU receptors was found to be activated by all three categories of insect PRX amide peptides (10Park Y. Kim Y.J. Adams M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In particular, CG8795 was activated by DrmPK2, HUGγ, and ETH1, with sensitivity to DrmPK2 and HUGγ being far greater than to ETH1 (DrmPK2 > HUGγ > ETH1). The responsiveness of CG8795 to only relatively high concentrations of ETH1 suggested that it is unlikely to be the physiological ETH receptor. We therefore expanded the search profile for ETH receptors to include CG5911, which encodes a receptor related to the NMU group. As predicted (8Hewes R.S. Taghert P.H. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1126-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), CG5911 gene products occur as two alternative splice variants termed CG5911a and CG5911b. CG5911b responds to ETH1 and the related peptides MasETH and MasPETH from moths at subnanomolar concentrations while showing relative insensitivity to other peptides sharing C-terminal PRX amide motifs. A pattern of cross-reactivity in a second set of peptides provides further support for the hypothesis that CG5911 encodes the authentic ETH receptor. cDNA was synthesized using Superscript (Invitrogen) with mRNA isolated by Dynabeads (Dynal) from whole flies (∼50 individuals of Canton S) in both larval and adult stages by priming at poly(A) sites. PCR reactions conducted in 20-μl volumes contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTP, 0.5 μm of each primer, 0.5 unit ofTaq polymerase (Invitrogen), and 0.5 unit of Pfupolymerase (Stratagene). The reaction mixture was denatured initially for 5 min at 94 °C and then subjected to 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 53 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min and 30 s. The RT-PCR products were cloned in pGEM-T-EZ vector (Promega) and sequenced. Start and stop codons of the open reading frames (ORF) were confirmed by the primers in the RT-PCR designed on the outside of the in-frame stop codons of the ORF. The primers shown in Fig. 1 are Fa (5′-AAGGACGATGGCGATGCTGA) paired with Ra (5′-GCTTACCCCTTACTGCCAGT) and Fb (5′-CCCGAGGATGTTGTCCCTGT) paired with Rb (5′-GATGGGATTCAGATCTTGCT). The CG5911 ORFs were inserted into the pXOON vector (17Jespersen T. Grunnet M. Angelo K. Klaerke D.A. Olesen S.P. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 536-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which contains an enhanced green fluorescent protein marker. Phylogenetic analysis was done in PAUP version 4.0b8a for generation of a distance tree with 1000 bootstrapping samplings. Transient expression ofCG5911 gene products was accomplished in the CHO-WTA11 cell line exhibiting stable expression of the luminescent reporter aequorin (18Rizzuto R. Simpson A.W. Brini M. Pozzan T. Nature. 1992; 358: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) and the G protein Gα16 (19Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in complete Ham's F12 medium at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transfection with pXOON-CG5911a and pXOON-CG5911b was performed using FuGene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol at a DNA to FuGene6 ratio of 3:1. Transfected cells were observed under an epifluorescence microscope 1 day later to determine transfection efficiency as measured by the number of cells expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein. Before functional assays, cell suspensions were incubated in coelanterazine h (Molecular Probes) according to previously defined protocols (20Le Poul E. Hisada S. Mizuguchi Y. Dupriez V.J. Burgeon E. Detheux M. J. Biomol. Screen. 2002; 7: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Luminescence assays were performed in opaque 96-well microplates (Corning) using a Beckman model LD400 Luminometer. After the addition of cells to a well, luminescence was monitored using an 0.5-s sampling time for 20 s. Each 96-well microplate contained multiple wells for positive controls (100 and 300 μm ETH1) and negative controls (buffer only). Luminescence at each ligand concentration was integrated during the 20-s response interval and normalized to the largest positive control response in each plate after the subtraction of background values obtained from negative controls. Luminescence measured in multiple replica wells (2–4 wells) for one concentration of ligand was averaged for the analysis. Data collected from at least three replica plates were used for analysis using the Origin analysis program (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). The sources of peptides were described previously (10Park Y. Kim Y.J. Adams M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11423-11428Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), and additional vertebrate peptides (NMU-8, TRH, and ghrelin) were purchased from the American Peptide Company. MasETHacid was synthesized at the University of California, Riverside, using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry and automated solid state techniques.

TheCG5911 gene has homologous mutually alternative exons 4a and 4b encoding the protein sequence from the middle of transmembrane segment 4 to the C terminus (Figs. 1 and2). The clones used for the expression contain the coding sequence from nucleotide position −24 upstream of the Met site to +368 nucleotides after the 3′ stop codon for CG5911a and from −490 to +8 for CG5911b (see GenBank™ accession numbersAY220741, AY220742, and Celera Genomics sequence GenBankTM accession number AE003734) (Fig.2). The ORF is supported by the in-frame stop codon in the 5′-untranslated region (Fig. 1). Initial BLASTP searches and phylogenetic analyses identified the translation of CG5911 (GenBankTM accession number AAF55872) as a Drosophila GPCR closely related to the monophyletic group of NMU receptors responding to PRX amide peptides (10Park Y. Kim Y.J. Adams M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11423-11428Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Putative transcripts generating CG5911a and -b are grouped with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptor in a distance tree with a bootstrapping value of 83.8% (Fig.3). The prediction of gene structure revealed the presence of homologous mutually alternative exons 4a and 4b from transmembrane segment 4 to the C terminus encoding two splice variants of the receptor (Figs. 1and 2). Stop codons occurring at C-terminal ORFs for CG5911a and CG5911b were identified by RT-PCR using primers located after the stop codon. RT-PCR with the primer covering a stop codon at the 5′ end of the ORF for CG5911b revealed a transcript supporting the ORF prediction. Ecdysis-triggering hormones of both Drosophilaand Manduca elicited robust luminescence responses in the CHO-WTA11 cell line stably expressing Gα16 and aequorin transfected with pXOON-CG5911a and pXOON-CG5911b (Fig.4). The time course of cellular responses was concentration-dependent, with delayed slow responses beginning at 0.1 nm and rapid peak responses occurring at 1 μm for CG5911b (Fig. 4A). At the lowest effective concentrations (0.1 nm), the luminescence response was delayed more than 10 s. Integration of each response shown in Fig. 4A during a 20-s sampling period is shown in Fig. 4B. Both CG5911a and CG5911b showed preferential sensitivity to ETHs, with CG5911b showing a significantly higher apparent affinity for all peptides tested (Fig. 4, C and D).Drosophila ETH1 was the most active ligand for both receptors. For CG5911b, responses were evident at 0.25 nmand reached peak values at 10 nm with an EC50value of 0.9 nm. ETH2 and Manduca PETH were only slightly less active, with EC50 values of ∼2 nm. Interestingly, Manduca ETH was approximately 5 times less active on CG5911b than PETH. CG5911a was markedly less sensitive to all peptides tested compared with CG5911b. The most active peptide again was ETH1, with an EC50 of 414 nm, making it ∼400-fold less active on this receptor than on CG5911b. ETH2, MasPETH, and MasETH had EC50 values greater than 2 μm. CG5911b showed significant sensitivity to a range of ETH-related peptides having the signature PRXa C-terminal amino acid motif (Fig.5). These peptides include SCPB, HUGγ, CAP2b-1, CAP2b-2, PBAN, and MasETH acid. The most active of these peptides were SCPB, MasETH acid, HUGγ, and CAP2b-1; the EC50 values of these peptides were in the range of 300 nm to 3 μm. Furthermore, the vertebrate peptides NMU and TRH caused low but significant receptor activation when applied at 10 μm as did the molluscan peptide myomodulin (p < 0.001 in Student'st test; Fig. 5B). No activity was observed for a number of other peptide ligands, including some with the C-terminal PRXa motif. These ligands include Drm-PK-2, CAP2b-3, and Hez PMP (Fig. 5B). Ecdysis-triggering hormones are vital regulatory signals that govern the stereotypic physiological sequence leading to cuticle shedding in insects. In previous work we identified ETHs in two moth species, Manduca sexta and Bombyx mori, and in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (2Zitnan D. Ross L.S. Zitnanova I. Hermesman J.L. Gill S.S. Adams M.E. Neuron. 1999; 23: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 15Adams M.E. Zitnan D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Park Y. Zitnan D. Gill S.S. Adams M.E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Using genetic tools in Drosophila to excise the ethgene, lethal ecdysis deficits were demonstrated at the end of the first larval instar (21Park Y. Filippov V. Gill S.S. Adams M.E. Development. 2002; 129: 493-503PubMed Google Scholar). Lethality was reversed by the injection of ETH peptides (21Park Y. Filippov V. Gill S.S. Adams M.E. Development. 2002; 129: 493-503PubMed Google Scholar). The ETH signaling system therefore has been demonstrated to be both necessary and sufficient for insects to survive the earliest ecdysis. To expand our understanding of the molecular basis for ETH action, we conducted a search for its likely receptor inDrosophila. In this paper we report on the cloning and functional expression of theDrosophila gene CG5911, predicted by Hewes and Taghert (8Hewes R.S. Taghert P.H. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1126-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) to encode splice variants called CG5911a and CG5911b. Our results show that both splice variants of CG5911 are highly selective for ETH1 and related peptides from both fly and moth, with CG5911b responding to subnanomolar concentrations ofDrosophila ETH1. For each receptor subtype the highest sensitivity was observed to Drosophila ETH1 and ETH2, but comparable sensitivity also was observed for MasPETH and MasETH. Other insect and vertebrate peptides, particularly those having C-terminal PRX amide motifs, also activated CG5911b, but only at ∼100–1000-fold higher concentrations. The selectivity and high sensitivity of CG5911 to ETHs alone strongly supports the hypothesis that this gene encodes the authentic ETH receptor. The gene structure of CG5911 with the results of RT-PCR revealed two homologous exons presenting the mutually alternative splice variants CG5911a and CG5911b. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that divergent exons 4a and 4b are the product of duplication. The portion of the receptor protein predicted by exon 4 extends from the middle of transmembrane segment 4 (T4) to the C terminus and therefore includes two extracellular loops (T4-T5 and T6-T7), one intracellular loop (T5-T6), and the C-terminal intracellular tail. Clearly, alternative splicing of exons 4a and 4b to create these receptor isoforms could affect both their ligand and G protein-coupling specificities. Functional differences in CG5911a and CG5911b are suggested by several observations. CG5911b is activated by subnanomolar concentrations of ETH1 (EC50 = 0.9 nm), whereas the sensitivity of CG5911a is more than 400-fold lower (EC50 = 410 nm). The lower sensitivity of CG5911a to all ligands may be a consequence of poor coupling efficiency to the Gα16used in our assay system. Indeed, the smaller size of peak luminescence responses recorded for CG5911a as compared with CG5911b (data not shown) supports this idea. Further investigation of CG5911a sensitivity using different G proteins will be necessary to resolve this question. Nevertheless, differences in G protein coupling and downstream signal transduction steps could provide a basis for functionally distinct roles for these two receptor subtypes in ETH signaling. In addition to these differences, the ligand sensitivity for the two receptor subtypes is significantly different. The relative potency of ligands on CG5911a (ETH1 > MasETH > ETH2 > MasPETH; see Fig. 4) reflects the same order of biological activity observed for the induction of ecdysis behavior (16Park Y. Zitnan D. Gill S.S. Adams M.E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the case of CG5911b, we observed a somewhat different order of potency (ETH1 > ETH2 > MasPETH > MasETH). The reversal in receptor sensitivity to MasPETH and MasETH suggests that these receptor subtypes discriminate between MasPETH and MasETH and raises the intriguing possibility thatCG5911 orthologs in the Manduca system encode receptors that are ligand-specific. Indeed, preliminary findings involving the Manduca ortholog of CG5911b confirm the preference for MasPETH. 2Y. J. Kim and M. E. Adams, unpublished data. The possible ligand specificity of the two receptor subtypes may account at least in part for divergent activities of these two ligands in the induction of natural pre-ecdysis behavior (2Zitnan D. Ross L.S. Zitnanova I. Hermesman J.L. Gill S.S. Adams M.E. Neuron. 1999; 23: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 3Zitnan D. Adams M.E. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 1329-1340PubMed Google Scholar). Further study ofManduca orthologous isoforms of CG5911 is under way to test this hypothesis. Responses of CG5911b to a second tier of ligands that are active only at >100-fold-higher concentrations reveal further insights into its properties and the likely physiological role of CG5911 as the ETH receptor. All ETHs are C-terminally amidated, and this post-translational modification is essential for biological activity in the silkworm, B. mori (15Adams M.E. Zitnan D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although the injection of synthetic Bombyx ETH elicits the entire ecdysis behavioral sequence in silkworm larvae, the free acid form proved to be largely inactive (15Adams M.E. Zitnan D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the present study, the free acid form of MasETH (MasETHacid, Fig. 5) was found to be more than 100 times less active than native MasETH. CG5911b therefore discriminates between these subtly different forms of the peptide just as we observed previously in behavioral assays (2Zitnan D. Ross L.S. Zitnanova I. Hermesman J.L. Gill S.S. Adams M.E. Neuron. 1999; 23: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We tested a variety of both invertebrate and vertebrate peptides on CG5911b, and most were inactive. Nevertheless, some interesting patterns of activity are apparent among the few peptides that showed some biological activity. Of the invertebrate peptides tested, the peptide HUGγ, encoded by the ortholog of the moth PBANgene as well as PBAN itself, were active at several hundred-fold higher concentrations than authentic ETHs. The low affinity response of CG5911b to HUGγ and its high affinity response to ETH1 and ETH2 complement our previous results, which showed that the related GPCR encoded by CG8795 is highly sensitive to HUGγ but considerably less sensitive to ETHs (10Park Y. Kim Y.J. Adams M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11423-11428Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). These results confirm our phylogenetic analyses, which indicate the close evolutionary relationship betweenCG8795 and CG5911. The question remains as to whether the cross-reactivities of these two ligands (ETH and HUGγ) against CG8795 and CG5911b reflect genuine biological phenomena. Evidence in support of this comes from Roos and colleagues (22Meng X. Wahlstrom G. Immonen T. Kolmer M. Tirronen M. Predel R. Kalkkinen N. Heino T. Sariola H. Roos C. Mech. Dev. 2002; 117: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), who showed that ectopic expression of the hugingene produced lethal ecdysis defects. The mammalian peptides neuromedin and TRH, the receptors of which are related phylogenetically to CG5911, also activate CG5911b, albeit at relatively high concentrations. The significant bioactivity of these peptides, with the complete absence of responses to neurotensin and ghrelin (assayed at 10 μm), strongly support our phylogenetic analysis, which indicates that CG5911 evolved from a GPCR ancestral to the NMU/TRH receptors. Myomodulin (PMSMLRLamide), a neuropeptide first identified in molluscs, also was found to activate CG5911b. We were unable to find myomodulin-like peptides in the Drosophila genomic data base, but a similar sequence occurs in the Caenorhabditis elegans data base (Y45F10A.5). 3Y. Park and M. E. Adams, unpublished data. Myomodulin could play an analogous role to ETH in nematodes, which with the arthropods have been newly classified in the Ecdysozoa (23Aguinaldo A.M. Turbeville J.M. Linford L.S. Rivera M.C. Garey J.R. Raff R.A. Lake J.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). Indeed, antibodies raised against myomodulin cross-react with ETHs in endocrine Inka cells (24O'Brien M.A. Taghert P.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 193-209PubMed Google Scholar), indicating structural similarities between these peptides. During preparation of this manuscript, independent evidence appeared to support the hypothesis that CG5911 functions as the ETH receptor (25Iversen A. Cazzamali G. Williamson M. Hauser F. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These findings confirm that two functional subtypes of CG5911 are produced by alternative splicing and that ETH1 is a more potent agonist against both receptors. These authors (25Iversen A. Cazzamali G. Williamson M. Hauser F. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) also demonstrated the presence of an additional 5′-untranslated exon. However, our results demonstrate a higher sensitivity of CG5911 to both ligands and a considerably greater divergence in receptor sensitivity between the two subtypes. These findings could indicate that CG5911a and CG5911b interact with different G proteins and may activate different signal transduction pathways. Our pharmacological and phylogenetic analyses also indicate that ETH and the pyrokinin/CAP2b groups of insect neuropeptides constitute a set of ligands that have evolved with CG5911 and the neuromedin U group of vertebrate receptors and their respective ligands. In summary, we have demonstrated that alternative splice variants ofCG5911 encode two functional receptor subtypes of ETH receptor in Drosophila. Although further work is necessary to confirm their physiological roles in natural ETH signaling, the pronounced ligand sensitivity and specificity of CG5911 gene products along with the phylogenetic relationships of CG5911to both Drosophila and mammalian receptors for PRX amide peptides provide strong evidence for their roles as the physiological ETH receptors.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of this infection, and antibiotics have been used to treat the infection since the 1940s. Although Isoniazid (isonicotinic acid hydrazide, INH) is still one of the most effective antibiotics against tuberculosis (2Robitzek E.H. Selikoff I.J. Am. Rev. Tuberc. 1952; 65: 402-410PubMed Google Scholar), the number of INH and other drug-resistant strains has increased dramatically. Outbreaks of multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis make the solution of this worldwide health problem even more urgent. The mechanism of action of INH is not fully understood, but it has been clearly demonstrated that the catalase-peroxidase of M. tuberculosis, encoded by the katG gene, is required for bacterial sensitivity to INH (3Zhang Y.

Acta. 1991; 1080: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) though structural and mechanistic differences from this class of enzymes continue to emerge from spectroscopic and functional studies. For example, an unstable but catalytically competent oxyferryl iron-protoporphyrin IX:π-cation radical intermediate (Cmpd I) is formed in KatG and reacts with INH (20Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), whereas Cmpd II has not been identified in reactions of Cmpd I with single electron reducing substrates including INH, ascorbate, or ferrocyanide (20Chouchane S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, INH activation by KatG can proceed at least in part via a classical mechanism requiring the formation of Cmpd I (20Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S.

The replacement of amino acid Ser-315 in KatG is one of the most commonly encountered substitutions in clinical INH-resistant strains (5Rouse D.A. DeVito J.A. Li Z. Byer H. Morris S.L. Mol.

For example, more than half of INH-resistant clinical isolates carry the mutation S315T, which usually results in a 20–200-fold increase in minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for INH in vivo. The KatG[S315T] mutant strain is virulent in the mouse model, indicating that this frequent mutation does not result in a significant loss of bacterial fitness, nor does this mutation lead to a major loss of catalase activity or peroxidase activity measured with artificial substrates in vitro(32Saint-Joanis B.

Tomlinson A.J. Benson L.M. Naylor S. Kline B.C. Cockerill III, F.R. Rusnak F. J. Infect. Dis. 1997; 176: 722-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) showed that it was only moderately less efficient than WT KatG in reaction mixtures to which no peroxide or other initiator of peroxidase activity was added, and this mutant was more significantly defective in INH oxidation compared with WT KatG in a reaction pathway initiated by superoxide generated in the presence of ferric enzyme but not with addition oft-butylhydroperoxide (35Wengenack N.L. Hoard H.M. Rusnak F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9748-9749Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The latter study pointed toward a faulty reaction between ferric KatG[S315T] and superoxide as the origin of INH resistance. In another study, a subtle change in INH binding to KatG[S315T] was suggested, yet equivalent binding sites for INH in KatG[S315T] and WT KatG were suggested from NMR relaxation data (36Wengenack N.L. Todorovic S. Yu L. Rusnak F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15825-15834Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 37Todorovic S. Juranic N. Macura S. Rusnak F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 10962-10966Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Here, our approach to the problem of understanding INH resistance relies on examination of both the interaction between the resting KatG[S315T] enzyme and the drug and the reaction of the drug with catalytically competent enzyme intermediates such as Cmpd I. In this paper, we report on the generation of the mutant enzyme KatG[S315T], its overexpression, purification, and characterization. Biochemical and spectroscopic studies using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and optical stopped-flow spectrophotometry, as well as isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements, were used to determine the consequences of the mutation and the special role of Ser-315 in enzyme function. Our results suggest that a dramatic change in INH binding in KatG[S315T] is a major component in the loss of function under conditions relevant to use of this antibiotic for TB therapy. INH (Sigma-Aldrich) was re-crystallized from methanol before use. PAA (Sigma-Aldrich) (32%) was diluted to 10 mm in potassium phosphate buffer and was incubated with 780 units/ml catalase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 4 h at 37 °C to remove hydrogen peroxide, followed by removal of the enzyme by ultrafiltration. Restriction nucleases, polynucleotide kinase, DNA ligase, and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase were obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc. Other chemicals and reagents, including LB medium, were purchased from Fisher Scientific. Phagemid pBluescript II KS+ (pKS II+) from Stratagene was used for cloning, mutagenesis, and sequencing. The plasmid pKAT II (a gift from Stewart Cole, Institut Pasteur, Paris) was used as an overexpression vector for KatG (18Johnsson K. Froland W.A. Schultz P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2834-2840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and as the source of the katG gene that was cloned into pKS II+ to generate pSY15 used for mutagenesis. E. coli strain DH5α (F−, φ80dlacZDM15D[lacZYA-argF]U169deoRrecA1endA1hsdR17(rk−, mk+)phoAsupE441−thi-1gyrA96relA1) was used as a host for the plasmids and cloning procedures, and BMH71–18 mutS (thi, supE, Δ(lac-proAB), [mutS::Tn10][F′,proA+B+,lacIqZΔM15]) was used in the mutagenesis step (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). E. colistrain UM262 (recA katG::Tn10 pro leu rpsL hsdM hsdR endl lacY) (38Loewen P.C. Switala J. Smolenski M. Triggs-Raine B.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was the host for overexpression. Mutagenesis was performed using the Transformer™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The 1.0-kb ClaI-XhoI fragment of the katGgene was subcloned into the pKS II+ vector in two steps to generate pSY15 in which site-directed mutagenesis was performed. The mutagenesis primer was CGATCACCACCGGCATCGAGGT (S315T); the selection primer was CTGTGACTGGTGAGATCTCAACCAAGTC. A unique restriction site (ScaI) was replaced with a new unique restriction site (BglII). Bold sequence represents mutagenized bases whereas the underlined portions represent the restriction enzyme site after conversion. Sequencing of double-stranded plasmid DNA by the Sanger method (39Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) was used to confirm the desired nucleotide substitution (Gene Link, Inc., Hawthorne, NY). The confirmed mutated katG insert was excised from the pKS II+ vector using NheI andXhoI endonucleases. This NheI-XhoI fragment containing the mutation was ligated to the pKATII vector to replace the corresponding wild-type fragment, generating the pSY31 vector. The catalase-peroxidases (KatG and mutant KatG[S315T]) used in this study were isolated and purified from an overexpression system in E. coli UM262 strain carrying pKAT II or pSY31 vectors. Bacteria were grown in LB medium plus ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 28 °C, in 0.5- or 1-liter flasks. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 3-β-indoleacrylic acid (40 mg/l) when the optical density of cultures reached 0.9∼1. Delta-aminolevulinic acid (150 μm) was added to cultures to maximize the yield of holoenzyme (20Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 6–18 h post-induction. Purification followed a published procedure using 20 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, instead of TEA-Cl buffer throughout (17Marcinkeviciene J.A. Magliozzo R.S. Blanchard J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22290-22295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Optical purity ratios (A407/A280) were ∼0.6 for WT KatG and 0.45 for KatG[S315T]. Protein concentration was determined using the heme extinction ε407 nm = 100 mm−1cm−1. Catalase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by following the decrease in H2O2 concentration at 240 nm (ε = 43.6m−1cm−1). One unit of catalase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that decomposes 1 μmol of H2O2 in 1 min in a 25 mmH2O2 solution at pH 7.2 at 25 °C (32Saint-Joanis B. Souchon H. Wilming M. Johnsson K. Alzari P.M. Cole S.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Peroxidase activity was also assayed spectrophotometrically by following the absorbance change for 0.1 mmo-dianisidine in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, in the presence of 23 mmt-BOOH (ε460 = 11.33 mm−1cm−1 for the dianisidine oxidation product) at 25 °C (17Marcinkeviciene J.A. Magliozzo R.S. Blanchard J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22290-22295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). One unit of peroxidase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of product/min. Spectrophotometric measurements were obtained using an NT14 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Aviv Associates, Lakewood, NJ). SDS gel electrophoresis was carried out under denaturating (SDS-PAGE) and non-denaturating conditions using an Amersham BiosciencesPhastGel system. A double mixing stopped-flow apparatus (HiTech Scientific Model SF-61DX2) was used to measure optical spectra during Cmpd I formation from resting (ferric) enzyme and for the reaction of Cmpd I with INH. Data acquisition and analysis utilized Kinet-Asyst software (HiTech Scientific), and all reactions were performed in potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, at 25 °C, as described by Chouchane et al. (20Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Isothermal titration calorimetry was performed using a MicroCal VP ITC calorimeter. Baseline correction, peak integration, and dilution corrections were performed using the ORIGIN analysis software supplied with the instrument. WT KatG and KatG[S315T] samples were prepared in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Substrate solutions were prepared in the same buffer to ensure minimal background from buffer mismatch. Reliable titration data were obtained using 20 μm enzyme in the sample cell (1.4 ml) and an INH concentration in the ligand delivery syringe that gave an INH-to-heme ratio of either 1.4:1 or 30:1 (for KatG[S315T] only) at the end of the titration. Typically, 20 injections (10 μl per injection) were made at 12–15-min intervals, and the heat of reaction per injection (microcalories per second) was determined by integration of the peak areas. Heat of dilution of INH was separately determined by injection of INH into buffer only and was subtracted from the observed heat of binding prior to data analysis. The Origin software provided the best-fit values of H (enthalpy of binding), the stoichiometry of binding (n) per mole of heme, and the dissociation constant (Kd) from plots of heat evolved per mole of substrate injected versus the drug/heme molar ratio. EPR spectra were recorded at X-band with a Varian E-12 spectrometer equipped with a liquid helium cryostat and Heli-Tran liquid helium transfer system (Advanced Research Systems, Inc., Allentown, PA) for recording spectra below 77 K. WinEPR software was used for data acquisition (20Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Rapid freeze-quench EPR sample preparation was performed using an Update Instrument, Inc. MODEL1000 chemical-freeze quench apparatus according to a published procedure (21Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The KatG[S315T] protein used in these studies was produced inE. coli using an overexpression system carrying the mutatedM. tuberculosis katG gene. The purified mutant enzyme consistently exhibited a reduced optical purity ratio compared with WT KatG purified under identical conditions (A407/A280 = 0.45 (mutant) versus 0.60 (WT)). One reason for this could be the presence of heme-deficient enzyme. We reported previously (20Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) that WT KatG isolated and purified after overexpression in E. coli grown in LB medium, in the absence of the heme biosynthetic precursor δ-aminolevulinic acid (δ-ALA), contains a nearly equal yield of heme-deficient enzyme and holoenzyme, whereas in the presence of δ-ALA, the heme-deficient enzyme is eliminated. For KatG[S315T] grown in LB medium without δ-ALA, the yield of holoenzyme was extremely low at best. A notable improvement in yield of holoenzyme was found after growth in the presence of δ-ALA, though purified KatG[S315T] still had a low optical purity ratio compared with WT KatG. Also contributing to this lower optical ratio is the greater abundance of 5-c heme in the purified mutant enzyme, in which conversion to 6-c enzyme is less extensive than in WT KatG (see below). The 6-c enzyme formed by coordination of a molecule of water to heme iron has a higher Soret extinction coefficient than 5-c enzyme. This is reflected in the optical purity ratio for the wild-type enzyme, which ranges from 0.55 in samples containing mostly 5-c heme, to 0.65 or greater in samples containing a majority of 6-c heme (40Chouchane S. Girotto S. Kapetanaki S. Schelvis J.P.M. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8154-8162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The purity ratio for KatG[S315T] ranges from 0.44 to 0.46 in our preparations, which contain mostly 5-c heme; therefore, assuming that the extinction coefficients for 5-c heme in WT and mutant enzymes are the same, and that the optical purity ratio for the purified mutant should also be 0.55, 18% of the purified mutant enzyme lacks heme. Because enzyme concentrations and activities are calculated based on heme active site concentration rather than total enzyme, the apoenzyme is not accounted for in our experiments on KatG[S315T]. The apoenzyme would not be expected to contribute catalase or peroxidase activity, which resides solely in the heme cofactor according to inhibition by cyanide and azide (17Marcinkeviciene J.A. Magliozzo R.S. Blanchard J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22290-22295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition to the difference in optical purity ratio, a small red shift of the Soret maximum (1–2 nm) and a blue shift of the CT1 band (645 versus 635) were usually noted in the purified mutant compared with WT KatG (see Fig. 1 and Table I). These small differences are also consistent with a low abundance of 6-c heme in purified KatG[S315T].Table ICatalatic and peroxidatic activities and second-order rate constants for Cmpd I formation in WT KatG and KatG[S315T]WT KatGKatG[S315T]Catalase activity1-aDetermined spectrophotometrically (H2O2 consumption) in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, at 25°C (32).

Li Z. Byer H. Morris S.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 32Saint-Joanis B. Souchon H. Wilming M. Johnsson K. Alzari P.M. Cole S.T. Biochem.

Because these steady state measurements do not provide insight into the kinetics of the separate reactions in the multi-step catalytic cycles, optical stopped-flow experiments were pursued. KatG[S315T] maintains significant levels of catalytic activity. Therefore, formation of Cmpd I and/or other peroxidase intermediates was considered important to investigate, especially in the context of potential INH resistance mechanisms. We reported previously (20Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 22Yu S. Chouchane S. Magliozzo R.S. Protein. Sci. 2002; 11: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) second order rate constants for formation of Cmpd I in WT KatG and another mutant (KatG[W321F]) using various peroxides and also reported that INH reacted with this intermediate in KatG and HRP. Examination of the formation of Cmpd I in the mutant KatG[S315T] revealed some interesting differences from the wild-type enzyme. For example, neither CPBA (up to 5 mm) nor t-BOOH (250–500 mm) gave a detectable yield in conversion of the resting mutant enzyme to Cmpd I under conditions clearly shown to produce this intermediate in WT KatG. Evidence for Cmpd I formation was only demonstrated in reactions of KatG[S315T] (10 μm) with PAA (30–100 μm), evidenced by a decreased Soret intensity and characteristic features in the visible region (peaks at 550 and 590 nm, along with a shoulder at 655 nm). Fig. 2shows optical stopped-flow data for 10 μm KatG[S315T] mixed with 100 μm PAA (similar changes but with lower yield of Cmpd I were obtained using 3-fold or 5-fold excess PAA). The apparent yield of Cmpd I did not increase using higher concentrations of PAA. The total initial Soret absorbance decrease for the mutant is smaller than that observed for WT KatG under similar conditions, possibly because of differences in extinction coefficients for both resting enzyme and Cmpd I in these two enzymes under the conditions used here. Similar to WT KatG Cmpd I, KatG[S315T] Cmpd I"

https://openalex.org/W2095447228,"Here we describe the Achilles' Heel Method (AHM), a new function-based approach for identification of inhibitors of signaling pathways, optimized for human cells. The principle of AHM is the identification of ‘sensitizing’ cDNAs based on their decreased abundance following selection. As a proof of principle, we have employed AHM for the identification of Fas/CD95/APO-1 pathway inhibitors. HeLa cells were transfected with an antisense cDNA expression library in an episomal vector followed by selection with a suboptimal dose of the apoptotic inducer. Antisense inactivation of Fas inhibitors rendered the cells more sensitive to apoptosis resulting in their preferential death and consequent loss of their sensitizing episomes that were identified by subtraction. We show that the resulting products were enriched for sensitizing cDNAs as seven out of eight candidates tested were confirmed as inhibitors of Fas-induced killing either by transfection or by pharmacological inhibition. Furthermore, we demonstrate by multiple approaches that one candidate, NF-E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2), is an inhibitor of Fas-induced apoptosis. Inactivation of Nrf2 by antisense or by a membrane permeable dominant-negative polypeptide sensitized cells while overexpression of Nrf2 protected cells from Fas-induced apoptosis. In addition, dicumarol, an inhibitor of the phase II detoxifying enzyme NQO1, a downstream target of Nrf2, sensitized cells. Nrf2 induces the production of Glutathione (GSH) and we demonstrated that N-acetyl L-cysteine (NAC), a precursor to GSH, protected cells from Fas-mediated killing. Taken together, AHM is a powerful approach for the identification of inhibitors of a signaling pathway with a low rate of false positives that opens new avenues for function profiling of human genes and discovery of new drug targets."

These receptors are coupled distinctly (via Gq-, Gi-, G12/13-, and Rho-dependent routes) to multiple downstream signaling pathways including those associated with adenylate cyclase, MAP kinase, phospholipases C and D, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (2Pyne S.

Once formed, S1P is rapidly cleaved by S1P lyase to hexadecenal and phosphoethanolamine or dephosphorylated by S1P phosphohydrolase (Fig. 1). Hence, intracellular S1P levels are determined by the balance of Sph kinase-mediated synthesis and its degradation by S1P lyase or S1P phosphohydrolase. Platelets, which possess high Sph kinase activity and lack S1P lyase activity, accumulate S1P abundantly (6Yatomi Y. Igarashi Y. Yang L. Hisano N. Qi R. Asazuma N. Satoh K. Ozaki Y. Kume S. J.

Identical to S1P but lacking the 4,5-transdouble bond, another sphingolipid biosynthesis intermediate dihydrosphingosine (dihydro-Sph) can also be phosphorylated by Sph kinase to dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate (dihydro-S1P). Dihydro-S1P binds to Edg receptors and activates them, yet does not mimic other effects of S1P such as cell survival (7Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O.

Cell. 1978; 15: 393-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). PrE cells express several specific markers such as tissue plasminogen activator, Type IV collagen, c-jun, cytokeratin ENDO A, and Disabled-2 (Dab2)/DOC-2 (15Strickland S. Mahdavi V.

To investigate the role of mouse S1P lyase (SPL) as well as that of intracellular S1P in the differentiation processes, we have generatedSPL knockout F9 cells by homologous recombination. TheSPL−/− cells possess no S1P lyase activity and accumulate intracellular S1P and dihydro-S1P. RA-induced PrE differentiation of the SPL−/−cells was accelerated compared with the wild-type cells. Moreover, expression of SPL as well as Sph kinase activity was up-regulated by RA treatment. These results suggest that SPL and intracellular S1P play roles in PrE differentiation. Mouse F9 EC cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (D6429; Sigma) containing 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 0.1% gelatin-coated dishes. For differentiation experiments, 1 μm all-trans-RA (Sigma) and 250 μm bt2cAMP (Sigma) were added to the medium. The SPL genomic fragments were obtained by PCR using F9 genomic DNA as follows. The SPL genomic regions corresponding to exons 7–9 (2.1 kb), exons 9–11 (2.4 kb), exons 11–12 (0.6 kb), and exons 12–14 (1.8 kb) were amplified using the primers (5′-GGCGTTAGAGAAGGGGATCAAAACTCC-3′ and 5′-GCATAGCTGTGTTCCTGGAGATGGC-3′, 5′-GCCATCTCCAGGAACACAGCTATGC-3′ and 5′-CCAGGCCGTGAGCCAGCTATGCTTGG-3′, 5′-CCAAGCATAGCTGGCTCACGGCCTGG-3′ and 5′-CGGTAAATGTCAAAATCGTTGGATCCC-3′, and 5′-GGGATCCAACGATTTTGACATTTACCG-3′ and 5′-CCTGTCAATGGTTGCCTGGGCCATGCC-3′, respectively), and these were then connected. The targeting vectors (targeting vector Neo and targeting vector Puro) were constructed by replacing a 105-bp fragment corresponding to the middle of exon 9 to the ScaI site in intron 9 with loxP site-flanked neomycin-resistant gene and puromycin-resistant gene, respectively (Fig. 2A). The internal ribosome entry site of the encephalomyocarditis virus, which permits the translation of two open reading frames from one mRNA (22Jackson R.J. Howell M.T. Kaminski A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 477-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), was inserted upstream of the loxP site-flanked puromycin-resistant gene in the targeting vector Puro. pcDNA3-HA1, a derivative of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), was constructed to create an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged gene. pCE-puro, a derivative of pCI-neo (Promega), was designed for protein expression under the control of the human elongation factor 1α promoter. For this construction, the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter of pCI-neo was first replaced by the human elongation factor 1α promoter from pCE-FL (a gift from S. Sugano; Tokyo University) by N. Mizushima (National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan) to generate pCE-neo. Then the neomycin-resistant gene was replaced by the puromycin-resistant gene from pPGKpurobpA to generate pCE-puro. The SPL cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-AGATCTCCCGGAACCGACCTCCTCAAGC-3′ and 5′-GTGTGCAGTCTGTTCCAAACGCC-3′ and F9 total cDNA as a template. The amplified fragments were cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) to generate pGEM-SPL plasmid. The pcDNA3-HA-SPL plasmid, which encodes N-terminally HA-tagged SPL, was constructed by cloning the 1.8 kb of the BglII-NotI fragment of pGEM-SPL into the BamHI-NotI site of pcDNA3-HA1. pCE-puro HA-SPL was then constructed by cloning of theHA-SPL region of pcDNA3-HA-SPL into the pCE-puro plasmid. The pcDNA3-HA-SPHK1a, which encodes N-terminally HA-tagged mouse Sph kinase 1a (SPHK1a), was constructed by cloning of the 1.2 kb of theBamHI-EcoRI fragment of pcDNA3-FLAG-SPHK1a (23Murate T. Banno Y., T- Koizumi K. Watanabe K. Mori N. Wada A. Igarashi Y. Takagi A. Kojima T. Asano H. Akao Y. Yoshida S. Saito H. Nozawa Y. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) into the BamHI-EcoRI site of pcDNA3-HA1. pCE-puro HA-SPHK1a was then constructed by cloning of theHA-SPHK1a region of pcDNA3 HA-SPHK1a into the pCE-puro plasmid. The linearized targeting vector Neo (1 μg) was transfected into 4 × 105 F9 cells using LipofectAMINETM 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were subjected to G418 selection at 900 μg/ml for 1 week. Homologous recombination was examined by PCR amplification of genomic DNA using primer A (5′-GTGACTTCTGGGGGAACGGAAAGC-3′), located in exon 7 but outside the genomic sequences present in the targeting vector, and primer B (5′-ATCGGAATTCCTCGAGTCTAGAGCG-3′), located upstream of theloxP site (Fig. 2A). For isolation of F9SPL−/− cells, the heterozygous clone (F9-1) was transfected with the linearized targeting vector Puro (1 μg). Cells were then cultured in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml puromycin for 8 days. Genomic DNAs were prepared from resistant clones, and homologous recombination was examined by PCR using primer C (5′-GCCATCTCCAGGAACACAGCTATGC-3′), located in exon 9, and primer D (5′-CCAGGCCGTGAGCCAGCTATGCTTGG-3′), located in exon 11. One of the puromycin-resistant clones, F9-2, exhibited anSPL−/− genotype. F9-4 (SPL+/+, neomycin- and puromycin-resistant) cells were obtained in the course of this targeting procedure. To obtain stable transformants of the HA-SPHK1a gene, the pCE-puro HA-SPHK1a plasmid (1 μg) was transfected into 4 × 105 F9 cells using LipofectAMINETM 2000 reagent. Cells were subjected to puromycin selection at 0.5 μg/ml for 1 week. One of the stable transformants, F9-9, expressed the highest level of HA-SPHK1a among the isolated clones and was used for further analyses. F9 total RNA, isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), was converted to cDNA using oligo(dT) primer and ProSTARTM first strand RT-PCR kit (Stratagene). The SPL cDNA was amplified by PCR using primer E (5′-CCCGGAACCGACCTCCTCAAGCTGAAGG-3′), primer F (5′-GTGTGCAGTCTGTTCCAAACGCC-3′), and F9 total cDNA as a template. Anti-SPL antiserum was raised against recombinant full-length SPL proteins expressed as hexahistidine-tagged fusion proteins. Anti-Dab2, anti-HA Y-11, and anti-actin (A-2066) antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and Sigma, respectively. Cells suspended in buffer A (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 mm dithiothreitol) were lysed by sonication and subjected to in vitro S1P lyase assay as described previously (24Van Veldhoven P.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 244-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For use as a substrate, [4,5-3H]dihydro-S1P was prepared by phosphorylation of [4,5-3H]dihydro-Sph (50 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemical Inc.) using recombinant maltose-binding protein-fused mouse SPHK1a. After the reaction, lipids were extracted by successive additions of a 3.75-fold volume of chloroform/methanol/HCl (100:200:1, v/v/v), a 1.25-fold volume of chloroform, and a 1.25-fold volume of 1% KCl, with mixing. Phases were then separated by centrifugation, and the organic phase was recovered, dried, and suspended in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The labeled lipids were resolved by TLC on Silica Gel 60 high performance TLC plates (Merck) with 1-butanol/acetic acid/water (3:1:1, v/v/v). The Sph kinase assay was performed as described previously (25Olivera A. Kohama T. Tu Z. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12576-12583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with PBS twice, suspended in buffer A, and sonicated. After centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was treated with an equal volume of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and incubated for 20 min at 0 °C. Protein precipitates were washed with acetone and suspended in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS). After quantification of protein concentrations using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), samples were diluted with equal volumes of 2× SDS sample buffer (125 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, and a trace amount of bromphenol blue). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to ImmobilonTM polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). The resulting membrane was incubated with primary antibody (anti-SPL antiserum, anti-Dab2 antibodies, or anti-HA Y-11 antibodies, each diluted 1:1000; or anti-actin antibodies, diluted 1:200) for 1 h and then with secondary antibody (peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)2fragment or sheep anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 fragment, both from Amersham Biosciences, and diluted 1:7500) for 1 h. Labeling was detected by the ECL detection method (Amersham Biosciences). [3-3H]S1P was prepared by phosphorylation of [3-3H]Sph (23.5 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using recombinant maltose-binding protein-fused mouse SPHK1a. Cells at ∼70% confluence in six-well dishes were incubated with 1 ml/well medium containing 0.8 μCi of [3-3H]Sph plus cold Sph (total 100 pmol of Sph) or 0.8 μCi of [3-3H]S1P plus cold S1P (total 100 pmol), which had been complexed with 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma catalog no. A-6003), for 1 h at 37 °C. Lipids were extracted and separated by TLC as described above. Intracellular amounts of S1P and dihydro-S1P were measured by HPLC as described previously (26Min J.K. Yoo H.S. Lee E.Y. Lee W.J. Lee Y.M. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 303: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). F9 cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS at 37 °C for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, blocked with blocking solution (10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS), and incubated at room temperature for 30 min with Alexa FluorTM 488 phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Cells were washed, mounted with Slow Fade Light Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes), and observed under a fluorescence microscope (Axiophot 2 Plus; Carl Zeiss) with a plane-APOCHROMAT lens (×63) (Carl Zeiss). To inactivate theSPL gene, we constructed targeting vectors for homologous recombination. To obtain genomic information about the SPLgene, the mouse genome data base MGSCV3 was searched using the BLAST program. We found that the Mus musculus WGS supercontig Mm10_WIFeb01_211 (accession number NW_000027) contains the SPL gene. This sequence data revealed that theSPL gene is located on chromosome 10, and the open reading frame consists of 14 exons. Based on this sequence information, we obtained a SPL genomic fragment that corresponds to exons 7–14. We constructed two targeting vectors in which exon 9 was replaced by a loxP site-flanked neomycin-resistant gene (targeting vector Neo) or a puromycin-resistant gene (targeting vector Puro) (Fig. 2A). We utilized a promoter selection strategy (i.e. selection markers lacking their promoters and transcribed under the control of the SPL promoter only when properly targeted). To facilitate internal translation of the puromycin-resistant gene, we introduced an internal ribosome entry site upstream of the puromycin-resistant gene in the targeting vector Puro. The SPL protein is a PLP-dependent enzyme and contains a conserved pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylase domain positioned from amino acid 167 to amino acid 452 (Fig. 2A). In a PLP-dependent enzyme, PLP exists as a Schiff base with its aldehyde group forming an imine linkage with the ε-amino group of a lysine residue. In SPL, Lys-353 is predicted to be the Schiff base-forming residue. Since Lys-353 is encoded within exon 10, the disruption of exon 9 was expected to render the C-terminally truncated SPL completely inactive. To target the first allele of the SPL gene, F9 cells were transfected with the targeting vector Neo. One of the neomycin-resistant clones, named F9-1, showed aSPL+/− genotype confirmed by PCR (data not shown) using its genomic DNA and primers A and B shown in Fig.2A. F9-1 cells were then transfected with the targeting vector Puro, and a clone containing the second targeted SPLallele (named F9-2) was isolated. Fig. 2B shows the result of PCR analysis using the genomic DNA, primer C located in exon 9, and primer D located in exon 11. Although only a 2.4-kb fragment was amplified from genomic DNA prepared from F9 cells (Fig. 2B,lane 1), both a 2.4-kb and a 3.8-kb DNA fragment were detected in PCR products from F9-1 cells (Fig. 2B,lane 2). On the other hand, a 3.8-kb fragment and a faint 4.8-kb fragment were amplified from genomic DNA of F9-2 cells, but the 2.4-kb fragment was not detected (Fig. 2B,lane 3). RT-PCR analysis demonstrated the loss ofSPL mRNA in F9-2 cells (Fig. 2C). Next, we prepared an antibody against recombinant full-length mouse SPL to detect the SPL protein. Fig. 2D shows the immunoblotting analysis of the total lysates prepared from F9 cells transfected withHA-SPL cDNA. The anti-SPL antiserum, as well as anti-HA antibodies, revealed that the HA-SPL protein migrated slightly faster (59 kDa) than the predicted molecular mass (65.0 kDa) (Fig.2D, lanes 2 and 4). The lysates of the vector transfectant did not produce this band (Fig.2D, lanes 1 and 3). The anti-SPL antiserum also detected the endogenous SPL protein in the lysates of the vector- and HA-SPL cDNA-transfected and untransfected F9 cells as a 58-kDa band (Fig. 2D,lanes 1, 2, and 5). However, the SPL protein was reduced in F9-1 (mSPL+/−) cells and was absent in F9-2 (mSPL−/−) cells (Fig. 2D,lanes 6 and 7). Above all, these results confirmed the proper targeting in F9-2 cells. In the course of the targeting experiments, we also obtained F9 cells resistant to both neomycin and puromycin but carrying an intact SPL gene. We used these cells (F9-4), which always exhibited the same phenotype as original F9 cells, as a wild-type control for further analyses as indicated. To investigate the S1P lyase activity in theSPL−/− cells, we performed an in vitro S1P lyase assay using total cell lysates and [4,5-3H]dihydro-S1P. Wild-type cell lysates converted dihydro-S1P to hexadecanal in a time-dependent manner (Fig.2E, lanes 1 and 2), also generating dihydro-Sph by the action of the phosphohydrolase. In contrast, lysates from SPL−/− cells converted dihydro-S1P only to dihydro-Sph and displayed no S1P lyase activity (Fig. 2E, lanes 3 and 4), indicating that SPL is the sole S1P lyase in F9 cells. We next examined the intracellular accumulation of S1P using exogenously added [3-3H]Sph. After a 1-h incubation with [3-3H]Sph, lipids were extracted and separated by TLC. Wild-type cells accumulated only a small amount of S1P and converted most of the Sph to ceramide and sphingomyelin (Fig. 2F,lane 1). The SPL−/−cells showed an increased accumulation of S1P by 3.4-fold compared with wild-type cells, whereas conversion to ceramide and sphingomyelin in the SPL−/− cells was indistinguishable from that in wild-type cells (Figs. 2, F and G). Next, we measured steady-state levels of S1P and dihydro-S1P using HPLC. TheSPL−/− cells showed an increase in intracellular S1P (about 2-fold) and dihydro-S1P (about 2.5-fold) compared with the SPL+/+ cells (Fig.2H; see also Fig. 7E). We examined the effect of SPL gene disruption on cell growth and morphology. The growth rate ofSPL−/− cells was only slightly reduced compared with that of wild-type cells (data not shown). The morphology of SPL−/− cells was indistinguishable from that of wild-type cells (data not shown). Recently, it was reported that S1P lyase has a central role in the development of D. discoideum (10Li G. Foote C. Alexander S. Alexander H. Development. 2001; 128: 3473-3483PubMed Google Scholar). With this in mind, we investigated the role of SPL in the differentiation of F9 cells to PrE and, subsequently, PE in the presence of 1 μm RA and 250 μmbt2cAMP. Fig. 3Ashows phase-contrast images and phalloidin-staining patterns of EC, PrE, and PE cells. PrE cells manifest an enlarged and flattened morphology, whereas PE cells exhibit rounded shapes with long cell processes (15Strickland S. Mahdavi V. Cell. 1978; 15: 393-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 20Strickland S. Smith K.K. Marotti K.R. Cell. 1980; 21: 347-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). By day 3 of treatment, all of the wild-type cells had differentiated to a cell type with typical PrE morphology (Fig. 3B), whereas almost no cells (<1%) had differentiated to PE. PE morphology was observed within small areas of the culture at day 4 (5%), and about 78% of the cells had differentiated to PE at day 5 (Fig. 3B). In contrast,SPL−/− cells that had differentiated to exhibit PE morphology could be detected even at day 3 (21%) (Fig.3B). Moreover, most of the SPL−/−cells by day 4 (83%) and day 5 (95%) had differentiated to PE (Fig.3B), further establishing that differentiation to PE was accelerated by the disruption of the SPL gene. It is possible that the accelerated PE differentiation observed in theSPL−/− cells was due to acceleration from EC cells to PrE cells, acceleration from PrE cells to PE cells, or both. To distinguish between these possibilities, we next examined whether differentiation from EC cells to PrE cells was accelerated in theSPL−/− cells, using the differentiation-specific marker Dab2, a candidate tumor suppressor of breast and ovarian tumors (27Mok S.C.

https://openalex.org/W1993958640,"The absence of detectable germline TP53 mutations in a fraction of families with Li–Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) has suggested the involvement of other genes, but this hypothesis remains controversial. The density of Alu repeats within the TP53 gene led us to search genomic rearrangements of TP53 in families without detectable TP53 mutation. To this aim, we adapted the quantitative multiplex PCR of short fluorescent fragments (QMPSF) method to the analysis of the 11 exons of TP53. We analysed 98 families, either fulfilling (six families) or partially meeting (92 families) the criteria for LFS, and in which classical methods had failed to reveal TP53 alterations. We identified, in a large family fulfilling the criteria for LFS, a complete heterozygous deletion of TP53. Additional QMPSF analyses indicated that this deletion, which partially removed the centromeric FLJ10385 locus, covered approximately 45 kb. This deletion was shown to result from a complex rearrangement involving two distinct Alu-mediated recombinations. We conclude that TP53 germline rearrangements occur as rare events, but must be considered in LFS families without detectable point TP53 mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2097416204,"Breast-feeding has been linked to slowed postnatal growth. Although the basis for this ""weanling's dilemma"" is unclear, environmental contaminants in human milk may be of relevance. We studied a Faroese birth cohort of 182 singleton children, born at term in 1994-95. Concentrations of mercury in cord blood and of polychlorinated biphenyls in maternal milk were measured, and duration of breast-feeding was recorded. At 18 months, children who had been exclusively breast-fed for at least 6 months weighed 0.59 kg less [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.03, 1.16 kg] and were 1.50 cm [95% CI = 0.52, 2.47 cm] shorter than those not breast-fed. However, calculated transfer of contaminants from human milk fully explained the attenuated growth. Irrespective of duration of breast-feeding, a doubling of the mercury concentration in cord blood was associated with a decrease in weight at 18 months by 0.19 kg (95% CI = 0.03, 0.35 kg) and in height by 0.26 cm (95% CI = -0.02, 0.55 cm). Weight and height at 42 months showed the same tendencies, but the main effect occurred before 18 months of age. Thus, in communities with increased contaminant exposures, risks associated with lactational transfer of toxicants to the infant must be considered when judging the benefits of prolonged breast-feeding."
https://openalex.org/W2122106118,"Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via store-operated channels (SOCs) following stimulation of the plasma membrane receptors is the key event controlling numerous processes in nonexcitable cells. The human transient receptor potential vanilloid type 6 channel, originally termed Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporter type 1 (CaT1) protein, is one of the promising candidates for the role of endogenous SOC, although investigations of its functions have generated considerable controversy. In order to assess the role of CaT1 in generating endogenous store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> current (<i>I</i><sub>SOC</sub>) in the lymph node carcinoma of the prostate (LNCaP) human prostate cancer epithelial cell line, we manipulated its endogenous levels by means of antisense hybrid depletion or pharmacological up-regulation (antiandrogen treatment) combined with functional evaluation of <i>I</i><sub>SOC</sub>. Antisense hybrid depletion of CaT1 decreased<i>I</i><sub>SOC</sub> in LNCaP cells by ∼50%, whereas enhancement of CaT1 levels by 60% in response to Casodex treatment potentiated <i>I</i><sub>SOC</sub> by 30%. The functional characteristics of <i>I</i><sub>SOC</sub> in LNCaP cells were similar in many respects to those reported for heterologously expressed CaT1, although 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate sensitivity and lack of constitutive current highlighted notable departures. Our results suggest that CaT1 is definitely involved in<i>I</i><sub>SOC</sub>, but it may constitute only a part of the endogenous SOC, which in general may be a heteromultimeric channel composed of homologous CaT1 and other transient receptor potential subunits."

Congo red and thioflavin T binding experiments suggest that the aggregates induced by TFE have properties resembling the amyloid fibrils.

Amyloid fibril formation appears to occur due to coalescence of the protein in the partially structured intermediate state(s) through solvent-exposed non-polar surfaces and intermolecular β-sheet formation among the extended, linear β-strands in the protein. 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol newt acidic fibroblast growth factor thioflavin T 1-anilino-8-napthalene sulfonate heteronuclear single quantum coherence Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy Protein aggregation is a problem of importance not only in biotechnology but also in health-related industries (1Chan W.

Recently, Bucciantini et al. (27Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formgli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M.

Therefore, it is now increasingly believed that amyloid represents a generic form of polypeptide conformation, and all peptides/proteins have the potential to form amyloid-like fibrils under appropriate conditions (21Fandrich M.

Recent studies on proteins such as transthyretin (16Kelly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 930-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 25Lai Z. Colon W. Kelly J.W.

The partially structured intermediate state(s) is postulated to associate into oligomers and subsequently undergo structural rearrangement to form amyloid-like fibrils (8Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 355-407Crossref Scopus (1413) Google Scholar, 16Kelly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 930-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, very little information exists on the conformational features of the “amyloid-prone” partially structured intermediate state(s). In the present study, we investigate the TFE-induced conformational transitions in a β-barrel protein such as the newt acidic fibroblast growth factor (nFGF-1, Refs. 31Arunkumar A.I. Kumar T.K.S. Kathir K.M. Srisailam S. Wang H.M. Leena P.S.T. Chi Y.H. Chen H.C. Wu C.H. Wu R.T. Chang G.G. Chiu I.M. Yu C.

NMR. 2000; 17: 279-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). TFE is observed to induce amyloid-like fibrils in nFGF-1. The formation of amyloid-like fibrils is triggered by the accumulation of a partially structured intermediate state(s) in the TFE-induced unfolding pathway of nFGF-1. Heparin-Sepharose was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Labeled 15NH4Cl, D2O, and TFE-d3 were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. 1-Anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (magnesium salt), thioflavin T (ThT), and Congo red were purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals used were of high quality analytical grade. Unless otherwise mentioned, all solutions were made in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 100 mm sodium chloride. All experiments were performed at 20 °C. Recombinant nFGF-1 was prepared from transformed Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. The nFGF-1 DNA construct consisting of 486 base pairs was inserted between the NdeI and BamH1 restriction sites. The expressed protein was purified on a heparin-Sepharose affinity column over a NaCl gradient (0–1.5 m). Desalting of the purified protein was achieved by ultra filtration using an Amicon set-up. The purity of the protein was assessed using SDS-PAGE. The first 22 residues of the full form of nFGF-1 were digested by subjecting the expressed full form of nFGF-1 to the action of chymotrypsin. Chymotrypsin digestion was carried out by incubating the column material (heparin-Sepharose containing the bound protein) with the enzyme (at an enzyme to protein ratio of 20:1) in 10 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.85 m NaCl. The incubated mixture was stirred mildly at room temperature for 3 h. The incubated material was repacked into a column and washed with 10 mm phosphate containing 0.85 m NaCl until the absorbance of the eluate plateaued to a steady base line. Truncated nFGF-1 was later eluted with 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 1.5 m NaCl. The homogeneity of the truncated nFGF-1 sample was checked by SDS-PAGE. The authenticity of the truncated sample was verified by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analysis. Protein concentration was estimated based on the extinction co-efficient value of the protein at 280 nm. It should be stated that the truncated newt FGF-1, which we label as nFGF-1, is used in all the experiments described ahead in the present work. 15N isotope labeling was achieved using M9 minimal medium containing15NH4Cl. To maximize expression yields, the composition of the M9 medium was modified by the addition of a mixture of vitamins. The expression host strain, E. coliBL21(DE3)pLysS, is a vitamin B1-deficient host, and hence, the medium was supplemented with thiamine (vitamin B1). Protein expression yields were in the range of 25–30 mg/liter of the isotope-enriched medium. Purification and chymotrypsin digestion methods to obtain truncated nFGF-1 were the same as described in the previous section. The extent of 15N labeling was verified by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analysis. Turbidity measurements were performed on a Hitachi U-3310 spectrophotometer. All measurements were made after 3 h of incubation (at 20 °C) of the protein (nFGF-1) in appropriate concentrations of TFE. The concentration of the protein used in the turbidity experiments was 100 μg/ml. The turbidity of the solutions was measured by absorbance at 350 nm. The path length of the sample cell used was 10 mm. All CD measurements were made on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. CD experiments were performed using a 0.2-cm quartz cell for far (195–250 nm) and 10-cm quartz cell for the near UV CD (250–320) regions. A step size of 0.1 nm, an average time of 3 s, and an average of 10 scans were recorded to generate the data. The concentration of the protein inside was 0.1 mg/ml. The far and near UV CD spectra were smoothed using the noise-reducing option in the software supplied by the vendor (Jasco). The concentration of protein used in these experiments was 100 μg/ml. Protein samples were incubated in various concentrations of TFE for 3 h before the dye (Congo red or thioflavin T) was added. The solutions were stirred upon the addition of the dye. Fluorescence spectra of ThT were measured on a Hitachi F2500 spectrofluorimeter using a quartz cell with a light path of 10 mm. The excitation wavelength was set at 440 nm, and bandwidths for excitation and emission lights were 2.5 and 10 nm, respectively. For the Congo red binding assay, absorption spectra of the samples containing 10 μl of a 1 mm solution of the dye (Congo red) were recorded on a Hitachi U-3310 spectrophotometer in the range of 400–700 nm. Electron micrographs of amyloid fibrils (generated in TFE) of nFGF-1 were acquired on a Hitachi H-7500 transmission electron microscope. A 2-μl sample of the protein at a concentration of about 100 μg was applied to Formvar- and carbon-coated copper grids. The fibrils were washed by the successive addition of 3 wash steps (10-μl aliquots of water) followed by drying with filter paper. The fibrils were stained by the addition of 10 μl of uranyl acetate (1% w/v) and immediately dried with filter paper. The fibers induced in 15% (v/v) TFE were suspended between the ends of 2 wax-filled glass capillaries and allowed to dry. The x-ray scattered image of TFE-induced fibrils were collected using a wavelength 1.11 Å on an off-line image plate detector at BL17B2 of the synchrotron radiation. The specimen was mounted on a 1-mm loop for free standing to avoid the x-ray beam touching any material other than fibrils. The image was processed by using the XPRESS software. Aggregation of nFGF-1 (5 mg/ml) in 15% (v/v) TFE were incubated for about 2 weeks at room temperature to obtain dense fibers. The TFE-induced fibers were repeatedly washed in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 100 mm NaCl, filtered, and dried. For the seeding experiments, various aliquots 100–500 μl of seeding solution (TFE-induced preformed fibrils) of the protein was added to freshly prepared solution (TFE induced preformed fibrils) of the protein. The seeding experiments were carried out with appropriate controls. The first control involved the incubation of an identical solution of nFGF-1 in the absence of the aliquot of the seeding solution, and the second control involved the dilution of an approximate aliquot of the seeding solution into phosphate buffer. The seeding (aggregation) was monitored by the increase in the absorbance at 350 nm. In addition the seeding solution was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy to obtain definite evidence for the existence of fibrils and analyzing their morphology. Fluorescence experiments were performed on a Hitachi F2500 spectrofluorimeter at 2.5- or 10-nm resolution. Intrinsic fluorescence measurements were made at a protein concentration of 100 μg/ml using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. 1-Anilino-8-napthalene sulfonate (ANS) binding experiments were carried out on nFGF-1 at various concentrations of TFE using an excitation wavelength of 390 nm. The emission was monitored between 420 and 600 nm. The concentrations of the dye (ANS) and the protein (nFGF-1) used were 200 μm and 100 μg/ml, respectively. All NMR experiments were performed on Bruker Avance-600 NMR spectrometer at 20 °C. A 5-mm inverse probe with a self-shielded z-gradient was used to obtain all gradient-enhanced 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra. 15N decoupling during acquisition was accomplished using the globally optimized alternating-phase rectangular pulse sequence. 2048 complex data points were collected in the 1H,15N HSQC experiments. 512 complex data points were collected in the15N dimension. The HSQC spectra were recorded at 32 scans at all concentrations of TFE. The concentration of the protein sample was 0.5 mm in 95% H2O and 5% D2O (containing 100 mm phosphate and 100 mm sodium chloride). 15N chemical shifts were referenced using the consensus ratio of 0.01013291189. All spectra were processed on a Silicon Graphics work station using XWINNMR and AURELIA software. The samples for the FT-IR spectral measurements were prepared as follows. Protein aggregates formed in 15% (v/v) TFE (at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml) were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm using a desktop centrifuge for 20 min, and the supernatant was removed carefully. The precipitant was dried overnight in a vacuum desiccator. The dry powder of the aggregates was enclosed in a KBr tablet by a conventional high pressure method. FT-IR spectra of nFGF-1 at 0% (v/v) and 70% (v/v) TFE were acquired by dissolving the protein in 99% D2O containing appropriate concentrations of TFE-d3. All spectra were recorded with a wave number resolution of 2 cm−1. For each spectrum, 64–200 interferograms were collected and averaged, and a Happ-Genzel apodization function was applied before Fourier transformation. All processing procedures were carried out so as to optimize the quality of the spectrum in the amide I region, between 1600 and 1700 cm−1. nFGF-1 is a ∼15-kDa, all β-sheet protein with no disulfide bonds (31Arunkumar A.I. Kumar T.K.S. Kathir K.M. Srisailam S. Wang H.M. Leena P.S.T. Chi Y.H. Chen H.C. Wu C.H. Wu R.T. Chang G.G. Chiu I.M. Yu C. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1050-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The protein lacks helical segments, and the secondary structural elements include 12 β-strands arranged into a β-barrel architecture (Fig. 1). The original objective of this study was to investigate the specificity/non-specificity of the helix-inducing effect(s) of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol. In this context, we monitored the secondary structural changes in nFGF-1 at various concentrations of TFE using far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The far-UV CD spectrum of nFGF-1 (200–250 nm) shows two prominent ellipticity bands (a positive ellipticity band at 228 nm and an intense minimum at around 205 nm) characteristic of type II β-barrel proteins (Fig.2, inset). The 228-nm CD band is believed to primarily represent the arrangement of the β-strands in the β-barrel architecture of the protein. No significant change(s) occurs in the intensity of the 228-nm CD band at a TFE concentration lower than 5% (v/v) (Fig. 2). However, at a TFE concentration of 8% (v/v), the far-UV CD spectra of the protein show dramatic changes (Fig.2). The positive CD band centered at 228 nm is lost, implying the disruption of the native β-barrel architecture. The loss of the positive CD band at 228 nm is paralleled by the appearance of a negative CD band at around 218 nm in 20% TFE (v/v) (Fig. 2), suggesting the formation of extended β-sheet conformation. The intensity of the negative ellipticity band at 218 nm is observed to steadily increase with the increase in the TFE concentration from 10 (v/v) to 50% (v/v) (Fig. 2). At higher concentrations of TFE (>50% (v/v)), the far-UV CD spectra of the protein show two negative ellipticity bands at 208 and 222 nm, indicating the induction of helical conformation (Fig. 2). Because nFGF-1 in its native conformation lacks helical segments, the induced helix conformation (at higher concentrations of TFE (>50% v/v)) appears to be essentially non-native in origin. The percentage of non-native helix estimated from the far-UV CD spectrum of the protein 70% v/v is about 20%. The majority (>60%) of the backbone of the protein (33Chang C.T. Wu C.S. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 34Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biolchem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2516) Google Scholar) (in 70% (v/v) TFE) is estimated to be unstructured. The results discussed above clearly suggest that the conformational transitions induced by TFE in nFGF-1 occur in two stages. In the first stage, the β-barrel conformation is disorganized, resulting in the formation of extended β-sheet conformation. In the second stage, portions of the backbone of the protein form non-native helix conformation. The protein samples treated with TFE in the concentration range of 10% (v/v) to 45% (v/v) and incubated at room temperature (∼25 °C) for more than 3 h are observed to turn turbid. Hence, the aggregation of the protein (nFGF-1) is examined systematically by monitoring the changes in the 350-nm absorbance (scattering) at various concentrations of TFE (after 3 h of incubation of the protein at 25 °C in various concentrations of TFE). Interestingly, the aggregation profile shows that the protein tends to aggregate maximally between 8 and 45% (v/v) TFE, wherein the protein is observed to exist in an extended β-sheet conformation (Fig. 3). The extent of aggregates formed appears to increase with the increase in the formation of the extended β-sheet conformation in the protein. In addition, the aggregates formed (at TFE concentrations between 10% to 50% (v/v) TFE) are long and thread-like. Beyond this range of TFE concentration (>50% (v/v) TFE), the protein solution turns clear (with low 350-nm absorbance values) even after 48 h of incubation at 25 °C (Fig. 3). These results suggest that the aggregation of nFGF-1 is related to the nature of non-native secondary structural elements induced in the protein (by TFE). Formation of non-native extended β-sheet conformation appears to promote aggregation, and induction of non-native helix conformation correlates with the inhibition of protein aggregation. Similar observations were made by Dobson and co-workers, based on exhaustive point mutations in the muscle acylphosphatase protein (35Chiti F. Taddei N. Baroni F. Capanni C. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 36Taddei N. Capanni C. Chiti F. Stefani M. Dobson C.M. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37149-37154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A clear-cut kinetic partitioning between aggregation and folding of proteins was observed. Protein aggregation was strongly correlated to the β-sheet propensity of the regions of the protein (muscle acylphosphatase) in which the point mutations were located (35Chiti F. Taddei N. Baroni F. Capanni C. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations that stabilize helix conformation were shown to decrease the aggregation process, and those that destabilized the helix increased the aggregation rate (35Chiti F. Taddei N. Baroni F. Capanni C. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The aggregates of nFGF-1 formed in TFE (in 8–40% (v/v) TFE) have a fibrous texture, suggesting that they could possess properties characteristic of amyloid fibrils. This possibility was examined by characterizing the tinctorial and ultrastructural properties of the TFE-induced aggregates. Congo red is a hydrophobic dye routinely used to identify amyloid fibril formation by proteins (37Glenner G.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 1980; 302: 1333-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The absorption maximum of the dye is known to undergo a red shift upon binding to ordered repetitive β-sheet structures in the amyloid fibrils (38Inouye H. Kirschner D.A. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although the TFE-induced aggregation is maximum at 10% (v/v), Congo red binding is observed maximally at 15% (v/v) TFE (Fig.4A). The dye binding is not only accompanied by a significant increase in the absorbance intensity at 490 nm but also by a prominent red shift in the absorbance maximum (490 to 520 nm, Fig. 4A, inset). Beyond 15% (v/v) TFE the intensity of the dye at 490 nm decreases steadily with the increase in concentration of the fluoro alcohol. These results suggest that the fibrils formed maximally at 15% (v/v) TFE have amyloid-like characteristics. The nature of the aggregates formed were also probed using ThT. ThT is a fluorescent dye used as a diagnostic to identify amyloid fibril formation (39Sunde M. Blake C. Adv. Protein. Chem. 1997; 50: 123-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The emission intensity of ThT is known to increase significantly upon binding to the linear array of β-strands in the amyloid fibrils. There is no appreciable change(s) in the fluorescence intensity of the dye at TFE concentrations lower than 10% (v/v) (Fig.4B). However, an 8-fold increase in the fluorescence intensity at 485 nm is observed when the dye binds to the protein in 15% TFE (Fig. 4B). These results provide further evidence suggesting that amyloid-like fibrils of nFGF-1 accumulate maximally in 15% (v/v) TFE. The ultrastructure of the aggregates (of nFGF-1) formed in 15% (v/v) TFE was examined by transmission electron microscopy and x-ray fiber diffraction. Electron micrographs reveal that the aggregates formed are straight and unbranched, with an average diameter of about 10–15 nm (Fig. 5A) and is similar to the width of the fibrils formed from other amyloidogenic proteins (39Sunde M. Blake C. Adv. Protein. Chem. 1997; 50: 123-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). X-ray fiber diffraction analysis of the nFGF-1 aggregates shows a dominant reflection at 4.7 Å on the meridian and associated equatorial reflection at 10.3 Å, typical of those expected for fibrils with a cross-β structure (Fig. 5B). The meridional reflection (at 4.7 Å), which primarily arises from the spacing between the β-sheet structure, is sharp and intense (Fig. 5B). The equatorial reflection (at 10.3 Å), which is generally attributed to the intersheet spacing, is relatively diffused (Fig. 5B). Thus, the results of the electron microscopy and x-ray fiber diffraction experiments authenticate that the aggregates formed in 15% (v/v) TFE possess features resembling that of the amyloid fibrils. Seeding is a common phenomenon in aggregation and gelation processes, as it is in crystallization (40Mullins J. Crystallization. Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford1993Google Scholar). It has been reported that aliquots of pre-formed fibrils formed by AB pep"
https://openalex.org/W2157189748,"The current therapeutic angiogenesis strategy to treat ischemic disease by using angiogenic growth factors has been limited to use of a single gene. However, as vasodilator substances such as prostacyclin are widely used for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease, it might be useful to combine angiogenesis with vasodilation of new vessels. In a mouse hind limb ischemia model, cotransfection of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) gene with the prostacyclin synthase gene demonstrated a further increase in blood flow and capillary density compared with a single gene. Even in the rabbit ischemia model, cotransfection of HGF plasmid with the prostacyclin synthase gene demonstrated a further increase in angiogenic activity compared with HGF alone. Because peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes is common for significant morbidity, we examined the hypothesis that experimental diabetic neuropathy can be reversed by HGF and prostacyclin synthase genes. Severe peripheral neuropathy, characterized by significant slowing of nerve conduction velocity compared with nondiabetic control animals, was ameliorated. Overall, cotransfection of the prostacyclin synthase and HGF genes is more effective than single-gene transfection to stimulate angiogenesis, and it significantly improved neuropathy. These data provide important information relating to the clinical application of therapeutic angiogenesis to treat peripheral arterial disease."
https://openalex.org/W2037810072,"The remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) is an important process required for cancer cells to turn into invasive and metastatic cancer cells. To dissolve the protein components of ECM, matrix metalloproteinases are some of the essential enzymes. Another ECM remodeling enzyme is the heparanase (Hpa) that digests the heparin sulfate component of the matrix. In metastatic cancer cells the Hpa gene is upregulated. To investigate the mechanism of why Hpa was upregulated in metastatic cancer cells, the regulatory sequence of heparanase gene was isolated and its function analysed in metastatic breast cancer cells. We found there are four ETS transcription factor binding sites. Two of them flanking the transcription initiation of the Hpa gene are nonfunctional, whereas two others are highly functional and responded to exogenously added ETS transcription factors. Mutation of these two ETS binding sites abolished the transcriptional activation of Hpa promoter by ETS transcription factors. Among four transcription factors tested (ETS1, ETS2, PEA3, and ER81), ETS1 and ETS2 are more potent in transactivating the human Hpa gene. Furthermore, dominant-negative ETS transcription factors failed to transactivate Hpa promoter and could abrogate the function of wild-type transcription factor in transactivation activity of ETS transcription factors on the Hpa promoter. These results suggest that ETS transcription factors play an important role in tumor invasion and metastasis by modulating the remodeling of ECM."

Biochemical characterization of these different mammalian Mediator complexes has revealed that they are composed of many of the same proteins. Among the consensus mammalian Mediator subunits are easily identifiable structural homologues of several S. cerevisiae Mediator subunits, including Srb7, Med6, Med7, Nut2, and Rgr1; in addition, recent bioinformatic evidence suggests that, among the consensus mammalian Mediator subunits, TRFP, TRAP80, TRAP240, TRAP230, Cdk8, Cyclin C, TRAP220, and TRAP36 are homologous to S. cerevisiae Mediator subunits Srb2, Srb4, Srb8, Srb9, Srb10, Srb11, Med1, and Med4, respectively (8Boube M.

We recently identified a mammalian homologue of S. cerevisiae Mediator subunit Med8 and found that it is an Elongin BC-interacting protein that can assemble with Elongins B and C and a Cul2/Rbx1 module to reconstitute a potential E3 ubiquitin ligase. As part of our effort to explore the possible relationship between Mediator and the ubiquitin pathway, we have purified a Med8-containing Mediator complex from rat liver nuclei. Analysis of proteins present in the most highly purified Med8-containing fractions by ion-trap MS/MS identified many consensus mammalian Mediator subunits, as well as additional proteins not previously recognized as subunits of mammalian Mediator. In this report, we identify four of these proteins as integral subunits of the mammalian Mediator complex. Anti-c-Myc (9E10) monoclonal antibody was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Rabbit anti-c-Myc antibody (C-3956), anti-Flag (M2) monoclonal antibody, and anti-Flag M2 agarose were obtained from Sigma. Anti-Med6 (E-20) antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit anti-Med8 antibody was raised against a peptide corresponding to Med8 residues 247–268, and rabbit anti-p28b, anti-Surf5, anti-HSPC296, anti-LCMR1, and anti-FLJ23445 antibodies were raised against full-length recombinant proteins produced in eitherEscherichia coli or insect cells (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc). Rabbit anti-TRAP80 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. R. G. Roeder. Sf21 cells were cultured at 27 °C in Sf-900 II SFM (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. 1 × 108 Sf21 cells in suspension (for large-scale preparations used in preparative chromatography) or 1 × 107 Sf21 cells in monolayer cultures (for small-scale preparations used for analytical immunoprecipitations) were infected at a multiplicity of infection of ∼5–10 with the recombinant baculoviruses indicated in the figures. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were collected and lysed in ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 500 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.28 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.4 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.17 mg/ml PMSF, and 0.33 mg/ml benzamidine. For large-scale preparations, lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, and for analytical preparations, lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Where indicated in the figure legends, histidine-tagged proteins were applied to a 1-ml HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) charged with nickel ions according to the manufacturer's instructions. The column was washed with buffer I (40 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.28 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.4 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.17 mg/ml PMSF, and 0.33 mg/ml benzamidine) containing 10 mm imidazole. The column was eluted with a 20-column volume gradient from buffer I containing 10 mmimidazole to buffer I containing 500 mm imidazole. We previously identified in rat liver nuclear extracts a Med8-containing Mediator complex with an apparent native molecular mass by SW4000 gel filtration of more than 1000 kDa (9Brower C.S. Sato S.

Although the Med8 complex appeared to fractionate chromatographically as a discrete species, it proved to be extremely labile and refractory to complete purification, with estimated yields as poor as 10% at each step of purification. As a consequence, in an effort to identify proteins present in the Med8 complex, we resorted to a proteomics approach involving large scale enrichment of the complex by multistep conventional chromatography and HPLC followed by exhaustive sequencing of Med8-associated proteins by HPLC/MS/MS. Among the proteins present in the most highly enriched Med8-containing fractions and identified by mass spectrometry were the known mammalian Mediator subunits TRAP230, TRAP220, TRAP80, Cdk8, Cyclin C, TRAP37, Med6, Med7, TRFP, TRAP25, Nut2, and Soh1 (Table I in the Supplemental Material). In addition to these known mammalian Mediator subunits were a collection of additional proteins including the p28b, Surf5, HSPC296,AK007855, and LCMR1 (lung cancer metastasis-related protein 1) proteins, which were not previously recognized as consensus mammalian Mediator subunits. The p28b protein was previously identified by protein sequencing as a constituent of a mammalian Mediator preparation from mouse B-cells (7Jiang Y. Veschambre P. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

The proteins encoded by the Surf5, HSPC296, and AK007855 open reading frames had not previously been identified as components of mammalian Mediator complexes, but their apparent D. melanogaster homologues were recently identified as the Med24, Med21, and Med23 components of a D. melanogaster Mediator complex (10Gu J.Y. Park J.M. Song E.J. Mizuguchi G. Yoon J.H. Kim-Ha J. Lee K.J. Kim Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27154-27161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The LCMR1 protein is defined as a metastasis-related protein (GenBankTM accession number AAN16075). however, no information about the function of LCMR1 has been reported, and the LCMR1 protein had not previously been identified as a constituent of either mammalian or D. melanogaster Mediator complexes. On the basis of bioinformatic evidence, Bourbon and co-workers (8Boube M. Joulia L. Cribbs D.L. Bourbon H.-M. Cell. 2002; 110: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) recently predicted that the p28b and Surf5 proteins are higher eukaryotic homologues of the S. cerevisiae Mediator subunits Srb5 and Srb6. Results of our PSI-BLAST searches and multiple sequence alignments revealed structural similarities between LCMR1 and HSPC296 and the yeast Mediator subunits Rox3 and Med11, respectively, suggesting that LCMR1 and HSPC296 could be mammalian homologues of yeast Rox3 and Med11 (Fig. 1 in the Supplemental Material). Because of their apparent structural similarities to S. cerevisiae Mediator subunits, we sought to determine whether the p28b, Surf5, HSPC296, and LCMR1 proteins are bona fidesubunits of the mammalian Mediator complex. To begin to address this possibility, we took advantage of a HeLa cell line that stably expresses Mediator subunit Nut2 with an N-terminal Flag tag (f:Nut2). This HeLa cell line has been used extensively as a source for immunoaffinity purification of the transcriptionally active TRAP/SMCC Mediator complex (11Malik S. Gu W. Wu W. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 753-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against the p28b, Surf5, HSPC296, and LCMR1 proteins and used in Western blotting experiments to assay for the presence of these proteins in immunoaffinity-purified preparations of the HeLa cell TRAP/SMCC complex. As shown in Fig. 1, all four proteins were readily detected by Western blotting in immunoaffinity-purified preparations of the TRAP/SMCC complex, along with f:Nut2 and known Mediator subunits TRAP80, Med6, and Med8. A protein encoded by the FLJ23445 open reading frame, which was also identified by mass spectrometry in the most highly enriched Med8-containing fractions, was not detected by Western blotting in purified preparations of the TRAP/SMCC complex (Fig. 1). Thus, although the p28b, Surf5, HSPC296, and LCMR1 proteins were not previously identified in the TRAP/SMCC complex by protein sequencing, they were all detected by Western blotting in purified preparations of the complex, suggesting that they are subunits of the complex. To obtain additional evidence supporting assignment of the p28b, Surf5, HSPC296, and LCMR1 proteins as mammalian Mediator subunits, we sought to identify pairwise binding partners of these proteins among the known mammalian Mediator subunits. To this end, we used a convenient and scalable screen to assess the ability of these proteins to interact with known mammalian Mediator subunits prepared by in vitrotranslation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. pcDNA3.1 expression vectors encoding the known mammalian Mediator subunits indicated in Fig. 2 were constructed and used to program rabbit reticulocyte lysates for translation of35S-labeled Mediator proteins. Binding of35S-labeled Mediator proteins to purified recombinant Flag-p28b, Flag-TRFP, GST-Surf5, GST-TRAP25, and GST-LCMR1 fusion proteins was assayed in pull-down experiments using anti-Flag-agarose or glutathione-agarose beads, and bound proteins were visualized by autoradiography. The results of these experiments revealed significant and reproducible binding (i) of p28b to Mediator subunit TRFP, (ii) of TRAP25 to itself and to Mediator subunits TRAP36 and Surf5, (iii) of Surf5 to both Mediator subunit TRAP25 and HSPC296, and (iv) of LCMR1 to Mediator subunit Soh1 (Fig. 3). Additionally, GST-TRAP25, GST-Surf5, and GST-LCMR1 all bound to TRAP80 and TRAP37 in these experiments (Fig. 2).Figure 3Interaction of p28b, Surf5, HSPC296, and LCMR1 with known Mediator subunits in transfected mammalian cells.Two 10-cm dishes of 293T cells grown to ∼50% confluency were cotransfected with 3 μg of plasmids encoding the proteins indicated in the figure. 24–36 h after transfection, cells were lysed by incubation in 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 250 mmKCl, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. Proteins in cell lysates or anti-Flag immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by Western blotting using anti-Flag or anti-c-Myc antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies. Western blots were developed using the SuperSignal West Dura extended duration substrate (Pierce).f:TRFP, FLAG-TRFP; f:Surf5, FLAG-Surf5;f:LCMR1, FLAG-LCMR1; myc, c-Myc epitope;IP, immunoprecipitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm and extend these findings, we sought to reconstitute the protein-protein interactions observed in in vitrotranslation experiments in transfected 293T cells or with recombinant proteins expressed in Sf21 insect cells or inE. coli. Consistent with the results of our initial screening experiments, p28b could be coimmunoprecipitated from 293T cell lysates with mammalian Mediator subunit TRFP, Surf5 could be coimmunoprecipitated with both HSPC296 and Mediator subunit TRAP25, and LCMR1 could be coimmunoprecipitated with Mediator subunit Soh1 (Fig.3). As shown in Fig. 4A, recombinant TRFP purified from E. coli, but not bacterially expressed FLJ23445, bound specifically to purified GST-p28b. In control experiments, TRFP did not bind to GST-Med8. Consistent with these observations, a TRFP-p28b heterodimer could be reconstituted with His-TRFP and His-p28b that had been purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells by nickel chromatography. TheTRFP-p28b heterodimer was purified to near homogeneity by TSK DEAE-NPR HPLC. After mixing recombinant TRFP and p28b, both proteins bound the TSK DEAE-NPR column and were eluted with ∼130 mm KCl. In control experiments p28b flowed through the TSK DEAE-NPR column when TRFP was not present (Fig. 4B). Similarly, an HSPC296-Surf5 heterodimer could be purified to near homogeneity by anti-Flag immunoaffinity chromatography of Flag-tagged HSPC296 and C-Myc-tagged Surf5 that had been coexpressed in Sf21 cells (Fig.5A).Figure 5Interaction of HSPC296 with Surf5 and TRAP25.A, extracts from Sf21 cells infected with baculoviruses encoding the hSPC296 protein with an N-terminal Flag tag and the Surf5 protein with an N-terminal Myc tag and a 16-amino acid C-terminal extension replacing the last two Surf5 amino acids with DPLEDLVPSSNSRAAA (input) were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG agarose. Bound proteins were eluted from anti-FLAG beads with 150 μg/ml FLAG peptide, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and detected by Coomassie staining or by Western blotting (IP Flag).Myc:Surf5 was detected with rabbit anti-c-Myc antibody and IR Dye™ 800-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (green). f:hSPC296 was detected with mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and Alexa Fluor 680-labeled anti-mouse IgG (α light chain-specific) secondary antibody (red). Light chain-specific anti-mouse antibody was obtained from Bethyl Laboratories and labeled with Alexa Fluor 680 (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies were detected using a Li-Cor Odyssey infrared imaging system. B, His-Surf5 and either GST or GST-TRAP25 were coexpressed in E. coli and purified on a glutathione-Sepharose FastFlow column. Aliquots of the column load (input), flow-through (FT), and fractions eluted with glutathione were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and proteins were detected by Western blotting (WB) with anti-Surf 5 antiserum using horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody. Bands were visualized using the SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether Surf5 can bind directly to TRAP25, either GST-TRAP25 and Surf5 or GST and Surf5 were coexpressed in E. coli, and cell lysates were subjected to glutathione-agarose chromatography. Because GST and Surf5 coelectrophorese on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, the presence or absence of Surf5 in column eluates was detected by Western blotting with anti-Surf5 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5B, bacterially expressed Surf5 bound specifically to bacterially expressed GST-TRAP25 but not to GST. Finally, binding of LCMR1 to Soh1 was detected following pairwise coexpression of these proteins in Sf21 cells. As shown in Fig.6, lanes 1–4, LCMR1 and Soh1 could be coimmunoprecipitated efficiently with anti-LCMR1 antibodies from lysates of cells expressing both LCMR1 and Soh1, whereas only a small amount of Soh1 was detected in immunoprecipitates from cells expressing Soh1 alone. To determine whether LCMR1 can bind directly to Soh1, thioredoxin-LCMR1, which had been expressed in and purified fromE. coli, was mixed with either GST-Soh1 or GST and subjected to glutathione-agarose chromatography. Full-length Trx-LCMR1 and GST-Soh1 coelectrophorese on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (data not shown). Therefore, Trx-LCMR1 was detected by Western blotting with anti-LCMR1 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 6, lanes 8–10, Trx-LCMR1 bound GST-Soh1 but not GST. Further supporting the specificity of this interaction, a large fraction of Trx-LCMR1 in binding reactions had been proteolyzed during its expression and/or purification (lanes 5–7); however, the full-length protein bound most efficiently to GST-Soh1. In summary, in this report we present direct biochemical evidence that the mammalian p28b, Surf5, HSPC296, and LCMR1 proteins are bona fide subunits of the mammalian Mediator complex. Taken together with the bioinformatic evidence of Bourbon and co-workers (8Boube M. Joulia L. Cribbs D.L. Bourbon H.-M. Cell. 2002; 110: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), which suggests that the p28b and Surf5 proteins may be homologues of S. cerevisiae Mediator subunits Srb5 and Srb6, our finding that the HSPC296 and LCMR1 proteins share sequence similarity with S. cerevisiae Mediator subunits Med11 and Rox3 suggests that yeast and higher eukaryotic Mediator complexes may be more highly conserved throughout evolution than previously thought. Ultimately, however, experiments that directly explore the structural and functional relationships between apparent homologues of yeast and higher eukaryotic Mediator subunits will be required to determine the extent of evolutionary conservation between yeast and higher eukaryotic Mediator complexes.

We investigated whether nitric oxide formed after overexpression of VEGF or of phosphomimetic eNOS (S1177D) affects PMN-induced myocardial detriment after ischemia and reperfusion. Pigs (n=8 per group) were subjected to percutaneous liposome-based gene transfer by retroinfusion of the anterior interventricular vein 48 h before LAD occlusion (60 min) and reperfusion (24 h). Thereafter, regional myocardial function was assessed as subendocardial segment shortening (SES), and infarct size was determined. Tissue from the infarct region, the noninfarcted area at risk, and a control region was analyzed for NF-kappaB activation (EMSA), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and E-selectin mRNA and infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). L-NAME was applied in one group of VEGF-transfected animals. NF-kappaB activition, PMN infiltration in the infarct region, and AAR were reduced after transfection of VEGF or eNOS S1177D, but not after VEGF+L-NAME coapplication. Infarct size decreased, whereas SES improved after either VEGF or eNOS S1177D transfection, an effect inhibited by L-NAME coapplication. Retroinfusion of liposomal VEGF cDNA reduces NF-kappaB-dependent postischemic inflammation and subsequent myocardial reperfusion injury, an effect mediated at least in part by enhanced eNOS phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2004745607,"Recent studies show that stable expression of the human telomerase catalytic subunit, hTERT, alone can lead several types of normal human somatic cells to bypass replicative senescence and become immortal. The molecular mechanisms by which telomerase immortalizes cells are not fully understood, although a key function of telomerase is to maintain a critical length of telomeres in order to preserve the stability and integrity of the genome. Here we report that stable transfection of hTERT alone was sufficient to allow bovine capillary endothelial (BCE) cells to bypass senescence and acquire immortality. Surprisingly, telomere lengths in these stable transfectants were progressively shortened during an increasing number of population doublings (PDLs), despite high telomerase activity. The expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) p16INK4A and p21CIP1/WAF1 was concomitantly repressed, and the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) was maintained in a hyperphosphorylated state in the telomerase-expressing cells. Re-expression of p16INK4A in these cells by either treatment with a demethylating agent or by adenovirus-mediated expression reinduced a senescence-like phenotype, suggesting that the inactivation of p16INK4A was due to DNA methylation and was crucial for the immortalization process. In agreement with this finding, the expression levels of the prototypic DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 were elevated in the hTERT-positive cells."
https://openalex.org/W2152553738,"Fast-twitch skeletal muscle of mice deficient in cytosolic and mitochondrial creatine kinase isoforms (CK-/-) lack burst activity but can sustain prolonged contractile activity, suggesting that adaptive mechanisms can regulate local adenine nucleotide turnover. We investigated whether direct energy and signal channeling between mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) or myofilaments may exist that compensate for the lack of CK isoenzymes. Oxidative capacity of fast-twitch muscle was increased twofold in CK-/- mice. Energy cross talk between organelles was studied in muscle fibers with permeabilized sarcolemma. Energy supply to SR was estimated by analyzing the tension transient induced by caffeine and energy supply to myofilaments was estimated by the relaxation of rigor tension, both under different conditions of energy supply. In normal mice, ATP directly produced by mitochondria was not able to sustain calcium uptake and to relax rigor tension as efficiently as ATP produced by bound CK. However, in CK-/- mice, mitochondria ability to provide ATP for calcium uptake and relaxation of rigor tension was dramatically enhanced, suggesting a direct ATP/ADP channeling between sites of energy production mitochondria) and energy utilization in CK-/- mice. These results demonstrate two possible patterns of energy transport in muscle cells: energy store with phosphocreatine and energy flux through mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2027147108,"We have shown previously that expression of the murine CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) α gene is regulated during cell proliferation (Golfman, L. S., Bakovic, M., and Vance, D. E. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 43688–43692). We have now characterized the role of Ha-Ras in the transcriptional regulation of the CTα gene. The expression of CTα and CTβ2 proteins and mRNAs was stimulated in C3H10T1/2 murine fibroblasts expressing oncogenic Ha-Ras. Incubation of cells with the specific inhibitor (PD98059) of p42/44MAPK decreased the expression of both CT isoforms. Transfection of fibroblasts with CTα promoter-luciferase constructs resulted in an ∼2-fold enhanced luciferase expression in Ha-Ras-transformed, compared with nontransformed, fibroblasts. Electromobility shift assays indicated enhanced binding of the Sp3 transcription factor to the CTα promoter in Ha-Ras-transformed cells. Expression of several forms of Sp3 was increased in nuclear extracts of Ha-Ras-transformed fibroblasts compared with nontransformed cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of one Sp3 form was decreased, whereas phosphorylation of two other forms of Sp3 was increased in nuclear extracts of Ha-Ras-transformed cells. When control fibroblasts were transfected with a Sp3-expressing plasmid, an enhanced expression of CTα and CTβ was observed. However, the expression of CTα or CTβ was not increased in Ha-Ras-transformed cells transfected with a Sp3 plasmid presumably because expression was already maximally enhanced. The results suggest that Sp3 is a downstream effector of a Ras/p42/44MAPK signaling pathway which increases CTα gene transcription. We have shown previously that expression of the murine CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) α gene is regulated during cell proliferation (Golfman, L. S., Bakovic, M., and Vance, D. E.

Recently, CTβ has been identified in human tissues and appears to exist as two splice variants, CTβ1 and CTβ2, differing at their C termini (22Lykidis A. Murti K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14022-14029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 23Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol.

However, CTβ1 lacks the phosphorylation domain, and both CTβ1 and CTβ2 lack the nuclear localization sequence (23Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In the last several years, studies have shown that CT can be regulated at both the transcriptional level and post-transcriptionally. CT mRNA is increased after partial hepatectomy in rats (13Houweling M. Tijburg L.B.M. Vaartjes W.J. Batenburg J.J. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. van Golde L.M.G. Eur. J.

It remains to be determined whether these increases in the message levels are the result of CTα and/or CTβ1/2 mRNA stability, an increase in gene transcription, or a combination of both. The murine CTα gene (Ctpct) was cloned and characterized by Tang and co-workers (29Tang W. Keesler G.A. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13146-13151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The Ctpct promoter contains several putative elements for binding transcription factors, including Ap1, an overlapping site for nuclear factor-κB, E2F, and Elk1, one sterol response element, as well as three elements for Sp-related factors (30Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have shown that Sp1, Sp2, and Sp3 bind competitively to three GC-rich elements and that relative promoter activity depends upon the abundance of these factors (31Bakovic M. Waite A.K. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 583-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We further established that transcription enhancer factor-4 can bind to an upstream regulatory element (−103/−82) and enhance the CTα gene expression through its interactions with the basal transcriptional machinery (32Sugimoto H. Bakovic M. Yamashita S. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12338-12344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In agreement with the finding that lipoprotein deficiency induces the expression of CTα mRNA and protein in alveolar type II epithelial cells (33Ryan A.J. McCoy D.M. Mathuyr S.N. Field F.J. Mallampalli R.K. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1268-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and our observation that the CTα promoter contains a putative sterol response element (30Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), studies by Kast et al. (34Kast H.R. Nguyen C.M. Anisfeld A.M. Ericsson J. Edwards P.A. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1266-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicate a role for cholesterol/sterol response element-binding protein and the functionality of the sterol response element in the regulation of CTα gene expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells and THP-1 cells. On the other hand, Lagace et al. (35Lagace T.A. Storey M.K. Ridgway N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14367-14374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have shown that cholesterol/sterol response element-binding protein can stimulate PC biosynthesis without altering transcription of the CTα gene. Recently we discovered that increased transcription of the CTα gene occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle in murine fibroblasts (36Golfman L.S. Bakovic M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43688-43692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, this type of regulation was not evident in type II lung epithelial cells (37Tseu I. Ridsdale R. Liu J. Wang J. Post M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 506-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), further suggesting a cell type-specific regulation of the CTα gene. The importance of PC metabolism in cell proliferation has been under intense investigation, and it has become clear that the GTP exchange protein, Ras, might play an important role in linking these two processes (38Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3198) Google Scholar, 39Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar, 40Robinson M.J.

Taparowski E.J. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6042-6047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (46Momchilova A. Markovska T. Pankov R. Cell Biol.

Acta. 1996; 1299: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The oncogenic transformation in mouse cells leads to increased activity of choline kinase and decreased activity of CT (45Teegarden D. Taparowski E.J. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6042-6047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Momchilova A. Markovska T. Pankov R. Cell Biol. Intern. 1999; 23: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), whereas in human keratinocytes CT activity and choline uptake were increased, but choline kinase activity did not change (47Geilen C.C. Wieder T. Boremski S. Wieprecht M. Orfanos C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Based upon those data and our finding that CTα promoter activity and CTα mRNA increased after growth stimulation by serum (36Golfman L.S. Bakovic M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43688-43692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we investigated the role of Ha-Ras in the regulation of the CTα gene. We demonstrate that the Ras/p42/44MAPK signaling pathway plays a role in the regulation of expression of both CTα and CTβ which is at least partially mediated by the transcription factor Sp3. All reagents were molecular biology grade. The inhibitors of p38MAPK (SB202190) and MEK1 (PD98059) were from Calbiochem. The transfection reagent DOTAP was from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Phospho-MAPK antibody sampler containing phospho-p42/44MAPK, phospho-p38MAPK, and phospho-SAPK/JNK-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies was from New England BioLabs, Mississauga, Canada. A murine monoclonal phosphotyrosine-specific antibody, PY20, was from BD Biosciences, Canada. Cell culture media and reagents were from Invitrogen. 5′-Deletion luciferase reporter constructs encoding the murine CTα promoter, LUC.C5 (−2068/+38), LUC.C7 (−1268/+38), LUC.C8 (−201/+38) and LUC.D1 (−90/+38), LUC.D2 (−130/+38), and LUC.D3 (−52/+38), and the vector enabling expression of β-galactosidase, pBKΔGal, have been described previously (30Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The Sp1 expression plasmid pPacSp1 and the pPacO-control vector were gifts from Dr. R. Tjian (48Courey A.J. Tjian R.

M. Horowitz (50Kennett S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Murine embryo fibroblasts (C3H10T1/2) and the Ha-Ras-transformed cloneras11A were kindly provided by Dr. C. Kent (University of Michigan) (45Teegarden D. Taparowski E.J. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6042-6047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin under a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. The ras11A cell line is neomycin-resistant and was grown in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418. During experiments, G418 was not added to the medium, as recommended (45Teegarden D. Taparowski E.J. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6042-6047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MAP kinase inhibitors PD98059 and SB202190 were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. An aliquot of each inhibitor solution was added to the medium, and the final concentration of the vehicle in the medium was adjusted to 0.1% (v/v). The control medium contained the same amount of the vehicle. Fibroblasts were transfected using a DOTAP liposomal method (30Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Control and Ha-Ras-transformed fibroblasts were plated at a density of 2 × 106cells/60-mm dish and transfected the next day with 2.5 μg of specific CTα-luciferase reporter plasmid with or without the indicated amounts of Sp1 and Sp3 expression plasmids (pPacSp1 or pPacSp3) or control vector (pPacO). Transfected cells were grown overnight in normal medium, then growth was arrested in a low serum medium (0.5% fetal calf serum) for 2 additional days. The arrested cells were stimulated to grow by the addition of 10% serum and 24 h later collected for further analysis. The pBKΔGal vector, encoding β-galactosidase, was cotransfected as an internal control to measure differences in transfection efficiency. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured using a luciferase and β-galactosidase assay system (Promega). The amount of cellular protein was measured by the Bio-Rad method. CT activity in total cell homogenates, cytosol, and microsomes was assayed in the presence of PC-oleate vesicles by monitoring the conversion of phospho[3H]choline to CDP-[3H]choline as described previously (36Golfman L.S. Bakovic M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43688-43692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected in a homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 100 μm Na3V04, and 100 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin), sonicated for 25 s at 4 °C, and the lysate was either stored at −70 °C or added immediately (25 μg of protein) to a CT-activity assay buffer (57.8 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mm NaCl, 1.78 mm EDTA, 8.9 mm magnesium acetate) containing 1.5 mm[3H]phosphocholine, 3 mm CTP, and 0.2 mm PC-oleate (1:1) vesicles in a final volume of 100 μl. The reaction was incubated 15 min at 37 °C and stopped by boiling for 2 min. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min and an aliquot spotted on a Silica Gel G60 thin-layer plate. The plate was developed in a solvent mixture of methanol, 0.6% NaCl, and saturated ammonia (10:10:0.9, v/v) and CDP-[3H]choline quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Cell lysates from control and Ha-Ras-transformed cells (20–50 μg of protein) were prepared as described previously (36Golfman L.S. Bakovic M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43688-43692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and separated on 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) at ∼150 mA and 4 °C for 1 h. After checking for protein loading with Ponceau S dye, the membranes were incubated overnight with 5% skim milk in TTBS (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). The membranes were washed in TTBS and incubated at 25 °C for 2 h with polyclonal antibodies raised against CT (anti-M), CTα, CTβ1/2, and/or CTβ2. The CT (anti-M) antibody was a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 256–288 (M domain) of rat liver CTα from Dr. R. Cornell (51Northwood C.I. Tong H.Y.A.

The anti-CTα rabbit polyclonal antibody, corresponding to the first 17 amino acids of human CTα, the rabbit anti-human CTβ1/β2 (B2 epitope) antibody, corresponding to amino acids 5–22 of CTβ1/2, and the rabbit anti-human CTβ2 antibody (B3 epitope), corresponding to amino acids 347–365 of CTβ2, were all gifts from Dr. S. Jackowski (22Lykidis A. Murti K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14022-14029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 23Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed by incubation of the membranes with either anti-M (1:2,000), anti-CTα (1:1,000), anti-CTβ1/2 (1:1,000) or CTβ2 (1:5,000) as the primary antibody. The membranes were washed five or six times for 15 min each with TTBS, then incubated with goat anti-rabbit antiserum (1:5,000 dilution; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at room temperature for 1 h. The membranes were washed five or six times with TTBS, developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce), and exposed to XAR-5 film (Kodak). To reprobe the blots, the membranes were stripped in 100 mm mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, at 50 °C for 30 min and subjected to the above immunoblotting procedure. Nuclear extracts were prepared at described (30Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 52Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Equal aliquots of nuclear proteins or cell lysates (20–50 μg) from control and transformed cells were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. To investigate the activation state of different MAP kinases in response to Ha-Ras transformation, we employed specific antibodies directed against the phosphorylated forms of p42/44MAPK and p38MAPK. The immunoblotting procedure was as described above for CT. Nuclear proteins were prepared as described (30Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 52Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Cells grown in 100-mm dishes were scraped into 1 ml of an immunoprecipitation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Total proteins (500 μg) or nuclear proteins (100 μg) from control and Ha-Ras-transformed cells were incubated with 2 μg of Sp3-specific polyclonal antibody (H-225, 200 μg/ml; sc-13018, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, 20 μg of protein A-agarose was added, and the samples were mixed gently overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was washed four times with PBS. Finally, the pellet was resuspended in 40 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer and boiled for 2–3 min. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane that was blocked with PBS containing 6% powdered milk, 0.5% Tween 20, then probed with anti-Sp3 antibody at a dilution of 1:500 for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (dilution 1:2,000) for 1 h, washed with PBS-Tween, and proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence. Phosphorylated Sp3 was detected using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY-20 at 1:1,000 dilution) by reprobing the same blot using a protocol similar to that described for CT. In some experiments, Sp3-related proteins and tyrosine phosphorylation were measured directly by immunoblotting (31Bakovic M. Waite A.K. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 583-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from Ha-Ras and control fibroblasts were prepared 24 h after serum stimulation as described (30Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys.

The double stranded CTα promoter probes D1 (−98/+38) and D2 (−130/+38) containing Sp binding sites were prepared from LUC.D1 and LUC.D2 reporter vectors by restriction digestion and purification (30Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The promoter fragments were 3′-end labeled with [32P]dCTP and Klenow polymerase and the binding of Sp1 and Sp3 analyzed after separation of DNA-protein complexes on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography (30Bakovic M.

Total RNA from control and Ha-Ras-transformed cells grown in the presence or absence of MAP kinase inhibitors was extracted using TRIAZOL reagent (Invitrogen) (36Golfman L.S. Bakovic M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43688-43692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The RNA was reverse transcribed with a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Superscript II, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reverse-transcribed mRNA (0.5–3 μg) was amplified using PCR primed with forward (5′-ATGCACAGTGTTCAGCCAA-3′) and reverse (5′-GGGCTTACTAAAGTCAACTTCAA-3′) primers corresponding to the CTα gene. The signal from the CTα mRNA transcript was normalized to the signal obtained from glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a control using the primer pair 5′-TCCACCACCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ (reverse) or with the signal from cyclophilin using the primers 5′-TCTTCTTGCTGGTCTTGCCATTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCAAAGACAGCAGAAAACTT-3′ (reverse). 30 cycles of PCR amplification at 95 °C for 1 min, 45° for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min produced ∼200-bp fragments for CTα and ∼250-bp fragments for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; 33 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 2 min produced ∼300-bp fragments for cyclophilin. Calculations of the average values, standard deviations, and the comparison of means by Student'st test were performed by Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Inc.). Densitometric analyses of the CTα and/or CTβ protein mass and mRNA expression were performed by Scion Image acquisition and analysis software (Scion Inc.). It is well documented that deregulated cell proliferation is a consequence of activated Ras signaling through the MAP kinase cascade, which is a critical component of the proliferative response (39Treisman R.

Activated Ras signals directly through Raf kinase with the subsequent activation of MEK1/2 kinases and results in the phosphorylation and activation of p44/42MAPK. Typically, the Raf/MEK1/2/p42/44MAPK pathway is strongly stimulated by growth factors and mitogenic stimuli, whereas in contrast, two other signaling pathways, mediated by p38MAPK and p46/54JNK, are activated primarily by cellular stresses that include heat, UV radiation, and hypoxia (42Kyriakis J.M.

The importance of lipoprotein processing by signal peptidase II (SPase II) is underscored by the fact that this enzyme is essential for viability of the Gram-negative eubacterium Escherichia coli. In contrast, SPase II is not essential for growth and viability of the Gram-positive eubacterium Bacillus subtilis. This could be due to alternative amino-terminal lipoprotein processing, which was shown previously to occur in SPase II mutants of B. subtilis. Alternatively, uncleaved lipoprotein precursors might be functional. To explore further the importance of lipoprotein processing in Gram-positive eubacteria, an SPase II mutant strain ofLactococcus lactis was constructed. Although some of the 39 (predicted) lactococcal lipoproteins, such as PrtM and OppA, are essential for growth in milk, the growth of SPase II mutant L. lactis cells in this medium was not affected. Furthermore, the activity of the strictly PrtM-dependent extracellular protease PrtP, which is required for casein degradation, was not impaired in the absence of SPase II. Importantly, no alternative processing of pre-PrtM and pre-OppA was observed in cells lacking SPase II.

The known lipid-modified proteins (lipoproteins) are involved in a large variety of processes, which range from the uptake of nutrients, resistance against antibiotics, protein secretion, cell wall biogenesis, sporulation and germination, to the targeting of eubacteria to different substrates, eubacteria, and host tissues (see Ref. 5Sutcliffe I.C. Russell R.R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1123-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Furthermore, lipoproteins have been implicated as important mediators of the inflammatory response in human hosts during eubacterial infections (6Calcutt M.J. Kim M.F. Karpas A.B. Muhlradt P.F.

Bakteriol. 1999; 289: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Lipoproteins are directed into the general (Sec) pathway for protein secretion by their signal peptides, comprising a positively charged amino terminus, a hydrophobic core region, and a carboxyl-terminal region containing the cleavage site for signal peptidase (SPase).1 The major difference between signal peptides of lipoproteins and secretory proteins is the presence of a well conserved “lipobox” of four residues in lipoprotein signal peptides. Invariably, the carboxyl-terminal residue of the lipobox is cysteine that, upon lipid modification, forms the retention signal of the mature lipoprotein (for details see Refs. 1Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 11von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Modification of this cysteine residue by the diacylglyceryl transferase (Lgt) is a prerequisite for specific processing of the lipoprotein precursor by a type II SPase. In most Gram-negative eubacteria the processed lipoprotein is further modified by amino acylation of the diacylglyceryl-cysteine amino group (3Sankaran K. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19701-19706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter lipid modification step seems not to be conserved in Gram-positive eubacteria (4Tjalsma H. Zanen G.

In contrast to lipoproteins, secretory proteins are specifically processed by type I SPases (see Ref. 13Carlos J.L. Paezel M. Klenotic P.A. Strynadka N.C. Dalbey R.E. Dalbey R.E. Sigman D.S. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes: Co- and Post-translational Proteolysis of Proteins. 22. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2001: 27-55Google Scholar). In Gram-negative eubacteria, such as Escherichia coli, the outer membrane confines numerous proteins to the periplasm. In Gram-positive eubacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis andLactococcus lactis, which lack an outer membrane, lipid modification appears to be of major importance for the anchoring of exported proteins to the cytoplasmic membrane in order to prevent their release into the environment (14Antelmann H. Tjalsma H. Voigt B. Ohlmeier S. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Hecker M. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1484-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This may explain why the Gram-positive homologues of known periplasmic high affinity substrate-binding proteins of Gram-negative eubacteria appear to be lipoproteins. In fact, about one-third of the predicted lipoproteins ofB. subtilis (4Tjalsma H. Zanen G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Dalbey R.E. Sigman D.S. 3rd Ed.

Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1978; 31: 1203-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 19Yamagata H. Ippolito C. Inukai M. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 1163-1168PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the SPase II of B. subtilis was shown not to be essential for cell viability (12Tjalsma H. Kontinen V.P. Pragai Z. Wu H. Meima R. Venema G. Bron S. Sarvas M. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol.

This is the folding catalyst PrsA, a potential peptidyl-prolylcis/trans-isomerase of the parvulin type (20Kontinen V.P. Sarvas M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the processing, stability, and activity of several lipoproteins are strongly impaired in B. subtilis cells lacking SPase II (12Tjalsma H. Kontinen V.P. Pragai Z. Wu H. Meima R.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 685-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, these cells accumulate the lipid-modified precursor form of PrsA. In addition to pre-PrsA, amino-terminally processed and lipid-modified (mature-like) forms of PrsA are present in SPase II mutant B. subtilis cells. Notably, the secretion of α-amylase and a variety of other non-lipoproteins, which is PrsA-dependent, is strongly impaired in the absence of SPase II. The latter observation indicates that pre-PrsA and/or the mature-like forms of PrsA have a reduced activity (12Tjalsma H. Kontinen V.P. Pragai Z. Wu H. Meima R. Venema G. Bron S.

Hecker M. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1484-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The alternative processing of PrsA in the absence of SPase II is catalyzed by as yet unidentified proteases at the membrane-cell wall interface ofB. subtilis (12Tjalsma H. Kontinen V.P. Pragai Z.

In addition to a total number of 38 predicted chromosomally encoded lipoproteins (Table I), most lactococcal strains contain the plasmid-encoded lipoprotein PrtM, a close homologue of the PrsA protein of B. subtilis. PrtM is indispensable for the maturation and activation of PrtP, a serine protease that is initially synthesized as a pre-proprotein (22Siezen R.J. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1999; 76: 139-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Pre-pro-PrtP is converted to mature PrtP by SPase I-mediated signal peptide (pre-) removal and subsequent self-cleavage (23Haandrikman A.J. Meesters R. Laan H. Konings W.N. Kok J. Venema G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1991; 57: 1899-1904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, PrtP is the key enzyme in the release of peptides and amino acids from casein, and consequently, the activity of this protease is critical for growth of L. lactis in milk. In the absence of PrtM, PrtP is exported in its inactive pro-form, showing that PrtM-assisted folding of PrtP is required for the removal of the pro-peptide by self-cleavage (23Haandrikman A.J. Meesters R. Laan H. Konings W.N. Kok J. Venema G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1991; 57: 1899-1904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Haandrikman A.J. Kok J. Laan H. Soemitro S. Ledeboer A.M. Konings W.N.

In the present studies, we document the serendipitous identification and functional analysis of the SPase II-encoding lspA gene of L. lactis MG1363. This gene is not required for the growth of L. lactis on rich media or milk. Strikingly, no alternative processing of the lipoproteins PrtM and OppA was observed in cells lacking SPase II. The present findings unequivocally show for the first time that the removal of signal peptides from authentic lipoproteins, such as PrtM and OppA, is not essential for their biological activity in L. lactis. The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table II. TY medium for E. coli and B. subtilis contained Bactotryptone (1%), Bactoyeast extract (0.5%), and NaCl (1%). M9 media 1 and 2 for pulse-chase labeling of E. coli were prepared as described by van Dijl et al. (32van Dijl J.M. Smith H. Bron S. Venema G. Mol. Gen.

L. lactis was grown at 30 °C in 10% reconstituted skim milk (Oxoid Ltd.), 2-fold diluted M17 broth (Difco), or in whey-based medium (33de Vos W.M. Vos P. de Haard H. Boerrigter I.

DNA probes were labeled using the ECL oligonucleotide labeling and detection system (Amersham Biosciences). DNA sequences were determined using the dideoxy-chain termination procedure (39Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52242) Google Scholar). Clones were sequenced with universal, reverse, and synthetic primers using 35S-dATP (Amersham Biosciences) and the T7 polymerase sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences).

The sequence of the cloned chromosomal fragment containing the lactococcallspA gene is available under GenBankTM accession number U63724. To construct plasmid pGDL64, carrying the lspA gene ofL. lactis MG1363 (lspA (Lla)), a PCR was performed with the primers Lsp01 (5′-ACG CGTCGACTA TTT CTG AAA AGG GCT-3′) and Lsp02 (5′-TTT GAATTCTAC TTA CTG TCA CTC GTT-3′; restriction sites used for cloning are underlined and nucleotides complementary to chromosomal DNA of L. lactisMG1363 are in italics). The amplified fragment was cleaved withSalI and EcoRI and ligated into the corresponding sites of pGDL48 (31Meijer W.J.J. de Jong A. Wisman B.G. Tjalsma H. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) in such a way that lspA transcription is driven by the constitutive erythromycin promoter. To construct the L. lactis lspA mutant strain MG1363Δlsp, the plasmid pORI280-based chromosomal integration-excision system developed by Leenhouts et al.(29Leenhouts K. Buist G. Bolhuis A. ten Berge A. Kiel J. Mierau I. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Kok J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 41Leenhouts K. Venema G. Kok J. Methods Cell Sci. 1998; 20: 35-50Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was used. For this purpose, two fragments of thelspA region were amplified by PCR. First, a 515-bp fragment containing the 5′-end of lspA and upstream sequences was amplified by PCR with primers lspA1 (5′-AAA TTT TCTAGAGCA AAG AAA GAG AGG TC-3′) and lspA2 (5′-CGCGCGGCCGCT TATTTA TTT AAG CAA CAA CCC AAT TTT TGA AAA CTT GG-3′; nucleotides generating stop codons in all three reading frames are indicated in boldface). This fragment was cloned into theXbaI and NotI sites of pORI280. Subsequently, a 740-bp fragment containing the 3′-end of lspA was amplified with primers lspA3 (5′-TAA ATA AAT AAGCGGCCGCGC GCA ACT TGG AGA TAC AAA AAA AAT TTG GCC-3′) andlspA4 (5′-AAA TTT AGATCTGCA TGT CCT GCC GCA GG-3′). This fragment was cloned into theNotI and BglII sites of the pORI280 derivative already containing the 5′-sequences of lspA. The resulting pORI280-Δlsp deletion vector was used to transformL. lactis MG1363 for chromosomal integration into thelspA gene. Transformants (erythromycin-resistant and blue on M17 plates with X-gal) were grown in the absence of erythromycin as described before (29Leenhouts K. Buist G. Bolhuis A. ten Berge A. Kiel J. Mierau I. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Kok J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Subsequently, 21 white colonies were obtained on M17 plates with X-gal (frequency 5.3 × 10−5), all of which were erythromycin-sensitive due to the excision of pORI280-Δlsp from the chromosome. As verified by cleavage of chromosomal DNA with NotI and SspI and subsequent Southern blotting, the lspA gene of 9 of these 21 colonies (frequency 2.3 × 10−5) had been replaced with the mutant lspA gene of pORI280-Δlsp. Notably, the mutant lspA gene can be distinguished from the wild-type lspA gene in Southern blotting experiments due to the replacement of an SspI restriction site with aNotI site. The frequencies at which LacZ− andlspA mutant colonies were obtained were well within the range of those found for the mutation of other non-essential L. lactis genes with this system (29Leenhouts K. Buist G. Bolhuis A. ten Berge A. Kiel J. Mierau I. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Kok J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The resulting L. lactis strain MG1363Δlsp contains an lspAgene that is truncated after the 26th codon due to the replacement of a 6-bp internal fragment with a 22-bp fragment containing stop codons in all three reading frames. Cell extracts of E. coli, B. subtilis, and L. lactis were prepared as described previously (42van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Smith H. Bron S. Venema G. Mol. Gen.

For growth measurements, overnight cultures of L. lactis strains in Glucose M17 medium or whey-based permeate were diluted 100-fold in the respective fresh media. Overnight cultures in milk were diluted 50-fold in pre-warmed fresh milk. Absorbances at 600 nm were monitored in time using a Novaspec II spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences). The absorbance of cultures in milk was determined as described by Mierau et al. (47Mierau I. Haandrikman A.J. Velterop O. Tan P.S. Leenhouts K. Konings W.N. Venema G. Kok J. J.

https://openalex.org/W2064802072,"MSH2 and MLH1 have a central role in correcting mismatches in DNA occurring during DNA replication and have been implicated in the engagement of apoptosis induced by a number of cytotoxic anticancer agents. The function of MLH1 is not clearly defined, although it is required for mismatch repair (MMR) and engagement of apoptosis after certain types of DNA damage. In order to identify other partners of MLH1 that may be involved in signalling MMR or apoptosis, we used human MLH1 in yeast two-hybrid screens of normal human breast and ovarian cDNA libraries. As well as known partners of MLH1 such as PMS1, MLH3 and MBD4, we identified the carboxy terminus of the human c-MYC proto-oncogene as an interacting sequence. We demonstrate, both in vitro by yeast two-hybrid and GST-fusion pull-down experiments, as well as in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation from human tumour cell extracts, that MLH1 interacts with the c-MYC protein. We further demonstrate that the heterodimeric partner of c-MYC, MAX, interacts with a different MMR protein, MSH2, both in vitro and in vivo. Using an inducible c-MYC-ER fusion gene, we show that elevated c-MYC expression leads to an increased HGPRT mutation rate of Rat1 cells and an increase in the number of frameshift mutants at the HGPRT locus. The effect on HGPRT mutation rate is small (2-3-fold), but is consistent with deregulated c-MYC expression partially inhibiting MMR activity."
https://openalex.org/W2079885013,"The inhibition of histone deacetylase activity is known to induce morphological changes of transformed cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of the specific HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), on colon carcinoma cell lines. Treatment of human colorectal carcinoma cells, KM1214 and KM12SM, with TSA induced distinct morphological changes. Both cell lines, which normally piled up in layers without clear boundary, became more flattened, and formed monolayers with evident boundaries between cells, with concomitant increased actin filament organization. Cell–cell interaction was not affected much, based on expression level, membrane localization, and interaction of E-cadherin with β-catenin. In contrast, syndecan-2 expression was dramatically reduced and it was correlated with the morphological changes of colon carcinoma cells. Consistently, downregulation of syndecan-2 expression by antisense cDNA clearly mimicked the morphological changes in KM12SM and reduced anchorage-independent growth of colon cancer cells. All these results indicate that reduced syndecan-2 expression correlates with TSA-induced morphological changes and reduced tumorigenic activity in colon carcinoma cells."

Gel electrophoresis of fresh Aऔ-(1–42) and Aऔ-(1–42) aged for 48 h showed that aged Aऔ-(1–42) consisted of ∼747 of the protein as a tetramer, whereas the fresh Aऔ-(1–42) showed only 117 of the protein as a tetramer (28Mason R.P. Jacob R.F. Walter M.F. Mason P.E. Avdulov N.A. Chochina S.V. Igbavboa U. Wood W.G. J. Biol.

The effects of Aऔ-(1–42) on Golgi complex cholesterol could involve activity of PC-PLD, and this possible action of Aऔ-(1–42) was examined. In addition, it has been reported that apoE levels were increased in astrocytes treated with aged Aऔ-(1–42) (18LaDu M.J. Shah J.A. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. Bu G. Hu J. Guo L. Van Eldik L.J. J. Biol.

Experiments were conducted using fresh and aged Aऔ-(1–42) in immortalized DITNC1 astrocytes (29Radany E.H. Brenner M. Besnard F. Bigornia V. Bishop J.M. Deschepper C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6467-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Two different methods were used to determine the effects of Aऔ-(1–42) on Golgi cholesterol content of astrocytes: 1) confocal microscopy using the fluorescent cholesterol analogue NBD-cholesterol and a fluorescent marker for the Golgi complex, BODIPY TR ceramide (30Harrington E.O.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7390-7397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar); and 2) isolation of the Golgi complex into two different fractions thought to represent different regions of the Golgi complex using sucrose density gradient centrifugation (31Lucocq J.M.

Parasitol. 1996; 83: 174-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The results presented herein provide new insights into interaction of Aऔ and cholesterol. We show that fresh Aऔ-(1–42) has a strikingly different effect on cholesterol levels in the Golgi complex of astrocytes as compared with aged Aऔ-(1–42). Incubation of astrocytes with fresh Aऔ-(1–42) significantly increased cholesterol levels, whereas aged Aऔ-(1–42) significantly reduced cholesterol levels in the Golgi complex as shown by fluorescent probes and confocal microscopy. The reverse peptide Aऔ-(42–1), either fresh or aged, did not alter Golgi complex cholesterol levels, which argues against a nonspecific action of Aऔ-(1–42). Isolation of the astrocyte Golgi complex into different fractions revealed the novel finding that the effects of fresh Aऔ-(1–42) on cholesterol content were opposite on the two Golgi fractions, whereas aged Aऔ-(1–42) had effects similar to those observed with confocal microscopy. PC-PLD activity, cell membrane cholesterol, and apoE levels of astrocytes were associated with effects of fresh Aऔ-(1–42) on cholesterol levels but not with effects of aged Aऔ-(1–42), suggesting different mechanisms for actions of fresh and aged Aऔ-(1–42) on Golgi complex cholesterol. Our data suggest that extracellular Aऔ-(1–42) specifically targets the Golgi complex and disrupts cholesterol homeostasis. NBD-cholesterol (22-(N-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino-23,24-bisnor-5-cholen-3-औ-ol), BODIPY TR ceramide, and the Amplex® Red phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D (A-12219) assay kit were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Aऔ-(1–42) and Aऔ-(42–1) were purchased from Bachem California Inc. (Torrance, CA). Fetal bovine serum was obtained from HyClone (Logan, UT). UDP-[6-3H]galactose was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The Aऔ-(1–42) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (catalogue no. 17711) was obtained from Immuno-Biological Laboratories (Minneapolis, MN). All other chemicals unless specifically mentioned were purchased from Sigma. DITNC1 rat astrocytes were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). These cells have been shown to have the phenotypic characteristics of type 1 astrocytes (29Radany E.H. Brenner M. Besnard F. Bigornia V. Bishop J.M. Deschepper C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6467-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Astrocyte cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 107 fetal bovine serum and 57 glutamate for 2 days until confluence and maintained at 37 °C in 57 CO2 and at 907 relative humidity. The cells at 80–857 confluence were treated with medium containing 17 lipoprotein-deficient serum replacing the 107 fetal bovine serum and incubated for 16 h prior to experimentation. All experiments were done using confluent astrocytes. Astrocytes were grown on Lab-TekTMchamber slides, incubated with NBD-cholesterol (8 ॖm) for 1 h, and then washed three times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Fresh Aऔ-(1–42) (1 ॖm) or Aऔ-(1–42) (1 ॖm) preincubated for 48 h (aged) was added to cells and incubated for different time periods (30, 60, and 120 min). We have reported previously that incubation of Aऔ-(1–42) for 48 h resulted in ∼747 of the peptide in a tetrameric form (28Mason R.P. Jacob R.F. Walter M.F. Mason P.E. Avdulov N.A. Chochina S.V. Igbavboa U. Wood W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18801-18807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In some experiments the reverse peptide Aऔ-(42–1) (fresh or aged for 48 h) was incubated with cells. Following incubation with Aऔ, cells were rinsed three times with PBS, and the Golgi marker BODIPY TR ceramide (2 ॖm) was added and incubated with the cells for 1 h. Cells were then washed with PBS, fixed with 47 paraformaldehyde, and mounted for confocal microscopy using Gel/Mount (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA). Confocal fluorescence imaging was performed on an Olympus Fluoview laser scanning confocal imaging system (Olympus America Inc., New York). Images were captured using multiple photomultiplier tubes regulated by Fluoview 2.0 software (Olympus). Excitation of the fluorescent probes was accomplished using 15-milliwatt krypton-argon lasers with 5-milliwatt output. An Olympus BX 50 fluorescent microscope was used to capture the images using an oil immersion objective. NBD-cholesterol was excited at 488 nm, and emission was recorded at 540 nm. BODIPY TR ceramide was excited at 568 nm, and emission was recorded at 598 nm. The captured images for the red and green channels were merged and appeared yellow, which is indicative of colocalization. Red and green are additive, generating yellow to orange in RGB (red-green-blue) color space (33Atshaves B.P. Starodub O. McIntosh A. Petrescu A. Roths J.B. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Biol.

Isolation of the Golgi complex was accomplished using sucrose density gradient centrifugation (32Andrés J. Diaz M. Monteiro-Leal L.H. De Souza W. Exp. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 174-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Confluent astrocytes were treated with fresh and aged Aऔ-(1–42) as described above. Cells were harvested and washed twice with PBS. The cells were suspended in G buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.25m sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) containing 10 mm CaCl2. Leupeptin and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were added to the cell suspension to inhibit proteolytic enzymes prior to homogenization. The cells were homogenized in a Potter-type homogenizer with 20–30 strokes using a serrated homogenizing pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was suspended and homogenized in 1.4 m sucrose and overlayered with 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 m sucrose gradients in ultracentrifuge tubes. Samples were then centrifuged at 95,000 × g for 2.5 h in a SW28 rotor in a Beckman L8–70 ultracentrifuge. Each interface was carefully removed, diluted with G buffer, and centrifuged in an SS34 rotor at 45,900 × g for 20 min. Each pellet was suspended in buffer and used for the experiments. Protein concentrations of the fractions were determined using the Bradford assay. Cholesterol content in each fraction was determined enzymatically in a microassay using a diagnostic kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (35Auerbach B.J. Parks J.S. Applebaum-Bowden D. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 30: 738-742Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and procedures reported by our laboratory (36Wood W.G. Igbavboa U. Rao A.M. Schroeder F. Avdulov N.A.

A marker enzyme of the Golgi complex is galactosyltransferase, and activity of this enzyme was measured using procedures reported previously (32Andrés J. Diaz M. Monteiro-Leal L.H. De Souza W. Exp. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 174-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 39Sztul E. Kaplin A. Saucan L. Palade G. Cell. 1991; 64: 81-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The incubation mixture contained 7 mg/ml ovalbumin, 2 mm ATP, 200 mm MgCl2, 0.27 Triton X-100, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8). The reaction was initiated by adding [3H]UDP-galactose to samples and incubated for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding ice-cold 247 trichloroacetic acid. The precipitate was pelleted at 20,800 × g and washed three times with 127 trichloroacetic acid. Samples were solubilized in 57 SDS, and disintegrations/min were counted using a scintillation counter. PC-PLD activity of control astrocytes and astrocytes that had been incubated with either fresh or aged Aऔ-(1–42) for different time periods (30, 60, 90, and 120 min) was quantified using the Amplex Red PC-PLD assay kit (Molecular Probes). The intensity of the Amplex Red complex formed was measured in a fluorescence microplate reader (Spectra Max Gemini XS, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) using an excitation wavelength of 542 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. Quantitative determination of Aऔ-(1–42) in the G1 and G2 fractions was carried out using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from Immuno-Biological Laboratories. This kit uses a solid phase sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay protocol with anti-human Aऔ-(38–42) rabbit IgG as primary antibody in a precoated plate and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human Aऔ-(11–28) mouse IgG as secondary conjugated antibody. Briefly, standards and test samples were diluted in a buffer consisting of 17 bovine serum albumin and 0.057 Tween 20 in PBS. Test samples as well as sample and reagent blanks were added to the precoated plate and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After binding, the wells were washed (seven times) prior to adding conjugated secondary antibody and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing (nine times), the chromogen containing tetramethylbenzidine was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Color reaction was terminated by the stop solution, and measurement was performed at 450 nm using a Packard Fusion AlphaScreen microplate analyzer (Packard Instrument Co.). In each assay, a standard curve was constructed after subtracting absorbance of the test sample blank. Data for test samples were converted to ng of Aऔ-(1–42)/mg of protein. Media of control cells and cells treated with either fresh or aged Aऔ-(1–42) were removed, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added as a protease inhibitor. The media were centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min, and the resulting supernatant was treated with 157 trichloric acid to precipitate protein, washed with cold methanol, dried, and kept at −20 °C for later use. Cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA, and protein values were determined using the Bradford method with ovalbumin standards. Cells were treated with lysing buffer containing 8m urea, 57 SDS, and 57 औ-mercaptoethanol. For Western blot analysis of lysates and conditioned media, 1 ॖl of 1m dithiothreitol and 1 ॖl of 0.27 bromphenol solution was added to every 50 ॖl of lysing buffer before use, and samples were kept at 70 °C for 30 min. 100–200 ॖg of protein were electrophoresed on a 7.57 SDS, Tricine, HCl precast gel (Bio-Rad), and proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with monoclonal mouse anti-rat apoE (1:250) from BD Laboratory (San Diego, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:20,000) was used as a secondary antibody (Pierce). Immunoreactivity was visualized with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Band density was quantitated by densitometry using the Eagle Eye II video system and EagleSight software (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Experiments in this study tested the hypothesis that Aऔ-(1–42) would modify cholesterol distribution in the Golgi complex of astrocytes and that the effects of Aऔ-(1–42) on cholesterol distribution would be dependent on whether Aऔ-(1–42) was fresh or aged. Two different methods were used to determine cholesterol distribution in the Golgi complex. 1) A fluorescent cholesterol analogue, NBD-cholesterol, and a fluorescent marker for the Golgi complex, BODIPY TR ceramide, were used and imaged with confocal microscopy; and 2) sucrose density gradient centrifugation was used to isolate two different fractions of the Golgi complex, and cholesterol levels were determined enzymatically. BODIPY TR ceramide, NBD-cholesterol, and confocal microscopy were used to initially examine the effects of fresh and aged Aऔ-(1–42) on Golgi cholesterol content of astrocytes. Cells were incubated with Aऔ-(1–42) for different time periods (30, 60, and 120 min). Cell viability as measured by trypan blue was not altered by incubation of cells with fresh or aged Aऔ-(1–42) for 120 min. Means ± S.E. of the percentage of viable cells for control astrocytes, astrocytes incubated with fresh Aऔ-(1–42), and astrocytes incubated with aged Aऔ-(1–42) were 96.83 ± 0.58, 94.2 ± 1.5, and 97.83 ± 0.6, respectively. Confocal images of colocalization of NBD-cholesterol and BODIPY TR ceramide in control astrocytes and astrocytes incubated with fresh and aged Aऔ-(1–42) for 120 min are shown in Fig. 1. Panel C shows colocalization of the two fluorescent probes in control astrocytes. It can be seen in panel F that colocalization was greater in astrocytes treated with fresh Aऔ-(1–42), whereas aged Aऔ-(1–42) (panel I) reduced colocalization as compared with control astrocytes and astrocytes incubated with fresh Aऔ-(1–42). Analysis of colocalization data using MetaMorph software and expressed as percent colocalization shows that fresh Aऔ-(1–42) (p≤ 0.001) increased colocalization in the Golgi complex of astrocytes as compared with control astrocytes (38 versus 237) at the 120-min incubation period (Fig. 2). The percent colocalization of the fluorescent probes was significantly (p ≤ 0.01) less when astrocytes were incubated with aged Aऔ-(1–42) (15 versus 237) for 120 min as compared with control astrocytes (Fig. 2). Shorter incubation times with Aऔ-(1–42) did not significantly alter colocalization, although it can be seen in Fig. 2 that fresh Aऔ-(1–42) was increasing colocalization and aged Aऔ-(1–42) was reducing colocalization at the shorter incubation times. Colocalization was not altered by a lower concentration (1 nmol) of fresh Aऔ-(1–42) or aged Aऔ-(1–42). Means ± S.E. of percent colocalization of NBD-cholesterol and BODIPY TR ceramide were 23.71 ± 3.7, 25.82 ± 4.7, and 23.33 ± 2.1 for control astrocytes, astrocytes incubated with fresh Aऔ-(1–42), and astrocytes incubated with aged Aऔ-(1–42), respectively. To determine whether the effects of Aऔ-(1–42) were specific and not attributable to a nonspecific perturbation of the Golgi complex we incubated astrocytes for 120 min with the reverse peptide Aऔ-(42–1) that was either fresh or aged for 48 h. Neither fresh nor aged Aऔ-(42–1) had an effect on the percent colocalization of BODIPY TR ceramide and NBD-cholesterol when compared with control astrocytes or with each other (Fig. 2).Figure 2Percent colocalization of BODIPY TR ceramide and NBD-cholesterol in astrocytes incubated with fresh and aged Aऔ-(1–42) for different time periods and astrocytes incubated with Aऔ-(42–1) for 120 min.

The Golgi complex is heterogenous in structure and function and may not be equally affected by Aऔ-(1–42). To further define the effects of fresh and aged Aऔ-(1–42) on cholesterol distribution in the Golgi complex of astrocytes, the Golgi complex was isolated using sucrose density centrifugation, and two different fractions were obtained that are thought to represent different regions of the Golgi complex (32Andrés J.

We have recently shown that expression of an activated allele of Fes (Fesact) in monocyte precursors resulted in their differentiation into functional macrophages through the activation of lineage-specific transcription factors. We now report that this kinase also plays a role in the survival and terminal differentiation of granulocyte progenitors. The expression of Fesact in factor-dependent 32D cells prevented their apoptotic death after interleukin-3 removal, but Fesact-expressing cells remained factor-dependent for proliferation. Removal of interleukin-3 from the Fesact-expressing cells was followed by granulocytic differentiation in the absence of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor within 4–8 days. The differentiated cells had distinctive granulocyte morphology and there was up-regulation of CD11b, Gr-1, and late differentiation markers such as lactoferrin, suggesting that this kinase induced terminal granulocytic differentiation. Concomitantly, Fesact down-regulated the macrophage marker F4/80, suggesting that the biological activity of Fes was coordinated in a lineage-specific manner. Further analysis showed that Fesact caused activation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α and STAT3, two transcription factors that are involved in granulocyte differentiation.

One of the transcription factors involved in granulocytic differentiation is CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)1 α: the promoters of G-CSFR and other granulocytic genes contain binding sites for C/EBP-α (1Clarke S.

The importance of this transcription factor for normal myelopoiesis is underlined by the recent finding that a subset of acute myeloid leukemias exhibit heterozygous mutations in the C/EBP-α protein. This results in truncated C/EBP-α molecules, which act as dominant negative mutants and block the expression of C/EBP-α target genes (6Pabst T. Mueller B.U. Zhang P. Radomska H.S. Narravula S.

Biol. 2002; 245: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), monocyte-macrophages and granulocytes (18Feldman R.A. Gabrilove J.L. Tam J.P. Moore M.A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mathey-Prevot B. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Expression studies with clonedfps/fes genes have provided considerable evidence that this kinase is involved in macrophage differentiation. The expression of human c-fps/fes in K562 erythroleukemia cells resulted in their differentiation to macrophage-like cells (21Yu G. Smithgall T.E. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10276-10281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas infection of avian bone marrow progenitors with v-fps/fes viruses led to macrophage differentiation without added M-CSF (22Carmier J.F. Samarut J. Cell. 1986; 44: 159-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). More recently we reported that a gain-of-function allele of Fes (Fesact) was capable of inducing terminal macrophage differentiation of U937 cells and other monocyte progenitors. This was accompanied by activation of PU.1, a transcription factor that is essential for macrophage development, providing evidence that Fes may regulate macrophage maturation through activation of lineage-specific transcription factors (23Kim J. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1903-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although much less is known about the biological role of Fes in granulocytes, this kinase is likely to be an important regulatory molecule in this cell type. Antisense inhibition of Fes expression during retinoic acid-induced granulocytic differentiation of HL60 cells leads to apoptosis (24Manfredini R. Grande A. Tagliafico E. Barbieri D. Zucchini P. Citro G. Zupi G. Franceschi C. Torelli U. Ferrari S. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting a role of this kinase in the survival of differentiating granulocytic cells. More recently, it was reported that both Fes and the Fes-related kinase Fer can be activated after cross-linking of high affinity Fc receptor (FcεRI) in mast cells (25Craig A.W. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6363-6374Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, Fes and Fer may have overlapping functions in leukocytes. To further investigate the possible functions of Fes in granulocytes we have introduced Fesact into 32D, an IL-3-dependent cell line that undergoes granulocytic differentiation in the presence of G-CSF (26Rovera G. Valtieri M. Mavilio F. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1987; 1: 29-35PubMed Google Scholar, 27Valtieri M. Tweardy D.J. Caracciolo D. Johnson K. Mavilio F. Altmann S. Santoli D. Rovera G. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3829-3835PubMed Google Scholar). These cells have a normal karyotype, are non-tumorigenic, and have characteristics of normal granulocyte progenitors. Therefore, they have been used extensively as a model to study the mechanisms involved in granulocytic differentiation. Here we report that expression of Fesactin 32D protected these cells from apoptosis after IL-3 withdrawal, and that this was followed by terminal granulocyte differentiation in the absence of G-CSF. We also found that Fesact expression caused the transcriptional activation of C/EBP-α and STAT3. Our results suggest that Fes kinase may contribute to the regulation of myeloid gene expression during granulopoiesis through the activation of specific transcription factors. 32D and WeHi-3B cells (27Valtieri M. Tweardy D.J. Caracciolo D. Johnson K. Mavilio F. Altmann S. Santoli D. Rovera G. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3829-3835PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from Weiqun Li (Georgetown University, Washington, DC). 32D cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin, and 5% WeHi-3B conditioned medium as a source of murine IL-3. The amphotropic retroviral packaging cell line Phoenix ampho was grown as described (23Kim J. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1903-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For differentiation with G-CSF, 32D cells were incubated with 20 ng/ml recombinant murine G-CSF for the indicated times in the absence of IL-3. Human c-Fes and Fesact cDNAs, the IRES-GFP-containing retroviral vector MigR1, MigR1-c-Fes, MigR1-Fesact, and the pCEFL vector were previously described (23Kim J. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1903-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Details of construction of pCEFL-Fesact are available upon request. Luciferase reporters containing a 4× tandemly repeated C/EBP-α element, a wild type G-CSFR promoter that spans bp −1324 to +67, and a mutant C/EBP-α G-CSFR promoter that has a mutation from bp −49 to −45, corresponding to the C/EBP-α binding site, were obtained from Daniel Tenen (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) (2Smith L.T. Hohaus S. Gonzalez D.A. Dziennis S.E. Tenen D.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 1234-1247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA probes to lactoferrin, lysozyme, and myeloperoxidase were obtained from Alan Friedman (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) (28Friedman A.D. Krieder B.L. Venturelli D. Rovera G. Blood. 1991; 78: 2426-2432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was carried out as we described (29Areces L.B. Dello Sbarba P. Jucker M. Stanley E.R. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The transfection of Phoenix ampho cells with retroviral constructs, virus production, and infection of 32D cells were carried out as described previously (23Kim J. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1903-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). 32D cells infected with MigR1-Fesact virus were selected by incubation without IL-3 for 2 days. After this time dead cells were removed by centrifugation in HistopaqueTM (Sigma). The live cells were then expanded by incubation in IL-3 medium for 2–5 days. To assess the biological properties of Fesact, the cells were again resuspended in medium without IL-3 and analyzed as described in the text. For transient transfection analysis, 32D cells were transfected with 15 μg of total plasmid DNA by electroporation. Transfection efficiency was normalized using a cotransfected promoter-less renilla vector pRL-0 (Promega, Madison, WI). Transactivation of the luciferase-linked C/EBP-α element and G-CSFR promoter were assayed 16 h after transfection using a dual luciferase kit from Promega. Flow cytometric analysis was carried out as previously described (23Kim J. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1903-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For surface marker staining, we used Phycoerythrin-labeled antibodies against murine CD11b and Gr-1 (BD Pharmingen), and Phycoerythrin-labeled antibodies against F4/80 (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The preparation of cell lysates, immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting with specific antibodies were carried out as previously described (23Kim J. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1903-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-Fes antibodies have been previously described (30Jucker M. McKenna K. da Silva A.J. Rudd C.E. Feldman R.A. J.

The antibodies to phosphotyrosine (PY99), C/EBP-α, STAT3, and IL-3Rα were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to phospho-STAT3 (Y705) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The preparation of nuclear protein extracts and gel shift assays (EMSA) were carried out as previously described (23Kim J. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell.

To gain insight into the possible role of Fes in granulocyte development we expressed Fesact, a constitutively active form of Fes in 32D cells. The recently described Fesact is a chimera between human and avianfps/fes cognate genes in which part of the kinase domain of human c-fes was replaced with the corresponding region from avian v-fps (Fig.1A). Fesact is isogenic and colinear with both human c-Fes and avian v-Fps (23Kim J. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1903-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fesact was introduced into 32D cells by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer using the IRES-GFP vector MigR1 (33Pear W.S. Miller J.P. Xu L. Pui J.C. Soffer B. Quackenbush R.C. Pendergast A.M. Bronson R. Aster J.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Blood. 1998; 92: 3780-3792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 32D cells were infected with MigR1, MigR1-c-Fes, or MigR1-Fesact viruses (Fig. 1A) in the presence of IL-3 and 2 days later, IL-3 was removed from the culture medium. The uninfected, vector-, and c-Fes-infected 32D cells underwent apoptosis within 2 days of IL-3 withdrawal, but about 30% of the Fesact-infected 32D cells survived without IL-3. All of the surviving cells were green fluorescent, indicating that only Fesact-expressing cells were protected from apoptosis (Fig. 1B). This enabled us to rapidly isolate a population where 100% of the cells expressed Fesact. In the absence of IL-3, Fesact-infected cells remained viable for several days but their cell numbers did not appreciably increase (Fig. 2,A and B). This indicated that Fesactpromoted the survival of 32D cells deprived of IL-3 but had no significant mitogenic effect. In the presence of IL-3, uninfected and Fes-infected cells proliferated at the same rate (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 3, Fesacthad no significant effect on the levels of expression of IL-3 receptor, as determined by immunoblot analysis using antibodies directed against the α subunit of IL-3 receptor.Figure 2Growth curve and viability of Fesact-infected 32D cells. 32D cells infected with Fesact virus were isolated and expanded as described under “Materials and Methods.” After expansion, Fesact-infected cells were cultured in the presence or absence of IL-3 for the indicated times. Viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion (A), and cell numbers were determined using a hemocytometer (B). Cell numbers and viability were also followed in 32D cultures grown in the presence or absence of IL-3, and in 32D cultures treated with G-CSF in the absence of IL-3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Activated Fes does not affect the expression of IL-3 receptor. 32D cells were infected with MigR1-Fesact viruses and the cells were allowed to differentiate in the absence of IL-3 for 4 days after which time, the cells were lysed. Total cell lysates (25 μg) from control 32D cells (lane 1) and from Fesact-infected 32D cultures (lane 2) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (8.5% gel) followed by immunoblotting (WB, Western blot) with specific antibodies to the α subunit of IL-3 receptor.

The position of IL-3Rα is indicated by anarrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We conclude from these results that activated Fes protected 32D cells from apoptosis caused by IL-3 withdrawal. This was not secondary to a mitogenic effect because Fesact-expressing cells remained factor-dependent for proliferation. We then examined whether Fesact had any other biological activity in 32D cells. To this end, 32D cells were infected with Fesact followed by selection in the absence of IL-3 for 2 days. The surviving Fesact-infected population was then allowed to expand for 3 days by supplementing the culture medium with IL-3. No phenotypic changes were detectable at the end of this period. Because IL-3 suppresses the biological activity of G-CSF and may also interfere with that of Fesact, IL-3 was removed from the Fesact-infected population once again, and the cells were monitored for phenotypic changes. Remarkably, the Fesact-expressing cells differentiated into granulocytes (Fig. 4A, panels D1and D2). Differentiation by Fes required IL-3 deprivation for a total of 4–8 days, including the initial selection step. These cells acquired a characteristic mature granulocyte morphology, namely smaller cell size and multilobulated nuclei. Control uninfected 32D cells treated with G-CSF displayed granulocyte morphology within 5 days, and at day 9 more cells showed typical nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 4A, panels B andC). The highly fragmented nuclei seen after 9 days in G-CSF were not readily observed in Fesact-expressing 32D cells, indicating that Fesact-induced differentiation was not as complete as that obtained with G-CSF. Nevertheless, the mature granulocyte type was found in about 20% of this Fesact-expressing population, whereas the rest exhibited intermediate or normal blast morphologies. By comparison, after 5 days in G-CSF-containing medium, about 30% of the treated 32D cells underwent terminal differentiation. IL-3 greatly suppressed both G-CSF- and Fesact-dependent granulocytic differentiation (data not shown). Essentially the same results were obtained whether the source of IL-3 used to propagate uninfected or Fesact-infected 32D cells was recombinant IL-3- or WeHi-conditioned medium. In the experiments described above, Fesact-infected cells were reincubated with IL-3 after the initial IL-3 deprivation step, before removing it again to allow completion of differentiation. The expansion phase in IL-3 was done to obtain enough cells for our biochemical analysis, but it was not necessary to observe Fes-dependent differentiation. If the IL-3 expansion step was omitted, the Fesact-expressing cells differentiated to the same extent as those that were expanded in IL-3 (Fig. 4A, panel D3). To further characterize the biological activity of Fesact, we analyzed the expression of differentiation markers in Fesact-infectedversus control 32D cells. As shown in Fig. 4B, Fesact up-regulated the expression of the common myeloid marker CD11b and the granulocyte-specific marker Gr-1 by severalfold, whereas expression of the macrophage-specific marker F4/80 was down-regulated by this kinase (Fig. 4B). Treatment of control 32D cells with G-CSF for 5 days was more efficient than Fesact in inducing CD11b and Gr-1 expression, but G-CSF was slower than Fesact in down-regulating F4/80. Like G-CSF, Fesact induced the expression of lysozyme and lactoferrin, two markers of late granulocytic differentiation, whereas expression of the early marker myeloperoxidase was down-regulated by Fes (Fig. 5). Although the time kinetics of up- and down-regulation of lineage-specific markers by Fesact and G-CSF was slightly different, their overall biological activities on granulocytic differentiation were comparable. We conclude from these results that Fesact is capable of regulating myeloid gene expression in a lineage-specific manner. The extent of differentiation by Fes was not as complete as that induced by G-CSF. This suggests that under physiological conditions, additional cooperating signals are required to complete the granulocyte differentiation program. Nevertheless, the remarkable biological activity of Fesact we observed suggests that Fes kinase may play a key role in granulopoiesis. Since Fesact was able to induce granulocyte differentiation, we examined whether this kinase activated transcription factors that are important for myeloid development (1Clarke S. Gordon S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 153-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To this end, we carried out EMSA of nuclear extracts from Fesact-infected 32D cells. As shown in Fig.6A, lanes 3–5, both G-CSF and Fesact induced DNA-binding activity of STAT3. This activity was competed out by excess unlabeled specific oligonucleotide, but not by a nonspecific oligonucleotide (Fig.6A, lanes 6 and 7). The addition of anti-STAT3 antibodies to the EMSA reaction resulted in a band supershift (Fig. 6A, lane 8), confirming the presence of STAT3 in the DNA-binding complexes induced by Fes. Transcriptional activation of STAT3 requires its phosphorylation on Tyr-705 (15Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Consistent with the results of our EMSA, Fesact induced the phosphorylation of STAT3 on Tyr-705, as determined by immunoblot analysis using phosphospecific antibodies (Fig. 6B, lanes 3 and 4). The phosphorylated species migrated as a doublet, which probably corresponds to STAT3-α and its spliced form STAT3-β. Neither G-CSF treatment or Fesact expression had any detectable effect on the expression levels of STAT3 (Fig. 6B). Fesact also induced binding of nuclear extracts to an oligonucleotide that is specific for C/EBP family members (Fig.7). This band was competed out by excess unlabeled specific oligonucleotide, but not by a nonspecific oligonucleotide (Fig. 7A, lanes 6 and7). G-CSF also induced DNA binding to this oligonucleotide (Fig. 7A, lane 3). Although the G-CSF- and Fes-induced complexes had slightly different electrophoretic mobilities, anti-C/EBP-α antibodies caused a supershift of both transcriptional complexes indicating that they contained C/EBP-α (Fig. 7A, lanes 8 and 9). Neither G-CSF treatment nor Fesact expression modified the expression levels of C/EBP-α (data not shown). Whether other C/EBP family members are also activated by Fes will require further analysis. As shown in Fig. 7B, the expression of Fesact in 32D cells had no detectable effect on the DNA binding activity of PU.1. We conclude from these results that in 32D cells, Fesact induced the formation of C/EBP-α and STAT3 DNA-binding complexes. To further examine the ability of Fes to induce transcriptional activation of C/EBP-α, we analyzed whether Fesact was able to transactivate a minimal luciferase-linked promoter containing 4 tandem repeats of the C/EBP-α-binding site. As shown in Fig.8, Fesact was able to transactivate this C/EBP-α element. Since C/EBP-α is essential for transcription of the G-CSFR gene (2Smith L.T. Hohaus S. Gonzalez D.A. Dziennis S.E. Tenen D.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 1234-1247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Zhang P. Iwama A. Datta M.W. Darlington G.J. Link D.C. Tenen D.G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we also examined whether Fesact would be able to transactivate the G-CSFR promoter. Fesact transactivated the G-CSFR promoter, but not a promoter with a mutation in the C/EBP-α site (Fig. 8). We conclude from these results that Fesact can induce terminal granulocytic differentiation and the transcriptional activation of C/EBP-α and STAT3. In this paper we present evidence that Fes kinase can regulate lineage-specific gene expression during granulocytic differentiation. We also identified the transcription factors C/EBP-α and STAT3 as potential Fes targets, which may mediate the biological activity of this kinase. Although 32D cells behave as granulocytic progenitors, these cells are still capable of differentiating along the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Introduction of another tyrosine kinase, M-CSF receptor, into 32D cells allowed them to undergo partial monocytic differentiation in the presence of M-CSF (35Pierce J.H. Di Marco E. Cox G.W. Lombardi D. Ruggiero M. Varesio L. Wang L.M. Choudhury G.G. Sakaguchi A.Y. Di Fiore P.P. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5613-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Also, ectopic expression of the transcription factor EGR-1 enabled these cells to undergo macrophage differentiation by GM-CSF treatment (36Krishnaraju K. Nguyen H.Q. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5499-5507Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Since Fesact was an inducer of macrophage differentiation in monocyte progenitors (23Kim J. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1903-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine whether in 32D cells, Fesact would induce macrophage or granulocytic differentiation, or both. By contrast with M-CSFR, Fesact was not able to change the lineage commitment of 32D cells but completed their granulocyte differentiation program. The results of these and our previous studies in monocytic cells (23Kim J. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1903-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) suggest that Fes may be involved in regulating the completion of terminal granulocyte and macrophage differentiation rather than a lineage decision step. How does Fes kinase contribute to the execution of alternative programs of myeloid gene expression? In 32D cells Fes activated STAT3 and C/EBP-α, two important regulators of granulocytic differentiation (3Zhang D.E. Zhang P. Wang N.D. Hetherington C.J. Darlington G.J. Tenen D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar,8McLemore M.L. Grewal S. Liu F. Archambault A. Poursine-Laurent J. Haug J. Link D.C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25184-25189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 38Wang Q.F. Friedman A.D. Blood. 2002; 99: 2776-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PU.1, a transcription factor that is essential for macrophage development but has a more limited role in granulopoiesis (5Wang X. Scott E. Sawyers C.L. Friedman A.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 560-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was activated by Fesact in U937 monoblasts but not in 32D cells. These results suggest that Fes may select its targets according to the lineage commitment stage of the cells, and that Fesact may induce granulocyte differentiation at least in part through transcriptional activation of STAT3 and C/EBP-α. The mechanism of activation of these factors may involve direct or indirect phosphorylation by Fes. In Fesact-expressing 32D cells, STAT3 was phosphorylated on Tyr-705, an event known to cause its transcriptional activation (15Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Whether Fes activation of C/EBP-α also involves the phosphorylation of this protein will have to be clarified in future experiments. Fesact protected 32D cells from apoptosis upon IL-3 withdrawal. This was not due to a conversion of the cells to factor independence because without IL-3, Fesact-expressing cells were essentially not dividing. By contrast with Fesact, the expression of v-Src, v-Abl, or Bcr-Abl in 32D cells does not result in differentiation but in their conversion to factor-independence and oncogenic transformation (26Rovera G. Valtieri M. Mavilio F. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1987; 1: 29-35PubMed Google Scholar, 39Cleveland J.L. Dean M. Rosenberg N. Wang J.Y. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5685-5695Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 40Cortez D. Reuther G. Pendergast A.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 41Kruger A. Anderson S.M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 245-256PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, among non-receptor tyrosine kinases, Fes has a unique ability to induce granulocytic differentiation in 32D cells. The fact that in 32D cells, both Fesact and G-CSF activated C/EBP-α and STAT3 suggests that Fes kinase may have utilized elements of the G-CSF pathway to drive granulocytic differentiation. There were also other similarities between the biological activities of G-CSF and Fesact: the time courses of granulocytic differentiation induced by G-CSF and active Fes were similar; G-CSF and Fesact induced granulocytic differentiation without IL-3, but their biological activity was greatly diminished in the presence of this cytokine; and both G-CSF and Fesact protected cells from apoptosis after IL-3 removal. Future experiments will be aimed at clarifying the functional relation of Fes to G-CSF and other cytokines that regulate granulocyte development. Considering the large body of evidence that Fes plays a role in myeloid cell development, the phenotype of Fes knockout mice is milder than expected. Hackenmiller et al. (42Hackenmiller R. Kim J. Feldman R.A. Simon M.C. Immunity. 2000; 13: 397-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) reported that some of the Fes−/− mice were compromised in their innate immunity, had low numbers of B cells, and elevated numbers of macrophages and granulocytes. Fes−/− macrophages exhibited defects in cell adhesion and GM-CSF signaling, pointing to incomplete maturation of their myeloid compartment. However, targeting of the Fes locus using a different strategy did not reveal alterations in the macrophage or granulocyte populations (43Zirngibl R.A. Senis Y. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2472-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This low penetrance of the Fes−/− phenotype may be a result of functional redundancy. A possible candidate that may compensate for the loss of Fes is the ubiquitously expressed Fer/NCP94 kinase, which has the same overall structure as Fes (18Feldman R.A. Gabrilove J.L. Tam J.P. Moore M.A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2379-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 19MacDonald I. Levy J. Pawson T. Mol. Cell.

Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1587-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that in mast cells, Fer and Fes were both activated by FcεRI cross-linking (25Craig A.W. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6363-6374Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, Fes and Fer may have overlapping functions in mast cells and basophils. These observations are consistent with the idea that in leukocytes, Fer may partially compensate for the absence of Fes. In granulocytes, functional complementation between Src family kinases has masked the phenotypic consequences of deleting single members of the family. For instance, defects in adhesion-dependent degranulation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils were observed only after ablation of both Hck and Fgr kinases (46Mocsai A. Ligeti E. Lowell C.A. Berton G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1120-1126PubMed Google Scholar). And defects in the respiratory burst response were only observed in neutrophils from hck−/−/fgr−/−/lyn−/− triple knockout mice (47Pereira S. Zhou M. Mocsai A. Lowell C. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4115-4123Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Since myeloid development can be regulated by multiple pathways (1Clarke S. Gordon S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 153-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 48Zhang P. Nelson E. Radomska H.S. Iwasaki-Arai J. Akashi K. Friedman A.D. Tenen D.G. Blood. 2002; 99: 4406-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), it is likely that in addition to Fer there may be other mechanisms capable of compensating for the absence of Fes. For these reasons, we believe that both loss- and gain-of-function genetic approaches will be required to elucidate the biological functions and mechanism of action of Fes. The results presented in this paper suggest that Fes may play an important role in granulopoiesis. Our observation that C/EBP-α and STAT3 are activated by Fes during this process suggests a potential mechanism by which this kinase may contribute to the regulation of granulocyte-specific gene expression during myeloid development.

https://openalex.org/W2049229184,"Nuclear mitotic apparatus protein-retinoic acid receptor alpha (NuMA-RARalpha) is the fourth of five fusion proteins identified in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients. The molecular basis for its oncogenic activity has not been delineated. In gel-shift assays, NuMA-RARalpha bound to retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) both as a homodimer and as a heterodimer with RXRalpha. The binding profile of NuMA-RARalpha to a panel of RAREs was very similar to PML-RARalpha and PLZF-RARalpha. In transient transfection assays using HepG2 cells, NuMA-RARalpha inhibited wild-type RARalpha transcriptional activity, while it augmented STAT3 transcriptional activity. In GST-pull down experiments, NuMA-RARalpha formed a complex with the corepressor SMRT, was released from the NuMA-RARalpha/SMRT complexes by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) at 10(-7)-10(-6) M and became associated with the coactivator TRAM-1 at 10(-8) M ATRA. Studies comparing NuMA-RARalpha with NuMA-RARalpha(deltaCC) demonstrated that the dimerization or alpha-helical coiled-coil domain of NuMA was required for homodimer formation, transcriptional repression of wild-type RARalpha, transcriptional activation of STAT3, and stability of the NuMA-RARalpha/SMRT complex. Confocal fluorescent microscopy of HeLa cells was performed following transient expression of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-tagged proteins and incubation of cells with or without ATRA. Within the nucleus, CFP-NuMA-RARalpha exhibited a speckled pattern identical to that observed in cells transfected with CFP-NuMA. Furthermore, CFP-NuMA-RARalpha colocalized with yellow fluorescent protein-tagged (YFP)-NuMA. In contrast, CFP-NuMA-RARalpha(deltaCC) exhibited a diffuse granular pattern within the nucleus, similar to RARalpha. These results indicate that the dimerization domain of NuMA-RARalpha is critical for each of the known oncogenic activities of NuMA fusion proteins as well as its sequestration to nuclear sites normally occupied by NuMA and is distinct from RARalpha."
https://openalex.org/W2154745055,"Engagement of the B cell receptor antigen (BCR) triggers apoptosis on immature B cell lines. We report here that BCR triggering leads to caspase activation followed by Lyn cleavage and induction of apoptosis. The cleavage process is mitochondrion-dependent and involves caspases 9 and 7. Stable expression of the cleaved form of Lyn (Lyn-Delta-N) in Ramos B cells impairs BCR-mediated apoptosis as judged by loss of Delta(psi)m, caspase activation and PARP cleavage. Activation of the main survival pathways upon BCR-triggering was unaltered in both cell variants. However, the PI3-K inhibitor Ly294002 resensitizes Lyn-Delta-N cells to apoptosis. Selected cDNA expression arrays revealed that anti-IgM modulates the expression of approximately 20 genes in both cell variants. Among them, only c-Myc was found to be differentially regulated, which suggests a role for c-Myc in the B cell apoptotic response. Interestingly, c-Myc expression decreased more rapidly in Lyn-Delta-N compared with Lyn-WT cells during the first hours of anti-IgM stimulation. Nevertheless, rapid down-regulation of c-Myc following BCR engagement seems to correlate with the resistance of B cells to apoptosis. Thus, the soluble form of Lyn generated by caspases following BCR triggering acts as an inhibitor of B lymphocyte death likely through the modulation of c-Myc expression."
https://openalex.org/W1993687619,"The oncogene function in primary epithelial cells is largely unclear. Recombination organ cultures in combination with the stable and transient gene transfer techniques by retrovirus and electroporation, respectively, enable us to transfer oncogenes specifically into primary epithelial cells of the developing avian glandular stomach (proventriculus). In this system, the epithelium and mesenchyme are mutually dependent on each other for their growth and differentiation. We report here that either stable or transient expression of v-src in the epithelium causes budding and migration of epithelial cells into mesenchyme. In response to the transient expression of v-Src or a constitutive active mutant of MEK, we observed immediate downregulation of the Sonic hedgehog gene and subsequent elimination of E-cadherine expression in migrating cells, suggesting the involvement of MAP kinase signaling pathway in these processes. v-src-expressing cells that were retained in the epithelium underwent apoptosis (anoikis) and detached from the culture. Continuous expression of v-src by, for example, Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) was required for the epithelial cells to acquire the ability to express type I collagen and fibronectin genes (mesenchymal markers), and finally to establish the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These observations would partly explain why RSV does not apparently cause carcinoma formation, but induces sarcomas exclusively."

https://openalex.org/W2117752737,"Endothelial oxidative stress induces cellular activation and sometimes death. Endothelial death can occur via necrosis or apoptosis. Understanding the mechanisms involved in cellular activation and death may lead to therapeutics designed to increase death or preserve cellular function. In the present study, brief periods of anoxia (3 h) followed by varying lengths of reoxygenation (0-5 h) lead to a time-dependent increase in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) caspase activity. Furthermore, ROCK-1 cleavage, which is dependent on caspase-3 activity, was also increased in cells undergoing oxidative stress compared with normoxic cells. Microarray data demonstrated that glucosylceramide synthase (GCS; glucosylceramide transferase), but not acid sphingomyelinase, was modulated by anoxia and reoxygenation. We confirmed that GCS mRNA and protein expression were significantly decreased in a time-dependent fashion following oxidative stress by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively. Treatment of normoxic cells with the GCS-specific inhibitor, D,L-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP), increased caspase activity to the same degree as cells undergoing oxidative stress. Fumonisin B1, the N-acyl-sphinganine dehydrogenase (e.g., ceramide synthase) inhibitor significantly attenuated caspase activity in HUVECs undergoing oxidative stress. These data suggest that alterations in GCS expression following brief periods of oxidative stress in human endothelial cells lead to increased caspase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2160239902,"The chemokine RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) is expressed in several inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system and is a powerful stimulus for astrocyte production of proinflammatory mediators. The mechanism of RANTES-mediated astrocyte activation was investigated. RANTES stimulation decreased both intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) activity in cultures of primary mouse astrocytes. H-89, a potent inhibitor of PKA, mimicked RANTES-mediated chemokine and cytokine transcription. RANTES treatments activated Raf-1 kinase activity, and conversely a dominant negative Raf and a Raf-1 inhibitor blocked RANTES-induced chemokine transcription. Transfection with a constitutively active Raf was sufficient to induce transcription of proinflammatory mediators. The combined data indicate that Raf-1 is required for RANTES-mediated astrocyte activation. Decreases of cAMP and PKA activity contributed to the transcription of proinflammatory mediators by cross-talk with the Raf-1/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The results identify an upstream signaling pathway for amplification of proinflammatory mediators in the central nervous system."
