https://openalex.org/W4302425308,"High-entropy alloys are solid solutions of multiple principal elements that are capable of reaching composition and property regimes inaccessible for dilute materials. Discovering those with valuable properties, however, too often relies on serendipity, because thermodynamic alloy design rules alone often fail in high-dimensional composition spaces. We propose an active learning strategy to accelerate the design of high-entropy Invar alloys in a practically infinite compositional space based on very sparse data. Our approach works as a closed-loop, integrating machine learning with density-functional theory, thermodynamic calculations, and experiments. After processing and characterizing 17 new alloys out of millions of possible compositions, we identified two high-entropy Invar alloys with extremely low thermal expansion coefficients around 2 × 10 −6 per degree kelvin at 300 kelvin. We believe this to be a suitable pathway for the fast and automated discovery of high-entropy alloys with optimal thermal, magnetic, and electrical properties."
https://openalex.org/W4302362524,"Abstract Updated immunization strategies are needed to address multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants. Here we report interim results from an ongoing, open-label phase 2/3 trial evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of the bivalent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine candidate mRNA-1273.211, which contains equal mRNA amounts encoding the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and Beta variant spike proteins, as 50-µg ( n = 300) and 100-µg ( n = 595) first booster doses administered approximately 8.7–9.7 months after the mRNA-1273 primary vaccine series ( NCT04927065 ). The primary objectives were to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of mRNA-1273.211 and to demonstrate non-inferior antibody responses compared to the mRNA-1273 100-µg primary series. Additionally, a pre-specified immunogenicity objective was to demonstrate superior antibody responses compared to the previously authorized mRNA-1273 50-µg booster. The mRNA-1273.211 booster doses (50-µg or 100-µg) 28 days after immunization elicited higher neutralizing antibody responses against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and Beta variant than those elicited 28 days after the second mRNA‑1273 dose of the primary series ( NCT04470427 ). Antibody responses 28 days and 180 days after the 50-µg mRNA-1273.211 booster dose were also higher than those after a 50-µg mRNA-1273 booster dose ( NCT04405076 ) against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and Beta, Omicron BA.1 and Delta variants, and all pre-specified immunogenicity objectives were met. The safety and reactogenicity profile of the bivalent mRNA-1273.211 booster (50-µg) was similar to the booster dose of mRNA-1273 (50-µg). Immunization with the primary series does not set a ceiling to the neutralizing antibody response, and a booster dose of the bivalent vaccine elicits a robust response with titers that are likely to be protective against COVID-19. These results indicate that bivalent booster vaccines can induce potent, durable and broad antibody responses against multiple variants, providing a new tool in response to emerging variants."
https://openalex.org/W4302425405,"From tropical forests to gut microbiomes, ecological communities host notably high numbers of coexisting species. Beyond high biodiversity, communities exhibit a range of complex dynamics that are difficult to explain under a unified framework. Using bacterial microcosms, we performed a direct test of theory predicting that simple community-level features dictate emergent behaviors of communities. As either the number of species or the strength of interactions increases, we show that microbial ecosystems transition between three distinct dynamical phases, from a stable equilibrium in which all species coexist to partial coexistence to emergence of persistent fluctuations in species abundances, in the order predicted by theory. Under fixed conditions, high biodiversity and fluctuations reinforce each other. Our results demonstrate predictable emergent patterns of diversity and dynamics in ecological communities."

https://openalex.org/W4302425325,"The dormant state of bacterial spores is generally thought to be devoid of biological activity. We show that despite continued dormancy, spores can integrate environmental signals over time through a preexisting electrochemical potential. Specifically, we studied thousands of individual Bacillus subtilis spores that remain dormant when exposed to transient nutrient pulses. Guided by a mathematical model of bacterial electrophysiology, we modulated the decision to exit dormancy by genetically and chemically targeting potassium ion flux. We confirmed that short nutrient pulses result in step-like changes in the electrochemical potential of persistent spores. During dormancy, spores thus gradually release their stored electrochemical potential to integrate extracellular information over time. These findings reveal a decision-making mechanism that operates in physiologically inactive cells."
https://openalex.org/W4302425393,"RNA polymerase II-mediated eukaryotic transcription starts with the assembly of the preinitiation complex (PIC) on core promoters. The +1 nucleosome is well positioned about 40 base pairs downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) and is commonly known as a barrier of transcription. The +1 nucleosome-bound PIC-Mediator structures show that PIC-Mediator prefers binding to T40N nucleosome located 40 base pairs downstream of TSS and contacts T50N but not the T70N nucleosome. The nucleosome facilitates the organization of PIC-Mediator on the promoter by binding TFIIH subunit p52 and Mediator subunits MED19 and MED26 and may contribute to transcription initiation. PIC-Mediator exhibits multiple nucleosome-binding patterns, supporting a structural role of the +1 nucleosome in the coordination of PIC-Mediator assembly. Our study reveals the molecular mechanism of PIC-Mediator organization on chromatin and underscores the significance of the +1 nucleosome in regulating transcription initiation."
https://openalex.org/W4302008264,"The lifetime of proteins in synapses is important for their signaling, maintenance, and remodeling, and for memory duration. We quantified the lifetime of endogenous PSD95, an abundant postsynaptic protein in excitatory synapses, at single-synapse resolution across the mouse brain and lifespan, generating the Protein Lifetime Synaptome Atlas. Excitatory synapses have a wide range of PSD95 lifetimes extending from hours to several months, with distinct spatial distributions in dendrites, neurons, and brain regions. Synapses with short protein lifetimes are enriched in young animals and in brain regions controlling innate behaviors, whereas synapses with long protein lifetimes accumulate during development, are enriched in the cortex and CA1 where memories are stored, and are preferentially preserved in old age. Synapse protein lifetime increases throughout the brain in a mouse model of autism and schizophrenia. Protein lifetime adds a further layer to synapse diversity and enriches prevailing concepts in brain development, aging, and disease."
https://openalex.org/W4302425342,"Frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTD-ALS) are associated with both a repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene and mutations in the TANK-binding kinase 1 ( TBK1 ) gene. We found that TBK1 is phosphorylated in response to C9orf72 poly(Gly-Ala) [poly(GA)] aggregation and sequestered into inclusions, which leads to a loss of TBK1 activity and contributes to neurodegeneration. When we reduced TBK1 activity using a TBK1-R228H (Arg 228 →His) mutation in mice, poly(GA)-induced phenotypes were exacerbated. These phenotypes included an increase in TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology and the accumulation of defective endosomes in poly(GA)-positive neurons. Inhibiting the endosomal pathway induced TDP-43 aggregation, which highlights the importance of this pathway and TBK1 activity in pathogenesis. This interplay between C9orf72 , TBK1 , and TDP-43 connects three different facets of FTD-ALS into one coherent pathway."

https://openalex.org/W4302362722,"Current dogma asserts that the foetal liver (FL) is an expansion niche for recently specified haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) during ontogeny. Indeed, between embryonic day of development (E)12.5 and E14.5, the number of transplantable HSCs in the murine FL expands from 50 to about 1,000. Here we used a non-invasive, multi-colour lineage tracing strategy to interrogate the embryonic expansion of murine haematopoietic progenitors destined to contribute to the adult HSC pool. Our data show that this pool of fated progenitors expands only two-fold during FL ontogeny. Although Histone2B-GFP retention in vivo experiments confirmed substantial proliferation of phenotypic FL-HSC between E12.5 and E14.5, paired-daughter cell assays revealed that many mid-gestation phenotypic FL-HSCs are biased to differentiate, rather than self-renew, relative to phenotypic neonatal and adult bone marrow HSCs. In total, these data support a model in which the FL-HSC pool fated to contribute to adult blood expands only modestly during ontogeny."
https://openalex.org/W4302362773,"During cell migration and polarization, numerous signal transduction and cytoskeletal components self-organize to generate localized protrusions. Although biochemical and genetic analyses have delineated many specific interactions, how the activation and localization of so many different molecules are spatiotemporally orchestrated at the subcellular level has remained unclear. Here we show that the regulation of negative surface charge on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane plays an integrative role in the molecular interactions. Surface charge, or zeta potential, is transiently lowered at new protrusions and within cortical waves of Ras/PI3K/TORC2/F-actin network activation. Rapid alterations of inner leaflet anionic phospholipids—such as PI(4,5)P2, PI(3,4)P2, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic acid—collectively contribute to the surface charge changes. Abruptly reducing the surface charge by recruiting positively charged optogenetic actuators was sufficient to trigger the entire biochemical network, initiate de novo protrusions and abrogate pre-existing polarity. These effects were blocked by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of key signalling components such as AKT and PI3K/TORC2. Conversely, increasing the negative surface charge deactivated the network and locally suppressed chemoattractant-induced protrusions or subverted EGF-induced ERK activation. Computational simulations involving excitable biochemical networks demonstrated that slight changes in feedback loops, induced by recruitment of the charged actuators, could lead to outsized effects on system activation. We propose that key signalling network components act on, and are in turn acted upon, by surface charge, closing feedback loops, which bring about the global-scale molecular self-organization required for spontaneous protrusion formation, cell migration and polarity establishment. Banerjee et al. detail the spatial and temporal dynamics of the surface charge on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and show that these dynamics are necessary and sufficient to regulate signalling pathways mediating cell migration and polarity."

https://openalex.org/W4302425337,"Establishing causal links between inherited polymorphisms and cancer risk is challenging. Here, we focus on the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs55705857, which confers a sixfold greater risk of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant low-grade glioma (LGG). We reveal that rs55705857 itself is the causal variant and is associated with molecular pathways that drive LGG. Mechanistically, we show that rs55705857 resides within a brain-specific enhancer, where the risk allele disrupts OCT2/4 binding, allowing increased interaction with the Myc promoter and increased Myc expression. Mutating the orthologous mouse rs55705857 locus accelerated tumor development in an Idh1R132H-driven LGG mouse model from 472 to 172 days and increased penetrance from 30% to 75%. Our work reveals mechanisms of the heritable predisposition to lethal glioma in ~40% of LGG patients."
https://openalex.org/W4300717212,"The nucleocapsid (N) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is responsible for compaction of the ∼30-kb RNA genome in the ∼90-nm virion. Previous studies suggest that each virion contains 35 to 40 viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes, or ribonucleosomes, arrayed along the genome. There is, however, little mechanistic understanding of the vRNP complex. Here, we show that N protein, when combined in vitro with short fragments of the viral genome, forms 15-nm particles similar to the vRNP structures observed within virions. These vRNPs depend on regions of N protein that promote protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions. Phosphorylation of N protein in its disordered serine/arginine region weakens these interactions to generate less compact vRNPs. We propose that unmodified N protein binds structurally diverse regions in genomic RNA to form compact vRNPs within the nucleocapsid, while phosphorylation alters vRNP structure to support other N protein functions in viral transcription."
https://openalex.org/W4302007691,"Social isolation during opioid withdrawal is a major contributor to the current opioid addiction crisis. We find that sociability deficits during protracted opioid withdrawal in mice require activation of kappa opioid receptors (KORs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) medial shell. Blockade of release from dynorphin (Pdyn)-expressing dorsal raphe neurons (DRPdyn), but not from NAcPdyn neurons, prevents these deficits in prosocial behaviors. Conversely, optogenetic activation of DRPdyn neurons reproduced NAc KOR-dependent decreases in sociability. Deletion of KORs from serotonin (5-HT) neurons, but not from NAc neurons or dopamine (DA) neurons, prevented sociability deficits during withdrawal. Finally, measurements with the genetically encoded GRAB5-HT sensor revealed that during withdrawal KORs block the NAc 5-HT release that normally occurs during social interactions. These results define a neuromodulatory mechanism that is engaged during protracted opioid withdrawal to induce maladaptive deficits in prosocial behaviors, which in humans contribute to relapse."
https://openalex.org/W4302362901,"The ring-like cohesin complex mediates sister-chromatid cohesion by encircling pairs of sister chromatids. Cohesin also extrudes loops along chromatids. Whether the two activities involve similar mechanisms of DNA engagement is not known. We implemented an experimental approach based on isolated nuclei carrying engineered cleavable RAD21 proteins to precisely control cohesin ring integrity so that its role in chromatin looping could be studied under defined experimental conditions. This approach allowed us to identify cohesin complexes with distinct biochemical, and possibly structural, properties that mediate different sets of chromatin loops. When RAD21 is cleaved and the cohesin ring is opened, cohesin complexes at CTCF sites are released from DNA and loops at these elements are lost. In contrast, cohesin-dependent loops within chromatin domains that are not anchored at pairs of CTCF sites are more resistant to RAD21 cleavage. The results show that the cohesin complex mediates loops in different ways depending on the genomic context and suggests that it undergoes structural changes as it dynamically extrudes and encounters CTCF sites."
https://openalex.org/W4302362699,"Abstract The biological purpose of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is poorly understood. Haploinsufficient mutations in HNF1A homeobox A ( HNF1A ), encoding a homeodomain transcription factor, cause diabetes mellitus. Here, we examine HASTER , the promoter of an lncRNA antisense to HNF1A . Using mouse and human models, we show that HASTER maintains cell-specific physiological HNF1A concentrations through positive and negative feedback loops. Pancreatic β cells from Haster mutant mice consequently showed variegated HNF1A silencing or overexpression, resulting in hyperglycaemia. HASTER -dependent negative feedback was essential to prevent HNF1A binding to inappropriate genomic regions. We demonstrate that the HASTER promoter DNA, rather than the lncRNA, modulates HNF1A promoter–enhancer interactions in cis and thereby regulates HNF1A transcription. Our studies expose a cis -regulatory element that is unlike classic enhancers or silencers, it stabilizes the transcription of its target gene and ensures the fidelity of a cell-specific transcription factor program. They also show that disruption of a mammalian lncRNA promoter can cause diabetes mellitus."

https://openalex.org/W4302363688,"Virtual reality (VR) has seen increasing application in cognitive psychology in recent years. There is some debate about the impact of VR on both learning outcomes and on patterns of information access behaviors. In this study we compare performance on a category learning task between three groups: one presented with three-dimensional (3D) stimuli while immersed in the HTC Vive VR system (n = 26), another presented with the same 3D stimuli while using a flat-screen desktop computer (n = 26), and a third presented with a two-dimensional projection of the stimuli on a desktop computer while their eye movements were tracked (n = 8). In the VR and 3D conditions, features of the object to be categorized had to be revealed by rotating the object. In the eye tracking control condition (2D), all object features were visible, and participants’ gaze was tracked as they examined each feature. Over 240 trials we measured accuracy, reaction times, attentional optimization, time spent on feedback, fixation durations, and fixation counts for each participant as they learned to correctly categorize the stimuli. In the VR condition, participants had increased fixation counts compared to the 3D and 2D conditions. Reaction times for the 2D condition were significantly faster and fixation durations were lower compared to the VR and 3D conditions. We found no significant differences in learning accuracy between the VR, 3D, and 2D conditions. We discuss implications for both researchers interested in using VR to study cognition, and VR developers hoping to use non-VR research to guide their designs and applications."

https://openalex.org/W4302362726,"Abstract The tumor microenvironment (TME) represents a milieu enabling cancer cells to develop malignant properties, while concerted interactions between cancer and stromal cells frequently shape an “activated/reprogramed” niche to accelerate pathological progression. Here we report that a soluble factor epiregulin (EREG) is produced by senescent stromal cells, which non-cell-autonomously develop the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) upon DNA damage. Genotoxicity triggers EREG expression by engaging NF-κB and C/EBP, a process supported by elevated chromatin accessibility and increased histone acetylation. Stromal EREG reprograms the expression profile of recipient neoplastic cells in a paracrine manner, causing upregulation of MARCHF4, a membrane-bound E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in malignant progression, specifically drug resistance. A combinational strategy that empowers EREG-specific targeting in treatment-damaged TME significantly promotes cancer therapeutic efficacy in preclinical trials, achieving response indices superior to those of solely targeting cancer cells. In clinical oncology, EREG is expressed in tumor stroma and handily measurable in circulating blood of cancer patients post-chemotherapy. This study establishes EREG as both a targetable SASP factor and a new noninvasive biomarker of treatment-damaged TME, thus disclosing its substantial value in translational medicine."
https://openalex.org/W4302363560,"The mitochondrion of malaria parasites is an attractive antimalarial drug target, which require mitoribosomes to translate genes encoded in the mitochondrial (mt) DNA. Plasmodium mitoribosomes are composed of highly fragmented ribosomal RNA (rRNA) encoded in the mtDNA. All mitoribosomal proteins (MRPs) and other assembly factors are encoded in the nuclear genome. Here, we have studied one putative assembly factor, RSM22 (Pf3D7_1027200) and one large subunit (LSU) MRP, L23 (Pf3D7_1239100) in Plasmodium falciparum. We show that both proteins localize to the mitochondrion. Conditional knock down (KD) of PfRSM22 or PfMRPL23 leads to reduced cytochrome bc1 complex activity and increased sensitivity to bc1 inhibitors such as atovaquone and ELQ-300. Using RNA sequencing as a tool, we reveal the transcriptomic changes of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes upon KD of these two proteins. In the early phase of KD, while most mt rRNAs and transcripts of putative MRPs were downregulated in the absence of PfRSM22, many mt rRNAs and several MRPs were upregulated after KD of PfMRPL23. The contrast effects in the early phase of KD likely suggests non-redundant roles of PfRSM22 and PfMRPL23 in the assembly of P. falciparum mitoribosomes. At the late time points of KD, loss of PfRSM22 and PfMRPL23 caused defects in many essential metabolic pathways and transcripts related to essential mitochondrial functions, leading to parasite death. In addition, we enlist mitochondrial proteins of unknown function that are likely novel Plasmodium MRPs based on their structural similarity to known MRPs as well as their expression profiles in KD parasites."
https://openalex.org/W4302363570,"Human cells tightly control their dimensions, but in some cancers, normal cell size control is lost. In this study we measure cell volumes of epithelial cells from human lung adenocarcinoma progression in situ. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), we reconstruct tumor cell shapes in three dimensions (3D) and find airway type 2 cells display up to 10-fold increases in volume. Surprisingly, cell size increase is not caused by altered ploidy, and up to 80% of near-euploid tumor cells show abnormal sizes. Size dysregulation is not explained by cell swelling or senescence because cells maintain cytoplasmic density and proper organelle size scaling, but is correlated with changes in tissue organization and loss of a novel network of processes that appear to connect alveolar type 2 cells. To validate size dysregulation in near-euploid cells, we sorted cells from tumor single-cell suspensions on the basis of size. Our study provides data of unprecedented detail for cell volume dysregulation in a human cancer. Broadly, loss of size control may be a common feature of lung adenocarcinomas in humans and mice that is relevant to disease and identification of these cells provides a useful model for investigating cell size control and consequences of cell size dysregulation."
https://openalex.org/W4302763034,"Childhood obesity is an increasing public health problem. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between maternal body mass index in early pregnancy and body mass index in children up to the age of 16 years, and to estimate the prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity in a rural municipality in Sweden.The study population comprised 312 pregnant women who attended the antenatal clinics in Lidköping during the year 1999 and their 319 children. Data on body mass index from antenatal clinics, child health care centres and school health care were used in linear and multinomial logistic regressions adjusted for maternal age, smoking status, and parity.Overweight or obesity were found in 23.0% of 16-year-olds. The correlation between maternal and child body mass index at all studied ages was positive and significant. Body mass index in 16-year-old boys showed the strongest correlation with maternal body mass index (adjusted r-square = 0.31). The adjusted relative-risk ratio for 16-year old children to be classified as obese as compared to normal weight, per 1 unit increase in maternal body mass index was 1.46 (95% confidence interval 1.29-1.65, p<0.001). Among adolescents with obesity, 37.6% had been overweight or obese at 4 years of age.This study confirms the correlation between maternal and child body mass index and that obesity can be established early in childhood. Further, we showed a high prevalence of overweight and obesity in children, especially in boys, in a Swedish rural municipality. This suggests a need for early intervention in the preventive work of childhood obesity, preferably starting at the antenatal clinic and in child health care centres."
https://openalex.org/W4303414931,"Chronic inflammation, which is dominated by macrophage-involved inflammatory responses, is an instigator of cancer initiation. Macrophages are the most abundant immune cells in healthy lungs, and associated with lung tumor development and promotion. PD-L1 is a negative molecule in macrophages and correlated with an immunosuppressive function in tumor environment. Macrophages expressing PD-L1, rather than tumor cells, exhibits a critical role in tumor growth and progression. However, whether and how PD-L1 in macrophages contributes to inflammation-induced lung tumorigenesis requires further elucidation. Here, we found that higher expression of PD-L1 in CD11b+ CD206+ macrophages was positively correlated with tumor progression and PD-1+ CD8+ T cells population in human adenocarcinoma patients. In the urethane-induced inflammation-driven lung adenocarcinoma (IDLA) mouse model, the infiltration of circulating CD11bhigh F4/80+ monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMs) was increased in pro-tumor inflamed lung tissues and lung adenocarcinoma. PD-L1 was mainly upregulated in MoMs associated with enhanced T cells exhaustion in lung tissues. Anti-PD-L1 treatment can reduce T cells exhaustion at pro-tumor inflammatory stage, and then inhibit tumorigenesis in IDLA. The pro-tumor lung inflammation depended on TNF-α to upregulate PD-L1 and CSN6 expression in MoMs, and induced cytokines production by alveolar type-II cells (AT-II). Furthermore, inflammatory AT-II cells could secret TNF-α to upregulate PD-L1 expression in bone-marrow driven macrophages (BM-M0). Inhibition of CSN6 decreased PD-L1 expression in TNF-α-activated macrophage in vitro, suggesting a critical role of CSN6 in PD-L1 upregulation. Thus, pro-tumor inflammation can depend on TNF-α to upregulate PD-L1 in recruited MoMs, which may be essential for lung tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4303453992,"Objective/aim The aim of the study was to quantify excess mortality in children after admission to a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), compared to the age and sex matched general Swedish population. Design Single-center, retrospective cohort study. Setting Registry study of hospital registers, a national population register and Statistics Sweden. Patients Children admitted to a tertiary PICU in Sweden in 2008–2016. Interventions None. Main results In total, 6,487 admissions (4,682 patients) were included in the study. During the study period 444 patients died. Median follow-up time for the entire PICU cohort was 7.2 years (IQR 5.0–9.9 years). Patients were divided into four different age groups (0–28 d, &gt; 28 d -1 yr, &gt; 1–4 yr, and &gt; 4 yr) and four different risk stratification groups [Predicted Death Rate (PDR) intervals: 0–10%, &gt; 10–25%, &gt; 25–50%, and &gt; 50%] at admission. Readmission was seen in 929 (19.8%) patients. The Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs) were calculated using the matched Swedish population as a reference group. The SMR for the entire study group was 49.8 (95% CI: 44.8–55.4). For patients with repeated PICU admissions SMR was 108.0 (95% CI: 91.9–126.9), and after four years 33.9 (95% CI: 23.9–48.0). Patients with a single admission had a SMR of 35.2 (95% CI: 30.5–40.6), and after four years 11.0 (95% CI: 7.0–17.6). The highest SMRs were seen in readmitted children with oncology/hematology (SMR = 358) and neurologic (SMR = 192) diagnosis. Children aged &gt;1–4 years showed the highest SMR (325). In PDR group 0–10% children with repeated PICU admissions (n = 798), had a SMR of 100. Conclusion Compared to the matched Swedish population, SMRs were greatly elevated up to four years after PICU admission, declining from over 100 to 33 for patients with repeated PICU admissions, and from 35 to 11 for patients with a single PICU admission."
https://openalex.org/W4302363547,"The diversity found in the chemical compounds of a single species in different regions results in different biologic characteristics which can be considered as a strong source for identifying new chemotypes. Hymenocrater incanus Bunge and Dracocephalum kotschyi Boiss. are exclusive species of the Lamiaceae family which grow in the western and central habitats of Iran. This study was designed and carried out to determine the yield, identify the chemical compounds, and evaluate the antimicrobial characteristics of the essential oil (EO) of these two species in Iran for the first time.The flowering twigs of the species D. kotschyi and H. incanus were collected from the villages of Totmach and Kamu in Isfahan province respectively, in May 2019. The EO of these plants was extracted and separated using the water distillation method, utilizing the Clevenger device. The EO compounds were analyzed using a gas chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The evaluation of antimicrobial characteristics was carried out by determining the growth inhibition zone implementing the Agar method, the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC), and the minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration (MFC/MBC) utilizing liquid dilution culture.The results indicated that the highest yield belonged to the EO of D. kotschyi at %2.6 (w/w). In this EO there were citral (%25.44), neral (%20.87), α-pinene (%14.48), trans-geranic acid methyl ester (%9.74), and D-limonene (%6.87). Moreover, H. incanus had the dominant compounds (-)-Spathulenol (%12.61), caryophyllene (%10.00), linolenic acid (%8.54), 1,8-cineole (%5.95), palmitic acid (%5.35), and α-cadinol (%5.17). The largest diameter of growth inhibition zone belonged to the H. incanus EO against the Gram-positive bacteria S. pyogenes (~17.67mm). The strongest inhibition activities in the form of growth inhibition diameter exhibited by the D. kotschyi EO were against the Gram-negative bacteria S. paratyphi-A serotype (~ 12 mm), K. pneumoniae, and Sh. dysenteriae (~ 11 mm) which was significant compared to the Gram-positive rifampin (~ 8 mm).It can be seen that these species are new chemotypes with special and novel chemical compounds which can potentially be used to manufacture natural antibiotics against some bacterial strains."
https://openalex.org/W4302363561,"Objective The risk of retinal detachment (RD) following exposure to fluoroquinolone (FQ) has been assessed in multiple studies, however, results have been mixed. This study was designed to estimate the risk of RD following exposure to FQ, other common antibiotics, and febrile illness not treated with antibiotics (FINTA) using a self-controlled case series (SCCS) study design to reduce risk of confounding from unreported patient characteristics. Design Retrospective database analysis–SCCS. Setting Primary and Secondary Care. Study population 40,981 patients across 3 US claims databases (IBM® MarketScan® commercial and Medicare databases, Optum Clinformatics). Outcome RD. Methods Exposures included FQ as a class of drugs, amoxicillin, azithromycin, trimethoprim with and without sulfamethoxazole, and FINTA. For the primary analysis, all drug formulations were included. For the post hoc sensitivity analyses, only oral tablets were included. Risk windows were defined as exposure period (or FINTA duration) plus 30 days. Patients of all ages with RD and exposures in 3 US claims databases between 2012 to 2017 were included. Diagnostics included p value calibration and pre-exposure outcome analyses. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) comparing risk window time with other time were calculated. Results Our primary analysis showed an increased risk for RD in the 30 days prior to exposure to FQ or trimethoprim without sulfamethoxazole. This risk decreased but remained elevated for 30 days following first exposure. Our post-hoc analysis, which excluded ophthalmic drops, showed no increased risk for RD at any time, with FQ and other antibiotics. Conclusion Our results did not suggest an association between FQ and RD. Oral FQ was not associated with an increased risk for RD during the pre- or post-exposure period.

Ideally, the public should be educated to perform methods of optimal health and wellbeing independently, meaning that individuals should be in control of their health without relying on others. As behavior is known to be consistent over time, good or poor health behavior will track from childhood into adulthood. Physical activity and diet are permanently linked to the individual's state of health, and when properly balanced, the effects on personal health summate, resulting in greater benefits from this dual-approach for public health. The objective is to highlight the different approaches (physical intervention, nutritional intervention, and dual-approach of diet and exercise) and identify effective interventions for sustainable body weight and healthy body mass index in school children. A systematic review will be conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The review will assess school-based diet and exercise interventions on children in primary and secondary school levels I and II. Overweight and obesity develop as a result of a prolonged imbalance in the energy balance model, with both physical activity and diet being influential in the fluctuation of body weight. A dual-approach including physical activity and diet could therefore be a very promising method to promote sustainable healthy body weight in school children."
https://openalex.org/W4302761458,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused a major economic downturn that disproportionally affected university students. This empirical research investigated effects and risk factors of the pandemic on students' economic situation with focus on financial distress and financial limitations. Data was collected using an online survey in May and June 2020 from students (n = 917) enrolled at universities in Germany. 80.6% were enrolled in bachelor programs (n = 738), the mean semester was 3.8 (standard deviation (SD = 2.0) and students' mean age was 23.1 years (SD = 4.1). 51.8% (n = 472) were female and 47.4% (n = 432) male. 56.7% (n = 506) of students worked before the pandemic. More than one third reported a decrease in income (36.5%; n = 334) and an increase in financial constraints (38.7%; n = 354). A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that students with regular income were less likely to experience financial distress compared to those without (odds ratio (OR) = 0.456; p = 0.014). Furthermore, working part-time as associated with a higher financial distress compared to those without part-time employment (OR = 1.811; p = 0.003). Students who worked part-time before the pandemic also had a higher probability of increased financial restriction (or constraint) compared to those who did not work part-time (OR = 2.094; p < 0.001). University students were disproportionally affected by the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, which increased students' economic uncertainty. To offset such problems, financial aid schemes for students need to be made available to alleviate distress and to allow students to focus on their studies but should not compound problems by leading to financial hardship at a later point in time."

Among anemic HIV patients in Africa, the burden of IHA due to autoantibody was ranged from 2.34 to 3.06 due to drug was 43.4%. IHA due to autoimmune is potentially a fatal complication of HIV which accompanies the greatest percent from acquired hemolytic anemia.The main aim of this study was to determine the magnitude and associated factors of immune hemolytic anemia among human immuno deficiency virus infected adults at university of Gondar comprehensive specialized hospital north west Ethiopia from March to April 2021.An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 358 human immunodeficiency virus-infected adults selected by systematic random sampling at the University of Gondar comprehensive specialized hospital from March to April 2021. Data for socio-demography, dietary and clinical data were collected by structured pretested questionnaire. Five ml of venous blood was drawn from each participant and analyzed by Unicel DHX 800 hematology analyzer, blood film examination and antihuman globulin test were performed to diagnosis of immune hemolytic anemia. Data was entered into Epidata version 4.6 and analyzed by STATA version 14. Descriptive statistics were computed and firth penalized logistic regression was used to identify predictors. P value less than 0.005 interpreted as significant.The overall prevalence of immune hemolytic anemia was 2.8% (10 of 358 participants). Of these 5 were males and 7 were in the 31 to 50 year age group. Among individuals with immune hemolytic anemia, 40% mild and 60% moderate anemia. The factors that showed association were family history of anemia (AOR 8.30 at 95% CI 1.56, 44.12), not eating meat (AOR 7.39 at 95% CI 1.25, 45.0), and high viral load 6.94 at 95% CI (1.13, 42.6).Immune hemolytic anemia is less frequent condition in human immunodeficiency virus infected adults, and moderate anemia was common in this population. The prevalence was increased with a high viral load, a family history of anemia, and not eating meat. In these patients, early detection and treatment of immune hemolytic anemia is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W4302762886,"Thymidine Kinase 1 (TK1) plays an important role in DNA precursor synthesis and serum TK1 activity has been used as a biomarker for prognosis and therapy monitoring of different malignancies. AroCell has developed a dual monoclonal antibody ELISA for determination of TK1 protein in clinical samples. The purpose of the study is to validate the ELISA analytically in relation to the gold standard, [3H]-deoxythymidine (dThd) phosphorylation assay for TK1 activity using sera from patients with different malignancies. The colorimetric TK 210 ELISA was validated analytically by assessment of precision, linearity, interfering substances, and stability. For the clinical validation, serum samples from patients with hematological malignancies (n = 100), breast cancer (n = 56), prostate cancer (n = 70) and blood donors (n = 159) were analyzed using TK 210 ELISA and TK1 activity by [3H]-deoxythymidine (dThd) phosphorylation assay. The sandwich TK 210 ELISA was highly specific for TK1 protein having a detection limit of 0.12 ng/mL, with a functional sensitivity of 0.25 ng/mL. Within-run CVs ranged from 5.5% to 10% and between-run CVs ranged from 5% to 15%. The ratio of observed to expected dilutional parallelism of 5 serum samples was in the range of 80-120%. Samples exhibited stability through four freeze/thaw cycles and 5 days at 4°C. Further, the ROC curve analysis showed that TK 210 ELISA and [3H]-dThd phosphorylation assay had similar sensitivity (62% vs 59%) in hematological malignancies. However, in the case of breast and prostate cancer sera, TK 210 ELISA had higher sensitivity (59% and 44%) compared to [3H]-dThd phosphorylation assay (47% and 25%) at a specificity of 98%. These data demonstrate that the dual monoclonal antibody based AroCell TK 210 ELISA is a robust, accurate and precise tool for measuring TK1 protein in different malignancies that can improve the clinical applications of TK1 as a biomarker in cancer management."

The main aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of LAMP assay for detecting pre-clinical malaria, when microscopy and mRDT were less sensitive. DNA was obtained from 100 μL of whole blood using the boil and spin method. Subsequently, the Plasmodium 18s rRNA LAMP assay was performed to amplify the specific Plasmodium 18s rRNA gene. Microscopy and mRDT negative samples [697/2223 (31.2%)] were used for this study. Compared to frequencies obtained for the other demographic variables, most of the patients were < 6 years (37.7%), females (59.0%), peri-urban dwellers (39.0%) and patients that sought outpatient department services (39.3%). Overall, the prevalence of Plasmodium 18s rRNA was 17.5%. when stratified by study variables, Plasmodium 18s rRNA LAMP positivity was higher in patients over 30 years [58/122 (54.2%)], males [69/122 (56.5%)], rural dwellers [69/122 (56.5%)] and patients that sought OPD services [68/122 (55.7%)]. The risk of being infected with Plasmodium when routine tests were negative was higher in 15-30-year group (OR = 3.03, 95% CI: 1.6-5.8, p = 0.0007), patients > 30 years (OR = 15.2, 95% CI: 8.3-27.7, p<0.001), males (OR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.4-3.2, p = 0.0002) and rural dwellers (OR = 2.2, 95% CI:1.4-3.6, p = 0.0009). However, risk was lower in post-natal children (OR = 0.3, 95% CI: 0.18-0.51, p<0.001). Majority (81.5%) of the infected patients presented with headache, herpes labialis, diarrhea and vomiting. We demonstrated the lack of sensitivities of microscopy and mRDT for one-time diagnosis of malaria. Therefore, it is essential to utilize a sensitive technique such as Plasmodium 18s rRNA LAMP to increase the detection rate of Plasmodium infection."

https://openalex.org/W4302363565,"Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) reflects tumor burden and is a prognosticator of all-cause mortality in patients with cancer. Objective measures of physical function are associated with clinically relevant outcomes in older adults with cancer. However, whether physical function is associated with LDH in geriatric oncology is unknown. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between objective measures of physical function and serum LDH in older adults with cancer prior to treatment.Data from older adults with cancer prior to treatment were retrieved from an institutional database and medical records within a tertiary cancer centre. Physical function measures involved muscle strength and physical performance. Muscle strength and physical performance were assessed through grip strength and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), respectively. LDH was log transformed using the natural logarithm. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between objective measures of physical function and LDH prior to treatment in all participants. Stratified analyses were performed for participants with solid and hematological cancers.A total of 257 participants (mean age: 80.2y) were included in the analysis. Most participants were females (50.6%) and were diagnosed with locally advanced (26.8%), gastrointestinal disease (35.0%). The multivariable analysis indicated that SPPB was inversely associated with LDH in all participants (B = -0.019, 95%CI = -0.036 to -0.002, p = 0.028). Notably, the inverse relationship between SPPB and LDH persisted only in patients with hematological malignancies in the multivariable model of the stratified analysis (B = -0.049, 95%CI = -0.087 to -0.011, p = 0.013). Neither grip strength alone nor the combination of low grip strength and/or SPPB were associated with LDH. Compared to participants with metastatic disease, those with localized or locally advanced disease had lower serum LDH.Physical performance is inversely associated with serum LDH in older adults with hematological cancers prior to treatment."

https://openalex.org/W4302742584,"Plasmodium falciparum is a parasitic protozoan that can cause malaria, which is a deadly disease. Therefore, the accurate identification of malaria parasite mitochondrial proteins is essential for understanding their functions and identifying novel drug targets. For classifying protein sequences, several adaptive statistical techniques have been devised. Despite significant gains, prediction performance is still constrained by the lack of appropriate feature descriptors and learning strategies in current systems. Moreover, good ground truth data is important for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based models but there is a lack of that data in the literature. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel hybrid network that combines 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BGRU) to classify the malaria parasite mitochondrial proteins. Furthermore, we curate a sequential data that are collected from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot proteins databanks to prepare a dataset that can be used by the research community for AI-based algorithms evaluation. We obtain 4204 cases after preprocessing of the collected data and denote this set of proteins as PF4204. Finally, we conduct an ablation study on several conventional and deep models using PF4204 and the benchmark PF2095 datasets. The proposed model ‘CNN-BGRU’ obtains the accuracy values of 0.9096 and 0.9857 on PF4204 and PF2095 datasets, respectively. In addition, the CNN-BGRU is compared with state-of-the-arts, where the results illustrate that it can extract robust features and identify proteins accurately."
https://openalex.org/W4302742624,"In small and large spinal dorsal root ganglion neurons, subtypes of voltage-gated sodium channels, such as Na V 1.7, Na V 1.8, and Na V 1.9 are expressed with characteristically localized and may play different roles in pain transmission and intractable pain development. Selective stimulation of each specific subtype in vivo may elucidate its role of each subtype in pain. So far, this has been difficult with current technology. However, Optogenetics, a recently developed technique, has enabled selective activation or inhibition of specific neural circulation in vivo . Moreover, optogenetics had even been used to selectively excite Na V 1.8-expressing dorsal root ganglion neurons to induce nocifensive behavior. In recent years, genetic modification technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 have advanced, and various knock-in mice can be easily generated using such technology. We aimed to investigate the effects of selective optogenetic activation of Na V 1.7-expressing afferents on mouse behavior. We used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination to generate bicistronic Na V 1.7–iCre knock-in mice, which express iCre recombinase under the endogenous Na V 1.7 gene promoter without disrupting Na V 1.7. The Cre-driver mice were crossed with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) Cre-reporter Ai32 mice to obtain Na V 1.7 iCre/+ ;Ai32/+, Na V 1.7 iCre/iCre ;Ai32/+, Na V 1.7 iCre/+ ;Ai32/Ai32, and Na V 1.7 iCre/iCre ;Ai32/Ai32 mice. Compared with wild–type mice behavior, no differences were observed in the behaviors associated with mechanical and thermal stimuli exhibited by mice of the aforementioned genotypes, indicating that the endogenous Na V 1.7 gene was not affected by the targeted insertion of iCre. Blue light irradiation to the hind paw induced paw withdrawal by mice of all genotypes in a light power-dependent manner. The threshold and incidence of paw withdrawal and aversive behavior in a blue-lit room were dependent on ChR2 expression level; the strongest response was observed in Na V 1.7 iCre/iCre ;Ai32/Ai32 mice. Thus, we developed a non-invasive pain model in which peripheral nociceptors were optically activated in free-moving transgenic Na V 1.7–ChR2 mice."
https://openalex.org/W4302760612,"The growth of the noxious grassland weed Jacobaea vulgaris Gaertn. in pastures is a threat to grazing animals. This is especially true when it dominates vegetation cover, which often occurs on non-intensively used pastures that are managed for nature-conservation, to maintain and promote biodiversity. Thus, we wanted to find management techniques to reduce J. vulgaris without harming the floral biodiversity on the pastures. We tested six different mechanical and cultural methods to reduce the presence and spread of J. vulgaris. Seven study sites in Northern Germany (Schleswig-Holstein) were treated with tilling and seeding (1), tilling and hay transfer (2), mowing twice within bloom (3), mowing before seed set and combinations of mowing and seeding with a slit drill (5) or by hand (6). Our results show that cutting within the bloom of the plant at the end of June and again four weeks later, when the plant is in its second bloom was the only treatment leading to a significant reduction in population growth rate without reducing surrounding plant species richness. The study reveals that management of J. vulgaris in non-intensively used pastures is possible, while preserving species-rich grasslands."

Relative HGS was defined as the absolute HGS divided by body mass index and divided into quartiles in men and women. Odds ratios (OR) for diabetes and IFG were calculated using multivariate logistic regression analysis. All analyses were stratified by sex, and subgroup analysis was age-stratified.The lowest relative HGS quartile had a significant increase in the risk for diabetes (men: OR 2.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.12-3.50; women: OR 3.38, 95% CI 2.70-4.24) and IFG (men: OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.15-1.59; women: OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.40-1.84). The ORs for diabetes and IFG according to the decreasing quartiles of relative HGS gradually increased in both sexes (P for trend <0.001). ORs and 95% CI of the lowest relative HGS quartile for diabetes were higher in the younger age group than that of the older age group (men: 4.47 and 2.80-7.14 for young adults; 2.41 and 1.37-4.25 for older adults; women: 5.91 and 3.06-9.38 for young adults; 1.47 and 0.92-2.33 for older adults).

In this study, we aimed to test whether individuals with higher numerical, scientific, and economic literacy were more polarized in their perception of immigration, depending on their cultural worldview orientation. We measured these variables in a representative sample of citizens in a medium-sized city in northern Italy. We found evidence that numerical, scientific, and economic literacy polarize concerns about immigration aligning them to people's worldview orientations. Individuals with higher numerical, economic, and scientific literacy were less concerned about immigration if they held an egalitarian-communitarian worldview, while they were more concerned about immigration if they held a hierarchical-individualistic worldview. On the contrary, individuals with less numerical, economic, and scientific literacy did not show a polarized perception of immigration. Results reveal that citizens with higher knowledge and ability presented a more polarized perception of immigration. Conclusions highlight the central role of cultural worldviews over information theories in shaping concerns about immigration."
https://openalex.org/W4303453804,"As global child vaccination coverage has plateaued, understanding how to increase routine child vaccination rates further is key to avoiding preventable disease and death. To analyse how community engagement strategies can increase child vaccination, we synthesise the results from formative evaluations of interventions that aimed to increase vaccination coverage in Ethiopia, Myanmar, Nigeria, and Pakistan.This paper uses an inductive qualitative approach to synthesise the results from the six evaluations, gathering lessons for designing context appropriate interventions that are feasible to implement and acceptable to providers, communities, and caregivers.Assessing contextual, caregiver-level and provider-level barriers to vaccination is key to identifying appropriate engagement strategies. Across all contexts, low knowledge about the schedule of vaccines and the importance of timeliness represented a barrier to child immunisation. Despite the variability in how studies measured and reported caregiver attitudes, vaccine hesitancy was not found to represent an important barrier to immunisation. Frontline health workers played a critical role in community engagement approaches to increase vaccination. Interventions successfully obtained community buy-in by centre-staging community members, especially leaders, ensuring their participation in monitoring, and making immunisation an agenda item on community platforms. Interventions were implemented through existing health systems with substantial assistance from research teams. Limited data was available about intervention costs.Interventions designed around community engagement strategies can be appropriate, acceptable, and feasible approaches to overcome barriers to vaccination in a variety of low- and middle-income country contexts. However, questions remain about the ability of health systems to implement interventions at scale, both from a cost perspective and a capacity perspective."
