https://openalex.org/W1988253322,"Gaucher disease is a progressive lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of glucocerebrosidase leading to the dysfunction in multiple organ systems. Intravenous enzyme replacement is the accepted standard of treatment. In the current report, we evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of a novel human recombinant glucocerebrosidase enzyme expressed in transformed plant cells (prGCD), administered to primates and human subjects. Short term (28 days) and long term (9 months) repeated injections with a standard dose of 60 Units/kg and a high dose of 300 Units/kg were administered to monkeys (n = 4/sex/dose). Neither clinical drug-related adverse effects nor neutralizing antibodies were detected in the animals. In a phase I clinical trial, six healthy volunteers were treated by intravenous infusions with escalating single doses of prGCD. Doses of up to 60 Units/kg were administered at weekly intervals. prGCD infusions were very well tolerated. Anti-prGCD antibodies were not detected. The pharmacokinetic profile of the prGCD revealed a prolonged half-life compared to imiglucerase, the commercial enzyme that is manufactured in a costly mammalian cell system. These studies demonstrate the safety and lack of immunogenicity of prGCD. Following these encouraging results, a pivotal phase III clinical trial for prGCD was FDA approved and is currently ongoing.

https://openalex.org/W2162668590,"The Parkinson's disease (PD)-associated gene DJ-1 mediates direct neuroprotection. The up-regulation of DJ-1 in reactive astrocytes also suggests a role in glia. Here we show that DJ-1 regulates proinflammatory responses in mouse astrocyte-rich primary cultures. When treated with a Toll-like receptor 4 agonist, the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Dj-1-knockout astrocytes generated >10 times more nitric oxide (NO) than littermate controls. Lentiviral reintroduction of DJ-1 restored the NO response to LPS. The enhanced NO production in Dj-1(-/-) astrocytes was mediated by a signaling pathway involving reactive oxygen species leading to specific hyperinduction of type II NO synthase [inducible NO synthase (iNOS)]. These effects coincided with significantly increased phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and p38(MAPK) inhibition suppressed NO production and iNOS mRNA and protein induction. Dj-1(-/-) astrocytes also induced the proinflammatory mediators cyclooxygenase-2 and interleukin-6 significantly more strongly, but not nerve growth factor. Finally, primary neuron cultures grown on Dj-1(-/-) astrocytes became apoptotic in response to LPS in an iNOS-dependent manner, directly demonstrating the neurotoxic potential of astrocytic DJ-1 deficiency. These findings identify DJ-1 as a regulator of proinflammatory responses and suggest that loss of DJ-1 contributes to PD pathogenesis by deregulation of astrocytic neuroinflammatory damage."
https://openalex.org/W2135087277,"The RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), RIG-I and MDA5, recognize single-stranded RNA with 5′ triphosphates and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to initiate innate antiviral immune responses. LGP2, a homolog of RIG-I and MDA5 that lacks signaling capability, regulates the signaling of the RLRs. To establish the structural basis of dsRNA recognition by the RLRs, we have determined the 2.0-Å resolution crystal structure of human LGP2 C-terminal domain bound to an 8-bp dsRNA. Two LGP2 C-terminal domain molecules bind to the termini of dsRNA with minimal contacts between the protein molecules. Gel filtration chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrated that LGP2 binds blunt-ended dsRNA of different lengths, forming complexes with 2:1 stoichiometry. dsRNA with protruding termini bind LGP2 and RIG-I weakly and do not stimulate the activation of RIG-I efficiently in cells. Surprisingly, full-length LGP2 containing mutations that abolish dsRNA binding retained the ability to inhibit RIG-I signaling.

Synthetic dsRNA mimics, such as polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I·C)), can activate MDA5 when introduced into the cytoplasm of cells. Digestion of poly(I·C) with RNase III transforms poly(I·C) from a ligand for MDA5 into a ligand for RIG-I, suggesting that MDA5 recognizes long dsRNA, whereas RIG-I recognizes short dsRNA (15Kato H.

The helicase domain and the CTD are responsible for viral RNA binding, whereas the CARDs are required for signaling (3Yoneyama M. Fujita T. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2008; 20: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The current model of RIG-I activation suggests that under resting conditions RIG-I is in a suppressed conformation, and viral RNA binding triggers a conformation change that leads to the exposure of the CARDs for the recruitment of the downstream protein IPS-1 (also known as MAVS, Cardif, or VISA) (14Takahasi K.

A large, positively charged surface on RIG-I recognizes the 5′ triphosphate group of viral ssRNA (14Takahasi K. Yoneyama M. Nishihori T. Hirai R. Kumeta H. Narita R. Gale Jr., M. Inagaki F. Fujita T.

However, the exact nature of how the RLRs recognize viral RNA and how RNA binding activates these receptors remains to be established.LGP2 is a homolog of RIG-I and MDA5 that lacks the CARDs and thus has no signaling capability (21Rothenfusser S. Goutagny N. DiPerna G. Gong M. Monks B.G. Schoenemeyer A. Yamamoto M. Akira S. Fitzgerald K.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5260-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 22Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M.

The expression of LGP2 is inducible by dsRNA or IFN treatment as well as virus infection (21Rothenfusser S. Goutagny N. DiPerna G. Gong M. Monks B.G. Schoenemeyer A. Yamamoto M. Akira S. Fitzgerald K.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5260-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Overexpression of LGP2 inhibits Sendai virus and Newcastle disease virus signaling (21Rothenfusser S.

When coexpressed with RIG-I, LGP2 can inhibit RIG-I signaling through the interaction of its CTD with the CARD and the helicase domain of RIG-I (18Saito T. Hirai R. Loo Y.M. Owen D. Johnson C.L. Sinha S.C. Akira S. Fujita T. Gale Jr., M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). LGP2 could suppress RIG-I signaling by three possible ways (23Komuro A. Bamming D. Horvath C.M. Cytokine. 2008; 43: 350-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar): 1) binding RNA with high affinity, thereby sequestering RNA ligands from RIG-I; 2) interacting directly with RIG-I to block the assembly of the signaling complex; and 3) competing with IKKi (IκB kinase ϵ) in the NF-κB signaling pathway for a common binding site on IPS-1. To elucidate the structural basis of dsRNA recognition by the RLRs, we have crystallized human LGP2 CTD (residues 541-678) bound to an 8-bp double-stranded RNA and determined the structure of the complex at 2.0 Å resolution. The structure revealed that LGP2 CTD binds to the termini of dsRNA. Mutagenesis and functional studies showed that dsRNA binding is likely not required for the inhibition of RIG-I signaling by LGP2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—DNAs encoding the C-terminal domains of human LGP2 (residues 541-678), RIG-I (residues 802-925), and MDA5 (residues 892-1017) were cloned into expression vector pET22b(+) (Novagen). All of the cloned DNA sequences were confirmed by plasmid DNA sequencing. The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) by induction at A600 = 0.6-0.8 with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside overnight at 15 °C. The cells were lysed by sonication, and the proteins were purified by batch method using His-Select nickel affinity resin (Sigma-Aldrich) in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, at pH 7.5 (buffer A). After incubation for 2 h, the nickel beads were collected and washed three times with 10 volumes of buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole, and the proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole. The proteins were further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex75 (1.6 × 60) column (GE Healthcare) eluted with buffer A. To form the complex with dsRNA, LGP2 CTD were mixed with an 8-bp dsRNA at a molar ratio of 1:1, and the 2:1 LGP2·dsRNA complex was purified by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex75 (1.6 × 60) column. Mutants of full-length LGP2 and LGP2 CTD were generated using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequences of the mutants were confirmed by plasmid DNA sequencing. The mutant proteins were expressed and purified the same way as the native protein.Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—Purified LGP2·dsRNA complex was concentrated to ∼30 mg ml-1 in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 4 mm dithiothreitol at pH 7.5. The complex was crystallized with 16-18% (w/v) PEG3350 in a buffer containing 0.2 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m Tris-HCl at pH 8.5. The crystals were transferred stepwise from the mother liquor to a cryoprotectant containing 25% (v/v) glycerol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The LGP2·dsRNA complex crystallized in space group C2, with cell dimensions: a = 116.46 Å, b = 54.19 Å, c = 67.20 Å, and β = 97.26°. The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains one 2:1 LGP2·dsRNA complex. Diffraction data were collected using a Rigaku RAXIS IV2+ image plate detector mounted on a Rigaku Micromax-007HF generator and processed with the HKL package (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The crystal structure of the LGP2·dsRNA complex was determined by molecular replacement with MOLREP in the CCP4 suite (25Collaborative Computational ProjectActa Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50 (number 4): 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar) using the crystal structure of RIG-I CTD as search model (Protein Data Bank code 2QFB, chain A). The model was rebuilt using O (26Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). After several rounds of rebuilding and refinement with CNS (27Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar), the electron density for the dsRNA became apparent. An 8-bp dsRNA from the TLR3·dsRNA complex structure (Protein Data Bank code 3CIY) was docked into the electron density map and rebuilt with O. The complex structure was refined by several rounds of positional, simulated annealing, and individual B-factor refinement using CNS followed by manual remodeling after each round of refinement.RNA Binding Studies by Gel Filtration Chromatography—RNAs used in the binding studies were chemically synthesized by IDT (Coralville, IA) or by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase. The sequences of the RNAs are shown in supplemental Table S2. Double-stranded RNAs were generated by heating the ssRNA at 95 °C for 5 min and annealing at room temperature for 30 min. Each dsRNA was mixed with excess protein (RNA to protein molar ratio of 1:3), and 100 μl of samples were injected over a Superdex200 (10/300 GL) column (GE Healthcare) eluted with buffer A. The column was calibrated with a set of protein standards for gel filtration chromatography (Bio-Rad) to ensure accurate estimation of the molecular weight of the LGP2·dsRNA complexes.RNA Binding Studies by Fluorescence Anisotropy—Cy3-labeled RNA probes were heated to anneal with their complementary RNA to form dsRNA. Fluorescence measurements were performed at room temperature using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences luminescence spectrometer LS55. The excitation and emission wavelengths are 540 and 565 nm, respectively, with an integration time of 2 s and slit width of 5 nm. Purified LGP2, RIG-I, and MDA5 CTD were titrated into the dsRNA in buffer A and mixed by magnetic stirring. Total volume of protein added was less than 3% of the final sample volume. The represented anisotropy values used to calculate the affinity are the average of 10 measurements. The binding data were analyzed by nonlinear least square fitting using KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). The Hill equation, ΔA = Bmax Xn/(Xn + Kdn) was used to determine the dissociation constant (Kd). In this equation, ΔA is the anisotropy change caused by the ligand binding, Bmax is the maximum anisotropy change, X is the total concentration of the input protein, and the exponential term n is the Hill coefficient. Binding studies for the mutants of LGP2 CTD were carried out under similar conditions.Analytical Ultracentrifugation—To verify the stoichiometry of LGP2 binding to dsRNA, LGP2 CTD complexes with the 8-bp dsRNA, the 24-bp dsRNA, and the hairpin RNA were analyzed by sedimentation velocity. 400-μl samples in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol were spun overnight at 48,000 rpm at 20 °C in a Beckman XL-I using absorbance optics at 302 nm. The data were analyzed by the program Sedfit using the c(s) and c(M) models to determine differential sedimentation coefficient and apparent mass distributions, respectively. The 8-bp dsRNA·LGP2 complex gave an estimated molecular mass value similar to that of a 2:1 complex, whereas the hairpin RNA·LGP2 complex had an estimated molecular mass consistent with a 1:1 complex. The 24-bp dsRNA·LGP2 complex sedimented as a single peak, but the estimated mass could indicate either a 2:1 or a 2:2 complex. To resolve the stoichiometry, a sedimentation equilibrium experiment was performed on the 24-bp dsRNA·LGP2 complex. 100-μl samples of purified 24-bp dsRNA·LGP2 complex at concentrations of 10, 33.3, and 100 μm were spun at 17,000, 21,000, and 30,000 rpm at 20 °C until equilibrium was reached, and scanned at 297 and 305 nm. The data were trimmed using Win-Reedit and globally analyzed using WinNonlin. The global analysis of nine data sets revealed that the data could be described by a single species with a reduced buoyant molecular weight of 1.836 (at a speed of 17,000 rpm). To convert to experimental molecular weight, the partial specific volume must be known; for a protein·RNA complex this value corresponds to the weight average of each component in the sedimenting species. The partial specific volume for LGP2 CTD alone was calculated to be 0.7328 based on sequence using Sednterp, and that for the 24-bp dsRNA was calculated to be 0.5688 using the NucProt server. Both 2:1 and 2:2 complexes were considered, with weight average partial specific volumes of 0.6813 or 0.6566, respectively. The data were consistent with a 2:1 complex but were not consistent with either a 1:1 or a 2:2 complex.Reporter Gene Assays—Actively growing HEK 293T cells were plated in CoStar White 96-well plates at 4.4 × 104 cells ml-1 for transfection. When the cells were ∼60-80% confluent, they were transfected with a mixture of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and constant amounts of the reporter plasmids IFN-β Luc (30 ng) or pNiFty Luc (15 ng; Invivogen), which contain the firefly luciferase gene, phRL-TK (5 ng, Promega), and phRIG-I (0.5 ng; Invivogen). In the functional assays of LGP2, phLGP2 (1.0 ng; Invivogen) were cotransfected with the same amount of phRIG-I and the reporter plasmids as described above. The cells were incubated for 24 h to allow expression from the plasmids. The dsRNA ligands were then transfected into the cells at a final concentration of 0.5 or 0.2 μm as indicated in the figure legend. After 12 h of incubation, the cells were analyzed using the Dual Glo luciferase assay system reagents (Promega), quantifying luminescence with the FLU-Ostar OPTIMA Plate Reader (BMG Labtech.). The ratios of firefly luciferase over Renilla luciferase were plotted. The RNA ligands used were purified by preparative denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or gel filtration chromatography.Western Blot—293T cells transfected with wild type LGP2 or its mutants were lysed with the passive lysis buffer (Promega) and sonicated to degrade chromosomal DNA. Equal amounts of proteins from each sample, as determined by staining with Coomassie Blue, were separated on NuPAGE 4-12% (w/v) bistris gels (Invitrogen) and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Affinity-purified rabbit antibody against human LGP2 (Proteintec) was used as primary antibody. The blots were developed with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and an ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (GE Healthcare).RESULTSOverall Structure of the LGP2·dsRNA Complex—The structure of LGP2 CTD in complex with dsRNA was determined by molecular replacement using the crystal structure of RIG-I CTD (19Cui S. Eisenacher K. Kirchhofer A. Brzozka K. Lammens A. Lammens K. Fujita T. Conzelmann K.K. Krug A. Hopfner K.P. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) as a search model. The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains a 2:1 complex between LGP2 CTD and the 8-bp dsRNA (Fig. 1A). The refined model includes residues 546-672 of LGP2 in molecule A, residues 544-678 of LGP2 plus a five-residue His tag in molecule B, and the 8-bp dsRNA. The complex exhibits pseudo 2-fold symmetry. The root mean square deviation between the two LGP2 CTD molecules is 0.45 Å. The following discussion is based on the structure of the complex between LGP2 (A) and the dsRNA caused by better defined electron density of the molecule. The structure of LGP2 CTD in the complex is shown in Fig. 1B.The 8-bp dsRNA binds to a deep groove between two LGP2 CTD molecules, making primary contacts with LGP2 through the two blunt ends (Fig. 1A). Apart from two hydrogen bonds that involve residue Lys650, the two protein molecules do not interact with each other, suggesting that formation of the protein dimer is not required for RNA binding. The dsRNA adopts a typical A-form structure with slight distortions at the two ends. The binding surfaces between LGP2 and dsRNA show a high degree of shape and charge complementarity (Fig. 1, C and D). LGP2 interacts with the phosphate backbone of the RNA through extensive electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding. The exposed terminal GC base pair interacts with LGP2 through extensive hydrophobic interactions. The total buried surface area at the LGP2 dsRNA interface is ∼1540 Å2, with major contributions from the first six nucleotides at the 5′ end of one RNA strand (buried surface area, ∼1020 Å2) and minor contributions from the two nucleotides from the 3′ end of the complementary strand (buried surface area, ∼520 Å2). The calculated shape correlation statistics (Sc, a measure of the degree that two contacting surfaces are geometrically matched) is 0.70, where an Sc value of 1.0 indicates a perfect fit (28Lawrence M.C. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). The buried surface area and shape complementarity between LGP2 and dsRNA are comparable with typical antibody·peptide antigen complexes, which have an average buried surface area of 1430 Å2 and an Sc of 0.75 (29Li P. Huey-Tubman K.E. Gao T. Li X. West Jr., A.P. Bennett M.J. Bjorkman P.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).Structure of LGP2 C-terminal Domain—Although the amino acid sequences of LGP2 and RIG-I CTD are only 25% identical (supplemental Fig. S1), the structures of LGP2 and RIG-I CTD are highly conserved (Fig. 1E). The root mean square deviation between the 102 conserved Cα atoms in the two proteins is only 0.90 Å. LGP2 CTD contains a three-stranded (β1, β2, and β9) antiparallel β-sheet near its N terminus and a four-stranded (β5, β6, β7, and β8) antiparallel β-sheet in the middle (Fig. 1B). The two β-sheets are connected by a β-hairpin formed by strands β3 and β4 and two short α-helices. Four conserved cysteine residues (Cys556, Cys559, Cys612, and Cys615) in the two loops connecting strands β1-β2 and β6-β7 make additional connections between the two β-sheets by coordinating a zinc ion (Fig. 1B). The eight residues near the C terminus of LGP2 form a well defined α-helix, whereas the corresponding helix in RIG-I is only four residues long. The RNA-binding site of LGP2 is located at the large concave surface defined by the β-sheet containing strands β5 to β8, the β-hairpin, and the three loops connecting β5 to β6, β8 to β9, and β9 to the C-terminal helix (Fig. 1, B and C).The major difference between the crystal structure of LGP2 and RIG-I CTD occurs in the long loop (loop5-6) connecting strands β5 and β6 (Fig. 1E). NMR structure of RIG-I CTD showed that this loop is flexible (14Takahasi K. Yoneyama M. Nishihori T. Hirai R. Kumeta H. Narita R. Gale Jr., M. Inagaki F. Fujita T. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 428-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The structure of LGP2 CTD in isolation showed that this loop is not ordered (20Pippig D.A. Hellmuth J.C. Cui S. Kirchhofer A. Lammens K. Lammens A. Schmidt A. Rothenfusser S. Hopfner K.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 10.1093/nar/gkp059PubMed Google Scholar). The ordered structure of this loop observed in the LGP2·dsRNA complex structure (Fig. 1E) is most likely due to the binding of dsRNA, especially the hydrophobic interactions with the two bases at the blunt end of the dsRNA.Structural Basis of dsRNA Recognition by LGP2—Unlike TLR3 that binds primarily to the phosphate backbone of long dsRNA (30Liu L. Botos I. Wang Y. Leonard J.N. Shiloach J. Segal D.M. Davies D.R. Science. 2008; 320: 379-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), LGP2 binds specifically to the ends of dsRNA (Fig. 2A and Table 2). The exposed terminal GC base pairs are recognized through hydrophobic interactions that involve residues Val632, Leu621, Val595, Ile597, Phe601, and Trp604 (Fig. 2, B and C, and Table 2). However, there are significant differences in the interactions between LGP2 CTD and the two RNA strands at each of the dsRNA terminus. The two hydroxyl groups of the ribose at the 3′ end of the two RNA strands interact with LGP2 through a network of five direct hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Glu573, His576, and Trp604 (Fig. 2B), as well as a solvent-mediated hydrogen bond with the backbone amine gro"
https://openalex.org/W2017407156,"Searching for generic behaviors has been one of the driving forces leading to a deep understanding and classification of diverse phenomena. Usually a starting point is the development of a phenomenology based on observations. Such is the case for power law distributions encountered in a wealth of situations coming from physics, geophysics, biology, lexicography as well as social and financial networks. This finding is however restricted to a range of values outside of which finite size corrections are often invoked. Here we uncover a universal behavior of the way in which elements of a system are distributed according to their rank with respect to a given property, valid for the full range of values, regardless of whether or not a power law has previously been suggested. We propose a two parameter functional form for these rank-ordered distributions that gives excellent fits to an impressive amount of very diverse phenomena, coming from the arts, social and natural sciences. It is a discrete version of a generalized beta distribution, given by f(r) = A(N+1-r)(b)/r(a), where r is the rank, N its maximum value, A the normalization constant and (a, b) two fitting exponents. Prompted by our genetic sequence observations we present a growth probabilistic model incorporating mutation-duplication features that generates data complying with this distribution. The competition between permanence and change appears to be a relevant, though not necessary feature. Additionally, our observations mainly of social phenomena suggest that a multifactorial quality resulting from the convergence of several heterogeneous underlying processes is an important feature. We also explore the significance of the distribution parameters and their classifying potential. The ubiquity of our findings suggests that there must be a fundamental underlying explanation, most probably of a statistical nature, such as an appropriate central limit theorem formulation."
https://openalex.org/W2016397316,"Background The p53 tumor suppressor gene is mutated in about half of human cancers, but the p53 pathway is thought to be functionally inactivated in the vast majority of cancer. Understanding how tumor cells can become insensitive to p53 activation is therefore of major importance. Using an RNAi-based genetic screen, we have identified three novel genes that regulate p53 function. Results We have screened the NKI shRNA library targeting 8,000 human genes to identify modulators of p53 function. Using the shRNA barcode technique we were able to quickly identify active shRNA vectors from a complex mixture. Validation of the screening results indicates that the shRNA barcode technique can reliable identify active shRNA vectors from a complex pool. Using this approach we have identified three genes, ARNTL, RBCK1 and TNIP1, previously unknown to regulate p53 function. Importantly, ARNTL (BMAL1) is an established component of the circadian regulatory network. The latter finding adds to recent observations that link circadian rhythm to the cell cycle and cancer. We show that cells having suppressed ARNTL are unable to arrest upon p53 activation associated with an inability to activate the p53 target gene p21CIP1. Conclusions We identified three new regulators of the p53 pathway through a functional genetic screen. The identification of the circadian core component ARNTL strengthens the link between circadian rhythm and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2073682280,"In fungi and metazoans, the SCF-type Ubiquitin protein ligases (E3s) play a critical role in cell cycle regulation by degrading negative regulators, such as cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) at the G1-to-S-phase checkpoint. Here we report that FBL17, an Arabidopsis thaliana F-box protein, is involved in cell cycle regulation during male gametogenesis. FBL17 expression is strongly enhanced in plants co-expressing E2Fa and DPa, transcription factors that promote S-phase entry. FBL17 loss-of-function mutants fail to undergo pollen mitosis II, which generates the two sperm cells in mature A. thaliana pollen. Nonetheless, the single sperm cell-like cell in fbl17 mutants is functional but will exclusively fertilize the egg cell of the female gametophyte, giving rise to an embryo that will later abort, most likely due to the lack of functional endosperm. Seed abortion can, however, be overcome by mutations in FIE, a component of the Polycomb group complex, overall resembling loss-of-function mutations in the A. thaliana cyclin-dependent kinase CDKA;1. Finally we identified ASK11, as an SKP1-like partner protein of FBL17 and discuss a possible mechanism how SCF(FBL17) may regulate cell division during male gametogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1985383424,"Insulin signaling is essential for normal glucose homeostasis. Rho-kinase (ROCK) isoforms have been shown to participate in insulin signaling and glucose metabolism in cultured cell lines. To investigate the physiological role of ROCK1 in the regulation of whole body glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in vivo, we studied mice with global disruption of ROCK1. Here we show that, at 16–18 weeks of age, ROCK1-deficient mice exhibited insulin resistance, as revealed by the failure of blood glucose levels to decrease after insulin injection. However, glucose tolerance was normal in the absence of ROCK1. These effects were independent of changes in adiposity. Interestingly, ROCK1 gene ablation caused a significant increase in glucose-induced insulin secretion, leading to hyperinsulinemia. To determine the mechanism(s) by which deletion of ROCK1 causes insulin resistance, we measured the ability of insulin to activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and multiple distal pathways in skeletal muscle. Insulin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity associated with IRS-1 or phospho-tyrosine was also reduced ∼40% without any alteration in tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor in skeletal muscle. Concurrently, serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 at serine 632/635, which is phosphorylated by ROCK in vitro, was also impaired in these mice. Insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt, AS160, S6K, and S6 was also decreased in skeletal muscle. These data suggest that ROCK1 deficiency causes systemic insulin resistance by impairing insulin signaling in skeletal muscle.

The ability of insulin to acutely stimulate glucose uptake and metabolism in peripheral tissues such as skeletal muscle and adipose tissue is critical for the regulation of normal glucose homeostasis (1DeFronzo R.A. Diabetes Rev. 1997; 5: 177-269Google Scholar). Impairments in insulin secretion and in the response of peripheral tissues to insulin (i.e. insulin resistance) are major pathogenic features of type 2 diabetes and contribute to the morbidity of obesity (1DeFronzo R.A.

Insulin action involves a series of signaling cascades initiated by insulin binding to its receptor, eliciting receptor autophosphorylation and activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates (IRSs) 4The abbreviations used are: IR, insulin receptor; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; ROCK, Rho-kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; WT, wild type; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ANOVA, analysis of variance; ITT, insulin tolerance tests; GTT, glucose tolerance tests.

Although the mechanism(s) underlying insulin resistance are not completely understood in peripheral tissues such as skeletal muscle, they are thought to result, at least in part, from impaired insulin-stimulated signal transduction (7Kahn B.B.

Previous studies have indicated that ROCK chemical inhibition is beneficial for reversing certain disease abnormalities in hypertension and diabetic nephropathy (18Hu E. Lee D. Curr. Opin. Investig.

Studies of the effects of ROCK inhibitors on glucose homeostasis in animals have yielded conflicting results, however. In obese Zucker rats, chronic treatment with the ROCK inhibitor fasudil decreases blood pressure and improves glucose tolerance (21Kanda T. Wakino S. Homma K. Yoshioka K. Tatematsu S. Hasegawa K. Takamatsu I. Sugano N. Hayashi K. Saruta T. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, very recently, chronic treatment of obese db/db mice with the inhibitor fasudil was reported to have no effect on blood glucose levels (20Kolavennu V. Zeng L. Peng H. Wang Y. Danesh F.R. Diabetes. 2008; 57: 714-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In contrast, in normal mice, we found that acute treatment with ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 causes insulin resistance in vivo by reducing insulin-mediated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle (22Furukawa N.

In support of this, our previous work demonstrated that overexpression of dominant negative ROCK decreases insulin-stimulated glucose transport in L6 muscle cells, isolated soleus muscle ex vivo, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes via impairing PI3K activity (22Furukawa N.

However, the use of different inhibitors, doses, treatment times, and animal models in these in vivo animal studies limits understanding of the roles of ROCK in regulating glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in vivo. The fact that ROCK inhibitors target both ROCK isoforms and that their specificities may not be absolute further complicates interpretation of these studies (23Riento K. Ridley A.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the physiological role of ROCK1 in the regulation of glucose homeostasis, whole body insulin sensitivity, and insulin action in mice with particular emphasis on the molecular basis of insulin resistance. Here we provide the evidence that global ROCK1 deficiency in mice causes insulin resistance in vivo in part via serine 632/635 phosphorylation of IRS-1. These data identify ROCK1 as a novel regulator of whole body glucose homeostasis and insulin signaling in vivo. Animals—ROCK1 knock-out (ROCK1–/–) mice used for experiments were generated on a C57BL/6–129/SvJ mixed background and then backcrossed at least 10 generations onto an FVB background (24Zhang Y.M. Bo J. Taffet G.E. Chang J. Shi J. Reddy A.K. Michael L.H. Schneider M.D. Entman M.L. Schwartz R.J. Wei L. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 916-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Heterozygous ROCK1-deficient (ROCK1+/–) and ROCK1–/– mice were viable with no detectable anatomic abnormalities (24Zhang Y.M. Bo J. Taffet G.E. Chang J. Shi J. Reddy A.K. Michael L.H.

ROCK1+/– mice were intercrossed to generate male and female wild type (WT), ROCK1+/–, and ROCK1–/– littermates, which were studied at ∼16–18 weeks of age. The mice were fed standard chow (PMI Feeds, Inc., St. Louis, MO) ad libitum and housed under controlled temperature at 24 °C and a 12-h light-dark cycle with light from 6:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. All aspects of animal care and experimentation were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (34National Institutes HealthGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1996Google Scholar) and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Indiana University and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Metabolic Measurements—Blood was collected from random fed or overnight fasted mice via tail bleed between 8 and 10 a.m. Blood glucose was measured using an OneTouch Ultra glucose meter (LifeScan, Inc., Milpitas, CA). Serum insulin was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Crystal Chem Inc., Chicago, IL). For glucose tolerance tests, male mice were fasted overnight, and blood glucose was measured immediately before and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min after intraperitoneal injection of glucose (1.0 g/kg of body weight). For insulin tolerance tests, food was removed for 5 h in the morning, and blood glucose was measured immediately before and 15, 30, 45, 60, and 75 min after intraperitoneal injection of human insulin (0.75 unit/kg of body weight; HumulinR, Lilly). The area under the curve or above the curve for glucose or insulin was calculated (see Fig. 1) using the trapezoidal rule for glucose or insulin data. Insulin Signaling Studies—Female WT, ROCK1+/–, and ROCK–/– mice were fasted overnight. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with human insulin (10 unit/kg of body weight; HumulinR) or saline and scarified 10 min later. Gastrocnemius muscle was rapidly removed and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until analysis. Muscle was homogenized in lysis buffer as described (22Furukawa N. Ongusaha P.

The bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence and quantified by densitometry (25Kim Y.B. Shulman G.I. Kahn B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32915-32922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All phosphorylation data were normalized by the total protein levels. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences between two groups were assessed using unpaired two-tailed t tests and among more than two groups by ANOVA. Data involving more than two repeated measures were assessed by repeated measures ANOVA. When a significant difference was found with ANOVA, post hoc analyses were performed with Fisher's protected least significant difference test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Analyses were performed using StatView software (BrainPower Inc.). ROCK1 Deficiency Impairs Insulin Sensitivity in Mice—Body weight tended to be slightly decreased in both female and male ROCK1–/– mice as compared with WT littermates, but differences were not statistically significant (supplemental Fig. 1, A and E). Adipose tissue mass in female ROCK1–/– mice tended to be lower than that in WT littermates (0.72 ± 0.10 g in WT mice versus 0.65 ± 0.12 g in ROCK1–/– mice). However, the effect was no longer present when normalized for body weight (2.52 ± 0.33% in WT mice versus 2.49 ± 0.37% in ROCK1–/– mice). There were no differences in liver or heart weight normalized to body weight between genotypes (liver, 4.20 ± 0.19% in WT mice versus 4.08 ± 0.14% in ROCK1–/– mice; heart, 0.47 ± 0.02% in WT mice versus 0.46 ± 0.02% in ROCK1–/– mice). At 16–18 weeks of age, female and male ROCK1–/– mice had similar fed and fasted blood glucose levels as compared with WT mice (supplemental Fig. 1, B and F). Fasted serum insulin levels tended to be higher in female ROCK1–/– mice (p < 0.10) but were significantly increased in male ROCK1–/– mice (p < 0.05) as compared with WT mice (supplemental Fig. 1, C and G). Female and male ROCK1–/– mice had a higher risk for insulin resistance, as revealed by higher insulin levels in the fed state. Fed serum insulin levels were increased ∼1.7-fold in female ROCK1–/– mice and ∼1.5-fold in male ROCK1–/– mice as compared with WT littermates (supplemental Fig. 1, C and G). When insulin sensitivity was expressed as the glucose × insulin product, both female and male ROCK1–/– mice displayed higher values than WT (1.8- and 2.0-fold, respectively), indicating that insulin sensitivity is decreased in these mice (supplemental Fig. 1, D and H). To determine the physiological consequence of the absence of ROCK1 in glucose metabolism, we evaluated glucose homeostasis in ROCK1–/– mice by insulin tolerance tests (ITTs) and glucose tolerance tests (GTTs). ROCK1–/– mice were insulin-resistant as evidenced by a lack of decrease in blood glucose levels after insulin injection (0.75 units/kg of body weight), whereas in WT mice, glucose levels decreased about 56% after insulin injection (Fig. 1A). The area above the glucose curve was decreased ∼25% in ROCK1+/– mice, although this did not reach significance (p < 0.10), and ∼50% in ROCK1–/– mice (p < 0.001) as compared with WT littermates (Fig. 1B). In contrast, glucose tolerance was normal in ROCK1–/– mice, as indicated by similar areas under the glucose curve during the GTT (Fig. 1, C and D). After an overnight fast, ROCK1–/– mice had elevated insulin levels at the start of the GTT. Moreover, glucose-induced insulin secretion during the GTT was significantly increased in ROCK1–/– mice as compared with WT littermates (Fig. 1E). The area under the insulin curve was increased by ∼50% in ROCK1–/– mice as compared with WT mice (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2F). When plotting glucose versus insulin during the GTT, ROCK1–/– and WT mice had similar slopes, indicating similar incremental pancreatic β-cell responsiveness to a glucose load (Fig. 1G). However, the regression intercept was significantly shifted upward for ROCK1–/– mice as compared with WT, such that for a given glucose level, the pancreas secreted 65% more insulin (Fig. 1G). ROCK1 Deficiency Impairs Skeletal Muscle Insulin Signaling in Mice—To explore the mechanism by which deletion of ROCK1 causes systemic insulin resistance, we measured the ability of insulin to activate PI3K and multiple distal pathways in skeletal muscle of ROCK1–/– mice. As expected, ROCK1 protein was not detected in muscle of ROCK1–/– mice, whereas ROCK2 protein expression was preserved (Fig. 2A). The levels of ROCK1 protein in ROCK1+/– mice were reduced by ∼35% in muscle as compared with WT mice (Fig. 2A). There is no significant difference in RhoA protein amounts among WT, ROCK1+/–, and ROCK1–/– mice (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the protein levels of RhoE were increased in ROCK1–/– mice as compared with WT littermates (Fig. 2A). Insulin-stimulated PI3K activity associated with IRS-1 or phospho-tyrosine was significantly decreased in skeletal muscle of ROCK1–/– mice as compared with WT (Fig. 2B). This decrease in PI3K activity corresponded closely with a reduction in IRS-1 tyrosine 612 phosphorylation, the binding site for the p85 subunit of PI3K, in ROCK1–/– mice (Fig. 2, C and D). In parallel, phosphorylation of IRS-1 at serine 632/635, which is phosphorylated by ROCK in vitro (22Furukawa N. Ongusaha P. Jahng W.J. Araki K. Choi C.S. Kim H.J. Lee Y.H. Kaibuchi K. Kahn B.B. Masuzaki H. Kim J.K. Lee S.W. Kim Y.B. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), was also impaired in ROCK1–/– mice (Fig. 2, C and D). Concurrently, insulin stimulation of Akt and AS160 phosphorylation in skeletal muscle was decreased in ROCK1–/– mice as compared with WT (Fig. 2, C and D). Furthermore, ROCK1 deficiency decreased phosphorylation of S6K, and its downstream S6 ribosomal protein was induced by insulin. Interestingly, S6 phosphorylation was markedly reduced in ROCK1+/– mice despite normal S6K phosphorylation (Fig. 2, C and D). Except for S6K phosphorylation, the activation of skeletal muscle insulin signaling in ROCK1+/– mice in response to insulin stimulation was intermediate between ROCK1–/– and WT mice. Importantly, ROCK1 deficiency did not affect insulin-stimulated IR tyrosine phosphorylation, IRS-1 serine 307 phosphorylation, and MAPK phosphorylation in skeletal muscle (Fig. 2, C and D). Protein expression of insulin signaling molecules was not altered by ROCK1 deficiency. Loss of ROCK1 also had no effect on the expression of Glut4, the insulin-responsive glucose transporter in skeletal muscle (Fig. 2, C and D). Our previous work demonstrated that overexpression of dominant negative ROCK inhibits insulin-stimulated IRS-1-associated PI3K but not the phosphorylation of Akt at both Ser473 and Thr308 and p70 S6 kinase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (22Furukawa N. Ongusaha P. Jahng W.J. Araki K. Choi C.S. Kim H.J. Lee Y.H. Kaibuchi K. Kahn B.B. Masuzaki H. Kim J.K. Lee S.W. Kim Y.B. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, in the present study, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and p70 S6kinase was significantly reduced in ROCK1-deficient mice. This discrepancy is likely due to the fact that previous studies were done in vitro in adipocytes, whereas the current studies were performed in vivo in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, we used a dominant negative form of ROCK2, which inhibits the activity of both ROCK1 and ROCK2 (26Kobayashi K. Takahashi M. Matsushita N. Miyazaki J. Koike M. Yaginuma H. Osumi N. Kaibuchi K. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3480-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 27Shirai H. Autieri M. Eguchi S. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2007; 16: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, another explanation for this might be differences in ROCK isoform specificity. The current study provides in vivo evidence of a physiological role of ROCK1 in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and insulin signaling and identifies a potentially novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. Our previous work demonstrated that dominant negative ROCK overexpression or chemical ROCK inhibition decreases insulin-stimulated glucose transport in L6 muscle cells and isolated skeletal muscle ex vivo via impairing IRS-1-associated PI3K activity (22Furukawa N. Ongusaha P. Jahng W.J. Araki K. Choi C.S. Kim H.J. Lee Y.H. Kaibuchi K. Kahn B.B. Masuzaki H. Kim J.K. Lee S.W. Kim Y.B.

Consistent with these in vitro data, we report here that ROCK1 deficiency in mice results in whole body insulin resistance and impaired skeletal muscle insulin signaling. These effects are independent of changes in body adiposity. Akt and AS160 phosphorylation, both of which are required for insulin-dependent Glut4 translocation (6Sano H. Kane S. Sano E. Miinea C.P.

Despite this, glucose tolerance of ROCK1–/– mice was normal, which may result from increased glucose-induced insulin secretion. Indeed, our results show that ROCK1–/– mice have elevated serum insulin during the glucose excursion of a glucose tolerance test as well as in the fasted and fed states. The increased serum insulin in ROCK1–/– mice may be due to β-cell compensation for insulin resistance. Alternatively, ROCK1 may directly regulate insulin secretion, as evidenced by the fact that ROCK inhibition in primary pancreatic β-cells prolongs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (29Hammar E. Tomas A. Bosco D. Halban P.A. Endocrinology. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, ROCK inhibition in pancreatic β-cell-derived HIT-T15 cells markedly increased insulin gene expression (30Nakamura Y. Kaneto H. Miyatsuka T. Matsuoka T.A. Matsuhisa M. Node K. Hori M. Yamasaki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Importantly, however, ROCK1 deficiency had no effect on insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IR in skeletal muscle, indicating that the effects of ROCK1 on whole body glucose homeostasis are downstream of IR. Thus, our data suggest that ROCK1 functions in skeletal muscle may be critical in regulating whole body glucose homeostasis. Data emerging from several laboratories over the past several years indicate that serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 is a key regulator of insulin signaling (31Zick Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, the effects of phosphorylation of individual IRS-1 serine residues on insulin signaling appear to be complex, maybe context-dependent, and are still being defined. The mechanism(s) by which dominant negative ROCK overexpression or chemical ROCK inhibition decreases insulin-stimulated glucose transport in cultured cells in vitro is due in part to the absence of ROCK-dependent IRS-1 serine 632/635 phosphorylation, which impairs interaction of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (22Furukawa N. Ongusaha P. Jahng W.J. Araki K. Choi C.S. Kim H.J. Lee Y.H. Kaibuchi K. Kahn B.B. Masuzaki H. Kim J.K. Lee S.W. Kim Y.B. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Consistent with these data, insulin-stimulated IRS-1 serine 632/635 phosphorylation and PI3K activity associated with IRS-1 or phospho-tyrosine are impaired in skeletal muscle of ROCK1–/– mice. Impaired insulin-induced IRS-1 serine 632/635 phosphorylation also accompanies decreased PI3K and ROCK activation in skeletal muscle of obese, insulin-resistant, or diabetic mice and rats, 5Y. B. Kim, unpublished data. suggesting that impaired IRS-1 serine 632/635 phosphorylation may be an important mechanism contributing to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in obesity. Reducing phosphorylation of IRS-1 serine 632/635 may impair PI3K activity by altering the affinity of the adjacent tyrosine 612 YXXM motif for PI3K (3White M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E413-E422Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Furukawa N. Ongusaha P. Jahng W.J. Araki K. Choi C.S. Kim H.J. Lee Y.H. Kaibuchi K. Kahn B.B. Masuzaki H. Kim J.K. Lee S.W. Kim Y.B. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-mediated IRS-1 serine 632/635 phosphorylation has been shown to inhibit insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in 293 HEK cells (32Um S.H. Frigerio F. Watanabe M. Picard F. Joaquin M. Sticker M. Fumagalli S. Allegrini P.R. Kozma S.C. Auwerx J. Thomas G. Nature. 2004; 431: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar, 33Ozes O.N.

Further studies will be needed to determine whether the disparate effects of IRS-1 serine 632/635 phosphorylation in these models reflects other concurrent modifications of IRS-1. Regardless, our data provide key in vivo experimental evidence that ROCK1 regulates insulin action in controlling whole body glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. In conclusion, results reported here show that deficiency of ROCK1 causes whole body insulin resistance by impairing insulin signaling in skeletal muscle, suggesting that activation of ROCK1 is essential for the normal actions of insulin on glucose transport in skeletal muscle in vivo. Thus, our studies identify ROCK1 as a novel stimulator of insulin action in vivo. Further studies of ROCK1 and ROCK2 functions in different metabolic tissues will be needed to precisely delineate ROCK isoform functions to regulate tissue and whole body insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. The emergence of ROCK1 as an important regulator of insulin action could further lead to new treatment approaches for obesity and type 2 diabetes.

https://openalex.org/W1998553096,"Cells protrude by polymerizing monomeric (G) into polymeric (F) actin at the tip of the lamellipodium. Actin filaments are depolymerized towards the rear of the lamellipodium in a treadmilling process, thereby supplementing a G-actin pool for a new round of polymerization. In this scenario the concentrations of F- and G-actin are principal parameters, but have hitherto not been directly determined. By comparing fluorescence intensities of bleached and unbleached regions of lamellipodia in B16-F1 mouse melanoma cells expressing EGFP-actin, before and after extraction with Triton X-100, we show that the ratio of F- to G-actin is 3.2+/-0.9. Using electron microscopy to determine the F-actin content, this ratio translates into F- and G-actin concentrations in lamellipodia of approximately 500 microM and 150 microM, respectively. The excess of G-actin, at several orders of magnitude above the critical concentrations at filament ends indicates that the polymerization rate is not limited by diffusion and is tightly controlled by polymerization/depolymerization modulators."
https://openalex.org/W2016836972,"Retinoic acid (RA) and fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) signaling control endoderm patterning and pancreas induction/expansion. Based on these findings, RA and FGFs, excluding FGF4, have frequently been used in differentiation protocols to direct differentiation of hESCs into endodermal and pancreatic cell types. In vivo, these signaling pathways act in a temporal and concentration-dependent manner. However, in vitro, the underlying basis for the time of addition of growth and differentiation factors (GDFs), including RA and FGFs, as well as the concentration is lacking. Thus, in order to develop robust and reliable differentiation protocols of ESCs into mature pancreatic cell types, including insulin-producing beta cells, it will be important to mechanistically understand each specification step. This includes differentiation of mesendoderm/definitive endoderm into foregut endoderm--the origin of pancreatic endoderm.Here, we provide data on the individual and combinatorial role of RA and FGF4 in directing differentiation of ActivinA (AA)-induced hESCs into PDX1-expressing cells. FGF4's ability to affect endoderm patterning and specification in vitro has so far not been tested. By testing out the optimal concentration and timing of addition of FGF4 and RA, we present a robust differentiation protocol that on average generates 32% PDX1(+) cells. Furthermore, we show that RA is required for converting AA-induced hESCs into PDX1(+) cells, and that part of the underlying mechanism involves FGF receptor signaling. Finally, further characterization of the PDX1(+) cells suggests that they represent foregut endoderm not yet committed to pancreatic, posterior stomach, or duodenal endoderm.In conclusion, we show that RA and FGF4 jointly direct differentiation of PDX1(+) foregut endoderm in a robust and efficient manner. RA signaling mediated by the early induction of RARbeta through AA/Wnt3a is required for PDX1 expression. Part of RA's activity is mediated by FGF signaling."

How iron induces endothelial injury remains ill defined. To investigate this, we developed a novel ex vivo perfusion chamber that enables direct analysis of the effects of FeCl3 on the vasculature. We demonstrate that FeCl3 treatment of isolated mouse aorta, perfused with whole blood, was associated with endothelial denudation, collagen exposure, and occlusive thrombus formation. Strikingly exposing vessels to FeCl3 alone, in the absence of perfused blood, was associated with only minor vascular injury. Whole blood fractionation studies revealed that FeCl3-induced vascular injury was red blood cell (erythrocyte)-dependent, requiring erythrocyte hemolysis and hemoglobin oxidation for endothelial denudation.

Iron and heme-containing moieties are indispensable for the normal transport of oxygen in the blood; however, once released into the bloodstream these molecules are highly toxic to the vasculature because of their pro-oxidative effects on the endothelium (1Halliwell B.

Humans have therefore evolved sophisticated iron transport and sequestration systems as well as heme-metabolizing enzymes to rapidly clear iron and heme from the circulation (4Andrews N.C.

Whether the pro-oxidative effects of iron per se are proatherogenic remains controversial; however, in the context of erythrocyte-dependent release of hemoglobin and heme, redox-active iron is likely to play an important role in promoting vascular dysfunction. The well defined pro-oxidative properties of redox-active iron have been exploited experimentally with topical application of ferric chloride (FeCl3) widely used to induce vascular injury and thrombosis in experimental animal models (22Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3355-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). High concentrations of FeCl3 induce profound injury to the vasculature, leading to endothelial denudation, and collagen and tissue factor exposure, leading to the rapid formation of vaso-occlusive thrombi. Histologically FeCl3-induced thrombi are rich in platelets, fibrin, and red blood cells (23Kurz K.D. Main B.W. Sandusky G.E. Thromb.

FeCl3 can have direct pro-oxidative effects on endothelial cells as a result of the Fenton reaction, leading to hydroxyl radical generation and lipid peroxidation (1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Mol.

A recent study has demonstrated transfer of ferric ions through the vasculature, penetrating the internal elastic membrane and emerging through the endothelium via an endocytic/exocytic pathway, leading to the development of ferric oxide aggregates in the vascular lumen (27Tseng M.T. Dozier A. Haribabu B. Graham U.M. Thromb. Res. 2006; 118: 275-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although the direct cytotoxic effects of redox-active iron on endothelial cells have been well established in vitro, the importance of this mechanism to the severe vascular injury and thrombus formation induced by topical FeCl3 in vivo remains unclear. To gain insight into this, we developed a novel ex vivo perfusion chamber that enables direct analysis of the effects of FeCl3 on the vasculature. Our studies demonstrated that FeCl3 alone induces relatively mild injury to endothelial cells with severe vascular injury only observed in the presence of flowing blood. Whole blood fractionation studies revealed that FeCl3-mediated vascular injury is dependent on erythrocyte hemolysis and hemoglobin oxidation, defining a unique mechanism of iron-induced vascular injury.

Sucrose gradient media, FeCl2 and FeCl3 solutions (60% (w/v) stock), hemin (protoporphyrin IX), Fe3+-EDTA, oxidized hemoglobin (methemoglobin (metHb)), purified haptoglobin, and the carbon monoxide donor tricarbonyldichlororuthenium(II) dimer were from Sigma.

A tracheotomy was performed, and mice were ventilated with room air via a respiratory pump (MiniVent Type 845; Harvard Apparatus). The aorta was exposed via a midline incision through the abdomen followed by retraction of intestines. The aorta was carefully dissected away from the inferior vena cava for a distance of 2-3 mm immediately inferior to the renal arteries. The exposed aorta was topically bathed in a 6% FeCl3 solution for 10 min after which the mice were euthanized with sodium pentobarbitone (100 mg/kg intravenously). The aorta was removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for subsequent histological and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Isolation of Mouse Aortas—Male and female C57Bl/6 mice (20-30 g) were euthanized via inhalation of CO2, and aortas were isolated and removed through a midline abdominal incision. Using a stereomicroscope, excess tissue and fat were removed from the outer surface of the aortas, which were placed in Krebs buffer on ice until experimentation (<1 h). Preparation of Whole Blood and Isolated Blood Cell Fractions—Anticoagulated (hirudin-treated) whole blood was collected from healthy volunteers who had given informed consent with the approval of the Monash University Human Ethics Committee. Murine blood was collected via the inferior vena cava. Platelets, leukocytes, and red blood cells were isolated and prepared according to published protocols (28Kulkarni S. Woollard K.J. Thomas S. Oxley D. Jackson S.P. Blood. 2007; 110: 1879-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Plasma was prepared by centrifugation (1500 × g) for 15 min at 37 °C. Each isolated blood cell component was reconstituted back to its original whole blood concentration, measured using an automated blood cell counter (Sysmex, Roche Applied Science) prior to perfusion through isolated vessel segments. In all studies whole blood/isolated cell preparations were maintained at 37 °C. Ex Vivo Vascular Injury and Thrombosis Model—Isolated aortas were mounted on a vessel chamber primed with Krebs buffer and maintained at physiological pH by infusing carbogen gas through the buffer at 37 °C. Anticoagulated human whole blood or reconstituted blood cell preparations were labeled with the membrane dye DiIC18 (1:1000). Blood cell preparations, metHb (0.38 mg/ml), or hemin (1 mm) were perfused through aortas at 0.12 ml/min using a Harvard syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus). In background studies we confirmed that this perfusion rate was optimal for efficient leukocyte-platelet and leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions. Moreover we noted no major differences in cell adhesion to the vasculature when using whole blood from different human donors or between human and mouse blood preparations as described previously (29Woollard K.J. Suhartoyo A. Harris E.E. Eisenhardt S.U. Jackson S.P. Peter K. Dart A.M. Hickey M.J. Chin-Dusting J.P. Circ. Res. 2008; 103: 1128-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Images and videos of vessel wall-blood cell interactions were observed using a Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope fitted with a 10× long working distance lens (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed using a Hammatsu camera coupled to Image ProPlus software (MediaCybernetics). Results were calculated as the mean ± S.D. and expressed as fluorescence intensity. Vascular injury was induced by removing the Krebs buffer surrounding the aorta and topically bathing the vessel in 6% FeCl3 or 6% FeCl2 for 10 min either before perfusion (with washout two times with Krebs buffer) or during perfusion. FeCl2 was made up to 6% (w/v) in saline. Saline was bubbled with nitrogen for 15 min prior to addition of FeCl2. The FeCl2 solution was then subsequently bubbled with nitrogen for 30 min prior to all treatments to prevent the solution from autooxidizing. In some experiments the carbon monoxide donor tricarbonyldichlororuthenium(II) dimer (10 μm) was added to whole blood, or carbon monoxide gas was bubbled directly into whole blood prior to perfusion in the presence of FeCl3. The antioxidants tempol (1 mm) or catalase (5000units/ml) were incubated with whole blood for 10 min prior to perfusion through isolated aortas. Blood components were further isolated before ex vivo perfusion, including red blood cells (RBCs) (see “Plasma Hemoglobin and Lipid Peroxidation Measurements”), plasma, leukocytes, and platelets via density centrifugation. Resuspended RBC ghosts (membranes) were prepared via RBC hemolysis with hypotonic cold water solution, and membranes were isolated via ultracentrifugation (14,000 rpm for 10 min) and perfused through aorta as describe above. At the conclusion of the experiments, aortas were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for subsequent analysis by SEM or immunofluorescence as described below. Endothelial cells were intact and viable in isolated aortic preparations as assessed by PECAM-1 staining by immunohistochemistry and nitric oxide (NO)-dependent endothelial relaxation as described previously (29Woollard K.J. Suhartoyo A. Harris E.E. Eisenhardt S.U. Jackson S.P. Peter K. Dart A.M. Hickey M.J. Chin-Dusting J.P. Circ. Res. 2008; 103: 1128-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Histology—Mouse aortas were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for at least 48 h prior to alcohol and xylene processing followed by paraffin embedding. Serial sections (5-mm thick) were cut and stained using Cartairs stain. Images were visualized using an Olympus BH2-RFCA microscope (Olympus) using ×20 and ×40 objectives. Scanning Electron Microscopy—Aortas were cut open and glued onto coverslips with the lumen uppermost. Vessels were then incubated with 1% OSO4 in 100 mm Na2HPO4, NaH2PO4, pH 7.4 for 30 min. The fixed vessels were dehydrated by successive immersions in increasing concentrations of ethanol followed by drying in increasing concentrations of hexamethyldisilazine in ethanol. The coverslips on which the dehydrated vessels were attached were mounted on SEM stubs and coated with gold prior to using a Hitachi 5570 scanning electron microscope. Images were acquired at ×300 and ×2500 magnification. Immunofluorescence Studies—Collagen exposure on the luminal surface of aorta was examined by incubating open vessel segments with a Texas Red-conjugated anti-collagen polyclonal antibody (20 min at 37 °C) (10 μg/ml), then washed two times in Krebs buffer, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and mounted onto coverslips for confocal analysis. Each vessel was visualized using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope using a 40× long working distance lens and laser/lens set on an excitation of 535 nm and emission of 585 nm. A conjugated isotype-matched antibody (10 μg/ml) was used as a negative control. Plasma Hemoglobin and Lipid Peroxidation Measurements—Hirudin-treated whole blood was collected as described above, and RBCs were isolated by centrifugation at 200 × g for 30 min. Platelet-rich plasma was removed and layered for density centrifugation for removal of leukocytes. Isolated RBCs were washed three times with washing buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm glucose). Treatment of whole blood or washed RBCs with FeCl3, FeCl2, and FeCl3-EDTA used in concentrations ranging from 0 to 0.25% was performed for the indicated time points (0-15 min). Incubations with tempol (1 mm), catalase (5000 units/ml), or haptoglobin (25 mg/dl) were performed for 10 min before induction of hemolysis. Whole blood or washed RBC preparations were centrifuged at 1500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the plasma or supernatant was collected. Total hemoglobin levels in plasma or supernatant samples were measured using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lipid peroxidation levels in each sample were assessed by measuring thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cayman). Statistics—Values are presented as the mean ± S.D. Grouped data were compared using a one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post hoc test. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05. All data are a minimum of n = 6, including representative images shown. Effect of Ferric Chloride on Vascular Injury and Arterial Thrombosis—To gain insight into the mechanism(s) by which FeCl3 induces vascular injury and in particular whether the effects are principally due to direct or indirect effects on the endothelium, we designed a novel ex vivo vessel chamber that enabled direct analysis of the effects of FeCl3 on the vasculature. In initial studies, we compared the vascular injury and thrombosis response in isolated mouse aortic preparations treated with FeCl3 (ex vivo) with those occurring in intact aorta in vivo. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, topically exposing aorta in vivo (Fig. 1A) or ex vivo (Fig. 1B) to 6% FeCl3 resulted in major vascular injury as evidenced by endothelial denudation, collagen exposure, and the subsequent formation of arterial thrombi (Fig. 1D and supplemental Video 1). Platelet thrombus formation in the ex vivo model occurred in the presence of hirudin (Fig. 1B); however, it was critically dependent on collagen activation of platelets as thrombus formation failed to develop using platelets deficient in the major collagen receptor GPVI/FcR γ-chain (FcR γ-/- mice) (data not shown). Histological examination revealed that thrombi formed in vivo were rich in platelets, fibrin, and RBCs (supplemental Fig. 1) consistent with previous reports (25Denis C.V. Wagner D.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 728-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although thrombi formed in the ex vivo model were principally composed of platelets, a high proportion of RBCs were also present in these thrombi (supplemental Fig. 1), a surprising finding given that RBC accumulation is typically fibrin-dependent (30Cadroy Y. Hanson S.R. Blood. 1990; 75: 2185-2193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidized iron can induce endothelial dysfunction directly through free radical generation and lipid peroxidation or indirectly through oxidative modification of LDL (3Balla J. Vercellotti G.M. Jeney V. Yachie A. Varga Z. Eaton J.W. Balla G. Mol. Nutr. Food Res. 2005; 49: 1030-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To investigate the direct effects of FeCl3 on aortic endothelium, FeCl3 was perfused through isolated aorta independently of flowing blood. Strikingly no endothelial denudation or collagen exposure was evident following prolonged exposure to FeCl3 (6%) (Fig. 1C). Subsequent perfusion of anticoagulated whole blood through FeCl3-pretreated vessels was associated with an increase in leukocyte and platelet adhesion to the vessel wall (Fig. 1E and supplemental Video 2); however, relative to untreated aorta (Fig. 1F and supplemental Video 3) and treatment in the presence of flowing blood (Fig. 1D and supplemental Video 1), thrombus formation was not observed. These studies indicate that although FeCl3 can perturb endothelial function, leading to an increase in platelet and leukocyte adhesion, in isolation it does not induce severe vascular injury or significant thrombus formation. Ferric Chloride-mediated Vascular Injury Is Erythrocyte-dependent—To investigate whether severe vascular injury was dependent on oxidative modification of plasma (e.g. LDL) or cellular components, blood fractionation experiments were performed. Removal of either platelet, leukocyte, or plasma components from whole blood did not prevent severe vascular injury in response to FeCl3 (data not shown). In contrast, selectively removing RBCs prevented endothelial denudation and collagen exposure, resulting in a relatively mild perturbation of endothelial function similar to that observed with FeCl3 alone (data not shown). To investigate whether FeCl3 induced RBC hemolysis, total extracellular hemoglobin (Hb) levels were examined. Treatment of whole blood with FeCl3 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in Hb levels with up to 200 μg/ml Hb released at 0.25% FeCl3 (p < 0.05; n = 6) (Fig. 2A). Analysis of higher concentrations of FeCl3 was not possible because of marked precipitating effects on plasma proteins. Analysis of Hb release from ex vivo vessel chamber experiments revealed a significant (p < 0.05; n = 4) increase in Hb levels following FeCl3 treatment of isolated aorta in the presence of flowing blood (157 ± 45 μg/ml), whereas FeCl3 pretreatment of vessels prior to blood perfusion caused no hemolysis (Fig. 2A). Analysis of the time course of hemolysis in whole blood revealed a rapid linear increase in Hb levels, peaking 10 min after FeCl3 addition (Fig. 2B), a time course consistent with the rapid hemolysis and vascular injury observed in the ex vivo aortic thrombosis model. Further evidence that hemolysis was likely to be directly relevant to FeCl3-induced vascular injury was obtained from SEM analysis of both in vivo and ex vivo aortic models, which demonstrated marked RBC fragmentation at sites of major injury (Fig. 2C, SEM insets). To investigate whether iron-induced RBC hemolysis occurred directly or required the presence of plasma proteins, the effects of FeCl3 were examined on isolated washed RBCs. As demonstrated in Fig. 2D, washed RBCs were highly sensitive to the hemolytic effects of FeCl3 with 3-fold higher levels of Hb released by 0.25% FeCl3 relative to whole blood (Fig. 2A). Haptoglobin, the major Hb-binding protein in whole blood, modulated the sensitivity of RBCs to iron-induced hemolysis as addition of purified haptoglobin to washed RBCs markedly reduced RBC hemolysis (Fig. 2D). To investigate whether oxidative injury was important for hemolysis, whole blood was treated with the superoxide dismutase mimetic tempol or the hydrogen peroxide-metabolizing enzyme catalase. As demonstrated in Fig. 2E, both tempol and catalase reduced FeCl3-induced RBC hemolysis by ∼50%. The hemolytic effects of iron on RBCs appeared to be dependent on its catalytic activity as catalytically active FeCl2 also induced hemolysis, albeit slightly less potently than FeCl3 (Fig. 2E), whereas Fe3+ (ferric ions) complexed to EDTA was less effective. Lipid peroxidation is a reported mechanism of iron-induced membrane damage (31Ko K.M. Godin D.V. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 95: 125-131PubMed Google Scholar, 32Gutteridge J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 917: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). To investigate whether there was a correlation between FeCl3- and FeCl2-induced RBC lipid per-oxidation and hemolysis; dose-response studies were performed. FeCl3 treatment resulted in a dose- (Fig. 3) and time-dependent (data not shown) increase in RBC lipid peroxidation, which correlated closely with hemolysis (Fig. 2B). This increase in lipid peroxidation was dependent on catalytically active iron as it was induced by FeCl2 with a potency similar to hemolysis and was markedly reduced by EDTA (Fig. 3). Ferric Chloride Oxidation of Hemoglobin Is Associated with Severe Vascular Injury—Oxidative modification of Hb produces metHb and a variety of other oxidizing molecules, including heme (2Alayash A.I. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In all experiments, ≥99% of Hb used was in an oxidized form (metHb) as measured by a blood gas analyzer. Therefore we examined the direct effects of metHb on the vasculature in our ex vivo arterial perfusion model. Perfusion of metHb alone did not induce significant vascular injury, whereas the heme substitute hemin induced mild endothelium denudation associated with a low level of collagen exposure and platelet aggregate formation on the perturbed endothelium (Fig. 4). Topical treatment with 6% FeCl3 with hemin (1 mm) perfusions caused no greater endothelial injury than FeCl3 or hemin (1 mm) alone (data not shown), whereas FeCl3 in the presence of low concentrations of metHb (0.38 mg/ml) induced extensive vascular injury similar to that observed with FeCl3 in the presence of whole blood (Figs. 4 and 1D, respectively). Notably the concentrations of hemin (heme) and metHb used in these studies were comparable to the levels generated by FeCl3 treatment of vessel preparations perfused with whole blood (data not shown). In control studies we confirmed that isolated red cell membranes, either alone or in combination with FeCl3, did not cause a greater level of vascular injury than did FeCl3 alone (data not shown), confirming that Hb release and subsequent oxidation are likely to be the predominant mechanism underlying FeCl3-induced vascular injury. Vascular Protective Effects of Antioxidants—By-products of heme and iron metabolism, such as heme oxygenase-dependent generation of carbon monoxide (CO), have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory protective functions against iron-induced vascular damage (33Morita T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 1786-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar); therefore we examined the impact of CO donors on collagen exposure and thrombus formation in the ex vivo vascular injury model. Pretreating anticoagulated whole blood with tricarbonyldichlororuthenium(II) dimer, a CO donor, significantly reduced collagen exposure (Fig. 5A) and thrombus formation (Fig. 5B) induced by FeCl3. A similar protective effect was observed when carbon monoxide gas was bubbled directly into whole blood prior to vessel perfusion (data not shown). Furthermore preincubating whole blood with either catalase or tempol prior to perfusion led to a significant reduction in collagen exposure and thrombus formation (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively), confirming a major role for oxidative stress in FeCl3-induced vascular injury and thrombus formation. The studies presented here have defined a key role for RBC hemolysis and Hb oxidation in promoting iron-induced vascular injury and thrombosis. Moreover they have demonstrated that released Hb plays an important role in exacerbating RBC hemolysis, establishing a damaging hemolysis/oxidative cycle that drives further red cell damage, vascular injury, and thrombosis. Several lines of evidence support a major role for iron-induced RBC hemoly"

In vivo phage display was used to identify peptides that specifically target tumor blood vessels. Several novel peptides were identified as being able to recognize tumor vasculature but not normal blood vessels in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice bearing human tumors. These tumor-homing peptides also bound to blood vessels in surgical specimens of various human cancers. The peptide-linked liposomes containing fluorescent substance were capable of translocating across the plasma membrane through endocytosis. With the conjugation of peptides and liposomal doxorubicin, the targeted drug delivery systems enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agent against human cancer xenografts by decreasing tumor angiogenesis and increasing cancer cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the peptide-mediated targeting liposomes improved the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug they delivered compared with nontargeting liposomes or free drugs. Our results indicate that the tumor-homing peptides can be used specifically target tumor vasculature and have the potential to improve the systemic treatment of patients with solid tumors.

Our results indicate that the tumor-homing peptides can be used specifically target tumor vasculature and have the potential to improve the systemic treatment of patients with solid tumors. One of the primary goals of a cancer treatment regimen is to deliver sufficient amounts of a drug to targeted tumors while minimizing damage to normal tissues. Most chemotherapeutic but cytotoxic agents enter the normal tissues in the body indiscriminately without much preference for tumor sites. The dose reaching the tumor may be as little as 5–10% of the dose accumulating in normal organs (1Bosslet K. Straub R. Blumrich M. Czech J. Gerken M. Sperker B. Kroemer H.K. Gesson J.P. Koch M. Monneret C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1195-1201PubMed Google Scholar). One reason is that interstitial fluid pressure in solid tumors is higher than in normal tissues, which leads to decreased transcapillary transport of chemotherapy or anticancer antibodies into tumor tissues (2Heldin C.H. Rubin K. Pietras K. Ostman A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 806-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar, 3Jain R.K. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3039-3051PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wu H.C. Chang D.K. Huang C.T. J. Cancer Mol. 2006; 2: 57-66Google Scholar). Cancer cells are therefore exposed to a less than effective concentration of the drug than normal cells, whereas the rest of the body must be subjected to increased toxicity and decreased effectiveness. This phenomenon often limits the dose of anti-cancer drugs that can be given to a patient without severe harm, resulting in incomplete tumor response, early disease relapse, and drug resistance. The development of drug delivery systems represents the ongoing effort to improve the selectivity and efficacy of antineoplastic drugs. Compared with conventional administration methods for chemotherapeutic agents, lipid- or polymer-based nanomedicines have the advantage of improving the pharmacological and therapeutic properties of cytotoxic drugs (5Vasey P.A. Kaye S.B. Morrison R. Twelves C. Wilson P. Duncan R. Thomson A.H. Murray L.S. Hilditch T.E. Murray T. Burtles S. Fraier D. Frigerio E. Cassidy J. Clin.

Most small molecule chemotherapeutic agents have a large volume of distribution upon intravenous administration (7Speth P.A. van Hoesel Q.G. Haanen C. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 1988; 15: 15-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and a narrow therapeutic window because of severe toxicity to normal tissues. By encapsulating drugs in drug delivery particles, such as liposomes, the volume of distribution is significantly reduced, and the concentration of drug within the tumor is increased (8Drummond D.C. Meyer O. Hong K. Kirpotin D.B. Papahadjopoulos D. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 691-743PubMed Google Scholar).

Many of these drug delivery systems have entered the clinic and have been shown to improve the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs they deliver (6Allen T.M. Cullis P.R. Science. 2004; 303: 1818-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (3751) Google Scholar). The growth of solid tumors is dependent on their capacity to induce the growth of blood vessels to supply them with oxygen and nutrients. However, the blood vessels of tumors present specific characteristics not observed in normal tissues, including extensive angiogenesis, leaky vascular architecture, impaired lymphatic drainage, and increased expression of permeability mediators on the cell surface (17Brigger I. Dubernet C. Couvreur P. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2002; 54: 631-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2488) Google Scholar, 18Wu H.C. Huang C.T. Chang D.K. J. Cancer Mol. 2008; 4: 37-45Google Scholar). These characteristics might be used to develop antiangiogenic target therapy for cancer. The hyperpermeability of tumor vasculature, for example, is a key factor for the success of liposome-delivered chemotherapy agents. The angiogenic tumor vasculature is estimated to have an average pore size of 100–600 nm (19Hashizume H. Baluk P. Morikawa S. McLean J.W. Thurston G. Roberge S. Jain R.K. McDonald D.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1363-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). These pores are significantly larger than the gaps found in normal endothelium, which are typically <6 nm wide (8Drummond D.C. Meyer O. Hong K. Kirpotin D.B. Papahadjopoulos D. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 691-743PubMed Google Scholar). After intravenous administration, liposomes with diameters of ∼65–75 nm (20Lee T.Y. Lin C.T. Kuo S.Y. Chang D.K. Wu H.C. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 10958-10965Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 21Lee T.Y. Wu H.C. Tseng Y.L. Lin C.T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8002-8008Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 22Lo A. Lin C.T. Wu H.C. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) are small enough to passively infiltrate tumor endothelium but large enough to be excluded from normal endothelium. In solid tumors, the permeability of the tissue vasculature increases to the point that particulate liposomes can extravasate and localize in the tissue interstitial space (19Hashizume H. Baluk P. Morikawa S. McLean J.W. Thurston G. Roberge S. Jain R.K. McDonald D.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1363-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). In addition, tumor tissues frequently lack effective lymphatic drainage (3Jain R.K. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3039-3051PubMed Google Scholar), which promotes liposome retention. The combination of these factors leads to an accumulation of the drug delivering liposome within the tumor. This passive targeting phenomenon has been called the “enhanced permeability and retention effect” (23Maeda H. Wu J. Sawa T. Matsumura Y. Hori K. J. Control Release. 2000; 65: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (5513) Google Scholar, 24Matsumura Y. Maeda H. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 6387-6392PubMed Google Scholar). The use of liposomes for passive targeting has some disadvantages. Normal organ uptake of liposomes leads to accumulation of the encapsulated drug in mononuclear phagocytic system cells in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, which may be toxic to these tissues. With the increased circulation time and confinement of the particulate liposomes, hematological toxicities, such as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and leucopenia, have also appeared (25Al-Batran S.E. Bischoff J. von Minckwitz G. Atmaca A. Kleeberg U. Meuthen I. Morack G. Lerbs W. Hecker D. Sehouli J. Knuth A. Jager E. Br. J.

Combinatorial libraries displayed on phage have been used successfully to discover cell surface-binding peptides and have thus become an excellent means of identifying tumor specific targeting ligands. Phage-displayed peptide libraries have been used to identify B-cell epitopes (29Scott J.K. Smith G.P. Science. 1990; 249: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar, 30Wu H.C. Jung M.Y.

Science. 1998; 279: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). Screening phage display libraries against specific target tissues is therefore a fast, direct method for identifying peptide sequences that might be used for drug targeting or gene delivery. By combining a drug delivery system with tumor-specific peptides, it is possible that targeting liposome can deliver as many as several thousand anticancer drug molecules to tumor cells via only a few targeting ligand molecules. In this in vivo study, we developed a method capable of selecting peptides that home to tumor tissues. We identified several targeting peptides able to bind specifically to tumor vasculature in surgical specimens of human cancer and xenografts. Coupling these peptides with a liposome containing the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin (Lipo-Dox; LD) enhanced the efficacy of the drug against several types of human cancer xenografts in SCID mice. Our results indicate that these targeting peptides can potentially play an important role in the development of more effective drug delivery systems. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—SAS (oral cancer), HCT116 (colon cancer), BT483 (breast cancer), Mahlavu (liver cancer), and PaCa-2 (pancreatic cancer) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 3.7 g of bicarbonate and 40 mg of kanomycin per liter, 2 mm l-glutamine, 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in a 10% CO2 incubator. H460 (lung cancer) and PC3 (prostate cancer) were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2g of bicarbonate and 40 mg of kanomycin per liter, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 (v/v). Preparation of HUVECs from umbilical vein was described in a previous report (20Lee T.Y. Lin C.T. Kuo S.Y. Chang D.K. Wu H.C. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 10958-10965Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In Vivo Phage Display Biopanning Procedures—SAS cells were injected subcutaneously into the dorsolateral flank of 4–6-week-old SCID mice to produce oral cancer xenografts. A phage-displayed peptide library (New England Biolabs, Inc.) was injected intravenously into the tail vein of SCID mice bearing size-matched SAS-derived tumors (∼500 mm3). After 8 min of phage circulation, the mice were perfused with 50 ml of PBS to wash unbound phage. The organs (such as lungs, heart, and brain) and tumor masses were removed, weighed, and washed with cold PBS. The organs and tumor samples were homogenized, and the phage particles were rescued by ER2738 bacteria (New England BioLabs). The phages were titered on agar plates in the presence of 1 mg/liter isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside/X-gal. The bound phages were amplified and titered in ER2738 culture. Recovered phages were subjected to four consecutive rounds of biopanning using oral cancer xenografts prepared as described above. The phages eluted from the fifth round were titered on LB/isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside/X-gal plates. The candidate tumor-homing phage clones were randomly selected and identified by in vivo homing experiments. DNA sequences of the selected phages and targeting peptide synthesis were described in our previous reports (20Lee T.Y. Lin C.T. Kuo S.Y. Chang D.K. Wu H.C. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 10958-10965Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 22Lo A. Lin C.T. Wu H.C. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In Vivo Homing Experiment and Phage Binding in Xenograft Tumor Vessels—The phage clones or control phage (insertless phage) were injected into the tail vein of tumor xenograft mice. The inputs for all of the individual phage-homing experiments were 1 × 109 plaque-forming units except for the IVO-8 in the BT483 animal model, which was 6 × 109 plaque-forming units. After perfusion, xenograft tumors and organs were removed and titered. In peptide competitive inhibition experiments, phage clones were co-injected with 100 μg of synthetic peptide. After injection of targeting or control phage clones, the organs and tumors were removed and divided into two parts. One part was titered by ER2738, and the other was embedded in optimal cutting temperature (Tissue-Tek). The optimal cutting temperature-embedded frozen tissues were sectioned at 5 μm and transferred to cold PBS buffer. The sections were fixed with acetone-methanol (1:1), washed with PBS, and immersed in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 1 h. Then the sections were incubated with rat anti-mouse CD31 (BD Pharmingen) and rabbit anti-rat antibody (Ab) (Stressgen) and immersed in rhodamine-labeled goat anti-rabbit Ab (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The slides were further incubated with mouse anti-M13 phage monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Amersham Biosciences), followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse Ab (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and immersed in DAPI (Vector). Finally, slides were washed and mounted with mounting medium (Vector). Slides were examined under a Leica confocal microscope (TCS-SP5-AOBS). Images were merged by Leica application suite advanced fluorescence software. Peptide Synthesis—Targeting peptides PIVO-8 (SNPFSKPYGLTV) and PIVO-24 (YPHYSLPGSSTL) and control peptide (TDSILRSYDGGG) (36Chang D.K. Lin C.T. Wu C.H. Wu H.C. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) were synthesized and purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography to >95% purity by Academia Sinica (Taipei, Taiwan). Detection of VEGF-stimulated HUVECs and Human Cancer Surgical Specimens by Tumor-homing Phages—HUVECs were plated and grown to ∼80% confluence on coverslips. The cells were pretreated with 20 ng/ml VEGF (B&D Systems) and 2 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (PEPROTECH, London, UK) for 48 h. The VEGF-stimulated HUVECs were washed with serum-free M199 plus 3% bovine serum albumin and incubated in blocking buffer for 30 min at 4 °C and then with phages at 4 °C for 1 h. They were washed and fixed with 3% formaldehyde for 10 min, followed by incubation with mouse anti-M13 mAb (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h and then fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse Ab (Jackson ImmunoResearch), followed by staining in Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The coverslips were finally washed and mounted. Images were merged by SimplePCI software (C-IMAGING). Tumor blood vessels on human cancer frozen sections were stained with ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA-1) (37Kalka C. Masuda H. Takahashi T. Kalka-Moll W.M. Silver M. Kearney M. Li T. Isner J.M. Asahara T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3422-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar). Sections were incubated in blocking buffer for 30 min and then treated with phages and biotinylated UEA-1 (Vector). Slides were washed and followed by incubation with mouse anti-M13 mAb plus fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce) for 1 h and then treated with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ab (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Slides were examined under a Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted microscope. Images were merged by MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). Preparation of Peptide-conjugated Liposomal Doxorubicin— Peptide-conjugated liposomes containing doxorubicin were prepared as described in previous studies (20Lee T.Y. Lin C.T. Kuo S.Y. Chang D.K. Wu H.C. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 10958-10965Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 22Lo A. Lin C.T. Wu H.C. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 36Chang D.K. Lin C.T. Wu C.H. Wu H.C. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, the peptide was coupled to N-hydroxysuccinimido-carboxyl-polyethylene glycol (Mr 3400)-derived distearoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine (NOF Corp.) in a 1:1.5 molar ratio. The reaction was completed and confirmed by quantitation of the remaining amino groups using trinitrobenzenesulfonate reagent (Sigma). Doxorubicin and vinorelbine were encapsulated in liposomes using a remote loading method at a concentration of 1 mg of drug/10 μmol of phospholipids. Peptidyl-PEG-derived distearoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine was transferred to preformed liposomes after co-incubation at a transition temperature of the lipid bilayer. There were 500 peptide molecules/liposome, as described previously (38Kirpotin D. Park J.W. Hong K. Zalipsky S. Li W.L. Carter P. Benz C.C. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Endocytosis of Liposome Conjugates with PIVO by HUVECs— Liposomes containing sulforhodamine B (SRB), a fluorescent dye, were prepared as described previously (21Lee T.Y. Wu H.C. Tseng Y.L. Lin C.T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8002-8008Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). HUVECs were incubated at 37 or 4 °C, with different formulation of liposomal SRB (LS), including PIVO-8-LS, PIVO-24-LS, control peptide-Lipo-SRS (CP-LS), and LS. After 5 min of incubation, the cells were washed with PBS, stained with DAPI, and then detected with confocal microscopy. Animal Models for Study of Ligand-targeted Therapy—Human cancer xenografts were established in SCID mice. Human cancer cells were injected subcutaneously into the dorsolateral flank in mice 4–6 weeks of age. Mice with size-matched tumors (tumor sizes of ∼100 mm3) were randomly assigned to different treatment groups and treated with PIVO-8-conjugated liposomal doxorubicin (PIVO-8-LD), PIVO-24-LD, LD, doxorubicin-free drug (FD), or equivalent volumes of saline through the tail vein. The dosage of doxorubicin was 1 mg/kg injected twice a week for 4 weeks (total doxorubicin dose of 8 mg/kg). Mouse body weight and tumor size were measured twice a week using calipers. The tumor volumes were calculated using the equation, length × (width)2 × 0.52. Animal care was carried out in accordance with the guidelines of Academia Sinica (Taipei, Taiwan). Pharmacokinetic and Biodistribution Studies—SCID mice bearing H460-derived tumor xenografts (∼300 mm3) were injected through the tail vein with various formulations of liposomal doxorubicin (PIVO-2-LD, PIVO-8-LD, PIVO-24-LD, and LD) and FD at a dose of 2 mg/kg. At selected time points, three mice in each group were anesthetized and sacrificed. Blood samples were collected through submaxillary punctures, and plasma samples were prepared. After perfusion, xenograft tumors and mouse organs were removed and homogenized. Procedures for isolating tumor cell nuclei and extracting nuclear doxorubicin were carried out as previously reported (39Laginha K.M. Verwoert S. Charrois G.J. Allen T.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 6944-6949Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 40Mayer L.D. Dougherty G. Harasym T.O. Bally M.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 280: 1406-1414PubMed Google Scholar). Total doxorubicin concentration was measured using a method described by Mayer et al. (40Mayer L.D. Dougherty G. Harasym T.O. Bally M.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 280: 1406-1414PubMed Google Scholar). Total doxorubicin was quantified using spectrofluorometry at λex 485/20 nm and λem 645/40 nm (Synergy HT multidetection microplate reader; BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT). To determine the presence of the drug localized in tumor tissues, doxorubicin autofluorescence was detected using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted microscope with a 100-watt HBO mercury light source equipped with a 546/12-nm excitation and a 590-nm emission filter set. Tissue sections were imaged with a FLUAR ×10/0.50 numerical aperture lens and captured with a Roper Scientific CoolSnap HQ CCD camera. Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) Staining—The frozen tumor tissue sections were incubated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling reaction mixture (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 1 h. The slides were counter-stained with mounting medium with DAPI. The slides were then visualized under a fluorescent microscope and analyzed with MetaMorph software. Vessel Staining—Tissues were removed from mice treated with anticancer drugs, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and embedded with paraffin. Blood vessels were detected by staining of Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) lectin conjugated to biotin (Vector). The biotinylated lectin was visualized with streptavidin-conjugated rhodamine (Pierce). Statistical Analyses—We analyzed the data of phage titer, tumor volume, body weight, and doxorubicin concentration using a two-sided unpaired Student's t test. A p value below 0.05 was considered significant for all analyses. All values are represented as mean ± S.D. Isolation of Tumor-homing Peptides by in Vivo Phage Display— To isolate tumor-homing phages from tumor tissues, we used a phage-displayed peptide library to treat the oral cancer (SAS)-bearing mice for five rounds of in vivo affinity selection (biopanning). The number of phages recovered from tumor tissues markedly increased in fourth and fifth rounds of biopanning, whereas the number of phages recovery from the lungs, which was used as a control organ, remained largely unaffected (Fig. 1A). Enriched phages from the fifth biopanning rounds were randomly selected and sequenced. Using GCG software, the sequences of 23 clones had displayed the same, related or non-related peptide sequence (Table 1). Searching the peptides displayed in our phage-homing system, we identified the IVO-2 phage displaying the same sequence as was found in one of our previous papers (20Lee T.Y. Lin C.T. Kuo S.Y. Chang D.K. Wu H.C. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 10958-10965Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The tumor homing potential of these selected phages was further characterized using in vivo homing assay by injecting them individually. Finally, we identified six novel phages (IVO-5, -8, -12, -24, -25, and -29) but not control phages that had higher homing ability in the tumor mass, exhibiting a concentration from 4.0- to 481-fold higher in the tumor mass than in normal organs, including the brain, lungs, and heart (Fig. 1B). Two phages, IVO-8 and -24, particularly showed higher tumor homing ability (Fig. 1B).TABLE 1Alignment of phage-displayed peptide sequences selected from lung cancer cell xenograftsTABLE 1Alignment of phage-displayed peptide sequences selected from lung cancer cell xenografts* Phage-displayed consensus amino acids are shown in boldface type† From 30 random selected phage clones, 23 phage-displayed peptide sequences were identified and aligned * Phage-displayed consensus amino acids are shown in boldface type † From 30 random selected phage clones, 23 phage-displayed peptide sequences were identified and aligned Specificity of Tumor-homing Phages in Solid Tumors—To test whether the target of tumor-homing phages may be universally expressed in the solid tumors, we examined the homing ability of IVO-8 and IVO-24 in six other types of human cancers, including human lung (H460), colon (HCT116), breast (BT483), prostate (PC3), pancreatic (PaCa-2), and liver (Mahlavu) cancer xenografts. We measured the titers of the phage in tumor masses and normal control organs (brain, heart, and lungs) (20Lee T.Y. Lin C.T. Kuo S.Y. Chang D.K. Wu H.C. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 10958-10965Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 22Lo A. Lin C.T. Wu H.C. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in all of these human cancer xenografts, these phages targeted tumor tissues but not normal organs like brain, lungs, or heart (Fig. 2A). Control phages without these targeting ligands had no such homing ability (Fig. 2A). To investigate the tumor targeting ability and specificity of the IVO phages in vivo, we injected phages into the tail vein of mice bearing H460-derived tumors. They were recovered after perfusion. IVO-8 was found to home specifically to tumor masses, and the tumor homing ability of IVO-8 was completely inhibited by cognate synthetic pep"
https://openalex.org/W2134069557,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis is thought to undergo transformation into its non-replicating persistence state under the influence of hypoxia or nitric oxide (NO). This transformation is thought to be mediated via two sensor histidine kinases, DosS and DosT, each of which contains two GAF domains that are responsible for detecting oxygen tension. In this study we determined the crystal structures of the first GAF domain (GAF-A) of DosS, which shows an interaction with a heme. A b-type heme was embedded in a hydrophobic cavity of the GAF-A domain and was roughly perpendicular to the β-sheet of the GAF domain. The heme iron was liganded by His-149 at the proximal heme axial position. The iron, in the oxidized form, was six-coordinated with a water molecule at the distal position. Upon reduction, the iron, in ferrous form, was five-coordinated, and when the GAF domain was exposed to atmospheric O2, the ferrous form was oxidized to generate the Met form rather than a ferrous O2-bound form. Because the heme is isolated inside the GAF domain, its accessibility is restricted. However, a defined hydrogen bond network found at the heme site could accelerate the electron transferability and would explain why DosS was unable to bind O2. Flavin nucleotides were shown to reduce the heme iron of DosS while NADH was unable to do so. These results suggest that DosS is a redox sensor and detects hypoxic conditions by its reduction.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis is still one of the most dreaded pathogens in existence, and one of the reasons for its success as a pathogen lies in its ability to persist for years within its host. One-third of the world population is estimated to carry M. tuberculosis in the dormant form (1Parrish N.M. Dick J.D. Bishai W.R. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), and while in this state, the pathogen is insensitive to most available chemotherapy. M. tuberculosis has been shown to undergo a metabolic transformation to its non-replicating persistence state under the influence of environmental stimuli such as hypoxia or nitric oxide (2Wayne L.G. Sohasjey C.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 139-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Recent studies have implied that CO is also an environmental trigger of mycobacterial persistence (3Kumar A. Deshane J.S. Crossman D.K. Bolisetty S. Yan B. Kramnik I. Agarwal A. Steyn A.J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18032-18039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 4Shiloh M.U. Manzanillo P. Cox J.S. Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 3: 277-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A two-component regulatory system mediates the genetic response to oxygen limitation and NO exposure in M. tuberculosis (5Sherman D.R. Voskuil M. Schnappinger D. Liao R. Harrell M.I. Schoolnik G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7534-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). The regulatory system consists of two sensor proteins, DosS and DosT and the cognate response regulator DosR (6Dasgupta N. Kapur V. Singh K.K. Das T.K. Sachdeva S. Jyothisri K. Tyagi J.S. Tuber Lung Dis. 2000; 80: 141-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 7Roberts D.M. Liao R.P. Wisedchaisri G. Hol W.G.J. Sherman D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23082-23087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). DosS and DosR are also known as DevS and DevR (6Dasgupta N. Kapur V. Singh K.K. Das T.K. Sachdeva S. Jyothisri K. Tyagi J.S. Tuber Lung Dis. 2000; 80: 141-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). DosS and DosT are histidine kinases that undergo autophosphorylation in response to an environmental change, and subsequently transduce the signal to DosR (a transcriptional regulator). DosS and DosT each contain two GAF domains at the N-terminal sensory domain and an HATPase (histidine kinase-like ATPase) domain at its C terminus (8Sardiwal S. Kendall S.L. Movahedzadeh F. Rison S.C.G. Stoker N.G. Djordjevic S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Hypoxia sensing by DosS or DosT is presumably carried out through the GAF domains. GAF domains are small molecule binding domains found in many proteins from various organisms and are known to play important roles as regulatory elements. Many GAF-containing proteins have two GAF domains in tandem and the two domains have separate functions, binding a cyclic nucleotide and dimerization (9Martinez S.E. Wu A.Y. Glavas N.A. Tang X. Turley S. Hol W.G.J. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13260-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 10Martinez S.E. Bruder S. Schultz A. Zheng N. Schultz J.E. Beavo J.A. Linder J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3082-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The two GAF domains in the M. tuberculosis DosS and DosT proteins are also arranged in tandem. The first GAF domain (GAF-A) is expected to contain a heme (8Sardiwal S. Kendall S.L. Movahedzadeh F. Rison S.C.G. Stoker N.G. Djordjevic S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) while the second GAF domain (GAF-B) is not suitable to bind a small ligand such as cyclic nucleotides (11Lee J. Cho H.Y. Cho H.J. Ko I. Park S.W. Baik H. Oh J. Eom C. Kim Y.M. Kang B.S. Oh J. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 6795-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus it is possible that DosS and DosT might be controlled through the binding of oxygen or NO at the GAF-A domain. Heme-based sensors are a diverse group of signal transduction proteins that respond to gases like O2 and CO (12Gilles-Gonzalez M. Gonzalez G. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and four distinct families of heme-based sensor proteins have been characterized. The bacterial oxygen sensors, FixL and HemAT have a PAS fold and a globin fold domain, respectively, to hold the heme in place (13Gong W. Hao B. Mansy S.S. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Chan M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15177-15182Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 14Zhang W. Philips Jr., G.N. Structure. 2003; 11: 1097-1110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The CO sensor CooA, belongs to the cAMP receptor protein family (15Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 879-880Google Scholar) while the NO sensor soluble guanylate cyclase, contains an H-NOX domain (16Pellicena P.

These proteins have quite distinct heme-binding protein scaffolds. Although the GAF domain is structurally similar to the PAS domain, its heme-binding mode differs from that of the PAS domain (17Podust L.M. Ioanoviciu A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 12523-12531Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).

A. 2007; 104: 11568-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Under low O2 concentrations, the heme exists in the deoxy form and DosS becomes active while atmospheric O2 concentrations inactivate DosS (20Sousa E.H. Tuckerman J.R. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 1708-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 21Kumar A. Toledo J.C. Patel R.P. Lancaster J.R. Steyn A.J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11568-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Recently the crystal structure of DosT GAF-A showed its direct interaction to O2 through the heme (17Podust L.M. Ioanoviciu A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 12523-12531Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, a detailed sensing mechanism for DosS based on a molecular structure has not yet been reported. There is controversy over whether DosS senses O2 directly or not. As a heme-based O2 sensor with a Kd value of 3 μm, DosS is active when it exists in an unliganded ferrous form, while its conversion to the oxy form results in its inactivation (20Sousa E.H. Tuckerman J.R. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 1708-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Alternatively, DosS can be thought of as a redox sensor (21Kumar A. Toledo J.C. Patel R.P. Lancaster J.R. Steyn A.J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11568-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). During aerobic respiration, DosS exists as the Met (Fe3+) form and under hypoxic conditions a reductant converts DosS to its reduced active form to induce the Dos regulon. In this study, the crystal structures of the GAF-A domain of DosS were determined showing a heme-binding structure. Structural and spectroscopic analyses of GAF-A upon reduction and oxidation suggested that DosS is a redox sensor, which undergoes conversion to an oxidized Met form with a six-coordinated iron upon exposure to atmospheric O2. Finally, it was found that flavin nucleotides were capable of reducing DosS. The results imply that DosS recognizes hypoxic conditions in a cell via the accumulation of a reducing agent. Gene Cloning and Protein Purification—The DosS gene (Rv3132c) was cloned from the chromosomal DNA of the M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain by polymerization chain reaction (PCR). The region encoding the GAF-A domain of DosS (Asp-63 to Lys-210) was amplified by PCR using primer sets carrying BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites (5′-CGGGATCCGGACCTGGAGGC-3′ and 5′-CCGGAATTCACTTAGCCTGCTGG-3′) and was cloned into the pHIS-parallel vector (22Sheffield P. Garrard S. Derewenda Z. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 15: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), a His-fusion protein expression vector containing a recombinant TEV protease cleavage site. The integrity of the insertion was verified by direct DNA sequencing. The expression of selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled DosS GAF-A was induced by 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in the E. coli strain B834 (Novagen) grown at the log phase (A600 = 0.6) with M9 medium containing 50 μg/ml SeMet at 37 °C. The cells were grown for an additional 24 h at 25 °C. For the native protein, the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3), carrying the recombinant plasmid, was grown in LB medium. The cells were grown for an additional 12 h at 18 °C after induction. The expressed protein was purified by affinity chromatography using an Ni-NTA column (Qiagen). The recombinant protein was digested using rTEV at 10 °C in the presence of 0.5 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After complete digestion, the hexa-His tag was removed using an Ni-NTA column. Gel filtration was performed with a Superdex G75 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and the fractions containing GAF-A protein were collected and concentrated using Centriprep YM10 (Millipore) for crystallization screening and spectroscopic analysis. The purified protein contained an additional five amino acids (GAMDP) at the N terminus arising from the cloning procedure. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystallization of the purified protein was initially performed with commercially available sparse-matrix screens (Hampton Research and Emerald Biostructures) using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at 21 °C. After optimization, the best crystals of SeMet-substituted DosS GAF-A were obtained under conditions of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 containing 17% (w/v) PEG 6000 and 0.2 m calcium acetate, with a protein concentration of 33 mg/ml. The crystal of the native protein was obtained from the drop containing 1.5 μl of 33 mg/ml protein and 1.5 μl of a reservoir solution, which contained 20% PEG4000 and 0.2 m calcium acetate in Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing 19% (w/v) PEG 6000 for the SeMet crystal, or 22% (w/v) PEG4000 for the native crystal, in addition to 0.2 m calcium acetate and 16% glycerol, prior to x-ray data diffraction collection. For the reduced form of the GAF-A, the crystals were obtained by the addition of 50 mm sodium dithionite to the crystallization conditions for the SeMet-substituted protein. The color of the crystal was red while that of the native crystal was dark brown. The crystal was soaked in the cryoprotectant containing 50 mm sodium dithionite before mounting on the beam. The air-oxidized crystal was obtained from the drop of the reduced form after maintenance under aerobic conditions. The color of the crystal turned to dark brown again. The crystal of the cyanide complex was obtained with a crystallization solution containing 20 mm potassium cyanide. After a fluorescence scan, single anomalous x-ray dispersion data for a SeMet crystal were collected at a wavelength corresponding to the Se absorption peak (0.9793 Å) using a Quantum 210 CCD detector on the beam line 4A at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory. The data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL2000 package (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38565) Google Scholar). The crystal belongs to the space group P212121 with the unit cell parameters of a = 35.8 Å, b = 87.0 Å, and c = 101.2 Å. The diffraction data for the native, reduced, air-oxidized, and cyanide complex forms were collected at a wavelength of 1.0000 Å. The unit cell parameters for the crystals are similar to those for the SeMet crystal.

Six Se atoms were identified in the asymmetric unit using SOLVE (24Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) and the initial phase had a figure of merit (FOM) of 0.279. Density modification and subsequent automated model building were done with RESOLVE (25Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar), increasing FOM to 0.635 with 61% (187 amino acid residues) of the residues built. The RESOLVE-built partial model was used as a guide to build the remainder of the protein manually into density-modified electron density maps with the program COOT (26Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23344) Google Scholar). Refinement with isotropic displacement parameters was performed with Refmac5 (27Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13865) Google Scholar) in the CCP4 suite (28CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project Number4)Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19762) Google Scholar). The Rwork and Rfree values of the refined structure were 0.213 and 0.278, respectively. The structures of the native, reduced, air-oxidized, and cyanide complexes were determined by the Molecular Replacement method with AMORE (29Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar) using the SeMet-substituted crystal structure as the template at resolutions of 1.6 Å, 1.6 Å, 1.4 Å, and 1.8 Å, respectively. The crystallographic data statistics are summarized in Table 1. The final models have been deposited in the worldwide Protein Data Bank (PDB) (30Berman H.M. Henrick K. Nakamura H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 980Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar) under the PDB ID code 2W3D, 2W3E, 2W3F, 2W3G, and 2W3H for the SeMet-substituted, oxidized native, reduced and its air-oxidized-, and cyanide-bound forms, respectively. Reduction and Oxidation—All of the absorption spectra were measured on a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Optizen 3220UV, Mecasys). 10 μm of DosS GAF-A in Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 buffer was subjected to wavelength scanning. Oxidation and reduction of the GAF-A domain was performed by the addition of 0.1 mm potassium ferricyanide and 1 mm sodium dithionite, respectively. For atmospheric O2 exposure, the cuvette, filled to two-thirds its volume with the reduced GAF-A solution, was inverted three times to ensure a thorough mixing with air bubbles. Reduction of GAF-A by NADH and FMN was examined by the addition of 100 μm of NADH or 8 μm of FMN in the presence of 1.5 units of Clostridium kluyveri diaphorase (Sigma), 10 mm KCl, and 100 μm of NADH for FMN reduction. The effects of electron carriers on the reduction of GAF-A in the presence of sodium dithionite were performed by addition of 2 μm of FMN, 2 μm of FAD, or 2 μm of menaquinone with 1 mm fresh sodium dithionite solution. A little excess dithionite was necessary to keep the reduced mixture from re-oxidizing because of the presence of diffused oxygen in the atmosphere. The Protein Fold—The crystal structure of the heme-bound GAF-A domain (residue Asp-63 to Arg-210) in M. tuberculosis DosS has been determined using single-wavelength anomalous diffraction of the SeMet-substituted protein for experimental phase determination. The crystal structures of the protein in its native met, reduced ferrous, air-oxidized, and cyanide-bound forms have also been solved (Table 1). GAF-A consists of one five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and four α-helices (Fig. 1A). The strand order of the sheet is 3-4-5-1-2 and two helices (α1 and α4) at the N terminus and C terminus are located on one side of the sheet. A peptide region connecting strands β2 to β3 at each end of the sheet contains two helices (α2 and α3) and crosses over to the other side of the sheet with a space existing between the sheet and a loop connecting the α2 and α3 helices. Two loops connecting strands β1 to β2, and strands β3 to β4, cover the space at the top and bottom positions completing the inside cavity. A heme group is tightly packed into the cavity. In the crystal structure, two GAF-A molecules (Mol-A and Mol-B) were found in an asymmetric unit. Two conformations of the molecules were almost identical except for a slight shift of helix α3 and the loop region between strands β1 and β2, indicating possible movement of these regions (supplemental Fig. S1A). The overall folding of the GAF-A domain of DosS is similar to the GAF-B domain of DevS from M. smegmatis, except for the absence of a strand in front of the α3-helix completing the six-stranded β-sheet, which is a key feature of a GAF-domain (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). The canonical GAF domain has a curved six-stranded β-sheet forming a half-barrel structure containing a cyclic nucleotide; however, the GAF-A sheet is five-stranded and rather flat (see Fig. 1A). The GAF-A domain consists of the sheet and two α-helices on each side of the sheet with the secondary structure order of α-β(2)-α(2)-β(3)-α. It is topologically similar to the PAS domain found in the E. coli protein Dos. Both GAF and PAS domains belong to the Profilin-like domain family, an α+β protein with α-β-α layers. The canonical GAF domain consists of α(2)-β(3)-α-β(3)-α while PAS has α-β(2)-α(2)-β(3) structure (supplemental Fig. S2, C and D). The GAF-A domain has a relatively long loop between strands β3 and β4 compared with the PAS domain while the canonical GAF domain has an α-helix in the corresponding loop. Although, topologically, the GAF-A domain of DosS is similar to a PAS domain, its overall folding is that of the canonical GAF domain. Heme Environment—In the crystal structure of the GAF-A domain, a b-type heme was found in the cavity between the β-sheet and the loop region covering the sheet, with liganding of the iron by H149 from a long loop connecting the β3- and β4-strands at the proximal position of the heme. The plane of the porphyrin rings is roughly perpendicular to the sheet (Fig. 1A). The heme binding in the GAF-A domain differs from that in the PAS domain, in which a heme is inserted into a crevice between the β-sheet and an α-helix. The plane of the porphyrin ring is parallel to the β-sheet (supplemental Fig. S2D). In the GAF-A domain of DosS, the heme group is embedded in a defined hydrophobic space surrounded by Ile-103, Ile-111, Phe-145, Pro-146, and Met-152 at the proximal position (at a distance of 3.5–3.6 Å to the heme) and residues Ala-85, Phe-98, Ile-121, Leu-114, Pro-115, Phe-155, and Tyr-171 at the distal position (Fig. 1B). Two heme propionate groups have hydrogen bonds to a loop connected to the α3 helix of GAF-A. One binds the main chain amide groups of Lys-116, Gly-117, and Leu-118 and the other bonds with the amide groups of Val-120 and the hydroxyl group of Ser-142. In the native crystal structure, the iron is six-coordinated with five nitrogen atoms from the porphyrin rings and the imidazole ring of His-149, and one oxygen atom from a water molecule at the distal position (Fig. 2A). The iron atoms are essentially coplanar with the four pyrrole nitrogen atoms, as expected for a six-coordinated low-spin iron. The bond distances from the iron to the imidazole ring of His-149, and the water molecule are 2.1–2.2 Å and 2.2–2.3 Å, respectively (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, in the SeMet-substituted GAF-A structure, the distance from the water molecule at the distal position to the iron is 2.8 Å (Fig. 3B). This rather long Fe-H2O distance has been observed in horseradish peroxidase isozyme C, with its Resonance Raman spectra showing a six-coordinated high-spin heme (31Smulevich G. Feis A. Indiani C. Becucci M. Marzocchi M.P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus two different heme iron environments would be available in the six-coordinated state of GAF-A. In the distal position of the heme, Tyr-171 from the β5 strand is located close to the iron, and the hydroxyl group of Tyr-171 has a hydrogen bond to the water molecule coordinating the iron (Fig. 1C).FIGURE 3Interactions of ligand and residues at the heme sites. The numbers next to the dashed lines indicate the distances (Å) between two atoms. The residues are water molecules at the heme sites of the native (A), selenomethionine-substituted (B), reduced by sodium dithionite (C) air-oxidized (D), and cyanide complex (E) forms of DosS GAF-A. Mol-A is shown in each of the asymmetric units of the five crystals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the heme group is buried in the hydrophobic cavity, the binding of a ligand at the heme would cause a rearrangement of the hydrogen bond network between water molecules and a few hydrophilic residues at the distal position. In the crystal structures, two or three water molecules are employed to connect the iron and a propionate group of the heme (Fig. 3). When two water molecules connect the iron and propionate group, the hydroxyl group of Tyr-171 has a hydrogen bond with the water molecule coordinating the iron (Fig. 3B). When three water molecules bridge the iron and the propionate group, Tyr-171 has a hydrogen bond with the second water molecule from the iron (Fig. 3A). It is worth paying attention to the two residues, Glu-87 and His-89 in the β1 strand. It is possible that the carboxyl group of Glu-87 could form a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Tyr-171 and the imidazole group of His-89 (Fig. 1C). Therefore, a hydrogen bonding network from the iron, in a hydrophobic environment, to the protein surface is completed via the water molecule coordinating the iron, Tyr-171, Glu-87, and His-89. When the iron transits between the ferric and ferrous states, this hydrogen bond network could be one possible pathway for electron transport. DosS Is Oxidized Rather Than Oxygenated upon Air Exposure— The oxidation status of DosS has been studied using UV-visible spectrum, EPR spectroscopy, and Resonance Raman spectroscopy (18Yukl E.T. Ioanoviciu A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Moënne-Loccoz P. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 9728-9736Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19Ioanoviciu A. Yukl E.T. Moënne-Loccoz P.

When UV-visible absorption spectra of the purified DosS GAF-A domain were measured, a typical Soret peak at 409 nm was observed with additional weak bands at 500 nm and 630 nm but no distinctive α and β bands (around 540 nm and 580 nm) (Fig. 4A). When GAF-A was treated with an excess of the oxidant Fe(CN6)3-, no changes were observed, thus confirming that the protein was in its ferric form. The reduction of GAF-A by sodium dithionite shifted the Soret peak to 430 nm and a new peak at 560 nm was observed (Fig. 4A). The ferrous form spectrum returned to that of the oxidized form upon treatment with ferricyanide. GAF-A was purified under aerobic conditions as an oxidized met form and did not bind an oxygen molecule as shown in the native crystal structure. The possibility that GAF-A could not bind an oxygen molecule because the heme was already in its ferric form cannot b"

In Tob-deficient mice, the incidence of liver tumors is higher than in wild-type mice. Furthermore, because the levels of tob expression are often repressed in human lung cancers, suppression of its expression is thought to contribute to tumor progression (13Yoshida Y. Nakamura T. Komoda M. Satoh H. Suzuki T. Tsuzuku J.K. Miyasaka T. Yoshida E.H. Umemori H. Kunisaki R.K. Tani K. Ishii S. Mori S. Suganuma M. Noda T. Yamamoto T. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1201-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The antiproliferative activities of the Tob/BTG family proteins are due to their association with target proteins in cells. For example, Tob associates with SMAD family proteins and acts as a negative regulator of SMAD signaling. In osteoblasts, this negative regulation occurs via association with SMAD 1, 5, 6, and 8 (14Yoshida Y. Tanaka S. Umemori H. Minowa O. Usui M. Ikematsu N. Hosoda E. Imamura T. Kuno J. Yamashita T.

Tob/BTG family proteins also bind to protein arginine methyltransferase, which regulates chromatin assembly by histone methylation (17Lin W.J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Male caf1-deficient mice are infertile because of a malfunction of the testicular somatic cells that leads to a defect in spermatogenesis (22Nakamura T. Yao R. Ogawa T. Suzuki T. Ito C. Tsunekawa N.

Genetic analysis of the nematode C. elegans also suggests that FOG3 (Tob orthologue) interacts with CCF1, the C. elegans homologue of Caf1, and that this interaction is essential for germ cells to initiate spermatogenesis (24Molin L. Pusieux A. Gene. 2005; 358: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Mouse and human Caf1 (mCaf1 and hCaf1) were found as homologues of yeast Pop2, a component of the CCR4-Not complex (18Bogdan J.A. Bogdan J.A. Adams-Burton C. Pedicord D.L. Sukovich D.A. Benfield P.A.

The primary structure of mammalian Caf1 is related to that of the ribonuclease D (RNase D) family, and all of the active site residues are well conserved (30Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Indeed, both mCaf1 and hCaf1 have deadenylase activity (31Denis C.L. Chen J. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2005; 11: 487-494Google Scholar). Although the relationship between cell cycle repression and poly(A) deadenylation is not well understood, mRNA degradation and synthesis are major events in maintaining the cell cycle (34Sachs A.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 413-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). The mRNAs in a eukaryotic cell have a wide range of half-lives. Degradation of mRNA is initiated by shortening of the poly(A) tail. Thereafter, the 5′-cap structure is removed and the remaining portion of the mRNA is rapidly degraded. The degradation of eukaryotic mRNAs is regulated precisely at each stage of the cell cycle. Tob was reported to associate with inducible poly(A)-binding protein (iPABP) and to abrogate the translation of interleukin-2 mRNA in vitro (35Okochi K. Suzuki T. Inoue J. Matsuda S. Yamamoto T. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Recent reports also showed that Tob and BTG2 interact with the CCR4-Not deadenylase complex using the Tob/BTG2 domain and the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC1) using the C-terminal tail and enhanced mRNA degradation (36Ezzeddine N.

EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1039-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To help elucidate the relationship between the antiproliferative activity of Tob and the degradation of the poly(A) tail, we determined the crystal structure of the Tob-hCaf1 complex. We found that hCaf1 has a structure similar to yeast Pop2 and human PARN of deadenylases, exonuclease I, and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I from Escherichia coli. In contrast, Tob has a novel structure. Specifically, Box A and Box B mediate the interaction between Tob and hCaf1. Cell growth assays using the wild and mutant proteins, together with the structural studies, revealed that the complex formation is crucial to cell growth inhibition. Bacterial Expression, Purification, and Crystallization of the TobN138-hCaf1 Complex—The antiproliferative region of human Tob comprising the N-terminal 138 residues (which is termed TobN138) and intact hCaf1 were co-expressed in E. coli. The gene of TobN138 was subcloned under a hexahistidine tag (His6) into the pHT1 plasmid derived from the pET-28 plasmid (Novagen), and the gene of hCaf1 was subcloned into the pET-11 plasmid (Novagen). These plasmids were co-transformed in E. coli BLR(DE3) pLysS for native proteins and methionine-auxotroph strain B834(DE3) for SeMet-labeled proteins. Cells were cultured to an A600 of 0.5 at 30 °C and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 18 h. After cell lysis, the protein was applied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen) and eluted with a gradient of 0-250 mm imidazole in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride. The HisTobN138-Caf1 complex was separated from the HisTobN138 monomer using a Superdex 75pg 26/60 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA. The heterodimer fraction was loaded onto a MonoQ HR10/10 anion exchange column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The heterodimer was eluted using a 160-ml linear gradient of 0 to 1 m NaCl. Fractions containing the heterodimer were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 30 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and then stored at -80 °C prior to crystallization. The purified protein complex was concentrated to 20 mg/ml and used for crystallization. In the sitting drop vapor diffusion method, 1 μl of 20 mg/ml HisTobN138-hCaf1 complex (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 30 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm DTT) was mixed with an equal volume of a reservoir solution (80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 160 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm DTT, 12% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, and 12% glycerol). The protein-reservoir mixture was incubated with 100 μl of reservoir at 20 °C and small crystals (<0.02 mm) were obtained after 24 h. To prepare the seed-stock, 1 μl of drop containing small crystals was diluted with 30 μl of the same reservoir solution and vortexed with a Teflon ball (Hampton) in a micro tube. 1 μl of the serial dilutions (10-1-10-8-fold) of seed stock was mixed with 1 μl of 20 mg/ml protein solution and incubated at 20 °C with 100 μl of reservoir. After 48 h at 20 °C, microseeding generated crystals of 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.1 mm. To prepare heavy atom derivatives, crystals were soaked at 20 °C in reservoir solutions without DTT and EDTA and containing either 1 mm neodymium chloride (for 20 h) or 0.1 mm methyl mercuric acetate (for 1 h). The crystal of the active form was prepared by soaking the crystal for 12 h at 20 °C in a reservoir solution without DTT or EDTA but with 1 mm MnCl2. Prior to data collection, crystals were cryoprotected by incubation for 5 min in a reservoir solution containing 15% polyethylene glycol 4000 and 30% glycerol. After soaking, the crystals were mounted on cryoloops (Hampton) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data Collection, Structural Analysis, and Refinement—All data for the hCaf1-HisTobN138 complex were collected using synchrotron radiation with a PX210 CCD detector (Oxford) at the Osaka University Beam Line BL44XU in Spring-8 at -173 °C. Diffraction data were processed using the MOSFLM program, and intensities were scaled using SCALA in the CCP4 program suite and HKL2000 programs. The structure was phased by multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) using the crystallography and NMR system (CNS) program. The heavy atom positions of the neodymium derivative were found by inspection of the Patterson map, and those of other derivatives were identified by Fourier difference methods. The initial MIR phase had a mean figure of merit of 0.50 at a resolution of 4.0 Å and was improved by density modification using the CNS program. A model was built into the MIR electron density maps using the TURBO-FRODO program. After rigid-body refinement and simulated annealing with CNS, several rounds of model building with TURBO-FRODO and refinement with CNS were carried out, with the refinement converging to a final R-factor of 22.3% (Rfree = 24.6%) for all data at a resolution of 2.5 Å. The crystal structure of the complex with manganese ions was determined by using the model of the structure without metal ions. By further refinement, a final R-factor of 22.7% (Rfree = 25.9%) for all data at a resolution of 2.7 Å was obtained.

The enzymatic reaction mixture (50 μl) consisted of 1 μm 5′-FITC RNA substrate, GST-hCaf1 (0.5 or 2 μm) in the presence or absence of HisTobN138 (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 μm), 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm metal ions (MgCl2, CaCl2, MnCl2, or CoCl2), and 1 mm DTT were incubated at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of formamide. 10 μl of the reaction mixtures were loaded onto an 8 m urea-20% polyacrylamide denaturing sequencing gel and separated by electrophoresis. The 5′-FITC RNA substrate bands were detected and quantified using either an FLA-2000 fluorescence imager or LAS-4000mini and accompanying software (Fujifilm). In Vitro Binding Assay—The genes for wild-type hCaf1 (hcaf1-wild) and the Lys-203c to Ala mutant of the interaction surface of hCaf1 (hcaf1-k203a) were cloned into pGEX-6P vector (GE Healthcare) for expression of GST-fused proteins. GST-hCaf1-wild and GST-hCaf1-K203A were expressed in E. coli DH5α and purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's protocols. For binding assays, 500 μl of either GST-hCaf1-wild or GST-hCaf1-K203A was loaded with HisTobN138 (final concentration 3.5 μm of each protein) on the gel-filtration column of Superdex 200 10/300GL (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl at 1 ml/min at 25 °C. The elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Construction of Plasmids for Affinity Precipitation and Growth Assay—The genes for tob and hcaf1 were constructed by fusing tob to flag and hcaf1 to strep-tag II, respectively, by an overlap extension PCR technique. The genes for eyfp-tob and ecfp-hcaf1 were also constructed by fusing eyfp, which was amplified from pEYFP plasmid (Clontech), to tob and ecfp, which was amplified from pEYFP plasmid (Clontech), to hcaf1, respectively. The obtained DNA fragments were cloned into the pENTR/SD/D-TOPO plasmid by TOPO reaction and were further transferred to the pLenti4/TO/V5-DEST expression plasmid by LR reaction (Invitrogen). The site-directed mutagenesis for the construction of tobn138, hcaf1-d40n, hcaf1-k203a, eyfp-tobn138, ecfp-hcaf1-d40n, and ecfphcaf1-k203a genes were performed by using an overlap extension PCR technique. These genes were also cloned into the pENTR/SD/D-TOPO plasmid and were further transferred to the pLenti4/TO/V5-DEST expression plasmid. Cell Culture—HEK-293, 293FT cells (human embryonic kidney cells), COS-1 cells, and NIH3T3 cells were maintained in growth medium (high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Melbourne, Australia)). Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Affinity Precipitation Assay—The expression plasmids were transfected into 293FT cells. After 48 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with CelLytic™ M (Sigma-Aldrich) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Nakarai). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation and incubated with either anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich) or Strep-Tactin-Sepharose fast flow gel (IBA). The gels were then washed with TBS (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl), and the precipitates were eluted by 3× FLAG peptide in TBS from the anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel or 2.5 mm d-desthiobiotin in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA from the Strep-Tactin-Sepharose fast flow gel. The eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride filters. After blocking by 3% bovine serum albumin or 5% skim milk, the filters were incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma-Aldrich) or HRP-conjugated anti-Strep-tag II antibodies (IBA) and treated with HRP substrate for detection by chemical luminescence (Millipore). Stable and Transient Transfection of Cells and Cell Growth Analysis—DNA fragments encoding FLAG-tagged Tob and FLAG-tagged hCaf1 proteins were cloned into the pMX-puro vector for retroviral production (39Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J. Lanier L.L. Gorman D.M. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 324-329PubMed Google Scholar, 40Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were infected with recombinant retrovirus and cultured in the presence of puromycin, and 1 × 103 cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes. Ten days after seeding, colonies were stained by using the Giemsa staining method. For the transfection analysis, we used the Nucleofector kit for cell lines (Amaxa Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol for transfection. Cells were trypsinized (attached cell lines) and resuspended in Nucleofector solution at a final concentration of 1 × 106 cells/100 μl. We then mixed 100 μl of cell suspension with 2-8 μg of plasmid DNA and transferred the nucleofection sample into a 0.2-cm certified cuvette (2.0 mm in width). The suspension was electroporated with an Amaxa Nucleofector apparatus using an appropriate program for each cell line. Immediately after electroporation, the transfected cells were resuspended in pre-warmed medium. The transfected cells were plated in 35-mm culture dishes. At 18 h after transfection, cells were then pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended at the appropriate cell concentrations in phosphate-buffered saline. Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a FACS Vantage SE flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The induced gene-expressed cells were collected on the basis of their enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP; Tob expression) and enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP; Caf1 expression) intensity. The dead cells and non-expressing cells were eliminated based on their intensity with EYFP, ECFP, and the vital dye propidium iodide (from Dojindo). To determine the effect of regulation by Tob or Caf-1 on cell proliferation, cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well and incubated for 90 h. To determine the rate of cell growth, cells were harvested by trypsinization and counted manually in triplicate using a hemocytometer and a flow cytometer for accuracy. Determination of the expression level of the proteins was performed by electrophoresis or immunostaining in glass coverslips following the above cell assays. For the selection of stably transfected cells, neomycin selection was applied with the addition of 300 μg/ml (COS-1) or 400 μg/ml (HEK-293, NIH3T3) G418 (Invitrogen) at 24 h after transfection and maintained for 2 weeks. Neomycin-resistant colonies were picked manually and cultured in the presence of G418. As described under “Results” and “Discussion,” the expressions of many wild-type or mutated forms of Tob/Caf1 also resulted in the expression of almost equal levels of proteins during the cell growth analysis. Structure of the Tob-hCaf1 Complex—To elucidate how Tob recognizes hCaf1 in the growth repression complex, we determined the crystal structure of the Tob-hCaf1 complex. First, we tried to produce recombinant intact Tob in E. coli. However, it was difficult to purify intact Tob because of degradation. As both Box A and Box B of BTG/Tob family proteins are sufficient to associate with hCaf1, we next coexpressed an antiproliferative region of human Tob comprising the N-terminal 138 residues (which we refer to as TobN138) and intact hCaf1 in E. coli BLR(DE3). The crystal of the TobN138-hCaf1 complex in the absence of metal ions contained one heterodimer molecule in an asymmetric unit. We determined the crystal structure of TobN138-hCaf1 at 2.5 Å resolution by MIR. The current refinement model has an R-factor of 22.3% and an Rfree of 24.6% (Table 1; PDB entry 2d5r). We constructed an atomic model for the TobN138 region from residue 1 to 115 and for the hCaf1 region from residue 11 to 262 (Fig. 1A), other regions were disordered in the electron density map. We found that TobN138 is folded into an α/β structure with an antiparallel β-sheet consisting of four β-strands supported by a helix bundle containing two long helices and three short helices. Further, hCaf1 is folded into an α/β structure with an open, twisted mixed β-sheet of six β-strands surrounded by 14 α-helices. The largest association surface between TobN138 and hCaf1 is composed of helix α3t, strands β1t, β2t, and β3t, and loops L2t, L3t, L4t, L7t, and L8t of TobN138 along with helices α10c and α14c and loops L13c, L15c, and L16c of hCaf1 (Fig. 1A). The buried surface area between TobN138 and hCaf1 is 1511 Å2. Interestingly, Box A (Fig. 1A, in red) and Box B (in blue) of Tob mediate the association with hCaf1. The β-sheets containing β1t, β2t, and β3t are supported by two long α-helices (α1t and α2t). These helices contain hydrophobic residues that are well conserved in the Tob/BTG family (Ile-5t, Phe-28t, Leu-32t, and Leu-36t) and are located at the hydrophobic interface with the β-sheet that presents Box B to hCaf1. The electrostatic surface potential of TobN138-hCaf1 complex reveals the presence of an acidic pocket, which was identified as the active site (Fig. 1, B and C). Structure-based Sequence Alignment of TobN138 and hCaf1 by DALI Search—To help predict some of the physiological functions of the TobN138-hCaf1 complex, we applied the coordinate data of hCaf1 and TobN138 to the DALI server.

https://openalex.org/W2052614354,"Current tools for the diagnosis of tuberculosis pleural effusions are sub-optimal. Data about the value of new diagnostic technologies are limited, particularly, in high burden settings. Preliminary case control studies have identified IFN-gamma-inducible-10 kDa protein (IP-10) as a promising diagnostic marker; however, its diagnostic utility in a day-to-day clinical setting is unclear. Detection of LAM antigen has not previously been evaluated in pleural fluid.We investigated the comparative diagnostic utility of established (adenosine deaminase [ADA]), more recent (standardized nucleic-acid-amplification-test [NAAT]) and newer technologies (a standardized LAM mycobacterial antigen-detection assay and IP-10 levels) for the evaluation of pleural effusions in 78 consecutively recruited South African tuberculosis suspects. All consenting participants underwent pleural biopsy unless contra-indicated or refused. The reference standard comprised culture positivity for M. tuberculosis or histology suggestive of tuberculosis.Of 74 evaluable subjects 48, 7 and 19 had definite, probable and non-TB, respectively. IP-10 levels were significantly higher in TB vs non-TB participants (p<0.0001). The respective outcomes [sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV %] for the different diagnostic modalities were: ADA at the 30 IU/L cut-point [96; 69; 90; 85], NAAT [6; 93; 67; 28], IP-10 at the 28,170 pg/ml ROC-derived cut-point [80; 82; 91; 64], and IP-10 at the 4035 pg/ml cut-point [100; 53; 83; 100]. Thus IP-10, using the ROC-derived cut-point, missed approximately 20% of TB cases and mis-diagnosed approximately 20% of non-TB cases. By contrast, when a lower cut-point was used a negative test excluded TB. The NAAT had a poor sensitivity but high specificity. LAM antigen-detection was not diagnostically useful.Although IP-10, like ADA, has sub-optimal specificity, it may be a clinically useful rule-out test for tuberculous pleural effusions. Larger multi-centric studies are now required to confirm our findings."
https://openalex.org/W2140594545,"Proper expression of the replication licensing factor Cdt1 is primarily regulated post-translationally by ubiquitylation and proteasome degradation. In a screen to identify novel non-histone targets of histone deacetylases (HDACs), we found Cdt1 as a binding partner for HDAC11. Cdt1 associates specifically and directly with HDAC11. We show that Cdt1 undergoes acetylation and is reversibly deacetylated by HDAC11. In vitro, Cdt1 can be acetylated at its N terminus by the lysine acetyltransferases KAT2B and KAT3B. Acetylation protects Cdt1 from ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. These results extend the list of non-histone acetylated proteins to include a critical DNA replication factor and provide an additional level of complexity to the regulation of Cdt1. Proper expression of the replication licensing factor Cdt1 is primarily regulated post-translationally by ubiquitylation and proteasome degradation.

These results extend the list of non-histone acetylated proteins to include a critical DNA replication factor and provide an additional level of complexity to the regulation of Cdt1. To maintain genomic integrity, DNA replication must be tightly controlled to ensure that each portion of the genome replicates once and only once per cell cycle (reviewed in Ref. 1.Machida Y.J. Hamlin J.L. Dutta A. Cell. 2005; 123: 13-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Replication licensing begins by the formation of the prereplication complex at multiple potential origins of replication. This is established sequentially, with the origin recognition complex (ORC) 2The abbreviations used are: ORC, origin recognition complex; MCM, minichromosome maintenance; HDAC, histone deacetylase, KAT, lysine acetyltransferase; TSA, trichostatin A; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin. proteins binding first, followed by the recruitment of Cdc6 and Cdt1, which in turn recruit the MCM2–7 proteins. MCM proteins act as the replicative helicase. The licensed replication origins are activated by cyclin-dependent kinases at the start of S phase. Licensing occurs throughout the cell cycle once S phase is complete. Cdt1 levels fluctuate throughout the cell cycle. It is destabilized at G1/S transition, and then levels begin to climb again upon S phase completion. To prevent licensing at inappropriate times, two separate processes regulate the inactivation or destruction of Cdt1. First, geminin negatively regulates Cdt1 function by prevention of the association of Cdt1 with MCM2–7 via steric hindrance (2.Saxena S. Yuan P. Dhar S.K. Senga T. Takeda D. Robinson H. Kornbluth S. Swaminathan K. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 245-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Interestingly, geminin also positively regulates Cdt1 by preventing its ubiquitylation, perhaps by prevention of its interaction with an E3 ligase. This allows Cdt1 to accumulate in G2 and M phases, to ensure adequate pools of Cdt1 to license the next cycle of replication (3.Ballabeni A. Melixetian M. Zamponi R. Masiero L. Marinoni F. Helin K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3122-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The ratio of geminin to Cdt1 likely determines whether geminin positively or negatively regulates Cdt1 (4.Lutzmann M. Maiorano D. Mechali M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5764-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Second, Cdt1 is targeted for proteolysis by two distinct ubiquitin E3 ligases: the SCF-Skp2 complex and the DDB1-Cul4 complex (5.Nishitani H. Sugimoto N. Roukos V. Nakanishi Y. Saijo M. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Nakayama K.I. Nakayama K. Fujita M. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1126-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by cyclin A/Cdk2 promotes interaction of Cdt1 with Skp2, leading to Cdt1 degradation during S phase (6.Li X. Zhao Q. Liao R. Sun P. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30854-30858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 7.Sugimoto N. Tatsumi Y. Tsurumi T. Matsukage A. Kiyono T. Nishitani H. Fujita M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 23416-23423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, DDB1-Cul4 utilizes proliferating cell nuclear antigen as a binding platform to contact Cdt1, targeting the destruction of Cdt1 in S phase or following DNA damage (9.Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 10.Senga T. Sivaprasad U. Zhu W. Park J.H. Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6246-6252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Ubiquitylation by either of these E3 ligases promotes degradation of Cdt1 by the proteasome. Ubiquitylation occurs primarily (but not exclusively) on the ϵ-amino group of lysine residues. Another prominent post-translational modification that occurs on that residue is acetylation. Acetylation and, correspondingly, deacetylation can modulate the function and activity of a variety of proteins (see Ref. 11.Glozak M.A. Sengupta N. Zhang X. Seto E. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 363: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar for review). Here, we report that Cdt1 physically interacts with HDAC11, a class IV histone deacetylase (12.Gao L. Cueto M.A. Asselbergs F. Atadja P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25748-25755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 13.Gregoretti I.V. Lee Y.M. Goodson H.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar), as well as with several lysine acetyltransferases (KATs). We show that Cdt1 is an acetylated protein and further show that acetylation protects Cdt1 from ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This study uncovers yet another layer of complexity to the regulation of the critical licensing factor Cdt1. Plasmids—HDAC11 (IMAGE clone 3906049) was obtained from Open Biosystems. Cdt1 cDNA, a kind gift of A. Dutta, has been described previously (14.Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A. Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). cDNAs and corresponding deletions were shuttled into appropriate expression vectors by restriction digestion or PCR and verified by sequencing. Plasmids were purified by Qiagen maxipreps. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated calf serum and antibiotics. Trichostatin A (TSA), MG132, and curcumin were obtained from Sigma. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). To prepare cell lines stably overexpressing HDAC11, FLAG-tagged HDAC11 was transfected into HeLa cells. Colonies were selected in 500 μg/ml G418 and verified to express HDAC11 by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibodies. Protein Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared by resuspension of the cell pellet in phosphate-buffered saline lysis buffer containing 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Extracts were quantified by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitations of overexpressed proteins were carried out using anti-FLAG-agarose (Sigma), anti-Myc-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-HA-agarose (Sigma). Endogenous protein immunoprecipitations were performed with the indicated antibodies and protein A-agarose (Invitrogen). Following immunoprecipitation, beads were washed five times with lysis buffer, resuspended in sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to Immobilon C (GE Bioscience). Blots were blocked and then incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies, the blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico or Femto, Pierce). Inputs, where indicated, were 5–10% of the amount used for immunoprecipitation. Expression levels were quantified using ImageQuant. The following antibodies were used: FLAG, actin, and tubulin (Sigma); Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); HA (Covance); Cdt1 (Abcam and Santa Cruz Biotechnology); HDAC11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); acetyllysine (Cell Signaling and Upstate); and ubiquitin (Upstate). Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pulldown—GST, GST-HDAC11, and GST-geminin were expressed in BL21 cells. Bacterial lysates were prepared and bound to glutathione beads at 4 °C. Recombinant His6-tagged full-length Cdt1 (purified from BL21 cells by nickel affinity chromatography and eluted with imidazole) was incubated with various GST constructs bound to beads in binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 350 mm NaCl and 0.2% Nonidet P-40). Binding reactions were carried out at room temperature for 90 min. Samples were washed five times with binding buffer, resuspended in sample buffer, and processed for Western blotting. In Vitro KAT Assay—KAT assays were performed in 1× KAT buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm sodium butyrate and 1× protease inhibitor mixture), containing [14C]acetyl-CoA. The His6-tagged Cdt1 substrates (expressed via pET vectors) were purified from bacteria by nickel chromatography and eluted with imidazole. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 1 h at 30 °C and then resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to visualize the substrates and ensure equivalent loading. After destaining, gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid and 40% methanol and soaked first in EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and then in cold water. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film with intensifying screens. Recombinant KAT2B (PCAF) and KAT3B (p300) were obtained from Upstate. 0.5 μg of rKAT2B (amino acids 352–832) or 2.5 μg of rKAT3B (amino acids 1066–1707) were used in each reaction. KATs were also produced by overexpression of the appropriate tagged constructs in 293T cells and then immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer and two times with 1× KAT buffer. KAT reactions were performed directly on the beads. In Vivo Ubiquitylation Assay—Cells were transfected with His-ubiquitin and harvested after 20–24 h. 20 μm MG132 was added for the final 4 h of incubation where indicated. A whole cell extract was prepared from 20% of the cell pellet for a direct Western blot. 80% of the cell pellet was lysed under denaturing conditions using Buffer A (6 m guanidinium HCl, 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm imidazole) and then incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose beads (Qiagen) while rotating at room temperature overnight. Beads were washed sequentially with Buffer A, Buffer B (8 m urea, 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), Buffer C (8 m urea, 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.3, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.2% Triton X-100, and Buffer C. Samples were eluted with continuous shaking in elution buffer (200 mm imidazole, 150 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.7, 30% glycerol, 0.72 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% SDS). Following the addition of 6× loading dye, the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and processed for Western blotting. Cdt1 Copurifies with HDAC11—HDAC11 is the most recently described HDAC and one of the most poorly characterized. To identify potential non-histone targets of HDAC11, we made use of the fact that HDACs often physically interact with their substrates. To this end, we overexpressed HA-HDAC11-FLAG in HeLa cells. Whole cell extracts were purified sequentially on a FLAG column, and then FLAG eluates were purified on an HA column. Specific HDAC11-interacting proteins were excised from the stained polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by mass spectrometry. From this analysis, we obtained seven unique peptides, encompassing 100 amino acids, from the DNA replication licensing factor Cdt1 (Fig. 1A). We also identified several other HDAC11-interacting proteins that are currently under investigation. Cdt1 Interacts Specifically and Directly with HDAC11—To confirm the interaction between Cdt1 and HDAC11, we overexpressed Myc-tagged Cdt1 and FLAG-tagged HDAC11 in 293T cells. FLAG-HDAC11 co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-Cdt1 (Fig. 1B, lane 4). We also prepared N- and C-terminal deletions of Cdt1. Removal of either the first 59 amino acids (lane 8) or the last 120 amino acids (lane 6) had no effect on the ability of Cdt1 to bind to HDAC11. This indicates that the central portion of Cdt1 binds to HDAC11. HDAC11 is the smallest member of the human HDAC family, containing only 347 amino acids. As such, the conserved HDAC domain (amino acids 17–321) comprises the majority of the protein. Deletion of any part of HDAC11 greatly impairs the ability of HDAC11 to bind to Cdt1 (Fig. 1C, top two panels, compare lane 2 with lanes 3–5). This suggests that the N and C termini, which are unique to HDAC11, play an important role in its interaction with Cdt1. To explore the specificity of the HDAC11-Cdt1 interaction, we overexpressed a panel of FLAG-tagged HDACs in HeLa cells. We examined HDAC1 and HDAC2 because Cdt1 is a nuclear protein, and both HDAC1 and HDAC2 are primarily nuclear. Also, HDAC11 has been shown to localize to the nucleus (12.Gao L. Cueto M.A. Asselbergs F. Atadja P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25748-25755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Following immunoprecipitation with anti-Cdt1, we could coprecipitate FLAG-HDAC11 (Fig. 1D, lane 7), but not FLAG-HDAC1 or FLAG-HDAC2. FLAG-HDAC3 also did not bind Cdt1 (data not shown). FLAG-HDAC1 and FLAG-HDAC11 were expressed at similar levels, yet only HDAC11 could bind to Cdt1. This suggests that Cdt1 interacts specifically with HDAC11, but not with other HDACs. To show that endogenous HDAC11 and Cdt1 could also interact, we used anti-Cdt1 or normal rabbit IgG to immunoprecipitate HeLa whole cell extracts. Western blotting with an antibody directed against HDAC11 shows that HDAC11 is present in the Cdt1 immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1E, lane 2), but not in the IgG immunoprecipitate (lane 1). This confirms that physiologically relevant amounts of Cdt1 and HDAC11 can interact in HeLa cells. Finally, to prove that HDAC11 and Cdt1 directly interact, in the absence of any other proteins, we performed GST pulldown assays. Bacterially expressed GST-HDAC11 could pull down bacterially expressed purified His-Cdt1 (Fig. 1F, lane 6). GST alone did not interact with His-Cdt1 (lane 4). GST-geminin, a known binding partner for Cdt1, was used as a positive control (lane 8). Cdt1 Is an Acetylated Protein—Because we found that Cdt1 could interact with HDAC11, we next wanted to determine whether Cdt1 was acetylated. To do this, we overexpressed Myc-Cdt1 in HeLa cells. Immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc beads followed by blotting with an anti-acetyllysine antibody showed that Myc-Cdt1 was acetylated (Fig. 2A, lane 2). The intensity of the acetylated band was severely diminished to background levels by cotransfection with FLAG-HDAC11 (lane 3), suggesting that HDAC11 could deacetylate Cdt1. To determine whether endogenous Cdt1 was also acetylated, we used antibodies to Cdt1 for immunoprecipitation from HeLa cell extracts. Western blotting with anti-acetyllysine shows a weak band corresponding to acetylated Cdt1 (Fig. 2B, lane 1). Treatment of the cells with the HDAC inhibitor TSA enhances the acetylation level of Cdt1 without affecting the expression of endogenous Cdt1 (lane 2). As a final confirmation, immunoprecipitation with an anti-acetyllysine antibody followed by blotting for Cdt1 revealed a Cdt1-specific band (Fig. 2C, lane 3). The intensity of this band was also enhanced by treatment with TSA (lane 4). Taken together, these results strongly indicate that Cdt1 is an acetylated protein. Lysine Acetyltransferases Associate with Cdt1—Having shown that Cdt1 is an acetylated protein and that it associates with HDAC11, we next determined whether it could associate with KATs. We examined several prototypic KATs from different families. This included KAT2B (PCAF), KAT3B (p300), and KAT7 (HBO1). KAT7 was of particular interest because it was identified as binding to the ORC (15.Iizuka M. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23027-23034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), where Cdt1 also plays its critical role in the recruitment of MCM proteins. Myc-Cdt1 was cotransfected with each of the indicated tagged KATs, in the presence or absence of TSA. Cdt1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibodies, and immunoprecipitated proteins were immunoblotted with anti-FLAG (Fig. 3A) or anti-HA (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 3, each of the overexpressed KATs could be immunoprecipitated with Myc-Cdt1. In all cases, TSA treatment appeared to enhance the interaction; however, this was likely due to the fact that TSA treatment enhances the overall expression levels of both Cdt1 and KATs. KAT2B and KAT3B Acetylate Cdt1—Having determined that all three tested KATs could interact with Cdt1, we next determined which KAT was responsible for acetylating Cdt1. To do this, we performed in vitro KAT assays, using bacterially purified His-tagged Cdt1 as the substrate. Recombinant KAT2B could acetylate Cdt1, but recombinant KAT3B could not (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 4 and 6). We next used immunoprecipitates of FLAG-KAT2B, FLAG-KAT7, or HA-KAT3B in the in vitro KAT assay to acetylate His-Cdt1. Surprisingly, FLAG-KAT2B (Fig. 4B, lane 6) and HA-KAT3B (lane 11), but not FLAG-KAT7 (lane 4), could acetylate Cdt1. Immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with vector alone also could not acetylate Cdt1 (lanes 2 and 9). This indicates that KAT2B and KAT3B acetylate Cdt1, but KAT7 does not, despite the localization of KAT7 to the ORC described previously (15.Iizuka M. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23027-23034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 16.Miotto B. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The target of KAT7 at the ORC is likely histones. The discrepancy in the ability of the overexpressed KAT3B to acetylate Cdt1 (Fig. 4B, lane 11) versus the inability of the recombinant KAT3B (Fig. 4A, lane 6) to do so is likely due to the different portions of KAT3B expressed in each case. The noncatalytic domains of KAT3B may be required for protein-protein interaction or to affect secondary structure. Differing results dependent on the portion of KAT3B used have also been shown for the acetylation of MyoD (17.Polesskaya A. Harel-Bellan A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44502-44503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is also formally a possibility that immunoprecipitation of KAT3B also brought down some KAT2B that is responsible for the acetylation we observe. Cdt1 Is Acetylated at the N Terminus—To delineate which of the 23 lysines in Cdt1 acetylation occurred, we performed in vitro KAT assays using Cdt1 deletions (Fig. 4C). Deletion of amino acids 1–59 causes a dramatic decrease in the amount of acetylation observed (compare lanes 2 and 4). Removal of an additional 44 amino acids did not have any further effect (lane 6). This suggests that the N terminus contains the major sites of acetylation. Two potential acetylated lysines reside within the first 59 amino acids: Lys24 and Lys49. Mutation of both lysines to arginines caused a significant decrease in acetylation observed in the in vitro KAT assay using either KAT2B (Fig. 4D, compare lanes 4 and 6) or KAT3B (compare lanes 11 and 12). It should be noted that both of these sites are neighbored by another basic residue three or four amino acids downstream of the acetylation site, which is typical of KAT3B substrates (18.Thompson P.R. Kurooka H. Nakatani Y. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33721-33729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). KAT2B prefers a basic or aromatic residue three amino acids downstream of the acetylation site, which only Lys49 possesses (19.Zeng L. Zhang Q. Gerona-Navarro G. Moshkina N. Zhou M.M. Structure. 2008; 16: 643-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Acetylation Protects Cdt1 from Ubiquitylation and Subsequent Proteasomal Degradation—Cdt1 levels are regulated post-translationally by ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasome degradation (5.Nishitani H. Sugimoto N. Roukos V. Nakanishi Y. Saijo M. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Nakayama K.I. Nakayama K. Fujita M. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1126-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). As such, treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 would be predicted to increase Cdt1 protein levels. Indeed, addition of MG132 slightly increases the amount of Myc-Cdt1 protein in the absence of overexpressed acetyltransferase or deacetylase (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 1 and 2, and see quantification in right panel). Cotransfection of FLAG-KAT2B enhances the levels of Myc-Cdt1 (compare lanes 1 and 3, also compare lanes 1 and 3 in Fig. 3A). However, there is minimal further increase in Cdt1 levels upon the addition of MG132 (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 3 and 4). This indicates that Cdt1, acetylated by KAT2B, is already protected from proteasomal degradation. As such, addition of a proteasome inhibitor has little or no effect on Cdt1 protein levels. In contrast, treatment with MG132 enhances the level of Cdt1 considerably when coexpressed with HDAC11. This suggests that the deacetylated form of Cdt1 is prone to proteasomal degradation, and treatment with a proteasome inhibitor prevents degradation, leading to enhanced protein levels (lanes 5 and 6). Consistent with the idea that acetylation protects Cdt1 from degradation, overexpression of HA-KAT3B enhances wild-type Myc-Cdt1 levels (Fig. 5B, lanes 1 and 2). However, KAT3B does not affect the overall levels of the Myc-Cdt1(K24R/K49R) mutant (Myc-Cdt1RR, lanes 5 and 6), which showed greatly diminished acetylation in the in vitro KAT assay (Fig. 4D). To demonstrate specificity, we also mutated three irrelevant lysines (Lys141, Lys166, and Lys189) to arginines. Levels of this Myc-Cdt1RRR mutant were also enhanced upon cotransfection of HA-KAT3B (Fig. 5B, compare lanes 3 and 4). This supports the idea that acetylation at Lys24 and Lys49 can protect Cdt1 from proteasomal degradation. To show that acetylation can protect endogenous Cdt1 from degradation, we made use of the KAT3 inhibitor curcumin (20.Balasubramanyam K. Varier R.A. Altaf M. Swaminathan V. Siddappa N.B. Ranga U. Kundu T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51163-51171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Treatment of HeLa cells with 100 μm curcumin diminished the amount of Cdt1 protein in a time-dependent manner, when compared with the untreated cells (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, treatment with TSA increases the amount of chromatin-bound Cdt1 (data not shown). Taken together, these data provide a compelling argument that acetylation of Cdt1 protects it from proteasomal degradation. Loss of acetylation, by pharmacologic inhibition of KAT or by overexpression of HDAC11, leads to loss of Cdt1 protein. Acetylation Regulates Ubiquitylation of Cdt1—Having shown that acetylation modulates Cdt1 protein levels, we next examined its effect on ubiquitylation. To directly observe the effect of acetylation on ubiquitylation, we performed in vivo ubiquitylation assays by transfecting His-ubiquitin into HeLa cells and then performed nickel pulldowns under denaturing conditions to isolate the ubiquitylated proteins. This was followed by Western blotting, using antibodies against Cdt1 to identify the differently ubiquitylated forms of endogenous Cdt1. In the absence of MG132, ubiquitylated Cdt1 is not detected, likely because of the fact that it is rapidly degraded by the proteasome (Fig. 6A, lanes 1 and 2). However, in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, a ladder corresponding to the various polyubiquitylated forms of Cdt1 is clearly evident (lane 3). MG132 treatment correspondingly causes a small increase (1.5-fold) in the amount of endogenous Cdt1 as well (compare lanes 1 and 3, bottom panel). Treatment with TSA abrogates the level of endogenous Cdt1 ubiquitylation as demonstrated by decreased laddering (lane 4). When normalized for the amount of Cdt1 present, TSA caused a 91% reduction in laddering (compare lanes 3 and 4, upper panel). To determine the specific effect of HDAC11 on Cdt1 ubiquitylation, we transfected 293T cells with Myc-Cdt1 in the presence or absence of FLAG-HDAC11. Transient overexpression of HDAC11 causes a 2-fold increase in the amount of ubiquitylated Myc-Cdt1 (Fig. 6B, compare lanes 4 and 6). In addition, the overall amount of polyubiquitylation as detected with an anti-ubiquitin antibody similarly increased. Correspondingly, overexpression of FLAG-HDAC11 also decreased by ∼50% the amount of Myc-Cdt1 detected in the whole cell extract (compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 5 and 6). These data support the idea that deacetylation of Cdt1 by HDAC11 leads to ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation. To further explore the relationship between HDAC11 and Cdt1 ubiquitylation, we produced HeLa cell lines stably expressing FLAG-HDAC11. Consistent with the previous results, stable overexpression of HDAC11 enhanced endogenous Cdt1 ubiquitylation (Fig. 6C, compare lanes 3 and 5 with lane 1). This increase in ubiquitylation correlates with the amount of HDAC11 expressed. TSA treatment reduced the amount of laddering in all cases (lanes 2, 4, and 6). However, this reduction was more pronounced in the HDAC11-overexpressing cells, where laddering was reduced 27-fold for clone 4 and 19-fold for clone 13, as compared with the parental HeLa cells, where laddering was reduced ∼4-fold. Stable overexpression of HDAC11 also diminished the overall levels of Cdt1 in an HDAC11 dose-dependent manner, but TSA treatment did not appear to influence the HDAC11 effect on Cdt1 protein levels. In this study, we have identified Cdt1 as an acetylated protein, adding another regulator of genomic integrity to the growing list of proteins modulated by acetylation and deacetylation. Similar to p53 (21.Li M. Luo J. Brooks C.L. Gu W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50607-50611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 22.Tang Y. Zhao W. Chen Y. Zhao Y. Gu W. Cell. 2008; 133: 612-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), we have found that acetylation protects Cdt1 from ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation. Both ubiquitylation and acetylation modify the ϵ-amino group of lysine residues. Although the sites of acetylation and ubiquitylation overlap in p53, this does not appear to be the case for Cdt1, as we have preliminary evidence that removal of the C-terminal 120 amino acids prevents ubiquitylation. Our findings apparently contradict a published report that Cdt1 can be N-terminally ubiquitylated in a lysine-independent manner (10.Senga T. Sivaprasad U. Zhu W. Park J.H. Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6246-6252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that Senga et al. (10.Senga T. Sivaprasad U. Zhu W. Park J.H. Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6246-6252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) examined the degradation of the N-terminal 98 amino acids in which all lysines were mutated, but not the complete Cdt1 protein. In addition to Cdt1 and p53, acetylation appears to enhance the stability of multiple other proteins, including c-Myc, E2F1, and the androgen receptor, to name a few (23.Patel J.H. Du Y. Ard P.G. Phillips C. Carella B. Chen C.J. Rakowski C. Chatterjee C. Lieberman P.M. Lane W.S. Blobel G.A. McMahon S.B. Mol. Cell.

This, then, raises the possibility that protein acetylation may be a common, although not universal, mechanism by which protein stability could be regulated. The N terminus of Cdt1 clearly plays numerous regulatory roles. It regulates stability via two distinct regions (5.Nishitani H. Sugimoto N. Roukos V. Nakanishi Y. Saijo M. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Nakayama K.I. Nakayama K. Fujita M. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1126-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and also contains the nuclear localization signal (26.Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30807-30816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition, the N terminus plays a secondary, but critical, role in binding to the inhibitor geminin (2.Saxena S. Yuan P. Dhar S.K. Senga T. Takeda D. Robinson H. Kornbluth S. Swaminathan K. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 245-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We have shown that the N terminus of Cdt1 is dispensable for binding to HDAC11 and identified two acetylation sites (Lys24 and Lys49) in this region (Fig. 4). These lysines are conserved in humans, mice, and frogs, and both sites conform to the consensus for KAT3B substrates (18.Thompson P.R. Kurooka H. Nakatani Y. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33721-33729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Mutation of these sites has no effect on the ability of Cdt1 to bind to geminin (data not shown). Of note, K24 is in proximity to threonine 29. Phosphorylation of Thr29 is required for Cdt1 to bind to Skp2 (8.Takeda D.Y. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23416-23423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Conceivably, cross-talk may exist between acetylation and phosphorylation in Cdt1. It will be interesting to determine whether mutation of these lysine residues has any effect on binding to Skp2. Our preliminary evidence suggests that the K24R/K49R mutant is less stable over time. Without the protection that acetylation provides, the mutant is more likely to be degraded. This is consistent with our data showing that KAT3B cannot enhance the protein levels of the RR mutant. Although we have shown that Lys24 and Lys49 are acetylated, it is also possible that Cdt1 has additional acetylation sites. In support of this idea is the fact that the 60–546 deletion mutant retained residual ability to be acetylated. Mass spectrometry to identify acetylation sites in Cdt1 has thus far been unsuccessful. It should be noted that due to sequence constraints, Lys24 was significantly under-represented in the peptides obtained. It is also highly likely, however, that acetylation occurs in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Our attempts at such analysis thus far have employed asynchronous cells overexpressing tagged Cdt1. Indeed, we have preliminary evidence that Cdt1 is acetylated 3 h past release from a nocodazole block, a time corresponding to the early G1 phase. Cdt1 stability is required at this time, which supports the idea that acetylation protects from degradation. Future experiments could examine Cdt1 acetylation in synchronized cells by mass spectrometry. Of all human HDACs, HDAC11 is the least studied and is poorly characterized. We have recently found that HDAC11 regulates the expression of interleukin 10 and immune tolerance (27.Villagra A. Cheng F. Wang H.W. Suarez I. Glozak M. Maurin M. Nguyen D. Wright K.L. Atadja P.W. Bhalla K. Pinilla-Ibarz J. Seto E. Sotomayor E.M. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Results from another recent study suggest that HDAC11 may be anti-proliferative. In the post-natal mouse brain, HDAC11 and the proliferation marker Ki67 are rarely observed co-localized in the same cell (28.Liu H. Hu Q. Kaufman A. D'Ercole A.J. Ye P. J. Neurosci. Res. 2008; 86: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Taken together with the fact that we obtained relatively few colonies when making FLAG-HDAC11 stable cell lines and that these cell lines grew slower than the parental cells, these data suggest that HDAC11 may diminish proliferation. The role of HDAC11 in the deacetylation and subsequent ubiquitylation of Cdt1 could begin to explain these observations. In earlier studies, acetylation has been implicated in other aspects of DNA replication. For example, mutation of the HDAC Rpd3 promotes late replication origins to fire early in Drosophila follicle cells (29.Aggarwal B.D. Calvi B.R. Nature. 2004; 430: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Similarly, treatment of HeLa cells with TSA alters the choice of initiation sites as well as the timing of the onset of DNA synthesis (30.Kemp M.G. Ghosh M. Liu G. Leffak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although hyperacetylation of core histones is likely one of the major reasons for these observations, results from this current study open up the possibility that hyperacetylation of Cdt1, protecting it from degradation, might be an equally important contributory mechanism.

Given the active role of UDP-sugars in glycosylation reactions within the secretory pathway, we hypothesized that UDP-sugar release includes an exocytotic component. This hypothesis was tested by assessing the contribution of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi-resident UDP-GlcNAc transporters to the cellular release of their cognate substrates. A sensitive and highly selective assay for UDP-GlcNAc mass was developed using purified AGX2, an isoenzyme of human UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase. Robust constitutive release of UDP-GlcNAc was observed in yeast as well as in well differentiated human airway epithelial cells. The human UDP-GlcNAc transporter HFRC1 was overexpressed in human bronchial epithelial cells and was shown to localize in the Golgi and to enhance the surface expression of N-acetylglucosamine-rich glycans. HFRC1-overexpressing cells also displayed increased constitutive and hypotonic stress-stimulated release of UDP-GlcNAc. Yeast mutants lacking Yea4 (the ER UDP-GlcNAc transporter endogenously expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) showed reduced UDP-GlcNAc release. Yea4-deficient cells complemented with Yea4 showed UDP-GlcNAc release rates at levels similar to or higher than wild type cells.

Our results illustrate that ER/Golgi lumen constitutes a significant source of extracellular UDP-sugars and therefore plays a critical role in nucleotide sugar-promoted cell signaling. Extracellular nucleotides perform important signaling functions via activation of broadly distributed P2X and P2Y purinergic receptors (1Burnstock G. Williams M. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

P2X receptors comprise seven species (P2X1-P2X7) of ATP-gated ion channels. P2Y receptors belong to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. At least eight human P2Y receptor species have been identified, seven of which (P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, P2Y11, P2Y12, and P2Y13) are activated by adenine and/or uridine nucleoside di- and triphosphates (2Burnstock G.

These observations suggest that UDP-sugars, high energy donor substrates in biosynthetic reactions, potentially are released from cells in a regulated fashion to perform autocrine/paracrine signaling. Indeed, nonlytic release of UDP-Glc has been recently reported in several cell types (14Lazarowski E.R. Shea D.A. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1190-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15Kreda S.M. Okada S.F. van Heusden C.A. O'Neal W. Gabriel S. Abdullah L. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C. Lazarowski E.R. J.

Pharmacol. 2008; 153: 1528-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms involved in the cellular release of UDP-sugars are not well defined. Nucleotide and nucleotide sugar release is postulated to occur via two possible scenarios: (i) exocytotic release from vesicles and (ii) cytosolic release through plasma membrane channels or transporters (17Sabirov R. Okada Y. Purinerg. Signal. 2005; 1: 311-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 18Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Ca2+-regulated exocytosis of ATP-rich secretory granules has been documented with nerve terminals, chromaffin cells, pancreatic acinar cells, and other excitatory/secretory tissues (18Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Circumstantial evidence supports the involvement of the secretory pathway in the release of nucleotides and UDP-sugars from nonexcitatory cells (e.g. epithelial, endothelial, and astrocytoma cells). For example, nucleotide release was associated with vesicle exocytosis and/or was impaired in cells treated with Golgi-disrupting agents or by conditions resulting in impaired vesicle trafficking/fusion (15Kreda S.M.

However, unambiguous proof of vesicular nucleotide release from nonexcitatory cells (as opposed to vesicular insertion of a nucleotide channel into the plasma membrane) is lacking. A major limitation in assessing the contribution of vesicular nucleotides to nucleotide release is the scarcity of reagents to selectively manipulate nucleotide levels in the lumen of the secretory pathway of nonexcitatory/nonsecretory cells. UDP-sugars are synthesized in the cytosol and transported into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; GlcNAc-1P, N-acetylglucosamine-1P; BFA, brefeldin A; BALF, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; WT, wild type; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. and Golgi apparatus to serve as sugar donors for glycosyltransferase-catalyzed reactions. ER/Golgi-resident nucleotide sugar transporters translocate cytosolic UDP-sugars to these organelles, using luminal UMP as an antiporter substrate (24Ishida N. Kawakita M. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 25Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). ATP is also translocated to the ER and Golgi, via ATP/AMP antiporters, where it serves as an energy source for protein folding reactions (25Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 26Guillen E. Hirschberg C.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5472-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Nucleotides imported to the ER/Golgi reach concentrations up to 20-fold higher than cytosolic levels (25Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Since ER/Golgi nucleotides and nucleotide sugars do not diffuse back to the cytosol, they can potentially be delivered as cargo molecules and released from cells (e.g. during export of glycoconjugates). Thus, by regulating the entry of nucleotides to the ER/Golgi, nucleotide transporters may contribute to the cellular release of their cognate substrates. The molecular identities of the putative Golgi ATP/AMP and UDP-Glc/UMP antiporters (27Perez M. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol.

SLC35D2, also known as HFRC1, is the human homologue to the fruit fly fringe connection (Frc) transporter and may facilitate transport of UDP-Glc into the Golgi in addition to UDP-GlcNAc (29Suda T.

A bona fide, highly selective UDP-GlcNAc/UMP antiporter named Yea4, which is distantly related to SLC35B4, is expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ER. The present study examines the contribution of UDP-GlcNAc transporters to the cellular release of their UDP-sugar substrates. We have amplified cDNA encoding AGX2 (an isoform of UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase) and used this enzyme to develop an assay that quantifies UDP-GlcNAc with nanomolar sensitivity. By manipulating the expression of HFRC1 and Yea4, we tested the hypothesis that UDP-sugar release encompasses a vesicular component. AGX2 Expression and Purification—The coding sequence of UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase (AGX2; GenBank™ accession number AB011004) was amplified from human testis cDNA with up and down primers harboring BamHI and HindIII restriction sites, respectively, at their 5′-ends. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and HindIII and ligated into similarly digested pMal-C2KV, thus introducing a His6-tagged maltose-binding protein and a tobacco etch virus cleavage site at the N terminus of AGX2. pMal-C2KV/AGX2 was transformed into BL21 Escherichia coli (Invitrogen), and the His6-tagged maltose-binding protein-AGX2 fusion protein was induced overnight at 22 °C with 0.3 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The fusion protein was purified from culture supernatants over a Ni2+-chelating column, dialyzed to remove imidazole, and cleaved from His6-tagged maltose-binding protein by overnight digestion with tobacco etch virus protease. AGX2 was purified from the digest by passing the mixture over the Ni2+-chelating column a second time to remove undigested fusion protein and His6-tagged maltose-binding protein, as previously described (31Okada S.F. Nicholas R.A. Kreda S.M. Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22992-23002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). AGX2-eluting fractions were pooled, concentrated to 1.5 mg/ml, and stored at -80 °C. Titration of UDP-GlcNAc Pyrophosphorylase—UDP-Glc-NAc pyrophosphorylase activity was assessed in a reaction mix (100 μl) containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1.2 mm MgCl2, and, unless indicated otherwise, 1 mm PPi and 2 mm UDP-GlcNAc. Conversion of UDP-GlcNAc to UTP was monitored by HPLC. Incubations were allowed to proceed for various times at 37 °C and terminated by heating the samples for 2 min at 95 °C. One enzyme unit was defined as the amount of AGX2 catalyzing the formation of 1 μmol of UTP/min at 37 °C. The Michaelis constants were determined using 0.1 unit/ml AGX2. The data were fitted with a nonlinear least squares equation, using SigmaPlot version 10. Vmax and Km values represent the mean of at least two independent measurements, which varied by <10% from each other. To assess the efficiency of AGX2 in catalyzing the conversion of UDP-GlcNAc to UTP under low substrate concentrations (i.e. [S] ≪ Km), incubations were carried out in 100 μl of HEPES-buffered (pH 7.4) minimum essential medium (H-MEM) containing 0.3 units/ml AGX2, 100 nm PPi, and 4-40 nm UDP-GlcNAc. UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (0.05 μCi) was used as a radiotracer, and the conversion of UDP-[3H]GlcNAc to N-[3H]acetylglucosamine-1P ([3H]GlcNAc-1P) was monitored by HPLC, as detailed below. Quantification of UDP-GlcNAc in Extracellular Solutions—The UDP-GlcNAc-dependent conversion of [32P]PPi to [32P]UTP was assessed in 100 μl of HEPES-buffered (pH 7.4) samples containing 0.3 units/ml UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase and 100-200 nm [32P]PPi (100,000 cpm). After incubating at 37 °C for 1 h, nonradiolabeled 1 mm PPi was added to samples, followed by immediate heating at 95 °C for 2 min. Conversion of [32P]PPi to [32P]UTP was monitored by HPLC. A calibration curve, using known concentrations of UDP-Glc-NAc, was performed in parallel to calculate the mass of UDP-GlcNAc present in test samples. Preparation of [32P]Pyrophosphate—To obtain high specific activity [32P]PPi, [γ-32P]ATP (100 μCi, specific activity >3000 Ci/mmol) was incubated with 0.5 units/ml nucleotide pyrophosphatase from Crotalus adamanteus (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min, as described previously (14Lazarowski E.R. Shea D.A. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1190-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Freshly prepared [32P]PPi was stored at -20 °C and used within 2 weeks. Commercially available, low specific activity [32P]PPi (60 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cell Culture and Incubations—Polarized cultures of well differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) and nasal epithelial cells and immortalized 16HBE14o- and Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells were grown on 12-mm Transwell supports (Costar) and maintained at an air-liquid interface that mimics the in vivo environment of the airway epithelia, as previously described (32Lazarowski E.R.

Cultures were rinsed three times and preincubated for 1 h in minimal essential medium (300 μl mucosal, 500 μl basolateral) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator supplemented with 5% CO2. After the addition of desiderated reagents, aliquots (200 μl) were removed at the times indicated, heated at 95 °C for 2 min, and either used immediately or stored at -20 °C. For intracellular measurements, cultures were lysed with 5% trichloroacetic acid, which was subsequently extracted with ethylic ether, as described (32Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R.

Metabolism of Extracellular UDP-GlcNAc—Cells were rinsed twice and incubated in 300 μl of H-MEM in the presence of trace amounts of UDP-[3H]GlcNAc. Medium samples were collected at the indicated times, and 3H-labeled species were separated and analyzed by HPLC. HPLC Analysis—[32P]UTP and [32P]PPi were separated by HPLC (Shimatzu) using 3.9 × 150 mm (Nova-Pack C18 column) with an ion pairing mobile phase (1 ml/min) consisting of 8 mm tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate, 60 mm KH2PO4, pH 5.3, and 7.5% methanol. UDP-[3H]GlcNAc and [3H]Glc-NAc-1P [3H]GlcNAc were resolved from each other using a slightly modified mobile phase, consisting of 8 mm tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate, 30 mm KH2PO4, pH 5.3, and 3% methanol. The HPLC apparatus was equipped with a Radiometer Flow-One® Beta detector (Packard) and a SPD-10A UV detector (Shimatzu), and radioactivity and absorbance at λ = 260 nm were monitored on-line, as previously described (14Lazarowski E.R.

Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry—Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis was performed at the UNC Mass Spectrometry core facility. Briefly, samples (10 μl) were injected onto a C18 HPLC column (Acquity T3-HSS) and separated using a gradient developing from 5 to 95% methanol in 0.1% acetic acid. The UDP-N-acetylhexosamine signal was assessed using selected reaction monitoring of the transition from m/z 606 to 385 in tandem mass spectrometry, as described (34Turnock D.C.

Retroviruses carrying HA-tagged HFRC1 or viruses produced from pQCXIP without gene insert (“mock” viruses) were added to cells and incubated with Polybrene (8 μg/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C (35Johnson L.G. Mewshaw J.P. Ni H. Friedmann T. Boucher R.C. Olsen J.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8861-8872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed and subsequently selected with puromycin (0.5 μg/ml) for 1 week. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy Studies—Vector- and HA-tagged HFRC1-transformed cells were detached by a brief incubation in Varsene (Invitrogen) and centrifuged onto glass slides using a StatSpin Cytofuge® (Iris Sample Processing, Westwood, MA). Localization of HFRC1 was revealed by immunofluorescence, using either an anti-HA monoclonal (36Kreda S.M. Pickles R.J. Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Nat.

Elements of the cis- and trans-Golgi were revealed with monoclonal antibodies against GM-130 and p-230, respectively (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Heparan sulfate was detected with an antibody against perlecan (Neomarkers, Fremont, CA). Polarized cultures of 16HBE14o- cells were stained with FITC-labeled wheat germ agglutinin, as described previously (31Okada S.F. Nicholas R.A. Kreda S.M. Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22992-23002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Immunostaining and confocal microscopy analysis were performed as previously described (15Kreda S.M. Okada S.F. van Heusden C.A. O'Neal W. Gabriel S. Abdullah L. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C. Lazarowski E.R. J. Physiol. 2007; 584: 245-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), using a Leica Sp5 confocal microscopy. Images were processed and quantified using Adobe Photoshop CS. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis of SLC35 Transporter Expression—Total RNA was isolated from freshly cultured cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using Superscript (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using standard procedures and Amplitaq Gold (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primers used to amplify HFRC1/SLC35D2, SLC35A3, and SLC35B4 were 5′-TCCTCATCGTGCTTGTCAAC-3′ and 5′-GGAGAGGCAGAGGAAAC-3′; 5′-CCCTGGGAATTTTGGTCTTTC-3′ and 5′-GATCCCTGATGGAATAGCAAG-3′; and 5′-TTACTCTGTGCGCTTGCTTC-3′ and 5′-cagggcatagttgttcaccac-3′, respectively. Quantitative PCR for the target genes was performed using a Lightcycler PCR apparatus and a Lightcycler Fast start DNA master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science). Quantitative PCR was performed using a Lightcycler PCR machine and a Lightcycler Fast start DNA master SYBR Green I kit from Roche Applied Science. The average cross-over point was determined using the Roche software. The relative expression levels of the SLC35D2, SLC35A3, and SLC35B4 were calculated from the efficiency of the PCR and the crossing point and normalized to the expression of the reference gene 18 S, as previously described (37Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2002-2007Crossref Scopus (25859) Google Scholar). Nucleotide Release from S. cerevisiae—Wild type (WT) BY4741 (MATa his3Δ leu2Δ met15Δ ura3Δ) and Yea4-deficient Yel004W BY4741 (MATa his3Δ leu2Δ met15Δ ura3Δ yel004w::KanMX4) strains were grown overnight in yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) medium. Cells were centrifuged (13,000 rpm, 5 min) and resuspended in 20 mm Tris, 1 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4-buffered solution (pH 7.6), containing 1% (w/v) glucose (TK buffer). Cells were preincubated for 1 h at 30 °C while shaking, centrifuged, resuspended in TK at a density of 108 cells/ml, and incubated at 30 °C for the indicated times under continuous shaking. Cells were centrifuged, and supernatants were collected and stored on ice. Samples were boiled for 2 min, transferred to ice, and stored at -20 °C. For intracellular measurements, cells were resuspended in 100 μl of TK and lysed with 5% trichloroacetic acid, as described above. Samples were supplemented with 1.6 mm CaCl2 and 2 mm MgCl2 prior to nucleotide analysis. Amplification and Expression of S. cerevisiae Yea4—The yea4 gene, including the promoter, open reading frame (GenBank™ accession number U18530), and polyadenylation site, was amplified by PCR. The oligonucleotide primers were 5′-GCGGCCGCAACTTCATAGATGGACAG-3′ and 5′-GCGGCCGCAAACTTACGTCAACACCAC-3′ (the underlines indicate the NotI sites). PCR was carried out on S. cerevisiae genomic DNA using Phusion Hot Start DNA polymerase. The reaction was performed with an initial hot start cycle of 98 °C for 2 min; 35 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 58 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 45 s; and a final cycle of 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR product was subcloned into pCR-BluntII-TOPO (Invitrogen), and its nucleotide composition was verified by DNA sequencing. The yea4 fragment was inserted into a pYC240 plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. Kjeld Olesen, Carlsberg Research Laboratory, Copenhagen-Valby, Denmark). S. cerevisiae Yel004W BY4741 was transformed with pYC240-yea4 plasmid according to Gietz et al. (38Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). Chitin Staining—Preparation of cells for chitin staining using Calcofluor White Stain (Fluka) was performed, following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were grown overnight in YPD (in the presence of 300 μm hygromycin B for pYC240-transfected cells) and washed twice in TK. Cells were resuspended in TK at a density of 1 × 108 cells/ml. Fifty microliters of the cell suspension were mixed with 20 μl of Calcofluor White Stain and transferred onto a glass coverslip. The cells were examined under a mercury lamp using a UV filter in a Leica DMIRB microscope with a ×40 PlanApo lens (Leica, Germany). Images were collected with a CCD camera and processed as above. Measurements of UDP-glucose and ATP—The mass of UDP-Glc was assessed as previously described (14Lazarowski E.R. Shea D.A. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1190-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and ATP was quantified using the off-line luciferin-luciferase assay, as described previously (39Lazarowski E.R.

https://openalex.org/W2087941657,"Galectins have been implicated in T cell homeostasis playing complementary pro-apoptotic roles. Here we show that galectin-8 (Gal-8) is a potent pro-apoptotic agent in Jurkat T cells inducing a complex phospholipase D/phosphatidic acid signaling pathway that has not been reported for any galectin before. Gal-8 increases phosphatidic signaling, which enhances the activity of both ERK1/2 and type 4 phosphodiesterases (PDE4), with a subsequent decrease in basal protein kinase A activity. Strikingly, rolipram inhibition of PDE4 decreases ERK1/2 activity. Thus Gal-8-induced PDE4 activation releases a negative influence of cAMP/protein kinase A on ERK1/2. The resulting strong ERK1/2 activation leads to expression of the death factor Fas ligand and caspase-mediated apoptosis. Several conditions that decrease ERK1/2 activity also decrease apoptosis, such as anti-Fas ligand blocking antibodies. In addition, experiments with freshly isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, previously stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, show that Gal-8 is pro-apoptotic on activated T cells, most likely on a subpopulation of them. Anti-Gal-8 autoantibodies from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus block the apoptotic effect of Gal-8. These results implicate Gal-8 as a novel T cell suppressive factor, which can be counterbalanced by function-blocking autoantibodies in autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W1984532205,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis possesses an unusual cell wall that is replete with virulence-enhancing lipids. One cell wall molecule unique to pathogenic M. tuberculosis is polyacyltrehalose (PAT), a pentaacylated, trehalose-based glycolipid. Little is known about the biosynthesis of PAT, although its biosynthetic gene cluster has been identified and found to resemble that of the better studied M. tuberculosis cell wall component sulfolipid-1. In this study, we sought to elucidate the function of papA3, a gene from the PAT locus encoding a putative acyltransferase. To determine whether PapA3 participates in PAT assembly, we expressed the protein heterologously and evaluated its acyltransferase activity in vitro. The purified enzyme catalyzed the sequential esterification of trehalose with two palmitoyl groups, generating a diacylated product similar to the 2,3-diacyltrehalose glycolipids of M. tuberculosis. Notably, PapA3 was selective for trehalose; no activity was observed with other structurally related disaccharides. Disruption of the papA3 gene from M. tuberculosis resulted in the loss of PAT from bacterial lipid extracts. Complementation of the mutant strain restored PAT production, demonstrating that PapA3 is essential for the biosynthesis of this glycolipid in vivo.

In contrast, relatively little is known about the biosynthesis of other prominent M. tuberculosis glycolipids, such as di-, tri-, and polyacyltrehaloses. These acyltrehaloses are located in the outer surface of the cell wall and contain di- and tri-methyl branched fatty acids that are only found in pathogenic species of mycobacteria (6Rousseau C.

Sirakova T.D. Kolattukudy P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1451-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggest a role for these glycolipids in anchoring the bacterial capsule, which impedes phagocytosis by host cells (6Rousseau C. Neyrolles O. Bordat Y. Giroux S. Sirakova T.D.

The major polyacyltrehalose (PAT) of M. tuberculosis, also referred to as pentaacyl or polyphthienoyl trehalose, consists of five acyl chains, four mycolipenic (phthienoic) acids and one fully saturated fatty acid, linked to trehalose (Fig. 1A) (8Daffe M. Lacave C. Laneelle M.A. Gillois M. Laneelle G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The mycolipenic acid side chains of PAT are products of the polyketide synthase gene pks3/4 (7Dubey V.S. Sirakova T.D. Kolattukudy P.E. Mol.

At present, the remaining proteins required for PAT assembly have not been characterized. Interestingly, the PAT biosynthetic gene cluster strongly resembles that of SL-1, which is a structurally similar trehalose-based glycolipid unique to pathogenic mycobacteria (Fig. 1B) (9Schelle M.W. Bertozzi C.R. ChemBioChem. 2006; 7: 1516-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Both gene clusters contain polyketide synthase (pks), acyltransferase (pap), and lipid transport (mmpL) genes in a similar genomic arrangement (Fig. 1C). The SL-1 locus encodes two acyltransferase genes, papA1 and papA2, which are required for SL-1 biosynthesis (5Kumar P. Schelle M.W. Jain M. Lin F.L. Petzold C.J. Leavell M.D. Leary J.A. Cox J.S.

Microbiology. 2007; 153: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These proteins belong to the mycobacterium-specific polyketide-associated protein (Pap) family of acyltransferases, which share a conserved HX3DX14Y motif that is required for activity (11Onwueme K.C.

The PapA2 enzyme catalyzes the esterification of the 2′-position of trehalose 2-sulfate with a saturated fatty acid. PapA1 mediates the subsequent esterification of this intermediate with a hydroxyphthioceranoyl group produced by Pks2 (5Kumar P. Schelle M.W. Jain M. Lin F.L. Petzold C.J. Leavell M.D. Leary J.A.

Interestingly, the PAT locus contains a gene, Rv1182, that is homologous to both papA1 and papA2 (55 and 53% amino acid identity, respectively). This gene is annotated as papA3 in the genome and was previously shown to encode a protein bearing the signature Pap motif (11Onwueme K.C. Ferreras J.A. Buglino J. Lima C.D. Quadri L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4608-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that papA3 encodes an acyltransferase essential for the biosynthesis of PAT. Deletion of the papA3 gene resulted in loss of the glycolipid from M. tuberculosis lipid extracts, as determined by high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the purified enzyme was shown to selectively and sequentially acylate trehalose in vitro, generating a diacylated product similar to the 2,3-diacyltrehaloses of M. tuberculosis. Together, these data confirm that PapA3 plays a crucial role in PAT biosynthesis and highlight its potential involvement in the biosynthesis of related M. tuberculosis acyltrehaloses. Reagents and Chemicals—Pfu DNA polymerase was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotides were from Elim Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (Hayward, CA). Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Qiagen (Valencia, CA) kits were used for plasmid DNA purification and the extraction of DNA from agarose gels. T4 DNA ligase and BL21(DE3) chemically competent cells were purchased from Invitrogen. DNA sequencing was performed by Elim Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. 14C-Palmitoyl coenzyme A (14C-PCoA), 14C-palmitic acid, 14C-butyryl coenzyme A, 14C-crotonoyl coenzyme A, and 14C-docosanoyl coenzyme A were purchased from ARC Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO; 50–55 mCi/mmol). Unlabeled palmitoyl coenzyme A (PCoA) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Trehalose 2-palmitate (T2P) and trehalose 2-sulfate were synthesized as described previously (12Wallace P.A. Minnikin D.E. Ridell M. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1994; : 329-330Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 13Wallace P.A. Minnikin D.E. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 263: 43-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 14Langston S. Bernet B. Vasella A. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1994; 77: 2341-2353Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The synthesis and structural characterization of trehalose 3-palmitate (T3P) are reported in the supplemental material. Glass-backed silica gel 60 HPTLC plates were purchased from EMD Chemicals (Gibbstown, NJ). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fluka (St. Louis, MO) and used without further purification. Electrospray Ionization Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Mass Spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR MS)—Mass spectra were obtained on an Apex II FT-ICR mass spectrometer equipped with a 7-tesla actively shielded superconducting magnet (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA). Ions were introduced into the ion source via direct injection at a rate of 1 μl/min. Ions were generated with an Apollo pneumatically assisted electrospray ionization source (Analytica, Branford, CT) operating in the negative ion mode and were accumulated in an RF-only external hexapole for 0.5–2 s before being transferred to the ion cyclotron resonance cell for mass analysis. Mass spectra consist of 512,000 data points and are an average of between 28 and 128 scans. The spectra were acquired using XMASS version 6.0.0 or 7.0.8 (Bruker Daltonics). All spectra were internally calibrated with at least four known compounds. ESI Linear Ion Trap MS—Additional mass spectra were obtained on an LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI source (ThermoFinnigan) operating in either the negative or positive ion mode. Ions were introduced into the ion source via direct injection at a rate of 5 μl/min. For linear ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (MSn) experiments, the precursor ions were isolated with an isolation width of 1–3 Da; the ions were activated with a 13–20% normalized collision energy for 100 ms, and the qz value was maintained at 0.250. Spectra are an average of 100 scans, acquired using Xcalibur, version 1.4 (ThermoFinnigan). Preparation of Protein Expression Vector—The papA3 gene (Rv1182, encoding residues 2–472) was amplified from M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA with the primers 5′-TACTGTAGTCGAATTCTTGCGGGTTGGACCGTTGAC-3′ (EcoRI) and 5′-GATTACAGGTCTGCAGTCAGGCAACATTCTGCTGCT-3′ (PstI). Rv1182 was ligated into a modified pMAL-C2X vector (New England Biolabs) encoding an N-terminal His7 tag and TEV cleavage site. The TEV cleavage site was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange PCR mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the His7 tag was annealed to the 5′ end of the maltose-binding protein (MBP)-coding region. DNA sequencing was performed to confirm the successful construction of the protein-encoding plasmid. Protein Expression and Purification—E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with the protein expression plasmid. Transformants were used to inoculate 1-liter cultures of LB medium containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin and 2 g/liter glucose. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C for ∼2.5 h with shaking until an A600 of 0.6–0.8 was attained. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 100 μm. After 18–20 h at 18 °C, cells from each liter of culture were harvested and suspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm TCEP) supplemented with 5 μg/ml lysozyme and 5 μg/ml DNase. Cells were lysed using a high pressure homogenizer (Avestin EmulsiFlex-C5). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and applied to amylose resin (New England Biolabs) equilibrated with lysis buffer. After washing the resin with additional lysis buffer, MBP-PapA3 was eluted in lysis buffer containing 10 mm maltose. The eluted protein was diluted ∼1:15 in low salt buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm TCEP, 10% glycerol) and loaded onto a MonoQ HR 5/5 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with the same buffer. The protein was purified using a gradient of 1.5–100% high salt buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm TCEP, 10% glycerol) over 40 min at a constant temperature of 4 °C. Fractions (0.5 ml each) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing pure protein were pooled and analyzed by the Bradford protein assay to determine protein concentration. MBP was cleaved from PapA3 using AcTEV protease (Invitrogen) and removed using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen), which bound the His-tagged MBP and protease while leaving the desired protein in solution. PapA3 was subsequently concentrated and stored at –80 °C. To confirm the identity of the protein, the purified sample was desalted on a microbore reversed-phase column (Bruker Agilent) and characterized using a Bruker Hewlett-Packard ESI-ion trap mass spectrometer. Tryptic digestion and mass fingerprinting using an LTQ mass spectrometer provided further confirmation of the identity of the protein. Protein concentration was determined by UV absorption at 280 nm using a calculated extinction coefficient of 57,340 m–1 cm–1. Biochemical Characterization of PapA3—A previously described TLC-based assay (5Kumar P. Schelle M.W. Jain M. Lin F.L. Petzold C.J. Leavell M.D. Leary J.A. Cox J.S. Bertozzi C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11221-11226Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was used to characterize the acyltransferase activity of PapA3. Briefly, PapA3 (2 μm) was incubated with 20 μm 14C-PCoA and 1 mm of the desired sugar substrate in reaction buffer (100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.2) for 2 h at room temperature. Alternative 14C-labeled acyl donors were screened at a concentration of 20 μm. The reactions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of ethanol and subsequently analyzed by TLC (35:65 methanol: chloroform) and phosphorimaging. Stocks of each sugar substrate were prepared in water with the exception of T2P and T3P, which were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The amount of DMSO in any given reaction did not exceed 5% of the reaction volume. MS Characterization of Reaction Products—PapA3 (1 μm) was incubated with 20 μm unlabeled PCoA and 1 mm trehalose or T2P in reaction buffer for 6 h at room temperature. Control reactions without enzyme were also prepared. Samples were lyophilized and stored at –20 °C prior to analysis by ESI-FT-ICR and linear ion trap MS. Construction of M. tuberculosis Mutants—M. tuberculosis cells (Erdman strain) were cultured in 7H9 medium supplemented with 10% OADC, 0.5% glycerol, and 0.05% Tween 80 or on 7H10 solid agar medium supplemented with 10% OADC and 0.5% glycerol. Hygromycin (50 μg/ml) or kanamycin (25 μg/ml) was used when necessary. The ΔpapA3 mutant strain was created by homologous recombination as described previously (15Glickman M.S. Cox J.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Briefly, specialized transduction phage phMWS120 was incubated with concentrated wild-type Erdman M. tuberculosis cells for 4 h at 39 °C. Cells were then plated on 7H10 plates containing hygromycin. Colonies were picked and screened for the deletion by PCR. The resulting deletion replaced 1136 bp of papA3 (amino acids 45–423) with a hygromycin resistance cassette. The ΔpapA3::papA3 complementation strain was created by cloning the papA3 gene from M. tuberculosis (Erdman strain) into the mycobacterial expression vector pMV261 (16Stover C.K. de la Cruz V.F. Fuerst T.R. Burlein J.E. Benson L.A. Bennett L.T. Bansal G.P. Young J.F. Lee M.H. Hatfull G.F. Snapper S.B. Barletta R.G. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Bloom B.R. Nature. 1991; 351: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar) under the control of the groEL promoter, resulting in the complementation plasmid pMWS149. This plasmid was electroporated into the ΔpapA3 strain, and transformants were selected on kanamycin-containing plates. The Δstf0 mutant was created by homologous recombination using transduction phage phMWS102 as described above. The resulting deletion replaced 600 bp of stf0 (amino acids 22–222) with a hygromycin resistance cassette. Preparation of M. tuberculosis Lipid Extracts—M. tuberculosis cultures were synchronized and grown in 7H9 media to A600 = 0.6. Cultures (50 ml) were transitioned to Tween 80-free 7H9 media and grown at 37 °C for 1 day. Surface lipids were extracted with hexane (1 ml) as described previously (17Converse S.E. Mougous J.D. Leavell M.D. Leary J.A. Bertozzi C.R. Cox J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6121-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The remaining cell pellets were extracted with 4 ml of chloroform: methanol (1:1). Sample Preparation for Mass Spectrometry—PapA3 reaction product samples were resuspended in 1 ml of 100% methanol (MeOH) for ESI-FT-ICR MS analysis. For linear ion trap MS analysis of PapA3 reaction product samples, 500 μl of the resuspended volume were concentrated to dryness and resuspended in 3 ml of chloroform (CHCl3):isopropyl alcohol (IPA) (2:1). M. tuberculosis cell surface extracts were concentrated to dryness under nitrogen and resuspended in 3 ml of CHCl3:IPA (2:1). Lipids in each sample were separated using a modification of the method of Kaluzny et al. (18Kaluzny M.A. Duncan L.A. Merritt M.V. Epps D.E. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 135-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were passed over a solid-phase extraction column (Sep-Pak Vac, NH2 resin, Waters) that had been pre-charged with 3 ml of 0.1 m ammonium acetate in MeOH. The column was eluted using 3 ml of each of the following solvents: 1) CHCl3:IPA (2:1); 2) diethyl ether:acetic acid (98:2); 3) 100% MeOH; and 4) 0.1 m ammonium acetate in MeOH. Column fractions from the PapA3 reaction product samples were concentrated to dryness and resuspended in 1 ml of CHCl3:MeOH (2:1). Acyltrehaloses eluted in solvent 3. For linear ion trap MSn experiments, lithium acetate was added to the PapA3 reaction products and the T2P and T3P standards to a final concentration of 1 mm. Column fractions from M. tuberculosis cell surface extracts were concentrated to dryness under nitrogen and resuspended in either 200 μl CHCl3:MeOH (2:1) (fractions from solvents 1 and 2) or 400 μl of CHCl3:MeOH (2:1) (fractions from solvents 3 and 4) for mass spectrometry analysis. PAT eluted in solvent 1, and SL-1 eluted in solvent 4. Genomic Analysis of the PAT Biosynthetic Locus—The pap gene family encodes polyketide synthase-associated acyltransferases that are involved in the synthesis of some of the complex lipids produced by M. tuberculosis (5Kumar P. Schelle M.W. Jain M. Lin F.L. Petzold C.J. Leavell M.D. Leary J.A. Cox J.S. Bertozzi C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In some strains, including the sequenced H37Rv strain, there is an intervening stop codon in pks3/4 that results in two separate open reading frames (termed pks3 and pks4) (7Dubey V.S. Sirakova T.D. Kolattukudy P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1451-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Strains containing this mutation do not synthesize PAT (19Domenech P. Reed M.B. Barry III, C.E. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 3492-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), indicating that an intact pks3/4 gene is essential for the biosynthesis of this glycolipid. Within the same gene cluster resides mmpL10, which encodes a putative lipid transporter. MmpL10 belongs to the same protein family as MmpL8, which is required for SL-1 biosynthesis (17Converse S.E. Mougous J.D. Leavell M.D. Leary J.A. Bertozzi C.R. Cox J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6121-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 19Domenech P. Reed M.B. Barry III, C.E.

Chem. 2004; 279: 21257-21265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The genomic organization of pks3/4, papA3, and mmpL10 parallels that of pks2, papA1, and mmpL8 in the SL-1 biosynthetic gene cluster (Fig. 1C). We previously demonstrated that papA1 is the acyltransferase responsible for coupling the polyketide product of Pks2 to a trehalose-based acceptor (5Kumar P. Schelle M.W. Jain M. Lin F.L. Petzold C.J. Leavell M.D. Leary J.A. Cox J.S. Bertozzi C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11221-11226Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). By analogy, we hypothesized that PapA3 is essential for PAT biosynthesis, catalyzing trehalose acylation. PapA3 Is an Acyltransferase That Esterifies Trehalose and T2P—The papA3 gene from the H37Rv M. tuberculosis strain was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) as an N-terminal MBP fusion protein. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed an apparent molecular mass of 95 kDa for the purified protein. Following TEV cleavage and subsequent removal of the protease and MBP by Ni2+-affinity chromatography (supplemental Fig. S1), the identity of the protein was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The measured mass (51,809 ± 3 Da) was consistent with the predicted molecular mass of the protein (51,777.5 Da) oxidized at a single methionine residue. In addition, tryptic digestion and mass fingerprinting of the purified protein generated ∼61% sequence coverage, providing further confirmation of the identity of the protein (data not shown). Incubation of PapA3 with 14C-PCoA and trehalose resulted in the formation of two unique products, as determined by silica gel TLC and phosphorimaging (Fig. 2A). Only the less polar product was formed by the reaction of PapA3 with 14C-PCoA and synthetic T2P (12Wallace P.A. Minnikin D.E. Ridell M. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1994; : 329-330Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 13Wallace P.A. Minnikin D.E. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 263: 43-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). PapA3 showed no activity against several other saccharides, including T3P, trehalose 2-sulfate, α,β-trehalose, glucose, and maltose, suggesting that the enzyme is selective for trehalose and T2P (Table 1). Notably, PapA3 hydrolyzes 14C-PCoA to 14C-palmitic acid in the absence of another substrate (Fig. 2A), similar to the other characterized Pap enzymes. Further kinetic analysis of the PapA3 reaction containing trehalose or T2P was precluded by the complexity of the product mixture.TABLE 1Substrate specificity of PapA3SubstrateProduct formationaProduct formation was assessed by TLC and phosphorimaging.NucleophilebReactions were performed with 2 μm enzyme, 20 μm 14C-palmitoyl-CoA, and 1 or 10 mm of each substrate in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.2, at room temperature for 2 h.TrehaloseYesT2PYesT3PNDTrehalose 2-sulfateNDα,β-TrehaloseNDGlucoseNDMaltoseNDAcyl-CoAcReactions were performed with 2 μm enzyme, 20 μm 14C-acyl-CoA, and 1 mm of trehalose or T2P in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.2, at room temperature for 2 h.Palmitoyl-CoAYesDocosanoyl-CoAYesButyryl-CoANDCrotonoyl-CoANDa Product formation was assessed by TLC and phosphorimaging.b Reactions were performed with 2 μm enzyme, 20 μm 14C-palmitoyl-CoA, and 1 or 10 mm of each substrate in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.2, at room temperature for 2 h.c Reactions were performed with 2 μm enzyme, 20 μm 14C-acyl-CoA, and 1 mm of trehalose or T2P in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.2, at room temperature for 2 h. Open table in a new tab Interestingly, no activity was detected with 14C-butyryl coenzyme A or 14C-crotonoyl coenzyme A, which contains a trans-2-ene functionality like the mycolipenoyl groups of PAT (Table 1). However, product formation was observed upon incubation of PapA3 with trehalose and 14C-docosanoyl coenzyme A, which consists of a 22-carbon saturated fatty acid conjugated to coenzyme A (data not shown). This suggests that PapA3 may also accept the 24-carbon backbone of mycolipenic acid. Taken together, these findings indicate that lipid chain length influences the substrate specificity of PapA3. T2P and Trehalose Dipalmitate Are Products of PapA3—Products from the reaction of PapA3 with PCoA and either trehalose or T2P were characterized by ESI-FT-ICR and linear ion trap MS operating in the negative ion mode. The reaction of PapA3 with trehalose yielded two unique products measured via FT-ICR MS at m/z 615.3153 and m/z 853.5447, corresponding to the exact masses of the chloride adducts of trehalose palmitate and trehalose dipalmitate, respectively (Fig. 2, B and C). The accurate mass spectra were calibrated internally, and both reaction products were measured to sub-ppm accuracy. The product ion at m/z 853.54 was also observed in the reaction of PapA3 with T2P (Fig. 2C). Importantly, these products were not observed in the absence of enzyme. Linear ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (MSn) of the ion at m/z 615.32 yielded dissociation ions consistent with those derived from synthetic T2P (supplemental Fig. S2). MSn of the ion at m/z 853.54 was consistent with 2,3-dipalmitoylation of a single pyranose ring of trehalose (supplemental Fig. S3), which was confirmed in the positive ion mode using lithium-ion coordination (supplemental Fig. S4). Together, these data demonstrate that PapA3 sequentially acylates trehalose to form trehalose dipalmitate. T3P Is Not Produced by PapA3—To rule out the possibility that the initial acylation product of PapA3 is T3P or a mixture of 2- and 3-palmitoylated species, we synthesized T3P for additional biochemical and structural studies. To determine whether T3P is a viable intermediate in the biosynthesis of trehalose dipalmitate, we incubated T3P with PapA3 and 14C-PCoA. No product formation was detected following TLC and phosphorimaging (supplemental Fig. S5), indicating that T3P is not a substrate for PapA3. Interestingly, the presence of T3P in the reaction mixture appears to diminish the hydrolysis of 14C-PCoA by PapA3, suggesting it may instead inhibit the enzyme. For further confirmation that the monoacyl product of PapA3 is not T3P, we analyzed T3P by MSn in the positive ion mode using lithiumcation coordination (21Zhou Z. Ogden S. Leary J.A. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 5444-5446Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 22Hofmeister G.E. Zhou Z. Leary J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5964-5970Crossref Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and compared its fragmentation to that of T2P and the PapA3 monoacyl reaction product ion (Fig. 3). T2P, T3P, and the monoacyl PapA3 reaction product were observed at m/z 587, corresponding to the lithium adducts of these molecules. Two dissociation ions at m/z 425 and 407 were observed in the MS2 spectra of these ions, corresponding to the cleavage of the glycosidic bond between the pyranose rings of trehalose (data not shown). The MS3 spectrum of the monoacyl PapA3 reaction product dissociation ion at m/z 407 was identical to that derived from synthetic T2P (Fig. 3, A and B) and dramatically distinct from the MS3 spectrum derived from synthetic T3P (Fig. 3C). These data clearly demonstrate that the monoacyl PapA3 reaction product is not T3P. Combined with the finding that T3P is not a substrate for PapA3, these data support the assignment of T2P as the initial acylation product of PapA3. PapA3 Is Required for PAT Biosynthesis in Vivo—To determine whether PapA3 is required for PAT biosynthesis in vivo, a papA3 deletion mutant, ΔpapA3, was generated in the Erdman strain of M. tuberculosis. The H37Rv strain sequenced by Cole et al. (23Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K. Feltwell T. Gentles S. Hamlin N. Holroyd S. Hornsby T. Jagels K. Krogh A. McLean J. Moule S. Murphy L. Oliver K. Osborne J. Quail M.A. Rajandream M.A. Rogers J. Rutter S. Seeger K. Skelton J. Squares R. Squares S. Sulston J.E. Taylor K. Whitehead S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6522) Google Scholar) contains a stop codon in pks3/4, which truncates the encoded polyketide synthase and abolishes PAT biosynthesis. However, sequencing confirmed that the Erdman strain used in these studies encodes a single open reading frame for pks3/4, yielding a functional polyketide synthase (data not shown). Extraction of the crude lipids from wild-type Erdman cells with organic solvents followed by ESI-FT-ICR MS analysis confirmed the presence of the PAT lipid envelope in this strain of M. tuberculosis (Fig. 4). In contrast, PAT was not observed in extracts from the ΔpapA3 mutant strain. Complementation of the ΔpapA3 mutant strain with a plasmid encoding papA3 restored PAT production, demonstrating that PapA3 is essential for the biosynthesis of this glycolipid in M. tuberculosis. PAT Biosynthesis Is Independent of SL-1 Biosynthesis—Given the similarities between the PAT and SL-1 genetic loci, we sought to determine whether the two biosynthetic pathways shared common intermediates. The first committed step in SL-1 biosynthesis is the sulfation of trehalose at the 2-position of one of the glucose moieties by the sulfotransferase Stf0 (24Mougous J.D. Petzold C.J. Senaratne R.H. Lee D.H. Akey D.L. Lin F.L. Munchel S.E. Pratt M.R. Riley L.W. Leary J.A. Berger J.M. Bertozzi C.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, we analyzed the M. tuberculosis Δstf0 mutant strain, which lacks SL-1 as well as its upstream biosynthetic precursors, for the presence of PAT. FT-ICR MS analysis of crude lipid extracts clearly showed the presence of PAT in the Δstf0 mutant strain (Fig. 4). Also, SL-1 synthesis was not perturbed in the ΔpapA3 mutant strain. These data indicate that the PAT biosynthetic pathway is independent of the SL-1 pathway and that these pathways share no intermediates other than the cellular pool of trehalose. The data presented here establish that PapA3 is an acyltransferase required for PAT biosynthesis in M. tuberculosis. Recombinant PapA3 selectively acylates trehalose and T2P in a manner consistent with the structure of PAT. Also, deletion of papA3 from M. tuberculosis prevents PAT synthesis in vivo. Furthermore, despite the genetic and structural similarities between PAT and SL-1, the biosynthetic pathways of these metabolites are independent. However, many questions remain about PapA3 and PAT biosynthesis. In vitro, PapA3 catalyzes the sequential transfer of two palmitoyl groups onto a single glucose residue of trehalose, suggesting that PapA3 installs both the palmitoyl group at the 2-position of PAT and the 3-mycolipenoyl group (Fig. 1A). It is possible that PapA3 associates with other proteins in the PAT biosynthetic pathway, forming a coordinate synthetic complex similar to that described for phthiocerol dimycocerosate biosynthesis (25Jain M. Cox J.S. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e2Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Such supramolecular assemblies may influence substrate availability and orientation in the PapA3 active site, thereby conferring this unique activity. Whether PapA3 is truly a bifunctional acyltransferase remains unclear. PapA3 may only install the palmitoyl group of PAT in vivo, in which case the formation of trehalose dipalmitate by the purified enzyme is an in vitro artifact. Such activity has been observed with the lauroyltransferase of E. coli lipid A biosynthesis, which transfers two lauroyl groups in vitro but only one in vivo (26Six D.A. Carty S.M. Guan Z. Raetz C.R. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8623-8637Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the mycolipenoyl groups found at the 3-, 6-, 2′-, and 4′-positions of PAT may all be physiological products of PapA3. This hypothesis is supported by the genetic association between papA3 and the mycolipenate synthase pks3/4 and the promiscuity of PapA3 toward the acylation state of trehalose. Unfortunately, our analysis of the acylation events catalyzed by PapA3 is limited by the lack of a commercially available mycolipenoyl substrate and our limited capability to detect either T2P or trehalose mycolipenates in vivo. The chemical similarities between PAT and SL-1 suggest that the biosynthesis of these molecules may be comparable. However, the SL-1 gene locus encodes two Pap proteins, PapA2 and PapA1, which sequentially install a palmitoyl group and a methyl-branched hydroxyphthioceranoyl group, respectively. By comparison, the PAT gene locus encodes only PapA3. Previously, we showed that PapA2 does not recognize trehalose and cannot account for T2P synthesis (5Kumar P. Schelle M.W. Jain M. Lin F.L. Petzold C.J. Leavell M.D. Leary J.A. Cox J.S. Bertozzi C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11221-11226Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We initially hypothesized that the SL-1 precursor trehalose-2-sulfate-2′-palmitate (termed SL659) may be desulfated by a sulfatase to form T2P, thus negating the need for a committed trehalose palmitoyl-transferase. However, the Δstf0 mutant strain, which lacks SL659, maintained the ability to synthesize PAT. We therefore conclude that SL-1 and PAT biosynthesis are independent. On the basis of our biochemical and genetic data, we propose the model for PAT biosynthesis shown in Fig. 5. Initially, PapA3 modifies the 2-position of one of the glucose residues of trehalose with a palmitoyl group from an unknown acyl donor, most likely PCoA or an acyl pantotheine-based cofactor. A mycolipenoyl group is then transferred to the 3-position of T2P by PapA3, which may associate directly with Pks3/4 or an unknown acyl carrier protein to initiate this second acylation step. The resulting 2,3-diacyltrehalose may be transported to the cell surface without further modification through an unknown pathway. Alternatively, it may serve as a biosynthetic intermediate that is elaborated either intracellularly or extracellularly with the three remaining mycolipenoyl groups of PAT by means of PapA3 or an unidentified acyltransferase. By analogy to other M. tuberculosis lipid biosynthetic pathways, transport of PAT or its precursor to the cell surface is most likely accomplished by MmpL10. Clearly, several questions regarding the biosynthesis of PAT remain unanswered. The synthesis of physiological substrates for in vitro assays and the comparative lipid analysis of a panel of PAT biosynthetic mutants, including ΔmmpL10 and Δpks3/4, may resolve some of these issues. Whereas genes from the PAT biosynthetic gene cluster are up-regulated under various conditions of environmental stress, including phagosomal acidification and nutrient starvation (27Rohde K.H. Abramovitch R.B. Russell D.G. Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 352-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 28Hampshire T. Soneji S. Bacon J. James B.W. Hinds J. Laing K. Stabler R.A. Marsh P.D. Butcher P.D. Tuberculosis. 2004; 84: 228-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), the role of PAT in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis remains a mystery. Notably, a recent study of an M. tuberculosis strain deficient in PAT biosynthesis suggests PAT does not contribute to virulence in mice (29Chesne-Seck M.L. Barilone N. Boudou F. Gonzalo Asensio J.

However, the phenotype of SL-1-deficient M. tuberculosis strains is also indistinguishable from wild type in the murine model of infection (5Kumar P. Schelle M.W. Jain M. Lin F.L. Petzold C.J.

https://openalex.org/W2131587303,"Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), or thrombospondin-5 (TSP-5), is a secreted glycoprotein that is important for growth plate organization and function. Mutations in COMP cause two skeletal dysplasias, pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (EDM1). In this study, we determined the structure of a recombinant protein that contains the last epidermal growth factor repeat, the type 3 repeats and the C-terminal domain (CTD) of COMP to 3.15-A resolution limit by X-ray crystallography. The CTD is a beta-sandwich that is composed of 15 antiparallel beta-strands, and the type 3 repeats are a contiguous series of calcium binding sites that associate with the CTD at multiple points. The crystal packing reveals an exposed potential metal-ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) on one edge of the beta-sandwich that is common to all TSPs and may serve as a binding site for collagens and other ligands. Disease-causing mutations in COMP disrupt calcium binding, disulfide bond formation, intramolecular interactions, or sites for potential ligand binding. The structure presented here and its unique molecular packing in the crystal identify potential interactive sites for glycosaminoglycans, integrins, and collagens, which are key to cartilage structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W2051468528,"Background Rapid herbivore-induced jasmonic acid (JA) accumulation is known to mediate many induced defense responses in vascular plants, but little is known about how JA bursts are metabolized and modified in response to repeated elicitations, are propagated throughout elicited leaves, or how they directly influence herbivores. Methodology/Principal Findings We found the JA burst in a native population of Nicotiana attenuata to be highly robust despite environmental variation and we examined the JA bursts produced by repeated elicitations with Manduca sexta oral secretions (OS) at whole- and within-leaf spatial scales. Surprisingly, a 2nd OS-elicitation suppressed an expected JA burst at both spatial scales, but subsequent elicitations caused more rapid JA accumulation in elicited tissue. The baseline of induced JA/JA-Ile increased with number of elicitations in discrete intervals. Large veins constrained the spatial spread of JA bursts, leading to heterogeneity within elicited leaves. 1st-instar M. sexta larvae were repelled by elicitations and changed feeding sites. JA conjugated with isoleucine (JA-Ile) translates elicitations into defense production (e.g., TPIs), but conjugation efficiency varied among sectors and depended on NaWRKY3/6 transcription factors. Elicited TPI activity correlated strongly with the heterogeneity of JA/JA-Ile accumulations after a single elicitation, but not repeated elicitations. Conclusions/Significance Ecologically informed scaling of leaf elicitation reveals the contribution of repeated herbivory events to the formation of plant memory of herbivory and the causes and importance of heterogeneity in induced defense responses. Leaf vasculature, in addition to transmitting long-distance damage cues, creates heterogeneity in JA bursts within attacked leaves that may be difficult for an attacking herbivore to predict. Such unpredictability is a central tenet of the Moving Target Model of defense, which posits that variability in itself is defensive."
https://openalex.org/W1992444784,"Metal-activated transcription factor 1 (MTF1) mediates the induction of metallothioneins I and II by zinc and stress signals. The mechanism of MTF1 activation has not been well understood. We analyzed the interaction between arsenic (As(3+)) and MTF1 for Mt1 induction. As(3+) potently induces Mt1 mRNA expression in mouse hepa1c1c7 cells. Induction is dependent upon functional MTF1 as induction is lost in Mtf1 knockout cells but is restored upon reconstitution with Mtf1; moreover, As(3+) induces the binding of MTF1 to the metal response elements of endogenous Mt1. Induction is not affected by modulating zinc concentrations but is markedly enhanced by cycloheximide. Phenylarsine oxide (PAO), which covalently binds to vicinal protein cysteine thiol groups, induces Mt1 with a magnitude of higher potency than that of As(3+). PAO affinity beads effectively pulls down the carboxyl half of MTF1 (MTF1(321-675)) by binding to a cluster of five cysteine residues near the terminus. Preincubation with As(3+), Cd(2+), Co(2+), Ni(2+), Ag(+), Hg(2+), and Bi(3+) blocks pulldown of MTF1(321-675) by PAO beads in vitro and in vivo, indicating that binding of the metal inducers to the same C-terminal cysteine cluster as PAO occurs. Deletion of the C-terminal cysteine cluster or mutation of the cysteine residues abolishes or markedly reduces the transcription activation activity of MTF1 and the ability of MTF1 to restore Mt1 induction in Mtf1 knockout cells. The findings demonstrate a critical role of the C-terminal cysteine cluster of MTF1 in arsenic sensing and gene transcription via arsenic-cysteine thiol interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2168164426,"Background Although the increase in risk of developing breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers has been studied extensively, its impact on mortality is not well quantified. Further, possible effect of BRCA mutations on non-cancer mortality risk has not been examined. Methodology/Principal Findings Using mortality data from the relatives of 5,287 genotyped participants, of whom 120 carried a BRCA Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutation, in a community-based study of the Ashkenazi Jewish population in the Washington D.C area, we examined the association between the three Ashkenazi BRCA founder mutations and risk of overall and non-cancer mortality. To examine risks beyond the established effects of these mutations, we analyzed the data excluding both deaths and follow-up times after reported diagnosis of melanoma and cancer of the breast, ovary, prostate, and pancreas. Using an extension of the kin-cohort method that accounts for informative censoring, we estimated that, in the absence of breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers, and melanoma, female carriers had a life expectancy that was 6.8 years lower (95% CI: 1.2–10.5) than non-carriers. In male mutation carriers, the reduction in life expectancy, in the absence of prostate and pancreatic cancers and melanoma, was 3.7 (95% CI: −0.4, 6.8) years. When deaths and follow-up times after any cancer diagnosis were excluded, the difference in life expectancy was 5.7 years for women (95% CI: −0.1, 10.4) and 3.7 years for men (95% CI: −0.4, 6.9). An overall test of association for men and women together showed a statistically significant association between BRCA1/2 mutations and increased non-cancer mortality (p = 0.024). Conclusions/Significance These findings suggest that there may be unknown effects of BRCA1/2 mutations on non-neoplastic diseases that cause death at older ages."
https://openalex.org/W1995315790,"Recently we reported that N-glycans on the β-propeller domain of the integrin α5 subunit (S-3,4,5) are essential for α5β1 heterodimerization, expression, and cell adhesion. Herein to further investigate which N-glycosylation site is the most important for the biological function and regulation, we characterized the S-3,4,5 mutants in detail. We found that site-4 is a key site that can be specifically modified by N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III). The introduction of bisecting GlcNAc into the S-3,4,5 mutant catalyzed by GnT-III decreased cell adhesion and migration on fibronectin, whereas overexpression of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V) promoted cell migration. The phenomenon is similar to previous observations that the functions of the wild-type α5 subunit were positively and negatively regulated by GnT-V and GnT-III, respectively, suggesting that the α5 subunit could be duplicated by the S-3,4,5 mutant. Interestingly GnT-III specifically modified the S-4,5 mutant but not the S-3,5 mutant. This result was confirmed by erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin lectin blot analysis. The reduction in cell adhesion was consistently observed in the S-4,5 mutant but not in the S-3,5 mutant cells. Furthermore mutation of site-4 alone resulted in a substantial decrease in erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin lectin staining and suppression of cell spread induced by GnT-III compared with that of either the site-3 single mutant or wild-type α5. These results, taken together, strongly suggest that N-glycosylation of site-4 on the α5 subunit is the most important site for its biological functions. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that site-specific modification of N-glycans by a glycosyltransferase results in functional regulation.

To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that site-specific modification of N-glycans by a glycosyltransferase results in functional regulation. Glycosylation is a crucial post-translational modification of most secreted and cell surface proteins (1Apweiler R. Hermjakob H. Sharon N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). Glycosylation is involved in a variety of physiological and pathological events, including cell growth, migration, differentiation, and tumor invasion. It is well known that glycans play important roles in cell-cell communication, intracellular signal transduction, protein folding, and stability (2Dwek R.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 3Saxon E. Bertozzi C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Integrins comprise a family of receptors that are important for cell adhesion. The major function of integrins is to connect cells to the extracellular matrix, activate intracellular signaling pathways, and regulate cytoskeletal formation (4Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6889) Google Scholar). Integrin α5β1 is well known as a fibronectin (FN) 3The abbreviations used are: FN, fibronectin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; E4-PHA, erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; GnT-III, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III; GnT-V, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V; L4-PHA, leukoagglutinating phytohemagglutinin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RT-CES, real time cell electronic sensing; WT, wild type; POMT, protein O-mannosyltransferase. receptor. The interaction between integrin α5 and FN is essential for cell migration, cell survival, and development (5George E.L. Georges-Labouesse E.N. Patel-King R.S. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Development. 1993; 119: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Goh K.L. Yang J.T. Hynes R.O. Development. 1997; 124: 4309-4319PubMed Google Scholar, 7Watt F.M. Hodivala K.J. Curr.

In addition, integrins are N-glycan carrier proteins. For example, α5β1 integrin contains 14 and 12 putative N-glycosylation sites on the α5 and β1 subunits, respectively. Several studies suggest that N-glycosylation is essential for functional integrin α5β1. When human fibroblasts were cultured in the presence of 1-deoxymannojirimycin, which prevents N-linked oligosaccharide processing, immature α5β1 integrin appeared on the cell surface, and FN-dependent adhesion was greatly reduced (9Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18011-18018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of purified integrin α5β1 with N-glycosidase F, which cleaves between the innermost N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and asparagine N-glycan residues of N-linked glycoproteins, prevented the inherent association between subunits and blocked α5β1 binding to FN (10Zheng M. Fang H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12325-12331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence indicates that the presence of the appropriate oligosaccharide can modulate integrin activation. N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III) catalyzes the addition of GlcNAc to mannose that is β1,4-linked to an underlying N-acetylglucosamine, producing what is known as a “bisecting” GlcNAc linkage as shown in Fig. 1B. GnT-III is generally regarded as a key glycosyltransferase in N-glycan biosynthetic pathways and contributes to inhibition of metastasis. The introduction of a bisecting GlcNAc catalyzed by GnT-III suppresses additional processing and elongation of N-glycans. These reactions, which are catalyzed in vitro by other glycosyltransferases, such as N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V), which catalyzes the formation of β1,6 GlcNAc branching structures (Fig. 1B) and plays important roles in tumor metastasis, do not proceed because the enzymes cannot utilize the bisected N-glycans as a substrate. Introduction of the bisecting GlcNAc to integrin α5 by overexpression of GnT-III resulted in decreased in ligand binding and down-regulation of cell adhesion and migration (11Gu J. Taniguchi N. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 21: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 12Isaji T. Gu J. Nishiuchi R. Zhao Y. Takahashi M. Miyoshi E. Honke K. Sekiguchi K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol.

Kawasaki N. Taniguchi N. Gu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32122-32130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Contrary to the functions of GnT-III, overexpression of GnT-V promoted integrin α5β1-mediated cell migration on FN (14Guo H.B. Lee I. Kamar M. Akiyama S.K. Pierce M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6837-6845PubMed Google Scholar). These observations clearly demonstrate that the alteration of N-glycan structure affected the biological functions of integrin α5β1. Similarly characterization of the carbohydrate moieties in integrin α3β1 from non-metastatic and metastatic human melanoma cell lines showed that expression of β1,6 GlcNAc branched structures was higher in metastatic cells compared with non-metastatic cells, confirming the notion that the β1,6 GlcNAc branched structure confers invasive and metastatic properties to cancer cells. In fact, Partridge et al. (15Partridge E.A. Le Roy C. Di Guglielmo G.M. Pawling J. Cheung P. Granovsky M. Nabi I.R. Wrana J.L. Dennis J.W. Science. 2004; 306: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) reported that GnT-V-modified N-glycans containing poly-N-acetyllactosamine, the preferred ligand for galectin-3, on surface receptors oppose their constitutive endocytosis, promoting intracellular signaling and consequently cell migration and tumor metastasis. In addition, sialylation on the non-reducing terminus of N-glycans of α5β1 integrin plays an important role in cell adhesion. Colon adenocarcinomas express elevated levels of α2,6 sialylation and increased activity of ST6GalI sialyltransferase. Elevated ST6GalI positively correlated with metastasis and poor survival. Therefore, ST6GalI-mediated hypersialylation likely plays a role in colorectal tumor invasion (16Seales E.C. Jurado G.A. Brunson B.A. Wakefield J.K. Frost A.R. Bellis S.L. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4645-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 17Shaikh F.M. Seales E.C. Clem W.C. Hennessy K.M. Zhuo Y. Bellis S.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 2941-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In fact, oncogenic ras up-regulated ST6GalI and, in turn, increased sialylation of β1 integrin adhesion receptors in colon epithelial cells (18Seales E.C. Jurado G.A. Singhal A. Bellis S.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7137-7145Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, this is not always the case. The expression of hyposialylated integrin α5β1 was induced by phorbol esterstimulated differentiation in myeloid cells in which the expression of the ST6GalI was down-regulated by the treatment, increasing FN binding (19Semel A.C.

A similar phenomenon was also observed in hematopoietic or other epithelial cells. In these cells, the increased sialylation of the β1 integrin subunit was correlated with reduced adhesiveness and metastatic potential (20Pretzlaff R.K. Xue V.W. Rowin M.E. Cell Adhes. Commun. 2000; 7: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Kawano T. Takasaki S. Tao T.W. Kobata A. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 53: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 22Dennis J. Waller C. Timpl R. Schirrmacher V. Nature. 1982; 300: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In contrast, the enzymatic removal of α2,8-linked oligosialic acids from the α5 integrin subunit inhibited cell adhesion to FN (23Nadanaka S. Sato C. Kitajima K. Katagiri K. Irie S. Yamagata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33657-33664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Collectively these findings suggest that the interaction of integrin α5β1 with FN is dependent on its N-glycosylation and the processing status of N-glycans. Because integrin α5β1 contains multipotential N-glycosylation sites, it is important to determine the sites that are crucial for its biological function and regulation. Recently we found that N-glycans on the β-propeller domain (sites 3, 4, and 5) of the integrin α5 subunit are essential for α5β1 heterodimerization, cell surface expression, and biological function (24Isaji T. Sato Y. Zhao Y. Miyoshi E. Wada Y. Taniguchi N. Gu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33258-33267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this study, to further investigate the underlying molecular mechanism of GnT-III-regulated biological functions, we characterized the N-glycans on the α5 subunit in detail using genetic and biochemical approaches and found that site-4 is a key site that can be specifically modified by GnT-III. Reagents and Antibodies—A monoclonal antibody against human integrin α5 subunit (clone1) for Western blot analysis was obtained from BD Biosciences. For immunoprecipitation, the agarose-conjugated anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibody (RQ2) was obtained from Medical & Biological Laboratories Co. Ltd. (Nagoya, Japan). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). A VECTASTAIN ABC kit was purchased from Vector Laboratories, Inc. (Burlingame, CA). Antibodies against GnT-III (33A8) and GnT-V (24B11) were obtained from FUJIREBIO Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Biotinylated erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin (E4-PHA), biotinylated leukoagglutinating phytohemagglutinin (L4-PHA), and biotinylated Datura stramonium lectin were purchased from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). For fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, mouse anti-human α5β1 integrin monoclonal antibody (HA5, MAB1999) was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Cells and Cell Culture—The integrin α5 subunit-deficient CHO K1 cell line (CHO-B2) was a gift from Dr. Rudolf Juliano (School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) (25Schreiner C.L. Bauer J.S. Danilov Y.N. Hussein S. Sczekan M.M. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The CHO-B2 stable expression cells containing various integrin α5 with altered N-glycosylation sites were established in our laboratory (24Isaji T. Sato Y. Zhao Y. Miyoshi E. Wada Y. Taniguchi N.

As shown in Fig. 1A, wild type (WT) indicates CHO-B2 expressing wild-type (full N-glycosylation sites) integrin α5; S-3,4,5, S-3,5, and S-4,5 show that all N-glycosylation sites were removed with site-directed mutagenesis except the indicated sites; and D-3 or D-4 represent single mutations at the indicated site. A HeLa cell line was purchased from RIKEN BioResource Center (Tsukuba, Japan). The stable expression of S-3,5 and S-4,5 mutants in HeLa cells was obtained by viral expression vector as mentioned below. These mutants and cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. GnT-III, GnT-V, and α5 Mutant (S-3,5 and S-4,5) Expression with Viral Vectors—The cDNAs encoding human GnT-III and GnT-V were amplified for cloning into pENTR-D-Topo for the Gateway Conversion System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cloned genes were inserted into the virus expression vector, pBABE-puro (Addgene, Inc. Cambridge, MA), accommodated into the Gateway Conversion System using LR Clonase reaction. The GnT-III and GnT-V constructs were transfected into Phoenix-Ampho cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for production of viral supernatants. The various α5 integrin mutants were infected with the resulting viral supernatant containing 10 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich) and selected with 13 μg/ml puromycin for 2 weeks. In the case of HeLa cells expressing S-3,5 and S-4,5 mutants, after virus infection the infected cells were selected with 2.5 μg/ml puromycin. For mock transfection, the same protocol was performed using the empty virus expression vector only. Cell Adhesion Assay Using 96-well Plate—96-well plates (Corning Inc.) were coated with 3 μg/ml FN at 37 °C for 1 h and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in DMEM at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were detached with trypsin containing 1 mm EDTA, resuspended with 0.5 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) in DMEM. The suspended cells were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 3 min and diluted to 4 × 105 or 8 × 105 cells/ml with assay medium, 0.1% BSA in DMEM. One hundred-microliter aliquots of cell suspension were added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 20–25 min. After incubation, attached cells were fixed with 25% glutaraldehyde (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) and stained with 0.5% crystal violet. The absorbance at 590 nm was measured using an automated microtiter plate spectrometer, Powerscan® HT (Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd. Osaka, Japan) operated with Microplate Data Analysis Software, KC4™ (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). Cell spreading assays were performed as described previously (12Isaji T. Gu J.

After a 20-min incubation, representative fields were observed using phase-contrast microscopy, and spread cells were counted. The rounded cells were not considered as spread cells. Cell Adhesion Kinetics Assay Using the Real Time Cell Electronic Sensing (RT-CES™) System—The cell adhesion kinetics assay was performed using a RT-CES system (ACEA Biosciences, Inc.) (26Solly K.

Briefly ACEA Biosciences, Inc. electrosensing 16-well plates were coated with 50 μl of 10 μg/ml FN (Sigma) at 37 °C for 1 h and then blocked with 1% BSA in DMEM at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were detached with trypsin containing 1 mm EDTA and resuspended with 0.5 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) in DMEM. The suspended cells were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 3 min and diluted to 1 × 105 or 8 × 105 cells/ml with assay medium (0.1% BSA in DMEM). Fifty-microliter aliquots of the cell suspension were added to each well, and the assay was performed using RT-CES SP software. The program was set up such that the cell index was measured every 2 min for 3 h. Cell Migration—Transwells (BD BioCoat™ Control Inserts, 8.0-μm inserts; BD Biosciences) were coated only on the bottom side with 10 μg/ml FN at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were starved in serum-free medium for 4 h, trypsinized, and suspended with 0.5 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) in DMEM. Suspended cells were centrifuged, and supernatants were removed. The cell pellets were resuspended with assay medium (0.1% BSA in DMEM containing 1% fetal bovine serum) and diluted to 4 × 105 cells/ml. One hundred-microliter aliquots of the cell suspension were added to each FN-coated Transwell; the cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. After incubation, cells on the upper side were removed by scraping with a cotton swab. The membranes in the Transwells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 30 min. Cells that had migrated to the lower side were counted using a phase-contrast microscope. Immunoprecipitation, Western Blot, and Lectin Blot—Subconfluent cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice and lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton in Tris-buffered saline containing protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.)). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were obtained, and protein concentrations were determined using a BCA™ Protein Assay kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were incubated with 10 μl of agarose-conjugated anti-GFP antibody and 15 μl of Sepharose™ 4B at 4 °C for 1 h. The immunocomplexes were washed twice with ice-cold lysis buffer, then were eluted with SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to 6.0 or 7.5% SDS-PAGE and then were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk or 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline for Western blot and lectin blot, respectively. After blocking, the membranes were incubated with either primary antibody or lectin for 1 h. For Western blot, membranes were incubated with the secondary antibody conjugated with peroxidase for 1 h, and the immunoreactive proteins were visualized using an ECL kit (GE Healthcare). For lectin blot, the lectin-binding proteins were detected using a VECTASTAIN ABC kit and an ECL kit. Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometry was performed as described previously (24Isaji T. Sato Y. Zhao Y. Miyoshi E. Wada Y. Taniguchi N. Gu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33258-33267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly cells were detached by trypsinizing and incubated with mouse anti-human α5β1 integrin monoclonal antibody (HA5) followed by Alexa Fluor 647 anti-mouse IgG. Negative controls underwent the same procedure without primary antibody. The analyses were performed using a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences) equipped with CELLQuestPro software. Comparison of N-Glycosylation Patterns on S-3,4,5 α5 Subunit Mutant in GnT-III and GnT-V Transfectants—N-Glycosylation is essential for integrin α5β1 heterodimer formation and therefore plays an important role in the biological function of integrin. GnT-III-modified integrin α5β1 decreased cell adhesion and cell migration on FN (12Isaji T. Gu J. Nishiuchi R. Zhao Y. Takahashi M. Miyoshi E. Honke K. Sekiguchi K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19747-19754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In contrast to GnT-III, GnT-V specifically modified only the β1 subunit and up-regulated integrin α5β1-mediated cell migration (14Guo H.B. Lee I. Kamar M. Akiyama S.K. Pierce M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6837-6845PubMed Google Scholar). Recently we found that three N-glycosylation sites, sites 3, 4, and 5 from the N terminus of the α5 subunit, were essential for the biological functions of integrin, such as cell adhesion and migration on FN and heterodimerization. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the S-3,4,5 mutant, which contained only three potential N-glycosylation sites (i.e. sites 3, 4, and 5), had characteristics similar to those of the wild-type α5 subunit, such as modification by GnT-III and GnT-V as described above. Various α5 subunit mutants were used in this study as shown in Fig. 1A. First the expression levels of GnT-III and GnT-V in S-3,4,5 mutant cells that had been transfected with a retrovirus system were examined by Western blotting (Fig. 2A). Their products were detected by E4-PHA lectin, which specifically recognizes bisecting GlcNAc, and by L4-PHA lectin, which selectively recognizes β1,6-branching GlcNAc, blots (Fig. 2B) (27Cummings R. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11230-11234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Yamashita K. Hitoi A. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14753-14755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, bands corresponding to GnT-III and GnT-V as well as lectin reactivities of E4-PHA and L4-PHA were increased in the GnT-III and GnT-V transfectants, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). Equal amounts of protein (20 μg) were loaded in each lane, and α-tubulin was used as the loading control. Next we immunoprecipitated α5 and detected N-glycans using E4-PHA and L4-PHA lectin blotting (Fig. 2C). The E4-PHA reactivities were much stronger in GnT-III transfectants than those in mock or GnT-V transfectants. This result indicates that both the α5 and β1 subunits are targets of GnT-III. In contrast, results of L4-PHA lectin staining indicated that only the β1 subunit could be modified by GnT-V, consistent with a previous study (14Guo H.B. Lee I. Kamar M. Akiyama S.K. Pierce M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6837-6845PubMed Google Scholar). The reactivities of D. stramonium lectin, which preferentially reacts with branched sugar chains (more than triantennary) (29Yamashita K. Totani K. Ohkura T. Takasaki S. Goldstein I.J. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1602-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consistently showed a significant increase in the β1 subunit of GnT-V transfectants. A significant decrease in the α5 subunit of the GnT-III transfectants further supports the notion that introduction of GnT-III suppresses additional processing and branching formation of N-glycans catalyzed by other endogenous glycosyltransferases, such as GnT-V and GnT-IV. Although it is not clear whether the modification levels of branched N-glycans on α5 subunits were enhanced in GnT-V transfectants compared with the levels in mock transfectants, it could be argued that intrinsic GnT-V-mediated glycosylation is enough for occupation of some N-glycosylation sites on the α5 subunit, which may be specifically and exclusively modified by GnT-V. Effects of GnT-III and GnT-V on Integrin-mediated Cell Adhesion and Migration in S-3,4,5 Transfectants—It is well known that wild-type integrin α5β1-mediated cell migration can be positively and negatively regulated by GnT-V and GnT-III, respectively. Therefore, we determined whether modifications of S-3,4,5 mutants could mimic wild-type α5 to affect its biological functions, such as cell adhesion and cell migration. As shown in Fig. 3A, cell adhesion on FN was down-regulated in GnT-III transfectants compared with mock and GnT-V transfectants. The cell adhesion kinetics assay using RT-CES also showed the same tendency (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, cell migration was determined using the Transwell assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Interestingly overexpression of GnT-III significantly inhibited cell migration on FN, whereas GnT-V promoted cell migration relative to the mock transfectants (Fig. 3C). These results, taken together, suggest that the α5 subunit could be duplicated by the S-3,4,5 mutant. The up-regulation of cell migration in GnT-V transfectants could be ascribed to the N-glycans of the β1 subunit modified by GnT-V. To determine whether overexpression of GnT-III or GnT-V affected integrin α5β1 expression on the cell surface, we performed fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using anti α5β1 integrin antibody. As shown in Fig. 3D, there were no significant differences in the levels of cell surface expression among the three cell types, indicating that the functional alterations shown in Fig. 3 were due to N-glycosylation of the integrin modified by GnT-III or GnT-V. GnT-III Selectively Modifies N-Glycosylation Site-4 on the α5 Subunit—As described above, the characteristics of the S-3,4,5 mutant are similar to those of wild-type α5. We therefore determined whether GnT-III could specifically modify the N-glycosylation site among site-3, site-4, and site-5. Because the N-glycosylation site-5 is essential for its expression on the cell surface, the mutant did not exhibit biological function such as cell adhesion (24Isaji T. Sato Y. Zhao Y. Miyoshi E. Wada Y. Taniguchi N. Gu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33258-33267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, we chose the S-3,5 and S-4,5 mutants for use in further studies. First GnT-III was overexpressed in both transfectants. The expression levels of GnT-III were almost the same in S-3,5 as in S-4,5 transfectants, which were examined by Western blot using anti-GnT-III antibody (Fig. 4A). It is of particular interest that the mutant S-4,5, but not the S-3,5 mutant, was clearly detected using E4-PHA lectin blot. The intensity of the lectin staining was comparable to that of S-3,4,5 (Fig. 4B). These results, taken together, suggest that site-3 may not be modified by GnT-III. Because introduction of bisecting GlcNAc into the α5 subunit down-regulates cell adhesion as described above, we checked whether this phenomenon occurred in these mutants. Overexpression of GnT-III in S-4,5 cells consistently inhibited cell adhesion on FN, whereas the inhibition of cell adhesion was not observed in S-3,5 cells overexpressing GnT-III (Fig. 4, C and D). It should be noted that cell adhesion activities of the S-3,5 mutant was similar to that of S-4,5 mutant because CHO-B2 cells do not express enough endogenous GnT-III to modify integrin as shown in Fig. 2. To confirm whether the site-specific modification also happens in endogenous conditions, we introduced the S-3,5 and S-4,5 mutants into HeLa cells that express a relatively higher level of endogenous GnT-III to examine the products of GnT-III as confirmed by E4-PHA lectin blot. Consistent with the results of overexpressing GnT-III, the E4-PHA lectin staining was clearly detected in S-4,5 but not in S-3,5 α5 subunit transfectants (Fig. 4E). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that GnT-III may specifically modify site-4 on the α5 subunit, which down-regulates its biological functions. To further elucidate the importance of site-4 for GnT-III modification, we compared the E4-PHA staining patterns of WT with single mutants, such as site-3 (D-3) or site-4 (D-4), as shown in Fig. 1A. These three expression plasmids were co-transfected with GnT-III, and the α5 integrins were immunoprecipitated using an anti-GFP antibody. As shown in Fig. 5A, there were no significant differences in the GnT-III expression levels among the three transfectants. The intensity of E4-PHA staining in D-3 cells was less than that in WT cells, but they were comparable. However, the intensity of E4-PHA staining in D-4 cells was substantially less than that in WT or D-3 cells (Fig. 5B). The ratios of E4-PHA staining versus total α5 staining purified from WT, D-3, and D-4 cells were 1.0, 0.6, and 0.2, respectively. Furthermore to directly examine the effects of GnT-III on site-4 for cell adhesion, we compared cell spreading of the D-4 mutant with WT of α5 integrin. As expected, GnT-III significantly down-regulated cell spreading on FN in WT transfectants, whereas the deletion of site-4 abolished the suppression of cell spread induced by GnT-III in D-4 transfectants (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these results clearly show that N-glycosylation of site-4 is critical and effective for GnT-III modification. In the present study, we intensively investigated the effects of N-glycosylation on the β-propeller of the integrin α5 subunit on its biological functions such as cell adhesion and cell migration and found that site-4 is essential and effective for GnT-III modification among 14 potential N-glycosylation sites. To our knowledge, this is the first report to clearly demonstrate that a glycosyltransferase of N-glycosylation can specifically modify an N-glycosylation site among multiple potential sites and effectively regulate its biological functions. Integrins can be activated by inside-out signaling mechanisms that trigger global conformational changes, which ultimately modulate integrin-ligand affinity. It is apparent that integrin activity can be regulated by other mechanisms, such as posttranscriptional modification, N-glycosylation. Altered integrin glycosylation has been associated with tumorigenesis, autoimmune disease, chronic inflammation, and cell adhesion events (11Gu J. Taniguchi N. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 21: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 30Bellis S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1663: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In particular, N-glycosylation of the integrin α5 and β1 subunits appears to be important for both structure and function. It has been reported that N-glycosylation of both the α5 and β1 subunits is necessary for α5β1 heterodimerization and its binding to FN. Moreover changes in integrin glycan composition, resulting from forced expression of selected glycosyltransferases, i.e. “remodeling,” reportedly modulate integrin functions as described above. However, most of these earlier studies examined only total changes without individual information. Therefore, the exact molecular mechanisms by which N-glycosylation of site(s) or glycan(s) occurs remain unknown. Recently we used site-directed mutagenesis to determine that N-glycosylation site-5 on the β-propeller plays an important role in the assembly of the integrin for its expression on the cell surface (24Isaji T. Sato Y. Zhao Y. Miyoshi E. Wada Y. Taniguchi N. Gu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33258-33267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to determine whether there are specific N-glycosylation sites that regulate its biological functions. Here we clearly showed that site-4 is a key N-glycosylation site for the biological function of α5 subunit that is effectively modified by GnT-III. Taken together these results indicate that individual N-glycosylation sites may have unique functions. Although the molecular mechanism by which bisecting GlcNAc is introduced into site-4, inhibiting its biological function, remain unknown, we speculate that the effect of altered glycosylation of site-4 may be related to conformational changes in the key functional regions of the β-propeller domain of the α5 subunit that are critical for integrin activation. In fact, the β-propeller domain has been postulated to be required for effective interaction between α5β1 integrin and its ligand (31Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20324-20336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast, the crystal structure of integrin αVβ3 has been successfully determined, and the main contact between the αV and β3 subunits is the β-propeller on the α and A domain on β3 with hydrophobic, ionic, and mixed contacts (32Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar, 33Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Because the α5 subunit has 47% homology to αV, Mould et al. (34Mould A.P. Symonds E.J. Buckley P.A. Grossmann J.G. McEwan P.A. Barton S.J. Askari J.A. Craig S.E. Bella J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39993-39999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) made a homologous modeling structure of α5β1. Based on the model, the α5 subunit seems to be surrounded by N-glycans, explaining the dissociation of the αβ heterodimer that occurs when α5β1 is deglycosylated by treatment with peptide-N-glycosidase F or removal of N-glycans on the β-propeller. Very recently, Liu et al. (35Liu Y. Pan D. Bellis S.L. Song Y. Proteins. 2008; 73: 989-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) used a molecular modeling approach to study the effects of altered glycosylation on the I-like domain of the β1 subunit, which is the partner of the β-propeller of the α subunit. These researchers found that α2,6 sialic acid affected the interactions between N-glycans and the I-like domain, which in turn altered the accessibility of the loop that determines specificity of ligand binding. In fact, the remodeling of N-glycans by GnT-III affects either the branching formations catalyzed by GnT-V and GnT-IV or the sialylation on the terminus of the N-glycans (11Gu J. Taniguchi N. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 21: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 36Koyota S. Ikeda Y. Miyagawa S. Ihara H. Koma M. Honke K. Shirakura R. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32867-32874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, a possible mechanism by which N-glycans are involved in the αβ interaction or conformational arrangement is that an unknown lectin domain may exist on the α or β subunit. The lectin domain of αMβ2 integrin is associated with GlcNAc on the non-reducing terminus of sugar chains on platelets, facilitating their phagocytosis (37Hoffmeister K.M. Josefsson E.C. Isaac N.A. Clausen H. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. Science. 2003; 301: 1531-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 38Josefsson E.C. Gebhard H.H. Stossel T.P. Hartwig J.H. Hoffmeister K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18025-18032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These studies further support the observation that modification of bisecting GlcNAc on site-4 of the β-propeller may be critical for the regulation of its biological functions, which may shed light on the structural studies. It is of interest to understand why GnT-III specifically and effectively modifies site-4 of the 14 putative N-glycosylation sites. There is currently no detailed information available regarding this observation, but several explanations have been proposed. First, N-glycosylation occurs on site-4 because it provides the easiest access for GnT-III. Because the integrin α5 crystal structure is currently unavailable this hypothesis cannot be proven. Second, GnT-III may associate with some other molecules, which define the specificities for protein or peptide substrates. Reportedly protein O-mannosyltransferase 1 (POMT1) and its homolog POMT2 are responsible for catalyzing the first step in O-mannosyl glycan, which is important for muscle and brain development (39Endo T. Manya H. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 417: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Interestingly Manya et al. (40Manya H. Chiba A. Yoshida A. Wang X. Chiba Y. Jigami Y. Margolis R.U. Endo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) reported that formation of a POMT1-POMT2 complex is essential for POMT activity. Only two peptides derived from the mucin domain of α-dystroglycan are highly O-mannosylated by POMT, but no O-mannosylation occurs in mucin tandem repeat peptides (41Manya H. Suzuki T. Akasaka-Manya K. Ishida H.K. Mizuno M. Suzuki Y. Inazu T. Dohmae N. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20200-20206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Similarly complex formation is also important for T-synthase (core 1 β1,3-galactosyl transferase) activity. Ju et al. (42Ju T. Cummings R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16613-16618Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 43Ju T. Cummings R.D. Nature. 2005; 437: 1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) reported that Tn syndrome, a rare autoimmune disease, in which subpopulations of blood cells of all lineages carry an incompletely glycosylated membrane glycoprotein, known as the Tn antigen, is associated with a somatic mutation in Cosmc, a gene on the X chromosome that encodes a molecular “chaperone” that is required for the proper folding and hence full activity of T-synthase. Indeed it has been reported that caveolin-1 may co-localize with GnT-III to regulate its localization and activity (44Sasai K. Ikeda Y. Ihara H. Honke K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25295-25301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Those results, taken together, suggest that glycosyltransferase complex formation may play a crucial role in determination of both activity and substrate specificity. The detailed molecular mechanism requires further study. This study specifically focused on N-glycosylation of the integrin α5 subunit. To fully understand the effects of the N-glycans on integrin structure and function, it will be necessary, in future studies, to investigate the interaction of glycans with glycans or peptides of integrin. The current study also has implications for engineering α5 that contains the glycans necessary for its activation that may facilitate the study of its crystal structure."
https://openalex.org/W2105974854,"In the central nervous system, collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) is a transducer protein that supports the semaphorin-induced guidance of axons toward their cognate target. However, we previously showed that CRMP2 is also expressed in immune cells and plays a crucial role in T lymphocyte migration. Here we further investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying CRMP2 function in chemokine-directed T-cell motility. Examining Jurkat T-cells treated with the chemokine CXCL12, we found that 1) CXCL12 induces a dynamic re-localization of CRMP2 to uropod, the flexible structure of migrating lymphocyte, and increases its binding to the cytoskeletal protein vimentin; 2) CXCL12 decreases phosphorylation of the glycogen synthase kinase-3β-targeted residues CRMP2-Thr-509/514; and 3) tyrosine Tyr-479 is a new phosphorylation CRMP2 residue and a target for the Src-family kinase Yes. Moreover, phospho-Tyr-479 increased under CXCL12 signaling while phospho-Thr-509/514 decreased. The functional importance of this tyrosine phosphorylation was demonstrated by Y479F mutation that strongly reduced CXCL12-mediated T-cell polarization and motility as tested in a transmigration model and on neural tissue. We propose that differential phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase-3β and Yes modulates the contribution of CRMP2 to cytoskeletal reorganization during chemokine-directed T-cell migration. In addition to providing a novel mechanism for T lymphocyte motility, our findings reveal CRMP2 as a transducer of chemokine signaling.

In addition to providing a novel mechanism for T lymphocyte motility, our findings reveal CRMP2 as a transducer of chemokine signaling. T lymphocyte migration is the basis of major immune functions such as responses to infection and inflammation, as well as normal recirculation through the lymphoid organs. Indeed, the role of T-cells depends strongly on their ability to travel between organs via the blood and lymph and to move rapidly within these tissues, by extravasation (1von Andrian U.H. Mempel T.R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). This latter function is dependent on extracellular signals, among which chemokines play a major role. Chemokines form a superfamily of small proteins that orchestrate lymphocyte polarization and migration (2Bleul C.C. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Casasnovas J.M. Aiuti A. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). These proteins exert their functions by binding specific seven-transmembrane-domain G-protein-coupled receptors on the T-cell surface (3Fredriksson R. Lagerstrom M.C. Lundin L.G. Schioth H.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1256-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar). T-lymphocytes exposed to chemokines, in a soluble or surface-bound gradient, develop a polarized shape, extending at the front, an F-actin-rich lamellipodium, which constitutes the leading edge, and a trailing edge or uropod in which both the microtubule and vimentin networks are retracted during migration. Although F-actin has the well known function of producing the mechanical forces required to generate movement (4Vicente-Manzanares M. Viton M. Sanchez-Madrid F. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 239: 53-68PubMed Google Scholar), the role of microtubules and vimentin in T-cell migration requires further investigation. Cytoskeletal remodeling is of key importance in migrating cells (5Serrador J.M. Nieto M. Sanchez-Madrid F. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 228-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and is one of the functions carried out by the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1α, also named CXCL12. In association with its cognate receptor CXCR4, CXCL12 is a potent chemoattractant for mature T-cells and monocytes (6Lataillade J.J. Domenech J. Le Bousse-Kerdiles M.C. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 2004; 15: 177-188PubMed Google Scholar). Following ligand recognition and binding, CXCR4 signaling starts with the activation of G proteins, followed by various signaling cascade effectors, including MAP 2The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; Akt, v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog; CRMP2, collapsin response mediator protein 2; Cdk5, cyclin-dependent kinase 5; GSK-3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; C-ter, C-terminal; wt, wild type. 2The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; Akt, v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog; CRMP2, collapsin response mediator protein 2; Cdk5, cyclin-dependent kinase 5; GSK-3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; C-ter, C-terminal; wt, wild type. kinases, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and phospholipase Cγ (7Mellado M.

Although this intracellular signaling cascade has not been completely elucidated, the Src family non-receptor tyrosine kinase Lck and the Syk kinase ZAP-70 have emerged as the main candidates for delivering the input signal following CXCR4 activation (8Patrussi L. Baldari C.T. Immunol. Lett. 2008; 115: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, tyrosine kinase activity appears as a central step in CXCR4-dependent chemotaxis. While searching for molecules involved in T-cell motility, we recently identified collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) (9Vincent P. Collette Y. Marignier R. Vuaillat C. Rogemond V. Davoust N. Malcus C. Cavagna S. Gessain A. Machuca-Gayet I. Belin M.F. Quach T. Giraudon P. J.

Moreover, CRMP2 was found at the uropod of motile T-cells and has the ability to bind cytoskeletal elements, including vimentin. A correlation between CRMP2 expression levels and cell migratory rates toward a chemokine gradient, including CXCL12, was demonstrated by overexpression and knockdown experiments in T-cells (9Vincent P.

In addition, we recently reported that, in mouse model of neuroinflammation, elevated CRMP2 expression in T lymphocytes correlated with their elevated migratory rates and their ability to target the central nervous system (12Vuaillat C.

The importance of CXCL12 in the central nervous system and its implication in the pathogenesis of central nervous system disorders, including neuroinflammatory diseases, are well documented (review in Ref. 13Li M. Ransohoff R.M. Prog. Neurobiol. 2008; 84: 116-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether and how CRMP2 participates in the transduction pathway induced by CXCL12 on T lymphocytes. Cells and Antibodies—The Jurkat T-cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 complemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Primary T lymphocytes selected from the blood of a healthy donor were cultured for 1-2 weeks in RPMI complemented with 10% AB human serum and interleukin-2 (20 units/ml). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing both full-length and cleaved CRMP2 forms have been described previously (14Rogemond V. Auger C. Giraudon P. Becchi M. Auvergnon N. Belin M.F. Honnorat J. Moradi-Ameli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14751-14761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The peptide sequences used to generate C-ter and pep4 antisera were localized between amino acids 557-572 and 454-465 in the CRMP2 sequence, respectively. Antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography on the corresponding immobilized peptide. Sheep antisera recognizing CRMP2-pSer-522 (PB-044) and CRMP2-pThr-509/514 (PB-043) were from Kina Source Limited (Dundee, UK). Our rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against a peptide phosphorylated on Tyr-479 (CRMP2-pTyr-479) and purified in a two steps method by affinity chromatography on the corresponding immobilized peptide (step 1: elimination of antibody anti un-phosphorylated peptide; step 2: purification of anti-phosphorylated peptide). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay performed against CRMP2-Tyr-479 and CRMP2-pTyr-479 peptides showed the specificity of our anti-CRMP2-pTyr-479 antibody. In addition, treatment of T-cell lysate with phosphatase calf intestinal phosphatase significantly reduced the positive signal of anti-pTyr-479 but not of anti-pep4 antibody analyzed in Western blot (supplement Fig. S1). Rabbit polyclonal antibody anti-Yes kinase (06.514) was from Upstate. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against the human phospho-Yes1-Y537 was from Abgent and showed cross-reaction with phospho-Src-Y530 a protein with very high homology. Mouse anti-vimentin (M0725) was from Dako. Anti-Erk (9102) and phospho-Erk (9101) antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology recognized the un-phospho- and phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (Erk1 and Erk2). Anti-Cdk5 (SC-173), Cdk5-pTyr-15 (SC-12918), and Cdk5-pSer-159 (SC-12919) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit anti-GSK-3β (ΑΒ8687) was from Chemicon International. Mouse anti-pGSK-3 from Upstate recognized the active forms of both GSK-3α (pTyr-279) and GSK-3β (pTyr-216) (05-413). Magnetic phospho enrichment beads (TALON® PMAC) were purchased from Clontech. Cell-permeable peptide inhibitor of GSK-3β, L803-mts, was from Calbiochem. Plasmids and Constructs—The CRMP2-FLAG-wt plasmid has been described previously (14Rogemond V. Auger C. Giraudon P. Becchi M. Auvergnon N. Belin M.F. Honnorat J. Moradi-Ameli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14751-14761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, full-length CRMP2 was amplified by PCR and inserted directionally into the pCMV2-FLAG vector (Sigma). The mutation consisted of a two-step PCR procedure used to generate the CRMP2-Y479F mutant. First, a C-terminal fragment (471-572) containing the Y479F mutation was generated using a reverse primer introducing an EcoR1 site at the 3′-end and a forward primer with the codon: Tyr-479 (TAC) substituted with Phe (TTC). Next, this mutated fragment was used as a reverse primer in the second PCR reaction with a wild-type forward primer introducing a HindIII site at the 5′-end. The final PCR product was cloned into the HindIII and EcoRI sites of the pCMV2-FLAG vector, and the DNA sequence of the mutant was verified by sequencing. For the transfection, Jurkat T-cells were transfected with CRMP2-FLAG-wt, CRMP2-FLAG-Y479F, and empty-FLAG plasmids using Amaxa Nucleofector technology (Köln, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. T-cells were used 18 h after transfection. Transfected cells were visualized by immunostaining with anti-FLAG antibody. The percentage of transfection reached 40-50% for most of the FLAG constructs. Immunocytochemistry—The CRMP2 forms, Yes kinase and intermediary filament vimentin were detected by indirect immunofluorescence on Jurkat and primary T-cells adhered to collagen I-coated slides (20 μg/ml) and fixed following treatment (acetone -20 °C, 10 min). Cells were incubated with specific antibody (1 h, 37 °C) then with Alexa 488- or 546-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit or anti-sheep IgG antibodies (1 h, 37 °C) and examined using the Axioplan II fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). Nuclear counterstaining was performed using a fluorescent DNA intercalant, 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Roche Applied Science). Protein Interaction Assay (Pulldown GST-CRMP2)—100 μl of Jurkat cell lysate, prepared as above, were added either to 80 μl of GST-CRMP2 protein fusion or to 80 μl of GST protein coupled with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences, 1 h at 4 °C). GST-CRMP2 and GST beads were washed four times (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and proteins bound to CRMP-2 or to GST beads alone were eluted. GST (in GST beads), Yes and CRMP2 (in GST-CRMP2 beads), and GST (in GST and GST-CRMP2 beads) were revealed by Western blotting. Western Blotting—Following CXCL12 treatment, cells were lysed in homogenization buffer (Tris 20 mm, EDTA 1 mm, EGTA 5 mm, sucrose 10%, pH 7.4) complemented with phosphatase inhibitors (sodium fluoride (5 mm), sodium pyrophosphate (1 mm), β-glycerophosphate (1 mm), and orthovanadate (1 mm)) and with protease inhibitor mixture Complete™ (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were submitted to ultrasound to dissociate cell aggregates, and total proteins were measured by Lowry assay (Bio-Rad). Protein samples (10-20 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (BA85, Schleicher & Schuell Microscience) previously incubated with blocking solution (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dried milk, 1 h) and blotted against specific antibody (overnight, 4 °C), followed by incubation (1 h, room temperature) with rabbit and sheep IgGs antibody coupled with horseradish peroxidase and a chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Covalab, Lyon, France). Densitometric quantification of the immunoblot band was performed using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics), and the data were expressed as ratios to the amount detected before any treatment. Data Base and Structure Analysis—The prediction program PROSITE was used to identify the putative tyrosine kinase site on CRMP2. The structure of CRMP2 was modeled, based on the coordinates available for CRMP2 chain D (15Stenmark P. Ogg D. Flodin S. Flores A. Kotenyova T. Nyman T. Nordlund P. Kursula P. J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 906-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank entry 2GSE), using Viewerlite/4.2 (Accelrys). Cloning and Expression of CRMP2—The coding sequence for human CRMP-2 (NM_1386) was subcloned into the expression vector pEt21b (Novagen), resulting in a construct with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. The plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. For expression, cells were grown in 1500 ml of Terrific Broth (containing 7% glycerol, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and 100 μl of Breox®, Cognis) in bubble flasks. Cells were grown at +37 °C until an optical density of 2.5 at 600 nm was reached. The cultures were cooled to +18 °C for 1 h in a water bath. The expression of CRMP-2 was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and expression was allowed to continue overnight at +18 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were suspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Triton, 10 mm imidazole) supplemented with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland) and 2000 units of benzonase. The solution was sonicated for several cycles on ice. The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated with 1.5 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin 50% re-suspended in lysis buffer (Qiagen) at 4 °C for 90 min. His-tagged proteins were purified from nickel resin in a wash buffer (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Triton, 20 mm imidazole) and were eluted with elution buffer (wash buffer plus 150 mm imidazole) in 1-ml fractions. Fractions were evaluated by SDS-PAGE. Yes in Vitro Kinase Assay—Prior to the assay, His-tagged CRMP2 was dialyzed in buffer (40 mm MOPS, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol) overnight at 4 °C using the Float-A-lyzer technology (Interchim), according to manufacturer instructions. For the Yes kinase assay, 0.6 μg of dialyzed His-tagged CRMP2 were incubated with 20 ng of recombinant full-length human Yes (Millipore) diluted beforehand in enzyme dilution buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Brij, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol). The reaction was allowed in 50 μl of reaction buffer (8 mm MOPS, 0.2 mm EDTA, 30 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.4 mm Na3VO4, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm ATP) at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped with loading buffer, and the mixture was resolved on SDS-PAGE gels. Transmigration Assay—T-cell transmigration was performed with Jurkat T-cells both in micro-Transwell systems (Costar Transwell Supports, A) and in organotypic cultures of mouse brain (B). A: Transmigration was performed in triplicate in Transwell systems (Boyden chamber, Costar, 5-μm diameter pore size membrane), as described previously (9Vincent P. Collette Y. Marignier R. Vuaillat C. Rogemond V. Davoust N. Malcus C. Cavagna S. Gessain A. Machuca-Gayet I. Belin M.F. Quach T. Giraudon P. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 7650-7660Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, the T-cell preparation (3 × 105 cells/well) was added in the upper chambers and CXCL12 in the lower compartment (10 ng/ml). Following a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, cells migrating in the lower chambers were counted under the microscope (at least 30 fields examined). B: T-cell transmigration on neural tissue was assayed on hippocampal cultures prepared as follows. Hippocampi from postnatal (P7) C57BL6 mice were dissected and placed immediately in cold Gey's balanced solution supplemented with glucose (6.5 mg/ml). 400-μm slices were cut perpendicularly to the septotemporal axis of the hippocampus using a McIllwain tissue chopper. Slices were carefully trimmed for excess tissue, and 6 slices were placed immediately on 30-mm semi-permeable membrane inserts (Millicell-CM, Millipore) in a 6-well plate, each well containing 1 ml of culture medium. The culture medium consisted of 50% minimum essential medium (Invitrogen), 25% Hanks balanced salt solution, 25% heat-inactivated horse serum (Invitrogen), 1% l-glutamine 200 Mm (Invitrogen), and 6.5 mg/ml d-glucose. Plates were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The culture medium was exchanged twice a week. Jurkat T-cells (1 × 106 cells per slice) stained ex vivo using the vital fluorochrome carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (1 mm, 5 min, 37 °C) were spotted close to the hippocampus slices (3 week culture). Following 18 h contact at 37 °C, slices were extensively washed with d-MEM, fixed with ethanol (10 min, 4 °C), and incubated with DAPI for nuclear counterstaining. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance in comparing two means was tested with the unpaired Student's t test; p values < 0.05 were considered significant. In the migration test, the number of migratory lymphocytes was counted by light microscopy (15-20 microscope fields per condition with 2 or 3 independent experiments), and data were expressed as the mean number of migratory lymphocytes per field. CXCL12 Induces CRMP2 Polarization at the T Lymphocyte Uropod—To define a link between chemokines and CRMP2, we first examined the localization of CRMP2 in Jurkat T-cells under CXCL12 signaling. We used two different anti-CRMP2 antibodies (anti-C-ter and anti-pep4) that recognize the full-length and cleaved products of CRMP2. An immunofluorescence study of untreated T-cells revealed that CRMP2 was found within the T-cell cytoplasm as punctate dots (Fig. 1A, 0mn). Under CXCL12 treatment, CRMP2 moved to the cell trailing edge within 2 min and showed quasi-exclusive uropod localization in most polarized cells after 10-min treatment (Fig. 1A, anti-C-ter antibody). This phenomenon of CRMP2 polarization was still observed after 30 min of treatment (not shown). Un-treated Jurkat T-cells showed an asymmetrical CRMP2 distribution in cells, but increases of 1.6- to 2-fold were observed after CXCL12 treatment (Fig. 1A, graph). Similar CRMP2 relocalization was observed with anti-pep4 antibody staining (not shown). In addition CRMP2 distribution to the uropod was concomitant with the re-localization of vimentin, which was quickly redistributed at the trailing edge of polarizing T-cells (Fig. 1B, right panel). Interestingly, CRMP2 re-localization was reversed to a great extent (35% decrease) in the presence of AMD3100, an antagonist of the CXCL12 receptor (CXCR4), consequently confirming the specificity of the CXCL12-induced response (Fig. 1C). These results supported the idea that chemokines can induce a dynamic re-localization of CRMP2 in T lymphocytes in concert with vimentin, namely in the flexible uropod structure. CXCL12 Modulates CRMP2 Binding to the Cytoskeleton—It is well known that T-cell uropods are rich in vimentin and microtubules (5Serrador J.M. Nieto M. Sanchez-Madrid F. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 228-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), two cytoskeletal elements that have both been described as CRMP2 binding partners (9Vincent P. Collette Y. Marignier R. Vuaillat C. Rogemond V. Davoust N. Malcus C. Cavagna S. Gessain A. Machuca-Gayet I. Belin M.F. Quach T. Giraudon P. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 17917-17920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and actors in T-lymphocyte polarization and migration (17Krummel M.F. Macara I. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1143-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This led us to hypothesize that CXCL12 could modulate CRMP2 binding to the cytoskeleton to promote T-cell motility. Following CXCL12 treatment (100 ng/ml, 10 and 30 min), subcellular fractionation was performed on Jurkat T-cell extracts to isolate cytoskeletal elements and associated proteins from the cytosol fraction. Identification of the subcellular fractions using antibodies against vimentin, tubulin poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and Hsp90 indicated that there was no contamination between cytoskeletal and cytosolic fractions (not shown). The cytoskeletal fraction displayed the intermediate filament vimentin but was free from tubulin, probably due to de-polymerization as it is found in the cytosol (not shown). Different fractions were then subjected to Western blotting using anti-CRMP2 antibodies. In whole cell lysates of untreated cells, anti-C-ter antibody revealed CRMP2 bands corresponding to the previously described full-length CRMP2 (62 kDa) and bands with higher molecular mass (Fig. 2A). Anti-pep4 antibody mainly recognized a 58-kDa band, corresponding to the cleaved form of CRMP2, as reported in neural cells (14Rogemond V. Auger C. Giraudon P. Becchi M. Auvergnon N. Belin M.F. Honnorat J. Moradi-Ameli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14751-14761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). After CXCL12 treatment, the efficiency of which was assessed by Erk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A), no difference in CRMP2 expression was detectable in whole cell lysates. However, the distribution of CRMP2 forms differed according to the T-cell compartment examined. Full-length CRMP2 and higher molecular weight bands were found in the cytosolic fractions. These did not show major alterations under CXCL12 treatment. CRMP2 was also found, to a lesser extent, in the cytoskeletal fractions as 62-kDa full-length and 58-kDa cleaved forms. Interestingly, the expression of both forms was enhanced following CXCL12 treatment. It should be noted that the majority of cleaved CRMP2 was found in the nucleus (not shown), as previously reported in neural cells (14Rogemond V. Auger C. Giraudon P. Becchi M. Auvergnon N. Belin M.F. Honnorat J. Moradi-Ameli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14751-14761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and was not modified under CXCR4 activation. These results showed that CRMP2 was distributed in the cytoskeletal compartment of T lymphocytes and that CXCL12 had the ability to alter this distribution, enhancing CRMP2 association with cytoskeletal elements. CXCL12 Increases CRMP2 Phosphorylation—Functional regulation of CRMP2 in neural cells is mainly dependent on its phosphorylation state, notably via GSK-3β and Cdk5 kinase activity (18Uchida Y. Ohshima T. Sasaki Y. Suzuki H. Yanai S. Yamashita N. Nakamura F. Takei K. Ihara Y. Mikoshiba K. Kolattukudy P. Honnorat J. Goshima Y. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether, in T lymphocytes, CXCL12 could modify CRMP2 binding to the cytoskeleton through modulation of its phosphorylation. To evaluate CRMP2 phosphorylation, we performed a phosphoprotein-enrichment assay (TALON® PMAC, Clontech) on whole cell extracts of Jurkat T-cells following CXCL12 treatment (100 ng/ml) and carried out immunoblotting on the non-phosphorylated (flow through) and phosphorylated (eluate) fractions by Western blotting at 2, 5, 10, and 30 min post-treatment. The full-length CRMP2 forms revealed by the anti-C-ter antibody were present in both the un-phosphorylated and phosphorylated fractions (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the cleaved form of CRMP2 was only found in the phosphorylated protein pool, indicating that this form is mostly phosphorylated. CXCL12 treatment rapidly increased the level of CRMP2 phosphorylated forms, peaking at 2 min post treatment and still high at 30 min. The efficiency of the phosphoprotein-enrichment procedure was ascertained by phospho-Erk1/2 immunoblotting, which confirmed the specific presence of phosphorylated proteins in the eluate and at the same time, the increase following CXCL12 treatment. Similar experiments performed on primary T-lymphocytes isolated from healthy donors showed similar observations (not shown). A more precise evaluation of CRMP2 phosphorylation in response to CXCL12 was carried out using anti-CRMP2-pSer-522 and anti-CRMP2-pThr-509/514 antibodies recognizing two sites targeted by Cdk5 and GSK-3 kinases, respectively (Fig. 3A). Immunoblotting of Jurkat cell lysates showed that CRMP2-pSer-522 and CRMP2-pThr-509/514 were present as full-length 62-kDa CRMP2 in T-cells and were variously expressed during chemokine treatment, the efficiency of which was ascertained by phospho-Erk1/2 detection. Although Ser-522 phosphorylation was found at relatively low levels, Thr-509/514 phosphorylation decreased quickly by 4 min and was undetectable thereafter. This was consistent with the activity of Cdk5 and GSK-3 kinases evaluated by the detection of Cdk5-pTyr-15, Cdk5-pSer-159, GSK-3α-pTyr-279, and GSK-3β-pTyr-216, the active forms of these kinases (Fig. 3B). Cdk5 displayed a stable level of phosphorylation on Tyr-15 and Ser-159, reflecting a conserved level of Cdk5 activation. In contrast, GSK-3 exhibited de-phosphorylation mainly detected on the GSK-3β isoform, revealing a decreased activity starting at 4 min post-treatment. Taken together, these results first revealed, as previously described in neural cells, that the CRMP2 residues Ser-522 and Thr-509/514 could be phosphorylated in T lymphocytes. More importantly, they demonstrate that CXCL12 triggers a signaling cascade leading to differential modulation of CRMP2 phosphorylation of these residues, namely with a net decreased phosphorylation on Thr-509/514. Intriguingly, these modulations were mainly detected on the full-length CRMP2 forms, whereas phosphoprotein-enrichment assays (Fig. 2B) showed a strong phosphorylation of the cleaved CRMP2 form following chemokine treatment. This led us to suspect the participation of an additional phosphorylated target in the response of CRMP2 to CXCL12. Tyrosine 479 Is a New Phosphorylation Residue in CRMP2 Sequence—It is known that CXCL12 triggers a tyrosine phosphorylation cascade in T-lymphocytes, which involves the serial recruitment and activation of tyrosine kinases, including Lck, ZAP-70, and Itk (8Patrussi L.

https://openalex.org/W1988576322,"The carboxyl-terminal cholinesterase-like (ChEL) domain of thyroglobulin (Tg) has been identified as critically important in Tg export from the endoplasmic reticulum. In a number of human kindreds suffering from congenital hypothyroidism, and in the cog congenital goiter mouse and rdw rat dwarf models, thyroid hormone synthesis is inhibited because of mutations in the ChEL domain that block protein export from the endoplasmic reticulum. We hypothesize that Tg forms homodimers through noncovalent interactions involving two predicted alpha-helices in each ChEL domain that are homologous to the dimerization helices of acetylcholinesterase. This has been explored through selective epitope tagging of dimerization partners and by inserting an extra, unpaired Cys residue to create an opportunity for intermolecular disulfide pairing. We show that the ChEL domain is necessary and sufficient for Tg dimerization; specifically, the isolated ChEL domain can dimerize with full-length Tg or with itself. Insertion of an N-linked glycan into the putative upstream dimerization helix inhibits homodimerization of the isolated ChEL domain. However, interestingly, co-expression of upstream Tg domains, either in cis or in trans, overrides the dimerization defect of such a mutant. Thus, although the ChEL domain provides a nidus for Tg dimerization, interactions of upstream Tg regions with the ChEL domain actively stabilizes the Tg dimer complex for intracellular transport."
https://openalex.org/W2014204010,"Excessive accumulation of β-amyloid peptides in the brain is a major cause for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. β-Amyloid is derived from β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavages by β- and γ-secretases, whose enzymatic activities are tightly controlled by subcellular localization. Delineation of how intracellular trafficking of these secretases and APP is regulated is important for understanding Alzheimer disease pathogenesis. Although APP trafficking is regulated by multiple factors including presenilin 1 (PS1), a major component of the γ-secretase complex, and phospholipase D1 (PLD1), a phospholipid-modifying enzyme, regulation of intracellular trafficking of PS1/γ-secretase and β-secretase is less clear. Here we demonstrate that APP can reciprocally regulate PS1 trafficking; APP deficiency results in faster transport of PS1 from the trans-Golgi network to the cell surface and increased steady state levels of PS1 at the cell surface, which can be reversed by restoring APP levels. Restoration of APP in APP-deficient cells also reduces steady state levels of other γ-secretase components (nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2) and the cleavage of Notch by PS1/γ-secretase that is more highly correlated with cell surface levels of PS1 than with APP overexpression levels, supporting the notion that Notch is mainly cleaved at the cell surface. In contrast, intracellular trafficking of β-secretase (BACE1) is not regulated by APP. Moreover, we find that PLD1 also regulates PS1 trafficking and that PLD1 overexpression promotes cell surface accumulation of PS1 in an APP-independent manner. Our results clearly elucidate a physiological function of APP in regulating protein trafficking and suggest that intracellular trafficking of PS1/γ-secretase is regulated by multiple factors, including APP and PLD1.

APP is a type I transmembrane protein belonging to a protein family that includes APP-like protein 1 (APLP1) and 2 (APLP2) in mammals (7Wasco W. Bupp K. Magendantz M. Gusella J.F. Tanzi R.E.

APP can be transported to the cell surface in TGN-derived secretory vesicles if not proteolyzed to Aβ or an intermediate metabolite. At the cell surface APP is either cleaved by α-secretase to produce soluble sAPPα (12Sisodia S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, the subcellular distribution of APP and proteases that process it directly affect the ratio of sAPPα to Aβ, making delineation of the mechanisms responsible for regulating trafficking of all of these proteins relevant to AD pathogenesis. Presenilin (PS) is a critical component of the γ-secretase. Of the two mammalian PS gene homologues, PS1 and PS2, PS1 encodes the major form (PS1) in active γ-secretase (19Sherrington R. Rogaev E.I.

Nascent PSs undergo endoproteolytic cleavage to generate an amino-terminal fragment (NTF) and a carboxyl-terminal fragment (CTF) to form a functional PS heterodimer (21Borchelt D.R. Thinakaran G.

Based on observations that PSs possess two highly conserved aspartate residues indispensable for γ-secretase activity and that specific transition state analogue γ-secretase inhibitors bind to PS1 NTF/CTF heterodimers (5Kimberly W.T.

PS assembles with three other components, NCT, APH-1, and PEN-2, to form the functional γ-secretase (5Kimberly W.T. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Nature. 2003; 422: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Strong evidence suggests that PS1/γ-secretase resides principally in the ER, early Golgi, TGN, endocytic and intermediate compartments, most of which (except the TGN) are not major subcellular sites for APP (23Cupers P.

In addition to generating Aβ and cleaving APP to release the APP intracellular domain, PS1/γ-secretase cleaves other substrates such as Notch (25Haass C. De Strooper B.

Interestingly, PS1/γ-secretase cleavage of different substrates seems to occur at different subcellular compartments; APP is mainly cleaved at the TGN and early endosome domains, whereas Notch is predominantly cleaved at the cell surface (9Xu H. Sweeney D. Wang R. Thinakaran G. Lo A.C. Sisodia S.S. Greengard P. Gandy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3748-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 11Greenfield J.P. Tsai J.

Thus, perturbing intracellular trafficking of PS1/γ-secretase may alter interactions between PS1/γ-secretase and APP, contributing to either abnormal Aβ generation and AD pathogenesis or decreased access of PS1/γ-secretase to APP such that Aβ production is reduced. However, mechanisms regulating PS1/γ-secretase trafficking warrant further investigation. In addition to participating in γ-secretase activity, PS1 regulates intracellular trafficking of several membrane proteins, including other γ-secretase components (nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2) and the substrate APP (reviewed in Ref. 30Vetrivel K.S. Zhang Y.W. Xu H. Thinakaran G. Mol. Neurodegener. 2006; 1: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Intracellular APP trafficking is highly regulated and requires other factors such as mint family members and SorLA (2Zhang Y.W. Xu H. Curr. Mol. Med. 2007; 7: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, we recently found that phospholipase D1 (PLD1), a phospholipid-modifying enzyme that regulates membrane trafficking events, can interact with PS1, and can regulate budding of APP-containing vesicles from the TGN and delivery of APP to the cell surface (31Cai D. Netzer W.J. Zhong M. Lin Y. Du G. Frohman M. Foster D.A. Sisodia S.S. Xu H. Gorelick F.S. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 2001; 414: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) identified an axonal membrane compartment that contains APP, BACE1, and PS1 and showed that fast anterograde axonal transport of this compartment is mediated by APP and kinesin-I, implying a traffic-regulating role for APP. Increased APP expression is also shown to decrease retrograde axonal transport of nerve growth factor (34Salehi A. Delcroix J.D. Belichenko P.V. Zhan K. Wu C. Valletta J.S. Takimoto-Kimura R. Kleschevnikov A.M. Sambamurti K. Chung P.P. Xia W. Villar A. Campbell W.A. Kulnane L.S. Nixon R.A. Lamb B.T. Epstein C.J. Stokin G.B. Goldstein L.S. Mobley W.C.

However, whether APP indeed regulates intracellular trafficking of proteins including BACE1 and PS1/γ-secretase requires further validation. In the present study we demonstrate that intracellular trafficking of PS1, as well as that of other γ-secretase components, but not BACE1, is regulated by APP. APP deficiency promotes cell surface delivery of PS1/γ-secretase complex and facilitates PS1/γ-secretase-mediated Notch cleavage. In addition, we find that PLD1 also regulates intracellular trafficking of PS1 through a different mechanism and more potently than APP.

After subsequent incubation with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen), the cells were examined using a deconvolution fluorescent microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). APP/APP βCTF (C99) Regulates Cell Surface Accumulation of PS1—We and others have shown that PS1 can regulate intracellular trafficking of APP (reviewed in Ref. 30Vetrivel K.S. Zhang Y.W. Xu H. Thinakaran G. Mol. Neurodegener. 2006; 1: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, regulation of PS1/γ-secretase intracellular trafficking has remained elusive. One study found that axonal transport of a membrane compartment containing BACE1 and PS1 requires APP (33Kamal A. Almenar-Queralt A. LeBlanc J.F. Roberts E.A. Goldstein L.S. Nature. 2001; 414: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), implying that APP might reciprocally regulate intracellular trafficking of PS1, as well as that of BACE1. To investigate this, we compared the cell surface levels of PS1 in APP wild type (APP WT) and APP/APLP2 double knock-out (APP dKO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We found that although the total levels of PS1 were similar between cells, steady state levels of cell surface PS1 dramatically increased in the absence of APP/APLP2 (Fig. 1A). Such an increase was reversed by overexpressing APP in the APP dKO cells (Fig. 1A), ruling out potential clonal variation effects. In contrast, APP deficiency had no effect on cell surface levels of BACE1 (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, we found that in both HeLa cells stably expressing human APP Swedish mutations (H-sw) and N2a cells stably expressing human APP695 (N-695), steady state levels of cell surface PS1 were markedly reduced compared with those seen in control cells (Fig. 1B). Moreover, when we down-regulated APP levels in wild type mouse embryonic fibroblast and N2a cell lines using RNA interference, steady state levels of PS1 at the cell surface dramatically increased, but total PS1 levels were not affected (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results suggest that intracellular trafficking of PS1 is regulated by APP. The γ-cleavage of APP requires a precedent β-cleavage to generate membrane-bound APP βCTF (C99). Because APP C99 reportedly interacts with PS1 to form a complex prior to cleavage by active PS1/γ-secretase (47Xia W. Zhang J. Perez R. Koo E.H. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8208-8213Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 48Waragai M. Imafuku I. Takeuchi S. Kanazawa I. Oyama F. Udagawa Y. Kawabata M. Okazawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 480-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we asked whether C99 regulated PS1 trafficking similarly to APP. As expected, overexpression of C99, the direct substrate of PS1/γ-secretase, rescued increased cell surface accumulation of PS1 in the APP dKO cells (Fig. 1D). Overexpression of two C99 variants containing either TGN or ER retention signals also rescued increased PS1 delivery to the cell surface. In contrast, overexpression of an APP variant lacking the carboxyl-terminal 57 amino acids did not promote rescue (Fig. 1D). These data suggest that APP or the membrane-bound APP C99 fragment may act to retain PS1 in appropriate compartments and that the intracellular domain of APP is critical for this function. APP Deficiency Accelerates Cell Surface Delivery of PS1—We had previously found that loss of PS1 promotes budding of APP-containing vesicles from the TGN and accelerates cell surface delivery of APP (49Cai D. Leem J.Y. Greenfield J.P. Wang P. Kim B.S. Wang R. Lopes K.O. Kim S.H. Zheng H. Greengard P. Sisodia S.S. Thinakaran G. Xu H. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 2, most [35S]methionine-labeled PS1 was delivered to the cell surface after a 60-min chase in the APP WT cells. However, in the APP dKO cells most isotope-labeled PS1 was seen at the cell surface as early as after a 30-min chase, suggesting accelerated cell surface delivery of PS1 in the absence of APP.

Talin is thought to mediate this connection via its two integrin, (at least) three actin, and several vinculin binding sites.

This activation process, however, remains poorly understood, and there are contradictory models with respect to the determinants of adhesion site localization.

Intrinsic control of ligand binding activities is essential for the coordination of adhesion site function of talin. Integrin αβ heterodimers play a central role in metazoan cell adhesion, mediating essential contacts in embryogenesis, tissue homeostasis, wound healing, vertebrate cellular immunity, and pathological processes (1Hynes R.

The integrins function as transmembrane receptors in cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adherens-type junctions mediating mechanical connection as well as transmembrane signaling. Intracellularly, integrins are connected via adaptor proteins to the actin cytoskeleton. Talin plays a central role in this process by binding to the short cytodomains of β-integrins (2Liu S.

Liddington R.C. Critchley D.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 453-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Many of the proteins involved in this complex exist in a dynamic equilibrium between two conformational states, the “inert,” soluble, cytosolic conformation and the “active,” localized, ligand-bound conformation. Exchange rates of individual proteins such as talin and vinculin are high (12Chandrasekar I. Stradal T.E. Holt M.R. Entschladen F. Jockusch B.M. Ziegler W.H. J.

Critchley D.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 453-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Conformational regulation of ligand binding sites in talin is, thus, expected to have a decisive effect on the formation, maturation (signaling), and disassembly of the adhesion complex. Accordingly, vinculin mutants with increased half-lives confer longer residency times of talin in adhesion sites (13Cohen D.M. Kutscher B. Chen H. Murphy D.B. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16006-16015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, although poorly understood, the regulation of ligand binding to talin is central to the control of adhesion sites dynamics and turnover.Talin is a large 270-kDa cytoskeletal protein with an N-terminal head (amino acid residues 1-433) and an extensive C-terminal rod region (residues 434-2541). Autoregulatory interactions between these regions establish the inert cytoplasmic conformation of talin (15Critchley D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The head region consists of an extended FERM domain. The FERM F3 subdomain has a phosphotyrosine binding-like-fold (IBS-1) 3The abbreviations used are: IBS, integrin binding site; DS, dimerization site; VBS, vinculin binding site; Vh, vinculin head; MEF mouse embryonal fibroblasts; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; ABS, actin binding site; H, α-helix; FA, focal adhesion; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IF, immobile fraction; F-actin, filamentous actin; talinC, talin residues 1975-2541 (H47-H62). 3The abbreviations used are: IBS, integrin binding site; DS, dimerization site; VBS, vinculin binding site; Vh, vinculin head; MEF mouse embryonal fibroblasts; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; ABS, actin binding site; H, α-helix; FA, focal adhesion; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IF, immobile fraction; F-actin, filamentous actin; talinC, talin residues 1975-2541 (H47-H62). that is occupied in a competitive fashion by the β-integrin cytoplasmic tail and other protein ligands (16Garcia-Alvarez B. de Pereda J.M.

Preliminary studies on the talin head-to-rod autoinhibited form show that the talin F3 phosphotyrosine binding domain binds to residues 1654-2344 in the talin rod (24Goksoy E. Ma Y.Q. Wang X. Kong X. Perera D. Plow E.F. Qin J. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 124-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and suggest a role in the regulation of integrin binding.The mechanisms of talin activation, adhesion site/membrane localization, and ligand binding remain unclear. The current model assumes that the inhibitory head-to-rod binding is released through interaction with acidic phospholipids at the membrane (25Martel V. Racaud-Sultan C. Dupe S. Marie C. Paulhe F. Galmiche A. Block M.R. Albiges-Rizo C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21217-21227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and may involve non-integrin binding partners of the FERM domain, such as phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate-5-kinase type I γ or layilin (15Critchley D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 26Legate K.R. Montanez E. Kudlacek O. Fassler R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). However, the basis of activation of binding sites for integrin, vinculin, and F-actin in talin remains largely elusive. The integrin binding site IBS-1 in the FERM domain is well documented by structural studies, both crystallography and NMR, and other biophysical methods (6Wegener K.L. Partridge A.W. Han J. Pickford A.R. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. Campbell I.D. Cell. 2007; 128: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 16Garcia-Alvarez B. de Pereda J.M.

The isolated talin head region, however, associates rather weakly with adhesion sites in intact cells, and the domains and precise molecular mechanisms mediating talin recruitment to these structures have remained controversial. The IBS-2A domain (H47-H51) in the C-terminal part of the talin rod has been investigated in more detail by localization studies of fluorescently labeled proteins and biophysical interaction measurements of isolated protein domains using surface plasmon resonance (19Tremuth L.

Furthermore, the integrity of IBS-2A (helix H50) has been shown to be essential for the rescue of talin function in talin knock-out cells (27Moes M. Rodius S. Coleman S.J. Monkley S.J. Goormaghtigh E. Tremuth L. Kox C. van der Holst P.P. Critchley D.R. Kieffer N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17280-17288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). At the same time, a series of deletion mutants of ABS-3/DS (H57-H62) led to the description of an independent adhesion targeting of the talin C terminus, mediated by an as-yet undetermined binding partner(s) (28Franco S.J. Senetar M.A. Simonson W.T. Huttenlocher A. McCann R.O. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2006; 63: 563-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).The C-terminal part of talin rod, talinC (H47-H62), comprising the IBS-2A/B and the ABS-3/DS domain, evidently contains important binding sites and regulatory elements that convey essential aspects of talin function in cells. Elucidation of the complex interplay of binding sites in talinC requires knowledge of the positions of α-helices and the organization of the bundled domains. Based on the structural organization of talinC, we investigated localization, binding partners, and exchange kinetics of talinC domain constructs in focal adhesions (FAs). Our data provide evidence for interdependent binding site activities in IBS-2 and ABS-3, a key characteristic of talinC, allowing control of targeting to and residency times in FAs. TalinC, thus, establishes a tightly regulated connection between talin and the actin cytoskeleton.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructs—Vectors used for transient transfection of eukaryotic cells were modified from pEGFP-N2 and pEGFP-C2 (Invitrogen). A new multiple cloning site offering BamHI/MluI/SalI/XhoI sites was introduced by ligation of two oligonucleotides (forward, TCGATGGGATCCACGCGTGTCGACCTCGAGGT; reverse, GATCACCTCGAGGTCGACACGCGTGGATCCCA) into pEGFP plasmids via BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. Talin fragments were amplified by PCR from a mouse talin full-length cDNA clone (accession no. X56123; kindly provided by Dr. K. Yamada), cloned into pCRBlunt cloning vector (Invitrogen), sequenced, and subsequently transferred into the modified pEGFP vectors.Protein Purification and Analysis of Interactions—The cDNAs encoding various murine talin rod domains were subcloned into the expression vector pET23A-T7 (29van der Ven P.F. Wiesner S. Salmikangas P. Auerbach D. Himmel M. Kempa S. Hayess K. Pacholsky D. Taivainen A. Schroder R. Carpen O. Furst D.O. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This vector encodes an N-terminal T7 tag and a C-terminal His tag for easy protein purification using affinity chromatography. The vinculin head (Vh), residues 1-716, D1-D3 wild type, and the D1-D3 A50I mutant were cloned into the pGEX-4T vector (GE Healthcare) encoding an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase tag (20Gingras A.R.

After expression in BL21 Codon Plus, His-tagged talin constructs were purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and glutathione S-transferase-tagged vinculin constructs on glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Protein interaction was tested in a pulldown assay. Magnetic protein G beads (25 μl, Invitrogen) preloaded with T7-antibody (1 μl, Novagen) were used to analyze binding of talin constructs to Vh D1-D3 or Vh D1-D3 A50I (100 μl in PBS, final concentration, 0.8 μm each). After incubation at 4 °C overnight, protein G beads were added for 2 h, and bound protein complexes were washed extensively in PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100. Beads were boiled in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer, and 5 μl of eluates were used for immunoblots. Negative controls without talin were treated in parallel. 4 μl of each protein interaction mix were kept and used as input control (total). Talin and vinculin constructs were detected with anti-T7 tag and hVin-1 antibody (Sigma), respectively, and secondary horseradish peroxidase anti-mouse Ig antibody (Dianova). Spot peptide analysis of Vh D1-D3 was performed using 50 nm recombinant protein as described (20Gingras A.R. Ziegler W.H. Frank R. Barsukov I.L. Roberts G.C. Critchley D.R. Emsley J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37217-37224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).Cell Culture—C2C12 myoblasts, mouse embryonal fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from vinculin knock-out mice (30Xu W. Baribault H. Adamson E.D. Development. 1998; 125: 327-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), MEF-Vcl null, and wild type MEF (controls) derived from littermates, MEF-wt, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (PAA Laboratories GmbH), 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), and 2 mm l-glutamine (PAA Laboratories GmbH). Subconfluent cells were split and seeded onto fibronectin (25 μg/ml)-coated glass coverslips. On the following day myoblast cells were transfected with talin pEGFP constructs using Nanofectin transfection reagent (PAA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To confirm protein size and integrity, expression of GFP-tagged talin constructs was controlled by immunoblot. Protein levels in transiently transfected populations ranged between 0.5- and 1.4-fold of talinC expression (data not shown).Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For immunostaining, the culture medium was removed 24 h after transfection, and cells were fixed directly in prewarmed 4% paraformaldehyde, PBS, washed in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, PBS. Cells were stained with an antibody raised against vinculin (hVin-1, Sigma) and with phalloidin-Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen). The goat anti-mouse-Alexa Fluor 568 conjugate (Invitrogen) was used as the secondary antibody. Micrographs were taken with a ZEISS Axiovert 200M inverted fluorescence microscope using the AxioVision Software (Version 4.6) and further processed in Photoshop CS2 (Adobe). To avoid bias in the interpretation of adhesion site targeting of talin constructs, three members of the laboratory assigned categories of “none,” “weak,” or “strong” to cells in a blinded fashion yielding identical results. In addition, obvious changes in the occurrence, position, or morphology of adhesion sites as well as the observation of protein aggregates were documented and reported together with the assignment.Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP)—Transfected C2C12 cells grown on fibronectin-coated coverslips were observed in an open heating chamber (Warner Instruments) mounted on an Olympus double scan-headed FluoView1000 confocal microscope equipped with a Plan-Apo 100×/1.45 oil objective and controlled by FV10-ASW software (Olympus). A 488-nm argon laser and 405-nm diode laser were used for enhanced GFP excitation and bleaching, respectively. The two scan heads allowed simultaneous bleaching and image acquisition. FRAP movies (one frame per 1.107 s) were taken as follows. Bleaching of enhanced GFP fluorescence in focal adhesions, which was done by a fast circular movement (“tornado tool”, Olympus software) of the 405-nm laser beam (∼1-2 frames long), was initiated 5 frames after the movie start, and recovery of fluorescence was recorded over time as indicated. For FRAP analysis, only peripheral focal adhesions of cells expressing low levels of GFP-tagged talin constructs and sufficient signal-to-noise ratio were selected. Expression of talin constructs used in this analysis did not affect occurrence, position, or morphology of adhesion sites unless otherwise indicated. Based on immunoblots and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, the expression of talin constructs in FRAP experiments was estimated to range from equal to moderately increased (2-3-fold overexpression) compared with endogenous talin.Image Processing and Statistical Analysis—FRAP movies were analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, rsb.info.nih.gov, Version 1.38). Movies showing clear focus drifts or focal adhesion site growth or dissolution were discarded. Regions of interest were defined, with one including the photobleached focal adhesion, and the average intensity was determined for all frames of the movie. Measured signals were corrected for background fluorescence and acquisition photobleaching and normalized as described (31Rabut G. Ellenberger J. Goldman R.D. Spector D.L. Live Cell Imaging: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2005: 101-126Google Scholar). Graph plots and statistical analyses were carried out using SigmaPlot 10 (Systat). Mono- and biexponential regression functions were used for the calculation of half-life times of recovery and protein mobility distributions of enhanced GFP-tagged talin fragments in focal adhesion sites.RESULTSFA Targeting of Talin—In cells, talin displays a prominent adhesion site localization assumed to represent the active protein and a large diffuse cytoplasmic pool reflecting the conformation of the protein “inactive” in ligand binding. Here, we employed GFP-tagged talin constructs to examine essential properties of the domains (Fig. 1, A and B). The isolated head region (residues 1-439), which binds to and activates integrins but cannot provide the mechanical link to the actin cytoskeleton in vivo (32Tanentzapf G. Brown N.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), did not localize discernibly to adhesion sites. Thus, ligand interactions of the talin rod appear to be required for adhesion site localization of the active protein. This was supported by the pronounced FA localization observed for the talin rod (residues 434-2541). However, the precise ligand interactions responsible for FA targeting of the rod remained unclear. Therefore, we generated three new constructs corresponding to proposed functional units of the rod which considered known or predicted boundaries of helical bundles (20Gingras A.R. Ziegler W.H.

These extended helical (H) bundles comprise (i) H1-H15, with multiple VBS helices and constitutive vinculin binding (33Patel B. Gingras A.R. Bobkov A.A. Fujimoto L.M. Zhang M. Liddington R.C.

F-actin binding as such was not expected to promote specific FA-localization, as subcellular positioning of ABS domains is not restricted to focal adhesions and leads to general actin filament decoration. All three talin rod constructs targeted to FAs, albeit with different efficiency (Fig. 1, A and B), indicating that active binding sites for either vinculin or β-integrins suffice to mediate some sort of localization. Consistently, FA targeting of a core IBS-2A four-helix bundle (H47-50, the proposed minimal integrin binding site) has been reported by Kieffer and co-workers (19Tremuth L. Kreis S. Melchior C.

Indeed, helix bundle boundaries in IBS-2B of the latter construct were not considered, so that this construct terminated in two “unsaturated” amphipathic helices H52-H53 (2140-2193), which may well negatively influence the IBS-2A bundle (H47-H51) and interfere with FA targeting. In contrast, recruitment of talin rod constructs comprising the complete C-terminal domain arrangement, IBS-2 and ABS-3 (H47-H62), termed talinC, was extremely pronounced and appeared to be more efficient than any of the other constructs tested either here or by others (19Tremuth L.

For this reason we decided to focus our further analyses investigating the mechanism(s) of FA localization on talinC as the key player in connecting talin to the cytoskeleton.Domain Structure and Binding Sites of TalinC—The domain structure of talinC has recently been solved by crystal structure and NMR analysis. TalinC consists of three five-helix bundles (Fig. 2A) and a C-terminal dimerization site (18Gingras A.R. Bate N. Goult B.T. Hazelwood L. Canestrelli I. Grossmann J.G. Liu H. Putz N.S. Roberts G.C.

The first two helical bundles (H47-H56), termed IBS-2A and IBS-2B, share a common helix with a distinct kink at its center and contain an integrin binding site, which has not yet been precisely mapped. The third helical bundle domain, ABS-3 (H57-H61), is functionally linked to a C-terminal helix responsible for dimerization (H62, DS). F-actin binding to ABS-3/DS is negatively regulated by helix H57 and strictly depends on dimerization (18Gingras A.R. Bate N. Goult B.T. Hazelwood L. Canestrelli I. Grossmann J.G. Liu H. Putz N.S.

The minimal requirement for localization is a four-helix bundle construct (H47-H50) from IBS-2A (19Tremuth L. Kreis S. Melchior C. Hoebeke J. Ronde P. Plancon S. Takeda K. Kieffer N. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2172002602,"The innate immune system plays an important role in protecting organs that are continuous with the outer surface of the body from bacterial infection. The antibacterial factors involved in this system have been sought in exocrine glands, particularly in the mammary glands. Because milk produced in the mammary glands is enriched in various nutrients, supporting the proliferation of bacteria, mammary glands appear to be at the greatest risk of bacterial infection and proliferation. Here, we show that mouse milk contains L-amino acid oxidase (LAO), a lactating mammary gland-specific protein that displays antibacterial activity in vitro through the production of hydrogen peroxide from free amino acids. We produced LAO-disrupted mouse lines to define the physiological properties and importance of the protein in vivo. The LAO-knockout mice were healthy and had normal mammary gland development; however, the antibacterial activity normally observed in milk from wild-type mice was absent from the milk of knockout mice. The content of free amino acids targeted by LAO was very low in wild-type milk, whereas these amino acids were abundant in LAO-knockout milk. Knockout mice exhibited weak resistance to an intramammary bacterial challenge compared to their wild-type counterparts. Further, preadministration of wild-type milk whey reduced the severity of bacterial infection in LAO-knockout mice. These results demonstrate that milk LAO protects the mammary gland against bacterial infection, and this antibacterial effect may be due to the generation of hydrogen peroxide by using free amino acids abundantly present in milk."
https://openalex.org/W1985359675,"Although human beings regularly experience fictional worlds through activities such as reading novels and watching movies, little is known about what mechanisms underlie our implicit knowledge of the distinction between reality and fiction. The first neuroimaging study to address this issue revealed that the mere exposure to contexts involving real entities compared to fictional characters led to engagement of regions in the anterior medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices (amPFC, PCC). As these core regions of the brain's default network are involved during self-referential processing and autobiographical memory retrieval, it was hypothesized that real entities may be conceptually coded as being more personally relevant to us than fictional characters.In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we directly test the hypothesis that entity-associated personal relevance is the critical factor underlying the differential engagement of these brain regions by comparing the brain's response when processing contexts involving family or friends (high relevance), famous people (medium relevance), or fictional characters (low relevance). In line with predictions, a gradient pattern of activation was observed such that higher entity-associated personal relevance was associated with stronger activation in the amPFC and the PCC.The results of the study have several important implications. Firstly, they provide informed grounds for characterizing the dynamics of reality-fiction distinction. Secondly, they provide further insights into the functions of the amPFC and the PCC. Thirdly, in view of the current debate related to the functional relevance and specificity of brain's default network, they reveal a novel approach by which the functions of this network can be further explored."
https://openalex.org/W2001113268,"Serum-starved, growth-arrested, near confluent rat mesangial cell cultures were stimulated to divide in medium with low (5.6 mM) or high (25.6 mM) glucose. In high glucose cultures Western blots showed large increases in cyclin D3 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) at 48-72 h, concurrent with the production of a monocyte-adhesive hyaluronan matrix, whereas low glucose and mannitol osmotic control cultures did not. Cyclin D3 small interfering RNA inhibited both the synthesis of this matrix and the up-regulation of C/EBPalpha in cultures exposed to high glucose, indicating that cyclin D3 is a key mediator in regulating responses of dividing mesangial cells to hyperglycemia. A complex with cyclin D3, cyclin-dependent kinase 4, and C/EBPalpha was observed at 48-72 h in the hyperglycemic cultures, and cyclin D3 and C/EBPalpha were spatially co-localized in coalesced perinuclear honeycomb-like structures with embedded hyaluronan. Furthermore, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3, a marker for autophagy, colocalizes with these structures. These results suggest that cyclin D3 is a central coordinator that controls the organization of a complex set of proteins that regulate autophagy, formation of the monocyte-adhesive hyaluronan matrix, and C/EBPalpha-mediated lipogenesis. Abnormal deposits of hyaluronan, cyclin D3, and C/EBPalpha were present in glomeruli of kidney sections from hyperglycemic rats 4 weeks after streptozotocin treatment, indicating that similar processes likely occur in vivo. Mesangial cell cultures treated with poly(I:C) or tunicamycin in normal glucose media synthesized monocyte-adhesive hyaluronan matrices but with concurrent down-regulation of cyclin D3. This indicates that the cyclin D3 mechanism is induced by hyperglycemia and is distinct from those involved in these cell stress responses."
https://openalex.org/W1975859629,"ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters transduce the free energy of ATP hydrolysis to power the mechanical work of substrate translocation across cell membranes. MsbA is an ABC transporter implicated in trafficking lipid A across the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. It has sequence similarity and overlapping substrate specificity with multidrug ABC transporters that export cytotoxic molecules in humans and prokaryotes. Despite rapid advances in structure determination of ABC efflux transporters, little is known regarding the location of substrate-binding sites in the transmembrane segment and the translocation pathway across the membrane. In this study, we have mapped residues proximal to the daunorubicin (DNR)-binding site in MsbA using site-specific, ATP-dependent quenching of DNR intrinsic fluorescence by spin labels. In the nucleotide-free MsbA intermediate, DNR-binding residues cluster at the cytoplasmic end of helices 3 and 6 at a site accessible from the membrane/water interface and extending into an aqueous chamber formed at the interface between the two transmembrane domains. Binding of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog inverts the transporter to an outward-facing conformation and relieves DNR quenching by spin labels suggesting DNR exclusion from proximity to the spin labels. The simplest model consistent with our data has DNR entering near an elbow helix parallel to the water/membrane interface, partitioning into the open chamber, and then translocating toward the periplasm upon ATP binding."
https://openalex.org/W1993258759,"Understanding the mechanisms that control synaptic efficacy through the availability of neurotransmitter receptors depends on uncovering their specific intracellular trafficking routes. gamma-Aminobutyric acid type B (GABA(B)) receptors (GABA(B)Rs) are obligatory heteromers present at dendritic excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic sites. It is unknown whether synthesis and assembly of GABA(B)Rs occur in the somatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) followed by vesicular transport to dendrites or whether somatic synthesis is followed by independent transport of the subunits for assembly and ER export throughout the somatodendritic compartment. To discriminate between these possibilities we studied the association of GABA(B)R subunits in dendrites of hippocampal neurons combining live fluorescence microscopy, biochemistry, quantitative colocalization, and bimolecular fluorescent complementation. We demonstrate that GABA(B)R subunits are segregated and differentially mobile in dendritic intracellular compartments and that a high proportion of non-associated intracellular subunits exist in the brain. Assembled heteromers are preferentially located at the plasma membrane, but blockade of ER exit results in their intracellular accumulation in the cell body and dendrites. We propose that GABA(B)R subunits assemble in the ER and are exported from the ER throughout the neuron prior to insertion at the plasma membrane. Our results are consistent with a bulk flow of segregated subunits through the ER and rule out a post-Golgi vesicular transport of preassembled GABA(B)Rs."

We have demonstrated previously that isoform 4b of the sarcolemmal calcium pump (PMCA4b) binds to nNOS in the heart and that this complex regulates β-adrenergic signal transmission in vivo. Here, we investigated whether the nNOS-PMCA4b complex serves as a specific signaling modulator in the heart. PMCA4b transgenic mice (PMCA4b-TG) showed a significant reduction in nNOS and total NOS activities as well as in cGMP levels in the heart compared with their wild type (WT) littermates. In contrast, PMCA4b-TG hearts showed an elevation in cAMP levels compared with the WT. Adult cardiomyocytes isolated from PMCA4b-TG mice demonstrated a 3-fold increase in Ser16 phospholamban (PLB) phosphorylation as well as Ser22 and Ser23 cardiac troponin I (cTnI) phosphorylation at base line compared with the WT. In addition, the relative induction of PLB phosphorylation and cTnI phosphorylation following isoproterenol treatment was severely reduced in PMCA4b-TG myocytes, explaining the blunted physiological response to the β-adrenergic stimulation. In keeping with the data from the transgenic animals, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes overexpressing PMCA4b showed a significant reduction in nitric oxide and cGMP levels. This was accompanied by an increase in cAMP levels, which led to an increase in both PLB and cTnI phosphorylation at base line. Elevated cAMP levels were likely due to the modulation of cardiac phosphodiesterase, which determined the balance between cGMP and cAMP following PMCA4b overexpression.

We have demonstrated that isoform 4b of the sarcolemmal calcium pump (also known as PMCA4b for plasma membrane calcium/calmodulin-dependent ATPase 4b) modulates signaling through a tight molecular interaction with nNOS, leading to the modulation of β-adrenergic responsiveness in the heart (12Oceandy D.

It has been speculated that these various localizations provide specificity to NO signaling, but the exact mechanisms have yet to be elucidated. In this study, we show a mechanism by which one fraction of nNOS serves highly specific functions through binding to PMCA4b. As PMCA4b is confined to the sarcolemma and is a calcium pump, it is the first identified protein to fulfill these aggregate functions. 1) It acts as an anchoring protein; 2) it regulates nNOS activity; and 3) it modulates a process at the plasma membrane, i.e. β-adrenergic signaling. Animals—We used transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of human PMCA4b under the control of the MLC-2v promoter as described previously (12Oceandy D. Cartwright E.J. Emerson M.

NRCM were maintained in medium supplemented with 1% serum prior to adenovirus infection. See supplemental “Methods” for detailed cell isolation protocol, intracellular calcium transient measurements, as well as cell-shortening measurements. Adenovirus—An adenovirus expressing human PMCA4b was a kind gift from Dr. Alex Maass (Wüerzburg, Germany). An nNOS-expressing virus was generated by cloning nNOS cDNA (a gift from Dr. David Bredt, San Fransisco, CA) to the pAd/CMV/V5-DEST vector (Invitrogen) using the Gateway pENTR vector as the shuttle system (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommended methods. An adenovirus expressing LacZ under the control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter was used as the control. Western Blotting—Heart tissues or primary cardiomyocytes were homogenized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% IGEPAL, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 20 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 500 ng/ml leupeptin, 1.0 μg/ml aprotinin, and 500 ng/ml pepstatin) and centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min to remove nuclear debris. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). 30 μg of protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Primary antibodies used for the Western blot analysis were as follows: polyclonal anti-PMCA4 (SWANT); monoclonal anti-PMCA (5F10), anti-soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), anti-protein kinase A (PKA), anti-cardiac troponin I, anti-phospho-Ser22/Ser23 troponin I, anti-PDE2, anti-PDE3, and anti-PDE4 (Abcam); anti-phospholamban and anti-phospho-Ser16 phospholamban (Upstate); and anti-nNOS (Affinity Bioreagents). Tubulin expression (detected using an antibody from Calbiochem) was used as a loading control. Levels of expression were determined using NIH ImageJ software. See supplemental “Methods” for the in vivo hemodynamic analysis, NOS activity assay, cGMP and cAMP measurements, immunofluorescence analysis, PKA activity assay, determination of intracellular nitric oxide bioavailability, and phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity assay.

Regulation of nNOS and Cyclic Nucleotides by PMCA4b in the Heart—We have described the interaction of PMCA4b and nNOS using a cellular model (17Schuh K. Uldrijan S. Telkamp M. Rothlein N. Neyses L.

Immunofluorescence analysis was used to further confirm the co-localization of PMCA4b and nNOS in the neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and adult mouse cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1A). We used transgenic mice overexpressing PMCA4b (PMCA4b-TG) to examine the regulatory role of PMCA4b in the nNOS-mediated signaling pathway in the heart. Total NOS and nNOS activity in the hearts of PMCA4b-TG mice and their wild type (WT) littermates were assessed by measuring the rate of conversion of l-[3H]arginine to l-[3H]citrulline in the presence or absence of either 1 mm N-ω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, a global NOS inhibitor, or 1 μm S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline (SMLT), a specific nNOS inhibitor. Total NOS and nNOS activities were significantly reduced in protein extracts isolated from PMCA4b-TG mice by 50 and 75%, respectively, compared with the wild type (n = 8; p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B). However, the nNOS protein expression remained unchanged in PMCA4b-TG mouse hearts compared with their WT littermates (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). sGC, which is responsible for converting GTP to cGMP, is known to be one of the major downstream effectors of nNOS, but a variety of NO effectors have been identified. We investigated whether overexpression of PMCA4b affects the cGMP level in the heart. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection of cGMP in cardiac tissue extracts demonstrated a significantly lower level of cGMP in protein extracts from PMCA4b-TG mice (Fig. 1C). Because the major cardiac phenotype of the PMCA4b-TG mice was the reduction of the β-adrenergic contractile response (12Oceandy D. Cartwright E.J. Emerson M. Prehar S. Baudoin F.M. Zi M. Alatwi N. Schuh K. Williams J.C. Armesilla A.L. Neyses L. Circulation. 2007; 115: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we then analyzed the levels of cAMP, which is the major regulator of the β-adrenergic pathway in cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, contrary to the cGMP level, the cAMP level was significantly elevated in PMCA4b-TG mice (Fig. 1D). Consistent with that finding, the activity of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) was increased in the transgenic hearts (Fig. 1E). The modifications of cGMP levels and PKA activity were likely due to modulation of enzyme activities rather than regulation of their expression, as expression levels of sGC and PKA were not altered in the transgenic mice (Fig. 1, F–G). Differential Activation of Phospholamban and Cardiac Troponin I Reduces the β-Adrenergic Contractile Response in PMCA4b-TG Mice—We examined the activation of phospholamban (PLB) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI), the two main targets of PKA phosphorylation. The levels of Ser16-phosphorylated phospholamban in isolated adult cardiomyocytes were examined in response to isoproterenol stimulation. The results shown in Fig. 2 suggest a difference in β-adrenergic responsiveness between PMCA4b-overexpressing and wild type myocytes. PMCA4b-overexpressing myocytes exhibited higher levels of phosphorylated PLB (Fig. 2, A–C) and cTnI (D–E) than wild type cells, mostly in unstimulated cells. However, the -fold increase of phosphorylation in both proteins in response to isoproterenol was significantly reduced in PMCA4b-TG myocytes, suggesting no further increase in β-adrenergic responsiveness. Alteration of Calcium Dynamics in PMCA4b-TG Myocytes—PMCA4b-TG myocytes displayed a slightly higher calcium amplitude and faster calcium decay rate at base line (Fig. 3, A–C). However, in response to isoproterenol, the transgenic myocytes showed no further increase in calcium amplitude (-2.2% in transgenic (TG) versus +45.5% in the WT) and in calcium decay (+5% in TG versus +32% in the WT). In contrast to the calcium measurement, the basal contractility and relaxation were not affected by PMCA4b overexpression as indicated by myocyte shortening (Fig. 3D) and in vivo hemodynamic (Fig. 3E) analyses. Similarly, the PMCA4b-TG mice demonstrated an attenuated inotropic response to the β-adrenergic agonist in vivo. As shown in Fig. 3F, following an increasing dose of isoproterenol infusion, PMCA4b-TG mice exhibited an attenuated increase in dP/dtmax, which is an index of contractility. These changes were not due to alterations in the expression of other major calcium transporters because the expression of the sodium calcium exchanger, SERCA (sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase), and L-type calcium channel in the heart of PMCA4b-TG animals remained the same as their WT littermates (supplemental Fig. 1, C and D). PMCA4b Inhibits Nitric Oxide (NO) and cGMP Production in Isolated Cardiomyocytes—To further study the mechanism by which the PMCA4b-nNOS interaction mediates β-adrenergic responsiveness, we generated a cellular model using isolated NRCM. An adenovirus system was used to overexpress PMCA4b and nNOS in NRCM. Fig. 4A shows overexpression of PMCA4b and nNOS in adenovirus-infected cells detected by Western blotting. Staining with the NO-sensitive dye DAF-FM demonstrated that cardiomyocytes overexpressing PMCA4b displayed significantly reduced NO levels compared with cells infected with the LacZ-expressing virus, which was used as a control. Furthermore, coexpression of PMCA4b blunted the increase in NO levels in cells overexpressing nNOS (Fig. 4, B–C). In keeping with this finding, we also demonstrated that the cGMP level was significantly lower in PMCA4b-overexpressing cardiomyocytes compared with controls (Fig. 4D). To examine whether this effect was due to modulation of sGC activity or its expression level, we determined sGC levels by Western blotting. No difference in expression level was observed in PMCA4b-overexpressing cells compared with controls (Fig. 4E). β-Adrenergic Response Is Altered in NRCM Overexpressing PMCA4b—To examine the β-adrenergic responsiveness in NRCM infected with the PMCA4b-expressing virus, the cells were treated with 2 μm isoproterenol, and the levels of PLB phosphorylation as well as cTnI phosphorylation were detected after 5 and 15 min of stimulation. Under no stimulation, PMCA4b-overexpressing cardiomyocytes exhibited significantly higher levels of Ser16 PLB phosphorylation as well as cTnI phosphorylation compared with the control cells (Fig. 5, A–D). However, similar to the data from PMCA4b-TG mice, no further elevation of either PLB or cTnI phosphorylation was observed in response to β-adrenergic stimulation in PMCA4b-overexpressing NRCM. nNOS Is Involved in Regulation of β-Adrenergic Responsiveness—To independently ascertain that modulation of nNOS is capable of modifying β-adrenergic signaling, we treated cardiomyocytes with the specific nNOS inhibitor SMLT (1 μm) for 60 min (before the addition of isoproterenol). In control cells at base line, specific inhibition of nNOS increased phospholamban phosphorylation to a level comparable with PMCA4b-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5E). Furthermore, the response to isoproterenol treatment was also attenuated in SMLT-treated control cells, which emulated the condition in PMCA4b-overexpressing cells. In addition, no further significant changes were observed in PMCA4b-overexpressing NRCM after treatment with SMLT. These findings suggested that the effect of PMCA4b overexpression on phospholamban phosphorylation is mainly due to an nNOS-dependent signaling cascade. PDE Activity Is Reduced in PMCA4b-overexpressing Cells—To elucidate the link between PMCA4b-nNOS/cGMP signaling and the β-adrenergic pathway in PMCA4b-overexpressing myocytes, we investigated the role of PDE. PDE are responsible for the degradation of cyclic nucleotides including cAMP and cGMP. We measured PDE activity in NRCM overexpressing PMCA4b. Compared with control cells, PMCA4b-overexpressing NRCM showed a significant reduction in PDE activity (Fig. 6A). Expression of PDE2, PDE3, and PDE4 were not different between cardiomyocytes overexpressing PMCA4b and control cells (data not shown), suggesting that the difference in PDE activity was due to modulation of its activity and not its expression level. Consistent with the data obtained from PMCA4b-TG mice, cAMP levels were elevated by ∼2-fold in PMCA4b-overexpressing cardiomyocytes compared with the control at base line (Fig. 6B). This difference was abolished in the presence of the nNOS-specific inhibitor SMLT. In addition, PKA activity was elevated in PMCA4b-overexpressing cells (Fig. 6C). Taken together, these data suggest that modulation of PDE activity by cGMP causes the increase in cAMP and hence increased PKA activity in PMCA4b-overexpressing cells, and this effect is dependent on the modulation of nNOS activity by PMCA4b. It is widely assumed that nNOS generates functionally diverse signals in the myocardium. These signals are likely dependent on its subcellular location (2Barouch L.A. Harrison R.W. Skaf M.W. Rosas G.O. Cappola T.P. Kobeissi Z.A. Hobai I.A. Lemmon C.A. Burnett A.L. O'Rourke B. Rodriguez E.R. Huang P.L. Lima J.A. Berkowitz D.E. Hare J.M.

Circulation. 2004; 110: 2368-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and its interacting partners. However, the molecular nature of these interacting protein partners and their functions has largely remained elusive. Here, we present insight into the mechanism by which one fraction of nNOS, i.e. the PMCA4b-bound nNOS, mediates signaling specificity. Our key finding is that in cardiomyocytes, the PMCA4b-nNOS complex governs cyclic nucleotide production, protein kinase A activity, and, ultimately, phosphorylation of proteins involved in the excitation-contraction coupling process such as PLB and cTnI. These biochemical changes led to alteration of calcium dynamics and reduction of β-adrenergic contractile response, as demonstrated in isolated myocytes as well as in intact animals, despite no alterations in SERCA, sodium calcium exchanger, or L-type calcium channel expression levels. In this study, by using PMCA4b-TG mice, as well as NRCM overexpressing PMCA4b, we demonstrated that both nNOS activity (but not the protein expression) and NO levels were decreased following PMCA4b overexpression. nNOS has been shown to be a powerful regulator of the β-adrenergic contractile response; deficiency of nNOS leads to reduction of the β-adrenergic contractile response (2Barouch L.A. Harrison R.W. Skaf M.W. Rosas G.O. Cappola T.P. Kobeissi Z.A. Hobai I.A. Lemmon C.A. Burnett A.L. O'Rourke B. Rodriguez E.R. Huang P.L. Lima J.A. Berkowitz D.E. Hare J.M.

Heart J. 2007; 28: 2792-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our data are in line with these findings, as PMCA4b overexpression leads to a reduction in nNOS activity, reduced NO levels, and a subsequent reduction of β-adrenergic responsiveness. Conversely, recent experiments in our laboratory have demonstrated that knockdown of PMCA4 using RNA interference in NRCM increases NO production; nNOS activity was also increased in PMCA4 knockout hearts compared with their WT littermates (data not shown). In line with the notion that sGC is the primary effector of NO from the nNOS-PMCA4b complex, our data demonstrate that overexpression of PMCA4b led to a reduction of cGMP production, both in intact hearts as well as in NRCM. We cannot completely exclude that other effectors of NO action, e.g. oxygen radical production and various protein nitrosylation reactions (reviewed in Ref. 19Saraiva R.M. Hare J.M. Curr. Opin. Cardiol. 2006; 21: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) also play a role, but the canonical pathway via sGC (20Murad F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 355: 2003-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) is sufficient to explain our findings both in vivo and in isolated cardiac cells. It is therefore likely that this is the predominant effector of NO generated from the interaction of PMCA4b and nNOS in the heart. In our models, cAMP levels were increased in intact hearts as well as in NRCM overexpressing PMCA4b. cAMP is the major second messenger in the β-adrenergic signaling pathway and activates PKA. We hypothesized that the well described cross-talk between cGMP and cAMP signaling (21Fischmeister R. Castro L.R. Abi-Gerges A. Rochais F. Jurevicius J. Leroy J. Vandecasteele G. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 816-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 22Zaccolo M. Movsesian M.A. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1569-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) might be crucial in determining the downstream effects of the PMCA4b-nNOS interaction. A growing body of evidence suggests that cGMP alters cAMP signaling by modulating PDE activity (22Zaccolo M. Movsesian M.A. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1569-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 23Mery P.F. Pavoine C. Belhassen L. Pecker F. Fischmeister R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26286-26295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PDE are a family of enzymes responsible for the degradation of cyclic nucleotides including cAMP and cGMP, though with varying affinity for each compound (21Fischmeister R. Castro L.R. Abi-Gerges A. Rochais F. Jurevicius J. Leroy J. Vandecasteele G. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 816-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 24Osadchii O.E. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 2007; 21: 171-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recent findings have demonstrated that some PDE isoforms such as PDE2 and PDE3 are regulated by cGMP, and this mechanism has been suggested as the link between cGMP and cAMP signaling (23Mery P.F. Pavoine C. Belhassen L. Pecker F. Fischmeister R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26286-26295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Surapisitchat J. Jeon K.I. Yan C. Beavo J.A. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). PDE2 is stimulated by cGMP (reviewed in Ref. 22Zaccolo M. Movsesian M.A. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1569-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar); therefore, the reduction in cGMP levels in our PMCA4b-overexpressing models provides a straightforward explanation for the decrease in PDE2 and hence total PDE activity. PDE2 has been shown to mainly control compartmentalized cAMP degradation in caveolae (26Mongillo M. Tocchetti C.G. Terrin A. Lissandron V. Cheung Y.F. Dostmann W.R. Pozzan T. Kass D.A. Paolocci N. Houslay M.D. Zaccolo M. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), where PMCA4b is localized (27Fujimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 28Hammes A. Oberdorf-Maass S. Rother T. Nething K. Gollnick F. Linz K.W. Meyer R. Hu K. Han H. Gaudron P. Ertl G. Hoffmann S. Ganten U. Vetter R. Schuh K. Benkwitz C. Zimmer H.G. Neyses L. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). PDE3, which is inhibited by cGMP (22Zaccolo M. Movsesian M.A. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1569-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), is also active in the myocardium. One possible explanation for our data is that NO and cGMP signals from the PMCA4b-nNOS complex are confined to a space not accessible to PDE3. This is in line with recent concepts of highly compartmentalized roles for PDE isoforms (21Fischmeister R. Castro L.R. Abi-Gerges A. Rochais F. Jurevicius J. Leroy J. Vandecasteele G. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 816-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). This issue is currently being addressed in our laboratory using fluorescence resonance energy transfer techniques, by which we will be able to demonstrate the activity of each individual PDE isoform at the membrane and the cytoplasmic compartments. As discussed in detail above, the PMCA4b-nNOS complex regulated the production of NO, cGMP, and cAMP. We subsequently examined the activity of PKA and the phosphorylation of both PLB and cTnI, which are the end targets of β-adrenergic stimulation. Increased PKA activity, as well as increased levels of phosphorylated PLB and cTnI, have been shown both in transgenic animals and in cardiomyocytes overexpressing PMCA4b at base line (before β-adrenergic stimulation). Interestingly, PLB phosphorylation and cTnI phosphorylation in response to isoproterenol induction were attenuated in PMCA4b-overexpressing myocytes, which is in agreement with the in vivo data showing that a blunted β-adrenergic contractile response in PMCA4b-TG mice. Because the increase of PLB phosphorylation and cTnI phosphorylation at base line was considerable, most of the PLB and cTnI in transgenic myocytes were phosphorylated at base line, and so no significant relative increase in phosphorylation was detectable following isoproterenol stimulation. This phenotype resembles PLB knock-out mice, in which ablation of PLB led to the attenuation of the β-adrenergic contractile response by a conceptually similar mechanism (25Surapisitchat J. Jeon K.I. Yan C. Beavo J.A. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These data are also in agreement with results from Burkard et al. (29Burkard N. Rokita A.G. Kaufmann S.G. Hallhuber M. Wu R. Hu K. Hofmann U. Bonz A. Frantz S. Cartwright E.J. Neyses L. Maier L.S. Maier S.K. Renne T. Schuh K. Ritter O. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: e32-e44Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) showing a significant decrease in Ser16 PLB phosphorylation in conditional cardiac-specific nNOS overexpressing mice. On the other hand, a recent paper demonstrated that in nNOS knockout mice, PLB phosphorylation was reduced (30Zhang Y.H. Zhang M.H. Sears C.E. Emanuel K. Redwood C. El-Armouche A. Kranias E.G. Casadei B. Circ. Res. 2008; 102: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These data are not contradictory, as in nNOS knockout mice, nNOS was deleted from all localizations, whereas our studies specifically addressed the sarcolemma-bound nNOS-PMCA4b complex. As a result of increased Ser16 PLB phosphorylation in PMCA4 TG mice, it was expected that the baseline intracellular calcium transients as well as the contractility would be elevated. Transgenic cardiomyocytes overexpressing PMCA4b indeed showed an increase in baseline calcium transient amplitude. However, cell shortening and in vivo contractility showed no significant difference compared with the WT. This means that PMCA4b-overexpressing cardiomyocytes did not respond to the increased calcium transient. This might be explained by the increased phosphorylation of cTnI. It is well known that PKA-dependent phosphorylation of cTnI reduces myofibril sensitivity to calcium (31Wattanapermpool J. Guo X. Solaro R.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 1383-1391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Moreover, two independent groups have reported that transgenic replacement of native cTnI with the β-adrenergic phospho-mimetic cTnI (to mimic constitutive phosphorylation) resulted in the reduction of cardiomyocyte calcium sensitivity (32Takimoto E. Soergel D.G. Janssen P.M. Stull L.B. Kass D.A. Murphy A.M. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 33Yasuda S. Coutu P. Sadayappan S. Robbins J. Metzger J.M. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that increased PKA-dependent phosphorylation of cTnI leads to a reduction in myofilament calcium sensitivity and blunted β-adrenergic response (34Tavernier B. Li J.M. El-Omar M.M. Lanone S. Yang Z.K. Trayer I.P. Mebazaa A. Shah A.M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 294-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, the increased phosphorylation of cTnI in PMCA4b-TG hearts may desensitize the myofibril to calcium and may compensate for the effect of the small increase in calcium transient (for more explanation, see supplemental “Discussion”). Moreover, as we have previously suggested that PMCA4 regulates local calcium levels (reviewed in Ref. 11Oceandy D. Stanley P.J. Cartwright E.J. Neyses L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 927-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the global calcium transient may not reflect its true role, and we are currently developing PMCA4-based local calcium sensors to address this question. In summary, our present data unravel a novel molecular mechanism by which spatially confined nNOS signal specificity is achieved. PMCA4b anchors nNOS to caveolae and reduces nNOS activity. This leads to the reduction of cGMP, an increase in cAMP generation, and a subsequently altered β-adrenergic responsiveness (Fig. 7). In light of these and other recent data (1Sears C.E. Bryant S.M.

Furthermore, nNOS interaction with non-PMCA proteins, such as CAPON and α1-syntrophin (7Ueda K. Valdivia C. Medeiros-Domingo A. Tester D.J. Vatta M. Farrugia G. Ackerman M.J. Makielski J.C. Proc.

Using a gene targeting approach, we generated a knock-in mouse line, in which N-terminal hemagglutinin epitope-tagged α2A-adrenergic receptor (AR) expression was driven by the endogenous mouse α2AAR gene locus. Exploiting this mouse line, we evaluated α2AAR trafficking and α2AAR-mediated inhibition of Ca2+ currents in native sympathetic neurons in response to clonidine and guanfacine, two drugs used for treatment of hypertension, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, and enhancement of analgesia through actions on the α2AAR subtype. We discovered a more rapid desensitization of Ca2+ current suppression by clonidine than guanfacine, which paralleled a more marked receptor phosphorylation and endocytosis of α2AAR evoked by clonidine than by guanfacine. Clonidine-induced α2AAR desensitization, but not receptor phosphorylation, was attenuated by blockade of endocytosis with concanavalin A, indicating a critical role for internalization of α2AAR in desensitization to this ligand.

Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating downstream signaling, ligand binding to a receptor can initiate phosphorylation of the active conformation of the receptor by G protein receptor kinases (GRKs) and subsequent binding of arrestins, thus restricting the magnitude and duration of the ligand-evoked signaling responses (2Kohout T.A.

However, the lack of available tools to study trafficking of endogenous GPCRs in native target cells has limited our understanding of ligand-selective endocytosis profiles and the relative contribution of receptor endocytosis to desensitization in native biological settings. To specifically test hypotheses regarding ligand-selective effects on GPCR internalization, and functional consequences of this trafficking on signaling, we utilized a homologous recombination gene targeting strategy to introduce a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged wild type α2A-adrenergic receptor (AR) into the mouse ADRA2A gene locus (“knock-in”). The α2AAR is a prototypical GPCR that couples to the Gi/o subfamily of G proteins (15Limbird L.E. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2686-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Studies on genetically engineered mice made null or mutant for the α2AAR have revealed that this subtype mediates the therapeutic effects of α2-adrenergic agents on blood pressure, pain perception, volatile anesthetic sparing, analgesia, and working memory enhancement (16MacDonald E. Kobilka B.K. Scheinin M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 211-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 17Hein L. Limbird L.E. Eglen R.M. Kobilka B.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Two classic α2-ligands, clonidine and guanfacine, have been widely used to treat hypertension (19Sica D.A. J. Clin. Hypertens. (Greenwich.). 2007; 9: 399-405Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar), attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (20Banaschewski T. Roessner V. Dittmann R.W. Santosh P.J. Rothenberger A. Eur. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry. 2004; 13: I102-I116PubMed Google Scholar), and to elicit analgesia (19Sica D.A. J. Clin. Hypertens. (Greenwich.). 2007; 9: 399-405Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 21Cormack J.R. Orme R.M. Costello T.G. J. Clin. Neurosci. 2005; 12: 375-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) mediated via the α2AAR. Clinically guanfacine has a much longer duration of action than clonidine (22Man in't Veld A.J. van den Meiracker A.H. van Zwieten P.A. Greenlee W.J. Antihypertensive Drugs. Harwood Academic Publishers, Newark, NJ1997: 427-462Google Scholar, 23Scahill L. Barloon L. Farkas L. J. Child Adolesc. Psychiatr.

Springer Publishing Co., New York2001: 507-542Crossref Google Scholar); this longer duration of action cannot be accounted for by the pharmacokinetic profile of these agents in human beings, as both drugs have a half-life of 12-14 h (25Oates J.A. Brown N.J. Hardman J.G. Limbird L.E. Gilman A.G. Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. 10th Ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York2001: 871-900Google Scholar, 26Carchman S.H. Crowe Jr., J.T. Wright G.J. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1987; 27: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because ligand-induced desensitization and trafficking of GPCRs have been implicated as critical mechanisms for modulating response duration in vivo (3Gainetdinov R.R. Premont R.T. Bohn L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), one hypothesis underlying the difference in duration between clonidine and guanfacine is that clonidine provokes accelerated desensitization of the α2AAR via one or several mechanisms, whereas guanfacine does not. Signaling desensitization in response to these two agonists has not been compared under the same experimental settings. To specifically test this hypothesis, we have exploited our HA-α2AAR knock-in mice so that we could examine these properties of guanfacine and clonidine in native target cells. We compared internalization of the α2AAR and inhibition of Ca2+ currents induced by clonidine and guanfacine in primary superior cervical ganglia (SCG) neurons, where the α2AAR is the major adrenergic receptor subtype controlling norepinephrine release and sympathetic tone (17Hein L. Limbird L.E. Eglen R.M. Kobilka B.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 881: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27Surprenant A. Horstman D.A. Akbarali H. Limbird L.E. Science. 1992; 257: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Our data revealed a differential regulation of α2AAR trafficking and signaling duration by clonidine versus guanfacine, i.e. clonidine induced a more dramatic desensitization of the α2AAR than guanfacine, and this desensitization was largely because of α2AAR internalization. These studies reveal the powerful tool that the HA-α2AAR knock-in mice provide for identifying endocytosis-dependent and -independent physiological phenomena for this receptor subtype as a first step in defining novel loci for therapeutic intervention in the α2AAR signaling/trafficking cascade. Generation of the HA-α2AAR Knock-in Mice—An ADRA2A gene targeting vector was constructed with an HA sequence inserted at the 5′-end of the coding region and a neo resistance gene flanked by two loxP sites (cf. Fig. 1). The vector was introduced into sv129 embryonic stem cells via electroporation. Chimeric mice were generated by injection of targeted embryonic stem cells, and then crossed with C57Bl/6 mice to obtain F1 heterozygotes, which were further intercrossed to obtain homozygotes for verification of successful targeting. Electroporation and embryonic stem cell injection were performed by the Vanderbilt University Transgenic Core facility. To have the neo gene excised out of the targeted genome, F1 heterozygotes were crossed with CMV-cre mice (28Schwenk F. Baron U. Rajewsky K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5080-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar) (backcrossed for 10 generations to C57Bl/6 background, generously provided by Dr. Mark Magnuson, Vanderbilt University). Cre recombinase catalyzes site-specific DNA recombination between the 34-bp recognition (loxP) sites, such as those with which we flanked the neo locus in our studies. In the strain of Cre mice used in our studies, the level of Cre expression is stable and sufficient to mediate deletion of any loxP-flanked locus in all cells of the body. Heterozygous knock-in mice encoding neither neo nor Cre genes were backcrossed to C57Bl/6 background for 10 generations and then intercrossed to generate homozygotes, which were fertile and developed normally. Southern Analysis—Southern analysis was performed as described previously (29MacMillan L.B. Hein L. Smith M.S. Piascik M.T. Limbird L.E. Science. 1996; 273: 801-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). DNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using Prime-It II random primer labeling kit (Stratagene), and genomic DNA blots were hybridized using QuikHyb solution (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. Radioligand Binding—Receptor density in WT and HA-α2AAR knock-in mouse brains was evaluated by saturation binding of [3H]Rx821002 (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (29MacMillan L.B. Hein L. Smith M.S. Piascik M.T. Limbird L.E. Science. 1996; 273: 801-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The intrinsic affinity of the α2AAR for different ligands was assessed by competition binding of [3H]RX821002, as described (29MacMillan L.B. Hein L. Smith M.S. Piascik M.T. Limbird L.E. Science. 1996; 273: 801-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 30Tan C.M. Wilson M.H. MacMillan L.B. Kobilka B.K. Limbird L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24935-24940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). [35S]GTPγS Binding—[35S]GTPγS binding assays were performed as described previously (32Bohn L.M.

Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1035-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) to assess activation of G proteins by endogenous or knock-in HA-tagged α2AAR in brain particulate preparations. WT or knock-in mouse brains were dissected and homogenized in membrane preparation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm MgCl2). Particulate preparations were prepared by centrifugation of this homogenate at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. After three washes in the same buffer, the particulate preparation was resuspended in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA) containing 10 μm GDP and 150 pm [35S]GTPγS (1250 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). [35S]GTPγS binding in response to the endogenous adrenergic agonist, epinephrine, was assessed in the presence of 1 μm prazosin (to block α1, α2B, and α2CAR) and 1 μm propranolol (to block β-adrenergic receptors in the preparation). The percent stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding was calculated by dividing each epinephrine-stimulated data point by the amount of signal for unstimulated (“basal”) [35S]GTPγS binding. [35S]GTPγS binding assays were also performed using HEK cells stably expressing the murine HA-α2AAR (31Schramm N.L. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24935-24940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), as described previously (30Tan C.M. Wilson M.H. MacMillan L.B. Kobilka B.K. Limbird L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12471-12476Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Localization of HA-α2AAR in Brain and SCG Using Immunofluorescence—Adult male WT or HA-α2AAR knock-in mice were transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Following post-fixation, 30 μm coronal sections of brain were sliced on a cryostat (Leica CM3050 S). Thirty micron sections of SCG were sliced on a microtome (Microm, HM400). Sections were then free-floated in wells of a 24-well plate for immunolabeling. Sections were blocked with 4% normal donkey serum containing 0.2% Triton X-100 before incubation with primary antibody (mouse HA.11 antibody, Covance, 1:500-1:1000) for 48 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with cyanine dye-conjugated secondary antibody (Cy2-conjugated donkey anti-mouse, Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:1000) for 24 h at 4 °C. Sections were mounted on slides, sealed with PolyAquamount, and left overnight to dry. Images were taken with a Leica LSM-510 confocal microscope. Laser intensity was kept constant in comparing samples from the two genotypes. Primary Culture of SCG Neurons—Primary cultures of SCG neurons were obtained from postnatal day 3-5 HA-α2AAR knock-in mouse pups as described (34Brum P.C. Hurt C.M. Shcherbakova O.G. Kobilka B. Angelotti T. Neuropharmacology. 2006; 51: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In brief, SCG were dissected into L-15 medium (Invitrogen). After digestion with collagenase and trypsin (Sigma) in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen), SCG were triturated with a polished Pasteur pipette, and cells were passed through a 40-μm strainer (Fisher). Following preplating on a noncoated culture dish to remove glial cells and fibroblasts, neurons were plated on coverslips pre-coated with poly-d-lysine and laminin (Sigma) in a 24-well plate in L-15 medium containing 10% NuSerum (Clontech), 30% glucose, 24 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm glutamine, insulin/transferrin/sodium selenite media supplement (Sigma), and 25 ng/ml nerve growth factor (Invitrogen). Medium was changed every 3 days, with addition of 2 μm Ara-C (Sigma) to eliminate glial cell growth on the 2nd day. Immunofluorescence and electrophysiology experiments were performed on neurons cultured for 7-8 days in vitro, when α2AAR was delivered to the cell surface (34Brum P.C. Hurt C.M. Shcherbakova O.G. Kobilka B. Angelotti T. Neuropharmacology. 2006; 51: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Localization of WT-α2AAR Versus HA-α2AAR in Cultured SCG Neurons by Immunocytochemistry—SCG neurons were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% sucrose and 3% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 15 min on ice and then permeabilized in PBST buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100) for 30 min at room temperature with the buffer changed every 10 min. Following blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin/PBST, neurons were incubated with antibodies against the C-terminal tail of endogenous α2AAR (generously provided by Dr. Brian Kobilka, Stanford University) or HA.11 antibody (1-2 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. After washes, AlexaFluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) were used to detect WT-α2AAR and HA-α2AAR, respectively. Images were acquired on a Leica confocal microscope with identical settings for both genotypes. Quantitative Assessment of HA-α2AAR Trafficking in Native SCG Neurons—Antibody labeling and quantitative fluorescent studies were performed as described previously (35Xu J. Chen Y. Lu R. Cottingham C. Jiao K. Wang Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14516-14523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). SCG neurons were first incubated with HA.11 antibody (10 μg/ml) for 12 min at room temperature to label cell surface HA-α2AAR (no ligand-independent internalization was detected during the labeling). After washing off unbound antibodies, cells were treated with or without clonidine or guanfacine for various time periods followed by fixation and permeabilization. Although the α2AAR is the major subtype expressed on the surface of SCGs cultured 7-8 days in vitro (34Brum P.C. Hurt C.M. Shcherbakova O.G. Kobilka B. Angelotti T. Neuropharmacology. 2006; 51: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 36Vidovic M. Cohen D. Hill C.E. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 22: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), 10-6 m prazosin was included in all trafficking experiments to ensure no potential activation of α2B- or α2CAR subtypes by clonidine or guanfacine. AlexaFluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Invitrogen) was used to detect HA-α2AAR labeled with HA.11 antibody. Images were obtained using a Leica confocal microscope, and all images were captured under identical microscope settings. Total and intracellular fluorescence intensities were quantified using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices) as described previously (37Brady A.E. Wang Q. Allen P.B. Rizzo M. Greengard P. Limbird L.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1690-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Relative units of internalization were measured as internal/total fluorescence normalized to untreated controls. Neurons from at least three independent experiments were analyzed. Electrophysiology and Data Analysis—Ca2+ currents were recorded in cultured SCG neurons using standard whole-cell voltage clamp methods with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instrument) as described previously (38Diverse-Pierluissi M. Inglese J. Stoffel R.H. Lefkowitz R.J. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1996; 16: 579-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 39Li Y. Wu Y. Zhou Y. Neuron. 2006; 51: 755-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). No significant difference was observed between neurons cultured from HA-α2AAR knock-in and WT mice in terms of Ca2+ current properties, acute response, and time course of Ca2+ current inhibition by different α2-agonists. To correlate with the trafficking studies, the electrophysiological studies were performed in SCG neurons cultured from HA-α2AAR knock-in mice. Cells were bathed in an external solution containing (in mm) 133 NaCl, 1 CaCl2, 0.8 MgCl2, 25 HEPES (pH 7.4), 12.5 NaOH, 5 glucose, 10 tetraethylammonium chloride, and 0.3 μm tetrodotoxin. Patch electrodes with resistances of 2-4 megohms were pulled from borosilicate glass and filled with an internal solution containing (in mm) 150 CsCl, 5 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 5 Mg-ATP, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.2). Whole-cell Ca2+ currents were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 20 kHz. Data acquisition and analysis were performed with pCLAMP9 software. The inhibition of Ca2+ currents induced by clonidine or guanfacine was measured using a two-pulse protocol as described previously (40Elmslie K.S. Zhou W. Jones S.W. Neuron. 1990; 5: 75-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 41Jeong S.W. Ikeda S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The extent of inhibition was calculated as the difference in the peak current amplitude between the control current and that preceded by a brief depolarizing prepulse to 100 mV. To assess the time course and extent of desensitization of the clonidine- or guanfacine-evoked effect, inward currents were repetitively evoked every 20-40 s in the presence of clonidine or guanfacine. Recordings were made both in the presence and absence of prazosin (which blocks the α2B- and α2CAR subtypes). The presence of prazosin had no significant effect on the inhibition of Ca2+ currents by clonidine or guanfacine, confirming an α2AAR-mediated process (42Lakhlani P.P. MacMillan L.B. Guo T.Z. McCool B.A. Lovinger D.M. Maze M. Limbird L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9950-9955Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The peak inhibition of Ca2+ currents by clonidine in the presence and absence of prazosin is 26.03 ± 1.85 (n = 15) and 30.07 ± 2.45 (n = 9), respectively, p = 0.26. The peak inhibition of Ca2+ currents by guanfacine in the presence and absence of prazosin is 24.42 ± 2.16 (n = 14) and 28.16 ± 2.51 (n = 9), respectively, p = 0.31. All recordings were normalized to Ca2+ rundown. To block receptor internalization, neurons were preincubated with ConA (160 μg/ml) or PAO (10 μm) for 20 min before recording and addition of ligands. Intact Cell Receptor Phosphorylation—Intact cell phosphorylation of HA-α2AAR in response to different agonists was performed as described previously (43Wang Q. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50589-50596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) using HEK293 cells stably expressing murine HA-α2AAR (31Schramm N.L. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24935-24940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cells prelabeled with [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were stimulated for 20 min with or without clonidine or guanfacine, and cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-HA antibody. Immunoprecipitates were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography (for phosphorylation) or Western analysis (for total HA-α2AAR protein). To examine the effect of ConA on α2AAR phosphorylation, cells were pretreated with 160 μg/ml ConA before agonist stimulation. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed with the GraphPad Prism software using Student's t tests. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Generation and Characterization of HA-α2AAR Knock-in Mice—We utilized a homologous recombination gene targeting strategy to introduce the HA epitope-tagged wild type α2AAR into the mouse ADRA2A gene locus (knock-in). The N-terminal HA epitope, which provides an extracellular “tag” readily detectable by commercial antibodies, has been widely used to tag GPCRs, including the α2AR subtypes (44Keefer J.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11340-11347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), without altering receptor trafficking and signaling. The gene targeting strategy is illustrated in Fig. 1A. Southern and PCR analyses of mouse tail DNA demonstrate successful generation of the final HA-α2AAR knock-in mouse line (Fig. 1, B and C). Expression density of HA-α2AAR in the knock-in mice, which is controlled by the endogenous ADRA2A locus, was indistinguishable from that of the α2AAR in WT mice, based on saturation binding analysis for the α2AAR in particulate preparations from the brains of WT or HA-α2AAR knock-in mice (Fig. 1D). Similarly, affinity for the endogenous ligand, epinephrine, was indistinguishable between the HA-α2AAR in knock-in mice and α2AAR in WT mice, as revealed by competition binding studies (Fig. 1E). Moreover, the addition of an N-terminal HA tag did not affect the ability of the HA-α2AAR to activate G proteins in response to epinephrine in native tissues, as demonstrated by epinephrine-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding assays on brain particulate preparations from knock-in or WT mice (Fig. 1F). These data indicate that the knock-in HA-α2AAR is expressed at the same density, shows identical affinity for the endogenous agonist, and exhibits indistinguishable intrinsic activity in activating endogenous G proteins as the α2AAR in WT mice. Therefore, the HA-α2AAR knock-in mouse provides an elegant model to examine α2AAR trafficking and signaling in native cells expressing the endogenous receptor at its characteristic physiological density. Distribution of Knock-in HA-α2AAR in Mouse Brain and SCG—Using an HA antibody and a fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody, we were able to examine the distribution of HA-α2AAR in knock-in mouse brain slices. Fluorescent signals were readily detected in the lateral septum, locus coeruleus, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (Fig. 2A), as well as in the nucleus tractus solitarius and cortex (data not shown) of the knock-in brain, areas where α2AAR mRNA transcription was previously reported (45Wang R.X. Limbird L.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As expected, no positive signal for the HA epitope was detected in corresponding areas of the brain obtained from WT mice (Fig. 2A). Strong immunofluorescent signals also were detected in the SCG of knock-in mice. In the SCG, over 95% of the neurons are adrenergic (46Yamauchi A. Lever J.D. Kemp K.W. J. Anat. 1973; 114: 271-282PubMed Google Scholar) and labeled by an antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase (Fig. 2B). The HA-α2AAR is mainly localized on the surface of neuronal cell bodies and neuronal fibers (Fig. 2B). In cultured SCG neurons from knock-in mice, the distribution pattern of HA-α2AAR (Fig. 2C) in the absence and presence of agonist stimulation is indistinguishable from that of the α2AAR obtained from WT mice (Fig. 2D). WT α2AAR was detected by an antibody directed against the C-terminal tail of the α2AAR (34Brum P.C. Hurt C.M. Shcherbakova O.G. Kobilka B. Angelotti T. Neuropharmacology. 2006; 51: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These data confirm that the knock-in HA-α2AAR can be reliably used for examining α2AAR trafficking in native SCG neurons in parallel with our functional studies. Clonidine and Guanfacine Differentially Promote α2AAR Internalization in Primary Cultured SCG Neurons—We examined surface HA-α2AAR trafficking in response to stimulation by clonidine or guanfacine in cultured SCG neurons. Following 5 min of treatment with 10-6 m clonidine or guanfacine, in"

The connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2), which is increased in these pathologies, induces the production of extracellular matrix proteins. To understand the fibrotic process observed in diverse pathologies, we analyzed the fibroblast response to CTGF when MMP-2 activity is inhibited. CTGF increased fibronectin (FN) amount, MMP-2 mRNA expression, and gelatinase activity in 3T3 cells. When MMP-2 activity was inhibited either by the metalloproteinase inhibitor GM-6001 or in MMP-2-deficient fibroblasts, an increase in the basal amount of FN together with a decrease of its levels in response to CTGF was observed. This paradoxical effect could be explained by the fact that the excess of FN could block the access to other ligands, such as CTGF, to integrins. This effect was emulated in fibroblasts by adding exogenous FN or RGDS peptides or using anti-integrin αV subunit-blocking antibodies. Additionally, in MMP-2-deficient cells CTGF did not induce the formation of stress fibers, focal adhesion sites, and ERK phosphorylation. Anti-integrin αV subunit-blocking antibodies inhibited ERK phosphorylation in control cells. Finally, in MMP-2-deficient cells, FN mRNA expression was not affected by CTGF, but degradation of 125I-FN was increased. These results suggest that expression, regulation, and activity of MMP-2 can play an important role in the initial steps of fibrosis and shows that FN levels can regulate the cellular response to CTGF.

This mechanism is an important form of regulation of gelatinase activity and in consequence, highly significant for ECM homeostasis. Among the members of the MMP family, the metalloproteinase type 2 (MMP-2 or gelatinase A) is known to be a key player in many physiological and pathological processes, such as cell migration, inflammation, angiogenesis, and fibrosis (8Matrisian L.M.

Fibrotic disorders are typified by excessive connective tissue and ECM deposition that precludes normal healing of different tissues. ECM accumulation can be explained in two ways: increasing expression and deposition of connective tissue proteins and/or decreasing degradation of ECM proteins (12Arthur M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G245-G249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transforming growth factor type β, a multifunctional cytokine, is strongly overexpressed, and it is associated to the pathogenesis of these diseases (13Roberts A.B. McCune B.K. Sporn M.B.

It has been shown that transforming growth factor type β induces an increase in the amount of MMP-2 in fibroblasts (35Overall C.M. Wrana J.L. Sodek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1860-1869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that CTGF induces MMP-2 expression in cultured renal interstitial fibroblasts (36Yang M. Huang H. Li J. Huang W. Wang H. Wound Repair Regen. 2007; 15: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The putative role assigned to MMP-2 in fibrotic disorders is related to tissue regeneration because of the capacity of this enzyme to degrade basal lamina (37Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V. Science. 1997; 277: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 38Knittel T. Mehde M. Grundmann A. Saile B. Scharf J.G. Ramadori G. Histochem.

Disord. 2007; 8: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because MMP-2 expression is up-regulated in these pathologies but still a high ECM deposition is observed, we propose that this accumulation could be explained by a diminution of the MMP-2 enzymatic activity. In this article, we demonstrate that CTGF increases fibronectin (FN) amount, MMP-2 expression, and gelatinase activity in 3T3 fibroblasts. More significantly, we show that MMP-2-deficient cells have an increased basal amount of FN and show a response to CTGF that is opposite to that of control cells. This paradoxical effect could be explained by the increase in the FN amount that blocks the integrins (at least integrins with αV subunit), which can act like CTGF receptors. Cell Culture—NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were treated with recombinant purified CTGF (40Vial C. Zuniga L.M. Cabello-Verrugio C. Canon P. Fadic R. Brandan E. J. Cell Physiol. 2008; 215: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) for 24 h in serum-free medium. The metalloproteinase inhibitor GM-6001 (BioMol) was used at 25 μm in the same conditions. The cells were treated with 200 nm FN (Sigma) for 24 h and then washed and incubated with CTGF in serum-free medium for 24 h. RGDS peptides (Sigma) were added at 0.2 mg/ml together with CTGF in serum-free medium for 24 h. In the experiments using blocking antibodies, the cells were pretreated with 5 μg/ml of anti-integrin-αV (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 48 h and then incubated with CTGF for 15 min to evaluate phospho-ERK induction or 24 h to determine FN accumulation. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription—Total RNA was isolated from cell cultures using TRIzol™ reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Relative Quantitative PCR—Reverse transcriptase reaction was performed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). We designed PCR primers based on the previously published mouse mRNA sequence for MMP-2 (GI 47271505). The primers were: sense, 5′-GGCAACCCAGATGTGGCCAAC-3′, and antisense, 5′-AGATCTCACCACGGATCTGAGC-3′. For the FN expression experiments primers previously described were used (41Werbajh S.E. Urtreger A.J. Puricelli L.I. de Lustig E.S. Bal de Kier Joffe E. Kornblihtt A.R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The relative quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (rqPCR) experiments were performed using a QuantumRNA™ Classic II 18 S internal standard kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Ambion). Zymography—Gelatin zymography experiments were performed as described previously (42Makowski G.S. Ramsby M.L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Gelatinase Activity Assay—Gelatinase activity assays were performed as described previously using biotinylated gelatin as substrate (43Ratnikov B. Deryugina E. Leng J. Marchenko G. Dembrow D. Strongin A. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity was represented as (A30 - A0/mg) × fV, where A30 is the absorbance of the sample after 30 min of incubation with the substrate; A0 is the absorbance of the sample at time 0; mg is the amount of protein/well, and fV is the ratio between the total volume of conditioned medium in the well and the volume used in the assay. MMP-2 Knockdown 3T3 Cells—Short hairpin (shRNA) expression vectors were constructed and packaged into recombinant lentivirus using the BLOCK-iT lentiviral RNA interference expression system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The target sequence for the shRNA against MMP-2 was 5′-AGTTGGCAGTGCAATACCTGA-3′ (44Auge N. Maupas-Schwalm F. Elbaz M. Thiers J.C. Waysbort A. Itohara S. Krell H.W. Salvayre R. Negre-Salvayre A. Circulation. 2004; 110: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The pLenti6-U6-shMMP2 vector and the packaging plasmid mixture were introduced into 293FT packaging cells provided within the kit. The recombinant lentiviruses in the conditioned medium were harvested and titrated using 3T3 cells. Transductions were performed at a multiplicity of infection of 50, and the cells were propagated and maintained with 10 μg/ml blasticidin. The target gene knockdown was confirmed by relative quantitative PCR and zymography. A stable cell line expressing a scramble sequence was made as control. Western Blot—Western blot experiments were performed as described previously (45Cabello-Verrugio C. Brandan E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18842-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The antibodies used were anti-FN (Sigma) (1/10.000), anti-collagen III (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1/400), anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling) (1/1000), anti-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling) (1/1000), and anti-tubulin (Sigma) (1/10.000). Immunofluorescence—Cells to be immunostained were grown on coverslips. The medium was removed, and the coverslips were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 25 °C, incubated for 1 h in blocking solution (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 8% bovine serum albumin), and then incubated with polyclonal anti-FN (Sigma) (1/1000) or anti-vinculin (Sigma) (1/250). The cells were rinsed with blocking solution and further incubated for 1 h with anti-rabbit Alexa 488-conjugated antibody (Invitrogen) (1/1000) or anti-mouse Alexa 568 (Invitrogen) (1/1000) diluted in blocking solution. For nuclear staining, the sections were treated with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. For actin staining, the cells were incubated with fluorescein-labeled phalloidin (Sigma) for 10 min. After rinsing, the coverslips were mounted using fluorescent mounting medium (DAKO) and viewed under a Nikon Diaphot microscope equipped for epifluorescence (45Cabello-Verrugio C. Brandan E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18842-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Solid Phase Binding Assay—Binding experiments between FN and CTGF were performed as described previously (46Nguyen T.Q. Roestenberg P. van Nieuwenhoven F.A. Bovenschen N. Li Z. Xu L. Oliver N. Aten J. Joles J.A. Vial C. Brandan E. Lyons K.M. Goldschmeding R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2008; 19: 2098-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In brief, 96-well plates were coated over night at 4 °C with FN (Sigma). Then the plates were treated for 2 h with blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) at room temperature and then incubated with rFLAG-CTGF (46Nguyen T.Q. Roestenberg P. van Nieuwenhoven F.A. Bovenschen N. Li Z. Xu L. Oliver N. Aten J. Joles J.A. Vial C. Brandan E. Lyons K.M. Goldschmeding R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2008; 19: 2098-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Later, the wells were incubated for 2.5 h at 37 °C with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) and the appropriate horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The binding was determined using ABTS peroxidase substrate (Calbiochem) reading at 405 nm. The KD for FN was calculated utilizing SigmaPlot 10 software. FN Degradation Analysis—The analysis of the putative degradation of FN by CTGF was performed using 125I-FN as substrate (47Droguett R. Cabello-Verrugio C. Riquelme C. Brandan E. Matrix Biol. 2006; 25: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). 6 ng of radioactive FN (500,000 cpm) were incubated with 0 (Control) 10, 20, or 40 ng/ml of CTGF for 24 h at 37 °C in 40 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Then the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was exposed in a photo-sensitive film for the visualization of FN. To analyze the degradation of FN by cells, 12 ng of radioactive FN (1 × 106 cpm) were added to the indicated cells and incubated in the presence of CTGF (0, 10 and 20 ng/ml) in minimum medium during 24 h. After that, the cell extracts were prepared and fractionated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The radioactive bands were then visualized and quantified using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences phosphorimaging device (Cyclone model). Statistical Methods—The results are given as the means ± S.E. for the indicated number of experiments. Comparisons among the different experimental groups were carried out using one-way analysis of variance test utilizing SigmaPlot 10 with SigmaStat software. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. CTGF Increases FN Amount, MMP-2 Expression, and Gelatinase Activity in 3T3 Fibroblasts—To evaluate the fibrotic effect of CTGF in 3T3 fibroblasts, we determined the FN amount in response to recombinant CTGF. We found that FN increases in the presence of CTGF in a dose-dependent manner as we described previously (40Vial C. Zuniga L.M. Cabello-Verrugio C. Canon P. Fadic R. Brandan E. J. Cell Physiol. 2008; 215: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). These results demonstrate the fibrotic effect of CTGF in 3T3 fibroblasts. To determine whether the effect of CTGF on the accumulation of FN in 3T3 fibroblasts is due to variations in MMP-2 expression and in consequence its activity, we evaluated the MMP-2 expression and amount and gelatinase activity in response to recombinant CTGF in these cells. The rqPCR shows that CTGF increases MMP-2 mRNA levels at 5.0 ng/ml of the factor (Fig. 1C). The expression of metalloproteinase type 9 (MMP-9 or gelatinase B), TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 was not altered by CTGF (data not shown). A similar effect of CTGF on MMP-2 amount was observed by gelatin zymography (Fig. 1D). Next, the effect of CTGF on the levels of active enzyme determined by gelatinase activity was evaluated in conditioned medium. We observed that gelatinase activity increased greatly from 5.0 ng/ml CTGF (Fig. 1E). This indicates that the increase in MMP-2 expression and protein levels is reflected in an increase of the gelatinase activity. These results show a positive regulation of MMP-2 expression and in consequence of the gelatinase activity by CTGF. CTGF Decreases the Amount of FN in Fibroblasts Treated with the Metalloproteinase Inhibitor GM-6001—Fibrotic disorders are characterized by FN accumulation. This effect can be explained by an increase in the synthesis or decrease in the degradation of this substrate. To evaluate whether FN accumulation in fibrotic tissues involved MMP activity inhibition, 3T3 fibroblasts were incubated with the cytokine in the presence of the metalloproteinase inhibitor GM-6001 (Ilomastat). We observed that in the presence of GM-6001, the basal amount of FN was higher and decreased after CTGF addition in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). These results show that FN levels in the extracellular space are regulated by MMP activity and suggest that they are important to regulate the cellular response to CTGF. FN Is Increased in MMP-2-deficient 3T3 Cells—We observed that CTGF increases MMP-2 expression. Although FN is a target of this enzyme and cells with inhibited MMP activity show FN accumulation, we hypothesized that in fibrotic tissues, MMP-2 can be inhibited by a mechanism that does not involve inhibition of expression but implicates the direct inhibition of its enzymatic activity. Then to evaluate the specific role of MMP-2 in the FN amount regulation and to emulate a specific enzymatic inhibition, a stable clone that expresses shRNA against MMP-2 was produced using lentiviral vectors. This clone was called 3T3-M2(-). As control, we made a cell line called 3T3-C (that expresses a scramble sequence). We observed an inhibition greater than 4.3-fold in the expression of MMP-2 in 3T3-M2(-) cells (Fig. 3A). The levels of expression of MMP-2 were equal in wild type and control cells (data not shown). The gelatin zymography shows a great decrease in the MMP-2 amount observed, whereas the levels of MMP-9 (gelatinase B) are unaltered (Fig. 3B). Subsequently, the levels of FN in 3T3-M2(-) cells were observed through immunofluorescence (Fig. 3C) and Western blot (Fig. 3D). The levels of FN were equal in wild type and control cells (for comparison observe Fig. 4A, left bar). In 3T3-shM2(-) we observed a clear increase in FN amount relative to control cells (Fig. 3D). These results support the ideas that FN is a major substrate for MMP-2 and that its enzymatic activity is critical to regulate the FN levels in the extracellular space.FIGURE 4CTGF decreases the amount of fibronectin in MMP-2-deficient cells. A, 3T3-C and 3T3-M2(-) cells were incubated for 24 h with increasing concentrations of CTGF in serum-free medium. After that, cell extracts were prepared, fractionated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Western blot analyses were carried out using anti-FN and anti-tubulin antibodies. Tubulin immunostaining is shown as a loading control. B, the graph shows the quantification of FN bands as a ratio to the tubulin bands intensity; the mean and standard error (n = 3) are represented. The black bars show the effect of CTGF in 3T3-C cells, and the gray bars show the effect of CTGF in 3T3-M2(-) cells. The p value between control cells without CTGF and control cells treated with 10 and 20 ng/ml CTGF was <0.05 (*). The p value between control cells without CTGF and 3T3-M2(-) cells without CTGF was <0.001 (**). The p value between 3T3-M2(-) cells without CTGF and 3T3-M2(-) cells treated with CTGF was <0.05 (*) and <0.001(**). C, 3T3-C and 3T3-M2(-) cells were incubated for 24 h with different concentrations of CTGF in serum-free medium. After that, cell extracts were prepared, fractionated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Western blot analyses were carried out using anti-collagen III and anti-tubulin antibodies. Tubulin immunostaining is shown as a loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CTGF Decreases the Amount of FN in MMP-2-deficient 3T3 Cells—The above results indicate that MMP-2 activity is critical for the regulation of FN levels. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of CTGF on FN levels in 3T3-M2(-) cells. We observed that the basal amount of FN is higher, as expected, and decreases in a dose-dependent manner in response to CTGF (Fig. 4, A and B). This paradoxical behavior is similar to that observed in the presence of the metalloproteinase inhibitor GM-6001 (Fig. 2). Similar effect was observed for collagen III, another important ECM protein (Fig. 4C). MMP-9 was not responsible for the different behavior of FN in 3T3-M2(-) cells because its amount did not increase in the presence of CTGF (data not shown). These results suggest that accumulation of FN generated by MMP-2 deficiency notably alters the response to CTGF, which translates into a paradoxical response to the cytokine. Interaction between CTGF and FN Does Not Have a Direct Effect in the Paradoxical Response to the Growth Factor— The paradoxical effect observed in the MMP-2-deficient cells could be explained as a consequence of the interaction between FN and CTGF. We analyzed this interaction through solid phase binding assay, and then we determined whether FN could be degraded by CTGF. We observed that CTGF clearly interacts with FN (Fig. 5A) with a KD for FN of 81.2 μg/ml (360.8 nm) at 100 nm CTGF. We then analyzed whether CTGF was able to degrade FN and observed that CTGF did not degrade FN in the range of concentrations used for the experiments in cells (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that the decrease in the amount of FN in response to CTGF cannot be explained by the degradative activity of CTGF. CTGF Decreases the Amount of Endogenous FN in 3T3 Cells Preincubated with an Excess of Exogenous FN—To evaluate whether the paradoxical response to CTGF in MMP-2-deficient fibroblasts is due to a FN excess, 3T3 cells (wild type) were incubated with 200 nm FN for 24 h prior to the treatment with CTGF. We observed that cells incubated with FN have a different response to CTGF than the control. The FN-treated cells show a decrease in the amount of FN in the conditioned medium in a dose-dependent manner in response to CTGF (Fig. 6, A and C) in contrast with the control condition (Fig. 6, B and D). The contribution of the FN used for the treatment in relation to the one produced by the cells was negligible (Fig. 6A, lane C). This behavior is analogous to that observed in MMP-2-deficient cells (Fig. 4, A and B). These results clearly indicate that FN excess alters the effect of CTGF over endogenous FN amount. CTGF Decreases the Amount of FN in 3T3 Cells Incubated with RGDS Peptide—Because FN has been described to bind to integrins (48Wayner E.A. Garcia-Pardo A. Humphries M.J. McDonald J.A. Carter W.G. J.

https://openalex.org/W2110947998,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an incurable neuromuscular degenerative disease, caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene. Mdx mice recapitulate DMD features. Here we show that injection of wild-type (WT) embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into mdx blastocysts produces mice with improved pathology and function. A small fraction of WT ESCs incorporates into the mdx mouse nonuniformly to upregulate protein levels of dystrophin in the skeletal muscle. The chimeric muscle shows reduced regeneration and restores dystrobrevin, a dystrophin-related protein, in areas with high and with low dystrophin content. WT ESC injection increases the amount of fat in the chimeras to reach WT levels. ESC injection without dystrophin does not prevent the appearance of phenotypes in the skeletal muscle or in the fat. Thus, dystrophin supplied by the ESCs reverses disease in mdx mice globally in a dose-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2110568819,"NHE5 is a brain-enriched Na(+)/H(+) exchanger that dynamically shuttles between the plasma membrane and recycling endosomes, serving as a mechanism that acutely controls the local pH environment. In the current study we show that secretory carrier membrane proteins (SCAMPs), a group of tetraspanning integral membrane proteins that reside in multiple secretory and endocytic organelles, bind to NHE5 and co-localize predominantly in the recycling endosomes. In vitro protein-protein interaction assays revealed that NHE5 directly binds to the N- and C-terminal cytosolic extensions of SCAMP2. Heterologous expression of SCAMP2 but not SCAMP5 increased cell-surface abundance as well as transporter activity of NHE5 across the plasma membrane. Expression of a deletion mutant lacking the SCAMP2-specific N-terminal cytosolic domain, and a mini-gene encoding the N-terminal extension, reduced the transporter activity. Although both Arf6 and Rab11 positively regulate NHE5 cell-surface targeting and NHE5 activity across the plasma membrane, SCAMP2-mediated surface targeting of NHE5 was reversed by dominant-negative Arf6 but not by dominant-negative Rab11. Together, these results suggest that SCAMP2 regulates NHE5 transit through recycling endosomes and promotes its surface targeting in an Arf6-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2056994787,"Ion translocation by the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase depends on large movements of the A-domain, but the driving forces have yet to be defined. The A-domain is connected to the ion-binding membranous part of the protein through linker regions. We have determined the functional consequences of changing the length of the linker between the A-domain and transmembrane helix M3 (""A-M3 linker"") by insertion and deletion mutagenesis at two sites. It was feasible to insert as many as 41 residues (polyglycine and glycine-proline loops) in the flexible region of the linker without loss of the ability to react with Ca(2+) and ATP and to form the phosphorylated Ca(2)E1P intermediate, but the rate of the energy-transducing conformational transition to E2P was reduced by >80%. Insertion of a smaller number of residues gave effects gradually increasing with the length of the insertion. Deletion of two residues at the same site, but not replacement with glycine, gave a similar reduction as the longest insertion. Insertion of one or three residues in another part of the A-M3 linker that forms an alpha-helix (""A3 helix"") in E2/E2P conformations had even more profound effects on the ability of the enzyme to form E2P. These results demonstrate the importance of the length of the A-M3 linker and of the position and integrity of the A3 helix for stabilization of E2P and suggest that, during the normal enzyme cycle, strain of the A-M3 linker could contribute to destabilize the Ca(2)E1P state and thereby to drive the transition to E2P."
https://openalex.org/W2128146649,"Vibrio cholerae cytolysin (VCC) forms SDS-stable heptameric beta-barrel transmembrane pores in mammalian cell membranes. In contrast to structurally related pore formers of gram-positive organisms, no oligomeric prepore stage of assembly has been detected to date. In the present study, disulfide bonds were engineered to tie the pore-forming amino acid sequence to adjacent domains. In their nonreduced form, mutants were able to bind to rabbit erythrocytes and to native erythrocyte membranes suspended in PBS solution and form SDS-labile oligomers. These remained nonfunctional and represented the long-sought VCC prepores. Disulfide bond reduction in these oligomers released the pore-forming sequence from its locked position, and subsequent membrane insertion led to formation of SDS-stable pores and hemolysis. Addition of increasing amounts of an inactive mutant to wild-type toxin resulted in the formation of mixed oligomers with progressively reduced SDS stability on membranes. Membrane insertion of active monomers in these hybrid oligomers was still observed, but the functional pore diameter was reduced. These findings indicate that formation of an oligomeric prepore precedes membrane insertion of the pore-forming amino acid sequence and demonstrate that pore formation by VCC follows the same archetypical pathway as beta-barrel cytolysins of gram-positive organisms such as staphylococcal alpha-toxin."
https://openalex.org/W2149767638,"The adhesion of bacteria to host tissues is often mediated by interactions with extracellular matrices. Herein, we report on the interactions of the group A streptococcus, Streptococcus pyogenes, with the extracellular matrix protein fibulin-1. S. pyogenes bound purified fibulin-1 in a dose-dependent manner. Genetic ablation of serum opacity factor (SOF), a virulence determinant of S. pyogenes, reduced binding by ∼50%, and a recombinant peptide of SOF inhibited binding of fibulin-1 to streptococci by ∼45%. Fibulin-1 bound to purified SOF2 in a dose-dependent manner with high affinity (Kd = 1.6 nm). The fibulin-1-binding domain was localized to amino acid residues 457–806 of SOF2, whereas the fibronectin-binding domain is contained within residues 807–931 of SOF2, indicating that these two domains are separate and distinct. Fibulin-1 bound to recombinant SOF from M types 2, 4, 28, and 75 of S. pyogenes, indicating that the fibulin-1-binding domain is likely conserved among SOF from different serotypes. Mixed binding experiments suggested that gelatin, fibronectin, fibulin-1, and SOF form a quaternary molecular complex that enhanced the binding of fibulin-1. These data indicate that S. pyogenes can interact with fibulin-1 and that SOF is a major streptococcal receptor for fibulin-1 but not the only receptor. Such interactions with fibulin-1 may be involved in the adhesion of S. pyogenes to extracellular matrices of the host.

Such interactions with fibulin-1 may be involved in the adhesion of S. pyogenes to extracellular matrices of the host. Adhesion of bacteria to host surfaces is the first stage in establishing bacterial infections in the human host, and a variety of molecular mechanisms are utilized to initiate adhesion. A common mechanism for adhesion involves interactions between bacterial adhesins and components of the extracellular matrices of the host. The identification and characterization of microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMM) has led to important advances in vaccines and immunotherapies for preventing and treating bacterial infections (1Rivas J.M. Speziale P. Patti J.M. Hook M. Curr. Opin. Drug.

SOF is covalently linked to the streptococcal cell wall via an LPSTG sortase recognition site and is also released in a soluble form. SOF has two functionally distinct domains, an N-terminal domain that opacifies serum and a C-terminal domain that binds fibronectin. The role of SOF in adhesion involves both its C-terminal fibronectin-binding domain and an N-terminal region (see Fig. 1 for a schematic of structure) (9Gillen C.M. Courtney H.S. Schulze K. Rohde M.

However, the nature of the interactions between the N-terminal region of SOF and host components is not well characterized.Herein, we report on the interactions between a truncated form of SOF in which its fibronectin-binding domain has been deleted and the extracellular matrix protein fibulin-1. Fibulin-1 is a member of the fibulin family that currently consists of seven glycoproteins. All fibulins contain epidermal growth factor-like repeats and a unique fibulin-type module at its C terminus that define this family (16Argraves W.S. Greene L.M. Cooley M.A. Gallagher W.M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 17de Vega S. Iwamoto T. Yamada Y. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Fibulin-1 is found within the extracellular matrices and in human plasma at 30–50 μg/ml (18Argraves W.S. Tran H. Burgess W.H. Dickerson K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3155-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). It interacts with many of the components of the extracellular matrix including fibronectin, laminin, fibrinogen, nidogen-1, endostatin, aggrecan, and versican (16Argraves W.S. Greene L.M. Cooley M.A. Gallagher W.M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 19Timpl R. Sasaki T. Kostka G. Chu M.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Due to its intimate relationship with the extracellular matrix, it is not surprising that the defects in fibulin-1 have a wide-ranging impact. Genetic evidence suggests that fibulin-1 is involved in tissue organization, the maturation and maintenance of blood vessels, and multiple embryonic pathways (16Argraves W.S. Greene L.M.

Our findings indicate that fibulin-1 does bind to streptococci and that SOF is a major streptococcal receptor for fibulin-1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProteins—The construction and purification of recombinant peptides of SOF have been described (8Courtney H.S.

Essentially, chromosomal DNA from the indicated serotypes of S. pyogenes were used as templates; the desired encoding regions of sof were amplified by PCR, ligated into pTrcHis, and expressed in Escherichia coli; and recombinant SOF was purified by metal affinity chromatography. Purified recombinant SOF from M type 75 S. pyogenes (rSOF) was generously provided by Dr. Mark Walker at the University of Wollongong. Fibronectin was purified by gelatin affinity chromatography from fresh human serum as described by Engvall and Ruoslahti (23Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. Int. J. Cancer. 1977; 20: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Fibulin-1 was purified from extracts of human placenta by immunoaffinity chromatography using mouse monoclonal 3A11 anti-fibulin-1 IgG-Sepharose (18Argraves W.S. Tran H. Burgess W.H. Dickerson K. J.

Immun. 1994; 62: 3937-3946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Organisms and Growth Conditions—Streptococci (i.e. T2MR and YL3) were grown overnight at 37 °C in Todd Hewitt broth supplemented with 1.5% yeast extract. T2MR is a clinical isolate of M type 2 S. pyogenes that expresses SOF. YL3 is an isogenic mutant of T2MR in which sof was insertionally inactivated using the Ω-element as described (8Courtney H.S. Hasty D.L. Li Y. Chiang H.C. Thacker J.L. Dale J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The Ω-element contains translational and transcriptional terminators as well as a kanamycin resistance marker that is expressed in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms (25Prentki P. Krisch H.M. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 29: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). Lack of expression of SOF was verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of whole bacteria, Western blots of streptococcal extracts, and functional analyses (8Courtney H.S. Hasty D.L. Li Y. Chiang H.C. Thacker J.L. Dale J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).ELISA—Microtiter wells were coated with 3 μg/ml rSOF-(1–806) or bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 4 h at 37 °C and then blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 2 h at room temperature. The wells were then washed and incubated overnight with serial dilutions of fibulin-1 in TBS containing 3% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20 (dilution buffer). The wells were rinsed and incubated with murine monoclonal antibody 3A11 against fibulin-1 (1 μg/ml in dilution buffer) for 1 h. Afterward, the wells were rinsed and incubated at ambient temperature for 1 h with a 1:6,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (GE Healthcare). The wells were then rinsed, and the SureBlue tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) was added, and the absorbance at 650 nm was recorded after color development. The binding curve was generated using SigmaPlot software, and the Kd was calculated by determining the concentration of the ligand required for half-maximal binding.For ELISA assays measuring the binding of fibulin-1 to SOF peptides, various truncated peptides of SOF or BSA were coated onto microtiter wells at 10 μg/ml in sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.5, for 1 h at 37 °C and then blocked with BSA (1 mg/ml). Wells were rinsed and fibulin-1 (4 μg/ml in TBS with 1 mg/ml BSA) was added to the wells and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The wells were then washed, and a 1:1,000 dilution of rabbit anti-fibulin-1 IgG or normal rabbit serum was added to the wells and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Afterward, the wells were washed, and a 1:2,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was added. After incubating at 37 °C for 30 min, the wells were washed, and the TMB substrate was added. The absorbance at 650 nm was recorded after color development.In assays to examine the effect of potential complexes between the constituents on the binding of fibulin-1, wells were coated with rSOF, fibronectin, gelatin, or BSA (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. The wells were washed and blocked with BSA (1 mg/ml in PBS) for 30 min at 37 °C. Biotinylated fibulin-1 (6 μg/ml) that was premixed with control buffer (1 mg/ml BSA in TBS with 1 mm CaCl2) or 10 μg/ml fibronectin with or without 10 μg/ml rSOF-(1–1010) was then added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The wells were washed, and a 1:2,000 dilution of Neutralite avidin-peroxidase (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added to wells and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Afterward, the wells were washed, and the TMB substrate was added. The absorbance at 650 nm was recorded after color development. Wells coated with BSA served as negative controls.Assays for Binding of Fibulin-1 to S. pyogenes—Microtiter wells were coated with 100 μl of wild type strain T2MR of S. pyogenes or its SOF-negative mutant YL3 (A530 = 0.4) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min at 37 °C. Negative control wells were coated with BSA (10 μg/m PBS). The wells were then blocked with BSA (1 mg/ml in PBS) for 30 min at 37 °C. Serial 2-fold dilutions of biotinylated fibulin-1 were added to wells and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The wells were washed, and a 1:2,000 dilution of Neutralite avidin-peroxidase was added. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the wells were washed, and the TMB substrate was added. The absorbance at 650 nm was recorded after color development.For inhibition experiments with exogenous SOF, microtiter wells were coated with S. pyogenes strain T2MR and blocked with BSA as described above. Wells coated with BSA served as negative controls. Biotinylated fibulin-1 (4 μg/ml) was mixed with serial dilutions of rSOF2-(1–806) in TBS with 1 mg/ml BSA and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The wells were then washed, and a 1:2,000 dilution of Neutralite avidin-peroxidase was added and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After 30 min, the wells were washed, the TMB substrate was added, and the absorbance at 650 nm was recorded after color development.SOF Affinity Chromatography of Human Serum—Purified recombinant SOF2 in which the fibronectin-binding domain was deleted (rSOF2-(1–806)) was coupled to Actigel ALD according to the manufacturer's procedures (Sterogene Bioseparations, Inc., Carlsbad, CA). Human serum was added to the column, and then the column was washed with TBS, and the bound material was eluted with 4 m urea in TBS. The bound fraction was dialyzed against TBS, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. The five major proteins bands were electroeluted from acrylamide gels. The purified proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions to determine whether any of the proteins contained more than one polypeptide. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and bands were excised and subjected to N-terminal sequencing.RESULTSIdentification of Fibulin-1 as a Serum Protein That Binds to SOF—The ability of SOF to bind fibulin-1 was discovered during a search for serum proteins that interact with SOF. This search was undertaken because many of the surface proteins of group A streptococci have multiple binding domains for serum proteins, and the binding of these proteins have been linked to increased survival of group A streptococci in blood and to adhesion to host cells (4Courtney H.S. Hasty D.L. Dale J.B. Ann. Med. 2002; 34: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 7Courtney H.S. Podbielski A. Lamont R.J. Bacterial Invasion of Host Cells.

To investigate the ability of SOF to bind serum proteins, rSOF2-(1–806) was covalently linked to agarose and used as an affinity column. This construct was selected because the fibronectin-binding domain was deleted (Fig. 1), and we wanted to focus on the potential of SOF to bind serum proteins other than fibronectin. Human serum was applied to the column, and then the column was washed, and bound proteins were eluted with urea. The eluted fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2, lane 1).FIGURE 2Identification of serum proteins that bind to SOF. Human serum was applied to a SOF affinity column, and bound proteins were eluted with urea and subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. Lane 1, peak fraction eluted from the column; lanes 2 and 3, molecular mass standards shown in kilodaltons; lanes 4–8, five major SOF-binding proteins purified from the gel by electroelution. The protein in lane 4 was identified as an immunoglobulin (Ig) by immunoblot analysis. Proteins in lanes 5–8 were identified by N-terminal amino acid sequencing.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Five major protein bands were present in the eluate from the SOF affinity column. The bands were purified from the acrylamide gels by electroelution (Fig. 2, lanes 4–8). SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions suggested that the protein in lane 4 of Fig. 2 could be an immunoglobulin. This was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using antibodies specific for human immunoglobulins (data not shown). It is not surprising that immunoglobulins were found to bind to the SOF affinity column, as antibodies to SOF are commonly found in human sera in response to infections with SOF-positive S. pyogenes (27Kim S. Lee N.Y. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1316-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar).N-terminal sequencing of the other proteins indicated that the other major bands corresponded to fibulin-1, transferrin, albumin, and apoA-I (Fig. 2, lanes 5–8). The finding that apoA-I bound to SOF was anticipated, as SOF was reported previously to bind to apoA-I with high affinity (13Courtney H.S. Zhang Y.M. Frank M.W. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5515-5521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Characterizations of the binding of albumin and transferrin to SOF will be the subject of future studies.Characterization of Fibulin-1 Binding to SOF—To further investigate the interactions between fibulin-1 and SOF, fibulin-1 was purified from human placentas and incubated with microtiter wells coated with purified rSOF2-(1–806). Fibulin-1 bound to SOF in a dose-dependent fashion but did not bind to BSA (Fig. 3). Fibulin-1 bound to SOF with high affinity (Kd ∼ 1.6 nm), as determined by calculating the concentration required for half-maximal binding. To further localize the fibulin-1-binding domain, various recombinant peptides of SOF were constructed and tested for their ability to bind fibulin-1 (Fig. 4). In addition to binding to rSOF2-(1–806), fibulin-1 also bound to wells coated with rSOF2-(457–1010). In contrast, no significant levels of fibulin-1 binding were detected to wells coated with rSOF2-(1–456) and rSOF2-(807–944). As rSOF2-(1–806) does not contain the fibronectin-binding domain, and rSOF2-(807–944) does contain this domain, these data clearly indicate that the fibronectin-binding domain of SOF is not required for the binding of fibulin-1. These data further suggest that a fibulin-1-binding domain resides between amino acid residues 457–806 of SOF2.FIGURE 3Binding of fibulin-1 to SOF. Varying concentrations of fibulin-1 were incubated with microtiter wells coated with BSA or with rSOF2-(1–806). Bound fibulin-1 was quantified by ELISA using a monoclonal fibulin-1 antibody.

Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether SOF expressed by other serotypes could also bind fibulin-1. The sof genes from M serotypes 4, 28, and 75 were cloned into E. coli and expressed, and the recombinant forms of SOF were purified. Microtiter wells were coated with these purified products as well as with rSOF2-(1–806) and then reacted with fibulin-1. Fibulin-1 bound to rSOF2, rSOF4, rSOF28, and rSOF75 but not to control wells coated with BSA (Fig. 5). These findings indicate that fibulin-1 can bind to SOF from multiple serotypes and suggest that the fibulin-1-binding domain is probably conserved within SOF from these different serotypes.FIGURE 5Fibulin-1 binds to SOF from multiple serotypes of S. pyogenes. Purified, recombinant forms of SOF from the indicated serotypes were immobilized on microtiter wells and incubated with fibulin-1.

Given our findings that fibulin-1 can also bind to SOF, there is the potential for these four proteins to form a complex, and the formation of such a complex could influence the degree to which fibulin-1 is bound. To determine whether this may be the case, microtiter wells were first coated with gelatin, fibronectin, SOF, or BSA and then incubated with solutions of fibulin-1 ± rSOF2-(1–1010) or fibronectin (Fig. 6A). Note that this form of SOF2 contains the fibronectin-binding domain. The highest degree of fibulin-1 binding occurred in wells that were first coated with gelatin and then incubated with a mixture of fibulin-1, fibronectin, and SOF. These findings suggest that these proteins may interact to form a quaternary complex (Fig. 6B).FIGURE 6Interactions between gelatin, fibronectin, fibulin-1, and SOF.

Next, we wanted to determine whether SOF on the surface of streptococci could serve as a receptor for fibulin-1. Microtiter wells were coated with wild type strain T2MR of S. pyogenes and its SOF-negative mutant, YL3, and reacted with various concentrations of biotinylated fibulin-1. Fibulin-1 was found to bind to T2MR in a dose-related fashion (Fig. 7). However, the level of fibulin-1 binding to the SOF-negative mutant was 50% less than that bound to T2MR. Next, we evaluated the ability of purified rSOF2-(1–806) to block the binding of fibulin-1 to wild type S. pyogenes. As shown in Fig. 8, exogenously added SOF blocked the binding of fibulin-1 in a dose-dependent fashion, reaching a level of 45% inhibition at the highest concentration tested.FIGURE 7SOF-deficient mutant displays reduced binding of fibulin-1. Microtiter wells were coated with wild type S. pyogenes T2MR or its isogenic mutant defective in expressing SOF, YL3. Wells coated with BSA served as negative controls.

https://openalex.org/W2073531664,"Mammarian enabled (Mena), a member of the Enabled (Ena)/Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) family of proteins, has been implicated in cell motility through regulation of the actin cytoskeleton assembly, including lamellipodial protrusion. Rac1, a member of the Rho family GTPases, also plays a pivotal role in the formation of lamellipodia. Here we report that human Mena (hMena) colocalizes with Rac1 in lamellipodia, and using an unmixing assisted acceptor depletion fluorescence resonance energy transfer (u-adFRET) analysis that hMena associates with Rac1 in vivo in the glioblastoma cell line U251MG. Depletion of hMena by siRNA causes cells to be highly spread with the formation of lamellipodia. This cellular phenotype is canceled by introduction of a dominant negative form of Rac1. A Rac activity assay and FRET analysis showed that hMena knock-down cells increased the activation of Rac1 at the lamellipodia. These results suggest that hMena possesses properties which help to regulate the formation of lamellipodia through the modulation of the activity of Rac1."

Here we determine the genetic variation within the human TLR4 gene encoding the principal receptor for bacterial endotoxin recognition in typhoid fever patients. It is possible that genetic variants of TLR4 could detrimentally affect the innate immune response against S. typhi infection. Mutation detection and genotyping of TLR4 was performed on DNA from 414 Vietnamese typhoid fever patients and 372 population controls. dHPLC detected a total of 10 polymorphisms within the upstream and exonic regions of TLR4, of which 7 are novel. Two SNPs, T4025A and C4215G, were more frequent in typhoid cases than in controls however due to their low allele frequencies they showed borderline significance (T4025A: OR 1.9, 95%CI 0.9-4.3, P 0.07 and C4215G: OR 6.7, 95%CI 0.8-307, P 0.04). Six missense mutations were identified, with 5/6 positioned in the ectoplasmic domain. Four missense mutations and one promoter SNP (A-271G) were only present in typhoid cases, albeit at low allele frequencies. Here we determined the extent of genetic variation within TLR4 in a Vietnamese population and suggest that TLR4 may be involved in defense against typhoid fever in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2084380224,"Continuum models that describe the effects of solvent and biological membrane molecules on the structure and behavior of antimicrobial peptides, holds a promise to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of antimicrobial action of these peptides. In such methods, a lipid bilayer model membrane is implicitly represented by multiple layers of relatively low dielectric constant embedded in a high dielectric aqueous solvent, while an antimicrobial peptide is accounted for by a dielectric cavity with fixed partial charge at the center of each one of its atoms. In the present work, we investigate the ability of continuum approaches to predict the most probable orientation of the beta-hairpin antimicrobial peptide Protegrin-1 (PG-1) in DLPC lipid bilayers by calculating the difference in the transfer free energy from an aqueous environment to a membrane-water environment for multiple orientations. The transfer free energy is computed as a sum of two terms; polar/electrostatic and non-polar. They both include energetic and entropic contributions to the free energy. We numerically solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation to calculate the electrostatic contribution to the transfer free energy, while the non-polar contribution to the free energy is approximated using a linear solvent accessible surface area relationships. The most probable orientation of PG-1 is that with the lowest relative transfer free energy. Our simulation results indicate that PG-1 assumes an oblique orientation in DLPC lipid bilayers. The predicted most favorable orientation was with a tilt angle of 19 degrees, which is in qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed orientations derived from solid-state NMR data."
https://openalex.org/W1973119847,"Dendritic cells (DC) are the most potent antigen presenting cells (APC) of the immune system. Prostaglandin E(2), cyclic AMP, and protein kinase A (PKA) have all been shown to regulate DC maturation and activity. In other cells, the ability of these molecules to convey their signals has been shown to be dependent on A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). Here we present evidence for the existence and functional importance of AKAPs in human DC.Using immunofluorescence and/or western analyses we identify AKAP79, AKAP149, AKAP95, AKAP LBC and Ezrin. We also demonstrate by western analysis that expression of AKAP79, AKAP149 and RII are upregulated with DC differentiation and maturation. We establish the functional importance of PKA anchoring in multiple aspects of DC biology using the anchoring inhibitor peptides Ht31 and AKAP-IS. Incubation of protein or peptide antigen loaded DC with Ht31 or AKAP-IS results in a 30-50% decrease in antigen presentation as measured by IFN-gamma production from antigen specific CD4(+) T cells. Incubation of LPS treated DC with Ht31 results in 80% inhibition of TNF-alpha and IL-10 production. Ht31 slightly decreases the expression of CD18 and CD11a and CD11b, slightly increases the basal expression of CD83, dramatically decreases the LPS stimulated expression of CD40, CD80 and CD83, and significantly increases the expression of the chemokine receptor CCR7.These experiments represent the first evidence for the functional importance of PKA anchoring in multiple aspects of DC biology."
https://openalex.org/W2049646663,"The octapeptide hormone angiotensin II (AngII) exerts a wide variety of cardiovascular effects through the activation of the angiotensin II type-1 (AT1) receptor, which belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Like other G protein-coupled receptors, the AT1 receptor possesses seven transmembrane domains that provide structural support for the formation of the ligand-binding pocket. In order to identify those residues in the second transmembrane domain (TMD2) that contribute to the formation of the binding pocket of the AT1 receptor, we used the substituted cysteine accessibility method. All of the residues within the Leu-70 to Trp-94 region were mutated one at a time to a cysteine, and, after expression in COS-7 cells, the mutant receptors were treated with the sulfhydryl-specific alkylating agent methanethiosulfonate-ethylammonium (MTSEA). MTSEA reacts selectively with water-accessible, free sulfhydryl groups of endogenous or introduced point mutation cysteines. If a cysteine is found in the binding pocket, the covalent modification will affect the binding kinetics of the ligand. MTSEA substantially decreased the binding affinity of D74C-AT1, L81C-AT1, A85C-AT1, T88C-AT1, and A89C-AT1 mutant receptors, which suggests that these residues orient themselves within the water-accessible binding pocket of the AT1 receptor. Interestingly, this pattern of acquired MTSEA sensitivity was altered for TMD2 reporter cysteines engineered in a constitutively active N111G-AT1 receptor background. Indeed, mutant D74C-N111G-AT1 became insensitive to MTSEA, whereas mutant L81C-N111G-AT1 lost some sensitivity and mutant V86C-N111G-AT1 became sensitive to MTSEA.

It exerts a wide variety of physiological effects, including vascular contraction, aldosterone secretion, neuronal activation, and cardiovascular cell growth and proliferation (1de Gasparo M. Catt K.J. Inagami T. Wright J.W. Unger T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 415-472PubMed Google Scholar). Virtually all of the known physiological effects of AngII are produced through the activation of the AT1 receptor, which belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily (2Burnier M. Circulation. 2001; 103: 904-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 3Miura S. Saku K. Karnik S.S. Hypertens. Res. 2003; 26: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). GPCRs possess seven transmembrane domains (TMD), which provide structural support for signal transduction. The AT1 receptor interacts with the G protein Gq/11, which activates a phospholipase C, which in turn generates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol from the cleavage of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (4Balla T.

Chem. 1984; 259: 14448-14457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate causes the release of Ca2+ from an intracellular store, whereas diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C. Like other GPCRs, the AT1 receptor undergoes spontaneous isomerization between its inactive state (favored in the absence of agonist) and its active state (induced or stabilized by the agonist) (6Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17979-17982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Movement of TMD helices through translational or rotational displacement is believed to be essential to achieve the active state (7Ghanouni P. Steenhuis J.J. Farrens D.L. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5997-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 8Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1683-1690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that TMD3, TMD5, TMD6, and TMD7 may participate in the activation process of the AT1 receptor by providing a network of interactions through the AngII-binding pocket (9Inoue Y. Nakamura N. Inagami T. J. Hypertens. 1997; 15: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The dynamics of this network are thought to be modified following agonist binding, thereby forcing the receptor to form new interactions between the TMDs. Based on homology with the high resolution structure of rhodopsin, the archetypal GPCR (10Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. et al.Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar), it was expected that the binding site of the AT1 receptor would involve the seven mostly hydrophobic TMDs and would be accessible to charged water-soluble ligands, like AngII. For this receptor, the binding site would thus be contained within a water-accessible crevice, the binding pocket, extending from the extracellular surface of the receptor to the transmembrane portion. Using a photoaffinity labeling approach, we directly identified ligand-contact points within the second extracellular loop and the seventh TMD of the AT1 receptor (11Boucard A.A. Wilkes B.C. Laporte S.A. Escher E. Guillemette G. Leduc R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9662-9670Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Laporte S.A. Boucard A.A. Servant G. Guillemette G. Leduc R. Escher E.

Auger-Messier M. et al.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14348-14356Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Interestingly, numerous mutagenesis studies have provided the basis for a model in which an interaction between Asn-111 in TMD3 and Tyr-292 in TMD7 maintains the AT1 receptor in the inactive conformation. The agonist AngII would disrupt this interaction and promote the active conformational state (14Joseph M.P. Maigret B. Bonnafous J.C. Marie J. Scheraga H.A. J. Protein Chem. 1995; 14: 381-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In support of this model, it was further shown that substitution of Asn-111 for a residue of smaller size (Ala or Gly) confers constitutive activity on the AT1 receptor (15Balmforth A.J. Lee A.J.

Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) is an ingenious approach for systematically identifying the residues in a TMD that contribute to the binding site pocket of a GPCR. Consecutive residues within TMDs are mutated to cysteine, one at a time, and the mutant receptors are expressed in heterologous cells. If ligand binding to a cysteine-substituted mutant is unchanged compared with wild-type receptor, it is assumed that the structure of the mutant receptor, especially around the binding site, is similar to that of wild type and therefore that the substituted cysteine lies in an orientation similar to that of the wild-type residue. In TMDs, the sulfhydryl of a cysteine oriented toward the binding site pocket should react faster with a positively charged sulfhydryl reagent like methanethiosulfonate-ethylammonium (MTSEA) than sulfhydryls facing the interior of the protein or the lipid bilayer. Two criteria are used for identifying engineered cysteines on the surface of the binding site pocket: (i) the reaction with MTSEA alters binding irreversibly, and (ii) the reaction is retarded by the presence of ligand. We previously used this approach to identify the residues in TMD3, TMD6, and TMD7 that form the surface of the binding site pocket in the wild-type AT1 receptor and in the constitutively active N111G-AT1 receptor (21Martin S.S.

Here we report the application of SCAM to probe TMD2 in the wild-type and constitutively active receptors. Materials—Bovine serum albumin, bacitracin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor were from Sigma. The sulfhydryl-specific alkylating reagent MTSEA (CH3SO2-SCH2CH2NH3+) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. (Toronto, Canada). The cDNA clone for the human AT1 receptor subcloned in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 was kindly provided by Dr. Sylvain Meloche (Université de Montréal). LipofectAmine2000® and culture media were obtained from Invitrogen. 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]AngII (specific radioactivity ∼1500 Ci/mmol) was prepared with IODO-GEN® (Perbio Science, Erembodegem, Belgium) according to the method of Fraker and Speck (24Fraker P.J. Speck Jr., J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar) and as previously reported (25Guillemette G. Escher E. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5591-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Numbering of Residues in TMD2—Residues in TMD2 of the human AT1 receptor were given two numbering schemes. First, residues were numbered according to their positions in the human AT1 receptor sequence. Second, residues were also indexed according to their position relative to the most conserved residue in the TMD in which it is located (26Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4347) Google Scholar). By definition, the most conserved residue was assigned the position index “50” (e.g. in TMD2, Asp-74 is the most conserved residue and was designated Asp-74(2.50), whereas the upstream residue was designated Leu-75(2.51) and the downstream residue was designated Ala-73(2.49)). This indexing simplified the identification of aligned residues in different GPCRs. Oligodeoxynucleotide Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the wild-type AT1 receptor with the overlap PCR method (Expand High Fidelity PCR System; Roche Applied Science). Briefly, forward and reverse oligonucleotides were constructed to introduce cysteine mutations between Leu-70(2.46) and Trp-94(2.70). PCR products were subcloned into the HindIII-XbaI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1. Site-directed mutations were then confirmed by automated DNA sequencing by aligning the AT1 sequence with multiAlin (26Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4347) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 2 mm l-glutamine and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The cells were seeded into 100-mm culture dishes at a density of 2 × 106 cells/dish. When the cells reached ∼90% confluence, they were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA and 15 μl of lipofectAmine2000®. After 24 h, transfected cells were trypsinized, distributed into 12-well plates, and grown for an additional 24 h in complete DMEM containing 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin before the MTSEA treatment and binding assay. Binding Experiments—COS-7 cells were grown for 36 h post-transfection in 100-mm culture dishes, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle. Broken cells were then gently scraped into washing buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2), centrifuged at 2500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% bacitracin, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor). Saturation binding experiments were done by incubating broken cells (20–40 μg of protein) for 1 h at room temperature with increasing concentrations of 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]AngII in a final volume of 500 μl. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled [Sar1,Ile8]AngII. Bound radioactivity was separated from free ligand by filtration through GF/C filters presoaked for at least 3 h in binding buffer. Receptor-bound radioactivity was evaluated by γ-counting. Treatment with MTSEA—MTSEA treatment was performed according to the procedure of Javitch et al. (18Javitch J.A. Li X. Kaback J. Karlin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10355-10359Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Two days after transfection, the cells, which were grown in 12-well plates, were washed with PBS and incubated for 3 min at room temperature with freshly prepared MTSEA at the desired concentrations (typically from 0.5 to 6 mm) in a final volume of 0.2 ml. The reaction was stopped by washing the cells with ice-cold PBS. Intact cells were then incubated in binding medium (DMEM, 25 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) containing 0.05 nm 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]AngII for 90 min at room temperature. After washing with ice-cold PBS, the cells were lysed with 0.1 n NaOH, and the radioactivity was evaluated by γ-counting. The percentage of sfractional binding inhibition was calculated as (1 – (specific binding after the MTSEA treatment/specific binding without the treatment)) × 100. Protection against MTSEA Reaction by [Sar1,Ile8]AngII—Transfected cells grown in 12-well plates were washed once with PBS and incubated in the presence or absence of 100 nm [Sar1,Ile8]AngII for 1 h at 16 °C (to avoid internalization of receptors). The cells were washed to remove excess ligand and then treated with MTSEA. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and once with an acidic buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm acetic acid, pH 3.0) to dissociate bound ligand. They were then incubated for 3 h at 16 °C in binding medium (DMEM, 25 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) containing 0.05 nm 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]AngII. The percentage of protection was calculated as ((inhibition in the absence of [Sar1,Ile8]AngII)–(inhibition in the presence of [Sar1,Ile8]AngII)/(inhibition in the absence of [Sar1,Ile8]AngII)) × 100. Phospholipase C Assay—Inositol phosphate accumulation was determined as described previously (27Lanctot P.M. Leclerc P.C. Escher E. Leduc R. Guillemette G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8621-8627Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In brief, COS-7 cells were seeded in 6-well plates, transfected, and labeled for 16 h in serum-free M199 containing 10 μCi/ml [myo-3H]inositol (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH). Cells were washed twice with PBS plus 0.1% (w/v) dextrose and then incubated in stimulation buffer (DMEM containing 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm LiCl, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) for 30 min at 37 °C. Incubations were terminated by the addition of ice-cold perchloric acid (final concentration, 5% (v/v)). Water-soluble inositol phosphates were then extracted with an equal volume of a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane and tri-N-octylamine. The samples were mixed vigorously and centrifuged at 2500 × g for 30 min. The upper phase containing inositol phosphates was applied to an AG1-X8 resin column (Bio-Rad). Inositol phosphates were eluted sequentially by the addition of an ammonium formate/formic acid solution of increasing ionic strength. Fractions containing inositol phosphates were collected and measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Data Analysis—Results are presented as means ± S.D. Specific binding data (Bmax and Kd) were analyzed with Prism version 4.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego CA), using a one-site binding hyperbola nonlinear regression analysis. Binding Properties of Mutant Receptors Bearing Cysteines in TMD2—To identify the residues in TMD2 that face the binding site pocket of the AT1 receptor, we mutated 24 consecutive residues between Leu-70(2.47) and Trp-94(2.70) to cysteine, one at a time. Each mutant receptor was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. To assess the conservation of the global conformation of these receptors after the substitution, pharmacological parameters describing the equilibrium binding of the radiolabeled competitive ligand 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]AngII, such as Kd and Bmax, were determined (Table 1). All mutant AT1 receptors exhibited high binding affinity for 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]AngII (similar to that of the wild-type AT1 receptor) except for mutants P82C(2.58), W84C(2.60), Y87C(2.63), Y92C(2.68), and W94C(2.70), which did not demonstrate any detectable binding activity and were not used for the SCAM analysis. Bmax values for all detectable receptors ranged from 490 to 4282 fmol/mg of protein.TABLE 1Binding Properties of [Sar1,Ile8]AngII to cysteine-substituted hAT1 mutant receptorsKdBmaxnnmfmol/mgWild type (Cys-76)0.6 ± 0.34282 ± 90311L70C0.7 ± 0.21428 ± 7964A71C0.9 ± 0.32729 ± 5233L72C0.4 ± 0.21923 ± 5494A73C0.4 ± 0.11814 ± 3093D74C1.2 ± 0.71141 ± 3204L75C0.9 ± 0.41405 ± 2323F77C3.1 ± 0.62256 ± 4783L78C0.4 ± 0.11412 ± 3003L79C0.5 ± 0.21833 ± 10203T80C0.3 ± 0.01918 ± 7113L81C4.0 ± 1.32415 ± 8723L83C1.8 ± 0.21288 ± 6913A85C0.9 ± 0.31074 ± 4054V86C0.6 ± 0.31709 ± 1403T88C3.2 ± 1.95633 ± 723A89C0.5 ± 0.11061 ± 4513M90C1.6 ± 1.0490 ± 203E91C2.1 ± 0.61622 ± 9503R93C0.8 ± 0.31152 ± 673 Open table in a new tab Effect of Extracellularly Added MTSEA on the Binding Properties of Mutant Receptors—To verify whether the reporter cysteines introduced into the TMD2 of the AT1 receptor were oriented toward the binding pocket, mutant receptors were treated with concentrations of MTSEA varying between 0.5 and 6 mm. We also verified whether the wild-type AT1 receptor, which contains 10 endogenous cysteines (Fig. 1), was sensitive to MTSEA treatment. Fig. 2 shows that various concentrations of MTSEA had very little effect (no more than a 25% reduction) on the binding properties of the wild-type AT1 receptor, indicating that the endogenous cysteines made a relatively small contribution to the binding site pocket. A 3-min treatment with 0.5 mm MTSEA (Fig. 3A) strongly inhibited the binding properties of mutants L81C(2.57)-AT1 (binding inhibition of 65%), A85C(2.61)-AT1 (binding inhibition of 71%), and T88C(2.64)-AT1 (binding inhibition of 75%), whereas it had only a minor effect on the binding properties of the other mutant receptors. At higher MTSEA concentrations (2 mm and above), the binding properties of mutant receptors D74C(2.50)-AT1 and A89C(2.65)-AT1 were also slightly affected (Fig. 3B). Overall, the most reactive cysteines were those substituted for L81C(2.57), A85C(2.61), and T88C(2.64), whereas the cysteine substituted for D74C(2.50) and A89C(2.65) were less reactive.FIGURE 2MTSEA treatment of the wild-type AT1 receptor and sensitive reporter cysteine-bearing mutant receptors.

We first determined the pharmacological properties of the 24 cysteine-substituted mutant receptors. Within the N111G-AT1 receptor background, 18 cysteine-substituted mutants conserved a high binding affinity for the competitive ligand 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]AngII (Table 2). The mutant receptors P82C(2.58)-N111G-AT1, L83C(2.59)-N111G-AT1, W84C(2.60)-N111G-AT1, Y87C(2.63)-N111G-AT1, Y92C(2.68))-N111G-AT1, and W94C(2.70)-N111G-AT1 did not have any detectable binding activity and were not used for the SCAM analysis. Bmax values for all detectable receptors ranged from 570 to 3967 fmol/mg protein (Table 2).TABLE 2Binding properties of [Sar1,Ile8]AngII to cysteine-substituted hAT1 mutant receptors bearing the N111G mutationKdBmaxnnMfmol/mgN111G0.8 ± 0.23003 ± 88510L70C3.6 ± 1.63087 ± 2353A71C1.3 ± 0.22787 ± 7773L72C0.9 ± 0.62688 ± 8773A73C0.6 ± 0.13967 ± 15164D74C1.8 ± 0.11781 ± 7753L75C0.6 ± 0.02336 ± 6893F77C0.7 ± 0.03004 ± 2133L78C0.6 ± 0.11645 ± 7043L79C0.5 ± 0.01868 ± 2803T80C0.4 ± 0.03395 ± 4563L81C1.7 ± 0.21780 ± 2523A85C0.9 ± 0.1622 ± 4293V86C2.6 ± 0.6570 ± 2023T88C0.7 ± 0.1819 ± 6083A89C1.0 ± 0.41019 ± 8543M90C2.9 ± 1.0980 ± 4923E91C2.1 ± 0.61622 ± 9503R93C1.2 ± 0.51175 ± 753 Open table in a new tab Fig. 4 (see also Fig. 2) shows that, like the wild-type receptor, the N111G-AT1 receptor was relatively insensitive to a 3-min treatment with MTSEA concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 2 mm, again indicating the relatively low contribution of the endogenous cysteines to the binding site pocket. Cysteine-substituted N111G-AT1 receptor mutants were also treated with increasing concentrations of MTSEA, and their binding properties were assessed with 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]AngII. Fig. 5 summarizes the effect of the MTSEA treatment on the different cysteine-substituted N111G-AT1 receptor mutants. As observed in the wild-type background, 0.5 mm MTSEA decreased the binding activity of the A85C(2.61)-N111G-AT1 and T88C(2.64)-N111G-AT1 by 78 and 82%, respectively. It is noteworthy that the V86C(2.62)-N111G-AT1 mutant, which was insensitive to MTSEA in the wild-type background, had reduced binding activity by 47% in the N111G-AT1 background after a treatment with 0.5 mm MTSEA. On the other hand, L81C(2.57)-N111G-AT1 which exhibited a significant reduction in binding activity in the wild-type background, became less sensitive to MTSEA in the N111G-AT1 background (reduction of 39% in binding activity after a treatment with 2 mm MTSEA) and that D74C(2.50)-N111G-AT1 became completely insensitive to treatment with MTSEA.FIGURE 5Effect of MTSEA on different mutant N111G-AT1 receptors bearing a reporter cysteine in TMD2. Intact COS-7 cells transiently expressing the mutant N111G-AT1 receptors were incubated for 3 min at room temperature with freshly prepared 0.5 mm MTSEA (A) or 2 mm MTSEA (B). The intact cells were then incubated for 90 min at room temperature with 0.05 nm 125I-[Sar1, Ile8]AngII.

The cells were then washed with an acid buffer to dissociate the bound ligand. The receptors were then assayed for binding with the radiolabeled competitive ligand. Fig. 6 shows how a preincubation with the competitive ligand [Sar1,Ile8]AngII protected mutant receptors D74C(2.50)-AT1, L81C(2.57)-AT1, A85C(2.61)-AT1, T88C(2.64)-AT1, A89C(2.65)-AT1, L81C(2.57)-N111G-AT1, A85C(2.61)-N111G-AT1, V86C(2.62)-N111G-AT1, T88C(2.64)-N111G-AT1, and A89C(2.65)-N111G-AT1 from the inhibitory effect of MTSEA, with protection levels ranging from 59 to 91%. Functional Properties of Wild-type and Mutant AT1 Receptors—The functional properties of wild-type and mutant AT1 receptors were evaluated by measuring phospholipase C activity in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. Fig. 7 shows the relative amounts of inositol phosphates accumulated under basal conditions. Cells expressing cysteine mutant receptors in the wild-type background produced inositol phosphates at levels that were not significantly different from that produced by cells expressing the wild-type AT1 receptor. The basal level of inositol phosphates found in cells expressing cysteine mutant receptors in the N111G background was at least 3-fold higher than that found in cells expressing the wild-type AT1 receptor, thereby confirming the constitutive activity of all receptors bearing both cysteine and N111G mutations. These results show that cysteine mutations within TMD2 do not compromise the functional integrity of either the ground state AT1 receptor or the constitutively active N111G-AT1 receptor.

https://openalex.org/W1977294681,"Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common fatal autosomal recessive disorders in the Caucasian population caused by mutations of gene for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). New experimental therapeutic strategies for CF propose a diet supplementation to affect the plasma membrane fluidity and to modulate amplified inflammatory response. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) and vitamin B12 supplementation for ameliorating cell plasma membrane features in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis. Methodology and Principal Findings A single arm trial was conducted from April 2004 to March 2006 in an Italian CF care centre. 31 children with CF aged from 3 to 8 years old were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were diabetes, chronic infections of the airways and regular antibiotics intake. Children with CF were supplemented for 24 weeks with 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF, 7.5 mg /day) and vitamin B12 (0.5 mg/day). Red blood cells (RBCs) were used to investigate plasma membrane, since RBCs share lipid, protein composition and organization with other cell types. We evaluated RBCs membrane lipid composition, membrane protein oxidative damage, cation content, cation transport pathways, plasma and RBCs folate levels and plasma homocysteine levels at baseline and after 24 weeks of 5-MTHF and vitamin B12 supplementation. In CF children, 5-MTHF and vitamin B12 supplementation (i) increased plasma and RBC folate levels; (ii) decreased plasma homocysteine levels; (iii) modified RBC membrane phospholipid fatty acid composition; (iv) increased RBC K+ content; (v) reduced RBC membrane oxidative damage and HSP70 membrane association. Conclusion and Significance 5-MTHF and vitamin B12 supplementation might ameliorate RBC membrane features of children with CF. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00730509"
https://openalex.org/W2060025909,"The development of DNA microarray assays is hampered by two important aspects: processing of the microarrays is done under a single stringency condition, and characteristics such as melting temperature are difficult to predict for immobilized probes. A technical solution to these limitations is to use a thermal gradient and information from melting curves, for instance to score genotypes. However, application of temperature gradients normally requires complicated equipment, and the size of the arrays that can be investigated is restricted due to heat dissipation. Here we present a simple microfluidic device that creates a gradient comprising zones of defined ionic strength over a glass slide, in which each zone corresponds to a subarray. Using this device, we demonstrated that ionic strength gradients function in a similar fashion as corresponding thermal gradients in assay development. More specifically, we noted that (i) the two stringency modulators generated melting curves that could be compared, (ii) both led to increased assay robustness, and (iii) both were associated with difficulties in genotyping the same mutation. These findings demonstrate that ionic strength stringency buffers can be used instead of thermal gradients. Given the flexibility of design of ionic gradients, these can be created over all types of arrays, and encompass an attractive alternative to temperature gradients, avoiding curtailment of the size or spacing of subarrays on slides associated with temperature gradients."
https://openalex.org/W2025277567,"Ku is a heterodimeric protein involved in nonhomologous end-joining of the DNA double-stranded break repair pathway. It binds to the double-stranded DNA ends and then activates a series of repair enzymes that join the broken DNA. In addition to its function in DNA repair, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ku (Yku) is also a component of telomere protein-DNA complexes that affect telomere function. The yeast telomeres are composed of duplex C1–3(A/T)G1–3 telomeric DNA repeats plus single-stranded TG1–3 telomeric DNA tails. Here we show that Yku is capable of binding to a tailed-duplex DNA formed by telomeric DNA that mimics the structure of telomeres. Addition of Cdc13p, a single-stranded telomeric DNA-binding protein, to the Yku-DNA complex enables the formation of a ternary complex with Cdc13p binding to the single-stranded tail of the DNA substrate. Because pre-loading of Cdc13p to the single-stranded telomeric tail inhibits the binding of Yku, the results suggested that loading of Yku and Cdc13p to telomeres is sequential. Through generating a double-stranded break near telomeric DNA sequences, we found that Ku protein appears to bind to the de novo synthesized telomeres earlier than that of Cdc13p in vivo. Thus, our results indicated that Yku interacts directly with telomeres and that sequential loading of Yku followed by Cdc13p to telomeres is required for both proteins to form a ternary complex on telomeres. Our results also offer a mechanism that the binding of Cdc13p to telomeres might prevent Yku from initiating DNA double-stranded break repair pathway on telomeres.

Failure in repairing or mis-repairing double-stranded breaks can lead to chromosome instability and eventually cell death or cancer (1O'Driscoll M. Jeggo P.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Double-stranded breaks are repaired by two main pathways, the homologous recombination and nonhomologous DNA end-joining. In nonhomologous DNA end-joining, Ku is the first protein to bind to the DNA ends to initiate the repair pathway (2Lieber M.R. Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 712-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Upon binding, Ku then recruits a series of repair enzymes to join the broken ends (2Lieber M.R. Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 712-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Ku is a heterodimeric protein composed of 70- and ∼80-kDa subunits. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ku includes Yku70 and Yku80 subunits. Because the biochemical configuration of the broken ends could be very diverse on DSBs, Ku binds to double-stranded ends in a sequence- and energy-independent manner. It is capable of binding to DNA ends with blunt 3′-overhangs or 5′-overhangs as well as double-stranded DNA with nicks, gaps, or internal loops (3Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol.

However, Ku does not have high affinity to single-stranded DNA. The crystal structure of human Ku heterodimer indicates that it forms a ring structure that encircles duplex DNA (7Walker J.R. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Nature. 2001; 412: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). This unique structure feature enables Ku to recognize DNA ends and achieves its high affinity binding. In additional to the role in double-stranded break repair, Ku was shown to be a component of telomeric protein-DNA complex in yeast and mammals (8Hsu H.-L. Gilley D. Blackburn E.H. Chen D.J. Proc.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2485-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The function of yeast Ku (Yku) on telomeres could mediate through protein-protein interaction with Sir4p or protein-RNA interaction with Tlc1 RNA (21Tsukamoto Y. Kato J. Ikeda H. Nature. 1997; 388: 900-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 22Stellwagen A.E. Haimberger Z.W. Veatch J.R. Gottschling D.E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). For example, through the interaction with Sir4p, Yku selectively affects telomeres silencing but not the silent mating type loci (17Laroche T. Martin S.G. Gotta M. Gorham H.C. Pryde F.E. Louis E.J. Gasser S.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 653-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yku could also bind to telomerase Tlc1 RNA for telomere length maintenance (22Stellwagen A.E. Haimberger Z.W. Veatch J.R. Gottschling D.E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Judged by the DNA binding activity of Yku, it is reasonable to suggest that it may bind directly to telomeric DNA. Indeed, it was shown that human Ku is capable of binding directly to telomeric DNA in vitro (15Bianchi A. de Lange T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21223-21227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Moreover, because the deletion of SIR4 in budding yeast (23Martin S.G. Laroche T. Suka N. Grunstein M. Gasser S.M. Cell. 1999; 97: 621-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) or Taz1 in fission yeast (24Miyoshi T. Sadaie M. Kanoh J. Ishikawa F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1924-1931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) does not abolish the association of Ku with chromosomal ends, this suggests that Ku might bind directly to telomeric DNA in cells. However, because yeast telomeres have a short 12–14-mer single-stranded tail (25Larrivee M. LeBel C. Wellinger R.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), it is uncertain whether Yku could pass the single-stranded region to reach its binding site. The direct binding of Yku to telomeric DNA has not been experimentally determined. In contrast to double-stranded breaks, the ends of linear chromosomes are not recognized by repair enzymes as DNA damage. In S. cerevisiae, Cdc13p is the single-stranded TG1–3 DNA-binding protein that enables cells to differentiate whether the ends of a linear DNA are telomeres or broken ends (26Lin J.-J. Zakian V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13760-13765Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 27Nugent C.I. Hughes T.R. Lue N.F. Lundblad V.

Chem. 2003; 278: 9318-9321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, although the mechanism of how cells prevent the activation of DSB repair pathway in telomere is unclear, it is likely that binding of Cdc13p to telomeres might inhibit the initiation of DNA damage response by the Ku protein. Here, using a tailed-duplex DNA synthesized by telomeric DNA sequences to mimic telomere structure, we showed that Yku binds directly to this tailed-duplex DNA substrate and forms a ternary complex with Cdc13p. Our results also showed that Yku loaded to a de novo synthesized telomere earlier than Cdc13p in vivo. These results support the direct binding of Yku to telomeric DNA and that the spatial orientation of Cdc13p might block the activation of DSB repair pathway on telomeres. Purification of Yku from Yeast—Yeast BJ2168 cells (MATa leu2 trp1 ura3-52 prb1-1122 pep4-3 prc1-407 gal2) carrying pRS425TEF-YKU70-TAP and pRS423TEF-YKU80-TAP was employed to isolate Yku heterodimer from yeast (A gift from D. E. Gottschling, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle). Purification of the Yku protein was conducted according to the procedure described by Stellwagen et al. (22Stellwagen A.E. Haimberger Z.W. Veatch J.R. Gottschling D.E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Purification of His6-tagged Cdc13(451–693)p—The Escherichia coli expression system was used for Cdc13(451–693)p expression. Plasmids pET6H-CDC13(451–693) carrying the cdc13R635C mutation of CDC13 were constructed by ligating the 0.73-kbp BamHI-NruI cdc13R635C DNA fragment of pRS315ΔB-CDC13 with pET6H that was linearized with the same enzymes (30Lin Y.-C. Lee Y.-H.W. Lin J.-J. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS was used as the host for Cdc13(451–693)p expression. The purification procedure was as described previously (31Lin Y.-C. Hsu C.-L. Shih J.-W. Lin J.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24588-24593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Purification of Recombinant Yku Proteins from Sf21 Cells—Insect cell line Sf21 was used as the host for baculovirus propagation, expression, and purification of recombinant Yku70p and Yku80p. Plasmid pBac6His-YKU70 was constructed by inserting a 1.8-kbp NcoI-SalI fragment of YKU70 to NcoI- and SalI-digested pBac6His (31Lin Y.-C. Hsu C.-L. Shih J.-W. Lin J.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24588-24593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Similarly, plasmid pBac6His-YKU80 was constructed by inserting a 1.9-kbp NcoI-SalI fragment of YKU80 to NcoI- and SalI-digested pBac6His. These plasmids enabled the expression of Yku70p or Yku80p with His6 tagged at the N terminus. Recombinant viruses were generated by co-transfection of plasmid pBac6His-YKU70 or pBac6His-YKU80 and Bac-N-Blue DNA to Sf21 cells (Invitrogen). To purify His6-tagged Yku70 or Yku80, ∼5 × 107 Sf21 cells were infected with 25 × 107 recombinant viruses for 4 days. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed by the addition of lysis buffer (6 m guanidine HCl, 100 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8, 10 mm Tris-HCl). The suspensions were incubated on ice for 60 min and sonicated. Total cell extracts were then collected by centrifugation. Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) was utilized to purify the His6-tagged Yku70p or Yku80p. Batch purification protocol was used according to manufacturer's suggestion. The bound His6-tagged Yku70p or Yku80p protein was first washed with lysis buffer containing 20 mm imidazole and eluted by the same buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. To renature the purified Yku70p and Yku80p proteins, proteins eluted from Ni-NTA-agarose column was diluted to ∼50 μg/ml and dialyzed against renaturation buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 m l-arginine, 20% glycerol) at 4 °C for 12 h. Purified protein was aliquoted and frozen by dry ice/ethanol bath. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Oligonucleotide (Table 1) was first 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 mCi/mm; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and subsequently purified from a 10% sequencing gel after electrophoresis. To prepare the duplex or tailed-duplex DNA substrates, the 5′-end-labeled DNA was mixed with an excess amount of unlabeled complementary DNA and incubated at 100 °C for 5 min. The DNA mixtures were then cooled under room temperature and subsequently separated by a native 8% polyacrylamide gel to isolate the duplex or tailed-duplex DNA substrates. To perform the assays, purified proteins were mixed with 2.0 ng of 32P-labeled DNA with a total volume of 15 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The mixtures were allowed to incubate at room temperature for 10 min. 3 μl of 80% glycerol was then added, and the mixtures were loaded on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, which were pre-run at 125 V for 10 min. Electrophoresis was carried out in TBE (89 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA) at 125 V for 105 min. The gels were dried and autoradiographed. Binding activity was quantified using a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare).TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used in this study DNase I Footprint Analysis—Telomeric DNA RT1 were 5′-labeled, annealed to RT2, and purified as described above. The DNA was mixed with Yku protein in 50 μl of reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. DNase I (0.2 unit) was added and incubated at 37 °C for another 10 min. The reaction was stopped with 10 μl of 250 mm EGTA. The DNA was then precipitated at –70 °C by adding 1 μl of 10 mg/ml oyster glycogen and 150 μl of ethanol. The precipitant was collected by centrifugation, dried, and analyzed by electrophoresis using 10% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Analysis on a de Novo Synthesized Telomere—Yeast strain YJL0801 was generated by introducing a CDC13-myc9::TRP1 into UCC5706 (MATa-inc ura3-52 lys2-801 ade2-101 trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1::GAL1-HO-LEU-2 VII-L::ADE2-TG1–3-HO site-LYS2 rad52::hisG, a gift of D. E. Gottschling (32Diede S.J. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1999; 99: 723-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar)) and then transformed with plasmid pRS423TEF-KU80-TAP (22Stellwagen A.E. Haimberger Z.W. Veatch J.R. Gottschling D.E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The strain was used in chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments on de novo synthesized telomeres (32Diede S.J. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1999; 99: 723-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast cells were grown in medium (2.5% raffinose) lacking histidine, tryptophan, and lysine until the cells reach the concentration of 7 × 106 cells/ml. The cells were then arrested at M phase using 10 μg/ml nocodazole at 30 °C until ∼90% of cells with the morphology of large buds. To induce HO endonuclease expression, the nocodazole-treated cells were centrifuged and resuspended in prewarmed medium containing 3% galactose and 10 μg/ml nocodazole. HO cutting efficiency was determined by Southern blotting analysis using probe near the HO site at different time points (see Fig. 7). Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described (33Taggart A.K.P. Teng S.-C. Zakian V.A. Science. 2002; 297: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), except that the TAP-tagged Ku80 was precipitated directly by IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and anti-Myc antibody followed by protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) was used for the Cdc13p immunoprecipitations. Quantification of the immunoprecipitated DNAs was achieved using real time PCR on a StepOne real time system (Applied Biosystems). Enrichment of DNA from the sequences inserted near the HO cut site (XIP) over an internal control DNA (XIPi) located about 47 kb from the left arm of chromosome VII was determined after normalization. Primer pairs used in amplifying XIP and XIPi were as described (34Diede S.J. Gottschling D.E. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1336-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Values determined from immunoprecipitates were then normalized against values obtained from total cell extracts (input). Yku Bound to Duplex and Tailed-duplex TG1–3 DNA in Vitro— Human Ku binds to double-stranded ends in a sequence-independent manner. It was shown that the exact structure of the DNA ends does not appear to be crucial for its binding. Human Ku binds to DNA ends with 5′- or 3′-overhangs, or with hairpin loops (5Falzon M. Fewell J.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10546-10552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Rathmell W.K. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4741-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and it was also shown to bind to tailed-duplex DNA structure formed by telomeric DNA (15Bianchi A. de Lange T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21223-21227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, it is interesting to test if Yku also bind to telomeric DNA in vitro. Using TAP-tagged Yku80, Yku was purified to near-homogeneity after two rounds of affinity purifications (Fig. 1A). The DNA binding activity of the purified Yku was accessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Similar to the property of mammalian Ku, the purified Yku bound to double-stranded DNA formed by two oligonucleotides with random sequences, did not bind to single-stranded DNA with the same sequences, and required a DNA end for binding (data not shown). To determine whether Yku can bind to duplex telomeric DNA, two complementary oligonucleotides with telomeric DNA sequences were synthesized and annealed (T1T2). The resulting duplex DNA has 9 bp of telomeric DNA on both ends. Yku appeared to bind efficiently to T1T2 telomeric DNA duplex (Fig. 1B). We next designed a tailed-duplex DNA substrate by annealing T3 and T4 oligonucleotides. The resulting DNA mimics the structure of telomere that has a 9-bp telomeric DNA duplex and a 15 mer-single-stranded G-tail on both ends. As shown in Fig. 1B, Yku formed complexes to the tailed-duplex DNA, and it also appeared that two complexes were formed with the DNA substrate indicating that Yku might bind to both ends of the DNA substrate. To further investigate the binding of Yku on tailed-duplex telomeric DNA, DNase I footprint experiments were conducted. The length of the duplex DNA substrate was extended to 65 bases (RT1RT2) to increase the resolution of the experiment. Results shown in Fig. 1C showed the autoradiograms of DNase I footprint analysis and the summary of the footprint results. Our results clearly indicated that Yku protein made two distinct footprints on the tailed-duplex DNA. Analysis of the locations of these two DNase I-protected regions indicated that Yku bound to both ends of the duplex DNA with protected regions of 13 and 15 bp on both ends (Fig. 1C). Because DNase I preferentially digests duplex over single-stranded DNA, the binding of Yku on single-stranded telomeric DNA cannot be determined here. Nevertheless, our results clearly indicated that Yku bound to the duplex and single-stranded junctions of the tailed duplex telomeric DNA. Using EMSA as an assay, we next determined the binding affinity of Yku to duplex DNA or tailed-duplex DNA (Table 2). For a better comparison, we have designed a set of DNA substrates with the same length (Table 1). Under our assay conditions, Yku bound to telomeric DNA duplex with an affinity similar to that of random-sequence DNA duplex (Table 2, compare T11T12 with R5R6). The addition of a 15-mer single-stranded tail with random sequence decreased slightly the binding affinity (compare R7R8 with R5R6). Interestingly, the single-stranded telomeric tail reduced the binding affinity by ∼3-fold (compare T13T14 with R5R6). Thus, our results indicated that Yku is capable of binding to tailed-duplex telomeric DNA, although with an affinity moderately lower than that of other double-stranded ends.TABLE 2Binding affinity of Yku to DNA substratesDNA substrateDescriptionLength (duplex + single strand tail)Kd,appnmR5R6Duplex18 + 053 ± 13T11T12Duplex18 + 088 ± 28R7R8Tailed-duplex18 + 1577 ± 30T13T14Tailed-duplex18 + 15186 ± 43 Open table in a new tab Sequential Formation of Ternary Complex on Telomeres by Yku and Cdc13p—Except for late S phase, a single-stranded tail with 12–14-mer TG1–3 sequence was detected in most parts of the cell cycle (25Larrivee M. LeBel C. Wellinger R.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We were next interested in testing whether such a single-stranded tail is sufficient for binding by both Yku and Cdc13p. The T3T4 tailed-duplex DNA was used as the substrate in our studies. We have also expressed a His6-tagged Cdc13(451–693)p in E. coli and purified this tagged protein using Ni-NTA-agarose (Fig. 2A). The His6-tagged Cdc13(451–693)p contains the DNA binding domain and has been shown previously that it has the single-stranded telomeric DNA binding activity similar to that of full-length Cdc13p (31Lin Y.-C. Hsu C.-L. Shih J.-W. Lin J.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24588-24593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The result shown in Fig. 2B demonstrated that this His6-tagged Cdc13(451–693)p is capable of binding to the tailed-duplex DNA substrate (lanes 6–9). Interestingly, after initial loading of Yku, the substrate could then be bound by Cdc13(451–693)p to form several ternary complexes (Fig. 2B, lanes 11–13). Judging by the relative migrations and supershift analyses, the c1 complex may have two molecules of Yku and one molecule of Cdc13 on one DNA, whereas c2 and c3 each has one molecule of Yku and one or two molecules of Cdc13p, respectively. Thus, our DNA substrate that mimics the structure of telomere enables the formation of ternary complex by both Yku and Cdc13p. Moreover, because pre-loading of Cdc13p appeared to inhibit the binding of Yku to DNA, the result also indicated that the formation of these ternary complexes was sequential (Fig. 2B, lanes 14–17). To further demonstrate that specific binding of Cdc13p to single-stranded telomeric tail is required for the formation of ternary complex, similar experiments were conducted using DNA substrates that were either without the single-stranded tail (R1R2) or with a random-sequence single-stranded tail (R3R4). Results shown in Fig. 3 clearly indicated that a single-stranded telomeric tail is required for Cdc13p to bind and to form ternary complexes with Yku. We have previously isolated several cdc13 mutants that are defective in binding to telomeric DNA (30Lin Y.-C. Lee Y.-H.W. Lin J.-J. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). One of the mutants with an alternation from Arg-635 to Cys (R635C) failed to interact with single-stranded telomeric DNA. The Arg-635 was shown to be located at the DNA-binding surface of Cdc13p (36Mitton-Fry R.M. Anderson E.M. Hughes T.R. Lundblad V. Wuttke D.S. Science. 2002; 296: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We next analyzed if the telomere binding activity of Cdc13p is required for ternary complex formation. Using the procedures similar to that in purifying wild-type protein, we have purified Cdc13(451–693)p with the R635C mutation to homogeneity (Fig. 4A). Formation of the ternary complex by Cdc13R635C mutant was then tested on T3T4 tailed-duplex DNA. The purified Cdc13R635C mutant failed to bind to the DNA substrate (Fig. 4B, lanes 5–8). It also failed to form a ternary complex with Yku and did not affect the binding of Yku to DNA. Thus, our results indicated that Cdc13p binds to the single-stranded telomeric DNA portion of the tailed-duplex DNA, and its binding activity is required for the formation of ternary complex with Yku.FIGURE 4Telomeric DNA binding activity of Cdc13(451–693)p is required for ternary complex formation.

B, Cdc13(451–693)R635Cp fails to form complex with Yku-DNA. Around 2 ng of 32P-labeled T3T4 DNA substrate were incubated with Yku and/or Cdc13(451–693) R635Cp and analyzed by EMSA. The amounts of Yku used in lanes 2–5 and 14–17 were 50, 150, 450, and 1350 nm, respectively. Lanes 10–13 each has 1350 nm Yku. The amounts of Cdc13(451–693)R635Cp were the same as those for Fig. 2B. An autoradiogram is shown here.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Stably Formed Yku Ring Is Required for Formation of Yku-Cdc13p-DNA Ternary Complex—Because human Ku heterodimer forms a ring structure to encircle DNA and it binds DNA through the open ends (7Walker J.R. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Nature. 2001; 412: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to postulate that Yku interacts with telomeres in the form of a ring structure. Thus, a simple interpretation on the inhibition of Yku binding by pre-loaded Cdc13p would be Cdc13p blocking the passage of Yku ring to its target site. However, it is still possible that the pre-loaded Cdc13p occupies the DNA-binding site of Yku to prevent the binding of Yku. To rule out this possibility, we prepared recombinant Yku70 and Yku80 (rYku) separately from insect Sf21 cells using baculovirus expression systems (Fig. 5A). Although neither of these two recombinant proteins bound to blunt-end duplex DNA, the Yku activity could be readily reconstituted by mixing these two proteins (Fig. 5B). The reconstituted Yku did not bind to single-stranded DNA (Fig. 5C). The binding activity of the reconstituted Yku to the DNA ends was further confirmed by competition analysis using close circle and restriction enzyme-digested plasmid DNA. The rYku-DNA complex cannot be competed away by close circular plasmid, whereas it was readily competed away by DNAs that were digested with restriction enzymes to expose DNA ends (Fig. 5D). The degree of competition did not appear to be dependent on the type of free DNA ends generated as 3′-overhang generated by PstI competed as well as 5′-overhang generated by HindIII or blunt ends generated by PvuII. Instead, competition was increased as the number of free DNA ends increased (Fig. 5D, lane 7). Thus, the binding activity of reconstituted Yku to telomere tail-duplex DNA was specific for DNA ends, and its binding activity is similar to that of endogenous Yku protein. However, in contrast to the Yku isolated from yeast that has a half-life on DNA for >60 min, the reconstituted protein did not stably bind to DNA. It had an estimated half-life on DNA for ∼1 min (Fig. 5E). The reconstituted Yku heterodimer did not appear to form a stable ring-like structure on DNA. Although the mechanism of how reconstituted Yku is less stable on DNA is not clear to us, it is"
