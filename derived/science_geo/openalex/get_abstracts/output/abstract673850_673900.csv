https://openalex.org/W3162306949,"Ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death that is induced by excessive lipid peroxidation, is a key tumour suppression mechanism1-4. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)5,6 and ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1)7,8 constitute two major ferroptosis defence systems. Here we show that treatment of cancer cells with GPX4 inhibitors results in acute depletion of N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate, a pyrimidine biosynthesis intermediate, with concomitant accumulation of uridine. Supplementation with dihydroorotate or orotate-the substrate and product of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH)-attenuates or potentiates ferroptosis induced by inhibition of GPX4, respectively, and these effects are particularly pronounced in cancer cells with low expression of GPX4 (GPX4low). Inactivation of DHODH induces extensive mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in GPX4low cancer cells, and synergizes with ferroptosis inducers to induce these effects in GPX4high cancer cells. Mechanistically, DHODH operates in parallel to mitochondrial GPX4 (but independently of cytosolic GPX4 or FSP1) to inhibit ferroptosis in the mitochondrial inner membrane by reducing ubiquinone to ubiquinol (a radical-trapping antioxidant with anti-ferroptosis activity). The DHODH inhibitor brequinar selectively suppresses GPX4low tumour growth by inducing ferroptosis, whereas combined treatment with brequinar and sulfasalazine, an FDA-approved drug with ferroptosis-inducing activity, synergistically induces ferroptosis and suppresses GPX4high tumour growth. Our results identify a DHODH-mediated ferroptosis defence mechanism in mitochondria and suggest a therapeutic strategy of targeting ferroptosis in cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3160045927,"Advanced beyond-silicon electronic technology requires both channel materials and also ultralow-resistance contacts to be discovered1,2. Atomically thin two-dimensional semiconductors have great potential for realizing high-performance electronic devices1,3. However, owing to metal-induced gap states (MIGS)4-7, energy barriers at the metal-semiconductor interface-which fundamentally lead to high contact resistance and poor current-delivery capability-have constrained the improvement of two-dimensional semiconductor transistors so far2,8,9. Here we report ohmic contact between semimetallic bismuth and semiconducting monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) where the MIGS are sufficiently suppressed and degenerate states in the TMD are spontaneously formed in contact with bismuth. Through this approach, we achieve zero Schottky barrier height, a contact resistance of 123 ohm micrometres and an on-state current density of 1,135 microamps per micrometre on monolayer MoS2; these two values are, to the best of our knowledge, the lowest and highest yet recorded, respectively. We also demonstrate that excellent ohmic contacts can be formed on various monolayer semiconductors, including MoS2, WS2 and WSe2. Our reported contact resistances are a substantial improvement for two-dimensional semiconductors, and approach the quantum limit. This technology unveils the potential of high-performance monolayer transistors that are on par with state-of-the-art three-dimensional semiconductors, enabling further device downscaling and extending Moore's law."
https://openalex.org/W3163348136,"Fibroblasts are non-haematopoietic structural cells that define the architecture of organs, support the homeostasis of tissue-resident cells and have key roles in fibrosis, cancer, autoimmunity and wound healing1. Recent studies have described fibroblast heterogeneity within individual tissues1. However, the field lacks a characterization of fibroblasts at single-cell resolution across tissues in healthy and diseased organs. Here we constructed fibroblast atlases by integrating single-cell transcriptomic data from about 230,000 fibroblasts across 17 tissues, 50 datasets, 11 disease states and 2 species. Mouse fibroblast atlases and a DptIRESCreERT2 knock-in mouse identified two universal fibroblast transcriptional subtypes across tissues. Our analysis suggests that these cells can serve as a reservoir that can yield specialized fibroblasts across a broad range of steady-state tissues and activated fibroblasts in disease. Comparison to an atlas of human fibroblasts from perturbed states showed that fibroblast transcriptional states are conserved between mice and humans, including universal fibroblasts and activated phenotypes associated with pathogenicity in human cancer, fibrosis, arthritis and inflammation. In summary, a cross-species and pan-tissue approach to transcriptomics at single-cell resolution has identified key organizing principles of the fibroblast lineage in health and disease. Single-cell and genetic tools are used to characterize the diversity of fibroblasts across healthy and perturbed tissues in mice and humans."
https://openalex.org/W3161343553,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can restore communication to people who have lost the ability to move or speak. So far, a major focus of BCI research has been on restoring gross motor skills, such as reaching and grasping1-5 or point-and-click typing with a computer cursor6,7. However, rapid sequences of highly dexterous behaviours, such as handwriting or touch typing, might enable faster rates of communication. Here we developed an intracortical BCI that decodes attempted handwriting movements from neural activity in the motor cortex and translates it to text in real time, using a recurrent neural network decoding approach. With this BCI, our study participant, whose hand was paralysed from spinal cord injury, achieved typing speeds of 90 characters per minute with 94.1% raw accuracy online, and greater than 99% accuracy offline with a general-purpose autocorrect. To our knowledge, these typing speeds exceed those reported for any other BCI, and are comparable to typical smartphone typing speeds of individuals in the age group of our participant (115 characters per minute)8. Finally, theoretical considerations explain why temporally complex movements, such as handwriting, may be fundamentally easier to decode than point-to-point movements. Our results open a new approach for BCIs and demonstrate the feasibility of accurately decoding rapid, dexterous movements years after paralysis."
https://openalex.org/W3161778279,"Ageing of the immune system, or immunosenescence, contributes to the morbidity and mortality of the elderly1,2. To define the contribution of immune system ageing to organism ageing, here we selectively deleted Ercc1, which encodes a crucial DNA repair protein3,4, in mouse haematopoietic cells to increase the burden of endogenous DNA damage and thereby senescence5–7 in the immune system only. We show that Vav-iCre+/−;Ercc1−/fl mice were healthy into adulthood, then displayed premature onset of immunosenescence characterized by attrition and senescence of specific immune cell populations and impaired immune function, similar to changes that occur during ageing in wild-type mice8–10. Notably, non-lymphoid organs also showed increased senescence and damage, which suggests that senescent, aged immune cells can promote systemic ageing. The transplantation of splenocytes from Vav-iCre+/−;Ercc1−/fl or aged wild-type mice into young mice induced senescence in trans, whereas the transplantation of young immune cells attenuated senescence. The treatment of Vav-iCre+/−;Ercc1−/fl mice with rapamycin reduced markers of senescence in immune cells and improved immune function11,12. These data demonstrate that an aged, senescent immune system has a causal role in driving systemic ageing and therefore represents a key therapeutic target to extend healthy ageing. An aged, senescent immune system has a causal role in driving systemic ageing, and the targeting of senescent immune cells with senolytic drugs has the potential to suppress morbidities associated with old age."

https://openalex.org/W3163076983,"The COVID-19 pandemic has seen the emergence of digital contact tracing to help to prevent the spread of the disease. A mobile phone app records proximity events between app users, and when a user tests positive for COVID-19, their recent contacts can be notified instantly. Theoretical evidence has supported this new public health intervention1–6, but its epidemiological impact has remained uncertain7. Here we investigate the impact of the National Health Service (NHS) COVID-19 app for England and Wales, from its launch on 24 September 2020 to the end of December 2020. It was used regularly by approximately 16.5 million users (28% of the total population), and sent approximately 1.7 million exposure notifications: 4.2 per index case consenting to contact tracing. We estimated that the fraction of individuals notified by the app who subsequently showed symptoms and tested positive (the secondary attack rate (SAR)) was 6%, similar to the SAR for manually traced close contacts. We estimated the number of cases averted by the app using two complementary approaches: modelling based on the notifications and SAR gave an estimate of 284,000 (central 95% range of sensitivity analyses 108,000–450,000), and statistical comparison of matched neighbouring local authorities gave an estimate of 594,000 (95% confidence interval 317,000–914,000). Approximately one case was averted for each case consenting to notification of their contacts. We estimated that for every percentage point increase in app uptake, the number of cases could be reduced by 0.8% (using modelling) or 2.3% (using statistical analysis). These findings support the continued development and deployment of such apps in populations that are awaiting full protection from vaccines. Statistical analysis of COVID-19 transmission among users of a smartphone-based digital contact-tracing app suggests that such apps can be an effective measure for reducing disease spread."
https://openalex.org/W3163640205,"The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the ongoing pandemic of COVID-191. Coronaviruses have developed a variety of mechanisms to repress host mRNA translation to allow the translation of viral mRNA, and concomitantly block the cellular innate immune response2,3. Although several different proteins of SARS-CoV-2 have previously been implicated in shutting off host expression4–7, a comprehensive picture of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cellular gene expression is lacking. Here we combine RNA sequencing, ribosome profiling and metabolic labelling of newly synthesized RNA to comprehensively define the mechanisms that are used by SARS-CoV-2 to shut off cellular protein synthesis. We show that infection leads to a global reduction in translation, but that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated. Instead, we find that infection leads to the accelerated degradation of cytosolic cellular mRNAs, which facilitates viral takeover of the mRNA pool in infected cells. We reveal that the translation of transcripts that are induced in response to infection (including innate immune genes) is impaired. We demonstrate this impairment is probably mediated by inhibition of nuclear mRNA export, which prevents newly transcribed cellular mRNA from accessing ribosomes. Overall, our results uncover a multipronged strategy that is used by SARS-CoV-2 to take over the translation machinery and to suppress host defences. RNA sequencing, ribosome profiling and metabolic labelling of newly synthesized RNA reveal the strategy used by SARS-CoV-2 to shut off cellular protein synthesis in the host and allow the translation of viral transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W3163303881,"The most promising quantum algorithms require quantum processors that host millions of quantum bits when targeting practical applications1. A key challenge towards large-scale quantum computation is the interconnect complexity. In current solid-state qubit implementations, an important interconnect bottleneck appears between the quantum chip in a dilution refrigerator and the room-temperature electronics. Advanced lithography supports the fabrication of both control electronics and qubits in silicon using technology compatible with complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOS)2. When the electronics are designed to operate at cryogenic temperatures, they can ultimately be integrated with the qubits on the same die or package, overcoming the 'wiring bottleneck'3-6. Here we report a cryogenic CMOS control chip operating at 3 kelvin, which outputs tailored microwave bursts to drive silicon quantum bits cooled to 20 millikelvin. We first benchmark the control chip and find an electrical performance consistent with qubit operations of 99.99 per cent fidelity, assuming ideal qubits. Next, we use it to coherently control actual qubits encoded in the spin of single electrons confined in silicon quantum dots7-9 and find that the cryogenic control chip achieves the same fidelity as commercial instruments at room temperature. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capabilities of the control chip by programming a number of benchmarking protocols, as well as the Deutsch-Josza algorithm10, on a two-qubit quantum processor. These results open up the way towards a fully integrated, scalable silicon-based quantum computer."

https://openalex.org/W3162058804,"Humans and their microbiota have coevolved a mutually beneficial relationship in which the human host provides a hospitable environment for the microorganisms and the microbiota provides many advantages for the host, including nutritional benefits and protection from pathogen infection1. Maintaining this relationship requires a careful immune balance to contain commensal microorganisms within the lumen while limiting inflammatory anti-commensal responses1,2. Antigen-specific recognition of intestinal microorganisms by T cells has previously been described3,4. Although the local environment shapes the differentiation of effector cells3-5 it is unclear how microbiota-specific T cells are educated in the thymus. Here we show that intestinal colonization in early life leads to the trafficking of microbial antigens from the intestine to the thymus by intestinal dendritic cells, which then induce the expansion of microbiota-specific T cells. Once in the periphery, microbiota-specific T cells have pathogenic potential or can protect against related pathogens. In this way, the developing microbiota shapes and expands the thymic and peripheral T cell repertoire, allowing for enhanced recognition of intestinal microorganisms and pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3163881056,"The activities of RNA polymerase and the spliceosome are responsible for the heterogeneity in the abundance and isoform composition of mRNA in human cells. However, the dynamics of these megadalton enzymatic complexes working in concert on endogenous genes have not been described. Here, we establish a quasi-genome-scale platform for observing synthesis and processing kinetics of single nascent RNA molecules in real time. We find that all observed genes show transcriptional bursting. We also observe large kinetic variation in intron removal for single introns in single cells, which is inconsistent with deterministic splice site selection. Transcriptome-wide footprinting of the U2AF complex, nascent RNA profiling, long-read sequencing, and lariat sequencing further reveal widespread stochastic recursive splicing within introns. We propose and validate a unified theoretical model to explain the general features of transcription and pervasive stochastic splice site selection."
https://openalex.org/W3161529933,"Homologous recombination (HR) repairs DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle1-3. Several HR proteins are preferentially recruited to DSBs at transcriptionally active loci4-10, but how transcription promotes HR is poorly understood. Here we develop an assay to assess the effect of local transcription on HR. Using this assay, we find that transcription stimulates HR to a substantial extent. Tethering RNA transcripts to the vicinity of DSBs recapitulates the effects of local transcription, which suggests that transcription enhances HR through RNA transcripts. Tethered RNA transcripts stimulate HR in a sequence- and orientation-dependent manner, indicating that they function by forming DNA-RNA hybrids. In contrast to most HR proteins, RAD51-associated protein 1 (RAD51AP1) only promotes HR when local transcription is active. RAD51AP1 drives the formation of R-loops in vitro and is required for tethered RNAs to stimulate HR in cells. Notably, RAD51AP1 is necessary for the DSB-induced formation of DNA-RNA hybrids in donor DNA, linking R-loops to D-loops. In vitro, RAD51AP1-generated R-loops enhance the RAD51-mediated formation of D-loops locally and give rise to intermediates that we term 'DR-loops', which contain both DNA-DNA and DNA-RNA hybrids and favour RAD51 function. Thus, at DSBs in transcribed regions, RAD51AP1 promotes the invasion of RNA transcripts into donor DNA, and stimulates HR through the formation of DR-loops."
https://openalex.org/W3163292139,"Knowing where we are, where we have been, and where we are going is critical to many behaviors, including navigation and memory. One potential neuronal mechanism underlying this ability is phase precession, in which spatially tuned neurons represent sequences of positions by activating at progressively earlier phases of local network theta oscillations. Based on studies in rodents, researchers have hypothesized that phase precession may be a general neural pattern for representing sequential events for learning and memory. By recording human single-neuron activity during spatial navigation, we show that spatially tuned neurons in the human hippocampus and entorhinal cortex exhibit phase precession. Furthermore, beyond the neural representation of locations, we show evidence for phase precession related to specific goal states. Our findings thus extend theta phase precession to humans and suggest that this phenomenon has a broad functional role for the neural representation of both spatial and non-spatial information."

https://openalex.org/W3160119673,"Adaptive thermogenesis has attracted much attention because of its ability to increase systemic energy expenditure and to counter obesity and diabetes1-3. Recent data have indicated that thermogenic fat cells use creatine to stimulate futile substrate cycling, dissipating chemical energy as heat4,5. This model was based on the super-stoichiometric relationship between the amount of creatine added to mitochondria and the quantity of oxygen consumed. Here we provide direct evidence for the molecular basis of this futile creatine cycling activity in mice. Thermogenic fat cells have robust phosphocreatine phosphatase activity, which is attributed to tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP). TNAP hydrolyses phosphocreatine to initiate a futile cycle of creatine dephosphorylation and phosphorylation. Unlike in other cells, TNAP in thermogenic fat cells is localized to the mitochondria, where futile creatine cycling occurs. TNAP expression is powerfully induced when mice are exposed to cold conditions, and its inhibition in isolated mitochondria leads to a loss of futile creatine cycling. In addition, genetic ablation of TNAP in adipocytes reduces whole-body energy expenditure and leads to rapid-onset obesity in mice, with no change in movement or feeding behaviour. These data illustrate the critical role of TNAP as a phosphocreatine phosphatase in the futile creatine cycle."
https://openalex.org/W3161575169,"Abstract Atmospheric acidity is increasingly determined by carbon dioxide and organic acids 1–3 . Among the latter, formic acid facilitates the nucleation of cloud droplets 4 and contributes to the acidity of clouds and rainwater 1,5 . At present, chemistry–climate models greatly underestimate the atmospheric burden of formic acid, because key processes related to its sources and sinks remain poorly understood 2,6–9 . Here we present atmospheric chamber experiments that show that formaldehyde is efficiently converted to gaseous formic acid via a multiphase pathway that involves its hydrated form, methanediol. In warm cloud droplets, methanediol undergoes fast outgassing but slow dehydration. Using a chemistry–climate model, we estimate that the gas-phase oxidation of methanediol produces up to four times more formic acid than all other known chemical sources combined. Our findings reconcile model predictions and measurements of formic acid abundance. The additional formic acid burden increases atmospheric acidity by reducing the pH of clouds and rainwater by up to 0.3. The diol mechanism presented here probably applies to other aldehydes and may help to explain the high atmospheric levels of other organic acids that affect aerosol growth and cloud evolution."

https://openalex.org/W3163624776,"AMPA-selective glutamate receptors mediate the transduction of signals between the neuronal circuits of the hippocampus1. The trafficking, localization, kinetics and pharmacology of AMPA receptors are tuned by an ensemble of auxiliary protein subunits, which are integral membrane proteins that associate with the receptor to yield bona fide receptor signalling complexes2. Thus far, extensive studies of recombinant AMPA receptor-auxiliary subunit complexes using engineered protein constructs have not been able to faithfully elucidate the molecular architecture of hippocampal AMPA receptor complexes. Here we obtain mouse hippocampal, calcium-impermeable AMPA receptor complexes using immunoaffinity purification and use single-molecule fluorescence and cryo-electron microscopy experiments to elucidate three major AMPA receptor-auxiliary subunit complexes. The GluA1-GluA2, GluA1-GluA2-GluA3 and GluA2-GluA3 receptors are the predominant assemblies, with the auxiliary subunits TARP-γ8 and CNIH2-SynDIG4 non-stochastically positioned at the B'/D' and A'/C' positions, respectively. We further demonstrate how the receptor-TARP-γ8 stoichiometry explains the mechanism of and submaximal inhibition by a clinically relevant, brain-region-specific allosteric inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W3162473212,"Telomerase is unique among the reverse transcriptases in containing a noncoding RNA (known as telomerase RNA (TER)) that includes a short template that is used for the processive synthesis of G-rich telomeric DNA repeats at the 3' ends of most eukaryotic chromosomes1. Telomerase maintains genomic integrity, and its activity or dysregulation are critical determinants of human longevity, stem cell renewal and cancer progression2,3. Previous cryo-electron microscopy structures have established the general architecture, protein components and stoichiometries of Tetrahymena and human telomerase, but our understandings of the details of DNA-protein and RNA-protein interactions and of the mechanisms and recruitment involved remain limited4-6. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of active Tetrahymena telomerase with telomeric DNA at different steps of nucleotide addition. Interactions between telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), TER and DNA reveal the structural basis of the determination of the 5' and 3' template boundaries, handling of the template-DNA duplex and separation of the product strand during nucleotide addition. The structure and binding interface between TERT and telomerase protein p50 (a homologue of human TPP17,8) define conserved interactions that are required for telomerase activation and recruitment to telomeres. Telomerase La-related protein p65 remodels several regions of TER, bridging the 5' and 3' ends and the conserved pseudoknot to facilitate assembly of the TERT-TER catalytic core."
https://openalex.org/W3163944831,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the cause of one of the most important infectious diseases in humans, which leads to 1.4 million deaths every year1. Specialized protein transport systems-known as type VII secretion systems (T7SSs)-are central to the virulence of this pathogen, and are also crucial for nutrient and metabolite transport across the mycobacterial cell envelope2,3. Here we present the structure of an intact T7SS inner-membrane complex of M. tuberculosis. We show how the 2.32-MDa ESX-5 assembly, which contains 165 transmembrane helices, is restructured and stabilized as a trimer of dimers by the MycP5 protease. A trimer of MycP5 caps a central periplasmic dome-like chamber that is formed by three EccB5 dimers, with the proteolytic sites of MycP5 facing towards the cavity. This chamber suggests a central secretion and processing conduit. Complexes without MycP5 show disruption of the EccB5 periplasmic assembly and increased flexibility, which highlights the importance of MycP5 for complex integrity. Beneath the EccB5-MycP5 chamber, dimers of the EccC5 ATPase assemble into three bundles of four transmembrane helices each, which together seal the potential central secretion channel. Individual cytoplasmic EccC5 domains adopt two distinctive conformations that probably reflect different secretion states. Our work suggests a previously undescribed mechanism of protein transport and provides a structural scaffold to aid in the development of drugs against this major human pathogen."

The prevalence of early introduction of complementary feeding, low meal frequency, and low dietary diversity are frequent in LMICs. The effect of inappropriate complementary feeding practices on the nutritional status of children is not well documented in East African countries including Tanzania. Therefore, this study aimed at determining the effect of inappropriate complementary feeding practices on the nutritional status of children aged 6-24 months in urban Moshi, Tanzania.A retrospective cohort study was done using the Pasua and Majengo cohorts of mother-child pairs in urban Moshi who were enrolled from 2002 to 2017. About 3355 mother-child pairs were included in the analysis. Appropriate complementary feeding practices were assessed using WHO IYFP indicators such as age at introduction of solid, semi-solid, or soft foods, minimum dietary diversity, and minimum meal frequency. Nutritional status (stunting, wasting, and underweight) was determined. Multilevel modeling was applied to obtain the effect of inappropriate complementary feeding practices on the nutritional status of children and to account for the clustering effect of mothers and children and the correlation of repeated measures within each child.Majority of the children (91.2%) were given soft/semi-solid/solid foods before six months of age, 40.3percent had low meal frequency, and 74percent had low dietary diversity. Early introduction of complementary food at age 0-1 month was statistically significantly associated with higher risks of wasting and underweight (ARR 2.9, 95%CI 1.3-6.3; and ARR 2.6, 95% CI 1.3-5.1 respectively). Children with low minimum meal frequency had higher risks of stunting, wasting, and underweight (ARR 2.9, 95%CI 2.3-3.6; ARR 1.9, 95%CI 1.5-2.5 and ARR 1.9, 95%CI 1.5-2.4 respectively). Children with low minimum dietary diversity were more likely to be stunted than is the case with their peers who received the minimum dietary diversity (ARR 1.3, 95% CI 1.01-1.6).There were a high proportion of children, which were fed inappropriately; Inappropriate complementary feeding practices predisposed children to undernutrition. Our study supports the introduction of complementary feeding, providing minimum dietary diversity, and minimum feeding frequency at six months of age as important in improving the nutritional status of the children."
https://openalex.org/W3161409907,"Abundant regulatory genes and complex circuits involving non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) monitor the formation and development of hepatic fibrosis (HF). Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of RNAs generated from protein coding genes by back-splicing, playing crucial roles in various pathological processes, including HF. However, little is known about mechanisms of action of circRNAs, let alone in HF. In this study, we found circUbe2k enhanced in CCl4-induced HF mice and LX-2 cells stimulated with TGF-β1, regulating the development of HF. Restraining the expression of circUbe2k inhibited α-SMA and Col1α1 expression in CCl4-induced HF mice and in LX-2 cells stimulated with TGF-β1. Furthermore, inhibiting circUbe2k expression reduced hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation and proliferation in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, we demonstrated a direct interaction between circUbe2k and miR-149-5p, which results in the modulation of TGF-β2 expressions. Together, circUbe2k may act as a “catalyst” of HSCs activation and HF through the circUbe2k/miR-149-5p/TGF-β2 axis. Our results provide unprecedented evidence for a significant role for circUbe2k to serve as a potential biomarker for HF therapy."

However, there is no definite understanding of the requirement of ERK5 in tumor growth and metastasis due to very limited characterization of the pathway in disease models. In this study, we report that a high level of ERK5 is a predictive marker of metastatic breast cancer. Mechanistically, our in vitro data revealed that ERK5 was critical for maintaining the invasive capability of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells through focal adhesion protein kinase (FAK) activation. Specifically, we found that phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr397 was controlled by a kinase-independent function of ERK5. Accordingly, silencing ERK5 in mammary tumor grafts impaired FAK phosphorylation at Tyr397 and suppressed TNBC cell metastasis to the lung without preventing tumor growth. Collectively, these results establish a functional relationship between ERK5 and FAK signaling in promoting malignancy. Thus, targeting the oncogenic ERK5-FAK axis represents a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer exhibiting aggressive clinical behavior."

Although cell surface GRP78 (sGRP78) has emerged as an attractive chemotherapeutic target, understanding how sGRP78 is functioning in cancer has been complicated by the fact that sGRP78 can function in a cell-context dependent manner, with a diverse array of reported binding partners, to regulate a variety of cellular responses. We had previously shown that sGRP78 was important in regulating pluripotent stem cell (PSC) functions, and hypothesized that embryonic-like mechanisms of GRP78 were critical to regulating aggressive breast cancer cell functions. Here, using proteomics we identify Dermcidin (DCD) as a novel sGRP78 binding partner common to both PSCs and breast cancer cells. We show that GRP78 and DCD cooperate to regulate stem cell and cancer cell migration that is dependent on the cell surface functions of these proteins. Finally, we identify Wnt/β-catenin signaling, a critical pathway in stem cell and cancer cell biology, as an important downstream intermediate in regulating this migration phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W3161968600,"Recent evidence of circulation of multiple strains within herds and mixed infections of cows marks the beginning of a rethink of our knowledge on Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) epidemiology. Strain typing opens new ways to investigate MAP transmission. This work presents a method for reconstructing infection chains in a setting of endemic Johne’s disease on a well-managed dairy farm. By linking genomic data with demographic field data, strain-specific differences in spreading patterns could be quantified for a densely sampled dairy herd. Mixed infections of dairy cows with MAP are common, and some strains spread more successfully. Infected cows remain susceptible for co-infections with other MAP genotypes. The model suggested that cows acquired infection from 1–4 other cows and spread infection to 0–17 individuals. Reconstructed infection chains supported the hypothesis that high shedding animals that started to shed at an early age and showed a progressive infection pattern represented a greater risk for spreading MAP. Transmission of more than one genotype between animals was recorded. In this farm with a good MAP control management program, adult-to-adult contact was proposed as the most important transmission route to explain the reconstructed networks. For each isolate, at least one more likely ancestor could be inferred. Our study results help to capture underlying transmission processes and to understand the challenges of tracing MAP spread within a herd. Only the combination of precise longitudinal field data and bacterial strain type information made it possible to trace infection in such detail."

As obesity is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, an improved understanding of risk factors across racial and ethnic groups may improve outcomes. Objective The objective of this study was to determine if susceptibility to obesity is associated with genetic variation in candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in African Americans and Hispanic/Latinos. Materials and methods We examined data from 534 African Americans and 557 Hispanic/Latinos participants from the UIC Cohort of Patients, Family and Friends. Participants were genotyped for the top 26 obesity-associated SNPs within FTO , MC4R , TUB , APOA2 , APOA5 , ADIPOQ , ARL15 , CDH13 , KNG1 , LEPR , leptin , and SCG3 genes.

After adjusting for age and sex, we found that rs8050136 in FTO (odds ratio [OR] 1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1–1.8; P = 0.01) among African Americans and rs2272383 in TUB (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.04–1.71; P = 0.02) among Hispanic/Latinos were associated with obesity. However, none of the SNPs in multivariable analysis of either AA or H/L cohorts were significant when adjusted for multiple correction. Conclusions We show that candidate SNPs in the FTO and TUB genes are associated with obesity in African Americans and Hispanic/Latinos individuals respectively. While the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms by which common genetic variants cause obesity remain unclear, we have identified novel therapeutic targets across racial and ethnic groups."
https://openalex.org/W3162777019,"Tendons are dense connective tissues that transmit muscle forces to the skeleton. After adult injury, healing potential is generally poor and dominated by scar formation. Although the immune response is a key feature of healing, the specific immune cells and signals that drive tendon healing have not been fully defined. In particular, the immune regulators underlying tendon regeneration are almost completely unknown due to a paucity of tendon regeneration models. Using a mouse model of neonatal tendon regeneration, we screened for immune-related markers and identified upregulation of several genes associated with inflammation, macrophage chemotaxis, and TGFβ signaling after injury. Depletion of macrophages using AP20187 treatment of MaFIA mice resulted in impaired functional healing, reduced cell proliferation, reduced ScxGFP+ neo-tendon formation, and altered tendon gene expression. Collectively, these results show that inflammation is a key component of neonatal tendon regeneration and demonstrate a requirement for macrophages in effective functional healing."
https://openalex.org/W3163879457,"Background A putative link between asthma and asthma severity with the occurrence of cancer has been suggested but has not been fully investigated. The objective of this study is to assess the incidence of all types of cancer in a cohort of asthmatic patients. Methods and findings A single center cohort retrospective study was conducted to investigate the role of asthma as a potential risk factor for various cancers. Participants were followed for a period of 9 years from 01/01/2010 to 30/12/2018 and cancer incidence and its determinants were collected in asthmatic patients and controls from the same population source but without any respiratory disease. Overall, 2,027 asthma patients and 1,637 controls were followed up for an average of 9 years. The statistical analysis showed that 2% of asthma patients were diagnosed with various cancers, resulting in an incidence rate of cancer of 383.02 per 100,000 persons per year which is significantly higher than the 139.01 per 100,000 persons per year observed in matched controls ( p -value &lt; 0.001). The top four cancers reported among asthmatics were breast, colon, lung and prostate cancer. Lung cancer in asthmatics had the longest diagnosis period with a mean of 36.6 years compared to the shortest with prostate cancer with 16.5 years. Conclusions This study shows that asthma patients are at increased risk of different types of cancers with asthma severity and goiter as the main factors that may increase the risk of developing cancers among asthmatic patients."
https://openalex.org/W3161654121,"Background Overexpression of IL-23 in adult mice by means of hydrodynamic tail vein injection of IL-23 minicircles has been reported to result in spondyloarthritis-like disease. The impact of genetic background and sex on the disease phenotype in this model has not been investigated. Methods We compared male B10.RIII mice with male C57BL/6 mice, and male with female B10.RIII mice after hydrodynamic injection of IL-23 enhanced episomal vector (EEV) at 8–12 weeks of age. We monitored clinical arthritis scores, paw swelling, and body weight. Animals were euthanized after two weeks and tissues were harvested for histology, flow cytometry and gene expression analysis. Serum cytokine levels were determined by ELISA. Findings Male B10.RIII mice developed arthritis in the forepaws and feet within 6 days after IL-23 EEV injection; they also exhibited psoriasis-like skin disease, colitis, weight loss, and osteopenia. In contrast to previous reports, we did not observe spondylitis or uveitis. Male C57BL/6 mice injected with IL-23 EEV had serum IL-23 levels comparable with B10.RIII mice and developed skin inflammation, colitis, weight loss, and osteopenia but failed to develop arthritis. Female B10.RIII mice had more severe arthritis than male B10.RIII mice but did not lose weight. Conclusions The phenotype of IL-23 induced disease in mice is controlled by genetic background and sex of the animals. The development of extra-articular manifestations but absence of arthritis in C57BL/6 mice suggests that organ-specificity of IL-23 driven inflammation is genetically determined. The mechanisms behind the strain-specific differences and the sexual dimorphism observed in this study may be relevant for human spondyloarthritis and warrant further exploration."
https://openalex.org/W3162251880,"The broadly distributed serpulid worm Hydroides elegans has become a model organism for studies of marine biofouling, development and the processes of larval settlement and metamorphosis induced by surface microbial films. Contrasting descriptions of the initial events of these recruitment processes, whether settlement is induced by (1) natural multi-species biofilms, (2) biofilms composed of single bacterial species known to induce settlement, or (3) a bacterial extract stimulated the research described here. We found that settlement induced by natural biofilms or biofilms formed by the bacterium Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea is invariably initiated by attachment and secretion of an adherent and larva-enveloping primary tube, followed by loss of motile cilia and ciliated cells and morphogenesis. The bacterial extract containing complex tailocin arrays derived from an assemblage of phage genes incorporated into the bacterial genome appears to induce settlement events by destruction of larval cilia and ciliated cells, followed by attachment and primary-tube formation. Similar destruction occurred when precompetent larvae of H . elegans or larvae of a nudibranch gastropod were exposed to the extract, although neither of them metamorphosed. We argue that larvae that lose their cilia before attachment would be swept away from the sites that stimulated settlement by the turbulent flow characteristic of most marine habitats."
https://openalex.org/W3160541559,"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a severe stroke subtype without effective pharmacological treatment. Following ICH, peripheral leukocytes infiltrate into the brain and contribute to neuroinflammation and brain edema. However, the intercellular machinery controlling the initiation and propagation of leukocyte infiltration remains elusive. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles released from donor cells and bridge intercellular communication. In this study, we investigated the effects of inhibition of exosome release on neuroinflammation and ICH injury. Using a mouse model of ICH induced by collagenase injection, we found that ICH induced an increase of exosome level in the brain. Inhibition of exosome release using GW4869 augmented neurological deficits and brain edema after ICH. The exacerbation of ICH injury was accompanied by increased barrier disruption and brain infiltration of leukocytes. The detrimental effects of GW4869 were ablated in ICH mice receiving antibody depletion of Gr-1+ myeloid cells. Extracted exosomes from the ICH brains suppressed the production of inflammatory factors by splenocytes. Additionally, exosomes extracted from brain tissues of donor ICH mice reduced ICH injury in recipient mice. These results demonstrate that inhibition of exosome release augments neuroinflammation and ICH injury. The impact of exosomes released from the ICH brain on the immune system deserves further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3163553871,"Background Workforce studies about traditional and complementary medicine (T&amp;CM) occupations in industrialized countries are scant; and, these occupations’ position within the broader occupational workforce remains unclear. This study aims to address these gaps using a comparative approach. Methods Naturopaths, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) / acupuncture practitioners, and homeopaths in Ontario, Canada were surveyed regarding their demographics, practice characteristics and self-reported income. Results were compared with parallel data from within and outside of Ontario. Results S tudy response rate: 23.3% (n = 1205). While predominantly female (57.9%), Ontario’s TCM/acupuncture profession was less feminized than the naturopathic (77.1%) and homeopathic (78.3%) groups. Naturopaths were significantly younger than, and reported fewer years of clinical experience than, the other two groups. About half of TCM/acupuncture practitioners, and almost one-third of homeopaths had trained outside of Canada, predominantly in East and South Asia, respectively. More TCM/acupuncture practitioners (58.9%) and homeopaths (57.6%) had multilingual clinical practices than naturopaths (19.1%). Homeopaths worked fewer hours and saw fewer patients per week than the other occupations. Self-reported mean incomes varied across groups, with naturopaths earning more on average ($63,834, SD $57,101) than did TCM/acupuncture practitioners ($45,624, SD $44,081) or homeopaths ($29,230, SD $41,645). Holding other variables constant, internationally-trained practitioners reported earning one-third less than their Canadian-trained counterparts. Discussion &amp; conclusions Study findings echo occupationally-specific data from other industrialized jurisdictions; and, affirm that different T&amp;CM occupations have distinctive demographic and practice characteristics. The demographic makeup of Ontario’s TCM/acupuncture and homeopathy occupations suggests a role for these groups in delivering culturally-responsive care within Asian ethnic communities. T&amp;CM practitioner incomes, in particular for internationally-trained practitioners, fell below the provincial population income median, and in many cases below the poverty line. T&amp;CM occupations’ relative socio-political marginality may be impacting clinicians’ ability to earn a viable living."
https://openalex.org/W3163912226,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex, progressive neuroinflammatory disease associated with autoimmunity. Currently, effective therapeutic strategy was poorly found in MS. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is widely used to study the pathogenesis of MS. Cumulative research have shown that bone marrow mesenchymal stem Cells (BMSCs) transplantation could treat EAE animal models, but the mechanism was divergent. Here, we systematically evaluated whether BMSCs can differentiate into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes to alleviate the symptoms of EAE mice. We used Immunofluorescence staining to detect MAP-2, GFAP, and MBP to evaluate whether BMSCs can differentiate into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The effect of BMSCs transplantation on inflammatory infiltration and demyelination in EAE mice were detected by Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&amp;E) and Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) staining, respectively. Inflammatory factors expression was detected by ELISA and RT-qPCR, respectively. Our results showed that BMSCs could be induced to differentiate into neuron cells, astrocytes and oligodendrocyte in vivo and in vitro , and BMSCs transplanted in EAE mice were easier to differentiate than normal mice. Moreover, transplanted BMSCs reduced neurological function scores and disease incidence of EAE mice. BMSCs transplantation alleviated the inflammation and demyelination of EAE mice. Finally, we found that BMSCs transplantation down-regulated the levels of pro-inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-1β and IFN-γ, and up-regulated the levels of anti-inflammatory factors IL-10 and TGF-β. In conclusion, this study found that BMSCs could alleviate the inflammatory response and demyelination in EAE mice, which may be achieved by the differentiation of BMSCs into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in EAE mice."
https://openalex.org/W3163452103,"Purpose Macrophage accumulation in response to decreasing myonuclei may be the major mechanism underlying immobilization-induced muscle fibrosis in muscle contracture, an intervention strategy suppressing these lesions is necessary. Therefore, this research investigated the effect of belt electrode-skeletal muscle electrical stimulation (B-SES), a new electrical stimulation device, to the macrophage accumulation via myonuclei decrease in immobilization-induced muscle fibrosis. Materials and methods 18 Wistar male rats were divided into the control group, immobilization group (with plaster cast fixation to immobilize the soleus muscles in a shortened position for 2 weeks), and B-SES group (with muscle contractile exercise through B-SES during the immobilization period). B-SES stimulation was performed at a frequency of 50 Hz and an intensity of 4.7 mA, muscle contractile exercise by B-SES was applied to the lower limb muscles for 20 minutes/session (twice a day) for 2 weeks (6 times/week). The bilateral soleus muscles were used for histological, immunohistochemical, biochemical, and molecular biological analyses. Results The number of myonuclei was significantly higher in the B-SES group than in the immobilization group, and there was no significant difference between the B-SES and control groups. The cross-sectional area of type I and II myofibers in the immobilization and B-SES groups was significantly lower than that in the control group, and the cross-sectional area of type I myofibers in the B-SES group was higher than that in the immobilization group. However, Atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 mRNA expression in the immobilization and B-SES groups was significantly higher than those in the control group. Additionally, the number of macrophages, IL-1β, TGF-β1, and α-SMA mRNA expression, and hydroxyproline expression was significantly lower in the control and B-SES groups than those in the immobilization group. Conclusion This research surmised that muscle contractile exercise through B-SES prevented immobilization-induced muscle fibrosis, and this alteration suppressed the development of muscle contracture."
https://openalex.org/W3163307812,"The acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family member A (ANP32A) is a cellular host factor that determines the host tropism of the viral polymerase (vPol) of avian influenza viruses (AIVs). Compared with human ANP32A (hANP32A), chicken ANP32A contains an additional 33 amino acid residues (176–208) duplicated from amino acid residues 149–175 (27 residues), suggesting that these residues could be involved in increasing vPol activity by strengthening interactions between ANP32A and vPol. However, the molecular interactions and functional roles of the 27 residues within hANP32A during AIV vPol activity remain unclear. Here, we examined the functional role of 27 residues of hANP32A based on comparisons with other human (h) ANP32 family members. It was notable that unlike hANP32A and hANP32B, hANP32C could not support vPol activity or replication of AIVs, despite the fact that hANP32C shares a higher sequence identity with hANP32A than hANP32B. Pairwise comparison between hANP32A and hANP32C revealed that Asp149 (D149) and Asp152 (D152) are involved in hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, respectively, which support vPol activity. Mutation of these residues reduced the interaction between hANP32A and vPol. Finally, we demonstrated that precise substitution of the identified residues within chicken ANP32A via homology-directed repair using the CRISPR/Cas9 system resulted in a marked reduction of viral replication in chicken cells. These results increase our understanding of ANP32A function and may facilitate the development of AIV-resistant chickens via precise modification of residues within ANP32A."
https://openalex.org/W3163567806,"Background Guinea has a high prevalence of female genital mutilation (FGM) (95%) and it is a major concern affecting the health and the welfare of women and girls. Population-based surveys suggest that health care providers are implicated in carrying out the practice (medicalization). To understand the attitudes of health care providers related to FGM and its medicalization as well as the potential role of the health sector in addressing this practice, a study was conducted in Guinea to inform the development of an intervention for the health sector to prevent and respond to this harmful practice. Methodology Formative research was conducted using a mixed-methods approach, including qualitative in-depth interviews with health care providers and other key informants as well as questionnaires with 150 health care providers. Data collection was carried out in the provinces of Faranah and Labé and in the capital, Conakry. Results The majority of health care providers participating in this study were opposed to FGM and its medicalization. Survey data showed that 94% believed that it was a serious problem; 89% felt that it violated the rights of girls and women and 81% supported criminalization. However, within the health sector, there is no enforcement or accountability to the national law banning the practice. Despite opposition to the practice, many (38%) felt that FGM limited promiscuity and 7% believed that it was a good practice. Conclusion Health care providers could have an important role in communicating with patients and passing on prevention messages that can contribute to the abandonment of the practice. Understanding their beliefs is a key step in developing these approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3163743081,"The aim of the present clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of kinesio taping on patients with chronic low back pain, when the exploration identifies skin/fascia mobilization as a factor that could modify the treatment effect. This study is a randomized controlled trial with intention-to-treat analysis. Sixty-two participants with chronic low back pain were therefore recruited from a tertiary referral hospital. Targeted kinesio taping, according to skin/fascia mobility exploration, was applied in the experimental group (17 female/13 male; 49.47 ± 11.15 years) once a week for four sessions. The control group (17 female/14 male; 48.87 ± 9.09 years) underwent a placebo taping application. At post-treatment time there was a statistically significant reduction both in disability (Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire) and pain (Numeric Pain Rating Scale) in the experimental group (disability: -2.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] -4.56 to -1.21, P < .001; pain: -1.58, 95% CI -2.67 to -0.54 P = .001) and the control group (disability: -1.82, 95% CI -3.46 to -0.17 P = .025; pain: -1.30, 95% CI -2.32 to -0.28 P = .008). However, at six months, these changes only remained significant in the experimental group (disability: -2.95, 95% CI -4.72 to -1.18, P < .001; pain: -1.06, 95% CI -2.07 to -0.04, P < .05). As a conclusion, the application of targeted kinesio taping produced a significant reduction in pain and disability, at 4 weeks and at 6 moths follow-up, although there were no differences between groups at any measurement time point."
https://openalex.org/W3160544920,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal genetic muscle disorder caused by recessive mutations in dystrophin gene, affecting 1/3000 males. Gene therapy has been proven to ameliorate dystrophic pathology. To investigate therapeutic benefits from long-term effect of human mini-dystrophin and functional outcomes, transgenic mdx mice (Tg-mdx) containing a single copy of human mini-dystrophin (∆hDys3849) gene, five rods (Rods1-2, Rods22-24), and two hinges (H1 and H4) driven by a truncated creatine-kinase promoter (dMCK) in a recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV) backbone, were generated and used to determine gene expression and improvement of muscle function. Human mini-dystrophin gene expression was found in a majority of the skeletal muscles, but no expression in cardiac muscle. Dystrophin-associated glycoproteins (DAGs) such as sarcoglycans and nNOS were restored at the sarcolemma and coincided with human mini-dystrophin gene expression at the ages of 6, 10, and 20 months; Morphology of dystrophic muscle expressing the human mini-dystrophin gene was improved and central nuclei were reduced. Myofiber membrane integrity was improved by Evans blue dye test. Improvement in treadmill running and grip force was observed in transgenic mice at 6 months. Tetanic force and specific force of tibialis anterior (TA) muscle were significantly increased at the ages of 6, 10, and 20 months. Pseudohypertrophy was not found in TA muscle at 10 and 20 months when compared with wild-type C57 (WT) group. This study demonstrated that the long-term effects of human mini-dystrophin effectively ameliorated pathology and improved the functions of the dystrophic muscles in the transgenic DMD mouse model."

The bias and mean squared error (MSE) of the proposed class of estimators are derived up to first order of approximation. Both empirical study and theoretical comparisons are discussed. Four populations are used to support the theoretical findings. It is observed that the proposed class of estimators perform better as compared to all other considered estimator in simple and stratified random sampling."
https://openalex.org/W3162740699,"Iodine thyroid blocking (ITB) is effective for preventing childhood thyroid cancer when radioactive iodine is released into the environment during a nuclear power plant accident. Japan employs the pre-distribution of stable iodine (PDSI) to residents living near nuclear power plants; however, the number of residents who have actually received stable iodine to date remains limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the profile of guardians of children living around the Genkai Nuclear Power Plant (GNPP) in Japan. We distributed self-administered questionnaires regarding perception of risks associated with administration of stable iodide to approximated 400 guardians of children aged 0–6 in 10 kindergartens located in four municipalities. We obtained responses from 286 guardians, and after excluding invalid responses, 247 were included in the analysis. Logistic regression analysis revealed that living within 5 km of the GNPP (odds ratio [OR] = 4.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.43–8.24), awareness of preferential implementation of ITB to children (OR = 3.33, 95%CI: 1.78–6.22), and awareness of the prophylaxis booklet published by the local government (OR = 2.53, 95%CI: 1.37–4.68) were independently associated with PDSI for children. The main reasons for not receiving PDSI were “anxiety about the side effects of stable iodine” (40.2%), “distrust of the effectiveness of SI” (23.5%), “complicated procedures for receiving stable iodine” (15.7%) and “missed the date for receiving stable iodine” (8.8%). In the case of ITB implementation during a nuclear emergency, it is necessary to clarify the risk perceptions of guardians and adapt risk communication accordingly."
https://openalex.org/W3163050042,"Purpose To propose a MR-thermometry method and associated data processing technique to predict the maximal RF-induced temperature increase near an implanted wire for any other MRI sequence. Methods A dynamic single shot echo planar imaging sequence was implemented that interleaves acquisition of several slices every second and an energy deposition module with adjustable parameters. Temperature images were processed in real time and compared to invasive fiber-optic measurements to assess accuracy of the method. The standard deviation of temperature was measured in gel and in vivo in the human brain of a volunteer. Temperature increases were measured for different RF exposure levels in a phantom containing an inserted wire and then a MR-conditional pacemaker lead. These calibration data set were fitted to a semi-empirical model allowing estimation of temperature increase of other acquisition sequences. Results The precision of the measurement obtained after filtering with a 1.6x1.6 mm 2 in plane resolution was 0.2°C in gel, as well as in the human brain. A high correspondence was observed with invasive temperature measurements during RF-induced heating (0.5°C RMSE for a 11.5°C temperature increase). Temperature rises of 32.4°C and 6.5°C were reached at the tip of a wire and of a pacemaker lead, respectively. After successful fitting of temperature curves of the calibration data set, temperature rise predicted by the model was in good agreement (around 5% difference) with measured temperature by a fiber optic probe, for three other MRI sequences. Conclusion This method proposes a rapid and reliable quantification of the temperature rise near an implanted wire. Calibration data set and resulting fitting coefficients can be used to estimate temperature increase for any MRI sequence as function of its power and duration."
https://openalex.org/W3163339138,"Background Brazil is witnessing a massive increase of corona virus disease (COVID-19). Its peculiar primary health care (PHC) system faces a burden due to the contagion occurring in the community environment. Then, the aim is to estimate the effect of the coverage of primary health care and social isolation on the evolution of confirmed cases and deaths by COVID-19, controlling sociodemographic, economic and health system aspects. Methods A time series design was designed with data on diagnosed cases of COVID-19 and their deaths as outcomes in the capital cities of the Northeast region of Brazil. Independent variables such as PHC coverage, hospital beds, social isolation, demographic density, Gini index and other indicators were analyzed. A Autoregressive Generalized Linear Model method was applied for model the relationship. Results We identified an exponential growth of cases ( y = 0 . 0025 0 . 71x ; p-value &lt;0,001). However, there is a high variability in the occurrence of outcomes. PHC coverage≥75% (χ2 = 9.27; p-value = 0.01) and social isolation rate (χ2 = 365.99; p-value &lt;0.001) proved to be mitigating factors for the spread of COVID-19 and its deaths. Capitals with hospital beds ≥ 3.2 per thousand inhabitants had fewer deaths (χ2 = 9.02; p-value = 0.003), but this was influenced by PHC coverage (χ2 = 30,87; p-value &lt;0.001). Conclusions PHC mitigates the occurrence of Covid-19 and its deaths in a region of social vulnerability in Brazil together with social isolation. However, it is not known until when the system will withstand the overload in view of the low adhesion to social isolation, the lack of support and appropriate direction from the government to its population."
https://openalex.org/W3163771125,"The present study aimed to investigate the incidence and patterns of nystagmus in adult patients with acute otitis media (AOM) or otitis media with effusion (OME) without dizziness or vertigo, and discuss possible mechanisms. From February 2018 to November 2018, 34 consecutive patients with AOM or OME without dizziness were included. Nystagmus was examined with video Frenzel glasses. Of 34 adult AOM or OME patients without dizziness, nystagmus was observed in 28 patients (82%). In unilateral AOM or OME ( n = 30), the most commonly observed nystagmus pattern was irritative-type direction-fixed nystagmus ( n = 13), followed by paretic-type direction-fixed nystagmus ( n = 8), and direction-changing positional nystagmus ( n = 4). In bilateral AOM or OME ( n = 4), direction-fixed nystagmus and direction-changing positional nystagmus were observed in two and one patients, respectively. Nystagmus was observed in as many as 82% of adult AOM or OME patients even though they did not complain of dizziness, and the pattern of nystagmus was either direction-fixed or direction-changing. Direct effect of inflammatory mediators penetrated from the middle ear and biochemical alteration in the inner ear fluids due to blood-perilymph barrier dysfunction may result in the presence of nystagmus in AOM or OME patients without dizziness."

https://openalex.org/W3163941859,"Viral infection and pathogenesis is mediated by host protein—viral protein complexes that are important targets for therapeutic intervention as they are potentially less prone to development of drug resistance. We have identified human, recombinant antibodies (Fabs) from a phage display library that bind to three HIV-host complexes. We used these Fabs to 1) stabilize the complexes for structural studies; and 2) facilitate characterization of the function of these complexes. Specifically, we generated recombinant Fabs to Vif-CBF-β-ELOB-ELOC (VCBC); ESCRT-I complex and AP2-complex. For each complex we measured binding affinities with K D values of Fabs ranging from 12–419 nM and performed negative stain electron microscopy (nsEM) to obtain low-resolution structures of the HIV-Fab complexes. Select Fabs were converted to scFvs to allow them to fold intracellularly and perturb HIV-host protein complex assembly without affecting other pathways. To identify these recombinant Fabs, we developed a rapid screening pipeline that uses quantitative ELISAs and nsEM to establish whether the Fabs have overlapping or independent epitopes. This pipeline approach is generally applicable to other particularly challenging antigens that are refractory to immunization strategies for antibody generation including multi-protein complexes providing specific, reproducible, and renewable antibody reagents for research and clinical applications. The curated antibodies described here are available to the scientific community for further structural and functional studies on these critical HIV host-factor proteins."
