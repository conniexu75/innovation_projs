https://openalex.org/W2922176925,"Oxygen sensing is central to metazoan biology and has implications for human disease. Mammalian cells express multiple oxygen-dependent enzymes called 2-oxoglutarate (OG)-dependent dioxygenases (2-OGDDs), but they vary in their oxygen affinities and hence their ability to sense oxygen. The 2-OGDD histone demethylases control histone methylation. Hypoxia increases histone methylation, but whether this reflects direct effects on histone demethylases or indirect effects caused by the hypoxic induction of the HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) transcription factor or the 2-OG antagonist 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) is unclear. Here, we report that hypoxia promotes histone methylation in a HIF- and 2-HG-independent manner. We found that the H3K27 histone demethylase KDM6A/UTX, but not its paralog KDM6B, is oxygen sensitive. KDM6A loss, like hypoxia, prevented H3K27 demethylation and blocked cellular differentiation. Restoring H3K27 methylation homeostasis in hypoxic cells reversed these effects. Thus, oxygen directly affects chromatin regulators to control cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W2922376589,"Oxygen sensing revisited The cellular response to hypoxia (oxygen deficiency) is a contributing factor in many human diseases. Previous studies examining the way in which hypoxia alters gene expression have focused on oxygen-sensing enzymes that regulate the activity of a transcription factor called hypoxia-inducible factor (see the Perspective by Gallipoli and Huntly). Chakraborty et al. and Batie et al. now show that hypoxia can also affect gene expression through direct effects on chromatin regulators. Certain histone demethylases, such as KDM6A and KDM5A, were found to be direct sensors of oxygen. In cell-culture models, hypoxia diminished the activity of these enzymes and caused changes in the expression of genes that govern cell fate.

https://openalex.org/W2949099357,"Intracellular pathogens and danger signals trigger the formation of inflammasomes, which activate inflammatory caspases and induce pyroptosis. The anthrax lethal factor metalloprotease and small-molecule DPP8/9 inhibitors both activate the NLRP1B inflammasome, but the molecular mechanism of NLRP1B activation is unknown. In this study, we used genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens to identify genes required for NLRP1B-mediated pyroptosis. We discovered that lethal factor induces cell death via the N-end rule proteasomal degradation pathway. Lethal factor directly cleaves NLRP1B, inducing the N-end rule–mediated degradation of the NLRP1B N terminus and freeing the NLRP1B C terminus to activate caspase-1. DPP8/9 inhibitors also induce proteasomal degradation of the NLRP1B N terminus but not via the N-end rule pathway. Thus, N-terminal degradation is the common activation mechanism of this innate immune sensor."

https://openalex.org/W2915050198,"Wavelike thermal transport in solids, referred to as second sound, has until now been an exotic phenomenon limited to a handful of materials at low temperatures. This has restricted interest in its occurrence and in its potential applications. Through time-resolved optical measurements of thermal transport on 5-20 {\mu}m length scales in graphite, we have made direct observations of second sound at temperatures above 100 K. The results are in qualitative agreement with ab initio calculations that predict wavelike phonon hydrodynamics on ~ 1-{\mu}m length scale up to almost room temperature. The results suggest an important role of second sound in microscale transient heat transport in two-dimensional and layered materials in a wide temperature range."

But which specific mechanisms are important in controlling the timing of glacial intervals? Macdonald et al. identify arc-continent collisions in the tropics as a primary control (see the Perspective by Hartmann). They compiled a database of Phanerozoic arc-continent collisions and the latitudinal distribution of ice sheets, showing that ice coverage was greatest when those collisions were most widespread, maximizing global weatherability.

There is increasing interest in extending these tools for human treatment. Magnus et al. designed chemogenetic ion channels that improve currently available systems and are activated by the clinically used antismoking drug varenicline. They engineered a ligand-binding domain less responsive to endogenous signals and identified agonists that function at nanomolar concentrations. The combination of drug and introduced channels transiently silenced neurons, with slow but effective washout, and induced behavioral changes in animal models after brain administration.

https://openalex.org/W2922279770,"Altitude is the major factor affecting both biodiversity and soil physiochemical properties of soil ecosystems. In order to understand the effect of altitude on soil physiochemical properties and bacterial diversity across the Himalayan cold desert, high altitude Gangotri soil ecosystem was studied and compared with the moderate altitude Kandakhal soil. Soil physiochemical analysis showed that altitude was positively correlated with soil pH, organic matter and total nitrogen content. However soil mineral nutrients and soil phosphorus were negatively correlated to the altitude. RT-PCR based analysis revealed the decreased bacterial and diazotrophic abundance at high altitude. Metagenomic study showed that Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria were dominant bacteria phyla at high altitude soil while Bacteroidetes and Fermicutes were found dominant at low altitude. High ratio of Gram-negative to Gram positive bacteria at Gangotri suggests the selective proliferation of Gram negative bacteria at high altitude with decrease in Gram positive bacteria. Moreover, Alphaproteobacteria was found more abundant at high altitude while the opposite was true for Betaproteobacteria. Abundance of Cytophaga, Flavobacterium and Bacteroides (CFB) were also found comparatively high at high altitude. Presence of many taxonomically unclassified sequences in Gangotri soil indicates the presence of novel bacterial diversity at high altitude. Further, isolation of bacteria through indigenously designed diffusion chamber revealed the existence of bacteria which has been documented in unculturable study of WIH (Western Indian Himalaya) but never been cultivated from WIH. Nevertheless, diverse functional free-living psychrotrophic diazotrophs were isolated only from the high altitude Gangotri soil. Molecular characterization revealed them as Arthrobacter humicola, Brevibacillus invocatus, Pseudomonas mandelii and Pseudomonas helmanticensis. Thus, this study documented the bacterial and psychrophilic diazotrophic diversity at high altitude and is an effort for exploration of low temperature bacteria in agricultural productivity with the target for sustainable hill agriculture."

Negative density dependence could be caused by competition for resources among neighbors or result from shared herbivores and pathogens. Using data from forest plots in Panama, Forrister et al. compared the contributions of these mechanisms. They found no effect of competition, but strong effects of plant chemistry and shared herbivores on coexisting Inga tree species. Science , this issue p. 1213"
https://openalex.org/W2921210647,"AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate excitatory neurotransmission and are central regulators of synaptic plasticity, a molecular mechanism underlying learning and memory. Although AMPARs act predominantly as heteromers, structural studies have focused on homomeric assemblies. Here, we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the heteromeric GluA1/2 receptor associated with two transmembrane AMPAR regulatory protein (TARP) γ8 auxiliary subunits, the principal AMPAR complex at hippocampal synapses. Within the receptor, the core subunits arrange to give the GluA2 subunit dominant control of gating. This structure reveals the geometry of the Q/R site that controls calcium flux, suggests association of TARP-stabilized lipids, and demonstrates that the extracellular loop of γ8 modulates gating by selectively interacting with the GluA2 ligand-binding domain. Collectively, this structure provides a blueprint for deciphering the signal transduction mechanisms of synaptic AMPARs."

https://openalex.org/W2921766156,"Salt stress is one of the major adverse environmental factors limiting crop productivity. Considering Iran as one of the bread wheat origins, we sequenced root transcriptome of an Iranian salt tolerant cultivar, Arg, under salt stress to extend our knowledge of the molecular basis of salinity tolerance in Triticum aestivum. RNA sequencing resulted in more than 113 million reads and about 104013 genes were obtained, among which 26171 novel transcripts were identified. A comparison of abundances showed that 5128 genes were differentially expressed due to salt stress. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were annotated with Gene Ontology terms, and the key pathways were identified using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes (KEGG) pathway mapping. The DEGs could be classified into 227 KEGG pathways among which transporters, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, transcription factors, glycosyltransferases, glutathione metabolism and plant hormone signal transduction represented the most significant pathways. Furthermore, the expression pattern of nine genes involved in salt stress response was compared between the salt tolerant (Arg) and susceptible (Moghan3) cultivars. A panel of novel genes and transcripts is found in this research to be differentially expressed under salinity in Arg cultivar and a model is proposed for salt stress response in this salt tolerant cultivar of wheat employing the DEGs. The achieved results can be beneficial for better understanding and improvement of salt tolerance in wheat."
https://openalex.org/W2922242907,"Defective degradation as disease mechanism Ubiquitination often targets proteins for destruction. Castel et al. describe a mechanism by which mutations in the small guanine triphosphatase RIT1 may act to cause certain developmental disorders and cancers. They detected a protein, LZTR1, that interacted with wild-type RIT1 but not with oncogenic mutant forms of RIT1. LZTR1 acts as a substrate-specific adaptor for a ubiquitin ligase. Altered forms of RIT1 that are not subject to ubiquitin-mediated degradation thus accumulate. Because RIT1 functions in growth factor signaling and excessive signaling, these findings may explain the malignancies associated with RIT1 mutations. Science , this issue p. 1226"
https://openalex.org/W2921425279,"There is widespread concern over the health risks and healthcare costs from potentially inappropriate high-cost imaging. As a result, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) will soon require high-cost imaging orders to be accompanied by Clinical Decision Support (CDS): software that provides appropriateness information at the time orders are placed via a best practice alert for targeted (i.e. likely inappropriate) imaging orders, although the impacts of CDS in this context are unclear. In this randomized trial of 3,511 healthcare providers at Aurora Health Care, we study the impacts of CDS on the ordering behavior of providers. We find that CDS reduced targeted imaging orders by a statistically significant 6%, however there was no statistically significant change in the total number of high-cost scans or of low-cost scans. The results suggest that the impending CMS mandate requiring healthcare systems to adopt CDS may modestly increase the appropriateness of high-cost imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2949476196,"Given the close relationship between protein structure and function, protein structure searches have long played an established role in bioinformatics. Despite their maturity, existing protein structure searches either use simplifying assumptions or compromise between fast response times and quality of results. These limitations can prevent the easy and efficient exploration of relationships between protein structures, which is the norm in other areas of inquiry. To address these limitations we have developed RUPEE, a fast and accurate purely geometric structure search combining techniques from information retrieval and big data with a novel approach to encoding sequences of torsion angles. Comparing our results to the output of mTM, SSM, and the CATHEDRAL structural scan, it is clear that RUPEE has set a new bar for purely geometric big data approaches to protein structure searches. RUPEE in top-aligned mode produces equal or better results than the best available protein structure searches, and RUPEE in fast mode demonstrates the fastest response times coupled with high quality results. The RUPEE protein structure search is available at https://ayoubresearch.com. Code and data are available at https://github.com/rayoub/rupee."

Although prophylactic HPV vaccines have been approved; it is still necessary a drug-based treatment against the infection and its oncogenic effects. The E6 oncoprotein is one of the most studied therapeutic targets of HPV, it has been identified as a key factor in cell immortalization and tumor progression in HPV-positive cells. E6 can promote the degradation of p53, a tumor suppressor protein, through the interaction with the cellular ubiquitin ligase E6AP. Therefore, preventing the formation of the E6-E6AP complex is one of the main strategies to inhibit the viability and proliferation of infected cells. Herein, we propose an in silico pipeline to identify small-molecule inhibitors of the E6-E6AP interaction. Virtual screening was carried out by predicting the ADME properties of the molecules and performing ensemble-based docking simulations to E6 protein followed by binding free energy estimation through MM/PB(GB)SA methods. Finally, the top-three compounds were selected, and their stability in the E6 docked complex and their effect in the inhibition of the E6-E6AP interaction was corroborated by molecular dynamics simulation. Therefore, this pipeline and the identified molecules represent a new starting point in the development of anti-HPV drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2921583063,"Advanced and undifferentiated skin squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) exhibit aggressive growth and enhanced metastasis capability, which is associated in mice with an expansion of the cancer stem-like cell (CSC) population and with changes in the regulatory mechanisms that control the proliferation and invasion of these cells. Indeed, autocrine activation of PDGFRα induces CSC invasion and promotes distant metastasis in advanced SCCs. However, the mechanisms involved in this process were unclear. Here, we show that CSCs of mouse advanced SCCs (L-CSCs) express CXCR4 and CXCR7, both receptors of SDF-1. PDGFRα signaling induces SDF-1 expression and secretion, and the autocrine activation of this pathway in L-CSCs. Autocrine SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling induces L-CSC proliferation and survival, and mediates PDGFRα-induced invasion, promoting in vivo lung metastasis. Validation of these findings in patient samples of skin SCCs shows a strong correlation between the expression of SDF1, PDGFRA, and PDGFRB, which is upregulated, along CXCR4 in tumor cells of advanced SCCs. Furthermore, PDGFR regulates SDF-1 expression and inhibition of SDF-1/CXCR4 and PDGFR pathways blocks distant metastasis of human PD/S-SCCs. Our results indicate that functional crosstalk between PDGFR/SDF-1 signaling regulates tumor cell invasion and metastasis in human and mouse advanced SCCs, and suggest that CXCR4 and/or PDGFR inhibitors could be used to block metastasis of these aggressive tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2921147936,"Tunicates (Ascidians, sea squirts) are marine protochordates, which live sedentary or sessile in colonial or solitary forms. These invertebrates have to protect themselves against predators and invaders. A most successful strategy, to not being eaten by predators and prevent pathogenic microorganisms to settle, is the usage of chemical molecules for defence. To accomplish this, tunicates take advantage of the specialized metabolites produced by the bacteria associated with them. Therefore, the microbiome of the tunicates can be regarded as a promising bioresource for bacterial strains producing compounds with antibacterial activity. The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis by (i) isolation of tunicate-associated bacteria, (ii) analysis of the antibacterial activities of these strains, and (iii) purification and structure elucidation of an active compound derived from this bioresource. In total, 435 bacterial strains were isolated and thereof 71 (16%) showed antibacterial activity against multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria. Therefrom, the ethyl acetate crude extracts from liquid fermentations of 25 strains showed activity against MDR Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (MDR-ESBL) Escherichia coli, MDR Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, and Bacillus megaterium. Phenotypic analysis based on 16S rDNA sequencing revealed the active strains belonging to different genera and phyla, like Bacillus, Pantoea, Pseudoalteromonas, Salinicola, Streptomyces, Vibrio and Virgibacillus. To obtain first insights into the molecules responsible for the antibacterial activities observed, strain Pseudoalteromonas rubra TKJD 22 was selected for large-scale fermentation and the active compound was isolated. This allowed the purification and structure elucidation of isatin, a compound known for its strong biological effects, thereunder inhibition of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2921373742,"We report the reproductive strategy of the nematode Mesorhabditis belari This species produces only 9% males, whose sperm is necessary to fertilize and activate the eggs. However, most of the fertilized eggs develop without using the sperm DNA and produce female individuals. Only in 9% of eggs is the male DNA utilized, producing sons. We found that mixing of parental genomes only gives rise to males because the Y-bearing sperm of males are much more competent than the X-bearing sperm for penetrating the eggs. In this previously unrecognized strategy, asexual females produce few sexual males whose genes never reenter the female pool. Here, production of males is of interest only if sons are more likely to mate with their sisters. Using game theory, we show that in this context, the production of 9% males by M. belari females is an evolutionary stable strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2922339697,"Minor prenylated hop compounds have been attracting increasing attention due to their promising anticarcinogenic properties. Even after intensive purification from natural raw extracts, allocating certain activities to single compounds or complex interactions of the main compound with remaining impurities in very low concentration is difficult. In this study, dose-dependent antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects of the promising xanthohumol (XN) analogue xanthohumol C (XNC) were evaluated and compared to XN and a XN-enriched hop extract (XF). It was demonstrated that the cell growth inhibition of human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) significantly increases after being treated with XNC compared to XN and XF. Based on label-free data-dependent acquisition proteomics, physiological influences on the proteome of MCF-7 cells were analyzed. Different modes of action between XNC and XN treated MCF-7 cells could be postulated. XNC causes ER stress and seems to be involved in cell-cell adhesion, whereas XN influences cell cycles and DNA replication as well as type I interferon signaling pathway. The results demonstrate the utility of using quantitative proteomics for bioactivity screenings of minor hop compounds and underscore the importance of isolating highly pure compounds into their distinct forms to analyze their different and possibly synergistic activities and modes of action."
https://openalex.org/W2920885890,"Behavioural changes after stroke might be explained by social cognition impairments. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether performances on social cognition tests (including emotion recognition, Theory of Mind (ToM), empathy and behaviour regulation) were associated with behavioural deficits (as measured by proxy ratings) in a group of patients with relatively mild stroke.Prospective cohort study in which 119 patients underwent neuropsychological assessment with tests for social cognition (emotion recognition, ToM, empathy, and behaviour regulation) 3-4 years post stroke. Test scores were compared with scores of 50 healthy controls. Behavioural problems were assessed with the Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX) self rating and proxy rating scales. Pearson correlations were used to determine the relationship between the social cognition measures and DEX scores.Patients performed significantly worse on emotion recognition, ToM and behaviour regulation tests than controls. Mean DEX-self score did not differ significantly from the mean DEX-proxy score. DEX-proxy ratings correlated with tests for emotion recognition, empathy, and behavioural regulation (lower scores on these items were associated with more problems on the DEX-proxy scale).Social cognition impairments are present in the long term after stroke, even in a group of mildly affected stroke patients. Most of these impairments also turned out to be associated with a broad range of behavioural problems as rated by proxies of the patients. This strengthens the proposal that social cognition impairments are part of the underlying mechanism of behavioural change. Since tests for social cognition can be administered in an early stage, this would allow for timely identification of patients at risk for behavioural problems in the long term."
https://openalex.org/W2922231134,"Introduction Health-seeking behaviours are influenced by internal and external contributing factors. Internal factors include attitudes, beliefs and core values, life adaptation skills, psychological disposition whereas external factors include social support, media, socio-cultural, political, economic and biological aspects, health care systems, environmental stressors and societal laws and regulations. This study was meant to explore factors affecting health-seeking behaviors in the Somali regional state of Ethiopia. The study employed a cross-sectional study design using qualitative data collection tools. Data were collected from 50 individual interviews and 17 focused group discussions (FGD) on women of reproductive age and their partners, health extension workers (HEWs), health care providers and health administrators. To ensure representativeness, the region was categorized into three zones based on their settlement characteristics as agrarian, pastoralist and semi-pastoralist. Two districts (one from high and the other from low performance areas) were selected from each category. The data were entered, coded, categorized and analyzed using NVIVO version 11 software. The Socio-ecologic Model (SEM) was used for categorization. Results Using the social ecological model, the following major barriers for health seeking behaviors were identified. Low socio-demographic and economic status, poor exposure to health information or mass media, detrimental preferences of breast feeding methods and short acting family planning (FP) methods were identified barriers at the individual level; male dominance in decision making, the influence of the husband and society and the role of word of mouth were identified barriers at the interpersonal level and lack of acceptance, fear of modern health practices, unclean health facility environment, lack of well-equipped facilities shortage of trained staffs and barriers relating to distance and transportation were barriers identified at organizational and policy level. Conclusion Overall, factors at various level affected health seeking behaviors of the Somali community. Socio-demographic and economic factors, non-responsive bureaucratic system, shortages or absence of medical supplies and human resources, lack of supportive supervision, a shortage of water and electricity at the health facility and an unclean service delivery environment are significant barriers to health-seeking behaviors for the community."
https://openalex.org/W2951747685,"The role of microbial interactions in defining the properties of microbiota is a topic of key interest in microbial ecology. Microbiota contain hundreds to thousands of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), most of them rare. This feature of community structure can lead to methodological difficulties: simulations have shown that methods for detecting pairwise associations between OTUs, which presumably reflect interactions, yield problematic results. The performance of association detection tools is impaired when there is a high proportion of zeros in OTU tables. Our goal was to understand the impact of OTU rarity on the detection of associations. We explored the utility of common statistics for testing associations; the sensitivity of alternative association measures; and the performance of network inference tools. We found that a large proportion of pairwise associations, especially negative associations, cannot be reliably tested. This constraint could hamper the identification of candidate biological agents that could be used to control rare pathogens. Identifying testable associations could serve as an objective method for filtering datasets in lieu of current empirical approaches. This trimming strategy could significantly reduce the computational time needed to infer networks and network inference quality. Different possibilities for improving the analysis of associations within microbiota are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2921330573,"Background Maternal and child health is one of the most important issues in a developing country like Bangladesh. This study evaluates the trends in maternal and child health indicators of Bangladesh. Methods The secondary data used in this study was extracted from the World Bank Dataset. The selected indicators were maternal mortality ratio (MMR), under-five children mortality and neonatal mortality rate, and prevalence of stunting and wasting of under-five children. Trend analysis technique and ARIMA forecasting models were used in this study to find currents trend and predict the future of selected indicators. Results This study revealed clear evidence that neonatal, under-five child and maternal mortality in Bangladesh had been gradually decreasing during the last two and half decades. The decreasing rate of these indicators suggests that it should be possible to achieve the national target of sustainable development goals (SDGs) of Bangladesh by 2021. While, it was observed that the prevalence of underweight, stunting and wasting among under-five children was still high, these indicators have been slowly decreasing over time. The decreasing rate of these indicators displayed that without guided measures, the Bangladesh government would not be able to achieve the target goal of child malnutrition by 2021 under SDG-2.2. Conclusion It is recommended that the government, as well as non-government health organizations (NGOs), and other policy makers should provide programs that are effective so that the national target goals can be achieved by the year 2030. Consequently, our findings should assist in the achievement of the national goals in Bangladesh regarding these health issues."
https://openalex.org/W2921758355,"We tested the interactions with four different G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) of arrestin-3 mutants with substitutions in the four loops, three of which contact the receptor in the structure of the arrestin-1-rhodopsin complex. Point mutations in the loop at the distal tip of the N-domain (Glu157Ala), in the C-loop (Phe255Ala), back loop (Lys313Ala), and one of the mutations in the finger loop (Gly65Pro) had mild variable effects on receptor binding. In contrast, the deletion of Gly65 at the beginning of the finger loop reduced the binding to all GPCRs tested, with the binding to dopamine D2 receptor being affected most dramatically. Thus, the presence of a glycine at the beginning of the finger loop appears to be critical for the arrestin-receptor interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2922324956,"Reliable hunting bag statistics are a prerequisite for sustainable harvest management based on quantitative modeling. Estimating the total hunting bag for a given game species is faced with a multiplicity of error sources. Of particular concern is the nonresponse error. We consider that the major cause of nonresponse bias is when the reluctance to respond is related to a null harvest, which leads to a potentially important overestimation. For tackling the nonresponse bias issue, we advocate the repeated subsampling of nonrespondents, with a final phase of personal interview by phone, intended to be without nonresponse. When a 100% response rate is actually reached at the last phase, both total and sampling variance can be estimated without bias, whatever the response rates at the previous phases. The actual case of imperfect response at the last phase is studied using Monte Carlo simulations. For imperfect response at the last phase, we show that the estimators we advocate are biased downwards but that these bias remain very moderate if the response rate at the last phase is high enough, depending on the circumstances. Furthermore, we illustrate that increasing the number of phases improves the nonresponse bias attenuation. In case of a hunting bag collecting scheme prone to a high nonresponse rate, for obtaining a very satisfying nonresponse bias attenuation we advocate relying on the multiphase sampling strategy with two- or three-phases, and a response rate in the last phase of at least 90%."
https://openalex.org/W2922434422,"NAD+ is mainly synthesized from nicotinamide (Nam) by the rate-limiting enzyme Nam phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) and degraded to Nam by NAD+-degrading enzymes in mammals. Numerous studies report that tissue NAD+ levels decrease during aging and age-related diseases and suggest that NAD+ replenishment promotes healthy aging. Although increased expression of Nampt might be a promising intervention for healthy aging, forced expression of Nampt gene, inducing more than 10-fold increases in the enzyme protein level, has been reported to elevate NAD+ levels only 40–60% in mammalian cells. Mechanisms underlying the limited increases in NAD+ levels remain to be determined. Here we show that Nampt is inhibited in cells and that enhanced expression of Nampt activates NAD+ breakdown. Combined with the measurement of each cell’s volume, we determined absolute values (μM/h) of the rates of NAD+ synthesis (RS) and breakdown (RB) using a flux assay with a 2H (D)-labeled Nam, together with the absolute NAD+ concentrations in various mammalian cells including primary cultured cardiomyocytes under the physiological conditions and investigated the relations among total cellular Nampt activity, RS, RB, and the NAD+ concentration. NAD+ concentration was maintained within a narrow range (400–700 μM) in the cells. RS was much smaller than the total Nampt activity, indicating that NAD+ synthesis from Nam in the cells is suppressed. Forced expression of Nampt leading to 6-fold increase in total Nampt activity induced only a 1.6-fold increase in cellular NAD+ concentration. Under the conditions, RS increased by 2-fold, while 2-fold increase in RB was also observed. The small increase in cellular NAD+ concentration is likely due to both inhibited increase in the NAD+ synthesis and the activation of its breakdown. Our findings suggest that cellular NAD+ concentrations do not vary dramatically by the physiological fluctuation of Nampt expression and show the tight link between the NAD+ synthesis and its breakdown."
https://openalex.org/W2789962474,"By controlling robots comparable to the human body, people with profound motor deficits could potentially perform a variety of physical tasks for themselves, improving their quality of life. The extent to which this is achievable has been unclear due to the lack of suitable interfaces by which to control robotic body surrogates and a dearth of studies involving substantial numbers of people with profound motor deficits. We developed a novel, web-based augmented reality interface that enables people with profound motor deficits to remotely control a PR2 mobile manipulator from Willow Garage, which is a human-scale, wheeled robot with two arms. We then conducted two studies to investigate the use of robotic body surrogates. In the first study, 15 novice users with profound motor deficits from across the United States controlled a PR2 in Atlanta, GA to perform a modified Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) and a simulated self-care task. Participants achieved clinically meaningful improvements on the ARAT and 12 of 15 participants (80%) successfully completed the simulated self-care task. Participants agreed that the robotic system was easy to use, was useful, and would provide a meaningful improvement in their lives. In the second study, one expert user with profound motor deficits had free use of a PR2 in his home for seven days. He performed a variety of self-care and household tasks, and also used the robot in novel ways. Taking both studies together, our results suggest that people with profound motor deficits can improve their quality of life using robotic body surrogates, and that they can gain benefit with only low-level robot autonomy and without invasive interfaces. However, methods to reduce the rate of errors and increase operational speed merit further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2921695767,"Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by varying degrees of intellectual disability, severely delayed language development and specific facial features, and is caused by a deletion within chromosome 22q13.3. SHANK3, which is located at the terminal end of this region, has been repeatedly implicated in other neurodevelopmental disorders and deletion of this gene specifically is thought to cause much of the neurologic symptoms characteristic of PMS. However, it is still unclear to what extent SHANK3 deletions contribute to the PMS phenotype, and what other genes nearby are causal to the neurologic disease. In an effort to better understand the functional landscape of the PMS region during normal neurodevelopment, we assessed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) expression data collected from post-mortem brain tissue from developmentally normal subjects over the course of prenatal to adolescent age and analyzed expression changes of 65 genes on 22q13. We found that the majority of genes within this region were expressed in the brain, with ATNX10, MLC1, MAPK8IP2, and SULT4A1 having the highest overall expression. Analysis of the temporal profiles of the highest expressed genes revealed a trend towards peak expression during the early post-natal period, followed by a drop in expression later in development. Spatial analysis revealed significant region specific differences in the expression of SHANK3, MAPK8IP2, and SULT4A1. Region specific expression over time revealed a consistently unique gene expression profile within the cerebellum, providing evidence for a distinct developmental program within this region. Exon-specific expression of SHANK3 showed higher expression within exons contributing to known brain specific functional isoforms. Overall, we provide an updated roadmap of the PMS region, implicating several genes and time periods as important during neurodevelopment, with the hope that this information can help us better understand the phenotypic heterogeneity of PMS."
https://openalex.org/W2922172185,"Fosas (Cryptoprocta ferox) are Madagascar's largest carnivores, occupying much of the island's forested landscape. This study provides the first evaluation of fosas' conflict with humans, a problem for many small and medium sized carnivores worldwide. We examined fosas' predation of poultry, and the subsequent retaliatory killing. Over 1750 households were interviewed across four regions, encompassing Madagascar's major forest types (deciduous/rainforest) and protected area classifications (national park, reserve and unprotected forest). Predation by fosa was the third highest reported cause (15%) of poultry mortality, with little evidence that coops were effective in reducing predation. Predation of poultry was more prevalent in deciduous forests, and most common during the evenings of the dry season. Over half of all interviewees said they disliked fosas, with loss of poultry the most commonly stated reason. Respondents' that had suffered poultry depredation and those with lower educational attainment were more likely to dislike fosas. Interviewees that disliked fosas and those that were wealthier were most likely to report having killed a fosa. A minimum of thirty fosas was killed in retaliation by our respondents during the year before the interviews. Given that the fosa population is in decline, and most of Madagascar's forests are likely to be too small to support sustainable populations, these killings may be detrimental to vulnerable sub-populations. These results shed insight into the cultural perceptions and predation patterns of a medium sized carnivore, with relevance to worldwide human-wildlife conflict of often overlooked smaller carnivores. We suggest that educational programs, guard dogs, poultry disease vaccinations and robust coop construction may be effective for improving attitudes and reducing retaliatory killing."
https://openalex.org/W2922233429,"Despite big experimental data on the phenomena and mechanisms of the generation of ictal and interictal discharges (IDs and IIDs), mathematical models that can describe the synaptic interactions of neurons and the ionic dynamics in biophysical detail are not well-established. Based on experimental recordings of combined hippocampal-entorhinal cortex slices from rats in a high-potassium and a low-magnesium solution containing 4-aminopyridine as well as previous observations of similar experimental models, this type of mathematical model has been developed. The model describes neuronal excitation through the application of the conductance-based refractory density approach for three neuronal populations: two populations of glutamatergic neurons with hyperpolarizing and depolarizing GABAergic synapses and one GABAergic population. The ionic dynamics account for the contributions of voltage-gated and synaptic channels, active and passive transporters, and diffusion. The relatively slow dynamics of potassium, chloride, and sodium ion concentrations determine the transitions from pure GABAergic IIDs to IDs and GABA-glutamatergic IIDs. The model reproduces different types of IIDs, including those initiated by interneurons; repetitive IDs; tonic and bursting modes of an ID composed of clustered IID-like events. The simulations revealed contributions from different ionic channels to the ion concentration dynamics before and during ID generation. The proposed model is a step forward to an optimal mathematical description of the mechanisms of epileptic discharges."
https://openalex.org/W2950141475,"Purpose Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most lethal and aggressive subtype of breast cancer. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a major energy regulator that suppresses tumor growth, and 1-(3-chloro-4-((trifluoromethyl)thio)phenyl)-3-(4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl)urea (FND-4b) is a novel AMPK activator that inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in colon cancer. The purpose of this project was to test the effects of FND-4b on AMPK activation, proliferation, and apoptosis in breast cancer with a particular emphasis on TNBC. Materials and methods (i) Estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer (ER+BC; MCF-7, and T-47D), TNBC (MDA-MB-231 and HCC-1806), and breast cancer stem cells were treated with FND-4b for 24h. Immunoblot analysis assessed AMPK, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), ribosomal protein S6, cyclin D1, and cleaved PARP. (ii) Sulforhodamine B growth assays were performed after treating ER+BC and TNBC cells with FND-4b for 72h. Proliferation was also assessed by counting cells after 72h of FND-4b treatment. (iii) Cell death ELISA assays were performed after treating ER+BC and TNBC cells with FND-4b for 72h. Results (i) FND-4b increased AMPK activation with concomitant decreases in ACC activity, phosphorylated S6, and cyclin D1 in all subtypes. (ii) FND-4b decreased proliferation in all cells, while dose-dependent growth decreases were found in ER+BC and TNBC. (iii) Increases in apoptosis were observed in ER+BC and the MDA-MB-231 cell line with FND-4b treatment. Conclusions Our findings indicate that FND-4b decreases proliferation for a variety of breast cancers by activating AMPK and has notable effects on TNBC. The growth reductions were mediated through decreases in fatty acid synthesis (ACC), mTOR signaling (S6), and cell cycle flux (cyclin D1). ER+BC cells were more susceptible to FND-4b-induced apoptosis, but MDA-MB-231 cells still underwent apoptosis with higher dose treatment. Further development of FND compounds could result in a novel therapeutic for TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W2921064552,"Background Calcimimetics have been shown to be effective and safe therapies for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT), a serious complication of disordered mineral metabolism associated with dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease. Etelcalcetide, a recently approved intravenous calcimimetic, reduces serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, phosphorus, and fibroblast growth factor-23 concentrations. Here we report the first integrated safety profile of etelcalcetide using pooled data from five pivotal clinical trials. Methods This analysis included data from patients receiving hemodialysis with moderate to severe sHPT enrolled in two randomized, placebo-controlled trials; a randomized active-controlled (with cinacalcet) trial; and two single-arm, open-label extension trials. Patients initially received etelcalcetide intravenously 5 mg three times weekly (TIW) after hemodialysis; with potential dose increases of 2.5 or 5 mg at 4-week intervals to a maximum dose of 15 mg TIW, depending on serum PTH and calcium levels. The nature, frequency, and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and changes in laboratory parameters were assessed. Results Overall, we evaluated 1023 patients from the placebo-controlled trials, 683 from the active-controlled trial, and 1299 from open-label extensions. The frequency and nature of common treatment-emergent AEs reported for the etelcalcetide arm were consistent among the placebo-controlled and active-controlled trials. The most common AEs were those related to mineral metabolism (decreased blood calcium, hypophosphatemia, muscle spasms) or gastrointestinal abnormalities (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting). Hypocalcemia leading to discontinuation of either calcimimetic was experienced in ≤ 1% of patients. Conclusions This integrated safety assessment of etelcalcetide across placebo- and active-controlled trials showed an overall favorable risk/benefit profile, with safety similar to that of cinacalcet. Consistent with its mechanism of action, the most important risks associated with etelcalcetide were serum calcium reductions and hypocalcemia-related AEs; no new safety findings were identified in the pooled long-term extension trials."
https://openalex.org/W2922291523,"Eye tracking systems have recently experienced a diversity of novel calibration procedures, including smooth pursuit and vestibulo-ocular reflex based calibrations. These approaches allowed collecting more data compared to the standard 9-point calibration. However, the computation of the mapping function which provides planar gaze positions from pupil features given as input is mostly based on polynomial regressions, and little work has investigated alternative approaches. This paper fills this gap by providing a new calibration computation method based on symbolic regression. Instead of making prior assumptions on the polynomial transfer function between input and output records, symbolic regression seeks an optimal model among different types of functions and their combinations. This approach offers an interesting perspective in terms of flexibility and accuracy. Therefore, we designed two experiments in which we collected ground truth data to compare vestibulo-ocular and smooth pursuit calibrations based on symbolic regression, both using a marker or a finger as a target, resulting in four different calibrations. As a result, we improved calibration accuracy by more than 30%, with reasonable extra computation time."
https://openalex.org/W2949417722,"The spatial distribution of a species assemblage is often determined by habitat and climate. In the marine environment, depth can become an important factor as declining light and water temperature leads to changes in the biological habitat structure. To date, much of the focus of ecological fish research has been based on reefs in less than 40 m with little research on the ecological role of mesophotic reefs. We deployed baited remote underwater stereo video systems (stereo-BRUVS) on temperate reefs in two depth categories: shallow (20–40 m) and mesophotic (80–120 m), off Port Stephens, Australia. Sites were selected using data collected by swath acoustic sounder to ensure stereo-BRUVS were deployed on reef. The sounder also provided rugosity, slope and relief data for each stereo-BRUVS deployment. Multivariate analysis indicates that there are significant differences in the fish assemblages between shallow and mesophotic reefs, primarily driven by Ophthalmolepis lineolatus and Notolabrus gymnogenis only occurring on shallow reefs and schooling species of fish that were unique to each depth category: Atypichthys strigatus on shallow reefs and Centroberyx affinis on mesophotic reefs. While shallow reefs had a greater species richness and abundance of fish when compared to mesophotic reefs, mesophotic reefs hosted the same species richness of fishery-targeted species. Chrysophrys auratus and Nemodactylus douglassii are two highly targeted species in this region. While C. auratus was numerically more abundant on shallow reefs, mesophotic reefs provide habitat for larger fish. In comparison, N. douglassii were evenly distributed across all sites sampled. Generalized linear models revealed that depth and habitat type provided the most parsimonious model for predicting the distribution of C. auratus, while habitat type alone best predicted the distribution of N. douglassii. These results demonstrate the importance of mesophotic reefs to fishery-targeted species and therefore have implications for informing the management of these fishery resources on shelf rocky reefs."
https://openalex.org/W2921921352,"Purpose To identify important variables associated with visual field (VF) defects in open-angle glaucoma (OAG) with myopia. Materials and methods A total of 105 OAG with myopia were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. The disc tilt ratio, disc torsion degree, disc-foveal angle, and area of peripapillary atrophy (PPA) were measured from red-free fundus photographs. Patients underwent Swept-source optical coherence tomography to measure peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), subfoveal choroidal, and sufoveal scleral thicknesses. Functional evaluation was performed using 24–2 standard automated perimetry. For statistical analyses, logistic regression, artificial neural networks (ANN), and hierarchical cluster analysis were performed. Results Logistic regression demonstrated peripapillary RNFL thickness as a significant variable for the presence of VF defects, otherwise ANN identified PPA area, peripapillary RNFL thickness, disc-foveal angle, and disc torsion degree as significant clinical variables in OAG with myopia. Two clusters were made after a hierarchical cluster analysis. Cluster 2 showed significantly worse VF damage than cluster 1 (MD = -5.20±5.25 dB for cluster 2 and -1.84±3.02 dB for cluster 1, P < .001). Cluster 2 had significantly greater disc tilt ratio, disc-foveal angle, and PPA area compared with cluster 1 (P < .001, 0.005, and < .001, respectively). Conclusions Generally peripapillary RNFL thickness is considered as an important variable associated with visual field defects in glaucoma patients. ANN identified parameters associated with posterior scleral deformations around optic disc induced by myopic change including PPA area, disc torsion degree, and disc-foveal angle as significant clinical variables for visual field damage in OAG with myopia."
https://openalex.org/W2922099984,"Embodied Cognition Theories (ECT) postulate that higher-order cognition is heavily influenced by sensorimotor signals. We explored the active role of somatosensory afferents and motor efferents in modulating the perception of actions in people who have suffered a massive body-brain disconnection because of spinal cord injury (SCI), which leads to sensory-motor loss below the lesion. We assessed whether the habitual use of a wheelchair enhances the capacity to anticipate the endings of tool-related actions, with respect to actions that have become impossible. In a Temporal Occlusion task, three groups of participants (paraplegics, rollerbladers and physiotherapists) observed two sets of videos depicting an actor who attempted to climb onto a platform using a wheelchair or rollerblades. Three different outcomes were possible, namely: a) success (the actor went up the step); b) fail (the actor stopped before the step without going up) and c) fall (the actor fell without going up). Each video set comprised 5 different durations increasing in complexity: in the shortest (600ms) only preparatory body movements were shown and in the longest (3000ms) the complete action was shown. The participants were requested to anticipate the outcome (success, fail, fall). The main result showed that the SCI group performed better with the wheelchair videos and poorer with rollerblade videos than both groups, even if the physiotherapists group never used rollerblades. In line with the ECT, this suggests that the action anticipation skills are not only influenced by motor expertise, but also by motor connection."
https://openalex.org/W2921804929,"Plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (plasma LDL-C), vascular endothelial cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), particularly monocytes, play key roles in initiating atherosclerosis, the primary cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although the mechanisms underlying development of atherosclerosis are not well understood, LDL-C is known to influence expression of endothelial microRNAs (miRNAs) and gene-targets of miRNAs to promote cell senescence. However, the impact of LDL-C on expression of PBMC miRNAs and miRNA targeted genes in response to an atherogenic diet is not known. In this study, we used unbiased methods to identify coordinately responsive PBMC miRNA- gene networks that differ between low and high LDL-C baboons when fed a high-cholesterol, high-fat (HCHF) diet.Using RNA Seq, we quantified PBMC mRNAs and miRNAs from half-sib baboons discordant for LDL-C plasma concentrations (low LDL-C, n = 3; high LDL-C, n = 3) before and after a 7-week HCHF diet challenge. For low LDL-C baboons, 626 genes exhibited significant change in expression (255 down-regulated, 371 up-regulated) in response to the HCHF diet, and for high LDL-C baboons 379 genes exhibited significant change in expression (162 down-regulated, 217 up-regulated) in response to the HCHF diet. We identified 494 miRNAs identical to human miRNAs and 47 novel miRNAs. Fifty miRNAs were differentially expressed in low LDL-C baboons (21 up- and 29 down-regulated) and 20 in high LDL-C baboons (11 up- and 9 down-regulated) in response to the HCHF diet. Among the differentially expressed miRNAs were miR-221/222 and miR-34a-3p, which were down-regulated, and miR-148a/b-5p, which was up-regulated. In addition, gene-targets of these miRNAs, VEGFA, MAML3, SPARC, and DMGDH, were inversely expressed and are central hub genes in networks and signaling pathways that differ between low and high LDL-C baboon HCHF diet response.We have identified coordinately regulated HCHF diet-responsive PBMC miRNA-gene networks that differ between baboons discordant for LDL-C concentrations. Our findings provide potential insights into molecular mechanisms underlying initiation of atherosclerosis where LDL-C concentrations influence expression of specific miRNAs, which in turn regulate expression of genes that play roles in initiation of lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2920895396,"In the last 20 years, atomic force microscopy (AFM) has emerged as a ubiquitous technique in biological research, allowing the analysis of biological samples under near-physiological conditions from single molecules to living cells. Despite its growing use, the low process throughput remains a major drawback. Here, we propose a solution validated on a device allowing a fully automated, multi-sample analysis. Our approach is mainly designed to study samples in fluid and biological cells. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate its feasibility applied to detect and scan both fixed and living bacteria before completion of data processing. The effect of two distinct treatments (i.e. gentamicin and heating) is then evidenced on physical parameters of fixed Yersinia pseudotuberculosis bacteria. The multi-sample analysis presented allows an increase in the number of scanned samples while limiting the user’s input. Importantly, cantilever cleaning and control steps are performed regularly–as part of the automated process–to ensure consistent scanning quality. We discuss how such an approach is paving the way to AFM developments in medical and clinical fields, in which statistical significance of results is a prerequisite."
https://openalex.org/W2921112626,"In phenylketonuria (PKU), a gene mutation in the phenylalanine metabolic pathway causes accumulation of phenylalanine (Phe) in blood and brain. Although early introduction of a Phe-restricted diet can prevent severe symptoms from developing, patients who are diagnosed and treated early still experience deficits in cognitive functioning indicating shortcomings of current treatment. In the search for new and/or additional treatment strategies, a specific nutrient combination (SNC) was postulated to improve brain function in PKU. In this study, a long-term dietary intervention with a low-Phe diet, a specific combination of nutrients designed to improve brain function, or both concepts together was investigated in male and female BTBR PKU and WT mice.48 homozygous wild-types (WT, +/+) and 96 PKU BTBRPah2 (-/-) male and female mice received dietary interventions from postnatal day 31 till 10 months of age and were distributed in the following six groups: high Phe diet (WT C-HP, PKU C-HP), high Phe plus specific nutrient combination (WT SNC-HP, PKU SNC-HP), PKU low-Phe diet (PKU C-LP), and PKU low-Phe diet plus specific nutrient combination (PKU SNC- LP). Memory and motor function were tested at time points 3, 6, and 9 months after treatment initiation in the open field (OF), novel object recognition test (NOR), spatial object recognition test (SOR), and the balance beam (BB). At the end of the experiments, brain neurotransmitter concentrations were determined.In the NOR, we found that PKU mice, despite being subjected to high Phe conditions, could master the task on all three time points when supplemented with SNC. Under low Phe conditions, PKU mice on control diet could master the NOR at all three time points, while PKU mice on the SNC supplemented diet could master the task at time points 6 and 9 months. SNC supplementation did not consistently influence the performance in the OF, SOR or BB in PKU mice. The low Phe diet was able to normalize concentrations of norepinephrine and serotonin; however, these neurotransmitters were not influenced by SNC supplementation.This study demonstrates that both a long-lasting low Phe diet, the diet enriched with SNC, as well as the combined diet was able to ameliorate some, but not all of these PKU-induced abnormalities. Specifically, this study is the first long-term intervention study in BTBR PKU mice that shows that SNC supplementation can specifically improve novel object recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2921337730,"Background Use of the arm above shoulder level has been described as a risk factor for developing rotator cuff tears (RCT). There is a lack of information regarding the frequency and distribution of RCT in a population using their arms above shoulder level during daily work. The aim of this study was to analyze clinical and radiographic findings in a population of painters working more than 10 years and to compare the results with a control group (CG) Materials and methods 100 individuals working more than 10 years as a painter were compared to 100 matched controls without using their arms above shoulder level. MRI scans were performed in all participants. Clinically, the Constant score, DASH score and range of motion (ROM) of the shoulders were analyzed. Results In the painter group (PG) a tear of the supraspinatus tendon was detected in 45% (10%full-thickness; 35% partial) compared to 8% in the (CG) (3% full-thickness; 5%partial; p<0.001). Impingement test was painful in 52% of PG and 7% of CG (p<0.001). The Constant score in the PG was significantly lower compared to the CG (62 vs. 93 points; p<0.001). PG had significantly worse DASH scores and inferior active and passive ROM of the dominant shoulders. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, three risk factors (smoking, sports activity, and handedness) showed no effect. However, group membership (PG/CG) and age revealed a significant effect. Conclusion Long-term occupational load on the shoulders in painters seems to be associated with an increased risk for developing RCT. Our findings may provide support for developing preventive strategies for this unique cohort. Level of evidence: III"

However, little is known about the precursors of prosocial spending directed to vulnerable people. We experimentally tested the effect of a first exposure to a prosocial donation decision on subsequent prosocial spending. We also examined the direct links from eudaimonic well-being beliefs (contribution-to-others and self-development) to prosocial spending, as well as the interaction between these beliefs and autonomy in predicting the money given. A total of 200 individuals participated in the study. Results showed that, compared to two control groups (""totally self-focused"" and ""no first-exposure""), an initial exposure to a prosocial donation decision increases subsequent prosocial spending. In addition, we observed an anchoring bias from the initial prosocial donation to subsequent prosocial spending. Regression analyses also confirmed the existence of a positive significant relationship between contribution-to-others beliefs and prosocial spending. Finally, we observed a significant interaction between autonomy and self-development well-being beliefs, such that autonomy strengthens the link from self-development beliefs to prosocial spending. In general, our results confirmed the significant role of exposure, anchoring, autonomy, and well-being beliefs in predicting the money spent to help vulnerable people."

As a result, the prevention and control of NCDs is recognized as urgent, while better surveillance at the country level could result in more effective policies. Hence, the objective of this study was to obtain more detailed information on the distribution of the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes among the population of two large districts of the city of São Paulo in Brazil, and to compare these findings to the results of a citywide health survey.This cross-sectional study used primary health care (PHC) routinely-collected data. The study population included 187,110 individuals 20 years of age or older registered in 13 public PHC facilities at two districts of the city of São Paulo in 2015. Data extracted from SIAB, a primary care database, was used to calculate age and sex directly standardized prevalences for diabetes and hypertension for each PHC facility. The prevalence of hypertension among women was significantly higher than the prevalence among men in the entire study population, and in every PHC facility. There was great variation among PHC facilities that was more pronounced among women. The prevalence of diabetes among women was significantly higher than the prevalence among men in the entire study population, and in every PHC facility, but there was little variation among PHC facilities.This study provided information that could help with policy planning and allocation of resources, and demonstrated the use of PHC routinely-collected data to generate important insights that if replicated could have a substantial impact given the broad coverage of the national public PHC program in Brazil."

This study was aimed (1) to extract key components of pediatric EGDT guidelines potentially becoming adherence criteria; (2) to classify adherence criteria into complete, clinically important, and feasible; and (3) to compare percent adherence to selected guidelines using the three approaches. Methods This study started with review of existing evidence to extract key components of pediatric EGDT guidelines. Modified Delphi method was then conducted in two rounds among national experts to identify feasible and/or clinically important criteria. Data from the national prospective multicenter study “Clinical Effectiveness of the Utilization of Bundled Care for Severe Sepsis and Septicemia Children” at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (KCMH) during 1 June 2012 and 28 February 2014 was used to compare percentage of adherence across the three approaches. Results Of 28 components extracted from the review, 10 were identified by the national experts through the Modified Delphi as feasible whereas 8 were identified as clinically important. Thirty-one severe sepsis patients (48.39% male, median age 3.4 years) were reviewed. Sepsis mortality was 9.7%, a significant reduction from 19% and 42% in 2010 and 2007, respectively. Based on the complete adherence criteria, the percent adherence varied from 60.71% to 89.29% (overall mean 76.84%), with lower adherence in the dead than the survived cases (73.81% vs 77.17%; p = 0.55). The percent adherence varied by criteria used: 69.35%, 76.84%, and 84.52% for clinical importance, complete, and feasibility criteria, respectively. Conclusion Adherence determination based on selected clinical importance alone might result in an incorrectly estimated clinical benefit of EGDT guidelines, especially in a resource-limited setting. Both clinical importance and feasibility should be integrated into the development of adherence assessment criteria."

Flipboards around the room fill with sticky notes, each with a scribbled thought or idea. A board labeled “What will Brexit mean for your career?” highlights the toll it has already taken. One scientist abandoned their application for the European Union's Horizon 2020 funding program. Others are reluctantly making plans to leave the United Kingdom. A note with the word “uncertainty” stands out in the middle of the board. And yet, a month before the official Brexit date, the atmosphere is surprisingly positive. Coming together to discuss these challenges seems to be giving us confidence that we will find a way forward.

> “I thought a workshop might help us figure out how to move forward.” 

After the British public voted in 2016 to leave the European Union, everything felt up in the air. ECRs already face huge career uncertainty because of our time-limited contracts and increasing pressures on funding and publishing. For those of us in the United Kingdom—and anyone who might have considered coming here—Brexit is making it that much worse. I travel abroad for collaboration and fieldwork every year. Will that get a lot harder? Will funding become even scarcer when EU grants are no longer available? An estimated 50% of postgraduate research scientists in the United Kingdom come from abroad. Will they still be able to work and study here?

As the referendum result sank in, I wanted answers to these questions, and I knew other ECRs felt the same way. I thought a workshop might help us figure out how to move forward, so I assembled a team of organizers and began to recruit speakers. Finding scientists prepared to discuss Brexit outside the usual environs of the pub or coffee room was not easy, but we got the support of the British Ecological Society and eventually booked a date for February 2019.

When I arrived in London that morning, I worried that the ongoing uncertainty about how exactly the United Kingdom will leave the European Union might spell ruin for the event. I had assumed that the government would have some sort of plan by the time our workshop rolled around, and that we would be able to dig into the specifics of what Brexit would mean for scientists. That plan had not materialized.

But I needn't have worried. Our speakers provided great insight about what could happen, and the attendees engaged in positive, vibrant discussions about how they could influence events or adapt. At lunch, I noticed that Twitter was alive with ECRs—including many attendees and thousands of others outside the room—using the hashtag we had created for the event, #ECRsChatBrexit. I tapped away on my phone and chipped in over mouthfuls of sandwich, happy that we had created a space for people to talk about this.

So, what did everyone have to say? Well, like most scientists, our attendees wish the government would take a longer-term approach to science policymaking, as well as funding and developing the people involved in research. We also discussed how Brexit might offer opportunities for ECRs to step up and play a role in shaping policy. For example, a proposed minimum salary threshold for the immigration of highly skilled workers could seriously limit the ability of ECRs to move to the United Kingdom. We should be weighing in and making sure that lawmakers recognize these implications. The U.K. government will also be writing new environmental policy. Will those of us early in our careers find our voice and reimagine how this policy could work—how it should work?

Of course, we can't solve all these problems ourselves—or in a single day. But raising our concerns and discussing solutions certainly helped get things clearer in our heads.

What happens in the United Kingdom over the next few years will define scientists' working lives for decades to come. For us ECRs, that will be most of our careers. We have the biggest stake in the game. We should have our say in it. Hopefully, our workshop was just the beginning of that conversation.
