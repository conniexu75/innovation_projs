https://openalex.org/W2107086632,"The T-DNA of the Ri plasmid from Agrobacterium rhizogenes is compatible with the regeneration of whole plants from genetically transformed roots and is transmitted through meiosis to the progeny of genetically transformed plants in carrot, tobacco, and morning glory (Convolvulus arvensis). The presence of Ri T-DNA is correlated with a phenotype that in some respects is invariable from species to species and in other respects varies as a function of species, organ clone within species, or individual. The transformed phenotype concerns a variety of morphological and physiological traits, is dominantly inherited in tobacco, but does not in general appear to be deleterious. The Ri T-DNA may provide a molecular starting point for studying a number of basic phenomena in plant morphology and physiology."
https://openalex.org/W1542978449,"Rearrangements of membrane glycoproteins are believed to occur during platelet activation, but these changes have not been well defined. We have developed a monoclonal antibody, named S12, which demonstrates dramatically enhanced binding to platelets after thrombin activation. Unstimulated gel-filtered platelets from 12 normal individuals bound only 800 +/- 470 (S.D.) 125I-S12 molecules/cell, while platelets stimulated with 0.5 unit/ml of thrombin bound 9,600 +/- 2,600 molecules/cell (KD = 1.5 nM). Increasing thrombin concentrations produced similar increases in platelet 125I-S12 binding and [14C]serotonin secretion. S12 binding was not dependent on divalent cations. ADP and epinephrine, which caused no [14C]serotonin secretion, had little or no effect on S12 binding. We isolated the S12 binding protein by affinity chromatography of Lubrol PX-solubilized human platelet membranes on S12-agarose. When analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the isolated protein stains with both periodic acid-Schiff and Coomassie Blue and has an apparent molecular weight of 138,000 (unreduced) and 148,000 (reduced). After radioiodination of intact platelets the protein was also labeled, with apparently equal intensity in both control and thrombin-stimulated cells. The protein's staining, radiolabeling properties, and mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels relative to glycoprotein IIb-IIIa fit previously defined criteria for membrane glycoprotein IIa. Our studies provide further evidence for alterations in membrane glycoproteins after platelet stimulation and suggest that S12 may serve as a useful probe of in vivo platelet activation."
https://openalex.org/W1806496211,"To identify structures on the platelet surface which become expressed after platelet activation, we have prepared murine monoclonal antibodies specific for thrombin-activated platelets. Hybridomas were screened for clones producing antibodies which bound to thrombin-activated platelets but not to resting platelets. Clone KC4 was identified. The binding of purified I-labeled KC4 antibody, an IgG1k, to thrombin-activated platelets was saturable. Minimal binding was observed to resting platelets. The interaction of antibody with thrombin-activated platelets was characterized by a binding constant, KD, of 7.2 +/- 0.4 nM and revealed 13,400 +/- 3,000 binding sites per platelet. The presence of Ca2+ or EDTA, a pH ranging from 4 to 10, or high ionic strength had no influence on antigen-antibody interaction. The KC4 antigen was expressed on the platelet surface after activation with ADP, collagen, epinephrine, or thrombin. The extent of [14C] serotonin release during activation was directly proportional to the availability of antigen on the platelet surface regardless of agonist or platelet aggregation. The antibody is directed against a single protein which migrated between GPIIb and GPIIa after sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. This protein was purified from platelet membranes by immunoaffinity chromatography using KC4 antibody-agarose and demonstrated an apparent molecular weight of 140,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under both nonreducing and reducing conditions. Of the cells examined, only platelets contained this protein. These results indicate that platelet secretion is associated with the expression of an Mr = 140,000 integral membrane protein composed of a single polypeptide chain. This protein may be component of the internal granule membrane which is fused with the plasma membrane during activation."
https://openalex.org/W1549590649,"Using an in vitro system which contained enzymes, substrates, and other reactants at concentrations which approximated the in vivo conditions in rat liver, we measured the simultaneous product formation by three enzymes which utilize homocysteine. In the control system, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate homocysteine methyltransferase, betaine homocysteine methyltransferase, and cystathionine beta-synthase accounted for 27, 27, and 46%, respectively, of the homocysteine consumed. Subsequent studies demonstrated that the adaptation from a high protein diet to a low protein diet is achieved by a significant increase in betaine homocysteine methyltransferase, and 83% reduction in cystathionine synthase, and a total decrease of 55% in the consumption of homocysteine. S-Adenosylmethionine, by activating cystathionine synthase, contributes significantly to the regulation of the pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1526942240,"This study extends our earlier work (Abumrad, N. A., Perkins, R.C., Park, J.H., and Park, C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 256, 9183-9191) which showed that oleate permeates the plasma membrane of the rat adipocyte principally by a transport process with the characteristics of facilitated diffusion. In the present study, fatty acid (FA) transport is characterized with regard to its specificity and susceptibility to inhibition by protein modifiers. The kinetics of competitive inhibition for transport of oleate and stearate are shown under conditions where complications due to competition for binding of FAs to the albumin in the medium are minimized. Stearate inhibits influx of tracer oleate with a Ki that closely approximates its Km and, conversely, oleate inhibits similarly the influx of tracer stearate. Specificity of the FA transport system is shown in studies using a variety of natural FAs of different chain length, or FA analogues. Oleate (Km = 0.06 microM), stearate (Km = 0.16 microM), linoleate (Km = 0.22 microM), palmitate, (Km = 0.2 microM), and laurate (Km = 1.5 microM) are good substrates, but octanoate is not transported. An oxazolidine ring on C-5 but not on C-16 of stearate blocks binding to the transporter. Methylation of the carboxyl function but not alpha-bromination inhibits transport. These studies suggest that a FA must have a hydrocarbon chain of at least nine carbons and a free carboxyl function to be recognized by the transporter. FA transport does not require Na or ATP. Pronase but not trypsin treatment of intact cells reduces fatty acid influx. Transport is insensitive to maleimides. It is strongly and irreversibly blocked by pretreatment of the cells with the stilbene compounds, 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate and 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, but only slightly inhibited by dipyridamole. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of plasma membrane proteins from cells treated with [3H] 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate shows a peak of radioactivity at about Mr = 85,000. When cells are incubated in various concentrations of this agent, the counts recovered in the peak reach a maximum coincident with maximum inhibition of transport. We conclude that permeation of the plasma membrane of the adipocyte by long-chain FAs at physiological concentrations is mediated by a protein transporter with distinct specificity requirements."
https://openalex.org/W1987224807,"The 3′ terminus of most, if not all, eucaryotic poly-adenylated mRNAs is formed as a result of endonucleolytic cleavage of a larger precursor RNA. That is, transcription does not terminate at the mRNA 3′ sequence but rather proceeds through this site, terminating at some distance downstream. Using a plasmid containing the adenovirus E2A transcriptional unit, we have investigated the sequence requirement for the formation of a mature mRNA 3′ terminus, focusing on the role of sequences immediately distal to the poly(A) addition site. Deletion mutants were constructed in the region distal to the poly(A) addition site and assayed by transfection into human 293 cells. The results demonstrate that 35 nucleotides distal to the site of poly(A) addition are sufficient for the formation of a mature E2 mRNA. However, removal of an additional 15 nucleotides, leaving 20 nucleotides distal to the poly(A) site, abolished the ability to produce functional E2A mRNA. The defect in the production of functional mRNA from such a mutant appears to be in the proper cleavage of the primary transcript at the poly(A) addition site. It would thus appear that sequences immediately distal to the site of poly(A) addition do not contribute to the mature mRNA but are essential for the formation of mature mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1497210970,"Quantitative changes in cytosolic free calcium [( Ca2+]i), membrane potential, and aldosterone production in response to angiotensin II and extracellular potassium were measured in intact bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells loaded with the fluorescent calcium indicator quin 2. Angiotensin II (10(-9) M) induced a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i from 124 +/- 26 nM to 204 +/- 63 nM (n = 7), which was followed by steroid production, as measured in dynamic studies with superfused adrenal cells, and by slower changes in membrane potential, as assessed with the fluorescent probe 3,3'-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine. Both [Ca2+]i rises and functional response were blocked by the antagonist analogue [Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II in a dose-dependent manner. Potassium (3-10 mM) provoked dose-dependent increases in [Ca2+]i, with ED50 of 6.5 mM, associated with rapid changes in membrane potential, a response superimposable upon the dose-related aldosterone production induced by potassium in static incubations of quin 2-loaded glomerulosa cells (ED50 = 6.8 mM). Verapamil (2 X 10(-5) M) and nifedipine (10(-7)-10(-6) M) decreased resting [Ca2+]i and blocked entirely the rise in [Ca2+]i induced by potassium, but did not suppress the [Ca2+]i rises induced by angiotensin II. These findings indicate that two important physiological regulators of aldosterone secretion, extracellular potassium, by the opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels, and angiotensin II, by a receptor-mediated mechanism, induce rapid rises in cytosolic free calcium, which precede, and presumably trigger the steroidogenic response."
https://openalex.org/W1545190048,"When platelets were stimulated with ADP to cause shape change without aggregation or secretion, myosin 20,000-Da light chain phosphorylation was rapid and appeared to precede slightly the shape change response. While the shape of the platelets remained spheroidal, myosin phosphorylation was transient and after 2-5 min returned to the same level as that of unstimulated cells. Phosphorylation of the 47,000-Da platelet protein was minimal under these conditions. The phosphorylation time course was not altered by the addition of indomethacin or allowing the cells to aggregate. The dose-response curve of myosin phosphorylation very closely paralleled that of shape change with a midpoint at 0.7 microM ADP. ATP, a competitive antagonist of ADP, inhibited both shape change and myosin phosphorylation with the same concentration of ATP causing 50% inhibition of each response. Similarly, when platelets were stimulated with either 15-hydroxy-9,11-azo-prostadienoic acid or collagen, myosin phosphorylation slightly preceded shape change. These results suggest that myosin phosphorylation is required for the initial change in platelet shape but is not necessary for maintenance of the spherical shape."
https://openalex.org/W1573682211,"The kinetics of cytotoxicity induced by ricin and a series of immunotoxins consisting of ricin A-chain coupled to antibodies against cell-surface antigens has been studied. The inhibition of protein synthesis in cells treated with immunotoxins or ricin occurs after a lag period. The rate of protein synthesis decreases according to a mono-exponential function, indicating a first-order process. With increasing concentration of immunotoxin, a maximal rate of inhibition is reached. The inactivation rate induced by immunotoxins was much slower than that achieved with ricin, even when products were compared on a basis of an identical number of molecules bound per cell, demonstrating the real higher efficacy of ricin. The time required to reduce protein synthesis by 90%, denoted T10, was 1.4-1.6 h with ricin, 60 h with anti-T65 immunotoxin on CEM human T leukemia cells (T65 positive), 65 h with anti-p97 immunotoxin on SK-MEL 28 human melanoma cells (p97 positive), and 20 h with an IgM anti-Thy 1.2 immunotoxin on WEHI-7 mouse T leukemia cells (Thy 1.2 positive). In this latter case, when the IgM antibody was replaced by an IgG anti-Thy 1.2, a 5-fold increase in the inactivation rate was obtained, demonstrating the importance of the binding moiety for the immunotoxins. Lysosomotropic amines such as ammonium chloride, chloroquine, and methylamine and carboxylic ionophores such as monensin, which are known to interfere with the uptake of certain macromolecules, strongly increased the rate of protein synthesis inhibition by all immunotoxins tested and increased 4-50,000-fold the sensitivity of cells to the immunotoxin. Enhancement in the inactivation rate was as much as 7-10-fold when either of these compounds was added, generating T10 values comparable to those of ricin."
https://openalex.org/W1560215073,"Torpedo acetylcholine receptor was reconstituted into liposomes of pure synthetic lipids in order to study the influence of the lipid environment on affinity state transitions and the ion translocation function of the receptor. A critical concentration of 30 to 40% of cholesteryl hemisuccinate was necessary in liposomes made of cholesteryl hemisuccinate and dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine to mimic the kinetics of agonist-induced state transitions observed in native membranes. With increasing chain length of the saturated lecithins, a marked increase in carbamylcholine dissociation constants was observed. Substitution by other dimyristoyl phospholipids for dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine had the same, though quantitatively less pronounced effects. Introduction of unsaturation in the acyl chains reverted the effect of increasing chain length. Unsaturated phosphatidylethanolamines in combination with 28-35 mol% of cholesteryl hemisuccinate was the best lipid mixture for reconstitution of the receptor-gating function. When phosphatidylethanolamine was replaced totally or partially by other phospholipids with the same or different acyl chain composition, a marked decrease of ion transport was apparent, even when similar vesicle size, receptor incorporation, and agonist-induced affinity transitions were obtained. Therefore, the maintenance of the affinity state transitions of the reconstituted receptor is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the manifestation of the ion-gating receptor activity. On the other hand, the more unsaturated the acyl chains of phosphatidylethanolamine are, the higher the response that was observed, suggesting that a critical lipid packing is essential for the ion translocation function of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1509487637,"Glycylsarcosine was found to be very resistant to hydrolysis by brush-border membrane vesicles from rabbit intestine. The dipeptide was transported intact into an osmotically responsive intravesicular space. The initial uptake rate of glycylsarcosine into these vesicles was greater in mannitol medium compared to that in the presence of an inward gradient of either Na+ or other monovalent cations. When vesicles preloaded with glycylsarcosine were incubated in a peptide-free medium, there was a rapid efflux of the dipeptide and the t1/2 for the process was less than 2 min. An inside-negative K+ diffusion potential generated by valinomycin stimulated glycylsarcosine uptake even in the absence of Na+. Experiments with the potential-sensitive dye DiS-C3 (5) showed that glycylsarcosine depolarized the brush-border membrane in the presence and absence of Na+. Imposition of an inward proton gradient stimulated the initial uptake rates of glycylsarcosine while the equilibrium uptake was not affected. Carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone decreased this proton gradient-induced stimulation. An inward proton gradient increased the Vmax of the transport system (10.8 +/- 0.8 nmol/min/mg of protein when [pH]o = [pH]i = 5.5; and 20.8 +/- 2.2 nmol/min/mg of protein when [pH]o = 5.5 and [pH]i = 7.8), without significantly affecting the apparent Kt (17.3 +/- 1.4 mM versus 19.5 +/- 2.0 mM). Glycyl-L-proline uptake was inhibited by glycylsarcosine and KI for the process was 20.8 +/- 3.0 mM. A relatively lower KI (2.8 +/- 1.2 mM) was obtained for the inhibition of glycylsarcosine uptake by glycyl-L-proline. The uptake of glycyl-L-proline and glycylsarcosine was strongly inhibited by L-carnosine, glycyl-L-leucine, and L-prolylglycine. With each inhibitory peptide, the KI values for the inhibition of glycyl-L-proline uptake and of glycylsarcosine uptake were comparable. Preloading the vesicles with unlabeled glycylsarcosine stimulated the uptake of labeled glycyl-L-proline. These data suggest that in rabbit intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles (i) glycylsarcosine and proton(s) are co-transported, (ii) this process results in a net transport of positive charge across the membrane and, (iii) a single transport system is involved in the translocation of glycyl-L-proline and glycylsarcosine."
https://openalex.org/W1527239312,"The interaction of the amphipath chlorpromazine (CPZ) with the human erythrocyte membrane was evaluated. The partition coefficient of CPZ between the membrane bilayer and the aqueous compartment, measured spectrophotometrically, ranged between 1 and 3 X 10(3). An independent estimate, 4.6 X 10(3), was obtained by a novel method which avoided the measurement of binding and determined instead the variation of the hemolytic potency of the amphipath with the ratio of buffer volume to membrane volume. The maximal uptake of CPZ exceeded 2 X 10(9) molecules/red cell, corresponding to a volume greater than that of the bilayer itself. Such heavily loaded membranes were increased in thickness more than 2-fold, suggesting the formation of a CPZ-rich zone at the center of the bilayer. Ghosts loaded with massive levels of CPZ condensed approximately 20-fold in surface area and increased proportionately in thickness, suggesting the formation of a novel CPZ-lipid solution. CPZ caused hemolysis by a colloid-osmotic mechanism. By measuring the simultaneous uptake of mannitol and sucrose, we determined that CPZ induced holes of constant size but variable number. If circular, the holes would have had a diameter of approximately 14 A. The time-averaged number of holes ranged from 0.09 per cell (signifying intermittency) to 16. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy of CPZ-treated red cells revealed multiple round patches of nearly particle-free bilayer up to 0.3 micron in diameter with crowding of the intramembrane particles into the surrounding membrane. We interpret these images to signify lateral phase separation within the CPZ-treated bilayer. Hemolysis could, therefore, result from the intermittent opening of weak seams at phase boundaries; these could then be fluctuating slits approximately 14 A in width and of variable length, rather than simple circular holes."
https://openalex.org/W2138997714,"Basolateral plasma membrane vesicles were prepared from rat liver by a new technique using self-generating Percoll gradients. The method is rapid (total spin time of 2.5 h) and protein yields were high (0.64 mg/g of liver). Transmission electron microscopy studies and measurements of marker enzyme activities indicated that the preparation was highly enriched in basolateral membranes and substantially free of contamination by canalicular membranes or subcellular organelles. High total recoveries for protein yield and marker enzyme activities during the fractionation procedure indicated that enzymatic activity was neither lost (inactivation) nor increased (activation). Thus, the pattern of marker enzyme activities found in the membrane preparation truly reflected substantial enrichment in membranes from the basolateral surface. Analysis of freeze-fracture electron micrographs suggested that approximately 75% of the vesicles were oriented right-side-out. In order to assess the functional properties of the vesicles, the uptake of [3H]taurocholate was studied. In the presence of a Na+ gradient, taurocholate uptake was markedly stimulated and the bile acid was transiently accumulated at a concentration 1.5- to 2-fold higher than that at equilibrium (overshoot). In the absence of a gradient but in the presence of equimolar Na+ inside and outside of the vesicle, taurocholate uptake was faster than in the absence of Na+. These findings support a direct co-transport mechanism for the uptake of taurocholate and Na+. Kinetic studies demonstrated that Na+-dependent taurocholate uptake was saturable with a Km of 36.5 microM and a Vmax of 5.36 nmol mg-1 protein min-1. The high yield, enzymatic profile and retention of transport properties suggest that this membrane preparation is well suited for studies of basolateral transport."
https://openalex.org/W2139221400,"The structure of sialylated carbohydrate units of bronchial mucins obtained from cystic fibrosis patients was investigated by 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy in conjunction with sugar analysis. After subjecting the mucins to alkaline borohydride degradation, sialylated oligosaccharide-alditols were isolated by anion-exchange chromatography and fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography. Five compounds could be obtained in a rather pure state; their structures were established as the following: A-1, NeuAc alpha(2----3)Gal beta(1----4) [Fuc alpha(1----3)]GlcNAc beta(1----3)Gal-NAc-ol; A-2, NeuAc alpha(2----3)Gal beta(1----4)GlcNAc beta(1----6)-[GlcNAc beta (1----3)]GalNAc-o1; A-3, NeuAc alpha(2----3)Gal beta-(1----4)[Fuc alpha(1----3)]GlcNAc beta(1----3)Gal beta(1----3) GalNAc-o1; A-4, NeuAc alpha(2----3)Gal beta(1----4)[Fuc alpha(1----3)]Glc-NAc NAc beta(1----6)[GlcNAc beta(1----3)]GalNAc-o1; A-6,NeuAc alpha-(2----3) Gal beta(1----4)[Fuc alpha(1----3)]GlcNAc beta(1----6)[Gal beta-(1----4) GlcNAc beta(1----3)]GalNAc-o1. The simultaneous presence of sialic acid in alpha(2----3)-linkage to Gal and fucose in alpha(1----3)-linkage to GlcNAc of the same N-acetyllactosamine unit could be adequately proved by high resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy. This sequence constitutes a novel structural element for mucins."
https://openalex.org/W1535781736,"Differential and isopycnic centrifugation of rat liver homogenates showed that, besides its established localization in peroxisomes and endoplasmic reticulum, dihydroxyacetone-phosphate acyltransferase is also present in mitochondria. The three activities differed in a number of properties (pH optimum, palmitoyl-CoA and dihydroxyacetone-phosphate dependence, and sensitivity toward N-ethylmaleimide) and are therefore likely associated with three distinct proteins. Glycerol 3-phosphate (5 mM) did not inhibit peroxisomal dihydroxyacetone-phosphate acyltransferase but inhibited the extraperoxisomal activities virtually completely. Peroxisomal dihydroxyacetone-phosphate acyltransferase was located at the inner aspect of the peroxisomal membrane, but the enzyme was not latent. Purified microsomes, from which intact peroxisomes had been removed, were still contaminated with peroxisomal membranes as deduced from the presence of two dihydroxyacetone-phosphate acyltransferase activities: a glycerol 3-phosphate-resistant activity with properties similar to those of peroxisomal dihydroxyacetone-phosphate acyltransferase and a glycerol 3-phosphate-sensitive true microsomal dihydroxyacetone-phosphate acyltransferase. We propose that, assayed in the presence of 5mM glycerol 3-phosphate, dihydroxyacetone-phosphate acyltransferase can be used as a marker enzyme for peroxisomal membranes. Such a marker enzyme has not hitherto been available. The differential effect of 5 mM glycerol 3-phosphate on peroxisomal and extraperoxisomal dihydroxyacetone-phosphate acyltransferases enabled us to determine the relative contribution of these activities to overall dihydroxyacetone-phosphate acylation in whole liver homogenates. At near-physiological pH and at near-physiological concentrations of unbound palmitoyl-CoA and of dihydroxyacetone-phosphate plus glycerol 3-phosphate, peroxisomes contributed 50-75%. The remaining percentage was mostly accounted for by the microsomal enzyme. At near-physiological concentrations of glycerol 3-phosphate plus dihydroxyacetone-phosphate, glycerolphosphate acyltransferase contributed 93% and dihydroxyacetone-phosphate acyltransferase 7% to overall glycerolipid synthesis in homogenates. This suggests that the dihydroxyacetone-phosphate pathway is of minor quantitative importance in overall hepatic glycerolipid synthesis but that its main function lies in the synthesis of ether lipids, which have acyldihydroxyacetone-phosphate as obligatory precursor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1514245212,"Ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase (ferredoxin: NADP+ reductase, EC 1.18.1.2) was shown to form a ternary complex with its substrates ferredoxin (Fd) and NADP(H), but the ternary complex was less stable than the separate binary complexes. Kd for oxidized binary Fd-ferredoxin NADP+ reductase complex was less than 50 nM; Kd(Fd) increased with NADP+ concentration, approaching 0.5-0.6 microM when the flavoprotein was saturated with NADP+ K(NADP+) also increased from about 14 microM to about 310 microM, on addition of excess Fd. The changes in Kd were consistent with negative cooperativity between the associations of Fd and NADP+ and with our unpublished observations which suggest that product dissociation is rate-limiting in the reaction mechanism. Similar interference in binding was observed in more reduced states; NADPH released much ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase from Fd-Sepharose whether the proteins were initially oxidized or reduced. Complexation between Fd and ferredoxin: NADP+ reductase was found to shield each center from paramagnetic probes; charge specificity suggested that the active sites of Fd and ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase were, respectively, negatively and positively charged."
https://openalex.org/W1561324608,"These studies were undertaken to examine the effects of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) on the transfer of cholesteryl esters from high density lipoproteins (HDL) to very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). Human or rat VLDL was incubated with human HDL in the presence of either partially purified CETP, bovine milk LPL or CETP plus LPL. CETP stimulated both isotopic and mass transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL into VLDL. LPL caused only slight stimulation of cholesteryl ester transfer. However, when CETP and LPL were both present, the transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL into VLDL remnants was enhanced 2- to 8-fold, compared to the effects of CETP alone. The synergistic effects of CETP and LPL on cholesteryl ester transfer were more pronounced at higher VLDL/HDL ratios and increased with increasing amounts of CETP. In time course studies the stimulation of cholesteryl ester transfer activity occurred during active triglyceride hydrolysis. When lipolysis was inhibited by incubating LPL with either 1 M NaCl or 2 mM diethylparanitrophenyl phosphate, the synergism of CETP and LPL was reduced or abolished, and LPL alone did not stimulate cholesteryl ester transfer. These experiments show that LPL enhances the CETP-mediated transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to VLDL. This property of LPL is related to lipolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2151473497,"The catalytic properties of the testis microsomal P-450, termed P-450sccII, have been studied in a refined assay system which consists of P-450sccII (13 nmol of P-450 heme/mg of protein) and its reductase has been purified extensively from pig testis. The results indicated that P-450sccII was highly active in catalyzing hydroxylation of 11 beta-hydroxyprogesterone at the 17 alpha-position to give 21-deoxycortisol and cleavage of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone at the 17-20 bond to give androstenedione with turnover numbers of 25 and 30 mol/min X mol of P-450, respectively. In contrast, many physiologically important corticosteroids we tested were found to be poor substrates for both the hydroxylase and lyase reactions. The possible reason for the importance of these substrate specificity of P-450sccII in production of both corticosteroids and androgens in the endocrine tissues is discussed. P-450sccII also catalyzed conversion of testosterone to androstenedione, but 18O experiments failed to show incorporation of atmospheric oxygen into the androstenedione formed. However, this does not preclude the possibility that the P-450-bound intermediate gem-diol stereoselectively dehydrates to give the nonlabeled ketosteroid. In addition to these steroid-oxidizing activities, P-450sccII revealed considerable specificities toward various xenobiotics, suggesting that P-450sccII and liver microsomal P-450 are basically similar as regards enzymatic functions and activities."
https://openalex.org/W1518141245,"The phosphate transport protein from beef heart mitochondria has been purified on a large scale by hydroxylapatite chromatography in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and urea. As shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (silver stain), the pure phosphate transport protein preparation consists of two protein bands (alpha and beta, ratio 1:1) with similar mobilities (34 kDa) which display identical peptide maps if fragmented with either CNBr or HCl/dimethyl sulfoxide/HBr. The complete amino acid composition of phosphate transport protein is presented. Quantitative determination of N-terminal amino acids underlines the purity of the preparation and shows for alpha and beta the identical amino-terminals H2N-Ala-Val-Glu-Glu-Glx-Tyr-. Qualitative digestion shows that carboxypeptidase A is able to release at least three amino acids from the C termini of the alpha as well as the beta band of phosphate transport protein. The nature of these two protein bands is discussed. The sum of phosphate transport protein (alpha + beta) per total mitochondrial protein amounts to 2.3% or 1.4 nmol of phosphate transport protein (34 kDa) per nmol of cytochrome b."
https://openalex.org/W1595267158,"A corrinoid protein has been purified from Clostridium thermoaceticum which is required for the synthesis of acetyl-CoA from carbon monoxide and methyltetrahydrofolate. The purified protein is an alpha beta dimer with subunit molecular weights of 34,000 and 55,000, respectively, and contains 0.69 mol of corrinoid/mol of dimer. The corrinoid protein is methylated in the presence of methyltransferase and methyltetrahydrofolate; methylation is on the cobalt of the corrinoid moiety of the protein. When 14C-methylated protein is incubated with Fraction F3, ATP, CoASH, and CO, [14C]acetyl-CoA is formed. Methylation of cobalamin (B12) is catalyzed by the methyltransferase but methylcobalamin does not substitute for the methylated corrinoid protein as the source of methyl in the formation of acetyl-CoA."
https://openalex.org/W1607471557,"Hepatic monoacylglycerol acyltransferase activity is 700-fold higher during the suckling period than in the adult rat. Specific activity in total particulate preparations rose from 9.4 nmol/min/mg before birth to a peak of 78 nmol/min/mg on the 6th to 8th postnatal days. Monoacylglycerol acyltransferase activity fell sharply after day 8 and was 1.6 and 0.1 nmol/min/mg on day 28 and in adult rats, respectively. The activity had a pH optimum at 8.0 and was activated by albumin and by phospholipids. With [3H]palmitoyl-CoA and sn-2-monooleoylglycerol, more than 96% of the products were di- and triacylglycerols. More than 92% of the diacylglycerol product was the 1,2 isomer. The activity was stable at 43 degrees C for 50 min. Thermal inactivation showed t 1/2 values of 8 min and 4.5 min at 53.5 and 55 degrees C, respectively. In suckling rats, monoacylglycerol acyltransferase activities in liver and intestinal mucosa were 150- to 800-fold higher than in other tissues. Monoacylglycerol acyltransferase activity was 12.5-fold greater with palmitoyl-CoA than with octanoyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA was not a substrate. The sn-2-monoacylglycerols were strongly preferred over the sn-1 isomers. No direct relationship was noted between 2-monoacylglycerol chain length and apparent Km value. The presence of high levels of monoacylglycerol acyltransferase activity in suckling rat liver suggests that the monoacylglycerol pathway functions as a major route of hepatic glycerolipid synthesis during the suckling period but not in adult animals."
https://openalex.org/W1594468751,"Adenosine 5'-phosphate was synthesized with 3H or 14C label specifically located as [1'-3H]AMP, [1'-14C] AMP, [5'-3H]AMP, and [5'-14C]AMP. The synthesis was accomplished from adenine and glucose or adenine and ribose using enzymes from the pentose pathway and/or from the purine salvage pathways. Structural analysis of the compounds confirmed the locations of the radiolabels. The methods provide a general scheme for the efficient synthesis of adenine nucleotides of high purity with 3H or 14C at any stable position on the ribose ring. Synthesis of [5'-14C]dAMP and [1'-3H] dAMP from the corresponding ribonucleotides was accomplished with ribonucleotide reductase. Labeled inosine was prepared by enzymatic dephosphorylation and deamination of labeled AMP. These compounds have been used to measure the secondary kinetic isotope effects on the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond of AMP, dAMP, and inosine and the corresponding primary kinetic isotope effects with AMP. Acid hydrolysis in 0.1 or 0.2 N HCl at 50 degrees C gave 1H/3H secondary kinetic isotope effects of 1.23 +/- 0.01, 1.26 +/- 0.01, and 1.230 +/- 0.003 for AMP, dAMP, and inosine, respectively. The primary kinetic isotope effect for 12C/14C was 1.049 +/- 0.010 for AMP. The apparent rate constants for hydrolysis under these conditions were similar for inosine and AMP and were in the range 10(-6)-10(-5)s-1. Acid hydrolysis of dAMP is approximately 1000-fold faster than AMP but gives a similar 1H/3H kinetic isotope effect. The results of secondary isotope effects indicate that the transition states for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bonds of inosine, AMP, and dAMP have similar bonding to 1'-3H in the transition state and have considerable carboxonium character. Results with [1'-14C]AMP demonstrate that a significant primary isotope effect can be measured in the acid solvolysis of the N-glycosidic bond of AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1487212611,"Opines are unusual compounds found specifically in plant crown gall tumors. Genes for their synthesis and catabolism reside in agrobacteria as tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid DNA. Only a small Ti-plasmid segment (24 kilobase pairs), the T-DNA, is transferred to the plant cell where it commonly codes for enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of nitrogenous opines such as nopaline (N2-(1,3-D-dicarboxypropyl)-L-arginine) as well as the tumor phenotype. Ellis and Murphy, (Ellis, J.G., and Murphy, P.J. (1981) Mol. Gen. Genet. 181, 36-43) reported the existence of the phosphorylated opines, agrocinopines A and B in tumors containing nopaline. Pure agrocinopine A has now been isolated in a yield of 0.05-0.06 g/100 g, fresh weight, from such tumors. Physical, chemical, and biological data establish the structure of agrocinopine A as an unusual non-nitrogenous opine of sucrose and L-arabinose with a phosphodiester linkage from the 2-hydroxyl of the arabinose to the 4-hydroxyl of the fructose moiety in sucrose. Agrocinopine B is the corresponding phosphodiester, in which the glucose has been hydrolyzed from the sucrose portion of agrocinopine A. Borohydride reduction of the free L-arabinose anomeric carbon of agrocinopine A, to the corresponding arabinitol derivative eliminates the characteristic inhibition zone enhancement produced by both agrocinopines A and B in the agrocin 84 (a fraudulent adenine nucleotide) bioassay. Because of the limited number of genes in the T-DNA, a generalization is proposed, whereby all opines will be found to comprise two common plant cell constituents linked in an uncommon manner by the minimum number of enzymes."

Banks, G.R., and Lehman, I.R. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 9037-9039; Yagura, T., Kozu, T., and Seno, T. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 11121-11127; Shioda, M., Nelson, E.M., Bayne, M.L., and Benbow, R.M. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 7209-7213). We have investigated the de novo synthesis of DNA by a primase-DNA polymerase alpha preparation isolated from human HeLa cells using the synthetic homopolymers poly(dT) and poly(dC) as templates. In the presence of poly(dT), synthesis of poly(dA) required ATP in addition to dATP while synthesis of poly(dG) in the presence of poly(dC) required GTP in addition to dGTP. The primase activity required a much lower GTP concentration (Km = 0.1 mM) than ATP (Km = 0.8 mM) for the synthesis of DNA. Guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), 5'-guanylyl-beta, gamma-imidodiphosphate, and 5'-guanylyl methylenediphosphonate substituted for GTP but the corresponding ATP analogues did not substitute for ATP. Furthermore, ATP and ATP analogues inhibited the GTP-dependent reaction while GTP and GTP analogues inhibited the ATP-dependent reaction. DNase treatment of products labeled with [alpha-32P] GTP revealed that an RNA oligomer was covalently linked to newly synthesized DNA. Alkaline hydrolysis of these products yielded GMP and pppGp, indicating that the primer was initiated with GTP. Alkaline hydrolysis of [alpha-32P]dGTP-labeled products yielded 2'- and 3'-GMP showing that DNA chains are covalently linked to the 3' ends of RNA chains. The primase activity could not be separated from DNA polymerase alpha through a 200-fold enrichment involving phosphocellulose, DNA-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, DEAE-cellulose and glycerol gradient purification steps. However, primase activity was found to be less stable than DNA polymerase alpha activity under a variety of conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1591193929,"A substantial inhibition (50-70%) of GSH efflux by methionine was demonstrated in hepatocytes isolated from fed rats. Concurrent measurements of intracellular GSH revealed maintenance of a higher concentration in methionine-supplemented cells over the 1-h incubation. Analysis of total GSH suggested that maintenance of higher intracellular GSH by methionine could be quantitatively accounted for by inhibition of GSH efflux rather than by net GSH synthesis. This conclusion was supported by studies with propargylglycine, a potent inhibitor of cysteine synthesis from methionine. Identical results were obtained in incubations containing either propargylglycine and methionine or methionine alone, thereby suggesting that net synthesis of GSH from methionine was minimal under the assay conditions. Similar decreases (40-60%) in the rate of extracellular accumulation of GSH were observed with ethionine and buthionine, two higher homologs of methionine, but not with a wide range of other naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids. The inhibition of GSH efflux by methionine was not dependent on the presence of sodium in the medium and did not correlate with metabolic consumption of ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1500466538,"Gossypol, an aldehyde extracted from cotton plants, produces both general toxic and antifertility effects in mammals. The cellular mechanisms by which gossypol exerts these effects are not understood. In this study, we have characterized the interactions of gossypol with lipid monolayer and bilayer membranes in order to assess if the drug acts by modifying the electrochemical properties of membranes. The charged form of gossypol binds to monolayers of different lipid compositions with apparent dissociation constants ranging from 0.7 to 2 microM. Binding of charged gossypol decreases the interfacial potential by 80-235 mV, the magnitude of this decrease being dependent upon the lipid composition. Gossypol also induces a conductance in phospholipid bilayer membranes. The relation between steady-state bilayer conductance versus gossypol concentration indicates that the current-carrying species is a single molecule of gossypol. The increase in bilayer conductance is accompanied by an increase in proton permeability. These changes induced by gossypol in model membranes can account for the mitochondrial uncoupling effects of this molecule and may be responsible for the inhibitory effects of gossypol on several membrane transport systems."
https://openalex.org/W1943495716,"Abstract Further studies of mitochondrially bound hexokinase have been carried out in order to elucidate the mechanism first proposed to increase efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation by the acceptor effect (Bessman, S. P. (1954) in Fat Metabolism (Najjar, V., ed) pp. 133-137, Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore). During isolation of mitochondria, Mg2+ caused increased quantities of hexokinase to be bound or retained. This effect is concentration-dependent, saturable, and cannot be explained by Mg2+-linked activation or stabilization. Rebinding of hexokinase to isolated mitochondria also shows a similar dependence on Mg2+. When added to a homogenate made without it, Mg2+ could not bind the same amount of hexokinase to the mitochondria as could be observed when Mg2+ had been included in the homogenizing medium from the start. Using mitochondria prepared with Mg2+ in order to bind hexokinase to the largest extent possible, we have demonstrated that as in the case of mitochondrial creatine phosphokinase, a compartment exists that permits more efficient production of glucose 6-phosphate during mitochondrial respiration--the hexokinase acceptor effect. This effect probably results from a favorable positioning of the active site of hexokinase, perhaps within the intermembrane space, providing a diffusion-favorable situation. Thus, newly synthesized ATP transported through the inner membrane supplies substrate to hexokinase with greater efficiency than that of ATP which must pass through the outer membrane by diffusion from the medium. These observations lend support to proposals that in vivo modulation of the soluble particulate distribution of hexokinase by hormones or by metabolites may be physiologically necessary and important."
https://openalex.org/W1577087614,"Neutrophilic granulocytes contain an oxidase system in their plasma membrane that can be activated to generate superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide. Cytochrome b, flavoprotein, and ubiquinone-50 have been proposed as components of this oxidase system. These components have been quantitated, but the results are obscured by different isolation procedures for plasma membranes from resting and activated neutrophils. This problem has now been avoided by the use of enucleated neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocyte cytoplasts), which are almost completely devoid of intracellular structures but contain an intact, activatable oxidase system (Roos, D., Voetman, A.A., and Meerhof, L.J. (1983) J. Cell Biol. 97, 368-377). Membranes of resting and phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated cytoplasts contain equal amounts of cytochrome b (4 pmol/milliunit of alkaline phosphatase) and also equal amounts of noncovalently bound FAD (2 pmol/milliunit of alkaline phosphatase). These findings refute the hypothesis that incorporation of cytochrome b and/or a flavoprotein into the plasma membrane constitutes the mechanism of activation of the oxidase system. Ubiquinone-50 is present neither in intact neutrophils nor in cytoplasts, excluding a role for this compound in the generation of bactericidal oxygen species by neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W1537658354,"Chemically cross-linked actin trimer, prepared from F-actin covalently cross-linked by N-N'-p-phenylenebismaleimide, was used to nucleate the assembly of actin polymers under a variety of ionic conditions at 25 degrees C. Gel-filtered G-actin (5% labeled with N-pyrenyl iodoacetamide) was prepared in buffers containing 5 mM Tris X HCl, 0.2 mM ATP, 0.05 mM MgCl2 or 0.1 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.01% sodium azide, pH 7.5. Polymerization was initiated by adding salt to a solution of actin monomer (2-25 microM) mixed with actin trimer (0-24 nM). Pseudo-first-order polymerization kinetics were observed in all cases following a lag phase of 30-75 s. The length of the lag phase was independent of trimer concentration, monomer concentration, or preincubation of monomer or trimer in polymerizing buffer. A simple model is presented which explains all of the observed features of the lag phase. Lower limits for the sums of the elongation rate constants at the two filament ends, calculated assuming each trimer acts as a seed, were in the range 1.4-5.2 microM-1 s-1, and lower limits for the polymer dissociation rate constants (calculated from the elongation rate constants and the critical actin concentration) were 0.4-1.9 s-1, depending on ionic conditions. The observed rate constants were independent of actin concentration or trimer concentration under a given ionic condition. These polymerization rate constants are in good agreement with the values others have obtained by measuring the growth of actin filaments by electron microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W1601558468,"Disulfides (glutathione disulfide, cystine, cystamine) caused a first-order inactivation of rabbit-muscle fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase at pH values of 7.4 and above. Inactivation by glutathione disulfide was partially reversed by reducing agents, but the enzyme became irreversibly inactivated with time. The disulfide-inactivated aldolase had a lower transition temperature and enthalpy of denaturation than the native enzyme. In addition, the disulfide-inactivated enzyme was extensively degraded by proteinases, whereas the native enzyme was resistant. Mixed disulfides were formed; a maximum ratio of 4-5 mol of glutathione/mol of the aldolase tetramer was found. The number of titratable--SH groups on aldolase decreased by 16 (out of 32 total on the control enzyme) after inactivation by glutathione disulfide, indicating that other oxidation reactions in addition to those resulting in mixed disulfides occurred. The substrate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, prevented inactivation of aldolase by glutathione disulfide, the formation of glutathione-enzyme mixed disulfides, thermodynamic destabilization of the enzyme, and a decrease of--SH groups on the enzyme. These data indicate that covalent modification of aldolase by biological disulfides is important in modulating enzyme stability and vulnerability to proteinases as well as enzyme activity and that the substrate protects against modification by disulfides."
https://openalex.org/W2099111100,"The relative degradation of the various molecular species of [3H]phosphatidylcholine in response to thrombin was studied in human platelets following prelabeling with [3H]glycerol and compared to results obtained following labeling with [14C]oleic, [14C]linoleic, or [14C]arachidonic acids. This was of interest since previous work using radioactive fatty acids had led to the conclusion that the 1-acyl-2-arachidonoyl species of phosphatidylcholine is exclusively hydrolyzed in thrombin-stimulated platelets. Within 90 s, the thrombin-dependent release of [14C]arachidonic acid from phosphatidylcholine amounted to 25% but only 3 and 6% for oleic and linoleic acids, respectively, in general agreement with previous work. However, for [3H]glycerol-labeled phosphatidylcholine, all molecular species (saturates, monoenes, dienes, trienes, tetraenes, and greater than tetraenes) were subject to significant hydrolysis in the presence of thrombin within 90 s, ranging from 12-24% across the various classes. Furthermore, the degradation of the tetraenoic species (1-acyl-2-arachidonoyl) of [3H]phosphatidylcholine was found to be only 1.5 and 1.4 times that for the monoenoic (predominantly 1-acyl-2-oleoyl) and dienoic (predominantly 1-acyl-2-linoleoyl) species, respectively. A much heavier proportional labeling of plasma membrane relative to whole platelet phosphatidylcholine was observed with [3H]glycerol as compared to [14C] oleate or [14C]arachidonate. These results indicate that the 1-acyl-2-arachidonoyl species of phosphatidylcholine are not exclusively degraded by phospholipase A2 activity in thrombin-stimulated platelets and suggest that the differential compartmentation of molecular species of phosphatidylcholine according to their metabolic origins can influence their apparent susceptibility to hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1485723570,"Branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase is a multienzyme complex consisting of three catalytic components, i.e. branched-chain alpha-keto acid decarboxylase (E1), dihydrolipoyl transacylase (E2), and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3). In this report the E2 component of highly purified branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase from bovine kidney and liver was characterized with an independent radiochemical assay for this component. The assay uses the model reaction: R-14CO-S-CoA + Lip-(SH)2 in equilibrium R-14CO-S-Lip-SH + CoA-SH, which is similar to that catalyzed by the transacetylase component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. In this reaction, exogenous dihydrolipoamide substitutes for the protein (E2)-bound dihydrolipoyl moiety, and [1-14C]acyl-CoA synthesized enzymatically is the acyl-CoA substrate. The thioester structure of the reaction product, S-acyldihydrolipoamide, was identified by mass spectrometry, its characteristic absorption at 232-245 nm and by formation of hydroxamate with hydroxylamine. Rates of the E2-catalyzed transacylation reaction with various [1-14C]acyl-CoAs are in the order of [1-14C]isobutyryl-CoA greater than [1-14C] isovaleryl-CoA greater than [1-14C]acetyl-CoA. The activity with acetyl-CoA is 15% of that with isobutyryl-CoA. The E2 activity is strongly inhibited by arsenite. Modification of the covalently bound lipoyl moiety through reductive acylation in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide is without effect on the transacylation reaction. These data, along with results of initial velocity and product inhibition suggest that the model reaction proceeds via a random Bi Bi mechanism. Limited proteolysis of purified bovine liver branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase with trypsin results in complete loss of the overall activity catalyzed by the complex. Nonetheless the activity of the E2 component is not affected. The tryptic digestion cleaves E2 subunits (Mr = 52,600) into a major fragment of Mr = 25,700. By contrast, E1 alpha and E1 beta subunits of the complex are relatively resistant to proteolysis with trypsin. The results indicate that structural properties of the E2 component of branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase are similar but not identical to those of the transacetylase component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex."

We have isolated two, non-allelic delta-crystallin genes using a recombinant bacteriophage/chicken genomic DNA library. There appear to be only these two delta-crystallin genes in the haploid chicken genome. Southern hybridization and R-loop analyses indicate that the two genes are oriented on the chromosome with similar 5'-3' polarity. delta 1, arbitrarily designated as the directionally 5' of the two genes, is 6.7 kilobases in length, while delta 2 is 9.2 kilobases. The two delta-crystallin genes are about 4.2 kilobases apart. Structurally, both genes are arranged in a similar and characteristic pattern of 17 exons/16 introns, as judged by electron microscopy. The delta-crystallin gene locus represents a simple model for the study of structural co-evolution and/or functional co-expression of two related genes within a developmentally modulated region of the genome."
https://openalex.org/W1540293909,"The interactions of the apoenzyme of wheat germ pyruvate decarboxylase with thiamin diphosphate and with thiamin thiazolone diphosphate have been investigated. The results test hypotheses concerning the structure of the transition state for decarboxylation of the enzyme-bound adduct of pyruvate and thiamin diphosphate. Thiamin thiazolone diphosphate, a possible transition state analogue, binds to the apoenzyme by a two-step process. The first is slow and reversible (k = 200 M-1 s-1; K = 5 X 10(-7) M). The second step is irreversible (k = 1 X 10(-6) s-1). The rate constant for activation by thiamin diphosphate is 160 M-1 s-1. Thiamin diphosphate is released very slowly from the holoenzyme (k = 2 X 10(-5) s-1). Thiamin thiazolone diphosphate competitively inhibits activation of the apoenzyme by thiamin diphosphate, Ki = 2 X 10(-6) M. Km for thiamin diphosphate is only 3 times larger. Thiamin thiazolone is solvated preferentially to thiamin in 2-butanol, a medium whose polarity should resemble that of the binding site. It is concluded that the observed high affinity of thiamin thiazolone diphosphate for the apoenzyme is the result of a combination of effects which do not require the assumption that it is an analogue of the transition state for the decarboxylation of enzyme-bound 2-(2-lactyl) thiamin diphosphate."

The unit cell is hexagonal (space group P6122) with dimensions a = b = 65.4 A, c = 504 A, and contains four identical 13,400-dalton protomers in each of its 12 asymmetric units. The 504-A c axis required double focusing mirrors (Franks optics) to resolve the reflections. The complexity of the combined local and lattice symmetry necessitated direct methods to establish the positions of heavy atoms in even the simplest of the isomorphous derivatives. The electron density map clearly showed both (a) the elaborate packing scheme of protomers, which accounts for this large and complicated unit cell, and (b) the coarse features of the functional dimer. The steroid-binding site has been established by imaging the bound inhibitor, 4-acetoxymercuriestradiol, in a difference Fourier map. Each of the dimer's two steroid-binding sites lies completely within one subunit but close enough to the opposing subunit that functional interactions may be possible."
https://openalex.org/W1492580538,"The effect of binding enzymatically phosphorylated H1 histone on the structure of reconstituted chromatin was determined by circular dichroism and thermal denaturation studies at low ionic strength. Procedures were developed for the selective removal of the lysine-rich histones H1 and H5 from chicken erythrocyte chromatin (stripped chromatin) and for the specific reconstitution of chromatin, without nucleosome sliding. Reconstitution was carried out with either rat thymus H1, phosphorylated rat thymus H1 (containing an average of 5.3 phosphates/molecule, or chicken erythrocyte H5. The maximum ellipticity in 1.0 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, of stripped chromatin [( theta]282.5 = 4800 degree cm2/dmol) was effectively reduced to the value for native chromatin [( theta]282.5 = 3900 degree cm2/dmol) through reconstitution with approximately one molecule of either H1 [( theta]282.5 = 4050 degree cm2/dmol) or phosphorylated H1 [( theta]282.5 = 4100 degree cm2/dmol) per 200 base pairs of DNA. As the circular dichroic spectra for chromatin reconstituted with H1 and phosphorylated H1 are similar, it appears that phosphorylation per se does not induce a major structural alteration of chromatin structure. Thermal denaturation studies at low ionic strength of chromatin reconstituted with either H1 or phosphorylated H1 revealed a transition that occurs at a slightly lower temperature than the high temperature transition of native chromatin. This transition was shifted approximately 1 degree C to lower temperature when the chromatin was reconstituted with phosphorylated H1 as compared to H1. Thus, phosphorylation of H1 caused a significant destabilization of the chromatin structure at low ionic strength. When thermal denaturation was carried out on chromatin reconstituted with H5, native-like profiles were obtained."
https://openalex.org/W1570683194,"An in vitro system prepared from rat liver postmitochondrial supernatant exhibits a high rate of protein synthesis for an extended period of time. This system initiates translation of either endogenous or exogenous mRNA, incorporates Met at a rate of 13 pmol/mg of postmitochondrial supernatant protein/min, maintains this rate for at least 90 min, and performs several rounds of translation/mRNA molecule. Up to 50% of the activity is due to reinitiation of protein synthesis using endogenous mRNA. In addition, 60-70% of the protein synthesized was released from ribosomes into the medium. Addition of globin mRNA stimulates protein synthesis and results in the synthesis of a protein that comigrates with authentic rabbit globin. Black beetle virus mRNA 2 also stimulates protein synthesis and results in synthesis of a protein with molecular weight corresponding to that of the mature viral protein. With endogenous rat liver mRNA this system synthesizes a large number of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1507312664,"The major ganglioside from the roe of striped mullet (Mugil cephalus) has been isolated and purified. Compositional analysis of this ganglioside revealed that it contained an equimolar ratio of the following residues: N-acetylneuraminic acid, N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, glucose, and the long-chain base. Further structural studies by sequential enzymatic hydrolysis, permethylation analysis, and proton NMR spectroscopy indicated that the structure of the oligosaccharide moiety was identical to that of GM2 ganglioside from human brain: GalNAc beta 1----4Gal beta 1----4(3----2 alpha NeuAc)-Glc----ceramide. This ganglioside, however, differed from brain GM2 in its ceramide portion. The most striking differences are the presence of large amounts of C18 and C20 phytosphingosine (over 80% of the total long-chain bases) and the preponderance of monounsaturated alpha-hydroxy fatty acids (over 80%). Such a phytosphingosine-containing GM2 ganglioside has never been reported."
https://openalex.org/W1606419547,"The subcellular location of hexokinase was investigated in rat kidney. Both soluble and particulate locations are indicated by differential centrifugation. The particulate form is predominant, representing about 80% of the total activity. None of the activity is latent. Density gradient centrifugation followed by marker enzyme analysis reveals the presence of two populations of mitochondria with distinct densities. Hexokinase is associated primarily with the mitochondrial population having the lower density. Association of hexokinase with brush border, plasma membrane, lysosomes, and endoplasmic reticulum is considered unlikely on the basis of density gradient centrifugation and enzyme analysis. About 95% of the hexokinase activity associated with the mitochondrial fraction can be released in soluble form by repeated incubations with glucose 6-phosphate. An incubation time of about 4 min at 30 degrees C is required to achieve a maximal solubilizing effect. Release is accomplished without disrupting the mitochondrial compartments. Hexokinase is released also by treatment of the mitochondrial fraction with increasing concentrations of digitonin. This technique disrupts and differentially releases the mitochondrial compartments. As observed with liver, but in contrast to that observed with tumor (Parry, D. M., and Pedersen, P. L. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10904-10912), the release of hexokinase from the mitochondrial fraction of kidney does not correlate with the release of enzymes known to mark the mitochondrial membranes or compartments. These studies provide the first critical evidence about the subcellular location of hexokinase in kidney. They show that in this tissue hexokinase is associated primarily with low density mitochondria, a finding that adds credibility to the existence of this discrete population of mitochondria in vivo. Significantly, this association of hexokinase with kidney mitochondria appears unique in that its release on submitochondrial fractionation does not correlate with the release of known mitochondrial marker enzymes. These results are directly relevant to those cells in the kidney which utilize glucose as an energy source. It is suggested that the enhanced glycolytic capacity of these cells may be due, at least in part, to an association of hexokinase with low density mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1554021506,"Chinese hamster ovary cell lines that are 1000-fold more resistant to the threonyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitor borrelidin than the sensitive parental cells were isolated after stepwise selection for growth in increasing concentrations of the drug. These cells show a 10-20-fold increase in threonyl-tRNA synthetase activity. Quantitation of the amount of threonyl-tRNA synthetase protein by immunological techniques indicated a 60-100-fold increase compared to sensitive cells. No significant changes in the Km for substrates, inhibition by borrelidin or thermal stability were found for the threonyl-tRNA synthetase of resistant cells. These data suggest that the resistant cell lines may have amplified the gene encoding threonyl-tRNA synthetase, but no evidence of homogeneously staining regions or double minute chromosomes was found. The resistant cell lines should prove useful for the study of the regulation of threonyl-tRNA synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1576904077,"Several spectroscopic techniques are used to investigate the stoichiometry and properties of ATP complexes with lanthanide(III) (Ln(III)], ions. The ATP2-lanthanide(III) complex predominates at millimolar ATP levels and dissociates to the 1:1 complex with a Kd of 300 +/- 50 microM for the Eu(III) case. Two independent techniques, viz. field-dependent water proton relaxation for the Gd(III) complex and metal ion luminescence lifetime measurements for the Eu(III) complex, yield a value of approximately 2 for the number of water molecules coordinated to the metal ion. The latter technique yields an approximate metal-ion hydration number of 4 for the 1:1 complex. Dynamic properties of the Gd(III) X ATP2 complex including the temperature dependence of correlation times describing rotation of the complex and ATP exchange have been studied by field-dependent water-proton relaxation and by temperature-dependent 31P NMR relaxation studies. These data are consistent with formation of a 2:1 ATP-lanthanide complex at millimolar ATP concentrations. Other types of complexes are detected under conditions in which there is insufficient ATP to satisfy the 1:2 metal:nucleotide stoichiometry."
https://openalex.org/W1581713568,"The transmembrane equilibration of [3H]uridine was measured in human erythrocytes as a function of temperature using rapid kinetic techniques. Arrhenius plots of the maximum velocity of equilibrium exchange were continuous between 5 and 30 degrees C (Ea = 17-20 kcal/mol), but the increase in velocity with increase in temperature leveled off above 30 degrees C. This leveling off did not reflect heat inactivation of the carrier since transport activity was stable for 3 h at 37 degrees C. Transmembrane equilibration of uridine in equilibrium exchange and zero-trans modes at 5, 15, 25, and 35 degrees C conformed to appropriate integrated rate equations derived for the simple transporter. The nucleoside transporter exhibited directional symmetry, but the loaded carrier moved on the average 5 times more rapidly than the empty carrier at 15, 25, and 35 degrees C, but 25-40 times faster at 5 degrees C. This marked shift in differential mobility of loaded and empty carrier between 15 and 5 degrees C was entirely attributable to an impairment of mobility of empty carrier. The Michaelis-Menten constant for equilibrium exchange increased about 3-fold with increase in temperature between 5 and 35 degrees C. The van't Hoff plot of the values was approximately linear and yielded an estimate of the enthalpy of carrier:substrate dissociation of 7.8 kcal/mol."
https://openalex.org/W1579508640,"The effect of some organic solvents, in particular dimethyl sulfoxide, on oxidative phosphorylation, the Pi-ATP exchange reaction, and ATP hydrolysis has been studied in submitochondrial particles from bovine heart. The three reactions are inhibited by dimethyl sulfoxide, but with a different sensitivity. Oxidative phosphorylation takes place at considerable rates in the presence of concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide that completely inhibit the Pi-ATP exchange reaction. The sensitivity of the Pi-ITP exchange reaction to dimethyl sulfoxide measured in the presence of electron transport is also higher than that of oxidative phosphorylation. Dimethyl sulfoxide inhibits an electrochemical H+ gradient-dependent stimulating effect of inorganic phosphate on ATP hydrolysis which is linked to the Pi-ATP exchange reaction. In the absence of phosphate or in the presence of phosphate plus uncoupler, dimethyl sulfoxide does not inhibit hydrolysis. These findings, together with the observation that electron transport increases the rate of the Pi-ITP exchange reaction, suggest that electrochemical H+ gradients modify the kinetic characteristics of particulate Fi-ATPase. Glycerol and methanol, but not dimethylformamide, induce effects similar to those of dimethyl sulfoxide on oxidative phosphorylation and the Pi-ATP exchange reaction. This suggests that the described effects of solvents could be due to alterations of water structure."
https://openalex.org/W1627367796,"Beta-Lapachone, a derivative of 1,2-naphthoquinone, inhibits the specific binding of [6,7-3H]triamcinolone acetonide (TA) to unbound hepatic and thymic glucocorticoid receptors in a dose-dependent manner with 50% of the maximal inhibition in thymus cytosol achieved at a final concentration of 5-10 microM. Preincubation of cytosol with 10 mM Na2MoO4, which stabilizes unbound receptors, potentiates the subsequent beta-lapachone-mediated inhibitory activity, while preincubation with 1 or 10 mM dithiothreitol blocks the subsequent inhibition of [6,7-3H]TA binding. A double reciprocal plot indicates that beta-lapachone is a competitive inhibitor of [6,7-3H]TA binding with an apparent Ki of approximately 6 microM. The ability of beta-lapachone to displace prebound [6,7-3H]TA and the ability of elevated concentrations of [6,7-3H]TA to reverse the beta-lapachone-mediated inhibition are totally consistent with this kinetic interpretation. The ability of beta-lapachone to interact directly with the ligand-binding site is confirmed by the fact that this compound can block the binding of [6,7-3H]TA to highly purified unactivated hepatic glucocorticoid receptors. Although beta-lapachone may interact specifically with receptor sulfhydryl groups, this compound is not a general oxidizing agent which inactivates the essential free sulfhydryl groups at the glucocorticoid-binding site. Beta-Lapachone does not affect activation of [6,7-3H]TA-receptor complexes nor does it itself act like a glucocorticoid and facilitate receptor activation (transformation). Interestingly, this compound does not affect the ligand-binding sites of estrogen, progesterone, androgen, or mineralocorticoid receptors or serum transcortin. Thus, beta-lapachone can be utilized as a specific probe for the ligand-binding site of the glucocorticoid receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1569914639,"In the rat testis, 7 days after hypophysectomy, the microsomal content of cytochrome P-450 decreased to a negligible level. The sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of the microsomal preparation did not reveal a decrease in apocytochrome P-450; however, in this preparation, heme was undetectable. The latter did not reflect decreases in the activities of the heme biosynthesis enzymes. Also, an increase in heme oxygenase activity did not appear responsible for the suppression of the cytochrome levels. The cellular basis for the depression of the cytochrome was explored by measuring the incorporation of [14C]delta-aminolevulinate into the testicular microsomal and mitochondrial hemoproteins, and determining the relative affinity of microsomal heme for the endoplasmic reticulum membranes. In comparison with the sham-operated animals, in hypophysectomized rats, the specific 14C activity of heme in mitochondrial fraction was not decreased; however, that of the microsomal fraction was markedly reduced. The latter appeared to reflect a lowered binding affinity of the apoprotein moiety of cytochrome P-450 for heme. The treatment of hypophysectomized rats with human chorionic gonadotropin partially restored the normal level of the cytochrome. It is suggested that the anterior pituitary hormones control the level of cytochrome P-450 in the testis through factors which do not involve the production of heme; rather, the control appears to involve the processes of assembly of the hemoprotein and the association of the heme molecule with the apoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1607294005,"Crystals of the steroid-metabolizing enzyme, delta 5-3-ketosteroid isomerase (EC 5.3.3.1) from Pseudomonas testosteroni, exhibit many enzymatic properties. Each enzyme subunit in the lattice binds a competitive inhibitor, progesterone, with the same stoichiometry (1:1) and affinity (KD = 6 X 10(-6) M) as the enzyme in solution. Another competitive inhibitor, 19-nortestosterone, competes with progesterone for the same binding sites in the crystal. The enzyme crystals catalyze the conversion of delta 5- to delta 4-ketosteroids, but because the enzyme is so efficient, and substrate diffusion into the crystal is so slow, substrate cannot penetrate deeply into the crystal before being converted to product. A general theoretical formulation is presented to account for the effects of substrate diffusion into enzyme crystals of different shapes and sizes. The dependence of apparent mean enzyme activity in steroid isomerase crystals as a function of crystal size is shown to be consistent with this theoretical formulation. These inhibitor binding and catalytic properties suggest that the enzyme is in an active conformation within these crystals."
https://openalex.org/W1488866300,"The 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate and thioglycolate complexes of iron(III)-ovotransferrin have been studied with resonance Raman and extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopies, respectively, to obtain evidence for the coordination of the synergistic anion to the iron center. The dihydroxybenzoate complex exhibits resonance-enhanced Raman vibrations arising from both the endogenous tyrosinates and the added dihydroxybenzoate. A comparison of the extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectra of the carbonate and thioglycolate complexes shows a large feature at about 1.95 A assigned to Fe-(O,N) interactions. The latter complex exhibits an added feature at 2.32 A assigned to an Fe-S interaction. These experiments demonstrate that the Lewis base functions in the synergistic anions coordinate to the iron in ovotransferrin."
https://openalex.org/W1568304501,"The processing of type III and type I procollagen molecules in cultured bovine aortic smooth muscle cells was investigated. The molecular identities of the processing intermediates of type III and type I procollagen were characterized by analysis of the radioactive collagenous components using mammalian collagenase and pepsin digestions and cyanogen bromide peptide mapping. The results indicate that the processed intermediates for procollagen type III and type I are their respective pC components. Although the processing pathways for both collagen types are the same, data from pulse-chase experiments suggest that the rates at which the processing occurs are different. Type I procollagen is processed more rapidly to its intermediate than is type III procollagen. The type I pC intermediate is almost completely processed to alpha-chains and a significant portion of these fully processed molecules remains in a soluble form even after 11 h. In the same time period, the type III pC intermediate is slowly converted to alpha-chains. Since beta-aminopropionitrile was not employed in these studies, significant accumulation of collagen chains into the insoluble extracellular matrix was observed during the chase period."
https://openalex.org/W1566225771,"The lipoprotein lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of diacylphosphatidylcholines (PC) in mixed micelles of Triton X-100/PC was studied as a function of temperature in the presence and absence of apolipoprotein C-II (apo-C-II), the activator protein for lipoprotein lipase. Dilauroyl-, dimyristoyl-, dipalmitoyl-, and distearoyl-phosphatidylcholine (di-C12-PC, di-C14-PC, di-C16-PC, and di-C18-PC, respectively) were used as substrates. No systematic relationship between substrate fatty acyl chain length and either the rates of the activation energies for hydrolysis in the presence or absence of apo-C-II was observed. However, there was a linear relationship between fatty acyl chain length and both the logarithm of the activation factor (the ratio of enzyme activity with apo-C-II to that without apo-C-II) and the difference in activation energy in the presence and absence of apo-C-II. These relationships were not the result of an alteration in the physical form of the substrate, since a mixture of di-C14-PC and di-C16-PC gave activation factors for each PC which were the same as those obtained for each individual lipid. From the temperature dependence of the activation factor, thermodynamic functions of the apo-C-II-induced change in the reaction pathway were calculated. The free energy of activation decreased linearly with increasing chain length as the result of a linear increase in activation entropy which more than offset the unfavorable increase in activation enthalpy. We propose that the apo-C-II-mediated increase in the rate of the lipoprotein lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine is associated with transfer of a fatty acyl chain of the substrate or product to a more hydrophobic environment within the transition state complex."
