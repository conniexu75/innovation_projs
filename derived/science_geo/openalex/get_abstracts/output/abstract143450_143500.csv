https://openalex.org/W2061313736,"The rates at which lands in the United States were cleared for agriculture, abandoned, harvested for wood, and burned were reconstructed from historical data for the period 1700–1990 and used in a terrestrial carbon model to calculate annual changes in the amount of carbon stored in terrestrial ecosystems, including wood products. Changes in land use released 27 ± 6 petagrams of carbon to the atmosphere before 1945 and accumulated 2 ± 2 petagrams of carbon after 1945, largely as a result of fire suppression and forest growth on abandoned farmlands. During the 1980s, the net flux of carbon attributable to land management offset 10 to 30 percent of U.S. fossil fuel emissions."
https://openalex.org/W2132403739,"Recent works have shown the importance of reduction/oxidation (redox) regulation in various biological phenomena. Thioredoxin (TRX) is one of the major components of the thiol reducing system and plays multiple roles in cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, and gene expression. To investigate the molecular mechanism of TRX action, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to identify TRX-binding proteins. One of the candidates, designated as thioredoxin-binding protein-2 (TBP-2), was identical to vitamin D3 up-regulated protein 1 (VDUP1). The association of TRX with TBP-2/VDUP1 was observed in vitro and in vivo. TBP-2/VDUP1 bound to reduced TRX but not to oxidized TRX nor to mutant TRX, in which two redox active cysteine residues are substituted by serine. Thus, the catalytic center of TRX seems to be important for the interaction. Insulin reducing activity of TRX was inhibited by the addition of recombinant TBP-2/VDUP1 protein in vitro. In COS-7 and HEK293 cells transiently transfected with TBP-2/VDUP1 expression vector, decrease of insulin reducing activity of TRX and diminishment of TRX expression was observed. These results suggested that TBP-2/VDUP1 serves as a negative regulator of the biological function and expression of TRX. Treatment of HL-60 cells with 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 caused an increase of TBP-2/VDUP1 expression and down-regulation of the expression and the reducing activity of TRX. Therefore, the TRX-TBP-2/VDUP1 interaction may be an important redox regulatory mechanism in cellular processes, including differentiation of myeloid and macrophage lineages.

TRX has two redox-active cysteine residues in its consensus sequence (Trp-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys) and serves as a general disulfide oxido-reductase. The two cysteine residues can be reversibly oxidized to form a disulfide bond and reduced by the action of TRX reductase and NADPH (3Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9113-9119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TRX catalyzes the reduction of disulfide bonds in multiple substrate proteins. The TRX system (TRX, TRX reductase, and NADPH) is widely conserved in almost all species from bacteria to higher eukaryotes and has a wide variety of biological functions. TRX was originally identified as a hydrogen donor of ribonucleotide reductase in Escherichia coli (4Laurent T.C. Moore E.C. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3436-3444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is an essential protein subunit of the phage T7 DNA polymerase complex (5Mark D.F. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 780-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The simultaneous deletion of two TRX genes ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae prolonged the cell cycle (6Muller E.G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9194-9202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TRX homologue gene of Drosophila was identified as a gene in the deadhead locus, which is required for female meiosis and early embryonic development (7Salz H.K. Flickinger T.W. Mittendorf E. Pellicena-Palle A. Petschek J.P. Albrecht E.B. Genetics. 1994; 136: 1075-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the human system, TRX has been cloned as adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor, produced by human T-cell leukemia virus-I-transformed T-cells, or as interleukin-1-like factor from Epstein-Barr virus transformed cells (8Wollman E.E. d'Auriol L.

TRX expression seems essential for early development of the mouse embryo, because targeted disruption of the mouse TRX gene caused early embryonic lethality (14Matsui M. Oshima M. Oshima H. Takaku K. Maruyama T. Yodoi J. Taketo M.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence has indicated the importance of the regulation of reduction and oxidation (redox regulation) in various biological phenomena (15Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The TRX system and the glutathione system constitute major thiol reducing systems (16Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reduced condition is preferable for DNA binding activity of various transcriptional factors such as AP-1 (17Abate C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4035-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). TRX plays an important role in the regulation of protein-nucleic acid interactions through the redox regulation of cysteine residue(s) (22Matthews J.R. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J.L. Yodoi J. Hay R.T.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The direct physical association between TRX and redox factor-1/AP-endonuclease has been demonstrated to play a key role in the AP-1 transcriptional activity (23Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 24Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Cellular redox status is also important in the regulation of apoptosis (25Kroemer G. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 44-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 26Ueda S. Nakamura H. Masutani H. Sasada T. Yonehara S. Takabayashi A. Yamaoka Y. Yodoi J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6689-6695PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, TRX has been isolated using a yeast two-hybrid system as a binding protein of a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) (27Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the molecular mechanism of TRX-dependent redox regulation in mammalian cells, we have identified TRX-binding proteins. A TRX-binding protein designated as thioredoxin-binding protein-2 (TBP-2) is identical to vitamin D3 up-regulated protein 1 (VDUP1). VDUP1 was originally reported as an up-regulated gene in HL-60 cells treated with 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (28Chen K.S. DeLuca H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Although several homologous sequences of VDUP1 from mammalian species have been reported, the function of VDUP1 remains unclear. In this paper, we report how TBP-2/VDUP1 interacts with TRX and modulates the function and the expression of TRX in vitro and in vivo. Standard methods were used for DNA and RNA manipulations (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). TRX mutant C32S/C35S, which lacks reducing activity, was made by substituting two redox-active cysteine residues for serine residues (24Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 30Kallis G.B. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10261-10265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A cDNA of TRX or TRX C32S/C35S was fused in-frame to pGBT9 (CLONTECH) or pGEX4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). TRX cDNA fragment was excised byEcoRI from λgt10-TRX vector and ligated into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) (9Tagaya Y. Maeda Y. Mitsui A. Kondo N. Matsui H. Hamuro J. Brown N. Arai K. Yokota T. Wakasugi H. Yodoi J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). pACT-cl.13 and pACT-cl.29 were isolated from positive colonies of yeast two-hybrid screening and contained partial coding sequences of TBP-2. The open reading frame of the TBP-2/VDUP1 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′-GGAATTCGATGGTGATGTTCAAGAAGATC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCACTGACAATTGTTGTTGA-3′. To prepare protein expression vectors, the TBP-2/VDUP1 open reading frame was ligated in-frame to pGADGH (CLONTECH), pcDNA3.1/His B (Invitrogen), pGEX4T-3, pRSET B (Invitrogen), or pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH). pcDNA3.1/His B-lacZ was purchased from Invitrogen. The two-hybrid library screening was performed using the yeast MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system (CLONTECH) and human lymphocyte MATCHMAKER cDNA library (B-cell population of Epstein-Barr virus-transformed peripheral blood lymphocytes, CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. pGBT9-TRX was used as the bait plasmid. Plasmids were introduced to yeast strains HF7c or SFY526 by a polyethylene glycol/lithium acetate method (31Bartel P. Chien C.T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 920-924PubMed Google Scholar, 32Feilotter H.E. Hannon G.J. Ruddell C.J. Beach D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1502-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Colonies were grown on selective synthetic medium and were tested for histidine prototrophy or β-galactosidase activity using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. The λZAP II human placenta cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled DNA probes derived from theXhoI fragment of pACT-cl.29. Positive plaques were phagemid-rescued by VCSM13 helper phage (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instruction. A 2.9-kilobase pair cDNA in pBluescript was sequenced on both strands. In vitrotranslated proteins were prepared using a TNT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte translation system (Promega) and [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bacterially expressed His6-tagged recombinant protein was prepared under denaturing conditions according to the instructions provided in the QIAexpressionist booklet (Qiagen). E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS transformed with pRSET-TBP-2/VDUP1 was treated for 4 h with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. His6-tagged protein was purified by use of a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were prepared as follows: E. coli strain XL1 Blue MRF′ transformed with each pGEX expression vector was treated for 4 h with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Pelleted cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors (2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin) by sonication. After centrifugation, supernatants were applied to glutathione Sepharose CL-6B columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST fusion proteins were either eluted with the above buffer containing 10 mm reduced glutathione or immobilized on the beads and stored at −80 °C. Recombinant TRX was produced and provided by Ajinomoto Co. Inc. (Basic Research Laboratory, Kawasaki, Japan) (33Mitsui A. Hirakawa T. Yodoi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 1220-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Anti-TBP-2/VDUP1 antibody was prepared by immunization of bacterially expressed His6-TBP-2/VDUP1 protein as described before (14Matsui M. Oshima M. Oshima H. Takaku K. Maruyama T. Yodoi J. Taketo M.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The immune serum was further purified by affinity columns coupled with the GST-TBP-2/VDUP1 protein and protein A Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (34Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Anti-human TRX monoclonal antibodies (TRX-11 mAb and 21 mAb) were produced and provided by Fujirebio (Tokyo, Japan). These antibodies recognize different sites of TRX, respectively (35Kogaki H. Fujiwara Y. Yoshiki A. Kitajima S. Tanimoto T. Mitsui A. Shimamura T. Hamuro J. Ashihara Y. J. Clin. Lab. Anal. 1996; 10: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen) is a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the amino acid sequence Asp-Leu-Tyr-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys, which is contained in the N terminus of His6-tagged protein that was expressed with pcDNA3.1/His. COS-7 and HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical) with heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.); HL-60 and Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum. COS-7 and HEK293 cells were transfected with Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. After 24 h of transfection, cells were harvested and used for further studies. For the HL-60 differentiation, cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/ml and treated with 100 nm calcitriol (1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, Wako Pure Chemical Ind.) for 3 days. In vitro translated proteins were diluted with Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. For immunoprecipitation, after preclearing by use of protein G-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), samples were incubated with antibody for 2 h and with protein G-Sepharose for an additional 20 min at 4 °C. For in vitro binding assay using GST fusion protein, samples were incubated with GST fusion protein. Then samples were centrifuged and washed five times with Nonidet P-40 buffer. The precipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. The anti-human TRX monoclonal antibody (TRX-11 mAb) and mouse IgG1 (MOPC21, Sigma) were covalently coupled to Affi-Gel 10 beads (Bio-Rad), according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were washed and lysed with Nonidet P-40 buffer containing protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Then 10 mg of lysate was applied to each antibody column. Proteins were eluted with 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.5. Eluted samples were neutralized with 110 volume of 1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and dialyzed with 50 mmammonium acetate, pH 7.5. Samples were concentrated by evaporation and subjected to Western blotting analysis. GST-TRX was treated with reducing/oxidizing reagents according to previous report (27Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar). Breifly, GST-TRX immobilized on the beads was treated with Nonidet P-40 buffer containing reducing/oxidizing reagents for 15 min at room temperature. Treated beads were centrifuged and washed five times with degassed Nonidet P-40 buffer by batch method. Then in vitrotranslated TBP-2/VDUP1 protein was diluted with Nonidet P-40 buffer and added to the treated beads. After incubation for 2 h, samples were centrifuged and washed five times with Nonidet P-40 buffer. The precipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Cell extracts were prepared with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 1.0% sodium deoxycolate, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed as described previously (36Sasada T. Iwata S. Sato N. Kitaoka Y. Hirota K. Nakamura K. Nishiyama A. Taniguchi Y. Takabayashi A. Yodoi J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2268-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Total RNA from cultured cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Electrophoresis and Northern blotting were performed as described previously (37Maruyama T. Kitaoka Y. Sachi Y. Nakanoin K. Hirota K. Shiozawa T. Yoshimura Y. Fujii S. Yodoi J. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1997; 3: 989-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To estimate the reducing activity of TRX, insulin reducing assay was performed according to a previous report (36Sasada T. Iwata S. Sato N. Kitaoka Y. Hirota K. Nakamura K. Nishiyama A. Taniguchi Y. Takabayashi A. Yodoi J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2268-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. In our assay, yeast TRX reductase was used and was able to reduce recombinant human TRX. Yeast TRX reductase was provided by Oriental Yeast Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). The decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was recorded by use of a THERMOMAX micro plate reader (Molecular Devices) to detect maximal NADPH consumption rate (Vmax, millioptical density at 340 nm/min). As a control, samples were incubated with the reaction mixture without insulin. Each value was calculated according to a method previously reported (36Sasada T. Iwata S. Sato N. Kitaoka Y. Hirota K. Nakamura K. Nishiyama A. Taniguchi Y. Takabayashi A. Yodoi J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2268-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We used the yeast two-hybrid system to clone genes encoding TRX-binding protein using a cDNA library of B cell population of Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human peripheral blood lymphocyte. Among approximately 1.8 × 106 yeast transformants screened, nine colonies showed histidine prototrophy and β-galactosidase activity. Isolated plasmids were classified by restriction enzyme excision or DNA sequencing into three groups that were designated as thioredoxin-binding proteins. Because double transformants with pGBT-TRX and each plasmid belonging to one group, TBP-2, showed strongly positive phenotypes of histidine prototrophy and β-galactosidase activity, we chose TBP-2 for further study (Fig. 1). Data base searching of pACT-cl.29 revealed that TBP-2 has homology with TRT407–2 and vitamin D3 up-regulated protein 1 (VDUP1). TRT407–2 was reported as a gene screened by an RNA fingerprinting method in mink Mv1Lu cells (38McClelland M. Ralph D. Cheng R. Welsh J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4419-4431Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and VDUP1 was reported as an up-regulated gene in HL-60 cells treated with 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (28Chen K.S. DeLuca H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Another candidate (TBP-1) was identical to human p40 phox, a cytosolic phagocyte oxidase component (39Nishiyama A. Ohno T. Iwata S. Matsui M. Hirota K. Masutani H. Nakamura H. Yodoi J. Immunol. Lett. 1999; 68: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We attempted to clone the full-length cDNA of TBP-2 for further study. To isolate the full-length cDNA of TBP-2, a human placenta cDNA library was screened, using probes derived from the insert DNA of pACT-cl.29. DNA sequencing analysis of isolated 2.9-kilobase pair cDNA revealed that TBP-2 was identical to VDUP1. To examine the interaction between TRX protein and TBP-2/VDUP1 protein, anin vitro binding assay was performed.35S-Labeled proteins were prepared by in vitrotranslation. 35S-Labeled His6-TBP-2/VDUP1 protein was co-immunoprecipitated with TRX by anti-TRX monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 2A,lane 1) but not by control mouse IgG1 (Fig. 2A,lane 2). 35S-Labeled His6-β-galactosidase protein was not co-immunoprecipitated with TRX (Fig. 2A, lane 3). In addition, 35S-labeled TRX was co-immunoprecipitated within vitro translated His6-TBP-2/VDUP1 protein by anti-Xpress antibody but not by control mouse IgG1 (Fig. 2B). We then analyzed whether TRX interacts with TBP-2/VDUP1 in vivo. Cell lysates from human Jurkat cells were applied to an affinity column of either anti-TRX monoclonal antibody or control IgG1. Eluted proteins were subjected to Western blotting analysis with affinity purified anti-TBP-2/VDUP1 antibody. TBP-2/VDUP1 was detected in eluates from the anti-TRX antibody column (Fig. 2C,lane 1) but not from the control IgG1 column (lane 2). Therefore, these results demonstrated the interaction of TRX with TBP-2/VDUP1 in vitro and in vivo. Because TRX is a redox active protein, we next tested whether TRX-TBP-2/VDUP1 interaction is influenced by the redox status of TRX. GST-fused TRX was pretreated with reducing/oxidizing reagent, dithiothreitol, hydrogen peroxide, or diamide (a sulfhydryl-specific oxidant) and subjected to an in vitro binding assay. Whereas the TRX-TBP-2/VDUP1 interaction was unaffected by treatment with dithiothreitol, the interaction was markedly inhibited by treatment with hydrogen peroxide or diamide, suggesting that the reduced form of TRX is critically important for the interaction (Fig. 3). To examine whether TRX-TBP-2/VDUP1 interaction requires intact redox active sites of TRX, we used mutant TRX C32S/C35S in which redox active cysteine residues are substituted to serine residues. In an in vitro binding assay, 35S-labeled His6-TBP-2/VDUP1 protein was co-precipitated with GST-TRX but not with GST-TRX C32S/C35S (Fig. 4A). Using a yeast two-hybrid system to test the interaction in vivo, S. cerevisiae strain HF7c was transformed with pGADGH-TBP-2/VDUP1 and either pGBT9-TRX or pGBT9-TRX C32S/C35S. Transformed colonies of pGBT9-TRX grew well on synthetic medium lacking histidine, whereas transformed colonies of pGBT9-TRX C32S/C35S failed to grow (Fig. 4B). These data showed that these redox active cysteine residues are required for the TRX-TBP-2/VDUP1 interaction. TRX has a disulfide reducing activity and cleaves a disulfide bond in substrates such as insulin. We examined the effect of TBP-2/VDUP1 on TRX activity by the insulin reducing assay (36Sasada T.

In our experiments, yeast TRX reductase was used and was able to reduce recombinant human TRX (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5, a significant decrease of the reducing activity of TRX was observed in cellular extracts of COS-7 or HEK293 cells transiently transfected with a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused TBP-2/VDUP1 protein expression vector (Fig. 5A), in comparison with those of cells transfected with a GFP expression vector (Fig. 5A,lane 1). Similar results were obtained in experiments using His6-TBP-2/VDUP1 expression vector (data not shown). To confirm the inhibitory effect of TBP-2/VDUP1 on the reducing activity of TRX, we tested recombinant GST-TBP-2/VDUP1 protein in the insulin reducing assay. The reducing activity of TRX was repressed to less than 50% by the addition of 1 μm GST-TBP-2/VDUP1 protein, indicating that TBP-2/VDUP1 protein inhibits the disulfide reducing activity of TRX in vitro (Fig. 5B). We examined the effect of TBP-2/VDUP1 on TRX expression. As shown in Fig. 6, Western blotting analysis demonstrated that expression of TRX protein was significantly down-regulated in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with GFP-TBP-2/VDUP1 expression vector (Fig. 6). Similar results were obtained in experiments using His6-TBP-2/VDUP1 expression vector (data not shown). Thus, TBP-2/VDUP1 protein down-regulated TRX protein expression as well. Because TBP-2/VDUP1 was originally reported as an up-regulated gene in 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 treatment in HL-60 cells (28Chen K.S. DeLuca H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), we analyzed TBP-2/VDUP1 and TRX expression in the differentiation of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-induced HL-60 cells. There was a gradual increase of TBP-2/VDUP1 mRNA after treatment with 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (Fig. 7A). After 72 h, the TBP-2/VDUP1 mRNA was enhanced 9-fold over that before the treatment. In contrast, 72 h after the treatment, the TRX mRNA level markedly declined to less than 20% compared with that before the treatment. This inverted expression pattern was also observed in protein expression. The expression of TBP-2/VDUP1 protein was enhanced after treatment of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (Fig. 7B). In contrast, 48 h after the treatment, the amount of TRX protein was reduced to half of that before treatment (Fig. 7B). We then analyzed the reducing activity of TRX in HL-60 cells treated with 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Insulin reducing activity of the cell lysates decreased to 70% of the control value within 24 h and to 60% by 72 h (Fig. 8). Thus, TRX expression and its reducing activity were down-regulated in HL-60 cells treated with 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, whereas TBP-2/VDUP1 expression was up-regulated.Figure 8The reducing activity of TRX in HL-60 cells treated with 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Cell extracts (10 μg) of HL-60 cells treated with 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were collected at indicated hours. The TRX activities were determined by use of the insulin reducing assay. Activities for samples are shown relative toVmax of control (0 h), which is assigned as 100%. Data shown are representative of two-independent experiments. The results are the means ± S.D. of three samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In our search for interacting molecules with TRX, we isolated VDUP1 as a TBP-2 using a yeast two-hybrid system. We characterized TBP-2/VDUP1 as a TRX-binding protein. The interaction was dependent on the redox status of TRX. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of TBP-2/VDUP1 on the reducing activity of TRX and the expression was observed in TBP-2/VDUP1-overexpressed cells as well as HL-60 cells treated with 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. VDUP1 was originally reported as an up-regulated gene in HL-60 cells stimulated by 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (28Chen K.S. DeLuca H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The function of VDUP1 is still unclear, although several homologous sequences from mammalian species have been reported. The rat VDUP1 homologue was isolated as a down-regulated gene byN-methyl-N-nitrosourea in rat mammary tumor (41Young L.H. Yang X. Voigt J.M. Mol. Carcinogen. 1996; 15: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). There are two transcripts homologous to VDUP1, TRT407–2 and TRT407–9, whose expressions were induced by cycloheximide and repressed by transforming growth factor-β in mink Mv1Lu cells (38McClelland M. Ralph D. Cheng R. Welsh J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4419-4431Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The interaction of TRX with TBP-2/VDUP1 was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. TRX treated with oxidizing reagents was incapable of binding with TBP-2/VDUP1. It should be noted that the effect of oxidizing reagents was detectable at a low concentration (10 μm), in which aggregation of TRX was avoided (42Sato N. Iwata S. Nakamura K. Hori T. Mori K. Yodoi J. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3194-3203PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, only the reduced form of TRX appears to interact with TBP-2/VDUP1. There is a possibility that the presence of unreacted reagents has effects on the interaction between TRX and TBP-2/VDUP1. However, it seems unlikely because the GST-TRX beads used in the experiments were intensively washed after treatment with reducing/oxidizing reagents. In addition, the interaction was hardly inhibited by direct addition of the low concentration (10 μm) of reducing/oxidizing reagents to the TRX and TBP-2/VDUP1 reaction mixture. 2A. Nishiyama and J. Yodoi, unpublished data. Therefore, TRX-TBP-2/VDUP1 interaction appears highly dependent on the redox status of TRX. In addition, we used substituted TRX to analyze the involvement of the active site of TRX in the interaction with TBP-2/VDUP1. TRX C32S/C35S was not able to interact with TBP-2/VDUP1 either in the in vitro binding assay or the yeast two-hybrid system. These results strongly suggest that the TRX active site is important for the TRX-TBP-2/VDUP1 interaction. Analysis of the crystal structure of TRX has indicated that the active-site conformation of TRX C32S/C35S is very similar to that of oxidized TRX (43Weichsel A. Gasdaska J.R. Powis G. Montfort W.R. Structure. 1996; 4: 735-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Thus, the incapability of the TRX C32S/C35S and oxidized TRX to interact with TBP-2/VDUP1 does not seem to be caused by a large scale conformational change. In addition, TBP-2/VDUP1 inhibited TRX activity in insulin reducing assay. If TBP-2/VDUP1 is a substrate for TRX, inhibitory effect was not observed in insulin reducing assay. Our result suggests that TBP-2/VDUP1 is not a substrate for TRX. Therefore, interaction of TRX with TBP-2/VDUP1 may be a direct protein-protein interaction manner. Physical interactions of TRX with other proteins have been reported. TRX has been isolated as an ASK1-binding protein using a yeast two-hybrid system (27Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar). TRX directly binds to ASK1 and inhibits the apoptosis signal conducted by ASK1. These results suggest that the direct protein-protein interaction of TRX with its binding protein may be a basic mechanism of the redox regulation of cellular processes. In the TBP-2/VDUP1-overexpressed cells, decrease of the reducing activity of TRX was observed. This result raised the possibility that TBP-2/VDUP1 affects enzymatic action of TRX or TRX expression. Therefore, we examined the effect of TBP-2/VDUP1 on insulin reducing activity of TRX and TRX protein expression. The insulin reducing assay using recombinant GST-TBP-2/VDUP1 protein clearly demonstrated the inhibitory effect of TBP-2/VDUP1 on the reducing activity of TRX. Structural interference caused by GST seems unlikely, because experiments using cell lysates transfected with His6-TBP-2/VDUP1 expression vector also showed the decreased TRX activity. Although recombinant TBP-2/VDUP1 protein demonstrated an inhibitory effect, the effect was not complete, probably because the TBP-2/VDUP1 protein concentration was insufficient. Additionally, suppression of TRX protein expression was observed in cells transiently transfected with TBP-2/VDUP1 expression vector. In addition to its inhibitory effect, TBP-2/VDUP1 may be involved in TRX protein expression, and the interaction of TBP-2/VDUP1 with TRX might be required for the suppression mechanism of TRX expression. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that TBP-2/VDUP1 inhibits the redox-regulatory action of TRX. We observed the decrease of TRX expression and the reducing activity in HL-60 cells treated with 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 whose TBP-2/VDUP1 expression was enhanced as described in a previous report (28Chen K.S. DeLuca H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). An intriguing possibility is that up-regulation of TBP-2/VDUP1 expression is involved in the decrease of TRX expression and reducing activity. The decrease of TRX mRNA also was observed in HL-60 cells treated with 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. 1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 treatment or action of TBP-2/VDUP1 may be involved in the decrease of TRX mRNA. This inverted pattern of TRX and TBP-2/VDUP1 expression also was observed in cell cycle-synchronized cells.2 The suppression mechanism of TRX expression in HL-60 cells treated with 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and the involvement of TBP-2/VDUP1 should be further analyzed. 1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 is an essential biologically active molecule and is important for regulation of calcium homeostasis and secretion of hormone (44Suda T. Shinki T. Takahashi N. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1990; 10: 195-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 45Darwish H. DeLuca H.F. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 89-116PubMed Google Scholar). 1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 also is a potent inducer of myeloid leukemic cell differentiation (46Miyaura C. Abe E. Kuribayashi T.

Haussler M.R. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) and can inhibit the growth of cancer cells from several different tissues (48Frampton R.J. Omond S.A. Eisman J.A. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 4443-4447PubMed Google Scholar, 49Dokoh S. Donaldson C.A. Haussler M.R. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 2103-2109PubMed Google Scholar). TRX has been reported to have cell-growth promoting effects (12Wakasugi N. Tagaya Y. Wakasugi H. Mitsui A. Maeda M. Yodoi J. Tursz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8282-8286Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 13Gasdaska J.R. Berggren M. Powis G. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1643-1650PubMed Google Scholar), although TRX is involved in growth inhibitory mechanism in some system (50Deiss L.P. Kimchi A. Science. 1991; 252: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Human TRX was discovered as adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor from human T-cell lymphotropic virus-I transformed T-cells (9Tagaya Y. Maeda Y. Mitsui A. Kondo N. Matsui H. Hamuro J. Brown N. Arai K. Yokota T. Wakasugi H. Yodoi J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of TRX expression has been observed in some human tumors (51Fujii S. Nanbu Y. Nonogaki H. Konishi I. Mori T. Masutani H. Yodoi J. Cancer. 1991; 68: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 52Nakamura H. Masutani H. Tagaya Y. Yamauchi A. Inamoto T. Nanbu Y. Fujii S. Ozawa K. Yodoi J. Cancer. 1992; 69: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In addition, TRX transfected cells exhibited severalfold increased colony formation in soft agarose, whereas a redox-inactive mutant TRX C32S/C35S acts in a dominant negative manner to inhibit proliferation (53Gallegos A. Gasdaska J.R. Taylor C.W. Paine-Murrieta G.D. Goodman D. Gasdaska P.Y. Berggren M. Briehl M.M. Powis G. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5765-5770PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, the decrease of TRX function due to the TRX-TBP2/VDUP1 interaction may be one of the mechanisms through which 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 exerts its growth inhibitory effect (54Yang X. Young L.H. Voigt J.M. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 48: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we identified TBP-2/VDUP1 as a new TRX-binding protein. Stable interaction of TRX with TBP-2/VDUP1 was detected in vitro and in vivo. TBP-2/VDUP1 had an inhibitory effect on TRX-dependent reducing activity. Suppression of TRX protein expression also was observed in cells transfected with TBP-2/VDUP1 expression vector. Our results suggest the possibility that TBP-2/VDUP1 acts as an endogenous negative regulator of TRX, although the precise mechanism of this regulation is not clear yet. TRX-TBP-2/VDUP1 interaction may play an important role in the redox regulation of various cellular processes such as growth and differentiation of the cells sensitive to a variety of inducers, including 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 responses.

https://openalex.org/W2027516050,Rayleigh scattering off a Bose-Einstein condensate was studied. Exposing an elongated condensate to a single off-resonant laser beam resulted in the observation of highly directional scattering of light and atoms. This collective light scattering is caused by the coherent center-of-mass motion of the atoms in the condensate. A directional beam of recoiling atoms was built up by matter wave amplification.
https://openalex.org/W2090551359,"We measured the insulin-stimulated amount of Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3 enzymatic activities in four breast cancer cell lines and three prostate cancer cell lines. In the estrogen receptor-deficient breast cancer cells and the androgen-insensitive prostate cells, the amount of Akt3 enzymatic activity was approximately 20–60-fold higher than in the cells that were estrogen- or androgen-responsive. In contrast, the levels of Akt1 and -2 were not increased in these cells. The increase in Akt3 enzyme activity correlated with an increase in both Akt3 mRNA and protein. In a prostate cancer cell line lacking the tumor suppressor PTEN (a lipid and protein phosphatase), the basal enzymatic activity of Akt3 was constitutively elevated and represented the major active Akt in these cells. Finally, reverse transcription-PCR was used to examine the Akt3 expression in 27 primary breast carcinomas. The expression levels of Akt3 were significantly higher in the estrogen receptor-negative tumors in comparison to the estrogen receptor-positive tumors. To see if the increase in Akt3 could be due to chromosomal abnormalities, the Akt3 gene was assigned to human chromosome 1q44 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and radiation hybrid cell panel analyses. These results indicate that Akt3 may contribute to the more aggressive clinical phenotype of the estrogen receptor-negative breast cancers and androgen-insensitive prostate carcinomas.

Akt (also called protein kinase B) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that has been implicated in mediating a variety of biological responses including inhibiting apoptosis and stimulating cellular growth (reviewed in Ref. 1Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). There are three mammalian isoforms of this enzyme, Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3 (1Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Akt1 was found to be the cellular homolog of a viral oncogene (v-Akt) that causes leukemia in mice (2Staal S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5034-5037Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Further confirming the oncogenic potential of Akt, Akt1 was found to be overexpressed in 20% of gastric adenocarcinomas, and Akt2 was overexpressed in 3% of breast cancers, 15% of ovarian cancers, and 12% of pancreatic cancers because of gene amplification (2Staal S.P.

Moreover, recent studies have documented that the tumor suppressor called PTEN or MMAC1 is actually a lipid phosphatase that can dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (5Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar). Since this lipid is one of the primary activators of Akt (1Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar), loss of PTEN results in a high basal activity of Akt in a variety of tumors including glioblastomas and prostate cancer lines, while reintroduction of PTEN suppresses Akt activity (6Stambolic V.

Finally, much of the ability of PTEN to regulate the cell cycle and induce apoptosis appears to be mediated via its ability to regulate Akt enzymatic activity (6Stambolic V.

Haga T. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), little information has been reported on this isoform. Like Akt1 and Akt2, Akt3 contains a pleckstrin homology domain, which is highly homologous to those of Akt1 and -2 and presumably binds phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and is involved in activation of this enzyme (13Konishi H. Kuroda S. Tanaka M. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Also, like these other isoforms, Akt3 contains a threonine residue in the same region as a critical regulatory phosphorylation site present in the activation loop of Akt1 and -2 and is phosphorylated by the same enzyme, PDK1, that phosphorylates this site in the other isoforms (14Walker K.S. Deak M. Paterson A. Hudson K. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; : 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Unlike Akt1 and -2, Akt3 was initially reported to lack the second critical regulatory phosphorylation site in its carboxy tail (13Konishi H. Kuroda S. Tanaka M. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), although this has now been questioned (15Brodbeck D. Cron P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol.

Commun. 1999; 257: 906-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In addition, its tissue distribution appears to be more limited than that of Akt1 and -2, being primarily expressed in brain and testis (13Konishi H. Kuroda S. Tanaka M. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we have examined the levels of Akt3 in both breast cancer and prostate cancer cell lines. We find that both the Akt3 enzymatic activity and mRNA are elevated in breast cancer cell lines and tumors that lack the estrogen receptor (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR; FISH, fluorescence in situ hybridization; HA, hemagglutinin. as well as in prostate cancer cell lines that are androgen-insensitive. These results indicate that Akt3 may contribute to the more aggressive clinical phenotype of these hormone-unresponsive breast and prostate carcinomas (17Chevallier B. Heintzmann F. Mosseri V.

A monoclonal anti-Akt1 antibody and a sheep anti-Akt3 antibody were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), respectively. Protein A-Sepharose and protein G-Sepharose were from Repligen (Cambridge, MA) and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, respectively. The pECE construct coding the HA-tagged human Akt1 was as described (24Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The pECE constructs encoding FLAG-tagged rat Akt2 and FLAG-tagged rat Akt3 (13Konishi H. Kuroda S. Tanaka M. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C, in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were transfected using FuGene6 with 1 μg of plasmid DNA (HA-tagged Akt1-pECE, FLAG-tagged Akt2-pECE, FLAG-tagged Akt3-pECE, or vector without cDNA insert). Transfected 293T cells were extracted in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 ×g and immunoprecipitated with 2.5 μl of anti-Akt1, 5.0 μl of anti-Akt2, or 2.5 μl of anti-Akt3 antibodies. Immunoprecipitants were resolved on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Akt2 and Akt3 were detected by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibodies (1:1000), while Akt1 was detected with anti-HA antibodies (1:5000). Breast cancer cells (MCF-7, T-47D, MDA-MB-231, HBL-100) and prostate cancer cells (LNCaP, DU-145, PC-3) were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 3 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Cells were serum-starved overnight, stimulated with insulin, lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml bacitracin, 1 mmNa3VO4, 30 mm NaPPi, 10 mm NaF, 100 nm okadaic acid). Following centrifugation as above, the supernatants were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose beads coated with 2.5 μl of anti-Akt1, 5.0 μl of anti-Akt2, or 2.5 μl of anti-Akt3 antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with the lysis buffer and twice with the kinase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and assayed using GSK-3 peptide (GRPRTSSFAEG) as substrate as described (25Kohn A.D. Barthel A. Kovacina K.S. Boge A. Wallach B. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Scott P.H. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roth R.A. J. Biol.

Following the kinase reaction, the phosphorylated peptide was separated from unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP on a 40% polyacrylamide gel containing 6 m urea. The phosphopeptide spots were excised and counted. Control assays using protein A-Sepharose beads preabsorbed with normal rabbit serum were run concurrently, and the values from these were subtracted from the experimental. Breast cancer cells and prostate cancer cells were homogenized with lysis buffer (as described above). After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatants (1 mg of protein) were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with either protein G-Sepharose beads coated with 5 μg of sheep anti-Akt3 antibodies or protein A-Sepharose beads coated with rabbit anti-Akt1 antibodies. The bound proteins were resolved on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Akt3 was detected by Western blotting with the rabbit anti-Akt3 antibodies (1:1000), while Akt1 was detected with the monoclonal anti-Akt1 antibody (1:1000). Total RNA was extracted from tissue culture cells using RNAeasy (Qiagen). Primary human breast tumor tissues were collected fresh from mastectomy and biopsy specimens and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen (26Thompson D.A. Weigel R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from these specimens using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies). The quality and quantity of the RNA were determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. For RT-PCR studies, first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1–5 μg of total RNA with an oligo(dT) primer and Super Script II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies). Primers for PCR of human PTEN/MMAC1 were 5′-GGACGAACTGGTGTAATGATATG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-TCTACTGTTTTTGTGAAGTACAGC-3′ (reverse primer) to amplify a 671-bp fragment. Forward and reverse primers for human Akt1 were 5′-ATGAGCGACGTGGCTATTGTGAAG-3′ and 5′-GAGGCCGTCAGCCACAGTCTGGATG-3′, respectively; for human Akt2, 5′-ATGAATGAGGTGTCTGTCATCAAAGAAGGC-3′ and 5′-TGCTTGAGGCTGTTGGCGACC-3′, respectively; for human Akt3, 5′-ATGAGCGATGTTACCATTGT-3′ and 5′-CAGTCTGTCTGCTACAGCCTGGATA-3′, respectively; for the ER, 5′-GTGCCCTACTACCTGGAGAACGAGCCCAGC-3′ and 5′-AGCATAGTCATTGCACACTGCACAGTAGCG-3′, respectively; for β-actin, 5′-AGCAAGAGAGGCATCCTCACCCTGAAGTACC-3′ and 5′-CAGATTCTCCTTAATGTCACGCACGATTTCCC-3′, respectively. For Akt3, the human sequence was based on EST94063 (GenBankTM accession number AA381040) and EST753876 (GenBankTM accession numberAA479072). The conditions used for amplification were as follows: 94 °C for 1 min followed by 55 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 1 min in a 50-μl reaction buffer containing cDNA generated from 20 ng of total RNA, 0.2 mm each dNTP, 0.2 μmeach primer, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Life Technologies). Quantitation of the amount of PCR product after 30–33 cycles was performed after electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels and ethidium bromide staining. Poly(A) RNA was isolated from cancer cell lines using the Fast Track 2.0 kit (Invitrogen). Two μg of poly(A) RNA/lane were separated on a 1% agarose, 6.6% formaldehyde denaturing gel and transferred to nylon membranes using 20× SSC for 3 h and cross-linked by ultraviolet light. The blots were probed overnight at 42 °C with a random primed32P-labeled probe of either the human Akt3 PH domain (GenBankTM accession number AF135794) or the full-length human Akt1 (GenBankTM accession number M63167) as described previously (26Thompson D.A. Weigel R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The human Akt3 gene was localized by both fluorescence in situhybridization (FISH) and analyses of radiation cell hybrid panels. First, a human BAC library was screened by PCR (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). The forward and reverse primers were based on sequences in the 3′-untranslated region of an isolated Akt3 cDNA (16Nakatani K. Sakaue H. Thompson D.A Weigel R.J. Roth R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 906-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The isolated BAC was confirmed by sequencing to encode Akt3 and then used for FISH (Genome Systems, Inc., St. Louis, MO). The radiation hybrid cell panel (Gene Bridge 4 Mapping Panel; Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) was screened by PCR. The primer pair used for amplification was 5′-TCTTACACATAGCAGGGGCACCTTC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CAGTAGCAGCAACAGCATGAGACC-3′ (reverse primer), derived from the 3′-untranslated region of Akt3 (16Nakatani K. Sakaue H. Thompson D.A Weigel R.J. Roth R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 906-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). PCR products, 168 base pairs in length, were identified by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. To measure the amount of Akt1, -2, and -3 in cells, we utilized distinct antibodies for each isoform (see “Experimental Procedures”). To test the specificity of these antibodies, we first examined them for their ability to precipitate epitope-tagged expressed forms of these enzymes. Each antibody was found to preferentially precipitate its intended target, demonstrating their relative specificity (Fig. 1A). These antibodies were then utilized to examine the levels of the three isoforms of Akt in four breast cancer cell lines, two which express the ER (MCF-7, T-47D) and two which do not express the ER (MDA-MB-231, HBL-100). Cells were treated with buffer or insulin (to maximally stimulate the Akt enzymatic activity) and lysed, and the lysates were precipitated with antibodies to the three isoforms. An insulin-stimulated Akt1 activity was present in all four cell lines (Fig. 1B). Almost no detectable Akt2 activity was measured with or without insulin in all four cell lines (data not shown). Akt3 activity was 30–60-fold higher in the two ER-negative cell lines than in the two ER-positive cell lines (Fig. 1B). We then measured the activity of the Akt isoforms in three prostate cancer cell lines, one of which is androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) and two of which are androgen-insensitive (DU-145 and PC-3). Detectable Akt1 activity was present in all three cell lines (Fig. 1C), while little Akt2 activity was found (data not shown). Akt3 activity was 20–40-fold greater in the two androgen-insensitive cells than in the androgen-sensitive cells (Fig. 1C). PC-3, which does not contain PTEN (Ref. 27Whang Y.E. Wu X. Suzuki H. Reiter R.E. Tran C. Vessella R.L. Said J.W. Isaacs W.B. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5246-5250Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar; confirmed with the cells used in the present work), exhibited a 40–100-fold elevated basal level of Akt3 activity in comparison with the DU-145 cells. LNCaP, which also does not have a functional PTEN, exhibited a constitutively active Akt1. To determine whether the Akt3 enzymatic activities measured above reflected the levels of the Akt3 protein present in these different cells, we utilized a commercially available sheep antibody to Akt3 to precipitate the protein and then Western blotted these precipitates with the rabbit polyclonal antibody to Akt3. As controls, the levels of Akt1 protein and the ER in these cells were also monitored by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. The two ER-negative cells (MDA-MB-231, HBL-100) both contained an Akt3 band, whereas the two ER-positive cells (MCF-7, T-47D) did not contain a detectable Akt3 band (Fig. 2A). In contrast, all four cell lines contained an Akt1 band. Similar studies were then performed on the prostate cancer cell lines. The two androgen-insensitive cell lines (PC-3 and DU-145) were both found to contain Akt3, whereas no detectable Akt3 band was observed in the androgen-sensitive cells, LNCaP (Fig. 2B). Again, all three cell lines contained an Akt1 band. To determine whether the increase in Akt3 enzyme activity and protein was due to an increase in Akt3 mRNA, Northern blot analyses was performed. Akt3 mRNA was found to be greatly elevated in two ER-negative breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, HBL-100) and in a breast cancer cell line (BT-20) that exhibits very low levels of ER expression in comparison with the five ER-positive cells tested (Fig. 3). Akt3 transcripts of 7.7, 5.3, and 1.4 kilobase pairs were observed. In contrast, no specific pattern was observed with Akt1 mRNA levels, with the greatest amounts being present in MCF-7, MDA-MB-361, BT-474, and HBL-100 (Fig. 3). To assess Akt3 levels in primary human breast tumor tissues, semiquantitative RT-PCR was utilized. Controls first verified that this method also demonstrated elevated levels of the Akt3 mRNA in the two breast cancer cell lines that are ER-negative (the MDA-MB-231 and HBL-100 cells) (Fig. 2A). Using this method, we also found elevated levels of Akt3 mRNA in the two androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cell lines (DU-145 and PC-3) in comparison with the androgen-sensitive cells (Fig. 2B). Twenty-seven primary breast carcinomas were then analyzed. Concurrently, the levels of Akt1, Akt2, Akt3, β-actin, and ER mRNA were also measured (Fig. 4). There was a significant correlation between a low level of ER mRNA and elevated Akt3 mRNA (p = 0.04) in these samples, although some samples with ER did contain Akt3 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, there was no significant correlation between the ER mRNA levels and Akt1 mRNA (p = 0.69) (Fig. 4B) or Akt2 mRNA (p = 0.58) (data not shown). By RT-PCR, human mammary epithelial cells had high levels of Akt3 and low levels of ER (data not shown). Since many oncogenes are activated by chromosomal rearrangements and/or gene amplifications, we determined the chromosomal localization of the Akt3 gene. We first used radiation hybrid mapping. The GeneBridge 4 Radiation Hybrid Panel (Research Genetics) was screened by PCR using primers directed to the 3′-untranslated region, which gave a product with human genomic DNA but not with Chinese hamster DNA. PCR product was identified with the DNA of 22 of the 93 RH cell lines, and Akt3 was placed on chromosome 1, 5.45 cR from D1S2842 and 20.8 cR from AFM155XC11. These results indicated that the human Akt3 gene is localized to human chromosome 1q44. To verify these results, a human genomic clone for Akt3 was utilized for FISH (Fig. 5). Of 80 checked metaphase cells, 75 showed that the Akt3 gene was localized to the terminus of the long arm of chromosome 1, in a position corresponding to band 1q44. Thus, the results obtained by in situ hybridization and radiation hybrid panel were in accord. A wide variety of studies have implicated the serine/threonine kinase called Akt in the transformation of cells (1Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem.

J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). A mutant form of this enzyme was found to be the transforming component of AKT8 retrovirus (2Staal S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5034-5037Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). In addition, a tumor suppressor, called PTEN or MMAC1, regulates the basal activity of this enzyme and induces cell death, which is rescued by constitutively active forms of the enzyme (5Maehama T.

Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). In several cancers, an increase in Akt2 protein and mRNA was observed due to gene amplification (2Staal S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5034-5037Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 3Cheng J.Q. Ruggeri B. Klein W.M. Sonoda G. Altomare D.A. Watson D.K. Testa J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

S. A. 1992; 89: 9267-9271Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we have examined the levels of the three Akt isoforms in various breast cancer lines as well as prostate cancer cells. In all four breast cancer cell lines, Akt1 was present and stimulated by insulin treatment. In contrast, very little Akt2 enzymatic activity was detected. Most importantly, Akt3 enzymatic activity was 30–60-fold higher in the two ER-negative cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and HBL-100) than in the two ER-positive cell lines (MCF-7 and T-47D). Similarly, Akt3 enzymatic activity was 20–40-fold higher in two androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cell lines (DU-145 and PC-3) in comparison with an androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP). These findings indicate that the increases in Akt3 isoform may be more generally true for other cancers as well. In PC-3, a line of cells that lacks the lipid phosphatase PTEN, a markedly elevated basal level of Akt enzymatic activity was observed. This basal activity was predominantly contributed by Akt3. These results indicate that in some tumors that lack PTEN, the increase in basal activity of Akt may be primarily due to Akt3. The higher level of Akt3 enzymatic activity in both the ER-negative breast cancer cells and the androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells correlates with an increased expression of Akt3 protein and mRNA. The increase in Akt3 mRNA in these cell lines did not appear to be due to gene amplification in the cells tested (data not shown). Also, the chromosomal region identified as containing the Akt3 gene, 1q44, has not been found to be amplified in different cancers (29Knuutila S. Björkqvist A.-M. Autio K. Tarkkanen M. Wolf M. Monni O. Szymanska J. Larramendy M.L. Tapper J. Pere H. El Rifai W. Hemmer S. Wasenius V.-M. Vidgren V. Zhu Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 1107-1123PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is close to a region (1q42.2–43) that has been identified as predisposing individuals to early onset prostate cancer (30Berthon P. Valeri A. Cohen-Akenine A. Drelon E. Paiss T. Wohr G. Latil A. Millasseau P. Mellah I. Cohen N. Blanche H. BellaneChantelot C. Demenais F. Teillac P. Le Duc A. de Petriconi R. Hautmann R. Chumakov I. Bachner L. Maitland N.J. Lidereau R. Vogel W. Fournier G. Mangin P. Cohen P. Cussenot O. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 1416-1424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The inverse correlation between the ER levels and Akt3 levels observed in the breast cancer cell lines also appeared to persist in a panel of 27 primary breast carcinomas, although several samples did show a divergence from this pattern. It is possible that the divergence in some tumors may represent nonfunctional ER and/or tissue heterogeneity. It is also possible that the ER does not directly repress the expression of the Akt3 gene. In support of this latter hypothesis, attempts to express the ER in the ER-negative cells did not result in a decrease in the levels of Akt3 mRNA (data not shown), suggesting a more complex interaction. Alternatively, it is possible that since ER-negative breast carcinomas are generally less well differentiated then ER-positive cells (31Fisher E.R. Sass R. Fisher B. Cancer. 1987; 59: 1554-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the increase in Akt3 may be due to the general change in these cells to this less differentiated phenotype. In either case, since hormone-unresponsive breast and prostate carcinomas are generally more aggressive clinically with higher metastatic potential than hormone-responsive tumors (17Chevallier B. Heintzmann F. Mosseri V. Dauce J.P. Bastit P. Graic Y. Brunelle P. Basuyau J.P. Comoz M. Asselain B. Cancer. 1988; 62: 2517-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18Henry J.A. Nicholson S.

Anticancer Res. 1997; 17: 4253-4258PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that Akt3 contributes to this phenotype. For example, the ability of Akt to inhibit apoptosis induced by a wide variety of agents could make the tumors with high Akt3 levels more resistant to chemotherapeutic treatments. Furthermore, the ability of Akt to inhibit death of cells after detachment from the extracellular matrix could promote the frequency of metastasis (32Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1972452632,"Plants produce new appendages reiteratively from groups of stem cells called shoot apical meristems. LEAFY (LFY) and APETALA1 (AP1) are pivotal for the switch to the reproductive phase, where instead of leaves the shoot apical meristem produces flowers. Use of steroid-inducible activation of LFY demonstrated that early expression of AP1 is a result of transcriptional induction by LFY. This AP1 induction is independent of protein synthesis and occurs specifically in the tissues and at the developmental stage in which floral fate is assumed. Later expression of AP1 appears to be only indirectly affected by LFY."

Candida glabrata adhered avidly to human epithelial cells in culture. By means of a genetic approach and a strategy allowing parallel screening of mutants, it was possible to clone a lectin from a Candida species. Deletion of this adhesin reduced adherence of C. glabrata to human epithelial cells by 95 percent. The adhesin, encoded by the EPA1 gene, is likely a glucan-cross-linked cell-wall protein and binds to host-cell carbohydrate, specifically recognizing asialo-lactosyl-containing carbohydrates."

The LEAFY protein, which is expressed throughout the flower, participates in the activation of homeotic genes, which are expressed in specific regions of the flower. Analysis of a LEAFY-responsive enhancer in the homeotic gene AGAMOUS indicates that direct interaction of LEAFY with this enhancer is required for its activity in plants. Thus, LEAFY is a direct upstream regulator of floral homeotic genes."

Multielectrode recordings in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of awake behaving ferrets, before eye opening, revealed patterns of spontaneous activity that reflect a reshaping of retinal drive within higher visual stages. Significant binocular correlations were present only when cortico-thalamic feedback was intact. In the absence of retinal drive, cortico-thalamic feedback was required to sustain correlated LGN bursting. Activity originating from the contralateral eye drove thalamic activity far more strongly than that originating from the ipsilateral eye. Thus, in vivo patterns of LGN spontaneous activity emerge from interactions between retina, thalamus, and cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1976097978,"Proteinase inhibitors are important negative regulators of proteinase action in vivo. We have succeeded in isolating two previously unknown polypeptides (HF6478 and HF7665) from human blood filtrate that are parts of a larger precursor protein containing two typical Kazal-type serine proteinase inhibitor motifs. The entire precursor protein, as deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cloned cDNA, exhibits 15 potential inhibitory domains, including the Kazal-type domains, HF6478, HF7665, and 11 additional similar domains. An inhibitory effect of HF7665 on trypsin activity is demonstrated. Because all of the 13 HF6478- and HF7665-related domains share partial homology to the typical Kazal-type domain but lack one of the three conserved disulfide bonds, they may represent a novel type of serine proteinase inhibitor. The gene encoding the multidomain proteinase inhibitor, which we have termed LEKTI, was localized on human chromosome 5q31-32. As shown by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Northern blot analysis, it is expressed in the thymus, vaginal epithelium, Bartholin's glands, oral mucosa, tonsils, and the parathyroid glands. From these results, we assume that LEKTI may play a role in anti-inflammatory and/or antimicrobial protection of mucous epithelia. Proteinase inhibitors are important negative regulators of proteinase action in vivo. We have succeeded in isolating two previously unknown polypeptides (HF6478 and HF7665) from human blood filtrate that are parts of a larger precursor protein containing two typical Kazal-type serine proteinase inhibitor motifs. The entire precursor protein, as deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cloned cDNA, exhibits 15 potential inhibitory domains, including the Kazal-type domains, HF6478, HF7665, and 11 additional similar domains. An inhibitory effect of HF7665 on trypsin activity is demonstrated. Because all of the 13 HF6478- and HF7665-related domains share partial homology to the typical Kazal-type domain but lack one of the three conserved disulfide bonds, they may represent a novel type of serine proteinase inhibitor.

Proteinases are enzymes required for nonspecific processes of digestion and intracellular protein turnover as well as specific proteolytic activation of inactive precursors of many regulatory proteins, such as enzymes and peptide hormones. In addition, they are involved in several processes of extracellular matrix remodeling. Depending on the nature of their reactive center, they are subdivided into the classes of serine, cysteine, aspartate, and metalloproteinases (for review see Ref. 1Neurath H. Science. 1984; 224: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). To control the action of proteinases in vivo, organisms produce another group of proteins, namely the proteinase inhibitors (for review see Refs. 2Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar, 3Bode W. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 433-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 4Roberts R.M. Mathialagan N. Duffie J.Y. Smith G.W. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1995; 5: 385-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Indeed, many pathological effects are due to the non-regulated action of endogenously produced proteinases or such proteinases encoded or synthesized by viruses, bacteria, and parasites (for review see Ref.5Seife C. Science. 1997; 277: 1602-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For instance, a genetically determined fault of the α1-proteinase inhibitor may lead to an enhanced proneness to lung emphysema caused by uncontrolled action of leukocyte elastase (6Miller F. Kuschner M. Am. J. Med. 1969; 46: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Ohlsson K. Fryksmark U. Tegner H. Eur. J. Clin.

Science. 1997; 277: 2002-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). Thus, proteinase inhibitors represent an important therapeutic tool for a large number of different disorders. Here we report the isolation of two peptides (HF6478 and HF7665) from human blood filtrate (hemofiltrate), which may represent a novel class of proteinase inhibitor. Blood filtrate, a by-product of ultrafiltration of the blood from patients with acute renal failure, is routinely used by us as a source for the systematic as well as random isolation of novel human peptides (9Schulz-Knappe P. Raida M. Meyer M. Quellhorst E.A. Forssmann W.G. Eur. J. Med. Res. 1996; 1: 223-236PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the cut-off limit of the hemofilters (approximately 20,000 Da), it mainly contains peptides exhibiting a molecular mass below 20,000 Da. Nevertheless, we succeeded in isolating members of many different peptide/protein families such as hormones, cytokines, growth factors, enzymes, proteinase inhibitors, transport, and plasma proteins (10Richter R. Schulz-Knappe P. Schrader M. Ständker L. Jürgens M. Tammen H. Forssmann W.G. J. Chromatogr. B. 1999; 726: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The two isolated peptides, HF6478 and HF7665, as deduced from cDNA cloning, are part of a common putative precursor protein termed LEKTI, which contains 11 additional similar peptides plus two typical Kazal-type serine proteinase inhibitor domains (a total of 15 potential inhibitory domains). We demonstrate the ability of HF7665 to inhibit trypsin and show the expression of the corresponding gene in human thymus, vaginal epithelium, Bartholin's glands, oral mucosa, tonsils, and the parathyroid glands. From the data obtained, we assume that LEKTI may be important for the anti-inflammatory and/or antimicrobial protection of mucous epithelia. Human blood ultrafiltrate (hemofiltrate, HF) obtained from a local nephrological center (Hannoversch-Münden, Germany) was acidified with HCl to pH 3.0 and cooled to inhibit proteolysis. Following a random isolation strategy, extraction of the peptides and subsequent analysis by mass spectrometry and sequencing was performed as described for the isolation and characterization of vitronectin-derived peptides (11Ständker L. Enger A. Schulz-Knappe P. Wohn K.D. Germer M. Raida M. Forssmann W.G. Preissner K.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Conditioned blood filtrate was loaded onto a cation exchange column (25 × 5 cm, Fractogel SP 650M, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and eluted with 1 mammonium acetate, 0.5 m acetic acid, and 20% methanol at a flow rate of 50 ml/min. Aliquots of the fractions obtained were subjected to an RP-C18 column (15–20 μm, 300 Å, 47 × 300 mm, Vydac, Hesperia, CA) and further separated at a flow rate of 42 ml/min using a gradient of 1% buffer B/min (buffer A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; buffer B, 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Selected single fractions were loaded onto a cation exchange column (5 μm, 300 Å, 10 × 50 mm Pepkat, Biotek, Östringen, Germany) and separated at a flow rate of 3 ml/min using a gradient of 1% buffer B/min (buffer A, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 3.0; buffer B, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 3.0, 1 mNaCl). To obtain highly purified homogenous peptides, selected peak fractions were rechromatographed by analytical RP-HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: RP-HPLC, reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; bp, base pair(s). using a C18 column (5 μm, 300 Å, 0.46 × 25 cm, Vydac, Hesperia, CA) with the same buffers as for the preparative C18 RP-HPLC described above. For the determination of intramolecular disulfide bonds, native HF7665 was cleaved by endoproteinases (chymotrypsin, Glu-C, Lys-C, Asp-N; Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Basel, Switzerland), and the generated fragments were subsequently analyzed by mass spectrometry and amino acid sequencing as described (11Ständker L. Enger A. Schulz-Knappe P. Wohn K.D. Germer M. Raida M. Forssmann W.G. Preissner K.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). RNA extraction, cDNA first strand synthesis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), RACE PCR, Northern blot hybridization, DNA sequencing, genome walking PCR, sequence analysis, and chromosomal localization of the gene by radiation hybrid mapping were performed as already described (12Pardigol A. Forssmann U. Zucht H.D. Loetscher P. Schulz-Knappe P. Baggiolini M. Forssmann W.G. Mägert H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 444-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For Northern hybridization, a blot with 20 μg of total RNA from each tissue as well as a commercially available blot (Human Immune System II, CLONTECH) with 2 μg of poly(A)+RNA from each tissue were used. As a hybridization probe, we used a 1713-bp PCR-generated and 32P-labeled partial fragment of the entire cDNA mentioned below (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AJ228139) which spans the region from nucleotide 679 to nucleotide 2391. PCR-based radiation hybrid mapping was performed by means of an exon-specific sense primer (PSTILP-11, TGCCATGAATTTCAGGCATTTATGAAAAATGG) and an intron-specific antisense primer (LEKTI-55, GAAAAATAATACATTTACCAGTTCAGAG) corresponding to nucleotide positions 131–162 of the cloned cDNA (EMI/GenBankTM accession number AJ228139) and positions 78–51 of an intron following the nucleotide in position 252 of the cDNA, respectively. This intron was identified by the genome walking strategy using the GenomeWalker kit human (CLONTECH) (15Walter M.A. Spillet D.J. Thomas P. Weissenbach J. Goodfellow P.N. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and cDNA-derived primers (not shown). The products obtained by the radiation hybrid mapping PCR were in the expected size range of 200 bp and could be verified as LEKTI-specific by means of direct fluorescence sequencing. Analytical RT-PCR was performed using the sense primer LEKEX-1S (CCAGTGTACGTAAAGAATGAAGATCAGGAAATGTGCCATGA) in combination with the antisense primer LEKTI-53 (ATTCTTTGCCTGATTTTGATATTGACTGC). Both primers are exon-specific and flank the above-mentioned intron, thus allowing discrimination between amplified cDNA and genomic DNA fragments. Other molecular biological standard methods were performed according to Sambrook et al. (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were purchased as “ResearchOligos” from Perkin Elmer (Weiterstadt, Germany). Within the nucleotide sequences of the oligonucleotides mentioned, the letters in italics represent “add-on regions” of the oligonucleotides that do not correspond to coding regions of the cDNA/gene but contain recognition sequences for certain restriction endonucleases. The following degenerate oligonucleotides were constructed from the amino acid sequence of the peptide HF6478 (listed in 5′→3′ orientation): MEMC-1,CCTTCGAATTCTAGAAARAAYGARGAYCARGARATGTG (sense); CHEF-1, CAYGARTTYCARGCNTTYATGAARAAYGG (sense); CHEF-2, ATCATYTTRCANGTNGCRCAYTT (antisense). As an oligonucleotide complementary to the poly(A) tail of eukaryotic mRNA, UNIP-2 was used: CCTGAATTCTAGAGCTCATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT. A part of the LEKTI precursor cDNA was amplified using a two-step strategy as follows. cDNA first strand was synthesized from biopsy material representing 17 human tissues (parotid gland, pancreas, skeletal muscle, brain, stomach, liver, kidney, lung, heart, heart auricle, bladder, tonsils, corpus cavernosum penis, vaginal epithelium, colon, bone marrow, and blood). 1/300 of each cDNA first-strand reaction mixture was subjected to RT-PCR amplification under the following conditions: 94 °C, 3 min; 98 °C, 1 s, 45 °C, 30 s, 72 °C, 2 min, 30 cycles; 72 °C, 3 min, 1 cycle; cold start; primers used: MEMC-1/UNIP-2. 1/100 of each preamplification step was used as a template for a second PCR amplification: 94 °C, 3 min; 98 °C, 1 s, 50 °C, 30 s, 72 °C, 2 min, 30 cycles; 72 °C, 3 min, 1 cycle; cold start; primers used: CHEF-1/CHEF-2. Homogenous 140-bp PCR fragments from vaginal epithelium and tonsil cDNA were cloned in pGEM T-vector and sequenced. The obtained partial cDNA sequence served as a basis for further RACE PCR experiments (see above), finally resulting in cloning and sequencing of the entire LEKTI cDNA. The potential Kazal-type proteinase inhibitor domains occurring within the LEKTI amino acid sequence derived from the cDNA sequence were identified by means of the MacPattern program (17Fuchs R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1991; 7: 105-106PubMed Google Scholar) and the Prosite data base (18Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19 (suppl.): 2241-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) on an Apple Power Macintosh computer. A partial cDNA fragment encoding the peptide HF7665 was PCR-amplified under standard conditions using cDNA from human vaginal epithelium and the primers VADEX-61S, GAATCTGGAAAAGCAACCTCATATGC (5′-phosphorylated), and VADEX-61AS,CCGTATGGTACCGAATTCTTACTAGTTTCTTGATTCGCCTTCCTTC. TheEscherichia coli expression vector pTrcHis B (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was cleaved with BamHI and subsequently treated with S1 single-strand nuclease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) to generate blunt ends. The vector and the generated cDNA PCR fragment were then cleaved with EcoRI, and the latter was cloned site-directed into the blunt-ended BamHI and the EcoRI site of the vector. Transformation of E. coli TOP10 cells, induction of rHF7665 expression by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and removal of the His tag by cleavage with enterokinase were accomplished according to the manufacturer's instructions using the pTrcHis Xpress kit and EnterokinaseMax (both from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Pure rHF7665 was finally isolated by means of RP-HPLC, and its identity to native HF7665 could be demonstrated by mass spectrometry and amino acid sequencing as described above. Inhibitory effects of HF7665 and recombinant HF7665 (rHF7665) on trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were examined in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, and 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100.N α-benzoyl-l-argininep-nitroanilide (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany; final concentration of 220 μm) was used as substrate, and its hydrolysis was monitored by the change in absorbance at 405 nm. Various inhibitor and trypsin (bovine, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) concentrations were added to the reaction mixtures, and the residual activity of the proteinase was measured in a quartz cuvette thermostatically controlled at 25 °C. Bovine albumin (fraction V; Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) served as a negative control. Inhibition assays with other serine proteinases (chymotrypsin, leukocyte elastase, thrombin, tissue plasminogen activator, tryptase, plasmin, tissue kallikrein, factor Xa, plasma kallikrein, and urokinase) were performed in a similar way but using different appropriate chromogenic substrates. The peptide isolation procedure described above resulted in purification of two as yet unknown peptides. According to their source (human hemofiltrate) and their molecular mass, they were designated as HF6478 and HF7665 (hemofiltrate peptides with molecular masses of 6478 and 7665 Da, respectively). Both peptides exhibit deviations in their amino acid sequences and molecular masses but show an identical four-cysteine pattern (Fig. 1A). To determine the amino acid sequence of its precursor protein and to investigate the expression pattern of the corresponding gene, we cloned and sequenced the HF6478-specific cDNA as described above. The entire cDNA sequence (GenBankTM/EBI accession numberAJ228139) comprises 3528 bp excluding the poly(A) tail. It exhibits an open reading frame of 3192 bp encoding a putative 1064-amino acid precursor protein which includes the purified peptide HF6478 and, surprisingly, also the peptide HF7665 (Fig. 1B). Thus, HF6478 and HF7665 represent fragments of the same precursor protein. In addition, the precursor protein contains 11 motifs exhibiting a high degree of sequence identity to HF6478 and HF7665 and an absolutely identical four-cysteine pattern. Using the MacPattern program (17Fuchs R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1991; 7: 105-106PubMed Google Scholar) and the Prosite data base (18Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19 (suppl.): 2241-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), a typical Kazal-type motif (19Kazal L.A. Spicer D.S. Brahinsky R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1948; 70: 3034-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 20Green L.J. Bartelt D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2646-2657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was identified occurring C-terminally behind HF6478. A second related domain is located at the C terminus of the entire precursor protein. Both domains match the six-cysteine pattern of the “classical” Kazal-type inhibitors (spacing between the six cysteine residues: 6-7-10-2, 3-17) almost exactly. As the only deviation, the spacing between the first two cysteines is 13 (first Kazal domain) and 12 (second Kazal domain) instead of six amino acids. Moreover, the putative reactive center of the first Kazal-type-related domain exhibits a significant sequence identity to the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (Kazal-type, data not shown) enabling determination of potential P1 and P1′ sites as shown in Fig. 1B. This finding confirms the supposed function of the protein as a serine proteinase inhibitor. Comparison of the 15 domains with one another revealed that their cysteine patterns are identical, but that the 13 non-Kazal-type domains lack cysteines three and six of the Kazal-type domain. However, as demonstrated for HF7665 by proteolytic digests with subsequent mass spectrometric analysis and sequencing (data not shown), the remaining four cysteines exhibit a 1-4/2-3 disulfide pattern which is in agreement with the 1-5/2-4/3-6 disulfide pattern of the six cysteines of the Kazal-type domain. Because sufficient amounts of native HF7665 were available from human blood filtrate (concentration > 100 pm), we tested its inhibitory properties with the serine proteinases chymotrypsin, leukocyte elastase, thrombin, tissue plasminogen activator, tryptase, trypsin, plasmin, tissue kallikrein, factor Xa, plasma kallikrein, and urokinase. Indeed, we obtained a significant but temporary inhibitory effect on trypsin with an apparent KI of approximately 150 nm (Fig. 2). To avoid errors caused by contamination with non-detectable inhibitory components of the preparation, we repeated the assays with HF7665 biotechnologically produced in E. coli. In this case, we obtained identical results, verifying the inhibitory effect of native HF7665. The amount of purified native HF6478 was only sufficient for mass spectrometry and sequence analysis. Thus, the recombinant production of all 15 domains, which should enable further structural and functional analysis of the single domains as well as the entire protein, is presently in progress. The tissue-specific expression pattern of the corresponding gene was determined with the sensitive RT-PCR method. In addition to the 17 cDNA samples mentioned above, we used cDNA from the placenta, Bartholin's glands, oral mucosa, and the parathyroid gland. Of all tissues analyzed, an expression of the gene was detectable in the oral mucosa, parathyroid gland, Bartholin's glands, tonsils, and vaginal epithelium (Fig. 3A) and at very low levels also in the lung, kidney, and prostate (data not shown). To verify the cloning of an almost full-length cDNA and to detect further loci of gene expression, we performed less sensitive Northern blot hybridizations with 20 μg of total RNA of each of the following human tissues: Bartholin's glands, vaginal epithelium, tonsils, and placenta. Of these tissues, only the Bartholin's glands gave a signal (Fig. 3B). In addition, we used a commercially available blot containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA of each of the following human tissues: spleen, lymph node, thymus, peripheral blood leukocytes, bone marrow, and fetal liver. In this case, we obtained a strong hybridization signal from the thymus (Fig. 3B), indicating this organ as a locus of high level gene expression. As calculated by means of logarithmic regression, the size of the hybridizing mRNA is in the range of 3750 nucleotides. Taking into consideration the fact that eukaryotic mRNA usually contains a poly(A) tail which is not included in the cDNA sequence, this finding is in good agreement with the cDNA size of 3528 bp. From the results obtained, we termed the precursor protein “LEKTI” (lympho-epithelialKazal-type-related inhibitor). The chromosomal localization of the LEKTIgene was determined by means of the PCR-based radiation hybrid mapping (see above). The evaluation of the PCR results revealed the positioning of the LEKTIgene between the markers WI-4870 and D5S413, which correlates to human chromosome 5q31-32 (data not shown). This is in agreement with the typical Kazal-type inhibitor pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor whose gene is also located on chromosome 5 (21Yamamoto T. Nakamura Y. Nishide T. Emi M. Ogawa M. Mori T. Matsubara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In summarizing, 13 of the 15 LEKTI domains exhibit a Kazal-type-derived four-cysteine residue pattern which represents a novel protein module of serine proteinase inhibitor, possibly responsible for temporary fine tuning of proteinase action. Together with the extraordinarily high number of potential inhibitory domains, which is even higher than in the case of the seven-domain ovoinhibitor (22Scott M.J. Huckaby C.S. Kato I. Kohr W.J. Laskowski Jr., M. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5899-5907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these findings indicate that LEKTI may represent an as yet unknown type of human multidomain serine proteinase inhibitor. The isolation of the peptides HF6478 and HF7665 indicates a mechanism of specific endoproteolytic cleavage of the precursor protein in vivo, which may also result in the occurrence of the other 13 domains as single peptides or as parts of fragments of the precursor protein containing only lower numbers of domains. Because these domains have not yet been isolated, further attempts for their isolation from sources such as hemofiltrate orLEKTIgene-expressing tissues are planned. However, because the high degree of similarity of most of the domains will complicate their specific identification, for example by means of non-cross-reacting antibodies, the realization of this intention may be difficult. As yet, the biological function of LEKTI is unclear. Antileukoprotease/secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (ALP, SLPI), another serine proteinase inhibitor occurring in various external secretions, is described to exhibit antibacterial and antiviral properties (23Hiemstra P.S. Maassen R.J. Stolk J. Heinzel-Wieland R. Steffens G.J. Dijkman J.H. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4520-4524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wahl S.M. McNeely T.B. Janoff E.N. Shugars D. Worley P. Tucker C. Orenstein J.M. Oral Dis. 1997; 3 Suppl. 1: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Thus, a main role of LEKTI in antimicrobial and/or anti-inflammatory protection of mucous epithelia is conceivable. On the other hand, LEKTI shares some common structural features with agrin, a 200-kDa extracellular matrix protein (for review see Ref. 25Kleiman R.J. Reichardt L.F. Cell. 1996; 85: 461-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Like LEKTI, agrin also possesses a high number of Kazal-type-related domains, being able to inhibit serine proteinases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin (26Biroc S.L. Payan D.G. Fisher J.M. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1993; 75: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, agrin seems to serve mainly as a differentiation factor, being important for the generation of neuromuscular junctions (25Kleiman R.J. Reichardt L.F. Cell. 1996; 85: 461-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because the LEKTIgene is highly expressed in the thymus and probably in lower amounts also in the parathyroid gland (Fig. 3), the possibility of a comparable function in the regulation of differentiation processes, for example the maturation of T-lymphocytes, must be taken into consideration. Further investigations are now necessary to determine the main target proteinases of LEKTI, its function within the thymus and parathyroid gland, the inhibitory potency of the other 12 non-Kazal-type domains in comparison to HF7665 and the Kazal-type domains, and to clarify a possible systemic as well as the pathophysiological role of LEKTI."
https://openalex.org/W2034320996,"One or more free hydroxyls of the phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) head group undergo enzymatic phosphorylation, yielding phosphoinositides (PIs) with key functions in eukaryotic cellular regulation. Two such species, PtdIns 5-P and PtdIns 3,5-P2, have now been identified in mammalian cells, but their biosynthesis remains unclear. We have isolated a novel mammalian PI kinase, p235, whose exact substrate specificity remained to be determined (Shisheva, A., Sbrissa, D., and Ikonomov, O. (1999)Mol. Cell. Biol. 19, 623–634). Here we report that recombinant p235 expressed in COS cells, like the authentic p235 in adipocytes, displays striking specificity for PtdIns over PI substrates and generates two products identified as PtdIns 5-P and PtdIns 3,5-P2 by HPLC analyses. Synthetic PtdIns 3-P substrates were also converted to PtdIns 3,5-P2 but to a substantially lesser extent than PtdIns isolated from natural sources. Important properties of the p235 PI 5-kinase include high sensitivity to nonionic detergents and relative resistance to wortmannin and adenosine. By analyzing deletion mutants in a heterologous cell system, we determined that in addition to the predicted catalytic domain other regions of the molecule are critical for the p235 enzymatic activity. HPLC resolution of monophosphoinositide products, generated by p235 immune complexes derived from lysates of 3T3-L1 adipocytes acutely stimulated with insulin, revealed essentially the same PtdIns 5-P levels as the corresponding p235 immune complexes of resting cells. However, the acute insulin action resulted in an increase of a wortmannin-sensitive PtdIns 3-P peak, suggestive of a plausible recruitment of wortmannin-sensitive PI 3-kinase(s) to p235. In conclusion, mouse p235 (renamed here PIKfyve) displays a strong in vitro activity for PtdIns 5-P and PtdIns 3,5-P2 generation, implying PIKfyve has a key role in their biosynthesis.

Although the inositol head group of PtdIns contains five candidate phosphorylation positions, the hydroxyl groups only at positions D-3, D-4, and D-5 are found to be phosphorylated intracellularly, separately, or in all possible combinations, resulting in 7 phosphoinositide (PI) species, i.e. PtdIns 3-P, PtdIns 4-P, PtdIns 5-P, PtdIns 3,4-P2, PtdIns 4,5-P2, PtdIns 3,5-P2, and PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 (3Carpenter C.L.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). A wide spectrum of phosphoinositide kinases with broad or more restricted substrate specificity are responsible for their biosynthesis. These enzymes are typically grouped in three general families on the basis of their specificity for a particular position: PI 3-kinases, PI 4-kinases, and PI 5-kinases (2Loijens J.C. Boronenkov I.V. Parker G.J. Anderson R.A. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1996; 36: 115-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 3Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinases, usually subdivided into three classes, catalyze the phosphorylation of PtdIns or its phosphorylated derivatives PtdIns 4-P and PtdIns 4,5-P2 at the 3-position of the inositol ring. The PI 4-kinases are also represented by several types. They all display narrower substrate specificity strictly directed toward position D-4 of PtdIns, but not of PI (i.e. the phosphorylated PtdIns derivatives), and are now called PtdIns 4-Ks (8Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). In addition, position 4 of already phosphorylated PtdIns, but not of pure PtdIns, can be attacked by the enzymatic activity of another subclass of PI kinases, known previously as type II PIP5Ks (2Loijens J.C. Boronenkov I.V. Parker G.J. Anderson R.A. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1996; 36: 115-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and recently renamed PIP4-Ks (8Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 9Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) to reflect more accurately their substrate specificity (10Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Finally, position 5 is targeted by a subclass of enzymes now known as PI 5-Ks (8Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 9Toker A. Curr. Opin.

To a substantially lesser extent, the latter enzymes are capable of converting PtdIns to PtdIns 5-P (13Tolias K.F. Rameh L.E. Ishihara H. Shibassaki Y. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18040-18046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Notably, an enzymatic activity specifically directed toward position 5 of PtdIns has never been described, yet in mammalian cells the PtdIns 5-P species are found at relatively high levels, comparable to that of PI 3-P (10Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). We have recently identified a novel mammalian protein, p235, whose expression is enriched in insulin-sensitive cells (14Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). p235 harbors several evolutionarily conserved domains (14Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) with potential functional significance, including a Zn2+/PtdIns 3-P binding FYVE finger (15Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.-H.

Enzyme Regul. 1996; 36: 115-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The sequence homology between the predicted kinase domains of p235 and the mammalian PI 5-Ks and PIP4Ks provided the first indication that p235 might be a PIP4- or 5-kinase. Unexpectedly, the derivatives of PtdIns phosphorylated on D-4 or D-5 positions appear to be poor substrates of the adipocytic p235 under in vitroconditions. Instead, the adipocytic p235 was found to phosphorylate PtdIns to PtdIns-P (14Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) whose exact identity remained to be determined. Furthermore, p235 shares similar structural architecture and substantial homology in the above three evolutionarily conserved domains with a yeast gene product, Fab1p (19Yamamoto A. DeWald D.B. Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. Emr S.D. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 525-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), whose in vivolipid product in the presence of hyperosmotic shock has been now determined to be PtdIns 3,5-P2 (20Gary J.C.

The aim of the present study was to characterize in detail the specificity of p235 for a particular inositol lipid substrate and phosphorylation position and a plausible regulation of its enzymatic activity by insulin. Using HPLC analyses under conditions that reliably separate the individual monophosphoinositides and bisphosphoinositides, we report here that both the native and the recombinant p235 display almost exclusive abilities to convert PtdIns to PtdIns 5-P and PtdIns 3,5-P2 in vitro. The activity of the adipocytic enzyme to generate 5-phosphoinositides remains unchanged upon acute cell stimulation with insulin. Thus, p235 is the first known mammalian phosphoinositide kinase with a powerful enzymatic activity to generate PtdIns 5-P and PtdIns 3,5-P2. Phospholipid substrates were purchased from the following sources: PtdIns, phosphatidic acid, and phosphatidylserine from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.; synthetic dipalmitoyl PtdIns 3-P from Matreya; PtdIns 4-P, PtdIns 4,5-P2, and phosphatidylcholine from Sigma; synthetic dipalmitoyl PtdIns, PtdIns 4-P, PtdIns 5-P, and PtdIns 3,4-P2 from Echelon Research Laboratories. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol), [3H]PtdIns 4-P, and [3H]PtdIns 4,5-P2 were from NEN Life Science Products. Polyclonal anti-PI 4-kinase β p110 and anti-PI 3-kinase p85 antisera were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Horseradish peroxidase-bound anti-rabbit IgG was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and chemiluminescence detection kit was from NEN Life Science Products. Rabbit polyclonal anti-p235 antiserum (R7069, East Acres) was directed against a recombinant GST fusion protein comprising the N terminus of p235 (amino acids 1–100). This antibody was used throughout the study because its immunoprecipitating capacity has been found superior to that of the C-terminal antipeptide p235 antibody used in our previous studies (R6951, Ref. 14Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-hemagluttinin (HA) antiserum was a kind gift from Mike Czech and Joanne Buxton. [3H]GroPIns 5-P and synthetic dipalmitoyl PtdIns 3-P were a kind gift from Stephen Dove. Viral stock of p170 PI 3-kinase (22Virbasius J.V. Guilherme A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13304-13307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Mike Czech and Joe Virbasius. Human insulin was a gift from Eli Lilly. Construction of a full-length clone from the p235 partial sequence clones in pBluescript II SK(+) was described previously (14Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Deletions of the evolutionarily conserved domains in p235 were used to establish the role of these regions for the p235 enzymatic activity. Truncations eliminating the C-terminal kinase domain (p235-(1812–2052), the N terminus including portions of the FYVE finger (p235-(1–198), or the chaperonin domain in the middle of the molecule (p235-(560–1231) were made using convenient restriction sites. Specifically, the p235-(1812–2052) deletion mutant was generated by digesting the full-length p235S cDNA (14Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) in pBluescript II SK(+) with XbaI and SmaI. The released 5.5-kilobase pair insert was then ligated into aXbaI-SmaI digest of pBluescript II SK(+). The p235-(560–1231) deletion mutant was generated by digesting the full-length p235S in pBluescript with NcoI. The resulting 2 inserts of 570 and 1449 base pairs were disregarded, whereas the remaining 7-kilobase pair fragment was purified from the gel and closed. Two steps were necessary for making the ΔN1–198 deletion mutant. First, the N-terminal part of the p235S cDNA (nucleotides 136–2929 in pBluescript) was digested with PstI. The resulting two inserts of 537 and 63 base pairs were eliminated, and the rest of the construct was ligated. In the second step, the truncated (Δ1–198) N-terminal fragment was released withXbaI-KpnI and ligated with the C-terminal part of p235 (released by KpnI-SalI) into aXbaI-SalI digest of pBluescript II SK(+). Finally, all deletion constructs released by XbaI and SalI from pBluescript II SK(+) were tagged at the NH2 terminus with a 9-amino acid epitope, YRYDVPDYA, derived from influenza virus HA as we previously described (14Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 23Shisheva A. Sudhof T.C. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3459-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, the double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the epitope sequence after the initial Met and flanked with EcoRI and XbaI was subcloned together with the aboveXbaI-SalI-digested p235 cDNA deletion fragments into EcoRI and SalI sites of the mammalian expression vector pCMV5. The expected organization of all mutants was confirmed by restriction endonuclease mapping. Conditions for differentiation of 3T3-L1 mouse fibroblasts into insulin-sensitive adipocytes were as described previously (24Shisheva A. Buxton J. Czech M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23865-23868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Differentiated cells were used between 7 and 12 days after the onset of the differentiation program. COS-7 cells were seeded to indicated density (100 mm plate) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. COS-7 cells were seeded at 750,000 cells/100-mm plate. Transfection with pCMV5-HA-p235S or deletion mutants was performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as we described previously (25Shisheva A. Doxsey S.J. Buxton J.M. Czech M.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 143-158PubMed Google Scholar). Forty eight to 70 h posttransfection, the cell lysates were collected in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm benzamidine)) and used for immunoprecipitation. 3T3-L1 adipocytes, serum-deprived for 4 h prior to the experiment, were incubated in the absence or presence of insulin (100 nm) for 10 min at 37 °C. After washes in phosphate-buffered saline the cells were scraped in RIPA buffer at 4 °C, and the lysates were further subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-p235 N-terminal antiserum or preimmune serum. p235 was immunoprecipitated from 3T3-L1 adipocytes or COS-7 cells transiently expressing the epitope-tagged p235WT or p235 deletion mutants, using anti-p235 N-terminal-specific or anti-HA antibodies. Prior to the immunoprecipitations, the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer. The lysates were precleared by centrifugation for 10 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C and incubated with immune or preimmune sera for 16 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was added in the final 1.5 h of incubation at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed with RIPA buffer, solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar), and analyzed by Western blotting or subjected to additional washes prior to their assay for lipid kinase activity. For Western blot analysis, the samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6% acrylamide). After transfer onto nitrocellulose filters, the blots were saturated with blocking buffer under previously specified conditions (14Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and blotted (16 h at 4 °C) with anti-p235 N-terminal or anti-HA antibodies. After washes, bound antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-bound anti-rabbit IgG and a chemiluminescence kit. After immunoprecipitation the beads were washed once with RIPA buffer; twice with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl; thrice with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm LiCl; twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA; and twice with “assay buffer” (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, containing typically 10 mm MgCl2 if not otherwise indicated). The kinase reaction, carried out in the assay buffer (50 μl final volume) for 15 min at 37 °C, contained 50 μm ATP (12.5 μCi) (or 15 μm ATP, 30 μCi for HPLC analysis) and 100 μm lipid substrate (PtdIns, PtdIns 3-P, PtdIns 4-P, PtdIns 5-P, PtdIns 3,4-P2, or PtdIns 4,5-P2) sonicated individually in “lipid buffer” (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) by 2 × 30 s intervals in a bath sonicator. When lipid substrates and lipid carriers were provided as a mixture they were sonicated together in a 1:1 molar ratio in the lipid buffer. The reaction was stopped with 200 μl of 1 N HCl, and the lipids were extracted with 160 μl of 1:1 (v/v) chloroform:methanol. The lower layer was collected and washed twice with 100 μl of 1:1 (v/v) methanol, 1 N HCl. Aliquots of the resulting organic layer were applied on pre-eluted (1.2% potassium oxalate) and activated (110 °C, 16 h) TLC plates (Whatman, PE SIL G, 250 μm). The lipids were separated by chromatographic solvent systems (13Tolias K.F. Rameh L.E. Ishihara H. Shibassaki Y. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11547-11554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as indicated in the figure legends. Generated radioactive products were detected by autoradiography. Lipid standards, run in parallel, were detected under UV light following spraying with 0.001% primulin. Following TLC separation of32P-labeled PI products, the radiolabeled spots on the plate corresponding to that identified on the autoradiogram were recovered and deacylated at 54 °C for 50 min with methylamine reagent essentially as described (28Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The deacylating reagent and the lower aqueous phase following the butanol/petroleum ether/ethyl formate extraction step were removed at 45–50 °C under blowing nitrogen, and drying was effected in the same manner by the addition of methanol (if directly analyzed by HPLC) or, for final drying before storage at −20 °C, a 3:1 (v/v) methanol:benzene mixture. The products were redissolved in 400 μl of water and filtered prior to injection of 100–200 μl on a Waters HPLC system (Millipore Corporation) equipped with a Waters model U6K Universal Injector, models 501 and 510 pumps, and a Waters System Interface Module controlled on-line with Baseline 810 (version 3.3) software run on an NEC PowerMate SX/16 personal computer (NEC Technologies, Inc.). Analyses were performed on a Whatman 235-mm (length) × 4.60-mm (inner diameter) column packed with 5-micron Partisphere SAX (H2PO42−) and eluted at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min under a slightly modified protocol (10Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 13Tolias K.F. Rameh L.E. Ishihara H. Shibassaki Y. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18040-18046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For analysis of PtdIns-P, elution was conducted with water for 5 min, and then water was diluted discontinuously and linearly with 1m ammonium phosphate buffer, pH 3.8, to 99% over 5 min, to 97% over 40 min, to 90% over 20 min, and finally with 90% for 20 min. For the higher phosphorylated PI, the gradient was as above up to the 70th min and was linearly increased thereafter to 13% buffer over 25 min and to 65% buffer over the next 25 min. [3H]GroPIns 4-P and [3H]GroPIns 4,5-P2 (deacylated from [3H]PtdIns 4-P and [3H]PtdIns 4,5-P2, respectively, as described above and stored in water at −20 °C) or [3H]GroPIns 5-P were co-injected as internal HPLC standards. Deacylated32P-labeled PI, prepared as discussed below, was also used as internal standards. Fractions were collected every 0.25 min, and their radioactivity was analyzed simultaneously for 3H- and 32P-labeled standard and products with 2.0 ml of ScintiVerse liquid scintillation mixture on a Packard TRI-CARB Model 4430 liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co., Inc.). We have observed an unexpected ability of p235 immune complexes derived from 3T3-L1 adipocytes or heterologously transfected COS cells to readily synthesize monophosphoinositides in an in vitro kinase assay (14Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, p235 shares homology with the predicted catalytic regions of enzymes with exclusive preference for prephosphorylated PtdIns substrates generating PIP2 or PIP3. To analyze p235 substrate specificity in more detail, we have now examined PI species phosphorylated to a different extent and at different positions as potential substrates for p235. We used p235 immune complexes derived from two cell types: 3T3-L1 adipocytes and transfected COS cells expressing an epitope-tagged version of p235. Antibodies explored in this study were raised against a GST fusion of a p235 N-terminal 100-amino acid segment. To demonstrate the specificity and the immunoprecipitating capacity of these antibodies for p235, an HA-tagged p235 expression vector or control vector was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA- or anti-p235 N-terminal-specific antibodies. Resultant immunocomplexes were subjected to Western blot analysis to verify that both antibodies recognize heterologously expressed p235. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, the immunocomplexes obtained with the anti-p235 N-terminal antibody contained a 180–190-kDa protein band that immunoblotted with both the anti-p235 N-terminal and anti-HA antibody. This is the expected migration position of p235 identified previously in our studies (14Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The p235 protein band was not detected in immunoprecipitates of control COS-7 cells (Fig. 1A). Importantly, the anti-p235 N-terminal and anti-HA antibodies immunoprecipitated p235 quantitatively and with equal efficiency, demonstrating significantly higher immunoprecipitating potency of the p235 N-terminal GST fusion antibody, compared with the anti-p235 C-terminal peptide-specific antibody used in our previous study (Fig. 1A and Ref. 14Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The immune complexes isolated from 3T3-L1 lysates on p235 N-terminal antibodies were subjected to a lipid kinase assay in the presence of PtdIns (natural or synthetic), PtdIns 3-P (synthetic), PtdIns 4-P (natural or synthetic), PtdIns 5-P (synthetic), PtdIns 3,4-P2 (synthetic), or PtdIns 4,5-P2 (natural or synthetic). TLC analysis revealed that, among them, only the PtdIns substrate preparation isolated from natural sources was readily utilized by the adipocytic p235 and was converted to two products. The first one migrated in the vicinity of PtdIns-P, whereas the second product, below the PtdIns 4,5-P2standard, was typically near the origin with a basic organic solvent system (Fig. 1B). The faint spots detected with the phosphorylated PtdIns substrates migrated in the vicinity of the PtdIns-4,5-P2 standard and below it were only slightly stronger than those seen with the control preimmune precipitates (Fig. 1B and data not shown). The immune complexes obtained from p235-transfected cells with anti-HA-antibodies demonstrated similar substrate specificity to the native adipocytic p235. As illustrated in Fig. 1C, anti-HA immunoprecipitates of the lysates from p235-transfected COS-7 cells displayed the ability to phosphorylate PtdIns but not the other substrates to an extent significantly higher than that observed with anti-HA-immunoprecipitates of control cells transfected with the empty vector. Here again, PtdIns was converted to two products that migrated in the region of PtdIns-P and below the PtdIns 4,5-P2 standards, respectively, upon TLC separation (Fig. 1C). Together, these results demonstrate that p235 displays a marked ability to utilize PtdIns under in vitroconditions typically used to examine the activity of other PI kinases. The results presented in Fig. 1, B and C, demonstrate that p235 displays a strong enzymatic activity to synthesize monophosphoinositides. However, the predicted catalytic region of p235 displays sequence homology to types of enzymes that demonstrate specificity toward position 4 or position 5 (type I, PI 5-Ks, and type II or PIP4-Ks; Refs. 2Loijens J.C.

One such molecule is vMIP-I, a C-C type chemokine of undefined function and binding specificity, encoded by the Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus HHV-8. We report here that vMIP-I binds to and induces cytosolic [Ca2+] signals in human T cells selectively through CCR8, a CC chemokine receptor associated with Th2 lymphocytes. Furthermore, using a panel of 65 different human, viral, and rodent chemokines, we have established a comprehensive ligand binding “fingerprint” for CCR8. The receptor exhibits marked “high” affinity (Kd < 15 nm) only for four chemokines, three of them of viral origin: vMIP-I, vMIP-II, vMCC-I, and human I-309. A previously unreported second class of lower affinity ligands includes MCP-3 and possibly two other viral chemokines. vMIP-I and I-309 appear to act as CCR8 agonists: binding to and inducing cytosolic [Ca2+] elevation through the receptor. By contrast, vMIP-II and vMCC-I act as potent antagonists: binding without inducing signaling, and blocking the effects of I-309 and vMIP-I. These results suggest a ligand hierarchy for CCR8, identifying vMIP-I as a selective viral chemokine agonist. CCR8 may thus engage a specific subset of chemokines with the potential to regulate each other during viral infection and immune regulation.

It has recently been appreciated that in addition to roles in regulating leukocyte trafficking, the chemokine system is intimately linked to the biology of infectious disease (1Weiss R. Nat.

Although the multiple biological activities of viral chemokine elements are likely to be directly related to pathogenesis, including enhanced dissemination of viral particles (9Boschoff C. Endo Y.

In two cases, viral chemokines have been shown to interact with a spectrum of host chemokine receptors, such as evidenced by the actions of HHV8-encoded vMIP-II (15Kledal T. Rosenkilde M. Coulin F.

Apart from the promiscuous binding patterns of vMIP-II and vMCC-I, the receptor interactions of other virally derived chemokines have not been fully characterized. As such they remain “orphan” chemokine ligands, analogous to putative chemokine receptor-like molecules for which no ligands have yet been identified. One such molecule is the HHV8-encoded vMIP-I protein (5Moore P. Boshoff C. Weiss R. Chang Y. Science. 1996; 274: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 8Nicholas J. Ruvolo V. Burns W.

Specifically, we have examined the activities of vMIP-I on primary human T cells and compared these actions to those from a spectrum of other human and human virus-encoded chemokines. We have also introduced comprehensive receptor profiling, using an array of over five dozen recombinant chemokines to define comprehensively the molecular recognition properties of CCR8. In so doing, we have identified that CCR8, which is known to bind human I-309 and is associated with human Th2 cells (18Roos R. Loetscher M. Legler D. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol.

Unlike vMIP-II, which is promiscuous in its binding profile, vMIP-I selectively engages CCR8. Moreover, whereas vMIP-II and vMCV-II are CCR8 antagonists, vMIP-I is, like I-309, a CCR8 agonist. Last, our comprehensive binding profile shows that other chemokines previously not known to bind to CCR8, such as MCP-3 and possibly two other viral chemokines, may engage the receptor at moderate to low affinities. Thus, an expanded ligand binding fingerprint for human CCR8 has been defined, and most chemokines that engage this receptor are of viral origin. These results suggest that human Th2 function may be a prime target of viruses through the actions of virally encoded chemokines. In particular, Th2 cells may be controlled through CCR8 by the actions vMIP-I, and these effects may be cross-regulated by other viral chemokines. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from buffy coats of healthy blood donors (Stanford blood bank) by density gradient on LSM (lymphocyte separation media) as described in the protocol of the manufacturer (ICN). Isolated PBMC were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin. PBMC were cultured (37 °C, 16 h) to allow monocytes to adhere. Nonadherent lymphocytes were transferred in suspension (initial density 106/ml), and subsequently cultured for 12–15 days (RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 1 ng/ml human recombinant IL-2 (R&D Systems), fed weekly). In all cases, the phenotype of the cultured cells was >90% CD3-positive (T cells), CD45RO-positive (mature T cells), CD14-negative (monocytes), CD20-negative (B cells), and CD45RA-negative (immature T cells). Other T cell population markers, CD4, CD8, CD56, and HLA-DR, demonstrated donor variability. Human CCR8 NSO transfected cells (R&D Systems) were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (supplemented with 5% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin). Human, viral, and murine recombinant chemokines were obtained from R&D Systems. 125 I-labeled I-309 was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. The monoclonal antibodies used in flow cytometry were from R&D Systems (MAB155 (CCR1); MAB150 (CCR2); MAB330 (CXCR1); MAB331 (CXCR2); MAB160 (CXCR3); MAB173 (CXCR4)), and from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (7B11 (CCR3), and 2D7 (CCR5)). We have recently developed a technique for global profiling of chemokine receptor/chemokine ligand interactions, designated DisplaceMax™. This technology employs expanded, efficiency-maximized radioligand binding utilizing filtration protocols (23Bacon K. Schall T.J. Dairaghi D.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1894-1900PubMed Google Scholar). In these assays, DisplaceMax™ employed the simultaneous interrogation of primary T cells or CCR8 transfectants by 65 distinct purified chemokines in the ability to displace radiolabeled I-309. Briefly, for each of the 65 chemokines, 5 × 105CCR8-NSO cells or 2 × 106 IL-2 cultured lymphocytes were incubated with 125 I-labeled I-309 (final concentration of ∼0.05 nm) in the presence of unlabeled chemokine (3 h at 4 °C: 25 mm HEPES, 140 mmNaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin, adjusted to pH 7.1). Reactions were aspirated onto PEI-treated GF/B glass filters using a cell harvester (Packard). Filters were washed twice (25 mmHEPES, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2 5 mm MgCl2, adjusted to pH 7.1). Scintillant (MicroScint 10; 35 μl) was added to dried filters and counted in a Packard Topcount scintillation counter. Data were analyzed and plotted using Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Flow cytometric analyses were performed using standard protocols. Briefly, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, resuspended at 2 × 105 cells per well in 96-well V-bottom plates (Costar) and incubated with the appropriate monoclonal antibody. They were washed three times and stained with the secondary antibody. The labeled cells were analyzed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson), and results presented have been gated for viable cells using light scattering. Calcium mobilization responses were performed as described previously using an intracellular ratiometric fluorescent dye, Indo-1 (24Dairaghi D.J. Oldham E. Bacon K. Schall T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28206-28209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Lymphocytes were loaded with Indo-1/AM (3 μm; Molecular Probes) in culture medium (40 min, 20 °C, 107 cells/ml). After dye loading, cells were washed (10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline) and resuspended (Hanks' buffered saline solution with 1% FBS, 107 cells/ml). Cytosolic [Ca2+]i was determined using excitation at 350 nm using a Photon Technology International fluorimeter (excitation at 350 nm, ratioed dual emission at 400 and 490 nm). Experiments were carried at 37 °C with constant mixing (106 cells; 25 mm HEPES, 140 mmNaCl, 2 mm CaCl2 5 mmMgCl2, adjusted to pH 7.1). To assess whether primary human immune cells were capable of being acted upon by virally encoded chemokines, we established individual cultures of IL2-treated lymphocytes, comprising primarily T cells (>90% by anti-CD3 staining using flow cytometry). The cell surface expression of functional chemokine receptors was assessed in these cell populations, using chemokine receptor antibodies where available and by establishing intracellular [Ca2+] signaling profiles in response to a panel of chemokines of characterized binding and signaling specificities. Direct measurement of the cell surface expression of chemokine receptors (as detected by specific antibodies and fluorescence-activated cell sorter) in cell cultures from multiple donors exhibited a consistent pattern. There was high expression of CCR5, CXCR3, and CXCR4, with mixed expression of CCR2; other chemokine receptors were consistently negative (Fig. 1A). Because the available panel of anti-chemokine receptor antibodies is sparse, however, we further characterized the presence and function of all known chemokine receptors on these cells by measuring intracellular [Ca2+] fluxes after chemokine challenge (Fig. 1B). These signaling patterns are completely consistent with the expression pattern seen by direct antibody detection,e.g. [Ca2+] signals are seen in response to MCP-1, -2, -3, and -4 (via CCR2) and CCR5, CXCR3, and CXCR4, with their respective ligands. In addition, the presence of CCR4, CCR6, CCR7, and CCR8 were inferred from the signaling profile (Fig. 1B). We challenged the cells with viral chemokines, two of which, vMIP-II and vMCC-I, have been reported to bind to multiple chemokine receptors. Despite their reported binding properties, neither induced an intracellular [Ca2+] response. Indeed, notably the only viral chemokine stimulating a response was the HHV8-encoded vMIP-I. This result indicated that vMIP-I had agonist activity for signaling; likely through one or more of the chemokine receptors expressed on T cells. Cross-desensitization of functional responses by chemokines has been routinely used to assess action at a shared receptor (10Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Thus, vMIP-I responses were systematically evaluated for cross-desensitization of [Ca2+] signals induced by the chemokines which were previously shown to stimulate the T cell responses represented in Fig. 1B. With a single exception, vMIP-I-induced [Ca2+] signaling failed to be desensitized by any of the chemokine-induced [Ca2+] responses, and vice versa. The one exception was with the CCR8-selective chemokine, I-309, where near total cross-desensitization of calcium responses was observed (Fig. 2). Control responses to SDF-1α (Fig. 2) and other chemokines (not shown) confirmed that the cross-desensitization was at the level of the CCR8 receptor only and not because of interactions with other chemokine receptors or post-receptor depletion of calcium stores. To rapidly and thoroughly define the ligand binding fingerprint of a given chemokine receptor, we have established an approach to comprehensively “interrogate” chemokine receptors using a large array of purified chemokines. We used this approach independently to confirm the interaction of vMIP-I with CCR8. Employing radioligand binding of 125 I-labeled I-309 to intact CCR8 stable transfectants, chemokine specificity for CCR8 was exhaustively determined. All known chemokines which can be obtained in purified form were used as cold competitors (initially at a saturating final concentration of 200 nm), against 125 I-labeled I-309 in binding experiments. The displacement data, expressed in Fig. 3, showed intriguingly that the only potent chemokine interactions for human CCR8 other than human I-309 were the viral chemokines vMIP-I, vMIP-II, and vMCC-I. Moreover, the power of this screening approach was highlighted by the emergence of a potential second class of lower affinity chemokine competitors, including MCP-3 and possibly vMIP-III and vCXC-I (Fig. 3). The binding interactions identified in the primary screening were examined quantitatively by radioligand binding competition to CCR8 stable transfectants and Scatchard transformation of the displacement data (Fig. 4A, and inset). The results confirmed the high affinity binding (of greater affinity than apparent Ki ∼ 15 nm) of I-309 and the viral chemokines in the rank order I-309 > vMCC-I > vMIP-I > vMIP-II. The binding results were very similar in human lymphocytes (Fig. 4B), with IC50 values that were closely aligned between the two cell populations (Fig. 4C). The class of potential moderate to low affinity ligands exhibited affinities roughly between Ki ∼ 50 to ∼ 250 nm. These included chemokines not previously reported to bind to CCR8: MCP-3, Ki ∼ 80 nm; and two viral chemokines, vCXC1 and vMIP-III, each ofKi ∼ 250 nm (data not shown). The physiologic significance of these lower affinity interactions has not been investigated. The HHV8-encoded chemokine vMIP-II has been previously reported as having either agonist or antagonist activities on specific chemokine receptors (9Boschoff C. Endo Y. Collins P. Takeuchi Y.

Blood. 1998; 92: 4036-4039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas vMCC-I has been previously reported as a broadly acting chemokine receptor antagonist (16Damon I. Murphy P. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6403-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To assess the interactions of the high affinity CCR8 ligands I-309, vMIP-I, vMIP-II, and vMCC-I, we performed a series of signaling cross-desensitization experiments using various combinations of these chemokines. While vMIP-I and I-309 consistently showed agonist activity, triggering [Ca2+] responses in T cells, neither vMIP-II nor vMCC-I induced a [Ca2+] response. In fact, challenging the T cells first with 100 nm of either vMIP-II and vMCC-I revealed that these viral chemokines exhibited direct CCR8 antagonist activity, such that the subsequent responses to both I-309 and vMIP-I were blocked (Fig. 5A). Thorough dose responses were obtained, defining to what extent this inhibition could be overcome by increased concentrations of I-309 or vMIP-I (Fig. 5B). The profiles strongly suggest competitive antagonism by vMCC-I and vMIP-II of the actions of I-309 and vMIP-I. Details regarding the molecular recognition of host chemokine receptors by the HHV8-encoded chemokine vMIP-I have not previously been elucidated. This study investigated the ability of vMIP-I and other viral chemokines to induce intracellular Ca2+ signaling in human T cells, and sought to define the ligand binding specificity of vMIP-I among endogenous chemokine receptors. Through comprehensive chemokine signaling and binding “profiling,” we have shown on both human T cells and chemokine receptor transfectants that vMIP-I selectively engages the Th2-associated chemokine receptor CCR8 with high affinity. The interaction of vMIP-I with CCR8 appears very selective in that signaling-desensitization experiments demonstrated cross-desensitization only with I-309. Thus, like I-309 (18Roos R. Loetscher M.

Data presented here support concepts in the literature regarding the action of I-309 and vMCC-I on CCR8, but do not substantiate the notion that CCR8 also engages MIP-1β and TARC as functional ligands (26Bernadini G. Hedrick J. Sozzani S. Luini W. Spinetti G. Weiss M. Menon S. Zlotnick A. Montovani A. Santoni A. Napolitano M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the assignment of those ligands was based not on direct biochemical binding and signaling analyses of CCR8 and its putative ligands but rather on a gain-of-function assay in Jurkat cells. In that study, Jurkat cells appeared to become chemotactically responsive to MIP-1β and TARC after CCR8 transfection (26Bernadini G. Hedrick J. Sozzani S. Luini W. Spinetti G. Weiss M. Menon S. Zlotnick A. Montovani A. Santoni A. Napolitano M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The data presented here suggest the possibility that the gain of migratory function may have been connected to, or perhaps coincident with, transfection or CCR8 introduction but are not directly a consequence of CCR8 binding functions. It is also notable that despite a report that binds multiple chemokine receptors (16Damon I. Murphy P. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6403-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we observe significant selectivity of vMCC-I for CCR8. In addition to excluding some ligands as potentially acting directly through CCR8, the definition of a comprehensive ligand binding fingerprint for this receptor suggests that it may interact also with MCP3 and possibly two additional viral chemokines, vMIP-III and vCXC-I. These interactions are apt to occur at much more modest affinity constants than those of the high affinity CCR8 ligands vMIP-I, I-309, vMIP-II, and vMCC-I. Additional studies are necessary to determine whether this class of lower affinity interactions is of physiological relevance. The downstream consequences of activation of CCR8 by vMIP-I are not yet established, but to date we have found little or no chemotactic activity of either I-309 or vMIP-I in IL2-treated T cells (data not shown). This is despite the fact that these ligands induce robust cytoplasmic [Ca2+] responses in functional T cells from multiple donors and despite the fact that the same cells respond robustly to SDF-1 in both [Ca2+] signals and in migration. One intriguing possibility is suggested from the action of I-309 on murine T cell lymphomas, where the human chemokine seems to protect the cells from dexamethasone-induced apoptosis (27Van Snick J. Houssiau F. Proost P. Van Damme J. Renauld J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2570-2576PubMed Google Scholar). We are currently testing whether vMIP-I may regulate the survival of T lymphocytes through CCR8 as inhibition of apoptosis may be a highly desirable function for a herpesvirus such as HHV8, which typically achieves long-lasting latency in infected cells. It is also important to note that the ability of I-309 or vMIP-I to act as chemoattractants in vivo may be very different. For example, in T cells CCR8 expression is biased toward selective, if not exclusive, expression in anti-inflammatory Th2 subpopulation (21D'Ambrosio D. Iellem A. Bonecchi R. Mazzeo D. Sozzani S. Montovani A. Sinigaglia F. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5111-5115PubMed Google Scholar,22Zingoni A. Soto H. Hedrick A. Stoppacciaro A. Storlazzi C. Sinigaglia F. D'Ambrosio D. O'Garra A. Robinson D.

Blood. 1998; 92: 4036-4039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) although it has been interpreted to proceed through an action of vMIP-II, rather than vMIP-I, on the CCR8 receptor. Consequently, the in vivo effects of vMIP-I, or other viral chemokines, may not be predicted completely from receptor interactions only. Nevertheless, the chemokine binding fingerprint of CCR8 elucidated here raises intriguing questions regarding the seeming predilection on the part of viral chemokines for targeting this receptor. It is interesting to speculate that some special advantage is conferred to human viruses via manipulation of CCR8, possibly through skewing of Th1/Th2 responses in a virally infected host. In short, comprehensive chemokine profiling provides a novel tool in defining the recognition specificity and functional cross-talk of ligands for chemokine receptors such as CCR8. The definition of vMIP-I as a functional agonist for CCR8, and one which is potentially cross-regulated by other viral chemokines, may provide new insight into the function of viral chemokines and of Th2 cells during infection and immune regulation.

It has long been known that glycerol transport across the plasma membrane of the red blood cell is mediated by a pore and that the transport mechanism is inhibited at low pH (8Stein W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 59: 47-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 9Carlsen A. Wieth J.O. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1976; 97: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recently it was established that AQP3 is involved in glycerol transport in the red blood cell (10Roudier N. Verbavatz J.-M. Maurel C. Riproche P. Tacnet F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8407-8412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This raises the questions of whether glycerol transport in AQP3 is gated by H+ and whether water transport through AQP3 and other AQPs is also sensitive to H+.We have previously applied a fast and high resolution optical method to determine the transport properties of AQPs expressed inXenopus oocytes (6Meinild A.-K. Klaerke D.A. Zeuthen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32446-32451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Here we combine this method with tracer measurements in order to study the effects of H+, temperature, and solute structure on transport of water, glycerol, and other straight chain polyols. The study is performed predominantly in AQP3, but also in AQP0, AQP1, AQP2, AQP4, and AQP5.At present, transport models are restricted to the use of macrophysical concepts such as pore diameter and pore length. This is mainly due to the lack of knowledge about the structure of the putative pore and the nature of the chemical interactions with the permeating molecules (11Finkelstein A. Water Movement through Lipid Bilyers, Pores and Plasma Membranes. Wiley-Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar,12Hill A.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 137: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our data for AQP3 suggest a model where the permeation of water and polyols are determined by the formation of hydrogen bonds between the pore and the permeating molecule. From a physiological point of view, it is interesting that both the glycerol and the water transport through the AQP3 exhibited a strong, immediate, and reversible pH dependence. Such short term and direct gating of transport is a novel feature of aquaporins.MATERIALS AND METHODSDetails of the preparation of mRNA, the preparation and injection of Xenopus oocytes, and the set-up forLp and ς measurements have been described in detail previously (6Meinild A.-K.

(Lond.). 1998; 508.1: 15-21Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). For measurements of the water permeability (Lp) and reflection coefficients (ς) oocytes were placed in a chamber (30 μl) in which solution changes could be accomplished within 5 s (90% complete). The oocytes were stabilized by the insertion of two microelectrodes, which also recorded the membrane potential. The presence of the microelectrodes did not affect the measurements (6Meinild A.-K. Klaerke D.A. Zeuthen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32446-32451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 14Meinild A.-K. Klaerke D.A. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. Zeuthen T. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508.1: 15-21Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Oocyte volumes were monitored on-line with an accuracy of 0.03% equal to about 0.4 nl, via an inverted microscope connected to a charge coupled device camera.Lp and ς were obtained from the initial rate of volume decrease induced by the addition of 20 mosmol of test solute to the control bathing solution. The ς of a given polyol was obtained from the ratio between the volume changes induced by the polyol and mannitol. The control bathing solution contained in mm: 90 NaCl, 20 mosmol of mannitol, 2 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES or MES, osmolarity 214 mosmol; pH was adjusted according to the type of experiment. Test solutions were obtained by adding 20 mm mannitol or one of the following straight chain polyols (mole weights and boiling points (°C), respectively, in parentheses): ethylene glycol, EG (62, 197); 1,2-propanediol, PD (76, 187); glycerol, Gl (92, 193); 1,2-butandiol, B12 (90, 192); 1,3-butandiol, B13 (90, 204); 1,4-butandiol, B14 (90, 230); 2,3-butandiol, B23 (90, 184); 1,2-pentandiol, P12 (104, 206); 1,4-pentandiol, P14 (104, not detected); 1,5-pentandiol, P15 (104, 242), and 2,4-pentandiol, P24 (104, 201); the structures are indicated in Fig. 1B. The isotonic test solution was obtained by replacing 20 mosmol of mannitol in the control solution by 20 mosmol of glycerol.The glycerol permeability, PGl, was derived from [14C]glycerol uptakes. The oocytes were equilibrated for at least 2.5 min in the given test solution before being transferred for 0.5–10 min to 3 ml of the stirred test solution to which 4 μCi ml−1 [14C]glycerol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, code CFB 174, ethanol-free) had been added. To terminate uptake, oocytes were washed twice in ice-cold medium and transferred to scintillation vials, incubated for approximately 1 h at room temperature with 1 ml of 20% SDS before addition of 15 ml of scintillation fluid (Packard Opti-Fluor), and counting in a scintillation counter (Packard Tri-Carb).The Lp and PGl were analyzed as functions of external pH by fitting to a Boltzmann function: exp[(pH − pK)/ΔH]/(1 + exp[(pH − pK)/ΔH]). ΔH is a measure of the steepness of the curve around pK and is related to the Hill coefficient n = d(logLp)/d(pH) via n = 1/(2.3 ΔH).A phenomenological analysis of the volume and solute fluxes and the coupling between them was obtained from irreversible thermodynamics (15Katchalsky A. Curran P.F. Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics in Biophysics. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA1965Crossref Google Scholar), with glycerol as an example,JV=−A*R*T*Lp*(ΔCi+ςGl*ΔCGl)Equation 1 JGl=A*R*T*PGl*ΔCGl+JV*CGl′*(1−ςGl)Equation 2 where JV is the volume flow, determined from the initial rate of change in oocyte volume. JGlis the flux of glycerol, determined from tracer uptake. A is the true oocyte surface area: with an average diameter of 1.35-mm, oocytes have an apparent surface area of 5.9 mm2. Folding of the membrane increases this area by a factor of nine (16Zampighi G.A. Kreman M. Boorer K.J. Loo D.D.F. Bezanilla F. Chandy G. Hall J.E. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) to give the true surface area A = 0.53 cm2.R is the gas constant and T the absolute temperature. ΔCi is the transmembrane concentration difference of impermeable solutes such as mannitol; ΔCGl is the difference in glycerol concentration. CGl′ is the average concentration of glycerol in the aqueous pore. The coupling between the solute and volume fluxes in the aquaporin can be characterized by ς (Equations 10–56 in Ref. 15Katchalsky A. Curran P.F. Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics in Biophysics. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA1965Crossref Google Scholar),ςGl=1−R*T*PGl*(Δx/ϕw)*fswEquation 3 where Δx/ϕw is a constant that gives the ratio of the membrane thickness to the volume fraction of water,fsw is a formal frictional factor that gives the coupling between the solute (glycerol) and water in the pore. Changes in ς, which arise from partial molar volume effects, are ignored because they were too small to affect the measured values. It follows that a ς significantly smaller than 1 is evidence for interaction between solute and water and that 1 − ςGl is proportional to the glycerol permeability, PGl, times the friction, fsw. We will refer to this term as the interaction and relate Arrhenius activation energies (Ea) to this.The parameters presented have been corrected for the fluxes taking place via the membrane of the native oocytes. All numbers are given as means ± S.E., unless otherwise stated the number in parentheses is the number of experiments in at least four oocytes.DISCUSSIONAQP3 has been found to act as a channel for both water and glycerol transport. The fluxes are linear functions of their respective chemical driving forces (3Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Saito H. Furukawa T. Nakajima K. Yamaguchi M. Gojobori T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32446-32451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Our data show that the transports are gated by H+. In principle, three simultaneously active groups of titratable sites could be responsible for this behavior: one group in which titration led to closure of the channel(s), another that controlled theLp, and finally one that controlled thePGl. We will discuss the simplest possibility: that these groups are, at least partially, identical.Mechanisms and Coupling of Water and Glycerol FluxesThe behavior of AQP3 cannot be interpreted in terms of a physical pore. AQP3 remained open to glycerol transport in the pH range 5.8–6.2 while being closed for the smaller water molecule. The data can be interpreted by means of an Eyring energy barrier model (18Glasstone S. Laidler K.J. Eyring H. The Theory of Rate Processes. McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc, New York1941Google Scholar). On this model, the molecule permeates by a series of jumps, the energy barriers of which are determined by the chemical bonds between the molecule and specific sites in the pathway. For AQP3, the Ea forLp was low, around 5 kcal mol−1, which suggests that the water molecule at neutral pH crosses this aquaporin by forming a succession of single hydrogen bonds. TheLp exhibited an immediate and reversible dependence on external pH (Fig. 2, A and B), under steady state conditions the Lp depended in a sigmoidal manner on external pH with a pK of 6.4 and a Hill coefficient of about 3. This suggests that at least three cooperating titratable sites determine the Lp. In the simplest, but not the only, model these sites are located in the aqueous pathway and determine the energy barriers for water permeation. Titration of the sites would abolish their hydrogen bonding capacity and render them effectively hydrophobic. In analogy to the Lp, thePGl had low activation energy and a marked dependence on external pH. But the pK was lower, 6.1, and the Hill coefficient larger, about 6 (Fig. 3B). This would suggest that glycerol also permeates by forming successive hydrogen bonds, the Hill coefficient indicates at least six.The difference between pK values and Hill coefficients raises the question whether it is the same titratable groups that determine the Lp and PGl. We suggest it is and that the difference arises from two effects. First, glycerol with its three —OH groups might have to make and break more hydrogen bonds than water in order to cross the aquaporin; this would lead to a higher Hill coefficient. Second, the pK for glycerol transport could be shifted due to a competitive interaction between H+ and glycerol at the sites. Such competition has been described in intact human red blood cells (9Carlsen A. Wieth J.O. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1976; 97: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) where glycerol transport is mediated by AQP3 (10Roudier N. Verbavatz J.-M. Maurel C. Riproche P. Tacnet F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8407-8412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In these cells pK forPGl was about 6.0 at external glycerol concentrations of 1 mm and 5.5 at external glycerol concentrations of 2 m. In addition, the Hill coefficients were estimated to be larger than 2 (9Carlsen A. Wieth J.O. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1976; 97: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These values are in agreement with those of the present study where glycerol concentrations of 20 mm were employed. It appears that glycerol, when close to the titratable site, to a certain extent displaces water molecules, an effect that would be enhanced by the confinement of the pore. The resulting lower molar fraction of water near the site would result in a lower local H+ concentration and consequently in a decrease of the effective pK. The hypothesis of a pathway shared by water and glycerol in AQP3 is supported by the finding that ςGl doubled when external pH was lowered to 6.4. This shows that the pathways for water and glycerol has at least one titratable site in common with a pK around 6.4. Titration reduces the availability of this site, and the interaction between the fluxes is reduced. At sufficiently acid pH values both water and glycerol would be unable to cross the channel. The fact that ς for formamide also doubled at pH 6.4 supports the notion that it is the —OH groups of the solute rather than its backbone that is responsible for interaction.Our model suggest a mechanism of how another member of the major integral protein family, the glycerol facilitator GlpF, can act as a glycerol channel without letting through water (19Maurel C. Reizer J. Schroeder J.I. Chrispeels M.J. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11869-11872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the pore of GlpF had a titratable site that was protonated at normal pH, it would be hydrophobic and in effect prevent the passage of water. If the site allowed competitive interaction between glycerol and H+ as described above, the glycerol molecule would be able to remove the H+ and use the site for transport.The model is not directly applicable to AQP0, AQP1, AQP2, AQP4, and AQP5, since they did not exhibit any pH sensitivity. One possibility is that the sites responsible for Lp in these aquaporins are not accessible to H+. AQP1 has a small but significant permeability to glycerol (6Meinild A.-K. Klaerke D.A. Zeuthen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32446-32451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 20Abrami L. Tacnet F. Riproche P.

Pflügers Arch. 1996; 431: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the ς values for the smaller polyols, EG and PD, were of the same size as that of glycerol. This shows that although these polyols interacts with water in AQP1, some structural incompatibility, not found in AQP3, prevents them from permeating at any larger rate.The Role of Polyol CompositionIn general the ς values for AQP3 increased with the number of —OH groups and number of carbons of the test solute (Fig. 1B). The importance of —OH groups available for hydrogen bonding was particularly clear when ς values of the butanols B12, B13, B14, and B23 were compared. For these polyols the location and intramolecular interactions of the two —OH groups had significant specific effects on ς values. The ς values were larger if the two —OH groups were located next to each other and engaged in intramolecular bonding (ςB23 > ςB12 > ςB13 ≅ ςB14). The extent of intramolecular bonding was mirrored by the boiling points, which were lower for B12 and B23 than for B13 and B14. The —OH groups in B12 and B23 were therefore not available for interaction with the sites in the aquaporin to the same degree as the —OH groups of B13 and B14. This would result in smaller fluxes (smaller P) and/or smaller frictions with the water (smaller fsw) and therefore in larger ς values for B23 and B12 (Equation 3). The effects of the locations of the —OH groups on ς were absent for the pentanols. Most likely the longer carbon chain mitigate the strength of intramolecular bonding between —OH groups as witnessed by the small variations between the boiling points among this group.The picture that emerges is one where the test molecules, viewed as cylinders of different lengths and roughly similar diameters, cross the pore of AQP3 with their axis parallel to the pore. During permeation the —OH groups of the solute form a succession of single hydrogen bonds with the aquaporin as indicated by the low activation energies of around 5 kcal mol−1 observed forJGl, 1 − ςGl, 1 − ςB12, and 1 − ςB23.Comparison with Other StudiesThe numerical values for the transport parameters derived here and in an earlier paper (6Meinild A.-K.

The oocytes in the present study had more negative membrane potentials, on average −43 mV compared with the −25 mV in the previous study. As ςGlwas found to increase with acidity, we suggest that the oocytes used previously, being more stressed, might have had a more acid intracellular pH.Relation between Primary Structure and Permeation in AQP3The ability of AQP3 to transport both water and larger solutes is shared by AQP7 (24Ishibashi K.

Functionally, this places these three aquaporins in between those members of the major integral protein family that transport predominantly water (i.e. AQP0, AQP1, AQP2, AQP4, AQP5) and those that are impermeable to water,i.e. the glycerol facilitator GlpF (19Maurel C. Reizer J. Schroeder J.I. Chrispeels M.J. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11869-11872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the unique dependence of AQP3 on pH, titratable residues common for AQP3 and the water transporting aquaporins may not be relevant to explain the transport properties, while homology with the glycerol transporting aquaporins may be more important. If single residues are focused upon, an obvious guess for the titratable sites would be histidines, which qua their imidazole ring have pK values of 6.0–7.0 when incorporated into proteins. Other candidates with hydrophilic side groups are aspartate and glutamate residues, which may have pK values as high as 7 in proteins. All three amino acid residues are known to participate in hydrogen bonding (23Creighton T.E. Proteins. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1993: 15Google Scholar).Interestingly, specific structural changes in aquaporins have been shown recently to cause shifts from water to glycerol permeation (26Lagrée V.

The reduction of the Lp of AQP3 by H+suggests that these tissues under anaerobic conditions protect themselves against excessive cellular swelling by a reduction of the passive water permeability. The lower pK forPGl than for Lp shows that the cells strive to retain their capacity for glycerol uptake under acidosis.

The peptides were presented inside cells as peptamers, surface loops on a highly expressed and biologically inert carrier protein, a catalytically inactive derivative of staphylococcal nuclease. Peptamers that inhibited the pheromone signaling pathway, transcriptional silencing, and the spindle checkpoint were isolated. Putative targets for the inhibitors were identified by a combination of two-hybrid analysis and genetic dissection of the target pathways. This analysis identified Ydr517w as a component of the spindle checkpoint and reinforced earlier indications that Ste50 has both positive and negative roles in pheromone signaling. Analysis of transcript arrays showed that the peptamers were highly specific in their effects, which suggests that they may be useful reagents in organisms that lack sophisticated genetics as well as for identifying components of existing biological pathways that are potential targets for drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2068015921,"Gaucher disease is a glycosphingolipid storage disease caused by defects in the activity of the lysosomal hydrolase, glucocerebrosidase (GlcCerase), resulting in accumulation of glucocerebroside (glucosylceramide, GlcCer) in lysosomes.

We now demonstrate that upon incubation with a chemical inhibitor of GlcCerase, conduritol-B-epoxide (CBE), cultured hippocampal neurons accumulate GlcCer. Surprisingly, increased levels of tubular endoplasmic reticulum elements, an increase in [Ca2+]i response to glutamate, and a large increase in [Ca2+]i release from the endoplasmic reticulum in response to caffeine were detected in these cells. There was a direct relationship between these effects and GlcCer accumulation since co-incubation with CBE and an inhibitor of glycosphingolipid synthesis, fumonisin B1, completely antagonized the effects of CBE. Similar effects on endoplasmic reticulum morphology and [Ca2+]istores were observed upon incubation with a short-acyl chain, nonhydrolyzable analogue of GlcCer, C8-glucosylthioceramide. Finally, neurons with elevated GlcCer levels were much more sensitive to the neurotoxic effects of high concentrations of glutamate than control cells; moreover, this enhanced toxicity was blocked by pre-incubation with ryanodine, suggesting that [Ca2+]i release from ryanodine-sensitive intracellular stores can induce neuronal cell death, at least in neurons with elevated GlcCer levels.

Mutations in the human GlcCerase gene cause a reduction in GlcCerase activity and accumulation of GlcCer, which results in Gaucher disease, the most common lysosomal storage disease (1Beutler E. Grabowski G.A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Diseases. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2641-2670Google Scholar). As for all lysosomal storage diseases, significant clinical heterogeneity is observed in Gaucher disease, with three main types known, varying from a chronic non-neuronopathic type (type 1) to infantile (type 2) and juvenile (type 3) neuronopathic types (2Barranger J.A. Ginns E.I. Glucosylceramide Lipidoses: Gaucher Disease. 6th Ed. McGraw Hill Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). The acute neuronopathic type of the disease is characterized by severe loss of neurons in the central nervous system and early onset of the disease (1Beutler E. Grabowski G.A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Diseases. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2641-2670Google Scholar). A molecular explanation for the neuronal dysfunction associated with neuronopathic forms of Gaucher disease is currently lacking, and no neurotoxic agent has been identified. In the current study, we have analyzed the effects of treating cultured hippocampal neurons with an active site-directed inhibitor of GlcCerase, conduritol-B-epoxide (CBE) (3Legler G. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 46: 368-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that GlcCer accumulates in neurons upon CBE treatment, resulting in changes in axonal morphology, with an increase in the length of the axon plexus and in the number of axonal branch points per cell (4Schwarz A.

Brain Res. 1998; 108: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Co-incubation with CBE and inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis (i.e.fumonisin B1 (FB1), an inhibitor of acylation of sphingoid long-chain bases (6Merrill A.H. Liotta D.C. Riley R. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 218-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar)), antagonizes the effects of CBE, and FB1 itself reduces the rate of axonal growth (4Schwarz A.

We now demonstrate that in addition to these morphological changes, GlcCer accumulation causes changes in neuronal functionality, inasmuch as neurons show increased levels of tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) elements, a large increase in [Ca2+]i release from the ER in response to glutamate or caffeine stimulation, and are more sensitive to glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. This is the first time that changes in neuronal functionality have been reported in neurons with elevated GlcCer levels and may help unravel the mechanisms that lead to neuronopathic forms of Gaucher disease. Hippocampal neurons were cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips essentially as described (4Schwarz A. Rapaport E. Hirschberg K. Futerman A.H. J. Biol.

Briefly, the dissected hippocampi of embryonic day 18 rats (Wistar), obtained from the Weizmann Institute Breeding Center, were dissociated by trypsinization (0.25% w/v, for 15 min at 37 °C). The tissue was washed in Mg2+/Ca2+-free Hank's balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) and dissociated by repeated passage through a constricted Pasteur pipette. For biochemical analysis, cells were plated in minimal essential medium with 10% horse serum at a density of 240,000 cells/24-mm poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslip. For morphological analysis, neurons were plated at a density of 6,000 cells/13-mm coverslip. After 3–4 h, coverslips were transferred into 100-mm Petri dishes or 24-well Multidishes that contained a monolayer of astroglia. Coverslips were placed with the neurons facing downwards and were separated from the glia by paraffin “feet.” Cultures were maintained in serum-free minimal essential medium that included N2 supplements (9Goslin K. Asmussen H. Banker G. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 339-370Google Scholar), ovalbumin (0.1%, w/v), and pyruvate (0.1 mm). Neuronal cultures were incubated with CBE (200 μm) or FB1 (50 μm) prepared as stock solutions in 20 mmHepes buffer, pH 7.4 (4Schwarz A. Rapaport E. Hirschberg K. Futerman A.H. J. Biol.

The intracellular distribution of N-[5-(5, 7-dimethylbodipy)-1-pentanoyl]-d-erythro-glucosylsphingosine (C5-DMB-GlcCer) was determined by incubating neurons for 24 h at 37 °C with C5-DMB-GlcCer, prepared as an equimolar complex with defatted bovine serum albumin (12Martin O.C. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), prior to removal of cell surface-associated C5-DMB-GlcCer by incubating cells for 4 × 10 min with bovine serum albumin (1% w/v) at 16 °C (“back-exchange” (12Martin O.C.

Pütz U. Schwarzmann G. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 276: 289-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), was determined similarly. Neurons were examined using a Plan Apochromat 40×/1.3 oil objective of a Zeiss Axiovert 35 microscope with an appropriate fluorescence filter. Neurons cultured at high density were incubated with 5 × 106 cpm of [3H]dihydrosphingosine (10 Ci/mmol) (14Hirschberg K. Rodger J. Futerman A.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) for 6 h immediately after plating. After various times, [3H]GSLs were extracted and analyzed (15Hirschberg K.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14876-14882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and levels of [3H]sphingolipids and [3H]GSLs were quantified. Upon metabolism of [4,5-3H]dihydroceramide to [3H]ceramide, we assume that 50% of the3H-labeled radioactivity is lost because of dehydrogenation of the 4,5-double bond; this was taken into account when quantifying [3H]GSL synthesis, as described previously (15Hirschberg K.

The ER was labeled in live or fixed cells with 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiO) (16Korkotian E. Segal M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1670-1682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lee C. Chen L.B.

The dye was applied at a final concentration of 0.25 mg/ml for 3–5 min to living cells and for 10 min to fixed cells and then was washed extensively. Fluorescence intensities for different groups of fixed cells were collected and averaged. Single optical sections at the Z axes distance of 1 μm were taken, and cells were three-dimensional reconstructed. Immunofluorescence localization of the ryanodine receptor (RR) was performed by incubating fixed cells (4% formaldehyde) with an anti-RR antibody (provided by Dr. V. Shoshan-Barmatz, Ben Gurion University, Israel) that cross-reacts with both skeletal muscle and brain RR (18Shoshan-Barmatz V. Ashley R.H. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 183: 185-270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were imaged by confocal microscopy (see below). Fluorescence intensities for both DiO and RR were quantified by analyzing total cell body fluorescence using NIH Image software. 3–7-day-old cultures were washed and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 3 μmfluo-3 AM (Molecular Probes) in recording medium (129 mmNaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 4.2 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 0.5 μm tetradotoxin, with osmolarity adjusted to 320 mosm by addition of sucrose). Neurons were washed in recording medium and placed on the stage of a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica, Heidelberg) and superfused with the recording medium at a rate of 3–5 ml/min at room temperature. Glutamate (0.1 mm) or caffeine (5–10 mm) was prepared in recording medium and applied through a pressure pipette with a tip diameter of 2 μm, placed approximately 50 μm from the cells. Averages of 4 images per second were stored for later analysis. Laser light intensity was set to 5% of the maximum. Images were analyzed with Leica and NIH Image software. Neurons (plated at a density of 25,000 cells/well) were incubated with various inhibitors or lipids for 4 days, prior to application of 10 mm glutamate for 1 h. Live and dead cells were distinguished using 2 μmcalcein acetoxymethyl ester and 4 μm ethidium homodimer-1, respectively, as described in a Live/Dead®viability/cytotoxicity kit (Molecular Probes). In some experiments, neurons were pre-treated with ryanodine for 1 h prior to application of glutamate. Neurons (plated at a density of 100,00 cells/well) were incubated with or without 200 μm CBE for 4 days. Coverslips were then washed in Ca2+-free medium (minimal essential medium containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.3), 4 mm NaHCO3, 11 mg/ml pyruvic acid, 1 mm glutamine, and 0.6% (w/v) glucose (19Sofer A. Schwarzmann G. Futerman A.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2111-2119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), and transferred to a new multi-well dish containing the same medium but not containing a glia monolayer. After 25 min at 37 °C, neurons were incubated with the calcium ionophore A23187 (1 μm) (20Deber C.M. Hsu L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 731-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and in some cases with thapsigargin (0.1 μm) (an inhibitor of Ca2+ uptake into the ER (21Wells K.M. Abercrombie R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5020-5025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)), for 5 min, prior to addition of 1 μCi45Ca2+ (18.8 mCi/mg, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK) for various times at 37 °C (22Fields A. Gafni Y. Oron Y. Sarne Y. Brain Res. 1995; 687: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by removing coverslips from the wells, washed by dipping five times in medium, and then adding 0.65 ml of NaOH (0.5m) for 3 h. 45Ca2+ was quantitatively extracted by adding NaOH for 16 h and then for another 2 h.

After 4 and 9 days, [3H]GSLs were extracted and analyzed. To determine the intracellular site of GlcCer accumulation after CBE-treatment, neurons were incubated with a short acyl chain fluorescent derivative of GlcCer, C5-DMB-GlcCer (12Martin O.C. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In CBE-treated neurons, C5-DMB-GlcCer accumulated mainly in lysosomes, which appear as discrete puncta located in the perikarya and dendrites (Fig. 1b), as observed in previous studies in hippocampal neurons using short acyl chain fluorescent GSL analogues (19Sofer A. Schwarzmann G. Futerman A.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2111-2119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In control cells, C5-DMB-GlcCer was extensively hydrolyzed to C5-DMB-ceramide during a 24-h incubation (not shown), as observed in nonneuronal cells (12Martin O.C. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 25Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Kang H.C. Haugland R.P. J.

Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12117-12122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We next examined the intracellular morphology of neurons treated with CBE for various times in culture. Upon incubation with DiO, a generic marker of the ER (16Korkotian E. Segal M. J.

Cell. 1988; 54: 37-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), CBE-treated neurons showed significantly more tubular ER elements (Fig. 2, aand b). No nuclear labeling was observed, but the density of labeling of ER elements above the nucleus was significantly higher in CBE-treated cells (Fig. 2b), resulting in a marked (∼3-fold) increase in ER density compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3a). No effects on ER morphology were observed upon incubation with FB1, but the increased levels of DiO-labeling of the ER induced by CBE was blocked by co-incubation with CBE and FB1 (Fig. 3a).Figure 3Quantification of ER-labeling. Neurons were incubated with CBE, CBE and FB1, or GSC (C8-Glc-S-Cer), from days 0–4 in culture, and images were collected as in Fig. 2. Average fluorescent intensities, quantified for at least 20 cells for each treatment, are shown for DiO-labeled (a) and for RR-labeled neurons (b).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The increase in ER density was confirmed using an antibody to the RR, a calcium channel located in the ER of hippocampal neurons (27Korkotian E. Segal M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 2076-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Incubation with either CBE or with a nonhydrolyzable analogue of GlcCer (C8-Glc-S-Cer) (11Schwarzmann G. Hofmann P. Pütz T. Albrecht B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21271-21276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Albrecht B. Pütz U. Schwarzmann G. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 276: 289-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), resulted in an increase in RR labeling in a perinuclear region of the neurons, corresponding to the ER (Fig. 2, c and d). Quantification of labeling intensity demonstrated an ∼2-fold increase in RR density on the ER after incubation with either CBE or C8-Glc-S-Cer (Fig. 3b). Moreover, preliminary analysis by electron microscopy revealed an increase in the surface density of the ER in CBE-treated neurons after a 5-day incubation (3.29 ± 0.98 ER intersections per μm test line in control cells compared with 4.79 ± 1.29 ER intersections per μm test line in CBE-treated neurons). 2H. Shogomori and A. H. Futerman, unpublished observations. We next examined the functionality of increased levels of ER elements and of the RR. Initially, the responses of control and CBE-treated cells to glutamate were examined. Following a pulsed application of glutamate, there was a typical increase in fluo-3 AM fluorescence that peaked after about 2–3 s and decayed back to control levels within 15–20 s (Fig. 4), as previously observed (16Korkotian E. Segal M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1670-1682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In CBE-treated cells, the peak response to glutamate was 63% larger than that of control cells (Fig. 4). To examine if this larger response to glutamate is related to changes in calcium stores, we used caffeine, a more selective releaser of calcium from stores (27Korkotian E. Segal M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 2076-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Caffeine caused a transient increase in free [Ca2+]i(Fig. 5, a and b), which recovered back to base-line levels within 10–20 s in control cells (Fig. 6). A 3-fold increase in the magnitude of the [Ca2+]i response to caffeine was recorded in cells incubated with CBE for 4 days (Figs.5, c and d, and Fig. 6) or with C8-Glc-S-Cer for 4 days (Fig. 6), with a marked increase in both the peak and duration of the response; similar data were obtained using a ratiometric dye, Fura-2 (not shown). The response was totally blocked upon co-incubation with CBE and FB1, which reduced [Ca2+]i changes to below levels of the control response (Fig. 6). As previously observed in control cells (16Korkotian E. Segal M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1670-1682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Korkotian E. Segal M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 2076-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the response of CBE-treated cells to caffeine was blocked in the presence of ryanodine (not shown). No effects were observed on caffeine-stimulated [Ca2+]irelease after short-term incubation (12 h) with either CBE or C8-Glc-S-Cer.Figure 5[Ca2+] i release from the ER in response to caffeine. Neurons were incubated with CBE for 4 days prior to analysis of transient [Ca2+]i release from the ER following exposure of cells to a pulsed application of caffeine. Typical responses are shown for a control (a and b) and a CBE-treated cell (c and d) before (a and c) and during the response to caffeine (b and d). There were no differences in the size and shape of neuronal perikarya between treated- and untreated-cells.

ΔF/F is the change in fluorescence (F) intensity divided by basal fluorescence. There were no changes in basal fluorescence levels before caffeine application (control, 47.75 ± 1.96 absolute fluorescence units; CBE-treated, 49.79 ± 1.4; FB1-treated, 50.32 ± 2.59; CBE and FB1-treated, 48.35 ± 3.86; C8-Glc-S-Cer, 48.39 ± 1.55), obtained under identical conditions for each treatment. Note that the rate of increase of free [Ca2+]i is proportional to the rate of decrease of free [Ca2+]iin all experimental conditions: CBE-treated neurons (ΔF/F per s = 0.24 for increase, and 0.49 for decrease, ratio = 0.49); Glc-S-Cer-treated neurons (ΔF/F per s = 0.27 for increase and 0.68 for decrease, ratio = 0.40); control (ΔF/Fper s = 0.10 and 0.19, ratio = 0.53); FB1-treated (ΔF/F per s = 0.05 and 0.15, ratio 0.33); CBE + FB1-treated neurons (ΔF/F per s = 0.02 and 0.05, ratio = 0.40).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the functional consequences of the increase in caffeine-sensitive calcium stores and the increased response to glutamate, the sensitivity of neurons to glutamate toxicity (10 mm, 1 h) was examined. Neurons incubated with either CBE or C8-Glc-S-Cer were much more sensitive than control cells to glutamate-induced neuronal cell death, and this effect was abolished by co-incubation with CBE and FB1 (Fig. 7a). Remarkably, pre-incubation with ryanodine for 1 h completely blocked the neurotoxic effects of glutamate in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7b), demonstrating that the release of Ca2+ from the ER is responsible for glutamate-induced neuronal cell death, at least in neurons with elevated GlcCer levels. To distinguish between the possibilities that changes in cytosolic free [Ca2+]iresult from altered [Ca2+]i efflux from the ER or alternatively from altered [Ca2+]i influx, neurons were incubated with 45Ca2+ after permeabilization of the plasma membrane using the calcium ionophore, A23187. No difference was observed between control and CBE-treated neurons in the rate or amount of 45Ca2+ uptake into the ER after 20, 30, or 40 s, demonstrating that there is no change in the rate of [Ca2+]i influx into the ER in neurons with elevated GlcCer levels (Fig. 8). This suggests that free [Ca2+]i is elevated because of increased efflux from the ER, which is consistent with the increase in RR-density on the ER (Fig. 3b), with calculations showing that the rate of increase in free [Ca2+]i after caffeine application is proportional to the rate of decrease of free [Ca2+]i (Fig. 6) and with the lack of effect of thapsigargin on glutamate toxicity (Fig. 8). In the current study, we demonstrate that elevation of intracellular GlcCer levels causes changes in the morphology and functionality of the ER in cultured hippocampal neurons. Although we have not unambiguously demonstrated that these effects are caused by accumulation of GlcCer in lysosomes (rather than accumulation in other intracellular compartments), our observations are of relevance for understanding the neuronal dysfunction and cell death that are observed in neuronopathic forms of Gaucher disease, in which massive lysosomal accumulation of GlcCer occurs (1Beutler E. Grabowski G.A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Diseases. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2641-2670Google Scholar). Only limited studies on the neuropathology of Gaucher patients exist, but changes in neuronal morphology have been observed, including dilated and distended smooth and rough ER in brains from neuronopathic forms of Gaucher disease (28Adachi M. Wallace B.J. Schneck L. Volk B.W. Arch. Pathol. 1967; 83: 513-526PubMed Google Scholar,29Cervos Navarro J. Zimmer C. Clin. Neuropathol. 1990; 9: 310-313PubMed Google Scholar), and marked dilations of the rough ER in corneal keratinocytes from the neuronopathic form of Gaucher disease (30Salgado Borges J. Silva Araujo A. Lemos M.M. Sa Miranda M.C. Abreu Dias P. Tavares M.A. Eur. J. Ophthalmol. 1995; 5: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Similar morphological findings were observed in the brains of mice fed CBE (31Adachi M. Volk B.W. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1977; 101: 255-259PubMed Google Scholar). Even less is known about the relationship between neuronal cell death and accumulation of GlcCer. We now demonstrate, for the first time, a direct relationship between GlcCer accumulation, Ca2+release from intracellular stores, and neuronal cell death. This finding may have implications not only for understanding neuronal cell death in Gaucher disease, but also for the neurotoxic roles of glutamate in other neurodegenerative conditions. Only limited data is available about the levels of GlcCer accumulation in Gaucher patients, and there are no systematic studies comparing levels of accumulation in various brain regions at various stages of progression of the disease. In one study, GlcCer levels were 20–80 times higher in the cerebral cortex from a type 2 Gaucher patient and 5–40 times higher in the cerebellar cortex (32Nilsson O. Svennerholm L. J. Neurochem. 1982; 39: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In another study (33Kaye E.M. Ullman M.D. Wilson E.R. Barranger J.A. Ann. Neurol. 1986; 20: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), GlcCer levels were elevated in both type 2 and 3 patients, but neuropathological findings were detected only in the type 2 brain. At this stage, we are unable to correlate levels of GlcCer accumulation in cultured neurons with the extent of neuronal dysfunction, but analysis of GlcCer accumulation (or the extent GlcCerase inhibition (34Meivar-Levy I. Horowitz M. Futerman A.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)) and changes in ER function, including [Ca2+]i release from the ER, are currently underway. We have repeated most of the findings obtained using CBE with a nonhydrolyzable analogue of GlcCer, C8-Glc-S-Cer, to confirm that the effects of CBE are indeed because of GlcCer accumulation and not because of a nonselective, pharmacological action of CBE. This is further confirmed by studies in which accumulation of GlcCer was prevented by co-incubation with FB1 and CBE. Using a similar approach, the accumulation of ganglioside GM2 was blocked in Tay-Sachs mice treated with an inhibitor of GlcCer synthesis (35Platt F.M. Neises G.R. Reinkensmeier G. Townsend M.J. Perry V.H. Proia R.L. Winchester B. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. Science. 1997; 276: 428-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Thus, treatment of patients suffering from a sphingolipid storage disorder with inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis may yet prove to be a viable therapeutic option. There are two possibilities as to how intracellular accumulation of GlcCer could affect ER morphology and Ca2+ stores. First, GlcCer could directly affect the ER. In this scenario, GlcCer would need to be transported from its site of accumulation (in lysosomes and perhaps other organelles) to the ER. Both short acyl-chain analogues of GlcCer (11Schwarzmann G. Hofmann P. Pütz T. Albrecht B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21271-21276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Martin O.C. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and also metabolically labeled GlcCer (36Trinchera M. Carretoni D. Ghidoni R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9093-9099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) can be transported out of endosomes and lysosomes and accumulate in the intracellular compartments (the ER and Golgi apparatus) where they are metabolized to higher order sphingolipids (11Schwarzmann G. Hofmann P. Pütz T. Albrecht B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21271-21276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 37Futerman A.H. Biochemistry (Moscow). 1998; 63: 74-83PubMed Google Scholar). In hippocampal neurons, a fluorescent derivative of C8-Glc-S-Cer, C8-NBD-Glc-S-Cer, is internalized to various intracellular compartments, including lysosomes, but also the ER (data not shown). Whether GlcCer accumulation in the ER can alter the activity of ER Ca2+ channels is unknown, but modulatory effects of lyso-sphingolipids (38Betto R. Teresi A. Turcato F. Salviati G. Sabbadini R.A.

Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1996; 14: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), sphingoid long-chain bases (40Ghosh T.K. Bian J. Gill D.L. Science. 1990; 248: 1653-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), metabolites of sphingoid bases (41Mattie M. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3181-3188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cerebrosides (42Dyer C.A. Benjamins J.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 30: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) on Ca2+ mobilization have been observed. Alternatively, GlcCer could act indirectly on the ER, for instance, by altering levels of an intracellular signaling molecule. Incubation of Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells with CBE results in decreased bradykinin-stimulated formation of inositol trisphosphate, whereas the opposite effect is observed upon inhibition of GlcCer synthesis (43Mahdiyoun S. Deshmukh G.D. Abe A. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 506-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 44Shayman J.A. Mahdiyoun S. Deshmukh G. Barcelon F. Inokuchi J. Radin N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12135-12138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, when GlcCer accumulates, inositol trisphosphate levels may be chronically depleted, resulting in up-regulation of the RR in the ER that may in turn be responsible for increased Ca2+ release from the ER. Irrespective of the mechanism of action of GlcCer, this is the first time that changes in the functionality of neurons with elevated GlcCer levels have been observed and will provide the experimental tools for analyzing the relationship between GlcCer accumulation and neuronal functionality and development.

Affinity regulation of the related integrin, αIIbβ3, has been established using a monovalent ligand-mimetic antibody, PAC1 Fab.

Both WOW-1 Fab and penton base bound selectively to activated αVβ3, but not to αIIbβ3, in receptor and cell binding assays. αVβ3 affinity varied with the cell type. Unstimulated B-lymphoblastoid cells bound WOW-1 Fab poorly (apparent Kd = 2.4 μm), but acute stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate increased receptor affinity >30-fold (Kd = 80 nm), with no change in receptor number.

In the adult organism, αVβ3 has been implicated in processes ranging from wound healing to tumor angiogenesis (11Brooks P.C. Clark R.A.F. Cheresh D.A.

Cell. 1993; 73: 309-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar). One fundamental function of integrins is ligand binding, which in many cases is rapidly regulated by a process variously referred to as “integrin activation,” “inside-out signaling,” or “affinity/avidity modulation” (15Diamond M.S.

Commun. 1998; 6: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Integrin activation encompasses at least two events: 1) modulation of receptor affinity through conformational changes in the αβ heterodimer and 2) modulation of receptor avidity through facilitation of lateral diffusion and/or clustering of heterodimers (5Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem.

Med. 1997; 186: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The importance of rapid regulated changes in integrin affinity/avidity is easy to appreciate for αIIbβ3 because platelets must interact productively with fibrinogen or von Willebrand factor only in vascular wounds. Studies of αIIbβ3 activation have been facilitated by the use of soluble ligands, most notably a multivalent ligand-mimetic antibody called PAC1 and its monovalent Fab fragment, which contain an R(G/Y)D tract in H-CDR31 (5Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,22Abrams C. Deng Y.J. Steiner B. O'Toole J. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18781-18788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence acquired using these monovalent and multivalent forms of PAC1 indicates that changes in affinity and avidity play complementary roles in αIIbβ3 function (23Hato T. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1685-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the significance of inside-out signaling and, in particular, affinity modulation for αVβ3has been less certain. The ligand binding function of αVβ3 has usually been assessed by cell adhesion assays, and these have clearly shown that activation of certain cells leads to αVβ3-mediated adhesion (24Stupack D.G. Shen C. Wilkins J.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 203: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 25Bennett J.S. Chan C. Vilaire G. Mousa S.A. DeGrado W.F. J. Biol.

However, adhesion assays can be strongly influenced by post-ligand binding events, including changes in cell shape, that can obscure the precise contributions of affinity or avidity modulation to the overall response. Recently, Byzova and Plow (28Byzova T.V. Plow E.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 2081-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 29Byzova T.V. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27183-27188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) showed that soluble prothrombin, a coagulation protein, can bind directly in an RGD-dependent fashion to αIIbβ3in platelets and αVβ3 in cultured human endothelial cells. Notably, prothrombin binding to αVβ3 could be increased by MnCl2, a general activator of integrins, and by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, an activator of protein kinase C. Taken together, these results indicate that αVβ3has the potential to be regulated at the level of ligand binding. However, the specific mechanisms, relative contributions, and biological consequences of affinity and avidity modulation of αVβ3 remain to be established. The distinction between affinity and avidity regulation is not academic because the underlying mechanisms and effects on cell function are likely to be different (5Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem.

Furthermore, mechanistic insights into the regulation of ligand binding could facilitate current efforts aimed at developing drugs that inhibit or stimulate αVβ3 function in vivo. The purpose of these studies was to determine whether αVβ3 is subject to affinitymodulation and, if so, to explore the potential pathophysiological implications of such regulation. To accomplish this task, we characterized the binding of soluble monovalent and multivalent ligands to αVβ3 in several cell types, reasoning that a monovalent ligand would be sensitive to affinity modulation and a multivalent ligand would be sensitive to both affinity and avidity modulation (18Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 23Hato T. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. J.

Trends Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Penton base, a coat protein from adenovirus type 2, was selected as a multivalent ligand because each of its five subunits contains a 50-amino acid RGD tract that mediates virus internalization through αV integrins (8Wickham T.J. Mathias P. Cheresh D.A. Nemerow G.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 309-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar). A novel monovalent ligand called WOW-1 Fab was created by replacing the H-CDR3 of PAC1 Fab with a single integrin-binding domain of penton base. This switched the selectivity of the Fab fragment from activated αIIbβ3 to activated αVβ3, enabling a direct assessment of αVβ3 affinity state. These studies establish that αVβ3 is subject to affinity regulation, with direct implications for the anchorage-dependent functions of αVβ3 and for adenovirus-mediated gene delivery. Recombinant penton base from adenovirus type 2 was baculovirus-expressed in Trichoplusia Tn 5B1-4 insect cells and purified as described previously (8Wickham T.J. Mathias P. Cheresh D.A. Nemerow G.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 309-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar). The purified protein migrated as a single ∼325-kDa band on native polyacrylamide gels and an ∼80-kDa band on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Penton base was conjugated to Alexa-488 to form Alexa-penton base (aPB) 1The abbreviations used are: H-CDR3, heavy chain hypervariable region 3; aPB, Alexa-penton base; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GFP, green fluorescent protein; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection. according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Purified human fibrinogen was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN) and labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (31Shattil S.J. Cunningham M. Hoxie J.A. Blood. 1987; 70: 307-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). WOW-1 Fab was created by replacing the 19-amino acid H-CDR3 of antibody PAC1 Fab (22Abrams C. Deng Y.J. Steiner B. O'Toole J. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18781-18788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the 50-amino acid αV integrin-binding domain from adenovirus type 2 penton base (32Mathias P. Wickham T. Moore M. Nemerow G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6811-6814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by splice-overlap polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides PB-For (5′-ACACAGCCATATATTACTGTGCCAGAGCGGAAGAGAACTCCAACGCG), PB-Rev (5′-ACTGAGGTTCCTTGACCCCACGCAGCGGGGGCGGCAGCTTCTGC), Pac1-For (5′-GCGCGGGAGATCTCAGGTGCAGCTGAAGCAGTCAGGA), and Pac1-Rev (5′-GGCGCATGACCGGTACAATCCCTGGGCACAATTTTCTTG). The resulting WOW-1 fd DNA fragment was digested with BglII/AgeI and cloned into a Drosophila expression vector, pMT/BiP/V5-HisB (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), which contains theDrosophila metallothionein promoter and BiP secretion signal and places a His6 tag at the C terminus of fd DNA. Similarly, PAC1κ containing NcoI and AgeI sites was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with κ-For (5′-GGCGCGGGAGATCTCCATGGGATGTTTTGATGACCCAAACTCCA) and κ-Rev (5′-GGCGCATGACCGGTACACTCATTCCTGTTGAAGCTCTTG) and cloned into pMT/BiP/V5-HisB. Nineteen μg of WOW-1 fd and PAC1κ DNA in pMT/BiP/V5-HisB were cotransfected with 1 μg of selection vector (pCoHYGRO, Invitrogen) into Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells by calcium phosphate precipitation. Stable S2 cell lines were selected with hygromycin B and screened for secretion of WOW-1 Fab after a 36–72-h induction with 500 μm CuSO4. WOW-1 Fab was purified from 250–1000 ml of serum-free medium by column chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Typical yields were 2–5 mg/liter with a purity of ≥90% as estimated on SDS gels stained with silver or Coomassie Blue. WOW-1 Fab migrated as a single ∼58-kDa band on nonreduced SDS gels and reacted on Western blots with a monoclonal antibody specific for a linear epitope in the integrin-binding domain of penton base (33Stewart P.L. Chiu C.Y. Huang S. Muir T. Zhao Y. Chait B. Mathias P. Nemerow G.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1189-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and with affinity-purified goat anti-mouse κ-chain (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA). After reduction, WOW-1 Fab migrated as an ∼33-kDa fd chain and an ∼25-kDa κ-chain. There was no evidence of fd or κ-homodimers. As with PAC1 Fab (22Abrams C. Deng Y.J. Steiner B. O'Toole J. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18781-18788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the relative migration of WOW-1 Fab on a Sephadex G-200 column indicated that it was monomeric and therefore monovalent in aqueous solution. cDNAs encoding full-length human αV and β3 were subcloned into pcDNA3 and pCDM8, respectively, and 2 μg of each were transfected into CHO-K1 cells to obtain transient and stable transfectants as described (34O'Toole T.E.

Stable transfectants surviving antibiotic selection were further screened for high αVβ3 expression by single-cell fluorescence-activated cell sorting using the αVβ3-specific monoclonal antibody LM609 (35Cheresh D.A.

CS-1 is a hamster melanoma cell line that does not express αVβ3 or αVβ5 because it does not synthesize the β3 or β5 subunits. αVβ3-CS-1 cells stably expressing hamster αV and human β3 were obtained by transfection of CS-1 cells with human β3 (38Filardo E.J.

After washing, the cells were incubated for another 30 min on ice with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L chain-specific;BIOSOURCE International), washed again, and analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) (23Hato T. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1685-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). As a negative control, samples were incubated with the secondary antibody alone. Binding of aPB, WOW-1 Fab, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-fibrinogen to cells was assessed by flow cytometry. Typically, cells were cultured overnight in low serum medium (e.g. 0.5% fetal bovine serum) and resuspended in incubation buffer at 1–1.5 × 107 cells/ml, and 4–6 × 105 cells were incubated with one of these ligands for 30 min at room temperature in a final volume of 50 μl. As indicated, some samples were also incubated in the presence of one or more of the following reagents: antibody AP5 ascites (1:50) to activate β3 integrins (41Pelletier A.J. Kunicki T. Ruggeri Z.M.

Naughton M.A. Teng W. Rose J.W. Phillips D.R. Nannizzi L. Arfsten A. Campbell A.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1066-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); or a 100 μg/ml concentration of the function-blocking antibody LM609 or P1F6. In some experiments, ligand binding and αVβ3expression were measured simultaneously by incubation of cells with ligands in the presence of biotin-SSA6 (7 μg/ml), a non-function-blocking anti-β3 monoclonal antibody (22Abrams C. Deng Y.J. Steiner B. O'Toole J. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18781-18788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 30 min at room temperature, cells were washed and incubated with phycoerythrin-streptavidin (1:25 final dilution; Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 20 min on ice. In the case of WOW-1 Fab, an Alexa-conjugated anti-His6 monoclonal antibody (Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp., Westbury, NY) was added at this stage (50 μg/ml). Cells were washed and resuspended in 0.5 ml of incubation buffer containing 2 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma). Ligand binding (FL1 channel) was analyzed immediately on the gated subset of live cells (propidium iodide-negative, FL3) that were strongly positive for αVβ3 expression (FL2). Binding isotherms were subjected to nonlinear least-squares regression analysis using an equation for one-site binding (Prism 2.0 software, GraphPAD Software for Science, San Diego, CA). Two-tailed p values for paired samples were obtained by Student's t test. To examine the effects of overexpression of isolated integrin cytoplasmic tails on ligand binding to αVβ3, αVβ3-CS-1 cells were transfected with a mammalian expression plasmid encoding Tac-β1, Tac-β3, or Tac-α5, using Fugene-6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (43LaFlamme S.E. Thomas L.A. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar,44Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Shipley T. Forsyth J. LaFlamme S.E. Yamada K.M. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18307-18310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were suspended in incubation buffer at 1.5 × 106/ml and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 150 nm aPB or 425 nm WOW-1 Fab in the presence or absence of 5 mmEDTA. After washing, cells were incubated for an additional 30 min on ice with 2.5 μg/ml biotinylated anti-Tac monoclonal antibody (7G7B6), followed by incubation with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and (when WOW-1 Fab was present) 50 μg/ml Alexa-conjugated anti-His6 monoclonal antibody. Ligand binding was analyzed on the gated subset of live cells strongly positive for Tac expression. In parallel tubes, cells were co-stained with SSA6 and anti-Tac antibody to quantitate αVβ3 expression in the Tac-positive cells. Binding of WOW-1 Fab to purified αVβ3receptors from human placenta and αIIbβ3from human platelets was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the presence of 50 μm CaCl2, MgCl2, and MnCl2. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 2 mm RGDS (22Abrams C. Deng Y.J. Steiner B. O'Toole J. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18781-18788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immulon-2 microtiter wells (Dynex Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) were coated with unlabeled penton base (1–100 ng/well) overnight at 4 °C, followed by blocking with 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. CHO cells stably expressing αVβ3 were labeled with 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein/acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc.), and cell adhesion to immobilized penton base was quantitated by cytofluorometry at 485/530 nm (23Hato T. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1685-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). CS-1 and αVβ3-CS-1 cells (105 cells) were suspended for 5 min at room temperature in 100 μl of incubation buffer. In some cases, 2.5 mm MnCl2 was also present to induce maximal integrin activation. Then, replication-deficient adenovirus type 5 encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) was added to the cell suspension at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 50 or 500 (45Huang S. Stupack D. Mathias P. Wang Y. Nemerow G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8156-8161Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). After 1 h at 37 °C, virus not internalized was digested by incubation of the cells with 0.03% trypsin and 0.35 mm EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C. After 72 h, GFP expression was quantitated by flow cytometry. To document and study the significance of affinity modulation of αVβ3, we set out to develop a monovalent reporter ligand analogous to the activation-dependent anti-αIIbβ3 antibody PAC1 Fab. We reasoned that swapping the 50-amino acid RGD motif from adenovirus penton base with the H-CDR3 of PAC1 Fab might convert the antibody into a suitable αVβ3 ligand. To test this idea, preliminary binding studies were conducted with the new antibody, designated WOW-1 Fab, using purified integrins in the presence of 50 μmMnCl2, which activates integrins by a direct effect on the extracellular domain (18Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). WOW-1 Fab bound to purified αVβ3 and, to a lesser extent, to purified αVβ5. Binding was half-maximal at 40 nm Fab fragment and was blocked by >95% by 2 mm RGDS or 5 mm EDTA. In contrast, there was no detectable binding of WOW-1 Fab to purified αIIbβ3 at antibody concentrations as high as 2 μm, even though the parent antibody, PAC1 Fab, bound half-maximally to αIIbβ3 at 50 nm. These results indicate that the reengineering of PAC1 Fab converted it from an activation-dependent αIIbβ3 antibody into an antibody that reacts with activated αVβ3. To determine if WOW-1 Fab reacted preferentially with activated αVβ3 in cells, Fab fragment binding was compared with that of multivalent penton base using CHO cells stably transfected with human αVβ3(αVβ3-CHO cells). Flow cytometric analysis showed that the surface of these cells expressed large amounts of αVβ3, modest amounts of αVβ5, and no detectable αIIbβ3 (Fig. 1A). When aPB or WOW-1 Fab was incubated with the cells over a range of ligand concentrations (5–1000 nm) and for various periods of time at room temperature, specific ligand binding, defined as that inhibitable by 2 mm RGDS or 5 mm EDTA, reached a steady state by 30 min, and nonspecific binding accounted for ≤15% of total binding. Therefore, all subsequent binding studies were carried out under these conditions. aPB and WOW-1 Fab bound specifically but at low levels to unstimulated αVβ3-CHO cells. However, direct activation of αVβ3 by anti-β3 antibody AP5 caused a significant increase in the binding of both ligands (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1B). To assess the selectivity of these ligands for αVβ3 in this system, the effect of various function-blocking compounds was studied. Binding of aPB and WOW-1 Fab in the presence of antibody AP5 was inhibited ≥85% by 2 mm RGDS or 50 μm cRGDfV, a cyclic peptide selective for αV integrins (Fig. 2) (46Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M.P. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2184) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a cyclic peptide selective for αIIbβ3 (Integrilin) inhibited ligand binding by <20%, even at a concentration (1 μm) 100-fold higher than necessary to prevent fibrinogen or PAC1 binding to platelet αIIbβ3 (42Scarborough R.M.

Furthermore, the αVβ3 function-blocking antibody LM609 (100 μg/ml) inhibited ligand binding by >70%, whereas the αVβ5 function-blocking antibody P1F6 had no such effect (data not shown). In addition, neither aPB nor WOW-1 Fab bound detectably to resting or thrombin-stimulated human platelets, which express >50,000 αIIbβ3receptors, but <500 αVβ3 receptors/cell (7Coller B.S. Cheresh D.A. Asch E. Seligsohn U. Blood. 1991; 77: 75-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these results indicate that a monovalent ligand, WOW-1 Fab, and a multivalent ligand, aPB, are sensitive to the activation state of αVβ3 and that they do not recognize αIIbβ3. Thus, WOW-1 Fab may be a suitable reporter for changes in αVβ3affinity. Since WOW-1 Fab (and aPB) also recognizes αVβ5, particular efforts were made in the experiments that follow to utilize cells that express αVβ3, but little or no αVβ5. To determine if αVβ3 is susceptible to affinity modulation by inside-out signals, the binding of WOW-1 Fab to JY B-lymphoblasts was studied. These cells were selected because they express αVβ3, but not αVβ5, and they adhere rapidly to vitronectin in response to activation of protein kinase C by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (24Stupack D.G.

https://openalex.org/W1981852211,"Oxidized LDL (oxLDL) have been implicated in diverse biological events leading to the development of atherosclerotic lesions. We previously demonstrated that the proliferation of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) induced by oxLDL is preceded by an increase in neutral sphingomyelinase activity, sphingomyelin turnover to ceramide, and stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (Augé, N., Escargueil-Blanc, I., Lajoie-Mazenc, I., Suc, I., Andrieu-Abadie, N., Pieraggi, M. T., Chatelut, M., Thiers, J. C., Jaffrézou, J. P., Laurent, G., Levade, T., Nègre-Salvayre, A., and Salvayre, R. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 12893–12900). Since ceramide can be converted to other bioactive metabolites, such as the well established mitogen sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), we investigated whether additional ceramide metabolites are involved in the oxLDL-induced SMC proliferation. We report here that incubation of SMC with oxLDL increased the activities of both acidic and alkaline ceramidases as well as sphingosine kinase, and elevated cellular sphingosine and S1P. Furthermore, the mitogenic effect of oxLDL was inhibited byd-erythro-2-(N-myristoylamino)-1-phenyl-1-propanol and N,N-dimethylsphingosine which are inhibitors of ceramidase and sphingosine kinase, respectively. These findings suggest that S1P is a key mediator of the mitogenic effect of oxLDL. In agreement with this conclusion, exogenous addition of sphingosine stimulated the proliferation of cultured SMC, and this effect was abrogated by dimethylsphingosine but not by fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of the acylation of sphingosine to ceramide. Exogenous S1P also promoted SMC proliferation. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that the mitogenic effect of oxLDL in SMC involves the combined activation of sphingomyelinase(s), ceramidase(s), and sphingosine kinase, resulting in the turnover of sphingomyelin to a number of sphingolipid metabolites, of which at least S1P is critical for mitogenesis.

In previous studies, the induction of SM turnover was shown to be mitogenic for SMC through the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases p42 and p44 (13Augé N. Escargueil-Blanc I. Lajoie-Mazenc I. Suc I. Andrieu-Abadie N. Pieraggi M.T. Chatelut M. Thiers J.C. Jaffrézou J.P. Laurent G. Levade T. Nègre-Salvayre A. Salvayre R. J. Biol.

The ceramide formed from SM turnover might be hydrolyzed by ceramidases to liberate the sphingoid base backbone (sphingosine), which can be re-acylated to ceramide or phosphorylated to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) by sphingosine kinase (14Merrill Jr., A.H.

While ceramide and sphingosine have most frequently been described as potent inhibitors of cell growth or as cytotoxic agents (20Spiegel S. Merrill Jr., A.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), S1P has been found to be growth stimulatory for fibroblasts (21Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) and SMC (22Bornfeldt K.E. Graves L.M. Raines E.W. Igarashi Y. Wayman G. Yamamura S. Yatomi Y. Sidhu J.S. Krebs E.G.

Biochem. 1996; 237: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The mitogenic effects of S1P have been attributed to calcium mobilization, activation of phospholipase D, and generation of the second messenger phosphatidic acid, engagement of the MAPK pathway, and activation of the transcription factor AP-1 (24van Brocklyn J.R. Cuvillier O. Olivera A. Spiegel S. J. Liposome Res. 1998; 8: 135-145Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar); furthermore, S1P can inhibit apoptosis (25Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). Sphingosine kinase is activated by PDGF, phorbol esters, and a number of other growth stimulatory factors (24van Brocklyn J.R. Cuvillier O. Olivera A. Spiegel S. J. Liposome Res. 1998; 8: 135-145Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Relatively little is known about the modulation of ceramide hydrolysis by various agonists, however, PDGF (26Coroneos E.

The present study investigated whether the mitogenic signaling triggered by oxLDL in cultured SMC is mediated by the hydrolysis of SM to ceramide combined with the activation of ceramidase and sphingosine kinase to form S1P. The results, indeed, establish that oxLDL induce activation of this panel of enzymes, and strongly implicate S1P as a key mediator of the mitogenic effect of oxLDL. Minimal essential medium (MEM), phosphate-free DMEM medium, penicillin, streptomycin, trypsin-EDTA,l-glutamine, and fetal calf serum (FCS) were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Cergy-Pontoise, France). [3H]Thymidine (5 Ci/mmol) and [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (53 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham (Les Ulis, France); [methyl-3H]choline chloride (86 Ci/mmol) was from DuPont NEN (Courtaboeuf, France), and [32P]phosphoric acid (500 mCi/ml) and [γ-33P]ATP (5 Ci/mmol) were from ICN (Orsay, France).d-Erythro-MAPP, DMS, S1P, and N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide) were from TEBU-Biomol (Le Perray en Yvelines, France). Bacillus cereussphingomyelinase, d-erythro-sphingosine, TPCK, and FB1 were obtained from Sigma. C6-NBD-ceramide was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Other reagents and solvents (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were of analytical grade. Rabbit femoral SMC (obtained from ATCC, Manassas, VA) were routinely grown in MEM supplemented with 10% FCS,l-glutamine (2 mmol/liter), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in humidified CO2(5%) atmosphere. When indicated, C2-ceramide, sphingosine,d-MAPP, FB1, and DMS were added to the cells in ethanolic solution (final concentration of ethanol, 0.1%), while S1P was introduced as an aqueous solution prepared in MEM containing 10% FCS. Human LDL (d1.019–1.063) were isolated from pooled fresh sera as described previously (6Augé N. Pieraggi M.T. Thiers J.C. Nègre-Salvayre A. Salvayre R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). OxLDL were obtained by copper oxidation: LDL in 0.15m NaCl were oxidized by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C with copper sulfate (2 μm). Oxidation was stopped by adding EDTA (2 μm) to the solution. This procedure was set up to obtain mildly oxidized LDL, i.e. LDL characterized by a moderate amount of lipid peroxidation products (8.5 ± 1.2 nmol of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances/mg of apolipoprotein B), and by slight modification of the relative electrophoretic mobility as compared with native LDL (data not shown). SMC were seeded at a density of 50,000 cells/ml in 24-multiwell Nunc culture plaques, and grown for 24 h in medium containing 10% FCS. Then the medium was removed, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and further grown for 24 h in MEM containing 1% FCS. Cells were then incubated with the indicated concentration of mitogenic agent for 24 or 48 h, and labeled for the last 12 h of the experiment with [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi/ml). Incorporation of [3H]thymidine was determined as described previously (13Augé N. Escargueil-Blanc I. Lajoie-Mazenc I. Suc I. Andrieu-Abadie N. Pieraggi M.T. Chatelut M. Thiers J.C. Jaffrézou J.P.

The cytotoxicity was evaluated by using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide test (28Denizot F. Lang R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 89: 371-377Crossref Scopus (4355) Google Scholar). For SM determination, SMC were metabolically labeled to apparent equilibrium with [methyl-3H]choline (0.5 μCi/ml) in MEM medium containing 1% FCS for 48 h. The cells were washed once with PBS and incubated for 2 h in fresh medium containing 1% FCS (to allow them to adjust to the medium change), then incubated with or without oxLDL (10 μg of apoB/ml). At the indicated times, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, harvested, and sedimented by centrifugation (300 × g for 5 min). Cell pellets were immediately frozen at −20 °C. Alternatively, SM and ceramide contents were determined by [9,10-3H]palmitic acid labeling using the previously reported experimental conditions (12Augé N. Andrieu N. Nègre-Salvayre A. Thiers J.C.

For the estimation of cellular S1P concentrations, subconfluent cells were incubated for 24 h with phosphate-free DMEM medium containing [32P]phosphoric acid (40 μCi/ml). After 1 h of chase in phosphate-free medium, cells were treated as indicated above. Cell pellets were suspended in 0.6 ml of distilled water and homogenized by sonication (2 × 10 s, using a MSE probe sonicator). An aliquot was saved for protein determination (29Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke M.N. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18709) Google Scholar). Lipids from 0.5 ml of the cell lysate were extracted by 2.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (30Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lipid phase was evaporated under nitrogen. [3H]Choline-labeled SM was quantified as described (31Andrieu N. Salvayre R. Levade T. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The [9,10-3H]palmitic acid-labeled lipids were separated by TLC on Silica Gel G-60 analytical plates, using 3 successive runs, one with chloroform/methanol/water (100:42:6, by volume) up to 14 cm, a second run with chloroform, methanol, 16 n ammonia (90:10:1, by volume) up to 18 cm, and a last run with petroleum ether/diethyl ether (80:20, by volume) up to 19.5 cm. Radioactive lipids were localized using a Berthold radiochromatoscan and after exposure to iodine vapors. For S1P quantification, lipids were extracted exactly as described for the experiments with radioactive choline, that is after mild alkaline hydrolysis. 32P-Labeled phospholipids were separated by TLC using chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8, by volume) as developing solvent. Radioactive S1P was localized by autoradiography (Kodak BioMax film) and by iodine vapors. All radioactive spots were scraped off and counted by liquid scintillation. Sphingosine mass was determined as described previously (27Nikolova-Karakashian M. Morgan E.T. Alexander C. Liotta D.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18718-18724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). After stimulation with or without oxLDL, SMC were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped from two 60-mm dishes, pooled and sedimented, and ceramidase assays were performed as described previously (27Nikolova-Karakashian M.

After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2 (for neutral ceramidase assay), 0.5m acetate buffer, pH 5 (for acidic ceramidase), or 10 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 8 (for alkaline ceramidase), the reaction was stopped and the products were analyzed by HPLC as described below. Alternatively, the enzymatic reaction (after 2 h incubation at 37 °C) was terminated by adding chloroform/methanol, and the lipids were extracted, separated on aluminum TLC plates using chloroform/methanol (95:5, by volume), and then petroleum ether/diethyl ether (80:20, by volume). The fluorescent bands were cut, eluted in chloroform/methanol (2:1, by volume), and quantified using a Jobin-Yvon 3D spectrofluorometer (at 466 and 536 nm, for the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively). SMC were incubated with C6-NBD-ceramide (6 μm) for 6 h before addition of oxLDL. After varying incubation times, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and 1.5 ml of methanol/water/phosphoric acid (850:150:1.5, by volume) was added, and the suspension was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with gentle shaking. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was analyzed by HPLC as described in the following section. NBD lipids were injected into a reverse-phase column (Nova-Pak, C18, Bio-Rad) and eluted with methanol/water/phosphoric acid (850:150:1.5, by volume) as described (27Nikolova-Karakashian M.

Under these conditions, NBD fatty acid appears as a single peak at 1.5 min and C6-NBD-ceramide at 10.3 min. The NBD fluorescence was analyzed with excitation at 455 nm and emission at 530 nm. Sphingosine kinase activity was determined as described previously (32Olivera A. Spiegel S. Bird I.M. Methods in Molecular Biology. 105. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 233-242Google Scholar) with minor modifications. After incubation with or without oxLDL, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, harvested, and sedimented by centrifugation. Cell pellets were immediately solubilized in the kinase buffer (see Ref. 32Olivera A. Spiegel S. Bird I.M. Methods in Molecular Biology. 105. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 233-242Google Scholar) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The kinase assay was performed by mixing protein samples (50 μg) with 10 μl of 1 mm sphingosine (dissolved in 5% Triton X-100) and [33P]ATP (1 μCi, 20 mm) containing 200 mm MgCl2. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by addition of 20 μl of 1 n HCl, and the [33P]ATP-labeled S1P was extracted, isolated by TLC, and quantified as described (32Olivera A. Spiegel S. Bird I.M. Methods in Molecular Biology. 105. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 233-242Google Scholar). Alternatively, a nonradioactive method was used. Cells were extracted in the kinase buffer as described above and the kinase reaction was performed by incubating 50 μg of protein sample with 50 mm octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 20 μm sphingosine, and 1 mm ATP in a final volume of 100 μl during 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 750 μl of methanol. Then 100 μl of 10 mm EDTA and 50 μl of 5% ortho-phthalaldehyde were added to the mixture. After 15 min of derivatization at room temperature in the dark, the samples were injected into HPLC (C18reverse-phase column) using methanol/potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, tetrabutylammonium dihydrogen phosphate (83:16:1, by volume) as mobile phase. S1P was analyzed with excitation at 340 nm and emission at 455 nm. 2B. Caligan and A. H. Merrill, Jr., manuscript in preparation.

As shown in Fig. 2, oxLDL at a concentration that is mitogenic for SMC (10 μg of apoB/ml; see Table I and Fig. 3) induced a time-dependent decrease in SM. Maximal hydrolysis of [3H]choline-labeled SM (38 ± 11.5%) was observed within 40–70 min after oxLDL addition, then, [3H]SM returned progressively toward the original level (Fig. 2A).

Both [3H]palmitate-labeled SM and ceramide levels recovered to baseline within 3 h. These results are similar to the responses seen previously with UV-oxidized LDL (12Augé N. Andrieu N.

The increase in ceramide might mean that this metabolite is responsible for the mitogenic response of SMC to oxLDL, however, it is also possible that subsequent metabolite(s) are involved. To explore this possibility, the cells were treated with oxLDL in the presence of d-MAPP, a ceramidase inhibitor (33Bielawska A. Greenberg M.S. Perry D. Jayadev S. Shayman J.A. McKay C. Hannun Y.A.

Mutant-activated Gαo was used as the bait to screen a cDNA library from chick dorsal root ganglion neurons. We found that Gαo interacted with several proteins including Gz-GTPase-activating protein (Gz-GAP), a new RGS protein (RGS-17), a novel protein of unknown function (IP6), and Rap1GAP. This study focuses on Rap1GAP, which selectively interacts with Gαoand Gαi but not with Gαs or Gαq. Rap1GAP interacts more avidly with the unactivated Gαo as compared with the mutant (Q205L)-activated Gαo. When expressed in HEK-293 cells, unactivated Gαo co-immunoprecipitates with the Rap1GAP. Expression of chick Rap1GAP in PC-12 cells inhibited activation of Rap1 by forskolin. When unactivated Gαo was expressed, the amount of activated Rap1 was greatly increased. This effect was not observed with the Q205L-Gαo. Expression of unactivated Gαo stimulated MAP-kinase (MAPK1/2) activity in a Rap1GAP-dependent manner. These results identify a novel function of Gαo, which in its resting state can sequester Rap1GAP thereby regulating Rap1 activity and consequently gating signal flow from Rap1 to MAPK1/2. Thus, activation of Go could modulate the Rap1 effects on a variety of cellular functions. We used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact directly with Gαo.

Heterotrimeric G proteins function as signal transducers for receptors for a large number of hormones, neurotransmitters, autocrine and paracine factors, cytokines, and sensory signals. Both the Gα (1Fung B.K. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) and the Gβγ subunits (2Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y. Galper J. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1987; 325: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar) are capable of transferring receptor signals to effectors. There are four families of Gα subunits (3Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). Direct effectors for the Gαs (4Smit M.J.

Gαt, the visual G protein, activates the cGMP phosphodiesterase (1Fung B.K. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, direct effectors for Gαo, an abundant G protein in the brain (8Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Neer E.J.

We used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify potential Gαo effectors. For this purpose, we screened the chick dorsal root ganglion cDNA library with the mutationally (Q205L) activated form of Gαo. In this article we present data indicating that the inactive form of Gαo preferentially interacts with Rap1GAP 1The abbreviations used are: Rap1GAP, Rap1 GTPase-activating protein; CPRG, chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside; HEPES, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NGF, nerve growth factor; RGS, regulators of G protein signaling; RalGDS, Ral GDP dissociation stimulator. and thus regulates the activity of the small G protein Rap. The cDNA synthesis system was from Life Technologies, Inc. Anti-Gαo and anti-MAPK2 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Anti-M2-FLAG antibody was from Sigma, anti-GαI-3/o antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and phospho-specific and total MAPK antibodies were from New England Biolabs. Most biochemicals were from Sigma, and cell culture supplies were from Life Technologies, Inc. All restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Yeast culture media and amino acids were from CLONTECH. DNA plasmid preparation reagents and Effectene and Superfect transfection reagents were from Qiagen, Inc. ECL reagents were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents were of the highest grade available. A directional oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library was constructed from 12-day embryonic chick dorsal root ganglion mRNA. cDNA was synthesized using a cDNA synthesis system and ligated into the GAL4 DNA-activation domain plasmid pPC86 using the SalI/NotI restriction sites (11Vidal M. Bartel P.L. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 109-147Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated from the unamplified library using a Qiafilter Plasmid Maxi Kit. Q205L-Gαo was cloned into theSalI/NotI restriction sites of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain plasmid pPC97-cycloheximide (11Vidal M. Bartel P.L. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 109-147Google Scholar). The Q205L-Gαo-BD plasmid and the library were co-transformed into the yeast strain MaV203, plated on selective media lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and containing 25 mm3-aminotriazole, and incubated at 30 °C for 3 days. His+colonies were then tested for β-galactosidase activity using a filter lift assay. Plasmid DNA was then isolated from positive yeast clones and reintroduced into MaV203 yeast expressing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in-frame with either the wild type or Q205L-GαocDNA. Positive clones were then sequenced, and BLAST analysis was performed using GenBankTM. The Gαq, Gαs, and Gαi-2 cDNAs encoding both the wild type and the constitutively activated mutants were subcloned into the pPC97-cycloheximide plasmid. The MaV203 yeast strain was co-transformed with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and GAL4 DNA activation domain plasmids as indicated and incubated on selective media lacking tryptophan and leucine for 3 days at 30 °C. Clones were grown for 24 h in selective liquid media and then inoculated into complete media and grown to an A600 of 1.5. Yeast were lyzed with glass beads and incubated in a CPRG assay buffer (100 mmHEPES, pH 7.3, 154 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm l-aspartate, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 2 mm CPRG (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2–24 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of ZnCl2to 1 mm, and the absorbance was measured at 574 nm. HEK-293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were transfected using Effectene and harvested after 48 h in Buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 6 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). One mg of whole cell lysate was pre-cleared for 1 h with protein G-agarose at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were performed overnight with 5 μg of M2-FLAG monoclonal antibody at 4 °C followed by a 4-h incubation with 25 μl of protein G-agarose. Samples were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing protease inhibitors and then resolved using SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose, the membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk, immunoblotted with anti-M2-FLAG (1 μg/ml), anti-Gαo(1:2000), or anti-Gαi-3/o (1:2000) antibodies followed by either rabbit or mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Bands were visualized using the ECL detection method. PC-12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum, 0.5% glutamine and seeded at one million cells/10-cm dish. Cells were transfected with 10 μg of FLAG-Rap1b (containing tandem FLAG epitopes at the N terminus of the Rap1b cDNA) in pcDNA3 with or without 10 μg of wild type or the constitutively active versions of Gαo or vector using Superfect per the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four h after transfection, the medium was replaced with low serum-containing media (0.1% horse serum) for 12 h. Cells were treated with 10 μm forskolin/IBMX (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) for 10 min, rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, and lyzed in lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 μm aprotinin, and 1 mm Na3VO4). Activated Rap1b was isolated from cell lysates using a protocol adapted from Frankeet al. (12Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and supernatants containing 1 mg of total protein incubated with 60 μg of Gst-RalGDS-Rap binding domain (Gst-RalGDS was a gift form Dr. Bos, Utrecht University, The Netherlands to P. J. S. S.) pre-coupled to glutathione beads. After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, beads were pelleted and rinsed three times with lysis buffer, and protein was eluted from the beads using Laemmli buffer. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 12% gel followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk for 1 h and probed with the anti-M2-FLAG monoclonal antibody followed by an HRP-conjugated anti-mouse monoclonal secondary antibody. Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. The transfection efficiency of FLAG-Rap1b and Gαo plasmids was evaluated using 20 μg of cell lysate by immunoblotting using anti-FLAG and anti-Gαo antibodies. PC-12 cells were transfected with 10 μg of Flag-MAPK2 (containing tandem FLAG epitopes at the N terminus of MAPK2) in pcDNA3 with or without 10 μg of wild type or constitutively active versions of Gαo, Rap1GAP, or vector. Twenty-four h after transfection, the medium was replaced with low serum-containing medium (0.1% horse serum) for 12 h. Cells were stimulated with NGF (50 ng/ml) for 10 min, rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, and lyzed in MAPK lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mmNa3VO4). Five hundred μg of whole cell lysate was immunoprecipitated for 2 h with 5 μg of M2-FLAG monoclonal antibody pre-coupled to protein G-agarose. Samples were separated by gel electrophoresis followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% milk and probed with anti-phospho-MAPK antibody (1:1000), which is specific for the active form of MAPK1/2, followed by mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000). Proteins were visualized using ECL detection. Controls for MAPK2 loading were performed using M2-FLAG monoclonal antibody. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we screened the chick DRG library with Q205L-Gαo as the bait. Initial screens dorsal root ganglion positive interacting clones. Further analysis of the true positive clones allowed us to identify four interacting proteins in the initial screens. These proteins are listed in TableI. The sequences for all of these proteins have been submitted to GenBankTM, and the accession numbers are listed in Table I. The first protein identified was Gz-GAP, an RGS that has been characterized by other groups to selectively regulate the GTPase activity of Gαz (13Glick J.L. Meigs T.E. Miron A. Casey P.J. J. Biol.

We have named this protein RGS-17. Furthermore, we identified a protein that does not appear to have functional homology with other known proteins. However, it has a region that is similar to clone called KIAA0514 in the human gene data base. These three clones at the present time have not been studied any further in our laboratory. The fourth Gαo interacting protein we found was the chick homologue of the human Rap1GAP (15Rubinfeld B. Munemitsu S. Clark R. Conroy L. Watt K. Crosier W.J. McCormick F. Polakis P. Cell. 1991; 65: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Because we were interested in Gαo effectors, we hypothesized that such effectors would bind more avidly to the activated form Gαo than to the inactive wild type form. To determine whether Rap1GAP interacted preferentially with Q205L-Gαo, we used a yeast two-hybrid assay. Much to our surprise we found that Rap1GAP bound more avidly to the wild type-Gαo than to Q205L-Gαo (Fig. 1A). The interaction of Rap1GAP with Gαo is specific, because no interactions were observed with either wild type or mutant activated Gαs or Gαq. The Rap1GAP did interact with Gαi2, but only a small difference could be detected between the active and inactive forms (Fig. 1B). We next determined whether Gαo and Rap1GAP interacted within the context of a mammalian cell. For this determination, we tagged the Rap1GAP with the FLAG epitope at the N terminus and co-expressed it with wild type and Q205L-Gαo in HEK-293 cells. Lysates from the cells were immunoprecipated with the anti-M2-FLAG antibody; the immunoprecipitate was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted with an antibody against the carboxyl terminus of Gαi-3, which is specific for Gαi-3 and Gαo. Whole cell lysates from cells transfected with the empty FLAG vector did not show any Gαo in the immunoprecipitates, even though both the wild type and activated Gαo were being expressed (Fig. 2, left panels). However, when the Rap1GAP was co-expressed, the wild type Gαo was more extensively imunoprecipitated than the Q205L-Gαo. (Fig. 2, upper right panel). Rap1GAP also appears to interact with a native protein in HEK-293 cells, which is either Gαo or Gαi-3. This finding is not surprising because it interacted with Gαi-2 in the yeast two-hybrid assay. The levels of Rap1GAP in the immunoprecipitates are very similar (Fig. 2,middle right panel) as are the levels of expressed Gαo and Q205L-Gαo (Fig. 2, lower right panel).Figure 2Co-immunoprecipitation of Rap1GAP and wild type Gαo. HEK-293 cells were transfected with the indicated expression constructs, and total cell lysates prepared. One mg of lysate was immunoprecipitated with the M2-FLAG antibody and resolved using SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with a Gαi-3/o antibody (top panel), and the membrane was stripped and further blotted with the M2-FLAG antibody (middle panel). Fifty μg of total cell lysate was also resolved using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the Gαi-3/o antibody (bottom panel) (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next determined whether the chick Rap1GAP has GTPase modulating activity. For this we transfected PC-12 cells with Rap1GAP and FLAG-tagged Rap1 (to allow for the examination of Rap1 in transfected cells). Cells were treated with or without 10 μmforskolin to activate Rap1 (16Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were prepared, incubated with Gst-RalGDS, which binds the GTP-bound form of Rap1 (12Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), and exposed to glutathione beads. Material adsorbed onto the beads was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted with M2-FLAG antibody. When Rap1GAP cDNA was not used in the transfection, forskolin-dependent activation of Rap could be readily observed (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2) as previously demonstrated in these cells (16Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). However, when Rap1GAP was also used in the transfection no activation of Rap1 was observed (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). We next determined whether Gαo regulated the Rap1GAP modulation of Rap1 activity. Cells were transfected with wild type or Q205L-Gαo with the Rap1GAP, and FLAG-tagged Rap1. Cells were treated with forskolin to activate Rap1. When Gαo was used, even without forskolin, Rap1 activation was observed (Fig. 3, lane 5), presumably because Gαo binds the transfected as well as the endogenous Rap1GAP inactivating it, thus allowing Rap1 activation. The addition of forskolin did not yield any further activation (Fig. 3, lane 6), which suggests that endogenous Rap1GAP may be essential to regulate Rap1 activity. In contrast, when Q205L-Gαo was used, activated Rap1 was inhibited under basal conditions and was not stimulated even by incubation with forskolin (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 8). This finding may result from the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by the activated form of Gαo or some other unrecognized Gαo signaling pathway. The experiments shown in Fig. 3 indicate that inactive but not activated Gαo can facilitate the activation of Rap1 by sequestering Rap1GAP. Because it is known that Rap1 regulates the activity of B-Raf and that B-Raf can regulate the activation state of MAPK1/2 (16Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar), we next examined the effect of both wild type Gαo and Q205L-Gαo on MAPK signaling. For this determination, PC-12 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged MAPK2 with and without Rap1GAP, Gαo, or Q205L-Gαo and then exposed to NGF to activate MAPK. When cells were treated with NGF, activation of MAPK2 was observed (Fig. 4,lanes 1 and 2) as had previously been demonstrated (17York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). When Rap1GAP was expressed, stimulation of MAPK2 by NGF was not observed (Fig. 4, lanes 7 and 8), indicating that the activation of MAPK2 is dependent on Rap1. When wild type Gαo was expressed, there was a basal activation state of MAPK2 that could not be potentiated by NGF treatment (Fig. 4,lanes 3 and 4). However, when Q205L-Gαo was expressed, MAPK2 activation by NGF was inhibited (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6), which is in agreement with the activation state of Rap1 (see Fig. 3). These data support the idea that unactivated Gαo but not activated Gαo is able to sequester Rap1GAP, thus regulating Rap1 signaling leading to an increase in the activated state of MAPK2. The studies described here show that Gαo in its unactivated state can selectively interact with Rap1GAP. The region of Rap1GAP involved in interaction with Gαo is currently not known. However, the N terminus of Rap1GAP is highly conserved between the chicken and human sequence, and in fact all of the independent two-hybrid clones for chicken Rap1GAP contained the entire N terminus. This finding is intriguing because the N-terminal 35 amino acids of Rap1GAP are highly similar to regions conserved in two other Gα interacting proteins: LGN, a Gαi-2 interacting protein (18Mochizuki N. Cho G. Wen B. Insel P.A. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 181: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and PCP-2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Gαo (19Luo Y. Denker B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10685-10688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This similarity suggests that the N terminus of Rap1GAP may be the region that interacts with Gαo and that this conserved domain may be used by proteins to interact specifically with Gαi family subunits. This interaction between Gαo and Rap1GAP results in the sequestration of Rap1GAP such that the levels of activated Rap1 increases. Thus, one might envisage that activation of Gowould lead to the inhibition of Rap and consequently of Rap-mediated signaling. Thus, Go like Gi would be able to negatively modulate signaling by the cAMP pathway, but for Go this would occur at the level of Rap. In contrast to our current cannonical model of G protein regulation of intracellular signaling, we propose that Gαo does so in a hitherto unrecognized manner. Rather than the activated form of Gαo binding to and regulating an effector, it is the inactive form that binds an inhibitory protein (Rap1GAP). Activation of Gαo would release Rap1GAP, which then would be free to inhibit the activity of Rap. Although this mechanism is quite the opposite of the manner in which other heterotrimeric G protein subunits regulate signal flow, it is not entirely implausible. First, Gαo is the most abundant of the G protein α subunits and is particularly abundant in the brain, as is Rap1GAP (15Rubinfeld B. Munemitsu S. Clark R. Conroy L. Watt K. Crosier W.J. McCormick F. Polakis P. Cell. 1991; 65: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar); hence, it is possible that there is enough Gαo such that part of it can be used to sequester Rap1GAP. Second, Go is most often coupled to inhibitory receptors such as the α2-adrenergic (20Diverse-Pierluissi M. Goldsmith P.K. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1995; 14: 191-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and opiate receptors (21Moises H.C. Rusin K.I. Macdonald R.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3842-3851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the brain. Activation of these receptors results in the inhibition of cAMP signaling, because cAMP is capable of activating Rap via both protein kinase A and the newly discovered exchange factors that directly bind cAMP (22Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar, 23de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). Interestingly, forskolin's activation of Rap1, but not that of Gαo, was blocked by protein kinase A inhibitor (PKI; data not shown). Gαo may be able to antagonize cAMP-dependent gene expression, especially signals routed through the Rap1 → B-Raf → MAPK1/2 pathway (24Impey S. Obrietan K. Storm D.R. Neuron. 1999; 23: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), in neurons by interacting with Rap1GAP. The experiments shown in Fig. 4 support such a mechanism of regulation. Thus Go-coupled receptors could gate signal flow through the Rap1 to B-Raf pathway (25Iyengar R. Science. 1996; 271: 461-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 26Jordan J.D. Iyengar R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1347-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The physiological significance remains to be determined. This interaction of Gαo with Rap1GAP is not likely to explain all of the biological actions of Gαo. Activated Gαo has been shown to trigger neurite outgrowth in neuronal cells (27Strittmatter S.M. Fishman M.C. Zhu X.P. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2327-2338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although activated Rap1 can induce neurites in PC-12 cells (16Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar), Rap1 activation was not detected in this study using activated Gαo. Therefore, it does not appear feasible that the effects on Rap will explain how activated Gαostimulates neurite outgrowth nor its reported regulation of tyrosine kinases in chick dorsal root ganglion neurons (10Diverse-Pierluissi M. Remmers A.E. Neubig R.R. Dunlap K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5417-5421Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Other studies in our laboratory indicate that in NIH-3T3 cells, Q205L-Gαoactivates Stat-3 via Src. 2P. T. Ram, C. M. Horvath, and R. Iyengar, submitted for publication. The relevance of this pathway in neuronal cells is currently not known. The search for direct effectors regulated by activated Gαocontinues."

https://openalex.org/W2000044234,"Abstract Following cellular secretion into the extracellular matrix, tropoelastin is transported, deposited, and cross-linked to make elastin. Assembly by coacervation was examined for an isoform of tropoelastin that lacks the hydrophilic domain encoded by exon 26A. It is equivalent to a naturally secreted form of tropoelastin and shows similar coacervation performance to its partner containing 26A, thereby generalizing the concept that splice form variants are able to coacervate under comparable conditions. This is optimal under physiological conditions of temperature, salt concentration, and pH. The proteins were examined for their ability to interact with extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycans. These negatively charged molecules interacted with positively charged lysine residues and promoted coacervation of tropoelastin in a temperature- and concentration-dependent manner. A testable model for elastin-glycosaminoglycan interactions is proposed, where tropoelastin deposition during elastogenesis is encouraged by local exposure to matrix glycosaminoglycans. Unmodified proteins are retained at ∼3 μm dissociation constant. Following lysyl oxidase modification of tropoelastin lysine residues, they are released from glycosaminoglycan interactions, thereby permitting those residues to contribute to elastin cross-links."
https://openalex.org/W2030468733,"Iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) regulates the synthesis of proteins involved in iron homeostasis by binding to iron-responsive elements (IREs) of messenger RNA.

Over the last 10 years, proteins known as iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) 1The abbreviations used are: IRP, iron regulatory protein; rhIRP, recombinant human IRP; mAcn, mitochondrial aconitase; cAcn, cytoplasmic aconitase; IRE, iron-responsive element; ROS, reactive oxygen species; 2ME, 2-mercaptoethanol; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; DEPMPO, 5-(diethoxyphosphoryl)-5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide. have been recognized as the major regulatory factors for iron uptake and storage in most mammalian cells (1Klausner R.D.

A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). These proteins bind to specific stem-loop structures (3Theil E.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), the iron-responsive elements (IREs), on the mRNA of the target genes to repress translation or enhance mRNA stability. Ferritin subunits, transferrin receptors, and erythroid 5-aminolevulinic acid synthetase are regulated by IRPs, but other proteins, such as subunit b of Drosophila succinate dehydrogenase and mitochondrial aconitase, the involvement of which in iron metabolism is less direct, display IREs on their mRNA. IRPs may thus have more widespread regulatory functions, all the more so as they have been shown to respond to stress mediators and signaling agents, such as nitrogen monoxide, cytokines, and hydrogen peroxide, in addition to iron concentration. IRP1 belongs to an isomerase family of proteins containing one [4Fe-4S] cluster and including mitochondrial aconitase (4Frishman D. Hentze M.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It exhibits aconitase activity (5Kennedy M.C. Mende-Mueller L. Blondin G.A. Beinert H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The reciprocal control of both activities (“iron-sulfur switch”) appears as a key mechanism in the regulatory function of IRP1. Low concentrations of H2O2 induce a fast and potent activation of IRP1 in intact cells, but not in lysates (8Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W.

The latter results seemingly contradict the notion that reactive oxygen species (ROS) 2Throughout this paper, ROS refers to reduced oxygen derivatives excluding those, such as nitrogen monoxide or ONOO−, generated in the presence of nitrogen compounds that have not been studied herein. in general, and H2O2 in particular, directly target and destroy iron-sulfur clusters (12Flint D.H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29409-29415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). H2O2 is a by-product of aerobic metabolism and serves as an effector molecule in cell defense; it modulates cellular functions either as a direct oxidation agent or as a signaling molecule (14Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar), and the exact role of H2O2 in the conversion of IRP1 activities needs to be fully defined. The efficient heterologous production of human IRP1 (rhIRP1) with its full content of [4Fe-4S] cluster has allowed us to assess the consequences of reactions with oxygen derivatives on the functional properties of the cytoplasmic aconitase. All experiments using the IRE probe were carried out in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated solutions. A human ferritin H-chain IRE probe was33P-labeled as described (15Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1267-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) using T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and a mixture of ribonucleoside triphosphates containing [α-33P]UTP synthesized from the XbaI-linearized plasmid I12CAT (16Gray N.K. Quick S. Constable A. Hirling H. Kühn L.C. Hentze M.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was separated by denaturing electrophoresis on a 20% acrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer, and the labeled probe was extracted in 0.5m ammonium acetate, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS before ethanol precipitation. IRP1 binding to the probe was carried out in an anaerobic chamber ensuring an oxygen concentration of less than 2 ppm (Jacomex, Livry-Gargan, France). 10-μl reactions were carried out for 20 min in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 3 mm MgSO4, 40 mm KCl with 0.4 unit of human placental ribonuclease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 5 mg/ml of heparin were then added, and incubation was continued for 10 min. 1 μl of 50% glycerol with 0.05% bromphenol blue was added to each reaction mixture. The samples were separated (outside the anaerobic chamber in a cold room) on a nondenaturing 5% acrylamide gel in 0.25× Tris borate-EDTA buffer after 1 h of preelectrophoresis at 80 V. The gel was run for 75 min at a constant voltage of 80 V and dried under vacuum. The radioactive bands were analyzed by quantitative autoradiography (PhosphorImager, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Plasmid pT7-His-hIRF contains the complete cDNA for human IRP1 fused downstream of a histidine anchor (16Gray N.K. Quick S. Constable A. Hirling H. Kühn L.C. Hentze M.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The tag was removed as follows. A 283-base pair DNA fragment corresponding to the intact 5′-coding sequence of hIRP1 was amplified with the NS1 (5′-ggatccatcagtacatatgagcaacccattcgc) and NS3 (5′-cccgtaaagtcctgcaggatgacac) oligonucleotides. NS1 was designed to introduce a NdeI recognition sequence (catatg) overlapping the start codon. The amplified fragment was digested withNdeI and PstI and cloned intoNdeI-PstI-cleaved pT7–7 (17Tabor S. Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 16.2.1-16.2.11Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was cleaved with HindIII and PstI and ligated with the PstI-HindIII fragment from pT7-His-hIRF. The sequence of the final plasmid was checked by dideoxynucleotide termination sequencing and corresponded to the intact coding sequence of the human IRP1 cDNA inserted into the multiple cloning site of pT7–7. The bacterial synthesis of human IRP1 was evidenced by [35S]Cys labeling under different growth conditions, as described (18Moulis J.-M. Davasse V. DeJésus F. BioMetals. 1994; 7: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, 5 μg of induced Escherichia coli K38/pGP1–2 extracts containing the pT7–7-based plasmid with the intact coding sequence of the human IRP1 displayed a strong retarded band in the standard IRE binding assay similar in intensity to that produced by 5 μg of E. coli BL21(DE3)/pT7-His-hIRF extracts. E. coli K38/pGP1–2 extracts did not give rise to any complex with labeled IRE (not shown). The large scale (20 l) bacterial production of hIRP1 was carried out in Terrific broth (Life Technologies, Inc.). The bacteria were grown at 30 °C until they reached early stationary phase. Synthesis of T7 RNA polymerase was induced for 1 h at 42 °C and the production of hIRP1 lasted for 3–5 h after cooling the medium back to 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and kept at −80 °C until use. All purification steps and subsequent experiments were carried out in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 0.2 mm citrate, 0.05 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Buffer A) under strictly anaerobic conditions using argon lines or an anaerobic chamber (19Quinkal I. Davasse V. Gaillard J. Moulis J.-M. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Both activities of IRP1 (aconitase and IRE binding) were measured. The lysate obtained by ultrasonic treatment was fractionated by 25–65% saturation ammonium sulfate precipitation at 4 °C. The 65%-pellet was dialyzed overnight and loaded successively on two ion-exchange columns, 30 ml of CM52 followed by 50 ml of DE52 (Whatman) equilibrated in Buffer A. The active fraction did not bind and was chromatographed on a 200 ml phenyl-Sepharose CL 4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after adding 20% saturated ammonium sulfate. rhIRP1 was eluted by Buffer A and loaded on a 150-ml hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Gel HTP, Bio-Rad). 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, with 0.2 mmcitrate were used to recover rhIRP1, which was gel-filtrated on a 500-ml column of Sephacryl S-200 HR (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in Buffer A. A final purification step was carried out on a PL-SAX (Polymer Laboratories) high pressure liquid chromatography column equilibrated in Buffer A and developed with a 0–0.1 msodium chloride gradient to give the material characterized in Fig. 1. Pig heart mitochondrial aconitase was obtained from Sigma and further purified by a combination of cation exchange and gel filtration steps. The partially active fraction was activated by incubation with 5 mmdithiothreitol, 25 μm FeSO4, and 12.5 μm Na2S, desalted, and quickly analyzed for protein concentration and enzymatic activity. The aconitase activities were measured either by monitoring NADPH production in the coupled assay with isocitrate dehydrogenase (20Rose I.A. O'Connell E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1870-1879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for partially purified fractions or by recording the decrease of absorbance at 240 nm corresponding to the decrease of cis-aconitate used as substrate (21Henson C.P. Cleland W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3833-3838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with pure enzymes. Protein concentrations were measured by established methods (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar, 23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and agreed within 20%. Using an extinction coefficient at 400 nm of 16000 m−1cm−1 for pure rhIRP1 gave similar values. For the experiments assessing the reactivity of rhIRP1 with H2O2, a 30% H2O2solution in water (Aldrich) was filtrated, right before use, through a mixed bed AG 501-X8 resin (Bio-Rad) to remove any contaminating ionized material. Caution: this procedure is potentially hasardous and care has been taken to minimize the amounts of processed reactants. After thorough removal of oxygen by sparging the solution with argon, the H2O2 concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (ε240 nm = 40m−1 cm−1). These deionized solutions could not reduce cytochrome c. The reactions between 20 μm pure rhIRP1 and H2O2 were in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, in the absence of substrate; the aconitase activity was periodically measured with 25 μg of protein and saturating amounts (200 μm) of cis-aconitate. The rates ofcis-aconitate conversion were initially irreproducible; it was then realized that experimental conditions implementing argon lines and liquid handling with stainless steel needles were prone to leak uncontrolled amounts of metals in the presence of H2O2. Consequently, kinetic experiments have all been carried out in an anaerobic chamber with disposable plastic dispensing equipment. As an example, this procedure yielded rate constants for inactivation of IRP1 by H2O2agreeing within 20% for different experiments. The conditions for recording UV-visible and EPR spectra were as described (19Quinkal I. Davasse V. Gaillard J. Moulis J.-M. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The spin trapping agent DEPMPO was obtained from Oxis International, Inc. (Portland, OR). Numerous reports have previously described the production of IRP1 in many different systems (7Emery-Goodman A. Hirling H. Scarpellino L. Henderson B. Kühn L.C.

None of the expression and purification strategies were designed to recover the protein as pure cAcn with its full content of [4Fe-4S] cluster. The scheme described under “Materials and Methods” afforded a protein migrating as a single band of apparent molecular weight around 95,000 on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1A). Amino acid sequencing of this material gave the first eleven residues expected for human IRP1 starting with the serine following the initial methionine. Fig. 1B shows the electronic absorption spectrum of rhIRP1. In addition to the protein maximum at 280 nm, a broad band centered at about 400 nm gave a yellow-brownish color to the sample and indicated the presence of a chromophore. The visible band accounted for about one tenth of the intensity at 280 nm. UV-visible spectra of cytoplasmic aconitases purified from natural sources have not been reported, but the visible absorbance of pure bovine mAcn (see, for example, Ref. 28Kennedy M.C. Antholine W.E. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20340-20347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) is very similar to that of rhIRP1. The EPR spectrum of rhIRP1 is axial and virtually identical to previously reported spectra of bovine cAcn (5Kennedy M.C. Mende-Mueller L. Blondin G.A. Beinert H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EPR double integration, using a copper EDTA reference, of several preparations yielded values of less than 0.1 spin/protein molecule, indicating that only a minority of the rhIRP1 molecules binds a [3Fe-4S] cluster. In contrast, purifications of mammalian mAcn were designed to quantitatively recover the stable but inactive [3Fe-4S] form that can be reactivated in vitro (29Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. Stout C.D. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2335-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The rhIRP1 molecules devoid of metals do not contribute to the visible part of the spectrum in Fig. 1B. The concentration of those displaying IRE binding activity was assessed with increasing amounts of rhIRP1 assayed under anaerobic conditions. The activity of 20 ng of the protein as isolated was hardly detected, whereas addition of 2% 2ME, which fully reveals the IRE binding activity (30Hentze M.W. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Science. 1989; 244: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), to as little as 2 ng gave a clear retarded band on gels (not shown). Approximately 50-fold more rhIRP1 in the absence of 2% 2ME was necessary to obtain as much IRP1-IRE complex as formed in the presence of the reducing thiol. It can therefore be estimated conservatively that the IRE-binding active form of rhIRP1 as isolated represents less than 5% of the total preparation. The high visible/UV absorbance ratio for a protein of this size combined with the very small concentrations of molecules with [3Fe-4S] clusters or displaying IRE binding activity indicate that rhIRP1 is mainly (>80%) isolated as cytoplasmic aconitase containing one [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster. This conclusion is borne out by the enzymatic properties of purified rhIRP1. The catalytic efficiency of rhIRP1 measured as thekcat/Km ratio in the conversion of cis-aconitate was not significantly different from that of reactivated mitochondrial aconitase and did not change under conditions favoring the insertion of [4Fe-4S] clusters (Table I).Table ICompared kinetic parameters between cAcn and mAcnmAcncAcnKM (μm)6.5 (1.4)31 (14)kcat (s−1)8.0 (0.3)24.0 (0.6)kcat/Km(s−1 μm−1)1.2 (0.3)0.8 (0.4)Activities were measured with cis-aconitate as substrate in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, using 8 μg of mACN or 25 μg of rhIRP1.

In addition to switch activities as a function of the intracellular iron concentration, IRP1 has been shown to respond to a variety of cellular conditions, many of them contributed by ROS and referred to as oxidative stress (2Hentze M.W.

Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar), the aconitase activity of rhIRP1 was insensitive to exposure of the enzyme in air for more than 90 min. However, superoxide ion production aerobically (from the xanthine/xanthine oxidase reaction) or anaerobically (from KO2) rapidly bleached the aconitase activity (Fig. 2A). Similar results have already been reported for other aconitases (12Flint D.H. Tuminello J.F. Emptage M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22369-22376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19328-19333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Gardner P.R.

Biophys. 1998; 359: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and, because of the efficient inhibition of aconitase activity by superoxide anion, all other reactions reported herein have been carried out under strictly anaerobic conditions. The reactivity of the aconitase form of IRP1 with hydrogen peroxide was investigated. When 100 μm deionized H2O2 was added to 20 μm rhIRP1 as isolated, the aconitase activity decreased (Fig. 2). However, adding ferrous sulfate to the medium inhibited the loss of activity until no inactivation was detected for 90 min with 100 μmFeSO4. Relatively low concentrations of ferrous sulfate decreased the rate of cAcn inactivation when added before H2O2 (Fig. 2) and the inhibition was stopped when large concentrations of metal were added after some reaction with hydrogen peroxide had already occurred (Fig. 2B). Glutathione (1 mm) did not resume inhibition. In contrast to ferrous sulfate, 100 μm ferric chloride, sodium sulfate, or ferrozine could not protect rhIRP1 from the inhibitory effect of 100 μm H2O2, and 100 μm ferrous EDTA hardly interfered with the reaction (Fig. 2A). These observations on aconitase activity in the presence of ferrous ions may well explain the inconsistency of our initial measurements carried out with stainless steel needles (see under “Materials and Methods”). The presence of 100 μm either citrate or trans-aconitate did not afford protection of cAcn against inactivation by H2O2. Although rhIRP1 as isolated is marginally active in binding IRE (Fig. 3, lane 2), the protein can be efficiently activated to bind to IRE, for instance by incubation with high concentrations of 2ME (Fig. 3, lane 1). In this respect, the recombinant preparation described herein compares with previously reported ones for which high IRE binding activities were obtained (7Emery-Goodman A. Hirling H. Scarpellino L.

The usual description of the IRE-binding activation of IRP1 is that of the destruction of the iron-sulfur cluster liberating its three cysteine ligands and exposing other residues of the active site to interaction with IRE (6Haile D.J.

H2O2reaction with rhIRP1, under conditions that almost completely inhibit aconitase activity (Fig. 2B), failed to reveal the IRE binding activity (Fig. 3, lanes 3–6), although the aconitase-inactive protein kept the ability to be activated for IRE binding by 2ME (Fig. 3, lane 7). The presence of 100 μm FeSO4 in the reaction medium, which prevents aconitase inhibition, did not change this pattern (Fig. 3,lanes 8–14). Therefore, direct reaction of H2O2 with rhIRP1 failed to convert the protein into its IRE-binding form, even under conditions that suppress its aconitase activity. Besides its two (aconitase and IRE-binding) active forms, other molecular species of IRP1 may occur, such as proteins with oxidized cysteines unable to interact with IRE (40Cairo G. Castrusini E. Minotti G. Bernelli-Zazzera A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1326-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 41Bouton C. Hirling H. Drapier J.-C. J. Biol.

Antholine W.E. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20340-20347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The fate of metal ions during inactivation of rhIRP1 by H2O2 has been monitored. Under the conditions of Fig. 2, the inactivation of rhIRP1 was not correlated with any changes of the visible absorbance at 400 nm. However, the difference spectrum obtained by subtracting spectra before reaction with H2O2 from those recorded after displayed two maxima at 335 and 485 nm (not shown). This difference spectrum is strikingly similar to that of Azotobacter vinelandii ferredoxin I minus Clostridium pasteurianumferredoxin taken as representative examples of [4Fe4S]2+ [3Fe-4S]+ and 2[4Fe-4S]2+ proteins, respectively. When the same reaction was followed by EPR, the characteristic signal of [3Fe-4S]+ clusters as in Fig. 1C built up to reach a plateau at 1 spin/protein molecule as cAcn activity disappeared. Only a minor increase of the high spin ferric EPR signal at g = 4.3 was detected (Fig. 4B). This conversion of [4Fe-4S]2+ into [3Fe-4S]+ releases iron. The experiment between 20 μm rhIRP1 and 100 μmH2O2 was carried out in the presence of ferrozine, a strong chelator of ferrous ions. The calculated concentration of Fe(Fz)32+ was slightly smaller than that of the protein when aconitase activity was abolished, and it slowly decreased afterward (Fig. 5), probably as the result of oxidation by excess H2O2. When ferrozine was replaced by desferal, a strong chelator of ferric ions, the EPR spectra elicited a high spin ferric signal at g = 4.3, the intensity of which was correlated with that of the [3Fe-4S]+ signal in the g = 2 region (Figs. 4 and 5). The same correlation was found with the visible absorbance due to ferrioxamine (Fig. 5). When desferal was added after the reaction between the protein and hydrogen peroxide was completed, the maximal g = 4.3 signal intensity was developed after a few additional minutes (Fig. 4C). The presence ofcis-aconitate at the onset of the reaction also helped developing the g = 4.3 signal, probably arising from ferric citrate in this case (Fig. 4D). Increasing the H2O2 concentration did not generate other EPR signals or any visible modifica"
https://openalex.org/W2167345470,"Ubiquinone (coenzyme Q or Q) is a lipid that functions in the electron transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes and the plasma membrane of prokaryotes. Q-deficient mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae harbor defects in one of eight COQ genes (coq1–coq8) and are unable to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources. The biosynthesis of Q involves two separate O-methylation steps. In yeast, the first O-methylation utilizes 3,4-dihydroxy-5-hexaprenylbenzoic acid as a substrate and is thought to be catalyzed by Coq3p, a 32.7-kDa protein that is 40% identical to theEscherichia coli O-methyltransferase, UbiG. In this study, farnesylated analogs corresponding to the secondO-methylation step, demethyl-Q3 and Q3, have been chemically synthesized and used to study Q biosynthesis in yeast mitochondria in vitro. Both yeast and rat Coq3p recognize the demethyl-Q3 precursor as a substrate. In addition, E. coli UbiGp was purified and found to catalyze both O-methylation steps. Futhermore, antibodies to yeast Coq3p were used to determine that the Coq3 polypeptide is peripherally associated with the matrix-side of the inner membrane of yeast mitochondria. The results indicate that oneO-methyltransferase catalyzes both steps in Q biosynthesis in eukaryotes and prokaryotes and that Q biosynthesis is carried out within the matrix compartment of yeast mitochondria.

Ubiquinone is an essential lipid in the electron transport chain that is found in the inner mitochondrial membranes of eukaryotes and in the plasma membrane of prokaryotes (1Brandt U. Trumpower B.

The structure of Q 1The abbreviations used are: Q, ubiquinone or coenzyme Q; pHB, p-hydroxybenzoic acid; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; demethyl-Qn, demethyl-Q or 5-polyprenyl-2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-6-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone, wheren indicates the number of isoprenoids; COMT, catecholO-methyltransferase. consists of a quinone head group and a hydrophobic isoprenoid tail that can vary in length depending on the species in which it is found. The quinone group undergoes reversible single electron transfers, interchanging between the quinone, semiquinone, and hydroquinone, whereas the isoprenoid tail functions to anchor Q in the membrane. In eukaryotes, Q functions to shuttle electrons from either Complex I or Complex II to Complex III/bc1 complex. The transfer of electrons from Q to the bc1 complex is coupled to proton-translocation via the Q cycle mechanism that was first proposed by Mitchell (2Mitchell P. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 327-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). A number of studies support such a mechanism (for a review, see Ref. 1Brandt U. Trumpower B. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) including the recently determined complete structure of the bc1 complex (3Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). The redox properties of Q also allow it to function as a lipid soluble antioxidant. Q functions by either directly scavenging lipid peroxyl radicals (4Ernster L. Forsmark-Amdree P. Clin. Invest. 1993; 71: S60-S65Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) or indirectly reducing α-tocopherol radicals to regenerate α-tocopherol (5Kagan V. Serbinova E. Packer L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Additionally, Q protects cells from oxidative damage generated by the autoxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (7Do T. Schultz J.R. Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7534-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Q is found in many eukaryotic intracellular membranes, including the plasma membrane, where, in conjunction with a plasma membrane electron transport system, it functions to scavenge ascorbate free radicals (8Santos-Oscana C.

Crane F.L. Clarke C.F. Navas P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the plasma membrane of prokaryotes, Q participates in the maintenance of the enzymatic activity of DsbA/DsbB disulfide bond forming proteins (10Kobayashi T. Kishigami S. Sone M. Inokuchi H. Mogi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11857-11862Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and Q-deficient Escherichia coli strains are hypersensitive to thiol exposure (11Zeng H. Snavely I. Zamorano P. Javor G.T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3681-3685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, the first committed step in the biosynthesis of Q begins with the precursorsp-hydroxybenzoic acid (pHB) and isoprenoid diphosphate, in which the isoprenoid is covalently attached to the aromatic ring. The pathway derives from the characterization of accumulating Q biosynthetic intermediates in studies with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12Olson R.E. Rudney H. Vitam. Horm. 1983; 40: 1-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and E. coli (13Gibson F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1973; 1: 317-326Crossref Google Scholar) Q-deficient mutants. In yeast, Q mutant strains have been classified into eight complementation groups, and five COQ genes have been characterized. The COQ1 and COQ2 genes encode the polyprenyl diphosphate synthase and the pHB:polyprenyldiphosphate transferase, respectively (14Ashby M.N. Edwards P.A. J. Biol.

Hsu A.Y. Ha H.T. Clarke C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1748-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although eukaryotes and prokaryotes share many similar steps in Q biosynthesis, the pathway diverges after the prenylation step (16Goewert R.R. Sippel J.C. Olson R.E.

In prokaryotes, decarboxylation, hydroxylation, and methylation follow prenylation, whereas in eukaryotes, the sequence is hydroxylation, methylation, and then decarboxylation.

Surprisingly, strains harboring leaky mutant alleles of ubiG accumulate demethyl-Q8, the last intermediate in Q biosynthesis (Fig. 1, compound5), and are unable to carry out the lastO-methylation step (37Stroobant P.

Myles D.C. Clarke C.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9797-9806Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Unlike the E. coli ubi mutants, analysis of accumulating Q intermediates in yeast coq mutants has been less informative. Yeast strains harboring coq3, coq4, coq5,coq6, coq7, or coq8 mutant alleles all accumulate the same single predominant intermediate, 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (39Poon W.W. Marbois B.N. Faull K.K. Clarke C.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 40Poon W.W. Do T.Q. Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. Mol. Aspects Med. 1997; 18: s121-s127Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For this reason, it has often been instructive to compare the yeast COQ genes with the E. coli ubi gene counterparts. The encoded amino acid sequence of yeast COQ3 is 40% identical with the E. coli UbiG protein and both sequences contain the four motifs identified in a large family ofS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent methyltransferases (41Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In this study,in vitro assays have been developed that facilitate the study the catalytic role of both the UbiG and Coq3 proteins inO-methylation reactions. These assays demonstrate that each enzyme is active at all three O-methylation steps shown in Fig. 1. Mitochondria subfractionation studies indicate that the Coq3 polypeptide is a peripherally associated inner membrane protein, located on the matrix side. The results presented suggest that both the first and last O-methylation steps in the yeast Q biosynthetic pathway occur within the mitochondria matrix compartment. All reagents were used as received from Aldrich Chemical Co. unless otherwise noted. Unless specified as dry, the solvents were of unpurified reagent grade. Diethyl ether was distilled from sodium using benzophenone as an indicator. All air- or water-sensitive reactions were carried out under positive pressure of argon. Reactions were followed by TLC using Whatman precoated plates of silica gel 60 with fluorescent indicator. Reactions forming quinones were followed by leucomethylene blue stain. Normal phase flash chromatography was performed on Davisil Grade 643 silica gel (230–400 mesh). NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker ARX400 or ARX500 MHz spectrometer. Low and high resolution mass spectra were determined on a VG Autospec.

In a glove bag under N2, AlCl3 (3.29 g, 24.7 mmol) was placed into a 100-ml round-bottomed flask. The flask was sealed and transferred to an argon atmosphere before anhydrous ether (15 ml) was slowly added, followed by 3,4,5-trimethoxytoluene (7) (2.8 ml, 16.6 mmol) and acetyl chloride (1.5 ml, 17.3 mmol). The reaction mixture turned dark and murky and was stirred for 20 h at room temperature. Following the addition of water (10 ml) and concentrated HCl (1 ml), the mixture was extracted with ether (three times, 15 ml). The combined ether layers were extracted with 1 m NaOH (three times, 20 ml), and the resulting aqueous layers were acidified by dropwise addition of concentrated HCl and then cooled in an ice-bath for 1 h.

A solution of ammonium cerium (IV) nitrate (655.4 mg, 1.20 mmol) in dichloromethane:acetonitrile (1:1, 2 ml) was then added dropwise to the reaction mixture over 5 min. The solution color changed from yellow to a turbid maroon. Stirring was continued for 5 min before the reaction was quenched by the addition of 10 ml of water. The reaction mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (three times, 15 ml) and the combined organic layers were concentrated by rotary evaporation. The crude residue was redissolved in ether (20 ml) and then treated with 1m NaHCO3 (20 ml). The aqueous layer became a bright violet color. Following two washes with ether, the aqueous layer was slowly acidified using concentrated HCl until the solution color changed from deep violet to orange.

Fumigatin (30.1 mg, 0.177 mmol) was dissolved in 1:1 ether:ethanol (6 ml), and then Na2S2O4 (10% in H2O) was added dropwise to the stirred solution until decolorization of the mixture was achieved. Ether (5 ml) was added to the decolorized mixture and the organic layer was washed three times with brine, dried over MgSO4, and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting hydroquinone of fumigatin was dissolved in freshly distilled 1, 4-dioxane (6 ml) under an argon atmosphere.Trans-trans-farnesol (118 mg, 0.53 mmol) was added to the solution, followed by BF3OEt2 (79.6 ml, 0.63 mmol), and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 18 h at room temperature.

DNA constructions were performed as described (48$$Google Scholar). pTHG was constructed to express UbiG as a fusion protein with a 33-amino acid N-terminal extension, containing 6 His residues (His6-UbiG) to provide for metal affinity column purification. A DNA segment containing the complete ubiG ORF (851–1572) was generated by a polymerase chain reaction with Vent DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs) using pRPB (29Wu G. Williams H.D. Zamanian M.

Purification of His6 UbiG was done with the TALON metal affinity resin (CLONTECH) as described by the manufacturer. The E. coli strain, DH5α:pTHG, containing the His6-UbiG was grown in LB+Amp (50 μg/ml) and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration, 0.4 mm), and cells were disrupted by the French press method. His6-UbiG was purified on a TALON column under native conditions. The resin was washed with 15 mm imidazole to remove nonspecifically bound proteins, His6-UbiG was eluted from the resin with 250 mmimidazole, and the imidazole was removed by dialysis against 0.05m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. A plasmid encoding a glutathione S-transferase-Coq3p fusion protein was constructed by subcloning the 1.7-kilobase EcoRI fragment of pRS12A (17Clarke C.F. Williams W. Teruya J.H. J. Biol.

The fusion protein contained amino acids 64–316 of yeast Coq3p as a C-terminal fusion to glutathioneS-transferase and was produced in E. coli and the insoluble fraction was separated by preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 50-kDa fusion protein was visualized by copper staining (49Garfin D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 425-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and eluted from the gel by diffusion (50Harrington M.G.

The protein was injected into rabbits, and antibodies were affinity purified according to standard techniques (51Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Assays for O-methyltransferase activities were determined with the three synthetic methyl-acceptors, compounds 1, 3, and 5. Stocks of1, 3, and 5 were stored undiluted at −20 °C under argon. In assays with either 1 or3, the substrates were redissolved into methanol, and each reaction mixture (250 μl) contained 0.05 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1.0 mm ZnSO4, and 50 μl of crude yeast mitochondria (0.25–0.50 mg of protein) (52Glick P.S.

https://openalex.org/W1984363030,"The adenovirus E1A protein has been implicated in increasing cellular susceptibility to apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF); however, its mechanism of action is still unknown. Since activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) has been shown to play an anti-apoptotic role in TNF-induced apoptosis, we examined apoptotic susceptibility and NF-κB activation induced by TNF in the E1A transfectants and their parental cells. Here, we reported that E1A inhibited activation of NF-κB and rendered cells more sensitive to TNF-induced apoptosis. We further showed that this inhibition was through suppression of IκB kinase (IKK) activity and IκB phosphorylation. Moreover, deletion of the p300 and Rb binding domains of E1A abolished its function in blocking IKK activity and IκB phosphorylation, suggesting that these domains are essential for the E1A function in down-regulating IKK activity and NF-κB signaling. However, the role of E1A in inhibiting IKK activity might be indirect. Nevertheless, our results suggest that inhibition of IKK activity by E1A is an important mechanism for the E1A-mediated sensitization of TNF-induced apoptosis."

To examine the biochemical basis of this repair specificity, we characterized the mispair binding and ATPase activity of hMSH2-hMSH3. The ATPase was found to be regulated by a mismatch-stimulated ADP → ATP exchange, which induces a conformational transition by the protein complex. We demonstrated strong binding of hMSH2-hMSH3 to an insertion/deletion loop containing 24 nucleotides that is incapable of provoking ADP → ATP exchange, suggesting that mismatch recognition appears to be necessary but not sufficient to induce the intrinsic ATPase. These studies support the idea that hMSH2-hMSH3 functions as an adenosine nucleotide-regulated molecular switch that must be activated by mismatched nucleotides for classical mismatch repair to occur.

Elevated rates of spontaneous mutations may result if such mismatched nucleotides are not correctly repaired. The idea that an excision repair system exists that recognizes and repairs mismatched nucleotides was developed independently by Pauling and Hanawalt (2Pauling C. Hanawalt P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The most widely held mechanism for microsatellite instability suggests that during the replication of simple repeat tracts, the nascent DNA strand may “slip,” forming insertion/deletion loops (IDL) that would then result in the lengthening or shortening of these sequences if left unrepaired (17Kunkel T. Nature. 1993; 365: 207-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The MMR pathway appears largely responsible for the repair of IDLs as well as simple mismatched nucleotides that presumably arise as a result of misincorporation errors during DNA replication (for review see Ref.15Fishel R. Kolodner R.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 382-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the E. coli MutHLS pathway will recognize and repair all combinations of single nucleotide mismatches as well as IDLs containing one through four nucleotides but not IDLs containing five nucleotides (18Parker B.O. Marinus M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1730-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The MMR system has been highly conserved through evolution, with multiple MutS and MutL homologs having been identified in yeast and humans (for review see Ref. 16Fishel R. Wilson T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the MutS homologs scMSH2, scMSH3, and scMSH6 have been shown to be responsible for the recognition and repair of mismatches and IDLs. The scMSH2-scMSH6 heterodimer recognizes mismatched nucleotides and a subset of single- and dinucleotide IDLs, whereas the scMSH2-scMSH3 heterodimer is responsible for the repair of a overlapping set of single-nucleotide IDLs as well as IDLs of up to 13 nucleotides (19Habraken Y.

Nature. 1997; 387: 929-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, these experiments were performed by examining post meiotic segregants following mating and could be interpreted to result from altered recombination conversion tracts as suggested by Alani et al. (24Alani E. Reenan R.A. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1994; 137: 19-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is underlined by the experiments of Tran et al. (44Tran T.H. Gordenin D. Resnick M. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1579-1587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who demonstrate a dependence of IDL repair on the Rad52 recombination pathway. Under protein limiting conditions, the human MutS homologs (hMSH2, hMSH3, and hMSH6) appear very similar to their yeast counterparts with respect to mismatch binding specificity and repair (25Holmes J.J.

Genetics. 1998; 148: 1637-1646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, under conditions where the hMSH2-hMSH6 heterodimer exceeds the mismatch by 10-fold, there is evidence that binding and repair of IDLs outside the traditionally accepted range may occur (31Genschel J. Littman S.J. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19895-19901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The bacterial MutS proteins and their eukaryotic MutS homologs (MSH) contain Walker A and B consensus adenosine nucleotide and magnesium binding motifs (32Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the homology between the 48 known MSH proteins is confined to this region, suggesting that ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. Recently, the intrinsic ATP hydrolysis activity (ATPase) associated with the adenine nucleotide binding domains of the hMSH2-hMSH6 protein complex was found to regulate mismatch binding similar to a molecular switch (33Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The hMSH2-hMSH6 molecular switch is ON (bound to a mismatch) in the ADP-bound form and OFF in the ATP-bound form. Hydrolysis of the ATP molecule resulted in the recovery of mismatch binding capability, whereas ADP → ATP exchange resulted in dissociation from the mismatch. The hMSH2-hMSH6 switch appears to be regulated by the exchange of ADP → ATP, which is uniquely provoked by mismatch recognition/binding. Such a mechanism is strikingly similar to that displayed by the G protein family of purine nucleotide-binding proteins (34Bokoch G.M. Der C.J. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 750-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae and human MSH2-MSH3 heterodimers have been purified, and their mismatch binding specificities have been partially characterized. The yeast MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer appears to recognize IDLs of up to 14 nucleotides in vitro, and this binding activity has been reported to be insensitive to ATP (19Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1186-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The mispair binding specificity of the human hMSH2-hMSH3 heterodimer remains unclear as a result of the fact that nearly all of the oligonucleotides utilized in the study appear to contain single-nucleotide mismatches in addition to IDL nucleotide mismatch (21Palombo F. Iaccarino I. Nakajima E. Ikejima M. Shimada T. Jiricny J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1181-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the DNA binding specificity and ATPase activity of the hMSH2-hMSH3 protein complex. In large part, the mechanism of mispair recognition by hMSH2-hMSH3 heterodimer appears similar to the hMSH2-hMSH6 heterodimer except with respect to which nucleotide mismatches are capable of provoking ADP → ATP exchange. These results indicate that the hMSH2-hMSH3 mismatch repair complex functions as an adenosine nucleotide-regulated molecular switch and that mispair binding appears to be a necessary but not sufficient step in the repair of IDLs by the classical mismatch repair system. We entertain the possibility that hMSH2-hMSH3 may retain some functions that are independent of adenosine nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis. hMSH2 and hMSH3 clones have been described previously (29Acharya S. Wilson T. Gradia S. Kane M.F. Guerrette S. Marsischky G.T. Kolodner R. Fishel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13629-13634Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). hMSH2 and N-terminal His6-tagged hMSH3 recombinant proteins were overexpressed in Sf9 insect cells utilizing the pFastBac dual expression vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). Infected Sf9 cells were harvested and suspended in buffer A (300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.1), 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.8 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.8 μg/ml leupeptin)) followed by rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen. The following purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The cells were thawed on ice and disrupted by passage through a 25-gauge needle, and the resulting crude extract was cleared by ultracentrifugation at 40,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (Quiagen), washed with buffer A, and eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole from 20 mm to 200 mm. The hMSH2-hMSH3 complex eluted at approximately 70 mm imidazole. Peak fractions were loaded directly onto a PBE 94 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column in tandem with a heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After loading, the columns were washed with 30% buffer B (1m NaCl, 25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.1), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors), the PBE 94 column was closed, and the protein eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 300 mm to 1m. The hMSH2-hMSH3 complex eluted at approximately 600 mm NaCl. Peak fractions were dialyzed against 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.1), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol. Aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The concentration of hMSH2-hMSH3 was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The sequences of the DNA substrates were as follows: homoduplex, 5′-CCG CTG AAT TGC ACC GAG CTC GAT CCT CGA TGA TCC TAA GC-3′, and +(CA)n, 5′-CCG CTG AAT TGC ACCGAG CTC (CA)n GAT CCT CGA TGA TCC TAA GC-3′m where n = 1, 4, 8, or 12. Complimentary strand for the homoduplex and +(CA)n oligomers: 5′-GCT TAG GAT CAT CGA GGA TCG AGC TCG GTG CAA TTC AGC GG-3′. The oligomers were end-labeled utilizing [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and were annealed to a 2-fold excess of the complimentary strand followed by polyacrylamide gel purification. Unlabeled substrates were purified similarly using the labeled substrates as references for gel migration. This assay was performed with 9 fmol of labeled DNA substrate in a buffer containing 100 mmNaCl, 25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.1), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 15% glycerol, and 20 ng of 200 base pair homoduplex competitor in a final reaction volume of 20 μl. The reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min and immediately placed on ice. The samples were electrophoresed on a 5% polyacrylamide (29:1 bis), 4% glycerol gel in Tris-buffered EDTA buffer. The gels were dried and then quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Concentrations of adenosine nucleotides and magnesium were as noted in the figure legends. Dissociation constants (Kd) for hMSH2-hMSH3 binding to the various DNA substrates were determined utilizing a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager as the DNA concentration at which half-maximal binding occurs and are presented with standard deviations. ATPase and ADP → ATP exchange assays were performed as described previously utilizing the insertion/deletion DNA substrates described above (33Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Standard deviations are noted. One μg of protein per reaction was digested with 0, 40, 80, 0r 160 ng of trypsin (Promega) in buffer A (25 mm HEPES, pH 8.1, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol) at 37 °C for 45 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 2× sample loading buffer and boiling for 10 min. The proteolyzed products (0.5 μg each sample) were separated on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) and analyzed by silver staining and by Western analysis utilizing anti-hMSH2 polyclonal antibody (Ab-3; Oncogene Research Products). When indicated, proteolysis was performed with 1 mm ATPγS or ADP. hMSH2 and hMSH3 proteins were overexpressed in Sf9 insect cells as a heterodimer utilizing a dual expression baculovirus vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). This complex was purified to greater than 95% homogeneity by affinity chromatography (Fig. 1). The hMSH2-hMSH3 complex was determined to be at an approximate 1:1 molar ratio as judged by quantitative densitometry of Coomassie-stained gels. The yeast MSH2-MSH3 complex has previously been demonstrated to bind to IDLs containing up to 14 nucleotides by gel shift analysis (19Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1186-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The human hMSH2-hMSH3 complex has been shown to repair an IDL containing 12 nucleotide but not an IDL containing 27 nucleotides (31Genschel J. Littman S.J. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19895-19901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), although these experiments are complicated by a general increase in hMSH2-independent repair of the larger IDLs. To determine the binding capacity of the purified hMSH2-hMSH3 protein complex to IDLs, gel shift analysis was performed utilizing DNA substrates containing IDLs that contained CA repeats of 2, 8, 16, and 24 nucleotides. The apparent dissociation constants (Kd) were determined to be 1.6 ± 0.14 nm for the +CA, 1.8 ± 0.09 nm for the +(CA)4, 2.2 ± 0.19 nm for the (+CA)8, and 0.8 ± 0.06 nm for the +(CA)12 IDL (Fig. 2; TableI). Binding of hMSH2-hMSH3 to homoduplex DNA was not saturable up to 160 nm. Both hMSH2 and hMSH3 appear to be required for the specific high affinity binding to IDLs because purified hMSH2 (alone) displays at least a 50-fold reduced affinity for mismatched nucleotides (Kd ≈ 50–100 nm) (36Fishel R. Ewel A. Lee S. Lescoe M.K. Griffith J. Science. 1994; 266: 1403-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Taken together with the recent findings that the yeast and human MSH2-MSH3 complexes appear incapable of efficiently directing the repair of IDLs containing 16 or 27 nucleotides, respectively, these data appear to suggest that simple binding of hMSH2-hMSH3 to IDLs is not sufficient to initiate mismatch repair (22Sia E.A.

Open table in a new tab The kinetic parameters Vmax and KM were determined for hMSH2-hMSH3 on IDL substrates by varying the substrate concentration and performing Michaelis-Menton analysis. All values are presented with standard deviations. The hMSH2-hMSH3 complex was found to bind to the +(CA)12 in multiple slower-migrating forms at concentrations above 10 nm. Similar slower migrating forms of hMSH2-hMSH6 bound to a G/T mismatch were detected at concentrations above 400 nm(33Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). These slower migrating forms may indicate mispaired oligonucleotides-containing multiple protein complexes or alternate binding mechanisms. The addition of ATP to MutS homologs has been shown to result in its dissociation from mismatched nucleotides. Interestingly, we found that ATP does not alter the binding of hMSH2-hMSH3 to IDL heteroduplex DNA in the absence of magnesium. However, in the presence of 1 to 10 mmmagnesium, the binding of the hMSH2-hMSH3 complex to a +CA IDL was found to be sensitive to ATP (Fig. 3A). The ATP-dependent dissociation of hMSH2-hMSH3 from the +CA IDL reached the background level of homoduplex (G/C) binding at 10 mm magnesium (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the binding of the protein complex to a +(CA)12 IDL was relatively stable in the presence of ATP (Fig. 3B). The differential sensitivity of the hMSH2-hMSH3-DNA complex to the presence of magnesium is in contrast to results obtained for the hMSH2-hMSH6 heterodimer (33Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Additionally, the finding that ATP is capable of dissociating hMSH2-hMSH3 from small IDLs differs from studies in yeast in which the MSH2-MSH3 complex was found to remain stably bound to these substrates in the presence of ATP (19Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1186-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This disparity may reflect differences between the yeast and human hMSH2-hMSH3 homologs and/or purification schemes. The addition of ADP had no effect on binding regardless of magnesium concentration and is similar to that reported for the hMSH2-hMSH6 complex (data not shown) (33Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Dissociation of hMSH2-hMSH3 from the +CA but not the +(CA)12 IDL substrates also occurred in the presence of the poorly hydrolyzable ATP analog ATPγS (Figs. 3, D and E). We have found that hMSH2-hMSH3 does not significantly hydrolyze ATPγS (data not shown), supporting the conclusion that the release of hMSH2-hMSH3 from the +CA DNA duplex occurs independent of hydrolysis. Similar observations have been made for the bacterial MutS and the hMSH2-hMSH6 heterodimer (data not shown (33Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). It was noted that the binding of hMSH2-hMSH3 to the +CA DNA duplex was not completely abolished in the presence of magnesium and 500 μm either of ATP or ATPγS. This residual binding appeared similar to the background of hMSH2-hMSH3 binding to homoduplex DNA, which was also refractory to dissociation by ATP and ATPγS (Fig. 3, C and F). These results suggest that the residual binding of hMSH2-hMSH3 to the +CA DNA duplex in the presence of ATP and ATPγS is the likely result of nonspecific association(s). The bacterial MutS protein is known to possess a low level ATPase activity that has been conserved in the yeast and human homologs (33Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 37Haber L.T. Walker G.C.

Sokolsky T. Studamire B. Miret J.J. Lahue R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2436-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although significant literature has begun to emerge regarding the ATPase activity of the MSH2-MSH6 complex, little is currently known about the ATPase activity of the MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer. We found that IDLs stimulate the intrinsic ATPase of the hMSH2-hMSH3 heterodimer (Fig. 4A). Michaelis-Menten and Lineweaver-Burk analysis suggest that the hMSH2-hMSH3 ATPase was most active in the presence of the +CA and +(CA)4 IDLs, less active in the presence of the +(CA)8 and +(CA)12 IDLs and homoduplex DNA, and relatively inactive in the absence of DNA (Table I, Fig. 4A). These results demonstrate that IDLs containing 2 and 8 nucleotides stimulate the hydrolysis of ATP by hMSH2-hMSH3 significantly more than loops containing 16 and 24 nucleotides. The stimulation of the hMSH2-hMSH3 ATPase by IDLs largely correlates with their relative repair by the MMR system in vitro and in vivo (22Sia E.A. Kokoska R.J. Dominska M. Greenwell P. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2851-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 30Umar A. Risinger J.I. Glaab W.E. Tindall K.R. Barrett J.C. Kunkel T.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19895-19901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). However, this conclusion must be tempered by the fact that mismatch repair of the sequences context contained in the present oligonucleotides has not been performed. Adenine nucleotide exchange by hMSH2-hMSH3 in the presence of IDL DNA substrates was determined by measuring the exchange of protein bound [3H]ADP for unlabeled ATP (Fig. 4B). Nucleotide exchange was found to be very rapid in the presence of the +CA, +(CA)4 (t½ ≤ 4 s),and +(CA)8 (t½ ≅ 6 s) IDL mismatched DNAs whereas in the presence of +(CA)12(t½ ≅ 20 s) and homoduplex (t½ ≅ 40 s), the exchange was significantly slower. In the absence of DNA, relatively little exchange occurred during the 160-s reaction (t½ > 160 s). These results indicate that the binding of hMSH2-hMSH3 to IDL DNA substrates stimulates the exchange of ADP → ATP resulting in the release from the mismatch and recycling of the protein complex. Protein footprinting by partial proteolysis has been widely performed to determine the structural domains of proteins, protein-protein interaction sites, and conformational changes induced by ligand binding. To detect conformational changes induced by binding of the hMSH2-hMSH3 protein complex to ADP and ATPγS, partial proteolysis was carried out utilizing modified trypsin. We observed different protease accessibility, as exhibited by altered banding patterns on a silver-stained gel, when the hMSH2-hMSH3 complex was bound to magnesium, magnesium/ADP, and magnesium/ATPγS (seearrowheads, Fig. 5A). Western analysis of an identical partial proteolysis experiment (probed with an hMSH2-specific antibody) was also performed (Fig. 5B). By comparing lanes where protein was free of adenosine nucleotide, bound by ADP, or bound by ATP, it was possible to identify several bands that were unique to hMSH2 which were differentially sensitive to proteolytic cleavage (Fig. 5B). This result suggests that the hMSH2-hMSH3 complex undergoes a conformational transition associated with adenosine nucleotide binding that is qualitatively similar to that observed with G proteins. Thus, binding and hydrolysis of ATP by hMSH2-hMSH3 appears to control conformational transitions associated with mispair recognition and perhaps MMR signaling. The most widely accepted model for mismatch repair suggests that MutS and its homologs bind to mismatched nucleotides, which is followed by the association of MutL or its homologs (5Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). This multiprotein complex is then proposed to perform bi-directional ATP-dependent translocation on the DNA to the site of incision prior to the excision/resynthesis repair reaction (40Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The results presented here for the hMSH2-hMSH3 heterodimer and in a previous publication for the hMSH2-hMSH6 heterodimer suggest a somewhat simpler model: MutS homologs function as simple adenosine nucleotide-regulated molecular switches (6Fishel R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2096-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 33Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In the molecular switch model, mispair recognition provokes adenosine nucleotide exchange much like ligand binding provokes guanosine nucleotide exchange in G protein-coupled receptor systems. As with G proteins, we have demonstrated that adenosine nucleotide binding and exchange by the MutS homologs triggers a conformational transition that is the likely signal for downstream events. Furthermore, ATP hydrolysis is proposed to recycle the system following signal transduction such that it may recognize another mismatch. Here we demonstrate that ADP → ATP exchange by hMSH2-hMSH3 is stimulated by IDLs, illustrating the versatility of the eukaryotic mismatch signaling process. Although bacterial MutS is limited to IDLs of no more than 4 nucleotides, the combination of hMSH2-hMSH3 and hMSH2-hMSH6 heterodimers extends the range of mismatch induced signaling from simple mismatched nucleotides to IDLs of up to 16 nucleotides. More importantly, we have demonstrated strong binding of hMSH2-hMSH3 to a 24-nucleotide loop; yet, this IDL induces little or no ATPase activity and does not effectively stimulate ADP → ATP exchange. This finding appears to explain the relative lack of repair of large IDLs (≥16 nucleotides) by the MMR system in vitroor in vivo (22Sia E.A. Kokoska R.J. Dominska M. Greenwell P. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2851-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 31Genschel J. Littman S.J. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19895-19901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Together, these results appear to suggest that mismatch binding by the MutS homologs is necessary but not sufficient for mismatch repair. The mechanism by which different mismatched or IDL nucleotides induces ADP → ATP exchange is unknown. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that MutS homolog function is tied to the ability of a mismatch, lesion, or DNA structure to provoke ADP → ATP exchange. By comparison, ligand binding by G protein-coupled receptors has been proposed to result in receptor conformational transitions that stimulate GDP → GTP exchange by G proteins. Similarly, our results suggest that the well known subtle and overt conformational alterations that distinguish mismatched DNA from homoduplex DNA is the signal(s) that provokes ADP → ATP exchange within the MutS homologs. Moreover, under physiologically relevant conditions, mispair binding is likely to be transient and merely the exchange factor that stimulates exchange of ADP → ATP, which is followed by rapid dissociation from the mismatch. Our work with the hMSH2-hMSH6 mispair recognition complex suggests that the conformational transition induced by ADP → ATP exchange results in the formation of an ATP hydrolysis-independent sliding clamp that remains stably bound to the DNA following dissociation from the mismatch (41Gradia S. Subramanian D. Wilson T. Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). By analogy, it is likely that hMSH2-hMSH3 retains the same function(s) in transducing the mismatch signal to the repair machinery (see Ref. 42Blackwell L.J. Bjornson K.P. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32049-32054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar for an alternate model). A role for MSH2-MSH3 in homologous recombination has also been proposed based on genetic data in S. cerevisiae (43Sugawara N. Paques F. Colaiacovo M. Haber J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9214-9219Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). It is possible that the ATP-independent binding of hMSH2-hMSH3 to large IDLs provides a target for the recombination-repair machinery and/or repair process that is mechanistically different from those provoked by the hMSH2-hMSH6 adenosine nucleotide molecular switch (33Gradia S.

https://openalex.org/W2155338983,"Mammalian DNA ligases are composed of a conserved catalytic domain flanked by unrelated sequences. At the C-terminal end of the catalytic domain, there is a 16-amino acid sequence, known as the conserved peptide, whose role in the ligation reaction is unknown. Here we show that conserved positively charged residues at the C-terminal end of this motif are required for enzyme-AMP formation. These residues probably interact with the triphosphate tail of ATP, positioning it for nucleophilic attack by the active site lysine. Amino acid residues within the sequence RFPR, which is invariant in the conserved peptide of mammalian DNA ligases, play critical roles in the subsequent nucleotidyl transfer reaction that produces the DNA-adenylate intermediate. DNA binding by the N-terminal zinc finger of DNA ligase III, which is homologous with the two zinc fingers of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, is not required for DNA ligase activityin vitro or in vivo. However, this zinc finger enables DNA ligase III to interact with and ligate nicked DNA at physiological salt concentrations. We suggest that in vivothe DNA ligase III zinc finger may displace poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase from DNA strand breaks, allowing repair to occur.

Three human genes encoding DNA ligases, LIG1,LIG3, and LIG4, have been isolated (1Tomkinson A.E. Levin D.S. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 2Tomkinson A.E. Mackey Z.B. Mutat. Res. 1998; 407: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The enzymes encoded by these genes and all other eukaryotic DNA ligases utilize ATP as a co-factor in the DNA joining reaction. In this regard, eukaryotic DNA ligases are similar to the DNA ligases encoded by the bacteriophages T4 and T7. The formation of a covalent enzyme-NMP reaction intermediate, in which the NMP moiety is linked to a lysine residue via a phosphoramidite bond, is a property shared by DNA ligases, RNA ligases, and mRNA capping enzymes (3Shuman S. Schwer B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In DNA ligases, the active site lysine was first identified in bovine DNA ligase I (4Tomkinson A.E. Totty N.F. Ginsburg M. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). By comparing the amino acid sequence of the adenylated peptide from bovine DNA ligase I with other DNA ligases, an active site motif, KXDGXR, that is diagnostic for DNA ligases was defined (4Tomkinson A.E. Totty N.F. Ginsburg M. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A second peptide sequence, known as the conserved peptide, was initially revealed by a comparison of vaccinia DNA ligase with the DNA ligases encoded by the CDC9 and CDC17 genes ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, respectively (5Smith G.L. Chan Y.S. Kerr S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9051-9062Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Subsequently, sequences exhibiting homology with the conserved peptide have been detected in all eukaryotic and pox virus DNA ligases (1Tomkinson A.E. Levin D.S. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 2Tomkinson A.E. Mackey Z.B. Mutat. Res. 1998; 407: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) except for the putative DNA ligase encoded by African swine fever virus (6Hammond J.M. Kerr S.M. Smith G.L. Dixon L.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2667-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). At the present time, the role of the conserved peptide in the DNA joining reaction is not known. Since the sequences and the number of amino acids between the active site and conserved peptide motif are similar in all eukaryotic DNA ligases, it appears that the conserved motifs define a minimal catalytic domain (1Tomkinson A.E. Levin D.S. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 2Tomkinson A.E. Mackey Z.B. Mutat. Res. 1998; 407: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 7Wei Y.-F.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3206-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The generation of catalytically active fragments of mammalian DNA ligase I containing the conserved motifs by limited proteolysis (8Tomkinson A.E. Lasko D.D. Daly G. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12611-12617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the complementation of the conditional lethal phenotype of a yeast cdc9 DNA ligase mutant by fragments of human DNA ligase I cDNA that encode the putative catalytic domain (9Barnes D.E. Johnston L.H. Kodama K. Tomkinson A.E. Lasko D.D. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6679-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) support this notion. Alignment of DNA ligases, mRNA capping enzymes, and RNA ligases led to the identification of another four conserved motifs in addition to the active site and conserved peptide (3Shuman S. Schwer B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of T7 DNA ligase, the active site lysine residue is at the bottom of a cleft between two domains (10Subramanya H.S. Doherty A.J. Ashford S.R. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1996; 85: 607-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). All of the other motifs, except for the conserved peptide, form the protein surfaces that surround the active site lysine residue (10Subramanya H.S. Doherty A.J. Ashford S.R. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1996; 85: 607-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that this structural organization occurs in all the enzymes that form a covalent enzyme-NMP reaction intermediate. Considerably less is known about how DNA ligase interacts with nicked DNA in the latter steps of the ligation reaction. Although the catalytic domain must contain amino acid residues that recognize and interact with nicks in duplex DNA, the molecular mechanisms by which the AMP moiety is transferred to the 5′-phosphate terminus at a nick in duplex DNA and by which the phosphodiester bond is then formed from the DNA-adenylate intermediate have not been defined. Interestingly, DNA ligase IIIα and DNA ligase IIIβ, which are generated by alternative splicing of the mammalian LIG3 gene transcript, have an amino-terminal sequence that is homologous with the zinc fingers of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1The abbreviations used are: PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; DTT, dithiothreitol; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ΔZf, zinc finger-deleted; bp, base pair(s)..1The abbreviations used are: PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; DTT, dithiothreitol; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ΔZf, zinc finger-deleted; bp, base pair(s).. that interact with DNA strand breaks (7Wei Y.-F.

Chem. 1990; 265: 21907-21913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This has led to the suggestion that the zinc finger of DNA ligase III may function as the nick sensor for this enzyme (13Caldecott K.W. Aoufouchi S. Johnson P. Shall S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4387-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that the DNA ligase III zinc finger does indeed bind specifically to DNA single-strand breaks, enabling this enzyme to catalyze the joining of nicks at salt concentrations that inhibit other eukaryotic DNA ligases. However, deletion of this DNA binding motif does not abolish either DNA joining activity or the ability of this enzyme to complement the conditional lethal phenotype of an Escherichia coli lig mutant, indicating that there are other residues that interact with the nicked DNA substrate during the ligation reaction. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified residues within the conserved peptide that play critical roles in the interaction of DNA ligase III and presumably other eukaryotic DNA ligases with nicked DNA during the latter stages of the DNA ligation reaction. Removal of a HindIII fragment (nucleotides −21 to 697) of PARP cDNA, which encodes the two zinc fingers of the human PARP (residues 1–234) from pTG PARP (11Gradwohl G. Ménissier-de Murcia J.

After removal of the 3′ overhangs, the same fragment was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pBC (16Chatton B. Bahr A. Acker J. Kedinger D. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 142-145PubMed Google Scholar) so that the DNA ligase III open reading frame was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Plasmids encoding oligohistidine (His)-tagged versions of DNA ligase IIIβ polypeptides were constructed as follows. For full-length DNA ligase IIIβ with an N-terminal His tag, the DNA ligase IIIβ open reading frame was amplified from the glutathioneS-transferase-DNA ligase IIIβ plasmid (17Mackey Z.B. Ramos W. Levin D.S. Walter C.A. McCarrey J.R. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 17: 989-998Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar) by the PCR using Pwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and SalI and subcloned into the same restriction sites of pQE32 (Qiagen) to generate pHis Lig IIIβ (Fig. 1). For His-tagged versions of DNA ligase IIIβ that lack the N-terminal zinc finger motif (ΔZf), a 2.4-kilobase pairApaI/SalI fragment of DNA ligase III cDNA encoding residues 49–862 was subcloned into pBluescript II KS. The 2.4-kilobase pair fragment was released from pBluescript II KS by digestion with KpnI and SalI and subcloned into pQE32 to generate the plasmid pHis ΔZfLig IIIβ (Fig. 1). Constructs encoding His-tagged ΔZf DNA ligase IIIβ fusion proteins with single amino acid changes in the conserved peptide were generated by replacing the 600-bp EcoRI/SalI fragment from the wild type DNA ligase III cDNA with mutated 600-bpEcoRI/SalI fragments (Fig. 1).

Husain I. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 5412-5422Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) as the template. Amplification was carried out in a 50-μl volume containing 200 ng of plasmid DNA, 50 μm dNTPs, 200 nm primers, 1× Pfu buffer (Stratagene), and 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase. An initial cycle of 94 °C for 2 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 45 s was performed, followed by 19 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 45 s. Primer N4.5–2 (5′-GAAATGAAGCGAGTCAC-3′) was paired with the degenerate backward primers to generate “left” mutated PCR fragment, and T3–1 (5′-GCTGGAGCTCCACCGCGGTGG-3′) was paired with degenerate forward primers to generate “right” mutated PCR fragment. After removing free primers and dNTPs, equimolar amounts of left and right PCR fragments were mixed, and amplification was performed using primers A (5′-GACCTGGTGGTCCTT-3′) and T3–1 in a 50-μl reaction containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 75 mm KCl, 5 nm EDTA, 50 μm dNTP, 15 ng of template, and 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase. The mixture was heated at 94 °C for 1 min and then cooled down to 54 °C at 0.1 °C/s. After incubation at 54 °C for 1 min, the primers (200 nm each) were added. Amplification was carried out by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by a 5-min incubation at 72 °C. The mutated DNA fragments (∼600 bp) were purified using a Qiagen kit as suggested by the manufacturer and then digested with EcoRI and XbaI. The EcoRI–XbaI fragment was isolated from an agarose gel and cloned into pBluescript SK. 6–12 clones from each mutagenesis experiment were sequenced using ABI dye terminator chemistry. Clones that contained the desired mutations were sequenced further to verify that no additional undesired mutations had been introduced and then subcloned into expression vectors as described above. Crude extracts of plasmid-containing TGE900 bacteria were prepared as described previously (11Gradwohl G. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Molinete M. Simonin F. Koken M. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. de Murcia G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2990-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from a 1.5-ml culture were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 μl of 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm glucose, 10 mm EDTA, and 100 μl of sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 6m urea, 6% 2-mercaptoethanol, 3% SDS, 0.003% bromphenol blue). After sonication, bacterial proteins were separated by electrophoresis through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar) and then either stained with Coomassie blue or transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (BAS 83; Schleicher & Schuell). Immunoblotting experiments with rabbit antibodies against the human PARP zinc finger FI (20Decker P. Briand J.P. de Murcia G. Pero R.W. Isenberg D.A. Muller S. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 918-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) or zinc finger FII (21Simonin F. Briand J.P. Muller S. de Murcia G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 195: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were carried out as described previously (22Mazen A. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Molinete M. Simonin F. Gradwohl G. Poirier G. de Murcia G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4689-4698Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For DNA binding and DNase I footprinting assays, the membranes were washed for 30 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 at room temperature and then preincubated for 10 min at 0 °C in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1% Nonidet P-40). After incubation for 1 h with 20 ng of a 32P-end-labeled 66-bp duplex DNA (either with or without a single nick) in the DNA binding buffer (23Ménissier-de Murcia J. Molinete M. Gradwohl G. Simonin F. de Murcia G. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), the membranes were washed three times with binding buffer at 0 °C and then either were dried and subjected to autoradiography to visualize the protein-DNA complexes or were autoradiographed wet for 1 h so that the filter-bound protein-DNA complex could be excised and used for DNase I footprinting assays as described previously (23Ménissier-de Murcia J. Molinete M. Gradwohl G. Simonin F. de Murcia G. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A recombinant baculovirus encoding DNA ligase IIIβ was constructed by using the pFastbac BEV system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Sf9 insect cells (250 ml) were grown to a density of 2.0 × 106 cells/ml and then infected with the recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 1. After rotation at 150 rpm for 64 h at 28 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The frozen pellet was thawed on ice and then resuspended in 200 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 75 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine-HCl, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. After 30 min on ice, the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 30 min in a Beckman 45 Ti rotor at 4 °C. Proteins in the cleared lysate were precipitated with 70% ammonium sulfate. After collection by centrifugation, the precipitate was resuspended in and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 75 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl. The dialysate was then fractionated by P11 phosphocellulose (Whatman) chromatography. Eluted fractions were assayed for protein by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar) and for DNA ligase by detecting formation of a labeled enzyme-adenylate intermediate (see below). Active fractions were pooled and fractionated by FPLC Resource S chromatography and then by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The peak fractions from the gel filtration column were then aliquoted, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The E. coli strain M15 was transformed with plasmids encoding His-tagged versions of DNA ligase IIIβ. Cultures (1 liter) were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. When the culture reached an A600 of 0.6, isopropyl thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and incubation was continued for 6 h. Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation and then resuspended in 50 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. After sonication, the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman 45Ti rotor. The cleared lysate was loaded onto a 35-ml P11 phosphocellulose column that had been pre-equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl). After washing with buffer A, bound proteins were eluted stepwise with buffer A containing 0.2m and then 0.5 m NaCl. Eluted fractions were assayed for protein by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar) and for DNA ligase by detecting formation of a labeled enzyme-adenylate intermediate (see below). Fractions containing DNA ligase IIIβ, which was present in the 0.5 m eluate, were pooled. After the addition of imidazole to a final concentration of 10 mm, the sample was incubated by constant rotation at 4 °C for 3 h with nickel beads (1 ml of beads per 10 mg of protein) that had been pre-equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl and 10 mm imidazole. The beads were collected by centrifugation and then washed five times with 50 ml of buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were batch-eluted from the beads with buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole and 50 mm EDTA. After dialysis against buffer A, the dialysate was aliquoted, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. A 38-bp duplex containing a single nick (25Tomkinson A.E. Tappe N.J. Friedberg E.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11762-11771Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was constructed by annealing oligonucleotides and used as the substrate for electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The 38-mer (8 pmol) was end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to a specific activity of 105 cpm/μg and then annealed with two complementary oligonucleotides (8 pmol of each) to generate a labeled 38-bp duplex with a single nick. Radiolabeled nicked duplexes (3.2 ng) and DNA ligase III (0.5 μg) were incubated on ice in 50 mm Tris-HCl, (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, and 60 μg/ml bovine serum albumin with 32 ng of linearized pBluescript and KCl concentrations ranging from 100 to 400 mm. Similar assays were carried out in the presence of 32, 96, and 320 ng of cold 38-bp duplex, either intact or with a single nick, at 100 mm KCl. After 30 min, samples were loaded onto nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels that had been prerun at 100 V for 30 min at 4 °C. After electrophoresis at 150 V for 4–6 h at 4 °C in 1× TBE, gels were dried, and labeled oligonucleotides were detected by autoradiography. The inclusion of the linear pBluescript molecules inhibited formation of large DNA-protein complexes, which failed to enter the gel, by nonspecific DNA binding. A 38-bp oligonucleotide containing a single nick was used as the substrate in DNA joining assays (25Tomkinson A.E. Tappe N.J. Friedberg E.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11762-11771Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The 5′ end of the 20-mer, which forms one of the nick termini, was end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to a specific activity of 106 cpm/μg. Reaction mixtures (60 μl), which contained 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, DNA substrate (60,000 cpm) and DNA ligase, were incubated at 16 °C for 30 min. After the addition of 10 μl of formamide dye solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), samples were heated at 85 °C for 3 min. Aliquots (3 μl) were separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis. After fixing and drying, the dried gel was exposed to x-ray film. DNA joining was detected by conversion of the labeled 20-mer to a labeled 38-mer and quantitated by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) analysis. The E. coli strain AK76 ligts7 was transformed with DNA ligase IIIβ plasmids. Overnight cultures of transformants, which were grown at 30 °C, were streaked onto LB agar plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 40 μg/ml isopropyl thiogalactoside. The plates were then incubated at either 30 or 40 °C for 24 h. Reaction mixtures contained 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, DNA ligase III, and 0.5 μCi of [α-32P] ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After incubation, reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer, heated at 90 °C for 5 min, and then electrophoresed through an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Labeled polypeptides were detected in the dried gel by either autoradiography or PhosphorImager analysis. Reaction mixtures containing 60 mm MES-NaOH (pH 6.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 μCi of [α-32P]ATP, and DNA ligase III protein were incubated at 20 °C for 15 min. At this time, 5 μg of the unlabeled 38-bp oligonucleotide containing a single nick was added, and the incubation was continued at 20 or 37 °C. Aliquots (10 μl) were removed at various times and added to 5 μl of formamide dye solution, heated to 80 °C for 2 min, and then electrophoresed through a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel. Labeled oligonucleotides in the dried gel were visualized by autoradiography. The N-terminal region of PARP contains two homologous sequences that correspond to two zinc fingers, finger I (residues 1–97) and finger II (residues 106–207), that are encoded by the first four exons of the PARP gene (26Auer B. Nagl U. Herzog H. Schneider R. Schweiger M. DNA. 1989; 8: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Analysis of the open reading frame encoded by human DNA ligase III cDNA revealed that this polypeptide has a putative zinc finger structure at its N terminus (7Wei Y.-F. Robins P. Carter K. Caldecott K. Pappin D.J.C., Yu, G.-L. Wang R.-P. Shell B.K. Nash R.A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Haseltine W.A. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3206-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) that exhibits homology with the PARP zinc fingers (Fig. 2A). A fragment of the DNA ligase III cDNA open reading frame encompassing the putative zinc finger of DNA ligase III (residues 1–360) was subcloned, and the polypeptide was overexpressed in E. coli. This polypeptide cross-reacted with an antibody that specifically recognizes finger I of PARP but did not cross-react with an antibody that specifically recognizes finger II of PARP (Fig. 2B). Thus, the putative zinc finger of DNA ligase III is antigenically related to PARP finger I. A characteristic feature of the PARP zinc fingers is their ability to bind to DNA breaks, in particular single strand breaks (11Gradwohl G. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Molinete M. Simonin F. Koken M.

Like PARP, the N-terminal fragment of DNA ligase III formed a specific complex with a labeled, nicked DNA probe in Southwestern blotting assays (Fig. 3A). Further analysis of these DNA-protein complexes by DNase I footprinting revealed that PARP and the N-terminal fragment of DNA ligase III bind to a similar region of the DNA probe that encompasses the nick at position 33 in probe 2 (Fig. 3B). To demonstrate that the DNase I protection is caused by the DNA ligase III zinc finger binding specifically to the nick, we have constructed DNA duplexes that either lack a nick (probe 1) or contain a single nick at position 22 (probe 3). In these experiments, DNA ligase IIIβ purified from E. coli (Fig. 4A) was immobilized on nitrocellulose and incubated with the DNA probes, and the resultant DNA-protein complexes were treated with DNase I. The pattern of the DNase I digestions from the DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 3D) was compared with the patterns generated by digestion of the DNA substrates alone (Fig. 3C). As expected, no region of protection was observed with the intact duplex, whereas a footprint that was dependent upon the position of the nick was detected in assays with the nicked DNA probes (Fig. 3D). These results demonstrate that the N-terminal zinc finger of DNA ligase III binds to DNA single strand breaks.Figure 4Size, immunoreactivity, and activity of purified DNA ligase IIIβ polypeptides.Untagged full-length DNA ligase IIIβ (Lig III-BV), His-tagged full-length DNA ligase IIIβ (Lig III-E), and His-tagged DNA ligase IIIβ lacking the zinc finger (Lig III-ΔZf) were purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, DNA ligase IIIβ polypeptides (2.0 μg of each) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then stained with Coomassie Blue.

https://openalex.org/W2085973013,"The 130-kDa myosin I (MI130), product of the myr-1 gene, is one member of the mammalian class I myosins, a group of small, calmodulin-binding mechanochemical molecules of the myosin superfamily that translocate actin filaments. Roles for MI130 are unknown. Our hypothesis is that, as with all myosins, MI130 is designed for a particular function and hence possesses specific biochemical attributes. To test this hypothesis we have characterized the enzymatic properties of MI130 using steady-state and stopped-flow kinetic analyses. Our results indicate that: (i) the Mg2+-ATPase activity is activated in proportion to actin concentration in the absence of Ca2+; (ii) the ATP-induced dissociation of actin-MI130 is much slower for MI130 than has been observed for other myosins (−Ca2+, second order rate constant of ATP binding, 1.7 × 104m−1s−1; maximal rate constant, 32 s−1); (iii) ADP binds to actin-MI130 with an affinity of ∼10 μm and competes with ATP-induced dissociation of actin-MI130; the rate constant of ADP release from actin-MI130 is 2 s−1; (iv) the rates of the ATP-induced dissociation of actin-MI and ADP release are 2–3 times greater in the presence of CaCl2, indicating a sensitivity of motor activity to Ca2+; and (v) the affinity of MI130 for actin (15 nm) is typical of that observed for other myosins. Together, these results indicate that although MI130 shares some characteristics with other myosins, it is well adapted for maintenance of cortical tension.

Together, these results indicate that although MI130 shares some characteristics with other myosins, it is well adapted for maintenance of cortical tension. The myosin superfamily has no fewer than 15 members that share sequence homology in the amino-terminal, so-called “motor,” domain, which contains the ATP- and actin-binding sites (1Mooseker M.S.

Although qualitatively myosins appear to share the same basic mechanism of coupling ATP hydrolysis to the movement of actin filaments, studies indicate that the ways in which they interact with actin and nucleotide are quantitatively different (4Marston S.B. Taylor E.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 139: 573-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 5Kurzawa S.E. Manstein D.J.

These differences allow for myosins to function in a variety of situations including muscle contraction, vesicle transport, cytokinesis, and mediation of cell surface changes that accompany cell locomotion. The class I myosins are small, single-headed, nonfilamentous ATPases (see Ref. 7Coluccio L.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C347-C359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In lower eukaryotes, class I myosins are involved in cell migration, vesicle transport, and polarity determination, which are processes required for normal cell growth and development (8Adams R.J.

Biochemical and molecular biological studies show that a myosin I family exists in higher cells (see Ref. 7Coluccio L.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C347-C359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); one member of this family is the 130-kDa myosin I from rat liver (13Coluccio L.M. Conaty C. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 24: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), referred to here simply as MI130. 1The abbreviations used are: MI130, 130-kDa myosin I; BBMI, brush border myosin I; S1, subfragment 1; mant, 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl); MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; A, actin; M, myosin; D, ADP. Partial peptide sequence analysis (14Coluccio L.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2279-2284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that the 130-kDa polypeptide is a product of the myr-1 gene cloned from rat brain (15Ruppert C. Kroschewski R. Bähler M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); MM1α is its orthologue from mouse (16Sherr E. Joyce M. Greene L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1405-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Purified MI130 has six associated calmodulins (14Coluccio L.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2279-2284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as predicted by the DNA sequence (15Ruppert C. Kroschewski R. Bähler M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). MI130 binds F-actin in an ATP-regulated manner (13Coluccio L.M. Conaty C. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 24: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and translocates actin filaments in vitro (17Williams R. Coluccio L.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1994; 27: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Inhibition of motility observed at high [Ca2+] is overcome upon the addition of exogenous calmodulin (17Williams R. Coluccio L.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1994; 27: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Roles for MI130 are unknown. In NRK cells, MYR-1 localizes to the plasma membrane and to cell structures involved in movement, such as lamellipodia and membrane ruffles (18Ruppert C. Godel J. Müller R.T. Kroschewski R. Reinhard J. Bähler M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3775-3786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analyses of subcellular fractions of rat liver suggest that the majority of membrane-associated MI130 is found with the plasma membrane and microsomal fractions, but it appears that most of the MI130 is associated with the cytoskeleton. 2M. F. Balish, E. F. Moeller III & L. M. Coluccio, submitted for publication. Divergence in sequence of the carboxyl termini among the mammalian class I myosins might indicate that they are designed to bind different loads and perhaps to perform different functions. Similarly, although homology in the motor domain among the 130-kDa polypeptide and two other mammalian isoforms, namely MM1β (20Reizes O. Barylko B. Li C. Südhof T.C. Albanesi J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6349-6353Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or the 110-kDa myosin I (13Coluccio L.M. Conaty C. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 24: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and MYR-4 (21Bähler M. Kroschewski R. Stöffler H.-E. Behrmann T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 375-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) or the 105-kDa myosin I (14Coluccio L.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2279-2284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is 70%, the amino acid differences in the motor domain might reflect distinct properties and hence disparate cellular roles for these myosins. As a result, detailed mechanistic analyses may assist in defining the cellular functions of these isoforms. This report on MI130 is the first detailed kinetic analysis of a mammalian myosin I and represents the first step in a long-range plan designed ultimately to compare and contrast the kinetic properties of mammalian class I myosins. The study is made possible by adapting established transient kinetic methods to use the small quantities of myosin I that are available from rat liver. Our analysis shows that MI130 interacts with nucleotide and actin in much the same way as other myosins that have been studied. However, it is much slower than any other myosin II, the two Acanthamoeba class I myosins, and avian brush border myosin I (BBMI). Our results suggest that in addition to being very slow kinetically, this myosin I may be designed for efficient tension maintenance. MI130 was isolated from rat liver by gel filtration, anion, and cation exchange chromatography as described previously (13Coluccio L.M. Conaty C. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 24: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Fractions containing purified MI130 were pooled and, in some cases, concentrated in a Centricon 10 microconcentrator (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). After protein determination by colorimetry (Bio-Rad protein assay) using serum albumin as a standard, sucrose was added to 3 mg/ml, and the samples were frozen in liquid N2 prior to storage at −80 °C. Rabbit skeletal myosin subfragment 1 (S1) was prepared by chymotryptic digestion as described by Weeds and Taylor (22Weeds A. Taylor R.S. Nature. 1975; 257: 54-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Actin was prepared according to Spudich and Watt (23Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, in some cases, labeled with pyrene at Cys-374 according to Criddle et al. (24Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Jeffries T. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) derivatives of ADP (mant-ADP) and ATP (mant-ATP) were prepared according to Hiratsuka (25Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 72: 496-508Crossref Scopus (396) Google Scholar). All kinetic experiments were performed at 19 °C in 20 mm MOPS, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at pH 7.0 with a Hi-Tech Scientific SF-61 single mixing stopped-flow system using a 100-watt Xe/Hg lamp and a monochromator for wavelength selection. Pyrene and mant-ADP fluorescences were excited at 365 nm, and emission was detected after passing through a Schott (Mainz, Germany) KV 389 nm cut-off. The stated concentrations of reactants are those present after mixing in the stopped-flow observation cell. Stopped-flow data were fitted to exponentials by a nonlinear least-squares curve fit using software provided by Hi-Tech Scientific. The release of Pi was measured for 2–3 μg of myosin I using a colorimetric assay described by Pollard (26Pollard T.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 333-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-ATPase activity of myosin I was measured in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm CaCl2, and KCl concentrations ranging from 30 to 500 mm. The K+-EDTA-ATPase activity was measured in 10 mmTris, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, and KCl ranging from 30 to 500 mm. The actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity was determined in 10 mmTris, pH 7.0, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, either 1 mm EGTA or 1 mm EGTA and 1.1 mm CaCl2, and F-actin from 0–30 μm. All reactions were done at 37 °C. Standard curves were generated with known amounts of phosphate. Controls included samples containing no myosin I. For actin-activated ATPase measurements, the reported values were corrected for activity because of the presence of actin. Data are expressed as s−1 assuming a molecular weight of 232,000 for the myosin I heavy chain and its six associated calmodulins. As shown in SchemeFS1, we interpret the kinetics of myosin I (M) interacting with nucleotide (T, ATP; D, ADP) in terms of the model described by Bagshaw et al. (27Bagshaw C.R. Eccleston J.E. Eckstein F. Goody R.S. Gutfrend H. Trentham D.R. Biochem. J. 1974; 141: 351-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), wherek+i and k−i are the forward and reverse rate constants, respectively, and Ki(k+i /k−i ) represents the equilibrium constant of the ith reaction. Normal characters are used to indicate reactions involving MI130, and bold characters refer to reactions involving actin-MI130. ATP binds rapidly to myosin in a two-step reaction before ATP is reversibly hydrolyzed on the protein. This results in a conformational change that limits phosphate release and the faster ADP release. The ATP-induced dissociation of actin-MI130 and the inhibition of the reaction by ADP have been interpreted in terms of the models developed by Millar and Geeves (28Millar N.C. Geeves M.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and Siemankowski and White (29Siemankowski R.F. White H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5045-5053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Scheme FS1B, ATP binds rapidly and reversibly to actin-MI130 and is followed by a rate-limiting isomerization (k+2 ) of the complex, which leads to rapid dissociation of actin. ADP competes with ATP for the nucleotide binding site. The dissociation constants of actin for MI130, actin for MI130.ADP, and ADP for actin-MI130 are KA ,KDA , and KAD , respectively. The Mg2+-ATPase activity of MI130 was very low and difficult to quantify with precision, but estimates suggest a kcat of < 0.01 s−1 in both the presence and absence of Ca2+. The Mg2+-ATPase activity was significantly activated by actin only in the absence of Ca2+. In 30 mm KCl the ATPase rate was approximately linearly related to the actin concentration over the range of 0–30 μm with a steady-state ATPase rate of 0.247 ± 0.003 s−1 at 30 μm actin. The ATPase activity was also determined in K+-EDTA and Ca2+, two nonphysiological conditions used historically to characterize conventional myosin II. At 30 mm KCl thekcat in EDTA of MI130 was 1.43 ± 0.021 s−1 and was inhibited at higher KCl concentrations. At 500 mm the activity was decreased to 25%. In contrast, the Ca2+-ATPase activity was 0.4 ± 0.02 s−1 and almost independent of KCl concentration up to 500 mm. The ATP-induced dissociation of MI130-actin complexes can be conveniently followed by monitoring the fluorescence of a pyrene label covalently attached to Cys-373 of actin. Fig. 1Ashows the resulting change in the fluorescence signal upon mixing 200 μm ATP with 25 nm MI130 and 25 nm phalloidin-stabilized pyrene-actin. At this concentration of ATP the change in the fluorescence can be described by a single exponential with kobs = 1.6 s−1 and an amplitude of +4%. At concentrations above 500 μm, the reaction is biphasic with both phases having similar amplitudes (Fig. 1B, 1 mm ATP). The low concentrations of MI130 used allowed the reaction to be followed over a wide range of ATP concentrations from 25 μm to 10 mm using only a few micrograms of protein. The dependence of the kobs for both phases of the reaction on ATP concentration is shown in Fig. 1C in both the presence and absence of calcium. The fast phase of both data sets shows a hyperbolic dependence on [ATP] with a maximal observed rate (k+2 ) of 74 and 32 s−1 and 3.2 and 1.9 mm ATP required for half maximal saturation (1/K1 ) with and without Ca2+, respectively. The values of1/K1 are of the order measured for all other myosins studied, but k+2 is much slower than any other myosin characterized so far (TableI). The slow phase saturates at akobs of 6 and 2 s−1 with and without Ca2+, respectively. The kobscorresponds to the rate constant of ADP dissociation from actin-MI130 in each case (see below) and led us to believe that the protein was purified with ADP bound in the nucleotide pocket. The amplitude of the slow phase varied among preparations and was normally in the range of 10–60% of the total amplitude. Extensive treatment with apyrase only partially reduced the amplitude of the slow phase, raising the possibility that the slow phase may have two components (see “Discussion”).Table ITransient kinetic analysis of rat 130-kDa myosin IRate/equilibrium constantRat MI130+CaRat MI130 −Ca32BBMI33Amoeboid Ia5.30Dicty MII6ChsmS16RbstS1Nucleotide binding to acto⋅MK1·k+2 (m−1s−1)0.023 × 1060.017 × 1060.32 × 1060.29 × 1060.14 × 1060.47 × 1062.1 × 1061/K1 (m)3.2 × 10−31.9 × 10−30.6 × 10−3>0.8 × 10−33.0 × 10−32.8 × 10−35.7 × 10−3k+2 (s−1)7432200>3004501,30012,000KAD (μm)≤10≤102.690945200kAD (s−1)628>100>20022>500Actin bindingKA (nm)13131060703.530(−ADP)(+ADP)KDA (nm)60–11060–110241000ATP bindingK1·k+2 (m−1s−1)0.1 × 1060.1 × 1060.95 × 1060.74 × 1060.94 × 1062.1 × 1062.3 × 106k+3+k−3 (s−1)≥162450130Mant ATPK1·k+2 (m−1s−1)0.1 × 1060.1 × 1060.45 × 1063.2 × 106Dicty, Dictyostelium; Ch, chicken; Rb, rabbit; acto·M, actomyosin.

Addition of 2.5 mm ATP to apyrase-treated 25 nm pyrene-labeled actin-MI130 results in a rapid change in fluorescence. The data for this preparation of protein fit a single exponential withkobs = 22.5 s−1. If, in place of apyrase, 25 μm ADP was added, thekobs was reduced to 5.8 s−1. Increasing either ADP or ATP concentration did not change thekobs (data not shown), suggesting that it is the ADP release rate (k−AD ) that is being monitored. At lower ADP concentrations, a biphasic reaction was observed with kobs of 22 and 6 s−1. Preliminary analysis of the amplitude dependence on ADP concentration suggests an affinity of <10 μm. Establishing the conditions under which the ADP concentration was less than 10 μm was difficult because of the presence of an unknown level of ADP contamination. Repeating the experiment in the absence of Ca2+ gave a slower rate of ADP release of 2 s−1 with a similar affinity of <10 μm. This affinity is much tighter than observed for skeletal muscle myosin II and amoeboid myosin Ia (29Siemankowski R.F. White H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5045-5053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Ritchie M.D. Geeves M.A. Woodward S.K.A. Manstein D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and BBMI (Table I). The observation that the total amplitude of the dissociation reaction was almost independent of ADP suggests that the affinity of actin for MI130.ADP is much less than 1 μm. The amplitude of the ATP-induced dissociation reaction can be used to estimate the affinity of pyrene-actin for a myosin as shown by Kurzawa and Geeves (31Kurzawa S.E. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, such a titration experiment requires a considerable amount of MI130, which is limiting because it is present in cells in only small amounts. We therefore used a competition experiment with the well characterized rabbit skeletal muscle myosin S1 to provide an estimate of the affinity of MI130 for actin. The addition of 50 μm ATP to 25 nm pyrene-actin and 50 nm MI130in the stopped-flow spectrofluorometer led to a dissociation reaction with a kobs of 0.74 s−1 (Fig. 3). The addition of 50 μmATP to 25 nm pyrene-actin and 50 nm S1 gave akobs of 80 s−1. Both reactions had a similar amplitude of 3.8%, suggesting a comparable affinity if both myosins quench the pyrene fluorescence to a similar extent. When 25 nm actin was mixed with 50 nm MI130and 200 nm S1 before mixing with ATP, a biphasic reaction was observed with 68% of the reaction occurring at 80 s−1(the kobs for A·S1 dissociation) and 32% at 0.79 s−1 (the kobs for A·MI130 dissociation). The amplitudes of the dissociation reaction were dependent upon the S1 concentration as shown in Fig. 3B. It is important to note that in Fig. 3B it is the concentration of the proteins in the syringe that is plotted, because the system is at equilibrium before the ATP is added. This usage is the opposite of the normal convention used for all of the other figures. When the fast and slow reactions have the same amplitude (i.e. the two myosins bind the same amount of actin in the mixture), thenKdS1/KdMI130= [S1]/[MI130] = ([S1]0 − 0.5[A]0)/([MI130]0 − 0.5[A]0). This equation was valid at 100 nmS1 in the absence of ADP and at approximately 300 nm S1 in the presence of 30 μm ADP. Under the experimental conditions, the affinity of S1 for actin is 30 nm in the absence of ADP (31Kurzawa S.E. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and 600 nm in the presence of ADP, leading to an affinity of pyrene-actin for MI130 of 13 nm (−ADP) and 60–110 nm (+ADP). The presence of Ca2+ had little influence on the measured affinities (data not shown). Mixing 2.5 μm mant-ATP with 250 nmMI130 led to a 3.3% increase in fluorescence when the reaction was monitored by exciting the intrinsic protein fluorescence at 295 nm and measuring the energy transfer to the mant group (Fig. 4A). The observed reaction occurred at 0.28 s−1, but it could only be followed over the concentration range of 1–2.5 μm mant-ATP. No reaction could be seen by monitoring the mant fluorescence directly. We could detect no reaction when monitoring mant-ADP binding over a similar concentration range. Addition of 5 μm ATP to 100 nm MI130 resulted in a 1.2% increase in intrinsic protein fluorescence at 0.56 s−1 (Fig. 4B). The reaction could be observed over the ATP concentration range of 1–15 μm (Fig. 4B, inset), and the data were consistent with a second order rate constant, K1 k+2, of 0.1 × 106m−1s−1. Thus, both ATP and mant-ATP bind with a similar rate constant and five times faster than the apparent rate of binding to actin-MI130. No calcium dependence of the reaction was detected (data not shown). The ATPase activity and transient kinetics data presented here show that MI130 interacts with both ATP and actin in a manner similar to that of other well characterized myosins, with the exception that many of the events are much slower. Although restricted in the quantity of available purified myosin I, the current studies were possible because of (i) the high sensitivity of pyrene-labeled actin to interactions between actin and myosin I complexes and (ii) the use of phalloidin to stabilize F-actin, thereby allowing many transient measurements using only microgram quantities of protein (31Kurzawa S.E. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A major observation resulting from these studies is that the ATP-induced dissociation of actin-MI130(K1k+2 = 0.023 × 106m−1 s−1) is slower than has been determined for other myosins. As compared with BBMI, the closest known relative to MI130 (15Ruppert C. Kroschewski R. Bähler M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the rate of ATP-induced dissociation of the actin-MI130 complex is 10% in the absence of Ca2+ (32Jontes J.D. Milligan R.A. Pollard T.D. Ostap M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14332-14337Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This is largely attributable to a smaller value of k+2 , as the1/K1 is comparable with that observed for BBMI. Across the range of myosins listed in Table I,k+2 for BBMI is similar to amoeboid myosin Ia (33Ostap E.M. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1053-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and Dictyostelium myosin II (5Kurzawa S.E. Manstein D.J. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and much slower than the muscle myosins (30Ritchie M.D. Geeves M.A. Woodward S.K.A. Manstein D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8619-8623Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, MI130 is by far the slowest myosin so far characterized. Similarly, the rate of ATP binding to MI130 in the absence of actin is 10% that of BBMI, which in this regard more closely resembles all of the other myosins listed in Table I. In contrast, both the dissociation rate constant for ADP from A·M·D (k−AD ) and the affinity of ADP for A·M (KAD ) are comparable for MI130 and BBMI, suggesting that these differences are an intrinsic property of the protein and not caused by the method of preparation. What is responsible for the slow phase observed in the ATP dissociation of actin-MI130 is unknown. Although the rate is similar to that of ADP dissociation, it could not be eliminated with extensive treatment with apyrase. Indeed, actin-MI130 treated with 40 μm ADP to eliminate the fast phase, then treated with apyrase, resulted in restoration of the original fast phase, showing that the ADP had been removed; however, the slow phase remained. This slow component may represent a contaminating myosin in the preparation, damaged MI130, MI130 without a full complement of calmodulin, or an alternately spliced version of MI130. The examination of the kinetic properties of MI130expressed in baculovirus will soon allow us to rule out some of these possibilities. The affinity of MI130 for actin is similar to that observed for all myosins examined so far. Interestingly, the affinity of MI130 for actin is reduced 5–7-fold in the presence of ADP. This behavior is similar to that displayed by smooth muscle myosin S1 (6Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and differs markedly from skeletal muscle (30Ritchie M.D. Geeves M.A. Woodward S.K.A. Manstein D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8619-8623Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and cardiac muscle myosins (29Siemankowski R.F. White H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5045-5053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, coupling between the ADP and actin binding sites resembles that found with smooth muscle myosin II and Dictyostelium cytoplasmic myosin II (<10-fold (5Kurzawa S.E. Manstein D.J. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar)) and differs from that of skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle myosin II (>20-fold). It has been proposed that this low level of coupling between actin and ADP binding is a property of myosins designed for more efficient bearing of tension rather than fast contraction (6Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and so it may not be surprising that members of the myosin I family should have more in common with smooth muscle and cytoplasmic myosin IIs than with fast skeletal muscle myosin II (see Fig. 5 and below). The ATPase results described here are consistent with those from an earlier look at the ATPase activity of MI130 (13Coluccio L.M. Conaty C. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 24: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Also, although performed under slightly different buffer conditions, the rate of ATP hydrolysis of MI130 resembles qualitatively and quantitatively that previously observed for BBMI. Conzelman and Mooseker (34Conzelman K.A. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) reported rates of 0.644 s−1 in K+-EDTA (575 mm KCl), 1.07 s−1 in Ca2+, and 0.1 s−1 in Mg2+, with a 2.5–3.5-fold activation in Mg2+ in the presence of actin (Ca2+- and Mg2+-ATPases in 75 mmKCl), similar to those reported by Krizek et al. (35Krizek J. Coluccio L.M. Bretscher A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 225: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (1.3 s−1 in K+-EDTA, 0.96 s−1 in Ca2+, and 0.04 s−1 in Mg2+ and a 2-fold activation of the Mg2+-ATPase in the presence of actin; all in 50 mm KCl). On the other hand, ATP hydrolysis by the amoeboid myosin I family is significantly faster than MI130 and more closely resembles that of skeletal muscle myosin II (33Ostap E.M. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1053-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This resemblance is not surprising because there is significant diversion in sequence between the mammalian and amoeboid class I myosins. One particularly noteworthy point is that the presence of Ca2+ eliminates the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of MI130. The motor activities of BBMI and MI130 have been shown to be inhibited by increasing Ca2+, which causes dissociation of calmodulin (17Williams R. Coluccio L.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1994; 27: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 36Collins K. Sellers J.R. Matsudaira P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), although there is evidence that it is the binding of Ca2+ to calmodulin that inhibits motility of a related mammalian myosin I, MM1β (37Zhu T. Beckingham K. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20481-20486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In contrast to the inhibitory effect on both the actin activation of the steady state Mg2+-ATPase activity and motility, the transient kinetic parameters measured show no major sensitivity to Ca2+ (2–3-fold maximum) and, in fact, bothK1k+2 and k−AD are slightly accelerated by Ca2+. MI130 appears similar to smooth muscle myosin II (Ref. 38Adelstein R.S. Eisenberg E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 921-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar; regulated by phosphophorylation) or the scallop muscle myosins (Ref. 39Szent-Györgyi A.G. Chantler P.D. Engel A.G. Franzini-Armstrong C. Myology. McGraw-Hill, New York1994: 506-528Google Scholar; regulated by Ca2+ binding to the light chains) in that the rate of Pi release from M·D·Pi or A·M·D·Pi is primarily affected, although effects on ADP release are also reported. Other events such as ATP binding, actin binding, or ATP hydrolysis on the protein are relatively little affected. Another feature that MI130 shares with smooth muscle myosin II and BBMI is that the molecules produce movement in two steps, as revealed by an optical tweezers transducer (40Veigel C. Coluccio L.M. Jontes J.D. Milligan R.A. Molloy J.E. Nature. 1999; 398: 530-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 41Veigel C.J. Kendricks-Jones J.R. Sellers J.C. Sparrow Molloy J.E. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: A145Google Scholar). The second step is significantly greater for MI130 and BBMI (5.5 nm) than for smooth muscle myosin II (2–3 nm). It has been proposed that the first step in the power stroke is associated with Pi release, whereas the second step represents ADP release. As expected, the time between the mechanical steps (300 ms, MI130; 120 ms, BBMI) is in good agreement with 1/k−AD (500 ms MI130, 125 ms, BBMI) given the differences in experimental conditions. The ADP release step corresponds to the ADP-dependent structural changes observed in three-dimensional reconstructions of smooth muscle actomyosin II (42Whittaker M. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Smith J.E. Faust L. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1995; 378: 748-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) and actin-BBMI (43Jontes J.D. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Milligan R.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 751-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 44Jontes J.D. Milligan R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) generated by cryoelectron microscopy and helical image analysis and by spectroscopy for smooth muscle myosin S1 (45Gollub J. Cremo C.R. Cooke R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 737-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 46Poole K.I.V. Lorenz M. Ellison P. Evans G. Rosenbaum G. Boesecke P. Holmes K.C. Cremo C.R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1997; 18 (abstr.): 264Google Scholar). This argument predicts that a similar or greater structural change should be observed for MI130; studies to address this issue are in progress. Cremo and Geeves (6Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) proposed that the high affinity of ADP for A·M, the structural change accompanying ADP release, and the weak coupling between actin and ADP affinities for smooth muscle myosin S1 could be indicative of a strain-sensing ADP release mechanism rather than the source of an additional power stroke in vivo (Fig. 5). These features of smooth muscle myosin II are common to MI130. Because the free energy of ADP release from actin-MI130 is small (K AD< 10 μm) and may even be positive at cellular ADP concentrations, a large input of energy would be required to remove ADP from a myosin head bearing positive strain if the cross-bridge displacement is to be large (Fig. 5). The amount of energy required to dissociate ADP can be estimated assuming the elastic energy of the MI130 cross-bridges is similar to that of skeletal muscle myosin II (0.5 milli-Newton m−1). The energy (E) in the elastic element is related to the stiffness (k′) and the imposed stretch (x) by E =k′x 2/2. If the cross-bridge is already stretched by 5 nm (the size of the cross-bridge throw corresponding to the crossover of the A-M·D·Pi and A·M·D parabolas), then an extra 3- or 5-nm stretch is required to release ADP for the smooth and MI130 cross-bridges, respectively. The ratio of the extra spring energy,k′Δ(x 2)/2, to the thermal energy,RT, then defines the extent of the strain-induced change inKAD . K′AD =KAD exp(−k′Δ(x 2)/2RT), where KAD is the equilibrium constant in the absence of strain, R is Boltzman's constant, and T is absolute temperature (47Smith D.A. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 524-537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This equation predicts that ADP would bind approximately 10-fold more tightly for an isometric smooth muscle cross-bridge bearing maximum tension and 100-fold more tightly for MI130. If this change in equilibrium constant can be assigned to a strain-dependent inhibition of the rate of ADP release (the simplest assumption), thenk−AD is slowed from 20 to 2 s−1for an isometric smooth muscle cross-bridge and from 2 to 0.02 s−1 for MI130, giving an average lifetime for the isometric cross-bridge of 0.5 and 50 s, respectively. If such a mechanism is contributing to the slow turnover of the myosin, then a Ca2+-induced change in conformation of calmodulin, leading to a reduction in the stiffness of the calmodulin binding domain or lever arm, could provide a simple way to reduce the strain in the cross-bridge without sliding. This strain reduction would lead to faster release of ADP and cross-bridge detachment by ATP. The large displacement of the head and the tight affinity of ADP for actin-MI130 may indicate that MI130 is designed primarily to bear a load rather than to shorten. ADP would effectively remain trapped on MI130 cross-bridges bearing a significant load. This role would be also consistent with the slow kinetics of MI130. The hypothesis outlined here and in Fig. 5, namely that the slow release of ADP from myosin is a strain-sensing mechanism, is entirely consistent with the data and represents a testable hypothesis. The prediction is that the time between the two steps of the mechanical event observed with the laser trap for the interaction of MI130 with actin (40Veigel C. Coluccio L.M. Jontes J.D. Milligan R.A. Molloy J.E. Nature. 1999; 398: 530-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) will increase with the stiffness of the trap. Previous studies show that MI130 is present at the plasma membrane and in association with cell protrusions such as lamellipodia and cell ruffles (15Ruppert C. Kroschewski R. Bähler M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In rat liver, 30% of the MI130 is membrane-bound with 70% presumably in association with the cytoskeleton.2 Additionally, in vitro studies have shown that MI130 cross-links actin filaments (13Coluccio L.M. Conaty C. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 24: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Given the kinetic and structural properties of this isoform, it is plausible to believe that MI130 is involved in the maintenance of tension within the cytoplasm. Other evidence for a similar role of a myosin I comes from studies inDictyostelium in which over-expression of MyoB results in a decrease in the fluidity of pseudopodia (12Novak K.D. Titus M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 633-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The hospitality extended to L. M. C. by Max-Planck-Institut-Dortmund is greatly appreciated. We are grateful to Dr. Justin Molloy, University of York, for helpful discussion."

There is increasing evidence that nuclear material, including histones, DNA, and nucleosomes, may under certain conditions become located on the surface of cells (1Hefeneider S.H. Cornell K.A.

Autoimmunity. 1993; 15: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The presence of histones on the cell surface of various cell types has been documented in a number of previous publications. For instance, Rekvig et al. (9Rekvig O.P. Muller S. Briand J.P. Skogen B. Van Regenmortel M.H. Immunol. Invest. 1987; 16: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) reported that a subset of anti-nuclear antibodies with affinity for mononucleosomes bound to histone H2B present in the plasma membrane of viable leukocytes. Also, when investigating the resistance of cytotoxic T-cells to perforin-mediated hemolysis, Ojcius et al. (10Ojcius D.M. Muller S. Hasselkus Light C.S. Young J.D. Jiang S. Immunol. Lett. 1991; 28: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) fractionated plasma membrane proteins from cytotoxic T-cells using high pressure liquid chromatography and showed that histones H2A and H2B were present, an observation that was further supported by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Histone H2B has also shown to be present on the cell surface of B-cells by Mecheri et al. (11Mecheri S. Dannecker G. Dennig D. Poncet P. Hoffmann M.K. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), who used a monoclonal antibody produced by immunizing mice with purified B-cells to immunoprecipitate a polypeptide from the surface of a B-cell line that had 100% homology with histone H2B. Interestingly, this antibody was also able to interact with B-cells from human peripheral blood. Bilozur and Biswas (12Bilozur M.E. Biswas C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19697-19703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that [3H]heparin bound to four proteins present in the plasma membrane of the human lung carcinoma cell line LX-1, and when sequenced two were found to be histones H2A and H2B. In our own work, we have found that dextrin 2-sulfate (D2S), a synthetically sulfated polysaccharide, binds in a specific, saturable manner to the surface of activated T-cells. This compound also inhibits the infection of T-cells by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1in vitro (13Shaunak S. Gooderham N.J. Edwards R.J. Payvandi N. Javan C.M. Baggett N. MacDermot J. Weber J.N. Davies D.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 113: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), although its mechanism of action has not been elucidated. Nevertheless, we have demonstrated that D2S binds to histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, all of which are located on the plasma membrane of activated T-cells (14Watson K. Edwards R.J. Shaunak S. Parmelee D.C. Sarraf C. Gooderham N.J. Davies D.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). By incubation of activated T-cells with a relatively high concentration of D2S, these histones can be displaced from the cell surface (14Watson K. Edwards R.J. Shaunak S. Parmelee D.C. Sarraf C. Gooderham N.J. Davies D.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Here, D2S-eluted cell surface histones were purified and characterized with respect to their composition and interactions with D2S, other sulfated polysaccharides, and the cell surface. From the results of the study we are able to demonstrate that cell surface histones are in the form of nucleosomes, and we propose a mechanism by which nucleosomes and sulfated polysaccharides, such as heparan sulfate, heparin, and D2S, interact at the cell surface. HPB-ALL cells (15Morikawa S. Tatsumi E. Baba M. Harada T. Yasuhira K. Int. J. Cancer. 1978; 21: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 20 mm HEPES buffer that was supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, 250 IU/ml penicillin, and 250 μg/ml streptomycin. HPB-ALL cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) using repetitive centrifugation and then resuspended in 5–20 ml (as appropriate) of ice-cold PBS containing 0.2 mg/ml D2S (ML Laboratories, Wavertree, UK) for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were pelleted, and the supernatant was passed through a 0.2-μm filter to remove any residual cells. Analytical anion-exchange chromatography was performed with a MonoQ column using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a continuous gradient of 0–3 m NaCl in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, over 40 min, and the absorbance was monitored at 280 nm. Preparative anion-exchange chromatography was performed using a 5.5 × 1 cm (inner diameter) Q fast flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min and a step gradient of 0.15, 0.5, 0.9, and 2.5 m NaCl in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4. Eluted fractions were either dialyzed against PBS overnight in preparation for SDS-PAGE or dialyzed overnight against 0.1m sodium borate, pH 8.4, in preparation for DNA extraction. Purified cell surface material or purified calf thymus histones were separated using 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels as described previously by Watson et al. (14Watson K. Edwards R.J. Shaunak S. Parmelee D.C. Sarraf C. Gooderham N.J. Davies D.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The amount of DNA present in the purified D2S-eluted material was determined fluorimetrically using the fluorophore Hoescht H33258 and compared with purified calf thymus standards. Samples of the material (0.1 ml) and calf thymus DNA standards (0.1 ml of 0–50 μg/ml) diluted in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 m NaCl, pH 7.4) were mixed with 2.9 ml of 0.1 μg/ml H33258 in TNE buffer, and the fluorescence was measured using excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 450 nm, respectively. Samples were treated with 50 μg/ml proteinase K for 1 h at 37 °C, and DNA was extracted by addition of 1.5 volumes of 50% (w/v) phenol, 48% (v/v) chloroform, and 2% (v/v) isoamyl alcohol solution. The solution was allowed to gently rotate for 5 min; the layers were separated by centrifugation (900 × g for 10 min), and the aqueous layer was removed. DNA in the aqueous fraction was precipitated by addition of 0.2 volumes of 3 m potassium acetate, pH 9.95, and 2.5 volumes of ice-cold 95% (v/v) ethanol. The precipitate was collected after centrifugation at 900 × g for 10 min and then dissolved in 100 μl of 45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 20 μl of 0.05 mg/ml xylene cyanol containing 8% (w/v) sucrose. Samples were electrophoresed on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel in 45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide at 100 V for 1 h. DNA present in the gel was visualized under long wavelength (366 nm) UV light. Mononucleosomes were prepared from HPB-ALL cell nuclei using micrococcal nuclease digestion as described by Kornberg et al. (16Kornberg R.D. LaPointe J.W. Lorch Y. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with purified D2S-eluted cell surface material as described by Edwards et al. (17Edwards R.J. Singleton A.M. Sesardic D. Boobis A.R. Davies D.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 3735-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) except that 40 μg of purified protein was administered on each occasion. This was performed according to Edwards et al. (17Edwards R.J. Singleton A.M. Sesardic D. Boobis A.R. Davies D.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 3735-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) using wells of microtiter plates coated with either 2 μg/ml purified cell surface material, nucleosomes from micrococcal nuclease digestion, or purified calf thymus histones. All antigens were diluted in PBS. HPB-ALL cells were washed three times in PBS by repetitive centrifugation. The cells were counted on a hemocytometer, and approximately 1 × 106 cells were fixed for 10 min in 4% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS. The cells were then applied to a poly-l-lysine-coated microscope slide using a Shandon Cytospin 3 set at 400 rpm for 3 min. The preparation was washed briefly in PBS before endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubation for 30 min in 70% (v/v) methanol containing 0.03% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by the addition of 100 μl of a 1/20 dilution of normal goat serum in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. The slides were air-dried and incubated with 100 μl of a 1/2000 dilution of antiserum for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were washed three times in PBS and then incubated with 100 μl of a 1/100 dilution of goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase in 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After three washes in PBS, the slides were incubated with 100 μl of a 1/300 dilution of peroxidase anti-peroxidase antibody in 0.1% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the slides were washed three times in PBS, and peroxidase activity was developed by incubation at room temperature with 100 μl of 0.025% (w/v) diaminobenzidine in 0.033% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 5 min or until a clear dark brown stain was noted. The cells were then dehydrated in graduated alcohol (70–100%) and xylene and fixed under coverslips. The incorporation of biotin hydrazide (Pierce, Warrington, UK) into D2S was undertaken using the conditions described in Watson et al. (18Watson K. Gooderham N.J. Davies D.S. Edwards R.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For the production of radiolabeled D2S, 5 μmol of ethanolamine containing 20 nmol of [1-3H]ethan-1-ol-2-amine (specific activity 29 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was substituted for biotin hydrazide. The specific activity of the radiolabeled D2S product was 1.14 × 106 dpm/mg D2S. The binding of D2S to either purified protein, nucleosome, or membrane preparations was determined as described in Watson et al. (18Watson K. Gooderham N.J. Davies D.S. Edwards R.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). From the curves produced, an EC50 value (effective concentration that produced 50% of the maximum binding of biotinylated D2S) was calculated. The interaction of 8 kDa dextran sulfate, 500 kDa dextran sulfate, fucoidan, heparan sulfate, glucose 6-sulfate (Sigma, Poole, UK), dextrin dextrin 2,3,6-sulfate (ML Laboratories, Wavertree, UK), and heparin (Leo Laboratories, High Wycombe, UK) with nucleosomes was determined by competition binding. This was achieved by mixing 0.2 μg/ml biotinylated D2S with 0–30 μg/ml competitor before addition to coated microtiter wells. Binding of biotinylated D2S was measured as described above. From the data produced, an IC50 value (inhibitory concentration resulting in a 50% decrease in biotinylated D2S binding) for each compound studied was determined. Nucleosomes (10 μg/ml) prepared from the cell surface were dialyzed against PBS to remove the residual salt and then warmed to 37 °C. Trypsin digestion was undertaken for 30 min at 37 °C with 50 μg/ml porcine pancreas trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4) (Sigma, Poole, UK). The trypsinized nucleosomes were separated from other components by gel filtration using a Sephadex G-25 column (2 cm inner diameter × 20 cm) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min equilibrated in 0.2 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Between 5 and 10 × 107 HPB-ALL cells were suspended in 10 ml of PBS and washed three times with PBS by repetitive resuspension and centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min. A cell membrane fraction was then prepared by the method described by Blair and MacDermot (19Blair I.A. MacDermot J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1981; 72: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) except that the homogenization buffers also contained 0.2 mg/ml D2S to remove cell surface nucleosomes. Typically this yielded between 1 and 3 mg of protein, as determined by the method of Lowry et al. (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments cells were treated with 1 unit/ml heparitinase I or 5 units/ml heparinase I (Sigma, Poole, UK) for 1 h at 37 °C prior to homogenization. Preliminary analysis using analytical anion-exchange chromatography with a continuous salt gradient showed that material eluted from the surface of HPB-ALL cells by incubation with 0.2 mg/ml D2S contained only one major UV-absorbing peak that was eluted in 0.9m NaCl (Fig. 1a). This material was purified using a preparative anion-exchange column, employing a step gradient of 0.15, 0.5, 0.9, and 2.5 mNaCl. The major UV-absorbing peak was eluted with 0.9 mNaCl (Fig. 2a). D2S was eluted with 2.5 m NaCl (Fig. 2a). Analysis of the 0.9m NaCl fraction by SDS-PAGE revealed the presence of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 in the preparation (Fig. 2b). The DNA content of the 0.9 m NaCl fraction was measured using Hoescht stain H33258 and was shown to be 0.56 mg of DNA/mg of protein, and following extraction and analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis, it was found that the DNA was fragmented into a regular pattern of 180-base pair units typical of mono-, di-, tri-, and polynucleosomes (Fig. 2c). Analysis of a mononucleosome preparation by analytical anion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 1b) showed an identical elution to the major UV-absorbing peak in the D2S-eluted cell surface material (Fig. 1a), whereas all of the individual histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 were eluted with a very short retention time (Fig. 1c). An antibody raised against purified D2S-eluted cell surface material bound equally to a mononucleosome preparation as it did to the purified D2S-eluted cell surface material (Fig. 3). The antibody also bound to histones H2A and H2B, albeit less strongly than to mononucleosomes and more weakly to histones H3 and H4 (Fig. 3). All together these results strongly suggest that the purified D2S-eluted cell surface material is comprised of nucleosome particles.Figure 2Purification of D2S-eluted cell surface material. Material on the surface of 5 × 108HPB-ALL cells was eluted by incubating with 20 ml of 0.2 mg/ml D2S containing [1-3H]ethan-1-ol-2-amine-labeled D2S added to a final specific activity of 3,000 dpm/mg D2S as described under “Experimental Procedures.” a, the supernatant was applied to a Q fast flow anion-exchange column (5.5 × 1 cm inner diameter) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min, and bound material was eluted using a step gradient of NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The eluate was continuously monitored at 280 nm, and the radioactivity of each fraction was determined by scintillation counting. b,analysis of the 0.9 m NaCl fraction by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained for protein using Coomassie Blue. The identification of the bands was by comparison with the migration of purified calf thymus histones. c, analysis of the 0.9 m NaCl fraction by agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA was extracted using phenol/chloroform, separated by electrophoresis on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel in Tris/boric acid/EDTA buffer and stained with ethidium bromide as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lane Scontains approximately 0.5 μg of a 100-base pair marker. Lanes 1–3 contain approximately 0.5, 1, and 1.5 μg of the extracted DNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Relative binding of antibody. The wells of microtiter plates were coated with purified cell surface material (♦), mononucleosomes (⋄), purified calf thymus histones H2A (■), H2B (●), H3 (▪), H4 (▴), or BSA (○), and antibody binding was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each value is the mean of duplicate determinations, and the data shown are representative of two experiments with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The antibody was used to determine the location of nucleosomes on HPB-ALL cells that had been cultured for 5 days. Immunocytochemistry showed that the antibody bound strongly to the plasma membrane of most of these cells (Fig. 4). However, cells that had been incubated with preimmune serum had no detectable staining (Fig. 4). A biotinylated derivative of D2S was synthesized and used to measure the binding of D2S to cell surface nucleosomes and purified histones. D2S bound strongest to purified cell surface nucleosomes (EC50= 0.12 μg/ml, n = 5), although binding to histones H2B and H2A was only slightly lower (Fig. 5). D2S also bound to histones H3 and H4, although both the maximum binding and the binding affinities were reduced (Fig. 5). However, D2S was unable to bind to trypsin-treated purified cell surface nucleosomes (Fig. 5). In competition studies, various sulfated polysaccharides were also able to bind to purified nucleosomes, although dextrin and glucose 6-sulfate did not (TableI).Table IComparison of IC50 values of sulfated polysaccharides determined from competition with biotinylated D2S for binding to nucleosomesCompoundMassSulfate contentIC50 ± S.E.kDamol/mol sugar unitμg/mlnmGlucose 6-sulfate0.271.0No competitionDextrin60No competitionHeparan sulfate7.51.20.95 ± 0.04127 ± 5Dextran sulfate82.30.78 ± 0.1298 ± 20D2S91.04.70 ± 0.32520 ± 40Dextran 2,3,6-sulfate153.00.32 ± 0.0423 ± 2Heparin151.20.82 ± 0.1655 ± 10Fucoidan1002.20.58 ± 0.046 ± 0.4Dextran sulfate5002.30.51 ± 0.021 ± 0.04Nucleosomes were coated onto microtiter plate wells and incubated with various concentrations of each sulfated polysaccharide containing 0.2 μg/ml biotinylated D2S.

Open table in a new tab Nucleosomes were coated onto microtiter plate wells and incubated with various concentrations of each sulfated polysaccharide containing 0.2 μg/ml biotinylated D2S. Competition for binding to nucleosomes was determined, and IC50 values were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each value is the mean ± S.E. determined from three separate experiments. D2S bound only very poorly to an HPB-ALL cell membrane preparation from which cell surface nucleosomes had been removed. However, after addition of purified cell surface nucleosomes to the membrane preparation, D2S bound extensively. In contrast, when the membrane preparation was treated with either heparitinase I or heparinase I, D2S binding was poor, even after the addition of purified cell surface nucleosomes (Fig. 6a). Similarly, the anti-nucleosome antibody bound poorly to the nucleosome-depleted membrane preparation, although when purified cell surface nucleosomes were added to the membrane preparation extensive antibody binding was found. However, after treatment of the membrane preparation with either heparitinase I or heparinase I, little antibody binding was detected even when purified cell surface nucleosomes were added to the membrane preparation (Fig. 6b). The results from this study show that histones, previously identified to be present on the surface of activated T-cells (14Watson K. Edwards R.J. Shaunak S. Parmelee D.C. Sarraf C. Gooderham N.J. Davies D.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), are in the form of nucleosomes, comprising histones H2A, H2B, H3, H4, and DNA fragmented into 180-base pair units. It is also shown that cell surface nucleosomes are attached to the plasma membrane through an interaction with cell surface proteoglycans. In a previous study it was found that histones could be eluted from the cell surface by incubation of cells with the sulfated polysaccharide, D2S (14Watson K. Edwards R.J. Shaunak S. Parmelee D.C. Sarraf C. Gooderham N.J. Davies D.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Here, purification of material eluted from the surface of activated T-cells by anion-exchange chromatography performed at pH 7.4 revealed that it comprised a single major UV-absorbing peak that was eluted with 0.9 m NaCl. The relatively high salt concentration needed to elute the material indicated that it carried a predominantly negative charge at pH 7.4; however, analysis of the composition of the proteins in this material by SDS-PAGE revealed that it comprised histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, which are all basic proteins. The negative charge of the material was not due to D2S, as this was clearly separated during anion-exchange chromatography. However, reactivity of the purified preparation with the fluorophore Hoeschst H33258 indicated that the material contained a substantial quantity of DNA, and analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that the DNA was fragmented into regular 180-base pair units. These results strongly suggested that the material eluted from the cell surface was a mixture of mono-, di-, tri-, and polynucleosomes. This assertion was supported by analytical anion-exchange chromatography of mononucleosomes, which produced an identical elution profile to the cell surface-derived material, in contrast to the elution of each of the individual histones, which did not bind to the anion-exchange chromatography column. Furthermore, an antibody raised against the cell surface-eluted material bound as strongly to mononucleosomes as it did to the cell surface material. Thus, the cell surface-eluted material is indistinguishable from nucleosomes. The surface location of nucleosomes in activated cells was confirmed by immunocytochemistry, as the antibody bound strongly to the cell surface of 5-day-old HPB-ALL cells. The pattern of fragmentation of DNA obtained from the purified nucleosome sample was similar to that observed in the nuclei of cells undergoing apoptosis. Apoptosis is a mode of cell death that is defined morphologically; chromatin undergoes condensation, the cytoplasmic organelles become compacted together, and the cell surface undergoes blebbing (21Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12927) Google Scholar, 22Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6728) Google Scholar). Furthermore, apoptotic cell death is accompanied by the activation of a nuclear endonuclease that cleaves chromatin at internucleosomal sites (23Duke R.C. Chervenak R. Cohen J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6361-6365Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) and the release of intact mono-, di- and polynucleosomes (24Searle J. Kerr J.F. Bishop C.J. Pathol. Annu. 1982; 17: 229-259PubMed Google Scholar). Since the vast majority of cells were morphologically normal, it appears that the appearance of nucleosomes on the cell surface of activated T-cells is the result of a small proportion of apoptotic cells releasing their contents into the extracellular space and the consequent binding of this nuclear material on the surface of viable cells. It was demonstrated, using a solid-phase binding assay, that D2S bound strongly to nucleosomes, and although binding to purified histones H2A and H2B was only slightly lower, binding to histones H3 and H4 was relatively poor. However, whereas the binding of D2S (and other sulfated polysaccharides) to histones is readily explained by an ionic interaction between oppositely charged molecules, the interaction between D2S and nucleosomes, which are both negatively charged, is less obvious. The explanation for this lies in the structure of the nucleosome core particle. Luger et al. (25Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6991) Google Scholar) have shown using x-ray crystallography that although the histone octomer, comprising 2 molecules of histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, is surrounded by negatively charged DNA, the positively charged N termini of the histones extend out of core particle and past the DNA superhelix to allow contact with other macromolecules, normally other nucleosome particles. Here, we suggest that negatively charged D2S binds to the positively charged N-terminal regions of the histones that protrude from the nucleosome core (Fig. 7a). It has been shown previously that as a result of their accessibility the N-terminal regions of histones in a nucleosome particle can be digested with trypsin, leaving the rest of the complex intact (26Bohm L. Crane Robinson C. Biosci. Rep. 1984; 4: 365-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Under these conditions D2S binding to nucleosomes was completely attenuated, thus supporting the notion that binding is through these regions. A similar interaction with nucleosomes has been described previously for heparin (27Villeponteau B. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Indeed, competition binding studies performed here indicate that this interaction is common to a number of sulfated polysaccharides. Analysis of the competition binding data suggests that larger sulfated polysaccharides are better competitors. For example, high molecular weight dextran sulfate and fucoidan, the two largest compounds, are much better competitors than the smaller compounds such as D2S, heparin, and low molecular weight dextran sulfate, suggesting that the interaction between sulfated polysaccharides and nucleosomes is multimeric, with each molecule of sulfated polysaccharide binding to several nucleosome particles (Fig. 7). The data suggest that the binding of D2S to activated T-cells observed previously (13Shaunak S. Gooderham N.J. Edwards R.J. Payvandi N. Javan C.M. Baggett N. MacDermot J. Weber J.N. Davies D.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 113: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) is due to an interaction with nucleosomes that have adhered to the cell surface. The binding of nucleosomes to the cell surface also appears to be due to an interaction with sulfated polysaccharides. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) are large macromolecules that are present in the extracellular matrix and have been implicated in various biological roles such as presentation and localization of growth factors (28Gordon M.Y. Riley G.P. Watt S.M. Greaves M.F. Nature. 1987; 326: 403-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 29Roberts R. Gallagher J. Spooncer E. Allen T.D. Bloomfield F. Dexter T.M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 10337-10341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In competition binding studies, heparan sulfate, the sugar component of these large macromolecules, competed with D2S for binding to nucleosomes. Our data would suggest that HSPG are important for anchoring nucleosomes to the cell surface, since untreated cell membranes bound nucleosomes, whereas incubation of membranes with either heparitinase I or heparinase I abolished this binding. Heparitinase I cleaves heparan sulfate in areas of low sulfation, whereN-acetylated disaccharides (GlcNAc-α-1,4-GlcUA (N-acetylglucosaminyl-α1,4-glucuronic acid) are the predominant structural unit (32Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Heparinase I cleaves highly sulfated disaccharides of structure GlcNSO3 (+/−6S)-α1,4IdceA(2S) (N-sulfated glucosamine (6-sulfate)-α1,4-iduronic acid 2-sulfate (32Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Biochem.

Berden J.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1564-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) showed that HSPG in the glomerular basement membrane can bind circulating nucleosomes through an ionic interaction between HSPG and histones, although they suggested that for this to occur in vivo it would be necessary for autoimmune antibodies to bind to DNA in order to mask its negative charge. However, our work suggests that the negative charge of DNA does not interfere with the binding of sulfated polysaccharides for the reason discussed above. Various workers (1Hefeneider S.H.

Interestingly, none of the putative receptors outlined above have been sequenced, and in most of the studies the protein bands identified were quite broad and diffuse, suggesting that the proteins are highly glycosylated. It is possible that these putative receptors are in fact all various HSPG, and in each case nucleosomes bind to the heparan sulfate component of the glycoproteins. The function of cell surface nucleosomes is unclear at present, but several authors have suggested that they have some immunomodulatory role (1Hefeneider S.H. Cornell K.A. Brown L.E. Bakke A.C.

Subsequently, Hefeneider et al. (1Hefeneider S.H. Cornell K.A. Brown L.E. Bakke A.C. McCoy S.L. Bennett R.M. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1992; 63: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) reported that the binding of nucleosomes to the surface of murine T-cells results in antibody production and the release of interleukin-6, an important mediator of B-cell differentiation (38Rieckmann P. D'Alessandro F. Nordan R.P. Fauci A.S. Kehrl J.H. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3462-3468PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Emlen et al. (39Emlen W. Holers V.M. Arend W.P. Kotzin B. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3042-3048PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that interleukin-1β and lipopolysaccharide stimulate cell surface binding of nucleosomes on monocytes, and this in turn leads to further secretion of interleukin-1β. Additionally, there is increasing evidence that cell surface nucleosomes may be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as SLE. Burlingame et al. (40Burlingame R.W. Boey M.L. Starkebaum G. Rubin R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 184-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) and Amoura et al. (41Amoura Z. Chabre H. Koutouzov S. Lotton C. Cabrespines A. Bach J.F. Jacob L. Arthritis & Rheum. 1994; 37: 1684-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) have shown that the onset of the autoimmune response in murine models of SLE is characterized by the early emergence of antibodies that recognize conformational epitopes of the nucleosome particle but not its individual components, i.e.double-stranded DNA or histones. In addition, Mohan et al. (6Mohan C. Adams S. Stanik V. Datta S.K. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1367-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that nucleosomes are the major immunogen for pathogenic autoantibody-inducing T-helper cells in lupus mice, and accordingly, the (H2A-H2B)-DNA subnucleosome complex appear to be a potent immunogenic stimulus for autoimmune responses to histones and DNA in human SLE (40Burlingame R.W. Boey M.L. Starkebaum G. Rubin R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 184-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that nucleosomes play a role in the pathogenicity of anti-double-stranded DNA autoantibodies. Nucleosomes perfused into mice bind to the glomerulus (33van Bruggen M.C. Walgreen B. Rijke T.P. Tamboer W. Kramers K. Smeenk R.J. Monestier M. Fournie G.J. Berden J.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1564-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 42Coritsidis G.N.

Kidney Int. 1992; 42: 1363-1371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) reported that nucleosomes mediate the binding of anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies in the glomerulus. This study has revealed that nucleosomes are anchored to the cell surface of activated T-cells through an interaction with HSPG. It appears that this interaction is mediated through the sulfate regions found in the heparan sulfate component of the proteoglycan and the lysine and arginine residues present in the N-terminal region of histones. D2S, like other sulfated polysaccharides, is able to bind to cell surface nucleosomes (Fig. 7a) and, at high concentrations, displace them from the HSPG (Fig. 7b). In the absence of nucleosomes, as found in inactivated T-cells, sulfated polysaccharides are unable to bind to the cell surface (Fig. 7c). Thus, the binding of sulfated polysaccharides, including D2S, to the surface of activated T-cells is explained by the presence of cell surface nucleosomes."

The α1 subunit serves as the Ca2+ conducting pore, while the β and α2/δ subunits are auxiliary and modulate the activity of the α1 subunit (1Mori Y. Mikala G. Varadi G. Kobayashi T. Koch S.

Calcium is not only essential for contraction but also for various enzymatic reactions including activation of proteases, phosphatases, kinases, signal transduction cascades, and regulation of gene transcription (3Puceat M.

Pelzer S. Trautwein W. Pelzer D.J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 365-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). This forward signal is via cAMP-dependent protein kinase A phosphorylation of the channel (7McDonald T.F. Pelzer S. Trautwein W. Pelzer D.J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 365-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Other non-cAMP-dependent protein kinase-dependent mechanisms have also been proposed (8Daaka Y. Luttrel L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). However, there is little or no information regarding possible Ca2+-dependent regulation of the βAR signal transduction pathway via the l-VDCC. In order to investigate possible reciprocal regulation between these pathways in vivo, we overexpressed the α1subunit of the Ca2+ channel in hearts of Tg mice and studied channel activity and the βAR-G protein cascade by physiological and biochemical techniques. We found a major change in cardiac function regulated by the βAR system and conclude that Ca2+ derived from channel influx modules βAR activity. The overexpression construct was generated by ligating the full-length human l-VDCC α1C subunit (9Schultz D. Mikala G. Yatani A. Engle D.B. Iles D.E. Segers B. Sinke R.J. Weghuis D.O. Klöckner U.

Chem. 1991; 266: 9180-9185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and completed with a bovine growth hormone poly(A)-adenylation signal (Fig. 1A). The α-MHC-l-VDCC construct was cleaved with NotI and the α-MHC-l-VDCC fusion cDNA fragment was purified and eluted in oocyte injection buffer (5 mmTris-HCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). This construct (20 μg) was then microinjected into the male pronucleus of fertilized zygotes from superovulated FVB/n mice and the surviving zygotes implanted into pseudopregnant foster mothers. Transgenic founder mice were identified with genomic DNA utilizing polymerase chain reactions and confirmed by restricted Southern blotting. Polymerase chain reaction was carried out with a sense primer (5′-cactcttagcaaacctcagg-3′) specific for the α-MHC gene (bp 859) and an antisense primer (5′-caatgcgaccatctccacagtc-3′) located at bp 1530 of the human α1 subunit yielding a 375-bp product from mice expressing the transgene. For Southern blots, genomic DNA was extracted from tail clips of 18-day-old pups, digested with EcoRI, and separated on a 0.7% agarose gel. The α-MHC-l-VDCC construct (100 pg, 500 pg, and 1 ng) was cleaved with EcoRI and loaded on the gel for quantitation. Following transfer to supported nitrocellulose (Hybond-C extra, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the DNA was probed with a 2295-bp EcoRI fragment from the fusion construct (Fig. 1A). The fragment contained ∼1.5 kilobase pairs of the α-MHC promoter and 0.75 kilobase pair of thel-VDCC α1C cDNA. Radioactive bands were quantitated using PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Total RNA was isolated from frozen heart samples of Tg and nontransgenic (Ntg) littermate controls using TriZol (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Two μg of RNA was loaded onto Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a dot blot apparatus. Probing for the α1 subunit was completed with a 1350-bp fragment isolated by cleaving the α-MHC-l-VDCC vector withEcoRI (Fig. 1A). This fragment corresponds to bases 2098–3448 of the human heart α1 cDNA. The full-length l-VDCC β2a cDNA was used to probe for gene expression levels of the β subunit. The α2/δ subunit expression was analyzed using a 1550-bp fragment probe generated by cleaving the cDNA withHincII. Probing of the hypertrophic markers (atrial natriuretic factor, α-MHC, β-MHC, cardiac α-actin, skeletal α-actin, sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase, and phospholamban) using gene-specific antisense oligonucleotides were completed as described previously (11Jones W.K. Grupp I.L. Doetschman T. Grupp G. Osinska H. Hewett T.E. Boivin G.P. Gulick J. Ng W.A. Robbins J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1906-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). All probes were 32P-labeled by the random priming technique. Radiolabeled dot blots were quantitated using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) and normalized to the signal from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), since evidence from other mouse models has demonstrated no change in gene expression of GAPDH in Tg and Ntg littermates (11Jones W.K.

Eight- to ten-week-old Tg and Ntg littermates of either sex were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (intraperitoneal 30 mg/kg), protected with heparin, and placed in an isolated working heart mode as described (13Grupp I.L. Grupp G. Sfyris G. Hoit B.D. Walsh R.A. Cardiovascular Physiology in the Genetically Engineered Mouse. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1998Google Scholar). Following base line establishment, the heart was exposed to cumulative isoproterenol or forskolin concentrations and the inotropic, lusitropic (relaxation), and chronotropic responses measured. Analysis of left ventricular function and mass was assessed using an ATL HDI3000 broadband digital echo-Doppler machine as described previously (12D'Angelo D.D. Sakata Y. Lorenz J.N. Boivin G.P. Walsh R.A. Liggett S.B. Dorn II., G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8121-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Sedated, spontaneously breathing, mice were studied using two-dimensional-guided M-mode echocardiography to estimate left ventricular dimensions and wall thickness. Fractional shortening was calculated as (EDD-ESD)/EDD, where EDD is end diastolic dimension and ESD is end systolic dimension. Echocardiographic measurements were recorded and analyzed blinded. Single ventricular cells were isolated from the hearts of 8–10-week-old Tg and Ntg mice by enzymatic dissociation protocol as described previously (14Tohse N. Nakaya H. Kanno M. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 1441-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) using Type I collagenase (Worthington).l-type Ca2+ channel currents were recorded using the whole-cell mode of the patch clamp method (15Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15172) Google Scholar). Measurement of adenylyl cyclase activity using a cAMP125I radioimmunoassay kit (NEN Life Science Products) and radioligand binding of the βAR were carried out as described (16Green S.A. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26215-26219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Powdered tissue for cAMP measurements was prepared by homogenizing in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in a glass homogenizer. Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and stored at −70 °C. The particulate fraction (50 μg/ml of protein) was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with reagents as described (17Xiao R.-P. Tomhave E.D. Wang D.-J. Ji X. Boluyt M.O. Cheng H. Lakatta E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1273-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), in a final volume of 0.5 ml of cAMP reaction buffer. cAMP measurements were performed using a competitive protein-binding cAMP 3H assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Proteins were solubilized by adding 0.5 ml of 1 n NaOH to the trichloroacetic acid-extracted tubes and quantified using Bio-Rad assay. Data are reported as means ± S.E. n values are equivalent to the number of mice tested except for the patch clamp experiments, which indicates the number of cardiomyocytes used. A Student's t test was used for statistical comparisons between Tg and Ntg hearts with a two-tailp value of <0.05 considered significant. Using the α-MHC promoter, the human l-VDCC α1C subunit was overexpressed in mouse ventricles (Fig. 1A). The α-MHC promoter becomes active within a few days after birth and reaches steady state maximal activity around day 60 (18Subramaniam A. Jones W.K. Gulick J. Wert S. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24613-24620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore used 8–10-week-old mice for our studies. A total of five founder lines were identified, classified as M1–M5. Two of these transgenic lines died within 8 weeks of age. Pathological examination of these two lines revealed severe myocardial hypertrophy and dilatation. Other transgenic lines were maintained at heterozygosity and compared with Ntg littermates for controls. The M1 and M5 lines had similar α1 subunit protein levels. Experiments were predominantly carried out in the M1 line except as noted. Transgenic mice had no overt phenotype by observation. Additionally, litter sizes and pup survivals were similar to Ntg littermates. Loading known amounts of plasmid construct, the M1 line was determined to carry eight copies of the transgene (Fig. 1B). A quantitative RNA dot blot showed a 2.8-fold increase in the α1 subunit and no change in the β and α2/δ subunits (Fig. 1C, Table I). In order to determine whether the increased gene product was translated into corresponding α1 subunit protein, homogenates were probed with specific antisera that does not distinguish between endogenous and Tg α1 protein. Western analysis revealed a clear increase in α1 subunit protein (data not shown). Assays of 8-week-old ventricular RNA for potentially regulated cardiac genes showed a significant 6.6-fold increase in ANF mRNA levels, but no significant differences in α-MHC, β-MHC, cardiac α-actin, skeletal α-actin, sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase, and phospholamban gene expression (Table I).Table ImRNA transcripts for hypertrophic markers and L-VDCC subunitsTranscriptNontransgenicTransgenic-Fold increaseduANF0.2 ± 0.2 (n = 4)1.2 ± 0.3 (n = 4)6.6ap < 0.05 versus Ntg.α-MHC3.5 ± 2.3 (n = 4)5.4 ± 1.7 (n = 4)1.3β-MHC0.5 ± 0.2 (n = 4)0.6 ± 0.2 (n = 4)1.3α SK actin0.4 ± 0.1 (n = 4)0.5 ± 0.1 (n = 4)1.3SERCA21.8 ± 0.6 (n = 4)1.7 ± 0.4 (n = 4)0.9PLB3.1 ± 1.0 (n = 4)3.1 ± 0.9 (n = 4)1.0Cardiac actin4.9 ± 2.2 (n = 4)3.5 ± 0.9 (n = 4)0.7α1 subunit10.6 ± 1.1 (n = 7)29.4 ± 8.2 (n = 7)2.8ap < 0.05 versus Ntg.α2/δ subunit2.2 ± 0.1 (n = 3)2.0 ± 0.1 (n = 5)0.9β subunit3.2 ± 0.1 (n = 3)3.0 ± 0.2 (n = 5)0.9Abbreviations: du, densitometric units; α SK actin, α skeletal actin; SERCA2, sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase 2; PLB, phospholamban.a p < 0.05 versus Ntg.

We hypothesized that the increased α1 subunit in the transgenics should result in augmented contractility. Indeed, basal contractility and relaxation (expressed as +dP/dtand −dP/dt) were significantly higher for Tg hearts (4760 ± 46 mmHg/s and −3935 ± 56 mmHg/s,n = 5) compared with Ntg hearts (4094 ± 44 and −3160 ± 56, n = 4, p < 0.05). Infusion of the β-adrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol, did not elicit the expected inotropic and lusitropic (relaxation, diastole) increases observed in Ntg animals (Fig. 2). Heart rate increases were, however, comparable and normal for isoproterenol effects in both sets of mice (data not shown). Additionally, increases in contractility induced by forskolin (direct AC activator) were significantly decreased in Tg hearts compared with the Ntgs, suggesting that the defect in the βAR signaling pathway is not limited to an “uncoupling” of the receptor (Table II).Table IIPhysiological and biochemical responses to isoproterenol and forskolinNtg % increaseTg % increaseWorking heart (+dP/dt)Iso, 10−8m60 ± 7 (n = 6)−6 ± 1 (n = 4)ap < 0.05 versusnontransgenic.FSK, 10−6m78 ± 3 (n = 4)38 ± 13 (n = 3)ap < 0.05 versusnontransgenic.Peak Ca2+ currentIso, 10−7m72 ± 22 (n = 6)19 ± 11 (n = 5)ap < 0.05 versusnontransgenic.FSK, 10−5m106 ± 27 (n = 5)23 ± 24 (n = 6)ap < 0.05 versusnontransgenic.cAMP (pmols/mg)Iso, 10−5m89 ± 15 (n = 5)0.6 ± 5 (n = 5)ap < 0.05 versusnontransgenic.FSK, 10−5m214 ± 17 (n = 5)36 ± 6 (n = 5)ap < 0.05 versusnontransgenic.Abbreviations: Ntg, nontransgenic; Tg, transgenic; Iso, isoproterenol; FSK, forskolin.

Data are presented as means ± S.E. Echocardiographic measurements indicated that left ventricular end-diastolic dimension and posterior wall thickness were minimally increased in Tg as compared with Ntg mice (TableIII). Left ventricular mass in the transgenic hearts was clearly increased (23%) compared with Ntg hearts. However, no significant differences were found in left ventricular end-systolic dimension, septal wall thickness, or fractional shortening percentage (Table III). Heart-to-body weight differences were significantly increased in Tg animals compared with Ntg littermates (Table III). These findings are consistent with a mild hypertrophy without ventricular dysfunction. On the other hand,ex vivo studies of these hearts revealed increases in basal contractility and a dramatic loss of βAR responsiveness.Table IIIMorphometric and echocardiographic measurements on transgenic and nontransgenic miceNontransgenicTransgenicMorphometricn = 14n = 14Body weight, g23.8 ± 0.824.6 ± 0.9Heart weight, mg132.2 ± 7.5152.2 ± 6.7HW/BW, mg/g5.6 ± 0.36.2 ± 0.2*Echocardiographicn = 5n = 5LVEDD, mm3.5 ± 0.13.8 ± 0.04*LVESD, mm2.0 ± 0.12.3 ± 0.08PWT, mm0.59 ± 0.020.66 ± 0.03*SWT, mm0.55 ± 0.020.56 ± 0.02FS, %44 ± 241 ± 2LV mass, mg48.6 ± 2.259.6 ± 2.6*Abbreviations: BW, body weight; HW, heart weight; LVEDD, left ventricular end diastolic dimension; LVESD, left ventricular end systolic dimension; PWT, posterior wall thickness; SWT, septal wall thickness; FS, fractional shortening; LV, left ventricular.

To determine possible functional changes in the l-type Ca2+ channels, whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were carried out on isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes. Average cell capacitance was significantly larger in the Tg myocytes compared with Ntg myocytes (206.6 ± 16.5 pF, n = 9versus 161.1 ± 7.1 pF, n = 7,p < 0.05), which indicates cellular hypertrophy.l-VDCC current amplitude was larger in the Tg myocytes compared with Ntg myocytes (Fig. 3,A and B). Average peak current amplitude was 1.8 ± 0.2 nA (n = 7) for Tg myocytes and 1.3 ± 0.1 nA (n = 9) for Ntg myocytes (p< 0.05, Fig. 3C). When the current amplitude was normalized for cell capacitance, there was no significant difference between Tg and Ntg cardiomyocytes (8.8 ± 0.6 pA/pF (n = 9) and 8.3 ± 0.6 pA/pF (n = 7)). There were no significant differences in the voltage dependence of activation or the activation/inactivation kinetics of the channels (data not shown). The l-VDCC has been identified as a downstream phosphorylation target of the β-adrenergic receptor cascade (7McDonald T.F. Pelzer S. Trautwein W. Pelzer D.J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 365-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). To determine whether this cascade remained intact in the Tg mice, isolated cells were stimulated with isoproterenol. When cells isolated from Ntg mice were superfused with 10−7misoproterenol, peak Ca2+ channel currents were augmented by 72.9 ± 21.6% (n = 6), but only 19.4 ± 11.4% (n = 5) for the transgenics (p< 0.05) (Fig. 3E). Consistent with the results in the intact heart experiments, forskolin produced only a small increase in the peak Ca2+ current in the Tg hearts compared with the robust increases observed in the Ntgs (Table II). To examine the blunted isoproterenol and forskolin responses found in whole heart and single cells, the βAR signaling pathway was investigated using isolated membranes. No change in total βAR receptor density was found (Tg, 19.2 ± 1.2 fmol/mg; Ntg, 19.6 ± 0.6 fmol/mg; n = 3). Isoproterenol-stimulated activities were 150% of basal in Ntg mice (i.e. a ∼50% increase over basal). In marked contrast, isoproterenol failed to stimulate AC activity in membranes from the Tg mice (indeed levels were slightly below basal) (Fig. 3F). Basal AC levels were 44.8 ± 17 pmol/min/mg for Ntg and 52.7 ± 11 pmol/min/mg for Tg extracts. As predicted NaF and forskolin-stimulated activities were depressed compared with Ntg, but the values did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 3F). Direct cAMP measurements further supported the loss of the βAR responsiveness. As observed in the AC assays, Tg membranes did not respond to isoproterenol nor was forskolin able to restore cAMP levels to the Ntg levels (Table II). We constructed a transgenic mouse in which the l-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel was overexpressed. The transgene is defined as an increased VDCC by four criteria, Southern analysis, RNA analysis, electrophysiological identification of an increased Ca2+ current, and a higher basal contractile state in the Tg animals compared with the Ntgs. Thus, these characteristics reflect a probable small, but sustained, increase in Ca2+ influx in Tg myocytes that explains the significant increase in basal contraction and relaxation we observed. Accompanying the latter, we found a surprising and striking loss of the usual effects of a well known β1,2 adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, on myocardial contraction. In contrast, the heart rate increases secondary to isoproterenol administration were normal, which defines an interesting separation of β-agonist actions on contractility and heart rate. This differentiation implies that downstream effectors and/or intermediates in the G protein pathway for β-agonist action are different for contractility and heart rate. It seems possible that for heart rate regulation Ca2+ derived from the l-VDCC may not be limiting as it is for contraction. Consistent with the loss of contractile action was a blunting of isoproterenol and forskolin stimulation of Ca2+current in isolated myocytes. Thus, the effects found on the whole heart were for the most part duplicated on single cells for both isoproterenol and forskolin. We refer to this loss of β-agonist contraction effect as a defect or a “loose coupling” in the βAR signaling pathways. The present data provide convincing evidence for a novel “reciprocal regulation” of βAR signaling by an increased influx of Ca2+ provided by the l-VDCC. A possible mechanism to consider is protein kinase C activation by Ca2+ (19Akhter S.A. Milano C.A. Shotwell K.F. Cho M. Rockman H.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21253-21259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) that in turn activates βAR kinase leading to phosphorylation of the βAR resulting in a decrease in signaling activity (20Bristow M.R. Am. J. Cardiol. 1997; 80: 26L-40LAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Other mechanisms possibly responsible for the loss of βAR signaling include an inhibition of AC activity by Ca2+ (21Colvin R.A. Oibo J.A. Allen R.A. Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Yu H.J. Ma H. Green R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 689-693PubMed Google Scholar, 23Fagan K.A. Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9297-9305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and an indirect up-regulated phosphatase activity via calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (24Maltsev V.A. Ji G.J. Wobus A.M. Fleischmann B.K. Hescheler J. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The latter is supported by recent data implicating calcineurin in cardiac hypertrophy (5Molkentin J.D. Lu J.-R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar). Further possibilities include up-regulation of Gi, changes in the ratio of β1AR:β2AR isoforms, etc. (20Bristow M.R. Am. J. Cardiol. 1997; 80: 26L-40LAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Consistent with the suggestion of a Ca2+-dependent “cascade” involving a phosphatase is the slow development of hypertrophy and subsequent cardiac failure in these animals. Our results suggest an interesting “cross-talk” between thel-VDCC and the βAR in vivo . A modest increase in the α1 subunit of thel-VDCC in cardiomyocytes results in a remarkable decrease in β-adrenergic signaling that affects contractility but interestingly does not alter the usual responses of heart rate to βAR agonists. The Ca2+ channel α1 overexpression also produces a setting in which late stage ventricular remodeling occurs. This is surprising, since the cardiac cell has a remarkable network of sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria that one would think would be poised to sequester any increase in calcium. In all experimental models of hypertrophy in which “Ca2+overload” was produced in no case was a paradigm used in which a small but sustained Ca2+ increase through thel-VDCC was provided. Clearly the present experiments show that the l-VDCC in heart is a highly sensitive conduit for Ca2+ as the link between excitation and contraction. Furthermore, it is likely that the increased calcium is sequestered in a pool that is linked to a growth program. A very recent publication has revealed a pathway to gene expression and growth that requires a very low concentration of calcium (25Carrión A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellström B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). These Tg mice represent the first animal model with an increase in voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels specifically in the heart that provides a paradigm for studies of the role of Ca2+ in growth adaptation (25Carrión A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellström B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), maladaptation, and receptor/channel regulation. We thank Dr. J. Robbins and J.

Here we show that only the fraction of commercial heparin or rat liver heparan sulfate which binds to immobilized antithrombin formed an FGF-binding binary complex with the ectodomain of the FGFR kinase. Conversely, only the fraction of heparin that binds to immobilized FGFR inhibited Factor Xa in the presence of antithrombin. Only the antithrombin-bound fraction of heparin competed with (3)H-heparin bound to FGFR in absence of FGF, whereas both antithrombin-bound and unretained fractions competed with radiolabeled heparin bound independently to FGF-1 and FGF-2. The antithrombin-bound fraction of heparin was required to support the heparin-dependent stimulation of DNA synthesis of endothelial cells by FGF-1. The requirement for divalent cations and the antithrombin-binding motif distinguish the role of heparan sulfate as an integral subunit of the FGFR complex from the wider range of effects of heparan sulfates and homologues on FGF signaling through FGFR-independent interactions with FGF."
https://openalex.org/W2076004268,"Thioredoxin reductases (TRR) serve critical roles in maintaining cellular redox states. Two isoforms of TRR have been identified in mammals: both contain a penultimate selenocysteine residue that is essential for catalytic activity. A search of the genome of the invertebrate, Caenorhabditis elegans, reveals a gene highly homologous to mammalian TRR, with a TGA selenocysteine codon at the corresponding position. A selenocysteyl-tRNA was identified in this organism several years ago, but no selenoproteins have been identified experimentally.

The synthesis of selenoproteins requires several specialized components of the translational machinery (reviewed in Ref. 1Low S.C. Berry M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 203-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In addition to tRNASec and the enzymes necessary for generation of charged selenocysteyl-tRNASec, this process requires a selenocysteine specific elongation factor, SelB, identified so far only in prokaryotes. Specific secondary structures in the mRNAs of selenoproteins are required to distinguish UGA selenocysteine codons from stop codons. These structures, termed selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) 1The abbreviations used are: SECIS, selenocysteine insertion sequence; D1, type 1 deiodinase; GPX, glutathione peroxidase; GR, glutathione reductase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; TR, thioredoxin; TRR, thioredoxin reductase; UTR, untranslated region.1The abbreviations used are: SECIS, selenocysteine insertion sequence; D1, type 1 deiodinase; GPX, glutathione peroxidase; GR, glutathione reductase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; TR, thioredoxin; TRR, thioredoxin reductase; UTR, untranslated region. elements, are located adjacent to the UGA codons in prokaryotes and in the 3′-UTR of selenoprotein mRNAs in eukaryotes (2Berry M.J. Banu L. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic SECIS elements are characterized by a small number of conserved nucleotides at specific positions in the stem-loop. These are foremost, the invariable sequence motif “AUGA,” which pairs with “GA” opposite each other on the 5′ and 3′ arms of the stem, respectively, and two or three adenosines in either the terminal loop or an internal bulge. In all vertebrate selenoprotein mRNAs identified to date these sequences are highly conserved. Mutagenesis studies have shown that the conserved nucleotides and secondary structural features are necessary to suppress the stop codon function of a UGA codon and to decode it as selenocysteine (3Martin III, G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 65-73PubMed Google Scholar, 4Martin III, G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The ability to synthesize selenoproteins is of fundamental importance in mammals, as deletion of the gene for selenocysteyl-tRNA leads to an embryonic lethal phenotype in a mouse model (5Bosl M.R. Takaku K. Oshima M. Nishimura S. Taketo M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5531-5534Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The selenoprotein or proteins responsible for this lethality have not been determined. Cytoplasmic glutathione peroxidase, a selenoprotein functioning in breakdown of toxic hydroperoxides, appears not to be critical for normal development of mammals, probably due to redundancy in the glutathione peroxidase gene family (6Ho Y.S. Magnenat J.L. Bronson R.T. Cao J. Gargano M. Sugawara M. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16644-16651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Among the 13 eukaryotic selenoproteins identified to date, thioredoxin reductase (TRR) is a strong candidate for an essential selenoprotein. TRR is a disulfide oxidoreductase with a broad substrate specificity; it reduces among many other substrates the active site disulfide in oxidized thioredoxin. Thioredoxin (TR) is an important cofactor in a large number of biological processes. While a knockout model for TRR has not been reported to date, targeted disruption of the TR gene causes early embryonic lethality, and TRR is the only known reductant of TR (7Matsui M. Oshima M. Oshima H. Takaku K. Maruyama T. Yodoi J. Taketo M.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Two TRR isoforms have been described in several mammalian species, both of which contain a UGA codon encoding selenocysteine as the penultimate C-terminal amino acid (8Gasdaska P.Y. Gasdaska J.R.

Biochem. 1999; 261: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Putative SECIS elements are present in the 3′-UTRs of both sequences. In contrast to other selenoenzymes, it has been proposed that the selenocysteine residues in the TRRs are not in the predicted catalytic site, but function to carry reducing equivalents from the active site to substrates (13Gromer S. Wissing J. Behne D. Ashman K. Schirmer R.H. Flohe L. Becker K. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 591-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, selenocysteine is critical for reducing thioredoxin, as demonstrated by the loss of activity upon chemical alteration (14Nordberg J. Zhong L. Holmgren A. Arner E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10835-10842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) or proteolytic removal of this amino acid (13Gromer S. Wissing J. Behne D. Ashman K. Schirmer R.H. Flohe L. Becker K. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 591-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The C. elegans gene for selenocysteyl-tRNA was identified by Lee et al. in 1990 (15Lee B.J. Rajagopalan M. Kim Y.S. You K.H. Jacobson K.B. Hatfield D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1940-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), indicating that selenoprotein genes would likely be present. To date, no selenoproteins have been experimentally identified in C. elegans. Since the complete genome of C. elegans has been sequenced, and this organism is amenable to genetic studies, it promises to be a valuable model system for the study of eukaryotic selenoprotein synthesis. In this study, we show that C. elegans expresses at least one selenoprotein. This protein migrates with the predicted size of a thioredoxin reductase homologue in the C. elegans sequence data base. We further show that the selenium-labeled protein reacts in Western blotting analysis with an antibody prepared against a human TRR peptide, providing evidence for its identification as a TRR homologue. Finally, we report identification and characterization of a functional SECIS element in the 3′UTR of the C. elegans TRR gene. This SECIS element deviates at a previously invariant position from all vertebrate SECIS elements reported to date, but functions to direct selenocysteine incorporation in a mammalian cell line. C. elegans strain bristol (N2) was used throughout these studies (16Mandel S.J. Berry M.J. Kieffer J.D. Harney J.W. Warne R.L. Larsen P.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1992; 75: 1133-1139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For 75Se labeling of worms, their food source,Escherichia coli strain OP50, was grown overnight in 1 ml of Luria broth medium containing 20 μCi of 75Se.75Se-labeled bacteria were harvested by pelleting, resuspended in M9 buffer (22 mmKH2PO4, 42 mmNa2HPO4, 85 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4), and dispensed on 60-mm plates containing 3 ml of nematode growth medium agar. Worms were grown at 22 °C on lawns of 75Se-labeled E. coli and harvested by washing them off the plates in M9 buffer, followed by sedimentation at 800 × g for 5 min and three washes in M9 buffer. The pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and sonicated. As a protease inhibitor 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added. Lysates were stored at −20 °C until further use. All of the predicted protein sequences were first identified in the genomic sequences generated by the C. elegans Genome Sequencing Consortium. The TBLASTN algorithm was run against the Washington University Genome Sequencing Center C. elegans data base to identify sequences that encode proteins with homology to mammalian selenoproteins. We identified a gene with 71% sequence similarity to human (h)TRR (GenBankTM accession number 2500117). This sequence was used to search the GenBankTM expressed sequence tag data base and led to the identification of the cDNA clone yk384f6 (provided by Y. Kohara, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan). The cDNA sequence of yk384f6 was determined by automated sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The sequence of this cDNA clone confirmed the predicted intron/exon junctions. Total RNA was isolated from mixed stage populations ofC. elegans. Worms were first ground into a fine powder using a liquid nitrogen-cooled mortar and pestle. Powdered C. elegans (200 mg) were homogenized in 2 ml of TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA was collected from the aqueous phase following the addition of chloroform, precipitated by adding isopropyl alcohol, and air-dried. First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcriptase using oligo(dT) as primer and used as template in PCR with primers flanking the predicted start and stop codon. The PCR product was sequenced with primer CB 122 (see below) by automated sequencing. The minimal SECIS element of TRR was generated by PCR using the overlapping primers CB122 (CCAAGCTTTAGGCGGGTGACGACCTTTGGCTAAACT) and CB124 (GGGCGGCCGCCATCAGACCAGAGGCGCTCACGATGG). The mutant SECIS element (for construct 151) was generated using primer CB123, CCAAGCTTTAGGCGGGTAACGACCTTTGGCTAAACT (mutation indicated in bold). Constructs 150 (wild type SECIS) and 151 (mutant SECIS) were derived by subcloning the PCR fragments (viaHindIII and NotI) into a construct expressing rat D1 (G16D10ΔH3), substituting the TRR SECIS element for that of rat D1 (4Martin III, G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Sequences were confirmed by automated sequencing. All constructs were cotransfected with plasmid pTKGH, a thymidine kinase promoter-directed human growth hormone-expressing plasmid, into HEK-293 cells by calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (17Buettner C. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33374-33378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiencies were monitored by assay of human growth hormone in the media. Cell sonicates were assayed for the presence of 5′ deiodinase activity as described previously (18Berry M.J. Maia A.L. Kieffer J.D. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1848-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Deiodinase activities were calculated per microliter of cell sonicate and normalized to amount of growth hormone secreted into the media. Typically 200 μg of crude 75Se-labeled C. elegans homogenate was combined with 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.3125 mTris-HCl, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 50% glycerol, 0.5 mg/ml bromphenol blue, pH 8.3) and heated for 5 min at 100 °C. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis on 10% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide:bis, 37.5:1), followed by electrotransfer to Immobilon (Millipore) in 20% methanol, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 192 mmglycine. Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in TBS-Tween (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), incubated with antibody 2098 (generous gift of John Gasdaska), at 1:200 dilution in 1.25% (w/v) nonfat milk in TBS-Tween, followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (NEN Life Science Products). Reaction products were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposure to X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.). After extensive washing of the membrane and decay of the chemiluminescent signal, the membrane was subjected to autoradiography for 7 days. To identify selenoproteins in C. elegans, we developed a75Se labeling technique based on their food source, bacteria. E. coli were cultured in Luria broth media containing 75Se. This led to incorporation of75Se predominantly into two E. coliselenoproteins. Worms were allowed to feed on a lawn of75Se-labeled bacterial for 24 h, until bacteria were depleted, then harvested for analysis of 75Se incorporation. Since there are always trace amounts of bacteria in the gut of C. elegans, we also prepared a lysate of the75Se-labeled bacteria. SDS-PAGE analysis of C. elegans homogenate reveals three major selenoprotein bands, two in the 80–95 kDa size range and one of ∼58 kDa. The two upper bands are also present in the bacterial lysate and correspond in size to the isoforms of bacterial formate dehydrogenases (19Heider J. Baron C. Bock A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3759-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The most prominent selenoprotein in C. elegans, which is not found in the bacterial lysate, is the 58-kDa protein (Fig. 1). Thus, the 58-kDa band likely represents a C. elegans selenoprotein. In control experiments we treated the C. elegans lysate with RNase A. No difference in labeling pattern was seen compared with the untreated lysate, suggesting that none of the bands visible by autoradiography are of RNA origin (data not shown). We performed a search of theC. elegans genome data base with the sequences of all known mammalian selenoproteins. This search revealed a gene highly homologous to mammalian TRR, with a TGA selenocysteine codon at the corresponding position (Fig. 2, GenBankTMaccession number 1397273). No homologues of any of the three isoforms of the iodothyronine deiodinases, selenoprotein P, or selenoprotein W were found. Homologues of glutathione peroxidases, selenophosphate synthetase (Sps2), and a 15-kDa selenoprotein (20Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.T. Wootton J.C. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8910-8915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) are present, but each contains a cysteine codon in place of the TGA selenocysteine codon found in the corresponding mammalian gene. Thus, the C. elegans thioredoxin reductase is the only homologue of a known mammalian selenoprotein containing a conserved selenocysteine codon. To obtain evidence for the identity of the75Se-labeled 58-kDa protein as a thioredoxin reductase-like protein, we performed Western analysis using a polyclonal antibody against human TRR. The antibody was raised against an hTRR peptide sequence, which shares 17 of 21 amino acids (81% identity) with the corresponding C. elegans sequence (Fig. 2) and thus might be predicted to cross-react with the worm protein. Western analysis of the75Se-labeled C. elegans lysate revealed an antibody-reactive protein of the predicted size (Fig. 3, hTRR antibody) and two additional cross-reacting bands. After extensive washing of the membrane and decay of the chemiluminescent signal, we used autoradiography to visualize the 75Se-labeled band. Superimposing the autoradiograph and chemiluminescence film revealed that the C. elegans-specific 58-kDa75Se-labeled band and one of the three Western blot bands comigrated precisely (Fig. 3, 75Se labeling), providing strong evidence for identification of the 75Se-labeled band as a TRR homologue. The presence of additional cross-reacting bands prompted us to further examine the C. elegans data base for other sequences bearing homology to the human TRR peptide. After TRR, the next highest scoring matches were the glutathione reductase (GR) sequence and an uncharacterized pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase, C46F11, both exhibiting 57% identity (Fig. 2). GR and C46F11 do not contain UGA selenocysteine codons and do not correspond in their predicted sizes to the 58-kDa protein identified by75Se labeling. The predicted molecular masses of GR and C46F11 are 55 and 51.5 kDa, respectively. We next searched the sequence of the C. elegansTRR 3′-UTR for a potential SECIS element. Although there are several “AUGA” motifs in the 3′-UTR, none appeared in the context of a SECIS element. However, by extending the search to sequences which are similar but not identical to this motif, we identified a putative SECIS element that deviates from the vertebrate consensus by one nucleotide. The worm element, beginning with “GUGA” instead of “AUGA”, is predicted to fold like a vertebrate form 2 SECIS element with a characteristic 10-base pair stem, an adenosine bulge, and an upper stem and small terminal loop (Fig. 4). To investigate the ability of this putative SECIS element to direct selenocysteine incorporation in a mammalian cell line, we generated a construct containing the TRR SECIS element linked to the rat D1 coding region. This construct was transiently transfected into the human embryonic kidney-derived cell line HEK-293, and production of deiodinase activity was assessed. We have shown previously that a functional SECIS element is required for incorporation of selenocysteine into this protein, which in turn is required for maximal deiodinase activity (21Berry M.J. Kieffer J.D. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14155-14158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (18Berry M.J. Maia A.L. Kieffer J.D. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1848-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The putative C. elegans SECIS element directed selenocysteine incorporation at an activity level slightly higher (134 ± 1.6%) than the wild type rat D1 SECIS element. Mutation of the invariant “G,” the third nucleotide in the “AUGA” motif, in either the rat glutathione peroxidase or rat D1 SECIS elements was shown previously to reduce activity to ∼6% (22Walczak R. Carbon P. Krol A. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 74-84PubMed Google Scholar) or to undetectable levels (3Martin III, G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 65-73PubMed Google Scholar) (17Buettner C. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33374-33378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), respectively. In the C. elegans SECIS element, this “G” to “A” mutation (Fig. 4) also resulted in near complete inactivation (3% of rat D1). In this study, we report identification of the first selenoprotein and the first SECIS element in C. elegans. The protein migrates with the apparent molecular weight of a thioredoxin reductase homologue in the sequence data base and exhibits antibody cross-reactivity with members of this family of enzymes. Blast searches against the genome sequence of C. elegans (1998 number 85) using the protein sequences of all known vertebrate selenoproteins revealed the TRR sequence to be the only homologue of a vertebrate selenoprotein with a UGA codon at the corresponding position (Fig. 2). It has been speculated that this C. elegans homologue might be a selenoprotein based on the presence of the conserved UGA codon (23Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Park J. Park S.I. Chittum H.S. Baek H.J. Carlson B.A. Yang E.S. Moustafa M.E. Lee B.J. Compr. Nat. Prod. Chem. 1999; 4: 353-380Crossref Google Scholar). Herein, we provide experimental evidence supporting the identity of the major C. elegans selenoprotein as TRR by Western analysis of 75Se-labeled C. elegans homogenates and autoradiography of the same membrane, allowing superimposition of the two films. Our labeling studies indicate that this protein is by far the most prominent selenoprotein in C. elegans. In addition to the putative TRR homologue, a 75Se-labeled band migrating at ∼40 kDa was detected with varying intensity in different labeling experiments. The identity and source of this band are unknown; it may represent a degradation product derived from proteolysis of either the putative worm TRR or one of the bacterial selenoproteins. All vertebrate selenoproteins contain at least one SECIS element, which is required for decoding UGA as a selenocysteine codon. An “AUGA” motif within the structural context of a SECIS element is invariant in all previously characterized eukaryotic selenoprotein sequences. Only after searching for SECIS-like structures, while allowing for deviations from the consensus, did we identify a putative stem loop structure meeting the requirements of a form 2 SECIS element. In this SECIS element, a “GUGA” motif is present instead of “AUGA”. This sequence still allows formation of the “GA quartet” shown recently to be critical for SECIS function in vertebrates (3Martin III, G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. RNA (N.

Finally, a point mutation disrupting the ability to form the “GA quartet” resulted in near complete loss of activity, consistent with this element functioning analogously to mammalian SECIS elements. This suggests that the mechanism of selenocysteine incorporation may be evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes. It is not known whether the “GUGA” motif is specific for nematodes. The existence of an expressed sequence tag clone from the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus encoding a TRR homologue with a UGA codon at the corresponding position (GenBankTMaccession number AA680606) suggests that in this subspecies TRR is also a selenoprotein. The sequence of the 3′-UTR, which would allow the search for a SECIS element in this gene, remains to be determined. Since the genome of C. elegans has been completely sequenced, this sequence information could lead to the identification of components of the translational machinery required for selenoprotein synthesis. The genome of C. elegans contains selenocysteyl-tRNA (Sel C) and selenophosphate synthetase (Sel D) genes, the only two components of the selenoprotein translational machinery identified in eukaryotes to date. Interestingly, whereasDrosophila and humans have two forms of selenophosphate synthetase (Sel D), one form being itself a selenoprotein, C. elegans has only one (Y45F10A.4, GenBankTM accession number 3880988). This Sel D homologue exhibits similarity to both Sel D type 1 (50% identity) and type 2 (52% identity), but contains a cysteine codon at the position corresponding to Sec 63 in human Sel D type 2. A partial cDNA sequence from another filarial nematode,Brugia malayi indicates the presence of a cysteine-containing Sel D homologue (GenBankTM accession number AA585621). Glutathione peroxidase (GPX) is a selenoenzyme in vertebrates, but inC. elegans, as well as in the filarial nematodesDirofilaria immiti and Brugia phalangi, the homologues to GPX contain cysteine residues substituted for selenocysteine in the active site. The Dirofilaria immitiversion of GPX exhibits a low level GPX activity compared with selenocysteine-containing GPX, when expressed in a bacterial expression system (24Tripp C. Frank R.S. Selkirk M.E. Tang L. Grieve M.M. Frank G.R. Grieve R.B. Exp. Parasitol. 1998; 88: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This might indicate that in evolutionary terms it is more important to have a highly active, selenocysteine-containing TRR than a highly active GPX, providing the selective pressure to maintain the translational machinery required for selenoprotein synthesis. Since the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not contain genes for selenocysteyl-tRNA or selenophosphate synthetase, and no selenoproteins have been identified experimentally in yeast, genetic studies of selenoprotein synthesis in eukaryotes have not been feasible to date. C. elegans could thus provide a long awaited model system for genetic dissection of this process in higher organisms. The technique of RNA-mediated interference in C. elegans and the facility of generating transgenic worms offer powerful approaches for studying selenoprotein synthesis, as well as the functions of this important redox protein in basal cellular processes and in development.

We previously established a model of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2)-deficient differentiated PLB-985 cells (PLB-D cells) and demonstrated that cPLA2-generated arachidonic acid (AA) is essential for NADPH oxidase activation (Dana, R., Leto, T., Malech, H., and Levy, R. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 441–445). In the present study, we used this model to determine the physiological role of cPLA2 in the regulation of both the H+ channel and the Na+/H+ antiporter and to study whether NADPH oxidase activation is regulated by either of these transporters. PLB-D cells and two controls: parent PLB-985 cells and PLB-985 cells transfected with the vector only (PLB cells) were differentiated using 1.25% Me2SO or 5 × 10−8m1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Activation of differentiated PLB cells resulted in a Zn2+-sensitive alkalization, indicating H+ channel activity. In contrast, differentiated PLB-D cells failed to activate the H+ channel, but the addition of exogenous AA fully restored this activity, indicating the role of cPLA2 in H+ channel activation. The presence of the H+ channel inhibitor Zn2+ caused significant inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity, suggesting a role of the H+ channel in regulating oxidase activity. Na+/H+ antiporter activity was stimulated in differentiated PLB-D cells, indicating that cPLA2 does not participate in the regulation of this antiporter. These results establish an essential and specific physiological requirement of cPLA2-generated AA for activation of the H+channel and suggest the participation of this channel in the regulation of NADPH oxidase activity.

The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is a multicomponent transport chain that transfers electrons from NADPH to molecular oxygen and generates superoxide, a precursor of microbicidal oxidants important to host defense. NADPH oxidase subunits include three cytoplasmic components, p47 phox, p67 phox, and Rac2, and a membrane flavocytochrome b558 composed of gp91 phox and p22 phox (1Nunoi H. Rotrosen D. Gallin J.I.

In phagocytes, stimulation results in translocation of the cytosolic NADPH oxidase components to the membrane, where they interact with the flavocytochrome to form the activated oxidase. Oxidation of NADPH to NADP+ results in an increase in intracellular H+, a concomitant drop in pHi (10Grinstein S. Furuya W. Am. J.

It has been demonstrated that the single electron transfer from internal NADPH, through the oxidase complex, to external oxygen is an electrogenic process and that the efflux of H+ through the H+ channel is necessary for charge compensation (17Henderson L.M.

The channel was found to be singularly H+-selective, voltage-gated outwardly rectifying, regulated by both external and internal protons and sensitive to heavy metals (Cd2+ and Zn2+). A series of recent studies suggest that AA 1The abbreviations used are: AA, arachidonic acid; 1,25(OH)2D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5-(6)- carboxyfluorescein; EIPA, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride.1The abbreviations used are: AA, arachidonic acid; 1,25(OH)2D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5-(6)- carboxyfluorescein; EIPA, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride. regulates H+channel activity in neutrophils (21Henderson L.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4736-4745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection studies demonstrating heterologous expression of gp91 phox have indicated that gp91 phox or its N-terminal membrane-spanning domain (residues 1–230) also constitutes an AA-activated H+ channel (24Henderson L.M. Banting G. Chappell J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5909-5916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 25Henderson L.M. Thomas S. Banting G. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The histidine 115 was found to be an amino acid important to the ability of gp91 phoxto function as the NADPH oxidase-associated H+ channel (26Henderson L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33216-33223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). All of these in vitro studies suggest a role for AA in the regulation of H+ channel activity. However, the role of AA in a physiological system and the type of phospholipase A2 responsible for its release have not as yet been defined. Furthermore, the effect of AA in these studies is not specific, since, apart from AA, a variety of unsaturated fatty acids has been shown to significantly activate a proton conductance in both macrophages (23Kapus A. Romanek R. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4736-4745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and neutrophil cytoplasts (21Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We previously established a model of cytosolic phospholipase A2-deficient differentiated PLB-985 cells and demonstrated that cPLA2-generated arachidonic acid is essential, by an unknown mechanism, for the activation of NADPH oxidase (27Dana R. Leto T. Malech H. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The model of differentiated PLB-D cells offers a unique tool to determine the physiological role of cPLA2 and of its metabolite AA in regulation of the various phagocytic functions. In the present study, this model was used to determine whether the H+ channel is regulated by cPLA2 and whether this channel is involved in the regulation of NADPH oxidase activity. In addition, the role of cPLA2 in the regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger was investigated. PLB-985 cells and selected PLB-D clones were grown in a stationary suspension culture in RPMI 1640 medium as described earlier (27Dana R. Leto T. Malech H. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The results presented were found in seven individual clones. Optimal concentrations of 1.25% Me2SO or 5 × 10−8m 1,25(OH)2D3were added to PLB cells or PLB-D cells (2 × 105cells/ml) at their logarithmic growth phase to induce differentiation toward granulocyte- or monocyte-like cells, respectively. Differentiation was induced for 4 days and determined by Mac-1 antigen expression detected by indirect immunofluorescence as described previously (28Hazav P. Shany S. Moran A. Levy R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 72-75PubMed Google Scholar). Me2SO was chosen in the present study instead of retinoic acid to induce differentiation toward the granulocyte lineage (27Dana R. Leto T. Malech H. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). PLB cells or PLB-D cells treated for 4 days with Me2SO exhibited 85 ± 7 and 86 ± 8% differentiation, respectively. The expression of the cytosolic and membrane oxidase components was similar in both types of differentiated cells. Differentiated PLB cells produced 14.53 ± 2.8 nmol of O2/106 cells/min upon the addition of 50 ng/ml PMA. In contrast, superoxide production could not be stimulated in differentiated PLB-D cells with the addition of 50 ng/ml PMA. The addition of 10 μm AA to PMA-stimulated differentiated PLB-D cells restored this activity as shown in our previous study in PLB-D differentiated with 1,25(OH)2D3 (27Dana R. Leto T. Malech H. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Granulocytes were purified by Ficoll/Hypaque centrifugation, dextran sedimentation, and hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes (29English D. Andersen B.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1974; 5: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 107) were loaded with 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5-(6)- carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) (3 μg/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C. 1 × 107 cells were suspended in 3 ml of Na+medium (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml PMA, and the changes in pHi were recorded. H+ channel activity was monitored by recording changes in pHi under conditions where the contribution of other H+ translocating systems and major acidifying mechanisms were shown to be eliminated (11Nanda A. Grinstein S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10816-10820Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Kapus A. Szaszi K. Ligeti E. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, pHi was monitored in cells (1 × 107) suspended in 3 ml of KCl-based Na+ and HCO3−-free medium (145 mmKCl, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5), thus excluding the involvement of Na+/H+ and Cl−/HCO3− antiporters. Bafilomycin (100 μm) was applied to inhibit the vacuolar type H+-ATPase, and diphenylene iodonium (3 μm) to block H+ generation by the NADPH oxidase (30O'Donnell B.V. Tew D.G. Jones O.T. England P.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Formation of a diffusion potential that might limit the free permeation of protons through the channel was prevented by the addition of the K+ ionophore valinomycin (1.5 μm). In order to generate an outward proton motive force, the K+ medium was titrated to pH 7.5 by the addition of KOH. For acid loading, cells were preincubated in Na+ buffer containing 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min (NH4Cl prepulse technique (31Boron W.F. J. Membr. Biol. 1983; 72: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar)). After removal of NH4Cl, cells were suspended inN-methyl-d-glucammonium+-rich solution; the resultant pHi was ∼6.2. Upon the addition of 20 mm Na+ to the medium, recovery of pHioccurred rapidly, ostensibly through Na+/H+exchange that was shown to be significantly inhibited by 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA), a specific Na+/H+ antiporter inhibitor (results not shown). Calibration of the BCECF fluorescence was done as described previously (28Hazav P. Shany S. Moran A. Levy R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 72-75PubMed Google Scholar, 32Grinstein S. Cohen S. Rothstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1984; 83: 341-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Fluorescence, indicating changes in internal pH (pHi), was monitored by a Perkin-Elmer LS50 B luminescence spectrometer with wavelengths of 485 and 540 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. The production of superoxide anion (O⨪2) by intact cells was measured as the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c as described earlier (27Dana R. Leto T. Malech H. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This set of experiments was performed in order to determine whether PMA induces a change in pHi in differentiated PLB-985 cells similar to that observed in human neutrophils. In all of the experiments, both the parent PLB-985 cell line and the G418-resistant clones transfected with the empty pcDNA3 vector were used as controls. Since no changes were obtained between the two controls, for simplicity we present the results of the clones transfected with the empty pcDNA3 vector only (PLB cells). PLB cells were differentiated toward granulocyte- or monocyte-like cells by 1.25% Me2SO or 5 × 10−8m1,25(OH)2D3, respectively. The cells loaded with BCECF were suspended in a Na+ medium and then stimulated with PMA (50 ng/ml). In agreement with earlier observations (10Grinstein S. Furuya W. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: C55-C65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Grinstein S. Elder B. Furuya W. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: C379-C386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), peripheral blood neutrophils activated with PMA exhibited a triphasic change in pHi (Fig. 1A). An initial rapid acidification of 0.1 pH units due to the activation of NADPH oxidase was followed by a recovery toward normal pHi mediated by both the H+ channel and the Na+/H+antiporter. This was followed by a slow and variable acidification phase. Both in granulocyte-like PLB cells (Fig. 1B) and in monocyte-like PLB cells (Fig. 1C), the addition of PMA induced a pattern of pHi changes similar to that observed in neutrophils. There were slight differences, first, in the magnitude of the rapid acidification phase, which is more significant in neutrophils than in differentiated PLB cells, and second, differentiated PLB cells exhibited a higher alkalization than that induced in neutrophils. These two phenomena reflect the significantly higher PMA-stimulated NADPH oxidase activity in peripheral blood neutrophils generating 32 ± 4.5 nmol of O2/106 cells/min compared with granulocyte-like PLB cells or monocyte-like PLB cells producing 14.53 ± 2.8 and 10.85 ± 3.3 nmol of O2/106 cells/min, respectively (the results are the mean ± S.E. from 10 different experiments). These changes in pHi induced by PMA in differentiated PLB cells indicate that these cells are an appropriate model for studying the role of cPLA2 in the regulation of proton transport and whether these transporters affect oxidase activity in phagocytes. pHi changes were then studied in differentiated PLB-D cells. These cells fail to activate NADPH oxidase due to the absence of cPLA2, as described previously (27Dana R. Leto T. Malech H. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Thus, no metabolic acidification is expected to trigger the alkalization phase. Both the H+ channel and the Na+/H+antiporter were shown to be either indirectly stimulated by metabolic cytoplasmic acidification or directly activated by the phorbol ester in neutrophils (34Grinstein S. Furuya W. Biggar W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 512-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); thus, the direct effect of PMA on these transporters was studied in differentiated PLB-D cells. The addition of 50 ng/ml PMA to PLB-D cells differentiated with Me2SO (Fig. 1D) or with 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 1E) induced a pHi alkalization that was significantly lower (p < 0.001) than that observed in differentiated control PLB cells. In addition, the metabolic acidification phase prior to alkalization was not observed in PMA-stimulated differentiated PLB-D cells as expected due to the absence of oxidase activation. The typical changes in pHidetected in differentiated PLB cells, both the acidification phase and a higher alkalization, could be restored in PMA-stimulated differentiated PLB-D cells by the addition of exogenous AA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, F and G). The restoration process by exogenous AA is identical to the dose-dependent effect of AA for restoring NADPH oxidase activity, as shown in our previous study (27Dana R. Leto T. Malech H. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The acidification induced by AA in the PMA-stimulated cells is probably due to oxidase activity. The lower alkalization phase in differentiated PLB-D cells stimulated with PMA suggests that one of the H+ efflux transporters does not operate in the absence of cPLA2 and that its activity is restored by addition of AA. Since cells differentiated to the granulocyte lineage by Me2SO and cells differentiated to the monocyte lineage by 1,25(OH)2D3 showed similar results, the results from here onward are shown only for cells differentiated with Me2SO. The gp91 phox, which constitutes an AA-activated H+ channel (24Henderson L.M. Banting G. Chappell J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5909-5916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), is found in minute quantities in undifferentiated HL-60 cells or PLB cells and is induced during differentiation (35Qu A.Y. Nanda A. Curnutte J.T. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1263-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Levy R. Rotrosen D. Nagauker O. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1037-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether cPLA2 has a role in regulating H+ channel activity, the normal development of the H+ channel during differentiation of PLB-D cells first had to be established. An outward acting pH gradient was imposed on cells in K+ medium in the presence of valinomycin (1.5 μm) and Tris (pHo = 8.2) (as described previously (24Henderson L.M. Banting G. Chappell J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5909-5916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar)). Fig. 2 demonstrates that the H+channel is similarly activated by the addition of AA in differentiated PLB cells and in differentiated PLB-D cells, indicating that it develops and operates normally in differentiated PLB-D cells. H+ channel activity was not induced by the addition of AA in undifferentiated PLB cells (data not shown) as demonstrated for undifferentiated HL-60 cells (24Henderson L.M. Banting G. Chappell J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5909-5916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The next step was to study whether cPLA2 is involved in the signaling leading to H+ channel activation. The addition of PMA triggered a substantial cytoplasmic alkalization in differentiated PLB cells (Fig. 3A) similar to that induced in peripheral blood neutrophils (Fig. 3B and Ref. 19Kapus A. Szaszi K. Ligeti E. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), indicating a H+ efflux. Alkalization was prevented in the presence of the H+ channel inhibitor, Zn2+ (50 μm), further confirming that H+ movements take place through the heavy metal-sensitive H+ channel. In differentiated PLB-D cells, PMA did not induce any cytoplasmic alkalization (Fig. 3C), but H+ channel activity could be restored by the addition of exogenous AA to PMA-stimulated or -nonstimulated cells (Fig. 3D). These results clearly indicate that cPLA2-generated AA is essential for the activation of the H+ channel in differentiated PLB-D cells. Previous publications, utilizing the PLA2 inhibitorp-bromophenacyl bromide (38Kapus A. Susztak K. Ligeti E. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and the newly developed selective blocker of cPLA2, trifluoromethyl ketone analogue of arachidonic acid (AACOCF3) (22Susztak K. Mocsai A. Ligeti E. Kapus A. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), have proposed that cPLA2 has a possible role in regulation of the electrogenic H+ channel in the plasma membrane of neutrophils. Differentiated PLB-D cells fail to activate both the NADPH oxidase (27Dana R. Leto T. Malech H. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and the H+ channel (Fig. 3C) upon stimulation. As demonstrated in Fig. 3D, the addition of AA restored H+ channel activity in differentiated PLB-D cells in the presence of the oxidase inhibitor, diphenylene iodonium, indicating that oxidase activity is not a prerequisite for activation of this channel. In order to determine the potential role of the H+ channel in promoting or maintaining NADPH oxidase activity, the effect of the H+channel inhibitor, Zn2+, was studied. As shown in Fig. 4A, the presence of 50 μm Zn2+ prevented alkalization induced by PMA in granulocyte-like PLB cells suspended in a Na+ medium. The absolute inhibition of H+ channel activity by 50 μm Zn2+ in stimulated granulocyte-like PLB cells suspended in a K+ medium is demonstrated in Fig. 3A. The presence of 50 μm Zn2+significantly inhibited the production of superoxide stimulated with PMA in either Na+ or K+ medium, retaining about 40% of the activity (Fig. 4B). Since H+ channel activity was assayed in the presence of valinomycin (Fig. 3), the effect of Zn2+ on superoxide production was studied also in its presence. The addition of valinomycin accelerated the inhibition of superoxide production in differentiated PLB cells, reaching about 75% inhibition (Fig. 4B) in agreement with earlier data on neutrophil cytoplasts (39Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Jones O.T. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 285-290PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest the involvement of the H+ channel in the regulation of NADPH oxidase activity, similar to earlier studies in neutrophil cytoplasts (39Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Jones O.T. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 285-290PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the inability of stimulated differentiated PLB-D cells to activate NADPH oxidase may account, in part, for the failure in activating the H+ channel in these cells. The partial inhibition of superoxide production under conditions in which absolute inhibition of the H+ channel was induced suggests that the AA-activable H+ channel is not the sole mechanism regulating oxidase activity. AA, which caused complete activation of oxidase activity, probably acts at other sites on the oxidase in addition to its effect on the H+ channel. The Na+/H+ exchanger has been shown to be expressed and active in human neutrophils, HL-60 cells, and PLB cells (37Fukushima T. Waddell T.K. Grinstein S. Goss G.G. Orlowski J. Downey G.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1037-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To determine the normal development of the Na+/H+ antiporter during differentiation of PLB-D cells, Na+/H+ exchange activity was determined by their ability to recover from an acid load. Cells were acid-loaded using the NH4Cl prepulse technique (40Pouyssegur J. Sardet C. Franchi A. L'Allemain G. Paris S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4833-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 5, Na+/H+ exchange activity was similar in control differentiated PLB cells and differentiated PLB-D cells, implying normal development and activity of the Na+/H+antiporter during differentiation of PLB-D cells. We then studied the involvement of cPLA2 in the signaling leading to activation of the Na+/H+ antiporter. Stimulation of this antiporter is performed in a Na+ medium as described in Fig. 1. As shown in this figure, alkalization induced by PMA in differentiated PLB-D cells (Fig. 1D) is significantly lower than that observed in differentiated PLB cells (Fig. 1, B and C). Since the H+channel does not operate in differentiated PLB-D cells as demonstrated in Fig. 3, it is likely that the alkalization stimulated by PMA in these cells is mediated by the Na+/H+antiporter only. To further demonstrate this point, we studied the effect of the specific inhibitors for both H+ transporters. As shown in Fig. 6, stimulation of differentiated PLB-D cells in the presence of the H+channel inhibitor, Zn2+, resulted in an alkalization identical to that observed in the absence of Zn2+, while the presence of the Na+/H+ antiporter inhibitor, EIPA, totally inhibited the alkalization. These results indicate that alkalization induced in stimulated differentiated PLB-D cells is mediated by the Na+/H+ antiporter and, furthermore, that cPLA2 does not participate in regulation of Na+/H+ exchange activity. Alkalization following PMA stimulation under conditions in which the NADPH oxidase does not function was observed in neutrophils of patients with chronic granulomatous disease (20Nanda A. Grinstein S. Curnutte J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 34Grinstein S. Furuya W. Biggar W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 512-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the differentiated PLB-D cell model, in chronic granulomatous disease neutrophils, both Na+/H+ antiporter and H+ channel activities operate and contribute to the efflux of H+, resulting in higher alkalization induced by PMA. To determine whether the Na+/H+ antiporter has a role in regulating the NADPH oxidase, by a mechanism which does not involve cPLA2, the effect of EIPA on NADPH oxidase activity was studied. Stimulation of granulocyte-like PLB cells with PMA in the presence of EIPA resulted in a dramatic drop in pHi due to an uncompensated accumulation of protons within the cytoplasm (Fig. 7A). These data, similar to previously published data (34Grinstein S. Furuya W. Biggar W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 512-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Grinstein S. Mack E. Mills G.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), indicates that the Na+/H+ antiporter has a major role in regulating pHi. However, the presence of EIPA in PMA-stimulated granulocyte-like PLB cells does not have any effect on NADPH oxidase superoxide generation (Fig. 7B), indicating that the Na+/H+ antiporter has no role in the regulation of the NADPH oxidase. This is in agreement with previous results demonstrating that EIPA and other amiloride derivatives do not affect superoxide generation in neutrophils (42Gewirtz A.T. Seetoo K.F. Simons E.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), murine peritoneal macrophages (43Swallow C.J. Grinstein S. Sudsbury R.A. Rotstein O.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and rat alveolar macrophages (44Murphy J.K. Forman H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L523-L532PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, the development of a differentiated PLB-D cell model that lacks any cPLA2 expression offers a unique tool for determining the physiological role of cPLA2 in the signal transduction pathway leading to H+ channel activation. The present study demonstrates that cPLA2 and its enzymatic production of AA are an essential requirement for H+channel activation. Stimulation of differentiated PLB-D cells did not induce activation of H+ channel, but the addition of exogenous AA fully restored this activity. The present study clearly demonstrates that cPLA2 specifically regulates the H+ channel and is not involved in the activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger. The similar restoration patterns of H+ channel activity (Fig. 2D) and of NADPH oxidase activity (27Dana R. Leto T. Malech H. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) by AA in differentiated PLB-D cells supports the presence of a tight coupling between these two processes. The significant inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity by the H+ channel inhibitor, Zn2+, suggests that the H+ channel participates in the regulation of NADPH oxidase activity. The exact mechanism by which AA activates the H+channel and the NADPH oxidase and its precise site of action still remain to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W1982270136,"AML2 is a member of the acute myelogenous leukemia, AML family of transcription factors. The biologic functions of AML1 and AML3 have been well characterized; however, the functional role of AML2 remains unknown. In this study, we found that AML2 protein expressed predominantly in cells of hematopoietic origin is a nuclear serine phosphoprotein associated with the nuclear matrix, and its expression is not cell cycle-related. In HL-60 cells AML2 expression can be induced by all three natural retinoids, all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), 13-cis-RA, and 9-cis-RA in a dose-dependent manner. A synthetic retinoic acid derivative, 4HPR, which neither activates RA receptor (RAR) α nor retinoic X receptor α was unable to induce the expression of AML2. A RAR-selective activator, TTNPB, induced AML2 expression similar to RA. Our study further showed that AGN193109, a potent RARα antagonist, suppressed AML2 expression induced by RA and that a retinoic X receptor pan agonist AGN194204 had no effect on its expression. Taken together, these studies conclusively demonstrated that the expression of AML2 in HL-60 cells is regulated through the RARα-specific signaling pathway. Our study further showed that after all-trans-retinoic acid priming, AML2 expression could be augmented by vitamin D3. Based on these studies we hypothesize that AML2 expression is normally regulated by retinoid/vitamin D nuclear receptors mainly through the RARα-dependent signaling pathway and that it may play a role in hematopoietic cell differentiation."

Rapid-freeze EPR and stopped-flow were used to characterize tyrosyl radical kinetics in PGHS-1 and -2 reacted with ethyl hydrogen peroxide. In PGHS-1, a wide doublet tyrosyl radical (34–35 G) was formed by 4 ms, followed by transition to a wide singlet (33–34 G); changes in total radical intensity paralleled those of Intermediate II absorbance during both formation and decay phases. In PGHS-2, some wide doublet (30 G) was present at early time points, but transition to wide singlet (29 G) was complete by 50 ms. In contrast to PGHS-1, only the formation kinetics of the PGHS-2 tyrosyl radical matched the Intermediate II absorbance kinetics. Indomethacin-treated PGHS-1 and nimesulide-treated PGHS-2 rapidly formed narrow singlet EPR (25–26 G in PGHS-1; 21 G in PGHS-2), and the same line shapes persisted throughout the reactions. Radical intensity paralleled Intermediate II absorbance throughout the indomethacin-treated PGHS-1 reaction. For nimesulide-treated PGHS-2, radical formed in concert with Intermediate II, but later persisted while Intermediate II relaxed. These results substantiate the kinetic competence of a tyrosyl radical as the catalytic intermediate for both PGHS isoforms and also indicate that the heme redox state becomes uncoupled from the tyrosyl radical in PGHS-2.

There are two isoforms of PGHS, with the constitutive form (PGHS-1) ascribed housekeeping functions and the inducible form (PGHS-2) associated with cytokine-mediated pathophysiological events (1Smith W.L.

Although the isoforms share only 60% sequence identity, their overall three-dimensional structures are very similar, especially in the catalytic sites (3Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M.

Both isoforms exhibit two enzymatic activities: a cyclooxygenase activity, which converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2, and a peroxidase activity, which transforms prostaglandin G2 to prostaglandin H2. Several oxidized reaction intermediates have been identified (6Lambeir A.M. Markey C.M. Dunford H.B. Marnett L.J. J. Biol.

As indicated in Scheme FS1, PGHS first interacts with a peroxide substrate, such as prostaglandin G2, to generate Intermediate I, equivalent to Compound I of horseradish peroxidase. Intermediate I then converts to Intermediate II, equivalent to complex ES of cytochrome c peroxidase, through an intramolecular electron transfer from a tyrosine residue to the oxidized porphyrin. The transient tyrosyl radical in Intermediate II in each PGHS isoform is capable of oxidizing arachidonic acid to generate an arachidonic acid radical and initiate cyclooxygenase catalysis (10Tsai A.

Crystallographic data revealed that the presumed site of the tyrosyl radical, Tyr-385 in PGHS-1 (Tyr-371 in PGHS-2), is located between the heme and arachidonate binding sites, well positioned to couple the two enzyme activities (3Picot D.

Although the chemical competence of the tyrosyl radical for cyclooxygenase catalysis has been convincingly demonstrated by single-turnover experiments (10Tsai A. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10503-10508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 11Tsai A. Palmer G. Xiao G. Swinney D.C. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol.

Palmer G. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17753-17759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the relationship between tyrosyl radical kinetics and those of the rapid changes in the heme redox state during PGHS peroxidase reactions remained unresolved. The redox linkage between the heme center and the tyrosyl radical needs to be defined to determine the coupling efficiency between the two enzyme activities. Several types of tyrosyl radical EPR spectra have been observed in the PGHS isozymes (Refs. 7Karthein R. Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J.

A 33–35-G wide doublet (WD1) and wide singlet (WS1) are observed when PGHS-1 is manually mixed with various hydroperoxides (12Kulmacz R.J. Ren Y. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8760-8771Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). On the other hand, only a 29-G wide singlet (WS2) is found in PGHS-2 for similar manually mixed peroxidase reactions (16Xiao G. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Boyar W.C. Marshall P.J. Kulmacz R.J.

It was of interest to know whether the lack of observable WD in PGHS-2 was the result of a fundamentally different tyrosyl radical structure in this isoform or of a more rapid transition to a wide singlet. The peroxidase reaction in PGHS-1 treated with cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as aspirin, indomethacin, and flurbiprofen or with the mutation of Tyr-385 to phenylalanine resulted in the formation of a 25–26-G narrow singlet (NS1a) (12Kulmacz R.J.

These observations of a perturbed tyrosyl radical EPR in PGHS-1 and -2 with impaired cyclooxygenase activity were from manually mixed samples.

Parallel stopped-flow measurements were done to determine the kinetics of Intermediate I and II formation. The results indicate that very rapid formation of WD species coincides with formation of Intermediate II in both PGHS-1 and -2, consistent with the proposed mechanism (Ref. 7Karthein R. Dietz R.

Phenol, indomethacin, flurbiprofen, nimesulide, and hemin were purchased from Sigma. EtOOH was purchased as a 5% aqueous solution from Polysciences Inc. (Warrington, PA) or from Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp. (Westbury, NY) as a 10% solution. EtOOH concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 230 nm using an extinction coefficient of 43 m−1cm−1. Tween 20 was purchased from Pierce. PGHS-1 was prepared as the apoenzyme from ram seminal vesicles, with 5 mm glutathione included in the isoelectric focusing step (9Tsai A. Wei C. Baek H.K. Kulmacz R.J. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol.

Recombinant human PGHS-2 was expressed in a baculovirus system using Sf9 or High Five (Invitrogen) insect cells and purified as described previously (21Kulmacz R.J. Wang L.-H. J. Biol.

PGHS holoenzymes were formed by adding excess heme to the apoenzyme followed by treatment with DE52 cellulose (Whatman) and gel filtration on a Bio-Rad 10-DG column (for PGHS-1) or gel filtration alone (for PGHS-2). A minimal amount of phenol (50 μm) was added to PGHS-2 during reconstitution to avoid loss of activity. The concentration of PGHS holoenzyme was based on the absorbance at 411 nm for PGHS-1 and at 408 nm for PGHS-2 (165 mm−1 cm−1). The cyclooxygenase specific activity, assayed polarographically at 30 °C (20Kulmacz R.J. Lands W.E.M. Benedetto C. McDonald-Gibson R.G. Nigam S. Slater T.F.

Optical stopped-flow kinetic measurements were conducted using a Bio-SEQUENTIAL DX-18MV stopped-flow instrument (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). Wavelength pairs of 428 and 524 nm (isosbestic points between resting PGHS-1 and Intermediate I (8Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J.

In the case of PGHS-2, the large value ofk2 (conversion of Intermediate I to Intermediate II) resulted in a minimal accumulation of Intermediate I, and so there was hardly any observable accumulation of Intermediate I (26Lu G.

We thus chose to monitor Intermediate II kinetics in PGHS-2 at 406 and 428 nm. Rapid-freeze experiments were conducted using a System 1000 chemical/freeze quench apparatus with a Model 1019 syringe ram, a Model 715 ram controller, and an 0.008-in nozzle (Update Instrument, Inc. Madison, WI). A low temperature isopentane bath was used for pre-chilling the packing assembly containing isopentane and later for cooling during sample packing via a pressure filtration process developed recently in our laboratory (19Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Kulmacz R.J. Wu G. Palmer G. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 264: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The bath temperature was kept at 125–130 K, bringing the temperature of isopentane inside the funnel to 130–135 K. The temperatures were monitored with a silicon diode temperature sensor (Lakeshore model 200 monitor with a DT-471-PA1 probe). Unless otherwise mentioned, the ram velocity was 2 cm/s in all rapid-mixing experiments. Single-push mixing was used for reactions of less than 160 ms; longer reactions used a push-push mixing syringe program. The dead time of the apparatus, measured with myoglobin-azide reactions, is 4–5 ms (19Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Kulmacz R.J. Wu G. Palmer G. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 264: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). EPR spectra of samples collected from rapid-freeze experiments were recorded with a Varian E-6 spectrometer. The EPR conditions were as follows: modulation amplitude, 3.2 G; time constant, 1 s; power 1 mW; and temperature, 96 K. Radical concentrations were determined by double integration of the EPR signal using a copper standard (12Kulmacz R.J. Ren Y. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8760-8771Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and a packing correction factor of 0.45 determined earlier for this system (19Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Kulmacz R.J. Wu G. Palmer G. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 264: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To observe the earliest possible events in tyrosyl radical formation, we reacted PGHS-1 with two equivalents of EtOOH at 0 °C and freeze-trapped the sample at various reaction times. The sample trapped at 4 ms showed a typical wide-doublet tyrosyl radical (WD1) with a peak-to-trough width of 34 G and a well resolved 19-G center splitting (Fig. 1). A sample trapped after 5 s of reaction still showed a doublet spectrum but with some decay of the center splitting. Comparison of the freeze-trapped samples with the wide-doublet EPR predicted from the parameters obtained in electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) measurements 2W. Shi, C. W. Hoganson, M. Espe, C. J. Bender, G. T. Babcock, G. Palmer, R. J. Kulmacz, and A.-L. Tsai, submitted for publication.indicates that the center splitting in the WD1 EPR had already declined by ∼30% at 4 ms (Fig. 1). Increasing the ratio of EtOOH/PGHS-1 to 5 and raising the temperature permitted observation of a more complete transition from WD1 to a wide singlet tyrosyl radical (WS1) (Fig. 2,top). This transition was essentially complete within 50 s. The initial formation of tyrosyl radical was rapid (k = 16 s−1) and reached a plateau at ∼0.6 spin/heme within 300 ms (Fig. 2, bottom). A slow decay in radical intensity (k = 0.047 s−1) began after about 500 ms (Fig. 2, bottom). The kinetics of Intermediate II, monitored atA524, closely tracked those of the tyrosyl radical. The rate of Intermediate II formation was 24 s−1(Fig. 2, bottom). These results indicate a tight redox linkage between the heme center and the tyrosyl radical in PGHS-1. The slight difference in formation rates between tyrosyl radical and Intermediate II probably originates in the different methods used for their measurement, but it might also imply an additional step occurring between formation of Intermediate II and tyrosyl radical. Stopped-flow observations at 428 nm paralleled those at 524 nm in the early phase but showed a more rapid decay (data not shown), indicating that additional events, such as self-inactivation, were also detected at this wavelength (25Wu G. Wei C. Kulmacz R.J. Osawa Y. Tsai A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9231-9237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The EPR spectra of samples trapped at various times during reaction of indomethacin-treated PGHS-1 and EtOOH (5 eq) all showed a 25–26-G narrow singlet (NS1a) with discrete hyperfine features (Fig. 3, top) just as was found earlier in manual mixing experiments (12Kulmacz R.J. Ren Y. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8760-8771Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. Tsai A-L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 833-837PubMed Google Scholar). There was no indication of initial formation of either WD1 or WS1 signals. Formation of the NS1a radical was rapid (k = 47 s−1) and reached a plateau at ∼0.35 spin/heme within 200 ms, followed by a slow relaxation (Fig. 3, bottom). As in the case of PGHS-1 itself, the kinetics of Intermediate II (29 s−1 for the initial phase) paralleled those of the NS1a radical, indicating that binding of indomethacin did not disrupt the redox linkage between the heme and the tyrosyl radical. Separate experiments using flurbiprofen instead of indomethacin gave very similar results for both the tyrosyl radical and Intermediate II kinetics (data not shown). Substantial formation of tyrosyl radicals was evident at the earliest stage (5 ms) of reaction of PGHS-2 with 5 eq of EtOOH (Fig. 4,top). The EPR spectrum of the initial sample exhibited a complex, 29–30-G wide signal with a clearly discernible splitting, whereas the spectrum of the sample at 50 ms was essentially a simple singlet (WS2), indicating a very rapid transition from doublet to singlet in PGHS-2. Subtraction of 75% of the signal intensity of the 50-ms sample from the 5-ms sample EPR yielded a doublet with a peak-to-trough width of 30 G (Fig. 4, top), indicating the presence of a substantial wide doublet tyrosyl radical in the very early stages of the PGHS-2 peroxidase reaction. The formation of tyrosyl radical in PGHS-2 was rapid (∼140 s−1). The radical intensity reached a plateau near 0.8 spin/heme by ∼50 ms and remained at this level for at least 100 ms (Fig. 4). Formation of Intermediate II, monitored by absorbance changes at 406 or 428 nm, was also rapid (∼240 s−1). In contrast to the persistent radical intensity, Intermediate II quickly relaxed back to the ferric heme (17–19 s−1). This difference in behavior between the heme center redox state and the tyrosyl radical was observed for PGHS-2 but not PGHS-1 (compare Figs. 2 and Fig. 4). The PGHS-2 preparation used above included 50 μm phenol as a protectant, and therefore the possible effect of phenol on the PGHS-1 tyrosyl radical and Intermediate II kinetics was examined. In the presence of phenol the rates of tyrosyl radical and Intermediate II formation (18 and 26 s−1, respectively) were similar to those for phenol-free PGHS-1 reactions (Figs. 2 and 5). The maximal tyrosyl radical intensity in the presence of phenol was ∼0.4 spin/heme, somewhat less than in the experiment done without phenol (Figs. 2 and 5). The presence of phenol resulted in a slower transition from WD1 to WS1, evident from the center inflection present in the EPR even after 330 ms (Fig. 5,top). This finding contrasts with the almost complete collapse of the center splitting pattern in the phenol-free PGHS-1 reactions (Fig. 2, top). A comparison of the PGHS-1 and -2 results in the presence of phenol indicated that the transition from wide doublet to wide singlet and the relaxation of Intermediate II were both slower in PGHS-1 (Figs. 4 and 5). Reaction of nimesulide-treated PGHS-2 with 5 eq of EtOOH resulted in rapid formation of both the tyrosyl radical (176 s−1) and Intermediate II (∼ 350 s−1 fromA428 observations) (Fig. 6). Intermediate II later decayed at a rate of 33 s−1 even though the tyrosyl radical intensity remained relatively constant (Fig. 6, bottom). The divergent decay kinetics of oxidized heme and tyrosyl radical were thus seen with both inhibitor-treated and native PGHS-2 (Figs. 4 and 6). The maximal intensity of the tyrosyl radical achieved in nimesulide-treated PGHS-2, ∼0.4 spin/heme, was substantially lower than that found for PGHS-2 itself. EPR of samples collected throughout the reaction showed only the 21-G narrow singlet (NS2a), with no significant change in line shape (Fig. 6). There was no sign of earlier formation of either a wide doublet or wide singlet, a situation similar to that with indomethacin-treated PGHS-1 (Figs. 3 and 6). The rapid formation of WD and WS tyrosyl radicals observed in both PGHS-1 and -2 parallels the formation of the oxyferryl heme species (Intermediate II). This finding is just as predicted by the branched-chain radical mechanism originally proposed by Ruf and colleagues (7Karthein R. Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 8Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The kinetic competence of the tyrosyl radical for the proposed coupling of the peroxidase and cyclooxygenase activities in both of the PGHS isoforms is thus firmly established. We previously examined the time-dependent changes of tyrosyl radical concentration and EPR line shape on a time scale of seconds using manual mixing at lower temperatures (-10 to 0 °C) (12Kulmacz R.J. Ren Y. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8760-8771Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar,13Tsai A. Palmer G. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol.

The slower kinetics observed in these earlier experiments probably reflects a previously unsuspected inefficiency in mixing the enzyme and peroxide in the narrow EPR tube by agitation with a nichrome wire loop. Earlier results from single-turnover experiments firmly established the chemical competence of the tyrosyl radical to oxidize arachidonic acid to a fatty acid radical (10Tsai A. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10503-10508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 11Tsai A. Palmer G. Xiao G. Swinney D.C. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol.

It is clear from the present kinetic results that tyrosyl radicals in both of the PGHS isoforms are formed very rapidly, in concert with heme redox changes, just as expected from the proposed mechanism (Scheme FS1). This result provides strong support for the mechanism and indicates that it accurately describes the events leading from the reaction with peroxide to the initiation of cyclooxygenase catalysis in both PGHS-1 and -2. The present results also make it clear that a wide doublet tyrosyl radical (WD2) species is formed early in the reaction of peroxide with PGHS-2 just as with PGHS-1. The initial wide doublet undergoes a transition to a wide singlet in both isozymes, with a much faster rate for the transition in PGHS-2. Our ENDOR studies2 support earlier reports (14Lassmann G. Odenwaller R. Curtis J.F. DeGray J.A. Mason R.P. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20045-20055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15DeGray J.A. Lassmann G. Curtis J.F. Kennedy T.A. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23583-23588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the WS1 of PGHS-1 is not a distinct species but is rather a mixture of the WD1 and a narrow-singlet (NS1b) associated with self-inactivated enzyme (13Tsai A. Palmer G. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17753-17759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This singlet is roughly similar to that seen with PGHS inhibited by anti-cyclooxygenase agents (NS1a) but lacks the latter's detailed hyperfine features (13Tsai A. Palmer G. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17753-17759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conditions that decrease PGHS-1 self-inactivation, such as decreasing the amount of EtOOH (Fig. 1) or including a reducing co-substrate (Fig. 5), significantly slowed the transition from WD to WS, consistent with the assignment of the NS1b signal to a tyrosyl radical in self-inactivated PGHS-1. The structural interpretation for the WS observed in PGHS-2 (WS2) is ambiguous despite the general EPR similarities with the WS1 in PGHS-1. Definitive ENDOR data are not available for any of the PGHS-2 radical species. The narrower EPR line width of WS2 than of WS1 allows simulation of WS2 by simply increasing the dihedral angle between thepz orbital of C1 and the C–H bond at the β carbon, corresponding to a change in coupling constant from 21 to 14 G for the β proton (16Xiao G. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Boyar W.C. Marshall P.J. Kulmacz R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1836-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This interpretation is consistent with WS2 arising from a distinct structural entity. However, it remains possible that WS2 is a mixture of a wide doublet and a narrow singlet, similar to WS1 in PGHS-1. ENDOR analysis of WS2 will be needed to decide between these two alternative structural interpretations and to understand the basis for the WD → WS transition observed in PGHS-2 (Fig. 4). The present rapid-freeze EPR measurements did not detect formation of either WD or WS signals, even in the earliest stages of the peroxidase reaction, in either indomethacin-PGHS-1 or nimesulide-PGHS-2 (Figs. 3and 6). This clear difference with the native isoforms strongly suggests that inhibitor treatment changes the pathway of intramolecular electron transfer in Compound I, resulting in oxidation of a surrogate tyrosine (exhibiting NS1a or NS2a EPR) rather than Tyr-385 (Tyr-371 in PGHS-2) during electron transfer to the heme porphyrin radical, as we previously proposed (18Tsai A. Hsi L.C. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5085-5091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The identity of this surrogate tyrosine residue is not known for either of the PGHS isoforms, although the similarity in power saturation between the NS1a and WD1 signals (12Kulmacz R.J. Ren Y. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8760-8771Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and between the NS2a and WS2 signals (16Xiao G. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Boyar W.C. Marshall P.J. Kulmacz R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1836-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) indicates similar environments for radicals on the surrogate tyrosine and on Tyr-385/Tyr-371. The present kinetic data have revealed unexpected differences between the two isozymes in the redox association between the heme center and the tyrosyl radical (Figs. 2 and 4). Although formation of Intermediate II heme paralleled formation of tyrosyl radicals in both isozymes, the rate for PGHS-2 was faster than for PGHS-1. The faster rate of Intermediate II/tyrosyl radical formation for PGHS-2 fits with our recent comparative kinetic studies of these two isozymes, which showed PGHS-2 to have a much faster conversion from Intermediate I to II (26Lu G. Tsai A.-L. Van Wart H.E. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16162-16167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the redox relaxation of the tyrosyl radical and the heme center parallel one another in PGHS-1 but diverge markedly in PGHS-2 (Figs. 2 and 4). A similar difference was observed with the NS radicals in PGHS-1 and -2 treated with inhibitors (Figs. 3 and 6), with the redox relaxation of the tyrosyl radical and the heme center paralleling one another in PGHS-1 but diverging markedly in PGHS-2 (Fig. 2 and 4). This uncoupling of the tyrosyl radical redox state from the heme redox state in PGHS-2 may be physiologically significant because it tends to prolong the lifetime of the catalytically active tyrosyl radical and thus better sustain propagation of cyclooxygenase activity. This difference in redox coupling between oxyferryl heme and the tyrosyl radical in the two isoforms may contribute to the greater efficiency of hydroperoxide activation in PGHS-2 than in PGHS-1 (21Kulmacz R.J. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24019-24023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar).

Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although many of the individual components of the TCR-linked signaling pathway are physically separated in resting cells, upon engagement of the receptor, they reassemble into functional complexes at the site of contact with major histocompatibility complex-presenting peptide antigen on the surface of the antigen-presenting cells (3Monks C.R.F. Freiberg B.A. Kupfer H. Sciaky N. Kupfer A. Nature. 1998; 395: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1973) Google Scholar). The reassembly process directs enzymes, their corresponding substrates, and additional effector molecules to the receptor site, in a temporally and spatially regulated manner, which ensures an efficient signaling leading to cell activation. The same mechanism ensures that the level of signaling in unstimulated cells remains below the critical threshold required for cell activation. The earliest detectable biochemical event in activated T cells is the phosphorylation of multiple protein substrates on tyrosine residues. Therefore, protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) that mediate this activity play a critical role in the early phases of the activation response by up-regulating critical enzymes and promoting the assembly of the multimolecular complexes. Non-receptor PTKs that mediate these functions in T cells include the Src family members, Lck and Fyn, and the Syk family members, ZAP-70 and Syk (1Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar, 2Isakov N. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A fraction of Fyn and Lck, which are constitutively associated with the TCR and CD4/CD8 cytoplasmic tails, respectively, appears to phosphorylate critical tyrosine residues within the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) on distinct TCR subunits (4Isakov N. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 69: 183-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ZAP-70 and Syk then recruit to the phosphorylated ITAMs and interact with two phosphotyrosyl residues within an ITAM via their tandem SH2 domains. Only then can ZAP-70 undergo tyrosine phosphorylation and become enzymatically active (5Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G.H. Wang T. Thoma R. Kurosaki T.

The subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of additional cellular substrates, including LAT, phospholipase Cγ1, Vav, SLP-76, Shc, Cbl, and Pyk2, function to couple the receptor to its signaling pathways and regulate the activation response.

To analyze further the involvement of Crk proteins in the early activation events in T lymphocytes, we searched for T cell-derived tyrosyl phosphoproteins that associate with Crk in an activation-dependent manner. In this report, we describe experiments showing that the ZAP-70 PTK interacts with Crk in activated T lymphocytes. We also provide data to establish the mechanism of interaction between the two molecules and determine the activity and subcellular location of the Crk-associated ZAP-70.

A plasmid containing the GST-CrkL was a gift of Dr. B. Druker (Oregon Health Sciences Center, Portland, OR), and plasmids containing GST fused to Crk-I, Crk-II, or individual Crk-II domains were gifts of Dr. M. Matsuda (National Institute of Health, Tokyo, Japan). pGEX plasmids were used to transform E. coli DH5α cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). After induction of protein expression with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Promega, Madison, WI) for 2–4 h, the bacteria were resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and further disrupted by sonication. Following centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 20 min, the induced proteins were adsorbed to immobilized glutathione-agarose. Soluble GST fusion proteins were obtained by elution with 5 mm reduced glutathione (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) in 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0. For in vitro binding assays, bead-adsorbed GST or GST fusion proteins (5 μg/sample) were incubated with cell lysates at 4 °C on a rotator for 1 h. The beads were then washed 3 times in lysis buffer, and bound proteins were either eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by immunoblotting or tested in anin vitro kinase assay. Human leukemic Jurkat T cells, Jurkat-TAg cells which stably express the simian virus 40-derived large T antigen, and Jurkat-derived mutant cell lines, JCaM1 and J4501, that are defective in expression of Lck or CD45, respectively, were maintained at a logarithmic growth phase in complete RPMI (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel), and 5 × 10−5mβ-mercaptoethanol (Sigma)) in 75-cm2 growth-area tissue culture flasks (Cell-Cult, Sterilin Limited, Feltham, UK) in an atmosphere of 7.5% CO2, at 37 °C. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were obtained by histopaque gradient centrifugation of heparinized blood from healthy volunteers. Enriched population of preactivated and rested PBL T cells were obtained by cell culture (1 × 106/ml) in 10% fetal calf serum-containing complete RPMI in the presence of 5 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin in 75-cm2 growth-area tissue culture flasks (50 ml/flask). Human recombinant IL-2 (20 units/ml) was added after 72 h of culture, and cells were maintained in culture for 6 more days by the addition of IL-2 (20 units/ml) once every 2 days. Jurkat or PBL T cells (10 × 106/100 μl) were stimulated with freshly prepared 1% pervanadate (10 mmNa3VO4 containing 1% H2O2) for 30 min at 37 °C. Ab-mediated cross-linking of the TCR/CD3 was performed by incubating Jurkat or PBL T cells (10 × 106/100 μl) with C305 mAb, or OKT3 mAb, respectively, for 10 min on ice. A secondary cross-linking rabbit anti-mouse Ig Ab was then added for 10 min on ice, followed by transfer to 37 °C and incubation for 2 min. The CRK-II cDNA in pcDL-SRα296(BglII) mammalian expression vector (pVCrk-II) was a gift of Dr. Matsuda (42Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). For transfection, the Jurkat-TAg cells were washed three times in supplement-free RPMI 1640, resuspended at 5 × 107 cells per ml in unsupplemented medium, and aliquoted into 0.4-cm-gap Gene Pulser cuvettes (Bio-Rad) (2 × 107 cells/400 μl/cuvette). Plasmid DNA (10 μg/group) was added, and the cells were electroporated using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser (250 volts, 950 microfarads). The cells were then cultured in 13 ml of complete RPMI 1640 in T25 tissue culture flasks for 48 h. Cell lysates were prepared by resuspension of cells in a lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, 2 mm AEBSF, and 1% Triton X-100, followed by a 20-min incubation on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the nuclear free supernatants were mixed with equal volumes of 2× SDS sample buffer, vortexed, incubated at 100 °C for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cytosol and particulate fractions were prepared by resuspending the cells in buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, and 2 mm AEBSF) and repeatedly aspirating them through a 1-ml syringe with a 26-gauge needle for 20 s. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 400 ×g for 5 min; nuclear pellets were removed, and lysates were recentrifuged at 13,000 × g. Supernatants (cytosolic fractions) were transferred to a second set of microcentrifuge tubes, Triton X-100 was added up to a 1% final concentration, and samples were either mixed with 5× SDS sample buffer (4:1, v/v), or used for immunoprecipitation. Pellets were washed once in buffer A, resuspended in buffer A plus 1% Triton X-100 (in the original volume used for the lysis), incubated for 30 min on ice, and centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 20 min. Supernatants (particulate fractions) were either mixed with 5× SDS sample buffer (4:1, v/v) or used for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation was performed by using an optimal dilution of polyclonal antisera or mAbs that were preabsorbed on protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Excess Abs were removed by 3 washes in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and Ab-coated beads were incubated with cell lysates for 2–3 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were precipitated by centrifugation followed by extensive washing in a lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then either fractionated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted or subjected to an in vitrokinase assay. Samples of cell lysates, GST fusion protein, GST fusion protein-bound molecules, or Ab immunoprecipitates were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide gels using Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN II Cell. Proteins in the gels were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma) or blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) at 100 V for 45 min in a Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot transfer cell. After 1 h blocking at 37 °C with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with the indicated primary Abs, followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse, or donkey anti-rabbit, Ig, or with HRP-conjugated protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using an ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and autoradiography. To determine direct interaction of either Crk-II or selected Crk-II domains with the electrophoresed, nitrocellulose-bound proteins, the SDS-PAGE and blotting were performed as described above, followed by blocking of the membranes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with a blocking buffer containing 10 μg/ml of the indicated GST fusion protein, or GST, as a negative control. Bound GST proteins were detected by incubation of the membrane with a mouse anti-GST mAb for 1 h, followed by an HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig and ECL development. ZAP-70 immunoprecipitates or cell lysate proteins adsorbed to immobilized GST fusion protein were washed twice in a lysis buffer followed by an additional wash in a kinase reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF). They were then resuspended in a reaction buffer, with or without 1 μg of CFB3. Kinase reaction, in a total volume of 15 μl, was initiated by the addition of 5 μCi of 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP (at 3000 Ci/mmol) and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Reaction was terminated by the addition of 5× SDS sample buffer (4:1, v/v); samples were vortexed and boiled for 5 min, and phosphoproteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels. Phosphoproteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and visualized by autoradiography by exposure to Kodak XAR-5 x-ray film at −70 °C with an intensifying screen. Adapter proteins that consist of SH2 and SH3 domains play critical roles in the assembly of multimolecular signaling complexes during the early phases of cell activation response. We analyzed the involvement of Crk adapter proteins in the regulation of T cell activation, and because many of the protein-protein interaction events are regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling molecules, we questioned whether Crk proteins interact with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in activated T cells. Lysates of non-activated or pervanadate-stimulated human Jurkat T cells were incubated with bead-immobilized GST-Crk fusion proteins. After separation of the bound proteins by SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transblotted to nitrocellulose membranes, and tyrosyl phosphoproteins were identified using phosphotyrosine-specific mAbs. All three Crk adapter proteins were found to pull down numerous protein bands that reacted with anti-phosphotyrosine (Fig. 1A). One of the observed protein bands, at the range of 70 kDa, corresponded to the molecular mass of ZAP-70 PTK, which is a key enzyme in T cell activation. Stripping and reblotting of the membrane with anti-ZAP-70 Abs indicated that Crk interacted with ZAP-70 (Fig. 1A, 6th, 8th, and 10th lanes) and that the association occurred in lysates of activated but not of non-activated T cells (Fig. 1B,6th, 8th, and 10th lanes, versus 5th, 7th, and 9th lanes, respectively). To examine whether this protein-protein interaction pattern is selective for Crk, we compared it with the pattern of tyrosyl phosphoproteins that associates with two other adapter proteins, Grb2 and Nck, which are also expressed in T cells. Although the overall pattern of tyrosyl phosphoproteins that interact with Crk and Grb2 was not drastically different, ZAP-70 was found to associate with Crk adapter proteins but not with Grb2 or Nck (Fig. 1B, 5–10th versus 11–14th lanes). Depletion of ZAP-70 from the lysate of activated T cells by repeated absorption with bead-immobilized anti-ZAP-70 Abs confirmed that the Crk-associated 70-kDa protein is ZAP-70 and is not a distinct 70-kDa protein that reacts with the secondary anti-rabbit Ab or directly interacts with the ECL (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the GST-Crk-II fusion protein pulled down a tyrosine-phosphorylated 70-kDa protein only from wild-type Jurkat cells but not from its ZAP-70-deficient mutant, P116 (not shown). The human ZAP-70 protein possesses 31 tyrosine residues that are potential phosphorylation sites for PTKs in pervanadate-activated T cells. One or more of these phosphotyrosyl residues may possibly mediate binding to the Crk-SH2 but may not necessarily be a potential site in TCR-activated T cells. We therefore tested whether cross-linking of the TCR on Jurkat T cells would also induce phosphorylation of ZAP-70 at a site that allows interaction with Crk. Activation of TCR on Jurkat cells was induced by incubation with a TCR Vβ-chain-specific mAb, C305, followed by analysis of the interaction of cell lysate proteins with various GST-Crk fusion proteins. The results demonstrated that C305 stimulation of Jurkat cells induced the association of ZAP-70 with Crk and that the binding affinity to the three Crk proteins was markedly distinct, indicating a hierarchy of Crk-II ≫ CrkL ≥ Crk-I (Fig. 3A). This was based on observations of autoradiograms obtained after extended periods of exposure (not shown). Many of the protein bands observed in the anti-ZAP-70 immunoblots reflected the GST portion of the fusion proteins and their degradation products that react with Abs against the GST portion of the immunogen. To analyze further whether ZAP-70-Crk association represents a general phenomenon in activated T cells, or perhaps an event unique for Jurkat cells or leukemic cells, we performed a similar analysis on lymphocytes from human peripheral blood. Because ZAP-70 is expressed in T, but not B, lymphocytes, we used unseparated peripheral blood lymphocytes stimulated with polyclonal anti-CD3 (OKT3) mAbs. As in Jurkat cells, ZAP-70 from OKT3-stimulated peripheral blood T lymphocytes interacted with GST-Crk (Fig. 3B), and distinct Crk proteins exhibite"

Bacterial expression of SmTPH as a histidine fusion protein produced soluble active enzyme, which was purified to apparent homogeneity and a final specific activity of 0.17 μmol/min/mg of protein. The purified enzyme was found to be a tetramer of approximately 240 kDa with a subunit size of 58 kDa. Several of the biochemical and kinetic properties of SmTPH were similar to those of mammalian tryptophan hydroxylase. Unlike the mammalian enzyme, however, SmTPH was found to be stable at 37 °C, itst½ being nearly 23 times higher than that of a similarly expressed rabbit tryptophan hydroxylase. A semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that the level of SmTPH mRNA in a larval stage of the parasite (cercaria) is 2.5 times higher than in adult S. mansoni, suggesting possible differences in the level of enzyme expression between the two developmental stages. This study demonstrates for the first time the presence of a functional tryptophan hydroxylase in a parasitic helminth and further suggests that the parasites are capable of synthesizing serotonin endogenously.

Neurosci. 1997; 9: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) Serotonin, a well known neuroactive agent of the mammalian central nervous system and periphery (29Jacobs B.L. Azmitia E.C. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 165-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2139) Google Scholar), has been identified in every invertebrate phylum thus far investigated (30Weiger W.A. Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 1997; 72: 61-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In parasitic flatworms (platyhelminths), including the human bloodfluke, Schistosoma mansoni, 5-HT acts as an important regulator of motor activity and carbohydrate metabolism (for a review, see Ref. 31Davis R.E. Stretton A.O.W. Marr J.J. Muller M. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Parasites. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1995: 257-287Crossref Google Scholar) and as such is critical for the survival of the parasite in the host. Immunofluorescence and histochemical studies have localized 5-HT in the central and peripheral nervous systems of the worm, as well as holdfast structures, body musculature, and reproductive structures (31Davis R.E. Stretton A.O.W. Marr J.J. Muller M. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Parasites. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1995: 257-287Crossref Google Scholar). Earlier studies of 5-HT biosynthesis in parasitic helminths reported conflicting results. The failure to demonstrate TPH activity in crude tissue extracts of S. mansoni led some researchers to conclude that TPH is absent in this animal and that the parasite depends entirely on the host for a source of serotonin (32Bennett J.L. Bueding E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1973; 9: 311-319PubMed Google Scholar, 33Catto B.A. Ottesen E.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C. 1979; 2: 235-242Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 34Cho C.H. Mettrick D.F.

Parasitol. 1986; 62: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although other authors have challenged these studies and presented preliminary evidence of 5-HT biosynthesis in related parasites (37Ribeiro P. Webb R.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1983; 7: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 38Ribeiro P. Webb R.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C Comp.

Parasitol. 1988; 18: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), the question of whether TPH is present or absent in parasitic worms, in particular S. mansoni, remains largely unresolved. Here we report the cDNA cloning, purification, and functional characterization of tryptophan hydroxylase from S. mansoni(SmTPH). This study provides the first evidence that S. mansoni, and probably related parasites, possess the endogenous capability for de novo synthesis of 5-HT. When expressed inEscherichia coli, the purified SmTPH was highly active and, in contrast to the mammalian enzyme, very stable during purification and storage. SmTPH represents a potentially useful model for detailed biochemical studies of TPH structure and function. l-Tryptophan, 5-HTP, 5-HT,N-acetyl-5-HT, melatonin, p-chlorophenylalanine, isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside, dithiothreitol, dihydropteridine reductase, NADH, glycerol, and Sephacryl 200HR were purchased from Sigma. Tween 20, ferrous ammonium sulfate, and activated charcoal were from Fisher. [5-3H]-l-Tryptophan was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and dopamine were from Research Biochemicals International. Aprotinin, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and catalase were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other chemicals were of the highest purity and quality from available commercial sources. A Puerto Rican strain of S. mansoniwas maintained as described previously (40Hamdan F.F. Ribeiro P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Crude adult worm tissue extracts were prepared and used directly for TPH activity measurements as described earlier (40Hamdan F.F. Ribeiro P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from S. mansoni using the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Poly(A+) RNA from adult S. mansoni was purified from total RNA using oligo(dT)-cellulose columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A partial S. mansoni cDNA sequence (576 bp) homologous to other TPH sequences was isolated by homology RT-PCR. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized based on a predicted genomic TPH sequence from the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans(cosmid ZK1290; GenBankTM accession no. U21308) and used for PCR amplification of adult S. mansoni oligo(dT) reverse transcribed cDNA. The sense and antisense primers targeted a region of the predicted catalytic domain that is highly conserved among all aromatic amino acid hydroxylases (see Fig. 3). Primer sequences and RT-PCR conditions are described elsewhere (40Hamdan F.F. Ribeiro P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The 5′-end of SmTPH was obtained using a RT-PCR method that targets the conserved 5′-end spliced leader (SL) sequence of S. mansonitranscripts (41Rajkovic A. Davis R.E. Simonsen J.N. Rottman F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8879-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 42Davis R.E. Hardwick C. Tavernier P. Hodgson S. Singh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21813-21819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, adult S. mansoni mRNA (0.5 μg) was reverse-transcribed with an oligo(dT) primer and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). One-tenth of the resulting cDNA was subjected to 30 cycles of PCR (30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 53 °C, 90 s at 72 °C) in a 50-μl reaction containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs mix, 0.4 μm each primer, and 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Oligonucleotide SmSL (see Fig. 1), which corresponded to nucleotides 9–32 of the S. mansoni 36-nucleotide SL sequence (41Rajkovic A. Davis R.E. Simonsen J.N. Rottman F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8879-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) was used as a sense primer, while oligonucleotide A (see Fig. 1) was used as an antisense primer. An aliquot (2 μl of 1:10 dilution) of the PCR product was similarly subjected to a second PCR reaction (25 cycles; same cycling parameters as above) using the same sense primer (SmSL) and a nested reverse primer (primer B; see Fig. 1). The resulting PCR product was gel-purified, cloned into the vector PCR 2.1 (Invitrogen), and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method. The 3′-end of SmTPH cDNA was amplified from an adult S. mansoni cDNA library in pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). An aliquot of the plasmid library (0.4 μg) was subjected to PCR (30 cycles) using a SmTPH-specific sense primer (primer C; see Fig. 1) and an antisense pcDNA3.1(+) vector-specific primer flanking the multiple cloning site (VSP1, 5′-GGAGGGGCAAACAACAGATGG-3′). The PCR cycling parameters were as above except for an annealing temperature of 55 °C. An aliquot of the PCR product was subjected to a second round of PCR amplification (25 cycles) using a nested SmTPH-specific sense primer (primer D; see Fig. 1) and pcDNA3.1(+) vector-specific-primer (VSP2, 5′-TAGAAGGCACAGTCGAGGC-3′). Amplified products were cloned into pCR2.1, and DNA was sequenced as before. For expression studies, the complete coding sequence of SmTPH was amplified by RT-PCR and subcloned into a T7 polymerase-based pET prokaryotic expression vector (43Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). Oligo(dT) reverse transcribed cDNA was subjected to 35 cycles of PCR with primers that targeted the entire coding sequence of SmTPH (primers S and E; see Fig. 1) and a proofreading DNA polymerase (Pwo; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's procedure. To facilitate further subcloning into the expression vector, enzyme restriction sitesNdeI and BamHI were incorporated at the 5′-end of the sense and antisense primers, respectively. The resulting PCR product was gel-purified, digested with NdeI and BamHI (Life Technologies, Inc.), and ligated into pET15b vector (Novagen), which was linearized by the same two restriction enzymes. Cloning into pET15b introduces an N-terminal oligohistidine fusion tag, which adds 20 amino acid residues of vector-derived sequence to the expressed SmTPH product. The final construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing of three independent clones and then used to transform E. coli host strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). BL21(DE3)pLysS cells transformed with the SmTPH.pET15b construct were grown at 37 °C in LB-ampicillin-chloramphenicol medium to an A600 of ∼0.5–1.0 (log growth phase). Cultures were supplemented with 0.1 mm ferrous ammonium sulfate, as described previously (13Tipper J.P. Citron B.A. Ribeiro P. Kaufman S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Vrana K.E. Rucker P.J. Kumer S.C. Life Sci. 1994; 55: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 15Yang X.J. Kaufman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6659-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and then induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside for 2.5 h at 30 °C. After induction, the cells were washed once with ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), pelleted by centrifugation, and stored frozen at −80 °C until used. For purification of recombinant SmTPH, cell pellets from 100 ml of induced bacterial cultures were thawed in 4 ml of 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5m NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, 5% glycerol, 10 mmimidazole, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 50 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin). To promote cell lysis by the T7 resident lysogen, the cells were subjected to two cycles of rapid freeze-thawing followed by sonication on ice (seven pulses of 15 s separated by intervals of 30 s) using a vibra cell sonicator (Sonics and Material, Danbury, CT) set at 20% maximal power. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min and 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 2.5 ml of the same buffer and similarly sonicated and centrifuged as above. The two supernatants were pooled and used for direct enzymatic assays and for subsequent purification of the expressed enzyme. Recombinant SmTPH was purified by immobilized metal (nickel) affinity chromatography (44Linder P. Guth B. Wulfing C. Krebber C. Steipe B. Muller F. Pluckthun A. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1992; 4: 41-56Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar) using the HisTrap kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for purification of histidine-tagged proteins, as described previously (40Hamdan F.F. Ribeiro P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Excess imidazole was removed by gel filtration through a Sephadex G-25 column (PD-10; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the purified enzyme was stored in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 0.2m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Tween 20, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Purified enzyme preparations (0.2 mg/ml) were stable for at least 4 days at 4 °C and could be stored at −80 °C for at least 1 month with no significant loss in activity. TPH activity was measured using the tritiated water release method (45Beevers S.J. Knowles R.G. Pogson C.I. J. Neurochem. 1983; 40: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 46Vrana S.L. Dworkin S.I. Vrana K.E. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1993; 48: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with few modifications. The standard assay was performed in a 100-μl reaction of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 400,000 cpm ofl-[5-3H]Tryptophan and enough unlabeledl-tryptophan to make a final concentration of 100 μm, 0.2 mg/ml catalase, 0.4 mm NADH, 10 milliunits of dihydropteridine reductase, 10 μmdithiothreitol, and either purified SmTPH (0.6 μg) or crude adultS. mansoni tissue extract (50–100 μg of protein). The reaction was started with the addition of 200 μmBH4, unless indicated otherwise, and the samples were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Preliminary experiments revealed that TPH activity increased linearly up to 12 min of incubation under these conditions. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of activated charcoal (7.5% (w/v) in 1 m HCl) to each sample. After centrifugation (2000 × g for 10 min), aliquots of the supernatants were radioassayed in 10 ml of scintillation mixture (ICN). Enzyme activity data were analyzed using Lineweaver-Burk plots or by computer-assisted, nonlinear curve fitting to the Michaelis-Menten model. All kinetic parameters (Kmand apparent Km (S0.5)) were determined using the program Enzyme Kinetics (version 1.C; DogStar Software) and were obtained from two to three independent experiments, each performed in duplicates or triplicates. The stability of SmTPH was assessed in comparison with that of recombinant rabbit brain TPH similarly expressed in E. coli. In preparation for these experiments, the complete coding sequence of rabbit brain TPH cDNA (13Tipper J.P. Citron B.A. Ribeiro P. Kaufman S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pET15b and expressed as a histidine-tagged protein in BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli. Bacterial cells expressing rabbit TPH or SmTPH were lysed, as described above, and the corresponding soluble fractions containing expressed enzyme were passed through a Sephadex G25 PD10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with the same HEPES buffer described earlier. Stability was measured as a function of time according to the procedure of Mockus et al.(25Mockus S.M. Kumer S.C. Vrana K.E. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots (100 μg of protein) of the crude SmTPH or rabbit TPH extracts were preincubated at 37 °C for varying lengths of time (0, 10, 20, 40, and 80 min) and then assayed for TPH activity. The data were calculated as a percentage of the initial level of activity (t = 0) for each enzyme. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was employed for the determination of SmTPH mRNA levels. Total RNA (∼2 μg) from two developmental stages of S. mansoni (cercaria and adults) were subjected to DNase I treatment (amplification grade; Life Technologies, Inc.) followed by a standard RT-PCR reaction (1 min at 94 °C, 14–36 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 53.5 °C, 60 s at 72 °C, and 7 min at 72 °C) using primers (sense, primer D; antisense, primer F; see Fig. 1) that amplify an 873-bp cDNA product from SmTPH. PCR was standardized by simultaneous amplification of a constitutively expressed control housekeeping gene, S. mansoni α-tubulin (47Webster P.J. Seta K.A. Chung S.C. Mansour T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 51: 169-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 48Mei H. LoVerde P.T. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 86: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), as described previously (49Kinoshita T. Imamura J. Nagai H. Shimotohno K. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The PCR primers used for the amplification of the 558-bp S. mansoni α-tubulin cDNA fragment were as follows: sense, 5′-CTTATCGTCAACTTTTCCATCC-3′; antisense, 5′-GGAAGTGGATACGAGGATAAGG-3′ (modified from Ref. 48Mei H. LoVerde P.T. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 86: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Standard curves were generated to ensure that the PCR assay was in the exponential phase of synthesis after 34 cycles for SmTPH or 24 cycles for α-tubulin. The resulting PCR products were cloned in PCR2.1 and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Densitometric analysis of the ethidium bromide-stained RT-PCR products were performed with the NIH Image program version 1.61 (Bethesda, MA). Size exclusion chromatography of purified SmTPH was performed on a Sephacryl-200HR gel filtration column (10-mm inner diameter × 50 cm; Bio-Rad), as described previously (27Mockus S.M. Kumer S.C. Vrana K.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1342: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured by the method of Bradford (50Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar), using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to the method of Laemmli (51Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) using precast 10% acrylamide gels from Novex, Inc. For Western blot analysis of SmTPH, aliquots of purified enzyme (0.5–1 μg) were electrophoresed as above, transferred onto nitrocellulose (52Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and reacted with a sheep polyclonal antibody (1:500 dilution) raised against rabbit TPH (Chemicon International) followed by a peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep IgG (Pierce) as the secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution). A partial TPH sequence was first obtained by RT-PCR using oligo(dT) reverse-transcribed S. mansoni cDNA and C. elegans primers (40Hamdan F.F. Ribeiro P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) that targeted a region conserved among all aromatic amino acid hydroxylases. A 576-bp product was sequenced and found to have high homology with TPH sequences from other species. The missing 5′- and 3′-ends were subsequently obtained by an anchored PCR-based strategy. The 5′-end was amplified in a RT-PCR reaction that targeted the conserved SL sequence of S. mansoni (40Hamdan F.F. Ribeiro P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 41Rajkovic A. Davis R.E. Simonsen J.N. Rottman F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8879-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A 741-bp product corresponding to the 5′-end of TPH was sequenced and found to carry a complete S. mansoniSL (nucleotides 9–36 of the SL sequence; see Fig. 1) including the last four nucleotides, which were not part of the SmSL primer used in the anchored PCR reaction. This finding suggests that SmTPH is trans-spliced at the 5′-end to the S. mansoni SL, just as described previously for several other S. mansoni cDNAs (40Hamdan F.F. Ribeiro P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 41Rajkovic A. Davis R.E. Simonsen J.N. Rottman F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21813-21819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The 3′-end of SmTPH was PCR-amplified directly from a S. mansoni cDNA plasmid library, using TPH-specific and vector-derived primers (see Fig. 1). The resulting product (1000 bp) contains a potential polyadenylation sequence (AATATA) (53Birnstiel M.L. Busslinger M. Strub K. Cell. 1985; 41: 349-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar) upstream of a poly(A) tail and thus is presumed to represent the 3′-end of the full-length transcript. Fig. 1 shows the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of SmTPH. The composite cDNA reveals a single open reading frame of 1494 bp encoding a predicted protein of 497 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 58 kDa. Protein sequence analysis revealed the presence of two consensus sites (Ser151 and Thr130) for phosphorylation by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II and a consensus leucine zipper motif (SmTPH amino acid positions 358–377). BLAST analysis (54Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71458) Google Scholar) of the predicted protein sequence indicated that SmTPH is highly homologous to tryptophan hydroxylase from other species. The dendrogram in Fig. 2 shows that SmTPH is more related to TPH sequences than to those of the other two aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, TH and PAH. Based on pairwise CLUSTAL protein alignments (55Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar), SmTPH shares high amino acid sequence homology (65–67%) with vertebrate TPH sequences (13Tipper J.P. Citron B.A. Ribeiro P. Kauf"
https://openalex.org/W1978709779,"Mechanisms responsible for the initiation of major glaciation in the Northern Hemisphere at about 2.75 million years ago are poorly understood. A laminated terrestrial sequence from Pula maar, Hungary, containing about 320,000 years in annual layers between 3.05 and 2.60 million years ago, provides a detailed record of rates of climatic change across this dramatic transition. An analysis of the record implies that climatic variations at sub-Milankovitch frequencies (less than or equal to 15,000 years) were an important driving force during this transitional interval and that, as the threshold was approached, these increased in frequency and amplitude, possibly providing the final trigger for the amplification of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets."
https://openalex.org/W2043656081,"Catalysis of ATP hydrolysis by two NH2-terminal fragments of yeast DNA topoisomerase II was studied in the absence and presence of DNA, and in the absence and presence of inhibitor ICRF-193. The results indicate that purified Top2-(1–409), a fragment containing the NH2-terminal 409 amino acids of the yeast enzyme, is predominantly monomeric, with a low level of ATPase owing to weak association of two monomers to form a catalytically active dimer. The ATPase activity of Top2-(1–409) is independent of DNA in a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, in which intact yeast DNA topoisomerase II exhibits robust DNA-dependent ATPase and DNA transport activities. Purified Top2-(1–660), a fragment containing the NH2-terminal 660 amino acid of the yeast enzyme, appears to be dimeric in the absence or presence of DNA, and the ATPase activity of the protein is significantly stimulated by DNA. These results are consistent with a model in which binding of an intact DNA topoisomerase II to DNA places the various subfragments of the enzyme in a way that makes the intramolecular dimerization of the ATPase domains more favorable. We believe that this alignment of subfragments is mainly achieved through the binding of the enzyme to the DNA segment within which the enzyme makes transient breaks. The ATPase activity of Top2-(1–409) is inhibited by ICRF-193, suggesting that the bisdioxopiperazine class of DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors directly interacts with the paired ATPase domains of the enzyme. Catalysis of ATP hydrolysis by two NH2-terminal fragments of yeast DNA topoisomerase II was studied in the absence and presence of DNA, and in the absence and presence of inhibitor ICRF-193. The results indicate that purified Top2-(1–409), a fragment containing the NH2-terminal 409 amino acids of the yeast enzyme, is predominantly monomeric, with a low level of ATPase owing to weak association of two monomers to form a catalytically active dimer. The ATPase activity of Top2-(1–409) is independent of DNA in a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, in which intact yeast DNA topoisomerase II exhibits robust DNA-dependent ATPase and DNA transport activities. Purified Top2-(1–660), a fragment containing the NH2-terminal 660 amino acid of the yeast enzyme, appears to be dimeric in the absence or presence of DNA, and the ATPase activity of the protein is significantly stimulated by DNA. These results are consistent with a model in which binding of an intact DNA topoisomerase II to DNA places the various subfragments of the enzyme in a way that makes the intramolecular dimerization of the ATPase domains more favorable. We believe that this alignment of subfragments is mainly achieved through the binding of the enzyme to the DNA segment within which the enzyme makes transient breaks. The ATPase activity of Top2-(1–409) is inhibited by ICRF-193, suggesting that the bisdioxopiperazine class of DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors directly interacts with the paired ATPase domains of the enzyme. The type II DNA topoisomerases are enzymes that catalyze the ATP-dependent transport of one DNA double helix through another (1Brown P.O. Peebles C.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6110-6119Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 2Liu L.F. Liu C.C. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1980; 19: 697-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). All forms of life are known to contain one or more of these enzymes, and they participate in vital cellular processes including chromosome condensation and segregation, and the maintenance of genome stability (reviewed in Ref. 3Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar). The biological importance of these enzymes is further illustrated by the identification of a large number of natural toxins and antibacterial and antitumor agents that target these enzymes (4Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 191-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 5Maxwell A.

The transport of one DNA duplex through another by a type II DNA topoisomerase is strongly dependent on ATP (8Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5960-5963Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 9Liu L.F. Liu C.C. Alberts B.M. Nature. 1979; 281: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 10Miller K.G. Liu L.F. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9334-9339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extensive biochemical and structural studies of these enzymes in recent years have led to a molecular model on this dependence (Refs. 11Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 609-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar and 12Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar; for a recent review, see Ref. 13Wang J.C. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In this model, the enzyme is a dimer with two pairs of jaws that form two molecular ports (gates). The pair of ATPase domains of the enzyme form one port of the enzyme, termed the N-gate because of the NH2-terminal location of the ATPase domain in the single polypeptide eukaryotic enzyme. The second port of the protein is formed by regions closer to the COOH termini of the pair of polypeptides in a homodimeric eukaryotic enzyme, and hence has been denoted the C-gate. In Fig. 1, an enzyme molecule bound to a duplex DNA segment, termed the gate- or G-segment, is sketched to illustrate the locations of of the various parts of the enzyme-DNA complex. It is believed that the primary event following the binding of ATP to a G-segment bound enzyme is the intramolecular dimerization of the pair of ATPase domains to close the N-gate. The closure of the N-gate in turn triggers a conformational cascade in the enzyme-DNA complex. First, the enzyme-linked broken DNA ends, formed by transesterification between a pair of enzyme tyrosyl residues and a pair of DNA phosphoryl groups in the G-segment, are pulled apart to open a gate in the DNA. The T-segment is then transported through the transiently opened DNA gate into the large hole between the G-segment and the C-gate. Following these steps, the enzyme-linked ends of the G-segment retract toward each other to close the DNA gate, and this retraction in turn reduces the size of the large hole and forces out the T-segment through the transiently opened C-gate. Finally, the N-gate reopens after ATP hydrolysis and/or the release of the hydrolytic products, and the enzyme is set for another round of reaction. There is strong evidence that the binding of ATP to a type II DNA topoisomerase leads to intramolecular dimerization of the pair of ATPase domains (14Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 15Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 16Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22606-22614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Roca J. Berger J.M. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4057-4062Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), which brings together key residues in both halves of the enzyme for the catalysis of ATP hydrolysis (14Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). It is also well established that the ATPase activity of a type II DNA topoisomerase is stimulated by the presence of DNA (8Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5960-5963Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 9Liu L.F. Liu C.C. Alberts B.M. Nature. 1979; 281: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 10Miller K.G. Liu L.F. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9334-9339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). How the binding of a DNA stimulates the ATPase activity is, however, less clear. In the simplest view, the binding of an enzyme to a DNA G-segment facilitates the dimerization of its pair of ATPase domains and thus enhances its ATPase activity. Alternatively, the ATPase activity of the enzyme may depend on its interactions with the G- as well as the T-segment. The involvement of the T-segment in the catalysis of ATP hydrolysis by a type II DNA topoisomerase has been implicated in a number of studies. First, a mutation replacing Arg-286 of the Escherichia coligyrase B-subunit by glutamine was found to have no effect on the DNA-independent ATPase activity of gyrase but abolish the stimulation of the ATPase activity by DNA (18Tingey A.P. Maxwell A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The location of Arg-286 in the crystal structure of a 43-kDa NH2-terminal fragment ofE. coli GyrB protein suggests that this residue may be involved in T-segment binding, and hence the lack of DNA-dependent stimulation of the mutant gyrase ATPase may reflect a role of the T-segment in the catalysis of ATP hydrolysis (18Tingey A.P. Maxwell A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Second, stimulation of the E. coli gyrase ATPase by DNA was found to depend on the length of the DNA (19Maxwell A. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14472-14480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): for each enzyme molecule, a single DNA molecule longer than 100 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pairs.1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pairs. would suffice but two DNA molecules shorter than 70 bp would be required. It was therefore suggested that ATPase stimulation involved DNA binding to two separate sites in the enzyme, plausibly for the binding of the G and T segments. A long DNA fragment could presumably form a loop to contact both sites, but two short DNA fragments would be needed to do the same (19Maxwell A. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14472-14480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the authors pointed out, however, interpretation of these results is not straightforward (18Tingey A.P. Maxwell A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 19Maxwell A. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14472-14480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of allosteric changes in the various reaction steps of a type II DNA topoisomerase, it is uncertain whether the R286Q mutation affects T-segment binding or influences an allosteric conformational change triggered by G-segment binding. The DNA length dependence of the gyrase ATPase is suggestive of two DNA-binding sites, but both sites could be involved in G-segment binding (18Tingey A.P. Maxwell A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). When a similar experiment on the dependence of the ATPase activity on DNA length was carried out with human DNA topoisomerase IIα, the rate of ATP hydrolysis at a molar ratio of two DNA molecules per enzyme dimer showed a sharp spike at a DNA length of about 340 bp, illustrating the complexity of this dependence (20Hammonds T.R. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32696-32703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Several studies were also carried out with various type II DNA topoisomerase fragments. Early studies with the GyrB protein ofE. coli showed little effect of DNA on its ATPase in the absence of the GyrA protein (8Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5960-5963Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 19Maxwell A. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14472-14480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sugino A. Higgins N.P. Brown P.O. Peebles C.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4838-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of a 43-kDa NH2-terminal fragment of GyrB was also found to be unaffected by DNA (15Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 22Ali J.A. Orphanides G. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9801-9808Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). More recently, study of a renatured 50-kDa fragment of human DNA topoisomerases IIα containing amino acids 1–435 of the intact enzyme showed that it differed from the 43-kDaE. coli GyrB fragment in two major aspects. First, whereas the 43-kDa GyrB fragment is monomeric, the 50-kDa human enzyme fragment is dimeric. Second, unlike the GyrB ATPase, the ATPase activity of the 50-kDa human protein is stimulated by 5–10-fold in the presence of DNA. This stimulation was attributed to a plausible involvement of the T-segment (23Gardiner L.P. Roper D.I. Hammonds T.R. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16997-17004Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report measurements of the ATPase activities of two NH2-terminal fragments of yeast DNA topoisomerase II containing amino acid residues 1–409 and 1–660, both of which can be overexpressed in a soluble form and thus required no unfolding and renaturation prior to ATPase measurements. The effect of an inhibitor of eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II, a bisdioxopiperazine ICRF-193, on the ATPase activities of these fragments is also reported. We infer from these results that DNA stimulates the ATPase activity of a type II DNA topoisomerase by facilitating intramolecular dimerization of the pair of ATPase domains of the enzyme. The binding of an enzyme to a DNA G-segment is likely to bring various structural domains of the enzyme into positions, such that the ATPase domains are correctly aligned to contact each other upon ATP binding, to form a pair of active sites for the hydrolysis of ATP. Whether a DNA T-segment is involved in ATP hydrolysis is unclear; it appears that ATP hydrolysis by the enzyme does not involve direct contact between DNA and the ATPase domains of the enzyme. We also show that a DNA topoisomerase II-targeting antitumor agent ICRF-193 inhibits the ATPase of yeast Top2-(1–409), indicating that bisdioxopiperazines of the ICRF-193 class (7Andoh T. Ishida R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) are likely to interact primarily with the dimer form of the ATPase domain of eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II. This conclusion differs from the one drawn from previous experiments with a 50-kDa human DNA topoisomerase II NH2-terminal fragment (23Gardiner L.P. Roper D.I. Hammonds T.R. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16997-17004Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The expression vector pESP-1 (Stratagene) was used in the construction of plasmids for the overexpression of the NH2-terminal fragments ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae DNA topoisomerase II inSchizosaccharomyces pombe. The coding sequence of Top2-(1–409) was synthesized by the polymerase chain reaction, using 5′-GGGAATTCCATATGTCAACTGAACCGGTAAGCGCC-3′ as the 5′ primer and 5′-TACGGATCCTAGCTAGCTTCTTCATTTGCGTCGGCAATTTCAAACATTCT-3′ as the 3′ primer. The use of these primers introduced anNdeI site at the ATG start of the TOP2 gene and an NheI and a BamHI site near the other end of the polymerase chain reaction product (positions of these sites are underlined in the primer sequences). The polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA was cloned in between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pUC19, and a synthetic oligonucleotide was used to introduce a hexahistidine tag between the NheI and BamHI sites of the cloned DNA segment such that the open reading frame contained codons for the first 409 amino acid residues ofS. cerevisiae DNA topoisomerase II plus Gly-Ser-(His)6-Stop (codons for Gly-Ser were introduced by the addition of the NheI site GCTAGC). The NdeI to BamHI fragment was then mixed with two segments derived from pESP-1, a BstEII to BamHI fragment and aBstEII to NdeI fragment, and treated with DNA ligase to give the desired plasmid for overexpression of Top2-(1–409). The overexpression clone for Top2-(1–660) was similarly constructed, using the oligonucleotide 5′-TACGGATCCTAGCTAGCCCCGGGTTCGTATTGTCTCAGCCATTCTTTACG-3′ instead of the 3′ primer described above for the synthesis of the Top2-(1–409) coding region by polymerase chain reaction. In the final construct, the first 660 codons of S. cerevisiae are followed by Ser-(His)6-Stop. Similar clones were also constructed for induced expression of the proteins in E. coli. Although overexpression was readily achieved, the proteins were mostly in an insoluble form and were not used in the studies reported here. Transfection, growth, and harvest ofS. pombe cells were carried out according to the supplier of the pESP-1 vector. In the preparation of each protein, cells from 10 liters of culture were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 150 ml of a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 0.25% Triton X-100, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin), and disrupted by blending with about equal volume of glass beads in a “Bead-beater” (Biospec Products). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and loaded on about 15-ml bed volume of Ni-resin (Novagen). After washing successively with 15 column volumes of the lysis buffer and 15 volumes of a washing buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole), the protein was eluted with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, and 200 mm imidazole. The eluate (20 ml) was immediately loaded on a heparin column (3-ml bed volume) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol, rinsed with 15 volumes of the same buffer and eluted with 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8, 400 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol. Peak fractions of the overexpressed protein were pooled, concentrated by centrifugation in a Centricon 30 concentrator (Amicon) to about 20 mg/ml in a storage buffer containing 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8, 400 mm NaCl, and 15% glycerol. The concentrated protein was divided into small aliquots, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The typical yield from a 10-liter culture was about 15 mg of Top2-(1–409) or 8 mg of Top2-(1–660). In the spectrophotometric assay using an ATP regeneration system that quantitatively couples NADH oxidation to the conversion of ADP back to ATP (24Morrical S.W. Lee J. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), each reaction mixture (1 ml) contained 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 8 mmMgCl2, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm NADH, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 3 units of pyruvate kinase, 4 units of lactate dehydrogenase, and varying concentrations of NaCl and DNA as specified in the individual experiments. Reactions were initiated by mixing 0.9 ml of a reaction mixture without ATP and 0.1 ml of 10 mm ATP in the assay buffer, both pre-equilibrated to 30 °C. Decrease in NADH concentration was monitored by absorbance at 340 nm in a Cary 50 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostated cell holder (Varian). Plasmids for the overexpression of two NH2-terminal fragments of S. cerevisiae DNA topoisomerase II in the fission yeast S. pombe were constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The 47-kDa protein fragment Top2-(1–409) contains Met-1 to Glu-409 of the budding yeast enzyme, corresponding to the first 390 amino acid residues of E. coli GyrB. This fragment is known to be generated by cleavage of the intact enzyme with SV8 endoprotease (25Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10485-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cleavage after Glu-409 is blocked by binding of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog to the intact enzyme, indicating that the conformation of the peptide around this site is allosterically altered by the intramolecular dimerization of the ATPase domains (25Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10485-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The 76-kDa fragment Top2-(1–660) contains Met-1 to Gly-660 of the budding yeast enzyme, corresponding to full-length E. coli GyrB protein (26Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29B: 271-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For convenience of purification, a hexahistidine tag was fused to the COOH terminus of each of the protein fragments. Both tagged fragments overexpressed well and were readily purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 2). Panel A of Fig. 3 depicts the ATPase activity of yeast Top2-(1–409) in the absence of DNA. In either an assay buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, or the same buffer with 10 instead of 100 mm NaCl, the rate of ATP hydrolysis showed a parabolic dependence on protein concentration. Plotting the rate (in nanomolar of ATP hydrolyzed per second) as the square of protein concentration (in μm2) produced a straight line in both buffers, with a slope of 6.4 and 22.7, respectively, in the 100 and 10 mm NaCl medium (Fig. 3B). These results indicate a monomer-dimer equilibrium of the 409-amino acid fragment and that the ATPase activity of the monomer is much lower than that of the dimer. The parabolic dependence of the ATPase activity on protein concentration also suggests that the monomer is the predominant species over the entire concentration range shown, otherwise the ATPase activity would switch to a linear dependence on protein concentration at the higher concentration end of the curves. The higher ATPase activity of yeast Top2-(1–409) in the 10 mm NaCl buffer can be attributed to either an increase in the monomer-dimer association constant, or an increase of the intrinsic ATPase activity of the dimer, when the salt concentration is lowered; we feel that the former interpretation is the more likely one. Fig. 4 depicts the DNA dependence of the ATPase activity of yeast Top2-(1–409). As shown in panel A, in the 100 mm NaCl buffer the rate of ATP hydrolysis was found to be independent of DNA concentration. In the 10 mmNaCl buffer, however, an increase in the ATPase activity of yeast Top2-(1–409) upon the addition of DNA was observed. At a protein concentration of 1 μm in the 10 mm salt buffer, the ATPase activity increased steeply with increasing DNA concentration, reaching a plateau at a DNA to protein ratio of 40 bp per protein monomer (Fig. 4, panel A). This steep rise in the ATPase activity of Top2-(1–409) with increasing DNA concentration can be attributed to a shift of the protein monomer to dimer equilibrium in favor of the dimer formation in the low salt buffer, owing to the preferential binding of the dimeric species to DNA. The preferential binding of dimeric Top2-(1–409) to DNA in the 10 mm salt buffer is consistent with the linear rather than parabolic dependence of the rate of ATP hydrolysis on enzyme concentration (Fig. 4, panel B). The source and form of DNA showed little effect in the enhancement of ATPase; supercoiled plasmid, linear plasmid, and sonicated salmon sperm DNA were equally effective. No stimulation of the ATPase activity of Top2-(1–409) was seen, however, with tRNA. Results of the ATPase activity of yeast Top2-(1–660) are shown in Fig. 5. Surprisingly, in the absence or presence of DNA, the rate of ATPase hydrolysis is linearly dependent on protein concentration. Thus it appears that even in the absence of DNA and in the presence of ATP the 660-amino acid fragment is dimeric in solution, whereas Top2-(1–409) is largely monomeric under the same conditions. Amino acid residues 409–660 of yeast DNA topoisomerase II constitute the “B′-subfragment” of the enzyme (Fig. 1), which has been observed to form a dimer interface in the crystal structure of a 92-kDa fragment of the yeast enzyme (12Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). The presence of the B′-subfragment in yeast Top2-(1–660) may therefore favor dimerization of the fragment. Despite the dimeric behavior of this fragment under the ATPase assay conditions, the addition of DNA to a ratio of 55 bp per protein monomer was found to stimulate the ATPase, by about 4- and 7-fold, respectively, in the 100 and 50 mm salt buffer (Fig. 5, panel B). The nature of this stimulation will be discussed in a later section. When the ATPase activity of yeast Top2-(1–660) at a fixed protein concentration of 0.4 μm was measured as a function of DNA concentration, in the 100 mm salt buffer a largely monotonic increase was seen with increasing DNA concentration, reaching a plateau at higher DNA concentrations (Fig. 6, lower curve). In contrast, in the 50 mm salt medium the increase was not monotonic: a sharp increase with increasing DNA concentration was followed by a drop at still higher DNA concentrations (Fig. 6, upper curve). A number of bisdioxopiperazines with antitumor activities, including ICRF-159 and ICRF-193, are believed to stabilize the closed-clamp conformation of eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II (7Andoh T. Ishida R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 27Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Mammalian cell lines resistant to these compounds have been isolated, and two drug-resistant mutants have been mapped to the ATPase domain of the enzyme (7Andoh T. Ishida R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 28Sehested M. Wessel I. Jensen L.H. Holm B. Oliveri R.S. Kenwrick S. Creighton A.M. Nitiss J.L. Jensen P.B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1460-1468PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the bisdioxopiperazine-binding pocket of the enzyme is located in a dimerized pair of ATPase domains. Studies of interactions between ICRF-159 and Drosophilia DNA topoisomerase II lacking the ATPase domain raised the possibility, however, that the bisdioxopiperazines bind outside this domain (29Chang S. Hu T. Hsieh T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19822-19828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To test further the mechanism of inhibition of eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II by the bisdioxopiperazines, we examined the effect of ICRF-193 on the ATPase activity of yeast Top2-(1–409) and Top2-(1–660). In the experiment shown in Fig. 7, the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of yeast Top2-(1–409) was monitored in a spectrophotometric assay in which the formation of ADP from ATP hydrolysis was enzymatically coupled to NADH oxidation (24Morrical S.W. Lee J. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Curve 1 shows the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of the fragment in the absence of ICRF-193. As expected, the concentration of NADH decreased linearly with time until all NADH was exhausted at the end of the reaction. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was calculated to be 178 nm s−1, from the slope of the linear region of the plot, at a total Top2-(1–409) concentration of 0.85 μm (in monomers). In the presence of 0.1 mmICRF-193, however, the kinetics of NADH consumption or ATP hydrolysis by Top2-(1–409) in the presence of DNA is complex (curve 2in Fig. 7). In the first several minutes following the mixing of the various reagents including the drug, the rate of ATP hydrolysis in the presence of the drug was essentially the same as that in the absence of the drug, as indicated by the convergence of curves 1 and 2 of Fig. 7 near the start of the reaction. At longer times, however, the slope of curve 2 progressively decreased from 178 nm s−1 to about 40 nms−1, signifying a gradual reduction in the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of yeast Top2-(1–409) in the presence of ICRF-193. These data indicate that ICRF-193 slowly inhibits the ATPase activity of Top2-(1–409). Preincubation of the protein with ICRF-193 in the absence of ATP did not alter this slow kinetics of inhibition (results not shown), in agreement with previous results that the drug specifically interacts with the “closed-clamp” conformation of DNA topoisomerase II, in which the N-gate is closed by the binding of ATP to the ATPase domains of the dimeric enzyme (27Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The relatively slow inhibitory effect of ICRF-193 was also observed when similar experiments were carried out with Top2-(1–660) in the absence or presence of DNA (data not shown). Together, these experiments indicate that the bisdioxopiperazine inhibits the ATPase activity of yeast DNA topoisomerase II, and that the primary site of interaction is most likely within the 409-amino acid ATPase domain. The reversibility of the inhibition of DNA topoisomerase II ATPase activity by ICRF-193 was tested in view of the slow time course of inhibition. Yeast Top2-(1–660), at a concentration of 13.1 μm, was first incubated in the 100 mmsalt reaction buffer containing 3 mm ATP and 0.1 mm ICRF-193 at 30 °C for 1 h. The mixture was then split into two: one was dialyzed at 4 °C against the same buffer containing 0.1 mm ICRF-193 and no ATP, and the other the same buffer without either drug or ATP. The sample dialyzed against 0.1 mm ICRF-193 was then diluted to a final Top2-(1–660) concentration of 0.26 μm into the ATPase assay mixture containing DNA, ATP, and 0.1 mm ICRF-193, and incubated at 30 °C. As shown in Fig. 8, the NADH concentration in this sample decreased linearly with time, with a slope corresponding to an ATP hydrolysis rate of 82 nms−1 (curve 1). The NADH concentration of the other sample initially decreased with the same slope as that of curve 1, but the rate of NADH oxidation accelerated at longer times, approaching a slope corresponding to an ATP hydrolysis rate of 380 nm s−1 after a period of about 25 min (curve 2 of Fig. 7). These results demonstrate that the inhibition of the ATPase activity of the yeast enzyme by ICRF-193 is reversible. The slow rate of ATP hydrolysis near the beginning of the reaction suggests that the protein-bound ICRF-193 remained bound during dialysis at 4 °C, but gradually dissociated during the first 20 min of incubation at 30 °C in the presence of ATP. In the above section, we describe results on the ATPase activities of two NH2-terminal fragments of yeast DNA topoisomerase II, one containing the first 409 and the other the first 660 amino acids of the intact enzyme. Both fragments overexpressed well inS. pombe cells and were readily purified to near homogeneity in a soluble form. For intact yeast DNA topoisomerase II, the ATP-dependent transport of one DNA double helix through another is optimal in a buffer containing more than 100 mm monovalent salt (30Goto T. Laipis P. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10422-10429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore significant that in the 100 mm salt buffer the ATPase activity of the 47-kDa yeast DNA topoisomerase II fragment Top2-(1–409) is not increased by DNA: under conditions that are optimal for catalysis of ATP hydrolysis by yeast DNA topoisomerase II, interaction between DNA and the ATPase domains of the enzyme spanning amino acids 1–409 appears to be insignificant. The ATPase activity of Top2-(1–409) is significantly affected by the presence of DNA, however, in a buffer with a much reduced monovalent ion concentration. The dependence of the rate of ATP hydrolysis on protein concentration, which is a quadratic function in the absence of DNA, becomes a linear one in the presence of DNA in the low salt buffer, suggesting that the presence of DNA shifts the monomer-dimer equilibrium of the protein fragment toward dimerization. While here it might be tempting to invoke a role of the DNA T-segment in the stimulation of ATP hydrolysis, for the reasons below we believe that such an inference is problematic. First, in this low salt buffer intact yeast DNA topoisomerase II is inactive in transporting a T-segment through a G-segment. Second, these results, while supporting the preferential binding of the dimeric form to DNA in the low salt buffer, provide no information on how the DNA is interacting with the dimer or whether the DNA is binding to the dimer in a way expected for a T-segment. Third, because of the linear and quadratic dependence of ATPase on Top2-(1–409) concentration in the presence and absence of DNA, respectively, the apparent enhancement of ATPase activity by DNA may be misleading. In the 10 mm NaCl buffer and at a Top2-(1–409) concentration close to 5 μm, the presence of DNA at a ratio of about 40 bp of DNA per enzyme monomer stimulates ATPase by less than 2-fold; at even higher protein concentrations, the ATPase activity of the enzyme in the presence of DNA is probably lower than that in the absence of DNA, if the two curves in Fig. 2 can be extrapolated to higher protein concentrations (the limited solubility of the protein in the low salt medium makes it impractical, however, to test this prediction). Fourth, the measured level of the DNA-dependent ATPase of Top2-(1–409) is rather low; the slope of the linear plot gives a rate of 0.2 ATP hydrolyzed per second per Top2-(1–409) or 0.4 ATP hydrolyzed per second per pair of Top2-(1–409), which is comparable in magnitude to the DNA-independent ATPase of intact yeast DNA topoisomerase II but much lower than the turnover number of 5–20 ATP/s per intact dimeric yeast enzyme in the presence of DNA (31Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These considerations, together with the observed lack of ATPase stimulation by DNA in the 100 mm salt medium, led us to favor the interpretation that direct interaction between DNA and the ATPase sites of a type II DNA topoisomerase is not important in the catalysis of ATP hydrolysis. For the 76-kDa yeast Top2-(1–660), the rate of ATP hydrolysis is substantially enhanced by DNA, even though the linear dependence of the ATPase activity on protein concentration suggests that under the assay conditions Top2-(1–660) in the absence of DNA is already in a dimeric form. The intrinsic ATPase activity of Top2-(1–660) in the 100 mm salt buffer, estimated from the data in Fig. 4, is about 0.06 ATP hydrolyzed per second per Top2-(1–660) monomer or 0.12 ATP hydrolyzed per second per Top2-(1–660) dimer; the presence of excess DNA raises the rate by about 5-fold to about 0.3 ATP hydrolyzed per second per Top2-(1–660) monomer or 0.6 ATP hydrolyzed per second per Top2-(1–660) dimer. The magnitude of this increase appears significant, especially in view of a total lack of stimulation of the ATPase of Top2-(1–409) by DNA in the same buffer. Structural and biochemical studies suggest that the B′-subfragment in Top2-(1–660) is involved in the binding of the DNA by full-length yeast DNA topoisomerase II (12Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 32Li W. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31190-31195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 33Berger J.M. Fass D. Wang J.C. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7876-7881Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 34Liu Q. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and interaction between this subfragment and DNA in the 100 mm salt buffer is presumably responsible for the observed stimulation of the ATPase activity by DNA. The stimulation of the ATPase activity of Top2-(1–660) by DNA also suggests that the DNA-bound Top2-(1–660) dimer may differ in conformation from the unbound dimer, such that the pair of ATPase domains in a DNA-bound Top2-(1–660) can more easily come into contact to form the active ATPase pockets. It has recently been suggested that the pair of B′-subfragments in yeast DNA topoisomerase II may undergo large displacements during a reaction cycle (33Berger J.M. Fass D. Wang J.C. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7876-7881Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 34Liu Q. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and therefore a pair of B′-subfragments in the unbound and DNA-bound fragments may assume different positions relative to other parts of the fragments. The coordinated alignment of various structural domains of a DNA-bound full-length or NH2-terminal fragment of DNA topoisomerase II is probably the key to efficiently catalysis of ATP hydrolysis. Presumably, the relative positions of various structural domains are also modified by additional interactions, such as interactions between the protein and ATP or its hydrolytic products, transesterification between the enzyme and the DNA G-segment, and interactions between the protein and a DNA T-segment. Mutations replacing residues involved in DNA cleavage and rejoining, for example, have been shown to affect the ATPase activity of the enzyme (35Morris S.K. Harkins T.T. Tennyson R.B. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3446-3452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interpretation of the effect of DNA on the ATPase activity of the 76-kDa yeast Top2-(1–660) in the 50 mm salt medium is complicated by the rise and fall of the ATPase activity with increasing DNA concentration. The maximal rate occurs around a stoichiometric ratio of about 40 DNA base pairs per Top2-(1–660) monomer or 80 DNA base pairs per Top2-(1–660) dimer. This type of rise and fall in ATPase activity with increasing DNA concentration was previously observed with human and yeast type II DNA topoisomerases (20Hammonds T.R. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32696-32703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and a likely interpretation is that the occupation of certain weaker DNA-binding sites of the enzymes may hinder its ATPase activity. In the case of the 76-kDa Top2-(1–660) fragment, a contributing factor of this rise or fall might be that both the dimeric and monomeric form of Top2-(1–660) can bind DNA. Dimerization of the ATPase domains of a pair of monomers, bound to two separate sites along the DNA, would be dependent on both their relative orientation and their separation along the DNA. At high DNA concentrations, monomer binding might be significant and the larger separation between even a properly oriented pair of bound monomers would make dimerization less favorable. Finally, our results on the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by yeast Top2-(1–409) and Top2-(1–660) by ICRF-193 add strong evidence that the bisdioxopiperazines are interacting primarily with the ATPase domains rather than the B′ fragments. Because the bisdioxopiperazines appear to interact with the dimerized domains (11Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 609-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), the action of these compounds is presumably manifested after the binding of ATP. We are uncertain about whether these compounds inhibit the ATPase activity of a type II DNA topoisomerase by interfering with the binding, hydrolysis, or the release of the hydrolytic products of ATP. It is interesting to note that even at a very high concentration of ICRF-193, there is a significant residual rate of ATP hydrolysis. It is plausible that by trapping the closed-clamp form of a type II DNA topoisomerase, a bisdioxopiperazine may slow down one or more of these steps. We thank R. Ishida and T. Andoh for the sample of ICRF-193."

Cells expressing pleckstrin 2 undergo a dramatic shape change associated with actin rearrangement, including a loss of central F-actin and a redistribution of actin toward the cell cortex. Overexpression of pleckstrin 2 causes large lamellipodia and peripheral ruffle formation. A variant of pleckstrin 2 lacking both PH domains still had some membrane binding but did not efficiently induce lamellipodia, suggesting that the PH domains of pleckstrin 2 contribute to lamellipodia formation.

It was first described as a major substrate for protein kinase C (PKC) in platelets and leukocytes, and its phosphorylation has long been used as a marker for platelet activation. Although its function in vivo is unclear, heterologously expressed pleckstrin can affect second messenger-based signaling events mediated by phospholipase C, PI3Kγ, and 5′-inositol phosphatases (17Abrams C.S.

Overexpression and microinjection studies suggest that pleckstrin 1 is membrane-localized, induces a shift of F-actin toward the cell cortex, and participates in the production of lamellipodia (3Ma A.D. Brass L.F. Abrams C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1071-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These functions are tightly regulated by PKC-mediated phosphorylation of three residues (Ser113, Thr114, and Ser117) located near, but not within, the amino-terminal PH domain (24Abrams C.S. Zhao W. Belmonte E. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23317-23321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recently, a DEP (Dishevelled, Egl-10, and pleckstrin) domain has been described in pleckstrin 1, but the function of this motif is unknown (20Ponting C.P. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 245-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).Regulation of pleckstrin 1 is unique because it is the only described protein in which the PH domain is controlled by adjacent phosphorylation sites. In addition, tissue distribution studies show that pleckstrin 1 is restricted to blood cells. We now describe a new protein with homology to pleckstrin 1. In contrast to pleckstrin 1, pleckstrin 2 is found in a wide variety of tissues and is not an efficient substrate for PKC. In addition, it is bound to the cell membrane, and causes the production of large lamellipodia.CONCLUSIONAlthough pleckstrin 1 has long been known as a substrate of protein kinase C in hematopoietic cells, until now there has never been a known non-hematopoietic paralog. In that context, the present studies demonstrate that: 1) like the original pleckstrin, pleckstrin 2 contains a PH-DEP-PH organization; 2) its transcript is most abundant in the thymus, stomach, large and small bowels, and prostate; 3) in contrast to the original pleckstrin, it is not efficiently phosphorylated by PKC; and 4) it induces lamellipodia and ruffle formation. These observations raise a number of issues, including the mechanism by which pleckstrin 2 induces actin redistribution and the mechanism by which pleckstrin 2 is regulated.The first issue is the mechanism of pleckstrin 2-mediated actin changes. The original pleckstrin also induces cytoskeletal reorganization, although it tends to contribute to less lamellipodia. In the case of the original pleckstrin, many of its effects can be inhibited with a dominant-negative Rac and are independent of PI3K. 2A. D. Ma and C. S. Abrams, submitted for publication. Whether pleckstrin 2-mediated cytoskeletal changes involve Rac is currently unknown as is the role of other polyphosphoinositide-binding proteins such as gelson or villin. The observation that the pleckstrin 2 truncated variants of both PH domains may still bind to the cell membrane was an unexpected finding. Whether the association of this mutant with the cell membrane is mediated by its DEP domain is an area for further study, as are the circumstances that allow different regions of pleckstrin 2 to direct localization to different structures.The second issue is the mechanism by which pleckstrin 2 is regulated and the related issue of the identity of its potential binding partners. Pleckstrin 1 is phosphorylated by multiple isoforms of PKC, and its ability to induce actin reorganization is regulated by that phosphorylation. Pleckstrin 2 is not efficiently phosphorylated by PKC, and thus it requires an alternative means of regulation. During the preparation of this work, we became aware of the results by E. Skolnik and co-workers (25Isakoff S.J. Cardozo T. Andreev J. Li Z. Ferguson K.M. Abagyan R. Lemmon M.A. Aronheim A. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5374-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) who used a genetic screen for proteins that bind PI3K products. By this assay, both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal PH domains of pleckstrin 2 bind D3-containing phosphoinositides. It therefore seems reasonable to speculate that pleckstrin 2 is regulated by PI3,4P2 or PIP3 and may in turn be an effector for PI3K. We are currently investigating whether the intracellular distribution of pleckstrin 2 is affected by PI3K-mediated signaling and whether pleckstrin 2 moderates any PIP3-dependent signaling events such as the activation of Akt, PKC, or mitogen-activated protein kinase.

Pleckstrin 1 is a 40-kDa protein containing the prototypic PH domains at its amino and carboxyl termini. It was first described as a major substrate for protein kinase C (PKC) in platelets and leukocytes, and its phosphorylation has long been used as a marker for platelet activation. Although its function in vivo is unclear, heterologously expressed pleckstrin can affect second messenger-based signaling events mediated by phospholipase C, PI3Kγ, and 5′-inositol phosphatases (17Abrams C.S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1786-1790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Overexpression and microinjection studies suggest that pleckstrin 1 is membrane-localized, induces a shift of F-actin toward the cell cortex, and participates in the production of lamellipodia (3Ma A.D. Brass L.F. Abrams C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1071-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These functions are tightly regulated by PKC-mediated phosphorylation of three residues (Ser113, Thr114, and Ser117) located near, but not within, the amino-terminal PH domain (24Abrams C.S. Zhao W. Belmonte E. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23317-23321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recently, a DEP (Dishevelled, Egl-10, and pleckstrin) domain has been described in pleckstrin 1, but the function of this motif is unknown (20Ponting C.P. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 245-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Regulation of pleckstrin 1 is unique because it is the only described protein in which the PH domain is controlled by adjacent phosphorylation sites. In addition, tissue distribution studies show that pleckstrin 1 is restricted to blood cells. We now describe a new protein with homology to pleckstrin 1. In contrast to pleckstrin 1, pleckstrin 2 is found in a wide variety of tissues and is not an efficient substrate for PKC. In addition, it is bound to the cell membrane, and causes the production of large lamellipodia. CONCLUSIONAlthough pleckstrin 1 has long been known as a substrate of protein kinase C in hematopoietic cells, until now there has never been a known non-hematopoietic paralog. In that context, the present studies demonstrate that: 1) like the original pleckstrin, pleckstrin 2 contains a PH-DEP-PH organization; 2) its transcript is most abundant in the thymus, stomach, large and small bowels, and prostate; 3) in contrast to the original pleckstrin, it is not efficiently phosphorylated by PKC; and 4) it induces lamellipodia and ruffle formation. These observations raise a number of issues, including the mechanism by which pleckstrin 2 induces actin redistribution and the mechanism by which pleckstrin 2 is regulated.The first issue is the mechanism of pleckstrin 2-mediated actin changes. The original pleckstrin also induces cytoskeletal reorganization, although it tends to contribute to less lamellipodia. In the case of the original pleckstrin, many of its effects can be inhibited with a dominant-negative Rac and are independent of PI3K. 2A. D. Ma and C. S. Abrams, submitted for publication. Whether pleckstrin 2-mediated cytoskeletal changes involve Rac is currently unknown as is the role of other polyphosphoinositide-binding proteins such as gelson or villin. The observation that the pleckstrin 2 truncated variants of both PH domains may still bind to the cell membrane was an unexpected finding. Whether the association of this mutant with the cell membrane is mediated by its DEP domain is an area for further study, as are the circumstances that allow different regions of pleckstrin 2 to direct localization to different structures.The second issue is the mechanism by which pleckstrin 2 is regulated and the related issue of the identity of its potential binding partners. Pleckstrin 1 is phosphorylated by multiple isoforms of PKC, and its ability to induce actin reorganization is regulated by that phosphorylation. Pleckstrin 2 is not efficiently phosphorylated by PKC, and thus it requires an alternative means of regulation. During the preparation of this work, we became aware of the results by E. Skolnik and co-workers (25Isakoff S.J. Cardozo T. Andreev J. Li Z. Ferguson K.M. Abagyan R. Lemmon M.A. Aronheim A. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5374-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) who used a genetic screen for proteins that bind PI3K products. By this assay, both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal PH domains of pleckstrin 2 bind D3-containing phosphoinositides. It therefore seems reasonable to speculate that pleckstrin 2 is regulated by PI3,4P2 or PIP3 and may in turn be an effector for PI3K. We are currently investigating whether the intracellular distribution of pleckstrin 2 is affected by PI3K-mediated signaling and whether pleckstrin 2 moderates any PIP3-dependent signaling events such as the activation of Akt, PKC, or mitogen-activated protein kinase. Although pleckstrin 1 has long been known as a substrate of protein kinase C in hematopoietic cells, until now there has never been a known non-hematopoietic paralog. In that context, the present studies demonstrate that: 1) like the original pleckstrin, pleckstrin 2 contains a PH-DEP-PH organization; 2) its transcript is most abundant in the thymus, stomach, large and small bowels, and prostate; 3) in contrast to the original pleckstrin, it is not efficiently phosphorylated by PKC; and 4) it induces lamellipodia and ruffle formation. These observations raise a number of issues, including the mechanism by which pleckstrin 2 induces actin redistribution and the mechanism by which pleckstrin 2 is regulated."

The ribosome scanning model has been originally proposed by Kozak (1Kozak M. Annu. Rev.

Numerous studies have corroborated the model whereby the initiation complex is assembled near or at the 5′ end of the mRNA, facilitated by the interaction of the cap structure with the eucaryotic initiation factor 4E, and starts scanning the mRNA until the first AUG is encountered (for recent review see Ref. 2McCarthy J.E.G.

Well documented cases of internal initiation events are those of the uncapped picornaviral mRNAs (3Ehrenfeld E. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translation Control.

During evolution, IRESes have been utilized as targets for translation regulation during normal differentiation and development. For example, an IRES was shown to play a role in the translation of platelet-derived growth factor 2 mRNA that increases after megacaryocitic cells undergo terminal differentiation (10Bernstein J. Sella O. Le S.Y. Elroy-Stein O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9356-9362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). IRESes have also been found to mediate the differential translation of Antenapedia and Ultrabithorax during Drosophila melanogaster development (6Oh S.K. Scott M.P. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 12Ye X. Fong P. Iizuka N. Choate D. Cavener D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1714-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, no IRES has been shown to function in yeasts, despite the observations that the yeast cell-free system is capable of recognizing plant viral IRESes (14Altmann M. Blum S. Wilson T.M. Trachsel H. Gene. 1990; 91: 127-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as well as natural yeast leader sequences (15Iizuka N. Najita L. Franzusoff A. Sarnow P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7322-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Attempts to promote internal initiation in living yeast cells by using IRESes of poliovirus (16Coward P. Dasgupta A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 286-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and encephalomyocarditis virus (17Evstafieva A.G. Beletsky A.V. Borovjagin A.V. Bogdanov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have thus far failed. These studies were done with optimally growing cells. In their natural environment, however, yeast occasionally encounter starvation and enter into a distinct quiescent state called stationary phase (SP) (reviewed in Refs. 18Werner-Washburne M. Braun E. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 383-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 19Werner-Washburne M. Braun E.L. Crawford M.E. Peck V.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In the test tube, when yeast cells are cultured in rich media (e.g. YPD), nutrient consumption is gradual and entry into SP occurs in a stepwise manner. Thus, cells cultured in YPD display a characteristic growth pattern in which log phase is followed by a diauxic shift, a slow growth phase, and then by SP. During the diauxic shift, cell metabolism changes from mainly fermentation to aerobic metabolism (20Entian K.D. Microbiol. Sci. 1986; 3: 366-371PubMed Google Scholar), accompanied by morphological and biochemical changes (21Boucherie H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 385-392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Boy-Marcotte E. Tadi D. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Jacquet M. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Costa V. Amorim M.A. Reis E. Quintanilha A. Moradas-Ferreira P.

To preserve energy during SP, yeast cells shut off the transcription of most genes. Consequently, the global mRNA level is reduced about 35-fold (27Choder M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2315-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar,28Choder M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6984-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Protein production during SP is reduced even more dramatically (200–300-fold) (29Fuge E.K. Braun E.L. Werner-Washburne M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5802-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), suggesting that the availability of mRNAs is not the rate-limiting factor of protein synthesis. Instead, translation during SP is found to be inefficient or even actively repressed. Nevertheless, expression of a small repertoire of genes is not repressed in SP (18Werner-Washburne M. Braun E. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 383-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Werner-Washburne M. Braun E.L. Crawford M.E. Peck V.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 27Choder M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2315-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 29Fuge E.K. Braun E.L. Werner-Washburne M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5802-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It is quite possible that the control of this dramatic strategic change in gene expression requires SP-specific mechanisms for ensuring the synthesis of the small repertoire of proteins that are essential for life during starvation. Here we show that yeast cells are capable of recognizing an IRES element. The RNA element that functions as an IRES was found by serendipity and contains a sequence from the Escherichia coli lacI. Strikingly, the capacity to recognize this IRES is found in starved cells but not in growing cells. We therefore call this IRESstationary phase-induced IRES, SIRES. By adapting a colony color test, we utilized the ACT1p-UBI4-lacZ reporter, described under “Results,” and searched for mutants that failed to repress the reporter gene during SP. We thus identified a cell line whose reporter produced high levels of βgal in SP. Later, we discovered that the defect was not in the cellular genome but, instead, in the plasmid that underwent a rearrangement event. A series of experiments have demonstrated that the RNA element, which was responsible for the translational induction in SP, contains the sequence shown in Fig. 1B. Constructs are schematized in Fig. 1A. Construct 1 was described previously (26Meunier J.-R. Choder M. Yeast. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Construct 2 was made by inserting SIRES at the HindIII site, located in-between ACT1p and UBI4, into construct 1. For construct 3, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was amplified by PCR reaction, using OMC116 (5′-CCCAAGCTTGGATCCTAAAGATGA GTAAAGGAG-3′) and OMC117 (5′-CCCAAGCTTTCTAGATTATCATTCATCCATGCCATGTG-3′3′) as the forward and reverse primers, respectively.HindIII sites are underlined and were used to introduce the PCR fragment into HindIII site of construct 1 (betweenACT1p and UBI4). Two in-frame stop codons (marked by bold letters) are introduced immediately after the last codon of the GFP. XbaI was introduced downstream of theHindIII site and was used for inserting the intercistronic spacers of constructs 4–6. For constructs 4–6, intercistronic spacers were amplified by PCR technology, using primers that contained theXbaI site at their 5′ ends. The spacers were introduced in the single XbaI site of construct 3. All constructs were subject to sequencing analysis. Cell extract was equilibrated with Laemmli sample buffer and kept at room temperature. Ten μg were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Fluorescent bands were detected by exposing the gel to Image reader FLA2000 (Fujifilm) at 473 nm excitation and using the 520 nm filter. SIRES has been discovered by serendipity during a screen for SP-specific mutations (see “Experimental Procedures”). It contains a sequence from the E. coli lacIgene and a portion of a multiple cloning region. The sequence does not contain AUG or other codons that can function as translation start sites (Fig. 1B). It contains a high GC content (62%) and, by subjecting its sequence to a folding algorithm (foldRNA, GCG Sequence Analysis Package), was found to be capable of forming a highly structured molecule (ΔG = −43.8 kcal mol−1). To study the effect of SIRES on the translation we used the UBI4-lacZ, encoding a ubiquitin-βgal fusion that contains isoleucine at the junction between the two protein sequences. Shortly after translation, the ubiquitin is cleaved off the fusion protein, and the resulting βgal is short lived both in dividing (30Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar) and in stationary cells (39Paz I. Meunier J.-R. Choder M. Gene. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). This reporter thus enables the coupling between the level of the unstable βgal and the rate of its synthesis, even when this rate is decreased (39Paz I. Meunier J.-R. Choder M. Gene. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription of the reporter gene is governed by ACT1promoter fragment, spanning positions +1 to −472 relative to the firstACT1 ATG codon and covering the previously described regulatory elements and transcription start sites of the gene (32Munholland J.M. Kelly J.K. Wildeman A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6061-6068Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (construct 1 in Fig. 1A). SIRES was introduced downstream of the ACT1p and upstream of the UBI4 translation start codon in the ACT1p-UBI4-lacZ, as schematically shown in Figs. 1A and 2A,right panels (see also “Experimental Procedures”). The inclusion of SIRES had little effect on the level of the ACT1p-UBI4-lacZ transcript (Fig. 2B, compareleft and right panels). In contrast, the presence of SIRES had a dramatic effect on the level of the translated protein, shown in Fig. 2C (compare leftand right panels). During the logarithmic growth phase, the βgal level in cells carrying the SIRES-containing construct was two orders of magnitude lower than that in cells carrying the control construct (log lanes in Fig. 2C, compare theright and left panels). Thus, in logarithmically growing cells, the presence of SIRES in the 5′-UTR inhibits translation. This result is consistent with previous observations demonstrating that in yeast the inclusion in a 5′-UTR of an element that has the potential to form a secondary structure with a stability of ≥28 kcal mol−1 inhibits translation by at least 98% (33Vega Laso M.R. Zhu D. Sagliocco F. Brown A.J. Tuite M.F. McCarthy J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6453-6462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, other explanations for the SIRES-mediated translational repression cannot be ruled out. For example SIRES may give the mRNA a competitive disadvantage. The differential translation of the control mRNA and the SIRES-containing mRNA during log phase, when the translation of the former was higher than that of the latter, underwent a significant twist after the diauxic shift. Specifically, expression ofACT1p-UBI4-lacZ was repressed as cells exited the log phase (see above; Fig. 2, left panels). This result represents the general repression of translation characteristic of starved cells (29Fuge E.K. Braun E.L. Werner-Washburne M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5802-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 34Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 39Paz I. Meunier J.-R. Choder M. Gene. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of ACT1p-SIRES-UBI4-lacZwas induced after the diauxic shift, as demonstrated by the increase in the βgal product and activity (Fig. 2C, right panels). Note that, in post-log phases, the translation of the SIRES-containing mRNA was higher than the translation of the control mRNA, suggesting that the induction was due to activation rather than derepression. Interestingly, the increase in βgal level and activity occurred concomitantly with a decrease in the mRNA level (compare the changes in the mRNA levels in Fig. 2B, right panel, with those of the protein in Fig. 2C, right panel), indicating that the translatability of the SIRES-containing mRNA enhanced more substantially than the observed increase of the protein. Remarkably, the enhanced translation of the SIRES-containing mRNA occurred concomitantly with the general repression of translation. Attempts to identify the environmental stimuli that lead to the SIRES-mediated translational induction revealed that depletion of the sugar resulted in a specific translational enhancement of the SIRES-containing mRNA (results not shown). Two observations raised the possibility that SIRES mediates cap-independent translation. First, SIRES is capable of forming a highly stable secondary structure, which is likely to impede the cap-dependent ribosome scanning process (see above). Second, SIRES-mediated translation is enhanced when the bulk of the translation machinery is compromised, raising the possibility that it is recognized by a different or modified machinery. To study the mode of action of SIRES, a series of dicistronic constructs were made (Fig. 1A). Dicistronic constructs have been effectively usedin vivo to demonstrate the existence of IRES (3Ehrenfeld E. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translation Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 549-573Google Scholar, 5Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 6Oh S.K. Scott M.P. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 8Gan W. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5006-5012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As most ribosomes fail to continue through the intercistronic spacer, the translation of the second cistron is greatly reduced, unless preceded by an IRES. Using these constructs we attempted to answer the following questions. (i) Can SIRES promote translation of the second cistron by internal initiation? (ii) Is the translation of the second cistron influenced by that of the first cistron, or is the translation of the two cistrons controlled independently? (iii) Is the translation of the second cistron induced in SP like that of the SIRES-containing monocistronic mRNA? The gene encoding the GFP was chosen as the first cistron in the dicistronic constructs, and the second cistron wasUBI4-lacZ. (Fig. 1A). To enhance translational termination of the first cistron and to minimize reinitiation of the second one due to “leakiness” from the first cistron, we introduced an additional stop codon immediately downstream to the natural GFP stop codon. SIRES was placed as the intercistronic region, downstream to the stop codons. Three SIRES-less constructs were engineered to be used as controls. One control construct contained no intercistronic region (except for two restriction sites of 12 bp used for the constructions). Two other control sequences were introduced in lieu of SIRES; a 104-bp sequence (from the 5′-noncoding region ofUBI4) or a 282-bp sequence (from the 5′-noncoding region ofHAP4). To determine the effect of SIRES on the translation of both cistrons, equal amounts of protein, produced by the transformants with the different constructs, were separated by SDS-PAGE; the GFP level was assayed by monitoring its fluorescent intensity, and the βgal level was determined by Western analysis. Fig. 3B (lanes 14–17) shows that the level of βgal produced by the SIRES-containing dicistronic mRNA was almost undetectable in log phase cells and substantially increased in post-log phases. The induced synthesis of βgal in post-log cells occurred concomitantly with the observed decrease in the mRNA level (see below), indicating that the translatability of the SIRES-containing mRNA in post-log phases was enhanced even more than can be deduced from the observed increase of the protein. In contrast to translation of the second cistron, translation of the first cistron was high in log phase and lower in post-log phases (Fig. 3A, lanes 14–17). We suppose that the decrease of GFP translation in post-log phases is stronger than the observed decrease in its steady state level because GFP, like most proteins (29Fuge E.K. Braun E.L. Werner-Washburne M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5802-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), is highly stable in SP. The different expression behavior of the two cistrons indicates that, after the diauxic shift, the translation of the two cistrons is independently controlled. The expression pattern of the SIRES-containing construct was compared with that of the control constructs. In cells carrying the spacerless dicistronic mRNA no βgal was detected, indicating that following termination of the GFP translation no reinitiation occurred. It was demonstrated previously that reinitiation can occur in yeast and that the spacing between the sites of termination and initiation is important (2McCarthy J.E.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1492-1553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined expression of the second cistron in cells carrying the other control constructs. Indeed, the inclusion of either a 104- or a 282-nucleotide spacer in the dicistronic mRNA permitted little synthesis of βgal during log phase, which was detected only after overexposure (lanes 6 and 10 in Fig. 3B, lower panel). This βgal synthesis is most probably the result of translational reinitiation. In post-log phases, the level of the βgal expressed by these control dicistronic mRNAs declined (lanes 7–9 and 11–13 in Fig. 3B, lower panel). This is in contrast with the increase in the level of βgal expressed by the SIRES-containing mRNA (lanes 15–17 in Fig. 3B). In summary, the differences between the expression pattern of the control constructs and the expression pattern of the SIRES-containing construct indicates that the induced synthesis of the second cistron is SIRES-specific. We consider the possibility that the SIRES-mediated translation of the second cistron is due to reinitiation as unlikely because it is much higher than the translation of the second cistron of the control mRNAs. Furthermore, the observation that following the diauxic shift the translation of the two cistrons that are separated by SIRES is independently controlled (i.e. one is repressed and the other one is induced) strongly argues against the reinitiation possibility. Interestingly, the level of βgal produced by the SIRES-containing mRNA during log phase was even lower than that produced by the mRNA containing the control spacers (compare lane 14with lanes 6 and 10, in Fig. 3B,lower panel). This result is consistent with our suggestion that SIRES, which is not active as IRES in log phase, impedes the scanning-mediated reinitiation process. We then examined whether the SIRES-containing construct gave rise to one transcript that encompasses both GFP and UBI4-lacZ genes. Transcripts were analyzed by Northern blot hybridization using either GFP or lacZ as probes. Fig. 4 shows that the SIRES-containing dicistronic gene produced a dicistronic transcript, which migrated slower than the monocistronic transcript (comparelane 1 with lanes 2–5) and hybridized with both probes. The dicistronic message was by far the most prominent RNA species that was detected by both probes. In addition to this band, a few minor bands were detected after overexposure. These RNA species could not have promoted translation of the second cistron by an end-initiated scanning process for the following reasons: (i) no RNA species was detected that hybridized only (or preferentially) withlacZ but not with the GFP probe, indicating that no transcript has a 5′ end located downstream of the GFP open reading frame that might promote a cap-dependent translation of the second cistron, and (ii) the intensities of the minor bands were not increased after the shift from log to post-log phases. Because SIRES mediates an increase in the expression of the second cistron in post-log phases (see Fig. 3), this increase cannot be attributed to one of the minor bands. We conclude that the cells can support an induced translation of the second cistron during post-log phases only by internal initiation of translation (see also the note in the legend to Fig. 4). Taken together, the results shown in Figs. 3 and 4 indicate that translation of the two cistrons that are separated by SIRES is controlled differently. Thus, following the shift from log to post-log phases, when the translation of the first cistron decreases, translation of the second cistron increases. We conclude that, after cells exit the log phase, SIRES promotes the initiation of the second cistron translation from an internal site in the mRNA. Little or no internal initiation can be detected in growing cells. Previous experiments failed to identify IRESes in vegetatively growing yeast (see introduction). The lack of success of finding IRESes in dividing cells, taken together with our results that the capacity to recognize an IRES is found in starved cells, raises the possibility that putative IRESes are not recognized in optimally growing yeast cells but rather in starved, or otherwise stressed, cells. Cumulative data from several laboratories suggest that IRESes are best recognized when the main initiation pathway is compromised. The most remarkable examples are the observations that the activities of picornaviral IRESes (3Ehrenfeld E. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translation Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 549-573Google Scholar) and BiP IRES (4Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5795-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 5Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) are enhanced as a result of the inactivation of the cap-dependent mechanism. Similarly, when yeast encounter starvation, the overall translation declines by more than 2 orders of magnitude (29Fuge E.K. Braun E.L. Werner-Washburne M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5802-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 34Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We propose that a capacity to recognize putative natural SIRESes has evolved in yeast to provide a means to escape the general loss of the cap-dependent translation capacity, and that SIRES is fortuitously recognized by this machinery. Thus, putative natural SIRESes are likely to render the translation of some mRNAs, encoding proteins that are important for surviving starvation, independent of the main initiation pathway. SIRES can be utilized in the future to isolate factors that are capable of identifying IRESes during starvation. Identifying these factors may also help with the identification of natural SIRESes. It has been found that a yeast cell-free system, prepared from logarithmically growing Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, can recognize heterologous authentic IRESes (14Altmann M. Blum S. Wilson T.M. Trachsel H. Gene. 1990; 91: 127-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Iizuka N. Najita L. Franzusoff A. Sarnow P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7322-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) or yeast UTR sequences as IRESes (15Iizuka N. Najita L. Franzusoff A. Sarnow P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7322-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, natural IRESes have not been identified in living yeast cells. This discrepancy suggests that, for the identification of IRESes, the currently available in vitrosystems might be irrelevant to the biological systems. Alternatively, it is possible that the capacity to recognize IRESes exists also in log phase yeast cells, and the in vitro system reliably detects this capacity. However, this capacity is repressed in dividing cells, either because the cap-recognizing machinery competes very efficiently with the IRES-recognizing machinery or because dividing cells express specific repressor(s), or because of both possibilities. According to this view, one or more of these repressing features is lost in thein vitro system. Starvation-induced increase of translation has been previously demonstrated in the case of GCN4 (review in Ref. 35Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). In a series of studies, Hinnebusch and his co-workers (35Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) have shown that induction of GCN4 translation in response to amino acid or purine deprivation is mediated by four short open reading frames (uORFs) in the leader of its mRNA. The uORFs inhibit theGCN4 translation in nonstarved cells by restricting the progression of the scanning ribosomes through the leader. Upon starvation, the scanning ribosomes bypass the most inhibitory uORF, uORF4, and repression is partially relieved, leading to an increased translation of the GCN4 ORF (35Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Apparently, the starvation-induced up-regulation of GCN4 differs from that mediated by SIRES. First, up-regulation of GCN4 translation results from a derepression mechanism that is imposed by the uORFs, whereas the SIRES-mediated translation seems to be governed by activation. Second, up-regulation of GCN4 mRNA translation is cap-dependent, whereas that mediated by SIRES is not. We propose that during starvation, when the general cap-dependent translation is repressed (29Fuge E.K. Braun E.L. Werner-Washburne M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5802-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 34Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), there are at least two types of mechanisms that mediate the translation of a small repertoire of mRNAs whose products are important for coping with starvation.

Sodium balance is important for the maintenance of body electrolyte, extracellular volume, and blood pressure. The amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) 1The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; Ral-GDS, Ral exchange factor; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PI, phosphatidylinositol; kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; GRE, glucocorticoid response element; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; TAT, tyrosine aminotransferase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase. is expressed in airway epithelium, distal segments of kidney tubule, skin, bladder, colon, and sweat and salivary glands. In addition, ENaC is a member of the expanded degenerin/ENaC superfamily (1North R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and consists of at least three homologous subunits, α, β, and γ (2Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 3Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C.

Hypertens. 1994; 3: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Compelling functional and biochemical evidence suggests that all three subunits form a heteromultimeric complex and contribute to the optimal epithelial sodium reabsorption activity of the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel (3Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar, 6Firsov D. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C.

However, when expressed individually in aXenopus oocyte system, only the α-subunit can produce an amiloride-sensitive current. Both β- and γ-subunits are not functional on their own, but augment the channel activity of α-ENaC (3Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C.

Thus, the expression of a functionally active sodium channel is dependent upon the presence of the α-ENaC subunit. Indeed, different phenotypes were observed in α-ENaC(−/−) and γ-ENaC(−/−) transgenic mice that were generated by homologous gene targeting. For example, 50% of α-ENaC(−/−) mice develop respiratory distress and die within 24 h after birth from an inability to clear the lung fluid (9Hummler E. Barker P. Gatzy J. Beermann F. Verdumo C. Schmidt A. Boucher R. Rossier B.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), whereas none of the γ-ENaC(−/−) mice die within the same time period (10Barker P.M. Nguyen M.S. Gatzy J.T. Grubb B. Norman H. Hummler E. Rossier B. Boucher R.C. Koller B. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1634-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Although the composition, structure, and activity of ENaC have been well studied, the molecular basis for the regulatory mechanisms underlying the gene expression of ENaC subunits remains unclear. Results from studies by us and others have suggested that the transcriptional control of ENaC gene expression occurs in a subunit- and tissue-specific manner (Ref. 11Zentner M.D. Lin H.H. Wen X. Kim K.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30770-30776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar; reviewed in Refs. 12Grunder S. Rossier B.C. Curr. Opin. Nephrol.

For instance, the transcription of β- and γ-ENaC genes is up-regulated by the steroid hormone aldosterone in the colon, whereas the α-ENaC mRNA is constitutively expressed. In contrast, dexamethasone treatment is reported to up-regulate the steady-state mRNA levels of all three subunits in the colon and fetal lung. Moreover, vasopressin increases only β- and γ-ENaC mRNA levels without altering α-ENaC mRNA level in RCCD1 rat cortical collecting duct cell line (14Djelidi S. Fay M. Cluzeaud F. Escoubet B.

We have previously demonstrated that TPA treatment represses the α-ENaCmRNA level (11Zentner M.D. Lin H.H. Wen X. Kim K.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30770-30776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies also outline a putative pathway(s) by which extracellular signals regulate cell-specific ENaC expression. Therefore, studies that more precisely define the interaction between the cellular transcriptional machinery and signaling pathways are needed to provide a framework for understanding the mechanisms underlying the regulation ofENaC expression and the resultant electrolyte homeostasis. Nuclear hormone receptors modulate gene transcription, upon binding of their cognate ligands, by activation as well as repression (15Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). One of the best studied members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily is the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which plays an important role in physiology and developmental biology. Transactivation by GR requires binding of receptor homodimers to specific partial palindromic sequences in the cis-regulatory region of target genes, namely glucocorticoid response elements (GREs). In recent years, it has become apparent that a variety of other factors may have a profound effect on the transactivation potential of GR. For example, the phosphorylation status of GR (16Webster J.C. Jewell C.M. Bodwell J.E. Munck A. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9287-9293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and the formation of composite or complex GREs (17Pearce D. Matsui W. Miner J.N. Yamamoto K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30081-30085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 18Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar) can affect classical GR transactivation activity. Thus, although the GR is expressed in virtually all mammalian cell types, it is possible that the expression of a distinct set of GR-responsive genes is cell context-specific and may be modulated by other signaling pathway(s). Ras proteins are important signaling intermediates that convey signals initiated at the cell surface to various effector pathways in the cytoplasm. Ras exerts effects on cell transformation and proliferation, cytoskeletal structure, differentiation, and apoptosis. These changes may be mediated by multiple effectors, including Raf-1, Ral-GDS, phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, and other Ras-binding proteins (reviewed in Ref. 19Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), often at the transcriptional level. Even though both Ras effector pathways and gene regulation are characterized in molecular detail, the interface between canonical Ras signaling and transcriptional repression remains poorly described. Clearly, there are mechanisms, when appropriately cued, whereby signal transduction cascades operating via Ras activation would negatively modulate transcriptional events in the nucleus, ultimately leading to transcriptional repression. The human α-ENaC gene has recently been cloned and characterized (20Ludwig M. Bolkenius U. Wickert L. Marynen P. Bidlingmaier F. Hum. Genet. 1998; 102: 576-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A rat genomic DNA fragment harboring theα-ENaC promoter, first exon, partial first intron, and 5′-flanking region has been isolated and used very recently to investigate the α-ENaC gene regulation by us (11Zentner M.D. Lin H.H. Wen X. Kim K.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30770-30776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Since more than one transcription initiation site has been identified in both human and rat α-ENaC genes accounting for the polymorphism of α-ENaC transcript size (21Thomas C.P. Auerbach S. Stokes J.B. Volk K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1312-C1323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 2M. D. Zentner and D. K. Ann, unpublished observation. we have adopted a numbering convention that assigns the number +1 to the first base of the translation start codon. Previously, we have shown that the regulatory elements in a 1.4-kb (−1573 to −154 bp relative to translation initiator ATG) α-ENaC DNA fragment are sufficient to mediate the basal and the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathway-modulated expression of α-ENaC/reporter construct in transient transfection assays (11Zentner M.D. Lin H.H. Wen X. Kim K.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30770-30776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified a 508-bp DNA fragment in the 5′-flanking region of the ratα-ENaC gene that is required for transcriptional activation of the α-ENaC promoter and which also confers Ras-mediated repression. By using heterologous promoter constructs and deletion analyses, we demonstrate that a functional GRE and GR are required for both transcriptional activation and Ras-mediated repression. This is the first report of an α-ENaC enhancer with a dual effect, suggesting that its involvement in the transcriptional regulation of α-ENaC gene expression in salivary epithelial cells is via the cross-talk between Ras- and GR-mediated signaling pathways. This mechanism may also be responsible for the expression of the α-ENaC gene in different tissues. The rat parotid epithelial cell line Pa-4, also known as parotid C5 cell line (22Quissell D.O. Barzen K.A. Redman R.S. Camden J.M. Turner J.T. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1998; 34: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), was maintained as described previously (23Lin H.H. Tu Z.J.

Dexamethasone was obtained from Sigma, resuspended to 1 mm in ethanol, and stored in −80 °C. The anti-glucocorticoid, ZK98.299 (24Zhang S. Danielsen M.

Stallcup (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA), was stored at −80 °C as a 1 mm stock solution in ethanol. A series of reporter constructs encoding the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene were derived from α-ENaC/CATs, as described previously (11Zentner M.D. Lin H.H. Wen X. Kim K.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30770-30776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The −1.0α-ENaC/CAT, −0.7α-ENaC/CAT, and −0.5α-ENaC/CAT (Fig. 2) were made by a double digest of α-ENaC/CATs withSphI (vector)/HindIII, KpnI, and PstI, respectively. Vector-containing fragments were isolated, blunt-ended by T4 DNA polymerase (Promega, WI), and self-ligated. In addition, a 0.5-kb HindIII fragment ofα-ENaC (−1573 to −1066 bp) was excised from α-ENaC/CATs and ligated into aHindIII-linearized −0.7α-ENaC/CAT plasmid DNA in both sense and antisense orientations to generate (−1573/−1066)-0.7α-ENaC/CAT and (−1066/−1573)-0.7α-ENaC/CAT reporter constructs, respectively. A 0.2-kb DNA fragment extending from internal PstI (from vector via previous engineering) toPstI (internal) was deleted from (−1066/−1573)-0.7α-ENaC/CAT to construct the (−1066/−1573)-0.5α-ENaC/CAT plasmid. A series of unidirectional deletion mutants harboring the luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 3) were constructed as follows. The 0.5-kbHindIII α-ENaC DNA fragment (−1573 to −1066 bp) was PCR-amplified using primer pairs designed according to theα-ENaC DNA sequence and cloned into pCR2.1 vector with the Original TA Cloning® kit (Invitrogen) in either sense or antisense orientation. Subsequently, each insert was excised and unidirectionally cloned into pGL2-P reporter plasmid (Promega) to generate p(−1573/−1066)GL2-P and p(−1066/−1573)GL2-P, respectively. These two constructs were then double-digested on the adjacent KpnI (3′-overhang) and SpeI (5′-overhang) sites to create a single exonuclease III-sensitive end. Unidirectional deletions were carried out by digesting DNA fragments for various periods of time with exonuclease III according to the instruction of Erase-a-Base® system (Promega). The extent of deletion in each individual clone was determined by DNA sequence analyses. Site-specific mutations within or adjacent to the GRE in p(−1414/−1066)GL2-P were introduced by Transformer™site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) to generate Mt A and Mt B (Fig. 6A). A α-ENaC/CATsplasmid with point mutations on GRE site (GRE Mt; Fig. 7) was constructed by replacing a SacI/HindIII fragment containing GRE site with the same fragment from Mt B described above that carries mutated GRE.Figure 6Functional analyses of putative GRE as a regulatory element in GR-mediated transactivation and Ras-mediated repression.

The GRE- and AP-1-like recognition motifs areboxed. Mt A and Mt B represent mutant variants used in transfection assays. Sequences that are identical to the wild type are shown as dashes, whereas the mutated DNA sequences are shown in letters. Reporter construct (0.9 μg) was cotransfected with 0.4 μg of Ras V12 and/or 0.4 μg of GR expression plasmids as indicated. Luciferase activities of the wild type and mutant variants were assayed and analyzed as described in Fig. 3. B, the putative GRE in α-ENaC confers glucocorticoid response in the context of heterologous promoter. Three different reporter constructs were tested. Two constructs carry one and two copies of α-ENaC GRE encompassing sequences, −1334 to −1306 bp, upstream of the minimal SV40 promoter-containing luciferase reporter gene and the third construct, TAT(GRE)3TK/Luc plasmid, harbors three copies of simple GRE from tyrosine aminotransferase gene upstream of a minimal TK promoter. Pa-4 cells were cotransfected with 0.9 μg each of the above three con structs in combination with Ras V12 and GR expression constructs as indicated. Transfection with the empty vector pGL2-P is included as a control. The transfection, treatment protocol, and dual luciferase assays were carried out as described in Fig. 3. The luciferase activity in each extract of p(−1334/−1306)GL2-P-, p(−1334/−1306)2GL2-P-, TAT (GRE)3TK/Luc-, and pGL2-P-transfected cells, respectively, is arbitrarily designated as 1 (lanes 1, 5, 9, and 13). The level of induction for each construct, expressed as -fold induction, is calculated by dividing the normalized reporter luciferase activity in extracts from Ras-cotransfected cells (lanes 2, 6, 10, and 14), GR-cotransfected/dexamethasone (Dex)-treated cells (lanes 3, 7, 11, and 15), and Ras- plus GR-cotransfected/dexamethasone-treated cells (lanes 4, 8, 12, and 16), respectively, over that of corresponding vehicle-treated transfected cells (lanes 1,5, 9, and 13). One representative data set out of three independent experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7The α-ENaC GRE confers glucocorticoid response in the context of its own promoter.Salivary Pa-4 cells were transiently transfected with 0.9 μg of α-ENaC/CATs (Wt) or its GRE mutant (GRE Mt) with point mutations, as described in Fig. 6A, in the presence or absence of 0.5 μg of Ras V12 and 0.5 μg of GR expression plasmids, as indicated. Following transfection, the cells were either serum-starved for 8 h and treated with 10−7m dexamethasone (Dex) overnight (A), or cultured in the growth medium and treated with dexamethasone overnight (B). Transfection, normalization, and treatment protocols were as described in Fig. 3, whereas CAT assay was as described in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Reporter constructs, p(−1334/−1306)GL2-P and p(−1334/−1306)2 GL2-P, containing one and two copies ofα-ENaC GRE, respectively, were generated as follows: a pair of complementary and 5′-phosphorylated oligomers, which correspond to −1334 to −1306 bp of α-ENaC, were annealed by incubating 200 pmol of each oligomer in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 10 mmMgCl2, followed by heating to 85 °C for 2 min and step wise cooling at 65 °C (15 min), 37 °C (15 min), 25 °C (15 min), and 4 °C (15 min). The annealed oligos, which have a built-in 5′-phosphorylated XhoI overhang, were ligated toXhoI-linearized pGL2-P plasmid DNA. The DNA sequences and mutations introduced in all constructs were verified by sequence analyses utilizing T7 Sequenase 7-deaza-GTP Sequencing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as instructed by the manufacturer. Expression plasmids harboring Ras mutants of Ras V12, Ras S35, Ras G37, and Ras C40 were generous gifts from Dr. D. Johnson (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA), while glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression construct and a tyrosine aminotransferase GRE containing reporter construct, TAT(GRE)3TK/Luc, were kindly provided by Dr. M. Stallcup (University of Southern California). Plasmid DNAs were transiently transfected into Pa-4 cells using a LipofectAMINE™-mediated method (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (23Lin H.H. Tu Z.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27637-27644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In all experiments, 0.1 μg of Renilla luciferase plasmid, pRL-TK (Promega, WI), was included as an indicator plasmid to normalize for transfection efficiency. Total amount of DNA in each transfection of cells grown in a 35-mm dish was kept constant at 2 μg by supplementing with pCMV vector, as needed. To maximize the response of cells to dexamethasone treatment, the cells were serum-starved 24 h after the start of transfection by replacing growth medium with 0.05% serum-containing medium for 8 h, followed by adding 10−7m dexamethasone in the same medium. All plates were harvested 16 h thereafter. The CAT reporter gene analysis was carried out as described previously (23Lin H.H. Tu Z.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27637-27644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), whereas firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using Dual-Luciferase™ reporter assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instruction. All transient transfection assays were carried out at least three times independently. Total RNA (RNA) was isolated from Pa-4 cells using Trizol® reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as instructed by the manufacturer. The quality and quantity of RNA were determined by both spectrophotometric analysis and fractionating RNA on an agarose/formaldehyde gel (1.3% (w/v)/6% (v/v)), followed by staining with ethidium bromide to compare the ratio of 28 S to 18 S ribosomal RNAs. For Northern analyses, equal amounts of RNA (18 μg/sample) were loaded onto an agarose/formaldehyde gel, fractionated by size, transferred to a 0.2-μm nylon membrane (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.), and UV-cross-linked. All blots were prehybridized for 1 h in QuikHyb® (Stratagene). The hybridization was carried out according to manufacturer's instructions with32P-labeled α-ENaC probes that were prepared from an isolated rat α-ENaC cDNA fragment (bases 1–905) using a Random Primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). All blots were also reprobed with rat β-actin to ensure that the quality and quantity of mRNA between lanes were comparable. After hybridization, these blots were washed in a 0.1× SSC (0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) solution containing 0.5% SDS at 60 °C for 2 h with three changes of washing solution. The radioactive signal was visualized by autoradiography, where blots were exposed to films at −80 °C overnight, using BioMax TranScreen-LE (Eastman Kodak Corp.) to improve sensitivity. Blots were also quantitated through the use of electronic autoradiography with an Instantimager 228 (Packard Instrument Co). The amount of α-ENaC message was quantitatively compared between lanes after normalizing against that of β-actin. The Ras pathway has been recently reported to modulate epithelial sodium channel activity and expression in Xenopusoocytes (26Mastroberardino L. Spindler B. Forster I. Loffing J. Assandri R. May A. Verrey F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3417-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have shown that a downstream effector pathway of Ras, Raf/ERK, can down-regulate the expression of both the endogenous α-ENaC gene and transiently transfected reporter constructs harboring 1.4 kb (−1573/−154 bp relative to ATG) of the rat α-ENaC 5′-flanking region (11Zentner M.D. Lin H.H. Wen X. Kim K.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30770-30776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In order to more precisely evaluate the ability of Ras and its different effector pathways to modulate α-ENaC expression in mammalian cells, salivary epithelial Pa-4 cells were cotransfected with an α-ENaC/CATs reporter construct and an expression plasmid encoding a constitutively activated form of Ras (Ras V12) or a “single-effector” mutant, i.e. Ras S35, Ras G37, and Ras C40. The ability of each Ras mutant to modulate α-ENaC/CATs reporter activity was assessed. Among the three Ras “single-effector” mutants, S35 is able to activate Raf-1 but not Ral-GDS or PI 3-kinase, while G37 activates Ral-GDS but not Raf-1 or PI 3-kinase, and C40 activates PI 3-kinase but not Raf-1 or Ral-GDS (27Rodriguez-Viciana P.

As shown in Fig. 1, Ras V12 markedly repressed α-ENaC/CATs activities when cotransfected into Pa-4 cells (lanes 3 and 4 versus lanes 1 and 2). While the C40 mutant had no effect on α-ENaC/CATs activities, mutants S35 and G37 appeared less effective than Ras V12 in our system (Fig. 1). Although it is possible that the known differences in the activity and expression level of these mutant proteins (28Miller M.J. Rioux L. Prendergast G.V. Cannon S. White M.A. Meinkoth J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3718-3726Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) may have contributed to these results, it is more likely that both Ral-GDS and Raf/ERK signaling pathways are involved in down-regulating α-ENaCexpression. Previously, we have shown that MEK inhibitor, PD 98059, was able to block the inhibition of α-ENaC/CATs activity by Raf/ERK activation (11Zentner M.D. Lin H.H. Wen X. Kim K.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30770-30776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, the MEK inhibitor had a limited effect on Ras V12-mediated inhibition, 3H. H. Lin and D. K. Ann, unpublished observation.suggesting that an effector pathway(s) other than Raf/ERK may also have been involved in modulating α-ENaC expression. Since Ras V12 elicited the maximum repression on α-ENaC/CATsreporter activity, we used Ras V12 to elucidate the mechanism(s) that down-regulates α-ENaC expression. The results shown above and our previously published data (11Zentner M.D. Lin H.H. Wen X. Kim K.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30770-30776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) suggest that elements confined within the α-ENaC/CATs construct are essential for recapitulating the basal and Ras-mediated regulation of α-ENaC expression. To elucidate the cis-element(s) conferring Ras-mediated repression of the α-ENaC/CATs, we constructed a series of reporter plasmids in which truncated fragments of theα-ENaC promoter/enhancer were placed upstream of the promoterless CAT reporter gene. As shown in Fig. 2, removal of the first 508 bp from the parental construct, α-ENaC/CATs, reduced the level of CAT activity approximately 10-fold in Pa-4 cells transiently transfected with −1.0α-ENaC/CAT. Since basal activity was so low, the ability of Ras V12 to repress reporter activity cannot be accurately assessed. Subsequent deletions of 310 and 586 bp from −1.0α-ENaC/CAT, designated as −0.7α-ENaC/CAT and −0.5α-ENaC/CAT, respectively, resulted in minor variations of the basal CAT activity when compared with those from −1.0α-ENaC/CAT-transfected cells (Fig. 2). The reason for these variations is not clear, since they were not always reproducible. This dramatic decrease in basal activity indicated that a Ras-repressible enhancer(s) was located within the first 508 bp (−1573/−1066) of the 1.4-kb α-ENaC DNA fragment. To confirm this, we inserted the (−1573/−1066) fragment 5′ to the −0.7α-ENaC/CAT in both sense and antisense"

Wong-Staal F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 577-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The 55-kDa Gag precursor contains the structural proteins matrix (MA), capsid (CA), and nucleocapsid (NC), in addition to the p2, p1, and p6 domains (MA-CA-p2-NC-p1-p6) (2Henderson L.E.

The Gag-Pol polyprotein is generated by a −1 ribosomal frameshift at the NC-p1 junction, occurring with a frequency of about 5% of all translational events (3Jacks T. Power M.D. Masiarz F.R.

The 160-kDa Gag-Pol polyprotein therefore consists of the gag products MA, CA, p2, and NC, followed by thepol-encoded transframe protein p6* and the viral enzymes protease (PR), reverse transcriptase, and integrase. Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins are transported to the plasma membrane where assembly of type-C retroviruses and lentiviruses typically occurs (5Gelderblom H.R. AIDS. 1991; 5: 617-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 6Wills J.W. Craven R.C. AIDS. 1991; 5: 639-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). During particle assembly, the viral PR cleaves the Gag and Gag-Pol precursors into the structural and functional proteins required for viral replication (7Kohl N.E. Emini E.A. Schleif W.A. Davis L.J. Heimbach J.C. Dixon R.A. Scolnick E.M. Sigal I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4686-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). Although PR activity has been observed within the cytoplasma of infected cells, the cleavages that lead to the mature proteins incorporated into virions are late events, probably occurring in the last stages of budding as the virion is being readied for release from the cell (Ref. 8Kaplan A.H. Swanstrom R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4528-4532Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 9Vogt V.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 214: 95-131PubMed Google Scholar). The mature HIV-1 PR is an obligatory dimer of identical 11-kDa subunits, each contributing one of the two catalytic aspartic residues. In contrast, the cell-derived members of the aspartic PR family are monomeric enzymes with two Asp-Thr-Gly-containing domains (10Pearl L.H. Taylor W.R.

The unique dimeric structure of retroviral PRs is mainly stabilized by an antiparallel β-sheet formed by the interdigitation of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal β-strands of each monomer (14Wlodawer A. Miller M. Jaskolski M. Sathyanarayana B.K. Baldwin E. Weber I.T. Selk L.M. Clawson L. Schneider J. Kent S.B.H. Science. 1989; 245: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). The activation of HIV-1 PR, i.e. the dimerization and autocatalytic release from Gag-Pol, is a critical step in the viral life cycle. Premature processing by a PR activated too early results in separation of Gag and Gag-Pol domains from critical transport signals and prevents particle assembly and release, whereas inhibition of PR activation causes a severe defect in Gag polyprotein processing and a complete loss of viral infectivity (15Kräusslich H.-G.

However, the molecular mechanisms leading to PR activation are currently unknown. The 68-amino acid transframe protein p6* encoded by the pol open reading frame directly upstream of the PR region has not been ascribed a specific function and is in a position corresponding to that of the prosegment observed in other aspartic PRs. Based on this analogy, it has been suggested that the p6* region regulates HIV-1 PR activity in a manner similar to the pepsinogen propart peptide and that autocatalytic release of PR from p6* may be a triggering event in HIV polyprotein processing (21Partin K. Zybarth G. Ehrlich L. DeCrombrugghe M. Wimmer E. Carter C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4776-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22Louis J.M. Nashed N.T. Parris K.D. Kimmel A.R. Jerina D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7970-7974Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Support for this hypothesis has primarily been drawn from the observation that deletion of the p6* region in a Gag-PR precursor led to enhanced polyprotein processing in an in vitro translation system (21Partin K. Zybarth G. Ehrlich L. DeCrombrugghe M. Wimmer E. Carter C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4776-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have analyzed the interaction of HIV-1 PR and the viral transframe protein p6* in vitro using recombinant highly purified proteins. We report that p6* specifically inhibits mature HIV-1 PR activity. We have studied the mechanism of inhibition and mapped the region in p6* responsible for PR regulation. Based upon our results, we suggest a mechanism for PR activation different from that of zymogen conversion, in which the carboxyl-terminal residues of the transframe protein p6* block the substrate binding cleft of HIV-1 PR after amino-terminal autoprocessing of the viral enzyme. HIV-1 PR was expressed and purified according to Ref. 23Konvalinka J. Litterst M.A. Welker R. Kottler H. Heuser A.-M. Kräusslich H.-G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7180-7186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar.

The recombinant p6, p6*M1, p6*M2, p6*M3, and p6*M4 proteins were prepared essentially as described earlier for wild-type p6* (26Beissinger M. Paulus C. Bayer P. Wolf H. Rösch P. Wagner R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli M15[pREP4] as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase using the pGEX vector system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After cell breakage the soluble part of the glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins was affinity-purified using glutathione-Sepharose matrix. Afterward p6 and p6* proteins were removed from the matrix by thrombin digestion. The isolated proteins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The purification steps were monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (27Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar), followed by silver staining of the proteins and by Western blot analysis with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against purified glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. Protein concentrations were calculated from absorption spectra according to Gill and von Hippel (28Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal.

(29Richards A.D. Phylip L.H. Farmerie W.G. Scarborough P.E. Alvarez A. Dunn B.M. Hirel P.-H. Konvalinka J. Strop P. Pavlickova L. Kostka V. Kay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7733-7736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the unmodified tetrapeptide Ser-Phe-Asn-Phe-COOH were purchased from Bachem and Dr. G. Arnold (Genzentrum München, Germany), respectively. The chemical composition and purity of synthetic oligopeptides were confirmed by mass spectrometry. The ability of recombinant proteins and the tetrapeptide Ser-Phe-Asn-Phe-COOH to inhibit PR activity was determined in a continuous spectrophotometric assay by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 295 nm associated with the hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate Lys-Ala-Arg-Val-Nle-Phe(p-NO2)-Glu-Ala-Nle-NH2. Measurements were carried out on an Uvikon 930 spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments) equipped with a stirring device and a thermostatted cell holder maintained at 25 °C using a quartz cuvette with 9.5-mm path length and a final volume of 1.8 ml. Assays were conducted at pH 5.0, in 0.1 m sodium acetate, 4 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Reactions were initiated by adding enzyme to a final concentration of 22 nm active dimer, and progress curves were recorded for 4 min, thereby collecting 600 data points. The initial rate was determined as the slope of the absorbance change during the linear phase of the reaction (up to 2 min) using the software package of the instrument. The protein or peptide concentration that inhibited substrate cleavage by 50% was designated the IC50. Cross-linking reactions involved preincubating PR (100 nm total dimer) for 40 min at 25 °C with or without p6 or p6* (100 μm) in 100 μl of buffer consisting of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The homobifunctional cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS, spacer arm length 11.4 Å) was obtained from Pierce and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, which was added at 1% of the reaction volume, to give a final DSS concentration of 0.24 mm. Control samples received solvent only. Samples were reacted for 2 min, quenched with 40 mm Tris, and the proteins were precipitated by adding 10% trichloroacetic acid and 0.5 mg/ml sodium deoxycholate. The pellets were washed with ice-cold acetone and air-dried. The proteins were resolved on 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with polyclonal antiserum ARP413 specific for HIV-1 PR obtained from the Medical Research Council AIDS Directed Program Reagent Project. The bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Autoradiograms were scanned and cropped with Adobe Photoshop. Reaction products were quantitated with the Matrix program (QuantaVision, Canada) from the generated TIFF file. To investigate a possible regulatory function of the transframe protein p6* on mature HIV-1 PR activity, both proteins were produced in bacterial expression systems and purified to homogeneity. The effect of p6* on PR activity was then tested in a continuous enzymatic assay by monitoring the absorption change associated with the cleavage of a chromogenic substrate. The comparison of initial reaction velocities in the presence and absence of p6* revealed that the Gag-Pol transframe protein inhibits mature HIV-1 PR in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibition yielded a linear Dixon plot, and the IC50 value was determined to be 13 μm. In contrast, the equally sized HIV-1 Gag protein p6, which was produced and purified the same way, did not significantly alter proteolytic activity (Fig. 1). Due to the obligatory dimeric structure of the HIV-1 PR, there are at least two possibilities for an inhibitor (I) to influence PR activity. It can either bind to active dimers (D), thereby competing with substrate (5Gelderblom H.R. AIDS. 1991; 5: 617-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) binding, or it can bind to inactive monomers (M) thereby preventing dimerization (Scheme FS1). Given an earlier report that the carboxyl-terminal hexapeptide of p6* acts as a dimerization inhibitor of HIV-1 PR (31Schramm H.J. Billich A. Jaeger E. Rücknagel K.-P. Arnold G. Schramm W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we questioned whether full-length p6* protein also inhibits PR activity by interfering with dimerization. Since PR inhibition assays were started with highly concentrated dimeric PR and dimerization inhibitors bind exclusively to PR monomers, p6* can only act as dimerization inhibitor if significant dimer dissociation occurs during data collection. To test the dimer stability under our experimental conditions, we determined the time-dependent PR inactivation caused by dimer dissociation during preincubation in assay buffer. A plot of remaining PR activityversus preincubation time fits a first-order exponential and yielded an activity decay rate of 5.84 h−1 (Fig. 2A). Analysis of the preincubation mixture by Western blot showed that the loss of activity after 60 min does not correlate with the appearance of truncated forms of the PR (Fig. 2A, top). Due to the slow dimer dissociation under our experimental conditions, it seems unlikely that p6* has bound to PR monomers and prevented their dimerization.Figure 2Analysis of the inhibition mechanism. A, effect of p6* on time-dependent inactivation of HIV-1 PR due to dimer dissociation during preincubation in assay buffer. An aliquot of the enzyme stock solution was diluted into the cuvette containing assay buffer without (white circle) or with 5 μm p6* (black circle) or p6 (gray circle) to yield a final concentration of 22 nm active PR dimer. After preincubation times of 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 min at 25 °C, substrate was added to a final concentration of 25 μm, and the rate of substrate hydrolysis was followed spectrophotometrically. The remaining PR activity is represented as a percentage of non-preincubated PR activity. The curves represent nonlinear regression fits to an exponential rate equation. The data shown are representative of two independent experiments performed in triplicates with different protein preparations. For Western blot analysis (top), 10-μl aliquots of preincubated PR were drawn at the indicated times, resolved on a 16.5% protein gel (27Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar), and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane.

HIV-1 PR activity was measured at the specified substrate concentrations and either 0 (white circle), 5 (black circle), or 10 μm (gray circle) p6* as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Replot of the slopesversus p6* concentrations is shown in the inset. The plots are representative of two independent experiments performed in triplicates with different p6* preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further support this conclusion, we next studied the effect of p6* on the time-dependent inactivation of HIV-1 PR following dilution. For these experiments the enzyme was preincubated in the presence of either p6* or control protein p6, and the activity as a function of time was examined. As shown in Fig. 2A, presence of p6* decreased the rate of HIV-1 PR inactivation, while p6 had no significant effect on the kinetics of PR activity decrease. The finding that presence of p6* obviously results in a specific stabilization of the HIV-1 PR dimer suggested that p6* might bind to the active-site of the enzyme. This hypothesis was further tested in cross-linking reactions of HIV-1 PR. As both subunits of retroviral PRs equally contribute to the substrate binding region an inhibitor interacting with the active site should be able to shift the PR monomer/dimer equilibrium to the dimer form. In accordance with the kinetic data the presence of p6* in cross-linking reactions resulted in a stabilization of the PR dimer (Fig. 2B, lane 4), whereas the control protein p6 had no influence on the PR monomer/dimer equilibrium (Fig. 2B, lane 3). Other control polypeptides unrelated to HIV-1 but of similar size as the p6* protein, like lysozyme and aprotinin, were also found to be without effect on the amount of dimer (data not shown). The additional band observed inlanes 2–4 has probably resulted from autodegradation of PR between amino acids Leu5 and Trp6 (32Rosé J.R. Salto R. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11939-11945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Densitometric analyses of three such experiments revealed that p6* increased the relative amount of dimer by 12%, while presence of p6 had no significant effect on the relative amount of dimer detected (Fig. 2B, top). The type of inhibition of HIV-1 PR by p6* was further characterized by steady-state kinetic analysis. HIV-1 PR activity was measured with substrate concentrations of 10–50 μm and 0, 5, or 10 μm p6*. Fig. 2C shows double-reciprocal (Lineweaver-Burk) plots of the initial reaction rateversus concentration of substrate. The lowest line in Fig. 2C represents the results obtained in the absence of p6*. Increasing concentrations of p6* affected only the Km and not the Vmaxvalue, leading to a single intercept of the linear regression lines on the velocity axis of the Lineweaver-Burk plot. The slopes of the lines in Fig. 2C were replotted against the concentration of p6* and the result is shown in the inset of Fig. 2C. The linearity of this replot is indicative of simple competitive inhibition. The HIV-1 transframe protein p6* spans the sequence of two PR half-substrates (NC-p6* and p6*-PR) and contains an internal PR cleavage site between Phe8 and Leu9 (33Phylip L.H. Mills J.S. Parten B.F. Dunn B.M. Kay J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,34Almog N. Roller R. Arad G. Passi-Even L. Wainberg M.A. Kotler M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7228-7232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2C. Paulus and R. Wagner, manuscript in preparation. To map the region in p6* responsible for competitive inhibition of HIV-1 PR, we analyzed the inhibitory potency of p6* deletion mutants lacking either the internal PR cleavage site spanning amino acids 5–12 (p6*M1) or the four carboxyl-terminal residues that are part of the p6*-PR cleavage site sequence (p6*M2). These experiments revealed that p6* deletions affecting the PR cleavage site between Phe8 and Leu9 did not significantly impair PR inhibition compared with wild-type p6*, whereas the p6* mutant missing the carboxyl-terminal cleavage site residues exhibited virtually no inhibitory potential (Fig. 3A). Thus, we conclude that p6*-induced PR inhibition is dependent on the carboxyl-terminal cleavage site residues Ser65-Phe66-Asn67-Phe68. To examine whether the inhibitory effect of wild-type p6* is distinguishable from PR inhibition by Ser-Phe-Asn-Phe, we analyzed the influence of a synthetic oligopeptide corresponding to positions P4–P1 of the p6*-PR cleavage site (nomenclature in accordance with Ref. 35Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4697) Google Scholar). These experiments revealed that the tetrapeptide Ser-Phe-Asn-Phe-COOH alone is a rather poor inhibitor of HIV-1 PR activity (Fig. 3A, inset). The IC50 value of 581 μm for this inhibition is almost 45-fold higher than that for PR inhibition by full-length p6*. Thus, the four carboxyl-terminal residues of p6* are essential but not sufficient for HIV-1 PR inhibition. To further confirm the role of the carboxyl-terminal residues of p6* in PR inhibition, we tested whether the inhibitory potency of p6* can be improved by replacing the natural sequence Ser-Phe-Asn-Phe by Ser-Tyr-Glu-Leu, for which molecular modeling studies predicted stronger interactions with the substrate binding cleft of the HIV-1 PR. Indeed, the p6* mutant p6*M3 containing the carboxyl-terminal sequence Ser65-Tyr66-Glu67-Leu68was more active in PR inhibition assays than wild-type p6* (IC50 = 2.7 μm, Fig. 3B). In contrast, inserting the carboxyl-terminal residues Ser-Phe-Asn-Phe internally into the p6* protein resulted in a p6* mutant (p6*M4) with reduced inhibitory potency compared with wild-type p6* (Fig. 3B). Apparently, the sequence Ser-Phe-Asn-Phe must be freely accessible at the very carboxyl terminus of p6* to inhibit PR activity efficiently. In this report, we show for the first time that recombinant p6* protein acts as an inhibitor of mature HIV-1 PR activity, a finding that considerably extends previous observations suggesting a potential role of the pol-encoded transframe protein in regulating PR function (21Partin K.

Virology. 1998; 244: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). For comparison, neither recombinant nor synthetic p6 Gag protein affects PR activity in vitro (this study and Ref. 41Stys D. Blaha I. Strop P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1182: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This clearly demonstrates that PR inhibition is not common to all Gag and Gag-Pol cleavage products rather than specific for p6*. The IC50 value for HIV-1 PR inhibition by wild-type p6*in vitro is 13 μm. The binding affinity of p6* is thus very similar to that reported for the well-known inhibitor of aspartic PRs pepstatin A, which has been shown to block HIV-1 replication in cell culture when added to the culture medium in a concentration of 100 μm (42Darke P.L. Leu C.-T. Davis L.J. Heimbach J.C. Diehl R.E. Hill W.S. Dixon R.A.F. Sigal I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2307-2312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43von der Helm K. Gürtler L. Eberle J. Deinhardt F. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Given Gag protein concentrations >5 mm in the HIV-1 virion and a ratio of approximately 1:20 for packaging of Gag-Pol and Gag precursors, the p6* concentration in viral particles is at least 250 μm. Regarding the comparably low IC50 value, we strongly suggest an inhibitory function of p6* on PR activity also during viral replication. The possible molecular mechanism of p6*-mediated PR regulation has been controversially discussed during recent years. There is evidence fromin vitro translation experiments that p6* is wrapped around the PR in a manner similar to the pepsinogen prosegment and prevents premature precursor processing by rendering the active-site and substrate binding cleft inaccessible (21Partin K. Zybarth G. Ehrlich L. DeCrombrugghe M. Wimmer E. Carter C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4776-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It has been also proposed that p6* affects PR activation by interfering with dimerization of PR domains in Gag-Pol precursors (37Zybarth G. Carter C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3878-3884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blockage of the release of mature PR from a Gag-PR polyprotein by introducing mutations into the amino-terminal cleavage site of the PR domain suggested another, different mechanism of p6*-induced PR regulation. Examination of the PR species generated in this experiment after autoprocessing in E. coli revealed several extended PR forms with amino termini in p6*. These 14–18-kDa p6*-PR intermediates do not appear to be hydrolyzed readily and have been proposed to occupy the substrate binding cleft of the PR precursor, thereby delaying the extent of overall processing (38Zybarth G. Kräusslich H.-G. Partin K. Carter C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 240-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While the molecular details of p6*-PR interaction are difficult to explore by means of cellular systems, the use of quantitative in vitro assays for study of p6* and PR as purified proteins allowed us to carefully analyze the molecular mechanism of p6*-mediated PR inhibition. Our data demonstrate that p6* is a competitive inhibitor of mature HIV-1 PR activity and that PR regulation is dependent on carboxyl-terminal residues Ser65-Phe66-Asn67-Phe68of p6*. By contrast, Schramm and colleagues (31Schramm H.J. Billich A. Jaeger E. Rücknagel K.-P. Arnold G. Schramm W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) have reported that synthetic hexapeptide Thr-Val-Ser-Phe-Asn-Phe, which corresponds to p6* residues 63–68, is a dimerization inhibitor of HIV-1 PR activityin vitro. In this study a rapid equilibrium assumption for PR dissociation was used for both the collection and treatment of kinetic data. Our results show, however, that HIV-1 PR dissociation is rather slow at pH 5.0 and 25 °C. This observation is in perfect agreement with data from Darke and colleagues (44Darke P.L. Jordan S.P. Hall D.L. Zugay J.A. Shafer J.A. Kuo L.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), who applied subunit exchange to investigate the interconversion between the active dimer of HIV-1 PR and its inactive monomers . The Asp25 → Asn PR subunit used in this study may be regarded as the ideal dimerization inhibitor, since it is, except for the Asp25 → Asn substitution, indistinguishable from the native subunit. However, even with this perfect dimerization inhibitor, at least 30 min were needed to obtain full PR inhibition at pH 5.5 and 30 °C. In addition to the carboxyl-terminal hexapeptide, the amino-terminal octapeptide Phe-Leu-Arg-Glu-Asp-Leu-Ala-Phe of p6* has also been shown to act as inhibitor of mature HIV-1 PR activity (Ki = 98 ± 10 μm) (39Louis J.M. Dyda F. Nashed N.T. Kimmel A.R. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the carboxyl terminus of p6*, PR inhibition by its amino terminus is dependent on a protonated form of a group with a pKa of 3.8. Thus, it is conceivable that both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal region of p6* may play a pH-dependent role in regulating HIV-1 PR activity. Studies on the in vivo processing of Gag-Pol have been restricted by the short lifetime of Gag-Pol cleavage intermediates. Therefore, the mechanism of PR activation and the pathway of Gag-Pol maturation are still far from clear. Moreover, little is known about what inhibits the proteolytic activity of HIV-1 PR after it has completed precursor processing during the maturation phase of the viral life cycle. Gag-Pol polyproteins are tightly co-packaged as a Gag shell in a ratio of about 1 to 20 in immature virions. Due to the tight packaging, the motion of Gag-Pol inside of the Gag shell and the accessibility of cleavage sites for PR enclosed in Gag-Pol seem to be extremely limited. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume the cleavage at the amino terminus of HIV-1 PR and the release of PR from Gag to be an early event in the proteolytic cascade. In support of this view, peptide substrates representing the p6*-PR cleavage site have been demonstrated to have a relatively low Km compared with oligopeptides corresponding to other Gag or Pol cleavage sites (reviewed in Ref. 45Dunn B.M. Gustchina A. Wlodawer A. Kay J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 241: 254-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), suggesting that this might be indeed the first site to be attacked in the HIV-1 precursor proteins. Based upon our results, we presume that after amino-terminal autoprocessing the free carboxyl-terminal end of p6* may function to block the substrate binding cleft of the PR precursor and prevent Gag and Gag-Pol processing until the polyproteins are confined in budding particles and readied for further maturation. As soon as viral maturation has been completed, p6* might additionally function in restricting HIV-1 PR activity in released particles in order to prevent unspecific degradation of viral proteins. Such product inhibition has also been proposed for the Gag-derived p2 peptide, which blocks HIV-1 PR activityin vitro with an efficiency similar to that of wild-type p6* (46Misumi S. Kudo A. Azuma R. Tomonaga M. Furuishi K. Shoji S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The finding that the p2 domain regulates sequential proteolytic processing required to produce fully infectious virions (47Pettit S.C. Moody M.D. Wehbie R.S. Kaplan A.H. Nantermet P.V. Klein C.A. Swanstrom R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 8017-8027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) clearly indicates that an in vitro binding affinity in the low micromolar range is basically sufficient to modulate HIV-1 protease activity during viral replication. Thus, in sum, our results provide strong evidence for the idea that the Gag-Pol transframe protein p6* is also involved in regulation of HIV-1 PR activity during viral replication. We are grateful to D. Bailey and M. Page for antiserum to HIV-1 PR, which was obtained from the Medical Research Council AIDS Directed Program Reagent Project."
https://openalex.org/W2068416575,"Activation of Gqprotein-coupled receptors can either stimulate or inhibit cell growth. Previously, these opposite effects were explained by differences in the cell models. Here we show that activation of m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors ectopically expressed in NIH3T3 cells can cause stimulation and inhibition of growth in the same cell. A clonal cell line was selected from cells that formed foci agonist dependently (3T3/m3 cells). In quiescent 3T3/m3 cells, carbachol stimulated DNA synthesis. In contrast, when 3T3/m3 cells were growing, either due to the presence of serum or after transformation with oncogenic v-src, carbachol inhibited growth. This inhibition was not due to reduction of extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity because carbachol induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in both quiescent and growing 3T3/m3 cells. Investigating the cell cycle mechanisms involved in growth inhibition, we found that carbachol treatment decreased cyclin D1 levels, increased p21cip1expression, and led to hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product (Rb). Proteasome inhibitors blocked the carbachol-induced degradation of cyclin D1. Effects on p21cip1 were blocked by a protein kinase C inhibitor. Thus, m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors couple to both growth-stimulatory and -inhibitory signaling pathways in NIH3T3 cells, and the observed effects of receptor activation depend on the context of cellular growth.

Thus, m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors couple to both growth-stimulatory and -inhibitory signaling pathways in NIH3T3 cells, and the observed effects of receptor activation depend on the context of cellular growth. G protein-coupled receptors are found on virtually all cells and respond to a wide variety of regulatory molecules to influence differentiated cell functions including contraction, secretion, and ion transport. With the discovery that the mas oncogene coded for a G protein-coupled receptor (1Jackson T.R. Blair L.A. Marshall J. Goedert M. Hanley M.R. Nature. 1988; 335: 437-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), much interest has focused on the potential of these receptors to be involved in malignant transformation. More recently, activating mutations in thyroid-stimulating hormone receptors have been observed in ∼30% of thyroid adenomas (2Parma J. Duprez L. Van Sande J. Cochaux P. Gervy C. Mockel J. Dumont J. Vassart G. Nature. 1993; 365: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar), and mutationally activated luteinizing hormone receptors have been identified in a form of familiar male precocious puberty that results from hyperplastic growth of Leydig cells (3Shenker A. Laue L. Kosugi S. Merendino J.J.J. Minegishi T. Cutler Jr., G.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 652-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Thus, considerable attention has been paid to the growth and transforming potential of G protein-coupled receptors and their possible roles in cancer. It is known that activation of receptors that couple to the Gq class of G proteins, including the m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (m3 AchR), 1The abbreviations used are: m3 AchR, m3 muscarinic receptor for acetylcholine; cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; Rb, retinoblastoma gene product; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; FBS, fetal bovine serum.. leads to foci formation in these cells (4Gutkind J.S.

Biol. 1994; 14: 7943-7952Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The ability of these receptors to mediate an agonist-dependent formation of foci in these cells has led to them being referred to as “transforming receptors” (6Stephens E.V. Kalinec G. Brann M.R. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 19-26PubMed Google Scholar). However, m3 AchRs and other Gq protein-linked receptors have also been shown to act as agonist-dependent tumor suppressors in a variety of transformed cells including Chinese hamster ovary cells (7Felder C.C. MacArthur L. Ma A.L. Gusovsky F. Kohn E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1706-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Detjen K. Yang J. Logsdon C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 952-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The ability of these receptors to either stimulate or inhibit cell growth has been attributed to differences in the cell models. The mechanisms involved in these cell type-dependent differences in growth response are unknown (4Gutkind J.S. Novotny E.A. Brann M.R. Robbins K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4703-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 10Gutkind J.S. Robbins K.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This is a difficult problem because these receptors are able to activate a wide variety of cellular signaling pathways including increases in intracellular Ca2+, phospholipids, and cyclic AMP (11Felder C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the same receptor may generate more than one set of intracellular second messengers, and considerable cross-talk exists between signaling cascades. In addition, some of the elevated second messengers, such as cyclic AMP, can have either stimulatory or inhibitory effects on cellular kinase cascades and cell growth, depending upon the cell model. The mechanisms responsible for the transforming and growth promoting effects of G protein-linked receptor activation are currently a highly active area of investigation. Considerable progress has been made in elucidating the growth stimulatory effects of these receptors. The family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) has turned out to be a central component of G protein-activated intracellular signaling pathways controlling cell proliferation and transformation (12Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 13Dhanasekaran N. Tsim S.T. Dermott J.M. Onesime D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1383-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The ability of m3 AchRs to form foci has been shown to be dependent on ras (5Mattingly R.R. Sorisky A. Brann M.R. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7943-7952Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Xu N. McCormick F. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 597-601PubMed Google Scholar). ras is an upstream activator of MAPKs including the ERKs. Activated ERKs, in turn, have been described to mediate the expression of the G1-phase cyclin D1. Cyclin D1/cdk4 complexes phosphorylate Rb, which ultimately leads to the initiation of the proliferative response (15Peeper D.S. Upton T.M. Ladha M.H. Neuman E. Zalvide J. Bernards R. DeCaprio J.A. Ewen M.E. Nature. 1997; 386: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Thus, together, these observations provide a model for the induction of growth stimulatory and potentially transforming effects by m3 AchR activation. Little is known concerning the growth-inhibitory mechanisms activated by these receptors. To investigate the growth-stimulatory and -inhibitory effects of Gq protein-linked receptors, we expressed m3 AchRs in NIH3T3 cells. Our studies confirmed that agonist treatment of m3 AchR-transfected cell populations leads to the formation of foci in a subset of receptor-bearing cells. As expected, agonist treatment of quiescent populations of these focus-competent cells stimulated DNA synthesis. However, when the same focus-competent cells were growing in the presence of serum, agonist treatment induced a profound transient inhibition of DNA synthesis. Furthermore, when these cells were fully transformed by v-src, activation of m3 AchRs inhibited cell growth even under conditions of serum starvation. Carbachol-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis was paralleled by an increase in p21cip1, a decrease in cyclin D1 and E levels, and Rb hypophosphorylation. Together, these data suggest that the effects of activation of m3 AchRs on cell proliferation can be either stimulatory or inhibitory within the same cell model and are influenced by the context of cellular growth. The construction of the pTEJ-8 expression vector bearing human m3 AchR cDNA has been described previously (16Yang J. Logsdon C.D. Johansen T.E. Williams J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1158-1164PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid bearing oncogenic v-src was a kind gift from Dr. Richard Jove (University of South Florida College of Medicine, Tampa, FL). Polyclonal antibodies to cyclin D1 and E, p21cip1, cdk4, and ERK1/2 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and the Anti-ACTIVE™ MAPK antibody was from Promega (Madison, WI). Monoclonal antibody to Rb was obtained from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit and sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Carbachol and TPA were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. The PKC inhibitor GF109203X (bisindolylmaleimide) was from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). The proteasome inhibitors PSI (N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu-(O-t-Bu)-Ala-leucinal) and LLnL (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal) were purchased from Peptide Institute Co. (Louisville, KY) and Sigma Chemical Co., respectively. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, calf serum, fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, streptomycin, amphotericin B, and LipofectAMINE were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The mouse NIH3T3 fibroblast cells (obtained from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with 5 μg of pTEJ8-m3AchR using LipofectAMINE and following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The day after transfection, the cells were replated into three new dishes. One dish was cultured in the presence of 100 μm carbachol, another dish was cultured in the presence of 0.8 mg/ml G418, and one dish was cultured in the absence of carbachol or G418. Foci were scored after 2–3 weeks. Individual foci were isolated with the aid of cloning cylinders and then selected in the presence of 0.8 mg/ml G418 to eliminate nontransfected cells. For replating assays, receptor-bearing cells were mixed with wild-type NIH3T3 cells at a ratio of 1:1000, and 105 cells were plated in a 35-mm dish. Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 100 μm carbachol, and foci were scored after 2–3 weeks. The m3 Ach receptor binding assay was performed exactly as described previously (16Yang J. Logsdon C.D. Johansen T.E. Williams J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1158-1164PubMed Google Scholar). DNA synthesis was estimated by measurement of [3H]thymidine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material. Cells growing in the absence or presence of 10% FBS were treated with carbachol (100 μm) for 24 h or as indicated, and [3H]thymidine (0.1 μCi/ml) was added during the last hour. Cells were precipitated twice with ice-cold 6% trichloroacetic acid. Cells were then removed with 0.1n NaOH, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Cells were scraped in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin), sonicated, and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. Bio-Rad protein assay reagent was used to determine the protein concentration. Samples of 20 μg of protein denatured with Laemmli buffer were subjected to electrophoresis on 7.5% (to detect Rb), 10% (to detect cyclin D1 and E, cdk4, phospho- and non-phospho-ERK1/2), and 12% (to detect p21cip1) SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred by electroblotting to Hybond membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were then incubated with the respective primary antibody, and horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody was used for detection with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To study growth regulation induced by activation of a Gq protein-coupled receptor, we transfected NIH3T3 cells with the pTEJ8 expression vector bearing the human m3 AchR cDNA. A clonal cell line was isolated from foci formed in the presence of the receptor agonist carbachol (see “Experimental Procedures”), as reported previously (4Gutkind J.S. Novotny E.A. Brann M.R. Robbins K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4703-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). This cell line was designated 3T3/m3 and was further characterized. Binding assays indicated that these cells bound 623 ± 46 fmol ofN-[3H]methylscopolamine per milligram of protein. This corresponds to a receptor density of approximately 112,000 receptors/cell. To investigate the effects of carbachol on DNA synthesis, 3T3/m3 cells were serum-starved for 24 h. Carbachol treatment of these quiescent 3T3/m3 cells led to a large (22-fold over the basal level) increase in thymidine incorporation within 24 h. This stimulation of DNA synthesis was concentration-dependent, with half-maximal effects observed at 4 μm, and maximal effects observed at 1 mmcarbachol (Fig. 1 A). In contrast to the effects observed in quiescent 3T3/m3 cells, when these cells were treated with carbachol in the presence of serum, carbachol inhibited DNA synthesis. Inhibition of DNA synthesis was concentration-dependent, with half-maximal effects observed at 1 μm, and maximal effects observed at 100 μm carbachol (Fig. 1 B). At maximal concentrations (100 μm), carbachol reduced DNA synthesis to 23 ± 7% of control. Inhibitory effects of m3 AchR activation on DNA synthesis were significant within 1 h and maximal after 12 h of carbachol treatment (Fig. 1 C). At later times, DNA synthesis rates recovered (150 ± 9.8% at 48 h). Thus, the inhibitory effect of carbachol in growing 3T3/m3 cells was transient. To investigate the inhibitory effects of m3 AchR activation under different growth conditions, we transfected 3T3/m3 cells with oncogenic v-src (3T3/m3-src). Carbachol treatment of 3T3/m3-src cells led to a concentration-dependent inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation whether these cells were growing in the presence (data not shown) or absence of serum (Fig. 2 A). Significant inhibitory effects were noted at 10 pm, half-maximal effects were observed at 0.8 μm, and maximal effects were seen with 1 mm carbachol. Treatment with 100 μm carbachol reduced DNA synthesis significantly within 1 h. Maximal inhibition (to 30 ± 4% of control) was observed at 12 h after treatment (Fig. 2 B). Thus, the time course of onset of carbachol-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis was qualitatively similar in v-src-transformed cells and in 3T3/m3 cells growing in the presence of serum. Comparable results were also obtained in spontaneously transformed 3T3/m3 cells and when 3T3/m3 cells were growth-stimulated using fibroblast growth factor (data not shown). Because of the suggested central role of MAPKs in G protein-activated intracellular signaling pathways, which control cell proliferation and transformation, we investigated the effects of carbachol on the activation of p42/p44 ERKs. Carbachol stimulated a large increase in ERK phosphorylation within 10 min whether 3T3/m3 cells were growing in the presence or absence of serum (Fig. 3). Carbachol also stimulated ERK phosphorylation in 3T3/m3-src cells (data not shown). The duration of ERK activation was longer in the serum-starved cells than in those growing in serum or transformed with v-src. Carbachol treatment had no effect on the ERK1/ERK2 protein levels in these cells (Fig. 3). Hence, the opposing effects of carbachol in quiescent and growing 3T3/m3 cells do not seem to be explainable by different effects of carbachol on the activation of ERKs. We next investigated the effects of m3 AchR activation on cell cycle proteins. 3T3/m3 cells were either serum-starved or cultured in the presence of serum for 24 h before treatment with carbachol for various times. In quiescent 3T3/m3 cells, the basal levels of the G1-phase cyclins D1 and E were low. Treatment with carbachol led to an increase in the expression of these cyclins after 12–24 h. Carbachol also increased the level of the cdk inhibitor p21cip1 within 1 h (Fig. 4 A). The expression of p21cip1 remained above control levels for at least 24 h. In quiescent cells, Rb existed primarily in the hypophosphorylated state. Carbachol treatment induced hyperphosphorylation of Rb at the same times that the cyclin D1 and E levels were increased. Levels of cdk4 were unaffected by carbachol treatment (Fig. 4 A). In contrast to what was observed in the quiescent cells, in 3T3/m3 cells growing in serum, carbachol significantly decreased cyclin D1 and E levels within 1 h (Fig. 4 B). The observed decrease was transient. A maximal decrease was noted after 6 h, and after 12–24 h of carbachol treatment, cyclin D1 and E levels returned to control levels. Carbachol induced expression of p21cip1 in growing cells within 1 h for up to 24 h in a manner similar to that detected in the quiescent cells. Consistent with the observed time course of the carbachol-induced decrease of cyclin D1 and E levels, treatment with carbachol led to a transient hypophosphorylation of Rb (Fig. 4 B). Carbachol treatment had no effect on the expression of cdk4. These same effects on cyclins D1 and E, p21cip1, and Rb were also observed in 3T3/m3-src cells (data not shown). This suggests that the carbachol-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis is likely mediated by the effects on these cell cycle proteins. Several different pathways have been described leading to the induction of p21cip1 expression; some of these pathways involve PKC (17Datto M.B. Yu Y. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 18Li R. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 189-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 19Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar, 20Livneh E. Fishman D.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). PKC activity is increased by activation of m3 AchRs. Therefore, to investigate the role of PKC in the carbachol-induced up-regulation of p21cip1 observed in growing 3T3/m3 cells, we tested the effects of the PKC inhibitor GF109203X (Fig. 5). Growing 3T3/m3 cells were pretreated with the inhibitor for 30 min and then incubated for an additional 3 h with carbachol. Treatment with the inhibitor alone had no effect on p21cip1 protein levels. In contrast, GF109203X treatment completely blocked the carbachol-induced increase in p21cip1 expression. Furthermore, incubation of the cells for 3 h with TPA, which is known to activate PKC, mimicked the effect of carbachol on p21cip1 expression (Fig. 5). Thus, the observed up-regulation of p21cip1 expression by carbachol in growing 3T3/m3 cells is likely mediated by activation of PKC. Recently, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has been shown to mediate cyclin D1 degradation (21Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanisms involved in the carbachol-induced decrease of cyclin D1 levels in growing 3T3/m3 cells, we tested the effects of the proteasome inhibitors LLnL and PSI on cyclin D1 degradation. The cells were pretreated with the inhibitors for 30 min, followed by a 3-h incubation with carbachol. The carbachol-induced decrease in cyclin D1 was completely blocked by both inhibitors (Fig. 6). Thus, activation of m3AchRs likely reduced cyclin D1 levels by activation of proteasomal degradation. Activation of receptors, which couple to the heterotrimeric G protein Gq, can have either stimulatory or inhibitory effects on cell growth. These differences have previously been attributed to differences in cell models. In the current study, we demonstrate that activation of a Gq protein-coupled muscarinic receptor can trigger both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on growth in the same cell. Growth-stimulatory effects of m3 AchRs on NIH3T3 cells are well known and have been the focus of much research (for a review, see Ref. 12Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). In contrast, the current observations of inhibitory effects of m3 AchR activation on NIH3T3 cell growth are novel. The observation that these inhibitory effects were not noted previously is likely explained by the fact that inhibition cannot be observed in assays designed to assess growth stimulation. Previous work has focused on investigating the effects of receptor activation in quiescent cells after serum starvation. Here we examined the effects of m3 AchR activation on growing cells. Growth was stimulated either by serum or by transformation with v-src. In either condition, carbachol caused a large and rapid inhibition of DNA synthesis. This suggests that the growth-regulatory effects of m3 AchR activation depend on the growth context of the cells. An understanding of the mechanisms involved in these growth-inhibitory actions may provide new insight into cellular growth regulation. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms involved in the growth-inhibitory effects of m3 AchR activation. Because the ERKs are known to be important molecules in mediating mitogenic responses, we investigated the possibility that activation of the m3 AchR might inhibit this pathway in growing 3T3/m3 cells. However, carbachol led to an increase in ERK activation under all growth conditions. Differences were noted in the duration of ERK activation in serum-fedversus serum-starved cells. The duration of ERK activation seems to be an important issue for proliferative responses. Recently, Weber et al. (22Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) have shown that a sustained activation of the ERKs by platelet-derived growth factor was required for continued expression of cyclin D1 in IIC9 cells. On the other hand, Pumiglia and Decker (23Pumiglia K.M. Decker S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) noted that sustained stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase/MAPK pathway by an inducible activated form of the Raf-1 proto-oncogene results in cell cycle arrest in NIH3T3 cells. In the current study, inhibition of DNA synthesis was observed within 1 h, a time point at which ERK phosphorylation was induced by carbachol under both growth conditions. Therefore, the observed differences in the duration of carbachol-induced ERK phosphorylation in quiescent and growing 3T3/m3 cells do not seem to be important for the observed differences in growth regulation. The most reasonable interpretation is that the effects of m3 AchR activation on the ERK pathway are not involved in the inhibitory actions. Two responses that potentially explain the growth-inhibitory effects of m3 AchR activation are the decrease in the level of the G1cyclin D1 and the induction of p21cip1 expression. These two mechanisms alone or in concert would be predicted to inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb and thereby block the entry into the S phase. The initial time course of p21cip1 induction and cyclin D1 reduction closely paralleled the decrease in cyclin E levels and the appearance of hypophosphorylated Rb in response to carbachol. This time course also correlated with the observed inhibition of DNA synthesis in 3T3/m3 cells. Thus, the effects of m3 AchR activation on these cell cycle proteins likely mediate the growth inhibition observed in 3T3/m3 cells. p21cip1 is known as a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and mediator of cell growth arrest (24Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3179) Google Scholar, 25Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5250) Google Scholar). The induction of p21cip1 expression by carbachol in 3T3/m3 cells was likely mediated by activation of protein kinase C because the specific PKC inhibitor GF109203X completely blocked the increase of p21cip1 levels. Additionally, the phorbol ester TPA mimicked the carbachol effect and stimulated p21cip1 in a similar manner. Previously, Yamamoto et al. (26Yamamoto T. Tsuda T. Hamamori Y. Nishimura N. Takai Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) found that TPA markedly inhibits DNA synthesis and proliferation of NIH3T3 cells. This could be due, at least in part, to the induction of p21cip1 expression demonstrated in this study. NIH3T3 cells have been shown to express PKC-α and PKC-ζ isozymes (6Stephens E.V. Kalinec G. Brann M.R. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 19-26PubMed Google Scholar). The atypical PKC-ζ, which is not activated by either Ca2+ or diacylglycerol in vitro, has not been described to be involved in growth regulation. However, the classical α-isoform of PKC has been shown to raise p21cip1 levels and induce growth arrest in a human epithelial cell line (27Frey M.R. Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Rollins A. Evans S.S. Black J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9424-9435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Stimulation of m3 AchRs increases PKC activity via accumulation of diacylglycerol generated by Gαq -mediated activation of phospholipase C-β. Taken together, the data support an intracellular pathway leading to the observed p21cip1 induction by carbachol in 3T3/m3 cells that involves a Gαq/PLC-β-induced activation of PKCα. The temporal pattern of p21cipinduction did not correlate with the reversal of growth inhibition. Furthermore, p21cip1 induction was also observed when quiescent 3T3/m3 cells were treated with carbachol, which resulted in a stimulation of growth. Thus, the data do not support the hypothesis that induction of p21cip1 is the sole inhibitory mechanism activated by m3 AchR activation. p21cip1 is found in active cyclin/cdk complexes in proliferating cells such that the stoichiometry between p21cip1 and cyclin/cdk complexes determines the cell cycle-inhibitory behavior of p21cip1 (25Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5250) Google Scholar, 28Zhang H. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 29Hiyama H. Iavarone A. LaBaer J. Reeves S.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2533-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Hence, p21cip1 may be involved in the initial inhibitory effect, but subsequent changes in the stoichiometry of other cell cycle proteins may overcome this effect. In contrast to the observed induction of cyclin D1 expression by carbachol in quiescent cells, treatment of growing 3T3/m3 cells with carbachol resulted in a profound decrease of cyclin D1 levels. The D-type cyclins are the first cyclins synthesized after mitogenic stimulation and are required and rate-limiting for G1progression. They complex with their catalytic subunits cdk4 and cdk6, which function as Rb kinases, and hyperphosphorylation of Rb allows the progression through G1-S phase (30Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar, 31Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Withdrawal of growth factors leads to a rapid cyclin D1 destruction and G1-phase arrest (30Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar). Decreased cyclin D1 levels have also been suggested to be involved in transforming growth factor β-induced (32Ko T.C. Yu W. Sakai T. Sheng H. Shao J. Beauchamp R.D. Thompson E.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3445-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), rapamycin-induced (33Hashemolhosseini S. Nagamine Y. Morley S.J. Desrivieres S. Mercep L. Ferrari S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14424-14429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and cyclic AMP-induced (34L'Allemain G. Lavoie J.N. Rivard N. Baldin V. Pouyssegur J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1981-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) growth inhibition. We observed a rapid decrease in cyclin D1 after carbachol treatment of growing 3T3/m3 cells. Diehl et al. (21Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) suggested that a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway mediates cyclin D1 degradation. In the current study, proteasome inhibitors completely blocked carbachol-induced cyclin D1 degradation. The mechanisms involved in targeting cyclin D1 for ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation are unknown. The carbachol-induced decrease in cyclin D1 was transient, and levels returned to control levels within 24 h. The time course of cyclin D1 degradation closely paralleled the observed inhibition of DNA synthesis. Thus, the effects of m3 AchR activation on cyclin D1 levels could explain both the initiation and the reversal of the observed effects on DNA synthesis. Further investigation will be necessary to understand the mechanisms involved in the effects of m3 AchR activation on cyclin D1. The physiological relevance of the transforming or tumor-suppressing abilities of these receptors is unclear. The NIH3T3 cell model suffers from the fact that these cells are pre-neoplastic, are differentially sensitive to transformation by different oncogenes, and can “drift” and spontaneously assume a transformed phenotype. Expression of Gq protein-linked receptors was not able to induce transformation in Rat-1 cells, another common model of cellular transformation (35Kahan C. Julius D. Pouyssegur J. Seuwen K. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Furthermore, conflicting results have previously been published with regard to the effect of expressing GTPase-deficient, constitutively active Gαq subunits in NIH3T3 cells. Wu et al. (36Wu D.Q. Lee C.H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) observed that mutant active Gαq and Gα11 subunits caused cell death when transfected into NIH3T3 cells. In contrast, others have reported that constitutively active Gαq could transform NIH3T3 cells (37De Vivo M. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19671-19674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Kalinec G. Nazarali A.J. Hermouet S. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4687-4693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it was reported that expression of the active Gαq mutant caused more cell death than oncogenic transformation in NIH3T3 cells, this was interpreted to mean that low-level expression resulted in transformation and higher levels of expression caused cell death (38Kalinec G. Nazarali A.J. Hermouet S. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4687-4693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is unclear how widespread or important the transforming effects might be. Another limitation to the ability of these receptors to mediate cellular transformation would likely be the requirement for sustained high concentrations of agonist. An alternative to high concentrations of agonist would be mutations that lead to persistent activation of the receptor or the G proteins. Mutant forms of Gαq or other members of the Gαq subunit family or receptors that couple to these G proteins have not been identified to date in any tumors or genetic disorder. If this pathway were highly transforming, then one would expect to find numerous examples, considering the ubiquitous nature of these receptors. In summary, the current study shows that Gq protein-linked receptors couple to both inhibitory and stimulatory signaling pathways. Thus, activation of these receptors can have a variety of effects on cell growth, depending upon the cell model, the receptor level, the assay conditions, and the time of observation. These factors help to explain the apparent conflicts existing in the literature with regard to the growth effects of these receptors. An understanding of the growth inhibitory pathways activated by these receptors may lead to important new insights into cellular growth regulation in health and disease. We thank Drs. Jessica Schwartz, Ormond MacDougald, and Paul Cook for critical review of the manuscript."

We have purified native and recombinant forms of gpI3L and characterized both the DNA-binding reaction and the structural properties of DNA-protein complexes. The purified proteins displayed anomalous electrophoretic properties in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, behaving as if they were 4-kDa larger than the true mass. Agarose gel shift analysis was used to monitor the formation of complexes composed of single-stranded DNA plus gpI3L protein. These experiments detected two different DNA binding modes whose formation was dependent upon the protein density. The transition between the two binding modes occurred at a nucleotide to protein ratio of about 31 nucleotides per gpI3L monomer. S1 nuclease protection assay revealed that at saturating protein densities, each gpI3L monomer occludes 9.5 ± 2.5 nucleotides. In the presence of magnesium, gpI3L promoted the formation of large DNA aggregates from which double-stranded DNA was excluded. Electron microscopy showed that, in the absence of magnesium and at low protein densities, gpI3L forms beaded structures on DNA. At high protein density the complexes display a smoother and less compacted morphology. In the presence of magnesium the complexes contained long fibrous and tangled arrays. These results suggest that gpI3L can form octameric complexes on DNA much like those formed by Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA protein.

Moreover, the capacity to aggregate DNA may provide an environment in which hybrid DNA formation could occur during DNA replication. Poxviruses are large DNA viruses which replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Viral replication depends upon a viral-encoded DNA polymerase and probably utilizes a “rolling hairpin” mechanism (reviewed in Ref. 1Traktman P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 163: 93-123PubMed Google Scholar). This replication scheme is attractive, because it can account for the concatemeric intermediates formed in infected cells and the absence of a virus-encoded DNA primase. The displacement of single-stranded replicative intermediates also provide substrates for a simple recombination model in which recombinant molecules originate as hybrid duplexes formed through the annealing of complementary single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-strand DNA; SSB, ssDNA-binding protein; nt, nucleotide(s). Such a scheme rationalizes the extraordinarily high frequency of genetic recombination seen in poxvirus-infected cells (2Evans D.H. Stuart D. McFadden G. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 367-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the abundance of heteroduplex DNA formed at the onset of DNA replication (3Fisher C. Parks R.J. Lauzon M.L. Evans D.H. Genetics. 1991; 129: 7-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the inextricable linkage between poxviral DNA replication and genetic recombination (4Merchlinsky M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2030-2035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The single-stranded DNAs involved in these replication and recombination reactions do not exist in an uncomplexed state inside cells. Indeed, a number of new DNA-binding proteins are synthesized when the poxvirus vaccinia infects a cell. Some of these proteins are expressed late in the infective cycle and probably aid in the condensation and packaging of the double-stranded viral genome. However, a 34–35-kDa phosphoprotein with a high affinity for ssDNA is expressed early and at intermediate times post-infection and can be purified from vaccinia replication complexes (5Polisky B. Kates J. Virology. 1972; 49: 168-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 6Sarov I. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1973; 52: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Nowakowski M. Bauer W. Kates J. Virology. 1978; 86: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The protein was subsequently shown to form an association with the viral ribonucleotide reductase and to be encoded by the vaccinia virus I3L gene (8Davis R.E. Mathews C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that gpI3L is an important component of the poxviral replicative complex which binds to exposed ssDNA and may ensure that dATP synthesis, which might otherwise trigger apoptosis (9Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4462) Google Scholar), is localized near sites of DNA replication. Research conducted in P. Traktman's laboratory (10Rochester S.C. Traktman P. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2917-2926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that gpI3L is almost certainly an essential gene product and strongly supports the contention that it is a key component of the viral replication and/or repair machinery. Whether gpI3L plays any role in promoting poxviral recombination is unknown. However, there exists abundant genetic and biochemical evidence showing that single-strand DNA-binding proteins (SSB) serve a key role in bacteriophage recombination. For example, the λ Red recombination pathway depends upon a phage-encoded 5′-3′ exonuclease, Redα, and a SSB called Redβ. Redβ protein not only promotes DNA renaturation in vitro (11Kmiec E. Holloman W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12636-12639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but also catalyzes strand transfer (12Li Z. Karakousis G. Chiu S.K. Reddy G. Radding C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) by binding to the hybrid DNA which forms during strand annealing. This explains how the λ Red recombination pathway produces long hybrid joints in vivo in the absence ofEscherichia coli RecA protein (13Stahl M.M. Thomason L. Poteete A.R. Tarkowski T. Kuzminov A. Stahl F.W. Genetics. 1997; 147: 961-977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacteriophage T7 SSB (gene 2.5) also catalyzes joint molecule formation and, in the presence of the gene 4 helicase, facilitates efficient polar DNA strand transfer (14Kong D. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2010-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This again permits high-frequency T7 recombination even inrecA E. coli. Much less is known about the SSBs encoded by mammalian viruses because such viruses are not so amenable to genetic analysis as are bacteriophage. However, biochemical studies have shown that the herpes simplex virus SSB (ICP8) can catalyze renaturation of complementary DNA strands and strand transfer in vitro (15Dutch R.E. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6945-6949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,16Bortner C. Hernandez T.R. Lehman I.R. Griffith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Herpes simplex virus-1 catalyzes an efficient replication-dependent recombination reaction (17Dutch R.E. Bianchi V. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3084-3089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and these biochemical properties suggest that ICP8 could catalyze step(s) in the viral recombination reaction. In this article we have examined the DNA binding and aggregation properties of native and recombinant vaccinia virus gpI3L. The binding properties of SSBs are of particular interest because these properties vary depending on solution conditions and may influence how SSBs function in DNA replication, recombination, and repair. For example,E. coli SSB exhibits three distinct DNA binding modes (with binding site sizes of 35 ± 2, 56 ± 3, and 65 ± 3 nucleotides per SSB tetramer) of which the (SSB)35 binding mode is favored at high binding density (29Bujalowski W. Overman L.B. Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4629-4640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electron microscopic analysis has further shown that interconversion between these binding modes alters the structure of each complex, with a “beaded” structure being seen at low SSB-to-DNA ratios (where the (SSB)56 and/or the (SSB)65 forms are favored) and a “smooth-contoured” complex (27Griffith J.D. Harris L.D. Register J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1984; 49: 553-559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) being seen under conditions favoring the (SSB)35 binding mode (29Bujalowski W. Overman L.B. Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4629-4640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar trends in binding mode transitions have also been observed usingSaccharomyces cerevisiae yRPA proteins. Our studies with vaccinia single-strand DNA-binding protein show that one can form complexes composed of gpI3L and ssDNA which likewise exhibit different structures depending upon the binding conditions. These complexes range in structure from simple “beads on strings” to huge, complex, DNA-protein aggregates. Poxviruses are known to very efficiently replicate and recombine transfected DNAs via a pathway that generates great quantities of heteroduplex DNA (2Evans D.H. Stuart D. McFadden G. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 367-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Fisher C. Parks R.J. Lauzon M.L. Evans D.H. Genetics. 1991; 129: 7-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18DeLange A.M. McFadden G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 614-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our observations provide some insights into the macromolecular complexes which may constitute components of this pathway. Vaccinia virus strain WR was obtained from the America Type Culture Collection and propagated on HeLa cells.E. coli strain DE142 (BL21 DE3 recApLysS) was constructed in this laboratory (19Zhang W. Evans D.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4620-4627Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). E. coli strain HS-1 (JM103 thy−) was obtained from Dr. H. Schellhorn (McMaster University). Single-stranded and double-stranded M13mp19 phage DNAs were purified as described previously (20Zhang W. Evans D.H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 204-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and φX174 purchased from New England Biolabs. 3H-Labeled DNA was prepared by infecting 1 liter of E. coli strain HS-1 with M13mp19 phage in the presence of 1 mCi of [3H]thymidine (ICN). The specific activity of the purified ssDNA was 4,900 cpm/nmol nucleotide assuming 1 A260 = 30 μg/ml. Double-strand DNA concentrations were calculated assuming 1A260 = 50 μg/ml. Single-strand DNA cellulose was prepared by the method of Alberts and Herrick (21Alberts B. Herrick G. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 21: 198-217Crossref Scopus (708) Google Scholar) and contained 0.2 mg of bound DNA per ml of cellulose. Two oligonucleotides (5′-CGCGGATCCATGAGTAAGGTAATC-3′ and 5′-CCGGAATTCACATTGAATATTGGC-3′), Taq DNA polymerase (Promega), and the polymerase chain reaction were used to clone the I3L open reading frame from vaccinia virus DNA. The 0.8-kilobase pair reaction products were then cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pET21a (Novagen), transformed into E. coli strain HB101, and sequenced. A single amino acid substitution differentiated our cloned gene product (Ser157) from that reported for vaccinia strain WR (Ala157). No attempt was made to alter this putative sequence polymorphism because the vaccinia Ankara and Copenhagen strains, like our WR stock, also encode serine at this site. The resulting recombinant protein bears a 14-amino acid N-terminal antigenic tag and a 20-amino acid C-terminal extension designed to facilitate Ni-chelate affinity chromatography. The recombinant protein was expressed in 1 liter of pNP105-transformed DE142 cells grown with shaking at 37° C in rich broth supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml), and thymine (50 μg/ml). When the OD590 equaled 0.7, protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (0.5 mm). Rifampicin (50 μg/ml) was added 0.5 h later and the cells recovered by centrifugation at 9,000 × g for 10 min at 4° C 3 h after inducing protein expression. The cells were harvested in 40 ml of binding buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris·HCl, 60 mm imidazole·HCl (pH 7.9), 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and stored at −80° C. The cells were thawed in a water bath and broken with 15 strokes of a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer on ice. From this point all manipulations were performed at 0–4° C unless otherwise noted. The extract was centrifuged at 39,000 × g for 20 min (Fraction I, 490 mg of protein). Fraction I was applied to a 10-ml column of His-bind resin (Novagen), washed with 60 mmimidazole·HCl (pH 7.9) in wash buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.9)), and eluted with a 20 ml of 0.06–1.0 m imidazole gradient in wash buffer. Protein-containing fractions were pooled to give Fraction II (6 mg of protein). Fraction II was immediately desalted into Buffer A (20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.8), 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% (w/v) glycerol) containing 50 mm NaCl using a Bio-Gel 6-DG desalting column (Bio-Rad). Fraction II was applied to a 5-ml HiTRAP heparin column (Pharmacia), washed, and then eluted with a 0.06–2 m NaCl gradient in Buffer A. Protein-containing fractions were pooled, and then stored frozen at −80° C in small aliquots. The yield was 3.2 mg of protein/liter of culture at a final concentration of 2.6 mg/ml. Native gpI3L was purified from vaccinia virus-infected HeLa cells using a procedure described by Rochester and Traktman (10Rochester S.C. Traktman P. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2917-2926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that hydroxyurea was not added to infected cell cultures. Briefly, 18 g of virus-infected cells (1.2 × 1011 plaque-forming units, 6 × 109 cells) were harvested by centrifugation and broken by hypotonic shock and Dounce homogenization. The nuclei-free extract were applied to a 25-ml column of DEAE cellulose (Whatman) equilibrated with “DEAE buffer” containing 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 50 mm NaCl. The flow-through was recovered, applied to a 25-ml column of single-stranded DNA cellulose equilibrated with DEAE buffer, and eluted with a 0.05–2.5 m NaCl gradient in DEAE buffer. The purest fractions eluted between 1.4 and 2.5 m NaCl as judged by gel electrophoresis. These fractions were pooled, dialyzed against Buffer A with 50 mm NaCl, concentrated with Sephadex G-50 powder, and stored frozen in small aliquots. This yielded 0.19 mg of native gpI3L protein at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. Protein purity and molecular weights were determined using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were visualized with a silver stain (Bio-Rad). Protein concentrations were determined using a commercial assay (Bio-Rad) and a bovine serum albumin standard. Molar concentrations were calculated assuming molecular masses of 30.0 and 33.5 kDa for the native and recombinant proteins, respectively. DNA-protein complexes were prepared for gel shift analysis by incubating 0–1.8 μg of protein with M13mp19 viral DNA in a 50-μl reaction containing 240 ng (0.1 pmol) of DNA, 12 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and 12% (w/v) glycerol. After 20 min at 37° C, 4 μl of 6 times concentrated loading buffer (0.4 g/ml sucrose, 1.3 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 0.1m EDTA) was added, and the DNA-protein complexes fractionated by gel electrophoresis. The gels were composed of 0.5% Seakem LE agarose and were run at 2 V/cm using a pH 8.0 buffer containing 89 mm Tris (or imidazole), 89 mmboric acid, and 2 mm EDTA. DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining and photographed. The aggregation assays contained 0–1.5 μg of protein, 750 ng of single-stranded M13mp19 DNA, 33 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.3), 1.8 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% (w/v) glycerol in a total volume of 30 μl. Double-stranded M13mp19 DNA (1.5 μg) and 20 mm MgCl2 were also added where indicated. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The DNA distribution in the pellet and supernatant were calculated as described by Heyer et al. (22Heyer W.D. Evans D.H. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15189-15195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) monitoring either a3H label in the ssDNA (Fig. 5) or using densitometry to quantitate the amount of single- and double-stranded DNA in ethidium-stained agarose gels (Fig. 6). In both cases a correction was applied to account for the small volume of DNA carried over from the supernatant into pelleted fractions.Figure 6Selective aggregation of ssDNA in the presence of double-stranded DNA. Reactions were prepared that contained the indicated quantities of recombinant gpI3L, 20 mm MgCl2, and 1.5 μg of single-stranded plus 0.75 μg of double-stranded M13mp19 DNA. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 ×g at 4 °C. The DNA distribution was determined in the pellet and supernatant fractions using agarose gel electrophoresis and densitometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) S1 protection assays measured the capacity of bound protein to protect ssDNA from digestion by S1 nuclease (22Heyer W.D. Evans D.H. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15189-15195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3H-Labeled M13mp19 viral DNA (0.1 pmol) was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in a 30-μl reaction containing 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and protein as indicated. The reaction volume was then adjusted to 0.1 ml with 50 μl of S1 salts (0.68 m NaCl, 80 mm potassium acetate (pH 4.6), 2.8 mm ZnSO4, 14% (w/v) glycerol), 2 units of S1 nuclease, and water. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and the acid-precipitable radioactivity determined as described (23Evans D.H. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10252-10259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA-protein complexes were fixed with 0.6% glutaraldehyde at room temperature for 10 min and then 10 μl applied to a colloidion-coated 400-mesh nickel grid. Twenty minutes later the grids were blotted dry with filter paper. The complexes were then stained for 30 s in 50 μm uranyl acetate in 90% (v/v) ethanol, washed for 10 s in 95% ethanol, and air dried. A 20-Å platinum shadow was applied at an angle of 22 °C, using a Balzers 360M evaporator, and the samples were imaged using a JEOL 100CX transmission electron microscope. All size measurements were determined using images of the native protein, a Hitachi KP-113 digital camera linked to a Power Macintosh 8600/200 computer, and NIH Image software. Print magnifications were calculated using a combination of microscope settings and photographic conversion factors. Vaccinia virus gpI3L displays an unusually high affinity for ssDNA. This behavior was used to purify the native protein from virus-infected cells following the method of Rochester and Traktman (10Rochester S.C. Traktman P. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2917-2926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting protein was 87–95% pure (depending upon the preparation) and these purity estimates were factored into all subsequent calculations of the protein's molar concentration (Fig. 1). Recombinant gpI3L was produced in E. coli as a histidine-tagged fusion protein and purified using a combination of Ni-chelate and heparin-affinity chromatography plus gel-exclusion chromatography. This protein preparation appeared pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis (Fig. 1). A comparison of the polypeptides produced by digesting each protein with trypsin confirmed the identity of the native protein (data not shown). Both forms of protein migrated unusually slowly on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The predicted masses were 30.0 and 33.5 kDa for native and recombinant proteins, respectively, whereas we measured 34 and 38 kDa, respectively. Further investigations determined a mass of 33,596 Da for the recombinant protein by electrospray mass spectroscopy. This value is nearly identical to the 33,531 Da predicted for anN-formylated histidine-tagged protein and shows that reduced electrophoretic mobility in the presence of SDS is an intrinsic feature of gpI3L. Gel shift analysis was used to determine appropriate DNA binding conditions. Single-stranded φX174 DNA was incubated with varying quantities of recombinant gpI3L in a low ionic strength buffer containing Tris buffer, 2-mercaptoethanol, EDTA, and glycerol. The resulting complexes were then fractionated using agarose gel electrophoresis. It was noted that as the protein-to-DNA ratio was increased, the relative migration of the DNA decreased (Fig. 2). At the highest ratios of protein-to-DNA attainable in these reactions (∼10 nucleotide per gpI3L monomer) the mobility was retarded approximately 50% compared with free DNA. We also calculated the relative mobility of these complexes using the formula,Rf=Distance migratedDNA protein complexDistance migrateduncomplexed DNAEquation 1 and plotted these values versus the DNA-protein ratio. An interesting feature of these plots was a discontinuity in the retardation curves. This discontinuity occurred when the DNA to protein ratio equaled about 32 nucleotides per gpI3L monomer as judged by linear-regression analysis (Fig. 3,panel A). Beyond this “breakpoint” greater quantities of protein caused a disproportionately greater retardation of the DNA-protein complexes. We repeated the experiment using a larger M13mp19 DNA substrate and recombinant gpI3L so that the total mass of the complex would increase for a given nucleotide-to-protein ratio. The same discontinuity was still seen at about 30 nucleotides per monomer (Fig. 3, panel B). We concluded that at high protein densities (>1 monomer per ∼31 nucleotides), gpI3L binds ssDNA differently than at low protein densities. The blurring and fading of the DNA complexes which occurred at very high protein-DNA ratios (Fig. 2) complicated efforts to identify the point at which protein binding saturates. To better determine this saturation point we performed a quantitative investigation of gpI3L's DNA binding capacity using S1 protection analysis. The assay measured the degree to which bound protein protects ssDNA from S1 nuclease digestion. Varying quantities of recombinant gpI3L were incubated with a fixed amount of 3H-labeled M13mp19 viral DNA, and then treated with an excess of S1 nuclease in S1 buffer. MgCl2 was deliberately omitted from the binding reactions to minimize the interference which might result from aggregate formation (see below). The degree of S1 protection was then calculated from the amount of acid-precipitable radioactivity. These experiments showed that 100% S1 resistance was achieved when the DNA-protein ratio was about 9.5 nucleotides per gpI3L monomer (Fig. 4). Lower and upper 95% confidence intervals were 7.1 and 12.7 nucleotides per monomer, respectively. Besides binding DNA, gpI3L can also aggregate DNA, although the process required somewhat different reaction conditions. Aggregation can be demonstrated using a simple sedimentation assay. Reactions were prepared containing recombinant gpI3L and single-stranded M13mp19 DNA at protein-to-DNA ratios of up to 1 mol of protein per 50 mol of nucleotide. No aggregation was noted in the absence of MgCl2, but in the presence of 20 mm MgCl2 gpI3L catalyzed the formation of high molecular weight aggregates which sedimented to the bottom of a microcentrifuge tube in 20 min at 16,000 × g (Fig. 5). To test whether this reaction was dependent upon properly folded gpI3L, we provided sufficient time for the complexes to form and then added 0.1% SDS. The detergent efficiently dissociated these rapidly sedimenting complexes. The aggregation reaction promoted by gpI3L also showed a remarkable capacity to discriminate between double-stranded and ssDNAs. To test the binding specificity under these conditions, we prepared reactions containing MgCl2, gpI3L, and an equimolar ratio of single- and double-stranded M13mp19 molecules. The protein-to-DNA ratios varied up to 1 mol of protein/40 mol of the nucleotide present in the single-stranded reaction component. When the pellet and supernatant fractions were examined by gel electrophoresis, after centrifugation, it was noted that only the ssDNA was precipitated by gpI3L (Fig. 6). The supernatant retained essentially all of the double-stranded molecules. Thus gpI3L interacts in a highly-specific manner with ssDNA under these binding conditions. All of the experiments outlined above were repeated using native gpI3L (except for the S1 protection assay for which insufficient quantities of highly concentrated protein were available). The only clear and consistent difference between the two proteins was noted when gel shift assays were used to monitor DNA binding in the absence of magnesium ions (Fig. 7). When we measured the migration properties of the DNA-protein complexes, both proteins produced a break in the retardation curves at 30–35 nt per monomer. However, at any given DNA-protein mole ratio, complexes containing the smaller and phosphorylated native isoform (10Rochester S.C. Traktman P. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2917-2926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) always migrated faster than did those composed of recombinant protein. To gain further insights into the nature of the structures formed by the two types of protein at different DNA-protein ratios, we employed electron microscopy. Several control experiments were first performed to determine the image resolution and identify potential artifacts. When gpI3L was spread on parlodian grids in the absence of DNA, it typically formed elliptical structures with axial dimensions 11 × 14 ± 2 nm (Figs.8B and 9A) while naked DNA was too thin to be visualized using this shadowing and staining procedure (data not shown). When buffer was applied to the grids it left variable numbers of electron-dense beads in each grid field, varying in diameter from 30 to 60 nm (Fig. 8A). This buffer property shows that not all beads, particularly the larger ones, are necessarily composed of protein and suggested that the structures of DNA-protein complexes must be interpreted with caution.Figure 9Electron microscopic analysis of gpI3L-DNA interactions. Panel A, native gpI3L alone. Panel B, native gpI3L plus single-stranded φX174 DNA at a nucleotide to protein ratio of 20:1, no MgCl2.

The DNA appeared to be thinly coated with small spheres not significantly different in dimension from those formed by protein alone (13 × 17 ± 2 nm) which we will refer to as “15-nm” particles or beads. These DNA-protein complexes seemed to comprise continuous circles although twisted and/or linear complexes were also seen. However, the DNA path could not be followed continuously with certainty, because it often disappeared where clusters of smaller spheres formed slightly larger beaded structures 17 × 21 ± 2 nm in diameter (“20 nm” particles). We estimated that the DNA-protein complexes contained over 30 15-nm particles per circle although this should be considered only a rough estimate due to the difficulty of determining the number of 15-nm particles clumped within the larger beads. The overall path length was measured using the best resolved and most extended molecules and found to be 600 ± 40 nm. Although the invisibility of protein-free φX174 DNA under these spreading conditions precluded a direct measurement of its path length, 5400 nt of ssDNA would extend 1.7–1.9 μm assuming an average residue spa"
https://openalex.org/W2056692814,"Human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) bind tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) specifically, saturably, and with relatively high affinity (Kd 25 nm), and this binding potentiates the activation of cell-associated plasminogen (Ellis, V., and Whawell, S. A. (1997)Blood 90, 2312–2322). We have observed that this binding can be efficiently competed by DFP-inactivated tPA and S478A-tPA but not by tPA inactivated with H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (PPACK). VSMC-bound tPA also exhibited a markedly reduced inhibition by PPACK, displaying biphasic kinetics with second-order rate constants of 7.5 × 103m−1 s−1 and 0.48 × 103m−1 s−1, compared with 7.2 × 103m−1s−1 in the solution phase. By contrast, tPA binding to fibrin was competed equally well by all forms of tPA, and its inhibition was unaltered. These effects were shown to extend to the physiological tPA inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1. tPA·plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 complex did not compete tPA binding to VSMC, and the inhibition of bound tPA was reduced by 30-fold. The behavior of the various forms of tPA bound to VSMC correlated with conformational changes in tPA detected by CD spectroscopy. These data suggest that tPA binds to its specific high affinity site on VSMC by a novel mechanism involving the serine protease domain of tPA and distinct from its binding to fibrin. Furthermore, reciprocally linked conformational changes in tPA appear to have functionally significant effects on both the interaction of tPA with its VSMC binding site and the susceptibility of bound tPA to inhibition.

Proteolytic activity is necessary for these processes and the generation of plasmin activity in particular has been implicated in vessel wall disease. Two plasminogen activators, tPA and uPA, catalyze the activation of plasminogenin vivo (1Carmeliet P. Schoonjans L. Kieckens L. Ream B. Degen J. Bronson R. De Vos R. van den Oord J.J. Collen D.

In addition to mediating remodeling of the vascular extracellular matrix, plasmin has been shown to be involved in the activation of latent TGF-β in the vessel wall (11Grainger D.J. Kemp P.R. Liu A.C. Lawn R.M. Metcalfe J.C. Nature. 1994; 370: 460-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), a process in which tPA has been implicated (12Ueba H. Kawakami M. Yaginuma T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1512-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It is well established that the activity of uPA in the pericellular environment can be regulated by its specific cell surface receptor, uPAR (2Ellis V. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), a protein also expressed by VSMC (13Reuning U. Little S.P. Dixon E.P. Bang N.U.

Biol. 1995; 15: 1432-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that VSMC also have the potential to regulate the activity of tPA, which binds to these cells specifically, saturably, and with relatively high affinity (Kd 25 nm) and leading to a >100-fold stimulation of the activation of cell-associated plasminogen (14Ellis V. Whawell S.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This binding was shown to be independent of a number of proteins reported to be cell surface binding sites for tPA on endothelial and other cell types, including annexin II (17Hajjar K.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25684-25691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Some of these proteins act as clearance receptors for tPA or tPA·PAI-1 complex and thus do not promote plasminogen activator function; however, tPA bound to annexin II or cytokeratin 8 retains its catalytic activity. The binding of tPA to the latter sites is sensitive to 6-aminohexanoic acid, implicating the tPA kringle 2 module lysine-binding site in the interaction. This site in kringle 2 is also involved, together with the fibronectin type I module, in the interaction of tPA with fibrin (23Verheijen J.H. Caspers M.P. Chang G.T. de Munk G.A. Pouwels P.H.

Fibrinolysis. 1999; 10: 75-86Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). By contrast, the binding of tPA to VSMC is not affected by lysine analogues, and a domain deletion mutant comprising kringle 2 and the serine protease domain did not bind with high affinity (14Ellis V. Whawell S.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data were interpreted as demonstrating a principal role for the N-terminal region of tPA (comprising the epidermal growth factor-like, fibronectin type I, and kringle 1 modules) in the binding interaction. In the present study, we have observed that the high affinity binding of tPA to VSMC is a novel interaction, quite distinct from that of fibrin, by identifying its dependence on the conformation of the serine protease domain of tPA. This conformation can be modulated by the presence of certain inhibitors in the active site of tPA, and in a reciprocal manner the cellular binding of tPA appears to modulate the active site such that there is a functionally significant reduction in its susceptibility to inhibition by a variety of inhibitors, including the physiological plasminogen activator inhibitor PAI-1. tPA was obtained from Boehringer-Ingelheim (Actilyse) as a predominantly single chain preparation (greater than 95%). This was converted to two-chain tPA by incubation with plasmin-Sepharose for 60 min at 37 °C. Single-chain tPA was obtained from Biopool (Umeå, Sweden). S478A-tPA was a gift of Prof. R. Lijnen (Center for Molecular and Vascular Biology, Leuven, Belgium). tPA serine protease domain expressed in Escherichia coli (28Krem M.M. Di Cera E. Proteins. 1998; 30: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Prof. E. Di Cera (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). uPA, pro-uPA, and Glu-plasminogen were as described previously (29Ellis V. Behrendt N. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12752-12758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Ellis V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14779-14784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Lys-plasminogen was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (Swansea, UK), and traces of plasmin removed by passing over aprotinin-Sepharose (Sigma). PAI-1 was either purified from HepG2 cell-conditioned medium (31Ellis V. Wun T.-C. Behrendt N. Rønne E. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9904-9908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or recombinant protein expressed inE. coli obtained from Calbiochem/Novabiochem (Nottingham, UK). Desafib was obtained from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). PAI-1 concentrations were determined by titration against tPA. PPACK-inactivated tPA was prepared by incubation of tPA (14 μm) with 1 mm PPACK (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 mm l-arginine for 60 min at 37 °C. Residual PPACK was removed by two cycles of gel filtration (NAP-5TM columns; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DFP-inactivated tPA was prepared by two sequential additions of 5 mm DFP to tPA (14 μm), each incubated for 60 min at 25 °C. Excess DFP was removed by dialysis. tPA·PAI-1 complex, free of residual tPA or PAI-1 activities, was prepared by incubation of recombinant PAI-1 with a slight molar excess of tPA (14 μm) for 60 min at 37 °C. Residual tPA activity (which was less than 5% of the initial activity) was then neutralized by incubation with PPACK, as described above. The residual activities of the inactivated forms of tPA were measured by amidolytic assay and found to be less than 0.1% in all cases. VSMC were isolated and cultured from human saphenous vein as described previously (14Ellis V. Whawell S.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional binding of tPA to these cells was determined by its effect on plasminogen activation, using an assay similar to that previously described (14Ellis V. Whawell S.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent monolayers of cells in 24-well plates were incubated with 10 nm tPA in the presence or absence of a 100-fold molar excess of DFP-tPA, S478A-tPA, PPACK-tPA, or tPA·PAI-1 complex for 20 min at 37 °C. Following three washes with incubation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2% bovine serum albumin), cell-bound tPA activity was determined by the addition of Lys-plasminogen (200 nm) and the fluorogenic plasmin substrate H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-AMC (0.3 mm; Bachem). After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, fluorescence was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 370/470 nm in a Perkin-Elmer LS-5B luminescence spectrometer. The fluorescence intensity was taken as a direct measure of cell-bound tPA activity, since plasmin generation under these conditions was shown to be linear with time in control experiments. In preliminary experiments, the concentration of the fibrin fragment preparation DesafibTM needed to maximally stimulate plasminogen activation was determined, and under the experimental conditions employed this was assumed to be due to saturation of tPA with fibrin. Competition of the binding of tPA to fibrin under these conditions was determined by incubation of tPA (0.1 nm) with fibrin (20 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of DFP-tPA, S478A-tPA, PPACK-tPA, or tPA·PAI-1 complex (1 μm in each case) for 20 min at 37 °C, prior to the addition of Lys-plasminogen (200 nm) and H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-para-nitroaniline (0.3 mm) (S-2251; Chromogenix, Uppsala, Sweden). Substrate hydrolysis was monitored continuously at 405 nm for 20 min at 37 °C in a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Fibrin-bound tPA was directly determined from the observed rates of plasmin generation calculated from plots of either δA versus t or A versus t 2, plasminogen activation in the absence of stimulator being negligible under these conditions. To determine the inhibition kinetics of VSMC-bound tPA by PPACK, cells were suspended at a density of approximately 5 × 105 cells/ml and incubated with tPA as described above. After washing, the cells were incubated with varying fixed concentrations of PPACK (1–50 μm) for different time intervals. The reaction was stopped by 10-fold dilution immediately followed by three rounds of washing by centrifugation and resuspension. Residual bound tPA activity was determined by plasminogen activation using the substrate H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-para-nitroaniline, as described above. In each time course series, PPACK was added to the cell suspensions at varying time points, and the reactions were stopped simultaneously to minimize variations due to tPA dissociation or other time-dependent effects. In control experiments, the dissociation of tPA from the cells over the time period of these experiments was negligible (less than 5%). To determine the inactivation of tPA in the solution phase in a similar manner to the determination of cell-associated tPA described above, assays were performed as follows. tPA (1 nm) was incubated with varying fixed concentrations of PPACK (1–50 μm) for different time intervals at 37 °C in a volume of 50 μl. The reaction was stopped by 10-fold dilution immediately followed by gel filtration over a NAP-5TM column to remove uncomplexed PPACK. Residual tPA activity was measured by plasminogen activation as described above. The inactivation of tPA in solution was also determined directly by including the chromogenic tPA substrate H-d-Ile-Pro-Arg-para-nitroaniline (S-2288, Chromogenix) in the inhibition reaction. Substrate hydrolysis was measured continuously and inhibition rates calculated as described previously (31Ellis V. Wun T.-C. Behrendt N. Rønne E. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9904-9908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition constants determined by this direct method were in all cases comparable with those determined by the indirect method described above. Inhibition kinetics of fibrin-bound tPA were determined essentially as described above for solution phase tPA with the exception that DesafibTM (20 μg/ml) was included in the reaction mixture together with tPA (10 nm), PPACK, and S-2288. Plasmin generation rates were calculated from linear plots of either δA versus t or A versus t 2 and taken to represent residual tPA activity compared with control values in the absence of added PPACK. The rate of tPA inactivation was initially evaluated graphically using semilogarithmic plots of residual tPA versus t at each concentration of PPACK. When the reaction was described by a simple one-component exponential decay (i.e. the plot was linear), inhibition rates were determined by nonlinear regression using the relationship at =a0· e(−kapp t), in which a0 and at are the activities under initial conditions and at reaction time t, respectively, and kapp is the pseudo-first-order inhibition rate. In cases where the semilogarithmic plots were clearly nonlinear, a double exponential decay model was found to best fit the data. This is described by the relationship at = a01· e(−k 1appt)+ a02· e(−k 2appt)in which a01 and a02 are the fractional activities of the two components, and kapp1and kapp2 are the pseudo-first-order rates for the two components. The data were analyzed by nonlinear regression. In both cases second-order inhibition rate constants were calculated from the slope of plots of 1/kapp versus 1/[I] from the relationship kapp =k2I/(Ki + I) (32Kitz R. Wilson I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3245-3249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of VSMC-bound and solution phase tPA by PAI-1 was determined in a similar manner to that previously reported for uPAR-bound uPA (31Ellis V. Wun T.-C. Behrendt N. Rønne E. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9904-9908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). tPA (10 pm) or a suspension of VSMC with bound tPA (cells were preincubated with tPA and subsequently washed as described above and used at a final density of 5 × 105 cells/ml) was simultaneously incubated with varying concentrations of PAI-1 (0–12.5 nm), Lys-plasminogen (200 nm), and the fluorogenic plasmin substrate H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-AMC (0.3 mm) at 37 °C. Substrate hydrolysis was measured continuously using excitation and emission wavelengths of 370 and 470 nm, respectively, in a Perkin-Elmer LS-5B spectrofluorimeter. Plasmin concentration was calculated as δF/δt, and plots of [plasmin]versus time were constructed. The general relationship [plnt] = [pln∞] (1 − e(−kapp t)) describes the progressive inhibition curve for reactions performed under these conditions (33Lin W. Tsou C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 870: 185-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), when [plnt] and [pln∞] are, respectively, the plasmin concentrations at reaction time t and at infinite time when tPA is completely inhibited. [pln∞] was calculated from the relationship [pln∞] = (δ[pln0])/kapp, where δ[pln0] is the initial rate of plasmin generation determined in control incubations in the absence of PAI-1.kapp was determined by fitting this model to the experimental data by nonlinear regression. Second-order inhibition constants were calculated from kapp values at varying PAI-1 concentrations as described above for PPACK. CD spectra were acquired in nitrogen-flushed Jasco J-600 and J-720 spectropolarimeters at 25 °C using a 4-s time constant, 20 nm/min scan speed, and a spectral bandwidth of 2 nm. 1- and 0.02-cm path length cells were used in the near and far UV, respectively. Near UV CD spectra of tPA were obtained at a protein concentration of 0.4 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 40 mm NaCl, 40 mm arginine. This buffer was necessary to maintain the solubility of tPA, but its lack of transparency below 260 nm prevented the collection of spectra in the far UV region. Near and far UV spectra of tPA serine protease domain were obtained at a protein concentration of 0.4 mg/ml in 20 mm sodium borate, pH 8.1. Data are presented as Δε = εL − εR (m−1cm−1) based on mean residue molecular weight in accordance with pending IUPAC-IUB recommendations. Secondary structure estimates from far UV spectra were performed by a principle component regression method (PLSplus of Grams/32 suite program) using a calibration data set of 16 proteins of known structure (34Hennessey J.P.J. Johnson W.C.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1085-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). We have previously observed the high affinity binding of tPA to VSMC (14Ellis V. Whawell S.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This binding was detected by its effect on the functional activity of tPA, i.e. by a stimulation of tPA-catalyzed plasminogen activation. To demonstrate the specificity of this binding, we have used various inactivated forms of tPA to compete for the binding of active tPA to VSMC. As shown in Fig. 1, both the active-site serine mutant (S478A-tPA) and tPA with the active-site serine modified by DFP efficiently competed for the binding of active tPA. By contrast, tPA with its active site modified by the tripeptide chloromethyl ketone inhibitor PPACK was completely unable to compete for tPA binding. To determine whether this unanticipated lack of binding of PPACK-tPA to VSMC was a consequence of active-site occupancy by PPACK or due to the introduction of additional modifications affecting tPA function, the effect of the three inactivated forms of tPA on fibrin-stimulated plasminogen activation was investigated. All three forms were found to compete efficiently for tPA binding to fibrin (Fig. 1). Therefore, the presence of PPACK in the active site of tPA appears to alter the characteristics of tPA such that it can no longer interact with its specific binding site on VSMC, possibly suggesting the induction of a conformational change in tPA. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that tPA binds to this site by a mechanism distinct from that of its binding to fibrin. These observations implicate the serine protease domain of tPA as an important determinant in the binding interaction with VSMC, since occupancy of the active site by PPACK abolishes this interaction. To determine whether the converse was also true, i.e. if tPA binding to VSMC affected its interaction with PPACK, we compared the kinetics of tPA inhibition by PPACK with solution phase and VSMC-bound enzyme and found them to be distinctly different (Fig. 2, upper panel). tPA in solution was inhibited with simple pseudo-first-order kinetics having a second-order rate constant of 7.2 × 103m−1 s−1. By contrast, the inhibition of tPA bound to VSMC displayed kinetics that did not follow a single exponential decay. They could, however, be described by a double exponential, from which second-order rate constants of 7.5 × 103m−1 s−1 and 0.48 × 103m−1s−1 were derived for the two components, i.e.one equivalent to the reaction in solution and the other approximately 16-fold slower. In various experiments, the slower component accounted for approximately 30% of the bound tPA activity. To determine whether this behavior was a general consequence of the interaction of tPA with a macromolecular cofactor, the effect of fibrin on tPA inhibition by PPACK was observed. As shown in Fig. 2(center panel), the inhibition of fibrin-bound tPA was indistinguishable from solution phase tPA, the semilogarithmic plots displaying no deviation from linearity and with similar second-order rate constants (Table I). To exclude the possibility that the difference in behavior of tPA bound to VSMC and fibrin was an artifact introduced by the cellular assay system used, the inhibition of uPA bound to uPAR on the same cells was also observed. uPAR-bound uPA was inhibited by PPACK with an association rate constant of 195 (± 25) m−1s−1, compared with 230 (± 30)m−1 s−1 for uPA in solution, with the semilogarithmic plots showing no deviation from linearity (Fig. 2,lower panel). Therefore, the reduced inhibition of tPA bound to VSMC appears to result from the specific interaction of tPA with its binding site on these cells, consistent with the results of the competition experiments.Table ISecond-order rate constants for the inhibition of tPA bound to VSMC compared with tPA bound to fibrin or in solutionIn solutionFibrin-boundVSMC-boundm−1s−1m−1s−1m−1s−1PPACK7.2 (± 1.5) × 1039.5 (± 1.4) × 1037.5 (± 2.4) × 1030.48 (± 0.08) × 103PAI-17.0 (± 0.4) × 1071.6 (± 0.3) × 1072.3 (± 0.5) × 106The data shown are from Fig. 2 and 3 and other similar experiments and are presented as mean ± S.D. (n ≥ 3). These data were generated using two-chain tPA in preference to single chain tPA to prevent possible interference from proteolytic conversion during the course of the assays. In the presence of either VSMC or fibrin, the amidolytic activities of single chain and two-chain tPA were similar, and their inhibition rates were comparable with those shown here. In solution the activity of single-chain tPA was approximately 4-fold lower than that of two-chain tPA and was inhibited more slowly by PPACK, with a single rate constant of 0.85 × 103m−1s−1. Open table in a new tab The data shown are from Fig. 2 and 3 and other similar experiments and are presented as mean ± S.D. (n ≥ 3).

In solution the activity of single-chain tPA was approximately 4-fold lower than that of two-chain tPA and was inhibited more slowly by PPACK, with a single rate constant of 0.85 × 103m−1s−1. Similar experiments were performed to determine whether these observations extrapolate to the physiological inhibitor of tPA, PAI-1. Preformed tPA·PAI-1 complex was unable to compete with tPA for binding to VSMC, whereas it competed effectively for the binding of tPA to fibrin (95 versus 15% residual bound tPA activity), consistent with the observations with PPACK-tPA. The inhibition kinetics of VSMC-bound tPA by PAI-1 were also investigated, and as shown in Fig. 3 and Table I, VSMC-bound tPA was inhibited at a rate 30-fold slower than observed for tPA in the absence of cells. To determine the specificity of this effect, controls similar to those used above in the experiments with PPACK were performed. In contrast to the inhibition of VSMC-bound tPA, the inhibition of tPA by PAI-1 was much less affected by binding of the enzyme to fibrin (Table I). Also, PAI-1 inhibition of uPAR-bound uPA on these cells was only slightly impaired (5.2 (± 2.1) × 107m−1 s−1 compared with 7.8 (± 1.1) × 107m−1s−1 in the solution phase), consistent with our previous observations on other cell types (31Ellis V. Wun T.-C. Behrendt N. Rønne E. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9904-9908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of the various inhibitors on the behavior of tPA points to the existence of functionally significant conformational differences between the inactivated forms of tPA. To test this experimentally, CD spectra of tPA, PPACK-tPA, and DFP-tPA were determined. The poor solubility of tPA necessitates the use of buffers that have low transparency in the far UV range, and data collection in these experiments was therefore restricted to near UV wavelengths. The spectra of tPA and DFP-tPA were found to be very similar, whereas that of PPACK-tPA displayed significant differences (Fig. 4A). These differences, observed in the 260–300-nm aromatic region, are seen more clearly in the difference spectrum shown in Fig. 4B. tPA also displayed a CD spectrum in the 300–330-nm region, m"

One such PTP, SHP-1 (previously called PTP1C, HCP, and SHPTP1) is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells and has gained much attention with the finding that motheaten and motheaten viable mice have mutations in the SHP-1gene (1Tsui H.W.

Cell. 1992; 12: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (330) Google Scholar) form a class of protein-tyrosine phosphatases that have two tandem SH2 domains amino-terminal to the phosphatase domain. SH2 domains, which are present in many signaling molecules, bind phosphorylated tyrosine residue motifs in a sequence-specific manner (13Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar) and hence function to bring two signaling molecules together to help propagate a signaling cascade. However, in the case of SHP-1 and SHP-2, their SH2 domains have a second function, namely to negatively regulate the activity of the catalytic domain (14Pei D. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1092-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Townley R. Shen S.H. Banville D. Ramachandran C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5602-5611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect is relieved when the amino-terminal SH2 domain binds to phosphorylated peptides (17Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmuller U. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 18Pei D. Wang J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1141-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Biphosphopeptides that bind to both SH2 domains of SHP-2 activate SHP-2 at lower concentrations than do single phosphopeptides, arguing that both SH2 domains participate in this inhibitory effect (19Pluskey S. Wandless T.J. Walsh C.T. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2897-2900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This notion is also supported by the crystal structure for SHP-2 that shows an intramolecular interaction between both SH2 domains and the phosphatase domain (20Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Despite the sequence similarity between SHP-1 and SHP-2 (∼50% amino acid identity; Ref. 8Freeman R.M. Plutzky J. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11239-11243Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), other comparisons have suggested that the SH2-mediated inhibition of SHP-1 and SHP-2 might be different. Thus, SHP-1 molecules that lack the carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain (SH2C) are still subjected to negative regulation by the amino-terminal SH2 domain (SH2N; Refs. 18Pei D. Wang J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1141-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar and 21Pregel M.J. Shen S.H. Storer A.C. Protein Eng. 1995; 12: 1309-1316Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the polypeptide segment corresponding to SH2C is necessary in SHP-2 as a spacer to allow the SH2N to block the catalytic cleft (20Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). To accommodate the stereochemical restrictions, it is possible that autoregulation of SHP-1 might be due to intermolecular interactions between two or more SHP-1 molecules, as has been suggested before (21Pregel M.J. Shen S.H. Storer A.C. Protein Eng. 1995; 12: 1309-1316Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Two forms of SHP-1 transcripts have been detected in humans (22Banville D. Stocco R. Shen S.H. Genomics. 1995; 27: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), denoted as (I)SHP-1 and (II)SHP-1. The cDNA sequences of (I)- and (II)SHP-1 are identical except in the 5′-untranslated region and in the first few coding nucleotides (MLSRG are the first 5 amino acids of (I)SHP-1, and MVR are the first 3 amino acids of (II)SHP-1). Because the published mouse SHP-1 amino-terminal coding sequences (MVR) are identical (5Matthews R. Bowne D.B. Flores E. Thomas M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2396-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 6Yi T. Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 836-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), probably corresponding to the human (II)SHP-1 isoform, it is unclear whether mouse has more than one species of SHP-1 protein. Here, we report findings that indicate that the mouse also produces a second isoform, similar to the human (I)SHP-1. In addition, we also found that these transcripts are each spliced in multiple ways, thus generating in-frame RNAs. In some cases, these SHP-1 RNAs lack exons that encode either one of the SH2 domains. As the SH2 domains of SHP-1 possess autoregulatory functions (see above), proteins encoded by these RNAs are expected to have novel regulatory properties. Our results confirmed this expectation; each of these SHP-1 variant proteins had elevated phosphatase activity. Furthermore, our analysis showed that autoregulation of SHP-1 is an intramolecular process. mRNA from Y1 cells (ATCC) was prepared using the FAST TRACKTMmRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen, CA). 5′-RACE was carried out using the 5′-AmpliFINDERTM RACE kit (CLONTECH). Three nested SHP-1 3′ primers were used for RT-PCR (SHP-1–529-3′ (5′-CCACAGTATAGCGTCCAC-3′), SHP-1–494-3′ (5′-TTGATATGAGTG-ACCCTGAGC-3′), and SHP-1–284-3′ (5′-TACTTAAGGTGGATGATGGTG-3′)). The PCR products were digested withEcoRI and BamHI and subcloned into plasmid vectors cut either with EcoRI and BamHI or withBamHI only and sequenced using the fmol DNA sequencing system (Promega). Using genomic DNA from normal mice, six genomic DNA fragments encompassing the complete SHP-1 gene (Fig. 2A) were amplified with the following primer pairs: primers A and B for the 6-kb fragment; primers C and W for the 700-bp fragment; primers E and F for the 3.7-kb fragment; primers G and K for the 1-kb fragment; primers J and N for the 3-kb fragment; and primers O and V for the 4.3-kb fragment. The Expand TM Long Template PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used to amplify fragments that were larger than 3 kb. Fig. 2A summarizes the locations of the PCR genomic fragments and the following primers used to obtain the intron-exon boundary sequences: primer A, 5′-AACAGCTGTGCCACTCGATTG-3′; primer B, 5′-CAGTTTGTCTGGGCAGGCA-3′; primer C, 5′-GTGCCTGCCCAGACAAACTG-3′; primer D, 5′-GTTTCACCGGGACCTCAG-3′; primer E, 5′-TTGCGACGCTGACAGAGCT-3′; primer F, 5′-TTGATATGAGTGACCCTGAGC-3′; primer G, 5′-CTCAGGGTCACTCATATCAA-3′; primer H, 5′-CCACAGTATAGCGTCCAC-3′; primer I, 5′-TGGAGCACTTCAAGAAGACAG-3′; primer J, 5′-TAAACGCAGCTGACATTGAG-3′; primer K, 5′-GTAAAGAATCTACACCAACGTC-3′; primer L, 5′-TTACTGTCACGTCCCTGCAG-3′; primer M, 5′-CATCTGCCAGAAGTCATTGAC-3′; primer N, 5′-TGTCATCGTCATGACTACC-3′; primer O, 5′-GGAGATCTGTAATGTTCGCA-3′, primer P, 5′-ACAGCAGAATACAAACTGCGAACA-3′; primer Q, 5′-CAGCTTTCTGGATCAGATCA-3′; primer R, 5′-CCCTTGGTGGAGATGCTTT-3′; primer S, 5′-CATCATCGTCA-TTGATATGCTTATGG-3′; primer T, 5′-GACCATCCAGATGGTACGAGCA-3′; primer U, 5′-CCCAGATCACTTCCTCTTGA-3′; primer V, 5′-CCACAGGTCTCAGTCTATCGGGT-3′; and primer W, 5′-TTGATATGAGTGACCCTGAGC-3′. These sequence data have been submitted to the GenBankTM data bases under accession numbers U65951–U65955. Total RNA from murine bone marrow macrophages was prepared by the Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) method. The primer pairs (II)SHP-1–74-5′ (5′-GTGCCTGCCCAGACAAACTG-3′) and SHP-1–1859-3′ (5′-CCACAGGTCTCAGTCTATCGGGT-3′); (I)SHP-1–90-5′ (5′-AACAGCTGTGCCACTCGATTG-3′) and SHP-1–1859-3′ were used for RT-PCR to obtain cDNAs corresponding to (II)- and (I)SHP-1, respectively. Amplified cDNAs were subcloned into the S1 nuclease-bluntedBamHI site of pRSETb. Ligated DNAs were transfected into DH5α, and clones were sequenced to check for errors. Constructs with the correct sequences were transfected into BL21(DE3), and single colonies were induced to express the fusion protein in liquid cultures with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as described previously (23Martin A. Shulman M.J. Tsui F.W. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1226-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These vectors were designed to produce a polyhistidine-tagged fusion protein of SHP-1 and its isoforms. In addition, an enterokinase cleavage site present within the fusion peptide allowed for removal of the peptide after purification. Purification of the fusion proteins from the soluble fraction was carried out using Probond nickel-resin columns (Invitrogen) as described previously (23Martin A. Shulman M.J. Tsui F.W. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1226-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Phosphatase assays were carried out essentially as described by Pei et al. (17Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmuller U. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Each fusion protein was assayed at a concentration of ∼150 nm in 50 μl of either buffer A (50 mm NaAc, pH 5.0, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and different concentrations of NaCl) or buffer B (50 mm Pipes, pH 6.0 or 7.0, 2 mmEDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and indicated concentrations of NaCl) with the substrate para-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP; Sigma) for up to 2 min at 25 °C (generation of product was linear for all SHP-1 isoforms for up to 10 min). Reactions were stopped with 450 μl of 0.2 n NaOH, and thepara-nitrophenylate anion was measured by absorption at 410 nm in a Beckman Du® 640B spectrophotometer. Absorbance values were recalculated to moles using the extinction coefficient of 16,600 m−1 cm−1 (410 nm) for the product. In all experimental assays, less than 1% of the substrate was converted to product. Initial velocities (obtained by dividing moles of product generated by duration of the assay in minutes) were then plotted against varying pNPP concentration. The data were analyzed with SigmaPlot version 2.0 to obtain Vmax and Km values from nonlinear least squares fits of the rectangular hyperbolic form of the data. Cell lysates were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE (7.5%) under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 500 mmNaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h; incubated with anti-SHP-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA; 1:1,000 dilution in 1% BSA in TBST) or anti-T7 antibody (Novagen; 1:1,000 dilution in 1% BSA in TBST) for 1 h; and then, following washings, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 1:10,000 dilution in 1% BSA in TBST) for 1 h. After washings, specifically bound antibody was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Digestions with enterokinase (EKmax, Invitrogen) were performed as suggested by the manufacturer. 2 μg of (I)SHP-1 mj and S6 or SHP-1(C453S) mj and S6 were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 0, 0.01, and 0.001 units of EKmax with the manufacturer's buffer. An aliquot was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Size exclusion chromatography was performed on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with solvent delivery by a Beckman System Gold HPLC instrument. The column buffer was 50 mm Pipes (pH 7.0), 250 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and the flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. 20 μg of purified (I)SHP-1 mj and S6 protein (two different purified preparations of each were assayed) were applied in 400 μl of column buffer (i.e. initial enzyme concentration at approximately 750 nm), and elution volumes were measured by absorbance at 280 nm, as well as by phosphatase activity and Western blotting. For the purpose of apparent molecular mass calibration, the elution positions of 20 μg each of BSA (monomer and dimer), ovalbumin, and carbonic anhydrase were measured. The elution volume (Ve) for each protein was divided by 7.1 ml (the void volume (Vo) of the column as measured by blue dextran) and expressed asVe/Vo. A plot of log molecular weight of the standard globular proteins versus Ve/Vo yielded a straight line. 11-ml sucrose gradients (linear from 10 to 25%) were made in the following buffer: 50 mmPipes, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA. 20 μg each of glutathione S-transferase (GST), ovalbumin, BSA, and human IgG in 200 μl of the same buffer were layered onto separate gradients and centrifuged in a SW41 rotor for 17 h at 40,000 rpm at 20 °C. 20 μg each of (I)SHP-1 mj and S6 (two different purified preparations of each were assayed) in 200 μl of buffer without sucrose (i.e. initial enzyme concentrations at ∼1500 nm) were also subjected to the same experimental conditions. 200-μl fractions were collected. 50 μl of each fraction was assayed for protein with Coomassie Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce), and 20 μl was assayed for phosphatase activity in 50 μl of Pipes, pH 6.0, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm pNPP for 5 min at 25 °C. The erythropoietin receptor peptide pY429 with the sequence DPPHLKpYLYLVVSDSK (where pY represents phosphotyrosine), previously described by Pei et al. (18Pei D. Wang J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1141-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), was synthesized and purified by reverse phase HPLC on a C8 column. As noted above, the two published sequences for mouse SHP-1 correspond more closely to the human type II isoform than to the type I isoform. It has also been reported that human (I)SHP-1 is exclusively expressed in epithelial cells, while (II)SHP-1 is only found in hematopoietic cells (22Banville D. Stocco R. Shen S.H. Genomics. 1995; 27: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To assess whether mice also produce a type I isoform of SHP-1, we sequenced 5′-RACE products from SHP-1 transcripts from a mouse adrenal epithelial tumor cell line, Y1. With this strategy, described under “Experimental Procedures,” we obtained two products, fragment X (∼360 bp) and fragment Y (∼250 bp) (Fig. 1). Sequencing fragment X (Fig. 1A) showed that it encoded the amino-terminal amino acids (i.e. MVR) similar to that for human type II SHP-1. Fragment Y (Fig. 1B) contained sequences that encoded the amino-terminal amino acids (i.e. MLSRG) similar to that of human type I SHP-1 (4Shen S.H. Bastien L. Posner B.I. Chretien P. Nature. 1991; 352: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). These results indicate that mouse also produces two distinct SHP-1 isoforms differing at their 5′-ends. In humans, the two SHP-1 isoforms are generated from the same gene via the use of alternative 5′ exons (22Banville D. Stocco R. Shen S.H. Genomics. 1995; 27: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To assess whether each transcript isoform of mouse SHP-1 is also produced from two alternatively used 5′ exons, we characterized the entire mouse SHP-1 locus. Assuming that the human and murine genetic structure was similar, we designed primers to amplify the complete mouse SHP-1 gene. Six genomic DNA fragments (Fig. 2A) encompassing the completeSHP-1 gene were amplified by PCR from normal mouse DNA. Fig. 2A shows the locations of these PCR fragments and the primers used to obtain the intron-exon boundary sequences that are shown in Fig. 2B. Genomic DNA sequences were compared with the SHP-1 cDNA sequences in order to deduce the intron-exon boundaries. We obtained complete sequences for all introns except for the indicated four cases in which the introns were larger than 2 kb (GenBankTM numbers U65951–U65955). Similar to the human chromosomal SHP-1 gene, mouse SHP-1 has 17 exons (Fig. 2A). (I)exon 1, which contains 5′-untranslated sequences and nucleotides encoding the first 5 amino acids (i.e. MLSRG) of (I)SHP-1, is located ∼5.8 kb upstream of (II)exon 1, which contains 5′-untranslated sequences and nucleotides encoding the first 3 amino acids (i.e. MVR) of (II)SHP-1. Thus, both mouse and human (I)SHP-1 and (II)SHP-1 transcripts are generated by alternative 5′ exon usage. (I)SHP-1 transcript variants lacking either one (exon 2) or both exons (exons 2 and 3) encoding the SH2N domain exist in human cells (22Banville D. Stocco R. Shen S.H. Genomics. 1995; 27: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To determine whether we could identify such transcripts in murine cells, we assessed the SHP-1 transcripts in murine bone marrow macrophages by Northern blots (Fig. 3A). These blots, using the phosphatase domain of SHP-1 as a probe, revealed the presence of multiple bands larger and smaller than the expected full-length transcript (Fig. 3A). To examine the sequence of these bands, we used RT-PCR to amplify the different RNA molecules. Expression of (I)SHP-1 transcripts was assessed using the primers (I)SHP-1–90-5′ and SHP-1–1859-3′. We found not only the expected 1944-bp (I)SHP-1 mj product, but also a larger product (∼2000 bp) and two smaller products (∼1800 and ∼1600 bp; Fig. 3B). The sequencing analysis of these products is summarized in Fig. 3C. As depicted in Fig. 3, the different RNA isoforms arise by alternative splicing. We denote these different isoforms with specific postscripts. Thus, the major forms indicated in Fig. 3C are denoted as mj. The spliced variants are denoted as S1–S6. Two SHP-1 structures are present within the ∼2000-bp product; (I)SHP-1 S1 (2105 bp) retains the 171-bp intronic sequence between exons 15 and 16, and (I)SHP-1 S2 (2051-bp) retains the 117-bp intronic sequence between exons 4 and 5 (Fig. 3C). Two SHP-1 structures are present within the ∼1800-bp product; (I)SHP-1 S3 (1811 bp) excludes sequences from exon 2, and (I)SHP-1 S4 (1820 bp) excludes a 114-bp segment from exon 4 (Fig. 3C). The ∼1600-bp product (I)SHP-1 S6 (1626 bp) excludes sequences from exons 2 and 3 (Fig. 3C). This structure is similar to the previously reported human SHP-1 variant (22Banville D. Stocco R. Shen S.H. Genomics. 1995; 27: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). All of these transcript variants of SHP-1 retain the normal reading frame. Expression of the (II)SHP-1 transcripts was assayed by RT-PCR using the (II)SHP-1–74-5′ and SHP-1–1859-3′ primer pair. The 1934-bp product represented (II)SHP-1 mj (Fig. 3B). Two structures similar to S1 and S2 of (I)SHP-1 were identified in the ∼2000-bp product (Fig. 3C). The ∼1800-bp product contained three structures. Two were similar to S3 and S4 of (I)SHP-1, while the third, (II)SHP-1 S5 (1817 bp), excluded sequences from exon 5 (Fig. 3C). As with (I)SHP-1 transcript variants, all of these transcripts retain an open reading frame, and as a consequence, they are capable of encoding active phosphatases. Thus, most of these splice variants of SHP-1 would express proteins with altered amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal SH2 domains. However, we found that all of these alternatively spliced transcripts of SHP-1 were present at low levels and that the corresponding protein products were not detected (see “Discussion”). 2A. Martin, H. W. Tsui, and F. W. L. Tsui, submitted for publication. The SH2 domains of human SHP-1 inhibit the phosphatase domain by decreasing its affinity for its substrate (17Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmuller U. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The naturally occurring mouse SHP-1 transcript variants encode SHP-1 proteins with deletions in their SH2 domains. These splice variant SHP-1 proteins can be used to gain information on the mechanism of autoinhibition. By comparing their kinetic properties relative to SHP-1 mj, we can assess whether they have elevated activities as predicted and thus map the motifs responsible for the inhibitory effects. The SHP-1 cDNAs that were used in this study all encode proteins that have deletions affecting one or the other SH2 domain (Fig. 4A). In this study of autoregulation, we have compared these SHP-1 splice variant proteins with two other proteins: SHP-1 mj, which contains the complete SH2N and SH2C domains, and an engineered mutant protein of SHP-1, which consisted only of the phosphatase domain (PTPase domain; Fig. 4A). These cDNAs were cloned into the BamHI site of the pRSETb vector and transfected into the bacterial strain BL21(DE3) for protein expression. Cloning into the BamHI site produces fusion proteins that contain an N-terminal polyhistidine region that allows for purification by binding to nickel columns (see Fig. 5A for schematic of the fusion peptide). To allow for removal of the fusion peptide, an enterokinase cleavage site was placed immediately amino-terminal to the initiator methionine of SHP-1 and its isoforms. Bacterial lysates were prepared, and the fusion proteins were partially purified and analyzed by staining SDS-PAGE gels with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 4B). As (I)SHP-1 S4 was expressed at low levels and thus contained many bacterial proteins even after purification, Western blots using a carboxyl-terminal specific antibody were used to measure the SHP-1 concentration in each preparation. Using this information, all subsequent assays were ensured to have an equimolar amount of each protein (Fig. 4C).Figure 5Enterokinase digestion of (I)SHP-1 mj and S6. A, schematic diagram depicts location of the T7 epitope and the enterokinase cleavage site in both (I)SHP-1 mj and S6 used to remove the fusion peptide. B, Western blot of portions of enterokinase digestion products of 2 μg of (I)SHP-1 mj and S6 using polyclonal anti-SHP-1 antibody or anti-T7 antibody.Lanes 4 and 10–13 represent enterokinase digestions in the presence of 60 μm EpoR pY429 peptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As noted above, all fusion proteins included an enterokinase site, which was included to allow cleavage of the oligo-His fusion peptide (Fig. 5A). Cleavage at this site would remove a T7 epitope from the protein and, consequently, result in the loss of reactivity to an anti-T7 antibody by Western blot. As shown on Fig. 5B, (I)SHP-1 mj could not be cleaved at any of four different concentrations of enterokinase (Fig. 5B,lanes 6–9). This site, however, was cleaved by enterokinase on (I)SHP-1 S6 (Fig. 5B, lanes 2 and 3), as exemplified by the absence of reactivity of the anti-T7 antibody to the smaller immunoreactive band observed with the anti-SHP-1 antibody. We also found that enterokinase cleaves at other presumably nonspecific sites on (I)SHP-1 S6 more than on (I)SHP-1 mj. Relative to the densitometric values obtained for the undigested controls for (I)SHP-1 S6 and (I)SHP-1 mj (lanes 1 and 5, respectively), the band intensities forlanes 2 and 3 are 0.3 and 0.49, respectively, while the band intensities for lanes 6 and 7 are 0.22 and 0.5, respectively. Thus, ∼5-fold more enterokinase is required to obtain a comparable level of proteolytic degradation for (I)SHP-1 mj than for (I)SHP-1 S6. These data suggest a structural difference between (I)SHP-1 mj and (I)SHP-1 S6 (see below for more discussion on this point). To test whether the presence of the oligo-His fusion peptide affected the kinetic behavior of the proteins in question, we expressed in bacteria both (I)- and (II)SHP-1 mj and selected SHP-1 splice variant proteins without the oligo-His fusion peptide (for simplicity, hereinafter referred to as “native”) and compared their kinetic parameters to those of their fusion protein counterparts. This analysis was applied to (I)- and (II)SHP-1 mj, S3, and S6. Fig. 6A depicts the bacterial expression of the (I)SHP-1 mj, S3, and S6, both as native protein and as fusion products. We then measured the Km of unpurified native and unpurified fusion proteins and compared these values to those obtained with purified fusion proteins, as shown in Fig. 6B. In all cases, the enzyme activity curves were similar for unpurified native and unpurified fusion proteins, while bacterial lysates alone could not hydrolyze pNPP at any concentration (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, the Km values for unpurified fusion protein were not significantly different than the values for the purified fusion proteins (TableI). We thus conclude that the fusion peptide had little effects on the kinetic properties of the isoforms and that we could therefore carry out enzyme kinetic analyses using the fusion proteins. As both (I)- and (II)SHP-1 mj had comparable results in all of the experiments performed in this study, data are only presented for one or the other.Table IThe Km (millimolar concentrations of pNPP) of selected SHP-1 isoforms either “native” or as fusion proteins at the indicated pHPurified fusion proteinUnpurified fusion proteinUnpurified “native” protein(I)SHP-1 mj, pH 5.039.3 ± 5.846.3 ± 3.340.4 ± 1.8(II)SHP-1 mj, pH 5.059.7 ± 2.593.1 ± 6.451.1 ± 6.1(I)SHP-1 mj, pH 7.0>100aThese values were adopted from Table II for comparison.>100>100(II)SHP-1 mj, pH 7.0>100aThese values were adopted from"
https://openalex.org/W2017886794,"Interaction of Orange G (OG) with bovine plasma albumin (BPA) has been investigated using NMR, UV-visible absorption, CD, and fluorescence techniques. The bound conformation of OG is a compact structure with N9-N10 bond in a non-planar synconformation. The binding causes a decrease in the 478-nm absorption band of OG. The analysis of the binding isotherm generated from UV-visible absorption measurements gives a dissociation constant of 10 μm and stoichiometry 1:1 for BPA·OG complex. Dissociation constant is invariant in the pH range 5.0–8.0 and is ∼20 times higher at pH 4.0 than its value at pH 7.0. Near and far UV-CD studies indicate alterations in the helical content and in the tertiary structure of the protein on complexation. The binding induces (−) and (+) CD at 335 nm and 465 nm, respectively. The binding also results into an increase in the steady state fluorescence anisotropy of OG without affecting emission maximum and quantum yield. Fluorescence data indicate that quenching of Trp fluorescence by OG is static in nature and OG selectively binds near Trp-135. Observation of similar rotational correlation time for BPA and BPA·OG complex indicates that the overall globular structure of BPA remains unaltered on binding despite certain internal rearrangement in the protein structure.

Sulfonated compounds have been used as biological staining reagents for some time. However, only recently it has been realized that some of these compounds can exhibit diverse biological activities (1Brinkworth R.I. Fairlie D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1984; 56: 1335-1344Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and hence are looked upon as potential pharmaceutical agents and important lead compounds (6Baba M. Schols D. Mohan P. De Clercq E. Shigeta S. Antiviral Chem. Chemother. 1993; 4: 229-234Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 7Mohan P. Pharm. Res. 1992; 9: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 8Weaver J.L. Pine P.S. Anand R. Bell S. Aszalos A. Antiviral Chem. Chemother. 1992; 3: 147Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The effectiveness of these compounds as pharmaceutical agents depends on their ability to reach and bind to the specific sites on the target proteins. Albumins are the principal proteins found in plasma contributing to the colloid osmotic pressure of the blood and also act as transport proteins for numerous endogenous and exogenous compounds (9Peters T. Peters T. All about Albumin: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Medical Applications. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1996Google Scholar). These have propensity to bind a wide variety of ligands. Because of this, albumins are assumed to function as transport protein and possibly serve as vehicles for regulating levels of drugs and metabolites in blood (10Bennhold H. Desgrez P. de Traverse P.M. Hartmann L. Transport Function of Plasma Proteins. American Elsevier Publishing Co., New York1965: 1Google Scholar). The mode of interaction of various sulfonated azo compounds including 7-hydroxy-8-(phenylazo)1,3-naphthelenedisulfonate, commonly known as Orange G (OG) 1The abbreviations used are: OG, Orange G; BPA, bovine plasma albumin; T1, longitudinal relaxation time; MEM, maximum entropy method; DAS, decay-associated spectrum; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy. (Fig. 1B) with amino acids such as Arg, Lys, and His has been reported (11Ojala W.H. Sudbeck E.A. Lu L.K. Richardson T.I. Lovrien R.E. Gleason W.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2131-2142Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the interaction of OG with any protein. Detailed knowledge of the OG-albumin interaction is relevant to the understanding of interaction of sulfonated azo dyes with enzymes and with specific binding proteins. We have therefore undertaken detailed investigations on the mode of interaction of OG and plasma protein called bovine plasma albumin (BPA). In this report, we have characterized BPA·OG complex using a variety of spectroscopic techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence, etc. In addition, the conformation of BPA and of OG in BPA·OG complex is discussed. Bovine plasma albumin was purchased from Armour Pharmaceutical Co. and Orange G from Sigma. Concentration of BPA was determined using molecular mass of 66 kDa and A279 = 0.667 mg−1 ml cm−1 (12Leonard Jr., W.J. Vijai K.K. Foster J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 1984-1988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that of OG using ε478 = 19900m−1 cm−1. Other chemicals used were of AnalaR grade. 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, was used. A mixture of acetate and phosphate (20 mm) was used to obtain pH in the range 4–8. NMR measurements were carried out on a Varian Unity Plus 600-MHz spectrometer. Chemical shifts were measured with respect to sodium trimethylsilyl-propionate-2,2,3,3-d4. One-dimensional spectra were recorded with 16,000 data points, 6499-Hz spectral width, 64 transients, and a 2-s relaxation delay at 25 °C. A 200-ms mixing time was used in the nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) (13Kumar A. Earnst R.R. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2031) Google Scholar) experiment. For13C-T1 measurements, inversion recovery pulse sequence was incorporated in gradient enhanced heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy sequence (14Palmer III, A.G. Cavanagh J. Wright P.E. Rance M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 93: 151-170Google Scholar). A relaxation time of 3 s was used. The 1H spin lattice relaxation times (T1) were measured using inversion recovery pulse sequence (15Freeman R. Hill H.D.W. J. Chem. Phys. 1970; 53: 4103-4105Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) using 12-s relaxation delay. The solvent resonance was suppressed by irradiation during relaxation delay and recovery time. T1 was calculated using built-in software. UV-visible absorption measurements were done on a Shimadzu UV-2100 spectrometer. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter at 25 °C. Stoichiometry and dissociation constant of the complex were determined according to the standard method (16Klotz I.M. Walker F.M. Bivan R.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1946; 68: 1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The method assumes nequivalent binding sites of macromolecule and that binding of first ligand does not influence the binding of additional ligands.1υ=Kdn[Lt]1−ΔφobsΔφmax+1nEquation 1 Δφobs is the change in the observed physical property, Δφmax is the maximum change in the observed physical property, Kd is the dissociation constant of the complex, and n is the number of ligand binding sites in the macromolecule. The molar ratio, ν, of bound ligands to the macromolecule is defined as (Δφobs/Δφmax) × ([Lt]/[Mt]), where [Lt] is the total ligand concentration and [Mt] is the total concentration of macromolecules added. Steady-state fluorescence intensity and anisotropy measurements were carried out using Spex Fluorolog 1681 T format spectrofluorophotmeter. Tryptophan residues were selectively excited with 295 nm radiation. Correction was done for inner filter effect using Equation 2 (17Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 19-110Crossref Google Scholar),Fcor=Fobs10AavEquation 2 where Fobs and Fcor are the observed and corrected fluorescence intensity, Aav = (Aex +Aem)/2, and Aex and Aem refer to the absorbances at excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. For determination of stoichiometry, emission was monitored at 344 nm. Time-resolved fluorescence studies were performed using tunable picosecond dye-laser pulse, from synchronously pumped cavity-dumped dye (Rhodamine 6G) laser driven by frequency-doubled output at 532 nm of the CW mode-locked Nd-YAG laser system. Fluorescence decay profiles were collected using a time-correlated single photon counting set-up coupled to a microchannel plate photomultiplier. The tunable output of the dye laser was frequency-doubled to generate second harmonic beam at 295 nm and was used to excite the samples. The instrument response function was obtained by collecting scattered light at 295 nm from the milk powder suspension in water. Before starting data collection, the instrument response was checked by measuring the lifetime ofN-acetyltryptophanamide. Emission profiles were collected at a magic angle of 54.7° to eliminate the contributions from the anisotropy decay. To get the fluorescence decay curves, 104counts at the peak were collected in 512 channels with channel width of 76 ps. The intensity decay data were fitted to a sum of exponential terms using least squares reconvolution procedure (18Grinvald A. Steinberg I.Z. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar),I(t)=∑i=13αiexp(−t/τi),∑αi=1Equation 3 where αi is the amplitude and τi is the fluorescence lifetime of theith component. The goodness of the fit was determined from the randomness of the weighted residual distribution and χ2. Analysis of the fluorescence decay profiles was also carried out using maximum entropy method (MEM) (19Beechem J.M. Brand L. Annu. Rev. Bichem. 1985; 54: 43-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) by choosing a distribution of amplitude (α(τ)) that yields maximum entropy (S), which is defined as shown by Equation 4 (20Jaynes E.T. Rosenkrantz R.D. Papers on Probability Statistics and Statistical Physics. Reidel, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1983: 401-424Google Scholar, 21Livesey A.K. Brochon A.K. Biophys.

Maximization of the function S was carried out under the χ2constraint defined as shown in Equation 5,χ2=1M∑​Mm=1(Fcalm−Fexpm)2ςm2≈1.0Equation 5 where Fcal and Fexp are the calculated and observed intensities, respectively, at time t, ςm2 is the variance of themth channel, and M is total number of data points. The optimized amplitude distribution represents maximum probable distribution of amplitudes among the different lifetime components. Fluorescence quenching can be represented by a Stern-Volmer plot (17Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 19-110Crossref Google Scholar, 22Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar), shown in Equation 6,F0F=1+Kq[Q]Equation 6 where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and in the presence of quencher, respectively, Kq is the quenching constant, and [Q] is the molar concentration of the quencher. The decay-associated emission spectra were computed from steady-state emission spectrum and fluorescence decay parameters (23Robbins D.J. Deibel Jr., M.R. Barkley M.D. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7250-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Yip R.W. Wen Y.-X. Szabo A.G. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 10458-10462Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), as shown by Equation 7,Fk(λ)=Fss(λ)αk(λ)τk∑kαk(λ)τkEquation 7 where Fk(λ) is the fluorescence intensity associated to the kth decay component with lifetime τk and pre-exponential amplitude αk at the wavelength λ.Fss(λ) is the intensity of the steady-state emission (total intensity) spectrum at wavelength λ. Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy (r) was calculated using the intensity of polarized emissions and is defined as shown by Equation 8,r=I∥−I⊥I∥+2I⊥Equation 8 where I∥ and I⊥ are the parallel and perpendicular components, respectively. For time-resolved anisotropy measurement, polarized emission was collected in the L-format arrangement of polarizer and analyzer. Geometry factor (G factor) for the time-correlated single photon counting set-up was determined usingN-acetyltryptophanamide solution, whose rotational correlation time (0.09 ns) is faster than its fluorescence lifetime (2.98 ns) by tail matching method. During data collection total time for perpendicular component was set equal to the time required for parallel component, times the G factor. The calculated anisotropy data were fitted to the following expression,r(t)=r0exp−tτrEquation 9 where τr is the rotation correlation time and r0 is the limiting anisotropy at zero time. The data were fitted to a single exponential, and the goodness of the fit was examined by random distribution of weighted residuals and χ2 value. NMR chemical shifts, linewidths (T2), and the resonance intensities of bound molecules are different from those of free ones and are influenced by the dynamics of exchange between free and bound species as well as their respective populations. Results of BPA (0.25 mm) complexed with different concentration of OG are depicted as a stack plot of 1H NMR spectra of OG (Fig. 1). It is observed that linewidth, peak intensities (Fig. 1A) and chemical shift positions (Fig. lC) vary monotonically with [OG]. This shows a fast exchange between bound and free OG species (25Lian L.Y. Barsukov I.L. Sutcliffe M.J. Sze K.H. Roberts G.C.K. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The changes in the chemical shifts of the ring A and ring B protons of OG indicate that these are directly involved in the interaction of OG with BPA. To get more insight into the binding, T1measurements for 1H and 13C resonances of OG have been carried out in free and in the presence of BPA (TableI). It may be noted that under extreme narrowing limits (ωτc ≪ 1)T1 decreases with the increase of rotation correlation time (τc). One notices that all 7 protons and 13C nuclei of OG uniformly exhibit lowT1 values. This is due to the fact that, on binding, τc experienced by OG becomes same as that of BPA, which is much higher. Hence, the observedT1 value, which is weighted average of the bound and free OG, is less than that of the free OG.Table ILongitudinal relaxation time (T1) of Orange G (10 mm) in phosphate buffer and in presence of BPA (0.5 mm)13CT11H T1In bufferWith BPAIn bufferWith BPAmsmsC2H108555665041951C4H92849624531056C5H6704761362818C6H11555682627896C12, 16H9396262136894C13, 15H11608241820764C14H8316702003815 Open table in a new tab Attempts have been made to obtain information about the conformation of OG in the bound and the free form using NOESY experiments. The NOESY spectrum of OG alone shows only weak and negative cross-peaks. This is true even for proton pairs such as H-4–H-5 and H-5–H-6, which are fairly close in space and should give rise to strong nuclear Overhauser effects. This is expected since OG is a small molecule and ω0τc for inter-proton vectors is expected to be less than 1. However, on binding with BPA, rotational correlation times for the inter-proton vectors will be much larger since OG-BPA complex will tumble like the BPA itself as shown byT1 measurements. This is indeed what is observed in the NOESY spectrum. Fig. 2 depicts the NOESY spectrum of OG in presence of BPA. The spectrum shows several cross-peaks between the proton pairs of OG including those between protons of ring A and ring B. It is clear that the conformation of bound OG is significantly different from that found in x-ray crystal structure (11Ojala W.H. Sudbeck E.A. Lu L.K. Richardson T.I. Lovrien R.E. Gleason W.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2131-2142Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In fact, if the crystal structure was maintained in the bound OG then none of the nuclear Overhauser effects between protons in ring A and ring B should have been observed. Obviously, the conformation of the bound OG is such that these two rings come close to each other and possibly stack as manifested in the chemical shift changes. A rotation around the N-N bond by 180° (anti →syn conformation) results in serious overlap between H-16 and O-7. Thus, the bound conformation arises from changes in torsional angles around the bonds H-8–N-9 and the N-10–C-11 leading to a fairly compact structure for the bound OG with N-9–N-10 bond in a non-planarsyn conformation. Difference absorption spectroscopy has been used to quantify the stoichiometry and affinity of ligand binding. The absorption spectrum (not shown) of OG consists of three bands centered at 240, 330, and 478 nm. The band at 478 nm, which is free from contamination due to protein absorption, has been monitored to follow binding. Binding isotherm generated from the absorption measurements (ΔA plotted against [BPA]) at 298 K attain saturation at ∼45 μm of BPA (Fig. 3A). A double inverse plot (Fig. 3A, inset) of change in absorption (1/ΔA) versus protein concentration (1/[BPA]) has been used to get maximum change in absorption (ΔAmax). The value of ΔAmax (0.22) thus obtained has been used in Equation 1 (Δφmax = ΔAmax, Δφ = ΔA). A double-reciprocal plot between ν ((ΔAobs[OGt])/(ΔAmax[BPA])) and free OG concentration ((1 − (ΔAobs/ΔAmax)[OGt]) is shown in Fig. 3B. The Kd and n obtained from the slope and intercept of the straight line are 10 ± 3 μm and 1.3 ± 0.3, respectively. The low value of Kd indicates high affinity of BPA to OG. BPA is known to experience a conformational transition around pH ≈ 4.5 from native state to “fast state,” a conformer that moves faster in the gel electrophoresis (26Aoki K. Foster J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1957; 79: 3385-3393Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We have estimated dissociation constant in the pH range 4–8 to find out the binding characteristics of the other conformer and the possibility of the involvement of ionizable groups of the side chain of amino acids present in BPA. It is observed that dissociation constant is more or less independent of pH in the range of 5–8 (Table II). However, a large increase in the dissociation constant (470 μm) occurs at pH 4.0. This is probably due to alterations in the conformation of the binding site in the fast state of BPA, which causes loose binding of OG.Table IIDissociation constant of BPA · OG complex at different pHpH of the mediumDissociation constantμm4.0473 ± 75.026 ± 36.011 ± 47.223 ± 48.412 ± 3 Open table in a new tab Thermodynamic parameters have been calculated using temperature dependence studies of dissociation constant. The negative value of enthalpy of dissociation (−35.3 kJ mol−1) indicates that the dissociation of BPA·OG complex is an exothermic process. The entropy of dissociation (−200 J mol−1 T −1) with a negative sign indicates unfavorable dissociation of the complex. The free energy of the dissociation (25 kJ mol−1), again indicates the high stability of the complex. Far-UV CD has been used to quantify the gross secondary structure of the protein (27Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar, 28Manavalan P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 29Johnson Jr., W.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 30Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1338: 161-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Far-UV CD spectrum of BPA and its complex with OG is given in Fig. 4A. The percentage of α-helix has been calculated using ellipticity at 222 nm (31Romeu A.M. Martino E.E. Stoppani A.O.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 439: 175-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The calculated value of the helicity (55%) is in good agreement with that reported in the literature. The CD of BPA·OG complex (1:1) (Fig. 4A (ii)) shows 10% increase in the helical content of the protein. The observed increase in the helical content may be due to an induced optical activity of far UV bands of bound OG or because of possible changes occurring in the CD of aromatic residues as a result of OG binding or both. The characteristics of the spectrum remain unchanged for higher concentration of OG. The near-UV CD spectra of OG (i), BPA (ii), and OG-BPA (iii) complex are shown in Fig. 4B. OG itself has no CD in the 250–300 nm region; hence, it does not interfere with the interpretation of protein spectrum. One observes definite changes in the spectrum of protein on complexation with OG. It is possible that the apparent changes are due to the induced activity of 240-nm band of the bound OG. Alternatively these changes can be correlated to conformational alterations in BPA. CD can also provide information about the environment of the ligand bound to protein (32Munro A.W. Lindsay J.G. Coggins J.R. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In many cases the free ligand is optically inactive, but on binding to the protein it may get immobilized in the asymmetric environment and thus give rise to induced CD signals in the characteristic absorption regions. OG is CD-inactive in the UV-visible region (Fig. 5). However, when BPA was added to a fixed concentration of OG (25 μm) there is a progressive induction of (−) and (+) CD at wavelengths 335 and 478 nm, respectively. This may be due to the induced asymmetry in the conformation of OG on binding to BPA (30Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1338: 161-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 33Krois D. Lehner H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin. Trans. 1995; 2: 489-494Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It may be noted that NMR results show that the conformation of OG changes significantly on binding with BPA. The analysis of binding isotherm (Fig. 5,inset) constructed from the CD at 335 nm using Equation 1gives dissociation constant of 4 μm and stoichiometry of 1:0.95. These values are in reasonable agreement with those calculated from the absorption data. Trp and Tyr present in the proteins can act as intrinsic fluorescent probes (34Teale F. Weber G. Biochem. J. 1957; 65: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). BPA has two Trps located in loop 3 and 4, respectively, at positions 135 and 214. These Trps are primarily responsible for BPA fluorescence. The steady-state fluorescence spectrum of BPA shows strong emission centered at 344 nm (Fig. 6A (a)). Addition of equimolar OG leads to 30% quenching of Trp fluorescence (Fig. 6A (b)) without apparent shift in emission maximum. On further addition of OG, the intensity of the fluorescence continues to decrease until BPA:OG ratio reaches 1:3 and levels off thereafter (Fig. 6A (c)). Out of two Trps in BPA, Trp-135 is more exposed to hydrophilic environment, whereas Trp-214 is buried in the hydrophobic core. It is concluded, therefore, that the residual fluorescence intensity is most likely due to inaccessibility of OG to the buried Trp. For the estimation of the stoichiometry, BPA has been added to a fixed concentration of OG and Trp fluorescence has been monitored. The experiments have been carried out for two concentrations of OG,e.g. 5 μm and 15 μm. The fluorescence intensity is plotted against [BPA]/[OG] (Fig. 6B). The stoichiometry obtained from the extrapolation of two linear portion of the curve is close to 1:1 for both concentrations. OG in aqueous solution when excited at 335 nm gives a weak fluorescence at 465 nm. On addition of equimolar or more BPA, no change in the fluorescence characteristics (e.g. emission maximum or intensity) can be observed. This indicates that quantum yield of OG does not change on binding to BPA. The binding isotherm generated by anisotropy measurement at different concentration of BPA (data not shown) is similar to the binding isotherm generated by absorption and CD studies. To get more insight into the mechanism of binding of OG to BPA, time-resolved fluorescence studies have been done. The data has been analyzed using an unbiased MEM to get distribution of lifetimes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results reveal two sets of lifetime distributions for native BPA (Fig. 7A), one centered at 6.2 ns contributing 70% of the total fluorescence, and other centered at 2.1 ns contributing the rest of the fluorescence. These two lifetimes have been assigned to the two Trps present in BPA on the basis of the following argument. Human serum albumin, which has a Trp at the conserved position 214, gives only 0.33 of total BPA fluorescence (35Peters T.J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1985; 37: 161-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (2534) Google Scholar). Thus, Trp-135 contributes more to the fluorescence of BPA than Trp-214. Hence, the intense peak in the lifetime distribution pattern centered at 6.2 ns corresponds to Trp-135 and the other peak (centered at 2.2 ns) is due to Trp-214. Addition of OG to BPA (1:1) causes a decrease in the amplitude of longer lifetime component with the appearance of a shorter lifetime component at 0.4 ns (Fig. 7B), which suggests the binding of OG near Trp-135. For BPA:OG (1:2), the contribution of the longer lifetime component decreases further and the full width at half maxium of Trp-214 reduces considerably (Fig. 7C). This decrease in the FWHM indicates a less heterogeneous environment of Trp-214 in BPA·OG complex than in BPA itself. A detailed analysis of the above data has been carried out using Equation 3. Fig. 8 is the decay profile of Trps present in BPA. The data has been fitted to a bi-exponential function giving rise to lifetimes of 6.16 and 2.13 ns with the amplitudes of 0.69 and 0.31, respectively, for two Trps. The χ2 value for this fit was 1.02. To understand the localization and influence of OG on lifetime, experiments have been carried out by varying the concentration of OG and analyzing the fluorescence decay at each concentration. The results are summarized in Fig. 9. It is observed that the lifetimes of the two species having lifetimes of 6.16 and 2.13 ns do not vary much with [OG]. However, the average lifetime decreases from 4.66 ns to 1.64 ns (Fig. 9A). This may be due to the decrease in the contribution of species with longer lifetime to total fluorescence intensity. On increasing the concentration of OG, a third lifetime component could also be seen. The lifetime of this component first increases slowly and later levels off after a value of ∼0.7 ns.Figure 9The dependence of lifetimes and amplitudes (calculated from the time-resolved data) on [OG].

The emission was monitored at 344 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 9B is the plot of the amplitude of different lifetime components with [OG]. The amplitude of the longer lifetime component decreases from 0.69 to 0.06, with the increase in [OG] indicating that OG selectively binds near the Trp-135 and quenches its fluorescence. The observed increase in the amplitude of Trp-214 may be due to the constraint imposed in the sum of the amplitudes, which should be unity in the process of analysis in Equation 3. The amplitude of third lifetime component increases with the increase of [OG]. The Stern-Volmer plots have been prepared at different temperatures (Fig. 10) to get the quenching mechanisms. For this purpose, OG has been added to fixed concentration of BPA (5 μm) and Trp fluorescence has been monitored. One notices that all the Stern-Volmer plots are not linear but show saturation at higher concentration of OG. Deviation of Stern-Volmer plot from the linearity is frequently observed whenever the quenching of Trp fluorescence of proteins occurs as a result of interaction of polar or charged quenchers, which do not readily penetrate the hydrophobic interior of the protein, and only the surface Trp residues get quenched (36Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). In BPA the two Trps are present in different environments. The quencher OG is charged, so it may not penetrate into the hydrophobic core of the protein. This indicates that Trp-214 is not accessible to OG as has been inferred from the earlier experiments. The marginal decrease in the initial slope of the Stern-Volmer plots with the increase of the temperature indicates that the quenching of BPA fluorescence by OG is static in nature. Supporting evidence is provided by τ0/τ versus [OG] plots (Fig. 10,lower part), which do not vary with [OG] (20Jaynes E.T. Rosenkrantz R.D. Papers on Probability Statistics and Statistical Physics. Reidel, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1983: 401-424Google Scholar). Thus, it can be inferred that the formation of complex takes place in the ground state of the fluorophore. The environment of Trp(s) has been investigated by separating the spectra of two Trps. The decay-associated spectra (DAS) were calculated from the wavelength dependence of the time-resolved fluorescence of BPA using Equation 7. The decay of the fluorescence with excitation wavelength 295 nm and emission wavelength ranging from 310 to 400 nm were analyzed using global analysis. In this analysis, the lifetime is assumed to be the same at all the wavelengths and the amplitude is the only allowed parameter that can vary with the wavelength. Fig. 11 shows the DAS of the BPA and BPA·OG complex. In the DAS of native protein, emission maximum of Trp-135 is at 347 nm contributing ∼ 75% of the BPA fluorescence, whereas for Trp-214 it is at 330 nm (Fig. 11A). Since the emission maxima for the two τvalues are different, they must be coming from two different Trps. This indicates that the environment of Trp-135 is hydrophilic and that of Trp-214 is hydrophobic (37Kronman M.J. Holmes L.G. Photochem. Photobiol. 1971; 14: 113-134Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In BPA·OG complex, three DAS are observed (Fig. 11B). In this case, due to the considerable quenching of Trp-135 fluorescence by OG, Trp-214 is the major contributor to total fluorescence. The large decrease in the fluorescence of Trp-135 confirms the binding of OG near to Trp-135. The emission maximum of Trp-135 (347 nm) is unaffected, whereas for Trp-214 it is red-shifted to 343 nm. The observed red-shift of 13 nm in the emission maximum indicates that Trp-214 gets more exposed to hydrophilic environment. This may be due to changes in the tertiary structure of the protein. Therefore, one may conclude that the binding of OG to BPA leads to a change in the conformation of BPA at tertiary level. It is known that the sulfonated compounds interact with amino acids such as Arg, Lys, His, etc., via sulfonate oxygen and make direct or indirect hydrogen bonds with the side chain NH (11Ojala W.H. Sudbeck E.A. Lu L.K. Richardson T.I. Lovrien R.E. Gleason W.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2131-2142Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A closer inspection of BPA sequence reveals the presence of such charged residues near Trp-135. This enhances the possibility of binding of OG near Trp-135. Moreover, OG, being a hydrophilic molecule with two sulfonate groups, is unlikely to penetrate deeper into the hydrophobic core of BPA and hence less likely to bind near Trp-214. For these reasons, the inference drawn that OG binds near Trp-135 seems to be more feasible. Although BPA is a single polypeptide chain, it is considered to be a multidomain protein (38Carter J.H. Ho J.X. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 153Crossref PubMed Scopus (3059) Google Scholar). The conformational changes in BPA structure at the quaternary level have been investigated using time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, which is related to the rotational dynamics of the emission dipole of the fluorophore. The fluorescence anisotropy decay due to two lifetime components were analyzed (Fig. 12). The χ2 of the fit was 1.12. The time-resolved anisotropy data of BPA and BPA·OG could be successfully fitted to single rotational correlation time of 37 and 35 ns. For human serum albumin, a similar molecular weight protein with a rotational correlation time of 34 ns has been reported (39Munro I. Pecht I. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Soc. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These values are very much comparable to the value of 39 ns calculated for a rigid hydrated spheres, indicating that it arises from a reorientation of Trps together with the whole protein and not because of the segmental motion of the Trps residues. Further, observation of a single and more or less same value of rotational correlation time for BPA and BPA·OG complex indicates that the overall globular structure of BPA remains unaltered on binding of OG despite certain internal rearrangement indicated by CD experiments in the protein structure as discussed above.

We demonstrate that fusions at a previously postulated hinge region, dividing the amino acid adenylating domains of peptide synthetase modules into two subdomains, and at the highly conserved 4′-phosphopantetheine binding motif in acyl-thioester forming domains resulted in enzymatically active hybrid domains. By contrast, most manipulations in condensation domains like deletions, the complete exchange or the construction of chimeric domains considerably reduced or completely abolished the amino acid adenylation and thioester formation activity of the hybrid module.

A large variety of small bioactive peptides are synthesized by microorganisms in a nonribosomal pathway (1Kleinkauf H. von Döhren H. Eur. J.

Lett. 1995; 125: 3-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) involving multimodular peptide synthetases. Genes encoding for peptide synthetases have been cloned from different origins and analyzed on the molecular level. Some prominent examples are the enzyme systems for the production of the immunomodulatory peptide cyclosporin A (3Weber G. Schörgendorfer K. Schneider-Scherzer E. Leitner E. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) from Tolypocladium inflatum, of the precursor for the antibiotic penicillin (4Diez B. Barredo J.L. Alvarez E.

Rodriguez F. de Ferra F. Grandi G. Perego M. Venema G. van Sinderen D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Peptide synthetases are composed as a sequence of specific amino acid activating modules, and each modular unit of about 110 kDa consists of catalytic domains responsible for the adenylation (A-domain), thioester formation (T-domain), and condensation (C-domain) of a specific amino acid (2Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 125: 3-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional domains for modifications of an amino acid residue like epimerization or N-methylation might be included. Due to their modular structure, these large enzymes may become a potential target for combinatorial manipulations. Distinct modules or domains might be exchanged to alter the specificity of the peptide synthetase, resulting in modified peptides with optimized biotechnical applications (8Stachelhaus T. Schneider A. Marahiel M.A. Science. 1995; 269: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 9Schneider A. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Gen.

The lipopeptide surfactin is one of the most efficient biosurfactants (11Arima K. Kakinuma A. Tamura G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 31: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) and its heptapeptide moiety is synthesized by the three surfactin synthetase subunits SrfA-A, SrfA-B, and SrfA-C (12Menkhaus M. Ullrich C. Kluge B. Vater J. Vollenbroich D. Kamp R.M J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7678-7684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ullrich C. Kluge B. Palacz Z. Vater J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6503-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Each of the enzymes SrfA-A and SrfA-B consist of three amino acid activating modules, while the monomodular subunit SrfA-C adds the last amino acid residue to the heptapeptide. Surfactin synthetase has developed to a model system for the engineering of peptide synthetases and several recombinant enzymes with altered amino acid specificities have already been constructed by module swapping (8Stachelhaus T. Schneider A. Marahiel M.A. Science. 1995; 269: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 9Schneider A. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although the technique is highly promising for the genetic engineering of novel peptide antibiotics, little information is so far available on the specific activity of recombinant peptide synthetases compared with the wild type enzymes. In addition, no detailed analysis of different fusion sites which might be suitable for the recombination of peptide synthetases has been made. The increased information obtained from the molecular characterization of several new peptide synthetases and from the three-dimensional structure of the A-domain of gramicidin synthetase A (14Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 18: 4174-4183Crossref Scopus (576) Google Scholar) provided first estimations of some distinct domains within multimodular peptide synthetases. It is evident that the structure and activity of hybrid enzymes should be influenced by the recombination procedure. We present here the construction and characterization of chimeric bimodular peptide synthetases derived from surfactin synthetase, and fused at different sites in putative inter- and intradomainic areas. A frequently encountered disadvantage in the analysis of recombinant peptide synthetases is the low level of enzyme production associated with the poor availability of purified protein. We were able to overcome this problem by the chaperone GroEL/GroES-dependent overproduction of the complete 395-kDa enzyme surfactin synthetase SrfA-A and of all analyzed bimodular hybrid enzymes in the heterologous host Escherichia coli. Surfactin synthetase A-A is among the largest proteins so far overproduced in E. coli. The purified enzyme is highly active in amino acid adenylation and could be converted to the holoenzyme by covalent modification with the cofactor 4′-phosphopantetheine after coincubation with the purified B. subtilis Sfp protein. Chromosomal DNA of the B. subtilis strain 21332 was used for the isolation of DNA fragments encoding for surfactin synthetases. For cloning procedures and as a host for plasmids we used the E. coli strain DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.). DNA fragments were cloned into the expression vectors pQE30 or pQE60 (Qiagen), and the enzymes were synthesized with an N-terminal poly(His)6-tag, or in the case of Srf-M1, with a C-terminal poly(His)6-tag. The plasmid pREP4-groESL (15Cole P.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 239-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was used for coexpression of chaperones. Bacterial cells were routinely grown at 28 °C in Luria broth (LB) supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics. A 10-liter fermenter with LB was inoculated 1:100 with a fresh overnight culture, and the cells were grown at 28 °C with continuous stirring at 80% oxygen saturation. The expression of peptide synthetases was induced with a final concentration of 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at anA590 of about 0.5, and the cells were incubated for additional 4 h. After harvesting by centrifugation, the cell pellets were stored at −70 °C or immediately used for the purification of the enzymes. General DNA manipulations like restrictions, ligations, transformations, and DNA isolations were performed as described (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The coding regions of Sfp and surfactin synthetase enzymes were amplified by PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. from chromosomal DNA ofB. subtilis strain 21332, concomitant with the addition of suitable restriction linkers according to TableI. If it was not possible to introduce the restriction site used for the construction of a hybrid enzyme by silent mutagenesis, one amino acid at the fusion site was substituted by a conservative replacement (Table II). The PCR was performed with Vent polymerase at annealing temperatures between 42 and 55 °C and with 25 cycles. We allowed 1 min of polymerization at 68 °C for each kilobase pair DNA to be synthesized. Each specific PCR reaction was optimized for the concentrations of Mg2+ and formamide. The PCR products were purified with the Jet Pure kit (Genomed) and cloned into the expression vectors pQE30 or pQE60. All constructs were verified by a detailed restriction analysis. The concentration of protein solutions was determined with the Bradford assay (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard.

Fresh cells or frozen pellets were resuspended in an about 5-fold volume of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and disrupted by passing three times through a French pressure cell. The cell debris was pelleted by ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 90,000 ×g, and the supernatants were subsequently filtered through a 0.22-μm syringe filter. The crude extracts were added to about 0.5 volumes of Ni-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen) equilibrated with column buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl), and were allowed to bind by shaking on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm for 1 h. The samples were then applied to a column and extensively washed with column buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After removing impurities with an imidazole gradient up to 20 mm in column buffer, the poly(His)6-tagged enzymes were eluted with an imidazole step of 150 mm. The protein fractions were supplemented with dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 1 mm, and in case of the Sfp protein, they were immediately used for enzymatic assays or stored at −70 °C with 5% glycerol. Peptide synthetases were precipitated by addition of ammonium sulfate up to 60% saturation. After centrifugation, the precipitate was dissolved in a small volume of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and extensively dialysed against this buffer. The samples were applied to a 370-ml Ultrogel AcA-34 column in case of surfactin synthetase SrfA-A, and to a 580-ml Sephacryl S-200 4R column in case of the bimodular hybrid enzymes. The chromatography was performed at a flow rate of 0.5 and 1 ml/min, respectively. Fractions containing peptide synthetases were monitored by SDS-PAGE and ATP/PPi exchange asssays. The enzymes were concentrated by ultrafiltration to about 1.5 mg/ml and immediately used for enzymatic assays or stored at −70 °C after adding glycerol to a final concentration of 5%. The amino acid adenylation activity of peptide synthetase modules was assayed by the ATP/PPiexchange technique as described (13Ullrich C. Kluge B. Palacz Z. Vater J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6503-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The standard reaction was carried out in a final volume of 200 μl containing 50 mmMES/HEPES, pH 6.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP or dATP, 0.1 mm PPi, and 2 mm amino acid. 32P-Labeled PPi was added to a total count rate of 0.1 μCi (240,000 cpm). The reaction was performed at 37 °C and was started by adding about 3–10 pmol of enzyme. The activities were determined in the linear range of the reactions, and means were calculated from at least three determinations. The covalent attachment ofl-glutamic acid and l-leucine to the enzymes by thioester formation was assayed using 14C-labeled amino acids (13Ullrich C. Kluge B. Palacz Z. Vater J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6503-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The standard reactions were carried out in a volume of 250 μl containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 9 mmMgCl2, 1.8 mm ATP, 0.66 mm EDTA, 1.7 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm coenzyme A, about 25 pmol of peptide synthetase, and about 0.25 μm recombinant Sfp protein (19Quadri L.E.N. Weinreb P.H. Lei M. Nakano M.M. Zuber P. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1585-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The thioester formation was started by adding 0.25 μCi of 14C-labeledl-glutamic acid or l-leucine, respectively. After incubation for 45 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. After 30 min on ice, the precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 15,000 × g, and the pellet was washed once with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The pellet was redissolved in 250 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, for about 2 h at room temperature, and the thioester formation was quantified in a liquid scintillation counter after addition of 10 ml of scintillation mixture. The reading frames encoding for the complete surfactin synthetase subunits SrfA-A and SrfA-C, and for thel-glutamic acid activating module Srf-M1, were amplified by PCR and cloned into the expression vectors pQE30 and pQE60, respectively. The resulting plasmids were named pH-SrfA-A, pH-SrfA-C, and pH-SrfM1, and the proteins were synthesized with a terminal poly(His)6-tag. The valine activating module Srf-M4 was encoded from plasmid pH-SrfM4 as described previously (20Elsner A. Engert H. Saenger W. Hamoen L. Venema G. Bernhard F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4814-4819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The two modules Srf-M1 and Srf-M4 carry intact C- and A-domains, and were deleted for their T-domains. The 395-kDa three-modular surfactin synthetase SrfA-A is one of the largest proteins so far heterologously produced in E. coli. The induction of srfA-Aexpression in E. coli strains like BL21 or DH5α resulted only in a barely visible protein band after SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1), which might be due to poor expression, or misfolding and rapid degradation of the protein. The 395-kDa SrfA-A protein band was at least 50-fold increased upon coexpression with the E. coli chaperones GroES/EL as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1). This indicates that the folding pathway or the stability of the large SrfA-A protein might require the Gro proteins. The strain DH5α (pREP4-groESL) was therefore selected for routine expression of all analyzed surfactin synthetase subunits and modules, and we obtained proteins with the expected molecular mass of 140 kDa with pH-SrfA-C and 108 kDa with pH-SrfM1 and pH-SrfM4. The proteins were purified in a two-step procedure involving nickel affinity chelate chromatography and gel filtration as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 2), and analyzed for their amino acid adenylating activity in the ATP/PPi exchange reaction. The SrfA-A protein accepted onlyl-leucine and l-glutamic acid out of the 20 proteinogenic l-amino acids, indicating a high degree of specificity for the cognate amino acid substrates (Table IV). The module specific for l-glutamic acid seems to have an about 4-fold lower activity than the l-leucine activating modules. As reported for other peptide synthetases, the replacement of ATP with dATP reduced the activities to about 30%. A considerable relative activity of about 20% was detected with d-leucine which might be accounted to the third module of the SrfA-A protein.Table IVEnzymatic characterization of recombinant multimodular surfactin synthetasesEnzymeAmino acidsMolecular massSpecific activityaDetermined with the ATP/PPi exchange assay in the linear range of the reaction.

The 108-kDa protein Srf-M1 was highly specific for l-glutamic acid and no detectable activity was obtained with one of the other proteinogenic 19 amino acids. As already observed in the context of the three-modular enzyme SrfA-A, the specific activity of the isolated glutamic acid activating module Srf-M1 was considerably lower than that of other modules and amounted to less than 50% relative to the specific activities of the enzymes SrfA-C and Srf-M4.Table IIIEnzymatic characterization of recombinant surfactin synthetase modulesEnzymeAmino acidsaAmino acids of the corresponding wild type enzymes.Molecular massSpecific activitybSpecific activities are determined with the ATP/PPiexchange assay in the linear range of the reaction.

Open table in a new tab The highly conserved sequence motif GRIDXQ is located about 135 amino acids N-terminal to the serine residue essential for the 4′-phosphopantetheine attachment, and represents a putative flexible hinge, separating the A-domains of peptide synthetase modules into two subdomains (Ref. 14Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 18: 4174-4183Crossref Scopus (576) Google Scholar, Table II). The coding regions of the l-valine-specific module Srf-M4 and thel-leucine activating subunit SrfA-C were recombined reciprocally within the hinge region (TableII and Fig. 3), and the amino acid adenylating activities of the resulting hybrid proteins SrfADH-M7/4 and SrfADH-M4/7 were analyzed. Both enzymes were active in the ATP/PPi exchange assay but the specific activities were reduced to about 5–8% relative to the wild type enzymes (TableIII). The amino acid specificity was determined by the N-terminal subdomain, i.e. the hybrid SrfADH-M4/7 was specific for l-valine, whereas only l-leucine activation was found for the hybrid SrfADH-M7/4. The hybrids SrfAD-M4/7 and SrfAD-M7/4 were recombined about 40 amino acids N-terminal to the hinge region (Table II, Fig. 3). The recombination at this fusion site seems to affect the larger subdomain of the A-domain and resulted in the complete loss of any detectable activity in the case of the hybrid SrfAD-M4/7, and in a relative residual activity of about 2% in the reciprocal hybrid SrfAD-M7/4. The results with monomodular hybrid enzymes indicated that the recombination of peptide synthetase modules at the specific hinge region within A-domains is feasible, but may be associated with a reduced enzymatic activity of the hybrid domain. We further analyzed the effect of a recombination at the hinge region on the enzymatic activity in the context of a bimodular enzyme. The N-terminal subdomain of the l-glutamic acid activating A-domain of SrfA-A was fused at the DNA level by genetic recombination with the C-terminal subdomain of the l-leucine-specific A-domain of module Srf-M2, whereas the l-leucine-specific module Srf-M3 was left unchanged (Fig. 4). The resulting bimodular enzyme with a hybrid A-domain in the first module was named SrfADH-M1/2–3. The sequence of the adenylation (A), thioester formation (T), and condensation (C) domains in the hybrid enzyme is C1-A1/2-T2-C3-A3-T3-CR(Fig. 4), where the numbers indicate the corresponding modules, and the CR domain represents an integrated racemase function at the C-terminal end of the module Srf-M3. The hybrid gene was expressed inE. coli (Fig. 2), and the purified 280-kDa protein was analyzed in the ATP/PPi exchange assay (TableIV). The recombination at the hinge region resulted again in an active hybrid domain, and its activation ofl-glutamic acid indicated, that the amino acid specificity resided in the N-terminal subdomain. The specific activity of the hybrid enzyme relative to the wild type enzyme SrfA-A was about 69% with l-glutamic acid, and about 21% withl-leucine. The hybrid enzyme SrfADH-M1/2–3 contained only one l-leucine activating module and, supposing a comparable activity of Srf-M2 and Srf-M3 in SrfA-A, about 50% relative activity should be expected. As the l-leucine activating module Srf-M3 should not be affected in the hybrid SrfADH-M1/2–3, our data indicate a higher specific activity of Srf-M2 compared with Srf-M3 in SrfA-A. The essentially unchanged relative activation of about 96% with d-leucine in SrfADH-M1/2–3, which we attribute to the module Srf-M3, further indicates an unaffected activity of the last module.

The bi-domain structure of NOS contains a C-terminal reductase domain that binds NADPH, FAD, and FMN and an N-terminal domain that binds heme, H4B, and l-Arg. The two domains are connected by a CaM consensus binding sequence. Binding of CaM to this interdomain hinge triggers the electron transfer from the FMN to the heme required to oxidizel-Arg to NO and citrulline. Three distinct mammalian NOS isoforms have been cloned and characterized: nNOS (NOS-I), iNOS (NOS-II), and eNOS (NOS-III). The activities of nNOS and eNOS are regulated by the cellular Ca2+ levels. However, CaM binds essentially co-translationally to iNOS, and its activity is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level rather than by the Ca2+ concentration (1Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu.

A high degree of sequence similarity exists among the NOS isoforms, in accord with their similar cofactor requirements and enzymatic properties (1Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev.

In this context, one of the unresolved mechanistic questions concerns the role of H4B in the NOS catalytic cycle. Two lines of evidence argue for a redox role for the pterin in NOS catalysis: (a) redox-inactive H4B analogs emulate the structural effects of H4B (dimer stabilization, increased substrate affinity, heme low- to high-spin shift), but do not sustain catalysis (7Pfeiffer S. Gorren A.C. Pitters E. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 8Mayer B. Wu C. Gorren A.C. Pfeiffer S. Schmidt K. Clark P. Stuehr D.J. Werner E.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8422-8427Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and (b) low-temperature experiments suggest that H4B provides the electron necessary to reduce the oxyferroheme intermediate to the species that oxidizes arginine to N-hydroxyarginine (9Bec N. Gorren A.C. Voelker C. Mayer B. Lange R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13502-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). A precedent for a redox role of H4B is provided by the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, in which H4B reacts with O2 to form a 4α-hydroperoxy complex. Reaction of this peroxy intermediate with a non-heme iron atom generates the Fe4+=O species actually involved in amino acid hydroxylation (10Chen D. Frey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25594-25601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of tyrosine hydroxylase shows that the iron is coordinated by a “2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad” (11Goodwill K.E. Sabatier C. Stevens R.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13437-13445Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), a motif also present in other non-heme iron proteins (12Hegg E.L. Que Jr., L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In tyrosine hydroxylase, these metal-coordinating residues are His-331, His-336, and Glu-376, with His-331 as the axial ligand and two water molecules at equatorial positions completing a square pyramidal geometry. Perry and Marletta (13Perry J.M. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11101-11106Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have reported that iNOS and nNOS are purified with roughly equivalent amounts of bound zinc and copper, respectively, but after desalting can be reconstituted with ferrous chloride to give proteins with one non-heme iron atom per monomer. This iron reconstitution reportedly increases the NO-synthesizing activity of both nNOS and iNOS (13Perry J.M. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11101-11106Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These authors argued that the DHH motif found in all the NOS enzymes (Asp-419, His-420, and His-421 in human eNOS) resembles the HHDAST motif in enzymes such as lysyl hydroxylase that catalyze iron-dependent hydroxylations. In lysyl hydroxylase, the aspartate and the second histidine coordinate to the non-heme iron atom (14Pirskanen A. Kaimio A.-M. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9398-9402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Perry and Marletta proposed that the aspartate and the second histidine in NOS similarly coordinate Fe2+. The increased catalytic activity upon incubation with Fe2+was ascribed to binding of the metal close to H4B. They furthermore found the nNOS H652A mutant (equivalent to the human eNOS H421A mutant) to be inactive and argued that the loss of activity was due to the role of this histidine in coordinating to the divalent metal. By analogy with lysyl hydroxylase, another of the proposed metal ligands in nNOS would be His-692, which corresponds to His-461 in human eNOS. The three-dimensional structure of the bovine eNOS heme domain indicates that the NOS enzymes have a metal-binding site at the monomer-monomer interface consisting of a Zn2+ coordinated to four cysteine residues, two from each monomer (15Raman C.S.

Crystallization of the iNOS heme domain can result in loss of the zinc and the formation of a disulfide bridge involving Cys-109 of the two monomers (16Fischmann T.O. Hruza A. Niu X.D. Fossetta J.D.

The five His-to-Ala mutants were constructed by overlap polymerase chain reaction, with two complementary mutagenic primers that introduced a new restriction site (silent mutations) to facilitate screening of the clones. The reverse mutagenic primer was used together with one primer that annealed at the polyhistidine N-terminal tag of pCWori (18Rodrı́guez-Crespo I. Gerber N.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

The forward mutagenic primer was used together with a primer that annealed after the unique KpnI site for the second partial reaction. Once the two partial reactions were completed, the two fragments were copurified and gel-extracted with the purpose of using them as templates for the long polymerase chain reaction in which only the primers that annealed at both ends were used.

Six liters of medium were used in a typical preparation. All subcloning and cloning was performed in E. coli DH5α cells, whereas protein expression was always performed in the protease-deficient E. coli BL21 DE3 strain. The cell paste was resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin, 1 mm pepstatin, 1 mm antipain, and 10% glycerol) plus 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme. When needed, 1 mm l-Arg plus 10 μm H4B were also added to the lysis buffer and kept throughout the entire purification process. The cells were then disrupted by pulse sonication (18Rodrı́guez-Crespo I. Gerber N.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11462-11467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 19Rodrı́guez-Crespo I. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Purification of the mutants was performed by binding the proteins to the Ni2+-NTA-agarose after removal of the cell debris by ultracentrifugation. The column was first washed with 5 column volumes of buffer A (with 500 rather than 100 mm NaCl) plus 100 μm CaCl2, and the proteins were then eluted from the column with 150 mm imidazole in buffer A. The protein eluted from the Ni2+-NTA-agarose column was diluted 2-fold with distilled water to lower the ionic strength and was loaded onto the 2′,5′-ADP-agarose column pre-equilibrated with buffer B (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin, 1 mm pepstatin, 1 mm antipain, and 10% glycerol) in the presence, when desired, of 1 mm l-Arg plus 10 μm H4B. The column was washed with 3 volumes of buffer B containing 100 μm CaCl2, and the protein was eluted with 10 mm 2′-AMP in buffer C (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, protease inhibitors, and 10% glycerol). The purified proteins were stored at −70 °C, and freeze-thawing was avoided. The only exception to the above procedure was the purification of EDTA-treated iNOS. In this case, the procedure was as described previously (20Hühmer A.F.R. Nishida C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Schöneich C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 618-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), except that imidazole was never used, and the protein was eluted from the Ni2+-NTA column by stripping the Ni2+ with 50 mm EDTA in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (as above). The protein was then bound to ADP-agarose and washed with 4 column volumes of 50 mm EDTA in buffer D (50 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol) to remove protein-bound Ni2+. Another wash was performed with 8 column volumes of buffer D. Purification was then continued as before in the absence of EDTA. Since the H421A and H146A mutants displayed a high tendency to lose the heme prosthetic group, spectral analyses were also performed for these proteins immediately after the protein was eluted from the Ni2+-NTA-agarose column. To study the time-dependent binding of H4B to the protein, the base-line spectrum of the protein was recorded in the presence of 10 mm l-Arg. Addition of 100 μm H4B induced a progressive increase in the high-spin component and a progressive decrease in the low-spin component of the spectrum. The first difference spectrum was recorded 1 min after H4B addition, and successive spectra were recorded every 5 min at 25 °C. The spectra were plotted, and theA390 nm − A430 nmvalues were calculated. The spin change (A390 nm − A430 nm) was plotted versus time, and the plot was fitted to the following equation: (A390 nm −A430 nm) = A*(1 − exp(−kt)), where A is the maximum absorbance value and k is a kinetic refolding constant. Aliquots of the mutant proteins (200 μl, ∼0.5 mg/ml) were analyzed at 25 °C on an LCC 500-Plus FPLC system equipped with two P-500 pumps, a Superdex HR200 column, and a monitor set at 280 nm. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and the buffer consisted of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, and 100 mm NaCl. When desired to promote dimer formation, the buffer included 1 mm l-Arg and 0.5 μmH4B. The column void volume was determined with dextran blue, and the total volume with potassium ferricyanide. The column was calibrated with the following proteins (Sigma): thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and horse myoglobin (17 kDa). The calibration curve was obtained by plotting the (ve −v0)/(vt −v0) ratio against the log of the molecular mass, where ve is the elution volume of the protein,v0 is the void volume of the column, and vt is the total bed volume of the column. The elution positions of the dimer (∼10.5 ml) and monomer (∼11.5 ml) were used as a reference (19Rodrı́guez-Crespo I. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were obtained by placing the proteins (2–5 μm) in a septum-sealed cuvette under vacuum and adding NADPH (100–300 μm). No CaM was added since the proteins were coexpressed with human CaM (19Rodrı́guez-Crespo I. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ concentration was kept constant at 100 μm. After recording the spectrum, CO was purged into the cuvette for 3 min, and the cuvette was resealed to preserve the CO atmosphere. Spectra were recorded immediately on a Varian Cary 1E spectrophotometer connected to a Lauda circulating water bath set at 30 °C. The activities of the eNOS mutant proteins were determined at 37 °C by measuring the conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin (18Rodrı́guez-Crespo I. Gerber N.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11462-11467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 19Rodrı́guez-Crespo I. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The initial rates of NO production were determined from ΔA401–411 nm (Δε401–411 nm= 60 mm−1 cm−1) on a Cary 1E spectrophotometer. The final assay sample volume was 0.5 ml. The protein concentration was calculated using ε400 nm = 100 mm−1 cm−1 for the ferric enzyme under conditions that maximized the high-spin state (i.e.high concentrations of l-Arg and H4B). When the NO-releasing activities of the NOS enzymes were assayed in the presence of divalent cations, freshly prepared stock solutions of 4 mm ferrous sulfate or zinc sulfate in 100 mmTris buffer, pH 7.0, were utilized. These solutions were used to prepare 0.4 mm stock solutions of both salts, again in 100 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.0. Addition of 5 μl of these fresh solutions to a final assay volume of 0.5 ml (see above) resulted in a 100-fold dilution (final concentrations of 40 and 4 μm). The Fe2+ or Zn2+ solutions were added to the assay mixture, and the rates were immediately measured. The metal content in NOS samples was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy by Ernest Appelhans of Garratt-Callahan Co. (Millbrae, California). The rate of reduction of cytochrome c was measured at 37 °C using ε550 nm = 21 mm−1cm−1. Reaction mixtures containing 50 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μmCaCl2, 500 μm NADPH, 50 μmcytochrome c, 50 units of catalase, and 2–5 μg of eNOS were initiated by adding cytochrome c and NADPH. Both H4B and dithiothreitol were avoided when cytochromec reduction was assayed to minimize the buffer-mediated reduction. His-146 is located far from the active site in the α2 helix of eNOS (Fig. 1) (15Raman C.S. Li H. Martasek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Expression of the H146A mutant and elution from Ni2+-NTA-agarose yielded a protein with a Soret absorption maximum at 408 nm despite the presence of the 150 mm imidazole used to elute the protein from the column (Fig. 2, trace 1). Addition of up to 30 mm l-Arg plus 30 μmH4B did not induce a low- to high-spin shift in the Soret maximum. The absence of a distinct 427 nm absorption peak in the H146A mutant in the presence of imidazole indicates that either the heme distal site is occupied by another ligand or the proximal thiolate ligand has been lost. The absence of a Soret band shift in the presence of high concentrations of l-Arg and H4B confirms that major alterations have occurred in the heme environment. When the H146A mutant was reduced with NADPH under a CO atmosphere, the reduced CO difference spectrum exhibited only a cytochrome P420 peak (Fig. 2, inset).Figure 2Spectral characterization of the H146A mutant. Trace 1, electronic absorption spectrum of the H146A mutant purified from the Ni2+-NTA-agarose column and incubated with 30 mm l-Arg plus 30 μm H4B for 15 min; trace 2, electronic absorption spectrum of the full-length H146A mutant eluted from the 2′,5′-ADP-agarose column. The insetshows the NADPH-dependent formation of a reduced CO complex of the H146A mutant eluted from the first affinity column (trace 1). A spectrum was taken every 3 min. Identical results were obtained with three different preparations of this mutant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The H146A mutant eluted from Ni2+-NTA-agarose was further purified by chromatography on a 2′,5′-ADP-agarose column. The absorption spectrum of the resulting protein (Fig. 2, trace 2) shows that the heme was lost during the column washes, leaving only the residual electronic absorbance of the flavin domain. The H146A mutation, despite its distance from the heme group, perturbed the active site sufficiently that the heme was incorrectly coordinated and dissociated from the protein during normal chromatographic procedures. His-214 is located at the C-terminal end of the α4 helix at some distance from the heme group (Fig. 1) (15Raman C.S. Li H. Martasek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein was obtained in high purity by the procedure employed previously to purify wild-type human and bovine eNOS. Spectroscopically, this mutant is indistinguishable from wild-type eNOS (Fig. 3). The Soret maximum at 395 nm (Fig. 3, trace 1) obtained in the presence of l-Arg and H4B indicates that the heme is in the high-spin state in the presence of these factors. Addition of 30 mm imidazole to this protein induced a high- to low-spin shift, as indicated by the final Soret maximum at 427 nm with an α/β-band at 550 nm (Fig. 3, trace 2). When this mutant was analyzed by gel filtration on a Superdex HR200 column, the protein dimer was found to predominate. An asymmetric peak was seen at ∼10.5 ml, with a broad shoulder at longer elution volumes that masked the position of the monomer at ∼11.5 ml (Fig. 3). This elution profile is identical to that for the wild-type protein analyzed under similar conditions (18Rodrı́guez-Crespo I. Gerber N.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11462-11467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 19Rodrı́guez-Crespo I. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The NO-synthesizing activity of the H214A mutant (230 nmol min−1 mg−1) is slightly higher than that of wild-type human eNOS (200 nmol min−1 mg−1). The cytochrome c-reducing activity of the H214A mutant in the presence of CaM (2500 nmol min−1 mg−1) is similar to that of the wild-type enzyme (3000 nmol min−1mg−1). His-420 and His-421 are located at the beginning of the α9 helix (Fig. 1) (15Raman C.S. Li H. Martasek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) in a region close to the heme site proposed to undergo a large rearrangement upon dimerization (17Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1998; 279: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). The imidazole side chains of His-420 and His-421 are hydrogen-bonded to Asp-397 in the neighboring subunit and thus participate in interactions that stabilize the dimer structure. We were unable to obtain the full-length H420A mutant, apparently because it is proteolyzed in the E. coli expression system. Heme insertion in the isolated protein was imperfect, as the protein eluted from the Ni2+-NTA-agarose column did not exhibit the usual low-spin spectrum due to the imidazole complex. Its absorption maximum was at 406 nm and did not shift to a high-spin spectrum in the presence of large concentrations of l-Arg and H4B (data not shown). The full-length H421A mutant could be expressed and purified, although its heme group was mostly in the low-spin state (Fig. 4, left panel). Addition of NADPH under a CO atmosphere to the protein eluted from the Ni2+-NTA column resulted in reduction of the flavins and the progressive formation of an Fe2+·CO complex with a maximum at 450 nm (Fig. 4, left panel and inset). Although formation of the cytochrome P450 complex did not go to completion, the extent to which it was formed correlated with the fraction of full-length dimers in the sample as judged by FPLC. Since electron transfer in the NOS dimer appears to be atrans-process (i.e. from the flavins of one monomer to the heme of the other) (21Siddhanta U. Presta A. Fan B. Wolan D. Rousse"
https://openalex.org/W2028607043,"To better define the role of 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) on transcriptional regulation of the human tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α gene, monocytic human THP-1 cells were transfected with two TNF-α promoter constructs spanning base pairs −1897/−1 and −1214/−1, respectively, and linked to the rabbit β-globin gene. Quantitative globin gene expression of chimerae was measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. A construct linking the chicken β-actin promoter and a deleted portion of the β-globin gene was cotransfected and used as internal standard.

In contrast, endogenous TNF-α gene regulation measured by the same reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction procedure was vigorous. Remarkably, ligation of 3′UTR to chimeric constructs led to a drastic drop in the basal level of chimeric gene expression, resulting in a 15- to 40-fold induction of the reporter gene. Consistently, when the TNF-α promoter was replaced by the cytomegalovirus early immediate promoter, gene expression was also uniformly reduced but was no longer up-regulated upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1.

TNF-α gene expression mediated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or by MHC class II ligands such as bacterial superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) appears to be regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (5Beutler B.

Remarkably, TNF-α promoter responses were only weakly induced by LPS, and even in non-stimulated cells, a significant constitutive gene expression was detected (8Goldfeld A.E. Doyle C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9769-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 9Takashiba S. Van Dyke T.E. Shapira L. Amar S. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1529-1534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of human TNF-α 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) in post-transcriptional control of TNF-α mRNA has been well documented (10Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). A conserved sequence element in the 3′UTR of several cytokines in several species, the TTATTTAT element, normally confers translational repression (10Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp.

A. 1986; 83: 1670-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). Whereas this UA-rich motif also confers instability to many cytokine mRNAs, TNF-α transcript stability appears to be unchanged after cell stimulation by LPS (10Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 12Han J. Huez G. Beutler B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1843-1848PubMed Google Scholar, 13Han J. Beutler B. Huez G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was first demonstrated in the mouse that TNF-α promoter and 3′UTR synergized to regulate murine TNF-α gene expression (12Han J. Huez G. Beutler B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1843-1848PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, constitutive expression of mouse TNF-α promoter in non-macrophage cell line L929 could be suppressed by ligating mouse 3′UTR to chimeric CAT constructs, indicating that mouse 3′UTR also played a role in silencing TNF-α gene in cells in which it was not expressed (14Kruys V. Kemmer K. Shakhov A. Jongeneel V. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this study, we extend these observations to the human cell line THP-1 and demonstrate, using constructs derived from the human TNF-α promoter, that despite a vigorous induction of endogenous TNF-α, no significant regulation of a reporter gene could be detected upon cell stimulation by LPS or TSST-1. Regulation of two TNF-α chimeric constructs could only be obtained after TNF-α 3′UTR ligation to promoter constructs. These data indicate that the TNF-α gene promoter and its 3′UTR cooperate in regulating gene expression at the transcriptional level in humans as well.DISCUSSIONWe have shown here that the TNF-α 3′UTR plays a crucial role in human TNF-α gene transcriptional regulation, an observation that further extends its role in RNA transcript stability and translation as described previously (23Beutler B. Han J. Kruys V. Giroir B.P. Beutler B. Tumor Necrosis Factors. Raven Press, New York1992: 561-574Google Scholar). In our approach, we took advantage of a reporter gene system that allows direct analysis of RNA expression, in contrast to CAT or luciferase gene assays, which are less appropriate to tackle this issue. These latter systems involve protein enzymatic assays that not only reflect transcriptional regulation but, depending on the transfected chimera, also reflect the post-transcriptional and/or translational regulations that can affect the final enzymatic activity. Because TNF-α 3′UTR contains sequences that can modulate translation (10Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), we overcame this pitfall by directly measuring RNA transcripts. Thus, it appeared that chimeric constructs driven by large fragments of the human TNF-α promoter were strongly expressed in the monocytic cell line THP-1 but only weakly regulated by stimuli such as TSST-1 and LPS. These data are consistent with results from Goldfeldet al. (8Goldfeld A.E. Doyle C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9769-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), who transfected human TNF-α promoter-CAT chimeric constructs in the murine monocytic cell line P3888D1 and found a significant level of expression of the chimeras in uninduced cells. In agreement with our data, only weak (1.5- to 2-fold) induction by LPS could be detected. Takashiba et al. (9Takashiba S. Van Dyke T.E. Shapira L. Amar S. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1529-1534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who also used CAT assays, found similar induction ratios. Very different results were obtained for the mouse gene because a strong induction by LPS was detectable in chimeric constructs containing mouse TNF promoter only (24Drouet C. Shakhov A.N. Jongeneel C.V. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1694-1700PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, kB-type enhancers were involved in the transcription of the murine gene (25Shakhov A.N. Collart M.A. Vassalli P. Nedospasov S.A. Jongeneel C.V. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) but not the human gene (8Goldfeld A.E. Doyle C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9769-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Although the regulation of human and mouse TNF genes differs in many respects, we took advantage of previous observations on the murine gene to design the chimeric constructs studied here. The role of mouse 3′UTR on chimeric gene expression has been well documented (12Han J. Huez G. Beutler B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1843-1848PubMed Google Scholar, 13Han J. Beutler B. Huez G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 14Kruys V. Kemmer K. Shakhov A. Jongeneel V. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In particular, mouse TNF-α 3′UTR is able to suppress TNF-α promoter constitutive activity in non-macrophage cell lines (14Kruys V. Kemmer K. Shakhov A. Jongeneel V. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it interacts with the mouse TNF-α 5′ end to modulate chimeric CAT construct expression (12Han J. Huez G. Beutler B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1843-1848PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown in this study that human TNF-α 3′UTR suppressed the strong basal expression of TNF-α promoter constructs observed in its absence in unstimulated THP-1 cells and partially restored gene regulation in induced cells. This regulation could be due to transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional phenomena. Evidence for transcriptional regulation was provided by the analysis of constructs in which TNF-α promoter fragments were replaced with the CMV immediate early promoter. CMV chimeric constructs linked to the TNF-α 3′UTR were expressed at a level comparable to TNF-α promoter constructs. However, the expression of CMV chimeric construct CMV/3′s was poorly regulated or was not regulated, in contrast to chimeric constructs 1/3′s and 2/3′s. These results are in agreement with previous studies on the murine TNF-α gene (12Han J. Huez G. Beutler B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1843-1848PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kruys V. Kemmer K. Shakhov A. Jongeneel V. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and indicate that these observations hold true for human TNF-α gene regulation. Taken together, our data suggest that 5′ TNF-α promoter and 3′UTR regions interact with one another to regulate TNF-α gene expression at transcriptional level as well. The interaction between the 3′ and 5′ regions appears to be independent of the type of stimulation. DNA fragments used in these experiments are large, and the identification of potential cis- and trans- regulatory elements in both the 5′ or 3′ regions will require the study of smaller gene fragments. TNF-α transcription may be enhanced by stimulatory mechanisms and/or the release of a pre-existing block. The precise characterization of transcription factors binding to DNA regions essential for regulated expression of the TNF-α gene may open new perspectives in the understanding of human diseases related to abnormal TNF-α gene expression. Interestingly, mutated genomic sequences in regions flanking the 3′ TTATTTAT signal element of TNF-α gene have been described in murine models (27Jacob C.O. Lee S.K. Strassmann G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3043-3050PubMed Google Scholar), but not in young patients with autoimmune diseases (28Becker L. Brown T. Fink C. Marks J. Lvandosky G. Giroir B.P. Pediatr. Res. 1995; 37: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Because our results demonstrate the presence of other crucial regulatory domains interacting with promoter regions, the precise identification of discrete regulatory elements may help us to better understand the regulation of the TNF-α gene in inflammatory diseases.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7575-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and inflammation. TNF-α gene expression mediated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or by MHC class II ligands such as bacterial superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) appears to be regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (5Beutler B. Cerami A. Nature. 1986; 320: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar, 6Trede N.S. Geha R.S. Chatila T. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2310-2315PubMed Google Scholar, 7Espel E. Garcia-Sanz J.A. Aubert V. Menoud V. Sperisen P. Fernandez N. Spertini F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2417-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Remarkably, TNF-α promoter responses were only weakly induced by LPS, and even in non-stimulated cells, a significant constitutive gene expression was detected (8Goldfeld A.E. Doyle C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9769-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 9Takashiba S. Van Dyke T.E. Shapira L. Amar S. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1529-1534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of human TNF-α 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) in post-transcriptional control of TNF-α mRNA has been well documented (10Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). A conserved sequence element in the 3′UTR of several cytokines in several species, the TTATTTAT element, normally confers translational repression (10Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 11Caput D. Beutler B. Hartog K. Thayer R. Brown-Shimer S. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1670-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). Whereas this UA-rich motif also confers instability to many cytokine mRNAs, TNF-α transcript stability appears to be unchanged after cell stimulation by LPS (10Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 12Han J. Huez G. Beutler B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1843-1848PubMed Google Scholar, 13Han J. Beutler B. Huez G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was first demonstrated in the mouse that TNF-α promoter and 3′UTR synergized to regulate murine TNF-α gene expression (12Han J. Huez G. Beutler B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1843-1848PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, constitutive expression of mouse TNF-α promoter in non-macrophage cell line L929 could be suppressed by ligating mouse 3′UTR to chimeric CAT constructs, indicating that mouse 3′UTR also played a role in silencing TNF-α gene in cells in which it was not expressed (14Kruys V. Kemmer K. Shakhov A. Jongeneel V. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this study, we extend these observations to the human cell line THP-1 and demonstrate, using constructs derived from the human TNF-α promoter, that despite a vigorous induction of endogenous TNF-α, no significant regulation of a reporter gene could be detected upon cell stimulation by LPS or TSST-1. Regulation of two TNF-α chimeric constructs could only be obtained after TNF-α 3′UTR ligation to promoter constructs. These data indicate that the TNF-α gene promoter and its 3′UTR cooperate in regulating gene expression at the transcriptional level in humans as well. DISCUSSIONWe have shown here that the TNF-α 3′UTR plays a crucial role in human TNF-α gene transcriptional regulation, an observation that further extends its role in RNA transcript stability and translation as described previously (23Beutler B. Han J. Kruys V. Giroir B.P. Beutler B. Tumor Necrosis Factors. Raven Press, New York1992: 561-574Google Scholar). In our approach, we took advantage of a reporter gene system that allows direct analysis of RNA expression, in contrast to CAT or luciferase gene assays, which are less appropriate to tackle this issue. These latter systems involve protein enzymatic assays that not only reflect transcriptional regulation but, depending on the transfected chimera, also reflect the post-transcriptional and/or translational regulations that can affect the final enzymatic activity. Because TNF-α 3′UTR contains sequences that can modulate translation (10Han J. Brown T. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), we overcame this pitfall by directly measuring RNA transcripts. Thus, it appeared that chimeric constructs driven by large fragments of the human TNF-α promoter were strongly expressed in the monocytic cell line THP-1 but only weakly regulated by stimuli such as TSST-1 and LPS. These data are consistent with results from Goldfeldet al. (8Goldfeld A.E. Doyle C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9769-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), who transfected human TNF-α promoter-CAT chimeric constructs in the murine monocytic cell line P3888D1 and found a significant level of expression of the chimeras in uninduced cells. In agreement with our data, only weak (1.5- to 2-fold) induction by LPS could be detected. Takashiba et al. (9Takashiba S. Van Dyke T.E. Shapira L. Amar S. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1529-1534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who also used CAT assays, found similar induction ratios. Very different results were obtained for the mouse gene because a strong induction by LPS was detectable in chimeric constructs containing mouse TNF promoter only (24Drouet C. Shakhov A.N. Jongeneel C.V. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1694-1700PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, kB-type enhancers were involved in the transcription of the murine gene (25Shakhov A.N. Collart M.A. Vassalli P. Nedospasov S.A. Jongeneel C.V. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) but not the human gene (8Goldfeld A.E. Doyle C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9769-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Although the regulation of human and mouse TNF genes differs in many respects, we took advantage of previous observations on the murine gene to design the chimeric constructs studied here. The role of mouse 3′UTR on chimeric gene expression has been well documented (12Han J. Huez G. Beutler B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1843-1848PubMed Google Scholar, 13Han J. Beutler B. Huez G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 14Kruys V. Kemmer K. Shakhov A. Jongeneel V. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In particular, mouse TNF-α 3′UTR is able to suppress TNF-α promoter constitutive activity in non-macrophage cell lines (14Kruys V. Kemmer K. Shakhov A. Jongeneel V. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it interacts with the mouse TNF-α 5′ end to modulate chimeric CAT construct expression (12Han J. Huez G. Beutler B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1843-1848PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown in this study that human TNF-α 3′UTR suppressed the strong basal expression of TNF-α promoter constructs observed in its absence in unstimulated THP-1 cells and partially restored gene regulation in induced cells. This regulation could be due to transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional phenomena. Evidence for transcriptional regulation was provided by the analysis of constructs in which TNF-α promoter fragments were replaced with the CMV immediate early promoter. CMV chimeric constructs linked to the TNF-α 3′UTR were expressed at a level comparable to TNF-α promoter constructs. However, the expression of CMV chimeric construct CMV/3′s was poorly regulated or was not regulated, in contrast to chimeric constructs 1/3′s and 2/3′s. These results are in agreement with previous studies on the murine TNF-α gene (12Han J. Huez G. Beutler B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1843-1848PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kruys V. Kemmer K. Shakhov A. Jongeneel V. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and indicate that these observations hold true for human TNF-α gene regulation. Taken together, our data suggest that 5′ TNF-α promoter and 3′UTR regions interact with one another to regulate TNF-α gene expression at transcriptional level as well. The interaction between the 3′ and 5′ regions appears to be independent of the type of stimulation. DNA fragments used in these experiments are large, and the identification of potential cis- and trans- regulatory elements in both the 5′ or 3′ regions will require the study of smaller gene fragments. TNF-α transcription may be enhanced by stimulatory mechanisms and/or the release of a pre-existing block. The precise characterization of transcription factors binding to DNA regions essential for regulated expression of the TNF-α gene may open new perspectives in the understanding of human diseases related to abnormal TNF-α gene expression. Interestingly, mutated genomic sequences in regions flanking the 3′ TTATTTAT signal element of TNF-α gene have been described in murine models (27Jacob C.O. Lee S.K. Strassmann G. J.

https://openalex.org/W2067932439,"The 3-hydroxysteroid sulfotransferases that have been isolated and cloned from humans and rodents appear to have broad substrate specificities. In the guinea pig, however, two 3-hydroxysteroid sulfotransferases have been isolated that function according to an innate stereospecificity: the α-isoform acts on steroids with a 3-hydroxyl group oriented in the α position, whereas the β-isoform acts on steroids where the 3-hydroxyl group is in a β orientation. To examine the structural basis for this remarkable stereoselectivity, chimeras of the two enzymes, which are 87% identical, were constructed. A chimera consisting of the NH2-terminal 91 amino acids of the α-isoform and the COOH-terminal 196 amino acids of the β-isoform displayed activity similar to that of the α-isoform. Site-selected mutagenesis of this 3α/β-hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase chimera involving the 12 amino acid differences that exist between the two isoforms within the 91 amino acid NH2-terminal region revealed that the amino acid residue at position 51 plays a fundamental role in determining the stereospecificity exhibited by the α- and β-isoforms,i.e. if residue 51 is an asparagine, α activity predominates, whereas if an isoleucine is in that position, β activity prevails.

A major metabolic route in the biotransformation of steroidal compounds is via sulfoconjugation or sulfonation (1Bernstein S. Solomon S. Chemical and Biological Aspects of Steroid Conjugation. Springer-Verlag New York, Inc., New York1970Google Scholar). Steroid sulfonation, which occurs widely across species (2Hobkirk R. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1985; 63: 1127-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), is catalyzed by a family of enzymes termed sulfotransferases, enzymes typically isolated from the cytosolic fraction of tissue preparations (3Roy A.B. Trudinger P. The Biochemistry of Inorganic Compounds of Sulphur. Cambridge University Press, London1970Google Scholar). Sulfotransferase enzymes are of immense biological significance in that they are involved in both genomic and nongenomic steroid action (4Strott C.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 670-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).Steroid sulfotransferases acting on neutral steroids have been isolated and cloned from several species (4Strott C.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 670-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar); these enzymes, although not always carefully examined, appear for the most part to have broad substrate specificities. An apparent exception to this rule was thought to be the guinea pig; in this species, two physically distinct forms of 3-hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase (HST), 1The abbreviations used are: HST, hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.1The abbreviations used are: HST, hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. specifically a 3α-HST and a 3β-HST, were isolated from the adrenal gland (5Driscoll W.J. Martin B.M. Chen H.-C. Strott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23496-23503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The guinea pig 3α-HST and 3β-HST enzymes demonstrated remarkable substrate selectivity with respect to the spatial orientation of the ring A 3-hydroxyl group (5Driscoll W.J. Martin B.M. Chen H.-C. Strott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23496-23503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, these enzymes were considered to be not only stereoselective but also site-specific in that they acted only on a 3-hydroxyl group. It was recently discovered, however, that the 3α-HST isoform, in contrast to the 3β-HST isoform, would also sulfonate the 17β-hydroxyl group of testosterone 2The trivial names of steroids used are: androsterone, 3α-hydroxy-5α-androstan-17-one; allopregnanolone, 3α-hydroxy-5α-pregnan-20-one; dehydroepiandrosterone, 3β-hydroxy-5-androsten-17-one; pregnenolone, 3β-hydroxy-5-pregnen-20-one; testosterone, 17β-hydroxy-4-androsten-3-one; estradiol, 1,3,5(10)-estratriene-3,17β-diol.2The trivial names of steroids used are: androsterone, 3α-hydroxy-5α-androstan-17-one; allopregnanolone, 3α-hydroxy-5α-pregnan-20-one; dehydroepiandrosterone, 3β-hydroxy-5-androsten-17-one; pregnenolone, 3β-hydroxy-5-pregnen-20-one; testosterone, 17β-hydroxy-4-androsten-3-one; estradiol, 1,3,5(10)-estratriene-3,17β-diol. and estradiol (6Park B.C. Lee Y.C. Strott C.A. Steroids. 1999; (in press): 64PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, with respect to the 3-hydroxyl group, the 3α-HST enzyme acts only on 3α-hydroxylated steroids such as androsterone and allopregnanolone, whereas the 3β-HST enzyme acts on 3β-hydroxylated steroids such as pregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone. Thus, regarding the 3-carbon position of neutral steroids, the guinea pig HST isoforms appear to behave quite differently from their rodent and human counterparts by exhibiting a more precise substrate stereospecificity. The 3α-HST isoform with a calculated molecular mass of 33,637 daltons and pI of 6.3 (7Lee Y.C. Park C.-S. Strott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15838-15845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the 3β-HST isoform with a calculated molecular mass of 34,033 daltons and pI of 7.3 (8Luu N.X. Driscoll W.J. Strott C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1078-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) have been cloned and kinetically analyzed.The structural basis for the stereoselectivity of the 3α-HST and 3β-HST isoforms, which are 87% identical, is not known. Therefore, we set out to examine this question by creating chimeras of the two 3-HST isoforms in combination with site-selected mutagenesis. The results of these studies, which form the basis for this report, suggest that the 3-hydroxy stereospecificity shown by guinea pig 3α-HST and 3β-HST largely resides within the NH2-terminal 91 amino acids of the proteins. In particular, the amino acid residues at position number 51 plays a crucial role.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Wild Type and Chimeric cDNAsFull-length cDNAs encoding the 3α-HST and 3β-HST isoforms were subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pProEX HTc (Life Technologies, Inc.) at SalI and NotI sites. Briefly, the HST cDNAs (nucleotides −7 to +896) were amplified by PCR using primers designed to contain SalI and NotI sense primer (5′-ACGACGTCGACCACCACCATGTCAGATAACACTC-3′) and antisense primer (5′-ATAACAATTGCGGCCGCCACAGCAGTATCCAAATAAC-3′) restriction enzyme sites. Amplified DNAs were purified by Wizard PCR Preps purification system (Promega, Madison, WI), digested withSalI and NotI, and purified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis followed by Gene Clean II (Bio 101 Inc., Vista, CA). The restricted DNAs were ligated into the expression vector that was similarly digested and purified. The resulting plasmids (HST-pProEX HTc) were amplified using Max Efficiency DH5α competent bacteria (Life Technologies, Inc.) and purified with Qiagene DNA purification kit (Qiagene, Inc., Santa Clarita, CA).Chimeras were constructed utilizing a unique EcoO109I restriction enzyme site present at nucleotide 273 in both the 3α-HST and 3β-HST cDNAs. The HST-pProEX HTc plasmids were digested withSalI and EcoO109I, and the restriction fragments were separated by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis and purified by Gene Clean II. To construct the 3α/β-HST chimera, the smallSalI/EcoO109I restriction fragment of the 3α-HST upstream cDNA was ligated to the largeSalI/EcoO109I restriction fragment corresponding to the 3′ portion of 3β-HST as well as the vector; the 3β/α-HST chimera was similarly constructed.Site-selected MutagenesisSite-selected mutagenesis was performed by PCR usingPfu DNA polymerase according to the method of Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Based on the amino acid sequence alignment of 3α-HST and 3β-HST, primers were designed to make amino acid substitutions at residue sites where a difference existed between the two isomers. In all, eight constructs were prepared as outlined in Table I; primers used to produce the eight constructs are depicted in Table II.Table IAmino acid substitutions involving the guinea pig 3α/β-hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase chimera and 3β-hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase wild typeConstructSubstitutionsA. 3α/β-HST chimera:1C17G; I22L2C17G; I22L; F80T; T81Q; G82H; Y84N3C17G; I22L; F80T; T81Q; G82H; Y84N; P6L4C17G; I22L; F80T; T81Q; G82H; Y84N; L65W; N71I5C17G; I22L; F80T; T81Q; G82H; Y84N; V87M; G89S6C17G; I22L; F80T; T81Q; G82H; Y84N; N51IB. 3β-HST wild type:7I51N8I71NThe guinea pig 3α/β-hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase (3α/β-HST) chimera consists of amino acids 1–91 of 3α-hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase and amino acids 92–287 of 3β-hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase (cf. Fig. 2B). Location of amino acid substitutions are indicated for each numbered construct of the 3α/β-HST chimera (A) and 3β-hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase (3β-HST) wild type (B). For substitutions involving the 3α/β-HST chimera, α-HST amino acid residue substitutions precede the residue numbers, whereas the β-HST amino acid substitutions follow the residue numbers. Conversely, for the 3β-HST wild type enzyme, β-HST amino acid residue substitutions precede the residue numbers, whereas the α-HST amino acid substitutions follow the residue numbers (cf. amino acid sequences for 3α-HST and 3β-HST in Fig. 2A).

The aim here was to substitute β-HST-specific amino acid residues for α-HST-specific amino acid residues in the α-HST portion of the 3α/β-HST chimera. For construct number 1, the codons for amino acids Cys17 and Ile-22 in the chimera were mutated to yield Gly and Leu residues using the 3α/β-HST chimera as template. For construct number 2, in addition to the mutations carried out for construct number 1, the codons for amino acids Phe-80, Thr-81, Gly-82, and Tyr-84 were altered to generate Thr, Gln, His, and Asn residues at those respective sites using construct number 1 as template. For construct numbers 3–6, construct number 2 was used as a template; in construct number 3, the codon for Pro-6 was changed to produce a Leu; in construct number 4, codons for Leu-65 and Asn-71 were mutated to yield Trp and Ile, respectively, at those sites; in construct number 5, codons for Val-87 and Gly-89 were altered to create Met and Ser, respectively, at those sites; in construct number 6, the codon for Asn-51 was changed to produce an Ile at that site.Construct Numbers 7 and 8 Involved Single Mutations of 3β-HST Wild Type (Table I)Each of these constructs was produced using the appropriate primers as detailed in Table II and 3β-HST wild type as template. For construct number 7, the codon for Ile-51 was altered to create an Asn at that position; for construct number 8, the codon for Ile-71 was mutated to produce an Asn at that site.3-Hydroxysteroid Sulfotransferase Expression and PurificationThe HST chimeras and mutant constructs were used to transform Max Efficiency DH5α competent bacteria (Life Technologies, Inc.). Positive colonies were selected by PCR using HST-specific primers and bacteria in the PCR reaction mixture. Plasmids were purified from positive colonies and sequenced using Thermo Sequenase Radiolabeled Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The selected bacteria were grown at 32 °C to anA600 of 0.5 at which time 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to induce fusion protein synthesis, and the incubations were continued for an additional 4 h. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed in 1:1 (w/v) of column buffer (50 mm soduim phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) containing 10 mm imidazole and 1 mg/ml lysozyme followed by brief sonication. Bacterial lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatants were applied to nickel affinity columns (Qiagene, Inc., Valencia, CA). Columns were washed with 20 mm imidazole in column buffer, and the bound fusion proteins were eluted with 250 mm imidazole in column buffer. Eluted proteins were concentrated and equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 15% glycerol using a Centriprep 30 (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA). To remove the fused protein from HST, the concentrated fusion protein preparation (0.1 mg) was incubated with 500 units of recombinant TEV protease (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 16 h at 4 °C and resubjected to nickel affinity column chromatography. Unbound protein in the flow-through was collected, concentrated, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting as described previously (9Lee Y.C. Driscoll W.J. Strott C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2003-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (10Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (212995) Google Scholar).Enzymatic Assays and Kinetic AnalysesThe radiolabeled steroids, [3H]androsterone (54 Ci/mmol) and [3H]pregnenolone (21 Ci/mmol), were purchased from NEN Life Science Products; crystalline steroids were obtained from Steraloids, Inc. (Wilton, NH). 3′-Phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate was obtained from Sigma. Sulfotransferase activity was assayed in a buffer consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mm magnesium acetate to which 0.1 mmphosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate and varying concentrations of radiolabeled steroids (0.05–2.0 μm) were added. All reactions were carried out with 1 μg of purified protein in a total volume of 100 μl for either 2.5 or 5 min at 37 °C, unless otherwise specified. Reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 0.1 n NaOH, and the unreacted steroids were separated from sulfoconjugates by solvent partitioning with 0.8 ml of dichloromethane and vigorous vortexing. The aqueous and organic phases were separated by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 3 min. The radioactivity in the aqueous phase was measured by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Radioactivity in the aqueous phase of unreacted samples (NaOH addition to enzyme mixture prior to substrate) was used as a blank, and the value was subtracted from each sample.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe aim of these studies was to determine which amino acid residues are responsible for the striking stereospecificity demonstrated by the guinea pig 3α-HST and 3β-HST isoforms. These HST isoforms are distinguished by the fact that the α-isoform will sulfonate 3-hydroxylated steroids such as androsterone, which have the 3-hydroxyl group spatially oriented in the α position, but will not sulfonate 3-hydroxylated steroids such as pregnenolone, which have the 3-hydroxyl group in a β orientation (Fig. 1A); on the other hand, the β-isoform sulfonates 3β-hydroxylated steroids (pregnenolone), in contrast to 3α-hydroxylated steroids (androsterone) (Fig. 1B).Sequence Analysis and Chimera FormationThe 3α-HST and 3β-HST isoforms are 87% identical (Fig. 2A). Although most of the amino acid differences between the two isoforms are scattered throughout the proteins, there are three regions where a substantial number of differences are concentrated (Fig. 2A). To examine the most NH2-terminal of these regions, chimeras were constructed whereby the NH2-terminal 91 amino acids of one isoform was joined to the COOH-terminal 196 amino acids of the other isoform. For reasons that are not clear, the chimera consisting of the upstream 91 amino acid region of the α-isoform fused to the downstream 196 amino acid region of the β-isoform (Fig. 2B) was more highly expressed by a considerable measure than the reverse construct; therefore, the so-called 3α/β-HST chimera was employed in these investigations. Interestingly, the 3α/β-HST chimera demonstrated a substrate specificity (Fig. 1C) that was nearly identical to the 3α-HST wild type (cf. Fig. 1A), as distinct from the 3β-HST wild type (cf. Fig. 1B). This result suggested that the structural determinants regulating the 3-hydroxysteroid substrate stereoselectivity, which characterizes the guinea pig 3-HST isoforms, largely resides within the NH2-terminal 91 amino acid region of the proteins. It should be noted that although poorly expressed, the reverse 3β/α-HST chimera demonstrated a preference for 3β-hydroxylated steroids (data not presented).Figure 2Amino acid sequence of 3α-HST wild type, 3β-HST wild type, and the 3α/β-HST chimera.

The α-HST portion of the chimera (black lettering on white background) consists of the NH2-terminal 91 amino acids; the β-HST portion of the chimera (black lettering on gray background) consists of the COOH-terminal 196 amino acids. In the α-HST portion of the chimera, the location of the amino acid dissimilarities existing between the α- and β-HST isomers in that region of the protein (refer to theupper panel) is indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Amino Acid Substitutions Involving the 3α/β-HST ChimeraThe α portion of the 3α/β-HST chimera contains 12 amino acid residues that are dissimilar from those in the corresponding region of the 3β-HST isoform (the location of these differences are indicated by arrows in Fig. 2B). Therefore, we set out to examine the relative importance of each amino acid difference in determining the stereoselectivity manifested by the 3β-HST enzyme. These experiments involved selectively substituting 3β-HST amino acid residues for corresponding 3α-HST amino acid residues in the 3α/β-HST chimera. Six substituted constructs of the 3α/β-HST chimera were generated as presented in Table I. Four of the substituted constructs involving 9 of the 12 amino acid differences continued to exhibit steroid stereospecificity behavior akin to the 3α-HST wild type and essentially the same as the unaltered 3α/β-HST chimera (Figs.Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). A fifth substituted construct, however, displayed a clear difference from the previous constructs. That is, a distinction between 3α-HST and 3β-HST activity was not evident, and the 3α-hydroxylated and 3β-hydroxylated steroid substrates were sulfonated in an essentially equivalent manner (Fig. 7). This result suggested that amino acid residues at position 87 and/or 89 of the 3-HST isoforms might be playing a role in determining substrate specificity. The amino acid residues at position 87 (valine in 3α-HST and methionine in 3β-HST) are conservative, suggesting that the amino acids residues at position 89 might be the more critical. The 6th construct, which involved the 12th and final amino acid difference, demonstrated behavior that, for the first time, was more akin to the 3β-HST wild type and clearly distinct from the unaltered 3α/β-HST chimera, i.e. it sulfonated the 3β-hydroxylated steroid substrate more actively than the 3α-hydroxylated steroid substrate (Fig. 8). This last result strongly suggested that the amino acid residue at position 51 plays an especially important role in conferring the characteristic stereospecificity demonstrated by the guinea pig 3-HST isoforms.Figure 6Sulfotransferase activity curves for mutated 3α/β-HST chimera (construct number 4 in Table I).

In one construct, asparagine, which is present at residue position 51 in 3α-HST, was substituted for the isoleucine that normally is present at that position in 3β-HST. When tested, this construct exhibited activity that was now similar to the first four constructs described above; that is, it displayed behavior more akin to the 3α-HST wild type and the unaltered 3α/β-HST chimera (Fig. 9). As a control, the second construct consisted of a similar substitution, i.e. an asparagine for an isoleucine, made at position 71 of 3β-HST. When tested, this construct exhibited enzymatic behavior that was indistinguishable from the 3β-HST wild type enzyme (Fig. 10). The results of these latter experiments strengthen the case for the amino acid residue at position 51 as playing a crucial role in determining the 3-hydroxy stereospecificity that characterizes the guinea pig 3α-HST and 3β-HST isoforms.Figure 9Sulfotransferase activity curves for the I51N mutant of 3β-HST wild type (construct number 7 in Table I).
