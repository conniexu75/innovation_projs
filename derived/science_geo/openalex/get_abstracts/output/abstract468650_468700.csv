https://openalex.org/W2002060477,"Western blotting has been a key technique for determining the relative expression of proteins within complex biological samples since the first publications in 1979. Recent developments in sensitive fluorescent labels, with truly quantifiable linear ranges and greater limits of detection, have allowed biologists to probe tissue specific pathways and processes with higher resolution than ever before. However, the application of quantitative Western blotting (QWB) to a range of healthy tissues and those from degenerative models has highlighted a problem with significant consequences for quantitative protein analysis: how can researchers conduct comparative expression analyses when many of the commonly used reference proteins (e.g. loading controls) are differentially expressed? Here we demonstrate that common controls, including actin and tubulin, are differentially expressed in tissues from a wide range of animal models of neurodegeneration. We highlight the prevalence of such alterations through examination of published ""-omics"" data, and demonstrate similar responses in sensitive QWB experiments. For example, QWB analysis of spinal cord from a murine model of Spinal Muscular Atrophy using an Odyssey scanner revealed that beta-actin expression was decreased by 19.3±2% compared to healthy littermate controls. Thus, normalising QWB data to β-actin in these circumstances could result in 'skewing' of all data by ∼20%. We further demonstrate that differential expression of commonly used loading controls was not restricted to the nervous system, but was also detectable across multiple tissues, including bone, fat and internal organs. Moreover, expression of these ""control"" proteins was not consistent between different portions of the same tissue, highlighting the importance of careful and consistent tissue sampling for QWB experiments. Finally, having illustrated the problem of selecting appropriate single protein loading controls, we demonstrate that normalisation using total protein analysis on samples run in parallel with stains such as Coomassie blue provides a more robust approach."
https://openalex.org/W2106809747,"The popular theory that complex tool-making and language co-evolved in the human lineage rests on the hypothesis that both skills share underlying brain processes and systems. However, language and stone tool-making have so far only been studied separately using a range of neuroimaging techniques and diverse paradigms.We present the first-ever study of brain activation that directly compares active Acheulean tool-making and language. Using functional transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (fTCD), we measured brain blood flow lateralization patterns (hemodynamics) in subjects who performed two tasks designed to isolate the planning component of Acheulean stone tool-making and cued word generation as a language task. We show highly correlated hemodynamics in the initial 10 seconds of task execution.Stone tool-making and cued word generation cause common cerebral blood flow lateralization signatures in our participants. This is consistent with a shared neural substrate for prehistoric stone tool-making and language, and is compatible with language evolution theories that posit a co-evolution of language and manual praxis. In turn, our results support the hypothesis that aspects of language might have emerged as early as 1.75 million years ago, with the start of Acheulean technology."
https://openalex.org/W2086023759,"Cyclomarin A (CymA) was identified as a mycobactericidal compound targeting ClpC1. However, the target was identified based on pulldown experiments and in vitro binding data, without direct functional evidence in mycobacteria. Here we show that CymA specifically binds to the N-terminal domain of ClpC1. In addition we have determined the co-crystal structure of CymA bound to the N-terminal domain of ClpC1 to high resolution. Based on the structure of the complex several mutations were engineered into ClpC1, which showed reduced CymA binding in vitro. The ClpC1 mutants were overexpressed in mycobacteria and two showed resistance to CymA, providing the first direct evidence that ClpC1 is the target of CymA. Phe80 is important in vitro and in cells for the ClpC1-CymA interaction and this explains why other bacteria are resistant to CymA. A model for how CymA binding to the N-terminal domain of ClpC1 leads to uncontrolled proteolysis by the associated ClpP protease machinery is discussed.Background: Cyclomarin A is a mycobactericidal natural product that binds to ClpC1 in vitro.Results: ClpC1 binds to the N-terminal domain of ClpC1 and the CymA-ClpC1 co-crystal structure identifies CymA-binding residues that, when mutated, confer resistance to CymA in vivo.Conclusion: CymA targets ClpC1 inside mycobacteria.Significance: This is the first direct evidence that cyclomarin kills mycobacteria by binding to ClpC1.

Measuring tuberculosis burden, trends, and the impact of control programmes.Lancet Infect. Dis. 2008; 8: 233-243Google Scholar). Inappropriate usage of anti-TB drugs for decades has resulted in the development of multi- and extensively drug-resistant TB that do not respond to the first-line anti-TB drugs such as isoniazid and rifampicin and second line treatment such as aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones (2.Ma Z.

Baulard A.R. Déprez B. Willand N. Tuberculosis. The drug development pipeline at a glance.Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2012; 51: 1-16Google Scholar). Suitable treatment options are limited and identification of new therapeutics against TB is of utmost importance, especially because multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB strains are being identified from all countries surveyed (2.Ma Z.

The cyclic antibiotic cyclomarin A (CymA) was identified as a potent antitubercular compound in a natural product whole cell screen (4.Schmitt E.K. Riwanto M. Sambandamurthy V. Roggo S. Miault C. Zwingelstein C. Krastel P. Noble C. Beer D. Rao S.P. Au M. Niyomrattanakit P. Lim V. Zheng J. Jeffery D. Pethe K. Camacho L.R. The natural product cyclomarin kills Mycobacterium tuberculosis by targeting the ClpC1 subunit of the caseinolytic protease.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed Engl. 2011; 50: 5889-5891Google Scholar). Importantly it kills both growing and dormant, non-replicating mycobacteria. CymA, a heptapeptide from Streptomyces, and an amino alcohol derivative referred to as CymA1, are potent against multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis, suggesting that they have a novel mode of action (4.Schmitt E.K. Riwanto M. Sambandamurthy V. Roggo S. Miault C. Zwingelstein C. Krastel P. Noble C. Beer D. Rao S.P. Au M. Niyomrattanakit P. Lim V. Zheng J. Jeffery D. Pethe K. Camacho L.R. The natural product cyclomarin kills Mycobacterium tuberculosis by targeting the ClpC1 subunit of the caseinolytic protease.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed Engl. 2011; 50: 5889-5891Google Scholar). Attempts to produce spontaneous resistant mutants against CymA to identify potential target genes by genome sequencing were unsuccessful. Instead a chemical-proteomic approach identified the caseinolytic protein C1 (ClpC1) as the target of CymA (4.Schmitt E.K. Riwanto M. Sambandamurthy V. Roggo S. Miault C. Zwingelstein C. Krastel P. Noble C. Beer D. Rao S.P. Au M. Niyomrattanakit P. Lim V. Zheng J. Jeffery D. Pethe K. Camacho L.R. The natural product cyclomarin kills Mycobacterium tuberculosis by targeting the ClpC1 subunit of the caseinolytic protease.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed Engl. 2011; 50: 5889-5891Google Scholar). Protein-degradation assays suggested that CymA was increasing proteolysis mediated by the caseinolytic protease (ClpP) inside the cell. CymA binding did not affect the ATPase activity of ClpC1 and no bactericidal activity was seen in a panel of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, despite them containing ClpC (4.Schmitt E.K. Riwanto M. Sambandamurthy V. Roggo S. Miault C. Zwingelstein C. Krastel P. Noble C. Beer D. Rao S.P. Au M. Niyomrattanakit P. Lim V. Zheng J. Jeffery D. Pethe K. Camacho L.R. The natural product cyclomarin kills Mycobacterium tuberculosis by targeting the ClpC1 subunit of the caseinolytic protease.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed Engl. 2011; 50: 5889-5891Google Scholar). Caseinolytic protein C (ClpC) is a molecular chaperone known to exist in all kingdoms of life. It belongs to the Hsp100 family of AAA+ proteins (5.Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. HSP100/Clp proteins. A common mechanism explains diverse functions.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Google Scholar). clpC1 is an essential gene for mycobacterial growth (6.Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Genes required for mycobacterial growth defined by high density mutagenesis.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Google Scholar). M. tuberculosis possesses four Clp ATPase proteins namely ClpC1, ClpX, ClpX′ (ClpC2), and ClpB and two Clp protease paralogs, ClpP1 and ClpP2 (7.Ribeiro-Guimarães M.L. Pessolani M.C. Comparative genomics of mycobacterial proteases.Microb. Pathog. 2007; 43: 173-178Google Scholar). In several bacteria, Clp Hsp100 proteins, together with the ClpP form 4-ring ATP-dependent proteolytic machines (8.Wang F. Mei Z. Qi Y. Yan C. Hu Q. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure and mechanism of the hexameric MecA-ClpC molecular machine.Nature. 2011; 471: 331-335Google Scholar). The pathway of degradation from intact or partly folded proteins to free amino acids can be either ATP dependent or independent (9.Chandu D. Nandi D. Comparative genomics and functional roles of the ATP-dependent proteases Lon and Clp during cytosolic protein degradation.Res. Microbiol. 2004; 155: 710-719Google Scholar). ClpP-mediated proteolysis aids in removal of dysfunctional proteins and maintenance of protein homeostasis in bacterial cells (10.Sauer R.T. Bolon D.N. Burton B.M. Burton R.E. Flynn J.M. Grant R.A. Hersch G.L. Joshi S.A. Kenniston J.A. Levchenko I. Neher S.B. Oakes E.S. Siddiqui S.M. Wah D.A. Baker T.A.

Molecular chaperones and protein quality control.Cell. 2006; 125: 443-451Google Scholar). Only short peptides are hydrolyzed rapidly by ClpP itself. Globular proteins need to go through energy-dependent degradation by the ClpC-ClpP machinery in mycobacteria and other Gram-positive bacteria (12.Kress W. Maglica Z. Weber-Ban E. Clp chaperone-proteases. Structure and function.Res. Microbiol. 2009; 160: 618-628Google Scholar). Within the complex, ClpC takes up the role of recognizing and ATP-dependent unfolding of specific proteins and translocating the unfolded polypeptides to ClpP for degradation (13.Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. AAA+ proteases: ATP-fueled machines of protein destruction.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 587-612Google Scholar). ClpC1 is well conserved across various mycobacteria and is known to be an essential protein for bacterial growth (4.Schmitt E.K. Riwanto M. Sambandamurthy V. Roggo S. Miault C. Zwingelstein C. Krastel P. Noble C. Beer D. Rao S.P. Au M. Niyomrattanakit P. Lim V. Zheng J. Jeffery D. Pethe K. Camacho L.R. The natural product cyclomarin kills Mycobacterium tuberculosis by targeting the ClpC1 subunit of the caseinolytic protease.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed Engl. 2011; 50: 5889-5891Google Scholar). M. tuberculosis ClpC1 shares 100 and 95% identity with ClpC1 from M. bovis BCG (Pasteur) and M. smegmatis, respectively. M. tuberculosis ClpC1 is an 848-amino acid protein with inherent ATPase activity, made up of an N-terminal helical domain (N) and two distinct nucleotide-binding or ATPase domains, D1 and D2 (14.Kar N.P. Sikriwal D. Rath P. Choudhary R.K. Batra J.K. Mycobacterium tuberculosis ClpC1. Characterization and role of the N-terminal domain in its function.FEBS J. 2008; 275: 6149-6158Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of ClpC1 is completely conserved in all known mycobacteria and has about 63% identity to that of Bacillus subtilis. Crystal structures are available for B. subtilis ClpC and its complex with the adaptor protein MecA (8.Wang F. Mei Z. Qi Y. Yan C. Hu Q. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure and mechanism of the hexameric MecA-ClpC molecular machine.Nature. 2011; 471: 331-335Google Scholar). Full-length ClpC1 proteins from M. tuberculosis and B. subtilis are almost 60% identical. However, unlike B. subtilis and many other Gram-positive bacteria, M. tuberculosis does not have any known adaptor proteins for ClpC1. M. tuberculosis ClpC1 is known to stimulate protein degradation by its association with the ClpP proteins. ClpP1 and ClpP2 alone do not show protease activity. Only when the ClpP1 and ClpP2 subunits interact to form a hetero-tetradecameric complex do they exhibit protease activity. ClpP1P2 protease activity in vitro requires the presence of ATP and a dipeptide activator (15.Akopian T. Kandror O. Raju R.M. Unnikrishnan M. Rubin E.J. Goldberg A.L. The active ClpP protease from M. tuberculosis is a complex composed of a heptameric ClpP1 and a ClpP2 ring.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 1529-1541Google Scholar). A functional ClpP1P2 protease complex is essential for M. tuberculosis growth in vitro and during infection (16.Raju R.M. Unnikrishnan M. Rubin D.H. Krishnamoorthy V. Kandror O. Akopian T.N. Goldberg A.L. Rubin E.J. Mycobacterium tuberculosis ClpP1 and ClpP2 function together in protein degradation and are required for viability in vitro and during infection.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8: e1002511Google Scholar). ClpP, under control of its associated chaperone is a tightly regulated protease and only degrades short peptides. Inhibition of ClpP or the chaperone activity will result in toxic accumulation of protein aggregates, whereas their activation leads to uncontrolled proteolysis. Both events are fatal to bacteria. The natural antibiotics, acyldepsipeptides (ADEPs), are known to target the ClpP protease and prevent its interaction with the regulatory ATPase, resulting in uncontrolled proteolysis. ADEP binding converts ClpP into a dis-regulated protease, which hydrolyzes nascent polypeptide chains that are not yet folded (17.Brötz-Oesterhelt H. Beyer D. Kroll H.P. Endermann R. Ladel C. Schroeder W. Hinzen B. Raddatz S. Paulsen H. Henninger K. Bandow J.E. Sahl H.G. Labischinski H. Dysregulation of bacterial proteolytic machinery by a new class of antibiotics.Nat.

The antibiotic ADEP reprogrammes ClpP, switching it from a regulated to an uncontrolled protease.EMBO Mol. Med. 2009; 1: 37-49Google Scholar). The structures of B. subtilis ClpP and its complex with ADEPs reveal a closed-to-open gate transition of the ClpP N-terminal region, and ADEPs occupy part of the ATPase subunit-binding site, thereby directly blocking binding (19.Lee B.G. Park E.Y. Lee K.E. Jeon H. Sung K.H. Paulsen H. Rübsamen-Schaeff H. Brötz-Oesterhelt H. Song H.K. Structures of ClpP in complex with acyldepsipeptide antibiotics reveal its activation mechanism.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 471-478Google Scholar). The essential bacterial cell division protein, FtsZ, is prone to degradation by the ADEP-ClpP complex. By preventing cell division, ADEPs inhibit a vital cellular process (20.Sass P. Josten M. Famulla K. Schiffer G. Sahl H.G. Hamoen L. Brötz-Oesterhelt H. Antibiotic acyldepsipeptides activate ClpP peptidase to degrade the cell division protein FtsZ.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 17474-17479Google Scholar). To gain a better understanding of the mode of action of M. tuberculosis ClpC1 and its interaction with CymA, we undertook biophysical and crystallographic analysis. We show that CymA binds to the N-terminal domain of ClpC1 and have solved the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of ClpC1 in complex with CymA to a resolution of 1.18 Å. The amino acids responsible for CymA binding were identified and mutants that were overexpressed in Mycobacterium bovis BCG (Pasteur) and Mycobacterium smegmatis showed resistance to CymA, directly showing that ClpC1 is the cellular target of CymA. A mechanism of action for CymA, as well as an explanation for why other bacteria are not inhibited by CymA is proposed. This work confirms ClpC1 as a promising target for anti-mycobacterial drug discovery. PCR was carried out on the ClpC1 gene optimized for overexpression in E. coli (Genscript, NJ) for the N-terminal domain (NTD; residues 1–145), D1 domain (residues 165–493), N-D1 domain (residues 1–493), D2 domain (residues 498–838), and full-length ClpC1 (residues 1–848). The genes coding for the various domains were cloned into a pET30(a) plasmid vector between NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. The proteins were overexpressed with a non-cleavable C-terminal His tag in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Invitrogen) by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. The initial construct for ClpC1 NTD was in a pGEX-6P-1 plasmid, cloned between BamHI and EcoRI sites, and expressed as a fusion protein with Prescission protease cleavable N-terminal GST tag. F2A, F2Y, F80A, F80Y, E89A, and E89Q mutants of ClpC1 NTD protein were generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, CA) on the pET30(a)-ClpC1 NTD construct. The mutations were confirmed by gene sequencing. Overexpression of the individual mutants followed the same protocol as that of wild type ClpC1 NTD. The proteins overexpressed with a C-terminal His tag were purified using a HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden), followed by a size-exclusion purification step using a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 prep grade column (GE Healthcare) for the NTD proteins and a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 prep grade column (GE Healthcare) for the full-length protein and other domains. The NTD of ClpC1 overexpressed with GST tag was purified using a GSTrap FF column (GE Healthcare), followed by on-column GST tag cleavage with Prescission protease and a size exclusion purification step using a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 prep grade column (GE Healthcare). CymA and CymA1 were prepared as described previously (4.Schmitt E.K. Riwanto M. Sambandamurthy V. Roggo S. Miault C. Zwingelstein C. Krastel P. Noble C. Beer D. Rao S.P. Au M. Niyomrattanakit P.

Ed Engl. 2011; 50: 5889-5891Google Scholar). The purified MTB ClpC1 NTD protein and the mutants were set up for crystallization at a concentration of ∼15 mg/ml. For co-crystallization, CymA was added to the protein at a 1.1:1 molar ratio and incubated in ice for about 30 min before crystallization. Crystals of ClpC1 NTD appeared in about 2–3 days at 18 °C in a condition having 0.2 m sodium acetate and 30% polyethylene glycol 3350. Crystals of ClpC1 NTD and mutants F2Y and F80Y in complex with CymA appeared in about 2–3 days in conditions having 0.2 m ammonium acetate and 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.025 m magnesium formate and 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, and 0.15 m ammonium acetate and 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, respectively. The crystals were transferred to their respective crystallization reservoir solutions, supplemented with 20% glycerol, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Single crystal x-ray diffraction data were collected at the Swiss Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland) using the PILATUS detector on beam line X10SA. X-ray data were processed using iMOSFLM (21.Battye T.G. Kontogiannis L. Johnson O. Powell H.R. Leslie A.G. iMOSFLM.

Typically, 19 injections of 2 μl of 150–200 μm CymA1 solution in the same buffer were injected into the sample cell at 2.5-min intervals. The data were fitted to a single-site binding equation with the aid of Origin software (OriginLab, MA). The DNA sequence encoding ClpC1 from M. tuberculosis was cloned into the multicopy mycobacterial expression vector, pMV262, between BamHI and HindIII restriction sites. The mutants F2A, F2Y, F80A, F80Y, E89A, and E89Q were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, CA), on the pMV262-ClpC1 construct and the mutations were confirmed by sequencing. To check and compare CymA1 susceptibility of overexpression cells, empty pMV262 plasmid and the various constructs of pMV262-ClpC1 were electroporated into M. bovis BCG (Pasteur) and M. smegmatis MC2 155 and selected on Middlebrook 7H11 agar plates containing 0.5% glycerol and 10% (v/v) OADC supplement and with 30 μg/ml of kanamycin. Colonies were picked and grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth containing 0.05% Tween 80, 10% (v/v) albumin, dextrose, and sodium chloride, 0.2% glycerol, and 30 μg/ml of kanamycin. The cultures of all mutants and wild type ClpC1 overexpression cells in logarithmic phase were diluted to an optical density at 600 nm (A600) of 0.02 with Middlebrook 7H9 broth and taken in 96-well test plates. CymA1 and streptomycin stocks in 90% dimethyl sulfoxide and deionized water, respectively, were introduced at varying concentrations, separately for each cell type. Compound susceptibility experiments for each cell type were done in duplicate and with two different clones of the same type. The cells with and without compounds were allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 2 days for M. smegmatis MC2 155 and 5 days for M. bovis BCG (Pasteur). Compound-treated and -untreated cells from various strains were plated on to Middlebrook 7H11 agar plates and incubated at 37 °C in an incubator for 3 weeks before counting the colony forming units. Statistical analyses were performed using a Student's t test. To identify the domain(s) that interact with CymA, we separately cloned and expressed the individual domains of ClpC1. The full-length ClpC1 protein (residues 1–848), NTD (residues 1–145), D1 domain (residues 165–493), N-D1 domain (residues 1–493), D2 domain (residues 498–848), and D1-D2 domain (residues 165–848) were expressed with a C-terminal His tag, purified to homogeneity, and subjected to binding experiments using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) with CymA1 (amino-alcohol derivative of CymA (4.Schmitt E.K. Riwanto M. Sambandamurthy V. Roggo S. Miault C. Zwingelstein C. Krastel P. Noble C. Beer D. Rao S.P. Au M. Niyomrattanakit P. Lim V. Zheng J. Jeffery D. Pethe K. Camacho L.R. The natural product cyclomarin kills Mycobacterium tuberculosis by targeting the ClpC1 subunit of the caseinolytic protease.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed Engl. 2011; 50: 5889-5891Google Scholar)). CymA1 was chosen over CymA due its better solubility. The structure of CymA and CymA1, as well as results from ITC experiments can be seen in Fig. 1 and Table 1. The data clearly show that the N-terminal domain of ClpC1 specifically binds to CymA1. The D1 and D2 domains alone do not bind. The data indicate that the NTD binds to CymA1 with a similar affinity to full-length ClpC1 or the N-D1 domains, suggesting that the D1 and D2 domains do not contribute to binding. Because the ClpC1 NTD binds to CymA with high affinity, we attempted to crystallize the ClpC1 NTD with and without CymA. We obtained crystals for both the apo- and holo- forms by standard vapor-diffusion methods, making use of commercially available sparse-matrix screens. The crystallization conditions were further optimized to improve the diffraction quality of the crystals. The crystals used for structure determination belonged to the orthorhombic space group P212121. The data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2. The crystal structure of M. tuberculosis ClpC1 NTD was solved by molecular replacement, using the B. subtilis NTD structure (PDB code 2Y1Q) as the search model. The high resolution (1.37 Å) structure shows that the ClpC1 N-terminal domain (residues 1–145; Fig. 2A) consists of eight α-helices. The fold of the NTD contains two repeats of a 4-helix motif that share 58% identity. A 14-amino acid loop between α4 and α5 connects the two motifs. Residues 4–68 and 79–143 superpose with a r.m.s. deviation of about 2.04 Å (Fig. 2B). The overall structure of the M. tuberculosis ClpC1 NTD is similar to the ClpC NTD from B. subtilis, with a r.m.s. deviation of 0.48 Å (Fig. 2C). All residues of the NTD, as well as the two residues of the C-terminal His tag could be seen in the electron density, allowing a complete model to be built. ClpC1 NTD was co-crystallized with CymA and the crystals diffracted to about 1.18-Å resolution. The structure was solved using the ClpC1 NTD as a search model for molecular replacement. The overall structure of the N-terminal domain does not change due to CymA binding. However, modest changes are seen in the region where CymA binds (Fig. 3A) suggesting CymA binding alters the conformation of the ClpC1 NTD. The construct used to solve the structure of the free ClpC1 NTD contained an N-terminal tag, some of which could be seen in the electron density, whereas the final refined structures of the complex were determined using constructs with a C-terminal His tag. No difference in affinity was seen for these different constructs, indicating that the N-terminal tag does not interfere with binding (data not shown). CymA occupies a site between the short N-terminal loop before α1 and the long loop between helices α4 and α5 (Fig. 3, B and C). Details of the interactions between CymA and ClpC1 are shown in Fig. 3D. Residues Phe2 and Phe80 of the protein are in close proximity to CymA, and the backbone amides make direct polar contacts with the carbonyls of the N-reverse prenylated tryptophan and l-alanine, respectively, of the cyclic heptapeptide. Glu89 of ClpC1 NTD α5 appears to exist in alternate side chain conformations, with only one of them forming a direct polar interaction with the compound via its N-methylhydroxyleucine residue. The side chain of Lys85 also makes two direct polar contacts with CymA. In addition to these direct contacts, several water-mediated interactions are also seen. These include the side chain of Glu3 forming a single water-mediated interaction, and the side chain of Gln17 forming two. The carbonyl of Phe80 also makes a water-mediated contact. The side chains of Phe2 and Phe80 form a hydrophobic platform, which the compound enfolds. M. tuberculosis ClpC1 residues Phe2, Phe80, and Glu89 are directly involved in CymA binding in the co-crystal structure and were mutated to find out how important these residues are for CymA binding. Lys85 was not selected for mutagenesis because this appeared to be less important for CymA binding (see “Discussion”). We generated alanine mutants within the ClpC1 NTD (F2A, F80A, and E89A) as well as more conservative mutations (F2Y, F80Y, and E89Q). All six mutants were expressed and purified to homogeneity. ITC experiments were carried out for the mutants and the results can be seen in Table 3. F2A resulted in ∼300 times weaker binding to CymA1 and even the very minor change, F2Y, resulted in ∼60 times weaker bindi"
https://openalex.org/W2095500328,"Soda lakes are intriguing ecosystems harboring extremely productive microbial communities in spite of their extreme environmental conditions. This makes them valuable model systems for studying the connection between community structure and abiotic parameters such as pH and salinity. For the first time, we apply high-throughput sequencing to accurately estimate phylogenetic richness and composition in five soda lakes, located in the Ethiopian Rift Valley. The lakes were selected for their contrasting pH, salinities and stratification and several depths or spatial positions were covered in each lake. DNA was extracted and analyzed from all lakes at various depths and RNA extracted from two of the lakes, analyzed using both amplicon- and shotgun sequencing. We reveal a surprisingly high biodiversity in all of the studied lakes, similar to that of freshwater lakes. Interestingly, diversity appeared uncorrelated or positively correlated to pH and salinity, with the most ""extreme"" lakes showing the highest richness. Together, pH, dissolved oxygen, sodium- and potassium concentration explained approximately 30% of the compositional variation between samples. A diversity of prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa could be identified, including several putatively involved in carbon-, sulfur- or nitrogen cycling. Key processes like methane oxidation, ammonia oxidation and 'nitrifier denitrification' were also confirmed by mRNA transcript analyses."
https://openalex.org/W1972580547,"The effect of nutrition on the timing of human tooth formation is poorly understood. Delays and advancements in dental maturation have all been reported as well as no effect. We investigated the effect of severe malnutrition on the timing of human tooth formation in a large representative sample of North Sudanese children. The sample (1102 males, 1013 females) consisted of stratified randomly selected healthy individuals in Khartoum, Sudan, aged 2-22 years using a cross-sectional design following the STROBE statement. Nutritional status was defined using WHO criteria of height and weight. Body mass index Z-scores and height for age Z-scores of ≤−2 (cut-off) were used to identify the malnourished group (N = 474) while the normal was defined by Z-scores of ≥0 (N = 799). Clinical and radiographic examination of individuals, with known ages of birth was performed including height and weight measurements. Mandibular left permanent teeth were assessed using eight crown and seven root established tooth formation stages. Mean age at entry and mean age within tooth stages were calculated for each available tooth stage in each group and compared using a t-test. Results show the mean age at entry and mean age within tooth stages were not significantly different between groups affected by severe malnutrition and normal children (p>0.05). This remarkable finding was evident across the span of dental development. We demonstrate that there is little measurable effect of sustained malnutrition on the average timing of tooth formation. This noteworthy finding supports the notion that teeth have substantial biological stability and are insulated from extreme nutritional conditions compared to other maturing body systems."
https://openalex.org/W2093264600,"The migration of maize from tropical to temperate climates was accompanied by a dramatic evolution in flowering time. To gain insight into the genetic architecture of this adaptive trait, we conducted a 50K SNP-based genome-wide association and diversity investigation on a panel of tropical and temperate American and European representatives. Eighteen genomic regions were associated with flowering time. The number of early alleles cumulated along these regions was highly correlated with flowering time. Polymorphism in the vicinity of the ZCN8 gene, which is the closest maize homologue to Arabidopsis major flowering time (FT) gene, had the strongest effect. This polymorphism is in the vicinity of the causal factor of Vgt2 QTL. Diversity was lower, whereas differentiation and LD were higher for associated loci compared to the rest of the genome, which is consistent with selection acting on flowering time during maize migration. Selection tests also revealed supplementary loci that were highly differentiated among groups and not associated with flowering time in our panel, whereas they were in other linkage-based studies. This suggests that allele fixation led to a lack of statistical power when structure and relatedness were taken into account in a linear mixed model. Complementary designs and analysis methods are necessary to unravel the architecture of complex traits. Based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimates corrected for population structure, we concluded that the number of SNPs genotyped should be at least doubled to capture all QTLs contributing to the genetic architecture of polygenic traits in this panel. These results show that maize flowering time is controlled by numerous QTLs of small additive effect and that strong polygenic selection occurred under cool climatic conditions. They should contribute to more efficient genomic predictions of flowering time and facilitate the dissemination of diverse maize genetic resources under a wide range of environments."
https://openalex.org/W2056944862,"The aim of this study was to determine whether adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) expressing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene can improve endothelial function, recover the impaired VEGF signaling pathway and enhance smooth muscle contents in a rat diabetic erectile dysfunction (DED) model. DED rats were induced via intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (40 mg/kg), and then screened by apomorphine (100 µg/kg). Five groups were used (n = 12/group)–Group 1 (G1): intracavernous injection of lentivirus-VEGF; G2: ADSCs injection; G3: VEGF-expressing ADSCs injection; G4: Phosphate buffered saline injection; G1–G4 were DED rats; G5: normal rats. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and intracavernosal pressure (ICP) were measured at days 7 and 28 after the injections. The components of the VEGF system, endothelial, smooth muscle, pericytes markers in cavernoursal tissue were assessed. On day 28 after injection, the group with intracavernosum injection of ADSCs expressing VEGF displayed more efficiently and significantly raised ICP and ICP/MAP (p<0.01) than those with ADSCs or lentivirus-VEGF injection. Western blot and immunofluorescent analysis demonstrated that improved erectile function by ADSCs-VEGF was associated with increased expression of endothelial markers (VEGF, VEGF R1, VEGF R2, eNOS, CD31 and vWF), smooth muscle markers (a-actin and smoothelin), and pericyte markers (CD146 and NG2). ADSCs expressing VEGF produced a therapeutic effect and restored erectile function in diabetic rats by enhancing VEGF-stimulated endothelial function and increasing the contents of smooth muscle and pericytes."
https://openalex.org/W2003337584,"Crop agronomic parameters (leaf area index (LAI), nitrogen (N) uptake, total chlorophyll (Chl) content ) are very important for the prediction of crop growth. The objective of this experiment was to investigate whether the wheat LAI, N uptake, and total Chl content could be accurately predicted using spectral indices collected at different stages of wheat growth. Firstly, the product of the optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index and wheat biomass dry weight (OSAVI×BDW) were used to estimate LAI, N uptake, and total Chl content; secondly, BDW was replaced by spectral indices to establish new spectral indices (OSAVI×OSAVI, OSAVI×SIPI, OSAVI×CIred edge, OSAVI×CIgreen mode and OSAVI×EVI2); finally, we used the new spectral indices for estimating LAI, N uptake, and total Chl content. The results showed that the new spectral indices could be used to accurately estimate LAI, N uptake, and total Chl content. The highest R2 and the lowest RMSEs were 0.711 and 0.78 (OSAVI×EVI2), 0.785 and 3.98 g/m2 (OSAVI×CIred edge) and 0.846 and 0.65 g/m2 (OSAVI×CIred edge) for LAI, nitrogen uptake and total Chl content, respectively. The new spectral indices performed better than the OSAVI alone, and the problems of a lack of sensitivity at earlier growth stages and saturation at later growth stages, which are typically associated with the OSAVI, were improved. The overall results indicated that this new spectral indices provided the best approximation for the estimation of agronomic indices for all growth stages of wheat."
https://openalex.org/W2054802012,"The proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β is a key mediator of inflammatory responses that contribute to and exacerbate brain injury. IL-1β is synthesized by microglia in the brain as an inactive precursor (pro-IL-1β). Cleavage of pro-IL-1β to a mature form is stimulated by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). These DAMPs are sensed by a pattern recognition receptor called NLRP3, which forms an inflammasome, resulting in the activation of caspase-1 and cleavage of pro-IL-1β. To date, regulation of the inflammasome in culture has been studied under normal culture conditions, and it is not known how DAMPs signal under disease relevant conditions such as acidosis. Given the presence of acidosis in pathological states, our objective was to test the hypothesis that acidic conditions modify DAMP-induced IL-1β release from cultured primary mouse glial cells. When LPS-primed glial cells were stimulated with DAMPs under acidic conditions (pH 6.2), the predominant IL-1β form secreted was the 20-kDa rather than the 17-kDa caspase-1-dependent species. Lactic acidosis, induced by the addition of 25 mm lactic acid, also induced the release of 20-kDa IL-1β.

Significance: Multiple pathways may contribute to the activation of IL-1 during disease. Non-communicable diseases (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke, and cancer) kill more people than all other causes combined and are thus recognized as a global healthcare priority (1Reardon S. A world of chronic disease.Science. 2011; 333: 558-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 2Angell S.Y. Danel I. DeCock K.M. Global health. Global indicators and targets for noncommunicable diseases.Science. 2012; 337: 1456-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Inflammation has been strongly implicated in non-communicable diseases (3Rock K.L. Latz E. Ontiveros F. Kono H. The sterile inflammatory response.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 28: 321-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) and, in this context (the absence of infection), is considered “sterile” and represents a major drug target (4Dinarello C.A. Anti-inflammatory agents: present and future.Cell. 2010; 140: 935-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). IL-1β is a primary mediator of sterile inflammatory responses, and given its established contribution to disease (5Dinarello C.A. Blocking interleukin-1β in acute and chronic autoinflammatory diseases.J. Int. Med. 2011; 269: 16-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), understanding the mechanisms of its processing and release could lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets. IL-1β is an established contributor to acute brain injury, such as caused by stroke (6Allan S.M. Tyrrell P.J. Rothwell N.J. Interleukin-1 and neuronal injury.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). In the brain, IL-1β is produced primarily by microglia in response to an inflammatory stimulus as an inactive precursor (pro-IL-1β). Pro-IL-1β requires proteolytic cleavage to an active mature form that signals at IL-1 receptor I on responsive cells (7Luheshi N.M. Rothwell N.J. Brough D. Dual functionality of interleukin-1 family cytokines: implications for anti-interleukin-1 therapy.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 157: 1318-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Activation of IL-1β is regulated by inflammasomes, which are multimolecular complexes defined by the presence of a cytosolic pattern recognition receptor. Of particular relevance to sterile inflammation is the pattern recognition receptor NLRP3 (NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 3) (8Strowig T. Henao-Mejia J. Elinav E. Flavell R. Inflammasomes in health and disease.Nature. 2012; 481: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar). After activation, NLRP3 interacts with the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and procaspase-1 to form an inflammasome, resulting in activation of caspase-1 and its processing of pro-IL-1β to a mature active form (9Schroder K. Tschopp J. The inflammasomes.Cell. 2010; 140: 821-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4115) Google Scholar). NLRP3 senses molecules released from dead and dying cells, so-called damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) 2The abbreviations used are: DAMPdamage-associated molecular patternAc-YVAD-CHOacetyl-YVAD-aldehydeMSUmonosodium urateCPPDcalcium pyrophosphate dihydrateKOknock-outLDHlactate dehydrogenaseANOVAanalysis of variance. (10Chen G.Y. Nuñez G. Sterile inflammation: sensing and reacting to damage.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 10: 826-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). Treatment of activated macrophages with necrotic cells also drives NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent IL-1β secretion (11Iyer S.S. Pulskens W.P. Sadler J.J. Butter L.M. Teske G.J. Ulland T.K.

Tschopp J. The inflammasomes.Cell. 2010; 140: 821-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4115) Google Scholar). To date, studies investigating regulation of the inflammasome in vitro have been conducted under physiological or “normal culture” conditions. However, during disease, there are profound changes in the intercellular milieu (such as a drop in pH), and how DAMPs signal under these particular conditions is not known. damage-associated molecular pattern acetyl-YVAD-aldehyde monosodium urate calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate knock-out lactate dehydrogenase analysis of variance. Lactic acidosis commonly occurs during disease conditions and results from an increase in anaerobic glycolysis due to tissue hypoxia. In the brain following a stroke, parenchymal pH can drop as low as 6.2 (12Nemoto E.M. Frinak S. Brain tissue pH after global brain ischemia and barbiturate loading in rats.Stroke. 1981; 12: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It was reported recently that P2X7 receptor-dependent release of IL-1β from cultured microglia is affected by acidosis (13Takenouchi T. Iwamaru Y. Sugama S. Tsukimoto M. Fujita M. Sekigawa A. Sekiyama K. Sato M. Kojima S. Conti B. Hashimoto M. Kitani H.

Neurochem. 2011; 117: 712-723PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation of microglia with the P2X7 receptor agonist ATP at pH 6.2 results in the secretion of a 20-kDa species of IL-1β as opposed to the more conventionally reported 17-kDa form. The 20-kDa cleavage product does not require caspase-1 but rather depends upon the protease cathepsin D (13Takenouchi T. Iwamaru Y. Sugama S. Tsukimoto M. Fujita M. Sekigawa A. Sekiyama K. Sato M.

Acidosis was also recently described as a danger signal that could activate the NLRP3 inflammasome (17Rajamäki K. Nordström T. Nurmi K. Åkerman K.E. Kovanen P.T. Öörni K. Eklund K.K. Extracellular acidosis is a novel danger signal alerting innate immunity via the NLRP3 inflammasome.J. Biol.

Thus, during disease, pro-IL-1β can be cleaved by a variety of proteases that may act to shape the inflammatory response. Here, we sought to determine whether acidic conditions modify DAMP-induced IL-1β release from cultured primary glial cells. We report that acidosis induced a shift from the 17-kDa to the 20-kDa IL-1β product in response to DAMP stimulation and that this was independent of the NLRP3 inflammasome. We also report that the addition of lactic acid directly to the culture induced the secretion of 20-kDa IL-1β, raising the possibility that lactic acidosis could drive IL-1-dependent inflammatory responses during disease. RPMI 1640 medium, DMEM, penicillin/streptomycin solution, LPS (Escherichia coli O26:B6), ATP, l-lactic acid, cathepsin D inhibitor pepstatin A, and cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074 methyl ester were purchased from Sigma. The caspase-1 inhibitor acetyl-YVAD-aldehyde (Ac-YVAD-CHO) and calpain inhibitor III were purchased from Calbiochem. Monosodium urate (MSU) and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) were purchased from InvivoGen. FBS was purchased from PAA Laboratories. HEPES-buffered salt solution comprised 145 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, and 0.01% BSA as described previously (13Takenouchi T. Iwamaru Y. Sugama S. Tsukimoto M. Fujita M. Sekigawa A. Sekiyama K. Sato M. Kojima S. Conti B. Hashimoto M. Kitani H. The activation of P2X7 receptor induces cathepsin D-dependent production of a 20-kDa form of IL-1β under acidic extracellular pH in LPS-primed microglial cells.J. Neurochem. 2011; 117: 712-723PubMed Google Scholar). The pH of the HEPES-buffered salt solution was adjusted using 1 m NaOH. Antibodies against human and mouse IL-1β and mouse IL-1α were purchased from R&D Systems. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were from DAKO. Initial studies used the human monocytic cell line THP-1, which provides a well characterized secretion model of IL-1β. THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well and treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (0.5 μm). After 3 h, the medium was removed, fresh medium was added, and cells were incubated overnight (37 °C, 5% CO2). Cells were then LPS-primed (1 μg/ml, 4 h) to induce pro-IL-1β and NLRP3 expression. The culture medium then replaced with HEPES-buffered salt solution for subsequent treatments. DAMP-dependent inflammatory responses in cultures of mixed glia reflect inflammatory responses produced by an ischemic brain (18Savage C.D. Lopez-Castejon G. Denes A. Brough D. NLRP3-inflammasome activating DAMPs stimulate an inflammatory response in glia in the absence of priming which contributes to brain inflammation after injury.Front. Immunol. 2012; 3: 288Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), so we considered these cultures to represent an appropriate system for examining the effects of pH on DAMP-induced inflammation in the brain. Primary mixed glia from 1–4-day-old mice (C57BL/6J or NLRP3 knock-out (KO)) were cultured as described previously (18Savage C.D. Lopez-Castejon G. Denes A. Brough D. NLRP3-inflammasome activating DAMPs stimulate an inflammatory response in glia in the absence of priming which contributes to brain inflammation after injury.Front. Immunol. 2012; 3: 288Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, meninges were removed, and cells were dissociated by trituration. Cells were seeded at one brain/60 cm2 and maintained in growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 until confluent (∼14 days in vitro). Cultures were then incubated with LPS (1 μg/ml, 18–24 h). The growth medium was replaced with serum-free medium or HEPES-buffered salt solution prior to treatment. All procedures were performed in accordance with the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Prior to treatment with DAMPs (ATP, MSU, and CPPD), the culture medium was replaced with HEPES-buffered salt solution with the pH adjusted to 7.4 or 6.2. Prior to lactic acid treatment, the culture medium was replaced with serum-free medium. Primed human THP-1 or mouse mixed glial cultures were treated with ATP (5.5 mm, 1 h), MSU (250 μg/ml, 1 h), CPPD (250 μg/ml, 1 h), or lactic acid (25 mm, 8 h). In subsequent studies, cells were pretreated with caspase-1 (Ac-YVAD-CHO, 100 μm), cathepsin B (CA-074 methyl ester; 50 μm), and cathepsin D (pepstatin A, 50 μm) inhibitors or their respective vehicles (1% Me2SO or MeOH) for 15 min prior to DAMP/lactic acid treatment. Supernatants were collected and stored at −20 °C until required. Supernatants were collected and, if required, concentrated using 10-kDa cutoff filters (Millipore). Samples of this supernatant were resolved on 12% polyacrylamide gels for detection of IL-1β or IL-1α. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and specific proteins were detected by Western blotting with anti-human IL-1β, anti-mouse IL-1β, or anti-mouse IL-1α, followed by a secondary HRP-conjugated antibody, and subsequently detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Supernatants were analyzed for IL-1β and IL-1α using specific ELISA kits for human or mouse IL-1 from R&D Systems according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay was used as an indicator of cell death. LDH release from cells was detected using the CytoTox 96® non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism v5. For comparisons between two groups, Student's t test was used. For comparisons involving three or more experimental groups, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Bonferroni multiple-comparisons post hoc test was used. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. for the number of repeats indicated in the figure legends. p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. In LPS-primed THP-1 cells incubated at pH 6.2, mature IL-1β release was not observed in the absence of DAMP, in contrast to a previous report (17Rajamäki K. Nordström T. Nurmi K. Åkerman K.E. Kovanen P.T. Öörni K. Eklund K.K. Extracellular acidosis is a novel danger signal alerting innate immunity via the NLRP3 inflammasome.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 13410-13419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, at pH 6.2, both 20- and 17-kDa forms were present after treatment with the NLRP3 inflammasome-activating DAMPs CPPD and MSU (Fig. 1A). At pH 7.4, only the 17-kDa form was present in the culture supernatants after DAMP treatment (Fig. 1A). In these THP-1 cells, CPPD proved to be a powerful inducer of IL-1β release, with levels readily detected by ELISA (Fig. 1B). There was no difference in DAMP-induced toxicity between cells maintained at pH 7.4 and 6.2 (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the effect cannot be explained by toxicity of the pH change. Thus, these data indicate that at acidic pH (pH 6.2), DAMPs induce the release of 20-kDa IL-1β from THP-1 cells. We subsequently showed that neither the caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CHO (Fig. 2A) nor the cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074 methyl ester (Fig. 2B) blocked the production of 20-kDa IL-1β from LPS-primed THP-1 cells induced by CPPD at pH 6.2, thereby suggesting alternative processing of IL-1β independent of caspase-1 in THP-1 cells at acidic pH. Consistent with the previously reported effect of acidic conditions on P2X7 receptor-dependent IL-1β release (13Takenouchi T. Iwamaru Y. Sugama S. Tsukimoto M. Fujita M. Sekigawa A. Sekiyama K. Sato M. Kojima S. Conti B. Hashimoto M. Kitani H. The activation of P2X7 receptor induces cathepsin D-dependent production of a 20-kDa form of IL-1β under acidic extracellular pH in LPS-primed microglial cells.J. Neurochem. 2011; 117: 712-723PubMed Google Scholar), the cathepsin D inhibitor pepstatin A inhibited CPPD-induced release of 20-kDa IL-1β from LPS-primed THP-1 cells, whereas the release of 17-kDa IL-1β was unaffected (Fig. 2C). Overall, these data suggest that in THP-1 cells at pH 6.2, CPPD induces the release of a cathepsin D-dependent but not caspase-1-dependent IL-1β that is 20 kDa in size. We next determined whether the alternative caspase-1-independent processing of IL-1β in response to DAMPs at acidic pH occurs in primary cultures of glia. Incubation of LPS-primed mouse mixed glia at pH 7.4 with the NLRP3 inflammasome-activating DAMPs ATP, MSU, and CPPD induced the secretion of 17-kDa IL-1β as expected (Fig. 3A). However, when the cultures were incubated under acidic conditions at pH 6.2, these DAMPs also induced the secretion of 20-kDa IL-1β (Fig. 3B), consistent with a previous report on the effects of ATP (13Takenouchi T. Iwamaru Y. Sugama S. Tsukimoto M. Fujita M. Sekigawa A. Sekiyama K. Sato M. Kojima S. Conti B. Hashimoto M. Kitani H. The activation of P2X7 receptor induces cathepsin D-dependent production of a 20-kDa form of IL-1β under acidic extracellular pH in LPS-primed microglial cells.J. Neurochem. 2011; 117: 712-723PubMed Google Scholar) and our data presented above in the THP-1 cells (Fig. 1). There were no obvious differences in DAMP-induced toxicity between the experiments at different pH values (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the effect cannot simply be explained by toxicity of the pH change. To investigate 20-kDa IL-1β released from mixed glia is processed in the same way as that released from THP-1 cells, we pretreated cells with the caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CHO. CPPD treatment of LPS-primed mixed glia at normal pH (7.4) resulted in the release of mature 17-kDa IL-1β that was completely inhibited by Ac-YVAD-CHO pretreatment (Fig. 4A). At pH 6.2, Ac-YVAD-CHO still inhibited the appearance of 17-kDa IL-1β in response to CPPD but had no effect on 20-kDa IL-1β (Fig. 4B). Conversely, pepstatin A had no effect on CPPD-induced IL-1β (17 kDa) secretion at pH 7.4 (Fig. 4C), but at pH 6.2, pepstatin A inhibited the release of 20-kDa IL-1β (Fig. 4D). This confirmed that production of 20-kDa IL-1β was independent of caspase-1 and suggested that it required cathepsin D. To confirm that the effects of the NLRP3-activating DAMP CPPD at acidic pH were independent of the NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1, we compared the effects of CPPD on IL-1β release in cultures of mixed glia isolated from WT and NLRP3 KO mice. At pH 6.2, CPPD induced the secretion of 20-kDa IL-1β from both WT and NLRP3 KO mixed glia (Fig. 5), confirming that NLRP3 inflammasome-activating DAMPs induced the secretion of IL-1β from LPS-primed cells independently of the NLRP3 inflammasome under acidic conditions. During cerebral ischemia, there is a marked elevation in lactic acid that contributes to the drop in tissue pH (12Nemoto E.M. Frinak S. Brain tissue pH after global brain ischemia and barbiturate loading in rats.Stroke. 1981; 12: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Sun P.Z. Cheung J.S. Wang E. Lo E.H. Association between pH-weighted endogenous amide proton chemical exchange saturation transfer MRI and tissue lactic acidosis during acute ischemic stroke.J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2011; 31: 1743-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that lactic acid could stimulate the release of IL-1β in an ischemic brain. Treatment of LPS-primed mixed glia with lactic acid induced the release of 20-kDa IL-1β and a minor amount of 17-kDa IL-1β (Fig. 6A). This effect required LPS priming because lactic acid failed to induce expression or release of IL-1β in its absence (Fig. 6, B and C). Again, there was no obvious change in toxicity with lactic acid treatment (Fig. 6D), suggesting that the IL-1β release observed with lactic acid cannot simply be explained by toxicity. Lactic acid-induced release of 17-kDa IL-1β was inhibited by Ac-YVAD-CHO, whereas release of 20-kDa IL-1β was unaffected (Fig. 7A). Lactic acid also induced the release of 20-kDa IL-1β from NLRP3 KO mixed glia (Fig. 7B), confirming the NLRP3 inflammasome- and caspase-1-independent release. Consistent with data presented above, lactic acid-induced 20-kDa IL-1β was inhibited by the cathepsin D inhibitor pepstatin A (Fig. 7C). The effects of lactic acid on the IL-1 system were not limited to IL-1β because treatment of LPS-primed mixed glia with lactic acid also induced the release of processed IL-1α (Fig. 8A), which we have reported previously to be a key early mediator of inflammation following acute brain injury (20Luheshi N.M. Kovács K.J. Lopez-Castejon G. Brough D. Denes A. Interleukin-1α expression precedes IL-1β after ischemic brain injury and is localised to areas of focal neuronal loss and penumbral tissues.J. Neuroinflammation. 2011; 8: 186Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 21Greenhalgh A.D. Brough D. Robinson E.M. Girard S. Rothwell N.J. Allan S.M. Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist is beneficial after subarachnoid haemorrhage in rat by blocking haem-driven inflammatory pathology.Dis. Model. Mech. 2012; 5: 823-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Lactic acid-induced IL-1α release was also independent of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Fig. 8B) but required the calcium-dependent protease calpain because calpain inhibitor III inhibited lactic acid-induced IL-1α processing and release (Fig. 8C). Thus, in line with the NLRP3-independent actions of lactic acid on IL-1β release described above, these data suggest that lactic acid also induces the release of NLRP3-independent but calpain-dependent IL-1α release from glia. Most studies on IL-1β release in in vitro systems are conducted under physiological conditions and in peripheral immune cells such as macrophages. The objective of this study was to investigate IL-1β secretion under disease relevant conditions, with particular reference to ischemic stroke, for which lactic acidosis is relevant (19Sun P.Z. Cheung J.S. Wang E. Lo E.H. Association between pH-weighted endogenous amide proton chemical exchange saturation transfer MRI and tissue lactic acidosis during acute ischemic stroke.J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2011; 31: 1743-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Under acidic conditions, “classical” NLRP3 inflammasome-activating DAMPs such as ATP (22Mariathasan S. Weiss D.S. Newton K. McBride J. O'Rourke K. Roose-Girma M. Lee W.P. Weinrauch Y. Monack D.M. Dixit V.M. Cryopyrin activates the inflammasome in response to toxins and ATP.Nature. 2006; 440: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (2333) Google Scholar) and MSU and CPPD crystals (23Martinon F. Pétrilli V. Mayor A. Tardivel A. Tschopp J. Gout-associated uric acid crystals activate the NALP3 inflammasome.Nature. 2006; 440: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (3760) Google Scholar) induced the release of a processed IL-1β that was completely independent of the NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1, and this occurred in both peripheral macrophage-like cells and also glial cells from the central nervous system. Although we and others have reported that MSU and CPPD stimulate IL-1-independent inflammatory responses (18Savage C.D. Lopez-Castejon G. Denes A. Brough D.

Immunol. 2002; 168: 5310-5317Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), when used to stimulate IL-1 production, they are associated with the NLRP3 inflammasome- and caspase-1-dependent processing (23Martinon F. Pétrilli V. Mayor A. Tardivel A. Tschopp J. Gout-associated uric acid crystals activate the NALP3 inflammasome.Nature. 2006; 440: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (3760) Google Scholar). We also showed that lactic acid induced the release of processed IL-1β that was again independent of the NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1. Caspase-1-independent processing of IL-1β has been reported previously and may impact certain diseases even more significantly than caspase-1-processed IL-1β (14Fantuzzi G. Ku G. Harding M.W. Livingston D.J. Sipe J.D. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Dinarello C.A. Response to local inflammation of IL-1β-converting enzyme- deficient mice.J.

In our experiments, priming to induce the synthesis of pro-IL-1β was required prior to lactic acid (or DAMP)-induced IL-1β release. The TLR4 agonist LPS is a tool for priming cells in culture, but little is known about priming in vivo in an injured brain. Brain injury often results in disruption of the blood-brain barrier (6Allan S.M. Tyrrell P.J. Rothwell N.J. Interleukin-1 and neuronal injury.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar), which would allow circulating peripheral molecules to enter the brain and act on glia. The acute phase protein serum amyloid A is elevated in plasma during inflammation and has been shown to prime glial cells to release IL-1 following subsequent DAMP stimulation in vitro in a way similar to LPS (18Savage C.D. Lopez-Castejon G. Denes A. Brough D. NLRP3-inflammasome activating DAMPs stimulate an inflammatory response in glia in the absence of priming which contributes to brain inflammation after injury.Front. Immunol. 2012; 3: 288Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The contribution of IL-1 to ischemic brain injury is well established (6Allan S.M. Tyrrell P.J. Rothwell N.J. Interleukin-1 and neuronal injury.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar), with the utility of the IL-1 receptor antagonist as a therapeutic under clinical investigation (26Emsley H.C. Smith C.J. Georgiou R.F. Vail A. Hopkins S.J. Rothwell N.J. Tyrrell P.J. A randomised phase II study of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in acute stroke patients.J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 2005; 76: 1366-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Brain acidosis after ischemia contributes to neuronal injury, and the damaging effects are mediated, at least in part, by acid-sensing ion channels (27Xiong Z.G. Zhu X.M. Chu X.P. Minami M. Hey J. Wei W.L. MacDonald J.F. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Simon R.P.

Wang D.G. Deng X.H. Zhang G.Y. Xu L. Xu T.L. Coupling between NMDA receptor and acid-sensing ion channel contributes to ischemic neuronal death.Neuron. 2005; 48: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Our data provide the rationale that acidosis and neuronal injury could also be linked via the IL-1 system. Levels of lactic acid increase in an ischemic brain due to a lack of oxygen and the up-regulation of anaerobic glycolysis. Stimulation of LPS-primed cultures of glial cells with lactic acid or with NLRP3 inflammasome-activating DAMPs under acidic conditions induced cathepsin D-dependent release of 20-kDa IL-1β, consistent with a previous report showing ATP-induced release of 20-kDa IL-1β from microglia under acidic conditions (13Takenouchi T. Iwamaru Y. Sugama S. Tsukimoto M. Fujita M. Sekigawa A. Sekiyama K. Sato M. Kojima S. Conti B. Hashimoto M. Kitani H. The activation of P2X7 receptor induces cathepsin D-dependent production of a 20-kDa form of IL-1β under acidic extracellular pH in LPS-primed microglial cells.J. Neurochem. 2011; 117: 712-723PubMed Google Scholar). This cathepsin D cleavage of IL-1β adds to a growing number of proteases now known to cleave pro-IL-1β. These proteases cleave IL-1β at different sites to produce different size fragments corresponding to differing activities (29Hazuda D.J. Strickler J. Simon P. Young P.R. Structure-function mapping of interleukin 1 precursors. Cleavage leads to a conformational change in the mature protein.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7081-7086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The putative cathepsin D-dependent product at 20 kDa is suggested to be ∼5-fold less active at IL-1 receptor I than the caspase-1-generated 17-kDa product (29Hazuda D.J. Strickler J. Simon P. Young P.R. Structure-function mapping of interleukin 1 precursors. Cleavage leads to a conformational change in the mature protein.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7081-7086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, if generated in vivo, it could act as an agonist or maybe a partial agonist of IL-1 receptor I and contribute to inflammatory responses during ischemia; therefore, further experiments to understand the exact nature of its role in vivo are required to help direct any future targeting of this pathway. Acidosis was also recently described as an inducer of the NLRP3 inflammasome (17Rajamäki K. Nordström T. Nurmi K. Åkerman K.E. Kovanen P.T. Öörni K. Eklund K.K. Extracellular acidosis is a novel danger signal alerting innate immunity via the NLRP3 inflammasome.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 13410-13419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Although we did observe 17-kDa IL-1β following lactic acid treatment (e.g. Fig. 7A), it was the minor species compared with the 20-kDa form. Together, these data strongly suggest that acidosis is an important disease relevant regulator of IL-1β-processing pathways. Until recently, the precursor of IL-1α (pro-IL-1α) was thought to be as biologically active as the mature 17-kDa form at IL-1 receptor I. However, recent research has shown that processed IL-1α is significantly more biologically active than the pro-form (30Afonina I.S. Tynan G.A. Logue S.E. Cullen S.P. Bots M. Lüthi A.U. Reeves E.P. McElvaney N.G. Medema J.P. Lavelle E.C. Martin S.J.

In addition to its effects on IL-1β, lactic acid also induced the release of processed IL-1α, which was 17 kDa and was inhibited by a calpain inhibitor, consistent with the involvement of a calpain protease in its processing (7Luheshi N.M. Rothwell N.J. Brough D. Dual functionality of interleukin-1 family cytokines: implications for anti-interleukin-1 therapy.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 157: 1318-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). DAMPs are known to induce the secretion of processed IL-1α (32Gross O. Yazdi A.S. Thomas C.J. Masin M. Heinz L.X. Guarda G. Quadroni M. Drexler S.K. Tschopp J. Inflammasome activators induce interleukin-1α secretion via distinct pathways with differential requirement for the protease function of caspase-1.Immunity. 2012; 36: 388-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), and DAMP-induced processing and secretion of IL-1α can be dependent, partially dependent, or independent of the NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1, depending upon the DAMP (32Gross O. Yazdi A.S. Thomas C.J. Masin M. Heinz L.X. Guarda G. Quadroni M. Drexler S.K. Tschopp J. Inflammasome activators induce interleukin-1α secretion via distinct pathways with differential requirement for the protease function of caspase-1.Immunity. 2012; 36: 388-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that lactic acid-induced IL-1α secretion occurs independently of the inflammasome. In addition to the effects of IL-1β in acute brain injury, IL-1α is also known to play an important role in brain injury (20Luheshi N.M. Kovács K.J. Lopez-Castejon G. Brough D. Denes A. Interleukin-1α expression precedes IL-1β after ischemic brain injury and is localised to areas of focal neuronal loss and penumbral tissues.J.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5528-5534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-1α is up-regulated before IL-1β and as early as 4 h post-ischemic brain injury in areas of subsequent neuronal loss, suggesting that it may be the key driver of the damaging early inflammatory response (20Luheshi N.M. Kovács K.J. Lopez-Castejon G. Brough D. Denes A. Interleukin-1α expression precedes IL-1β after ischemic brain injury and is localised to areas of focal neuronal loss and penumbral tissues.J. Neuroinflammation. 2011; 8: 186Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus, the lactic acid-induced IL-1α release we have described may contribute to damage post-ischemic injury. In summary, these data provide new insights into the mechanisms of IL-1 production during disease relevant conditions. We have shown that under acidic conditions, both proinflammatory forms of the IL-1 family (IL-1β and IL-1α) are regulated independently of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Thus, consideration of this observation should be made when investigating inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome to target IL-1 in disease, particularly where changes in the local environment may dictate the mechanism of IL-1β processing. We are grateful to Dr. Vishva Dixit (Genentech) for providing the NLRP3 KO mice and to Prof. Nancy Rothwell for critically evaluating the manuscript."

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, homeostatic and adaptive responses to zinc deficiency are regulated by the Zap1 transcription factor.

Consistent with its regulation, Tsa1 is critical for growth under low zinc conditions. We previously showed that Tsa1's peroxidase function decreases the oxidative stress that occurs in zinc deficiency. In this report, we show that Tsa1 chaperone, and not peroxidase, activity is the more critical function in zinc-deficient cells.

The enzyme from the distantly related heterotroph, Alcaligenes faecalis, which is thought to oxidise arsenite for detoxification, consists of a large α subunit (AioA) with bis-molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide at its active site and a 3Fe-4S cluster, and a small β subunit (AioB) which contains a Rieske 2Fe-2S cluster. The successful heterologous expression of the NT-26 Aio in Escherichia coli has resulted in the solution of its crystal structure. The NT-26 Aio, a heterotetramer, shares high overall similarity to the heterodimeric arsenite oxidase from A. faecalis but there are striking differences in the structure surrounding the Rieske 2Fe-2S cluster which we demonstrate explains the difference in the observed redox potentials (+225 mV vs. +130/160 mV, respectively). A combination of site-directed mutagenesis and electron paramagnetic resonance was used to explore the differences observed in the structure and redox properties of the Rieske cluster. In the NT-26 AioB the substitution of a serine (S126 in NT-26) for a threonine as in the A. faecalis AioB explains a −20 mV decrease in redox potential. The disulphide bridge in the A. faecalis AioB which is conserved in other betaproteobacterial AioB subunits and the Rieske subunit of the cytochrome bc1 complex is absent in the NT-26 AioB subunit. The introduction of a disulphide bridge had no effect on Aio activity or protein stability but resulted in a decrease in the redox potential of the cluster. These results are in conflict with previous data on the betaproteobacterial AioB subunit and the Rieske of the bc1 complex where removal of the disulphide bridge had no effect on the redox potential of the former but a decrease in cluster stability was observed in the latter."
https://openalex.org/W2139569129,"In South Africa, the prevalence of oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) may be as high as 64%, and cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death among women. The development of efficacious prophylactic vaccines has provided an opportunity for primary prevention. Given the importance of psycho-social forces in vaccine uptake, we sought to elucidate factors influencing HPV vaccination among a sample of low-income South African adolescents receiving the vaccine for the first time in Soweto.The HPV vaccine was introduced to adolescents in low-income townships throughout South Africa as part of a nationwide trial to understand adolescent involvement in future vaccine research targeting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We performed in-depth semi-structured interviews with purposively-sampled adolescents and their care providers to understand what forces shaped HPV vaccine uptake. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, translated, and examined using thematic analysis.Of 224 adolescents recruited, 201 initiated the vaccine; 192 (95.5%) received a second immunization; and 164 (81.6%) completed three doses. In our qualitative study of 39 adolescent-caregiver dyads, we found that factors driving vaccine uptake reflected a socio-cultural backdrop of high HIV endemnicity, sexual violence, poverty, and an abundance of female-headed households. Adolescents exercised a high level of autonomy and often initiated decision-making. Healthcare providers and peers provided support and guidance that was absent at home. The impact of the HIV epidemic on decision-making was substantial, leading participants to mistakenly conflate HPV and HIV.In a setting of perceived rampant sexual violence and epidemic levels of HIV, adolescents and caregivers sought to decrease harm by seeking a vaccine targeting a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Despite careful consenting, there was confusion regarding the vaccine's target. Future interventions promoting STI vaccines will need to provide substantial information for participants, particularly adolescents who may exercise a significant level of autonomy in decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W2138144879,"Understanding the drivers of large-scale vegetation change is critical to managing landscapes and key to predicting how projected climate and land use changes will affect regional vegetation patterns. This study aimed to improve our understanding of the role, magnitude and spatial distribution of the key environmental factors driving vegetation change in southern African savanna, and how they vary across physiographic gradients.We applied Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA), a multivariate times series dimension reduction technique to ten years of monthly remote sensing data (MODIS-derived normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) and a suite of environmental covariates: precipitation, mean and maximum temperature, soil moisture, relative humidity, fire and potential evapotranspiration. Monthly NDVI was described by cyclic seasonal variation with distinct spatiotemporal patterns in different physiographic regions. Results support existing work emphasizing the importance of precipitation, soil moisture and fire on NDVI, but also reveal overlooked effects of temperature and evapotranspiration, particularly in regions with higher mean annual precipitation. Critically, spatial distributions of the weights of environmental covariates point to a transition in the importance of precipitation and soil moisture (strongest in grass-dominated regions with precipitation<750 mm) to fire, potential evapotranspiration, and temperature (strongest in tree-dominated regions with precipitation>950 mm).We quantified the combined spatiotemporal effects of an available suite of environmental drivers on NDVI across a large and diverse savanna region. The analysis supports known drivers of savanna vegetation but also uncovers important roles of temperature and evapotranspiration. Results highlight the utility of applying the DFA approach to remote sensing products for regional analyses of landscape change in the context of global environmental change. With the dramatic increase in global change research, this methodology augurs well for further development and application of spatially explicit time series modeling to studies at the intersection of ecology and remote sensing."
https://openalex.org/W2025937261,"Whey protein (WP) and whey protein hydrolysate (WPH) have the recognized capacity to increase glycogen stores. The objective of this study was to verify if consuming WP and WPH could also increase the concentration of the glucose transporters GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 in the plasma membrane (PM) of the muscle cells of sedentary and exercised animals. Forty-eight Wistar rats were divided into 6 groups (n = 8 per group), were treated and fed with experimental diets for 9 days as follows: a) control casein (CAS); b) WP; c) WPH; d) CAS exercised; e) WP exercised; and f) WPH exercised. After the experimental period, the animals were sacrificed, muscle GLUT-1 and GLUT-4, p85, Akt and phosphorylated Akt were analyzed by western blotting, and the glycogen, blood amino acids, insulin levels and biochemical health indicators were analyzed using standard methods. Consumption of WPH significantly increased the concentrations of GLUT-4 in the PM and glycogen, whereas the GLUT-1 and insulin levels and the health indicators showed no alterations. The physical exercise associated with consumption of WPH had favorable effects on glucose transport into muscle. These results should encourage new studies dealing with the potential of both WP and WPH for the treatment or prevention of type II diabetes, a disease in which there is reduced translocation of GLUT-4 to the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2106382799,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that involves a range of inflammatory mediators. Although interleukin (IL)-9 has been related to inflammation, there are at present no data on its role in atherosclerosis. Here we have examined IL-9 and IL-9 receptor (IL-9R) systemically and locally in patients with coronary and carotid atherosclerosis.Plasma IL-9 was quantified by enzyme immunoassay and multiplex technology. IL-9 and IL-9R mRNA were quantified by real-time RT-PCR, and their localization within the lesion was assessed by immunohistochemistry.THE MAIN FINDINGS WERE: (i) Patients with carotid atherosclerosis had significantly raised IL-9 plasma levels compared with healthy controls (n = 28), with no differences between asymptomatic (n = 56) and symptomatic (n = 88) patients. (ii) On admission, patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (n = 42) had markedly raised IL-9 plasma levels which gradually declined during the first week post-MI. (iii) T cells and monocytes from patients with unstable angina (n = 17) had increased mRNA levels of IL-9 as compared with controls (n = 11). (iv) Carotid plaques (n = 68) showed increased mRNA levels of IL-9 and IL-9R compared to non-atherosclerotic vessels (n = 10). Co-localization to T cells (IL-9 and IL-9R) and macrophages (IL-9) were shown by immunohistochemistry. (v) IL-9 increased IL-17 release in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with unstable angina (n = 5) and healthy controls (n = 5) with a particularly enhancing effect in cells from the patient group.Our findings show increased IL-9 levels in different atherosclerotic disorders both systemically and within the lesion, suggesting a role for the IL-9/IL-9R axis in the atherosclerotic process, potentially involving IL-17 mediated mechanisms. However, the functional consequences of these findings should be further investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2056657762,"The preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) - amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) - is manifested by phenotypes classified into exclusively memory (single-domain) MCI (sMCI) and multiple-domain MCI (mMCI). We suggest that typical MCI-to-AD progression occurs through the sMCI-to-mMCI sequence as a result of the extension of initial pathological processes. To support this hypothesis, we assess myelin content with a Magnetization Transfer Ratio (MTR) in 21 sMCI and 21 mMCI patients and in 42 age-, sex-, and education-matched controls. A conjunction analysis revealed MTR reduction shared by sMCI and mMCI groups in the medial temporal lobe and posterior structures including white matter (WM: splenium, posterior corona radiata) and gray matter (GM: hippocampus; parahippocampal and lingual gyri). A disjunction analysis showed the spread of demyelination to prefrontal WM and insula GM in executive mMCI. Our findings suggest that demyelination starts in the structures affected by neurofibrillary pathology; its presence correlates with the clinical picture and indicates the method of MCI-to-AD progression. In vivo staging of preclinical AD can be developed in terms of WM/GM demyelination."
https://openalex.org/W2144907975,"Neutrophil migration in zebrafish larvae is increasingly used as a model to study the response of these leukocytes to different determinants of the cellular inflammatory response. However, it remains challenging to extract comprehensive information describing the behaviour of neutrophils from the multi-dimensional data sets acquired with widefield or confocal microscopes. Here, we describe PhagoSight, an open-source software package for the segmentation, tracking and visualisation of migrating phagocytes in three dimensions. The algorithms in PhagoSight extract a large number of measurements that summarise the behaviour of neutrophils, but that could potentially be applied to any moving fluorescent cells. To derive a useful panel of variables quantifying aspects of neutrophil migratory behaviour, and to demonstrate the utility of PhagoSight, we evaluated changes in the volume of migrating neutrophils. Cell volume increased as neutrophils migrated towards the wound region of injured zebrafish. PhagoSight is openly available as MATLAB® m-files under the GNU General Public License. Synthetic data sets and a comprehensive user manual are available from http://www.phagosight.org."
https://openalex.org/W2052949173,"Exposure of human skin to solar ultraviolet (UV) irradiation induces matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) activity, which degrades type I collagen fibrils. Type I collagen is the most abundant protein in skin and constitutes the majority of skin connective tissue (dermis). Degradation of collagen fibrils impairs the structure and function of skin that characterize skin aging. Decorin is the predominant proteoglycan in human dermis. In model systems, decorin binds to and protects type I collagen fibrils from proteolytic degradation by enzymes such as MMP-1. Little is known regarding alterations of decorin in response to UV irradiation. We found that solar-simulated UV irradiation of human skin in vivo stimulated substantial decorin degradation, with kinetics similar to infiltration of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells. Proteases that were released from isolated PMN cells degraded decorin in vitro. A highly selective inhibitor of neutrophil elastase blocked decorin breakdown by proteases released from PMN cells. Furthermore, purified neutrophil elastase cleaved decorin in vitro and generated fragments with similar molecular weights as those resulting from protease activity released from PMN cells, and as observed in UV-irradiated human skin. Cleavage of decorin by neutrophil elastase significantly augmented fragmentation of type I collagen fibrils by MMP-1. Taken together, these data indicate that PMN cell proteases, especially neutrophil elastase, degrade decorin, and this degradation renders collagen fibrils more susceptible to MMP-1 cleavage. These data identify decorin degradation and neutrophil elastase as potential therapeutic targets for mitigating sun exposure-induced collagen fibril degradation in human skin."
https://openalex.org/W2034728978,"Human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) genomes are chromosomally integrated in all cells of an individual. They are normally transcriptionally silenced and transmitted only vertically. Enhanced expression of HERV-K accompanied by the emergence of anti-HERV-K-directed immune responses has been observed in tumor patients and HIV-infected individuals. As HERV-K is usually not expressed and immunological tolerance development is unlikely, it is an appropriate target for the development of immunotherapies. We generated a recombinant vaccinia virus (MVA-HKenv) expressing the HERV-K envelope glycoprotein (ENV), based on the modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), and established an animal model to test its vaccination efficacy. Murine renal carcinoma cells (Renca) were genetically altered to express E. coli beta-galactosidase (RLZ cells) or the HERV-K ENV gene (RLZ-HKenv cells). Intravenous injection of RLZ-HKenv cells into syngenic BALB/c mice led to the formation of pulmonary metastases, which were detectable by X-gal staining. A single vaccination of tumor-bearing mice with MVA-HKenv drastically reduced the number of pulmonary RLZ-HKenv tumor nodules compared to vaccination with wild-type MVA. Prophylactic vaccination of mice with MVA-HKenv precluded the formation of RLZ-HKenv tumor nodules, whereas wild-type MVA-vaccinated animals succumbed to metastasis. Protection from tumor formation correlated with enhanced HERV-K ENV-specific killing activity of splenocytes. These data demonstrate for the first time that HERV-K ENV is a useful target for vaccine development and might offer new treatment opportunities for diverse types of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2056942646,"Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynaecological cancer and is often diagnosed in late stage, often as the result of the unavailability of sufficiently sensitive biomarkers for early detection, tumour progression and tumour-associated inflammation. Glycosylation is the most common posttranslational modification of proteins; it is altered in cancer and therefore is a potential source of biomarkers. We investigated the quantitative and qualitative effects of anti-inflammatory (acetylsalicylic acid) and pro-inflammatory (thioglycolate and chlorite-oxidized oxyamylose) drugs on glycosylation in mouse cancer serum. A significant increase in sialylation and branching of glycans in mice treated with an inflammation-inducing compound was observed. Moreover, the increases in sialylation correlated with increased tumour sizes. Increases in sialylation and branching were consistent with increased expression of sialyltransferases and the branching enzyme MGAT5. Because the sialyltransferases are highly conserved among species, the described changes in the ovarian cancer mouse model are relevant to humans and serum N-glycome analysis for monitoring disease treatment and progression might be a useful biomarker."
https://openalex.org/W2069013215,"SGF-2 binds to promoter elements governing posterior silk gland-specific expression of the fibroin gene in Bombyx mori. We purified SGF-2 and showed that SGF-2 contains at least four gene products: the silkworm orthologues of LIM homeodomain protein Awh, LIM domain-binding protein (Ldb), a sequence-specific single-stranded DNA-binding protein (Lcaf), and the silk protein P25/fibrohexamerin (fhx). Using co-expression of these factors in Sf9 cells, Awh, Ldb, and Lcaf proteins were co-purified as a ternary complex that bound to the enhancer sequence in vitro. Lcaf interacts with Ldb as well as Awh through the conserved regions to mediate transcriptional activation in yeast. Misexpression of Awh in transgenic silkworms induces ectopic expression of the fibroin gene in the middle silk glands, where Ldb and Lcaf are expressed. Taken together, this study demonstrates that SGF-2 is a multisubunit activator complex containing Awh. Moreover, our results suggest that the Ldb·Lcaf protein complex serves as a scaffold to facilitate communication between transcriptional control elements."
https://openalex.org/W1963703199,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma or pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed at a very late stage at which point treatment options are minimal. Current chemotherapeutic interventions prolong survival marginally, thereby emphasizing the acute need for better treatment options to effectively manage this disease. Studies from different laboratories have shown that the Alzheimer disease-associated amyloid precursor protein (APP) is overexpressed in various cancers but its significance is not known. Here we sought to determine the role of APP in pancreatic cancer cell survival and proliferation. Our results show that pancreatic cancer cells secrete high levels of sAPPα, the α-secretase cleaved ectodomain fragment of APP, as compared with normal non-cancerous cells. Treatment of cells with batimastat or GI254023X, inhibitors of the α-secretase ADAM10, prevented sAPPα generation and reduced cell survival. Additionally, inhibition of sAPPα significantly reduced anchorage independent growth of the cancer cells. The effect of batimastat on cell survival and colony formation was enhanced when sAPPα downregulation was combined with gemcitabine treatment. Moreover, treatment of batimastat-treated cells with recombinant sAPPα reversed the inhibitory effect of the drug thereby indicating that sAPPα can indeed induce proliferation of cancer cells. Down-regulation of APP and ADAM10 brought about similar results, as did batimastat treatment, thereby confirming that APP processing is important for growth and proliferation of these cells. These results suggest that inhibition of sAPPα generation might enhance the effectiveness of the existing chemotherapeutic regimen for a better outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2014311252,"Humans and other higher primates are unique among mammals in using complement receptor 1 (CR1, CD35) on red blood cells (RBC) to ligate complement-tagged inflammatory particles (immune complexes, apoptotic/necrotic debris, and microbes) in the circulation for quiet transport to the sinusoids of spleen and liver where resident macrophages remove the particles, but allow the RBC to return unharmed to the circulation. This process is called immune-adherence clearance. In this study we found using luminometric- and fluorescence-based methods that ligation of CR1 on human RBC promotes ATP release. Our data show that CR1-mediated ATP release does not depend on Ca(2+) or enzymes previously shown to mediate an increase in membrane deformability promoted by CR1 ligation. Furthermore, ATP release following CR1 ligation increases the mobility of the lipid fraction of RBC membranes, which in turn facilitates CR1 clustering, and thereby enhances the binding avidity of complement-opsonized particles to the RBC CR1. Finally, we have found that RBC-derived ATP has a stimulatory effect on phagocytosis of immune-adherent immune complexes."

To support the need for targeted local health care, we explored spatial patterns of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) drug use at local level and determined its association with local demographic, socio-economic and access to care variables. We assessed spatial variability in these associations. We estimated the five-year prevalence of T2DM drug use (2005–2009) in persons aged 45 years and older at four-digit postal code level using the University of Groningen pharmacy database IADB.nl. Statistics Netherlands supplied data on potential predictor variables. We assessed spatial clustering, correlations and estimated a multiple linear regression model and a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model. Prevalence of T2DM medicine use ranged from 2.0% to 25.4%. The regression model included the extent of population ageing, proportion of social welfare/benefits, proportion of low incomes and proportion of pensioners, all significant positive predictors of local T2DM drug use. The GWR model demonstrated considerable spatial variability in the association between T2DM drug use and above predictors and was more accurate. The findings demonstrate the added value of spatial analysis in predicting health care use at local level."

Expression of the PTPN2 gene product, T cell protein-tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP), in intestinal epithelial cells has been shown to play an important role in the protection of epithelial barrier function during periods of inflammation by acting as a negative regulator of the proinflammatory cytokine IFN-γ. Therefore, agents that increase the activity of TCPTP are of general interest as modifiers of inflammatory signaling events. A previous study demonstrated that the small molecule spermidine is a selective activator of TCPTP in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate whether activation of TCPTP by spermidine was capable of alleviating IFN-γ-induced, proinflammatory signaling and barrier dysfunction in human intestinal epithelial cells. Studies revealed that treatment of T84 and HT29/cl.19A colonocytes with spermidine increased both TCPTP protein levels and enzymatic activity, correlating with a decrease in the phosphorylation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 and 3, downstream mediators of IFN-γ signaling, upon coadministration of spermidine to IFN-γ-treated cells.

https://openalex.org/W2076401374,"Background Treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma patients harboring BRAF(V600E) has improved drastically after the discovery of the BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib. However, drug resistance is a recurring problem, and prognoses are still very bad for patients harboring BRAF wild-type. Better markers for targeted therapy are therefore urgently needed. Methodology In this study, we assessed the individual kinase activity profiles in 26 tumor samples obtained from patients with metastatic malignant melanoma using peptide arrays with 144 kinase substrates. In addition, we studied the overall ex-vivo inhibitory effects of vemurafenib and sunitinib on kinase activity status. Results Overall kinase activity was significantly higher in lysates from melanoma tumors compared to normal skin tissue. Furthermore, ex-vivo incubation with both vemurafenib and sunitinib caused significant decrease in phosphorylation of kinase substrates, i.e kinase activity. While basal phosphorylation profiles were similar in BRAF wild-type and BRAF(V600E) tumors, analysis with ex-vivo vemurafenib treatment identified a subset of 40 kinase substrates showing stronger inhibition in BRAF(V600E) tumor lysates, distinguishing the BRAF wild-type and BRAF(V600E) tumors. Interestingly, a few BRAF wild-type tumors showed inhibition profiles similar to BRAF(V600E) tumors. The kinase inhibitory effect of vemurafenib was subsequently analyzed in cell lines harboring different BRAF mutational status with various vemurafenib sensitivity in-vitro. Conclusions Our findings suggest that multiplex kinase substrate array analysis give valuable information about overall tumor kinase activity. Furthermore, intra-assay exposure to kinase inhibiting drugs may provide a useful tool to study mechanisms of resistance, as well as to identify predictive markers."
https://openalex.org/W1991598480,"Background A patient’s journey through the health care system is influenced by clinical and system processes across the continuum of care. Methods To inform optimized access to care and patient flow for individuals with traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI), we developed a simulation model that can examine the full impact of therapeutic or systems interventions across the care continuum for patients with traumatic spinal cord injuries. The objective of this paper is to describe the detailed development of this simulation model for a major trauma and a rehabilitation centre in British Columbia (BC), Canada, as part of the Access to Care and Timing (ACT) project and is referred to as the BC ACT Model V1.0. Findings To demonstrate the utility of the simulation model in clinical and administrative decision-making we present three typical scenarios that illustrate how an investigator can track the indirect impact(s) of medical and administrative interventions, both upstream and downstream along the continuum of care. For example, the model was used to estimate the theoretical impact of a practice that reduced the incidence of pressure ulcers by 70%. This led to a decrease in acute and rehabilitation length of stay of 4 and 2 days, respectively and a decrease in bed utilization of 9% and 3% in acute and rehabilitation. Conclusion The scenario analysis using the BC ACT Model V1.0 demonstrates the flexibility and value of the simulation model as a decision-making tool by providing estimates of the effects of different interventions and allowing them to be objectively compared. Future work will involve developing a generalizable national Canadian ACT Model to examine differences in care delivery and identify the ideal attributes of SCI care delivery."

However, no evidence suggests that CGRP could affect the differentiation of stem cells toward osteoblasts. In this study, we genetically modified adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) by introducing the CGRP gene through adenoviral vector transduction and investigated on cellular proliferation and osteoblast differentiation in vitro and osteogenesis in vivo as well. For the in vitro analyses, rat ADSCs were transducted with adenoviral vectors containing the CGRP gene (Ad-CGRP) and were cultured in complete osteoblastic medium. The morphology, proliferative capacity, and formation of localized regions of mineralization in the cells were evaluated. The expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and special markers of osteoblasts, such as Collagen I, Osteocalcin (BPG) and Osteopontin (OPN), were measured by cytochemistry, MMT, RT-PCR, and Western blot. For the in vivo analyses, the Ad-CGRP-ADSCs/Beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) constructs were implanted in rat radial bone defects for 12 weeks. Radiography and histomorphology evaluations were carried out on 4 weeks and 12 weeks. Our analyses indicated that heterogeneous spindle-shaped cells and localized regions of mineralization were formed in the CGRP-transduced ADSCs (the transduced group). A higher level of cellular proliferation, a high expression level of ALP on days 7 and 14 (p<0.05), and increased expression levels of Collagen I, BPG and OPN presented in transduced group (p<0.05). The efficiency of new bone formation was dramatically enhanced in vivo in Ad-CGRP-ADSCs/β-TCP group but not in β-TCP group and ADSCs/β-TCP group. Our results reveal that ADSCs transduced with an Ad-CGRP vector have stronger potential to differentiate into osteoblasts in vitro and are able to regenerate a promising new tissue engineering bone in vivo. Our findings suggest that CGRP-transduced ADSCs may serve as seed cells for bone tissue engineering and provide a potential way for treating bone defects."
https://openalex.org/W1989376657,"The ontogeny of continent-wide navigation mechanisms of the individual organism, despite being crucial for the understanding of animal movement and migration, is still poorly understood. Several previous studies, mainly conducted on passerines, indicate that inexperienced, juvenile birds may not generally correct for displacement during fall migration. Waterbirds such as the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos, Linnaeus 1758) are more flexible in their migration behavior than most migratory songbirds, but previous experiments with waterbirds have not yet allowed clear conclusions about their navigation abilities. Here we tested whether immature mallard ducks correct for latitudinal displacement during fall migration within Europe. During two consecutive fall migration periods, we caught immature females on a stopover site in southeast Sweden, and translocated a group of them ca. 1,000 km to southern Germany. We followed the movements of the ducks via satellite GPS-tracking and observed their migration decisions during the fall and consecutive spring migration. The control animals released in Ottenby behaved as expected from banding recoveries: they continued migration during the winter and in spring returned to the population’s breeding grounds in the Baltics and Northwest Russia. Contrary to the control animals, the translocated mallards did not continue migration and stayed at Lake Constance. In spring, three types of movement tactics could be observed: 61.5% of the ducks (16 of 26) stayed around Lake Constance, 27% (7 of 26) migrated in a northerly direction towards Sweden and 11.5% of the individuals (3 of 26) headed east for ca. 1,000 km and then north.

Our aim here was to replicate findings of associations between 7 of the implicated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IRF5, BLK, STAT4, TNFAIP3, SPP1, TNIP1 and ETS1 genes with susceptibility to childhood-onset SLE in the Japanese population. In particular, we focused on gender differences in allelic frequencies. Methodology/Principal Findings The 7 SNPs were genotyped using TaqMan assays in 75 patients with childhood-onset SLE and in 190 healthy controls. The relationship between the cumulative number of risk alleles and SLE manifestations was explored in childhood-onset SLE. Logistic regression was used to test the effect of each polymorphism on susceptibility to SLE, and Wilcoxon rank sum testing was used for comparison of total risk alleles. Data on rs7574865 in the STAT4 gene and rs9138 in SPP1 were replicated for associations with SLE when comparing cases and controls (corrected P values ranging from 0.0043 to 0.027). The rs2230926 allele of TNFAIP3 was associated with susceptibility to SLE in males, but after Bonferroni correction there were no significant associations with any of the other four SNPs in IRF5, BLK, TNIP1 and ETS1 genes. The cumulative number of risk alleles was significantly increased in childhood-onset SLE relative to healthy controls (P = 0.0000041). Male SLE patients had a slightly but significantly higher frequency of the TNFAIP3 (rs2230926G) risk allele than female patients (odds ratio [OR] = 4.05, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] = 1.46–11.2 P<0.05). Conclusions Associations of polymorphisms in STAT4 and SPP1 with childhood-onset SLE were confirmed in a Japanese population. Although these are preliminary results for a limited number of cases, TNFAIP3 rs2230926G may be an important predictor of disease onset in males. We also replicated findings that the cumulative number of risk alleles was significantly increased in childhood-onset SLE."
https://openalex.org/W2037146879,"The functional brain connectivity studies are generally based on the synchronization of the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals. Functional connectivity measures usually assume a stable relationship over time; however, accumulating studies have reported time-varying properties of strength and spatial distribution of functional connectivity. The present study explored the modulation of functional connectivity between two regions by a third region using the physiophysiological interaction (PPI) technique. We first identified eight brain networks and two regions of interest (ROIs) representing each of the networks using a spatial independent component analysis. A voxel-wise analysis was conducted to identify regions that showed modulatory interactions (PPI) with the two ROIs of each network. Mostly, positive modulatory interactions were observed within regions involved in the same system. For example, the two regions of the dorsal attention network revealed modulatory interactions with the regions related to attention, while the two regions of the extrastriate network revealed modulatory interactions with the regions in the visual cortex. In contrast, the two regions of the default mode network (DMN) revealed negative modulatory interactions with the regions in the executive network, and vice versa, suggesting that the activities of one network may be associated with smaller within network connectivity of the competing network. These results validate the use of PPI analysis to study modulation of resting-state functional connectivity by a third region. The modulatory effects may provide a better understanding of complex brain functions."
https://openalex.org/W2028662067,"Regeneration of artificially induced lesions was monitored in nubbins of the branching coral Acropora muricata at two reef-flat sites representing contrasting environments at Réunion Island (21°07'S, 55°32'E). Growth of these injured nubbins was examined in parallel, and compared to controls. Biochemical compositions of the holobiont and the zooxanthellae density were determined at the onset of the experiment, and the photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm ) of zooxanthellae was monitored during the experiment. Acropora muricata rapidly regenerated small lesions, but regeneration rates significantly differed between sites. At the sheltered site characterized by high temperatures, temperature variations, and irradiance levels, regeneration took 192 days on average. At the exposed site, characterized by steadier temperatures and lower irradiation, nubbins demonstrated fast lesion repair (81 days), slower growth, lower zooxanthellae density, chlorophyll a concentration and lipid content than at the former site. A trade-off between growth and regeneration rates was evident here. High growth rates seem to impair regeneration capacity. We show that environmental conditions conducive to high zooxanthellae densities in corals are related to fast skeletal growth but also to reduced lesion regeneration rates. We hypothesize that a lowered regenerative capacity may be related to limited availability of energetic and cellular resources, consequences of coral holobionts operating at high levels of photosynthesis and associated growth."

Members of the A/B subfamily include the well studied pancreatic digestive enzymes CPA1, CPA2, and CPB1 as well as other members expressed in non-pancreatic tissues and presumably functioning in the degradation or processing of endogenous proteins and peptides (2Wei S.

A number of distinct mutations in the mouse Agtpbp1 gene all cause the death of Purkinje cells as well as other cell types including olfactory bulb mitral cells, retinal photoreceptor cells, and testis spermatocytes. The genes encoding other members of the CCP gene family were named Agbl1 through Agbl5 for the human and mouse genes. In zebrafish, most of the gene names are similar to those of the human and mouse with the exception of the gene encoding zebrafish CCP2 (which was named zte25). To reduce confusion, the protein names and not the gene names are used in the present report. The functions of the CCPs are not entirely clear.

For example, α-tubulin is translated with a C-terminal tyrosine that is removed by a carboxypeptidase to produce detyrosinated tubulin (17Hallak M.E. Rodriguez J.A. Barra H.S. Caputto R.

Alternatively, the C-terminal glutamate residue of detyrosinated α-tubulin can be removed by a carboxypeptidase to produce Δ2 tubulin (22Paturle-Lafanechère L. Manier M. Trigault N. Pirollet F. Mazarguil H. Job D. Accumulation of Δ2-tubulin, a major tubulin variant that cannot be tyrosinated, in neuronal tissues and in stable microtubule assemblies.J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1529-1543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both α- and β-tubulins are also modified by ligases that attach a glutamate residue to the γ-carboxylate side chain of specific glutamate residues located near the C terminus of the protein (23Eddé B. Rossier J. Le Caer J.P. Desbruyères E. Gros F. Denoulet P. Posttranslational glutamylation of α-tubulin.Science. 1990; 247: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Other ligases attach additional glutamates to the C-terminal carboxylate group of the side chain, extending the length of the side chain. In addition, other ligases attach glycine residues to the γ-carboxylate side chain and/or extend the glycine side chain. The glutamates and/or glycines attached to the side chain of α- and β-tubulins are removed by carboxypeptidases. Evidence that CCPs perform various steps in the processing of tubulin has been provided by studies examining the effect of overexpression or knockdown of the CCPs in cell lines. From these analyses, it was suggested that CCP2 removes tyrosine from α-tubulin to generate detyrosinated tubulin (24Sahab Z.J. Hall M.D. Me Sung Y. Dakshanamurthy S. Ji Y. Kumar D. Byers S.W. Tumor suppressor RARRES1 interacts with cytoplasmic carboxypeptidase AGBL2 to regulate the α-tubulin tyrosination cycle.Cancer Res. 2011; 71: 1219-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); CCP1, CCP4, and CCP6 remove glutamate from the C terminus of detyrosinated tubulin to generate Δ2 tubulin and reduce the length of polyglutamate side chains; and CCP5 selectively removes the γ-linked glutamate from the side chain (12Rogowski K. van Dijk J.

Our results suggest that although these enzymes exhibit overlapping enzymatic functions they play unique roles in zebrafish biology. We describe clear differences in the temporal and spatial distributions of these enzymes and demonstrate a role for both CCP1 and CCP5 in embryogenesis. Additionally, we demonstrate differences in detectable levels of tubulin isoforms in whole body protein extracts after knockdown of CCP5 mRNA, suggesting a major role for this enzyme in the processing of zebrafish tubulin. Zebrafish (Danio rerio, AB strain) were maintained within the Zebrafish Facility of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine according to standard conditions as described previously (26Kimmel C.B.

Zebrafish embryos were obtained from wild type fish by natural pairwise matings. Embryos were maintained at 28 °C and injected with morpholino oligonucleotides between the one- and two-cell stages (27Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. A Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish (Danio rerio). 5th Ed. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR2007Google Scholar). Morpholino oligonucleotides were obtained from Gene Tools, LLC (Philomath, OR) and dissolved in distilled water. GeneTools standard control was used. Morpholino oligonucleotide sequences were as follows: CCP1-MO1, GGTGTTCTGTACGAAAACATCAAGT; CCP1-MO2, TTAAGAACACCAAAACTCACCGACA; CCP5-MO, ATGACCTGCACACACAAGATCAACA. In each experiment, 6 ng of morpholino oligonucleotide were used for the morpholinos directed against CCP1 mRNA, and 3 ng were used for those directed against CCP5 mRNA. Control morpholino oligonucleotide was matched for ng amount with experimental morpholino oligonucleotides. RNA was extracted from zebrafish embryos using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the protocol for animal tissues. RNA quality was assessed by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the Superscript III First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Amplification of desired cDNAs was performed by PCR with PfuUltraII DNA polymerase (Stratagene) using a program of 95 °C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. For primer sequences, contact the authors. A 3′ overhang was added to each amplicon by incubating with Taq polymerase at 72 °C for 10 min. Cloning into the pCRII-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen) was performed by TOPO TA cloning according to the manufacturer's instructions. All cloning was verified by sequencing. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed on an ABI 7900 using Power SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Data were normalized to β-actin expression and are shown as relative expression. For primer sequences, contact the authors. Probes for in situ hybridization were generated by in vitro transcription from a linearized plasmid template using a DIG RNA Labeling kit (Roche Applied Science) with T3 or T7 RNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's protocol. Lithium chloride-precipitated RNA probe was redissolved in water, and quality was assessed by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis. Zebrafish embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4 °C and processed for in situ hybridization according to standard protocols (28Thisse C. Thisse B. High-resolution in situ hybridization to whole-mount zebrafish embryos.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar) using a probe hybridization temperature of 70 °C. Embryos were finally incubated with the alkaline phosphatase substrate BM purple (Roche Applied Science) in coloration buffer for 8 h at room temperature, reactions were stopped by incubation in 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.2 for 10 min, and embryos were transferred to 70% glycerol for imaging. Zebrafish embryos were collected at 48 hpf, euthanized using an overdose of tricaine, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Embryos were washed with PBS and transferred to cold 100% acetone at −20 °C for 20 min. Embryos were washed with PBS, bleached in 3% hydrogen peroxide, and incubated in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). After incubation, medium was removed, and embryos were incubated with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 (PBST) containing 5% BSA and antibodies directed against the following epitopes at the indicated dilution: polyglutamylation (1:1500; a gift from Martin A. Gorovsky) and acetylated tubulin (1:600; Sigma-Aldrich, clone 6-11B-1). Embryos were washed in PBST and incubated in PBST containing 5% BSA and 1:400 dilutions of the polyclonal secondary antibodies DyLight 549 anti-mouse and DyLight 488 anti-rabbit. Embryos were washed in PBST and transferred to a mounting medium composed of 53% benzyl alcohol (by weight), 45% glycerol (by weight), and 2% N-propyl gallate (29Drummond I. Studying cilia in zebrafish.Methods Cell Biol. 2009; 93: 197-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) in glass bottom microwell dishes (MatTek). Images were captured using a Zeiss SP2 confocal microscope. Two-color confocal z-series images were acquired using sequential laser excitation. Zebrafish embryos were harvested at 2 dpf, anesthetized using tricaine, dechorionated, and deyolked according to the methods described in Link et al. (30Link V. Shevchenko A. Heisenberg C.P. Proteomics of early zebrafish embryos.BMC Dev. Biol. 2006; 6: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Deyolked embryos were combined with SDS sample buffer and incubated for 15 min at 95 °C. SDS-PAGE was performed according to standard procedures followed by transfer to nitrocellulose paper. Blots were incubated with antibodies against polyglutamylation (1:1500) and α-tubulin (1:5000; clone DM1A, Sigma-Aldrich) followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000; Cell Signaling Technology). Band densities were calculated using ImageJ software. The zebrafish nucleotide collection and genomic databases were searched for orthologs of human CCPs. The nucleotide collection, which represents mRNA sequences, contained full-length sequences of zebrafish orthologs of CCP1, CCP2, and CCP5 (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). These orthologs were also detected in the zebrafish genomic database. The nucleotide collection contained partial sequences of a zebrafish ortholog of CCP6, and together with searches of the genomic database and the expressed sequence tag database, it was possible to piece together the full-length zebrafish CCP6 (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). An ortholog of CCP4 was present in the zebrafish genomic database, but this was not detected in the nucleotide collection representing mRNA sequences or in the expressed sequence tag database, which also represents mRNA sequences. Thus, although the genomic sequences could be spliced together into an appropriate open reading frame for a zebrafish ortholog of CCP4, the absence of any sequences in the mRNA-derived databases suggest that this gene is expressed at extremely low levels, is expressed in a very restricted cell type, or is a pseudogene. Several oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify a putative zebrafish ortholog of CCP4 from cDNA libraries of 2-dpf zebrafish, but no PCR product was obtained of the expected size even after 40 cycles (data not shown). No ortholog of the gene encoding mammalian CCP3 was detected in the zebrafish genomic or mRNA-derived databases. Zebrafish CCP1, CCP2, CCP5, and CCP6 are generally similar to their human orthologs in terms of domain structure (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). In addition to the CP domain, which has homology to the CP domain of A/B and N/E subfamily enzymes, all CCPs in humans and zebrafish contain a β-sheet-rich domain to the N-terminal side of the CP domain. Although there is no sequence similarity between this domain in the CCPs and the prodomain in the CPA/B subfamily of enzymes, the size of the domain and the high degree of β-sheet secondary structure are similar among the A/B and CCP subfamilies (31Otero A. Rodríguez de la Vega M. Tanco S. Lorenzo J. Avilés F.X. Reverter D. The novel structure of a cytosolic M14 metallocarboxypeptidase (CCP) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa: a model for mammalian CCPs.FASEB J. 2012; 26: 3754-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The β-sheet domain in the CCPs is likely to be functional based on the high degree of sequence identity between human and zebrafish orthologs (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). For CCP1, CCP5, and CCP6, the degree of sequence identity within the β-sheet domain is greater than within the functional CP domain. In addition to the β-sheet and CP domains, CCP1, CCP2, and CCP5 contain additional N-terminal and/or C-terminal domains. For CCP1, the N-terminal 300 amino acids are well conserved between human and zebrafish (65% amino acid identity), and the C-terminal region also shows reasonably high conservation (54% identity). The nuclear export signal localized to the N-terminal region and the nuclear localization signal in the C-terminal region of human CCP1 (9Wang T. Morgan J.I.

Other regions of the N-terminal portion of CCP1 as well as the N-terminal and/or C-terminal regions of CCP2 and CCP5 show moderate conservation with 21–38% amino acid identity between human and zebrafish orthologs (Fig. 1). In addition, CCP5 contains a unique insertion within the CP domain that adds ∼90 residues to the length of this region; this feature is conserved between human and zebrafish CCP5 orthologs (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). The gene encoding CCP2 is officially named zte25 (zebrafish testis expressed) because expression in adult zebrafish is restricted to the testis. UniGene reports 19 CCP2 expressed sequence tags, 18 of which are from the testis, and one from olfactory epithelium. Zebrafish CCP1, CCP5, and CCP6 mRNAs have not been reported in the literature other than in situ hybridization data deposited to ZFIN for CCP5. 5B. Thisse and C. Thisse (2004) Fast release clones: a high throughput expression analysis. ZFIN direct data submission. The time course of expression for each CCP mRNA during zebrafish development was determined by qPCR analysis. All CCP mRNA data were normalized to β-actin mRNA expression and made relative to maximal expression. The results indicated a small initial drop in CCP1, CCP5, and CCP6 mRNA levels (Fig. 2) likely due to the expression of maternal transcripts at 2 hpf. Levels of CCP1, CCP2, and CCP6 mRNAs gradually increased during development with a large increase at about 6–8 dpf. Levels of CCP5 mRNA were variable at the earliest time points measured and showed an increase at 5 dpf relative to earlier and later time points (Fig. 2). In situ hybridization was performed to compare the expression patterns of zebrafish CCP1, CCP2, CCP5, and CCP6 mRNA levels at early time points (Fig. 3). At 24 hpf, CCP1 and CCP5 mRNAs were expressed broadly throughout the embryo with concentrated expression in the olfactory placode. By 48 hpf, CCP1 and CCP5 mRNAs were particularly strong within the brain, whereas CCP5 and CCP2 transcripts could be detected within the olfactory placodes as well as the pronephric ducts. Expression of CCP6 mRNA could not be detected by in situ hybridization at any time point examined. The function of CCP1 and CCP5 was investigated using morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (Fig. 4). Morpholino oligonucleotides were injected into zebrafish embryos soon after fertilization (one- to two-cell stage) to knock down gene expression during early stages of development by interfering with mRNA splicing. Two splice-blocking morpholino oligonucleotides were designed to interfere with CCP1 mRNA splicing. Injection of 6 ng of CCP1-MO1, which was designed to interfere with splicing between exons 4 and 5, resulted in an 80% decrease in CCP1 mRNA levels at 2 dpf compared with 6 ng of a control morpholino oligonucleotide (Fig. 4, left panel).

Regarding the pathogenic mechanisms employed by this species we provide the first whole genome analysis of two C. ureolyticus isolates including the type strain. Comparative analysis, subtractive hybridisation and gene ontology searches against other Campylobacter species identifies the high degree of heterogenicity between C. ureolyticus isolates, in addition to the identification of 106 putative virulence associated factors, 52 of which are predicted to be secreted. Such factors encompass each of the known virulence tactics of pathogenic Campylobacter spp. including adhesion and colonisation (CadF, PEB1, IcmF and FlpA), invasion (ciaB and 16 virB-virD4 genes) and toxin production (S-layer RTX and ZOT). Herein, we provide the first virulence catalogue for C. ureolyticus, the components of which theoretically provide this emerging species with sufficient arsenal to establish pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2050102680,"Host resistance against parasites depends on three aspects: the ability to prevent, control and clear infections. In vertebrates the immune system consists of innate and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is particularly important for preventing infection and eradicating established infections at an early stage while adaptive immunity is slow, but powerful, and essential for controlling infection intensities and eventually clearing infections. Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules are central in adaptive immunity, and studies on parasite resistance and MHC in wild animals have found effects on both infection intensity (parasite load) and infection status (infected or not). It seems MHC can affect both the ability to control infection intensities and the ability to clear infections. However, these two aspects have rarely been considered simultaneously, and their relative importance in natural populations is therefore unclear. Here we investigate if MHC class I genotype affects infection intensity and infection status with a frequent avian malaria infection Haemoproteus majoris in a natural population of blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus. We found a significant negative association between a single MHC allele and infection intensity but no association with infection status. Blue tits that carry a specific MHC allele seem able to suppress H. majoris infection intensity, while we have no evidence that this allele also has an effect on clearance of the H. majoris infection, a result that is in contrast with some previous studies of MHC and avian malaria. A likely explanation could be that the clearance rate of avian malaria parasites differs between avian malaria lineages and/or between avian hosts."

https://openalex.org/W2090499567,"Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, a major nosocomial complication. The infective form of C. difficile is the spore, a dormant and resistant structure that forms under stress. Although spore germination is the first committed step in CDI onset, the temporal and spatial distribution of ingested C. difficile spores is not clearly understood. We recently reported that CamSA, a synthetic bile salt analog, inhibits C. difficile spore germination in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we took advantage of the anti-germination activity of bile salts to determine the fate of ingested C. difficile spores. We tested four different bile salts for efficacy in preventing CDI. Since CamSA was the only anti-germinant tested able to prevent signs of CDI, we characterized CamSa's in vitro stability, distribution, and cytotoxicity. We report that CamSA is stable to simulated gastrointestinal (GI) environments, but will be degraded by members of the natural microbiota found in a healthy gut. Our data suggest that CamSA will not be systemically available, but instead will be localized to the GI tract. Since in vitro pharmacological parameters were acceptable, CamSA was used to probe the mouse model of CDI. By varying the timing of CamSA dosage, we estimated that C. difficile spores germinated and established infection less than 10 hours after ingestion. We also showed that ingested C. difficile spores rapidly transited through the GI tract and accumulated in the colon and cecum of CamSA-treated mice. From there, C. difficile spores were slowly shed over a 96-hour period. To our knowledge, this is the first report of using molecular probes to obtain disease progression information for C. difficile infection."

In phase one, 27 functional/tagging polymorphisms in C-type lectins and MCP-1/CCR2 axis were genotyped in 458 RA patients and 512 controls. Carriers of Dectin-2rs4264222T allele had an increased risk of RA (OR = 1.47, 95%CI 1.10–1.96) whereas patients harboring the DC-SIGNrs4804803G, MCP-1rs1024611G, MCP-1rs13900T and MCP-1rs4586C alleles had a decreased risk of developing the disease (OR = 0.66, 95%CI 0.49–0.88; OR = 0.66, 95%CI 0.50–0.89; OR = 0.73, 95%CI 0.55–0.97 and OR = 0.68, 95%CI 0.51–0.91). Interestingly, significant gender-specific differences were observed for Dectin-2rs4264222 and Dectin-2rs7134303: women carrying the Dectin-2rs4264222T and Dectin-2rs7134303G alleles had an increased risk of RA (OR = 1.93, 95%CI 1.34–2.79 and OR = 1.90, 95%CI 1.29–2.80). Also five other SNPs showed significant associations only with one gender: women carrying the MCP-1rs1024611G, MCP-1rs13900T and MCP-1rs4586C alleles had a decreased risk of RA (OR = 0.61, 95%CI 0.43–0.87; OR = 0.67, 95%CI 0.47–0.95 and OR = 0.60, 95%CI 0.42–0.86). In men, carriers of the DC-SIGNrs2287886A allele had an increased risk of RA (OR = 1.70, 95%CI 1.03–2.78), whereas carriers of the DC-SIGNrs4804803G had a decreased risk of developing the disease (OR = 0.53, 95%CI 0.32–0.89). In phase 2, we genotyped these SNPs in 754 RA patients and 519 controls, leading to consistent gender-specific associations for Dectin-2rs4264222, MCP-1rs1024611, MCP-1rs13900 and DC-SIGNrs4804803 polymorphisms in the pooled sample (OR = 1.38, 95%CI 1.08–1.77; OR = 0.74, 95%CI 0.58–0.94; OR = 0.76, 95%CI 0.59–0.97 and OR = 0.56, 95%CI 0.34–0.93).

https://openalex.org/W1977532423,"Chronic immune activation despite long-term therapy poses an obstacle to immune recovery in HIV infection. The role of antigen presenting cells (APCs) in chronic immune activation during HIV infection remains to be fully determined. APCs, the frontline of immune defense against pathogens, are capable of distinguishing between pathogens and non-pathogenic, commensal bacteria. We hypothesized that HIV infection induces dysfunction in APC immune recognition and response to some commensal bacteria and that this may promote chronic immune activation. Therefore we examined APC inflammatory cytokine responses to commensal lactobacilli. We found that APCs from HIV-infected patients produced an enhanced inflammatory response to Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 as compared to APCs from healthy, HIV-negative controls. Increased APC expression of TLR2 and CD36, signaling through p38-MAPK, and decreased expression of MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) in HIV infection was associated with this heightened immune response. Our findings suggest that chronic HIV infection enhances the responsiveness of APCs to commensal lactobacilli, a mechanism that may partly contribute to chronic immune activation."
https://openalex.org/W2003230562,"Cellular therapy is a promising therapeutic strategy for malignant diseases. The efficacy of this therapy can be limited by poor infiltration of the tumor by immune effector cells. In particular, NK cell infiltration is often reduced relative to T cells. A novel class of fusion proteins was designed to enhance the recruitment of specific leukocyte subsets based on their expression of a given chemokine receptor. The proteins are composed of an N-terminal chemokine head, the mucin domain taken from the membrane-anchored chemokine CX3CL1, and a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) membrane anchor replacing the normal transmembrane domain allowing integration of the proteins into cell membranes when injected into a solid tumor. The mucin domain in conjunction with the chemokine head acts to specifically recruit leukocytes expressing the corresponding chemokine receptor.A fusion protein comprising a CXCL10 chemokine head (CXCL10-mucin-GPI) was used for proof of concept for this approach and expressed constitutively in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. FPLC was used to purify proteins. The recombinant proteins efficiently integrated into cell membranes in a process dependent upon the GPI anchor and were able to activate the CXCR3 receptor on lymphocytes. Endothelial cells incubated with CXCL10-mucin-GPI efficiently recruited NK cells in vitro under conditions of physiologic flow, which was shown to be dependent on the presence of the mucin domain. Experiments conducted in vivo using established tumors in mice suggested a positive effect of CXCL10-mucin-GPI on the recruitment of NK cells.The results suggest enhanced recruitment of NK cells by CXCL10-mucin-GPI. This class of fusion proteins represents a novel adjuvant in cellular immunotherapy. The underlying concept of a chemokine head fused to the mucin domain and a GPI anchor signal sequence may be expanded into a broader family of reagents that will allow targeted recruitment of cells in various settings."
https://openalex.org/W1996484496,"In many organisms, 3' maturation of tRNAs is catalyzed by the endoribonuclease, RNase BN/RNase Z, which cleaves after the discriminator nucleotide to generate a substrate for addition of the universal CCA sequence. However, tRNAs or tRNA precursors that already contain a CCA sequence are not cleaved, thereby avoiding a futile cycle of removal and readdition of these essential residues. We show here that the adjacent C residues of the CCA sequence and an Arg residue within a highly conserved sequence motif in the channel leading to the RNase catalytic site are both required for the protective effect of the CCA sequence. When both of these determinants are present, CCA-containing RNAs in the channel are unable to move into the catalytic site; however, substitution of either of the C residues by A or U or mutation of Arg(274) to Ala allows RNA movement and catalysis to proceed. These data define a novel mechanism for how tRNAs are protected against the promiscuous action of a processing enzyme."

The objective of present investigation was to investigate the concomitant administration of cycloart-23-ene-3β, 25-diol+sitagliptin and L-glutamine+sitagliptin in streptozotocin - nicotinamide induced diabetic Sprague Dawley. Type 2 diabetes was induced in overnight fasted male Sprague Dawley rats pre-treated with nicotinamide (100 mg/kg, i.p.) followed by administration of streptozotocin (55 mg/kg, i.p.) 20 min after. The rats were divided into; I- non-diabetic, II- diabetic control, III- Sitagliptin (5 mg/kg, p.o.)+cycloart-23-ene-3β, 25-diol (1 mg/kg, p.o.), IV- Sitagliptin (5 mg/kg, p.o.)+L-glutamine (1000 mg/kg, p.o.). The concomitant treatment of cycloart-23-ene-3β, 25-diol and L-glutamine with sitagliptin was 8 weeks. Plasma glucose, body weight, food and water intake were determined every week. Glycosylated haemoglobin, lipid profile, plasma and colonic active (GLP-1) (7-36) amide, plasma and pancreatic insulin, histology of pancreata and biomarkers of oxidative stress were measured after 8(th) week treatment. Concomitant administration of cycloart-23-ene-3β, 25-diol and L-glutamine with sitagliptin significantly (p<0.001) reduced plasma glucose, glyoxylated haemoglobin, lipid profile and oxidative stress parameters compared to diabetic control groups. Both concomitant treatment increased plasma and pancreatic insulin as well as plasma and colonic active (GLP-1) (7-36) amide secretion. Histological analysis by Gomori staining observed less destruction of pancreatic β cells. The result obtained from this study; it is concluded that concomitant administration of cycloart-23-ene-3β, 25-diol+sitagliptin and L-glutamine+sitagliptin showed additive antihyperglycaemic effect in diabetic rats."

Participants stood on a balance board that collected real-time data regarding postural sway along two axes (x, y) while they viewed a series of images depicting food items varying in nutritional value and individual preferences. Overall, participants showed reliable postural sway toward highly preferred and away from highly non-preferred items. This effect became more pronounced over time; sway along the mediolateral axis showed no reliable variation by preference. Results carry implications for two-factor (homeostatic versus hedonic) neurobehavioral theories of hunger and appetitive motivation, and carry applied clinical implications for the measurement and management of abnormal eating behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2045320256,"Common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) are thought to represent major intermediates in the transition of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to B lineage lymphocytes. However, it has been obvious for some time that CLPs are heterogeneous, and there has been controversy concerning their differentiation potential. We have now resolved four Flt3(+) CLP subsets that are relatively homogenous and capable of forming B cells. Differentiation potential and gene expression patterns suggest Flt3(+) CLPs lacking both Ly6D and RAG-1 are the least differentiated. In addition to B cells, they generate natural killer (NK) and dendritic cells (DCs). At the other extreme is a subset of the recently described Flt3(+) Ly6D(+) CLPs that have a history of RAG-1 expression and are B lineage restricted. These relatively abundant and potent CLPs were depleted within 48 hours of acute in vivo estrogen elevation, suggesting they descend from hormone regulated progenitors. This contrasts with the hormone insensitivity of other CLP subsets that include NK lineage progenitors. This progenitor heterogeneity and differentiation complexity may add flexibility in response to environmental changes. Expression of RAG-1 and display of Ly6D are both milestone events, but they are neither synchronized nor dependent on each other."
https://openalex.org/W2073969466,"Natural populations experience environmental conditions that vary across space and over time. This variation is often correlated between localities depending on the geographical separation between them, and different species can respond to local environmental fluctuations similarly or differently, depending on their adaptation. How this emerging structure in environmental correlation (between-patches and between-species) affects spatial community dynamics is an open question. This paper aims at a general understanding of the interactions between the environmental correlation structure and population dynamics in spatial networks of local communities (metacommunities), by studying simple two-patch, two-species systems. Three different pairs of interspecific interactions are considered: competition, consumer-resource interaction, and host-parasitoid interaction. While the results paint a relatively complex picture of the effect of environmental correlation, the interaction between environmental forcing, dispersal, and local interactions can be understood via two mechanisms. While increasing between-patch environmental correlation couples immigration and local densities (destabilising effect), the coupling between local populations under increased between-species environmental correlation can either amplify or dampen population fluctuations, depending on the patterns in density dependence. This work provides a unifying framework for modelling stochastic metacommunities, and forms a foundation for a better understanding of population responses to environmental fluctuations in natural systems."
https://openalex.org/W1967878199,"Pho85 is a versatile cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) found in budding yeast that regulates a myriad of eukaryotic cellular functions in concert with 10 cyclins (called Pcls). Unlike cell cycle CDKs that require phosphorylation of a serine/threonine residue by a CDK-activating kinase (CAK) for full activation, Pho85 requires no phosphorylation despite the presence of an equivalent residue. The Pho85-Pcl10 complex is a key regulator of glycogen metabolism by phosphorylating the substrate Gsy2, the predominant, nutritionally regulated form of glycogen synthase. Here we report the crystal structures of Pho85-Pcl10 and its complex with the ATP analog, ATPγS. The structure solidified the mechanism for bypassing CDK phosphorylation to achieve full catalytic activity. An aspartate residue, invariant in all Pcls, acts as a surrogate for the phosphoryl adduct of the phosphorylated, fully activated CDK2, the prototypic cell cycle CDK, complexed with cyclin A. Unlike the canonical recognition motif, SPX(K/R), of phosphorylation sites of substrates of several cell cycle CDKs, the motif in the Gys2 substrate of Pho85-Pcl10 is SPXX. CDK5, an important signal transducer in neural development and the closest known functional homolog of Pho85, does not require phosphorylation either, and we found that in its crystal structure complexed with p25 cyclin a water/hydroxide molecule remarkably plays a similar role to the phosphoryl or aspartate group. Comparison between Pho85-Pcl10, phosphorylated CDK2-cyclin A, and CDK5-p25 complexes reveals the convergent structural characteristics necessary for full kinase activity and the variations in the substrate recognition mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2087556592,"Background Persistent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection causes chronic liver diseases and is a global health problem. Although new triple therapy (pegylated-interferon, ribavirin, and telaprevir/boceprevir) has recently been started and is expected to achieve a sustained virologic response of more than 70% in HCV genotype 1 patients, there are several problems to be resolved, including skin rash/ageusia and advanced anemia. Thus a new type of anti-HCV drug is still needed. Methodology/Principal Findings Recently developed HCV drug assay systems using HCV-RNA-replicating cells (e.g., HuH-7-derived OR6 and Li23-derived ORL8) were used to evaluate the anti-HCV activity of drug candidates. During the course of the evaluation of anti-HCV candidates, we unexpectedly found that two preclinical antimalarial drugs (N-89 and its derivative N-251) showed potent anti-HCV activities at tens of nanomolar concentrations irrespective of the cell lines and HCV strains of genotype 1b. We confirmed that replication of authentic HCV-RNA was inhibited by these drugs. Interestingly, however, this anti-HCV activity did not work for JFH-1 strain of genotype 2a. We demonstrated that HCV-RNA-replicating cells were cured by treatment with only N-89. A comparative time course assay using N-89 and interferon-α demonstrated that N-89-treated ORL8 cells had more rapid anti-HCV kinetics than did interferon-α-treated cells. This anti-HCV activity was largely canceled by vitamin E. In combination with interferon-α and/or ribavirin, N-89 or N-251 exhibited a synergistic inhibitory effect. Conclusions/Significance We found that the preclinical antimalarial drugs N-89 and N-251 exhibited very fast and potent anti-HCV activities using cell-based HCV-RNA-replication assay systems. N-89 and N-251 may be useful as a new type of anti-HCV reagents when used singly or in combination with interferon and/or ribavirin."
https://openalex.org/W2077811489,"At present we know that phenotypic differences between organisms arise from a variety of sources, like protein sequence divergence, regulatory sequence divergence, alternative splicing, etc. However, we do not have yet a complete view of how these sources are related. Here we address this problem, studying the relationship between protein divergence and the ability of genes to express multiple isoforms. We used three genome-wide datasets of human-mouse orthologs to study the relationship between isoform multiplicity co-occurrence between orthologs (the fact that two orthologs have more than one isoform) and protein divergence. In all cases our results showed that there was a monotonic dependence between these two properties. We could explain this relationship in terms of a more fundamental one, between exon number of the largest isoform and protein divergence. We found that this last relationship was present, although with variations, in other species (chimpanzee, cow, rat, chicken, zebrafish and fruit fly). In summary, we have identified a relationship between protein divergence and isoform multiplicity co-occurrence and explained its origin in terms of a simple gene-level property. Finally, we discuss the biological implications of these findings for our understanding of inter-species phenotypic differences."
