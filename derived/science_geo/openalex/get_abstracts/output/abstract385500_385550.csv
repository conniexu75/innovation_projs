https://openalex.org/W2014333807,"For Deinococcus radiodurans and other bacteria which are extremely resistant to ionizing radiation, ultraviolet radiation, and desiccation, a mechanistic link exists between resistance, manganese accumulation, and protein protection. We show that ultrafiltered, protein-free preparations of D. radiodurans cell extracts prevent protein oxidation at massive doses of ionizing radiation. In contrast, ultrafiltrates from ionizing radiation-sensitive bacteria were not protective. The D. radiodurans ultrafiltrate was enriched in Mn, phosphate, nucleosides and bases, and peptides. When reconstituted in vitro at concentrations approximating those in the D. radiodurans cytosol, peptides interacted synergistically with Mn2+ and orthophosphate, and preserved the activity of large, multimeric enzymes exposed to 50,000 Gy, conditions which obliterated DNA. When applied ex vivo, the D. radiodurans ultrafiltrate protected Escherichia coli cells and human Jurkat T cells from extreme cellular insults caused by ionizing radiation. By establishing that Mn2+-metabolite complexes of D. radiodurans specifically protect proteins against indirect damage caused by gamma-rays delivered in vast doses, our findings provide the basis for a new approach to radioprotection and insight into how surplus Mn budgets in cells combat reactive oxygen species."
https://openalex.org/W2015601936,"Recently, the orphan receptor G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) has been proposed as a potential cannabinoid receptor, although controversy remains on its physiological roles. Current evidence suggests a role for GPR55 as a receptor for the lysophospholipid lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI). In this study, we show that GPR55 is expressed in several prostate and ovarian cancer cell lines, both at the mRNA and at the protein level, and that it has a critical role in regulating proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. We further show that GPR55 mediates the effects of LPI in prostate and ovarian cancer cells. Indeed we demonstrate that LPI is able to induce calcium mobilization and activation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 in these cells and that both pharmacological blockade of GPR55 and its downregulation using specific small interfering RNA strongly inhibits these processes. We further identify an autocrine loop by which LPI is synthesized by cytosolic phospholipase A2, pumped out of the cell by the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCC1/MRP1, and is then able to initialize cascades downstream of GPR55. All together, these data demonstrate a role of LPI and its receptor GPR55 in cancer cells in activating an autocrine loop that regulates cell proliferation. These findings may have important implications for LPI as a novel cancer biomarker and for its receptor GPR55 as a potential therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2059301290,"Using a pharmacological inhibitor of Hsp90 in cultured malarial parasite, we have previously implicated Plasmodium falciparum Hsp90 (PfHsp90) as a drug target against malaria. In this study, we have biochemically characterized PfHsp90 in terms of its ATPase activity and interaction with its inhibitor geldanamycin (GA) and evaluated its potential as a drug target in a preclinical mouse model of malaria. In addition, we have explored the potential of Hsp90 inhibitors as drugs for the treatment of Trypanosoma infection in animals. Our studies with full-length PfHsp90 showed it to have the highest ATPase activity of all known Hsp90s; its ATPase activity was 6 times higher than that of human Hsp90. Also, GA brought about more robust inhibition of PfHsp90 ATPase activity as compared with human Hsp90. Mass spectrometric analysis of PfHsp90 expressed in P. falciparum identified a site of acetylation that overlapped with Aha1 and p23 binding domain, suggesting its role in modulating Hsp90 multichaperone complex assembly. Indeed, treatment of P. falciparum cultures with a histone deacetylase inhibitor resulted in a partial dissociation of PfHsp90 complex. Furthermore, we found a well known, semisynthetic Hsp90 inhibitor, namely 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, to be effective in attenuating parasite growth and prolonging survival in a mouse model of malaria. We also characterized GA binding to Hsp90 from another protozoan parasite, namely Trypanosoma evansi. We found 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin to potently inhibit T. evansi growth in a mouse model of trypanosomiasis. In all, our biochemical characterization, drug interaction, and animal studies supported Hsp90 as a drug target and its inhibitor as a potential drug against protozoan diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2103983168,"Primates show activity patterns ranging from nocturnality to diurnality, with a few species showing activity both during day and night. Among anthropoids (monkeys, apes and humans), nocturnality is only present in the Central and South American owl monkey genus Aotus. Unlike other tropical Aotus species, the Azara's owl monkeys (A. azarai) of the subtropics have switched their activity pattern from strict nocturnality to one that also includes regular diurnal activity. Harsher climate, food availability, and the lack of predators or diurnal competitors, have all been proposed as factors favoring evolutionary switches in primate activity patterns. However, the observational nature of most field studies has limited an understanding of the mechanisms responsible for this switch in activity patterns. The goal of our study was to evaluate the hypothesis that masking, namely the stimulatory and/or inhibitory/disinhibitory effects of environmental factors on synchronized circadian locomotor activity, is a key determinant of the unusual activity pattern of Azara's owl monkeys. We use continuous long-term (6-18 months) 5-min-binned activity records obtained with actimeter collars fitted to wild owl monkeys (n = 10 individuals) to show that this different pattern results from strong masking of activity by the inhibiting and enhancing effects of ambient luminance and temperature. Conclusive evidence for the direct masking effect of light is provided by data showing that locomotor activity was almost completely inhibited when moonlight was shadowed during three lunar eclipses. Temperature also negatively masked locomotor activity, and this masking was manifested even under optimal light conditions. Our results highlight the importance of the masking of circadian rhythmicity as a determinant of nocturnality in wild owl monkeys and suggest that the stimulatory effects of dim light in nocturnal primates may have been selected as an adaptive response to moonlight. Furthermore, our data indicate that changes in sensitivity to specific environmental stimuli may have been an essential key for evolutionary switches between diurnal and nocturnal habits in primates."

This study aimed to examine the role of mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) oxidation in mediating oleate's protective effect against palmitate-induced lipotoxicity. CPT1 (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1), which is the key regulatory enzyme of mitochondrial LCFA oxidation, is inhibited by malonyl-CoA, an intermediate of lipogenesis. We showed that expression of a mutant form of CPT1 (CPT1mt), which is active but insensitive to malonyl-CoA inhibition, in C2C12 myotubes led to increased LCFA oxidation flux even in the presence of high concentrations of glucose and insulin. Furthermore, similar to preincubation with oleate, CPT1mt expression protected muscle cells from palmitate-induced apoptosis and insulin resistance by decreasing the content of deleterious palmitate derivates (i.e. diacylglycerols and ceramides). Oleate preincubation exerted its protective effect by two mechanisms: (i) in contrast to CPT1mt expression, oleate preincubation increased the channeling of palmitate toward triglycerides, as a result of enhanced diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 expression, and (ii) oleate preincubation promoted palmitate oxidation through increasing CPT1 expression and modulating the activities of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and AMP-activated protein kinase. In conclusion, we demonstrated that targeting mitochondrial LCFA oxidation via CPT1mt expression leads to the same protective effect as oleate preincubation, providing strong evidence that redirecting palmitate metabolism toward oxidation is sufficient to protect against palmitate-induced lipotoxicity.

Long-chain saturated FA (SFA), such as palmitate (C16:0) and stearate (C18:0), are the most lipotoxic. Consistently, palmitate induces apoptosis in many cell types (9Sparagna G.C. Hickson-Bick D.L.

In muscle cells, palmitate's cytotoxic effect is mediated by increased intracellular concentrations of diacylglycerols (DAG) and ceramides (11Turpin S.M. Lancaster G.I. Darby I.

In contrast, monounsaturated FA (MUFA), such as oleate (C18:1), protect against SFA-induced toxicity (8Coll T. Eyre E. Rodríguez-Calvo R. Palomer X. Sánchez R.M. Merlos M. Laguna J.C.

Whether oleate exerts such a protective effect on palmitate-induced apoptosis in skeletal muscle cells has not been reported.The mechanisms by which oleate protects cells from palmitate toxicity are not well understood. SFA, which are reported to be less efficiently incorporated into triglycerides (TG) than MUFA, lead to increased accumulation of DAG (8Coll T. Eyre E. Rodríguez-Calvo R. Palomer X. Sánchez R.M.

Oleate has been proposed to protect cells from palmitate-induced lipotoxicity by promoting its esterification into TG, a neutral form of FA storage (8Coll T. Eyre E. Rodríguez-Calvo R. Palomer X.

However, it was recently hypothesized that oleate protects from palmitate-induced insulin resistance and inflammation by increasing its mitochondrial oxidation (as shown by increased CPT1 (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1) gene expression) (8Coll T. Eyre E. Rodríguez-Calvo R. Palomer X. Sánchez R.M. Merlos M. Laguna J.C. Vázquez-Carrera M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 11107-11116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). CPT1 is a transmembrane enzyme of the mitochondrial outer membrane, which converts long-chain acyl-CoA to acylcarnitine, which enters the mitochondrial matrix and undergoes β-oxidation. Because of its inhibition by malonyl-CoA, an intermediate of lipogenesis synthesized by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), CPT1 is the key regulatory enzyme of long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) β-oxidation (17McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). CPT1 exists in at least two isoforms, CPT1A (liver isoform) and CPT1B (muscle isoform), each of which is found in several tissue and cell types (17McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 18Perdomo G. Commerford S.R. Richard A.M. Adams S.H. Corkey B.E. O'Doherty R.M. Brown N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27177-27186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).Whether defects in muscle mitochondrial metabolism are a cause or a consequence of insulin resistance has been extensively investigated but remains controversial. In rodents, some argue against the concept that insulin resistance is mediated by muscle mitochondrial dysfunction (19Turner N. Bruce C.R. Beale S.M. Hoehn K.L. So T. Rolph M.S. Cooney G.J. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 2085-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 20Hancock C.R. Han D.H. Chen M. Terada S. Yasuda T. Wright D.C. Holloszy J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7815-7820Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Others have demonstrated that skeletal muscles from obese and insulin-resistant patients exhibit diminished rates of palmitate oxidation, in association with a decrease in CPT1 activity (21Kim J.Y. Hickner R.C. Cortright R.L. Dohm G.L. Houmard J.A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 279: E1039-E1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Obese and insulin-resistant skeletal muscles also have fewer and dysmorphic mitochondria, which may decrease FA oxidative capacity (22Kelley D.E. He J. Menshikova E.V. Ritov V.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2944-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar, 23He J. Watkins S. Kelley D.E. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Because accumulation of palmitate-derived metabolites within muscle cells is associated with decreased mitochondrial FA oxidative capacity, increasing LCFA oxidation may exert a protective effect. Additionally, contradictory results have been reported concerning the impact of a modulation of mitochondrial LCFA oxidation on palmitate-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes (11Turpin S.M. Lancaster G.I. Darby I. Febbraio M.A. Watt M.J. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 291: E1341-E1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 22Kelley D.E. He J. Menshikova E.V. Ritov V.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2944-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar) and pancreatic β-cells (13Miller T.A. LeBrasseur N.K. Cote G.M. Trucillo M.P. Pimentel D.R. Ido Y. Ruderman N.B. Sawyer D.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 336: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 24Kong J.Y. Rabkin S.W. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ.

Commun. 2008; 375: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This question has never been addressed in skeletal muscle cells.In the present study, we aimed to determine whether oleate protects skeletal muscle cells from palmitate-induced apoptosis and to examine the role of mitochondrial LCFA in mediating any such effect of oleate. To this end, we expressed a mutant form of CPT1A (CPT1 M593S, CPT1mt), which is active but insensitive to malonyl-CoA inhibition (26Morillas M. Gómez-Puertas P. Bentebibel A. Sellés E. Casals N. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. Asins G. Serra D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9058-9063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), in C2C12 myotubes. The metabolic and cellular consequences of an increased LCFA oxidation through CPT1mt expression were compared with the effects of preincubation with oleate (OA) to decipher the mechanisms underlying oleate's protective effect and to determine if direct manipulation of mitochondrial LCFA oxidation would lead to the same protective effect as OA.DISCUSSIONOur findings indicate that oleate preincubation protects skeletal muscle cells from palmitate-induced apoptosis by acting on its metabolism through two mechanisms. It promotes the clearance of DAG-containing palmitate moieties toward TG and palmitate oxidation. Second, because targeting mitochondrial LCFA oxidation directly, via the expression of a malonyl-CoA-insensitive CPT1 (CPT1mt), also has a protective effect, redirection of palmitate metabolism toward oxidation appears to be sufficient for protection against its lipotoxic effect (Fig. 7).Consistent with previous studies (11Turpin S.M. Lancaster G.I. Darby I. Febbraio M.A. Watt M.J. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 291: E1341-E1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 35Rachek L.I. Musiyenko S.I. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we showed that palmitate induced apoptosis in C2C12 myotubes. First, prolonged exposure of myotubes to palmitate promoted intracellular accumulation of TG (specifically TG species with at least two C16: C51 and C53), DAG (specifically 16-16 and 16-18), and ceramides (specifically Cer16:0). As previously suggested (11Turpin S.M. Lancaster G.I. Darby I. Febbraio M.A. Watt M.J. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 291: E1341-E1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), these deleterious metabolites result from enhanced de novo ceramide synthesis rather than from SM degradation because cellular SM content was unaffected by palmitate treatment. Second, palmitate exposure increased SFA and decreased MUFA, leading to a decreased MUFA/SFA ratio. Previous studies have suggested that palmitate-induced DAG and TG accumulation might result from a higher esterification flux for palmitate than for oleate (15Montell E. Turini M. Marotta M. Roberts M. Noé V. Ciudad C.J. Macé K. Gómez-Foix A.M. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 280: E229-E237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Listenberger L.L. Han X. Lewis S.E. Cases S.

However, our metabolic investigations also revealed that palmitate is much less prone to oxidation than oleate, which could favor directing its metabolism toward esterification.We found that preincubation with oleate decreased palmitate esterification into DAG and TG after 3 h of palmitate exposure, resulting in a decreased DAG/TG ratio. However, oleate preincubation promoted intracellular TG accumulation, in particular TG species containing at least one C18 (C53, C55, and C57) after a 24-h palmitate exposure. This difference probably results from an enhanced expression of DGAT2, whose affinity is 50% higher for oleyl-CoA than for palmitoyl-CoA (36Cases S. Stone S.J. Zhou P. Yen E. Tow B. Lardizabal K.D.

Hawkins D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38862-38869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Indeed, oleate preincubation decreased TG and DAG species that contain solely C16 (i.e. C51 and DAG 16-16), suggesting that preincubation with oleate diverts DAG 16-16 to TG enriched with C18. Additionally, the lipidomic analysis revealed that oleate preincubation reduced palmitate content and increased the MUFA/SFA ratio. Interestingly, preincubation with oleate also reduced palmitoleate content in palmitate-exposed cells, which might be due to decreased SCD1 gene expression. Because oleate is a product of SCD1, we hypothesized that it can induce a negative feedback on SCD1 gene expression. It has been reported that oleate preincubation led to an increase in CPT1 mRNA level in skeletal muscle cells (8Coll T. Eyre E. Rodríguez-Calvo R. Palomer X. Sánchez R.M. Merlos M. Laguna J.C. Vázquez-Carrera M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 11107-11116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 38Wensaas A.J. Rustan A.C. Just M. Berge R.K. Drevon C.A. Gaster M. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that oleate preincubation enhanced mitochondrial oxidation of palmitate, as a consequence of increased CPT1 gene and protein expressions. Our findings also indicate that preincubation with oleate increases mitochondrial LCFA oxidation through a second mechanism, namely activation of AMPK, which leads to ACC inhibition and, thus, to increased CPT1 activity.We investigated whether acting directly on mitochondrial oxidation, by expressing CPT1mt, leads to the same protective effect as oleate preincubation. In agreement with the work of Sebastián et al. (34Sebastián D. Herrero L. Serra D. Asins G. Hegardt F.G. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 292: E677-E686Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we showed that CPT1mt expression induced an increase in LCFA oxidation at the expense of their esterification. Like oleate preincubation, DAG and ceramide contents are reduced by CPT1mt expression. In contrast to preincubation with oleate, CPT1mt expression decreased the rate of esterification of palmitate into TG (regarding the two species raised by palmitate) and had no impact on the nature or content of FA in myotubes. These results contrast with those of Perdomo et al. (18Perdomo G. Commerford S.R. Richard A.M. Adams S.H. Corkey B.E. O'Doherty R.M. Brown N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27177-27186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), who reported that expression of the wild-type CPT1 did not modify TG, DAG, or ceramide contents. This difference highlights the importance of malonyl-CoA in the regulation of CPT1 activity. It has been suggested that increased mitochondrial LCFA oxidation can lead to an accumulation of ASP (39Muoio D.M. Newgard C.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 367-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). However, in our study, the CO2/ASP ratio for palmitate was increased, not decreased, following CPT1mt expression, both in the presence of low glucose and high glucose/insulin concentrations. This indicates that CPT1mt expression permits the maintenance of complete oxidation of palmitate, thus avoiding accumulation of incompletely oxidized molecules.It is well established that skeletal muscle insulin resistance is associated with intramuscular lipid accumulation. Inhibition of CPT1 by etomoxir, an irreversible inhibitor, increased lipid deposition in skeletal muscle and exacerbated insulin resistance in high fat-fed animals (40Dobbins R.L. Szczepaniak L.S. Bentley B. Esser V. Myhill J. McGarry J.D. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), indicating that alteration in LCFA flux into mitochondria is critical for regulating the deleterious effect of lipids on insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, it has been recently reported that in vivo wild-type CPT1 overexpression in rat skeletal muscle enhanced mitochondrial LCFA oxidation and decreased high fat diet-induced insulin resistance (41Bruce C.R. Brolin C. Turner N. Cleasby M.E. van der Leij F.R. Cooney G.J. Kraegen E.W. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 292: E1231-E1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 42Bruce C.R. Hoy A.J.

These effects were associated with a moderate decrease in both TG level and palmitate incorporation into DAG. We hypothesize that these mild effects may be due to the expression of wild-type CPT1, which is sensitive to malonyl-CoA inhibition. Indeed, it has been shown in muscle from obese and diabetic subjects that malonyl-CoA level is increased, leading to a decrease in mitochondrial LCFA oxidation (41Bruce C.R. Brolin C. Turner N. Cleasby M.E. van der Leij F.R. Cooney G.J. Kraegen E.W. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 292: E1231-E1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 42Bruce C.R. Hoy A.J. Turner N. Watt M.J. Allen T.L. Carpenter K. Cooney G.J. Febbraio M.A. Kraegen E.W. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 550-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrated that targeting mitochondrial LCFA oxidation, via the expression of a malonyl-CoA-insensitive CPT1, led to the same protective effect as preincubation with oleate, providing strong evidence that redirecting palmitate metabolism toward oxidation is sufficient to protect against palmitate-induced apoptosis and insulin resistance. In conclusion, we propose that increased CPT1 activity together with decreased malonyl-CoA sensitivity may be a promising strategy for the treatment of the deleterious effects of lipid accumulation caused by obesity, insulin resistance, or aging.

https://openalex.org/W2162909221,"Previously, cell type-specific expression of AtHKT1;1, a sodium transporter, improved sodium (Na+) exclusion and salinity tolerance in Arabidopsis. In the current work, AtHKT1;1, was expressed specifically in the root cortical and epidermal cells of an Arabidopsis GAL4-GFP enhancer trap line. These transgenic plants were found to have significantly improved Na+ exclusion under conditions of salinity stress. The feasibility of a similar biotechnological approach in crop plants was explored using a GAL4-GFP enhancer trap rice line to drive expression of AtHKT1;1 specifically in the root cortex. Compared with the background GAL4-GFP line, the rice plants expressing AtHKT1;1 had a higher fresh weight under salinity stress, which was related to a lower concentration of Na+ in the shoots. The root-to-shoot transport of 22Na+ was also decreased and was correlated with an upregulation of OsHKT1;5, the native transporter responsible for Na+ retrieval from the transpiration stream. Interestingly, in the transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtHKT1;1 in the cortex and epidermis, the native AtHKT1;1 gene responsible for Na+ retrieval from the transpiration stream, was also upregulated. Extra Na+ retrieved from the xylem was stored in the outer root cells and was correlated with a significant increase in expression of the vacuolar pyrophosphatases (in Arabidopsis and rice) the activity of which would be necessary to move the additional stored Na+ into the vacuoles of these cells. This work presents an important step in the development of abiotic stress tolerance in crop plants via targeted changes in mineral transport."
https://openalex.org/W1995181458,"The Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) has produced an extensive collection of '-omic' data on glioblastoma (GBM), resulting in several key insights on expression signatures. Despite the richness of TCGA GBM data, the absence of lower grade gliomas in this data set prevents analysis genes related to progression and the uncovering of predictive signatures. A complementary dataset exists in the form of the NCI Repository for Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (Rembrandt), which contains molecular and clinical data for diffuse gliomas across the full spectrum of histologic class and grade. Here we present an investigation of the significance of the TCGA consortium's expression classification when applied to Rembrandt gliomas. We demonstrate that the proneural signature predicts improved clinical outcome among 176 Rembrandt gliomas that includes all histologies and grades, including GBMs (log rank test p = 1.16e-6), but also among 75 grade II and grade III samples (p = 2.65e-4). This gene expression signature was enriched in tumors with oligodendroglioma histology and also predicted improved survival in this tumor type (n = 43, p = 1.25e-4). Thus, expression signatures identified in the TCGA analysis of GBMs also have intrinsic prognostic value for lower grade oligodendrogliomas, and likely represent important differences in tumor biology with implications for treatment and therapy. Integrated DNA and RNA analysis of low-grade and high-grade proneural gliomas identified increased expression and gene amplification of several genes including GLIS3, TGFB2, TNC, AURKA, and VEGFA in proneural GBMs, with corresponding loss of DLL3 and HEY2. Pathway analysis highlights the importance of the Notch and Hedgehog pathways in the proneural subtype. This demonstrates that the expression signatures identified in the TCGA analysis of GBMs also have intrinsic prognostic value for low-grade oligodendrogliomas, and likely represent important differences in tumor biology with implications for treatment and therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2067931814,"High-throughput post-genomic studies are now routinely and promisingly investigated in biological and biomedical research. The main statistical approach to select genes differentially expressed between two groups is to apply a t-test, which is subject of criticism in the literature. Numerous alternatives have been developed based on different and innovative variance modeling strategies. However, a critical issue is that selecting a different test usually leads to a different gene list. In this context and given the current tendency to apply the t-test, identifying the most efficient approach in practice remains crucial. To provide elements to answer, we conduct a comparison of eight tests representative of variance modeling strategies in gene expression data: Welch's t-test, ANOVA [1], Wilcoxon's test, SAM [2], RVM [3], limma [4], VarMixt [5] and SMVar [6]. Our comparison process relies on four steps (gene list analysis, simulations, spike-in data and re-sampling) to formulate comprehensive and robust conclusions about test performance, in terms of statistical power, false-positive rate, execution time and ease of use. Our results raise concerns about the ability of some methods to control the expected number of false positives at a desirable level. Besides, two tests (limma and VarMixt) show significant improvement compared to the t-test, in particular to deal with small sample sizes. In addition limma presents several practical advantages, so we advocate its application to analyze gene expression data."

We previously demonstrated that the hemopexin (PEX) domain of MMP-9 is a prerequisite for enhanced cell migration. Using a biochemical approach, we now report that dimerization of MMP-9 through the PEX domain appears necessary for MMP-9-enhanced cell migration. Following a series of substitution mutations within the MMP-9 PEX domain, blade IV was shown to be critical for homodimerization, whereas blade I was required for heterodimerization with CD44. Blade I and IV mutants showed diminished enhancement of cell migration compared with wild type MMP-9-transfected cells. Peptides mimicking motifs in the outermost strands of the first and fourth blades of the MMP-9 PEX domain were designed.

In the 1990s, several broad-spectrum MMP inhibitors were evaluated in clinical trials involving cancer, arthritis, and later, heart failure. The absence of clinical efficacy of these drug trials and the conviction that MMPs are critical players in disease processes lead to a more thorough investigation of the biological roles of individual MMPs (3Björklund M.

Crystal structures of various domains have been solved for several MMPs including MMP-1, -2, -3, -9, -13, and -14. Bridging biochemical information with in vitro and in vivo experiments has been helpful in better understanding the specific roles of individual MMPs. Because the catalytic sites of most MMPs are highly homologous, leading to difficulty producing non-cross-reactive inhibitors, intense scrutiny of other MMP domains has followed. The substrate binding function of the hemopexin (PEX) domain is recognized to play an important role in MMP function (4Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). With the exception of MMP-7, -23, and -26, which lack the PEX domain, all other MMPs form a propeller structure composed of four blades; each blade consists of one α-helix and four anti-parallel β-strands. Among secreted MMPs, only MMP-9 is capable of forming a homodimer; the precise role of this homodimerization has yet to be elucidated. Solving the crystal structure of MMP-9 demonstrated that the homodimer is formed through blade IV of the PEX domain (6Cha H. Kopetzki E. Huber R. Lanzendörfer M. Brandstetter H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 1065-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In contrast to all other secreted MMPs, pro-MMP-9 and pro-MMP-2 bind TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, respectively, through their PEX domain. Other MMPs require activation for TIMP to bind to their catalytic domain. MMP-9 has been shown to bind to several cell surface receptors including CD44, LRP-1, LRP-2, Ku, and β1-integrin (7Redondo-Muñoz J. Ugarte-Berzal E. García-Marco J.A. del Cerro M.H.

Based on less homology between PEX domains as compared with catalytic domains of different MMPs (homology sequence alignment: Clustalw2), targeting the PEX domain has been proposed as an option to inhibit a specific MMP. In contrast to general concepts regarding the requirement for activation of pro-MMPs to generate biological activity, we recently demonstrated that pro-MMP-9 enhances COS-1 cell migration independent of its proteolytic activity (16Dufour A.

In this report we investigated biochemical and biological properties of MMP-9 dimerization and dissected the signaling pathways involved in MMP-9-mediated cell migration.

COS 1 monkey kidney epithelial, human fibrosarcoma HT-1080, and breast cancer MDA-MB-435 cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Transfection of plasmid DNA in COS-1 cells was achieved using polyethylenimine (Polysciences) or TransfectinTM reagents (Bio-Rad) and the transfected cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C followed by biochemical and biological assays. Peptides and inhibitors were incubated with cells for 24 h prior to co-immunoprecipitation and transwell chamber migration assays. Final concentrations of the peptides ranged from 1 μm to 1 mm, as indicated in the figure legends. MMP-9 with a carboxyl-terminal Myc tag (MMP-9/Myc) was generated by using the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). The MMP-9 cDNA containing the open reading frame of MMP-9 was amplified by a PCR approach using the primers sets: forward primer 1315, 5′-CGGAATTCCGCCAACATGAGCCTCTGGCAGCCCCT-3′ and reverse primer 2507, 5′-GGAAGATCTCTAGTCCTCAGGGCACTGCAGGATGTC-3′. The resultant PCR fragment was then cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector to generate MMP-9/Myc chimeric cDNA. To generate HA (human influenza hemagglutinin)-tagged MMP-9 chimeric cDNA, the HA tag was placed between the propeptide and catalytic domains of MMP-9 by a site-directed mutagenesis approach (QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) using wild type MMP-9 as a template with mutagenesis primers containing the HA sequence (forward primer 2512, 5′-GGGGTCCCAGACCTGGGCAGATACCCCTACGACGTGCCCGACTCGCCTCCAAACCTTTGAGGGCGAC-3′ and reverse primer 2513, 5′-GTCGCCCTCAAAGGTTTGGAAGGCGTAGTCGGGCACGTCGTAGGGGTATCTGCCCAGGTCTGGGACCCC-3′). To determine the role of the PEX domain of MMP-9, a substitution mutation was engineered by replacing the PEX domain of MMP-9 with that of MMP-2. A modified two-step PCR was employed as previously described (18Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol.

Using the resultant PCR products as templates (fragment A and B), the signal/propeptide/catalytic/hinge region of MMP-9 was then fused together with the MMP-2 PEX domain by PCR using forward primer 1315 and reverse primer 1356. The resultant PCR fragments were then inserted into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) to generate MMP9/PEXMMP2/Myc chimeric cDNAs. Similarly, we generated substitution mutations of MMP-9/blade I, II, III, and IV by replacing the outermost β-strand of each blade with the corresponding sequence of MMP-2. Primers used to generate these chimeric cDNAs were designed as follow: 1) MMP-9/blade I, fragment A, 1315 and 2557 (5′-GGGAGCCGGCCGGGGCCCCTGCTGATCGCCGAC-3′),and fragment B, 2558 (5′-GTCGGCGATCAGCAGGGGCCCCGGCCGGCTCCC-3′) and 2507; 2) MMP-9/blade II, fragment A, 1315, and 2596 (5′-GTGTACACAGGCGCGACCTTGGAGCGAGGGTACCCCAAGCCACTGGACAAGCTGGGC-3′), and fragment B, 2597 (5′-CACATGTGTCCGCGCTGGAACCTCGCTCCCATGGGGTTCGGTGACCTGTTCGACCCG-3′), and 2507; 3) MMP-9/blade III, fragment A, 1315 and 2540 (5′-GTTCGACGTGAAGGCGAAGAAAATGGATCCTGGCTTCCCCAAGCTCGTGGACCGGATGTTCC-3′), and fragment B, 2541 (5′-GGAACATCCGGTCCACGAGCTTGGGGAAGCCAGGATCCATTTTCTTCGCCTTCACGTCGAAC-3′) and 2507; and 4) MMP-9/blade IV: fragment A, 1315 and 2538 (5′-GTTCCCGGAGTGAGTTGAAGAGCGTGAAGTTTGGAAGCGTGACCTATGACATCCTG-3′), and fragment B, 2539 (5′-CAGGATGTCATAGGTCACGCTTCCAAACTTCACGCTCTTCAACTCACTCCGGGAAC-3′), and 2507. All the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Small interfering oligonucleotides specific for human and monkey CD44 and control luciferase to express short hairpin RNA were designed using a Worldwide Web-based online software system (Block-iT RNAi Designer, Invitrogen) for mammalian RNA interference. Two specific 21-nucleotide sequences spanning positions 173–193 (CD44shRNA-1) and 678–698 (CD44-shRNA-2) of the human CD44 gene (GenBankTM accession number L05424) were synthesized. The sense and antisense template oligonucleotides encoding a hairpin structure were annealed and cloned into the RNAi-Ready pSIREN-Retro Q vector (Clontech). As a control, a luciferase protein from firefly Pyrocoelia pectoralis as a target gene was employed as previously reported (19Cao J. Chiarelli C. Richman O. Zarrabi K. Kozarekar P. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6232-6240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A retroviral supernatant was obtained by co-transfection of a vector encoding the envelope gene (pAmphotropic) and a retroviral expression vector containing the CD44 shRNA, or luciferase shRNA control into human embryonic kidney GP2–293 packaging cells (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. COS-1 cells were infected with the supernatant containing retrovirus, and the cells were then selected with 4 μg/ml of puromycin for 1–2 weeks. The effects of shRNA on gene expression were evaluated by real time RT-PCR using RNA of the pooled resistant cells. The most effective stable CD44 knockdown cell lines were selected. Cultured cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/PBS. CD44 was detected with anti-CD44 antibody (Novus Biologicals, CO) followed by secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa 568 (Invitrogen). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Invitrogen). 1 × 106 cells/ml of cells suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% BSA were incubated with CD44 primary monoclonal antibody for 60 min at 4 °C followed by incubation with anti-mouse FITC-labeled (1:1000) secondary antibody for 60 min at 4 °C. After extensive washing, the cells were stained with propidium iodide to determine viability of the cells. CD44 expression was measured using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Cell lysates were prepared as recommended by Kinexus Bioinformatics Corporation (Vancouver, BC, Canada). COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with vector or MMP-9 cDNA. Forty-eight hours after transfection, total cellular proteins were extracted using ice-cold lysis buffer containing detergent and protease inhibitor mixture and subjected to a customer antibody microarray analysis (Kinexus Bioinformatics Corp.). Over 500 pan-specific and 300 phospho-site-specific antibodies were screened against both vector control and MMP-9 samples. Sixteen different proteins that are known to link cell migration and displayed over 2-fold difference between control and MMP-9-transfected cells were further analyzed by a semi-quantitative immunoblotting examination (Kinexus Bioinformatics Corp.). Twenty-four hours following transfection, the conditioned medium in the absence of serum was collected from the transfected COS-1 cells. The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1% CHAPS, and protease inhibitors mixture (Sigma). Both the conditioned medium and the cell lysates were incubated with specific antibodies for 24 h at 4 °C. Antigen-antibody complexes were precipitated with protein A-agarose beads followed by a brief centrifugation, washing, and then electrophoresis in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Western blotting was then followed using a corresponding antibody. Cell membranes were prepared from MMP-9-transfected COS-1 cells following nitrogen cavitation as described previously (20Zucker S. Wieman J.M. Lysik R.M. Wilkie D. Ramamurthy N.S. Golub L.M. Lane B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 1608-1614PubMed Google Scholar). The post-nuclear supernatant (770 × g for 10 min) was collected, and heavy organelles were removed by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 15 min. This supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to recover the plasma membrane-enriched lighter cell organelles in the pellet. Conditioned medium of COS-1 cells transfected with MMP-9 cDNA was isolated and clarified by centrifugation. Cell-free conditioned medium was subjected to gelatin-Sepharose 4B column chromatography as previously described (21Imai K. Okada Y. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1111-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The DMSO eluted fractions were dialyzed against buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 0.03% sodium azide, pH 7.4), concentrated, and subjected to a Hiload 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade column (GE Healthcare) mounted on an FPLC apparatus (GE Pharmacia Aktapurifier, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). One ml of sample was injected and the flow rate was 1 ml min−1. One-ml fractions were collected and 10 μl of each fraction was examined by gelatin zymogram. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of triplicates. Each experiment was repeated as least 3 times. Student's t test and analysis of variants were used to assess differences with p < 0.05 considered to be significant. Basic protocols for these techniques have been described previously (16Dufour A. Sampson N.S. Zucker S. Cao J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2008; 217: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 22Cao J. Rehemtulla A. Bahou W. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30174-30180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that the PEX domain of pro-MMP-9 is required for enhanced cell migration independent of its proteolytic activity (16Dufour A. Sampson N.S. Zucker S. Cao J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2008; 217: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To dissect the mechanism underlying MMP-9-induced cell migration, the PEX domain of MMP-9 was examined using biochemical and molecular approaches. Among all secreted MMPs, only MMP-9 has been found to form a homodimer. Employing proteins purified from an Escherichia coli expression system (Fig. 1A, ribbon diagram based on PDB file 1ITV), Cha et al. (6Cha H. Kopetzki E. Huber R. Lanzendörfer M. Brandstetter H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 1065-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) showed that MMP-9 homodimer formation requires an interaction of the fourth blade of adjacent PEX domains. Because proteins purified from a bacterial system lack posttranslational modifications, e.g. glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can impact the function of most mammalian proteins (23Davis B.G. Science. 2004; 303: 480-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), it is essential to test if the dimerization of MMP-9 also occurs in a mammalian cell expression system. To this end, we fused HA and Myc tags into the MMP-9 cDNA, to generate MMP-9/HA and MMP-9/Myc chimeras, respectively (Fig. 1B), followed by transfection of the cDNAs into COS-1 monkey kidney epithelial cells. Insertion of either HA tag between the propeptide domain and catalytic domain or Myc tag at the end of the PEX domain of MMP-9 does not interfere with the overall properties of wild type MMP-9 as evidenced by gelatin zymography and Western blotting (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Immunoprecipitation with either HA or Myc antibodies resulted in identifying MMP-9 in both the cell lysates and conditioned medium of transfected COS-1 cells (supplemental Fig. S1C). COS-1 cells co-transfected with HA- and Myc-tagged MMP-9 cDNAs were then employed to examine homodimer formation using a co-immunoprecipitation approach. The HA-tagged MMP-9 proteins in the conditioned medium of transfected COS-1 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies followed by a Western blotting probed by anti-Myc antibodies. This approach revealed the identification of Myc-tagged MMP-9 in the complex immunoprecipitated by anti-HA antibody, suggesting that MMP-9 forms homodimers in cell-conditioned medium (Fig. 1C). To further confirm this observation, the reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation was performed. Anti-Myc antibodies were employed to precipitate Myc-tagged MMP-9 complexes in the conditioned medium of co-transfected COS-1 cells followed by Western blotting using anti-HA antibodies. This reciprocal approach confirms that MMP-9 does form a homodimer in the condition medium of transfected COS-1 cells. To further explore if homodimer formation of MMP-9 occurs within the cell or following secretion from the cell, the cell lysate of transfected COS-1 cells was also examined by the co-immunoprecipitation method (Fig. 1C). MMP-9 homodimer formation was demonstrated in the cell lysate, suggesting that MMP-9 dimerization occurs during MMP-9 secretion. We previously demonstrated that the PEX domain of pro-MMP-9 plays an important role in enzymatic activity-independent cell migration (16Dufour A. Sampson N.S. Zucker S. Cao J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2008; 217: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To test if dimerization of the MMP-9 PEX domain is a prerequisite for MMP-9-induced cell migration, we generated MMP-9 PEX domain mutations. Because MMP-2 does not form homodimers (24Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Tryggvason K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 7414-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), the PEX domain of MMP-9 was replaced by that of MMP-2 to generate MMP9/PEXMMP-2 chimeric cDNA using a two-step PCR approach (22Cao J. Rehemtulla A. Bahou W. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30174-30180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The resultant PCR product containing MMP9/PEXMMP-2 was then inserted into a pcDNA3.1/Myc vector to generate a final construct of MMP9/PEXMMP-2/Myc chimeric cDNA (Fig. 1B). Substitution of the PEX domain of MMP-9 with MMP-2 failed to couple with the wild type MMP-9 in co-transfected COS-1 cells not only in the conditioned medium (Fig. 1D) but also in the cell lysate (data not shown). The failure of the dimerization of the PEX domain mutation was not due to the loss of protein synthesis, trafficking, or proteolytic activity as evidenced by Western blotting and gelatin zymography (supplemental Fig. S1D). To determine whether the loss of homodimerization of this MMP-9 PEX domain mutation affects MMP-9-induced cell migration, a transwell chamber migration assay was employed (16Dufour A. Sampson N.S. Zucker S. Cao J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2008; 217: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells transfected with the PEX mutant MMP-9 (MMP-9/PEXMMP-2/Myc) failed to enhance cell migration to the extent of wild type MMP-9, suggesting a role of MMP-9 homodimer in cell migration (Fig. 2A). To further confirm the biological role of MMP-9 homodimers in cell migration, wild type and mutant MMP-9-transfected cells were subjected to phagokinetic migration analysis, which permits quantification by clearance of colloidal gold particles within the cell migratory pathway (Fig. 2B). Similarly to the data from the transwell migration assay (Fig. 2A), cells transfected with MMP-9/Myc cDNA displayed enhanced migration as compared with vector-transfected cells determined by NIH ImageJ software (Fig. 2C). Enhanced cell migration did not occur in cells transfected with MMP-9/PEXMMP-2/Myc. These data indicate that homodimerization through the MMP-9 PEX domain plays an important role in MMP-9-induced cell migration. The role of TIMP-1 in interfering with MMP-9 homodimer formation remains controversial (25Goldberg G.I. Strongin A. Collier I.E. Genrich L.T. Marmer B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4583-4591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Olson M.W. Bernardo M.M. Pietila M. Gervasi D.C. Toth M. Kotra L.P. Massova I. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2661-2668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This discrepancy led us to re-evaluate the specific interference of TIMP-1 on pro-MMP-9 homodimer formation using the biochemical approach described above. Because MMP-9 homodimer formation is a prerequisite for enhancing cell migration (Fig. 2A), and TIMP-1 blocks MMP-9-induced cell migration (16Dufour A. Sampson N.S. Zucker S. Cao J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2008; 217: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that binding of TIMP-1 to the PEX domain might prevent pro-MMP-9 homodimerization, thus, interfering with MMP-9-induced cell migration. To test this hypothesis, COS-1 cells transfected with both pro-MMP-9/Myc and pro-MMP-9/HA cDNAs along with TIMP-1 or TIMP-2 cDNAs were examined by the co-immunoprecipitation assay, as described above. As shown in Fig. 3A, co-expression of TIMP-1 with pro-MMP-9 cDNAs resulted in blocking MMP-9 homodimer formation both in the conditioned medium and cell lysate of transfected cells. As demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation studies, abrogation of pro-MMP-9 homodimer formation by TIMP-1 coincided with heterodimer formation between pro-MMP-9 and TIMP-1 (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S1E). In contrast, TIMP-2 has no effect on pro-MMP-9 homodimer formation (Fig. 3A), which is in agreement with previous observations that TIMP-2 only binds to the PEX domain of MMP-2, but not MMP-9 (Fig. 3C) (24Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Tryggvason K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 7414-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Because TIMP-1 was shown to interfere with MMP-9 homodimerization, we then tested if the loss of homodimer formation of MMP-9 by TIMP-1 fails to enhance cell migration. By employing a transwell migration assay, we observed that co-expression of TIMP-1, but not TIMP-2, with pro-MMP-9 in COS-1 cells inhibited pro-MMP-9-enhanced cell migration, but had no apparent effect on pro-MMP9/PEXMMP-2/Myc-transfected cells (Fig. 3D). In addition, both TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 did not significantly inhibit MMP9/PEXMMP-2/Myc enhancement of COS-1 cell migration (Fig. 3D). These results suggest a unique role for TIMP-1 interference of both MMP-9 homodimerization and enhancement of cell migration. The PEX domain of MMPs exhibit similar structures composed of a disc-like shape, with the chain folded into a β-propeller structure that has a pseudo 4-fold symmetry. Each blade contains four anti-parallel β-strands with peptide loops linking one strand to the next as illustrated in Fig. 1B. Based on the crystal structure analysis of purified MMP-9 PEX domain from E. coli (6Cha H. Kopetzki E. Huber R. Lanzendörfer M. Brandstetter H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 1065-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), homodimerization of MMP-9 occurs through an interaction of the outermost strand of the fourth blade of the PEX domains. However, the crystal structure of the MMP-9 PEX domain using the recombinant protein from E. coli has not been completely validated in a mammalian cell system. To test if the interaction interface of MMP-9 homodimer formation occurs through the outermost strand of the fourth blade of the PEX domains in mammalian cells, we employed a genetic approach to generate substituted mutations for the outermost β-strands of each blade within the MMP-9 PEX domain. The outermost β-strand of the fourth blade of the MMP-9/HA PEX domain (688NQVDQVGY695) was substituted by the corresponding region from MMP-2 PEX domain (586KSVKFGS592) to generate MMP-9/IVS4 chimera (Figs. 1A and 4A). As controls, three additional mutations for the outermost strands of blades I, II, and III were engineered by replacing with the corresponding sequence of MMP-2 (MMP-9/IS4, MMP-9/IIS4, and MMP-9/IIIS4) (Fig. 4A).

Although p16 is thought to function as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating the cell cycle, it remains unclear why the genetic compromise of p16 predisposes to melanoma over other cancers. Here we describe a novel role for p16 in regulating oxidative stress in several cell types, including melanocytes. Expression of p16 was rapidly upregulated following ultraviolet-irradiation and in response to H2O2-induced oxidative stress in a p38 stress-activated protein kinase-dependent manner. Knockdown of p16 using small interfering RNA increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative (8-oxoguanine) DNA damage, which was further enhanced by H2O2 treatment. Elevated ROS levels were also observed in p16-depleted human keratinocytes and in whole skin and dermal fibroblasts from Cdkn2a-deficient mice. Aberrant ROS and p38 signaling in Cdkn2a-deficient fibroblasts was normalized by expression of exogenous p16. The effect of p16 depletion on ROS was not recapitulated by the knockdown of retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and did not require Rb. Finally, p16-mediated suppression of ROS could not be attributed to the potential effects of p16 on cell cycle phase. These findings suggest a potential alternate Rb-independent tumor-suppressor function of p16 as an endogenous regulator of carcinogenic intracellular oxidative stress. Compared with keratinocytes and fibroblasts, we also found increased susceptibility of melanocytes to oxidative stress in the context of p16 depletion, which may explain why the compromise of p16 predisposes to melanoma over other cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2158671377,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small, non-coding RNA species functioning as negative regulators of multiple target genes including tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes. Many miRNA gene loci are located within cancer-associated genomic regions. To identify potential new amplified oncogenic and/or deleted tumour suppressing miRNAs in lung cancer, we inferred miRNA gene dosage from high dimensional arrayCGH data. From miRBase v9.0 (http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk), 474 human miRNA genes were physically mapped to regions of chromosomal loss or gain identified from a high-resolution genome-wide arrayCGH study of 132 primary non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) (a training set of 60 squamous cell carcinomas and 72 adenocarcinomas). MiRNAs were selected as candidates if their immediately flanking probes or host gene were deleted or amplified in at least 25% of primary tumours using both Analysis of Copy Errors algorithm and fold change (≥±1.2) analyses. Using these criteria, 97 miRNAs mapped to regions of aberrant copy number. Analysis of three independent published lung cancer arrayCGH datasets confirmed that 22 of these miRNA loci showed directionally concordant copy number variation. MiR-218, encoded on 4p15.31 and 5q35.1 within two host genes (SLIT2 and SLIT3), in a region of copy number loss, was selected as a priority candidate for follow-up as it is reported as underexpressed in lung cancer. We confirmed decreased expression of mature miR-218 and its host genes by qRT-PCR in 39 NSCLCs relative to normal lung tissue. This downregulation of miR-218 was found to be associated with a history of cigarette smoking, but not human papilloma virus. Thus, we show for the first time that putative lung cancer-associated miRNAs can be identified from genome-wide arrayCGH datasets using a bioinformatics mapping approach, and report that miR-218 is a strong candidate tumour suppressing miRNA potentially involved in lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2030426217,"The concept of ""functional selectivity"" or ""biased signaling"" suggests that a ligand can have distinct efficacies with regard to different signaling pathways. We have investigated the question of whether biased signaling may be related to distinct agonist-induced conformational changes in receptors using the β(2)-adrenergic receptor (β(2)AR) and its two endogenous ligands epinephrine and norepinephrine as a model system. Agonist-induced conformational changes were determined in a fluorescently tagged β(2)AR FRET sensor. In this β(2)AR sensor, norepinephrine caused signals that amounted to only ≈50% of those induced by epinephrine and the standard ""full"" agonist isoproterenol. Furthermore, norepinephrine-induced changes in the β(2)AR FRET sensor were slower than those induced by epinephrine (rate constants, 47 versus 128 ms). A similar partial β(2)AR activation signal was revealed for the synthetic agonists fenoterol and terbutaline. However, norepinephrine was almost as efficient as epinephrine (and isoproterenol) in causing activation of G(s) and adenylyl cyclase. In contrast, fenoterol was quite efficient in triggering β-arrestin2 recruitment to the cell surface and its interaction with β(2)AR, as well as internalization of the receptors, whereas norepinephrine caused partial and slow changes in these assays. We conclude that partial agonism of norepinephrine at the β(2)AR is related to the induction of a different active conformation and that this conformation is efficient in signaling to G(s) and less efficient in signaling to β-arrestin2. These observations extend the concept of biased signaling to the endogenous agonists of the β(2)AR and link it to distinct conformational changes in the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2139425516,"The prion protein (PrP(C)) is a conserved glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell surface protein expressed by neurons and other cells. Stress-inducible protein 1 (STI1) binds PrP(C) extracellularly, and this activated signaling complex promotes neuronal differentiation and neuroprotection via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase 1 (PKA) pathways. However, the mechanism by which the PrP(C)-STI1 interaction transduces extracellular signals to the intracellular environment is unknown. We found that in hippocampal neurons, STI1-PrP(C) engagement induces an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) levels. This effect was not detected in PrP(C)-null neurons or wild-type neurons treated with an STI1 mutant unable to bind PrP(C). Using a best candidate approach to test for potential channels involved in Ca(2+) influx evoked by STI1-PrP(C), we found that α-bungarotoxin, a specific inhibitor for α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR), was able to block PrP(C)-STI1-mediated signaling, neuroprotection, and neuritogenesis. Importantly, when α7nAChR was transfected into HEK 293 cells, it formed a functional complex with PrP(C) and allowed reconstitution of signaling by PrP(C)-STI1 interaction. These results indicate that STI1 can interact with the PrP(C)·α7nAChR complex to promote signaling and provide a novel potential target for modulation of the effects of prion protein in neurodegenerative diseases."

Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite that colonizes the gut, and in 10% of infected individuals, causes amebic colitis and liver abscess resulting in 105 deaths/year. E. histolytica-induced host inflammatory responses are critical in the pathogenesis of the disease, yet the host and parasite factors involved in disease are poorly defined.

Intestinal amebiasis is characterized by severe colitis and bloody dysentery. Unfortunately, we know little about the host and parasite factors involved in the sequence of events leading to the pathogenesis of intestinal amebiasis. Most evidence to date suggests that a host response to E. histolytica components (e.g. Gal/GalNAc adherence lectin) following adherence to the epithelium or to inflammatory cells triggers an acute inflammatory response as an initiating factor central to the genesis of disease. Among the potential virulent factors that can play a role in disease are the parasite cysteine proteinases (CPs). Cysteine proteinases are major virulent molecules produced by ameba of which EhCP1, EhCP2, and EhCP5 account for ∼90% of all EhCP transcripts (2Bruchhaus I. Loftus B.J. Hall N. Tannich E.

Caco-2 human colonic cells were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). Secreted proteinases (SPs) were prepared as described previously (4Moncada D. Keller K. Ankri S. Mirelman D. Chadee K. Gastroenterology. 2006; 130: 721-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). E. histolytica cultures deficient in CP5 were a gift from Dr. David Mirelman (Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). NEMO (sc-8330), integrin-linked kinase (ILK), αVβ3, ubiquitin (P4D1), antibody, ILK siRNA (sc-35666, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ILK shRNA (RHS4430-101029656, Open Biosystems), human fibronectin, E64, PD98029, LY294002, and wortmannin were obtained from Sigma. αVβ3 blocking antibody LM609 (16Stockbauer K.E.

GRGDSP and GRADSP peptide were purchased from Calbiochem. EhCP5 was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (pAPlacIQ) using the expression vector pJC45. Recombinant RAD and RGA were mutated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The recombinant protein was expressed as an insoluble histidine-tagged pro-enzyme and was solubilized, purified, and refolded as described elsewhere (17Hellberg A. Nickel R. Lotter H. Tannich E. Bruchhaus I. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Protein purity was >95% as revealed by SDS-PAGE. C57BL/6 wild-type mice were purchased from Charles River, and Muc2−/− of the same background were obtained from Dr. Anna Velcich (Montefiore Medical Center) and bred at the University of Calgary Animal Facilities. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine, and colonic loops were injected with log-phase virulent wild-type trophozoites (106) and pro-mature CP5 (PCP5) or PCP5-RAD (0.7 μg/μl). Sham-challenged mice were injected with 200 μl of the vehicle PBS, and animals were kept on a 37 °C warm plate for 3 h. The colons were excised, and pro-inflammatory gene expression was analyzed by using quantitative real time PCR. All studies were carried out with the approval of the University of Calgary Animal Care Committee. After treatment with various additions, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Lysates were immunoprecipitated for 4 h at 4 °C with the appropriate primary antibody, and protein A/G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added overnight. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (18Hou Y. Gao F. Wang Q. Zhao J. Flagg T. Zhang Y. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9279-9287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In vitro binding of purified αVβ3 (10 nm) integrin protein to PCP5 (1 μm) and mutants (1 μm) lacking the RGD motif was also assessed by co-immunoprecipitation as described previously (13Lechner A.M.

Cells were fixed for 15 min with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, incubated with primary antibodies, and subsequently incubated with secondary antibodies. After the final washing, cells were covered with Permafluor mounting medium. Immunostained cells were viewed on a confocal microscope (Olympus FV 1000 Confocal). Caco-2 cells were co-transfected with NFκB-luc plasmid and pTK-Renilla luciferase plasmid as an internal control (ratio: 1:100) by using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen); 24 h after transfection, cells were treated as indicated. Cell lysates were measured using a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega), and all data were normalized using pTK-Renilla luciferase. Results are expressed as -fold increase over matched controls. Cell attachment assay was performed as described previously (13Lechner A.M. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Zahler S. Stoeckelhuber M. Machleidt W.

Briefly, 96-microwell plates were coated with PCP5, RGD, RAD, fibronectin, and BSA as a control (all at 5 μg/ml) in 100 μl of PBS/well for 18 h at 4 °C. The wells were blocked with 10 mg/ml BSA for 30 min. Subconfluent Caco-2 were detached using trypsin/EDTA and resuspended at 2 × 105 cells/ml in DMEM/F12 containing 1% BSA, and 100 μl of cells were added to each well. Inhibition studies were performed by preincubating Caco-2 cells with αVβ3 antibody (5 μg/ml), GRGDSP (50 μg/ml), and GRADSP (50 μg/ml) for 30 min before addition to the wells. Control cells were treated with BSA (5 μg/ml). The plates were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS, stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 20 min, and washed and dissolved, and cell numbers were quantified by measurement of the optical density at 595 nm in a microplate reader. Total RNA from colon was isolated using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and analyzed by real time PCR with SYBR Green (Qiagen). mRNA expression was normalized against GAPDH. -Fold change over control was determined according to the cycle threshold (Ct) method (19Bas A. Forsberg G. Hammarström S. Hammarström M.L. Scand. J. Immunol. 2004; 59: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). ILK assay was described previously (20Nho R.S. Xia H. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Diebold D. Henke C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26630-26639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Caco-2 cells were treated as indicated. Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with 4 μg of anti-ILK antibody. 1 μg of GSK3β fusion protein (Cell Signaling) was then added to the immunoprecipitated lysate buffer followed by incubation for 30 min at 30 °C. After reaction, 20 μl of SDS sample buffer were added to terminate the reaction. Samples were analyzed by Western analysis with phospho-GSK3β and total GSK3β antibodies. The values for each parameter within a group are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test (when comparing two groups) or analysis of variance with a post hoc test (when comparing more than two groups). Significance was defined as p < 0.05. We have previously shown (4Moncada D. Keller K. Ankri S. Mirelman D. Chadee K. Gastroenterology. 2006; 130: 721-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that the specific cysteine protease inhibitor E64 markedly inhibited mucin degradation by E. histolytica SPs. To determine whether ameba SPs can directly activate colonic cells, we performed a time-dependent study to quantify the activation of NFκB. As shown in Fig. 1A, ameba SPs rapidly induced the ubiquitination of NEMO and the phosphorylation of IκBα (Fig. 1B) even in the presence of the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E64, suggesting that cysteine proteinase enzyme activity was not required for activating NFκB. Phosphorylation of IκBα is catalyzed by IκB kinase (IKK), a complex composed of three subunits, IKKα/IKK1, IKKβ/IKK2, and NEMO/IKKγ. IKK1 and IKK2 are the catalytic subunits, whereas NEMO serves a non-enzymatic, regulatory function (21Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar, 22Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). IKKα and IKKβ are serine/threonine protein kinases, whereas NEMO contains several protein interaction motifs but no apparent catalytic domains (23Miller B.S. Zandi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36320-36326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Genetic studies suggest that NEMO is absolutely required for the activation of IKK and NFκB in response to diverse stimuli (24Nenci A. Becker C. Wullaert A. Gareus R. van Loo G. Danese S. Huth M. Nikolaev A. Neufert C. Madison B. Gumucio D. Neurath M.F. Pasparakis M. Nature. 2007; 446: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 25Tokunaga F. Sakata S. Saeki Y. Satomi Y. Kirisako T.

Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), and ubiquitination of NEMO is required for the activation IKK (26Zhou H. Wertz I. O'Rourke K. Ultsch M. Seshagiri S. Eby M. Xiao W. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 427: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). E. histolytica intrinsic and secreted proteinases contain both PCP5 and mature CP5 (27Nowak N. Lotter H. Tannich E. Bruchhaus I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38260-38266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when ameba was grown in the presence of E64, PCP5 levels were significantly increased (Fig. 1C) as compared with untreated controls. This finding is consistent with a previous report that showed ameba secretes both PCP5 and mature CP5 (27Nowak N. Lotter H. Tannich E. Bruchhaus I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38260-38266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, to elucidate a specific functional role for EhCP5, colonic cells were exposed to secreted proteinases derived from wild-type (WT), amebapore A vector control (AP−/−) or E. histolytica genetically silenced for CP5 (AP/CP−/−) expression. Under these conditions, the WT or vector control (AP−/−) significantly induced the ubiquitination of NEMO, but CP5−/− did not (Fig. 1D). These data clearly show that PCP5 was the critical proteinase involved in activating NFκB and inducing the ubiquitination of NEMO. As inhibition of CP activity did not prevent CP-induced ubiquitination of NEMO and phosphorylation of IκB, we were led to inquire whether CP5 was directly binding and interacting with an epithelial cell surface receptor to activate NFκB. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that PCP5 encodes an RGD motif (92–94 amino acids, Fig. 2A), the peptide motif recognized by integrin receptors, in the pro-domain region upstream toward the carboxyl-terminal end. The RGD motif is also found on EhCP18 and EhCP112 within the catalytic domain; however, these enzymes are not highly expressed or secreted by ameba (3Jacobs T. Bruchhaus I. Dandekar T. Tannich E. Leippe M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Based on this finding, we postulated that PCP5 might function as a ligand with integrin to induce pro-inflammatory responses. αVβ3 integrin is abundantly expressed on Caco-2 cells in culture and colonic epithelial cells and binds RGD motifs (28Croyle M.A. Walter E. Janich S. Roessler B.J. Amidon G.L. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, to determine binding of PCP5 to αVβ3, co-immunoprecipitation studies were done that demonstrated that PCP5 bound αVβ3 integrin on Caco-2 cells (Fig. 2B). However, a single amino acid substitution in the RGD motif where either the aspartate or the glycine residue was substituted by an alanine residue to generate the mutants RAD or RGA, respectively (Fig. 2A), abrogated binding (Fig. 2B). Similarly, Caco-2 cells were pretreated with the GRGDSP peptide that specifically binds integrin (but not to the nonspecific GRADSP peptide), as well as neutralizing antibodies against αVβ3, which markedly inhibited PCP5 binding to αVβ3 integrin. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation of purified recombinant PCP5 alone demonstrated that PCP5 bound to the αVβ3 receptor, whereas the mutants PCP5 RAD and RGA did not (Fig. 2C). As integrin αVβ3 is also expressed on the apical surface of many human cells types including colonic epithelial cells (12Gilcrease M.Z. Cancer Lett. 2007; 247: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), we determined the binging of PCP5 to Caco-2 monolayer. As shown in Fig. 2D, cell attachment analysis revealed that PCP5 bound αVβ3 integrin, whereas the mutants RAD and RGD did not. However, cells pretreated with GRGDSP and αVβ3 antibody inhibited PCP5 binding to αVβ3 integrin. To determine cellular localization of the αVβ3 integrin, Caco-2 cells were exposed with PCP5 and analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. As shown in the merged photomicrograph (Fig. 2E, arrows), PCP5 co-localized with αVβ3 on the surface of the colonic cells. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that PCP5 bound to αVβ3 integrin receptor on colonic cells via the RGD motif. ILK is implicated in the direct phosphorylation of serine 473 of Akt (29Attwell S. Mills J. Troussard A. Wu C. Dedhar S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4813-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). ILK functions downstream of PI3-kinase and promotes the phosphorylation of serine 473 of Akt (30Zhang Y. Guo L. Chen K. Wu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 318-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that E. histolytica can activate the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway, leading to NFκB-mediated pro-inflammatory MCP-1 expression and secretion by inducing the phosphorylation of Akt (31Kammanadiminti S.J. Dey I. Chadee K. Infect Immun. 2007; 75: 1765-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Here we show that PCP5 can induce the phosphorylation of Akt-473 rather than Akt-308 in a dose- and time-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). In particular, PCP5 significantly induced the phosphorylation of Akt-473, whereas the PCP5 mutants RAD and RGA had no effect (Fig. 3A), clearly implicating that the RGD motif is required and essential for PCP5-induced Akt phosphorylation. As predicted, as compared with the control peptide GRADSP, GRGDSP significantly inhibited PCP5-mediated phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 (LY) and wortmannin (WM) significantly abolished PCP5-mediated phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 3C). As activated ILK can phosphorylate the substrate GSK3β in vitro (20Nho R.S. Xia H. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Diebold D. Henke C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26630-26639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), our results show that PCP5 induced ILK activation, whereas the mutants RAD and RGD did not. Moreover, the peptide GRGDSP and neutralizing antibodies against αVβ3 inhibited ILK activation in response to PCP5 (supplemental Fig. S1C). It is well known that ligand coupling through the αVβ3 integrin dependently induces the activation of NFκB (32Urbinati C. Bugatti A. Giacca M. Schlaepfer D. Presta M. Rusnati M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3949-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although PCP5 can significantly induce NFκB activity (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B, Fig. 3D), the RAD and RGA mutants did not (supplemental Fig. S3A). As the GRGDSP peptide can also inhibit PCP5-induced phosphorylation of IκBα (Fig. 3E, supplemental Fig. S3B), this suggests that the RGD motif of PCP5 is essential for PCP5-induced NFκB activity. In support of this, inhibiting the phosphorylation of Akt with LY and WM markedly decreased PCP5-induced phosphorylation of IκBα (Fig. 3F, supplemental Fig. S3C). These results were corroborated by NFκB luciferase activity analysis (Fig. 3, G and H) where PCP5 (or PCP5 treated with polymycin B to remove any potential LPS contaminant) stimulated high NFκB activity. Fibronectin, as a nonspecific ligand for αVβ3 integrin (8Humphries J.D. Byron A. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3901-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar, 33Qwarnström E.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30765-30768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also induced robust NFκB activation in Caco-2 cells (supplemental Fig. S4B). Considering the nonspecific effects of siRNA on ILK (34Verreault M. Bally M.B. Oligonucleotides. 2009; 19: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we silenced ILK using siRNA or shRNA. As shown in supplemental Fig. S4A, silencing ILK reduced PCP5 ILK-mediated phosphorylation of IκBα and the phosphorylation of Akt. These findings clearly show that PCP5 binding to ανβ3 led to the activation of the ILK/Akt/NFκB pathways. Ubiquitination of NEMO is required for NFκB activation (24Nenci A. Becker C. Wullaert A. Gareus R. van Loo G. Danese S. Huth M. Nikolaev A. Neufert C. Madison B. Gumucio D. Neurath M.F. Pasparakis M. Nature. 2007; 446: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 25Tokunaga F.

Infect Immun. 2007; 75: 1765-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Here we found that PCP5 but not the mutants RAD and RGA can rapidly induce the ubiquitination of NEMO (Fig. 4, A and B, supplemental Fig. S5). Akt induces NFκB activity by activating IKK (35Sakurai H. Chiba H. Miyoshi H. Sugita T. Toriumi W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30353-30356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 36Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), and as expected, we show that inhibitors of Akt (LY and WM) abrogated PCP5-induced ubiquitination of NEMO (Fig. 4C). As shown in Fig. 4D, PCP5-induced Akt activation resulted in Akt binding to NEMO, whereas the mutants RAD, RGA, and PCP5, with the addition of the competitor peptide GRGDSP, did not. Under these conditions, the PI3K inhibitors LY and WM completely inhibited PCP5-induced interaction between Akt and NEMO (Fig. 4E). As ILK functions downstream of PI3-kinase and promotes the phosphorylation of Akt (29Attwell S. Mills J. Troussard A. Wu C. Dedhar S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4813-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 30Zhang Y. Guo L. Chen K. Wu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 318-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) as predicted, silencing ILK by siRNA or shRNA abolished PCP5-induced ubiquitination of NEMO, as well as Akt binding to NEMO (Fig. 4, F and G). Taken together, these findings clearly implicate PCP5 binding to αvβ3 integrin, which in turn triggers ILK/Akt/NEMO signaling in colonic epithelial cells. As ameba SPs can induce Akt and NFκB-mediated pro-inflammatory responses (31Kammanadiminti S.J. Dey I. Chadee K. Infect Immun. 2007; 75: 1765-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we determined whether PCP5 coupling through integrin could activate the Akt/NFκB pathway, resulting in pro-inflammatory responses. As shown in Fig. 5A and B, PCP5 induced the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β by Caco-2 cells; however, cells pretreated with αvβ3 antibody, GRGDSP, or Akt inhibitor abolished PCP5-induced pro-inflammatory responses. To determine whether a similar response occurred in vivo, we used an animal model of the disease and demonstrated that wild-type mice colons infected with live highly virulent E. histolytica trophozoites or challenged with purified PCP5 stimulated robust TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and Cox-2 gene expression (Fig. 6, A–D). In parallel, mice infected with CP5−/− ameba or inoculated with the RAD-PCP5 mutant could not mimic the effect of virulent E. histolytica or PCP5 (Fig. 6, A–D). As ameba CPs have high enzyme activity against Muc2 mucin substrates (37Lidell M.E. Moncada D.M. Chadee K. Hansson G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 9298-9303Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), which can substantiality affect PCP5 binding to ανβ3 integrin receptor on colonic cells, studies were done in Muc2−/− mice, which are deficient for the major structural component of colonic mucus, to facilitate direct binding of PCP5 to the surface of the epithelium. Surprisingly, in Muc2−/− mice, pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expressions were significantly up-regulated in response to PCP5 but not to the mutant RAD as compared with WT mice with an intact mucus barrier (Fig. 6, E–H). These results suggest that loss of Muc2 mucin mucosal barrier protective function led to enhanced interaction of PCP5 with the integrin receptor on colonic cells (Fig. 5). Moreover, Muc2−/− mice colons pretreated with blocking αvβ3 integrin antibody significantly inhibited E. histolytica-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression (supplemental Fig. S6, A–D), suggesting that the αvβ3 integrin pathway is critically involved in E. histolytica-mediated pro-inflammatory responses.FIGURE 6PCP5 induces pro-inflammatory responses in mouse colon.

Future Microbiol. 2009; 4: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this study, we have revealed a novel role for integrins in the pathogenesis of E. histolytica, making ανβ3 integrin the first human receptor to be exploited by a colonic mucosal parasite. Our findings support an intriguing mechanism by which the PCP5 RGD motif can bind ανβ3 integrin to trigger integrin/NFκB signaling that elicits pro-inflammatory cytokine production. E. histolytica cysteine proteinases are key virulence factors involved in pathogenesis (3Jacobs T. Bruchhaus I. Dandekar T. Tannich E. Leippe M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 4Moncada D. Keller K. Ankri S. Mirelman D. Chadee K. Gastroenterology. 2006; 130: 721-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Trophozoites secrete both pro-mature CP5 and mature CP5 (27Nowak N. Lotter H. Tannich E. Bruchhaus I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38260-38266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). CP5-deficient trophozoites are known to inflict less gut inflammation and damage to the intestinal barrier and are incapable of inducing amebic liver abscesses (39Ankri S. Stolarsky T. Mirelman D. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, it was not surprising to find that E. histolytica genetically deficient in CP5 production elicited significantly less NFκB activation and pro-inflammatory responses, reinforcing the notion that CP5 is an important virulence factor. Importantly, as both pro-mature CP5 and mature CP5 are secreted, it was critical to determine which form of the enzyme was essential for activating NFκB-mediated pro-inflammatory responses. With the use of the specific CP5 enzyme inhibitor E64 to abolish CP5 enzyme activity, we were intrigued that it had no effect on PCP5-mediated NFκB activation, suggesting that PCP5 may activate NFκB. Although previous studies have shown that inhibiting cysteine proteinase activity decreases E. histolytica-induced liver abscess formation, it is important to note that only E64-resistant ameba cultures, rather than wild-type ameba cultured with E64, had a significant effect on liver abscess formation (27Nowak N. Lotter H. Tannich E. Bruchhaus I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38260-38266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As E64-resistant E. histolytica cultures have significantly decreased CP5 gene expression (27Nowak N. Lotter H. Tannich E. Bruchhaus I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38260-38266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), this finding demonstrates precedence of CP5 as a virulent factor for E. histolytica. Interestingly, our results show that the pro-mature form, PCP5, is also an important virulent factor, and in this regard, this is the first report to ascribe a functional role for PCP5. These findings also explain why E. histolytica cultured with E64 cannot inhibit liver abscess formation (27Nowak N. Lotter H. Tannich E. Bruchhaus I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38260-38266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) as CP5 enzyme activity is not required for the NFκB-mediated pro-inflammatory responses that potentiate amebic liver abscess formation (reviewed in 38Lejeune M. Rybicka J.M. Chadee K. Future Microbiol. 2009; 4: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that PCP5 encodes an RGD motif, which is known to interact with ανβ3 integrin to activate NFκB (31Kammanadiminti S.J. Dey I. Chadee K. Infect Immun. 2007; 75: 1765-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Other integrins including α3β1, α5β1, α8β1, αVβ3, and αVβ1 can recognize ligands containing an RGD tripeptide active site (8Humphries J.D. Byron A. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3901-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). Although αVβ3 integrins are abundantly expressed on Caco-2 and colonic epithelial cells (28Croyle M.A. Walter E. Janich S. Roessler B.J. Amidon G.L. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we cannot exclude the possibility that PCP5 may bind other integrins and have a functional role. Our results show that the RGD motif was required for PCP5-mediated NFκB activation by inducing ubiquitination of NEMO. NEMO is the regulatory subunit of the IKKα-IKKβ complex, which, predominantly acting through IKKβ, phosphorylates IκBs that sequester NFκB in the cytoplasm. This phosphorylation event signals IκB ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and thereby, the release of NFκB into the nucleus, where it activates pro-inflammatory gene expression. This pathway of NFκB activation is dependent on NEMO as pro-inflammatory signal-induced NFκB activity is completely blocked in NEMO-deficient cells but only partially affected in IKK2/β-deficient cells (40Schmidt C. Peng B. Li Z. Sclabas G.M. Fujioka S. Niu J. Schmidt-Supprian M. Evans D.B. Abbruzzese J.L. Chiao P.J. Mol.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1729-1733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ILK has been implicated in direct phosphorylation of Akt serine 473 (29Attwell S. Mills J. Troussard A. Wu C. Dedhar S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4813-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and functions downstream of PI3-kinase in promoting phosphorylation of Akt serine 473 (30Zhang Y. Guo L. Chen K. Wu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 318-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that proteins secreted by virulent E. histolytica activate the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway, leading to NFκB-mediated pro-inflammatory MCP-1 expression, by inducing Akt phosphorylation at serine 308 (30Zhang Y. Guo L. Chen K. Wu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 318-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Here we found that PCP5 had no effect on the phosphorylation of Akt308. Unexpectedly, high concentrations of PCP5 (>500 μg/ml) decreased the phosphorylation of Akt473 and IκBα in a time-dependent fashion, suggesting that PCP5 may function within a narrow range, but this is only speculation. Silencing ILK abolished ILK-mediated phosphorylation of Akt 473. These data suggest that PCP5 integrin binding activated the ILK/Akt pathway and activated NFκB. The Akt/IKK pathway is known to mediate cell survival (35Sakurai H. Chiba H. Miyoshi H. Sugita T. Toriumi W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30353-30356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 36Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell.

Infect Immun. 2007; 75: 1765-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); however, it is still unclear how Akt induces the activation of NEMO and activates downstream NFκB signaling. Our results show that Akt bound to NEMO and caused NEMO to be ubiquitinated and that NEMO ubiquitination in turn led to the activation of IKK and subsequent activation of NFκB. These results not only clarify the mechanism whereby PCP5 activates NFκB but also provide a novel mechanism of Akt interaction with NEMO. Activation of the NFκB family mediates inflammation (42Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar, 43Ben-Neriah Y. Schmidt-Supprian M. Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 479-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, it was not surprising that PCP5 significantly induced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion (TNF-α and IL-1β) in human colonic cells. More importantly, mice colons challenged with wild-type virulent E. histolytica trophozoites and recombinant PCP5 induced robust pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression (TNF-α, IL-1β, Cox-2, and IL-6), whereas CP5−/− deficient trophozoites and a RAD-PCP5 mutant elicited a greatly reduced pro-inflammatory response. We have previously shown that CP5 has high enzyme activity against MUC2 colonic mucin (37Lidell M.E. Moncada D.M. Chadee K. Hansson G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 9298-9303Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), which can substantially prevent CP5 from engaging epithelial cell integrin in the colon. Accordingly, studies done in Muc2−/− mice showed a significant increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression as compared with wild-type mice, clearly implicating that loss of the protective mucus barrier led to enhanced interaction of PCP5 with the epithelial integrin receptor. This study substantiates our hypothesis that secreted CP5/PCP5 can exert multiple functions in the gut lumen by first exhibiting enzyme activity against mucin and that only when the luminal barrier is compromised can PCP5 bind integrin on colonic cells via the RGD motif. This stepwise mode of action for PCP5 in the pathogenesis of intestinal amebiasis seems the most likely scenario. Taken together, initiation of host pro-inflammatory responses through PCP5 binding to αvβ3 integrin on colonic cells via the activation of the ILK/Akt/NEMO pathway provides novel insights into the molecular basis of E. histolytica-induced intestinal inflammation, the central event involved in instigating amebic colitis.

https://openalex.org/W2118540702,"Deforestation and forest fragmentation are known major causes of nonrandom extinction, but there is no information about their impact on the phylogenetic diversity of the remaining species assemblages. Using a large vegetation dataset from an old hyper-fragmented landscape in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest we assess whether the local extirpation of tree species and functional impoverishment of tree assemblages reduce the phylogenetic diversity of the remaining tree assemblages. We detected a significant loss of tree phylogenetic diversity in forest edges, but not in core areas of small (<80 ha) forest fragments. This was attributed to a reduction of 11% in the average phylogenetic distance between any two randomly chosen individuals from forest edges; an increase of 17% in the average phylogenetic distance to closest non-conspecific relative for each individual in forest edges; and to the potential manifestation of late edge effects in the core areas of small forest remnants. We found no evidence supporting fragmentation-induced phylogenetic clustering or evenness. This could be explained by the low phylogenetic conservatism of key life-history traits corresponding to vulnerable species. Edge effects must be reduced to effectively protect tree phylogenetic diversity in the severely fragmented Brazilian Atlantic forest."
https://openalex.org/W1982521321,"Many cancer cells contain more than two centrosomes, which imposes a potential for multipolar mitoses, leading to cell death. To circumvent this, cancer cells develop mechanisms to cluster supernumerary centrosomes to form bipolar spindles, enabling successful mitosis. Disruption of centrosome clustering thus provides a selective means of killing supernumerary centrosome-harboring cancer cells. Although the mechanisms of centrosome clustering are poorly understood, recent genetic analyses have identified requirements for both actin and tubulin regulating proteins. In this study, we demonstrate that the integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a protein critically involved in actin and mitotic microtubule organization, is required for centrosome clustering. Inhibition of ILK expression or activity inhibits centrosome clustering in several breast and prostate cancer cell lines that have centrosome amplification. Furthermore, cancer cells with supernumerary centrosomes are significantly more sensitive to ILK inhibition than cells with two centrosomes, demonstrating that inhibiting ILK offers a selective means of targeting cancer cells. Live cell analysis shows ILK perturbation leads cancer cells to undergo multipolar anaphases, mitotic arrest and cell death in mitosis. We also show that ILK performs its centrosome clustering activity in a focal adhesion-independent, but centrosome-dependent, manner through the microtubule regulating proteins TACC3 and ch-TOG. In addition, we identify a specific TACC3 phosphorylation site that is required for centrosome clustering and demonstrate that ILK regulates this phosphorylation in an Aurora-A-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1972960316,"PTK7 is an essential component of the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. We provide evidence that the Wnt/PCP pathway converges with pericellular proteolysis in both normal development and cancer. Here, we demonstrate that membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), a key proinvasive proteinase, functions as a principal sheddase of PTK7. MT1-MMP directly cleaves the exposed PKP621↓LI sequence of the seventh Ig-like domain of the full-length membrane PTK7 and generates, as a result, an N-terminal, soluble PTK7 fragment (sPTK7). The enforced expression of membrane PTK7 in cancer cells leads to the actin cytoskeleton reorganization and the inhibition of cell invasion. MT1-MMP silencing and the analysis of the uncleavable L622D PTK7 mutant confirm the significance of MT1-MMP proteolysis of PTK7 in cell functions. Our data also demonstrate that a fine balance between the metalloproteinase activity and PTK7 levels is required for normal development of zebrafish (Danio rerio). Aberration of this balance by the proteinase inhibition or PTK7 silencing results in the PCP-dependent convergent extension defects in the zebrafish. Overall, our data suggest that the MT1-MMP-PTK7 axis plays an important role in both cancer cell invasion and normal embryogenesis in vertebrates. Further insight into these novel mechanisms may promote understanding of directional cell motility and lead to the identification of therapeutics to treat PCP-related developmental disorders and malignancy.

PCP governs the orientation of cells in a monolayer of a tissue plane (front-back orientation) in such a way that all cells within the monolayer are aligned in the same direction. As a result, PCP is important for the directed collective cell movements and orchestrates the synchronized cell arrangements within the tissue plane in the course of a plethora of biological processes (2Schlessinger K.

CE failure results in the multiple severe developmental defects, including a shortened body axis (dwarfism), defective neural system, and craniofacial abnormalities. Defects in the non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway are linked to a broad range of diseases, including cancer (3Simons M. Mlodzik M. Annu. Rev.

Wnt5a, Wnt5b, and Wnt11, which work through the non-canonical pathway, are often up-regulated in cancer and promote cancer cell motility and invasion (6Wang Y. Mol.

MT1-MMP cleaves ECM proteins, initiates activation of soluble MMPs, and controls the functionality of cell adhesion and signaling receptors. MT1-MMP is a prototypic member of a membrane-anchored MMP subfamily and is distinguished from soluble MMPs by a C-terminal transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail (29Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev.

Once activated, MT1-MMP can be inhibited by its physiological inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases-2, -3, and -4 (TIMP-2, -3, and -4). In contrast, TIMP-1 is a poor inhibitor of MT1-MMP (34Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B. Murphy G. J. Biol.

Both transcriptional silencing and enforced overexpression of MT1-MMP negatively impacted CE and craniofacial morphogenesis in zebrafish, suggesting that a stringent control of MT1-MMP activity is essential in normal development (27Coyle R.C.

The molecular mechanisms involved in the MT1-MMP-dependent regulation of the non-canonical Wnt/PCP signaling pathway, however, remain elusive. Intriguingly, co-expression data of 19,777 human and 21,036 mouse genes from the COEXPRESdb database indicate that MT1-MMP and PTK7 are closely co-expressed.Here, we provide evidence that the full-length membrane PTK7 affects actin cytoskeleton and inhibits cancer cell invasion. Our results demonstrate that MT1-MMP directly cleaves the full-length membrane PTK7, that this cleavage generates the sPTK7 species, and, most importantly, that this proteolytic event is ubiquitous in multiple cell systems. Taken together, our experimental data suggest that the pericellular proteolysis and PCP mechanisms converge in the regulation of directional cell migration and that they work in concert in processes as diverse as embryogenesis and malignancy.DISCUSSIONThe importance of receptor shedding by MT1-MMP is well documented in cancer (56Suenaga N.

Our proteomics studies identified cellular PTK7 pseudokinase as a primary cleavage target of MT1-MMP and as a link to the Wnt/PCP pathway. Our subsequent studies confirmed that the full-length membrane PTK7 is most efficiently targeted by MT1-MMP, especially when compared with other receptors, including CD44. Cellular MT1-MMP functions as a principal sheddase of PTK7 and directly cleaves the exposed PKP621↓LI sequence of the seventh Ig-like domain of the full-length membrane PTK7. MT1-MMP proteolysis generates the C-terminal, membrane-tethered (50-kDa) and the N-terminal, soluble (70-kDa) fragments of PTK7. In turn, inactivation of the cleavage site generates the uncleavable PTK7 mutant (L622D) that is resistant to MT1-MMP proteolysis.Because PTK7 is an essential component of the Wnt/PCP pathway, we analyzed the effect of the full-length membrane PTK7 and sPTK7 on the actin cytoskeleton, a downstream target of the Wnt/PCP signaling. The precise molecular mechanism of PTK7 signaling leading to the regulation of the actomyosin contraction is not yet understood; however, either Dishevelled (Dsh) or plexins may be interacting partners of PTK7 (14Shnitsar I. Borchers A. Development. 2008; 135: 4015-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 74Whitford K.L. Ghosh A.

Neuron. 2001; 32: 53-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).The availability of the cells transfected with the full-length, soluble, and uncleavable L622D PTK7 constructs allowed us to demonstrate that PTK7 affects the downstream events of the Wnt/PCP pathway and that the membrane full-length PTK7 and especially the uncleavable L622D mutant reorganize the actin cytoskeleton, repress the MLC phosphorylation, alter the actomyosin contraction, and inhibit cancer cell invasion. MT1-MMP silencing recapitulates the effects that are observed in the cells with the enforced expression of the L622D PTK7 mutant. Consistently, MT1-MMP proteolysis reverses the effects of the full-length PTK7 on cell functions.The enforced expression of sPTK7 in HT1080 cells, however, significantly up-regulated RhoA activation, the upstream event of the Wnt/PCP pathway, rather than the downstream pMLC and actin reorganization. It is likely that the high preexisting levels of pMLC in the highly migratory HT1080 cells make any further increase of these parameters nearly impossible. As a result, the expression of MT1-MMP alone does not cause a noticeable effect on RhoA. In agreement, Rho-ROCK-myosin signaling mediates MT1-MMP-induced cellular aggregation of keratinocytes, but the overexpression of MT1-MMP itself does not result in a readily detectable increase of RhoA activation (76Dangi-Garimella S.

MT1-MMP and Rho-ROCK activity and MLC phosphorylation were also demonstrated to play an important role in podosome formation and cell migration (16Lu X. Borchers A.G. Jolicoeur C. Rayburn H.

Signal. 2006; 18: 359-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27Coyle R.C. Latimer A. Jessen J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 2150-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 79Marlow F. Topczewski J. Sepich D. Solnica-Krezel L. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 876-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Conversely, MT1-MMP silencing affected pMLC more noticeably, especially if compared with RhoA. Evidently, the effects of the multifunctional MT1-MMP on the net levels of pMLC and RhoA in the highly migratory HT1080 cells are more complex (80Lincoln T.M. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) than the MT1-MMP/PTK7 interactions alone and involve multiple parameters that are additional and distinct from PTK7.Because of the presence of the link between PTK7 and MT1-MMP that we detected in cancer cells, we investigated the role of the PTK7/MT1-MMP axis in embryogenesis using the zebrafish (D. rerio) developmental model. Our results suggest that zebrafish PTK7 is already expressed as early as 6 h postfertilization and that PTK7 is present at the right time during gastrulation to govern CE in the zebrafish embryo. Both transcriptional silencing of PTK7 and inhibition of MT1-MMP activity, either by small molecule inhibitors or by transcriptional silencing, led to characteristic CE abnormalities, including a short anterior-posterior body axis (dwarfism) and a wide lateral axis in the zebrafish. In agreement, subthreshold dosages of MT1-MMP and PTK7 morpholinos together caused a synergistic effect on the CE phenotype and the developmental abnormalities in zebrafish.Regardless of the opposing effect of PTK7 morpholino and small molecule MMP inhibitors on the levels of the full-length membrane PTK7, these treatments resulted in similar CE defects in the zebrafish embryos. It appears that both in cancer cells and normal embryogenesis, not the level of membrane PTK7 alone but also the well balanced ratio of the full-length PTK7 to sPTK7 plays an important role in regulating the overall effect of this pseudokinase on cell functions. In agreement, according to the findings of others, both overexpression and silencing of MT1-MMP resulted in a similar CE phenotype in zebrafish (27Coyle R.C. Latimer A. Jessen J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 2150-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 45Zhang J. Bai S. Zhang X. Nagase H. Sarras Jr., M.P. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data suggest that the MT1-MMP/PTK7 axis plays an important role in normal embryogenesis in the course of gastrulation in zebrafish.Our data in zebrafish correlate well with the role PTK7 plays in polarized cell motility and CE during mouse gastrulation (15Yen W.W. Williams M. Periasamy A. Conaway M. Burdsal C. Keller R. Lu X. Sutherland A. Development. 2009; 136: 2039-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, in embryos mutant for PTK7, the CE is severely affected. Although there is no alternative splicing in the murine PTK7 gene (18Jung J.W. Shin W.S. Song J. Lee S.T. Gene. 2004; 328: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the presence of the full-length, 140-kDa PTK7 and a PTK7 fragment that is similar to the sPTK7 species was reported in mice (16Lu X. Borchers A.G. Jolicoeur C. Rayburn H. Baker J.C. Tessier-Lavigne M. Nature. 2004; 430: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Most excitingly, very recently an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mutant, named chuzhoi (chz), has been reported in mice (44Paudyal A. Damrau C. Patterson V.L. Ermakov A. Formstone C. Lalanne Z. Wells S. Lu X. Norris D.P. Dean C.H. Henderson D.J. Murdoch J.N. BMC Dev. Biol. 2010; 10: 87Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The chz mutation resulted in the insertion of three amino acids (Ala-Asn-Pro) into the junction region between the fifth and the sixth Ig-like domains of PTK7. The Ala-Asn-Pro insertion did not change the membrane PTK7 levels in mice but led to the degradation of the sPTK7 species. The resulting imbalance between membrane PTK7 and sPTK7 led to characteristics consistent with defective CE, including a shortened body axis and multiple defects in heart, lung, and inner ear development. These observations agree very well with our results that we generated in cancer cells and zebrafish.As a result, we believe that a fine balance between the protease and PTK7 is required for normal embryo development. In general, it is now highly likely that the MT1-MMP/PTK7 axis plays an essential role in embryogenesis in the course of gastrulation in vertebrates. Conversely, aberrations of the MT1-MMP/PTK7 axis seem to be the cause of abnormal CE during gastrulation in vertebrates.ConclusionsOverall, we established that the full-length PTK7 down-regulates myosin light chain phosphorylation, actin cytoskeleton organization, and actomyosin contraction (all downstream events in the Wnt/PCP pathway) and that it strongly inhibits cell invasion. PTK7 is a major cleavage target of MT1-MMP in the plasma membrane. MT1-MMP directly cleaves the PKP621↓LI sequence in an exposed region of PTK7, generating the N-terminal, soluble PTK7 ectodomain. The latter forms a complex with the full-length membrane PTK7. MT1-MMP proteolysis reverses the inhibitory action of the full-length PTK on cell locomotion. MT1-MMP silencing and the analysis of the uncleavable L622D PTK7 mutant also confirm the significance of MT1-MMP proteolysis of PTK7 in cell functions. Our novel data suggest that the MT1-MMP/PTK7 axis plays an important role in the regulation of the non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway and polarized cell motility both in malignancy and vertebrate embryo development. Our results bring us a step closer to the development of selective therapeutics to target the MT1-MMP/PTK7 axis and the Wnt/PCP pathway in a clinically beneficial manner.

https://openalex.org/W2081905878,"It is increasingly recognised that traits associated with autism reflect a spectrum with no clear boundary between typical and atypical behaviour. Dimensional traits are needed to investigate the broader autism phenotype.Ninety-three individual measures reflecting components of social, communication and repetitive behaviours characterising autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) were identified between the ages of 6 months and 9 years from the ALSPAC database. Using missing value imputation, data for 13,138 children were analysed. Factor analysis suggested the existence of 7 factors explaining 85% of the variance. The factors were labelled: verbal ability, language acquisition, social understanding, semantic-pragmatic skills, repetitive-stereotyped behaviour, articulation and social inhibition. Four factors (1, 3, 5 and 7) were specific to ASD being more strongly associated with this phenotype than other co-morbid conditions while other factors were more associated with learning difficulties and specific language impairment. Nevertheless, all 7 factors contributed independently to the explanation of ASD (p<0.001). Exploration of putative genetic causal factors such as variants in the CNTNAP2 gene showed a varying pattern of associations with these traits. An alternative predictive model of ASD was derived using four individual measures: the coherence subscale of the Children's Communication Checklist (9y), the Social and Communication Disorders Checklist (91 m), repetitive behaviour (69 m) and the sociability subscale of the Emotionality Activity and Sociability measure (38 m). Although univarably these traits performed better than some factors, their combined explanations of ASD were similar (R(2) = 0.48).These results support the fractional nature of ASD with different aetiological origins for these components despite pleiotropic genetic effects being observed. These traits are likely to be useful in the exploration of ASD."
https://openalex.org/W2081157483,"Vacuolar H(+)-ATPases (V-ATPases) are highly expressed in ruffled borders of bone-resorbing osteoclasts, where they play a crucial role in skeletal remodeling. To discover protein-protein interactions with the a subunit in mammalian V-ATPases, a GAL4 activation domain fusion library was constructed from an in vitro osteoclast model, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand-differentiated RAW 264.7 cells. This library was screened with a bait construct consisting of a GAL4 binding domain fused to the N-terminal domain of V-ATPase a3 subunit (NTa3), the a subunit isoform that is highly expressed in osteoclasts (a1 and a2 are also expressed, to a lesser degree, whereas a4 is kidney-specific). One of the prey proteins identified was the V-ATPase B2 subunit, which is also highly expressed in osteoclasts (B1 is not expressed). Further characterization, using pulldown and solid-phase binding assays, revealed an interaction between NTa3 and the C-terminal domains of both B1 and B2 subunits. Dual B binding domains of equal affinity were observed in NTa, suggesting a possible model for interaction between these subunits in the V-ATPase complex. Furthermore, the a3-B2 interaction appeared to be moderately favored over a1, a2, and a4 interactions with B2, suggesting a mechanism for the specific subunit assembly of plasma membrane V-ATPase in osteoclasts. Solid-phase binding assays were subsequently used to screen a chemical library for inhibitors of the a3-B2 interaction. A small molecule benzohydrazide derivative was found to inhibit osteoclast resorption with an IC(50) of ∼1.2 μm on both synthetic hydroxyapatite surfaces and dentin slices, without significantly affecting RAW 264.7 cell viability or receptor activator of NF-κB ligand-mediated osteoclast differentiation. Further understanding of these interactions and inhibitors may contribute to the design of novel therapeutics for bone loss disorders, such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis."

Because of their high negative charge, HS chains interact with a variety of proteins, including growth factors/morphogens and their receptors, the amyloid precursor protein serum amyloid protein A (AA), chemokines, and extracellular matrix proteins. HS-protein interactions vary with regard to specificity and may depend on charge density in addition to strict sequence motifs of HS.The interaction of heparin and HS with FGFs and their receptors has been characterized in great detail. Specific HS structures are predominantly determined by the regulated positioning of N-, 2-, 6-, and 3-O-sulfate groups along HS chains (1Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). For example, FGF-2 requires both N- and 2-O-sulfate groups for binding to HS. The 6-O-sulfate group is not essential for binding to FGF-2 but is critical for activation of the FGF receptor (2Nakato H. Kimata K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In contrast, binding of hepatocyte growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, lipoprotein lipase, and herpes simplex virus glycoprotein C to HS is dependent on 6-O-sulfation (3Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The activation of antithrombin III by HS/heparin is mediated by a specific pentasaccharide in which a 3-O-sulfate group is crucial (4Rosenberg R.D. Shworak N.W. Liu J. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2062-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Thus, the biological functions of HSPGs are controlled by biosynthetic events that define HS structures.Although it is increasingly recognized that a specific domain structure, typically from a tetra- to a decasaccharide in size, is responsible for HS modulation of biological activity, in only a few cases is there any structural information regarding sequences (3Lindahl U.

This impedes the assignment of specific HS motifs/sequences to biological and pathological phenomena.Here, we report on the selection, characterization, and biological application of a novel phage display-derived antibody, NS4F5. The antibody reacts with a specific stretch of highly sulfated GlcNS6S-IdoA2S disaccharides (HSNS4F5) that is common in heparin but that exhibits a very restricted distribution in HS in healthy tissues. To study the cell biological relevance of this HSNS4F5 motif, we used the antibody as a blocking agent and showed that in vitro it inhibits cell proliferation, sensitizes cells to apoptosis, but does not affect cell attachment to collagen I. Increased expression of HSNS4F5 by activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) contributed to leukocyte adhesion. The HSNS4F5 motif was highly up-regulated in human ovarian cancer. We further observed in mice the presence of this motif in visceral AA amyloid deposits with little or no reactivity of the antibody in healthy, amyloid-free tissues. Using labeled NS4F5 antibodies, amyloid deposits could be visualized by single photon emission computed tomography. Our studies provide new insight into the distribution and function of a specific HS motif (GlcNS6S-IdoA2S)3 and show that in addition to mediating cellular behavior it represents a novel biomarker of amyloid disease and possibly ovarian tumors. Taken together, the ability to identify specific HS structures with unique antibodies will accelerate our understanding of the relevance of polysaccharide structures to the regulation of biological functions.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we describe the selection, characterization, and application of a novel phage display-derived anti-HS antibody NS4F5. NS4F5 defines HSNS4F5, a specific stretch of highly sulfated disaccharides (GlcNS6S-IdoA2S)3, which is common in heparin (29Conrad H.E. Heparin-binding Proteins. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 1-5Crossref Google Scholar) and very rare in HS, and has a restricted distribution in healthy tissues. NS4F5 was used as a blocking agent to study the biological relevance of HSNS4F5, and it was demonstrated that binding of NS4F5 to HSNS4F5 reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis but did not alter cell attachment. Moreover, we showed an important contribution of HSNS4F5 on endothelium to leukocytes adhesion. These findings provide new insights into the function of a specific HS motif and reiterate the importance of HS sequences (or more specifically, HS with very high charge densities (30Kreuger J. Spillmann D. Li J.P. Lindahl U. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar)) in cellular behavior.The chemical heterogeneity of HS, coupled with the lack of appropriate tools to study the fine structure of HS, has seriously limited the investigations into the roles of HS in biological phenomena. Using phage display technology, we have generated a large panel of epitope-specific antibodies against HS (6Jenniskens G.J. Oosterhof A. Brandwijk R. Veerkamp J.H. van Kuppevelt T.H. J.

Although these antibodies are unique in their preference for specific modification patterns on HS molecules (i.e. 2-O, 6-O, and 3-O sulfation and/or epimerization) (6Jenniskens G.J. Oosterhof A.

Jesudason E.C. Losty P.D. van de Westerlo E.M. van Kuppevelt T.H. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35621-35631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). NS4F5 is the first antibody for which the saccharide sequence motif has been determined precisely. Knowing the specificity of NS4F5 renders it a powerful tool to investigate the expression, localization, and functional role of this specific HSNS4F5 structure in cell biological phenomena.HS-protein interactions have recently attracted much interest, and it is now widely recognized that HS is a modulator of certain protein functions (32Lindahl U. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2007; 98: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). HS-protein interactions vary with regard to specificity and often seem to depend on specific HS motifs, the degree of sulfation being of major importance (10Ten Dam G.B. Kurup S. van de Westerlo E.M. Versteeg E.M. Lindahl U. Spillmann D. van Kuppevelt T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4654-4662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For instance, the binding of both FGF-2 and VEGF164 depends on the sulfation state of HS, as does, for example, the process of tumor cell proliferation (33Fuster M.M. Esko J.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 526-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar).The finding that HSNS4F5 is up-regulated in tumors indicates that, in contrast to healthy tissue, a hypersulfated HS structure is present in the tumors. An enormous diversity of HS sequences is possible (34Gallagher J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), and considerable variation has been documented in normal adult tissues (7Dennissen M.A. Jenniskens G.J. Pieffers M. Versteeg E.M. Petitou M. Veerkamp J.H. van Kuppevelt T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10982-10986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). HS chains are dynamically regulated during development and tumorigenesis (35Brickman Y.G. Ford M.D. Gallagher J.T. Nurcombe V. Bartlett P.F. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4350-4359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 36Jayson G.C. Vives C. Paraskeva C. Schofield K. Coutts J. Fleetwood A. Gallagher J.T. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 82: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), consistent with regulatory changes in the binding of signaling molecules. Considerable interest therefore exists in the mechanisms that generate diversity in HS chains. Up-regulation of HSNS4F5 in ovarian tumors could be mechanistically critical for the growth of tumors. Because a myriad of extracellular events are influenced by HS interactions with growth factors, morphogens, cell adhesion molecules, and so forth (37Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar), we can foresee other mechanisms by which cancer cells could exploit the activity of HSNS4F5. Given that expression of HSNS4F5 is undetectable in normal ovarian surface epithelium, compared with ovarian tumor tissue, these observations raise the possibility that ovarian HS serves different roles in normal epithelium compared with tumor cells. In this light, it is highly possible that HSNS4F5 could be used as a biomarker for ovarian tumor cells. Further study of HSNS4F5 and its role in tumor progression is clearly warranted.HSPGs are intimately associated with pathological amyloid deposits such as those found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease and peripherally in patients with chronic inflammatory disorders and plasma cell dyscrasias (38Kisilevsky R. Ancsin J.B. Szarek W.A. Petanceska S. Amyloid. 2007; 14: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 39Ancsin J.B. Amyloid. 2003; 10: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The deposition of amyloid fibrils is preceded by the up-regulation of HSPG synthesis; indeed, in the absence of sulfated GAGs, amyloid deposition does not occur (40Li J.P. Galvis M.L. Gong F. Zhang X. Zcharia E. Metzger S. Vlodavsky I. Kisilevsky R. Lindahl U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 6473-6477Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The serum AA precursor protein has an HS binding motif, and following binding the serum AA protein undergoes a conformational change that results in an increase in the β-sheet content of the protein (41McCubbin W.D. Kay C.M. Narindrasorasak S. Kisilevsky R. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This interaction therefore renders the serum AA protein in a pro-amyloid form and is a critical step in the process of amyloid deposition. The precise structures of the saccharides in the amyloid-associated HS are not known, but it has been shown that they are structurally distinct from HS isolated from healthy tissues (42Lindahl B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26091-26094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Binding of NS4F5 to amyloid deposits indicates that amyloid contains hypersulfated HSNS4F5, confirming previous observations that HS in amyloid is distinct from most HS in healthy tissues (19Solomon A. Weiss D.T. Schell M. Hrncic R. Murphy C.L. Wall J. McGavin M.D. Pan H.J. Kabalka G.W. Paulus M.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1267-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The restricted distribution of HSNS4F5 renders it a potential biomarker of amyloidosis, which can be targeted using novel imaging and therapeutic reagents. The observation that, in vivo, phage display-derived anti-HS antibodies specifically home to their saccharide epitope holds great promise for their diagnostic and therapeutic applications.The biological function of HSNS4F5 is in line with previous work on the effect of sulfation on cellular behavior. HS 6-O-endosulfatase, an enzyme that removes 6-O-sulfate groups from sulfated HS motifs, resulted in decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of breast cancer cells (43Hossain M.M. Hosono-Fukao T. Tang R. Sugaya N. van Kuppevelt T.H. Jenniskens G.J. Kimata K. Rosen S.D. Uchimura K. Glycobiology. 2010; 20: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Likewise, highly sulfated HS fragments, derived from a melanoma cell line and prepared by heparin lyase III digestion, decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, whereas low sulfated HS fragments, prepared by heparin lyase I had the opposite effect (44Liu D. Shriver Z. Venkataraman G. El Shabrawi Y. Sasisekharan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 568-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recently we have identified other, distinct HS motifs that also contribute to leukocyte trafficking (28Rops A.L. van den Hoven M.J. Baselmans M.M. Lensen J.F. Wijnhoven T.J. van den Heuvel L.P. van Kuppevelt T.H. Berden J.H. van der Vlag J. Kidney Int. 2008; 73: 52-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this context, HSNS4F5 can also be classified as a functional inflammatory HS motif, which may have therapeutic implications. Finally, apoptosis was noticed in blood vessels of mice with a targeted deletion of the HS biosynthetic enzyme N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase-1, which results in a lower degree of HS sulfation (45Pallerla S.R. Pan Y. Zhang X. Esko J.D. Grobe K. Dev. Dyn. 2007; 236: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, highly sulfated HS motifs generally promote cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis. This study pinpoints these effects to a specific HSNS4F5 motif (IdoA2S-GlcNS6S)3 and strongly suggests a role for (IdoA2S-GlcNS6S)3 structures in critically important pathways of cellular growth control. Such specific HS motifs may be key targets for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for amyloid-associated disorders such as Alzheimer disease. Some analogy may be drawn here with the drug fondaparinux, a synthetic heparin-based pentasaccharide that binds and activates antithrombin III, thereby reducing blood clot formation. The development of fondaparinux was based on the identification of the active motif within heparin responsible for its anticoagulant characteristics (46Petitou M. Hérault J.P. Bernat A. Driguez P.A. Duchaussoy P. Lormeau J.C. Herbert J.M. Nature. 1999; 398: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Our findings may be generalizable to pathologies that are dependent on HS/heparin-mediated pathways and may have implications for the development of novel diagnostic reagents and therapeutic interventions. Sequence analysis of other antibody-defined HS motifs and analysis of their cell biological function may thus provide a window for the development of defined oligosaccharides with therapeutic potential. IntroductionHeparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), 3The abbreviations used are: HSPGheparan sulfate proteoglycanGAGglycosaminoglycanHSheparan sulfateHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsAAamyloid protein ASPECTsingle photon emission computed tomographic. major components of the cell surface and the extracellular matrix, are involved in a variety of biological phenomena, including cell adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation as well as being associated with pathologic events such as atherosclerosis and amyloidosis. Because of their high negative charge, HS chains interact with a variety of proteins, including growth factors/morphogens and their receptors, the amyloid precursor protein serum amyloid protein A (AA), chemokines, and extracellular matrix proteins. HS-protein interactions vary with regard to specificity and may depend on charge density in addition to strict sequence motifs of HS.The interaction of heparin and HS with FGFs and their receptors has been characterized in great detail. Specific HS structures are predominantly determined by the regulated positioning of N-, 2-, 6-, and 3-O-sulfate groups along HS chains (1Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). For example, FGF-2 requires both N- and 2-O-sulfate groups for binding to HS. The 6-O-sulfate group is not essential for binding to FGF-2 but is critical for activation of the FGF receptor (2Nakato H. Kimata K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In contrast, binding of hepatocyte growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, lipoprotein lipase, and herpes simplex virus glycoprotein C to HS is dependent on 6-O-sulfation (3Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The activation of antithrombin III by HS/heparin is mediated by a specific pentasaccharide in which a 3-O-sulfate group is crucial (4Rosenberg R.D. Shworak N.W. Liu J. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2062-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Thus, the biological functions of HSPGs are controlled by biosynthetic events that define HS structures.Although it is increasingly recognized that a specific domain structure, typically from a tetra- to a decasaccharide in size, is responsible for HS modulation of biological activity, in only a few cases is there any structural information regarding sequences (3Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 4Rosenberg R.D. Shworak N.W. Liu J. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. J.

Therefore, accelerating our understanding of structure-function relationships for HS requires the development of rapid yet thorough sequencing methodologies. Antibodies reactive with HS have proven valuable tools to study specific HS motifs in cells and tissues (6Jenniskens G.J. Oosterhof A. Brandwijk R. Veerkamp J.H. van Kuppevelt T.H. J.

https://openalex.org/W2118814035,"To date, genome-wide association studies have focused almost exclusively on populations of European ancestry. These studies continue with the advent of next-generation sequencing, designed to systematically catalog and test low-frequency variation for a role in disease. A complementary approach would be to focus further efforts on cohorts of multiple ethnicities. This leverages the idea that population genetic drift may have elevated some variants to higher allele frequency in different populations, boosting statistical power to detect an association. Based on empirical allele frequency distributions from eleven populations represented in HapMap Phase 3 and the 1000 Genomes Project, we simulate a range of genetic models to quantify the power of association studies in multiple ethnicities relative to studies that exclusively focus on samples of European ancestry. In each of these simulations, a first phase of GWAS in exclusively European samples is followed by a second GWAS phase in any of the other populations (including a multiethnic design). We find that nontrivial power gains can be achieved by conducting future whole-genome studies in worldwide populations, where, in particular, African populations contribute the largest relative power gains for low-frequency alleles (<5%) of moderate effect that suffer from low power in samples of European descent. Our results emphasize the importance of broadening genetic studies to worldwide populations to ensure efficient discovery of genetic loci contributing to phenotypic trait variability, especially for those traits for which large numbers of samples of European ancestry have already been collected and tested."
https://openalex.org/W1973585083,"In a previous study it was found that the therapeutic effects of QLT0267, a small molecule inhibitor of integrin-linked kinase (ILK), were influenced by Her2/neu expression. To understand how inhibition or silencing of ILK influences Her2/neu expression, Her2/neu signaling was evaluated in six Her2/neu-positive breast cancer cell lines (LCC6Her2, MCF7Her2, SKBR3, BT474, JIMT-1 and KPL-4). Treatment with QLT0267 engendered suppression (32–87%) of total Her2/neu protein in these cells. Suppression of Her2/neu was also observed following small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of ILK expression. Time course studies suggest that ILK inhibition or silencing caused transient decreases in P-AKTser473, which were not temporally related to Her2/neu downregulation. Attenuation of ILK activity or expression was, however, associated with decreases in YB-1 (Y-box binding protein-1) protein and transcript levels. YB-1 is a known transcriptional regulator of Her2/neu expression, and in this study it is demonstrated that inhibition of ILK activity using QLT0267 decreased YB-1 promoter activity by 50.6%. ILK inhibition was associated with changes in YB-1 localization, as reflected by localization of cytoplasmic YB-1 into stress granules. ILK inhibition also suppressed TWIST (a regulator of YB-1 expression) protein expression. To confirm the role of ILK on YB-1 and TWIST, cells were engineered to overexpress ILK. This was associated with a fourfold increase in the level of YB-1 in the nucleus, and a 2- and 1.5-fold increase in TWIST and Her2/neu protein levels, respectively. Taken together, these data indicate that ILK regulates the expression of Her2/neu through TWIST and YB-1, lending support to the use of ILK inhibitors in the treatment of aggressive Her2/neu-positive tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2009011153,"Abnormal regulation of gene expression is essential for tumorigenesis. Recent studies indicate that regulation of oncogene expression and neoplastic transformation are controlled by subunits of eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs). Here we focused on eIF3 performing a pivotal role in protein synthesis and the differential expression of its subunits in cancer. The most uncharacterized non-core subunit eIF3m was confirmed to be highly expressed in human cancer cell lines and colon cancer patient tissues. By expression silencing with eIF3m-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA), we confirmed that eIF3m influences cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and cell death in human colon cancer cell line HCT-116. Using a ribonomics approach, we identified a subset of elF3m-influenced genes and showed that the expression of two highly represented tumorigenesis-related genes, MIF and MT2, were affected by eIF3m at the mRNA level. We also confirmed eIF3m-dependent regulation of MT2A downstream molecule CDC25A, which is necessary for cell cycle progression in HCT-116 cells. These results suggest that eIF3m mediates regulation of tumorigenesis-related genes in human colon cancer. Further investigations on tumorigenesis-related genes and their regulation by eIFs will provide clues for designing targeted therapy for cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2037632464,"Inflammatory breast carcinoma (IBC) is characterized by exaggerated lymphovascular invasion (LVI), recapitulated in our human xenograft, MARY-X. This model exhibited lymphovascular emboli in vivo and corresponding spheroids in vitro. Owing to the morphological and gene profile resemblance of these spheroids to embryonal blastocysts, we wondered whether they might exhibit embryonic stem cell signaling. Specifically we investigated Notch and observed selective Notch 3 activation by expression profiling, reverse transcriptase- and real-time PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence in vitro, and immunohistochemistry in vivo. Notch 3 intracellular domain (N3icd) and six target genes, HES-5, HEY-1, c-Myc, Deltex-1, NRARP and PBX1, markedly increased in MARY-X. In addition, a significant percentage of MARY-X cells expressed aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), a stem cell marker. Only the ALDH(+) cells were capable of secondary spheroidgenesis, tumorigenicity and self-renewal. Inhibiting Notch 3 activation in vitro with γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) or small interfering RNA resulted in a downregulation of Notch target genes, including CD133, and an induction of caspase 3-mediated apoptosis. Transfection of N3icd but not Notch 1 intracellular domain into normal human mammary epithelial cells resulted in increased expression of Notch target genes and induction of spheroidgenesis. GSI in vivo resulted in inhibitory but diffusion-limited effects on Notch 3 signaling, resulting in xenograft growth reduction. The lymphovascular emboli of human IBC exhibited dual N3icd and ALDH1 immunoreactivities independently of molecular subtype. This Notch 3 addiction of lymphovascular emboli might be exploited in future therapeutic strategies."

https://openalex.org/W2062992745,"LAT (linker for activation of T cells) is a transmembrane adaptor protein that plays an essential role in TCR-mediated signaling and thymocyte development. Because LAT-deficient mice have an early block in thymocyte development, we utilized an inducible system to delete LAT in primary T cells to study LAT function in T cell activation, homeostasis, and survival. Deletion of LAT caused primary T cells to become unresponsive to stimulation from the TCR and impaired T cell homeostatic proliferation and long term survival. Furthermore, deletion of LAT led to reduced expression of Foxp3, CTLA-4, and CD25 in Treg cells and impaired their function. Consequently, mice with LAT deleted developed a lymphoproliferative syndrome similar to that in LATY136F mice, although less severe. Our data implicate that LAT has positive and negative roles in the regulation of mature T cells. LAT (linker for activation of T cells) is a transmembrane adaptor protein that plays an essential role in TCR-mediated signaling and thymocyte development. Because LAT-deficient mice have an early block in thymocyte development, we utilized an inducible system to delete LAT in primary T cells to study LAT function in T cell activation, homeostasis, and survival. Deletion of LAT caused primary T cells to become unresponsive to stimulation from the TCR and impaired T cell homeostatic proliferation and long term survival. Furthermore, deletion of LAT led to reduced expression of Foxp3, CTLA-4, and CD25 in Treg cells and impaired their function. Consequently, mice with LAT deleted developed a lymphoproliferative syndrome similar to that in LATY136F mice, although less severe. Our data implicate that LAT has positive and negative roles in the regulation of mature T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2094479138,"In this study, we demonstrate that the expression in tumorigenic epidermal cells of a catalytically inactive form of CYLD (CYLDC/S) that mimics the identified mutations of cyld in human tumors and competes with the endogenous CYLD results in enhanced cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis; it also stimulates cell migration and induces the expression of angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor-A. Altogether, these characteristics indicate an increased oncogenicity of the tumorigenic epidermal CYLDC/S mutant cells in vitro. Moreover, we show the increase in malignancy of epidermal squamous cell carcinomas that express the CYLDC/S transgene in an in vivo xenograft model. Tumors carrying the mutated CYLDC/S exhibit a fast growth, are poorly differentiated and present a robust angiogenesis. CYLDC/S tumors are also characterized by their elevated proliferation rate and decreased apoptosis. In contrast with previous studies showing the development of benign tumors by mutations in the CYLD gene, here we provide evidence that the occurrence of mutations in the CYLD gene in tumorigenic epidermal cells (carrying previous mutations) increases the aggressiveness of carcinomas, mainly through enhancement of the expression of angiogenic factors, having therefore a key role in epidermal cancer malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W2155430448,"Anti-mitotic compounds (microtubule de-stabilizers) such as vincristine and vinblastine have been shown clinically successful in treating various cancers. However, development of drug-resistance cells limits their efficacies in clinical situations. Therefore, experiments were performed to determine possible drug resistance mechanisms related to the application of anti-mitotic cancer therapy.A KB-derived microtubule de-stabilizer-resistant KB-L30 cancer cell line was generated for this study. KB-L30 cells showed cross-resistance to various microtubule de-stabilizers including BPR0L075, vincristine and colchicine through multiple-drug resistant (MDR)-independent mechanisms. Surprisingly, KB-L30 cells showed hyper-sensitivity to the microtubule-stabilizer, paclitaxel. Results of the RT-PCR analysis revealed that expression of both class II and III β-tubulin was down-regulated in KB-L30 cells as compared to its parental KB cancer cells. In addition, DNA sequencing analysis revealed six novel mutation sites present in exon four of the βI-tubulin gene. Computational modeling indicated that a direct relationship exists between βI-tubulin mutations and alteration in the microtubule assembly and dynamic instability in KB-L30 cells and this predicted model was supported by an increased microtubule assembly and reduced microtubule dynamic instability in KB-L30 cells, as shown by Western blot analysis.Our study demonstrated that these novel mutations in exon four of the βI-tubulin induced resistance to microtubule de-stabilizers and hyper-sensitivity to microtubule stabilizer through an alteration in the microtubule assembly and dynamics in cancer cells. Importantly, the current study reveals that cancer cells may acquire drug resistance ability to anti-mitotic compounds through multiple changes in the microtubule networks. This study further provided molecular information in drug selection for patients with specific tubulin mutations."

Women become resistant to PAM, and develop strain-transcending immunity against CSA-binding parasites. The identification of var2CSA regions that could elicit broadly neutralizing and adhesion-blocking antibodies is a key step for the design of prophylactic vaccine strategies.Escherichia coli expressed var2CSA DBL domains were refolded and purified prior to immunization of mice and a goat. Protein-G-purified antibodies were tested for their ability to block FCR3(CSA)-infected erythrocytes binding to placental (BeWo) and monkey brain endothelial (ScC2) cell lines using a flow cytoadhesion inhibition assay mimicking closely the physiological conditions present in the placenta at shear stress of 0.05 Pa. DBL5-ε, DBL6-ε and DBL5-6-ε induced cross-reactive antibodies using Alum and Freund as adjuvants, which blocked cytoadhesion at values ranging between 40 to 96% at 0.5 mg IgG per ml. Importantly, antibodies raised against recombinant DBL5-ε from 3 distinct parasites genotypes (HB3, Dd2 and 7G8) showed strain-transcending inhibition ranging from 38 to 64% for the heterologuous FCR3(CSA).Using single and double DBL domains from var2CSA and Alum as adjuvant, we identified recombinant subunits inducing an immune response in experimental animals which is able to block efficiently parasite adhesion in a flow cytoadhesion assay that mimics closely the erythrocyte flow in the placenta. These subunits show promising features for inclusion into a vaccine aiming to protect against PAM."
https://openalex.org/W2049734724,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) encodes a Tax oncoprotein that has crucial roles in both virus replication and cell transformation. Our recent studies suggest that the counterbalance between HTLV-I/Tax and PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein PDLIM2 may determine the outcome of HTLV-I infection. Although HTLV-I represses PDLIM2 epigenetically and specifically in transformed cells, PDLIM2 shuttles Tax into the nuclear matrix for ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation, thereby suppressing the transforming ability of HTLV-I. Here, we have further shown that PDLIM2 binds to Tax directly, which was mediated by a putative α-helix motif of PDLIM2 at amino acids 236–254. Consistently, selective disruption of this short-helix crippled PDLIM2 in shutting Tax to the nuclear matrix for ubiquitination-mediated degradation, therefore, PDLIM2 lost the ability in tumor suppression. Although the C-terminal LIM domain of PDLIM2 was not required for Tax binding, it was important for PDLIM2 to interact with the nuclear matrix. Accordingly, the LIM domain was essential for PDLIM2-mediated Tax repression. On the contrary, the N-terminal PDZ domain of PDLIM2 was dispensable for all these events, although the PDZ domain was involved in PDLIM2 binding to cytoskeleton. These studies dissect functional sequences within PDLIM2 and their distinct roles in Tax regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2120243062,"Background Methylation of CpG islands of genome DNA and lysine residues of histone H3 and H4 tails regulates gene transcription. Inhibition of polyamine synthesis by ornithine decarboxylase antizyme-1 (OAZ) in human oral cancer cell line resulted in accumulation of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcSAM), which acts as a competitive inhibitor of methylation reactions. We anticipated that accumulation of dcSAM impaired methylation reactions and resulted in hypomethylation of genome DNA and histone tails. Methodology/Principal Findings Global methylation state of genome DNA and lysine residues of histone H3 and H4 tails were assayed by Methylation by Isoschizomers (MIAMI) method and western blotting, respectively, in the presence or absence of OAZ expression. Ectopic expression of OAZ mediated hypomethylation of CpG islands of genome DNA and histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2). Protein level of DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) and histone H3K9me specific methyltransferase G9a were down-regulated in OAZ transfectant. Conclusions/Significance OAZ induced hypomethylation of CpG islands of global genome DNA and H3K9me2 by down-regulating DNMT3B and G9a protein level. Hypomethylation of CpG islands of genome DNA and histone H3K9me2 is a potent mechanism of induction of the genes related to tumor suppression and DNA double strand break repair."
https://openalex.org/W1976894668,"Background Many areas of biology are open to mathematical and computational modelling. The application of discrete, logical formalisms defines the field of biomedical ontologies. Ontologies have been put to many uses in bioinformatics. The most widespread is for description of entities about which data have been collected, allowing integration and analysis across multiple resources. There are now over 60 ontologies in active use, increasingly developed as large, international collaborations. There are, however, many opinions on how ontologies should be authored; that is, what is appropriate for representation. Recently, a common opinion has been the “realist” approach that places restrictions upon the style of modelling considered to be appropriate. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we use a number of case studies for describing the results of biological experiments. We investigate the ways in which these could be represented using both realist and non-realist approaches; we consider the limitations and advantages of each of these models. Conclusions/Significance From our analysis, we conclude that while realist principles may enable straight-forward modelling for some topics, there are crucial aspects of science and the phenomena it studies that do not fit into this approach; realism appears to be over-simplistic which, perversely, results in overly complex ontological models. We suggest that it is impossible to avoid compromise in modelling ontology; a clearer understanding of these compromises will better enable appropriate modelling, fulfilling the many needs for discrete mathematical models within computational biology."
https://openalex.org/W2005255483,"In a recent study, we demonstrated the ability of lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of mevalonate synthesis, to inhibit the function of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Lovastatin attenuated ligand-induced receptor activation and downstream signaling through the PI3K/AKT pathway. Combining lovastatin with gefitinib, a potent EGFR inhibitor, induced synergistic cytotoxicity in a variety of tumor derived cell lines. The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and EGFR share similar activation, internalization and downstream signaling characteristics.The VEGFRs, particularly VEGFR-2 (KDR, Flt-1), play important roles in regulating tumor angiogenesis by promoting endothelial cell proliferation, survival and migration. Certain tumors, such as malignant mesothelioma (MM), also express both the VEGF ligand and VEGFRs that act in an autocrine loop to directly stimulate tumor cell growth and survival. In this study, we have shown that lovastatin inhibits ligand-induced VEGFR-2 activation through inhibition of receptor internalization and also inhibits VEGF activation of AKT in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and H28 MM cells employing immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Combinations of lovastatin and a VEGFR-2 inhibitor showed more robust AKT inhibition than either agent alone in the H28 MM cell line. Furthermore, combining 5 µM lovastatin treatment, a therapeutically relevant dose, with two different VEGFR-2 inhibitors in HUVEC and the H28 and H2052 mesothelioma derived cell lines demonstrated synergistic cytotoxicity as demonstrated by MTT cell viability and flow cytometric analyses.These results highlight a novel mechanism by which lovastatin can regulate VEGFR-2 function and a potential therapeutic approach for MM through combining statins with VEGFR-2 inhibitors."

In this study, we performed extensive substituted cysteine-scanning mutagenesis analysis of the C-terminal region of NBCe1-A covering amino acids Ala800–Lys967. Location of the introduced cysteines was determined by whole cell labeling with a membrane-permeant biotin maleimide and a membrane-impermeant 2-((5(6)-tetramethylrhodamine)carboxylamino) ethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTS-TAMRA) cysteine-reactive reagent. The results show that the extracellular surface of the NBCe1-A C-terminal transmembrane region is minimally exposed to aqueous media with Met858 accessible to both biotin maleimide and TAMRA and Thr926–Ala929 only to TAMRA labeling.

https://openalex.org/W2051027058,"Many hundreds of botanicals are used in complementary and alternative medicine for therapeutic use as antimicrobials and immune stimulators. While there exists many centuries of anecdotal evidence and few clinical studies on the activity and efficacy of these botanicals, limited scientific evidence exists on the ability of these botanicals to modulate the immune and inflammatory responses. Using botanogenomics (or herbogenomics), this study provides novel insight into inflammatory genes which are induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells following treatment with immunomodulatory botanical extracts. These results may suggest putative genes involved in the physiological responses thought to occur following administration of these botanical extracts. Using extracts from immunostimulatory herbs (Astragalus membranaceus, Sambucus cerulea, Andrographis paniculata) and an immunosuppressive herb (Urtica dioica), the data presented supports previous cytokine studies on these herbs as well as identifying additional genes which may be involved in immune cell activation and migration and various inflammatory responses, including wound healing, angiogenesis, and blood pressure modulation. Additionally, we report the presence of lipopolysaccharide in medicinally prepared extracts of these herbs which is theorized to be a natural and active component of the immunostimulatory herbal extracts. The data presented provides a more extensive picture on how these herbs may be mediating their biological effects on the immune and inflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W2019882179,"A predictive component can contribute to the command signal for smooth pursuit. This is readily demonstrated by the fact that low frequency sinusoidal target motion can be tracked with zero time delay or even with a small lead. The objective of this study was to characterize the predictive contributions to pursuit tracking more precisely by developing analytical models for predictive smooth pursuit. Subjects tracked a small target moving in two dimensions. In the simplest case, the periodic target motion was composed of the sums of two sinusoidal motions (SS), along both the horizontal and the vertical axes. Motions following the same or similar paths, but having a richer spectral composition, were produced by having the target follow the same path but at a constant speed (CS), and by combining the horizontal SS velocity with the vertical CS velocity and vice versa. Several different quantitative models were evaluated. The predictive contribution to the eye tracking command signal could be modeled as a low-pass filtered target acceleration signal with a time delay. This predictive signal, when combined with retinal image velocity at the same time delay, as in classical models for the initiation of pursuit, gave a good fit to the data. The weighting of the predictive acceleration component was different in different experimental conditions, being largest when target motion was simplest, following the SS velocity profiles."
https://openalex.org/W2018969644,"Receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) is the key regulator for osteoclast formation and function. During osteoclastogenesis, RANKL-stimulated signals differentially modulate expression of a large number of proteins. Using proteomics approaches, we identified that brain-type cytoplasmic creatine kinase (Ckb) was greatly induced in mature osteoclasts. Ckb has been shown to contribute to osteoclast function. However, the mechanisms of Ckb regulation and the contribution of other isoforms of creatine kinase during RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis are unknown. We found that Ckb was the predominant isoform of creatine kinase during osteoclastogenesis. Real-time PCR confirmed that RANKL induced ckb mRNA expression by over 40-fold in primary mouse bone marrow macrophages and Raw 264.7 cells. The RANKL-responsive region was identified within the −0.4- to −0.2-kb 5′-flanking region of the ckb gene. Affinity binding purification followed by mass spectrometry analysis revealed that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) bound to the −0.4/−0.2-kb fragment that negatively regulated expression of ckb in response to RANKL stimulation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with PARP-1-specific antibody located the binding site of PARP-1 to the TTCCCA consensus sequence. The expression of PARP-1 was reduced during RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, concurrently with increased expression of Ckb. Consistently, knockdown of PARP-1 by lentivirus-delivered shRNA enhanced ckb mRNA expression. The activity of PARP-1 was determined to be required for its inhibitory effect on the ckb expression. In summary, we have demonstrated that PARP-1 is a negative regulator of the ckb expression.

https://openalex.org/W2059299257,"ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters play pivotal physiological roles in substrate transport across membranes, and defective assembly of these proteins can cause severe disease associated with improper drug or ion flux. The yeast protein Yor1p is a useful model to study the biogenesis of ABC transporters; deletion of a phenylalanine residue in the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) causes misassembly and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the resulting protein Yor1p-ΔF670, similar to the predominant disease-causing allele in humans, CFTR-ΔF508. Here we describe two novel Yor1p mutants, G278R and I1084P, which fail to assemble and traffic similar to Yor1p-ΔF670. These mutations are located in the two intracellular loops (ICLs) that interface directly with NBD1, and thus disrupt a functionally important structural module. We isolated 2 second-site mutations, F270S and R1168M, which partially correct the folding injuries associated with the G278R, I1084P, and ΔF670 mutants and reinstate their trafficking. The position of both corrective mutations at the cytoplasmic face of a transmembrane helix suggests that they restore biogenesis by influencing the behavior of the transmembrane domains rather than by direct restoration of the ICL1-ICL4-NBD1 structural module. Given the conserved topology of many ABC transporters, our findings provide new understanding of functionally important inter-domain interactions and suggest new potential avenues for correcting folding defects caused by abrogation of those domain interfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2078300126,"AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are tetrameric ion channels that mediate rapid glutamate signaling in neurons and many non-neuronal cell types. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control mechanisms permit only correctly folded functional receptors to be delivered to the cell surface. We analyzed the biosynthetic maturation and transport of all 12 GluA1-4 subunit splice variants as homomeric receptors and observed robust isoform-dependent differences in ER exit competence and surface expression. In contrast to inefficient ER exit of both GluA3 splice forms and the flop variants of GluA1 and GluA4, prominent plasma membrane expression was observed for the other AMPAR isoforms. Surprisingly, deletion of the entire N-terminal domain did not alter the transport phenotype, nor did the different cytosolic C-terminal tail splice variants. Detailed analysis of mutant receptors led to the identification of distinct residues in the ligand-binding domain as primary determinants for isoform-specific maturation. Considered together with the essential role of bound agonist, our findings reveal the ligand-binding domain as the critical quality control target in AMPAR biogenesis."

Abnormal expression and dysfunction of P2X7 have been reported in leukemias. Here, we report a new P2X7 mutant (an A(559)-to-G substitution causing N187D P2X7) cloned from J6-1 leukemia cells. The characteristics of N187D P2X7 were studied by establishing stably transfected K562 cell lines. Our results show that N187D P2X7 required a higher concentration of agonist for its activation, leading to Ca(2+) influx (EC(50) = 293.3 ± 6.6 μm for the mutant and 93.6 ± 2.2 μm for wild-type P2X7) and ERK phosphorylation, which were not caused by differential cell-surface expression or related to high ATPase activity on the cell surface and in the extracellular space. K562 cells expressing this N187D mutant showed a proliferative advantage and reduced pro-apoptosis effects in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, elevated angiogenesis and CD206-positive macrophage infiltration were found in tumor tissues formed by K562-M cells. In addition, higher expression of VEGF and MCP1 could be detected in tumor tissues formed by K562-M cells.

https://openalex.org/W2004332434,"Formation of the strong binding interaction between actin and myosin is essential for force generation in muscle and in cytoskeletal motor systems. To clarify the role of the closure of myosin's actin-binding cleft in the actomyosin interaction, we performed rapid kinetic, spectroscopic, and calorimetric experiments and atomic-level energetic calculations on a variety of myosin isoforms for which atomic structures are available. Surprisingly, we found that the endothermic actin-binding profile of vertebrate skeletal muscle myosin subfragment-1 is unique among studied myosins. We show that the diverse propensity of myo-sins for cleft closure determines different energetic profiles as well as structural and kinetic pathways of actin binding. Depending on the type of myosin, strong actin binding may occur via induced-fit or conformational preselection mechanisms. However, cleft closure does not directly determine the kinetics and affinity of actin binding. We also show that cleft closure is enthal-pically unfavorable, reflecting the development of an internal strain within myosin in order to adopt precise steric complementarity to the actin filament. We propose that cleft closure leads to an increase in the torsional strain of myosin's central β-sheet that has been proposed to serve as an allosteric energy-transducing spring during force generation.—Takacs, B., O'Neall-Hennessey, E., Hetenyi, C., Kardos, J., Szent-Gyorgyi, A.

Still relatively little is known about the function of PTPs in vivo. We set out to systematically identify all classical PTPs in the zebrafish genome and characterize their expression patterns during zebrafish development. We identified 48 PTP genes in the zebrafish genome by BLASTing of human PTP sequences. We verified all in silico hits by sequencing and established the spatio-temporal expression patterns of all PTPs by in situ hybridization of zebrafish embryos at six distinct developmental stages. The zebrafish genome encodes 48 PTP genes. 14 human orthologs are duplicated in the zebrafish genome and 3 human orthologs were not identified. Based on sequence conservation, most zebrafish orthologues of human PTP genes were readily assigned. Interestingly, the duplicated form of ptpn23, a catalytically inactive PTP, has lost its PTP domain, indicating that PTP activity is not required for its function, or that ptpn23b has lost its PTP domain in the course of evolution. All 48 PTPs are expressed in zebrafish embryos. Most PTPs are maternally provided and are broadly expressed early on. PTP expression becomes progressively restricted during development. Interestingly, some duplicated genes retained their expression pattern, whereas expression of other duplicated genes was distinct or even mutually exclusive, suggesting that the function of the latter PTPs has diverged. In conclusion, we have identified all members of the family of classical PTPs in the zebrafish genome and established their expression patterns. This is the first time the expression patterns of all members of the large family of PTP genes have been established in a vertebrate. Our results provide the first step towards elucidation of the function of the family of classical PTPs."
https://openalex.org/W1992982757,"Background There have been numerous studies on dinosaur biogeographic distribution patterns. However, these distribution data have not yet been applied to ecological questions. Ecological studies of dinosaurs have tended to focus on reconstructing individual taxa, usually through comparisons to modern analogs. Fewer studies have sought to determine if the ecological structure of fossil assemblages is preserved and, if so, how dinosaur communities varied. Climate is a major component driving differences between communities. If the ecological structure of a fossil locality is preserved, we expect that dinosaur assemblages from similar environments will share a similar ecological structure. Methodology/Principal Findings This study applies Ecological Structure Analysis (ESA) to a dataset of 100+ dinosaur taxa arranged into twelve composite fossil assemblages from around the world. Each assemblage was assigned a climate zone (biome) based on its location. Dinosaur taxa were placed into ecomorphological categories. The proportion of each category creates an ecological profile for the assemblage, which were compared using cluster and principal components analyses. Assemblages grouped according to biome, with most coming from arid or semi-arid/seasonal climates. Differences between assemblages are tied to the proportion of large high-browsing vs. small ground-foraging herbivores, which separates arid from semi-arid and moister environments, respectively. However, the effects of historical, taphonomic, and other environmental factors are still evident. Conclusions/Significance This study is the first to show that the general ecological structure of Late Jurassic dinosaur assemblages is preserved at large scales and can be assessed quantitatively. Despite a broad similarity of climatic conditions, a degree of ecological variation is observed between assemblages, from arid to moist. Taxonomic differences between Asia and the other regions demonstrate at least one case of ecosystem convergence. The proportion of different ecomorphs, which reflects the prevailing climatic and environmental conditions present during fossil deposition, may therefore be used to differentiate Late Jurassic dinosaur fossil assemblages. This method is broadly applicable to different taxa and times, allowing one to address questions of evolutionary, biogeographic, and climatic importance."
https://openalex.org/W2011628658,"Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) occurs in animal models of diabetes (DM) and is implicated in pathological responses to myocardial ischemia. Using bioinformatics, we identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the PPARα gene promoter (PPARA -54,642 G>A; rs135561) that altered the consensus sequence for a nuclear receptor binding site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the domain bound two known PPARA transcriptional activators, estrogen-related receptor (ERR)-α and -γ and that PPARA G bound with greater affinity than PPARA A (>2-fold; P<0.05). Likewise, promoter-reporter analyses showed enhanced transcriptional activity for PPARA G vs. PPARA A for both ERR-α and -γ (3.1 vs.1.9-fold; P<0.05). Since PPARα activation impairs post-ischemic cardiac function in experimental models of DM, we tested whether decreased PPARA transcription in PPARA A carriers favorably impacted outcome after acute coronary ischemia in 705 patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndromes (ACS; 552 Caucasian, 106 African American). PPARA A allele frequencies were similar to non-diseased subjects. However, PPARA genotype correlated with 5-year mortality in diabetic (22.2% AA vs. 18.8% AG vs. 39.5% GG; P = 0.008), but not non-diabetic (P = 0.96) subjects (genotype by diabetes interaction P = 0.008). In the diabetic ACS subjects, PPARA A carriers had strikingly reduced all-cause mortality compared to PPARA G homozygotes, (unadjusted HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26-0.75; P = 0.003; adjusted HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.27-0.83; P = 0.009).

Baseline levels of the regulatory cytokines TGF-β and IL-10 inversely correlated with antibody levels post vaccination and warrant further studies to improve understanding of individual differences in response to vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W1995541867,"Collagen fibers expose distinct domains allowing for specific interactions with other extracellular matrix proteins and cells. To investigate putative collagen domains that govern integrin α(V)β(3)-mediated cellular interactions with native collagen fibers we took advantage of the streptococcal protein CNE that bound native fibrillar collagens. CNE specifically inhibited α(V)β(3)-dependent cell-mediated collagen gel contraction, PDGF BB-induced and α(V)β(3)-mediated adhesion of cells, and binding of fibronectin to native collagen. Using a Toolkit composed of overlapping, 27-residue triple helical segments of collagen type II, two CNE-binding sites present in peptides II-1 and II-44 were identified. These peptides lack the major binding site for collagen-binding β(1) integrins, defined by the peptide GFOGER. Peptide II-44 corresponds to a region of collagen known to bind collagenases, discoidin domain receptor 2, SPARC (osteonectin), and fibronectin. In addition to binding fibronectin, peptide II-44 but not II-1 inhibited α(V)β(3)-mediated collagen gel contraction and, when immobilized on plastic, supported adhesion of cells. Reduction of fibronectin expression by siRNA reduced PDGF BB-induced α(V)β(3)-mediated contraction. Reconstitution of collagen types I and II gels in the presence of CNE reduced collagen fibril diameters and fibril melting temperatures. Our data indicate that contraction proceeded through an indirect mechanism involving binding of cell-produced fibronectin to the collagen fibers. Furthermore, our data show that cell-mediated collagen gel contraction does not directly depend on the process of fibril formation."
https://openalex.org/W2044993049,"Background Embryonic stem (ES) cells hold considerable promise as a source of cells with therapeutic potential, including cells that can be used for drug screening and in cell replacement therapies. Differentiation of ES cells into the somatic lineages is a regulated process; before the promise of these cells can be realised robust and rational methods for directing differentiation into normal, functional and safe cells need to be developed. Previous in vivo studies have implicated fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling in lineage specification from pluripotent cells. Although FGF signalling has been suggested as essential for specification of mesoderm and endoderm in vivo and in culture, the exact role of this pathway remains unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a culture model based on early primitive ectoderm-like (EPL) cells we have investigated the role of FGF signalling in the specification of mesoderm. We were unable to demonstrate any mesoderm inductive capability associated with FGF1, 4 or 8 signalling, even when the factors were present at high concentrations, nor any enhancement in mesoderm formation induced by exogenous BMP4. Furthermore, there was no evidence of alteration of mesoderm sub-type formed with addition of FGF1, 4 or 8. Inhibition of endogenous FGF signalling, however, prevented mesoderm and favoured neural differentiation, suggesting FGF signalling was required but not sufficient for the differentiation of primitive ectoderm into primitive streak-like intermediates. The maintenance of ES cell/early epiblast pluripotent marker expression was also observed in cultures when FGF signalling was inhibited. Conclusions/Significance FGF signalling has been shown to be required for the differentiation of primitive ectoderm to neurectoderm. This, coupled with our observations, suggest FGF signalling is required for differentiation of the primitive ectoderm into the germ lineages at gastrulation."
https://openalex.org/W2031995328,"Drug discovery initiatives often depend critically on knowledge of ligand-receptor interactions. However, the identity or structure of the target receptor may not be known in every instance. The concept of receptor surrogate, a molecular environment mimic of natural receptor, may prove beneficial under such circumstances. Here, we demonstrate the potential of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to act as surrogate receptors for a class of innate immune peptide antibiotics, a strategy that can help comprehend their action mechanism and identify chemical entities crucial for activity. A panel of antibody surrogates was raised against indolicidin, a tryptophan-rich cationic broad spectrum antimicrobial peptide of innate immune origin. Employing an elegant combination of thermodynamics, crystallography, and molecular modeling, interactions of the peptide with a high affinity anti-indolicidin monoclonal antibody were analyzed and were used to identify a motif that contained almost the entire antibiotic activity of native indolicidin. The analysis clarified the interaction of the peptide with previously proposed targets such as bacterial cell membrane and DNA and could further be correlated with antimicrobial compounds whose actions involve varied other mechanisms. These features suggest a multipronged assault pathway for indolicidin. Remarkably, the anti-indolicidin mAb surrogate was able to isolate additional independent bactericidal sequences from a random peptide library, providing compelling evidence as to the physiological relevance of surrogate receptor concept and suggesting applications in receptor-based pharmacophore research."
https://openalex.org/W2117067088,"Chronic activation of angiotensin II (AngII) type 1 receptor (AT(1)R), a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) induces gene regulatory stress which is responsible for phenotypic modulation of target cells. The AT(1)R-selective drugs reverse the gene regulatory stress in various cardiovascular diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms are not clear. We speculate that activation states of AT(1)R modify the composition of histone isoforms and post-translational modifications (PTM), thereby alter the structure-function dynamics of chromatin. We combined total histone isolation, FPLC separation, and mass spectrometry techniques to analyze histone H2A in HEK293 cells with and without AT(1)R activation. We have identified eight isoforms: H2AA, H2AG, H2AM, H2AO, H2AQ, Q96QV6, H2AC and H2AL. The isoforms, H2AA, H2AC and H2AQ were methylated and H2AC was phosphorylated. The relative abundance of specific H2A isoforms and PTMs were further analyzed in relationship to the activation states of AT(1)R by immunochemical studies. Within 2 hr, the isoforms, H2AA/O exchanged with H2AM. The monomethylated H2AC increased rapidly and the phosphorylated H2AC decreased, thus suggesting that enhanced H2AC methylation is coupled to Ser1p dephosphorylation. We show that H2A125Kme1 promotes interaction with the heterochromatin associated protein, HP1α. These specific changes in H2A are reversed by treatment with the AT(1)R specific inhibitor losartan. Our analysis provides a first step towards an awareness of histone code regulation by GPCRs."
https://openalex.org/W2161464979,"In symbiotic legume nodules, endosymbiotic rhizobia (bacteroids) fix atmospheric N(2), an ATP-dependent catalytic process yielding stoichiometric ammonium and hydrogen gas (H(2)). While in most legume nodules this H(2) is quantitatively evolved, which loss drains metabolic energy, certain bacteroid strains employ uptake hydrogenase activity and thus evolve little or no H(2). Rather, endogenous H(2) is efficiently respired at the expense of O(2), driving oxidative phosphorylation, recouping ATP used for H(2) production, and increasing the efficiency of symbiotic nodule N(2) fixation. In many ensuing investigations since its discovery as a physiological process, bacteroid uptake hydrogenase activity has been presumed a single entity.Azorhizobium caulinodans, the nodule endosymbiont of Sesbania rostrata stems and roots, possesses both orthodox respiratory (exo-)hydrogenase and novel (endo-)hydrogenase activities. These two respiratory hydrogenases are structurally quite distinct and encoded by disparate, unlinked gene-sets. As shown here, in S. rostrata symbiotic nodules, haploid A. caulinodans bacteroids carrying single knockout alleles in either exo- or-endo-hydrogenase structural genes, like the wild-type parent, evolve no detectable H(2) and thus are fully competent for endogenous H(2) recycling. Whereas, nodules formed with A. caulinodans exo-, endo-hydrogenase double-mutants evolve endogenous H(2) quantitatively and thus suffer complete loss of H(2) recycling capability. More generally, from bioinformatic analyses, diazotrophic microaerophiles, including rhizobia, which respire H(2) may carry both exo- and endo-hydrogenase gene-sets.In symbiotic S. rostrata nodules, A. caulinodans bacteroids can use either respiratory hydrogenase to recycle endogenous H(2) produced by N(2) fixation. Thus, H(2) recycling by symbiotic legume nodules may involve multiple respiratory hydrogenases."
