https://openalex.org/W2046930479,"Cell proliferation, cell death, and pattern formation are coordinated in animal development. Although many proteins that control cell proliferation and apoptosis have been identified, the means by which these effectors are linked to the patterning machinery remain poorly understood. Here, we report that the bantam gene of Drosophila encodes a 21 nucleotide microRNA that promotes tissue growth. bantam expression is temporally and spatially regulated in response to patterning cues. bantam microRNA simultaneously stimulates cell proliferation and prevents apoptosis. We identify the pro-apoptotic gene hid as a target for regulation by bantam miRNA, providing an explanation for bantam's anti-apoptotic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1974036352,"One hypothesis for why females in many animal species frequently prefer to mate with the most elaborately ornamented males predicts that availability of carotenoid pigments is a potentially limiting factor for both ornament expression and immune function. An implicit assumption of this hypothesis is that males that can afford to produce more elaborate carotenoid-dependent displays must be healthier individuals with superior immunocompetence. However, whether variation in circulating carotenoid levels causes variation in both immune function and sexual attractiveness has not been determined in any species. In this study, we show that manipulation of dietary carotenoid supply invokes parallel changes in cell-mediated immune function and sexual attractiveness in male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata)."
https://openalex.org/W1998347477,"Developing axons are guided to their targets by attractive and repulsive guidance cues. In the embryonic spinal cord, the floor plate chemoattractant Netrin-1 is required to guide commissural neuron axons to the midline. However, genetic evidence suggests that other chemoattractant(s) are also involved. We show that the morphogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh) can mimic the additional chemoattractant activity of the floor plate in vitro and can act directly as a chemoattractant on isolated axons. Cyclopamine-mediated inhibition of the Shh signaling mediator Smoothened (Smo) or conditional inactivation of Smo in commissural neurons indicate that Smo activity is important for the additional chemoattractant activity of the floor plate in vitro and for the normal projection of commissural axons to the floor plate in vivo. These results provide evidence that Shh, acting via Smo, is a midline-derived chemoattractant for commissural axons and show that a morphogen can also act as an axonal chemoattractant."
https://openalex.org/W2001029086,"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins form large multimeric complexes (PcG bodies) which are involved in the stable repression of gene expression. The human PcG protein, Pc2, has been shown to recruit the transcriptional corepressor, CtBP, to PcG bodies. We show that CtBP is sumoylated at a single lysine. In vitro, CtBP sumoylation minimally requires the SUMO E1 and E2 (Ubc9) and SUMO-1. However, Pc2 dramatically enhances CtBP sumoylation. In vivo, this is likely due to the ability of Pc2 to recruit both CtBP and Ubc9 to PcG bodies, thereby bringing together substrate and E2, and stimulating the transfer of SUMO to CtBP. These results demonstrate that Pc2 is a SUMO E3, and suggest that PcG bodies may be sumoylation centers."
https://openalex.org/W1988484290,"We measured the spin state of iron in ferropericlase (Mg0.83Fe0.17)O at high pressure and found a high-spin to low-spin transition occurring in the 60- to 70-gigapascal pressure range, corresponding to depths of 2000 kilometers in Earth's lower mantle. This transition implies that the partition coefficient of iron between ferropericlase and magnesium silicate perovskite, the two main constituents of the lower mantle, may increase by several orders of magnitude, depleting the perovskite phase of its iron. The lower mantle may then be composed of two different layers. The upper layer would consist of a phase mixture with about equal partitioning of iron between magnesium silicate perovskite and ferropericlase, whereas the lower layer would consist of almost iron-free perovskite and iron-rich ferropericlase. This stratification is likely to have profound implications for the transport properties of Earth's lowermost mantle."

https://openalex.org/W2131309206,"Cell-extracellular matrix adhesion is an important determinant of cell morphology. We show here that migfilin, a LIM-containing protein, localizes to cell-matrix adhesions, associates with actin filaments, and is essential for cell shape modulation. Migfilin interacts with the cell-matrix adhesion protein Mig-2 (mitogen inducible gene-2), a mammalian homolog of UNC-112, and the actin binding protein filamin through its C- and N-terminal domains, respectively. Loss of Mig-2 or migfilin impairs cell shape modulation. Mig-2 recruits migfilin to cell-matrix adhesions, while the interaction with filamin mediates the association of migfilin with actin filaments. Migfilin therefore functions as an important scaffold at cell-matrix adhesions. Together, Mig-2, migfilin and filamin define a connection between cell matrix adhesions and the actin cytoskeleton and participate in the orchestration of actin assembly and cell shape modulation."
https://openalex.org/W2067118661,"Paleosalinity and terrigenous sediment input changes reconstructed on two sediment cores from the northernmost Red Sea were used to infer hydrological changes at the southern margin of the Mediterranean climate zone during the Holocene. Between approximately 9.25 and 7.25 thousand years ago, about 3 per thousand reduced surface water salinities and enhanced fluvial sediment input suggest substantially higher rainfall and freshwater runoff, which thereafter decreased to modern values. The northern Red Sea humid interval is best explained by enhancement and southward extension of rainfall from Mediterranean sources, possibly involving strengthened early-Holocene Arctic Oscillation patterns and a regional monsoon-type circulation induced by increased land-sea temperature contrasts. We conclude that Afro-Asian monsoonal rains did not cross the subtropical desert zone during the early to mid-Holocene."
https://openalex.org/W2068806054,"Parkin, the most commonly mutated gene in familial Parkinson's disease, encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase. A number of candidate substrates have been identified for parkin ubiquitin ligase action including CDCrel-1, o-glycosylated Î±-synuclein, Pael-R, and synphilin-1. We now show that parkin promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of an expanded polyglutamine protein. Overexpression of parkin reduces aggregation and cytotoxicity of an expanded polyglutamine ataxin-3 fragment. Using a cellular proteasome indicator system based on a destabilized form of green fluorescent protein, we demonstrate that parkin reduces proteasome impairment and caspase-12 activation induced by an expanded polyglutamine protein. Parkin forms a complex with the expanded polyglutamine protein, heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and the proteasome, which may be important for the elimination of the expanded polyglutamine protein. Hsp70 enhances parkin binding and ubiquitination of expanded polyglutamine protein in vitro suggesting that Hsp70 may help to recruit misfolded proteins as substrates for parkin E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. We speculate that parkin may function to relieve endoplasmic reticulum stress by preserving proteasome activity in the presence of misfolded proteins. Loss of parkin function and the resulting proteasomal impairment may contribute to the accumulation of toxic aberrant proteins in neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2168439196,"Tropical South America has the highest plant diversity of any region today, but this richness is usually characterized as a geologically recent development (Neogene or Pleistocene). From caldera-lake beds exposed at Laguna del Hunco in Patagonia, Argentina, paleolatitude approximately 47 degrees S, we report 102 leaf species. Radioisotopic and paleomagnetic analyses indicate that the flora was deposited 52 million years ago, the time of the early Eocene climatic optimum, when tropical plant taxa and warm, equable climates reached middle latitudes of both hemispheres. Adjusted for sample size, observed richness exceeds that of any other Eocene leaf flora, supporting an ancient history of high plant diversity in warm areas of South America."
https://openalex.org/W2147385427,"Biological imaging is now a quantitative technique for probing cellular structure and dynamics and is increasingly used for cell-based screens. However, the bioinformatics tools required for hypothesis-driven analysis of digital images are still immature. We are developing the Open Microscopy Environment (OME) as an informatics solution for the storage and analysis of optical microscope image data. OME aims to automate image analysis, modeling, and mining of large sets of images and specifies a flexible data model, a relational database, and an XML-encoded file standard that is usable by potentially any software tool. With this design, OME provides a first step toward biological image informatics."
https://openalex.org/W2099788003,"ADR1 and CAT8 encode carbon source-responsive transcriptional regulators that cooperatively control expression of genes involved in ethanol utilization. These transcription factors are active only after the diauxic transition, when glucose is depleted and energy-generating metabolism has shifted to the aerobic oxidation of non-fermentable carbon sources. The Snf1 protein kinase complex is required for activation of their downstream target genes described previously. Using DNA microarrays, we determined the extent to which these three factors collaborate in regulating the expression of the yeast genome after glucose depletion. The expression of 108 genes is significantly decreased in the absence of ADR1. The importance of ADR1 during the diauxic transition is illustrated by the observation that expression of almost one-half of the 40 most highly glucose-repressed genes is ADR1-dependent. ADR1-dependent genes fall into a variety of functional classes with carbon metabolism containing the largest number of members. Most of the genes in this class are involved in the oxidation of different non-fermentable carbon sources. These microarray data show that ADR1 coordinates the biochemical pathways that generate acetyl-CoA and NADH from non-fermentable substrates. Only a small number of ADR1-dependent genes are also CAT8-dependent. However, nearly one-half of the ADR1-dependent genes are also dependent on the Snf1 protein kinase for derepression. Many more genes are SNF1-dependent than are either ADR1- or CAT8-dependent suggesting that SNF1 plays a broader role in gene expression than either ADR1 or CAT8. The largest class of SNF1-dependent genes encodes regulatory proteins that could extend SNF1 dependence to additional pathways. ADR1 and CAT8 encode carbon source-responsive transcriptional regulators that cooperatively control expression of genes involved in ethanol utilization.

The largest class of SNF1-dependent genes encodes regulatory proteins that could extend SNF1 dependence to additional pathways. During the diauxic shift, when yeast cells deplete the glucose in the medium, the flow of metabolites changes dramatically to adapt to the use of alternative energy and carbon sources, primarily ethanol produced during fermentation. The changes in gene expression that are required for this metabolic reorganization were dramatically revealed by DNA microarray analysis (1DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3673) Google Scholar). The expression of more than one-quarter of the yeast genome is altered when glucose is exhausted. These alterations allow the cell to utilize carbon sources other than glucose to channel metabolites into the tricarboxylic acid and glyoxylate cycles to generate energy and synthesize intermediates for gluconeogenesis. In addition, these changes allow the cell to alter its growth rate and prepare for growth arrest and stationary phase. Numerous transcription factors and regulatory proteins are responsible for the altered transcriptional program that accompanies the depletion of glucose. Two transcription factors that play important roles during the diauxic transition are Adr1 1Proteins are indicated by gene names with a capital letter followed by lowercase letters (Adr1), and genotypes and gene names are capitalized in italics (ADR1).1Proteins are indicated by gene names with a capital letter followed by lowercase letters (Adr1), and genotypes and gene names are capitalized in italics (ADR1). and Cat8. ADR1 was discovered as a regulatory gene that is required for expression of the glucose-repressed ADH2 2The abbreviations used are: ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; ORF, open reading frame; UAS, upstream activation sequence.2The abbreviations used are: ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; ORF, open reading frame; UAS, upstream activation sequence. gene (2Ciriacy M.

ADH2 encodes an alcohol dehydrogenase isozyme that is required for the first step in ethanol oxidation. Expression of eight other genes is dependent on ADR1. These include other genes important for ethanol and glycerol utilization (4Kratzer S. Schuller H.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 5Grauslund M.

Genet. 1993; 24: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Six of the eight genes encode components of the peroxisomal pathway for Î²-oxidation of fatty acids (7Simon M. Adam G. Rapatz W. Spevak W. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 8Gurvitz A. Wabnegger L. Rottensteiner H. Dawes I.W. Hartig A. Ruis H. Hamilton B. Mol. Cell. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 31825-31830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). CAT8 is an essential gene for growth on non-fermentable carbon sources (10Hedges D. Proft M. Entian K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1915-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Most of the genes encoding enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle and two key enzymes of gluconeogenesis are well characterized targets of Cat8. DNA miniarray and proteomic analyses extended to 34 the number of CAT8-dependent genes (11Haurie V. Perrot M. Mini T. Jeno P. Sagliocco F. Boucherie H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 76-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Many of the newly identified genes have roles in ethanol and lactate utilization and intracellular transport of glyoxylate and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. Many of the transcriptional changes occurring at the diauxic transition require an active Snf1 protein kinase complex (12Carlson M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Snf1 is the yeast homolog of the AMP-activated protein kinase found in higher eukaryotes. Although Snf1 is present in glucose-grown cells, its activity is regulated, perhaps via phosphorylation by a Snf1 kinase kinase or by the accumulation of AMP that occurs in the cell when glucose is depleted. Its importance for aerobic growth is illustrated by the fact that snf1 mutant cells are unable to grow on any non-fermentable carbon source, while having apparently wild-type growth properties in the presence of glucose. SNF1 is also essential for growth on alternative sugars such as sucrose, galactose, and maltose. Snf1-dependent phosphorylation regulates several glucose-responsive transcription factors. Phosphorylation of the repressor Mig1 leads to its export from the nucleus and derepression of glucose-repressed genes encoding enzymes required for metabolism of alternative sugars (13DeVit M.J. Waddle J.A. Johnston M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1603-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 14Treitel M.A. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6273-6280Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). SNF1 regulates both the activity of the Cat8 and Sip4 transcription factors and the transcription of their genes (15Hiesinger M. Roth S. Meissner E. Schuller H.J. Curr. Genet. 2001; 39: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Lesage P. Yang X. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1921-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17Vincent O. Carlson M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7002-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Randez-Gil F. Bojunga N. Proft M. Entian K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2502-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The interaction between Snf1- and ADR1-dependent gene activation is unclear. The expression of Adr1 is not SNF1-dependent (19Dombek K.M. Camier S. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but Adr1 is unable to bind the ADH2 promoter in the absence of Snf1 (20Young E.T. Kacherovsky N. Van Riper K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38095-38103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Snf1 could phosphorylate and activate Adr1 for binding, or it could act on ADR1-dependent promoters in some other manner to allow Adr1 to bind. For example, Snf1 phosphorylates Ser-10 on histone H3, leading to acetylation of Lys-14 and activation of the INO1 promoter (21Lo W.S. Duggan L. Tolga Emre N.C. Belotserkovskya R. Lane W.S. Shiekhattar R. Berger S.L. Science. 2001; 293: 1142-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). If Snf1 and Adr1 act in a concerted but independent manner on target genes, some ADR1-dependent genes might be activated independently of Snf1. Such genes could be identified by examining the overlap between ADR1- and SNF1-dependent genes using DNA microarrays. Microarrays could help identify other transcription factors that play a role in the activation of Adr1 target genes. For example, two genes involved in ethanol metabolism, ADH2 and ACS1, are co-regulated by Adr1 and Cat8 in a synergistic manner (22Walther K. Schuller H.J. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 2037-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The genes of Î²-oxidation that are ADR1-dependent are also regulated by oleate induction through the transcription factor Oaf1 Â·Pip2 (8Gurvitz A. Wabnegger L. Rottensteiner H. Dawes I.W. Hartig A. Ruis H. Hamilton B. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 4: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 9Gurvitz A. Hiltunen J.K. Erdmann R. Hamilton B. Hartig A. Ruis H. Rottensteiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31825-31830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). GUT1 is regulated by Ino2 and Ino4 as well as by Adr1 (5Grauslund M. Lopes J.M. Ronnow B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4391-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, Adr1 acts in concert with at least three other transcription factors. To uncover the full repertoire of ADR1-dependent genes and to identify those that are also CAT8- and SNF1-dependent, we performed whole genome transcriptome profiling of derepressed cells using DNA microarrays. Strains carrying deletions of ADR1, CAT8, SNF1, and the double mutants adr1 cat8 and adr1 snf1 were compared with a wild-type strain using a two-color hybridization assay. One hundred eight genes are ADR1-dependent in the microarray assay. Additional genes in pathways already known to be ADR1-dependent as well as genes encoding enzymes and proteins performing cellular functions not previously suspected of being ADR1-dependent were identified. Many of these genes have potential Adr1-binding sites in their promoters, and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed nine of them to be direct targets of Adr1. The ADR1-dependent genes encode proteins having diverse cellular functions, ranging from formate metabolism to meiosis. In a related microarray experiment in which repressed and derepressed mRNAs were compared, most of the ADR1-dependent genes were highly glucose-repressed. Many, but not all, ADR1-dependent genes are dependent for expression on SNF1. Despite their diversity, the ADR1-dependent genes have several unifying features. They are all non-essential in rich glucose medium, and many are important for growth or survival when yeasts are grown on a non-fermentable carbon source. StrainsâYeast strains are listed in Table I. To create isogenic strains that differ only at the ADR1 locus, we replaced the wild-type ADR1 gene with LEU2 (23Hartshorne T.A. Blumberg H. Young E.T. Nature. 1986; 320: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and introduced a low copy plasmid with or without ADR1. This was done because we observed that an adr1::LEU2 strain grows better on glucose minimal media plates than its ADR1 leu2 isogenic parent, suggesting that leucine biosynthesis may be limiting under these conditions. By using this strategy both the ADR1 wild-type and the adr1 mutant strains are Leu+ and will not differ in gene expression because of unknown indirect effects of leucine auxotrophy. The plasmid copy of ADR1 activates ADH2 expression to a level similar to the level activated by the endogenous ADR1 gene (24Sloan J.S. Dombek K.M. Young E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37575-37582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Strain TYY390 was created from TYY202 by disrupting SNF1 with a snf1::URA3 fragment derived from pST70 (25Thompson-Jaeger S. Francois J. Gaughran J.P. Tatchell K. Genetics. 1991; 129: 697-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains TYY458 and TYY459 were created by disrupting CAT8 in strains TYY203 (ADR1) and TYY204 (adr1âµ1::LEU2) with a PCR fragment generated from a KANR disruption cassette present in plasmid pUG6 (26Guldener U.

Fink J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 1-863PubMed Google Scholar). To maintain selection for plasmids containing TRP1, 0.1% casamino acids was added rather than trp- drop-out solution. For repressed growth conditions, glucose was present at 2.5%. For growth in derepressing conditions, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation when they reached an A 600 of 1.0 and resuspended in medium containing 0.05% glucose. The cells were harvested 6 h later by centrifugation and washed with 1/10 volume of cold H2O. DNA Microarray AnalysesâCy3- and Cy5-labeled probes were prepared from poly(A) RNA and hybridized to yeast open reading frame (ORF) microarrays as described previously (28Ideker T. Thorsson V. Siegel A.F. Hood L.E. J. Comput. Biol. 2000; 7: 805-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Total yeast RNA was isolated by hot phenol/SDS-glass bead breakage, followed by ethanol precipitation (24Sloan J.S. Dombek K.M. Young E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37575-37582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and treated with DNase I that had been incubated with iodoacetate to inactivate RNase activity. Poly(A)-enriched RNA was isolated using an Oligotex mRNA Purification kit (Qiagen Corp., Valencia, CA). Forward (Cy3-wild-type/Cy5-mutant) and reverse labeling (Cy5-wild-type/Cy3-mutant) comparisons were performed for each experiment using 15 pmol of Cy3 and 25 pmol of Cy5-labeled cDNAs. Three biological replicates of the ADR1 wild-type to âµadr1 mutant comparison and one each of the wild-type to âµsnf1, âµsnf1âµadr1, âµcat8, and âµcat8âµadr1 comparisons were done. The first two âµadr1 experiments utilized low density yeast ORF microarrays prepared as described previously (28Ideker T. Thorsson V. Siegel A.F. Hood L.E. J. Comput. Biol. 2000; 7: 805-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). PCR products from 4608 of the smaller ORFs were spotted in duplicate onto one slide and the remaining 1536 larger ORFs were spotted in duplicate onto a second slide. The third replicate of the âµadr1 experiment and all subsequent experiments utilized high density microarrays that contained 6129 yeast ORFs spotted in duplicate on each slide. These first generation high density microarrays were produced by the Center for Expression Arrays in the Department of Microbiology at the University of Washington (Seattle, WA, ra.microslu.washington.edu/aboutus/about_us.html). Hybridized microarray slides from the first wild-type to âµadr1 comparison experiment were scanned using a Generation II Scanner from Amersham Biosciences. Slides from all subsequent experiments were scanned using a Generation III Scanner (Amersham Biosciences) at the Center for Expression Arrays. Raw spot intensities, local background, and spot quality estimates were extracted from microarray images using the image analysis program Dapple (29Buhler J. Ideker T. Haynor D. University of Washington CSE Technical Report. University of Washington, Seattle2000: 1-12Google Scholar). The raw data were processed using the DNA Microarray Data Processing Pipeline Perl scripts and software developed at the Institute for Systems Biology (Seattle, WA, db.systemsbiology.net/software/ArrayProcess/index.html). Preprocessing of the data to normalize background-subtracted intensities and to calculate log10 ratios was performed as described previously (28Ideker T. Thorsson V. Siegel A.F. Hood L.E. J. Comput. Biol. 2000; 7: 805-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In brief, preprocessed data were subjected to several quality control checks before proceeding further with the analysis. First, the log10 ratio for each spot was plotted against its duplicate on the same array slide. Only data from slides having points clustered about a straight line with a positive slope of approximately 1 were further analyzed. Next, log10 ratios from forward and reverse labeling experiments were plotted against each other. Only data from experiments having points clustered about a straight line with a negative slope of approximately 1 were further analyzed. The data from each experiment were then merged and filtered using Dixon's outlier rejection test. Data from all three biological replicates of the wild-type to âµadr1 mutant comparison were merged into one data set. To identify genes showing significantly different levels of mRNA, a maximum likelihood error model was produced for each data set using the program VERA, and this model was applied to that data set using the program SAM (www.systemsbiology.org/VERAandSAM). SAM uses the model produced by VERA to calculate a maximum likelihood ratio statistic (Î») and a log10 ratio (muRatio) that is corrected for additive and multiplicative errors that arose during the course of the experiment. Each expression ratio presented in this paper is the anti-log of the muRatio. A muRatio of 0.3 or greater, representing a 2-fold or greater difference in mRNA level, was arbitrarily chosen as one criterion of significance. A Î» cutoff value of 44.0 for the low density microarrays and a cutoff value of 27.5 for the high density arrays were chosen as second criteria of significance. These Î» cutoff values were determined from the distribution of Î» values across all genes in a self-hybridization experiment for each type of microarray and represent the Î» value below which 95% of the genes fall in the control experiment. Higher Î» values eliminated many genes already known to be ADR1-dependent. For these control experiments, Cy3-labeled cDNA was prepared from the poly(A) RNA of derepressed wild-type cells and hybridized against Cy5-labeled cDNA prepared from the same poly(A) RNA. Promoter-binding Site AnalysesâUpstream sequences up to 600 bp from the translational start site of each gene were retrieved and analyzed using the Web-based RSA Tools (30van Helden J. Andre B.

Therefore, we developed the Perl script seekw and used it to search for UAS1-like sequences allowing for one mismatch anywhere in the consensus. Both strands of all upstream sequences were searched for matches to each of these patterns. Construction of Reporter PlasmidsâThe base plasmids were pLG669Z (33Guarente L.

The major categories of functionally annotated genes are non-fermentative carbon metabolism, peroxisome biogenesis and Î²-oxidation, amino acid transport and metabolism, sporulation and meiosis, and transcriptional regulation and signal transduction. Thirteen genes are annotated but do not fall into any one of these categories. Thirty percent of the ADR1-dependent genes have unknown functions, similar to the fraction of genes of unknown function in the whole yeast genome. None of the ADR1-dependent genes are essential for growth in rich medium containing glucose as a carbon source, and none of the annotated genes are involved in cell cycle control. This was expected because adr1 mutants have no obvious growth defect in rich medium. ADR1-dependent Genes Channel Metabolites into Acetyl-CoA and NADH Productionâ Fig. 2 illustrates the major pathways of carbon utilization in yeast. The genes that are expressed in an ADR1-dependent manner in derepressed conditions are shown in red boxes with their positive expression ratio, wildtype/adr1. Negative values in green boxes indicate genes whose expression is higher in the absence of ADR1 than in its presence. ADR1-dependent genes figure prominently in pathways leading from ethanol, glycerol, lactate, and the oxidation of fatty acids to the formation of acetyl-CoA, generating NADH in the process. Formate metabolism is also apparently ADR1-dependent based on the strong dependence of FDH1 and FDH2 on ADR1 for expression. Formate and propionate, although unable to support yeast growth, can be co-metabolized with growth-limiting amounts of glucose to produce NADH, thus providing reducing equivalents that increase the growth potential of the cell (36Overkamp K.M.

https://openalex.org/W2067087347,"In syncytial Drosophila embryos, damaged or incompletely replicated DNA triggers centrosome disruption in mitosis, leading to defects in spindle assembly and anaphase chromosome segregation. The damaged nuclei drop from the cortex and are not incorporated into the cells that form the embryo proper. A null mutation in the Drosophila checkpoint kinase 2 tumor suppressor homolog (DmChk2) blocks this mitotic response to DNA lesions and also prevents loss of defective nuclei from the cortex. In addition, DNA damage leads to increased DmChk2 localization to the centrosome and spindle microtubules. DmChk2 is therefore essential for a âmitotic catastropheâ signal that disrupts centrosome function in response to genotoxic stress and ensures that mutant and aneuploid nuclei are eliminated from the embryonic precursor pool."
https://openalex.org/W2062656302,"Individual neurons express only one or a few of the many identified neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, but the molecular mechanisms controlling their selection are poorly understood. In the Drosophila ventral nerve cord, the six Tv neurons express the neuropeptide gene FMRFamide. Each Tv neuron resides within a neuronal cell group specified by the LIM-homeodomain gene apterous. We find that the zinc-finger gene squeeze acts in Tv cells to promote their unique axon pathfinding to a peripheral target. There, the BMP ligand Glass bottom boat activates the Wishful thinking receptor, initiating a retrograde BMP signal in the Tv neuron. This signal acts together with apterous and squeeze to activate FMRFamide expression. Reconstituting this ""code,"" by combined BMP activation and apterous/squeeze misexpression, triggers ectopic FMRFamide expression in peptidergic neurons. Thus, an intrinsic transcription factor code integrates with an extrinsic retrograde signal to select a specific neuropeptide identity within peptidergic cells."

The reduced derivative of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, provides the methyl group for methionine and AdoMet synthesis (2Finkelstein J.D. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 2000; 26: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). A series of rodent experiments as well as epidemiological data have suggested a correlation between diets deficient in folate or in sources of methyl groups (i.e. foods containing methionine, one-carbon compounds, and choline) and the risk for colorectal adenomas and cancer (3Potter J.D. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 2410S-2412SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such diets, referred to collectively as methyl-deficient, have been shown to promote liver cancer in rodents (4Mato J.M. Alvarez L. Ortiz P. Pajares M.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 73: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 5Poirier L.A. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 2336S-2339SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), and AdoMet treatment was shown to prevent the development of liver cancer in rat (6Pascale R. Simile M. De M.M. Feo F. Alcohol. 2002; 27: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In light of the clinical and epidemiological data suggesting a link between AdoMet levels and cancer, it is important to understand the tumor protective mechanism of action of AdoMet, as well as the tumor promoting action of methyl-deficient diets. This is of importance not only for realizing the therapeutic potential of AdoMet, but also for unraveling basic mechanisms of tumorigenesis, especially the role of methyl group metabolism. AdoMet is the cofactor for transmethylation reactions including DNA methylation (7Cheng X. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3784-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 8Chiang P.K.

Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 77: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). A current model is that exogenous administration of AdoMet increases the intracellular ratio of AdoMet to AdoHcy, thus stimulating DNMT activity resulting in increased DNA methylation (6Pascale R. Simile M. De M.M. Feo F. Alcohol. 2002; 27: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Garcea R. Daino L. Pascale R. Simile M.M. Puddu M. Ruggiu M.E. Seddaiu M.A. Satta G. Sequenza M.J. Feo F. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 1183-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). An increase in AdoHcy concentrations, even without a concomitant reduction in AdoMet results in inhibition of DNMT and DNA hypomethylation (11Caudill M.A. Wang J.C. Melnyk S. Pogribny I.P.

Methyl-deficient diets decrease intracellular AdoMet concentration, increase AdoHcy concentrations, and trigger DNA hypomethylation (5Poirier L.A. J.

A genetic link was established between polymorphisms in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene encoding the enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and DNA hypomethylation (14Stern L.L.

Global hypomethylation of DNA is a hallmark of cancer (16Ehrlich M. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 2424S-2429SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Feinberg A.P. Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C. Ehrlich M. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1159-1161PubMed Google Scholar). If the mechanism of action of methyl-rich diets in cancer chemoprevention and methyl-deficient diets in cancer promotion is through changing genomic methylation status, then it implies that global hypomethylation plays a causal role in cancer. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that 5-azacytidine, a DNMT inhibitor (18Jones P.A. Taylor S.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 85-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar) can reverse AdoMet-mediated chemoprevention of liver carcinogenesis (19Pascale R. Simile M.M. Ruggiu M.E.

Although it has been controversial, there is now little doubt (1Lu S.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) that exogenous AdoMet increases the intracellular AdoMet levels. AdoMet uptake into cells has also been verified through a high performance liquid chromatography analysis (20Watson W.H. Zhao Y. Chawla R.K. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A number of data support the notion that exogenous AdoMet causes hypermethylation of DNA (10Garcea R. Daino L. Pascale R. Simile M.M. Puddu M. Ruggiu M.E. Seddaiu M.A. Satta G. Sequenza M.J. Feo F. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 1183-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 21Fuso A. Cavallaro R.A. Orru L. Buttarelli F.R. Scarpa S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Whereas this model provides an attractively simple explanation as to the possible relationship between exogenous AdoMet administration and DNA methylation, there are a number of unresolved issues. First, increased AdoMet should increase DNMT activity only if the normal intracellular concentration of AdoMet is below the Km for the enzyme, this has not been demonstrated as of yet. It is, however, possible that the main mechanism by which elevating AdoMet levels increases DNMT activity is by competing with AdoHcy, an inhibitor of DNMT. Such an indirect mechanism of activation might be relevant even if the basal level of AdoMet is above the Km. Second, even if exogenous administration of AdoMet increases the activity of DNMT, it is not clear whether the normal level of enzyme is limiting, or whether the specificity of DNA methylation patterns is determined by the molecular activity of DNMT. There is no evidence to suggest that specific sites remain unmethylated in vertebrate genomes simply for the reason that the molecular activity of DNMT is limiting. Third, methyl-deficient diets cause hypomethylation in the liver whose cells are mostly postmitotic and do not replicate (5Poirier L.A. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 2336S-2339SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). If the mechanism of this hypomethylation involves only inhibition of DNMT, it could take effect only in cells that actively synthesize DNA. Because measurable demethylation is seen with these diets, this could only occur if a significant fraction of liver cells proliferate during the treatment. Whereas an increase in proliferation in the liver is seen as a consequence of methyl-deficient diets, it is not clear whether proliferation precedes or follows global hypomethylation. The current hypothesis on the mechanism of action of AdoMet is based on the assumption that DNA methylation is a unidirectional and irreversible reaction, which is catalyzed by DNMT exclusively. However, an increasing list of data supports the hypothesis that DNA methylation in vivo is also fashioned by demethylase activity (22Oswald J. Engemann S. Lane N. Mayer W. Olek A. Fundele R. Dean W. Reik W. Walter J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 475-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). A DNA demethylase activity was partially purified from human lung carcinoma A549 cells (23Ramchandani S. Bhattacharya S.K. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6107-6112Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and the protein MBD2b was shown to bear demethylase activity (24Bhattacharya S.K. Ramchandani S. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Nature. 1999; 397: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). The demethylase activity of MBD2 was disputed by several groups (25Ng H.H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 26Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar), but our recent data demonstrated that ectopic MBD2/dMTase causes DNA demethylation in a promoter-specific manner (27Detich N. Theberge J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35791-35794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We therefore proposed that DNA methylation is a reversible reaction, and that the steady state DNA methylation status of a gene reflects a balance of methylation and demethylation (28Szyf M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 350-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 29Szyf M. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D599-D609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that AdoMet increases methylation by inhibiting demethylation. It is impossible to determine whether hypermethylation of a gene in vivo following chronic drug treatment is caused by either an increase in DNMT activity, as proposed by the current model, or inhibition of demethylase. A model system is required to study either methylation or demethylation in isolation from the reverse activity. We have recently described such a model (Fig. 1). When an unmethylated CMV-GFP plasmid is transiently transfected into the human embryonal kidney cell line HEK 293, it remains unmethylated throughout the transient transfection period up to 96 h, demonstrating that DNMTs do not target extrachromosomal DNA under the conditions of our experiment (30Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-44087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). When an in vitro methylated CMV-GFP plasmid is transiently transfected into these cells, it generally remains methylated. However, when histone acetylation is induced by trichostatin A (TSA), the plasmid is fully and actively demethylated by an endogenous demethylase activity. Because the plasmid does not replicate during the time frame of the experiment, this assay measures only active demethylation (30Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-44087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). This system thus allows us to determine the impact that different factors might have on demethylase activity. We have recently used this assay to illustrate that a protein that inhibits histone acetylation inhibits active demethylation in living cells (31Cervoni N. Detich N. Seo S.B. Chakravarti D. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25026-25031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In this paper we took advantage of this assay to test the hypothesis that exogenous administration of AdoMet inhibits demethylase activity in living cells. Using an in vitro demethylase assay, we then tested whether AdoMet inhibits both recombinant MBD2/dMTase activity extracted from infected Sf9 insect cells, as well as endogenous demethylase activity from HEK 293 cells. Taken together, our results support a new alternative hypothesis for the mechanism of action of AdoMet as a DNA hypermethylating agent. CMV-GFP (pEGFP-C1 from Clontech; GenBankTM accession number U55763) was methylated in vitro by incubating 10 Î¼g of plasmid DNA with 12 units of SssI CpG methyltransferase (New England Biolabs) in the recommended buffer containing 800 Î¼m AdoMet for 3 h at 37 Â°C. Twelve units of SssI and 0.16 Î¼mol of AdoMet were then added and the reaction was further incubated for 3 additional hours. The methylated plasmid was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and complete methylation was confirmed by observing full protection from HpaII digestion. Human embryonal kidney HEK 293 cells (ATCC CRL 1573) were plated at a density of 7.5 Ã 104/well in a 6-well dish and transiently transfected with 80 ng of CMV-GFP (methylated or mock methylated) using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (32Rouleau J. Tanigawa G. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7368-7377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 0.3 Î¼m TSA was added 24 h post-transfection. After an additional 24 h, cells were treated with or without various concentrations of AdoMet or AdoHcy (2â8 mm). Cells were harvested 72 h post-transfection. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and experiments were performed several times using different cultures of HEK 293 cells. Whole cell extracts were prepared using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer according to the Santa Cruz Biotechnology protocol, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). 2.5 Î¼g of protein were resolved on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). After blocking the nonspecific binding with 5% skim milk, GFP protein was detected using rabbit polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz, sc-8334) at 1:500 dilution, followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) at 1:5000, and enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were stained with 0.2% Ponceau S (Sigma) to determine loading of total protein in each lane. Both the Western blots and Ponceau-stained membranes were quantified using NIH Image 1.62 software, and the GFP signal was normalized to the total protein (which varied only slightly) in each lane. DNA was extracted from HEK 293 cells using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen). DNA was first digested with 50 units of EcoRI, followed by digestion with 20 units of either HpaII or MspI restriction enzymes. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and then transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were probed with a 32P-labeled CMV-GFP cDNA probe (AvaII-Cfr101 fragment) synthesized using a random priming labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics). Membranes were hybridized at 68 Â°C for 4â6 h in a buffer containing 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 7% SDS, and 0.2 mg/ml herring sperm DNA. Following hybridization, the membranes were washed twice for 10 min in a 5% SDS, 0.04 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA solution, and then four times for 10 min in the same solution containing 1% SDS. The demethylation assay measures the fraction of GFP molecules that were demethylated using HpaII restriction enzyme, which cleaves unmethylated CCGG but does not cleave methylated CCGG sequences. The methylated GFP DNA remains intact following HpaII digestion and is identical to the fragment obtained following EcoRI digestion (indicated by M in Fig. 2B), whereas the unmethylated GFP DNA is cleaved by HpaII resulting in a 0.5-kb fragment (indicated by U in Fig. 2B). We scanned each HpaII digested lane and measured the intensity of the total signal hybridizing with the GFP probe in the same HpaII lane (including the unmethylated U and methylated M fragments), this value is equal to 100% of GFP molecules in the lane. We then determined the intensity of the unmethylated signal per HpaII lane, and divided this value (U) by the total signal for GFP (U + M) in the same HpaII lane. To exclude the possibility that the HpaII digestion was skewed by differences in loading, we used the ethidium bromide-stained gels as loading controls for the corresponding Southern blots. We normalized the values obtained upon the calculation [M/(U + M)] Ã 100 to the amount of DNA in each HpaII lane as determined by quantification of the ethidium bromide-stained gels by NIH Image 1.62. The results of three independent experiments were quantified by densitometry (NIH Image 1.62). AdoMet was prepared as a 50 mm solution in distilled water by dissolving lyophilized powder (Sigma) in distilled water. AdoHcy was purchased from Sigma and dissolved in distilled water at a 50 mm concentration. A fragment containing human MBD2/dMTase was excised from pCR2.1-dMTase (24Bhattacharya S.K. Ramchandani S. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Nature. 1999; 397: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) with BamHI and XhoI and transferred to the Baculovirus expression transfer vector pBlueBacHis2 C (Invitrogen). PBlueBacHis2 C-MBD2/dMTase and Bac-N-Blue viral DNA were cotransfected into the Sf9 insect cell line, and recombinant viruses were isolated, identified, and amplified according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen) with no modifications. High titer P3 viral stocks were used for infections. Insect Sf9 cells were cultured in spinner flasks to a density of 2.5 Ã 106 cells/ml in Grace's insect cell culture medium supplemented (1Ã) from Invitrogen. For infection, 5 Ã 106 cells were plated in 10-cm tissue culture plates (Sarstedt) and allowed to settle and attach for 30 min. The culture medium was removed and was replaced with 10 ml of the same medium containing MBD2/dMTase virus at a multiplicity of infection of 10. The cells were cultured with the virus for 5 days at 27 Â°C and were then harvested by scraping in cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets from 10 plates were frozen and kept at -70 Â°C until they were used for enzyme purification. Frozen pellets were thawed in 5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm imidazole) containing 1 Î¼g/ml of the following protease inhibitors: aprotinin, leupeptin, and Pefablock. Protease inhibitors were added to all the solutions used in the purification. The homogenates were subjected to two cycles of freezing and thawing (5 min per step). DNA in the homogenate was sheered by passing through an 18.5-gauge needle 10 times. The extracts were then subjected to 15 cycles of sonication (10 s burst, 10 s gap per cycle at 20% of maximal output). The extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 Ã g for 35 min. The supernatant was transferred into a fresh tube and was recentrifuged for additional an 25 min at 15,000 Ã g. The extract was filtered through a 5-micron filter to remove any particulate matter and the buffer was exchanged on a PD-10 buffer exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) with buffer L (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2) containing 50 mm NaCl. Recombinant MBD2/dMTase was partially purified by Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) ion exchange chromatography. Q-Sepharose beads (1 ml of swollen beads) were washed extensively and pre-equilibrated with buffer L containing 50 mm NaCl and divided into 3 equal aliquots. The cell extracts were sequentially bound three times to the 3 aliquots of Q-Sepharose beads in batch in 15-ml tubes by shaking gently on a Nutator for 45 min at 4 Â°C. Following each binding step, the bound beads and unbound supernatant were separated by centrifugation for 2 min at 1000 Ã g and the supernatant was transferred into a new tube and bound with new pre-equilibrated beads. The bound beads from the three binding steps were joined and resuspended in lysis buffer. The beads were washed in batchs 4 times with 5 ml of buffer L + 50 mm NaCl. For each washing step, the beads were incubated with the wash solution for 15 min and then separated from the wash supernatant by centrifugation for 2 min at 1000 Ã g. Following washing, the proteins were eluted in batchs (30 min per step) with a stepwise NaCl gradient in buffer L. Each elution step was analyzed for in vitro demethylase activity and for the presence of the recombinant His-tagged MBD2/dMTase by a Western blot analysis using the anti-Xpress antibody from Invitrogen as previously described. MBD2/dMTase peak elution is at the 0.4 m NaCl step. No demethylase activity was observed in the same fractions prepared in a similar manner from uninfected Sf9 cells. For concentration of the 0.4 m NaCl fraction, a Microcon YM-10 concentrator (Millipore) was used at 3300 Ã g and 4 Â°C. Spinning time varied according to the volume, and was 25 min for 500 Î¼l. 10 Ã 10-cm tissue culture plates of HEK 293 cells were used to prepare cell extracts as outlined in the previous section. Q-Sepharose fractionation was performed also as described above and as previously described (27Detich N. Theberge J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35791-35794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Methylation of SubstrateâTypically, 25 Î¼g of DNA from Micrococcus lysodeikticus (Sigma, Type XI, highly polymerized) were methylated with M.SssI (60 units, New England Biolabs) and AdoMet (3.2 mm, New England Biolabs) in methylation buffer (NEbuffer2, New England Biolabs) in the presence of 50 mm EDTA for 3-4 h at 37 Â°C. Fresh AdoMet (3.2 mm) and enzyme (40 units) were then added before incubating at 37 Â°C for an additional 3â4 h. To achieve complete methylation, methylation was repeated after AdoHcy, which is a product of the methylation reaction and inhibits DNA methylation, and was removed using a Microcon 10 concentrator (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The degree of methylation was verified by methylation sensitive restriction enzyme analysis (MspI-HpaII digestion) on aliquots of the reaction mixture. The DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction (one part of either phenol or chloroform per three parts reaction mixture). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by a Nap5 gel filtration chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) column. The Nap5 column was equilibrated with demethylation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0). DNA containing fractions were combined, concentrated on a Microcon 10, and subjected to a second Nap5 desalting column. DNA containing fractions were again concentrated as described above. [Î±-32P]dGTP Labeling of DNAâWe then prepared either methylated or unmethylated DNA that is 32P-labeled at G, the 3â² neighbor of the methylated C, as previously described (33Szyf M. Bhattacharya S.K. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 200: 155-161PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 5 Î¼g of either methylated or unmethylated DNA in 35 Î¼l of double distilled water were denatured and annealed to a hexanucleotide primer by boiling for 10 min in the presence of 3 Î¼l of random hexanucleotide mixture (0.2 A260) (Roche Diagnostics). The primed DNA was then subjected to template-directed extension with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of labeled [Î±-32P]dGTP, either methyl-dCTP (for methylated DNA) or dCTP for unmethylated DNA, dTTP, and dATP. The 3â² phosphate of all the 5â² neighbors of G including either C or methyl-C is labeled by this procedure. The labeling was performed in polymerase buffer (50 mm NaCl, 6.6 mm Tris-HCl, 6.6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) with Klenow fragment I (10 units, Roche Diagnostics), methyl-dCTP (1 mm), and dCTP (1 mm), respectively, dATP, dTTP (1 mm each), and [Î±-32P]dGTP (50 Î¼Ci, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 3 h at 37 Â°C. The reaction mixture was extracted with phenol and chloroform (one part of each per three parts reaction mixture). Trichloroacetic acid precipitation (2 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid, 20 Î¼g of herring sperm DNA) of an aliquot showed typically 80â95% labeling efficiency (260,000â320,000 cpm/Î¼l, total of 150 Î¼l). The DNA was purified by eluting it twice from a Nap5 column and concentrating on a Microcon 10 as described above with the following variation: distilled water was used for prewashing and elution in the second column. The final concentration was 5 ng/Î¼l and the specific activity was typically 8.0â8.8 Ã 106 cpm/Î¼g. A typical reaction mixture (50 Î¼l) consisted of 25 ng of 32P-prelabeled DNA (prepared as described above) incubated in demethylation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0) with either the purified MBD2/dMTase (5 Î¼l, â¼5 ng) or the purified demethylase activity from HEK 293 cells (5 Î¼l) for 24 h at 37 Â°C in either the absence or presence of AdoMet and AdoHcy, respectively. The DNA was extracted from the enzyme by incubation in 2 volumes of DNA extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% SDS) containing 0.1 unit of proteinase K (Roche Diagnostics) at 50 Â°C for 2 h. Subsequent phenol-chloroform extraction (one part of either phenol or chloroform per three parts of reaction volume) in the presence of tRNA (50 Î¼g) as a carrier and ethanol precipitation with salt and 95% ethanol resulted in almost quantitative recovery of the input DNA. The DNA pellets were resuspended in distilled water (8 Î¼l) and digested with microccocal nuclease to 32P-labeled 3â² mononucleotides as described elsewhere (27Detich N. Theberge J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35791-35794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 33Szyf M. Bhattacharya S.K. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 200: 155-161PubMed Google Scholar). The labeled mononucleotides were separated by thin layer chromatography and visualized by autoradiography on a phosphorimaging plate, and the levels of cytosine (C) and 5-methylcytosine (mC) were quantified by the MCID-M4 software (Imaging Research Inc.). The percent demethylation (C/(C + mC)) was calculated per each sample and then normalized to the value obtained for the demethylase reaction in the absence of inhibitor (0 mm AdoMet/AdoHcy). AdoMet Inhibits TSA-induced Active Demethylation of Ectopically Methylated and Transiently Transfected CMV-GFP in a Dose-dependent MannerâThere have been several reports demonstrating that exogenous administration of AdoMet leads to DNA hypermethylation (19Pascale R.

Similarly, other studies have shown that a decrease in dietary folate, or a depletion of intracellular AdoMet, results in DNA hypomethylation (6Pascale R. Simile M. De M.M. Feo F.

https://openalex.org/W2064123540,"Hsp70 of the mitochondrial matrix (mtHsp70) provides a critical driving force for the import of proteins into mitochondria. Tim44, a peripheral inner-membrane protein, tethers it to the import channel. Here, regulated interactions were found to maximize occupancy of the active, adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-bound mtHsp70 at the channel through its intrinsic high affinity for Tim44, as well as through release of adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-bound mtHsp70 from Tim44 by the cofactor Mge1. A model peptide substrate rapidly released mtHsp70 from Tim44, even in the absence of ATP hydrolysis. In vivo, the analogous interaction of translocating polypeptide would release mtHsp70 from the channel. Consistent with the ratchet model of translocation, subsequent hydrolysis of ATP would trap the polypeptide, driving import by preventing its movement back toward the cytosol."

This oxidized amino acid is associated with a distinct subset of proteins, including an over-representation of complex I subunits as well as complex V subunits and enzymes involved in redox metabolism. No relationship was observed between the tryptophan modification and methionine oxidation, a known artifact of sample handling.

A by-product of oxidative phosphorylation in normally respiring mitochondria is the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; Epep, peptide expect score; LC/LC/MS/MS, two-dimensional liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry; SDG, sucrose density gradient fractionation; VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channel isoform; PHB, proteins that hold badly formed subunits; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; TOF, time of flight.1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; Epep, peptide expect score; LC/LC/MS/MS, two-dimensional liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry; SDG, sucrose density gradient fractionation; VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channel isoform; PHB, proteins that hold badly formed subunits; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; TOF, time of flight. If left unchecked, ROS can cause radical-induced damage to proteins, lipids and nucleic acids (1Stadtman E.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 928: 22-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), and elevated oxidative stress has been implicated as a major contributing factor to degenerative diseases and aging (2Droge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7412) Google Scholar). Defects in the enzymes associated with scavenging of ROS, such as manganese superoxide dismutase, can have catastrophic consequences for the cell and result in the onset of degenerative pathology (3Lebovitz R.M.

Relatively few post-translationally modified products of oxidative damage in mitochondria have been characterized. Those that have been identified come from mitochondria or proteins that have been exposed to simulated oxidative stress in vitro such as peroxynitrite-mediated nitration of a critical tyrosine residue in manganese superoxide dismutase (5Yamakura F.

Corresponding MALDI spectra were manually inspected. The oxidation of tryptophan to N-formylkynurenine in proteins has been known for over 35 years since Previero and co-workers (13Previero A. Coletti-Previero M.A. Jolles P. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 24: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) described it in hen's egg-white lysozyme in anhydrous formic acid. Kuroda and co-workers (14Kuroda M. Sakiyama F. Narita K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1975; 78: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) subsequently found that inactivation of lysozyme by ozone in aqueous solution occurred only when one critical tryptophan residue was oxidized, thus providing the first evidence that oxidation of a specific tryptophan residue can impair enzyme function. These early reports relied on identification of the tryptophan oxidation products by characteristic electronic absorption spectra. Finley and co-workers (15Finley E.L. Dillon J. Crouch R.K.

MS/MS spectrometry was used to identify oxidized amino acid sites by +16, +32, and +4 atomic mass unit increases in the molecular mass of peptide fragment ions containing tryptophan residues. Structures corresponding to those mass shifts are shown in Fig. 1. Other reports have noted +16 and +32 atomic mass unit modifications to peptides containing tryptophan residues from tryptic in-gel protein digests. They have discussed the merits of including these modifications in both peptide mass fingerprinting (16Karty J.A. Ireland M.M. Brun Y.V. Reilly J.P. J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), was also present in the digests of human lens. Although it could not be demonstrated unequivocally whether oxidation occurred during sample handling or in vivo, the authors noted that all sites of crystallin oxidation that they found had been reported previously in the literature (15Finley E.L. Dillon J. Crouch R.K. Schey K.L. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Very recently, Anderson and co-workers (21Anderson L.B. Maderia M. Ouellette A.J. Putnam-Evans C. Higgins L. Krick T. MacCoss M.J. Lim H. Yates III, J.R. Barry B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have been studying modifications to complex I subunits in bovine heart mitochondria in response to the oxidative stress caused by peroxynitrite treatment in vitro and have found evidence of oxidized tryptophan in several subunits, both by MALDI-TOF and by LC/MS/MS. However, we were surprised to discover that the relative intensities of the peaks in the MALDI spectra corresponding to peptides containing N-formylkynurenine were also high in untreated mitochondria from some bovine and human heart preparations, although there was substantial variation. Prior to complex I isolation and electrophoresis, mitochondria were prepared identically from all hearts which were freshly collected, frozen, and thawed immediately prior to analysis. Fig. 2 shows the MALDI spectra of peptides from the human complex I subunit, NDUFS4, and its bovine homologue from five different preparations corresponding to seven different hearts (five human, including one pooled sample of mitochondria from three individual hearts, and two bovine hearts). The relative intensities of m/z 1329.6 and 1361.6 (corresponding to peptides without and with dioxidized tryptophan; Fig. 2A) and 1112.5 and 1128.5 (corresponding to peptides without and with oxidized methionine; Fig. 2B) were used as a rough measure of protein oxidation. It was found that there is no correlation between the extent of tryptophan and methionine oxidation, thereby suggesting that they occur via different mechanisms. The dioxidation of tryptophan is clearly discernable in Fig. 2A, i and ii, in which complex I was purified by different methods, sucrose density gradient centrifugation or immunoprecipitation, respectively, but corresponds to mitochondria from the same human heart. This finding suggests that the method of preparation is not a factor in determining the extent of oxidation but rather that it is a characteristic of the donor from which it was obtained (in this case, a 41-year-old male Caucasian who died of brain cancer). The other human donor, displaying far less extensive oxidation of tryptophan as seen in Fig. 2A, iii, was a 62-year-old female Caucasian who died of intracranial bleeding. In contrast, NDUFS4 from a pool of mitochondria from three human hearts displayed an extensively oxidized tryptophan-containing peptide (Fig. 2A, iv) (9Taylor S.W. Fahy E. Zhang B. Glenn G.M.

Again the degree of oxidation in the pooled sample was not commensurate with the degree of oxidation for the methionine-containing fragment (Fig. 2B, iv). Having just completed an extensive survey of the mitochondrial proteome including the acquisition of over 800,000 MS/MS spectra identifying more than 600 distinct gene products (9Taylor S.W. Fahy E.

Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), we were prompted to search for the distribution of the oxidative modification by reanalyzing the data with N-formylkynurenine selected as a differential modification of tryptophan (+32 atomic mass units) using the Sonar MS/MS algorithm (12Field H.I. Fenyo D. Beavis R.C. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 36-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Table I lists all N-formylkynurenine-containing peptides found with peptide expect scores (Epep) values of â¤1 Ã 10â2 (99% confidence). Of this list of 51 peptide sequences from 39 proteins, nine subunits of complex I had N-formylkynurenine-containing tryptic peptides including a newly discovered subunit neuronal protein (NP17.3) (11Murray J.G. Zhang B. Taylor S.W. Oglesbee D. Fahy E. Marusich M.F. Ghosh S.S. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13619-13622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We used this subset of proteins to compare tryptophan oxidation versus methionine oxidation as a function of the ability to observe a peptide in any given LC/MS/MS experiment. In Fig. 3, we have plotted the number of distinct peptides containing tryptophan (A) and methionine (B) for a given complex I subunit which had a Sonar MS/MS Epep score of â¤1 Ã 10â2, and on that plot we have indicated whether the corresponding oxidized residue was observed. Methionine oxidation appears to be related directly to the number of observable peptides, as would be expected if oxidation were a random sample-handling artifact. In contrast, tryptophan oxidation appears much more specific to selected subunits, with the greatest modification being noted for NDUFV1 (51-kDa flavoprotein 1) and NDUFA9 (a 39-kDa reductase/isomerase subunit). In addition, five subunits of the iron-protein component are oxidized, polypeptides that would be expected to be in proximity to centers of ROS generation.Table IPeptides containing doubly oxidized tryptophan throughout the cardiac mitochondrial proteomePeptideEpepGIProtein descriptionVFEISPFEPwITR1.40E-056681764NDUFA9FGPIPLGSLGwK2.30E-046681764NDUFA9wLSAEIEDVKPAK1.80E-036681764NDUFA9HAGGVTGGwDNLLAVIPGGSSTPLIPK2.10E-0420149568NDUFV1GDARPAEIDSLwEISK9.40E-0420149568NDUFV1GPDwILGEIK2.40E-0320149568NDUFV1LAALPENPPAIDwAYYK3.20E-055453559ATPase d F0TIDwVAFAEIIPQNQK2.10E-035453559ATPase d F0YPYwPHQPIENL7.20E-035453559ATPase d F0wVVIGDENYGEGSSR8.40E-083600098Aconitase precursorVAEKEGwPLDIR4.00E-043600098Aconitase precursorLwISNGGLADIFTVFAK2.90E-0618044943Acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, very long chainIFGSEAAwK3.90E-0318044943Acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, very long chainALGVLAQLIwSR1.10E-054758076Citrate synthase precursorDYIwNTLNSGR7.10E-044758076Citrate synthase precursorKLETAVNLAwTAGNSNTR1.60E-054507879VDAC-1wNTDNTLGTEITVEDQLAR5.30E-034507879VDAC-1VVDGAVGAQwLAEFR4.70E-0517458911Dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferaseVPEANSSwMDTVIR6.60E-0417458911Dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferaseSAVTALwGK3.70E-034504349Î²-GlobinLLVVYPwTQR4.30E-034504349Î²-GlobinRPPEPTTPwQEDPEPEDENLYEK6.80E-0813938442Neuronal protein (NP17.3)NLTQYSwLLDGFPR1.00E-0619923437Adenylate kinase 3, alpha-likeFDLNSPwEAFPVYR2.10E-0511360206NDUFS3IASGLGLAwIVGR2.60E-054758714Microsomal glutathione S-transferase 3GYIVIEDLwK2.90E-0512001992Brain my025ASSTSPVEISEwLDQK4.00E-054503607Electron transfer flavoprotein alpha polypeptideGRPTSTNPIASIFAwTR6.40E-054504575Isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (NADP+), mitochondrialGLLTYTSwEDALSR1.40E-0421411235NDUFS1IPwFQYPIIYDIR1.90E-046005854D-prohibitinGLSDGEwQLVLNVwGK2.50E-04229361MyoglobinASwSSLSMDEK3.00E-045921895Cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV, isoform 1LDDLVNwAR5.30E-0421750696NDUFS7TLLwTELFR7.80E-044505371NDUFS8SYGANFSwNK8.70E-0413528960NDUFS4ASLHALVGSPIIwGGEPR9.90E-0413676336Long-chain acyl-coA thioesterase peroxisomalwEVADLQPQLK1.20E-0321903482Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex core protein 2YEGFFSLwK1.30E-0321361114Mitochondrial carrier; oxoglutarate carrierLITTQQwLIK1.40E-0313272660ATP synthase 6LWEPLVEEPPADQwK1.50E-034826848NDUFA5IDEAILITwTK2.00E-0315991833Hexokinase 1wDGQETTLVR3.30E-03458862Fatty acid-binding protein, heart (hFABP)HwLDSPwPGFFTLDGQPR3.40E-03205415922-Oxoglutarate dehydrogenase E1 component, mitochondrial precursorAwNGSAEGPGKVER4.30E-0321754001Unnamed protein productELwFSDDPNVTK4.70E-034757732Programmed cell death 8 (apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF))EQwDTIEELIR5.30E-0345033012,4-Dienoyl CoA reductase 1 precursorGAwSNVLR5.30E-0386754Carrier adenine nucleotide translocasewYYNAAGFNK5.30E-035454152Ubiquinol cyctochrome c reductase (ubiquinone-binding protein) (VI)ELDSITPEVLPGwK5.50E-038131894MitofilinAPLAEEwDNMTMK8.10E-034505093Monoamine oxidase BLATFwYYAK9.10E-0322096328ATP synthase G chain, mitochondrial Open table in a new tab Interestingly, the next most oxidized of the components of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery is complex V, site of proton pumping and phosphorylation of ADP to ATP but not necessarily directly associated with redox chemistry. Three subunits with oxidized tryptophan residues were observed in complex V, the most oxidized being subunit d. Interestingly, a homologous peptide from subunit d was also reported to contain N-formylkynurenine by Bienvenut and co-workers (17Bienvenut W.V. Deon C. Pasquarello C. Campbell J.M. Sanchez J.C. Vestal M.L. Hochstrasser D.F. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 868-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) in bovine heart, suggesting that there may be a specificity for tryptophan oxidation in certain sequences across species as observed in Fig. 2A for NDUFS4. We also note that the three oxidized subunits come from the membrane-bound F0 component of the complex and not from the subunits of the F1 component, e.g. ATP synthase subunits Î± and Î² that yield far more tryptic peptides (22Taylor S.W. Warnock D.E. Glenn G.M. Zhang B. Fahy E. Gaucher S.P. Capaldi R.A. Gibson B.W. Ghosh S.S. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In plant mitochondria, these latter subunits are proteolytically degraded following hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress (7Sweetlove L.J. Heazlewood J.L. Herald V. Holtzapffel R. Day D.A. Leaver C.J. Millar A.H. Plant J. 2002; 32: 891-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Only two oxidized peptides were observed for complex III subunits (ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase), one from complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) and none for complex II (succinate dehydrogenase). A recent report on the crystal structure of the bacterial analogue of mitochondrial complex II has revealed that the redox centers are arranged in a manner that prevents generation of ROS at the flavin adenine dinucleotide (23Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Tornroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Leger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The absence of oxidized tryptophan in complex II, therefore, supports our hypothesis that the degree of tryptophan oxidation reflects the exposure of proteins to ROS-generating sites. The remainder of Table I is dominated by redox proteins and certain metalloproteins (including globin contaminants) that may be exposed to ROS or are susceptible to Fenton chemistry. The outer mitochondrial membrane protein, VDAC 1 (voltage-dependent anion channel isoform 1), was also reported to be susceptible to tryptophan oxidation by Thiede and co-workers (18Thiede B. Lamer S. Mattow J. Siejak F. Dimmler C. Rudel T. Jungblut P.R. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 14: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Based upon the m/z of the mono-oxidized tryptic peptide reported, the sequence is identical to the VDAC 1 peptide reported by us in Table I (KLETAVNLAWTAGNSNTR). This result would suggest that the susceptible sequence is independent of tissue type, as human Jurkat T cells were examined in that study. Adenine nucleotide translocase also exhibits susceptibility to tryptophan oxidation in the sequence list in Table I and, together with VDAC, forms part of the permeability transition pore (24Crompton M. Barksby E. Johnson N. Capano M. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) that is modulated by oxidative stress (25Fleury C. Mignotte B. Vayssiere J.L. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). The presence of d-prohibitin is interesting in view of its proposed role as a part of a complex that acts as a molecular chaperone for mitochondrial respiratory complex assembly (26Nijtmans L.G. Artal S.M. Grivell L.A. Coates P.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Nijtmans et al. (26Nijtmans L.G. Artal S.M. Grivell L.A. Coates P.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) named the complex PHB and proposed renaming the protein hPHB2 to better reflect its function, i.e. proteins that hold badly formed subunits. Given that our results suggest that PHB may be in the proximity of a site of ROS generation, it is tempting to speculate that, in addition to targeting improperly processed or mutated respiratory complex subunits for proteolytic degradation, the PHB complex may also target mature oxidatively damaged and dysfunctional subunits to mitochondrial proteases. The reason for the presence of other protein classes in Table I, including the two kinases, the apoptosis-inducing factor, and the other proteins of unknown function, remains to be determined. In summary, we have assembled a subset of proteins from cardiac mitochondria that appear to be susceptible to double oxidation of their tryptophan residues. Tryptophan oxidation does not appear to be correlated with methionine oxidation, a known artifact of sample handling. We therefore suggest that this subset of proteins represent hot spots for oxidative modification in respiring mitochondria. We thank Bing Zhang for the acquisition of MALDI spectra."
https://openalex.org/W2074633316,"Entry into mitosis requires the activation of cdk1/cyclin B, while mitotic exit is achieved when the same kinase activity decreases, as cyclin B is degraded. Cyclin B proteolysis is mediated by the anaphase promoting complex, or APC, an E3 ligase that is active at anaphase in mitosis through G1. We have identified a G1 substrate of the APC that we have termed Tome-1, for trigger of mitotic entry. Tome-1 is a cytosolic protein required for proper activation of cdk1/cyclin B and mitotic entry. Tome-1 associates with Skp-1 and is required for degradation of the cdk1 inhibitory tyrosine kinase wee1; Tome-1 therefore appears to be acting as part of an SCF-type E3 for wee1. Degradation of Tome-1 during G1 allows for wee 1 accumulation during interphase, thereby providing a critical link between the APC and SCF pathways in regulation of cdk1/cyclin B activity and thus mitotic entry and exit."

The recently developed FLAP (fluorescence localization after photobleaching) method permits the tracking of one fluorophore after localized photobleaching by using the other as a colocalized reference. Here, by visualizing the ratio of bleached to total molecules, we found that actin was delivered to protruding zones of the leading edge of the cell at speeds that exceeded 5 micrometers per second. Monte Carlo modeling confirmed that this flow cannot be explained by diffusion and may involve active transport."

However, the mechanism by which tmRNA can enter and move through the ribosome is unknown. We present a cryoâelectron microscopy study at â¼13 to 15 angstroms of the entry of tmRNA into the ribosome.

https://openalex.org/W2092904031,"Checkpoints are biochemical pathways that provide the cell with mechanisms to detect DNA damage and respond by arresting the cell cycle to allow DNA repair. The conserved checkpoint kinase Chk1 regulates mitotic progression in response to DNA damage and replication interference by blocking the activation of Cdk1/cyclin B. Chk1 is phosphorylated on Ser-317 and Ser-345 following a checkpoint signal, a process that is regulated by Atr, and by the sensor complexes containing Rad17 and Hus1. We show that Chk1 is associated with chromatin in cycling cells and that the chromatin-associated Chk1 is phosphorylated in the absence of exogenous DNA damage. The UV-induced Ser-345-phosphorylated forms of Chk1 that appear minutes after treatment are predominantly associated with chromatin. The Ser-345 site is in a 14-3-3 consensus binding motif and is required for nuclear retention of Chk1 following an hydroxyurea-induced checkpoint signal; nonetheless, Ser-345 or Ser-317 are not required for the chromatin association of Chk1. Hus1, a member of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen-like damage recognition complex plays a role in the phosphorylation of Chk1 on Ser-345, however, Hus1 is not required for phosphorylation on Ser-317 or for Chk1 localization to chromatin. These results indicate that there is more than one step in Chk1 activation and that the regulation of this checkpoint signaling is achieved at least in part through phosphorylation of Ser-345, which serves to localize Chk1 in the nucleus presumably by blocking Crm1-dependent nuclear export.

The cellular response to DNA damage and replication interference involves the activation of signal transduction pathways known as checkpoints that prevent cell cycle progression and induce the transcription of genes that facilitate DNA repair (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Google Scholar). These responses ensure that DNA replication and chromosome segregation are completed with high fidelity. Defects in checkpoint responses in higher organisms can result in genomic instability, cell death, and a predisposition to cancer (2Cahill D.P. Lengauer C. Yu J. Riggins G.J. Willson J.K. Markowitz S.D. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 392: 300-303Google Scholar). Mammalian checkpoint genes include the tumor suppressor genes P53 and ATM. The Atm protein is required for several aspects of the response to DNA damage including cell cycle arrest and p53 activation following ionizing radiation (3Meyn M.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5991-6001Google Scholar, 4Rotman G. Shiloh Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1555-1563Google Scholar). Atm, Atr, and the DNA-activated kinase (DNA-PKCs), are members of the Atm family of protein kinases. This family includes the checkpoint proteins Mec1 and Tel1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and rad3 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) 1The abbreviations used are: Chk1, checkpoint kinase 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MMS, methylmethane sulfonate; HU, hydroxyurea; GFP, green fluorescent protein. was first identified in S. pombe because of its role in the checkpoint arrest at G2/M (5al-Khodairy F. Fotou E. Sheldrick K.S. Griffiths D.J. Lehmann A.R. Carr A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 147-160Google Scholar, 6Walworth N. Davey S. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 363: 368-371Google Scholar). Chk1 proteins function downstream of the Atm-like proteins in the yeasts and higher eukaryotes to regulate the checkpoint response that prevents chromosome segregation in the presence of DNA damage. In mammalian cells and S. pombe, Chk1 blocks mitotic progression via inactivation of the mitotic inducer Cdc25 (7Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Google Scholar, 8Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Google Scholar, 9Furnari B. Rhind N. Russell P. Science. 1997; 277: 1495-1497Google Scholar). Another conserved kinase that functions downstream of the Atm-like kinases and regulates Cdc25 is Chk2/Cds1. An additional role for Chk2 (hCds1) and Chk1 in mammals is to phosphorylate p53 on Ser-20, Ser-15, and Ser-37 (10Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Appel M. Halazonetis T.D.

The picture of how sensor complexes activate the checkpoint kinases following DNA damage has begun to emerge. Because of their association with DNA and predicted protein structure, at least three complexes have been assigned the role of sensors in yeast and mammals. The Rad17 âclamp loadingâ complex (13Griffiths D.J. Barbet N.C. McCready S. Lehmann A.R. Carr A.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5812-5823Google Scholar), which is associated with replication factor C-like proteins, and the Rad9Â·Hus1Â·Rad1 âclamp-likeâ complex (14Volkmer E. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 567-570Google Scholar, 15St. Onge R.P. Udell C.M. Casselman R. Davey S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1985-1995Google Scholar, 16Kostrub C.F. Knudsen K. Subramani S. Enoch T.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1254-1262Google Scholar), which has been proposed to act like a proliferating cell nuclear antigen clamp are two such complexes. A third complex that contains AtrÂ·Atrip (18Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Google Scholar) requires both the Rad17 and Hus1 complex for activation of the DNA damage response (Ref. 19Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Google Scholar, and references therein). Following recognition or processing of the DNA lesion, the Rad17 complex recruits the Rad9Â·Hus1Â·Rad1 complex to DNA in an analogous mechanism to replication factor C-mediated loading of proliferating cell nuclear antigen onto DNA during DNA replication. Then, the Rad17 protein becomes phosphorylated by Atr (20Bao S. Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Fang Y. Richardson D.A. Ali A. Chen S.M. Abraham R.T. Wang X.F. Nature. 2001; 411: 969-974Google Scholar) in a Hus1-dependent manner (19Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Google Scholar). Rad17 phosphorylation in response to high doses of ionizing radiation is reduced in Atm (â/â) cells, which suggests that Atm complexes interact with Rad17 in a similar manner to Atr complexes in response to ionizing radiation. Recently it has been shown that Atr localizes to chromatin independently of the Rad17 complex; however, the phosphorylation of Atr substrates and thus checkpoint signaling is regulated by the sensor complexes containing Rad17 and Hus1 (18Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Google Scholar, 19Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Google Scholar). These findings led to the model that Rad17 (and Hus1) complexes provide substrate specificity to the central checkpoint kinases Atr and Atm (19Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Google Scholar). All of these stepwise interactions argue that the activation of the response could be lesion, cell cycle, and protein complex specific. Chk1, like Atr, is an essential kinase (21Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J.

Chk1 has been shown to be phosphorylated on Ser-345 following DNA damage (21Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Google Scholar, 25Lopez-Girona A. Tanaka K. Chen X.B. Baber B.A. McGowan C.H. Russell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11289-11294Google Scholar). Phosphorylation on Ser-345 is blocked in cells lacking the Atr kinase (21Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Google Scholar, 24Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Google Scholar), is reduced in cells lacking the Hus1 component of the putative sensor clamp formed with Rad1 and Rad9 (26Weiss R.S. Matsuoka S. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 73-77Google Scholar) and in cells with reduced levels of the Rad17 protein (19Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Google Scholar). Thus, several complexes associated with DNA including the AtrÂ·Atrip complex regulate the phosphorylation of Chk1. Here we show that Chk1 also localizes to chromatin and that phosphorylation of Ser-345 and Ser-317 is likely to take place on the chromatin-associated Chk1. Furthermore, we show that phosphorylation of Ser-345 serves to localize Chk1 in the nucleus presumably by blocking Crm1-dependent nuclear export.

The delivery of morpholinos was carried out essentially according to manufacturer's instructions for special delivery protocol (Gene Tools, LLC). Briefly, the claspin or invert control morpholinos were added to 3 million cells 5 h after seeding in 75-cm2 flasks. Three hours later the cells were plated onto flasks and plates (for UV irradiation). Twenty-four hours after delivery, HU was added to 1 set and 15 h later another set was irradiated with 50 J/m2 UV and harvested 2 h later along with control and HU treated sets. Sequence for claspin-AS was CCTCAGAACCCACCTCGCCTGTCAT and invert claspin control oligo sequence was TACTGTCCGCTCCACCCAAGACTCC. Cellular Fractionation ExperimentsâFor experiments with micrococcal nuclease (Fig. 1A): HeLa cells were collected and washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fractionated as described with minor modifications (27Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Google Scholar). Cells were re-suspended in 200 Î¼l of solution A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors) and incubated for 10 min on ice. Cytoplasmic proteins (C) were separated from nuclei by low-speed centrifugation (1300 Ã g for 4 min at 4 Â°C). Isolated nuclei were re-suspended in 100 Î¼l of solution A containing 1 mm CaCl2 (Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1% wherever mentioned), and the nuclei were left on ice for 5 min. The nuclei were centrifuged as above and the supernatant (N1) was removed. Nuclei were re-suspended in 100 Î¼l of solution A with 1 mm CaCl2 and containing or not 50 units of micrococcal nuclease (Amersham Biosciences), and incubated at 37 Â°C for 10 min before the addition of EGTA and EDTA to 1 mm as final concentration to stop the reaction. Nuclei were pelleted down by the same gentle centrifugation and the supernatant was combined with N1 above. Nuclei were re-suspended in 200 Î¼l of solution B (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). After 30 min incubation on ice, supernatant (N2) were separated from chromatin (Ch) by centrifugation (1700 Ã g for 4 min at 4 Â°C). Isolated chromatin was washed once with solution B and centrifuged at high speed (10,000 Ã g for 1 min at 4 Â°C). Finally, chromatin was re-suspended in 200 Î¼l of 2Ã loading buffer and sheared by sonication (Ch). To compare Chk1 localization on chromatin to that published previously for Atr, fractionation protocols were followed as described (19Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, A and E). HeLa cells either transfected or not and either treated or not with 5 mm HU for 18 h were collected and washed with phosphate-buffered saline and re-suspended in 200 Î¼l of solution A. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%, and the cells were left on ice for 5 min. Cytoplasmic proteins (C) were separated from nuclei (Nu) by low speed centrifugation (1300 Ã g for 4 min at 4 Â°C). An aliquot of the nuclei was saved (Nu). The nuclei were re-suspended in 100 Î¼l of solution A and incubated on ice for 10 min, and pelleted as above. The nuclei were then lysed in 100 Î¼l of solution B. After 30 min incubation on ice, the supernatant (N) was separated from chromatin (Ch) by centrifugation (1700 Ã g for 4 min at 4 Â°C). Isolated chromatin was washed and sonicated as above. The supernatants from the second incubation with solution A and following lysis of nuclei were combined for the SDS-PAGE step (N). All other experiments (Figs. 1B, 3, BâD, and 4, A and B) were carried out using this fractionation protocol except that Triton X-100 was omitted.Fig. 4Chromatin association of Chk1 in Hus1 mutants and in cells treated with antisense oligonucleotides to claspin.A, Hus1â/âp21â/â and Hus1+/+p21â/â mouse embryo fibroblasts were fractionated following treatment or not with either HU or 2 h after 50 J/m2 of UV radiation. The levels of Chk1 were detected with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the murine protein, and the phospho-Chk1 proteins were detected with polyclonal antibodies that detect phospho-Ser-345 and phospho-Ser-317 Chk1. B, chromatin association and phosphorylation of Chk1 following delivery of antisense oligonucleotides to human claspin. HeLa cells were transfected with either an antisense oligo to claspin (Claspin-AS) or a control oligo (Control-AS), one sample was treated with HU 24 h after oligo delivery and one sample was irradiated with 50 J/m2 of UV 39 h after delivery. All samples were collected and fractionated 41 h after oligo delivery, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Chk1, Atr, and phosphorylated Chk1 were detected as in Figs. 1 and 3. Claspin levels were detected with anti-claspin antibody.

The beads were gently precipitated, washed in the same buffer 3 times, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, boiled, and fractionated on SDS-PAGE. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, the Chk1 proteins were detected with anti-Chk1 antibodies that recognize the NH2 terminus of Chk1 (G4, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Crm1 Binding AssaysâEight hundred Î¼g of whole cell extracts prepared from HeLa cells treated with 5 mm HU for 20â24 h were incubated with an equal amount of bacterially expressed GST, GST-hChk1(WT), or GST-hChk1S345A bound to glutathione beads in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 250 ng of Ran-GTP, 2 mm GTP, 20 Î¼m ATP with protease and phosphatase inhibitors for 2 h at 25 Â°C. The beads were gently precipitated and washed 4 times in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20 solution containing all protease inhibitors, and fractionated on SDS-PAGE. After transfer the Crm1 proteins were detected using anti-Crm1 antibodies (H-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitation AssaysâImmunoprecipitation of EYFP-Chk1 was carried out as previously described (7Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Google Scholar) using anti-GFP antibodies (Molecular Probes). Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-Chk1 from 293T cells was carried out by first enriching for chromatin-associated proteins. 293T cells transfected with either CMV-FLAG-Chk1 or pCDNA3.1 were treated or not with 5 mm HU for 18 h, collected, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in solution A (see âCellular Fractionation Experimentsâ). Cytoplasmic proteins were separated from nuclei by low speed centrifugation (1740 Ã g for 4 min at 4 Â°C). Isolated nuclei were washed with solution A and resuspended in solution A containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 150 units of micrococcal nuclease (Sigma), incubated for 1 h at 4 Â°C before stopping by adding 1 mm EGTA as final. Sodium chloride was added to 300 mm final concentration and incubated for 10 min on ice. The nuclear preparation was then sonicated twice for 15 s and cleared by centrifugation at 16,850 Ã g for 15 min at 4 Â°C. The extracts were diluted in Buffer Z (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) with a final concentration of 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (plus phosphatases and proteases inhibitors). The extracts were pre-cleared with Protein A-Sepharose followed by incubation with FLAG affinity resin at 4 Â°C overnight. The proteins were precipitated by gentle centrifugation, washed extensively, and separated on a 4â12% gradient SDS-PAGE. In Vitro Kinase AssaysâImmunoprecipitations of Chk1, Chk1KD, or Chk1S345A were carried out with anti-GFP antibodies and kinase reactions were performed in kinase buffer (15 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP, 20 Î¼m ATP) as previously described (7Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4â12% acrylamide gels. Western Blotting, Data Quantification, and AnalysisâWestern blot analyses were performed as previously described (7Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Google Scholar). Murine and human Chk1 were detected with monoclonal antibody G4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). EYFP fusion proteins were detected with either anti-Chk1 antibodies (G4, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-GFP antibodies (Molecular Probes). Atr (Ab1) and Orc2 (Ab2) were detected with antibodies from Oncogene Research; Crm1, 14-3-3, and p53 (DO1) were detected with antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Claspin was detected with affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies to a peptide encoded in part by exons 11, 12, and 13 of human claspin from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX) and FLAG-Chk1 was detected with antibody (M5) from Sigma. Phospho-Chk1Ser-317 and phospho-Chk1Ser-345 were detected using phospho-specific antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) on proteins transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The enhanced chemiluminescence signals were quantified from exposures in the linear range using NIH Image 1.63. Chk1 Localizes to Chromatin in Cycling CellsâWe have observed that Chk1 protein binds DNA cellulose, double strand breaks, and single strand DNA. 3D. M. Goudelock, M. Maxfield, and Y. Sanchez, unpublished results. There are two likely explanations for how Chk1 would bind to DNA: either Chk1 may be part of a chromatin-associated sensor complex and becomes activated while on chromatin; or Chk1 may be recruited to chromatin upon activation to modulate the checkpoint response and/or DNA repair. The association of Atr, the kinase that acts upstream of Chk1, with chromatin does not depend on a checkpoint signal (19Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Google Scholar, 23Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2745-2756Google Scholar) nor on Rad17 (19Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Google Scholar) indicating that there are two separate complexes that bind DNA in the absence of a checkpoint signal. To test whether Chk1 also binds chromatin in vivo, and whether this association was regulated by a checkpoint signal we carried out cell fractionation experiments. Chk1, like Atr, was associated with the chromatin fraction (Ch) in cycling cells and was removed by incubation of nuclei with micrococcal nuclease as evidenced by its appearance in the nuclear soluble fraction (N1) (Fig. 1A, compare N1 with and without MNase treatment). Concomitant with an increase of Chk1 levels in the soluble nuclear fraction, we observed an increase in the levels of the chromatin-associated Orc2 in the soluble nuclear fraction following treatment with nuclease. The MNase treatment resulted in release of Chk1 to the N1 fraction whereas Orc2 required lysis of the nuclei to be released to the soluble nuclear fraction (N2). This could be because of the size or nature of the proteins or protein complexes. It is possible that Chk1 once released from chromatin could diffuse out of the nucleus, whereas Orc2 complexes could not. These data indicate that a fraction of Chk1 is associated with DNA in the absence of treatment with agents that cause DNA damage or replication blocks. The levels of chromatin-associated Chk1 did not increase dramatically following HU treatment, however, we did observe a slower migrating form of chromatin-associated Chk1, presumably because of phosphorylation (Fig. 1B), which was also detected in the longer exposures of the untreated samples, suggesting that phosphorylated Chk1 associates with chromatin and could possibly become phosphorylated while on chromatin. Chk1 Localizes to the Nucleus during a HU-induced Replication Block and after MMS TreatmentâChk1 localizes to distinct nuclear structures during S phase (7Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Google Scholar, 28Kaneko Y.S. Watanabe N. Morisaki H. Akita H. Fujimoto A. Tominaga K. Terasawa M. Tachibana A. Ikeda K. Nakanishi M. Kaneko Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3673-3681Google Scholar). To determine whether the localization of Chk1 is regulated following a checkpoint-induced response, we generated fusion proteins by attaching EYFP in-frame at the amino terminus of full-length Chk1 proteins, one that retains catalytic activity and another that is catalytically inactive. HeLa cells transfected with the EYFP vector alone or the EYFP fusion constructs were treated or not with HU or MMS, and the subcellular localization of the EYFP and EYFP fusion proteins was determined by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2). EYFP-Chk1 was observed both in the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells (Fig. 2, arrow) with a stronger signal in the nucleus of a small percentage of cells from an asynchronous population (Fig. 2, arrowhead). Following chronic treatment with 5 mm HU (19 h) or 50 Î¼g/ml MMS (4 h), the Chk1 signal was localized in the nucleus (Fig. 2, graph). Because both HU and MMS synchronize cells in S phase, it is possible that the checkpoint signal-induced nuclear localization/retention of Chk1 could be because of a cell cycle-specific effect. The duration of the MMS treatment (4 h) was not sufficient to synchronize the entire population of cells in S phase, 4M. Maxfield and Y. Sanchez, unpublished results. suggesting that the increase in nuclear accumulation of Chk1 was triggered in response to MMS-induced DNA damage. We also examined cells transfected with EYFP-Chk1Î and EYFP-Chk1ÎKD, which are deletion mutants missing the C-terminal 115 amino acids (361â476) that contain two conserved domains present in all Chk1 orthologues. The deletion mutation did not alter the checkpoint-induced localization/retention of Chk1, although an increase in the number of cells with abnormal nuclear and cellular morphologies was observed in the cells transfected with these constructs. 5D. M. Goudelock and Y. Sanchez, unpublished results. These results indicate that the kinase activity and carboxyl-terminal domains contained in the last 115 amino acids of Chk1 are not required for the nuclear localization/retention of Chk1 induced by HU or DNA damage. We also observed the checkpoint-induced nuclear distribution of EYFP-Chk1 in fibroblasts, HT1080 (fibrosarcoma), and MCF7 (breast epithelial origin) cells. 6D. M. Goudelock, K. Jiang, and Y. Sanchez, unpublished results. The checkpoint signal-induced localization of Chk1 is also not altered in cells lacking Atm (â/â),5 indicating that Atm is not required for this response, although these findings do not exclude a redundant role for Atm in this process. Chk1 is phosphorylated on Ser-317 and Ser-345 in response to DNA damage in an Atr-dependent manner (21Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Google Scholar, 24Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Google Scholar); we set out to investigate whether Chk1 nuclear retention and/or its association with chromatin was regulated by serine phosphorylation. Chromatin-associated Chk1 Is Phosphorylated on Ser-317 and Ser-345âWe observed that after HU treatment both the soluble nuclear and chromatin-associated Chk1 contained a slower migrating form, presumably because of phosphorylation (Figs. 1B and 3A). The current model of Chk1 activation predicts that Chk1 is phosphorylated on Ser-345 following Atr activation by the Rad17 and Rad1Â·Hus1Â·Rad9 complexes. We examined the Ser-345 phosphorylation status of the different pools of Chk1 by immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies. Both the chromatin-associated and soluble nuclear pools of Chk1 were phosphorylated on Ser-345 following treatment with HU or 50 J/m2 UV radiation (Fig. 3A). We observed a weak phospho-Ser-345 signal in the chromatin-associated pool of Chk1 from untreated cells that correlated with the slower migrating form of Chk1 in chromatin from these cells (Figs. 1B and 3A). We also observed two forms of Chk1 (faster and slower migrating) that reacted with the phospho-Ser-345 antibody in the soluble nuclear fraction from the treated cells (Fig. 3A), suggesting that Ser-345 is one of at least two checkpoint-induced phosphorylation sites on Chk1. Recently, Chk1 has been shown to be phosphorylated on Ser-317, another Atr consensus site (24Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Google Scholar). Following treatment, the levels of Ser-317 phosphorylation were increased both in the soluble nuclear and chromatin pools of Chk1. We also observed phospho-Ser-317 and phospho-Ser-345 signals in the cytoplasmic fraction aft"
https://openalex.org/W2134958632,"Conversion of cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) into a pathological conformer (PrP(Sc)) is thought to be promoted by PrP(Sc) in a poorly understood process. Here, we report that in wild-type mice, the expression of PrP(C) rendered soluble and dimeric by fusion to immunoglobulin Fcgamma (PrP-Fc(2)) delays PrP(Sc) accumulation, agent replication, and onset of disease following inoculation with infective prions. In infected PrP-expressing brains, PrP-Fc(2) relocates to lipid rafts and associates with PrP(Sc) without acquiring protease resistance, indicating that PrP-Fc(2) resists conversion. Accordingly, mice expressing PrP-Fc(2) but lacking endogenous PrP(C) are resistant to scrapie, do not accumulate PrP-Fc(2)(Sc), and do not transmit disease to others. These results indicate that various PrP isoforms engage in a complex in vivo, whose distortion by PrP-Fc(2) affects prion propagation and scrapie pathogenesis. The unique properties of PrP-Fc(2) suggest that soluble PrP derivatives may represent a new class of prion replication antagonists."

The recombinant protein fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP-lysenin) was expressed in Escherichia coli JM 109 and purified by using amylose resin according to the manufacturer's instruction. Anti-lysenin antiserum was purchased from Peptide Institute. Rabbit anti-MBP antiserum, pMAL-c2X vector, and amylose resin were from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Synthetic peptides corresponding to various domains of lysenin and affinity purified rabbit anti-peptide polyclonal antibodies were provided by CovalAb (Lyon, France). Brain SM, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (diC18:1 PC), dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (diC16:0 PC), egg phosphatidylcholine, liver phosphatidylethanolamine, brain phosphatidylserine (PS), liver phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidic acid, brain ceramide, and brain cerebroside were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Sphingosine, d-erythrosphingosine 1-phosphate, and sphingosylphosphorylcholine were from Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Palmitoylsphingomyelin (C16:0 SM), stearoylsphingomyelin (C18:0 SM), oleoylsphingomyelin (C18:1 SM), and cholesterol were from Sigma. Palmitoleoylsphingomyelin (C16:1 SM) was synthesized from palmitoleic acid (Sigma) and d-erythrosphingosylphosphorylcholine (Matreya, Inc., Pleasant Gap, PA) by oxidation-reduction condensation with triphenylphosphine and 2,2â²-dipyridyl disulfide (19Kishimoto Y. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1975; 15: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (20Koval M. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2169-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Measurement of HemolysisâHemolytic activity of lysenin was measured as described previously (12Yamaji A. Sekizawa Y. Emoto K. Sakuraba H. Inoue K. Kobayashi H. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5300-5306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Sheep erythrocytes were prepared by washing sheep whole blood (Nippon Bio-Supply Center, Tokyo, Japan) with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 137 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4). Erythrocyte suspensions in PBS (3 Ã 107 cells/ml) were incubated with various concentrations of lysenin and then centrifuged at 500 Ã g for 5 min to precipitate the erythrocytes. Aliquots of the supernatants were taken, and the optical densities at 405 nm were measured using a Microplate Reader model 550 (Bio-Rad) to determine the percentage of hemoglobin released from the erythrocytes. Total hemoglobin contents were determined by measuring hemoglobin released after freezing and thawing of the erythrocytes. In Fig. 1E, erythrocytes (3 Ã 107 cells/ml) were treated with various concentrations of lysenin for 30 min at 4 Â°C. The erythrocytes were then washed and further incubated in PBS for 30 min at the indicated temperatures before measurement of hemolysis. To evaluate the equivalent diameter of pores formed by lysenin or streptolysin O (Research Biochemicals International, Natick, MA), osmotic protection experiments were performed (21Bhakdi S. Mackman N. Nicaud J.M. Holland I.B. Infect. Immun. 1986; 52: 63-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hemolysis assay was performed in PBS containing one of the following osmotic protectants: 30 mm sucrose, 30 mm raffinose, 30 mm dextran 4 (Mr 4000 â 6000, Extrasynthese S. A., Genay, France), or 30 mm polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000. On the basis of published data (22Scherrer R. Gerhardt P. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 107: 718-735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the osmotic protectants were assumed to have the following mean molecular diameters: sucrose, 0.9 nm; raffinose, 1.2 to 1.4 nm; dextran 4, 3.0 to 3.5 nm; PEG 4000, 4 nm. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)âBinding of lysenin to SM was evaluated by ELISA as described previously (12Yamaji A. Sekizawa Y. Emoto K. Sakuraba H. Inoue K. Kobayashi H. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5300-5306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 23Makino A. Baba T. Fujimoto K. Iwamoto K. Yano Y. Terada N. Ohno S. Sato S.B. Ohta A. Umeda M.

In brief, 50 Î¼l of lipid (10 Î¼m) in ethanol was added to the well of a microtiter plate (Immulon 1, Thermo Labsystems, Franklin, MA). After the solvent was evaporated at room temperature, 200 Î¼l of 30 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Fraction V, Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) was added to each well. The wells were then washed with Tris-buffered saline at the indicated temperatures and incubated with 50 Î¼l of various concentrations of lysenin in Tris-buffered saline containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 2 h at the indicated temperatures. The bound lysenin was detected by adding anti-lysenin antiserum followed by incubation with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). The intensity of the color developed with o-phenylenediamine as a substrate was measured with a Microplate Reader model 550 (Bio-Rad) reading the absorption at 490 nm with reference at 630 nm. To evaluate the binding of MBP-lysenin to lipids, ELISA was performed at room temperature and anti-MBP antiserum was used to detect the bound MBP-lysenin. Electron MicroscopyâSurface observation of red blood cells with scanning electron microscopy was performed as follows. Erythrocytes (3 Ã 107 cells/ml) were incubated with lysenin for 30 min at 4 Â°C. Cells were then fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min. The fixed cells were adsorbed onto poly-l-lysine-treated glass coverslips, postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated with a graded series of ethanol, and infiltrated with t-butyl alcohol. The specimens were frozen at â20 Â°C and freeze-dried in a freeze dryer (Hitachi ES-2030, Tokyo, Japan) at â10 Â°C. The dried specimens were sputter-coated with Pa/Pt in an ion sputter (Hitachi E-1020, Tokyo, Japan) at 2 nm thickness. The specimens were observed using a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi H-4500, Tokyo, Japan). For negative staining of erythrocytes, cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min, washed with PBS, and stained with 4% aqueous uranyl acetate. The specimens were observed in a transmission electron microscope (Hitachi H-7500, Tokyo, Japan) at acceleration voltage of 80 kV. The negative films were scanned with an image scanner (Epson GT-9600, Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed using public domain software (NIH Image 1.62). MBP-lysenin was employed for immunogold labeling. Sheep erythrocytes (3 Ã 107 cells/ml) were incubated with MBP-lysenin (1 Î¼g/ml) for 30 min at 4 Â°C. The treated cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde + 0.1% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 30 min at 4 Â°C. The fixed cells were then washed 3 times with PBS, once with 50 mm glycine/PBS, and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 60 min at 4 Â°C. The fixed cells were adsorbed onto poly-l-lysine/carbon/formvar-coated nickel. The grids were incubated with rabbit anti-MBP antiserum at 4 Â°C overnight. The grids were washed 8 times with PBS and incubated with 5-nm colloidal gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (British Biocell International, Cardiff, United Kingdom) at 4 Â°C overnight. Then the grids were washed with PBS as above, and fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 10 min. The fixed grids were rinsed with distilled water and negatively stained with 4% aqueous uranyl acetate. These specimens were observed using an electron microscope (Hitachi H-7500, Tokyo, Japan). Control specimens were incubated with bovine serum albumin/PBS instead of primary antiserum. For liposome experiment, multilamellar liposome suspensions in PBS were prepared as described previously (12Yamaji A. Sekizawa Y. Emoto K. Sakuraba H. Inoue K. Kobayashi H. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5300-5306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Liposomes containing 50 nmol of lipids were incubated with 2 Î¼g of lysenin for 30 min at 37 Â°C. The mixtures were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 1 h at 37 Â°C and washed with PBS by centrifugation. The suspension was adsorbed onto poly-l-lysine-treated formvar/carbon-coated copper grids and negatively stained as described above. Calcein Release from LiposomesâMultilamellar liposomes were prepared and liposome lysis assay was performed using calcein as a fluorescent marker, as described previously (12Yamaji A. Sekizawa Y. Emoto K. Sakuraba H. Inoue K. Kobayashi H. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5300-5306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. In brief, lipids were hydrated in 75 mm calcein (Sigma). All liposomes contained 50% mol of cholesterol. Untrapped calcein was removed by centrifugation of the liposome suspensions in PBS. Liposome suspensions containing total 2 Î¼m lipids were incubated with various concentrations of lysenin. The fluorescence of released calcein was monitored using a Jasco FP-6500 spectrofluorometer (Jasco Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with excitation and emission wavelengths at 488 and 517 nm, respectively. 100% release of calcein was determined after freezing and thawing of liposomes. Detection of Lysenin Oligomer by SDS-PAGEâAfter incubation of lysenin with liposomes, the mixture was incubated in SDS sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol for 10 min at 95 Â°C and then applied to SDS-PAGE (7% gel) under denatured conditions (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205516) Google Scholar). The proteins were detected either by silver staining or by Western blotting using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Intrinsic Tryptophan FluorescenceâTryptophan fluorescence of lysenin was measured using a FP-6500 spectrofluorometer equipped with a thermostatic cell holder (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). 20 Î¼g/ml Lysenin was incubated with liposomes (small unilamellar vesicles) containing a total of 50 Î¼m lipids in PBS for 30 min at 37 Â°C. The fluorescence intensity was measured at 25 Â°C with an excitation wavelength at 285 nm. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)âDSC experiments were performed using a MicroCal VP-DSC calorimeter (MicroCal, LLC, Northampton, MA). DSC melting profiles were recorded at a constant heating rate of 1 Â°C/min. The corresponding base lines had been obtained using cells filled with the same amount of the buffer and were subsequently subtracted from the lipid/protein thermograms. The melting temperature, Tm, and the phase transition enthalpy, ÎH, were determined from the first DSC scan. Lysenin Forms 3-nm Diameter Pores in Target Membranesâ Previously it was shown that lysenin causes lysis of erythrocytes from various animal species (12Yamaji A. Sekizawa Y. Emoto K. Sakuraba H. Inoue K. Kobayashi H. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5300-5306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 25Kobayashi H. Sekizawa Y. Shioda S. Natori S. Nakajima T. Umeda M. Korf H.-W. Usadel K.-H. Neuroendocrinology-Retrospect and Perspectives. Springer, Berlin1997: 255-265Google Scholar). The sensitivity to lysenin that differed among species and sheep erythrocytes were the most sensitive. This high sensitivity was presumably attributed to the high content of SM in sheep erythrocytes. As shown in Fig. 1, AâC, lysenin-induced hemolysis was a temperature-dependent process. With high concentrations of lysenin, hemolysis was induced within 1 min at 37 Â°C while it took more than 30 min at 4 Â°C (Fig. 1A). Hemolysis at 37 Â°C was slow with low concentration of lysenin (Fig. 1B). Hemolysis was not observed at 4 Â°C under this experimental condition. Fig. 1C shows lysenin dose-response of hemolysis. These results indicate that hemolysis is dependent both on incubation temperature and lysenin concentration. Hemolysis was induced even at 4 Â°C with high concentrations of lysenin. Binding of lysenin to SM was also temperature-dependent (Fig. 1D). However, temperature dependence of hemolysis was not solely because of temperature-dependent binding of lysenin. In Fig. 1E, erythrocytes were first preincubated with various concentrations of lysenin at 4 Â°C. Under these conditions, hemolysis was not observed. Erythrocytes were then washed and further incubated in PBS at different temperatures. During incubation, hemolysis was induced in a temperature-dependent manner. Because the same amount of lysenin was bound to the erythrocytes by the preincubation, our results indicate that there is an additional temperature-dependent step to induce hemolysis. We then examined the ultrastructure of erythrocytes after lysenin treatment. Hemolysis was induced by the addition of 100 ng/ml lysenin to sheep erythrocytes at 4 Â°C. We chose this relatively high lysenin/erythrocytes ratio to examine membrane distribution of lysenin. The lysed cell contained globular protrusions (Fig. 2B), whereas non-treated erythrocytes were observed as having a smooth shape (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained with human erythrocytes (data not shown). Negative staining showed membrane protrusions that contained aggregates of membrane components (Fig. 2, C and D). Fig. 2E shows the localization of lysenin on erythrocyte membranes. Initial attempts using native lysenin and anti-lysenin antisera was without success. Then we prepared maltose-binding protein-conjugated recombinant lysenin (MBP-lysenin) and detected the distribution of the protein by anti-MBP antiserum as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Similar to native lysenin (12Yamaji A. Sekizawa Y. Emoto K. Sakuraba H. Inoue K. Kobayashi H. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5300-5306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), MBP-lysenin specifically recognized SM (Fig. 2F). MBP-lysenin was not randomly distributed on erythrocyte membranes, but rather, accumulated in the region of the protrusions (Fig. 2E, arrows). From these electron microscope observations, it was suggested that lysenin aggregates on erythrocyte membranes and forms pores. To estimate the size of the pore, we measured hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes in the presence of various carbohydrates and polymers that are known to inhibit hemolysis in a pore size-dependent manner (8Lange S. Kauschke E. Mohrig W. Cooper E.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Lysenin-induced hemolysis was inhibited neither by sucrose (effective molecular diameter; 0.9 nm) nor by raffinose (1.2â1.4 nm), whereas dextran 4 (3â3.5 nm) and PEG 4000 (4 nm) significantly inhibited hemolysis (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that the diameter of the pore induced by lysenin is â¼3 nm. Unlike lysenin, streptolysin O induced hemolysis even in the presence of PEG 4000 (Fig. 3B). This is consistent with previous observation that the pore size induced by streptolysin O is around 30 nm in diameter (26Sekiya K. Satoh R. Danbara H. Futaesaku Y. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5953-5961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like hemolysis, lysenin-induced membrane damage of SM-containing liposomes was dependent on both the concentration of lysenin and the incubation temperature (Fig. 4). The marker release from liposomes was dependent on the presence of SM (Fig. 4A) as described (12Yamaji A. Sekizawa Y. Emoto K. Sakuraba H. Inoue K. Kobayashi H. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5300-5306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Lysenin did not induce calcein release from diC18:1 PC/cholesterol liposomes, whereas a rapid marker release occurred from SM/cholesterol liposomes. With high concentrations of lysenin, calcein release was slowed down at low temperature (Fig. 4A), whereas marker release was not observed at 4 Â°C with low concentrations of lysenin (Fig. 4B). The ultrastructure of lysenin-treated SM-containing liposomes was examined by negative staining electron microscopy (Fig. 5). When SM/cholesterol liposomes were incubated with lysenin, honeycomb-like regular hexagonal structures accumulated (Fig. 5, A and B). Such structure was not observed when diC18:1 PC/cholesterol liposomes were incubated with lysenin (Fig. 5C). The diameter of the hexagonal unit was 10 â12 nm and there appeared pore-like structures with 3â5 nm diameters inside the hexagonal units. Honeycomb structures were not uniformly distributed on the membrane, but rather accumulated in several regions of the membranes (Fig. 5A, arrows). Lysenin Assembles to SDS-resistant Oligomers in the Presence of SMâThe apparent molecular weight of lysenin was determined to be 41,000 by SDS-PAGE. Incubation of lysenin with diC18:1 PC/cholesterol, diC16:0 PC/cholesterol, or PS/cholesterol liposomes did not affect the mobility of the protein on the SDS gel. In contrast, in the presence of SM/cholesterol liposomes, 41-kDa band significantly decreased and a new band with molecular weight greater than 250,000 appeared (Fig. 6A). This suggests the formation of SDS-resistant lysenin oligomers in the presence of SM. The organization of this SDS-resistant complex was analyzed using anti-peptide antibodies established against synthetic peptides based on the amino acid sequence of lysenin (Fig. 6B). Peptide specific antibodies, 20W, 104T, and 161I, recognized only lysenin monomer whereas other antibodies, including anti-lysenin antiserum, detected both monomer and oligomer (Fig. 6C). In particular, antibodies raised against the C terminus of lysenin, 212K, 231G, and 284L strongly bound to the lysenin oligomer. These results suggest that the C terminus of lysenin is exposed in the oligomer complex. Lysenin Interacts with Hydrophobic Tails of SMâIntrinsic tryptophan fluorescence is widely used to estimate the local environment of tryptophan residues of proteins. Lysenin contains 6 tryptophan residues. In Fig. 7, we compared the fluorescence emission spectra of tryptophan in the absence or presence of one of the following liposomes; SM/cholesterol, diC18:1 PC/cholesterol, and PS/cholesterol. The tryptophan fluorescence increased and the wavelength of maximum emission underwent a blue shift from 332.8 to 330.3 nm after incubation with SM/cholesterol liposomes. In contrast, the fluorescence of lysenin did not change significantly in the presence of diC18:1 PC/cholesterol or PS/cholesterol liposomes. These results suggest the migration of the tryptophan residues of lysenin to a less polar environment in the presence of SM. We then asked whether lysenin interacts with the hydrophobic tails of SM. If lysenin interacts with hydrophobic tails, it disturbs cooperative phase transition of the lipid and the enthalpy of phase transition is decreased (27Papahadjopoulos D. Moscarello M. Eylar E.H. Isac T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 401: 317-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 28Poklar N. Fritz J. Macek P. Vesnaver G. Chalikian T.V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14999-15008Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this experiment, we employed synthetic phospholipids with defined phase transition temperature: C16:0 SM (phase transition at 37.3 Â°C) and diC16:0 PC (phase transition at 41.5 Â°C). Fig. 8 shows the DSC melting profiles of C16:0 SM and diC16:0 PC in PBS in the absence and presence of lysenin. The phase transition enthalpy, ÎH, of the gel to liquid-crystalline transition of C16:0 SM was 4.6 kcal/mol (Fig. 8A). When lysenin was added, ÎH was decreased to 3.4 kcal/mol. The phase transition temperature of C16:0 SM was not significantly affected by the addition of lysenin. These results suggest that lysenin interacts with the hydrophobic tails of SM in the membrane. Unlike SM, ÎH of diC16:0 PC was slightly increased (15.2 to 16.6 kcal/mol) in the presence of lysenin (Fig. 8B). In Fig. 9A, we examined the effect of hydrocarbon chains of SM on oligomerization of lysenin. When lysenin was incubated with various SMs at 37 Â°C, oligomerization was observed irrespective of the hydrocarbon chain of SM. In contrast, lysenin oligomerized at 4 Â°C only when it was incubated with SM with unsaturated fatty acids (C16:1 SM and C18:1 SM). Brain SM, C16:0 SM, and C18:0 SM did not significantly induce oligomerization. When lysenin was incubated with liposomes containing SM and cholesterol, oligomerization was induced both at 37 and 4 Â°C with all SMs examined. In contrast to oligomerization, the binding of lysenin to SM was not significantly affected by fatty acid composition of SMs. The gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition temperatures of SMs that we used, determined by DSC, were 36.8 Â°C for brain SM, 37.3 Â°C for C16:0 SM, and 43.6 Â°C for C18:0 SM (Fig. 9C). We could not detect phase transition of C16:1 SM and C18:1 SM under our experimental setting, indicating that the phase transition temperatures of these SMs were below 5 Â°C. Cholesterol increases membrane fluidity of gel-phase lipids. Our results suggest that oligomerization but not binding was influenced by the fluidity of SM. Lysenin recognized SM and induced hemolysis. Both binding of lysenin to SM and lysenin-induced hemolysis showed temperature dependence. Our results indicate that lysenin oligomerized and formed pores in target membranes in a SM-dependent manner. Lysenin assembled to the honeycomb structure in SM-containing liposomes. Biochemically, lysenin was recovered as SDS-resistant oligomers after incubation with SM-containing membranes. Western blotting revealed smear bands with molecular weight greater than 250,000. Silver staining gave several bands around this area. These results suggest the heterogeneity of SDS-resistant oligomers. The C terminus of lysenin was exposed whereas most of the N terminus domains were buried in the oligomer complex. Several pore-forming toxins have been reported to interact with SM. Cytotoxicity of equinatoxin II from sea anemone Actinia equina is inhibited by the addition of SM-containing membranes (29Bernheimer A.W. Avigad L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Binding of equinatoxin II to SM is, however, not specific. Equinatoxin II also interacts with phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol under appropriate conditions (28Poklar N. Fritz J. Macek P. Vesnaver G. Chalikian T.V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14999-15008Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 30Caaveiro J.M. Echabe I. Gutierrez-Aguirre I. Nieva J.L. Arrondo J.L. Gonzalez-Manas J.M. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1343-1353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Sticholysin I and II from Stichodactyla helianthus also prefer SM-containing membranes (31Valcarcel C.A. Dalla Serra M. Potrich C. Bernhart I. Tejuca M. Martinez D. Pazos F. Lanio M.E. Menestrina G. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2761-2774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Vibrio cholerae cytolysin requires both SM and cholesterol (32Zitzer A. Zitzer O. Bhakdi S. Palmer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1375-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Eiseniapore from the earthworm E. foetida induces lysis of liposomes containing SM or galactosylceramides (9Lange S. Nussler F. Kauschke E. Lutsch G. Cooper E.L. Herrmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20884-20892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Lysenin is unique in that it specifically recognizes SM. Previously Lange et al. (8Lange S. Kauschke E. Mohrig W. Cooper E.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Lange S. Nussler F. Kauschke E. Lutsch G. Cooper E.L. Herrmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20884-20892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) showed that eiseniapore induces 3-nm diameter pores in SM-containing membranes and forms stable oligomers. Although substrate specificity of lysenin is slightly different from that of eiseniapore, our results together with the results of Lange et al. (8Lange S. Kauschke E. Mohrig W. Cooper E.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Lange S. Nussler F. Kauschke E. Lutsch G. Cooper E.L. Herrmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20884-20892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) suggest that two toxins are highly related. Unfortunately, molecular identity of eiseniapore has yet to be elucidated. Lange et al. (9Lange S. Nussler F. Kauschke E. Lutsch G. Cooper E.L. Herrmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20884-20892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) also showed that the tryptophan fluorescence of eiseniapore decreased and shifted to higher wavelengths in the presence of SM-containing membranes. In contrast, SM increased and blue-shifted lysenin fluorescence. These results indicate that lysenin and eiseniapore are different proteins and the tryptophan residues of lysenin migrated to a less polar environment in the presence of SM. Consistent with this observation, the DSC experiment revealed that lysenin interacted with hydrophobic tails of SM. Because lysenin recognizes the hydrophilic head group of SM (12Yamaji A. Sekizawa Y. Emoto K. Sakuraba H. Inoue K. Kobayashi H. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5300-5306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), our results indicate that lysenin interacts with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties of SM. Oligomerization of pore-forming toxins is a highly co-operative process that involves protein-protein interaction, such as formation of oligomer complex preceding membrane insertion (33Rossjohn J. Feil S.C. McKinstry W.J. Tweten R.K. Parker M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 685-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) or the insertion of soluble monomer into a pre-existing oligomer (34Palmer M. Harris R. Freytag C. Kehoe M. Tranum-Jensen J. Bhakdi S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1598-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The following observations suggest that protein-protein interaction is also important in the formation of lysenin oligomers: immunoelectron microscopy revealed the accumulation of lysenin in protrusions of erythrocytes; lysenin-induced honeycomb structures were non-uniformly distributed in SM-containing liposomes. In addition to protein-protein interaction, our results suggest that membrane fluidity is important in the oligomerization process. The effect of membrane fluidity on oligomerization has been studied on several pore-forming toxins. Tomita et al. (35Tomita T. Watanabe M. Yasuda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13391-13397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that increase in membrane fluidity promoted oligomerization of Staphylococcus aureus Î±-toxin. In contrast, the oligomerization of Psudomonas aeruginosa cytolyn (36Sliwinski-Korell A. Engelhardt H. Kampka M. Lutz F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) or V. cholerae cytolysin (37Zitzer A. Harris J.R. Kemminer S.E. Zitzer O. Bhakdi S. Muething J. Palmer M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1509: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was not affected by membrane fluidity. In this report, we showed that lysenin oligomerized at low temperatures only when SM carried unsaturated fatty acid. Oligomerization of lysenin was accelerated by the addition of cholesterol to SMs that contained saturated fatty acids. These results suggest that the oligomerization of lysenin is dependent on the fluidity of SM. The gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition temperature of C18:0 SM was 43.6 Â°C, whereas C18:0 SM promoted oligomerization of lysenin at 37 Â°C. This result indicates that although the fluidity is important, the liquid-crystalline state of SM is not prerequisite for oligomerization. We thank A.

Classically, Ras activation has been associated with enhanced cellular growth and transformation. However, activated forms of Ras may also inhibit growth by inducing senescence, apoptosis, and differentiation. Induction of apoptosis by Ras may be mediated by its effector RASSF1, which appears to function as a tumor suppressor. We now show that the Ras effector Nore1, which is structurally related to RASSF1, can also mediate a Ras-dependent apoptosis. Moreover, an analysis of Nore1 protein expression showed that it is frequently down-regulated in lung tumor cell lines and primary lung tumors. Like RASSF1, this correlates with methylation of the Nore1 promoter rather than gene deletion. Finally, re-introduction of Nore1, driven by its own promoter, impairs the growth in soft agar of a human lung tumor cell line. Consequently, we propose that the Ras effector Nore1 is a member of a family of Ras effector/tumor suppressors that includes RASSF1.

Ras proteins are small GTPases that regulate the flow of mitogenic signals from cell surface receptors to the internal cell signaling machinery (1Malumbres M. Pellicer A. Front.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). To achieve this, Ras proteins shuttle between an active, GTP-bound form and an inactive GDP-bound form under the influence of guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase activating proteins (3Bollag G. McCormick F. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1992; 3: 199-208PubMed Google Scholar, 4Quilliam L.A. Khosravi-Far R. Huff S.Y. Der C.J.

Activated Ras proteins induce a wide variety of biological phenotypes associated with the loss of normal growth control. These include loss of contact inhibition (6Huber B.E. Cordingley M.G. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 245-256PubMed Google Scholar), resistance to differentiation (7Yuspa S.H. Kilkenny A.E. Stanley J. Lichti U.

However, activated Ras may also induce senescence (15Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar), differentiation (16Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R.

Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5892-5901Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thus, paradoxically, Ras can drive processes that either are normally associated with the acquisition of a transformed phenotype or that promote growth arrest and death. The normal role of Ras in vivo must involve a fine balance of these properties (20Frame S. Balmain A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The ability of Ras to produce such a range of apparently contradictory biological effects may be derived from its ability to interact with a diverse array of effector proteins (2Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Although effectors mediating the positive growth effects of Ras have been relatively well characterized, the effectors mediating the negative growth aspects remain relatively poorly defined. Recently, we demonstrated that the tumor suppressor RASSF1 (21Dammann R. Li C. Yoon J.H. Chin P.L. Bates S. Pfeifer G.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar) has the potential to serve as a Ras effector mediating Ras-dependent apoptosis (22Vos M.D. Ellis C.A. Bell A. Birrer M.J. Clark G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35669-35672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). At the time we speculated that Nore1, which bears considerable resemblance to RASSF1 (see Fig. 1), might also be a Ras-regulated tumor suppressor. Khokhlatchev et al. (23Khokhlatchev A. Rabizadeh S. Xavier R. Nedwidek M. Chen T. Zhang X.F. Seed B. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 253-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) have now shown that Nore1 can induce apoptosis, and Tommasi et al. (24Tommasi S. Dammann R. Jin S.G. Zhang X.X. Avruch J. Pfeifer G.P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2713-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have shown that some forms of the Nore1 mRNA are down-regulated in a lung tumor cell line. We now show that Nore1-mediated apoptosis is Ras-dependent. Moreover, using a polyclonal antibody, we show that Nore1 protein expression is frequently down-regulated, both in human lung tumor cell lines and in primary tumors. Although Tommasi et al. (24Tommasi S. Dammann R. Jin S.G. Zhang X.X. Avruch J. Pfeifer G.P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2713-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) were unable to determine a mechanism for the down-regulation, we have found evidence of epigenetic inactivation of Nore1 by promoter methylation. Furthermore, by reintroducing Nore1 under the control of its own promoter, we were able to impair the ability of a human lung tumor cell line to grow in soft agar. Consequently, we propose that, like RASSF1, Nore1 may function as a Ras-regulated tumor suppressor. Cloning of Nore1/Maxp1âThe Rat ortholog of Nore1 (Maxp1) was identified by a tBlastn search of the GenBankâ¢ data base using the amino acid sequence of murine Nore1 as the query. Maxp1 shows over 94% identity to Nore1. The Maxp1 coding sequence was isolated by PCR from a Rat brain cDNA library, using the following primers to introduce convenient restriction sites (BglII/EcoRI) at the 5â² and 3â² ends: ggggagatctatggcgtccccggccattg and ggggaattccttacccaggcttcccttgg. We have confirmed that the Rat Maxp1 protein binds Ras in a GTP-dependent manner (data not shown). To reduce confusion, we will subsequently refer to this protein as Nore1. The Nore1 gene was cloned as a BglII/EcoRI fragment into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pcDNAF, a modified version of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) that adds a FLAG epitope tag to the insert. Nore1 was also cloned via the BamHI/EcoRI sites into pZIP-NeoHA, 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; CRD, cysteine-rich domain; RA, Ras association; 5-AzaC, 5â²-aza-2â²-deoxycytidine. a modified version of pZIP-Neo SV(X)1 (25Fiordalisi J.J. Johnson R.L. Ulku A.S. Der C.J. Cox A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1901; 332: 3-36Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which adds a hemagglutinin epitope tag to the inserted gene. The immediate 1.6-kb 5â² promoter region was amplified from the human Nore1BAC clone (GenBankâ¢ accession number AL354681.2) by PCR using the primers ggtaccggcagaggactatgattaccgtga and ctcgaggggtccaatagtagcgggtacg. These primers introduce a KpnI and an XhoI restriction site at the 5â² and 3â² ends, respectively (shown underlined). After sequence confirmation, the 1.6-kb promoter fragment was cloned into the KpnI/XhoI sites in the vector pGL3-Luc (Promega). The luciferase gene was then excised from this vector and replaced with a full-length BglII/SalI fragment of Nore1. For fluorescent analyses Nore1 was cloned into the BglII/EcoRI sites of the pHcRedC vector (Clontech). Cell Culture and TransfectionsâNIH 3T3 cells were grown in 10% calf serum and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 293-T and 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum. Human lung tumor cells were grown in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum. NIH 3T3 and 293-T cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate technique (26Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Cell selection experiments were performed using pZIP-NeoHA vectors, with the cells selected in medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml G418 for 2 weeks. Cells were then fixed and stained in 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid, and 0.5% crystal violet before counting. Soft agar assays were performed as described previously (27Sabichi A.L. Hendricks D.T. Bober M.A. Birrer M.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Human lung tumor cell lines were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). A549 cells were co-transfected with 500 ng of pGL3(âLuc/+Nore1) plasmid and 50 ng of pBabe-PurHA using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) and selected in puramycin (Sigma). Cell Death/Apoptosis AssaysâCOS7 cells were co-transfected with 50 ng each of the red fluorescent expression vector, pHcRed-Nore1 (as described above), and yellow fluorescent protein-pSensor caspase activity reporter plasmid (Clontech). Location of the pSensor indicator protein in co-transfected cells was determined after 24 h by fluorescent microscopy. 293 cells were transfected with 5 Î¼g of pcDNAF-Nore1 or empty vector. After 48 h trypan blue was added in situ at a final concentration of 10%. Cells were then examined under phase/contrast and bright field microscopy. Expression of Human Nore1 mRNAâA 450-bp human Nore1 fragment (bases 1â450) was isolated by PCR from the IMAGE consortium clone 3613993 and used as a probe in Northern blots of human normal tissue mRNA (Clontech). Northern analysis was performed as described previously (22Vos M.D. Ellis C.A. Bell A. Birrer M.J. Clark G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35669-35672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Preparation of Nore1 Polyclonal Anti-serumâPolyclonal rabbit antibodies to the Nore1 peptide (DNPQFALFKRIHKDGQ) were prepared by Invitrogen. This peptide is located in the RA domain of Nore1 and is conserved between the rat, mouse, and human protein. Western blots were performed using the antibody at a dilution of 1/1000 followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibody. Visualization was via an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). ImmunohistochemistryâTissue sections (5 mm thick) were dewaxed, re-hydrated, and blocked with 3% H2O2 for 30 min. Nonspecific background was reduced by incubating the slides in 3% goat normal serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min at room temperature. Slides were incubated in the primary antibody at 1:1,000 dilution overnight at 4 Â°C. The next day, the tissues were exposed for 1 h to biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Vector Laboratories) and then for another hour to the avidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex (1:100; Vector Laboratories). Peroxidase activity was detected with diaminobenzidine, and the slides were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin. Substitution of the primary antibody by preimmune serum was used as a negative control. In addition preabsorption of the primary antibody with 10 nmol of synthetic antigen per ml of optimally diluted antiserum was used as a specificity control. Pictures were taken in a BX50 microscope (Olympus, Minneapolis, MN) equipped with a PDMC-2 digital camera (Polaroid, Cambridge, MA). Southern AnalysisâHigh molecular weight DNA was prepared and digested with methylation-sensitive or insensitive restriction enzymes prior to gel electrophoresis and Southern analysis. The full-length Nore1 cDNA was used as a probe to test for gene deletion. The 1.6-kb promoter region was used as a probe to examine the methylation status of HaeII sites in the promoter. Demethylating AssaysâAssays were performed by incubating the cells in growth medium supplemented with 5â10 Î¼m 5â²-aza-2â²-deoxycytidine (5-AzaC) (Sigma) for 4 days. Cells were then lysed and examined for re-expression of Nore1 by Western blot analysis. Deacetylation AssaysâCells were treated with 250 nm Trichostatin A (Sigma) for 48/72 h before being subjected to Western analysis using Nore1 anti-serum. Alignment of Nore1 and RASSF1âRat Nore1 (originally described as Maxp1 in GenBankâ¢) and murine Nore1 show â¼94% amino acid identity. Both proteins are â¼48% identical to the tumor suppressor RASSF1A (Fig. 1). They consist of an N-terminal region, a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) shown in bold, an RA domain shown shaded, and a C-terminal domain shown underlined. The N-terminal region is unique and of unknown function. It is more extensive in Nore1 than RASSF1A. Both Nore1 and RASSF1A possess a potential CRD. A CRD is also found in the Raf family of Ras effectors where it serves in the regulation of Raf by binding to Ras, lipids, and 14-3-3 (28Drugan J.K. Khosravi-Far R. White M.A. Der C.J. Sung Y.J.

Both RASSF1 and Nore1 may produce splice variants that are N-terminally truncated and do not contain the CRD (24Tommasi S. Dammann R. Jin S.G. Zhang X.X. Avruch J. Pfeifer G.P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2713-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The RA domains of Rat and murine Nore1 bear 60% amino acid identity to the RA domain of human RASSF1A. They bear 37 and 31% amino acid identity, respectively, to the RA domain of the Ras effector AF6. The N-terminal region has been shown to be a site of homo- and heterodimerization (31Ortiz-Vega S. Khokhlatchev A. Nedwidek M. Zhang X-F. Dammann R. Pfeifer G.P. Avruch J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Exogenous Expression of Nore1 Mediates a Potent Inhibition of Lung Tumor Cell GrowthâTo characterize the biological properties of Nore1, we first attempted to generate cell lines that overexpressed Nore1. A549 human lung carcinoma cells were transfected with Nore1 in a selectable expression vector (pZIP-NeoHA). After 2 weeks of selection in G418, colonies were fixed, stained, and counted. Fig. 2 shows that although empty vector readily generated G418-resistant colonies, no cells survived transfection with the full-length Nore1. Co-transfection with activated Ras did not rescue cell growth (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with multiple other cell lines including H-23 lung carcinoma cell lines and NIH 3T3 cells (data not shown). Nore1-mediated Growth Inhibition Is Ras-dependent and ApoptoticâTo determine the effects of Ras action on the growth inhibitory properties of Nore1, 293-T cells were transiently transfected with Nore1 and H-Ras mutants. The growth inhibition mediated by Nore1 was increased in the presence of activated H-ras but decreased in the presence of the H-Ras dominant negative mutant Q61L/C186S (Fig. 3a). A 17N dominant negative mutant of Ras was not used, as alone it is too growth inhibitory. The growth inhibition appeared to be apoptotic in nature as co-transfection with the anti-apoptotic oncogene Bcl-2 blocked it (Fig. 3b). Similar results could be obtained with 293 cells (data not shown). As further confirmation that Nore1 induced apoptotic cell death in these cells, trypan blue staining was used to demonstrate the presence of dead cells in the Nore1 transfected cultures (Fig. 4). In addition, the effects of Nore1 expression on caspase activation were determined using the pSensor system (Clontech). Using this technique, the pSensor protein becomes localized to the nucleus when caspases cleave off the nuclear exclusion sequence. Cells expressing the red fluorescent Nore1 fusion protein were found to have the green fluorescent pSensor protein located in the nucleus (Fig. 5B), and cells expressing the pSensor protein alone did not (Fig. 5A).Fig. 4Nore1 causes cell death in 293 cells.A, 293 cells were transfected with 5 Î¼g of empty vector or Nore1.

COS7 cells were transfected with either 50 ng of pHcRed-vector (A) or pHcRed-Nore1 (B) and yellow fluorescent protein-CasSens (green). After 24 h cells were imaged using fluorescent microscopy to detect the nuclear re-localization of the CaspaseSensor reporter protein in red positive cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Nore1 mRNA Is Widely Expressed in Human TissueâTo examine the expression of Nore1 mRNA in normal human tissue, we performed Northern analysis using a 450-bp fragment of the human cDNA as a probe. Nore1 was expressed in all tissue to some extent but was most evident in lung, spleen, thymus, and peripheral blood samples (Fig. 6). Expression of Nore1 Protein Is Frequently Lost in Human Lung Tumor Cell LinesâTo examine endogenous Nore1 at a protein level, we generated a Nore1-specific polyclonal antibody (see âExperimental Proceduresâ). The antibody can recognize both splice variants 1A and 1B (24Tommasi S. Dammann R. Jin S.G. Zhang X.X. Avruch J. Pfeifer G.P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2713-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 31Ortiz-Vega S. Khokhlatchev A. Nedwidek M. Zhang X-F. Dammann R. Pfeifer G.P. Avruch J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Protein lysates from a series of human lung tumor cell lines and one nontransformed lung epithelial cell line (HBEC) were quantitated, and equal protein concentrations were subjected to Western analysis for Nore1 (Fig. 7). Expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen was used as an internal control for protein loading. The primary lung lysate and the non-transformed HBEC cells express Nore1A but not the 1B variant. However, the majority of tumor cell lines (11/14) have lost Nore1A expression. The smaller 1B variant was only expressed at high levels in one tumor cell line. Peptide competition experiments were performed to confirm the specificity of the Nore1 bands (data not shown). Nore1 Is Expressed in the Basal Epithelia of the Lung but Is Frequently Down-regulated in Primary AdenocarcinomasâTo ensure that the loss of Nore1 expression was not merely because of the process of growing cells in culture, we examined a series of primary lung tumor sections by immunohistochemistry with our Nore1 antibody. Whereas Nore1 expression can clearly be seen in the normal epithelial layer (Fig. 8a, panel A), expression appears to be severely reduced or completely absent in the majority (4/5) of the epithelial-derived adenocarcinomas examined (Fig. 8a, panel B). Furthermore, a similar examination of five primary small cell lung carcinomas demonstrated that 4/5 were also negative for Nore1 expression (Fig. 8a, panel C) with one small cell lung carcinoma that clearly showed Nore1 staining (Fig. 8a, panel D). A summary of the results of these experiments are tabulated and shown in Fig. 8b. Nore1 Expression Is Down-regulated by Hypermethylation in Lung Tumor CellsâNore1 is related structurally to the Ras effector/tumor suppressor RASSF1. Although the RASSF1 gene is located in a region of the chromosome where there are frequent deletions in lung tumors, RASSF1 down-regulation is usually because of promoter methylation not deletion (32Pfeifer G.P.

J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Nore1 is also located at a region of the genome, 1q32.1â2, which has been reported to suffer deletions during tumor development (35Steiner G. Cairns P. Polascik T.J. Marshall F.F. Epstein J.I. Sidransky D. Schoenberg M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5044-5046PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether Nore1 is deleted in Nore1 negative tumor cell lines we digested high molecular weight DNA with BamHI and subjected it to Southern analysis using the Nore1 cDNA as a probe. An internal BamHI fragment was present in all cell lines tested (Fig. 9a). Therefore, we failed to detect any obvious loss of the Nore1 gene. To determine whether the silencing of Nore1 expression in A549 and H345 cells might be because of promoter methylation, we examined the methylation status of a CpG island just upstream of the initiation codon of Nore1A. This region contains a methylation-sensitive restriction site for HaeII. DNA was digested with HaeII and subjected to Southern analysis using a probe consisting of the 1.6-kb promoter region immediately upstream of the Nore1A initiation codon (residues 69241â72957 of GenBankâ¢ version AL354681.2). Digestion of the HaeII site is predicted to release a 3.7-kb fragment that should hybridize with the probe. The 3.7-kb band was detected in the N417 and H82 cell lanes (positive for Nore1 expression) but not in the A549 or H345 cell lanes (negative for Nore1 expression) (Fig. 9b). To confirm that epigenetic effects were responsible for the loss of Nore1 expression in lung tumor cells lines, we treated the A549 human lung tumor cell line with the demethylating agent 5-AzaC. We also treated the cells with a deacetylating agent, Trichostatin A. We then examined the effects of drug treatment on Nore1 protein expression by Western blot. 5-AzaC caused an increase in Nore1 expression (Fig. 10). Trichostatin A had no effect on Nore1 expression, although it did activate p21 (Fig. 11). Thus, promoter silencing by methylation rather than acetylation or gene deletion is the likely mechanism behind the down-regulation of Nore1 expression in lung tumor cells.Fig. 11Treatment of A549 cells with Trichostatin A does not restore Nore1 expression. Treated cells were lysed and assayed for Nore1 expression using p21 as a positive control for deacetylationmediated gene expression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Introduction of Nore1 into Human Lung Tumor Cells Impairs Their Ability to Proliferate in Soft AgarâA549 human lung carcinoma cells are negative for the expression of Nore1 (see Fig. 7). Introduction of Nore1 driven by a retroviral promoter inevitably resulted in cell death. Moreover, repeated attempts to generate Nore1 inducible cell systems failed because of cell death, even in the absence of induction (data not shown). Consequently, to determine the effects of re-introducing Nore1 to A549 cells, we cloned the Nore1 promoter from the BAC clone into pGL3Luc (Promega). We then replaced the luciferase gene with our Nore1 cDNA. This construct, with the Nore1 cDNA under the transcriptional control of its own promoter, was then co-transfected into A549 cells in molar excess with the selectable vector pBabe (25Fiordalisi J.J. Johnson R.L. Ulku A.S. Der C.J. Cox A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1901; 332: 3-36Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After selection, early passage pooled populations of cells grew normally and were assayed for the expression of Nore1 (Fig. 12d) and for their ability to proliferate in soft agar. Fig. 12a versus b shows that the average size of the colonies that grew in soft agar was reduced in the presence of Nore1. Fig. 12c shows that the overall number of clones that proliferated in agar was also reduced. The low levels of Nore1 expression achieved by the genomic promoter fragment are shown in Fig. 12d. Similar results were obtained from clonal populations (data not shown). Thus, re-introduction of Nore1 expression under the control of its natural promoter inhibited the tumorigenic properties of a tumor cell line that had lost Nore1 expression. Activated forms of Ras can exert profound effects, both positive and negative, on cellular growth and survival (20Frame S. Balmain A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Ras is not alone in this capacity, as a similar dual role has been described for the oncoprotein Myc (36Hueber A.O. Evan G.I. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It seems that pathways promoting proliferation and those promoting death are coupled and that this linkage may play an important part in checking the development of neoplasia. The ability of activated Ras to induce senescence, necrosis, cell cycle arrest, differentiation, or apoptosis is well documented (15Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar, 18Chen C.Y. Faller D.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1487-1498PubMed Google Scholar, 38Sewing A. Wiseman B.

Yokoyama S. Kuchino Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2281-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying these effects of Ras remain poorly understood. Although excessive activation of the Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway can cause growth inhibition and death (39Zhu J. Woods D. McMahon M. Bishop J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 41Fanton C.P. McMahon M. Pieper R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; PubMed Google Scholar), it is unclear that such hyperactivation can occur under physiological conditions. It seems likely that Ras may also be able to stimulate other inhibitory pathways. One may imagine that subversion of the Ras pathways leading to cell death must be a critical component of the development of a Ras-dependent tumor. Ras proteins can interact with a surprisingly broad array of effector proteins. The effectors that mediate many of the positive aspects of Ras function are relatively well characterized and include the Raf family, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and the RalGDS family (1Malumbres M. Pellicer A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: d887-d912Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 2Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 42Ellis C.A. Clark G J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In many cases, these effector proteins are oncoproteins in their own right. However, recently, we demonstrated that the tumor suppressor RASSF1 could also serve as a potential Ras effector (22Vos M.D. Ellis C.A. Bell A. Birrer M.J. Clark G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35669-35672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Thus Ras may regulate tumor suppressors as well as oncoproteins. RASSF1 has several related family members described in the EST data base. One such protein is the Ras effector Nore1. Consequently, we were interested in determining whether Nore1 also exhibited the properties of a tumor suppressor that can be activated by Ras. We found that cell lines cannot tolerate the deregulated expression of Nore1. Even non-transformed cells that still produce endogenous protein are affected. This may be because of a dosage effect or perhaps because of the inability to regulate Nore1 levels over the cell cycle when expressed from a viral promoter. In 293-T cells, Nore1 growth inhibition is Ras-dependent. That is, activated Ras enhances the inhibition, and dominant negative Ras blocks it. Khokhlatchev et al. (23Khokhlatchev A. Rabizadeh S. Xavier R. Nedwidek M. Chen T. Zhang X.F. Seed B. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 253-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) have shown recently that Nore1, like RASSF1 (22Vos M.D. Ellis C.A. Bell A. Birrer M.J. Clark G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35669-35672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), can induce apoptosis in 293-T cells. We have also found that the growth inhibition appears to apoptotic in nature. Trypan blue staining shows massive cell death in Nore1 transfected cells, the cotransfection of Bcl2 rescues the cells from growth inhibition, and caspase activation can be detected in Nore1 transfected 293-T cells. Thus, like RASSF1, Nore1 has the potential to mediate some of the growth inhibitory functions of Ras. If Nore1 functions as a tumor suppressor in vivo, then we would expect to see a loss of Nore1 protein expression during tumor development. We generated a Nore1 polyclonal antibody and used it to screen a panel of human lung tumor cell lines for Nore1 expression. As controls we used a non-transformed lung epithelial cell line (HBEC) and a lysate of primary lung tissue. Nore1 has the potential to exist in two splice forms, 1A, corresponding to the full-length Nore1, and a smaller 1B variant. Tommasi et al. (24Tommasi S. Dammann R. Jin S.G. Zhang X.X. Avruch J. Pfeifer G.P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2713-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have shown recently that the expression of mRNA for Nore1B is lost and that of Nore1A reduced in one lung tumor cell line. We have found that only the 1A isoform, not the 1B protein, appears to be present in HBEC cells and that both isoforms are absent or severely reduced in most lung tumor cell lines. No correlation was observed between Nore1 expression and the presence or absence of a ras mutation. A similar result has been confirmed recently (43van Engeland M. Roemen G.M. Brink M. Pachen M.M. Weijenberg M.P. de Bruine A.P. Arends J.W. van den Brandt P.A. de Goeij A.F. Herman J.G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3792-3795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for ras and RASSF1. However, constitutive activation of the Ras pathway can occur in the absence of a structural mutation in Ras (44Guha A. Feldkamp M.M. Lau N. Boss G. Pawson A. Oncogene. 1997; 4: 2755-2765Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Moreover, RASSF1 or Nore1 could suffer loss of function by mutation. Consequently, a correlation between a gain of Ras function and loss of Nore1 function may be difficult to see. To avoid the possibility that the loss of Nore1 expression was because of the use of cells grown in culture, we also performed immunohistochemical analysis of a series of primary human lung adenocarcinomas. We found that most of these tumors, like the cell lines, had lost the expression of Nore1. A similar result was obtained for the neuroendocrine-derived small cell lung carcinoma tumors examined. The human Nore1 gene maps to 1q32.1â2. This is the site of a potential tumor suppressor in human renal carcinomas, as 69% of distal nephron tumors exhibit loss of heterozygosity at this position (35Steiner G. Cairns P. Polascik T.J. Marshall F.F. Epstein J.I. Sidransky D. Schoenberg M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5044-5046PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, analysis of the Mitelman data base of chromosome aberrations at the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project (cgap.nci.nih.gov/Chromosomes/Mitelman) showed that the 1q32 locus suffers deletions in a wide variety of human cancers, including those of the lung. Despite these observations, we could find no evidence of deletion of Nore1 in our Nore1 negative lung tumor cell lines by Southern blot analysis. However, these experiments do not rule out the possibility of a translocation event. Interestingly, although the Nore1-related RASSF1 gene is located on a region of the chromosome that often suffers deletions, it appears that RASSF1 is not usually itself the subject of deletion. Instead, down-regulation frequently occurs by promoter methylation (32Pfeifer G.P. Yoon J.H. Liu L. Tommasi S. Wilczynski S.P. Dammann R. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To examine the possibility that Nore1 was being down-regulated by promoter methylation, we examined an area of the promoter of Nore1A just upstream of the start codon in a predicted CpG island. By restriction digestion with a methylation-sensitive enzyme, we found enhanced DNA methylation of the Nore1A promoter in A549 cells. Moreover, partial restoration of Nore1 protein expression could be obtained by treating the cells with a demethylating agent. Thus Nore1 and RASSF1 seem to share a common mechanism of down-regulation. Tommasi et al. (24Tommasi S. Dammann R. Jin S.G. Zhang X.X. Avruch J. Pfeifer G.P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2713-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) examined numerous tumor cell lines and were unable to detect Nore1B promoter methylation by PCR of bisulphate treated DNA. They stated that a similar result was obtained with the Nore1A promoter, but this was described as data not shown. At present, it is unclear to us why our results disagree, other than the possibility that our experimental approach was more direct. Finally, we attempted to re-introduce Nore1 expression in a Nore1 negative cell line to determine whether we could see a reduction of the transformed phenotype of the cells. Initially we used a series of inducible vector systems. In each case, the Nore1 inducible vector proved to be highly growth inhibitory, even without induction using pIND (Invitrogen), pLRT (45Watsuji T. Okamoto Y. Emi N. Katsuoka Y. Hagiwara M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and pJ5 Omega (46Morgenstern J. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 25: 3587-3596Crossref Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). The few colonies that did arise grew normally and would not induce Nore1 protein (data not shown). To surmount these technical problems, we resorted to cloning the minimal Nore1 promoter and placed the Nore1 cDNA under its control. A pooled population of early passage transfected A549 lung tumor cells (Fig. 12), as well as a clonal line expressed Nore1, and exhibited normal morphology and growth rates (data not shown). However, these cells showed impaired growth in soft agar. The minimal nature of this promoter fragment is probably responsible for the relatively low level of Nore1 expression detected in the transfected cells. Even cloned cells were not stable for Nore1 expression and gradually lost expression and reverted to a Nore1 negative phenotype (data not shown). A likely mechanism for this would be promoter methylation. Thus, we suggest that Nore1 is a Ras-regulated tumor suppressor of the RASSF1 family that may play a key role in the development of human tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2170329919,"Cellular responses to hypoxia can be acute or chronic. Acute responses mainly depend on oxygen-sensitive ion channels, whereas chronic responses rely on the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs), which up-regulate the expression of enzymes, transporters, and growth factors. It is unknown whether the expression of genes coding for ion channels is also influenced by hypoxia. We report here that the Î±<sub>1H</sub> gene of T-type voltage-gated calcium channels is highly induced by lowering oxygen tension in PC12 cells. Accumulation of Î±<sub>1H</sub> mRNA in response to hypoxia is time- and dose-dependent and paralleled by an increase in the density of T-type calcium channel current recorded in patch clamped cells. HIF appears to be involved in the response to hypoxia, since cobalt chloride, desferrioxamine, and dimethyloxalylglycine, compounds that mimic HIF-regulated gene expression, replicate the hypoxic effect. Moreover, functional inhibition of HIF-2Î± protein accumulation using antisense HIF-2Î± oligonucleotides reverses the effect of hypoxia on T-type Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> channel expression. Importantly, regulation by oxygen tension is specific for T-type calcium channels, since it is not observed with the L-, N-, and P/Q-channel types. These findings show for the first time that hypoxia induces an ion channel gene via a HIF-dependent mechanism and define a new role for the T-type calcium channels as regulators of cellular excitability and calcium influx under chronic hypoxia."

https://openalex.org/W1987856385,"Glutathione (GSH) depletion is the earliest biochemical alteration shown to date in brains of Parkinson's disease patients. However, data from animal models show that GSH depletion by itself is not sufficient to induce nigral degeneration. We have previously shown that non-toxic inhibition of GSH synthesis with l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine in primary midbrain cultures transforms a nitric oxide (NO) neurotrophic effect, selective for dopamine neurons, into a toxic effect with participation of guanylate cyclase (GC) and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) (Canals, S., Casarejos, M. J., de Bernardo, S., RodriÌguez-MartiÌn, E., and Mena, M. A. (2001) J. Neurochem. 79, 1183â1195). Here we demonstrate that arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism through the 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) pathway is also central for this GSH-NO interaction. LOX inhibitors (nordihydroguaiaretic acid and baicalein), but not cyclooxygenase (indomethacin) or epoxygenase (clotrimazole) ones, prevent cell death in the culture, even when added 10 h after NO treatment. Furthermore, the addition of AA to GSH-depleted cultures precipitates a cell death process that is indistinguishable from that initiated by NO in its morphology, time course, and 12-LOX, GC, and PKG dependence. The first AA metabolite through the 12-LOX enzyme, 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, induces cell death in the culture, and its toxicity is greatly enhanced by GSH depletion. In addition we show that if GSH synthesis inhibition persists for up to 4 days without any additional treatment, it will induce a cell death process that also depends on 12-LOX, GC, and PKG activation. In this study, therefore, we show that the signaling pathway AA/12-LOX/12-HPETE/GC/PKG may be important in several pathologies in which GSH decrease has been documented, such as Parkinson's disease. The potentiating effect of NO over such a signaling pathway may be of relevance as part of the cascade of events leading to and sustaining nerve cell death.

Whether such alterations are a primary cause of the disease, part of the degenerative mechanism, or secondary to the cell death process remains to be resolved. In cell cultures and animal models of several diseases, including PD, these alterations may contribute to neuronal degeneration. Furthermore, synergistic interactions between them have been demonstrated and greatly enhance the neurodegenerative process (1Jenner P. Olanow C.W.

It seems to appear before neurodegeneration in incidental Lewy bodies disease, which is considered to be the presymptomatic manifestation of PD (3Riederer P. Sofic E. Rausch W.-D. Schmidt B. Reynolds G.P. Jellinger K. Youdim M.B.H. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). However, data from animal models show that GSH depletion by itself is not sufficient to induce nigral degeneration (18Wullner U. Loschmann P.A. Schulz J.B. Schmid A. Dringen R. Eblen F. Turski L.

Neural Transm. 1997; 104: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dopamine (DA) neurons in culture seem to be more resistant to GSH decrease than other midbrain cell populations (20Nakamura K. Wang W. Kuang U.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1850-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 21Nakamura K. Wright D.A. Wiatr T. Kowlessur D. Milstien S. Lei X.G. Kang U.J. J.

However, the reduction of GSH levels may rather enhance the susceptibility of DA cells to the toxicity of other insults, promoting the neurodegenerative process. For example, GSH depletion induced by l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO) treatment, a selective GSH synthesis inhibitor (23Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13704-13712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), enhances the susceptibility of DA neurons to the toxicity of the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor MPTP/MPP+in vivo (18Wullner U.

Kuang U.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1850-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), potentiates the toxicity of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in rat striatum (24Pileblad E. Magnusson T. Fornstedt B. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 978-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and even changes the DA cell-specific trophic effect of NO in midbrain cultures into one that is neurotoxic (25Canals S. Casarejos M.J. de Bernardo S. RodriÌguez-MartiÌn E. Mena M.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We have described previously a culture model in which one of these interactions was clearly stated. In midbrain cultures, the short lived NO donor diethyl-amine/nitric oxide-complexed sodium (DEA/NO), at doses of 25 and 50 Î¼m, selectively increases the number of tyrosine hydroxylase positive (TH+) cells, TH+ neurite processes, DA syntheses, and [3H]DA uptake (26Canals S. Casarejos M.J. RodriÌguez-MartiÌn E. de Bernardo S. Mena M.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this DA cell-specific neurotropism of NO disappears when GSH content is lowered to 50% by BSO pretreatment (25Canals S. Casarejos M.J. de Bernardo S. RodriÌguez-MartiÌn E. Mena M.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), a GSH depletion similar to that occurring in PD (2Perry T.L. Godin D.V. Hansen S. Neurosci.

Neurol. 1994; 36: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). In addition, under GSH-decreased conditions, neurotrophic doses of NO trigger a programmed cell death with dependence on guanylate cyclase (GC) and cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) activation. Also, we have shown that the GC activation that mediates cell death is not produced by NO (25Canals S. Casarejos M.J. de Bernardo S. RodriÌguez-MartiÌn E. Mena M.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the present work we go far inside the mechanism related to the neurotoxic interaction between decreased GSH levels and NO by exploring the possible participation of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism. AA is an important component of membrane lipids that can activate several signaling pathways directly by itself or by its metabolites through lipoxygenase (LOX), cyclooxygenase (COX), or epoxygenase pathways (27Shimizu T. Wolfe L.S. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). In nervous tissue, the major enzymatic route for AA metabolism is the 12-LOX pathway, and the resulting metabolites play an important role in neuronal signaling and degeneration (28Piomelli D. Greengard P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 367-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 29Farooqui A.A. Horrocks L.A. J. Neurosci.

Several observations suggest that 12-LOX may participate in cell death triggered by NO in GSH-decreased conditions. First, GSH depletion can induce the activation of 12-LOX (31Shornick L.P. Holtzman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 371-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and such a mechanism is related to neuronal death in GSH-depleted cultures (32Li Y. Maher P. Schubert D. Neuron. 1997; 19: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Second, 12-HPETE, the initial AA metabolite from 12-LOX, is a potent activator of GC (33BruÌne B. Ullrich V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 671-678PubMed Google Scholar), and a NO-independent GC activation is necessary for cell death in our model (25Canals S. Casarejos M.J. de Bernardo S. RodriÌguez-MartiÌn E. Mena M.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Finally, NO has been shown to potentiate AA metabolism by activating phospholipase (PLA) A2 (34Gross R.W. Rudolph A.E. Wang J. Sommers C.D. Wolf M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14855-14858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 35Guidarelli A. Palomba L. Cantoni O. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1539-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or inhibiting AA re-esterification to membrane (36Ma Z. Ramanadham S. Corbett J.A. Bohrer A. Gross R.W. McDaniel M.L.

Neuropathol. 1996; 29: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Here we show that NO and GSH synergically interact at the AA metabolic pathway to induce cell death in midbrain cultures. Culture MediaâDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (4.5g/liter), Ham's F12 nutrient mixture, Eagle's minimal essential medium with Earl's salts, and Leibovitz's l-15 medium, all of which were supplemented with l-glutamine, fetal calf serum (FCS), sodium pyruvate, and l-glutamine, were purchased from Invitrogen. Glucose (45%), insulin, putrescine, progesterone, and sodium selenite were from Sigma, and human transferrin (30% iron-saturated) was from Roche Applied Science. AntibodiesâRabbit polyclonal anti-mouse leukocyte 12-lipoxygenase antibody was from Alexis (Carlsbad, CA); mouse monoclonal anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) antibody was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA); O1 was obtained from hybridoma supernatants (38Raff M.C. Fields K.L. Hakomori S. Mirsky R. Pruss R.M. Winter J. Brain Res. 1979; 174: 283-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar); polyclonal anti-GFAP antibody, raised in rabbits, was from DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark); the anti-microtubule-associated protein 2a + 2b (MAP-2) antibody, the mouse monoclonal anti-Î²-actin antibody, and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) were purchased from Sigma; anti-mouse Ig fluorescein was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA); and anti-mouse IgM Alexa FluorÂ® 488 was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). ChemicalsâPoly-d-lysine, p-phenylenediamine, bis-benzimide, BSO, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), DTNB, and reduced and oxidized forms of glutathione and AA were from Sigma. DEA/NO was from Alexis. NADPH, the cytotoxicity detection kit (lactate dehydrogenase, or LDH), cell proliferation kit I (3-(4,5-dimethyldiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, or MTT), and GSH reductase (GR) were from Roche Applied Science. 12-HPETE, 12-HETE, and LY-83583 were from Biomol (Plymouth, PA). KT5823, baicalein, nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), indomethacin, and clotrimazole were from Calbiochem. The BCA protein assay kit was from Pierce. All other reagents were of the highest purity commercially available from Merck or Sigma. Neuronal CultureâNeuronal enriched cultures from embryonic Sprague-Dawley rat midbrain E-14 (crown rump, length 10â12 mm) were obtained and prepared as described previously (39Mena M.A. Pardo B. PaiÌno C.L. de YeÌbenes J.G. Neuroreport. 1993; 4: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 40Pardo B. PaiÌno C.L. Casarejos M.J. Mena M.A. Brain Res. Brain Res. Protoc. 1997; 1: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The cells were seeded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 15% fetal calf serum at a density of 105 cells/cm2 in multiwells or glass cover slides previously coated with poly-d-lysine, 4.5 Î¼g/cm2, in 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 8.4. The cultures were kept in a humidified chamber at 37 Â°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Twenty-four hours after plating, the cells were changed to a serum-free defined medium (EF12) as reported elsewhere (39Mena M.A. Pardo B. PaiÌno C.L. de YeÌbenes J.G. Neuroreport. 1993; 4: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 40Pardo B. PaiÌno C.L. Casarejos M.J. Mena M.A. Brain Res. Brain Res. Protoc. 1997; 1: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). EF12 consisted of a 1:1 (v/v) Eagle's minimal essential medium and nutrient mixture of Ham's F-12 supplemented with d-glucose (6 mg/ml), insulin (25 Î¼g/ml), transferrin (100 Î¼g/ml), putrescine (60 Î¼m), progesterone (20 nm), and sodium selenite (30 nm). Experimental TreatmentsâIn the experiments designed to study interactions between NO and GSH depletion on cell viability, the cells, after 4 days in culture, received 20 Î¼m BSO or vehicle, and then, on the 5th day, pre-established groups were treated with the NO donor DEA/NO (50 or 100 Î¼m) for an additional 24 h. Enzyme inhibitors for the three pathways of the AA metabolism, i.e. the LOX pathway (NDGA and baicalein), the COX pathway (indomethacin), and the epoxygenase pathway (clotrimazole and proadifen) or its corresponding solvents, were routinely added 30 min before DEA/NO treatment or up to 10 h later. For experiments with AA and 12-LOX metabolites, cultures were treated with BSO as above and, on the 5th day, received several doses of AA, 12-HPETE, 12-HETE, or solvent for an additional 24 h. Finally, experiments for time course effects of 100 Î¼m DEA/NO or 20 Î¼m BSO on 12-LOX expression, alone or in combination, were also depicted. The long term effect of GSH synthesis inhibition on cell viability was also studied. The cells received 20 Î¼m BSO as above, and the treatment proceeded for up to 4 days (the 8th day in vitro). In this experimental design, enzyme inhibitors or vehicles were added to the culture on the 5th day in vitro. The participation of 12-LOX in neurotoxicity induced by higher doses of NO under normal GSH homeostasis was investigated by pretreating cultures with NDGA or baicalein 30 min before the addition of 200 and 400 Î¼m DEA/NO. ImmunocytochemistryâDA neurons were characterized by immunostaining with a mouse monoclonal anti-TH antibody (1:100), astrocytes with a rabbit polyclonal anti-GFAP antibody (1:500), and oligodendrocytes with monoclonal anti-O1 (1:10) (41Sommer I. Schachner M. Dev. Biol. 1981; 83: 311-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). To detect all neurons in the culture, a mouse monoclonal anti-MAP-2 antibody (1:250) was used. For TH, GFAP, and MAP-2 immunostaining, cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, permeabilized with ethanol-acetic acid (19:1), and incubated at 4 Â°C for 24 h with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum. Fluorescein- and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies were employed to visualize positive cells under fluorescent microscopy. For oligodendrocyte detection, anti-O1 antibody was added directly (1:10) to living cells and incubated for 15 min at room temperature, washed in PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde previous to anti-mouse IgM Alexa FluorÂ® 488 development. The number of immunoreactive cells was counted in one-seventh of the total area of the cover slides. The cells were counted in predefined parallel strips using a counting reticule inserted in the ocular. Cell Viability MeasurementsâMitochondrial activity was measured with the MTT assay. Cells were grown on 24-well culture plates with 500 Î¼l of defined medium and treated with various reagents according to the experimental design. The MTT assay measures the ability of cells to metabolize MTT. At the end of the treatment period, 300 Î¼l of culture medium were removed from each well, and 20 Î¼l of MTT solution (5 mg/ml) were added and incubated for 1 h. At this time, 200 Î¼l of solubilization solution (10% SDS in HCl, 0.01 m) were then added to the wells, and, after 24 h of incubation at 37 Â°C, 100 Î¼l were transferred onto 96-well microtiter plates, and the absorption value at 540 nm was measured in an automatic microtiter reader (Spectra Fluor, Tecan). Chromatin condensation was assessed by DNA staining with bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33342). Cells growing on cover slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and the nuclei were stained with bis-benzimide added in the anti-fading solution (3 Ã 10â6m, final concentration) (40Pardo B. PaiÌno C.L. Casarejos M.J. Mena M.A. Brain Res. Brain Res. Protoc. 1997; 1: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 42Hilwig I. Gropp A. Exp. Cell Res. 1975; 91: 457-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and counted on one-fourteenth of the cover slide area. For necrotic cell death determination, LDH activity was measured in the culture medium by using a cytotoxicity detection kit (43Decker T. Lohmann-Matthes M.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 115: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar) and expressed as a percentage versus detergent-extracted controls (100% cytotoxicity). In our system, LDH release to the culture medium correlates with cell death measured by a trypan blue dye exclusion assay (26Canals S. Casarejos M.J. RodriÌguez-MartiÌn E. de Bernardo S. Mena M.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Western Blot AnalysisâPrimary midbrain cultures were homogenized with a sonicator in buffer containing 20 mm Tris HCl, 10 mm acetyl lysine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin (5 Î¼g/ml each), and 0.25% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4, and then centrifuged at 12,000 Ã g for 30 min at 4 Â°C. The supernatant was used for protein determination by the BCA protein assay kit and for electrophoretical separation. Samples (30 Î¼g) were added to SDS sample loading buffer, electrophoresed in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and then electroblotted to 0.45-Î¼m nitrocellulose membranes. For immunolabeling, the blots were blocked with TTBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl plus 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 5% dry skimmed milk) for 1 h at room temperature. After blocking nonspecific binding, the membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-12-LOX (1:2000) and mouse anti-Î²-actin (1:10000) in blocking solution overnight at 4 Â°C. The blots were developed by chemiluminiscence detection using a commercial kit (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified by computer-assisted video densitometry. Î²-actin was employed as a control of charge. Glutathione MeasurementsâTotal glutathione levels were measured by the method of Tietze in 1969 (44Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5555) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 Ã 105 cells were washed with PBS, lysed in 100 Î¼l of 3% perchloric acid (PCA) for 30 min at 4 Â°C, centrifuged, and the supernatants were neutralized with 4 volumes of 0.1 m NaH2PO4 and 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. Fifty microliters of the resulting supernatants were mixed with DTNB (0.6 mm), NADPH (0.2 mm), and glutathione reductase (1 unit), and the reaction was monitored in a P96 automatic microtiter reader at 412 nm for 6 min. Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was measured in the cells by the method of Griffith in 1980 (45Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4059) Google Scholar). Briefly, after perchloric acid extraction and pH neutralization, GSH was derivatized with 2-vinylpyridine at room temperature for 1 h, and the reaction was carried out as described above. GSH was obtained by subtracting GSSG levels from total glutathione levels. Statistical AnalysisâThe results were statistically evaluated for significance with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test as a post hoc evaluation. Differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Inhibitors of Lipoxygenase Block NO-triggered Cell Death in GSH-depleted CulturesâMidbrain cultures treated for 24 h with 20 Î¼m BSO decreased its GSH content from 17.5 Â± 0.4 Î¼g/mg of protein to 3.7 Â± 0.1 Î¼g/mg of protein (â20% versus control). In these GSH-depleted conditions, treatment of cultures for an additional 24 h with the NO donor DEA/NO at doses previously shown to be neurotrophic for DA neurons (50 Î¼m) results in extensive cell death in the culture (Fig. 1, a and b). The death process is characterized by a 75â85% loss of mitochondrial activity measured by MTT assay, a 30â35% increase in LDH release to the culture medium, and 70â80% of cells with chromatin condensation without DNA fragmentation (Figs. 1, a and b, and 2; and data not shown), as shown previously (25Canals S. Casarejos M.J. de Bernardo S. RodriÌguez-MartiÌn E. Mena M.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, this rate of GSH synthesis inhibition by itself did not induce cell death in the culture at 48 h (Fig. 2, a and b) or at 72 h (data not shown) in accordance with previously reported data for neuronal enriched midbrain cultures (25Canals S. Casarejos M.J. de Bernardo S. RodriÌguez-MartiÌn E. Mena M.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 46Mytilineou C. Kokotos-Leonardi E.T. Kramer B.C. Jamindar T. Olanow C.W. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To investigate the possible role of lipoxygenase in cell death in the above conditions, we first used the general LOX inhibitor NDGA. Added 30 min before the NO treatment, NDGA preserves cell viability in the culture (75â80% of controls viability) and totally blocks LDH release and chromatin condensation induced by BSO + DEA/NO treatment (Figs. 1c and 2, aâc). The concentration required for maximal protection was 0.5 Î¼m, being toxic to the culture up to 2.5 Î¼m (data not shown). Because 12-LOX is the predominant brain isoform of this enzyme (28Piomelli D. Greengard P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 367-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), we tested baicalein, a selective 12-LOX inhibitor, for cell viability assays. As seen for NDGA, baicalein rescues all viability parameters measured in the culture with maximal protection observed at 2.5 Î¼m (Figs. 1d and 2, aâd). Both inhibitors protect against cell death induced by 50 Î¼m as well as 100 Î¼m DEA/NO in BSO-pretreated cultures (Fig. 2, aâd) without interfering with BSO-induced GSH depletion (data not shown).Fig. 212-Lipoxygenase inhibition protects from NO-induced toxicity in GSH-decreased midbrain cultures. After 4 days in vitro, the cultures were treated with 20 Î¼m BSO, and then, on the 5th day, pre-established groups were treated with NDGA (0.5 Î¼m), baicalein (Bai; 2.5 Î¼m), indomethacin (Ind;25 Î¼m), clotrimazole (Clo;5 Î¼m), proadifen (Pro;10 Î¼m), or vehicle, and 30 min later they were treated with DEA/NO (D;50â100 Î¼m) for 24 h. Panel a, cell viability measured by MTT assay and presented as a percentage versus controls. Panel b, cell cytotoxicity measured by LDH activity in the culture medium. Panel c, chromatin-condensed nuclei stained with bis-benzimide and expressed as a percentage versus total cell number. In panels d and e, baicalein (Bai, 2.5 Î¼m) was added to the cultures 30 min before DEA/NO treatment or up to 10 h later; alternatively, ascorbic acid (Asc, 200 Î¼m) was added to the culture 10 h after DEA/NO treatment. After 24 h of DEA/NO addition, cell viabilit"
https://openalex.org/W2036798760,"Borehole data from young sediments folded above the Puente Hills blind thrust fault beneath Los Angeles reveal that the folding extends to the surface as a discrete zone (â¤145 meters wide). Buried fold scarps within an upward- narrowing zone of deformation, which extends from the upward termination of the thrust ramp at 3 kilometers depth to the surface, document the occurrence of at least four large (moment-magnitude 7.2 to 7.5) earthquakes on this fault during the past 11,000 years. Future events of this type pose a seismic hazard to metropolitan Los Angeles. Moreover, the methods developed in this study can be used to refine seismic hazard assessments of blind thrusts in other metropolitan regions."
https://openalex.org/W2059916510,"When starved for amino acids, Saccharomyces cerevisiae accumulates uncharged tRNAs to activate its sole eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2Î± kinase GCN2. Subsequent phosphorylation of eIF2Î± impedes general translation, but translationally derepresses the transcription factor GCN4, which induces expression of various biosynthetic genes to elicit general amino acid control response. By contrast, when supplied with enough nutrients, the yeast activates the target of rapamycin signaling pathway to stimulate translation initiation by facilitating the assembly of eIF4F. A cross-talk was suggested between the two pathways by rapamycin-induced translation of GCN4 mRNA. Here we show that rapamycin causes an increase in phosphorylated eIF2Î± to translationally derepress GCN4. This increment is not observed in the cells expressing mammalian non-GCN2 eIF2Î± kinases in place of GCN2. It is thus suggested that rapamycin does not inhibit dephosphorylation of eIF2Î± but rather activates the kinase GCN2. This activation seems to require an interaction between the kinase and uncharged tRNAs, because rapamycin, similar to amino acid starvation, fails to induce eIF2Î± phosphorylation in the cells with GCN2 defective in tRNA binding. However, in contrast with amino acid starvation, rapamycin activates GCN2 without increasing the amount of uncharged tRNAs, but presumably by modifying the tRNA binding affinity of GCN2.

However, in contrast with amino acid starvation, rapamycin activates GCN2 without increasing the amount of uncharged tRNAs, but presumably by modifying the tRNA binding affinity of GCN2. In response to starvation for a single amino acid, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae induces numerous biosynthetic genes not only for the starved amino acid but also for other non-starved ones. This response is designated as general amino acid control and has been extensively studied as a paradigm for eukaryotic gene regulation (1Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 2Hinnebusch A.G. Natarajan K. Eukaryotic Cell. 2002; 1: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Consequently, a master gene activator GCN4 has been demonstrated to govern the concerted induction of a large group of biosynthetic genes (1Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 2Hinnebusch A.G. Natarajan K. Eukaryotic Cell. 2002; 1: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the synthesis of GCN4 itself is regulated mainly at the level of translation: amino acid starvation derepresses translation of GCN4 mRNA. This derepression is mediated by a unique mechanism that requires both the four short open reading frames (ORFs) 1The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; His-RS, histidyl-tRNA synthetase; TOR, target of rapamycin; HRI, heme-regulated inhibitor; PKR, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase; SCR, synthetic complete medium containing 2% raffinose; 3AT, 3-aminotriazole; SC, synthetic complete medium; eIF2Î±[pS51], eIF2Î± phosphorylated at Ser-51. 1The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; His-RS, histidyl-tRNA synthetase; TOR, target of rapamycin; HRI, heme-regulated inhibitor; PKR, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase; SCR, synthetic complete medium containing 2% raffinose; 3AT, 3-aminotriazole; SC, synthetic complete medium; eIF2Î±[pS51], eIF2Î± phosphorylated at Ser-51. in its 5â²-leader region and a decrease in the ternary complex composed of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), GTP, and methionyl initiator-tRNA (1Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 2Hinnebusch A.G. Natarajan K. Eukaryotic Cell. 2002; 1: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 3Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The decrease is induced by phosphorylation of eIF2Î±, because it converts the GDP-bound eIF2 from a substrate to an inhibitor of eIF2B, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for eIF2, thereby leading to a decline of eIF2-GTP. The phosphorylation of eIF2Î± constitutes an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for eukaryotic translational control (3Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). In contrast with mammals bearing four eIF2Î± kinases, the budding yeast has the sole kinase GCN2, which is activated by accumulation of uncharged tRNAs due to amino acid starvation. GCN2 binds uncharged tRNAs via its histidyl-tRNA synthetase (His-RS)-related region. While GCN2 is activated by various stresses other than amino acid starvation, including purine deprivation, glucose limitation, high salinity, and exposure to an alkylating agent, the His-RS-related region has proven essential in all of the cases examined (2Hinnebusch A.G. Natarajan K. Eukaryotic Cell. 2002; 1: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). When supplied with enough nutrients, the yeast cells activate translation for cell growth and proliferation, in which the target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway plays a central role (4Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar, 5Rohde J. Heitman J. Cardenas M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9583-9586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 6Raught B. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7037-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The TOR protein, a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase superfamily, is involved in regulation of various cellular processes, including transcription, stabilization of mRNAs, translation initiation and elongation, biogenesis of tRNAs and ribosome, turnover of nutrient transporters, protein kinase C signaling, and autophagy (4Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar, 5Rohde J. Heitman J. Cardenas M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9583-9586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). For the translation initiation, TOR proteins are known to facilitate the assembly of eIF4F, a heterotrimeric complex composed of eIF4A, -4E, and -4G (6Raught B. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7037-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The eIF4F binds the 7-methylguanosine-containing cap structure via eIF4E to recruit mRNA to ribosome. Since both general control and the TOR signaling play important roles in translational response to nutritional variation, it is likely that these pathways are coordinately regulated. We thus examined a possible cross-talk between the two pathways and obtained evidence that GCN2 is activated by rapamycin via a novel mechanism independent of an increment of uncharged tRNAs. StrainsâThe strains used are W303H (MATaade2â1 trp1â1 leu2â3 ura3â1 can1â100), WH1 (MATaade2â1 trp1â1 leu2â3 ura3â1 can1â100 gcn1Î::KanMX), WH2 (MATaade2â1 trp1â1 leu2â3 ura3â1 can1â100gcn2Î::KanMX), WH3 (MATaade2â1 trp1â1 leu2â3 ura3â1 can1â100 TOR1â1), WH9 (MATaade2â1 trp1â1 leu2â3 ura3â1 can1â100 gcn2-S577A), and WH10 (MATaade2â1 trp1â1 leu2â3 ura3â1 can1â100 gcn2-S577E). PlasmidsâThe plasmid p180 is a low copy number reporter construct to monitor translational derepression of GCN4 (7Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). It encodes for an mRNA bearing GCN4-lacZ fusion ORF preceded by the entire 5â²-leader region of GCN4 mRNA, which contains four upstream ORFs responsible for the derepression (1Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The plasmid pYC is a centromeretype variant of pYES2, an expression vector using GAL1 promoter (Invitrogen). The pYC01 expressing GCN2 under a control of GAL1 promoter was constructed by gap-repair cloning of the ORF for GCN2. The pYC02 and pYC03, expressing heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) and double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR), were constructed by transferring the SphI-KpnI fragment of p1246 and p1420 to pYC, respectively (8Marton M.J. Crouch D. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3541-3556Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The pYC04 bearing gcn2-m2 allele (9Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was constructed from pYC01 by site-directed mutagenesis. The WH2 cells bearing these eIF2Î± kinase plasmids were cultivated in SCR (synthetic complete medium containing raffinose instead of glucose) lacking uracil and shifted to SCR â Ura â His + 20 mm 3-aminotriazole (3AT) or SCR â Ura + 200 ng/ml rapamycin. Reporter Assay for Translational Derepression of GCN4 mRNAâThe yeast cells bearing p180 were treated with either 200 ng/ml rapamycin or 20 mm 3AT in SC â Ura or SC â Ura â His, respectively, and assayed for Î²-galactosidase as described previously (10Kubota H. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20243-20246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Kubota H. Ota K. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17591-17596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting Analysis of eIF2Î±âImmunoblotting analysis of eIF2Î± was performed using an anti-eIF2Î± peptide antibody and the one specific to eIF2Î± phosphorylated at serine 51 (eIF2Î±[pS51]) (BIOSOURCE) as described previously (11Kubota H. Ota K. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17591-17596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis was performed as described (12Dever T.E. Chen J.-J. Barber G.N. Cigan A.M. Feng L. Donahue T.F. London I.M. Katze M.G. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were developed using a kit for enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amarsham Biosciences). Reverse Transcription-PCRâIsolation of total RNAs, reverse transcription, and PCR were performed as described previously (13Miura F. Yada T. Nakai K. Sakaki Y. Ito T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Analysis of tRNAsâAminoacylated tRNAs were analyzed as described (14Sarkar S. Azad A.K. Hopper A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 99: 190-195Google Scholar). Briefly, the yeast cells were disrupted by vigorous shaking with glass beads in AE buffer (50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.3), 10 mm EDTA) at 4 Â°C. Total RNAs were extracted with AE-saturated phenol and precipitated with ethanol. Deacylated tRNAs were prepared by heating at 75 Â°C in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 5 min. Total RNAs (10 Î¼g) were separated at 4 Â°C by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). Separated RNAs were blotted onto Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized with radiolabeled probe for each tRNA species. Rapamycin Derepresses Translation of GCN4 mRNAâTo test a possible cross talk between general control response and the TOR signaling, we examined the effect of rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of TOR proteins, on translational derepression of GCN4 mRNA. To monitor the derepression, we employed the p180 reporter construct bearing the 5â²-leader region of GCN4 mRNA followed by lacZ ORF (7Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). When the yeast cells harboring p180 were treated with 3AT, an inducer of histidine starvation, Î²-galactosidase activity was induced as described previously (7Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 11Kubota H. Ota K. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17591-17596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). We treated the same strain with rapamycin, whose action was confirmed in both wild and TOR1â1 cells by monitoring mRNAs for DAL4 and RPL4A, known to be induced and suppressed, respectively, by rapamycin in a TOR-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1A, an increase was observed in Î²-galactosidase activity upon rapamycin treatment. Furthermore, we found that the cells bearing TOR1â1 allele induce the reporter in response to 3AT but not to rapamycin (Fig. 1A). These results indicate that the TOR signaling pathway is involved in modulation of GCN4 translation. Rapamycin-induced derepression of GCN4 mRNA was independently reported by others during the course of this work (15Valenzuela L. Aranda C. Gonzalez A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2331-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Rapamycin-induced Translation of GCN4 mRNA Requires GCN2-mediated Phosphorylation of eIF2Î±âTranslational derepression of GCN4 mRNA does not always require the eIF2Î± kinase GCN2; several alternative mechanisms independent of GCN2 have been reported. For instance, a shift from amino acid-rich to minimal medium was shown to induce GCN4 translation independently of GCN2 (16Tzamarias D. Roussou I. Thireos G. Cell. 1989; 57: 947-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The reduction in amount or impairment in base modification of the initiator tRNA also leads to GCN2-independent derepression of GCN4 translation (1Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 17Anderson J. Phan L. Cuesta R. Carlson B.A. Pak M. Asano K. BjoÌrk G.R. Tamame M. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3650-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of the RNA component of RNase MRP or tRNA pseudouridine 55 synthetase results in GCN4 derepression without activating GCN2 (18Tavernarakis N. Alexandraki D. Liodis P. Tzamarias D. Thireos G. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 179: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 19Qiu H. Hu C. Anderson J. BjoÌrk G.R. Sarkar S. Hopper A.K. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2505-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). More recently, fusel alcohols such as butanol were shown to translationally induce GCN4 in a GCN2-independent manner (20Ashe M.P. Slaven J.W. De Long S.K. Ibrahimo S. Sachs A.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6464-6474Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is thus important to examine whether rapamycin-induced GCN4 translation accompanies an increase in phosphorylated eIF2Î±. We performed an immunoblot analysis using an antibody specific to eIF2Î±[pS51]. The results indicated that rapamycin, similar to 3AT, induces a significant increase in eIF2Î±[pS51], but, importantly, does not affect total eIF2Î± levels (Fig. 1C). Judging from these results and previous studies on 3AT-treated cells (1Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 2Hinnebusch A.G. Natarajan K. Eukaryotic Cell. 2002; 1: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), we assume that â¼50% of eIF2Î± can be phosphorylated by rapamycin-treatment. Interestingly, rapamycin, but not 3AT, failed to increase eIF2Î±[pS51] in the cells bearing TOR1â1 allele, which we had shown to be incapable of derepressing translation of GCN4 mRNA in response to rapamycin (Fig. 1C). We next intended to know whether the observed increase in eIF2Î±[pS51] is required for the rapamycin-induced translation of GCN4 mRNA. For this purpose, we examined the yeast cells deleted for GCN2, because the gcn2Î cell contains no eIF2Î± kinase activity and thus lacks eIF2Î±[pS51] (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 1C, rapamycin, similar to 3AT, totally failed to induce Î²-galatosidase activity in the gcn2Î cells. To further confirm the importance of the phosphorylation, we examined a strain deleted for GCN1, which encodes a GCN2-binding protein required for in vivo activation of the eIF2Î± kinase (10Kubota H. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20243-20246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Kubota H. Ota K. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2000; 17: 1887-1899Crossref Google Scholar, 22Sattlegger E. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The gcn1Î cells contain GCN2 in an amount comparable with that in the wild type cells, but fail to activate its kinase activity (8Marton M.J. Crouch D. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3541-3556Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, the gcn1Î cells could not induce the reporter activity upon rapamycin treatment. While a novel mode of GCN2 action independent of eIF2Î± phosphorylation was recently proposed (23Marbach I. Licht R. Frohnmeyer H. Engelberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16944-16951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), rapamycin-induced GCN4 translation requires the eIF2Î± kinase activity. Neither Histidine Starvation nor Rapamycin Inhibits Dephosphorylation of eIF2Î±[pS51]âTheoretically, an increment of eIF2Î±[pS51] can be achieved not only by activation of GCN2 but also by impeded dephosphorylation of eIF2Î±[pS51]. Involvement of both mechanisms would be also plausible. We thus intended to examine a possible role for compromised dephosphorylation in the increment of eIF2Î±[pS51] induced by amino acid starvation and rapamycin. For this purpose, we generated strains lacking GCN2 but instead expressing a mammalian non-GCN2 eIF2Î± kinase, namely HRI or PKR (3Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). While overexpression of these eIF2Î± kinases was previously reported to induce a slow growth phenotype (8Marton M.J. Crouch D. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3541-3556Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), our gcn2Î strain expressing HRI from a single copy vector displays no apparent growth defect in a raffinose medium. On the other hand, the growth of the PKR-expressing strain was impaired. While the expression of these kinases did not affect total eIF2Î± levels (Ref. 8Marton M.J. Crouch D. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3541-3556Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar and data not shown), both strains showed an induced level of eIF2Î±[pS51] comparable with that in the parental GCN2 cells subject to histidine starvation or rapamycin treatment (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the overexpressed eIF2Î± kinases are somehow disregulated and hence partly activated, as also shown in the previous study (8Marton M.J. Crouch D. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3541-3556Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). If amino acid starvation leads to inhibition of eIF2Î±[pS51] phosphatase(s), the steady-state level of eIF2Î±[pS51] is expected to increase even in the cells expressing the non-GCN2 kinases that are not activated by amino acid starvation (24Lu L. Han A.-P. Chen J.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7971-7980Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 25Kimball S.R. Clements M.J. Tilleray V.J. Wek R.C. Horetsky R.L. Jefferson L.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We made the HRI-expressing cells starved for histidine and examined the amount of eIF2Î±[pS51]. In contrast with GCN2-expressing cells, histidine starvation did not increase eIF2Î±[pS51] in the HRI-expressing cells (Fig. 2). We also examined the PKR-expressing cells to find no change in the amount of eIF2Î±[pS51] (Fig. 2). It thus seems that amino acid starvation does not affect dephosphorylation of eIF2Î±[pS51]. We next examined the effect of rapamycin on dephosphorylation of eIF2Î±[pS51] using the same strains. We failed to detect any noticeable change in the amount of eIF2Î±[pS51] in the rapamycin-treated HRI-expressing cells (Fig. 2). Similarly, the PKR-expressing cells failed to increase eIF2Î±[pS51] upon rapamycin treatment (Fig. 2). While no evidence has ever been provided for or against rapamycin-induced modulation of HRI or PKR activity, it is highly unlikely that rapamycin affects both the kinases and phosphatase so finely as to keep the steady-state level of eIF2Î±[pS51] unaffected. It is thus strongly suggested that rapamycin, similar to amino acid starvation, does not inhibit dephosphorylation of eIF2Î±[pS51]. Rapamycin-induced Activation of GCN2 Requires Binding to Uncharged tRNAsâThe results described above indicate that rapamycin induces an increase in eIF2Î±[pS51] via activation of the kinase GCN2. To be activated by amino acid starvation and other various stimuli, GCN2 has to bind uncharged tRNA via its His-RS-like domain (2Hinnebusch A.G. Natarajan K. Eukaryotic Cell. 2002; 1: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 9Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We thus examined whether rapamycin-induced GCN2 activation requires an interaction with tRNA using gcn2-m2 mutant defective in tRNA binding (9Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the gcn2-m2 cells, maintaining a comparable eIF2Î± level to wild type cells (Ref. 9Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown), respond neither to histidine starvation nor to rapamycin. Thus, the activation of GCN2 by rapamycin, like that by amino acid starvation, requires an interaction of the kinase with uncharged tRNA. Rapamycin Activates GCN2 without Increasing Uncharged tRNAsâConfirming the requirement for tRNA binding, we next examined whether rapamycin induces an increase in the amount of uncharged tRNAs. Total tRNAs were isolated from histidine-starved and rapamycin-treated cells under a cooled acidic condition so as to minimize deacylation and analyzed by acid-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In this electrophoresis, aminoacylated tRNAs display more retarded mobility than uncharged ones, which were obtained through deacylation by a heat treatment under an alkaline condition (Fig. 4). As expected, 3AT-treatment facilitated deacylation of tRNA for histidine to prove the principle of the assay (Fig. 4). Replenishment of the 3AT-treated cells with histidine induced a rapid aminoacylation of the tRNA, thereby ceasing GCN2 activation to decline eIF2Î±[pS51]. Intriguingly, the aminoacylation induced by refeding of the starved amino acid was observed even in the cells pretreated with rapamycin. It thus seems that rapamycin does not affect de novo aminoacylation of tRNA. We next examined tRNAs isolated from the cells treated with rapamycin in a rich medium. Rapamycin-treatment increased eIF2Î± phosphorylation but failed to induce no apparent change in electrophoretic pattern of bulk tRNAs: most displayed more retarded mobility than alkaline-treated ones, indicative of aminoacylated states (data not shown). Such constitutive aminoacylation was more clearly demonstrated by visualization of specific tRNA on Northern blot (Fig. 4). Therefore, in contrast with amino acid starvation, rapamycin can activate GCN2 without increasing uncharged tRNAs. Ser-577 Plays a Role in Rapamycin-induced Activation of GCN2âIn the context described above, it is quite intriguing to note that phosphorylation of GCN2 at Ser-577 was recently reported to reduce its binding affinity to uncharged tRNAs (26Garcia-Barrio M. Dong J. Cherkasova V.A. Zhang X. Zhang F. Ufano S. Lai R. Qin J. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30675-30683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We thus examined gcn2-S577A mutant cells to know whether this residue plays a role in rapamycin-induced activation of GCN2. As expected, the mutant cells showed a significantly higher basal GCN2 activity than its parental cells (Fig. 5). Notably, rapamycin failed to further derepress GCN4 translation in the mutant cells (Fig. 5). The cells bearing gcn2-S577E allele, which had been shown to only partly mimic Ser-577-phosphorylated GCN2 (26Garcia-Barrio M. Dong J. Cherkasova V.A. Zhang X. Zhang F. Ufano S. Lai R. Qin J. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30675-30683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), also displayed a similar defective response to rapamycin (Fig. 5). It is thus likely that dephosphorylation of this residue is involved in rapamycin-induced GCN2 activation. ConclusionsâHere we demonstrated that rapamycin, similar to amino acid starvation, activates the eIF2Î± kinase GCN2 in an uncharged tRNA-dependent manner (Fig. 3), with constitutive dephosphorylation of eIF2Î±[pS51] (Fig. 2), to increase the amount of eIF2Î±[pS51], thereby leading to translational derepression of GCN4 mRNA (Fig. 1). However, in contrast with amino acid starvation, rapamycin can do so without increasing the amount of uncharged tRNAs (Fig. 4), but presumably by acting via dephosphorylation of Ser-577 to increase its tRNA-binding affinity (Fig. 5). Further pursuit of the mechanism for TOR-mediated inhibition of GCN2 would help us better understand not only the cross-talk between the two important pathways for nutritional stress response but the mode of action for rapamycin and its derivatives, which are currently used as immunosuppressants and potential anti-cancer drugs.

https://openalex.org/W2039841141,"Cytokines are known to induce apoptosis of pancreatic beta-cells. Impaired expression of the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 is one of the mechanisms involved. In this study, we identified a defect involving transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) in the expression of bcl-2. Exposure of mouse pancreatic beta-cell line, MIN6 cells, to cytokines (interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma) led to a significant (p < 0.01) decrease in Bcl-2 protein and mRNA levels. Cytokines decreased (56%) the activity of the bcl-2 promoter that contains a cAMP-response element (CRE) site. Similar decreases were seen with a luciferase reporter gene driven by tandem repeats of CRE and a CREB-specific Gal4-luciferase reporter, suggesting a defect at the level of CREB. The active phospho form (serine 133) of CREB diminished significantly (p < 0.01) in cells exposed to cytokines. Examination of signaling pathways upstream of CREB revealed a reduction in the active form of Akt. Cytokine-induced decrease of bcl-2 promoter activity was partially restored when cells were cotransfected with a constitutively active form of Akt. Several end points of cytokine action including decreases in phospho-CREB, phospho-Akt, and BCl-2 levels and activation of caspase-9 were observed in isolated mouse islets. Overexpression of wild-type CREB in MIN6 cells by plasmid transfection and adenoviral infection led to protection against cytokine-induced apoptosis. Adenoviral transfer of dominant-negative forms of CREB, on the other hand, resulted in activation of caspase-9 and exaggeration of cytokine-induced beta-cell apoptosis. Together, these results point to CREB as a novel target for strategies aimed at improving the survival of beta-cells."
https://openalex.org/W1986384054,"Previous studies have shown that collagen gel overlay induced selective proteolysis of focal adhesion complex proteins in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. In this study, we examined whether morphological and biochemical changes were present in cells cultured on collagen gel. We found that focal adhesion complex proteins, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK), talin, paxillin, and p130cas, but not vinculin, were decreased within 1 h when MDCK cells were cultured on collagen gel. Collagen gel-induced selective decrease of focal adhesion proteins was observed in all lines of cells examined, including epithelial, fibroblastic, and cancer cells. Matrigel also induced selective down-regulation of focal adhesion proteins. However, cells cultured on collagen gel- or matrigel-coated dishes did not show any changes of focal adhesion proteins. These data suggest that the physical nature of the gel, i.e. the rigidity, is involved in the expression of focal adhesion proteins. The collagen gel-induced down-regulation of focal adhesion complex proteins was caused by reduction of protein synthesis and activation of proteases such as calpain. Overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) or FAK-related non-kinase (FRNK) did not prevent collagen gel-induced down-regulation of the focal adhesion complex protein, whereas an anti-Î±2Î²1 integrin-neutralizing antibody completely blocked it.

Collagen fibrils can transduce signals through integrins and the receptor tyrosine kinase discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) (21Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 91: 869-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Interaction of ECM with its transmembrane receptor integrins causes subsequent cascades of protein-protein interaction and modification at the focal adhesion complex site and the recruitment of several cytoskeletal proteins to form the focal adhesion complex (22Hemler M.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Engagement of collagen with its receptor tyrosine kinase, DDR1, resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of DDR1 (23Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 24Shrivastava A Radziejewski C. Campbell E. Kovac L. McGlynn M. Ryan T.E. Davis S. Goldfarb M.P. Glass D.J. Lemke G. Yancopoulos G.D. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). However, the signaling pathways triggered by activation of DDR1 have not been well understood. Although collagen gel may exert both biochemical and biophysical impact on cells, its biophysical impact on cell biology has been largely unknown. Collagen gel is a flexible substrate with the rigidity of 30â100 pascals as measured by a dynamic mechanical analyzer. In contrast, a normal cell culture dish is non-flexible with a rigidity of more than 1 gigapascals. 2C.-C. Wu, Y.-H. Wang, M.-J. Tang, and H.-C. Chang, unpublished observations.2C.-C. Wu, Y.-H. Wang, M.-J. Tang, and H.-C. Chang, unpublished observations. Therefore, the biophysical effects of collagen gel on cells could be due to its physical property, i.e. very low rigidity. To differentiate the biophysical effects of collagen gel from its biochemical impacts, we employed cells cultured on collagen gel and a collagen gel-coated dish for comparison. Our previous report showed that collagen gel overlay induced selective proteolysis of focal adhesion complex proteins in MDCK cells (25Wang Y.K. Lin H.H. Tang M.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C1440-C1448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we employed various cell lines to examine whether collagen gel affected the expression of focal adhesion complex proteins via its physical nature. We found that collagen gel, but not collagen gel coating, induced selective down-regulation of focal adhesion proteins in all lines of cells examined. Our data demonstrated that lowered substratum rigidity regulated the expression of focal adhesion proteins. The signaling mechanism whereby the collagen gel regulated expression of focal adhesion was explored further. AnimalsâThe male Wistar rats were maintained in the Central Animal Center in National Cheng-Kung University Medical College. Cells and Cell CultureâMDCK, LLCPK1, NRK52E, Chang Liver, HeLa, TCCSUP, U373MG, NIH 3T3, and 293 cells were maintained in DMEM (high glucose or low glucose; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum under 5% CO2 at 37 Â°C. The cells were seeded on different substrata at a density of 3 Ã 105 cells/60-mm dish. Preparation of Collagen Gel, Matrigel, and Agarose GelâType I collagen was prepared from rat tail tendons according to the established procedure described previously (19Lin H.H. Yang T.P. Jiang S.T. Yang H.Y. Tang M.J. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 168-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Jiang S.T. Liao K.K. Liao M.C. Tang M.J. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1539-1548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The collagen stock solution was 1%, containing 10 mg of (dry weight) rat tail tendon dissolved in 1 ml of 0.025 n acetic acid. For the preparation of 0.3% collagen gel, 3 volumes of collagen stock were mixed with 5.7Ã DMEM (1 volume), 2.5% NaHCO3 (0.5 volume), 0.1 m HEPES (1 volume), 0.17 m CaCl2 (0.1 volume), 1n NaOH (0.1 volume), and 4.3 volumes of 1Ã culture medium (DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum) under chilled conditions. The mixtures were dispensed in the culture dish (2 ml/60-mm dish) and placed in an incubator (5% CO2 in air, 37 Â°C) to allow for gelation. After gelation, each culture was supplemented with 1.5 ml of culture medium containing DMEM and 10% fetal calf serum. To prepare the collagen gel-coated dish, chilled 0.3% collagen solution was added into culture dishes to cover the surface. The culture dish was then tilted, and the excess amount of collagen gel was aspirated. The collagen gel-coated dishes were air dried and washed twice by normal culture medium prior to the use. For the preparation of matrigel, a stock of 11.7 mg/ml matrigel (BD Biosciences) was diluted by culture medium to the concentration of 3.9 mg/ml, and the matrigel solution was placed in an incubator to allow for gelation. The preparation of matrigel-coated dishes was generally the same as the preparation of collagen gel-coated dishes. To prepare collagen-coated agarose gel, the agarose dissolved in normal culture medium was heated by microwave and allowed for gelation at room temperature. The agarose gel was coated by 0.3% collagen gel according to the method of preparation of a collagen gel-coated dish. Collection of Cell Lysates and Western BlotâThe cells were cultured on a dish, a collagen gel-coated dish, and a collagen gel. Cell lysates were harvested in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (RIPA) buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10% glycersol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and Completeâ¢) at distinct times, and the lysates were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against FAK, PYK2, paxillin, calnexin (BD Transduction Laboratories), P130cas, c-Src, DDR 1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), vinculin, talin (Biogenesis), and phosphotyrosine (4G10; from Upstate Biotechnology), and by use of an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences). RT-PCRâTotal RNA of the cells was extracted by a Trizol commercial kit (Invitrogen). For RT-PCR, first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 0.2â1 Î¼g of total RNA with an oligo-dT primer and the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (Promega). The following primers from conserved regions of different species for FAK are FAK F (5â²-GTAGTGAGCCAACCACCTGG-3â²) and FAK R (5â²-GCCCTTGTCTGTCAGGTAAC-3â²). The resulting PCR product was 370 bp. Talin primers are TAL F (5â²-GAAATTGAGGCCAAGGTCCG-3â²) and TAL R (5â²GCCTTCAGTCGTCTGTACTG3â²). c-Src primers are SRC F (5â²-AGCTGGTGGAGCACTACACC-3â²) and SRC R (5â²-CCCCTTGGCCATGTACTCTG-3â²). GAPDH primers are GAPDH F (5â²-ACGGCACAGTCAAGGCTGAG-3â²) and GAPDH R (5â²-GGAGGCCATGTAGACCATGAGG-3â²). The PCR protocol was performed with the FAK, talin, or c-Src primers at 94 Â°C for 2 min, 53 Â°C for 30 s, and 72 Â°C for 1 min (35 cycles), followed by 72 Â°C for 10 min. The PCR protocol was performed with the GAPDH primer at 94 Â°C for 2 min, 58Â° for 1 min, and 72Â° for 1 min (25 cycles), followed by 72Â° for 10 min. Measurement of Protein Synthesis RatesâMDCK cells were cultured on dish, collagen gel-coated dish, or collagen gel for 3, 7, 17, or 23 h. Cells were serum starved for 1 h and treated with medium containing [35S]methionine (1 Î¼Ci/ml) for another 1 h. Cellular proteins were then precipitated by chilled 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the precipitates were solved in 0.5 n NaOH. The radioactivities were measured by Î²-counter. Cloning and Selection of Stable Clone of DDR1 in MDCK CellâThe DDR1 construct was produced by PCR amplification of the full-length DDR1b cDNA generated by the RT-PCR method using total RNA of the A431 cell as template. The 2.8-kb EcoRI-XbaI fragment of the PCR product was ligated to the plasmid pcDNA3.1 that contained a 3â²-Myc epitope. To generate the carboxyl-terminal truncated DDR1 construct, the DDR 1 construct was digested by XhoI and XbaI, followed by treatment with the Klenow enzyme and ligase to generate the carboxyl-terminal truncated clone that encoded 524 amino acids. The truncated DDR1b clone was cloned into a pcDNA 3.1 plasmid. The plasmid containing DDR1b or truncated DDR1 was transfected into MDCK clone II 3B5 and selected by G418. Immunofluorescence and Confocal StudyâMDCK cells cultured on dish, collagen gel coated dish, or collagen gel for 4 h were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde prepared in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times in PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and then incubated with anti-FAK monoclonal Ab for 1 h. Cells were then washed and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ab (Molecular Probes) and phalloidin-TRITC (from Sigma) for 1 h. The immunofluorescent images were taken by confocal microscopy (Leica, TCS-SP2). Collagen Gel Induced Down-regulation of Focal Adhesion Complex ProteinsâTo understand the mechanism of collagen gel-induced changes in MDCK cells, we first examined the expression of focal adhesion complex proteins in MDCK cells cultured on dish, collagen gel-coated dish, or collagen gel. MDCK cells cultured on a collagen-coated dish had a slightly retracted morphology in comparison with cells cultured on a normal dish (Fig. 1A). Meanwhile, MDCK cells cultured on collagen gel exhibited round-up morphology 1 h after attachment and gradually developed more retractile and elongated morphology later on (Fig. 1A). We found that FAK was significantly decreased as early as 1 h in cells cultured on collagen gel, and the decrease persisted for 24 h (Fig. 1B). Meanwhile, FAK remained intact in cells cultured on dish or collagen gel-coated dish, suggesting that the physical property of collagen gel per se induced a decrease in FAK levels. Other focal adhesion complex proteins such as talin, paxillin, the FAK family protein PYK2, and the FAK downstream protein p130cas were decreased with time course similar to that of FAK when the cells were cultured on collagen gel. However, vinculin, Î²-actin, the cytosolic protein c-Src, and the endoplasmic reticulum protein calnexin remained intact. These data suggested that collagen gel selectively regulated proteins located on focal adhesions, particularly in proteins contacting directly with integrin (e.g. FAK and talin) and located in integrin downstream signaling (e.g. PYK2, p130cas, and paxillin), but not in the structural proteins or cytoskeletal associated protein in integrin downstream (e.g. vinculin, Î²-actin) or proteins localized other than focal adhesions (e.g. c-Src and calnexin). To clarify whether collagen gel-induced selective decrease of focal adhesion complex proteins is a general phenomenon, we employed nine different cell lines representing normal epithelial cells (MDCK, LLCPK1, NRK52E), transformed/cancer cells (Change Liver, HeLa, TCCSUP, and U373MG), and fibroblasts (3T3 and 293). These cells were on a dish, collagen gel-coated dish, or collagen gel for 24 h, and their proteins in focal adhesion complex were analyzed by Western blot. We found that collagen gel induced a selective decrease in FAK, talin, PYK2, p130cas, and paxillin in all of the cell lines examined (Fig. 2). These focal adhesion complex proteins remained unchanged when the cells were cultured on dish or collagen gel-coated dish, consistent with our notion that the collagen gel-induced decrease of focal adhesion complex proteins is regulated by the physical property of collagen gel. Matrigel Also Induced Down-regulation of Focal Adhesion Complex ProteinsâTo understand whether the components of a basement membrane might exert similar effects, we employed matrigel. We cultured MDCK cells on a matrigel-coated dish or on matrigel for 4 h and analyzed the changes of focal adhesion complex proteins. MDCK cells cultured on a matrigel-coated dish showed relatively retracted cell shape, and on matrigel they exhibited completely round-up morphology (Fig. 3A). The Western blot results showed that focal adhesion complex proteins were selectively decreased when MDCK cells were cultured on matrigel but remained unaltered when they were cultured on a matrigel-coated dish (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that down-regulation of focal adhesion complex proteins induced by collagen gel and matrigel is controlled by the physical property of gel, i.e. substratum rigidity. In addition, we tested the effects of agarose gel (0.5â4%) on the expression of focal adhesion proteins. In our experience, the rigidity of agarose gel at a concentration as low as 0.5% is still higher than that of collagen gel of any concentration. For experiments of this purpose, agarose gel was coated with 0.3% collagen gel to ensure cell attachment. We found that cells cultured on agarose gel displayed spreading morphology regardless of the concentration of agarose gel (Fig. 3C). Meanwhile, focal adhesion complex proteins remained unchanged in cells cultured on agarose gel of any concentration (Fig. 3D). These data indicate that a threshold might be required for the substratum rigidity-regulated expression of focal adhesion complex proteins. However, the threshold of rigidity that causes down-regulation of focal adhesion complex proteins remains to be defined. Collagen Gel-induced Down-regulation of Focal Adhesion Complex Proteins Is Mediated by Post-transcriptional MechanismâTo delineate whether the collagen gel-induced decrease in focal adhesion complex proteins is mediated by transcriptional regulation, we cultured MDCK cells on a dish, a collagen gel-coated dish, and collagen gel and analyzed the mRNA levels of FAK, talin, and c-Src by RT-PCR. We found that mRNA levels of FAK, talin, and c-Src were not changed by collagen gel (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the collagen gel-induced decrease of focal adhesion complex proteins is regulated through a post-transcriptional mechanism. We then measured protein synthesis rates by assessing the ratio of [35S]methionine incorporation into protein. As shown in Fig. 4B, collagen gel resulted in a significant decrease of total protein synthesis rates within 4 h. To examine whether the collagen gel-induced decrease in focal adhesion complex proteins is mediated by activation of proteases, we pretreated MDCK cells with different protease inhibitors for 1 h, then cultured the cells on collagen gel for 4 h in the presence of protease inhibitors, and analyzed their focal adhesion complex proteins. The results showed that the calpain inhibitors, ALLN and calpeptin, partially prevented the collagen gel-induced decrease in FAK, talin, and p130cas (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these data indicate that the collagen gel-induced lower expression of focal adhesion complex proteins is mediated by the reduction of protein synthesis rates and the activation of proteases. To visualize whether focal adhesion complex proteins were actually diminished by collagen gel, we employed immunofluorescence studies. MDCK cells were cultured on a dish, a collagen gel-coated dish, and collagen gel for 4 h, fixed by paraformaldehyde, and stained with phalloidin-TRITC and anti-FAK antibody. Their stress fibers, cortical actin, and focal adhesions were observed under a confocal microscope. MDCK cells exhibited normal stress fibers and cortical actin as well as a regular pattern of focal adhesions when cultured on dish and collagen gel-coated dish. However, collagen gel resulted in a marked decrease in both focal adhesions and stress fiber (Fig. 5). Collagen Gel-induced Down-regulation Is Mediated by Î±2Î²1Integrin but Not DDR1âCollagen fibrils may exert their effects via two separate receptor systems, integrin and DDR1 (21Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 91: 869-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 24Shrivastava A Radziejewski C. Campbell E. Kovac L. McGlynn M. Ryan T.E. Davis S. Goldfarb M.P. Glass D.J. Lemke G. Yancopoulos G.D. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). To delineate how the physical property of collagen gel transduces signals into cells, we performed stable transfection of DDR1 and its dominant negative mutant in MDCK clone 3B5 cells. We established several stable transfectants that overexpressed the control plasmid, wild type DDR1, or the C-terminal truncated mutant of DDR1. As shown in Fig. 6A, both 3B5 cells and the control transfectant (PC11) exhibited endogenous DDR 1. D-1 and D-9 overexpressed DDR1, whereas N-36 and N-38 overexpressed truncated DDR1 as detected by the anti-Myc antibody. There was a basal level of DDR1 phosphorylation in both PC-11 and D-9 cells even in the absence of collagen. Upon stimulation of soluble type I collagen (200 Î¼g/ml) for 2 h, the PC-11 cell did not show further activation of DDR1 phosphorylation, but D-9 cells exhibited marked activation of DDR1. Both N-36 and N-38 clones exhibited little phosphorylation of DDR1 regardless of the presence of soluble collagen, indicating that the truncated DDR1 can be used as a dominant negative mutant (Fig. 6B). To determine whether the Î±2Î²1 integrin or DDR1 is involved in collagen gel-induced down-regulation of focal adhesion complex proteins, we cultured these DDR1 transfectants on collagen gel with or without the anti-Î±2Î²1 integrin antibody (5E8) (26Chen F.A. Repasky E.A. Bankert R.B. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) for 4 h. As shown in Fig. 6C, D-9 cells showed a more round-up morphology when cultured on a collagen gel-coated dish or a collagen gel than the PC-11 control cells. In contrast, N-38 cells were more flattened when cultured on a collagen gel-coated dish or a collagen gel than PC-12 and D-9 cells. On the other hand, 5E8 markedly reduced the extension of either PC-11 or N-38 cells cultured on a collagen gel. These morphological data suggest that the functions of Î±2Î²1 integrin and DDR1 are opposite, with the former causing cell extension and the later triggering retraction. As shown in Fig. 6D, overexpression of wild type or dominant negative DDR1 did not alter collagen gel-induced down-regulation of FAK, PYK2, and p130cas. However, 5E8 could alleviate a collagen gel-induced decrease in levels of FAK, PYK2, and p130cas in all of these transfectants. These data indicate that collagen gel-induced down-regulation of focal adhesion complex proteins is mediated by Î±2Î²1 integrin, but not DDR1. Integrins play important roles in transducing mechano-signals in various cell types (27Davis M.J. Wu X. Nurkiewicz T.R. Kawasaki J. Davis G.E. Hill M.A. Meininger G.A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 280: H1427-H1433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechano-stress applied through integrin-specific adhesion sites may trigger tyrosine phosphorylation of integrin downstream signaling proteins and result in cytoskeletal stiffening (28Wang N. Butler J.P. Ingber D.E. Science. 1993; 260: 1124-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2439) Google Scholar, 29Choquet D. Felsenfeld D.P. Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 39-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). In addition, Wang et al. (30Wang H.B. Dembo M. Hanks S.K. Wang Y.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11295-11300Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) found that focal adhesion kinase is involved in mechanosensing during fibroblast migration. To understand whether FAK is involved in the collagen gel-induced decrease of focal adhesion complex proteins, we employed 3B5 cells transfected wild type FAK and the endogenous FAK inhibitor, FAK-related non-kinase (FRNK) (31Lai J.F. Kao S.C. Jiang S.T. Tang M.J. Chan P.C. Chen H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7474-7480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These cells were cultured on a dish, a collagen gel-coated dish, and a collagen gel for 4 h, and the focal adhesion proteins were assessed by Western blot. We found that overexpression of either FAK nor FRNK could alter the collagen gel-induced decrease of focal adhesion complex proteins, suggesting that FAK is not involved in this process (Fig. 7). Taken together, these results indicate that the collagen gel-induced decrease expression of focal adhesion complex proteins is mediated by Î±2Î²1 integrin without the involvement of FAK. In this study, we demonstrate that the physical property of the collagen fibrils causes selective down-regulation of focal adhesion complex proteins in all types of the cells examined. Collagen gel-induced down-regulation of focal adhesion complex proteins results in the disappearance of functional focal adhesions and stress fibers, which may contribute to a decrease in intracellular tension. Previous data showed that increased mechanical force to integrin-mediated adhesions increased the cytoskeletal anchorage and stiffness of the cell (28Wang N. Butler J.P. Ingber D.E. Science. 1993; 260: 1124-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2439) Google Scholar, 29Choquet D. Felsenfeld D.P. Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 39-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). We showed, in contrast, that collagen gel resulted in a marked decrease in focal adhesion complex proteins via physical property, i.e. lowered substratum rigidity. It is likely that cells losing expression of focal adhesion complex proteins may exhibit even lower cell strain, which is consistent with the cell response to the reduced mechanical stress of the local environment. We showed that cells cultured on collagen gels did not spread well and displayed reduced stress fibers as well as down-regulation of focal adhesion proteins. It should be of interest to ask whether the observed changes could be due to a lack of spreading rather than the gel per se. In this study, collagen gel induced down-regulation of focal adhesion proteins in all of the cell lines examined. However, collagen gel-induced reduction on cell spreading was not observed in all lines. For example, collagen gel did not block cell spreading in 293 or TCCSUP cells. On the other hand, cells cultured on a matrigel-coated dish and cells overexpressing DDR1 both showed limited cell extension, but their focal adhesion proteins remained intact, and the levels of these proteins were unaltered (Fig. 3, AâD). In Fig. 6, C and D, D-9 cells show reduced spreading on a normal culture dish as well as a collagen gel-coated dish, but they display intact focal adhesion complex proteins. In addition, we also examined whether reduced cell extension by deprivation of cell-matrix interactions affected expression of the focal adhesion complex. The result showed that cells cultured on albumin- or poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)-coated dishes exhibited intact FAK, despite the fact that they could not adhere, and they spread and gradually underwent apoptosis (data not shown). Taken together, collagen gel-induced down-regulation of focal adhesion proteins may not be mediated through the inhibition of cell spreading. We showed that collagen gel-induced down-regulation of focal adhesion proteins was in part mediated by reduction of protein synthesis. These data are consistent with the previous study that demonstrated that collagen gel caused decreased protein synthesis in cultured fibroblasts within 1 day (32Mochitate K. Pawelek P. Grinnell F. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 193: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We also showed that cysteine protease calpain was involved in collagen gel-induced down-regulation of focal adhesion complex proteins. Carragher et al. (33Carragher N.O. Levkau B. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) found that degraded collagen induced proteolysis of FAK, talin, and paxillin by activating a cysteine protease calpain. It is possible that collagen gel may induce activation of matrix metalloprotease (MMP), which cleaves collagen fibrils, and that the degraded collagen thereby triggers activation of calpain. However, this possibility could be ruled out because cells cultured on a collagen gel-coated dish did not display down-regulation of focal adhesion proteins. In addition, a collagen gel-induced decrease in focal adhesion complex proteins occurred within half an hour in culture. It is therefore less likely that collagen gel-induced decrease in focal adhesion complex proteins is caused by degradation of collagen in this case. The biomechanical regulatory mechanism exerted by collagen gel in MDCK cells is mediated by Î±2Î²1 integrin but not DDR1. Previous studies showed the focal adhesion might be a potential mechano-sensor (34Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Cell. 2002; 110: 139-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, shear stress-dependent signals are mediated by Î±vÎ²3 and Î±5Î²1 integrins (27Davis M.J. Wu X. Nurkiewicz T.R. Kawasaki J. Davis G.E. Hill M.A. Meininger G.A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 280: H1427-H1433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, stretching of the substratum promotes the assembly of focal adhesions (30Wang H.B. Dembo M. Hanks S.K. Wang Y.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11295-11300Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 35Aikawa R. Nagai T. Kudoh S. Zou Y. Tanaka M. Tamura M. Akazawa H. Takano H. Nagai R. Komuro I. Hypertension. 2002; 39: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and triggers integrin-dependent signaling (36Schmidt C. Pommerenke H. DuÌrr F. Nebe B. Rychly J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5081-5085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These data indicate that integrins play important roles in mediating biochemical as well as biomechanical stimuli. In this study, we demonstrate that FAK is not the downstream mediator of integrin for rigidity-regulated focal adhesion complex expression. Recent studies suggest that, besides FAK, integrin-linked kinase and caveolin-1 also play roles in integrin downstream signaling (37Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3794) Google Scholar). In addition, mechanosensitive protein kinases have been proposed to reside in the caveolae located in the plasma membrane of the endothelium (38Rizzo V. Sung A. Oh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26323-26329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These possibilities remain to be elucidated. Because focal adhesion complex proteins play very important roles in cell migration and survival as well as proliferation, it is of interest to speculate why the mature kidney does not require the expression of intact focal adhesion complex proteins. Once the nephrogenesis is completed, there is little sign of cell proliferation or migration in kidney. Thus, the requirement of focal adhesion complex proteins in mature kidney is dampened. Besides, although focal adhesion complex proteins can provide anti-apoptosis functions (16Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 39Wei L Yang Y. Zhang X. Yu Q. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 87: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), mature kidney epithelial cells may have other survival machinery. Several lines of evidences showed that collagen fibril is associated with inhibition of cell proliferation. It was found that fibril collagen inhibited cell proliferation by increasing p27 expression as well as inhibition of the expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin E-associated kinase activity (40Koyama H.

In our study, we also observed that cells cultured on collagen gel exhibited markedly lower growth rates than cells on collagen-coated dishes (data not shown). Because FAK is involved in cell cycle progression (43Zhao J.H. Pestell R. Guan J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 4066-4077Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 44Zhao J.H. Zheng C. Guan J.L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3063-3072PubMed Google Scholar), it is therefore likely that collagen gel-induced cell growth inhibition may be mediated by the down-regulation of focal adhesion complex proteins. This study should facilitate our understanding of how substratum rigidity controls cell behaviors through an important biomechanical regulatory mechanism. For example, Pelham and Wang (45Pelham R.J. Wang Y.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13661-13665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar) found that plating the cells on the flexible substrate could not form stable focal adhesions as reflected by the significant lower extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin. From our results, we can speculate that the flexible substrate may down-regulate the expression of focal adhesion proteins and thereby hinder the formation of focal adhesions as well as the phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin. On the other hand, down-regulation of focal adhesion complex proteins may contribute to a reduction of the binding of actin microfilament and thereby cause disruption of stress fibers, which may result in a marked decrease in the intracellular tension. Taken together, our data provide a novel biomechanical signal mechanism that links the substrate rigidity to the regulation of focal adhesions. The role of intracellular tension during this process remains to be examined.

The disorder Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) results from mutations in the NBS1 gene that encodes nibrin, and NBS cells are radiosensitive and defective in S-phase checkpoint activation following irradiation. In response to radiation, nibrin is phosphorylated by Atm, and the Mre11Â·Rad50Â·nibrin complex relocalizes to form punctate nuclear foci. The N terminus of nibrin contains a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain and a breast cancer C-terminal (BRCT) domain, the functions of which are unclear. To determine the role of the FHA and BRCT domains in nibrin function, we have performed site-directed mutagenesis of conserved residues in these motifs. Mutations in the nibrin FHA and BRCT domains did not affect interaction with Mre11Â·Rad50 or nuclear localization of the complex. However, mutation of conserved residues in either domain disrupted nuclear focus formation and blocked nibrin phosphorylation after irradiation, suggesting that these events may be functionally interdependent. Despite an effect on nibrin phosphorylation, expression of the FHA or BRCT mutants in NBS cells restored the downstream phosphorylation of Chk2 and Smc1, necessary for S-phase checkpoint activation.

The phenotype of NBS cells suggests a defect in the detection, signaling, or repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Consistent with this possibility, nibrin is found in a complex with Mre11 and Rad50 in vivo, two proteins with established DNA repair functions (3Carney J.P. Maser R.S. Olivares H. Davis E.M.

Nibrin interacts directly with Mre11 via sequences in the C terminus of nibrin, and this interaction is required for the nuclear localization of the Mre11Â·Rad50Â·nibrin complex (7Desai-Mehta A.

Within the nucleus the Mre11Â·Rad50Â·nibrin complex is distributed unevenly, aggregating in nuclear foci that some reports divide into distinct classes (8Maser R.S. Monsen K.J. Nelms B.E.

Type II and type III foci are induced by agents such as ionizing radiation, which create DNA double-strand breaks, and arise at putative sites of DNA repair (8Maser R.S. Monsen K.J. Nelms B.E.

Despite this knowledge, the function of nibrin is the most poorly understood of the three components of the Mre11-Rad50Â·nibrin complex. NBS1 mutant alleles identified in NBS patients appear to be hypomorphic, likely obscuring essential functions of nibrin that result in embryonic lethality in mice carrying null mutations of the Nbs1 gene (21Maser R.S.

Two potentially functional domains, a forkhead associated (FHA) domain (residues 24â100) and a breast cancer C-terminal (BRCT) domain (residues 114â182) are readily discernable in the primary sequence of human nibrin (5Varon R.

These domains are frequently observed in proteins involved in the DNA damage response, although the juxtaposition of an FHA and a BRCT domain appears unique to nibrin (23Huyton T. Bates P.A. Zhang X.

FHA domains have been shown to mediate phosphoprotein interactions, such as that between Rad53 and phosphorylated Rad9 or the homodimerization of phosphorylated Chk2, whereas BRCT domains mediate direct protein-protein interactions, such as those involving 53BPI and p53 (25Sun Z.

The availability of known ligands for these and other FHA and BRCT domains has facilitated the identification of critical residues for protein interactions mediated by these domains through the use of site-specific mutagenesis and x-ray crystallography. The role of the FHA and BRCT domains in nibrin function has yet to be clearly defined. It is noteworthy that all known mutations in NBS patients truncate nibrin downstream of these motifs, suggesting the FHA and BRCT domains are indispensable for nibrin function (5Varon R. Vissinga C. Platzer M. Cerosaletti K.M. Chrzanowska K.H. Saar K. Beckmann G. Seemanova E. Cooper P.R. Nowak N.J. Stumm M. Weemaes C.M.R. Gatti R.M. Wilson R.K. Digweed M. Rosenthal A. Sperling K. Concannon P.

We have previously demonstrated that a C-terminal 353-amino acid fragment of nibrin, lacking both the FHA and BRCT domains, failed to restore cell survival following irradiation and nuclear focus formation when expressed in NBS cells (7Desai-Mehta A. Cerosaletti K.M. Concannon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2184-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). N-terminal truncation of the nibrin FHA domain was also shown to be sufficient to disrupt nuclear focus formation, although the truncation mutant was characterized by protein instability, resulting in a low level of expression and several protein species of different molecular weights (31Tauchi H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). There is also scant information regarding the proteins that interact with the nibrin FHA and BRCT domains. Maser et al. (32Maser R.S. Mirzoeva O.K. Wells J. Olivares H. Williams B.R. Zinkel R.A. Farnham P.J. Petrini J.H.J. Mol. Cell.

Moreover, yeast two-hybrid analysis is unable to detect phosphoprotein interactions such as those mediated by FHA domains. To address the role of protein interactions mediated by the nibrin FHA or BRCT domains in nibrin function, we have performed site-directed mutagenesis of these domains. Targeted mutations were made at residues in the nibrin FHA and BRCT domains that were deemed critical for interaction with their ligands, based on analogy to other previously studied FHA- or BRCT-containing proteins. These mutated constructs were stably introduced into NBS cells by retroviral transduction, and the effects on the DNA damage response were analyzed. We find that disruption of interactions involving either the FHA or the BRCT domain blocks nuclear focus formation by the Mre11Â·Rad50Â·nibrin complex in irradiated cells. Surprisingly, these nibrin mutants are not phosphorylated in response to ionizing radiation exposure, but their expression restores the downstream nibrin-dependent phosphorylation of Chk2 and Smc1 necessary for the S-phase checkpoint. Cell LinesâAn SV40-transformed fibroblast cell line from an NBS patient, NBS-ILB1, was used as a recipient for all mutant nibrin constructs (33Kraakman-van der Zwet M. Overkamp W.J.I. Friedl A.A.

Retroviral Gene ExpressionâFor retroviral gene expression, a BamHI-NcoI fragment of a mutant NBS1 cDNA was cloned into the HpaI site of the pLXIN retroviral vector (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), upstream of the internal ribosome entry site-neomycin cassette. This fragment extended from â62 of the 5â² untranslated region to position 2286 of the NBS1 cDNA, 21 bp 3â² of the stop codon, and just upstream of the polyadenylation signal. Retroviral infection of mutant NBS1 cDNAs was performed as described previously (Ref. 34Cerosaletti K.M. Desai-Mehta A. Yeo T.C. Kraakman-van der Zwet M. Zdzienicka M.Z. Concannon P. Mutagenesis. 2000; 15: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, see also www.stanford.edu/group/nolan). Briefly, 15 Î¼g of retroviral plasmid DNA was introduced into Phoenix A cells using calcium phosphate transfection, and viral supernatants were harvested after 48 h. Following filtration through a 0.45-Î¼m filter, viral supernatants were incubated with NBS-ILB1 target cells for 24 h. Stable bulk cell lines were selected with 1 mg/ml G418 starting 48 h after infection of NBS-ILB1 cells. Western Blot AnalysisâProtein expression or modification was analyzed by Western blotting. Total cell lysates were prepared by lysing fibroblast cell lines at a final concentration of 104cells/Î¼l in 1.1Ã LDS sample buffer (11% glycerol, 155 mm Tris base, 117 mm Tris HCl, 2.2% LDS, 561 Î¼m EDTA, 242 Î¼m Serva Blue G250, 193 Î¼m phenol red) containing 1 mm sodium vanadate and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). To assess protein phosphorylation following irradiation, cells were exposed to 10 grays (Gy) of ionizing radiation and harvested after 1 h. Alternatively, immunoprecipitates were prepared by lysing 2 Ã 106 cells in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 25 mm gylcerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were precleared with normal rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) and GammaBind Plus-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) for 1 h, and then were immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-nibrin antisera (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) and GammaBind Plus-Sepharose overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer four times, resuspended in 20 Î¼l of 1.1Ã LDS lysis buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Prior to gel electrophoresis, 9 parts of cell lysate or immunoprecipitate were mixed with 1 part of 10Ã NuPAGE sample-reducing agent (Invitrogen) and heated for 10 min at 70 Â°C. Denaturing gel electrophoresis was performed using either 7% or 3â8% gradient NuPAGE Tris acetate gels (Invitrogen). 105 cell equivalents of total cell lysates or 106 cell equivalents of immunoprecipitates were loaded per lane and electrophoresed at 150 V in Tris acetate SDS running buffer (50 mm Tricine, 50 mm Tris base, 0.1% SDS) with NuPAGE antioxidant (Invitrogen). Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Immobilon P nylon membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) in 25 mm Bicine, 25 mm bis-Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 20% methanol with NuPAGE antioxidant. Transfer was accomplished at 30 V for 1 h. Immunoblotting was performed by blocking membranes in 10% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6, with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), followed by incubation with primary and secondary antibodies in 5% nonfat milk in TBST. All washing steps were carried out using TBST. For phosphopeptide-specific antibodies, 1% bovine serum albumin in TBST was used for blocking membranes and for antibody dilutions. Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting include rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for nibrin, Mre11, Rad50, and Chk2 (Novus Biologicals), goat polyclonal anti-Smc1 antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit polyclonal phosphopeptide antibody specific for nibrin Ser-343 (14Gatei M. Young D. Cerosaletti K.M. Desai-Mehta A. Spring K. Kozlov S. Lavin M.F. Gatti R.A. Concannon P. Khanna K.K. Nat.

Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 560-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Chemiluminescence was developed using Western Lightning (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). Immunofluorescence StainingâThe detection of nuclear foci following exposure to ionizing radiation was performed as described previously (34Cerosaletti K.M. Desai-Mehta A. Yeo T.C. Kraakman-van der Zwet M. Zdzienicka M.Z. Concannon P. Mutagenesis. 2000; 15: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, fibroblast cells lines were grown on glass coverslips (Viromed, Minneapolis, MN) and were irradiated with 12 Gy of ionizing radiation. After 8 h, cells were fixed and permeabilized in 4% paraformaldehyde/0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and coverslips were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline with 10% fetal calf serum overnight. Nibrin and Mre11 expression was detected by co-staining with a polyclonal rabbit antibody to human nibrin (Novus Biologicals) and a monoclonal antibody to human Mre11 (provided by Tony Demaggio, ICOS Corp., Bothell, WA). The primary antibodies were detected using an Alexa 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugate and an Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse IgG conjugate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Immunofluorescence was analyzed with a Nikon fluorescence microscope and a Bio-Rad confocal imaging system at 488 and 568 nm (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). To visualize nuclear foci, individual fields were z-planed, 18â20 sections per field, and the sections were stacked to obtain a final image. Mutation of Nibrin FHA and BRCT Domain-conserved ResiduesâTo disrupt the function of the nibrin FHA and BRCT domains, we introduced mutations in amino acid residues that are conserved among FHA and BRCT domains and/or residues that have been demonstrated to be necessary for ligand binding by these domains in other proteins. As shown in Fig. 1A, two conserved amino acids in the nibrin FHA domain, arginine at position 28 and histidine at position 45, were changed to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. In the x-ray crystal structure of the Rad53 FHA1 domain, these conserved amino acids are located in peptide loops that bind phosphorylated Rad9 (24Durocher D. Jackson S.P.

The conserved arginine binds the phosphotyrosine residue and the phosphopeptide backbone directly, whereas the conserved histidine residue stabilizes the architecture of the phosphopeptide binding site (35Durocher D Taylor I.A.

Mutation of these residues to alanine in Rad53 ablated binding of the FHA1 domain to phosphorylated Rad9 (26Durocher D. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Jackson S.P. Mol.

This sequence variant of nibrin was identified among normal individuals and is not associated with any pathologic phenotype (36Cerosaletti K.M. Morrison V.A. Sabath D.E. Willerford D.M. Concannon P.

MNK and WND have six metal binding sites (MBSs) containing a CXXC motif within their N-terminal cytoplasmic region. Evidence suggests that copper is delivered to the ATPases by Atox1, one of three cytoplasmic copper chaperones. Attempts to monitor a direct Atox1-MNK interaction and to determine kinetic parameters have not been successful. Here we investigated interactions of Atox1 with wild-type and mutated pairs of the MBSs of MNK using two different methods: yeast two-hybrid analysis and real-time surface plasmon resonance (SPR). A copper-dependent interaction of Atox1 with the MBSs of MNK was observed by both approaches. Cys to Ser mutations of conserved CXXC motifs affected the binding of Atox1 underlining the essentiality of Cys residues for the copper-induced interaction. Although the yeast two-hybrid assay failed to show an interaction of Atox1 with MBS5/6, SPR analysis clearly demonstrated a copper-dependent binding with all six MBSs highlighting the power and sensitivity of SPR as compared with other, more indirect methods like the yeast two-hybrid system. Binding constants for copper-dependent chaperone-MBS interactions were determined to be 10â5-10â6m for all the MBSs representing relatively low affinity binding events. The interaction of Atox1 with pairs of the MBSs was non-cooperative. Therefore, a functional difference of the MBSs in the MNK N terminus cannot be attributed to cooperativity effects or varying affinities of the copper chaperone Atox1 with the MBSs.

The mechanisms regulating the concentration of essential yet potentially toxic copper ions has been the subject of many investigations in the recent past.

Both copper transporters are thought to fulfil a bifunctional role within the cell: under physiological conditions, the majority of MNK and WND proteins are localized to the trans-Golgi network, where they deliver copper onto secreted cuproenzymes (8Petris M.J. Strausak D. Mercer J.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2845-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, when cytoplasmic copper concentrations reach potentially toxic levels, MNK and WND redistribute from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane and vesicular structures facilitating the efflux of excess copper (9Petris M.J.

They all displayed an overall structure of two Î±-helices and four Î²-strands folding an antiparallel Î²-sheet. In this open-sandwich structure, the two Cys residues of the CXXC motif were exposed on the surface of the protein, readily accessible for the docking of metal ions. The crystallization of Cu-(Atox1)2 as a homodimer bridged by a copper with 3â4 cysteines from the two monomers provided an excellent model for heterodimer complex formation between chaperone and target (21Wernimont A.K.

A trigonal coordination chemistry between copper and Atx1 was proposed (23Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P.J. Fahrni C.J. Culotta V.C. Pennerhahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V.

Complex formation and dissociation of Atx1 with Ccc2 was investigated through 1H and 15N chemical shift perturbation experiments and found to be in the order of milliseconds (25Arnesano I. Banci L.

A lysine-rich region resulting in a positively charged face of Atx1 was crucial for intracellular copper trafficking, suggesting an important interaction site between Atx1 and Ccc2 (24Portnoy M.E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 15041-15045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).The functional significance of the six MBSs in WND and MNK is unclear, but there is growing evidence that there is a functional distinction between the sites. The prokaryotic and lower eukaryotic orthologues have only 1â3 MBSs, suggesting that all six are not required for copper transport. Work from our laboratory has demonstrated that only one of MBS5 or MBS6 of MNK was necessary and sufficient for the protein to traffic to the plasma membrane in response to copper (26Strausak D. La Fontaine S. Hill J. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Mercer J.F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11170-11177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This result showed that MBS5 and MBS6 have some specific function in the copper-induced trafficking process and suggested that the first four metal binding sites may have a separate function. The effect of mutating various combinations of MBSs on the ability of MNK and WND to deliver copper to the ceruloplasmin orthologue, Fet3p, in yeast has been assessed by two groups with markedly different results for the two proteins (27Payne A.S. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3765-3770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Payne et al. (27Payne A.S. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3765-3770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) found that progressive mutations of the MBSs from CXXC to SXXS from the N-terminal end caused a complete loss of copper delivery to Fet3p after only the first two MBSs had been mutated. A zipper-like mechanism for copper binding to MBS1â4 would explain why Forbes et al. (28Forbes J.R. Hsi G. Cox D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) found that only MBS6 of WND was necessary for complete restoration of Fet3p activity. It also was proposed that these results may indicate that the various MBSs perform distinct functions in MNK as compared with WND.Using both yeast and mammalian cell assays, a copper-dependent interaction of Atox1 with the MBSs in the WND N terminus has been demonstrated (29Larin D. Mekios C. Das K. Ross B. Yang A.S. Gilliam T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28497-28504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Two cysteines in the CXXC motif of Atox1 were necessary for an interaction with WND and a single MBS of WND was sufficient to promote this interaction. Interestingly, MBS5 and MBS6 of WND failed to interact with Atox1. In the same report, an interaction of the complete MNK N terminus with Atox1 was demonstrated, although a functional difference between individual MBSs of MNK had not been investigated.Yeast two-hybrid analysis is based on an interaction-dependent reconstitution of a transcription factor in the yeast nucleus and hence is an indirect method to measure protein-protein interactions. Yeast two-hybrid screens are subject to artifacts and may miss many interactions or produce false positive results. Therefore, a recently established real-time metallochaperone-target interaction method (30Multhaup G. Strausak D. Bissig K.D. Solioz M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was applied here, and the data were compared with yeast two-hybrid analysis. As demonstrated for the MNK homologue WND (29Larin D. Mekios C. Das K. Ross B. Yang A.S. Gilliam T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28497-28504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we found a copper-dependent interaction of Atox1 with the first four MBSs of MNK but not with MBS5 and MBS6, suggesting a preferential binding of the chaperone with the N-terminal MBSs. However, using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), we detected a copper-dependent transient interaction of the chaperone with all six MBSs. We quantitatively assessed association and dissociation rates and calculated binding constants of 1â19 Ã 10â6m for all pairs of MBSs with Atox1. Mutations in the MBSs did not significantly affect the overall binding affinity, suggesting that the binding of multiple chaperones to the N terminus of MNK is of a non-cooperative nature.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Vectors Used for Yeast Two-hybrid AnalysisâThe yeast two-hybrid plasmid pGAD GH was obtained from Clontech, and the construction of pLexA/pBTM116 has been described (31Vojtek A.B.

A 1.8-kb MNK fragment encoding the full-length MNK N terminus was amplified from pCMB99 (26Strausak D. La Fontaine S. Hill J. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Mercer J.F.B. J. Biol.

To generate the LexA-MBS1/2 fusion protein, a 0.9-kb BamHI/NsiI fragment was excised from the plasmid pCMB151 and cloned into the BamHI/PstI sites of pLexA, resulting in pCMB226. The regions encoding MBS3/4, MBS3/4m3, and MBS3/4m34 were amplified by PCR from pCMB151, pCMB99m1â3, and pCMB99m1â6, respectively (26Strausak D. La Fontaine S. Hill J. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11170-11177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), isolated as a BamHI/PstI fragment, and subcloned into the BamHI/PstI sites of pLexA, generating the construct pCMB225. All the amplified sequences were verified by manual or automated sequence analysis using the Thermo Sequenase cycle sequencing kit or the dideoxy chain termination kit (both from Amersham Biosciences) and the protocol provided by the manufacturer.Yeast Strain, Transformations, and Two-hybrid AssayâThe yeast reporter strain L40 (MATÎ± his3Î200 trp1â901 leu2â3112 ade2 LYS2::(lexA-HIS3) (URA3::lexA-lacZ) GAL4) (31Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar) was co-transformed with the indicated control plasmids pGAD EEA1wt and pLex EEAwt (33Callaghan J. Simonsen A. Gaullier J.-M. Toh B.-H. Stenmark H. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) or pCMB152 (encoding Atox1-Gal4) and various pCMB plasmids using a lithium acetate-based method (34Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). The co-transformants were selected on complete synthetic medium lacking tryptophan and leucine (Bio 101, La Jolla, CA). The yeast two-hybrid experiments were essentially performed as described in the manual provided by the supplier of the two-hybrid system (Clontech).Western BlotsâProtein extracts from transformed yeast L40 cells were prepared by the trichloroacetic acid method as described in the yeast protocols handbook provided by Clontech. 30 Î¼g of total protein extract were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell). Atox1-Gal4 (see Fig. 2A) and MBS-LexA (see Fig. 2B) were detected using monoclonal anti-Gal4 and anti-LexA antibodies, respectively (both purchased from Clontech), followed by a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG antibody (Amrad Biotech). The detection of peroxidase activity was carried out using the chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). All the protocols were performed essentially as described previously (35La Fontaine S. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Paynter J.A. Mercer J.F.B. Plasmid. 1998; 39: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).Atox1 Peptide SynthesisâFor solid phase synthesis of the 69 amino acids containing Atox1, we employed the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) strategy (36Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; : 2149-2154Crossref Scopus (6612) Google Scholar, 37Carpino L.A. Han G.Y. J. Org. Chem. 1972; : 3404-3409Crossref Scopus (1090) Google Scholar) in a fully automated synthesizer (Applied Biosystems 433). Peptide chain assembly was performed using in situ activation of amino acid building blocks by 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate. The purified material was analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography and laser desorption mass spectrometry (Vision 2000, Finnigan MAT). Purified peptides were dissolved in double distilled water at a concentration of 700 Î¼m and stored at â70 Â°C until use.Construction of Vectors for Overexpression of MBSsâpGEX-4T-2 was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. A 0.7-kb fragment encoding MBS1/2 was amplified from pCMB226 using the primers: MBS1/2fw, 5â²-TATAAGGATCCGGTGTGAATTCTGTTACC-3â²; and MBS1/2rev, 5â²-AATTATGTCGACTTACTTTTTGACAAATGC-3â². A 0.53-kb fragment encoding MBS3/4, MBS3/4-m3, or MBS3/4-m34 was amplified from pCMB222 using the primers: MBS3/4fw, 5â²-TATAAGGATCCAATGATTCAACAGCCAC-3â²; and MBS3/4rev, 5â²-AATTATGTCGACTTAGTCTGACAAGGTAGCATC-3â². A 0.46-kb fragment encoding MBS5/6 was amplified from pCMB225 using the primers: MBS5/6fw, 5â²-TATAAGGATCCGGTGTGAATTCATCTAAG-3â²; and MBS5/6rev, 5â²-AATATGTCGACTTACTTCTTGACCAAAGAAGCTTC-3â². All the amplified fragments were digested with SalI/BamHI and cloned into pGEX-4T-2 yielding in plasmids pGST-MBS1/2, pGST-MBS3/4, pGST-MBS3/4m3, pGST-MBS3/4m34, and pGST-MBS5/6. All the amplified sequences were verified by automated sequence analysis using the dideoxy chain termination kit (Amersham Biosciences) and the protocol provided by the manufacturer.Expression and Purification of MBS FragmentsâThe plasmids were transformed and expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(pREP4). Cells were grown at 37 Â°C in LB medium with 50 Î¼g/ml ampicillin, harvested 2 h after induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl-Î²-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and lysed in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 10 Î¼g/ml lysozyme, and 2 mm dithiothreitol by sonicating the cells 20 times with an ultrasonic tip set to 50% power. After the addition of 1% Triton X-100, the lysate was centrifuged at 35,000 Ã g for 30 min, and the proteins were batch-purified using 50% GSH-Sepharose slurry (Amersham Biosciences) in phosphate-buffered saline + 5 mm dithiothreitol as described by the manufacturer. The purified MBSs were released from both GST and GSH-Sepharose in a single reaction step by 10 NIH units/ml of thrombin (Sigma) and subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (38Morrisey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad).Surface Plasmon ResonanceâSurface plasmon resonance experiments were performed using a Biacore Upgrade biosensor system (Biacore Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). Purified mutant or wt MBS3/4, MBS5/6, GST-MBS1/2, or GST were diluted to 50 Î¼g/ml in 10 mm NaOAc, pH 4.6, and covalently coupled to the sensor surface by the standard N-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-Nâ²-(dimethyl-aminopropyl-)carbodiimide activation chemistry according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fusion proteins were injected until 800â3000 response units (RU) of wt and mutated MBS3/4, MBS5/6, GST-MBS1/2, and GST were coupled. These values corresponded to 0.8â4.8 ng/mm2 immobilized protein on the chip surface. Remaining free N-hydroxysuccinimide groups were saturated by a 6-min 1 m ethanolamine injection. The interaction analysis was performed at 37 Â°C in a flow buffer containing 2 mm ascorbate and 50 mm NaPi, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 5 Î¼l/min. The sequence of the Atox1-MBS interaction experiments was as depicted in Fig. 4: metal ions were first removed from the system by a 2-min wash with 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS) in 50 mm NaPi, pH 7.4. The immobilized proteins on the chip were then reduced by 20 mm Tris-(2-carboxy-ethyl) phosphine (TCEP) in 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 3.0 for 4 min (39Gray W.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1732-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). When required, the chip was preloaded with copper using 0.01 mm CuCl2 in flow buffer. Subsequently, Atox1 was injected for 7 min. As described under âResults,â the interaction event was monitored in real-time (see Fig. 4, inset), and the sensor chip was finally regenerated with 2 m NaCl. This washing step reset the RUs to the initial, baseline values.Fig. 4Overview of the washing and injection steps used in a representative SPR experiment.Buffer, flow buffer as described under âExperimental Proceduresâ; E/B, wash step with 1 mm EDTA/0.1 mm BCS; TCEP, incubation period with 20 mm reducing agent TCEP; Cu, copper loading of MBSs on the chip surface; Atox1, injection period of the copper chaperone; NaCl, regeneration of the biosensor surface with 2 m NaCl.

The primary data were analyzed using the BIAevaluation 3.1 Software (Biacore Inc.), applying a Langmuir binding model (stoichiometry of 1:1) to calculate kon (association rate constant mâ1 sâ1), koff (dissociation rate constant, mâ1 sâ1), and KD (equilibrium constant) for the interaction of Atox1 with mutated or wt MBS fragments. For each concentration, kon and koff were obtained simultaneously from the equation KD = koff/kon. The goodness of the fit between the fitted curve and the experimental data was expressed as Ï2 according to the manufacturer's protocol. For good fitting to ideal data, Ï2 is of the same order of magnitude as the noise in RU, typically <10.RESULTSOur initial experiments investigated the interaction of Atox1 with fragments of MNK by yeast two-hybrid analysis. The assay was performed with LexA fusions containing various combinations of only two MBSs. As can be seen in Fig. 1 (bars 1), Atox1 interacted strongly with MBS1/2 in a copper-dependent manner as 2 mm of the copper(I) chelator BCS in the growth media almost abolished the interaction (1, white bar). In this experiment, the presence of BCS did reduce the activity of Î²-galactosidase by â¼40% in the positive control (+), the dimerization of an early endosomal autoantigen (EEA1) (33Callaghan J. Simonsen A. Gaullier J.-M. Toh B.-H. Stenmark H. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, in several other experiments, the inhibition of the control by BCS was less than 10% (data not shown). Regardless, it is clear that BCS had a much more marked effect on the Atox1-MBS interaction, proving the copper dependence of this process. The interaction of Atox1 with the MNK region comprising MBS3/4 was â¼40% of the interaction with MBS1/2 (Fig. 1, compare 2 with 1), and this was further reduced when MBS3 was mutated from CXXC to SXXS (Fig. 1, 3) and completely abolished when both MBSs in MBS3/4 were mutated (data not shown). MBS3/4 and MBS3/4m3 are expressed at lower levels than MBS1/2 (Fig. 2B) with nearly constant expression levels of the Gal4-Atox1 hybrid (Fig. 2A), which may partially explain the reduced interaction. Unlike MBS1/2 and MBS3/4, there was no evidence of an interaction between Atox1 and MBS5/6 (Fig. 1, bar 4). Low expression levels could not account for the difference because LexA-MBS5/6 was expressed significantly higher than the hybrids with MBS1/2 (Fig. 2B) with nearly constant expression levels of the Gal4-Atox1 hybrid (Fig. 2A). Addition of 200 Î¼m copper to the medium reduced the interaction 1â3-fold of all the investigated samples, indicating an inhibiting effect of high copper concentrations, consistent with the negative copper effect observed with Atx1 and the MBSs of Ccc2 (23Pufahl R.A.

Deletion analysis of the 5â²-flanking sequences of the gene demonstrated that the proximal â150-bp sequence of the CD68 promoter exhibits high level promoter activity in macrophages. Mutations that abolish Ets factor binding at positions â106 and â89 reduce promoter activity in macrophages to 12 and 30%, respectively.

Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirm that Elf-1 and PU.1 associate with the CD68 proximal promoter in vivo in THP-1 cells. PU.1 does not bind to the CD68 promoter alone but instead forms heterocomplexes with members of the interferon regulatory factor family (IRF) including IRF-4 and IRF-8. IRF-4 and IRF-8 typically mediate transcriptional activation when associated with PU.1 on composite elements.

Monoclonal antibodies of the CD68 cluster show strong staining of all monocytes and macrophages in normal human tissues and CD68 is widely regarded as a pan macrophage marker in immunohistochemistry studies (1Parwaresch M.R. Radzun H.J. Kreipe H. Hansmann M.L. Barth J. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 125: 141-151PubMed Google Scholar, 2Pulford K.A. Sipos A. Cordell J.L. Stross W.P. Mason D.Y. Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The protein recognized by CD68 antibodies is a member of the lysosome-associated membrane protein family (3Holness C.L. Simmons D.L. Blood. 1993; 81: 1607-1613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human CD68 shows 72% identity with the murine macrosialin protein and displays the same overall organization with an N-terminal 117-amino acid mucin domain separated from a 165-amino acid lysosome-associated membrane protein domain by a 13-amino acid proline-rich spacer region (4Holness C.L. da Silva R.P.

Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). CD68 is one of 9 genes in a 140-kb region of the human chromosome 17p13 (10Jones E. Quinn C.M. See C.G. Montgomery D.S. Ford M.J. Kolble K. Gordon S. Greaves D.R. Genomics. 1998; 53: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It lies 669 bp 3â² to the human eukaryotic initiation factor 4AI gene and 5â² to a MPDU1 gene, which encodes a repressor of the Lec 15 and Lec 35 glycosylation mutants of Chinese hamster ovary cells. All of the genes clustered around CD68 have very different expression profiles, being expressed in different tissues with very different developmental specificities. Its close proximity, however, to a housekeeping gene, EIF-4A1, suggests that the CD68 gene is likely to be in a permanently open chromatin configuration (11Quinn C.M. Wiles A.P. El-Shanawany T. Catchpole I. Alnadaf T. Ford M.J. Gordon S. Greaves D.R. Genomics. 1999; 62: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We have shown that the first intron of the EIF-4A1 gene contains a methylation free island, which can act as a potent enhancer in a wide range of cell types (12Greaves D.R. Quinn C.M. Seldin M.F. Gordon S. Genomics. 1998; 54: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, the CD68 gene may not need a specific chromatin opening region but rather only genetic elements, which act to restrict expression to macrophages. The need to identify such genetic regulatory elements to target transgene expression to macrophages led us to clone and characterize the CD68 promoter. Our studies show that sequences between â150 and +2 of the human CD68 gene give maximal promoter activity in transiently transfected macrophage cell lines and that multiple Ets factors bind this promoter in vitro and in vivo. An important element of the promoter is a composite PU.1/IRF site that binds PU.1 and interferon regulatory factor members IRF-4 1The abbreviations used are: IRF, interferon regulator factor; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; MEF, myeloid Elf-1-like factor; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; IL, interleukin; UTR, untranslated region; TLR, Toll-like receptor.1The abbreviations used are: IRF, interferon regulator factor; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; MEF, myeloid Elf-1-like factor; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; IL, interleukin; UTR, untranslated region; TLR, Toll-like receptor. and IRF-8. Although both factors are able to repress CD68 promoter activity in a DNA-dependent manner in vitro in THP-1 cells, only IRF-4 is associated with the promoter in vivo in B lymphocytes. We propose that CD68 expression is regulated in different cell types by specific activators and repressors of transcription including Ets family members and IRF-4. Total RNA was prepared from human peripheral blood-derived macrophages by guanidium/phenol extraction (RNAzol-B, Biogenesis). Rapid amplification of cDNA 5â² ends (5â² RACE) was performed using a 5â² RACE system (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription of 1 Î¼g of human macrophage total RNA was performed using the primer CD68GSP1 (GCTATTGCTTGTTGGATG). Tailed first strand cDNA was used as a template for PCR with a 5â² anchor primer (5â²-CUACUACUACUAGGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGIIGGGIIGGGIIG) and the CD68GSP2 primer (5â²-GTTCCAGTGCTCTCTGTAACC). Gel purified PCR products were cloned via overhanging 3â² Ala residues and sequenced with fluorescently labeled dideoxy terminators and TaqFS DNA polymerase (ABI Prism FS). A 2940-bp BstXI fragment was purified from cosmid CD68C1 (10Jones E. Quinn C.M. See C.G. Montgomery D.S. Ford M.J. Kolble K. Gordon S. Greaves D.R. Genomics. 1998; 53: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The BstXI fragment was rendered blunt ended by incubation with T4 DNA polymerase and cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript SKâ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to give plasmid pCD68Bst3-2. The 3â² BstXI site contains the CD68 ATG initiation codon, which was removed by the 3â²-exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase. A HindIII-XbaI fragment containing 2940 bp of DNA upstream of the CD68 ATG codon was cloned into the reporter vector pCAT Basic (Promega) to give the plasmid â2940CD68pCAT. Plasmid â2940CD68pCAT was digested with SstI to give the plasmid â951CD68pCAT. All other CD68 promoter deletions in pCAT Basic were prepared by PCR using plasmid â2940CD68pCAT as a template and 5â²-oligonucleotide primers that added a HindIII site and a common 3â² PCR primer that spanned the XbaI cloning site of plasmid â2940CD68pCAT. The â150 to +2 CD68 promoter fragment was PCR amplified and cloned between the KpnI and XhoI sites of the luciferase reporter vector pGL3 Basic (Promega) to give the plasmid â150CD68luc. A 5â² deletion series of the CD68 promoter in pGL3 Basic was made using PCR and primers that added a 5â² MluI site. Linker scanning mutations were made by cloning PCR products extending from â150 to the 5â² deletion end point between KpnI and MluI sites of 5â² deletion clones. Double point mutations in the Ets binding site and the PU.1/IRF composite site were generated using the Transformerâ¢ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech) and the â150CD68luc construct as template. Two oligonucleotides were generated to mutate the PU.1/IRF composite element. The â89mIRF oligo contains a mutation within the IRF binding site and the â89mPU.1 contains a mutation at the PU.1 binding site: â89mIRF, 5â²-GGAAGTGAGTGATTCATTTCCTCC-3â², â89mPU.1, 5â²-GACTTTCATTTGGTCCTTTCCAAG-3â². The Ets consensus sequences at â106 and â78 were mutated using the following primers: â106mEts, 5â²-CTCCAGTACACCAAGTGAGAC-3â² and â78mEts, 5â²-CCTCCTTTGGAAGAGAGG-3â² (mutated nucleotides are underlined). All promoter constructs were verified by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. Supercoiled plasmid DNAs were prepared from Escherichia coli by NaOH/SDS lysis and purified by equilibrium centrifugation in CsCl/ethidium bromide gradients followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation (13Sambrook J.

COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, antibiotics and glutamine, and HEK293, HepG2, and NIH 3T3 cells were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% non-essential amino acids, antibiotics, and glutamine.

Aliquots of 2 Ã 107 cells (0.5 ml) were mixed with 20 Î¼g of pCAT or 10 Î¼g of luciferase reporter plasmid DNA and 2 Î¼g of pcDNA3 Î²-galactosidase plasmid DNA, added to a 0.4-cm electrode gap electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad) and shocked in a Bio-Rad GenePulser (280 V, 1090 microfarads) at room temperature.

After 16â24 h incubation the cells were washed twice in PBS and harvested into 1Ã luciferase buffer (Promega). HepG2, NIH 3T3, HEK293, and COS-7 cells were grown to 70â80% confluence in 6-well Costar dishes, washed twice with Opti-MEM I before addition of 2.5 ml of plasmid DNA-cationic lipid complex (2 Î¼g of DNA, 25 Î¼g of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM I). After 6â16 h incubation the medium was aspirated, cells were washed twice with PBS, and recovered into complete medium for 24â36 h before analysis. HepG2, NIH 3T3, COS-7, and HEK293 cell transient transfection efficiencies were in excess of 40% as judged by co-transfection with a green fluorescent protein reporter plasmid. Transient transfection in these cells were also performed using GeneJuice reagent following the manufacturer's instructions for adherent cells. Reporter Gene AssaysâTransfected cells were washed once with PBS and harvested by scraping into PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended in 100 Î¼l of 0.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) and subjected to three rounds of freeze-thaw lysis. Cell lysates were assayed for Î²-galactosidase enzyme activity using the colorimetric substrate chlorophenol red-Î²-d-galactopyranoside (Roche Diagnostics) in a 96-well plate assay in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) with 2 mm MgCl2. Enzyme activity was determined by spectrophotometry at 570 nm. CAT enzyme activity of heat-treated cell lysates (65 Â°C, 20 min) was determined using 0.25 Î¼Ci of 14C-labeled chloramphenicol (54 Ci mmolâ1, Amersham Biosciences) as substrate in a 125-Î¼l reaction in 0.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.2 mg mlâ1n-butyryl-CoA as cofactor. CAT enzyme activity was measured by determining the amount of butyryl-[14C]chloramphenicol extracted into mixed xylenes (Sigma) after a 2-h incubation at 37 Â°C (14Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). A CAT enzyme standard curve was generated using dilutions of purified CAT enzyme (Promega) in each experiment and all CAT enzyme assays were within the linear range of the enzyme assay. Transfected cell lysates were prepared in reporter lysis buffer and luciferase enzyme activities were determined using a Firefly luciferase assay kit (Promega). Annealed oligonucleotide probes (0.5 pmol) labeled with 32P were incubated with 5â15 Î¼g of nuclear extract in Buffer C (40 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 12.5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg mlâ1 bovine serum albumin, 50 Î¼g mlâ1 poly(dI-dC), 50 Î¼g mlâ1 salmon sperm DNA) for 30 min at room temperature. The sequence of the oligonucleotides corresponding to the transcription factor binding sites were: Ets binding site, â106CD68, 5â²-AAGCTCCAGTACAGGAAGTGAGACTT-3â²; PU.1/IRF composite element; â89CD68, 5â²-GACTTTCATTTCCTCCTTTCCAAGAGAGG-3â²; mutated IRF binding site: â89mutIRF, 5â²-GTGATTCATTTCCTCCTTTCCAAGAGAGG-3â²; mutated PU.1 binding site, â89mutPU.1, 5â²-GACTTTCATTTGGTCCTTTCCAAGAGAGG; mutated Ets binding site at position â78, â78mutCD68, 5â²-GACTTTCATTTCCTCCTTTCCAAGAGAGG-3â² (mutated nucleotides are underlined). For supershift assays, EMSA reactions were incubated for an additional 2 min with 400 ng of specific or control antisera. Complexes were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Probes) and ImageQuant software. Western blotting with specific antisera was performed on proteins transferred to Hybond C membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using standard methods and bound antibody detected by incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Primary antibodies to IRF-4 and IRF-8 were purchased from Santa Cruz. Nuclear extracts were prepared from 107 THP-1, HL60, U937, A20, Raji, and Thiel cells by resuspension in low salt buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2,10 mm KCl, 1 Î¼g mlâ1 pepstatin, 1 Î¼g mlâ1 aprotinin, 1 Î¼g mlâ1 trypsin inhibitor, and 1 Î¼m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min on ice. Nuclei were pelleted at 5,000 rpm for 30 s at 4 Â°C and resuspended in high salt buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 Î¼g mlâ1 pepstatin, 1 Î¼g mlâ1 aprotinin, 1 Î¼g mlâ1 trypsin inhibitor, and 1 Î¼m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 Â°C and supernatants were equalized for total protein using a BCA protein assay kit (Perbio) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Spleen extracts were prepared from C57BL/6J mice according to the procedure of Taylor et al. (15Taylor P.R. Brown G.D. Reid D.M. Willment J.A. Martinez-Pomares L. Gordon S. Wong S.Y. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 3876-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Briefly, splenocytes were harvested by standard methods using a combination of digestion with Liberase Blendzyme II in RPMI (Roche Diagnostics) and mechanical dissociation. Enzymatic activity was quenched with RPMI, 20% FCS, erythrocytes were lysed with Gey's solution, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation through 100% FCS at 1000 rpm. Lymphocytes were isolated using Ficoll-Plaque (Amersham Biosciences) density gradients. Briefly, buffy coats were diluted 1 in 3 in PBS and layered onto Ficoll-Plaque, at a ratio of blood:Ficoll of 2.5:1. Samples were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 20 min, the lymphocytic layer was removed and washed 3 times in PBS. Monocytes were isolated by exploiting their adherent properties and culturing the lymphocytes at 37 Â°C, 5% CO2 in X VIVO 10 media (BioWhittaker) for 90 min. The B cells were positively selected from the non-adherent cells by the addition of magnetic CD19-coupled dynabeads (Dynal) at a ratio of cells: beads of 10:1 for 20 min at 4 Â°C with gentle rotation and tilting. The CD19 positive B cells were removed using a magnet, washed 4â6 times in PBS, 0.3% bovine serum albumin, and detached from the beads using DETACHaBEAD (Dynal) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Monoctyes and B cells were cultured in X VIVO 10 media overnight and nuclear extracts were prepared as described above. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed according to the method of Weinmann et al. (16Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Briefly, for each immunoprecipitation 1 Ã 107 THP-1, Raji, U937, and Thiel cells were cross-linked with a final concentration of 1% formaldehyde (BDH), added directly to the media for 10 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was stopped by the addition of 0.125 m glycine for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and swelled in Buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 Î¼g mlâ1 pepstatin, 1 Î¼g mlâ1 aprotinin, 1 Î¼g mlâ1 trypsin inhibitor, and 1 Î¼m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 20 min on ice. Nuclei were pelleted at low speed and lysed in Buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10 mm EDTA, 1 Î¼g mlâ1 pepstatin, 1 Î¼g mlâ1 aprotinin, 1 Î¼g mlâ1 trypsin inhibitor, and 1 Î¼m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 10 min. Chromosomal DNA was sheared to â¼600 bp by sonicating the samples on ice for 8 Ã 10-s pulses. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 Â°C and supernatants were pre-cleared with Staphylococcus aureus cells (Sigma) for 15 min at 4 Â°C. S. aureus cells were pre-blocked with 1 mg mlâ1 herring sperm DNA and 1 mg mlâ1 bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 Â°C. Supernatants were diluted 1:5 with buffer C (0.01% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 167 mm NaCl, 1 Î¼g mlâ1 pepstatin, 1 Î¼g mlâ1 aprotinin, 1 Î¼g mlâ1 trypsin inhibitor, and 1 Î¼m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 1 Î¼g of anti-Elf-1, -Fli-1, -PU.1, -IRF-4 (Santa Cruz), anti-MEF, a gift from Dr. S. Nimer, or rabbit IgG antisera were added to the chromatin lysates and left overnight rotating at 4 Â°C. In addition, 1 Î¼g of a rabbit anti-goat secondary antibody was added to the goat immunoprecipitations the following day for 1 h at 4 Â°C. No primary antibody and buffer only controls were also set up to check for buffer contamination and nonspecific binding. Immunoprecipitations were washed twice in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA buffer, 4 times in wash buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate), and immune complexes were eluted as previously described (17Boyd K.E. Wells J. Gutman J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13887-13892Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). RNA was removed by the addition of 10 Î¼g of RNase and cross-links were reversed at 65 Â°C for 5 h. Protein-DNA complexes were precipitated overnight at 4 Â°C. Pellets were resuspended into 1Ã proteinase A buffer plus 0.2 mg mlâ1 proteinase A (Roche Diagnostics) and incubated at 45 Â°C for 2 h. Samples were extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated overnight at 4 Â°C with rotating. Pellets were resuspended in 30 Î¼l of TE (pH 8.0) and 3 Î¼l were analyzed by PCR. Total input chromatin from 1 Ã 107 cells was resuspended in 30 Î¼l of TE (pH 8.0) and used at 1 in 300 dilution. Each reaction mixture contained 3 Î¼l of immunoprecipitated chromatin. 1Ã HotStar Taq reaction buffer (Qiagen), 50 pmol of each primer, 1.2 units of HotStar Taq, and 100 Î¼m each of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (Sigma) in a final reaction volume of 25 Î¼l. PCR samples were amplified for 1 cycle at 95 Â°C for 15 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95 Â°C for 30 s, 57 Â°C for 30 s, and 72 Â°C for 30 s and a final extension at 72 Â°C for 8 min. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis through a 1% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The sequences of the primers used were as follows: CD68 proximal promoter forward primer, 5â²-CAACTGCCCTAGGACTCCGTTTG-3â² and reverse 5â²-TCAGCCTCCTTCCTCCTTACCT-3â² (318 bp); CD68 3â²-UTR forward, 5â²-GTACCCTTATTTCCTCGACACG-3â² and reverse, 5â²-CCTCCCAAGTAGCTGGGATTAC-3â² (242 bp); human TLR-4 forward, 5â²-CCGTCATCCTAGAGAGTTAC-3â² and reverse, 5â²-GAGGCACTGGTGTCTTCTC-3â² (320 bp); hIL-1Î² forward, 5â²-CACCATCTACATCATCATCAC-3â² and reverse, 5â²-CTAGTATCCAGGTTGCATGAG-3â² (338 bp); CD20 forward, 5â²-GTCAGTGCTAACAGCCCATC-3â² and reverse, 5â²-GTGAGTGGTGTAGTCCAG-3â² (320 bp); 12/15LO forward, 5â²-CTGCATTCCAGGGTGACAGAG-3â² and reverse, 5â²-CCTGCTGTTCTCTCAAAGAAC-3â² (306 bp). Transcription of the CD68 Gene Is Initiated at Multiple Start SitesâIn common with many other macrophage-expressed genes the CD68 promoter contains neither a recognizable TATA box sequence, Sp1 binding sites, nor obvious initiator sequences. The transcription initiation start sites of the human CD68 gene were determined by primer extension and 5â² RACE analysis of human macrophage mRNA. A cluster of 5â² primer extension products was observed and heterogeneity in the site of CD68 transcript initiation was confirmed by sequence analysis of 13 independent CD68 5â² RACE clones. The positions of CD68 transcription start sites are indicated by dots above the CD68 gene sequence (Fig. 1). CD68 transcripts in human macrophages initiate over a region of about 50 bp immediately upstream of the ATG translation initiation codon of the CD68 gene. A similar pattern of clustered transcription sites has been reported in the macrosialin gene, which encodes the murine homologue of CD68 (18Li A.C. Guidez F.R. Collier J.G. Glass C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5389-5399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Jiang Z. Shih D.M. Xia Y.R. Lusis A.J. de Beer F.C. de Villiers W.J. van der Westhuyzen D.R. de Beer M.C. Genomics. 1998; 50: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because of the heterogeneity in CD68 transcription start sites we designated the A of the ATG translation initiation position +1 of the CD68 promoter. Analysis of the CD68 Promoter in Macrophage and Non-macrophage Cell LinesâTo assess the usefulness of the CD68 promoter for targeting gene expression to cells of the mononuclear phagocytic lineage we optimized transient transfection methods for the murine macrophage cell lines P388.D1 and RAW264.7. A BstXI fragment containing 2940 bp of sequence immediately 5â² of the CD68 ATG translation initiation codon was cloned into the CAT reporter vector pCAT Basic to give the plasmid â2940CD68pCAT. This plasmid was shown to direct high levels of reporter gene expression in transiently transfected P388.D1 macrophages (Fig. 2B). To determine the location of important sequence elements present in the â2940-bp CD68 5â²-flanking region, which contains 2.3 kb of the 3â² end of the EIF-4A1 gene, a series of 5â² deletions of the CD68 5â²-flanking sequence were generated in the reporter vector pCAT Basic. The highest level of expression in transiently transfected P388.D1 cells was obtained with a reporter plasmid containing 143 bp of sequence 5â² of the CD68 initiation codon (Fig. 2B). The level of expression obtained with this fragment of the CD68 promoter is twice that obtained with the SV40 enhancer/promoter (pCAT Control) cloned in the same reporter gene vector (pCAT Basic). Deletion of sequences between â143 and â119 led to a slight decrease in CD68 promoter activity, whereas deletion of sequences between â119 and â96 virtually abolish promoter activity. In transient transfection assays using the â150 CD68 construct significant levels of CD68 promoter activity were seen in the non-macrophage cell lines tested (Fig. 2C). Promoter activity was reduced by 70â82% in 293 and NIH 3T3 cells, respectively, and as much as 95% in HepG2 cells as compared with values obtained with macrophage cells. From these experiments we conclude that sequences between â143 and +2 give maximal expression in macrophages. The Proximal Promoter of the CD68 Gene Contains Several Purine-rich MotifsâCloser analysis of the proximal promoter region revealed a number of purine-rich motifs on either strand at positions â106, â89, and â78 with the consensus core 5â²-GGAA-3â² sequence (Fig. 2A). This sequence motif is recognized by transcription factors of the Ets family including PU.1, a factor known to be required for optimal expression of a number of myeloid-specific genes (20Zhang D.E. Hetherington C.J. Chen H.M. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21Hohaus S. Petrovick M.S. Voso M.T. Sun Z. Zhang D.E. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell.

Pfisterer P. Wirth T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1095-1106PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether these binding sites were functional we cloned the CD68 proximal promoter, â150 to +2 sequence, upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in plasmid pGL3 Basic and generated a series of linker scan and point mutations to alter the consensus Ets core sequence, GGAA or TTCC on the reverse strand. Transient transfection experiments were performed in THP-1 cells and luciferase activities were normalized by co-transfection with a Î²-galactosidase expressing vector (CMVÎ²-gal). Mutating the GGAA-containing sequence at â106, either by replacing 6 core nucleotides with an MluI site or making a double point mutation, has the most deleterious effect on CD68 promoter activity, giving only 20% of wild type luciferase expression (Fig. 2, D and E). Mutating the â89 site reduces promoter activity by up to 60â70% and mutating â78 has little or no effect (Fig. 2, D and E). These data indicate that the potential Ets binding sites at positions â106 and â89 are required for maximal promoter activity in macrophages. Multiple Ets Factors Bind the Proximal CD68 Promoter with Different AffinitiesâPoin"
https://openalex.org/W2069729429,"The transglutaminase 3 enzyme is widely expressed in many tissues including epithelia. We have shown previously that it can bind three Ca2+ ions, which in site one is constitutively bound, while those in sites two and three are acquired during activation and are required for activity. In particular, binding at site three opens a channel through the enzyme and exposes two tryptophan residues near the active site that are thought to be important for enzyme reaction. In this study, we have solved the structures of three more forms of this enzyme by x-ray crystallography in the presence of Ca2+ and/or Mg2+, which provide new insights on the precise contribution of each Ca2+ ion to activation and activity. First, we found that Ca2+ ion in site one can be exchanged with difficulty, and it has a binding affinity of Kd = 0.3 Î¼m (ÎH = â6.70 Â± 0.52 kcal/mol), which suggests it is important for the stabilization of the enzyme. Site two can be occupied by some lanthanides but only Ca2+ of the Group 2 family of alkali earth metals, and its occupancy are required for activity. Site three can be occupied by some lanthanides, Ca2+,orMg2+; however, when Mg2+ is present, the enzyme is inactive, and the channel is closed. Thus Ca2+ binding in both sites two and three cooperate in opening the channel. We speculate that manipulation of the channel opening could be controlled by intracellular cation levels. Together, these data have important implications for reaction mechanism of the enzyme: the opening of a channel perhaps controls access to and manipulation of substrates at the active site.

Transglutaminases (TGases) 1The abbreviations used are: TGase, transglutaminase; hfXIIIa, human factor XIIIa; NCS, non-crystallographic symmetry; PEG, polyethylene glycol; ICPMS-DRC, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry dynamic reaction cell; r.m.s. root mean square. are ubiquitous enzymes that are used widely in biology for many different purposes. There are nine different genes for TGases in the human (1Folk J.E. Chung S.I. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 358-375Google Scholar, 2Lorand L. Conrad S.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 58: 9-35Google Scholar, 3Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Google Scholar, 4Melino G. Candi E. Steinert P.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 433-472Google Scholar, 5Fesus L. Piacentini M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 534-539Google Scholar). Typically, TGases recognize and activate a protein-bound Gln residue by formation of a thiol-acyl intermediate form. The recognition of a Gln residue may be highly specific, such as is apparently the case of the factor XIIIa, TGase 3, and TGase 4 enzymes, or with rather low specificity as for the TGase 2 enzyme. Next, this acyl intermediate is approached by a nucleophilic second substrate, which transfers onto the Gln residue. Commonly, the nucleophile is water, resulting in the net deamidation of a target Gln residue. If the nucleophile is the Ïµ-NH2 of a protein-bound Lys residue, an isopeptide Ïµ-(Î³-glutamyl)lysine cross-link is formed. As this cannot be cleaved in animal cells, controlled TGase activity thereby provides an efficient way for the formation of stable, insoluble macromolecular complexes. Other nucleophiles used include polyamines (to form mono- or bi-substituted/cross-linked adducts) or -OH groups to form ester linkages (as in the case of the membrane-bound TGase 1 enzyme to link epidermis-specific ceramides required for barrier function) (6Nemes Z. Marekov L.N. Fesus L. Steinert P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8402-8407Google Scholar). The TGase 2 enzyme can bind GTP nucleotides, and there is a reciprocal relationship between this binding and transamidation reactivity (7Lee K.N. Birckbichler P.J. Patterson Jr., M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 1370-1375Google Scholar, 8Im M.J. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18944-18951Google Scholar, 9Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M.J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Google Scholar), presumably because the GTP binds in the vicinity of where cross-linking substrates must gain access to the enzyme for reaction (10Liu S. Cerione R.A. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2743-2747Google Scholar). It remains to be demonstrated whether other TGase isoforms can also manipulate nucleotides. In addition, TGase enzyme transamidation reactions require Ca2+, in both in vitro assays and in vivo (1Folk J.E. Chung S.I. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 358-375Google Scholar, 2Lorand L. Conrad S.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 58: 9-35Google Scholar, 3Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Google Scholar, 4Melino G. Candi E. Steinert P.M.

In the few cases measured, the Ca2+ concentration required to activate an enzyme isoform (>500 Î¼m) is far higher than net intracellular Ca2+ ion concentrations (about 100 nm) (11Nemes Z. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11013-11021Google Scholar). Also, Ca2+ is not required for GTP binding (7Lee K.N. Birckbichler P.J. Patterson Jr., M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 1370-1375Google Scholar, 8Im M.J. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18944-18951Google Scholar, 9Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M.J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Google Scholar). Thus manipulation of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations could afford an effective way to control TGase functions, including cross-linking. Despite the evident essential role of Ca2+ ions in TGase cross-linking reactions, very little is known structurally/functionally why Ca2+ ions are in fact required. Recently however, we solved the structure of the zymogen and the activated form of the TGase 3 enzyme system (12Kim H.C. Nemes Z. Idler W.W. Hyde C.C. Steinert P.M. Ahvazi B. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 73-77Google Scholar, 13Ahvazi B. Kim H.C. Kee S.H. Nemes Z. Steinert P.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2055-2067Google Scholar). Whereas the zymogen constitutively acquires one ion during expression (in baculovirus), it is insufficient for activity. Upon proteolytic cleavage of a loop segment connecting the active site domain to the Î²-barrel 1 domain, the cleaved enzyme can acquire two additional Ca2+ ions, and becomes fully active. These events coincide with the opening of a channel, which passes through the enzyme. Moreover, this channel exposes two tryptophan residues, which are believed to be important in the enzyme reaction mechanism (13Ahvazi B. Kim H.C. Kee S.H. Nemes Z. Steinert P.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2055-2067Google Scholar). The channel is formed upon the opening of an existing deep cavity by movement of a Î²-strand loop (residues Gly322âSer325) so that Asp324 can coordinate with the Ca2+ ion that occupies the site nominally termed site three. We also showed that certain trivalent lanthanide ions can occupy sites three and/or two with retention of activity and an open channel. However, key questions remain unanswered. What are the relative contributions of the occupancy of each Ca2+ ion in the two sites, and why is there a site two? Does the proteolyzed form in the absence of metal ions in sites two and three possess a channel, or partially opened channel, or no channel? Nor of course are lanthanide ions physiologic. Accordingly, here we present the structures of three more forms of the proteolyzed TGase 3 by x-ray crystallography crystallized in the absence or presence of Ca2+ and/or more biologically relevant Mg2+ ions. Our new data reveal that Ca2+ ions are essential in sites two and three to open the channel for full enzymic activity, and that aMg2+ ion in site three cannot open the channel to activate the enzyme. Given that the intracellular concentration of Mg2+ ions is several orders of magnitude higher than for Ca2+ ions, these data show that the opening of a channel and acquisition of activity can be exquisitely controlled by the ionic milieu and by differential coordination of metal ions. Moreover, these data strongly imply that this channel is indeed required for enzyme reactivity. Protein Expression, Crystallization, and Data CollectionâRecombinant human TGase 3 zymogen was expressed in the baculovirus system and purified as described (12Kim H.C. Nemes Z. Idler W.W. Hyde C.C. Steinert P.M. Ahvazi B. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 73-77Google Scholar). To prepare the proteolyzed form (form I, see Table I), a 12-ml solution of zymogen (17 mg/ml in a buffer of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 125 mm NaCl) was treated with 3 mg of dispase (Roche Applied Science) at 37 Â°C for 30 min. However, the dispase contains significant amounts of Ca2+ ions. Accordingly, to recover the proteolyzed form devoid of Ca2+ ions, protein was then passed through a mono Q column with a linear gradient of 0â500 mm NaCl and eluted at 150 mm NaCl (12Kim H.C. Nemes Z. Idler W.W. Hyde C.C. Steinert P.M. Ahvazi B. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 73-77Google Scholar). This is defined here as form II. Empirically, we found that the addition of 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP salt to form II resulted in the form III, which possessed a Ca2+ ion in site two and a Mg2+ ion in site three, although the ATP salt did not bind. We were unable to find crystallization conditions in which only site two or site three alone contained an ion.Table ICrystallographic parameters and data processing statisticsSpace groupForm IaTG3 was proteolyzed with dispase for activation.Form IIbTG3 was proteolyzed with dispase activation and mono Q purified.Form IIIcTG3 was proteolyzed with dispase, mono Q column purified, and incubated with CaCl2, MgCl2, and ATP salt (see text).P21P21P1Unit cell parametersa = 57.54 AÌa = 57.74 AÌa = 57.51 AÌb = 115.37 AÌb = 115.84 AÌb = 66.81 AÌc = 121.39 AÌc = 61.96 AÌc = 116.53 AÌÎ² = 92.66Â°Î² = 94.14Â°Î± = 97.24Â°Î² = 90.28Â°Î³ = 98.36Â°Data collection statisticsResolution range (AÌ)20-2.7020-2.7025-2.40(2.80-2.70)(2.80-2.70)(2.55-2.40)Completeness (%)dIn parenthesis: highest resolution shell.93.7 (88.4)97.9 (91.8)98.3 (97.7)Number of reflections409,995199,869495,285Number of unique reflections41,05222,09865,766Overall I/Ï(I)8.9 (2.5)9.5 (2.6)8.3 (2.0)Number of molecules per ASUeASU is asymmetric unit.212Refinement StatisticsNumber of reflections used39,29621,30259,772Protein atoms10,5005,26610,567Number of solvent molecules398198809RcrystalfRcrystal = Î£|Fo(h) â Fc(h)|/Î£Fo(h), where Fo(h), Fc(h) are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes for reflection h./Rfree (%)gRfree was calculated against 10% of the complete data set excluded from refinement.19.9/26.518.6/25.419.4/24.8Average temperature factors (AÌ2)Protein/Solvent20.56/17.6336.04/27.1823.24/25.03Ca2+ (site)16.15(1), 26.69(2), 25.79(3)62.77(1)20.59(1), 32.95(2)Mg2+ (site)44.71 (3)R.m.s. deviation from ideal valuesBond lengths (AÌ)0.0060.0060.006Bond angle (Â°)1.31.31.3Dihedral angles (Â°)25.525.225.6Improper angles (Â°)0.760.780.78a TG3 was proteolyzed with dispase for activation.b TG3 was proteolyzed with dispase activation and mono Q purified.c TG3 was proteolyzed with dispase, mono Q column purified, and incubated with CaCl2, MgCl2, and ATP salt (see text).d In parenthesis: highest resolution shell.e ASU is asymmetric unit.f Rcrystal = Î£|Fo(h) â Fc(h)|/Î£Fo(h), where Fo(h), Fc(h) are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes for reflection h.g Rfree was calculated against 10% of the complete data set excluded from refinement. Open table in a new tab Crystallization trials of form I were performed using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by adding the nonionic detergent Î²-octyl glucoside (0.1 mm) to 100 Î¼l of protein in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 125 mm NaCl at a concentration of 17 mg/ml. To a fresh 2 Î¼l of protein, 2 Î¼l of precipitant solution was added and equilibrated over a well solution containing 4% (w/v) PEG 20,000 and 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) at 21 Â°C. The crystallization of TGase 3 form (II) (15 mg/ml) was done using 0.1 mm Î²-octyl glucoside in 100 Î¼l of protein in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 125 mm NaCl. To a fresh 4 Î¼l of protein, 2 Î¼l of reservoir solution was added and equilibrated over a well solution containing 4â8% (w/v) PEG 6,000 or PEG 20,000, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) at 21 Â°C. The TGase 3 form III (10 mg/ml) crystals were obtained using 0.1 mm Î²-octyl glucoside in 100 Î¼l of protein in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 125 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP salt. To a fresh 4 Î¼l of protein, 2 Î¼l of reservoir solution was added and equilibrated over a well solution containing 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm sodium HEPES (pH 7.5), 4â8% (w/v) PEG 4,000 at 21 Â°C. Thin, plate-like crystals were harvested into mother liquors containing 20% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) as the cryoprotectant and were then flash-cooled into liquid N2 with a rayon mounting loop (Oxford Cryosystems, Oxford, UK) prior to data collection. All data were collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratories, using beamline X9B, the ADSC Quantum 4 detector with a wavelength of 0.92 AÌ, crystal distance-to-detector of 205 mm, and oscillation range of 1.0Â° and exposure for 45 s. The diffraction data from all crystals were indexed, processed, scaled, and merged using the HKL2000 suite of programs (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar). An attempt was made to collect multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data in which halide ions are introduced as anomalous scatterers in the cryoprotectant during a short soak (15Dauter Z. Dauter M. Rajashankar K.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2000; D56: 232-237Google Scholar). The crystal was soaked in 1 m NaBr for 45 s but no anomalous scatterers could be obtained. The data collection statistics of crystals are summarized in Table I. Structure Solution and RefinementâThe crystal structure of the TGase 3 proteolyzed form I was solved by molecular replacement using AmoRe (16Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Google Scholar) and a resolution range of 10 to 3.5 AÌ for the rotation search and between 10 to 3.0 AÌ for the translation search. There were two solutions to both the rotation and translation searches. These solutions gave rise to two molecules within each asymmetric unit in the crystal form in space group P21. The model of the TGase 3-activated enzyme (PDB 1L9M, Ref. 13Ahvazi B. Kim H.C. Kee S.H. Nemes Z. Steinert P.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2055-2067Google Scholar) was used as the initial search model. The initial R-factor after correctly orienting and positioning the two molecules was 35.4% for all the data from 10 to 3.0 AÌ resolution. The rigid body refinement using the program CNS (17Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr Sect. D. 1998; D54: 905-921Google Scholar), followed by simulated annealing applying strict 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) constraints (18Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1996; D52: 842-857Google Scholar) to 3.0 AÌ resolution, improved the solutions yielding a final R-factor of 31.8%. Initial phases were improved using solvent flattening (19CCP4 Collaborative Computational Project 4) Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; D50: 760-763Google Scholar) with 2-fold NCS molecular averaging (20Kleywegt G.J. Read R.J. Structure. 1997; 5: 1557-1569Google Scholar). For final refinement, the NCS restraints were released. After many cycles of manual model rebuilding into SIGMAA-weighted 3 Fo â2 Fc map, the refinement converged at an R-factor of 19.9%, which included all low resolution data set from 20 AÌ resolution as bulk solvent correction. Water molecules were included in the model based on hydrogen bonding, and the presence of reproducible peaks in electron density maps based on their effects on the free R value. In order to avoid overfitting of the model, each step of the rebuilding procedure was monitored using the free R-factor and a residue real space correlation coefficient as a guide. For the TGase 3 (II) data set, starting with one of the monomers of the zymogen form (PDB 1L9N, Ref. 13Ahvazi B. Kim H.C. Kee S.H. Nemes Z. Steinert P.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2055-2067Google Scholar) model as the search probe, molecular replacement in AmoRe (16Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Google Scholar) was used to search for the location of monomer in this crystal form in P21 space group. A translation search yielded the correct solution (CC = 39.5%). The model was refined in CNS (17Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr Sect. D. 1998; D54: 905-921Google Scholar) with the simulated annealing, positional, and B-factor refinement protocols using a maximum likelihood target (21Brunger A.T. Krukowski A. Erickson J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; A46: 585-593Google Scholar). Anisotropic scaling and a bulk solvent correction were used, and the individual B-factors were refined isotropically. Except for the free R set (a random sampling consisting of 9.6% of the data set), all data between 20 and 2.7 AÌ (with no Ï cutoff) were included in the refinement, which was converged at an R-factor of 18.6%. The crystal structure of the TGase 3 form III was solved by molecular replacement using AmoRe (16Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Google Scholar). There were two solutions to both the rotation and translation searches. These solutions gave rise to two molecules within each asymmetric unit in the P1 space group. The model of the TGase 3-activated enzyme (PDB 1L9M, Ref. 13Ahvazi B. Kim H.C. Kee S.H. Nemes Z. Steinert P.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2055-2067Google Scholar) was used as the initial search model without any metals. The rigid body refinement using CNS software (17Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr Sect. D. 1998; D54: 905-921Google Scholar) followed by simulated annealing applying 2-fold NCS molecular averaging (20Kleywegt G.J. Read R.J. Structure. 1997; 5: 1557-1569Google Scholar). For final refinement, the NCS restraints were applied. After many cycles of manual rebuilding into SIGMAA-weighted 3 Fo â2 Fc and Fo âFc maps, the refinement converged at an R-factor of 19.4%, which included all low resolution data set from 25 AÌ resolution as bulk solvent correction (Table I). In each cycle of refinement, model bias was avoided by calculating a composite simulated annealing omit map, which was regularly used to verify, correct, or build the model. The stereochemical quality of the structure was analyzed with the programs PROCHECK (22Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 26: 283-291Google Scholar) and CNS (17Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr Sect. D. 1998; D54: 905-921Google Scholar). Figures were generated with Molscript (23Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Google Scholar) and Raster3D (24Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-525Google Scholar). Biophysical Studies of TGase 3âThe thermodynamic properties of Ca2+ binding to the activated TGase 3 were measured by isothermal titration calorimetry using a MicroCal VP-ITC calorimeter as described previously (13Ahvazi B. Kim H.C. Kee S.H. Nemes Z. Steinert P.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2055-2067Google Scholar). Data were fitted to appropriate binding models and thermodynamic parameters were determined from nonlinear least-squares fits, using ORIGINâ¢ software. Quantitative measurement of metal ion contents was performed by the use of inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry dynamic reaction cell (ICPMS-DRC) using a PerkinElmer ELAN 6100 instrument. Prior to measurements, the TGase 3 (10 mg/ml) was treated with dispase at 37o for 30 min and dialyzed five times against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 5 mm EGTA. The EGTA solution was removed by dialysis against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The concentration of zymogen treated with dispase was 1.5 mg/ml. TGase 3 Activity AssayâTGase activity was assayed by incorporation of [14C]putrescine into casein (25Folk J.E. Cole P.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 122: 244-264Google Scholar). Assays were done at 37 Â°C in 0.5-ml portions of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), containing 1% N,N-dimethylated casein (Sigma), 0.5 Î¼Ci of putrescine (118 mCi/mmol), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm EDTA. TGase 3 Ca2+ Ion Binding AssayâCalcium binding was determined by equilibrium dialysis (26Bergamini C.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 255-258Google Scholar) allowing equilibration of the enzyme (0.5â0.8 mg/ml) against 100 volumes of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) supplemented with increasing amounts of 45CaCl2 (300 cpm/nmol) up to 10 mm. After 48 h at 4 Â°C, aliquots of the enzyme solution and of the dialysate were withdrawn for liquid scintillation counting. The results were normalized to the protein concentration determined by absorbance at 280 nm. The purpose of this study is to better understand the differential structural/functional roles of cations in the three known positions of the TGase 3 enzyme system and to explore their roles in the activation process. We have therefore solved the structures of three additional forms, and selected features are summarized in Table II.Table IISummary of data on roles of Ca2+ions in TGase 3FormSite 1Site 2Site 3TGase activityChannelDataZymogenCa2+<5ClosedRef. 13Ahvazi B.

Kim H.C. Kee S.H. Nemes Z. Steinert P.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2055-2067Google Scholar). The amino-terminal Î²-sandwich domain of TGase 3 (first 134 amino acids) consists of nine strands of Î²-sheets interspersed with three Î±-helices adopting two four-stranded antiparallel sheets twisted about 50Â° with respect to each other to form a distorted Î²-barrel. The catalytic core domain (residues 135â472) consists of 15 Î²-sheets interspersed with 15 Î±-helical segments and is Î±/Î²-type. It contains a central twisted six-stranded antiparallel Î²-sheet motif, which separates two clusters of Î±-helices. The longest Î±-helix of 16 residues is located in the center of the molecule and harbors the active site Cys272 residue, which is buried in this domain. Other members of the catalytic triad, His330 and Asp353, are located on adjacent strands of Î²-sheets. The barrel 1 and barrel 2 domains consist of largely of Î²-sheets arranged in barrel-like conformations, span from residues 473â592 and 593â692, respectively. Residues 462 to 471 form a highly flexible solvent-exposed loop that links the last Î±-helical segment of the catalytic core domain to the first Î²-strand of the barrel 1 domain. This flexible hinge region harbors Ser469, the cleavage site used for proteolytic activation of the TGase 3 zymogen. All structures possess two non-proline cis peptide bonds: Arg268âTyr269 in the strand prior to the loop of Î±-helix that contains the active site Cys272 residue; and Asn382âPhe383 in a loop adjoining two Î±-helices of the core domain. Furthermore, the Gly367âPro368cis-peptide bond is conserved in location in all TGases. The Structure of Form I Is Essentially Identical to the Activated TGase 3âFirst, we wanted to know whether the channel is opened by cleavage of the enzyme alone, that is, before insertion of metal ions at sites two and three. Proteolysis of the TGase 3 zymogen with dispase cleaves at Ser469 the flexible hinge of sequences that joins the active site domain to Î²-barrel 1 domains. This form I, measured in the presence of dispase but with no added Ca2+, is fully active (Table II). Its x-ray diffraction crystal structure is shown in Fig. 1a. The refinement crystallographic statistics are listed in Table I. The x-ray models consist of two crystallographically independent monomers of 692 residues. Both monomers have missing density for a flexible loop between residues 461â479. The r.m.s. difference between the 673 CÎ± carbon atoms of the two monomers is 0.41 AÌ, indicating that the CÎ± backbone structures are almost identical. Each monomer has three Ca2+ ions, and an open channel (Fig. 1b). However, its structure and coordinations of the Ca2+ ions (Fig. 2, form I and Table III) are essentially identical to those of the activated enyzme solved previously (Ref. 13Ahvazi B. Kim H.C. Kee S.H. Nemes Z. Steinert P.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2055-2067Google Scholar and fourth item of Table II). It turns out that the dispase used contains high levels of Ca2+ salts, so that during proteolysis, the cleaved enzyme acquires the two additional Ca2+ ions from the solution to occupy sites two and three. However, the crystal packing arrangement of the two monomers in the asymmetric unit of the structure is the P21 space group, different from the P1 space group seen previously (13Ahvazi B. Kim H.C. Kee S.H. Nemes Z. Steinert P.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2055-2067Google Scholar). Accessible surface area calculations for interface between the monomers in the asymmetric unit give a value of 2694 AÌ2 for the area buried upon formation of the two crystallographic monomers.Fig. 2Identification of key residues involved in the coordination with metal ions in sites one, two, and three in forms I-III.

It has one molecule of 692 residues with missing density for residues 462â478 in its asymmetric unit of the P21 space group (Fig. 1c and Table II). This enzyme is inactive, and the channel is closed (Fig. 1d). Comparisons of its structures and the coordination of its single Ca2+ ion at site one reveal near identity to the uncleaved zymogen (Fig. 2, form II and Table III, and Ref. 13Ahvazi B. Kim H.C. Kee S.H. Nemes Z. Steinert P.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2055-2067Google Scholar). The only significant structural change is that the loop Ile223âVal231 containing Asp228 has shifted away so that Asn227 and Asn229 instead coordinate with the Ca2+ ion in site one.

https://openalex.org/W2053858613,"Recent evidence demonstrates that interactions between different integrins that are present on the cell surface can strongly influence the adhesive function of individual receptors. In this report, we show that Chinese hamster ovary cells that express the integrin Î±vÎ²3 in the absence of Î±5Î²1 demonstrate increased adhesion and migration on fibrinogen. Furthermore, Î±vÎ²3-mediated adhesion to fibrinogen is not augmented by the soluble agonist, MnCl2, suggesting that Î±vÎ²3 exists in a higher affinity state in these cells. De novo expression of wild-type Î±5Î²1 negatively regulates Î±vÎ²3-mediated adhesion and migration. This effect is not seen with expression of a chimeric Î±5Î²1 integrin in which the cytoplasmic portion of the Î±5 integrin subunit is replaced by the cytoplasmic portion of the Î±4 integrin. In addition, it does not require ligation of Î±5Î²1 by fibronectin. Cells that express a constitutively active Î²3 integrin that contains a point mutation in the conserved membrane proximal region of the cytoplasmic tail, D723R, are resistant to the effect of Î±5Î²1 expression. These data provide additional evidence of âcross-talkâ between the integrins Î±5Î²1 and Î±vÎ²3, and support the idea that Î±5Î²1 regulates Î±vÎ²3-mediated ligand binding. This provides a relevant biological mechanism whereby variations in Î±5Î²1 expression in vivo may modulate activation of Î±vÎ²3 to influence its adhesive function.

During wound healing, alterations in integrin expression coincide with deposition of a newly formed provisional ECM whose primary structural components include fibrinogen (FBG) and fibronectin (FN) (5Clark R.A.

Members of the Î²3 integrin family are the primary receptors that mediate cell interactions with FBG (8Corbett S.A. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Surg.

In platelets, the interaction of Î±IIbÎ²3 with FBG is dependent upon agonist-stimulated signaling events that alter the ligand-binding function of the Î±IIbÎ²3 receptor, a process termed âintegrin activationâ (11Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The adhesive function of Î±vÎ²3 also seems to be regulated by intracellular events as recent studies indicate that the basal affinity of this receptor varies both by intracellular location and among cell types (12Byzova T.V. Kim W. Midura R.J. Plow E.F. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 13Kiosses W.B. Shattil S.J. Pampori N. Schwartz M.A. Nat.

Activation of Î±vÎ²3 results in different functional states of the receptor that influence important integrin-dependent events, including cell migration, angiogenesis, and metastatic activity (14Felding-Habermann B. O'Toole T.E. Smith J.W. Fransvea E. Ruggeri Z.M. Ginsberg M.H. Hughes P.E. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. Saven A. Mueller B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2000; 6: 851-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although rapid regulation of Î±vÎ²3 function may represent a common mechanism for the modulation of cell-ECM interactions, little is known about the molecular events that affect receptor affinity. Recent evidence demonstrates that interactions between different integrins that are present on the cell surface can strongly influence the adhesive function of individual receptors. This effect, referred to as integrin âcross-talk,â has been demonstrated in a number of systems (16Diaz-Gonzalez F. Forsyth J. Steiner B. Ginsberg M.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1939-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For example, ligation of Î±4Î²1 inhibits Î±5Î²1-dependent expression of metalloproteases (17Huhtala P. Humphries M.J. McCarthy J.B. Tremble P.M. Werb Z. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 867-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Interactions between Î²3 integrins and Î±5Î²1 have also been described. Ligation of Î±IIbÎ²3 by an integrin-specific FBG ligand suppresses the adhesive function of both Î±5Î²1 and Î±2Î²1 (16Diaz-Gonzalez F. Forsyth J. Steiner B. Ginsberg M.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1939-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Similarly, anti-Î±vÎ²3 antibodies block both Î±5Î²1-mediated phagocytosis of FN-coated beads and Î±5Î²1-mediated migration toward FN (18Blystone S.D. Graham I.L. Lindberg F.P. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The reverse effect also appears to be true as anti-Î±5Î²1 antibodies inhibit Î±vÎ²3-mediated cell migration, without influencing cell adhesion (19Kim S. Harris M. Varner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33920-33928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both integrins are up-regulated on migrating cells post-injury where they are important receptors for provisional ECM proteins (5Clark R.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 94 (S): 128S-1134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 20Stouffer G.A. Hu Z. Sajid M. Li H. Jin G. Nakada M.T. Hanson S.R. Runge M.S.

Cell Res. 1997; 232: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In this paper, we present further evidence of cross-talk between the integrins Î±5Î²1 and Î±vÎ²3. We report that in the absence of Î±5Î²1, Î±vÎ²3 exists in an âactivatedâ state demonstrating high affinity for FBG that is not augmented by soluble agonists. De novo expression of Î±5Î²1, however, suppresses Î±vÎ²3-mediated adhesive functions. The Î±5Î²1-mediated modulation of Î±vÎ²3 occurs through a mechanism that is dependent on the cytoplasmic tail of the Î± integrin subunit. Furthermore, cells that express a constitutively active Î²3 integrin are resistant to the effects of Î±5Î²1, supporting evidence that the expression of Î±5Î²1 regulates Î±vÎ²3 affinity for its ligands. These data provide a relevant biological mechanism whereby variations in Î±5Î²1 expression in vivo may modulate activation of Î±vÎ²3 to influence its adhesive function. Construction of Chimeric Integrin cDNAâA 1.8-kb BamHI-XhoI fragment encoding the amino-terminal portion of the human Î±5 cDNA in pLJ (a gift of Dr. Jean Schwarzbauer, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ) was cloned into pcDNA 3.1(+) (pcDNA 3.1 Î±5-N, Invitrogen). A 2.5-kb fragment containing the carboxyl terminus of the human Î±5 cDNA was then ligated into a XhoI digest of pcDNA 3.1 Î±5-N to yield a complete human Î±5 cDNA in pcDNA 3.1 (X5C5). The X4C4 cDNA, encoding the wild-type human Î±4 integrin subunit (a gift of Dr. Patricia Keely, University of Wisconsin Medical School, Madison WI), was used to create the chimeric X5C4 cDNA. Briefly, a 1.3-kb KpnI-XbaI fragment of X4C4, containing the cytoplasmic portion of the receptor was cloned into pcDNA 3.1 to generate pcDNA 3.1 C4. A 3.1-kb HindIII digest of X5C5 was used to generate the amino-terminal portion of Î±5 that encoded the extracellular and transmembrane regions of the receptor. This HindIII fragment was cloned into a HindIII-digested pcDNA 3.1 C4 to yield X5C4. The cytoplasmic portions of X5C5 and X5C4 were sequenced at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School DNA Core Facility to confirm the sequence of each chimeric construct. Cells, Cell Culture, and TransfectionâThe Î±5-negative, Î²3-negative Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) B2 cells were a kind gift of Dr. Jean Schwarzbauer. CHO B2 Î±vÎ²3 (D723R) cells were a kind gift of Dr. Mark Ginsberg (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) and were designated CHO B3(D-R). CHO B2 cells were transfected with a wild-type human Î²3 cDNA by electroporation. Stable transfectants, designated CHO B3, were established by selection in 500 Î¼g/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) and were analyzed for Î±vÎ²3 expression as described below. CHO B3 cells were then transfected with either the X5C5 cDNA (CHO B3C5) or the chimeric X5C4 cDNA (CHO B3C4)), and selected in Zeocin and 200 Î¼g/ml Geneticin (G418, Invitrogen). CHO B3(D-R) cells were transfected with the X5C5 cDNA (CHO B3(D-R)C5). Sterile fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), performed on an EPIC Altra high speed cell sorter (Beckman-Spinco, Miami, FL), was used to establish cell populations that expressed similar levels of Î±vÎ²3 and Î±5Î²1. CHO X5C5 (Î±vÎ²3â/Î±5Î²1+) and X5C4 cells (Î±vÎ²3â/Î±5mutÎ²1+) were established by transfection of CHO B2 cells with the X5C5 or X5C4 cDNAs, respectively and selection as described above. Cell surface expression of both Î±vÎ²3 and Î±5Î²1 were assessed and monitored by FACS weekly to ensure stable integrin expression. All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), 1% non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1% sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 1% antibiotics/antimycotics (Invitrogen), and Zeocin or G418 as indicated. Chimeric Integrin ExpressionâFor additional verification of the wild-type and mutant Î±5 integrins, cells were grown in 10-cm tissue culture plates until confluent. Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed. Equal amounts of total cell lysate were incubated with 2 Î¼g of a monoclonal antibody specific for the Î±5 integrin extracellular domain (Chemicon International Co., Temecula, CA) at 4 Â°C overnight. Immunocomplexes were recovered by incubating with Protein A-Protein G-Sepharose (Pierce) for 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose (Fisher Scientific). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk at 4 Â°C overnight. Immunodetection was performed using a polyclonal antibody specific for the Î±5 integrin extracellular domain (Chemicon) or monoclonal antibodies specific for the Î±5 integrin cytoplasmic domain or the Î±4 integrin cytoplasmic domain (Chemicon and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Î±5) or bovine anti-goat (Î±4) secondary antibody (Pierce). The specific proteins were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions and exposed to film (X-Omat, Eastman Kodak). Determination of Cell Surface Integrin ExpressionâCells were trypsinized, washed with incubation buffer (1Ã PBS and 2% fetal calf serum) and resuspended at a concentration of 1 Ã 107 cells/ml in incubation buffer. Cells were incubated on ice with monoclonal antibody specific for either Î±vÎ²3 (LM609; 1 Î¼g/1 Ã 106 cells; Chemicon) or Î±5Î²1 (VC5; 1 Î¼g/1 Ã 106 cells; BD Pharmingen) for 30 min, washed once, and then incubated on ice with an Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Following additional washes, cells were pelleted, resuspended in incubation buffer, and analyzed by FACS on the EPIC Altra cell sorter. Preparation of FN-depleted FBGâHuman FBG (Calbiochem/Novabiochem, San Diego, CA) was brought into solution at a concentration of 100 mg/15 ml according to the manufacturer's instructions. FN was depleted using gelatin-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, 7.5 ml of FBG solution was combined with 2 ml of packed gelatin-Sepharose beads. The mixture was rotated at room temperature for 1 h. After pelleting the beads, the supernatant was transferred to a second gelatin-Sepharose containing tube and the process was repeated. Beads were then pelleted, and the supernatant containing FN-depleted FBG was collected. Protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) and adjusted to 5â6 mg/ml. FN-depleted FBG was then aliquoted and stored at â80 Â°C. FBG was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie stain to assess FN depletion. Cell Adhesion Assaysâ96-Well dishes were coated overnight at 4 Â°C with increasing concentrations of FBG, thrombospondin (TSP), or FN as indicated. Control wells were incubated with PBS. For each experiment, wells were formed in triplicate for each condition. Cell adhesion assay was performed as previously described (8Corbett S.A. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Surg. Res. 1999; 83: 27-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, 8 Ã 104 cells were added to each well, and incubated at 37 Â°C for 1 h. Adherent cells were fixed and stained for 25 min in a mixture of 2% EtOH, 100 mm sodium borate, and 0.5% crystal violet. Dye was then eluted with 10% acetic acid. The optical density (OD) at 570 nm was measured for each well using a 96-well microtiter plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). To eliminate the contribution of cell spreading to adhesion, short time course experiments were also performed. In these experiments, 24-well dishes were coated with either 50 Î¼g/ml FBG or 10 Î¼g/ml TSP. 2 Ã 105 cells were added to each well and allowed to adhere for 15 min. The wells were then washed gently to remove non-adherent cells. Adherent cells were then fixed, stained, and counted as described below. Each well was formed in duplicate. In certain experiments, cell adhesion was performed in the presence of function blocking antibodies to either Î±vÎ²3 (LM609) or Î±5Î²1 (P1D6; 25 Î¼g/ml; Oncogene Research Products, La Jolla, CA). For integrin activation assays, cell adhesion was performed in the presence or absence of either 100 Î¼m MnCl2 or 200 nm PMA. To quantify cell adhesion, cells were fixed with methanol for 15 min, and stained with modified Giemsa stain (Sigma) for1hat room temperature. Cells from 3 random high power fields were counted by light microscopy and averaged. For each experiment, the mean of the samples was obtained and normalized relative to the adhesion of B3 cell. The data are expressed as the mean Â± S.E. of three separate experiments. A one-way analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keul's test was used for statistical analysis of the data. Cell Spreading Assaysâ24-Well tissue culture dishes were coated overnight with 50 Î¼g/ml FBG at 4 Â°C. Cells in serum-free medium were placed in FBG-coated wells (2.5 Ã 105 cells/well) and incubated for increasing time as indicated. At each time point, cells were fixed with methanol and stained with modified Giemsa. Stained cells were viewed under high power using inverted bright-field optics. Photographic images were captured using a Spot color camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI) connected to a MacIntosh G4 computer equipped with IPLab image analysis software. Cell Migration AssaysâCostar transwells (8.0 Î¼m pores, 6.5 mm diameter (Fisher Scientific)) were coated on both sides or on the under-surface only with 50 Î¼g/ml FBG or 10 Î¼g/ml FN overnight at 4 Â°C, washed with PBS, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin prior to usage. 2.5 Ã 105 cells in serum-free medium with 1% bovine serum albumin were placed into the upper chamber of coated transwells and incubated under tissue culture conditions for 5 h. Non-migrated cells were removed by wiping the upper side of the membrane with a cotton swab. The transwells were washed 3 times with PBS, fixed with methanol, and stained with modified Giemsa. The transwells were then rinsed with Milli-Q water. The stained cells in three random high powered fields were counted by light microscopy. Each experiment was repeated three times. Data are expressed either as the mean cell count Â± S.E. or as the percent of cells migrated relative to B3 cells. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keul's test. Clot Retraction Assaysâ12-Well non-tissue culture dishes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin at 4 Â°C overnight. Wells were washed 3 times in PBS the next day and left to dry. Cells were detached as described above and resuspended in 25 mm Hepes-buffered saline. For integrin activation assays, cells were pretreated with 100 Î¼m MnCl2 for 15 min. To prepare fibrin clots for retraction assays, the clotting components as listed were mixed in a volume of 1.5 ml at room temperature: FN-depleted FBG (720 Î¼g/ml), 1 mm CaCl2, 20 Î¼g/ml aprotinin (Sigma), 2 Î¼g/ml human plasma coagulation factor XIII (Calbiochem), 25 mm Hepes saline, Â±MnCl2, 1.0 units/ml thrombin (Sigma). Cells (3 Ã 106 cells/clot) were added to the clot components followed quickly by thrombin. After the addition of thrombin, the mixture was rapidly pipetted into 24-well tissue culture dishes and incubated at 37 Â°Cfor1hina tissue culture incubator. Serum-free medium was then added to the wells and the clots were carefully detached from the dishes using a dissecting microscope. For integrin activation assays, clot retraction was performed in the presence of 100 Î¼m MnCl2. Clot diameter was measured under a dissecting microscope at T0 and at increasing times as indicated. Clot retraction was calculated by subtracting the diameter recorded at each time point from the starting diameter (T0). The data is the mean of six separate experiments and is expressed as clot retraction (mm) Â± S.E. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using two-way analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keul's test. Determination of Integrin Expression in CHO B2-transfected CellsâThe CHO B2 cell line (22Schreiner C.L. Bauer J.S. Danilov Y.N. Hussein S. Sczekan M.M. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which does not express endogenous hamster Î±5Î²1, was transfected with a cDNA encoding the human Î²3 integrin subunit. Stable transfectants expressing Î±vÎ²3 were selected (CHO B3) and surface expression of Î±vÎ²3 was determined by flow cytometry using a monoclonal antibody specific for Î±vÎ²3. B3 cells were then transfected with either a cDNA for the wild-type human Î±5 integrin subunit (X5C5) or a mutant Î±5 cDNA in which the cytoplasmic domain of the Î±5 integrin was replaced by the cytoplasmic domain of the Î±4 integrin (X5C4). Stable cell populations expressing Î±vÎ²3 and either X5C5 or X5C4 were established by FACS using an anti-Î±5 monoclonal antibody to establish the B3C5 and B3C4 cell lines, respectively. Fig. 1A demonstrates that B3 and B3C5 cells express similar levels of Î±vÎ²3. B3C5 cells, but not B3 cells, express Î±5Î²1. B3C5 and B3C4 cells expressed similar levels of both Î±5Î²1 and Î±vÎ²3 (Fig. 1A). Immunoblot analysis of B3C5 and B3C4 cell lysates with antibodies specific to either the Î±5 or Î±4 cytoplasmic tails confirm the expression of the chimeric receptor (Fig. 1B). Î±5Î²1Regulates Î±vÎ²3-mediated Adhesive EventsâFBG, a key component of the provisional ECM that is deposited in early wounds, is a ligand for Î±vÎ²3 (21Gailit J. Clarke C. Newman D. Tonnesen M.G. Mosesson M.W. Clark R.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of Î±5Î²1 on Î±vÎ²3-mediated cell adhesion to FBG, CHO cells expressing Î±vÎ²3 alone (B3), Î±5Î²1 alone (X5C5), or both Î±vÎ²3 and Î±5Î²1 (B3C5) were examined. Cells transfected with an empty vector served as a negative control (P3). B3 cells adhere to FBG in a concentration dependent fashion (Fig. 2A). B3 cell adhesion to FBG is completely inhibited by LM609, a function-blocking antibody specific for Î±vÎ²3 (data not shown). Surprisingly, B3C5 cells that express both Î±vÎ²3 and Î±5Î²1 demonstrate significantly decreased adhesion to FBG when compared with B3 cells despite expression of comparable levels of the Î±vÎ²3 integrin (p = 0.0002 at 100 Î¼g/ml FBG). Control cells and cells expressing Î±5Î²1 alone (X5C5) do not adhere to FBG. B3, B3C5, and X5C5 cell adhesion to FN was also examined. No discernible difference was measured, supporting previous work that demonstrates that individually both Î±vÎ²3 and Î±5Î²1 support adhesion to FN (data not shown). To determine whether the effect of Î±5Î²1 on Î±vÎ²3-mediated adhesion was specific for FBG, adhesion of B3 and B3C5 cells to TSP was also examined. B3C5 cell adhesion to TSP was decreased by 50% when compared with B3 cells, an effect comparable with that seen for FBG (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these data suggest that co-expression of Î±5Î²1 with Î±vÎ²3 negatively regulates Î±vÎ²3 interaction with its ligands. At 1 h after plating on FBG, both B3 and B3C5 cells are partially spread (Fig. 3A). To eliminate the contribution of cell spreading to cell adhesion, short time course adhesion assays were also performed. At 15 min following adhesion to FBG, B3 cells remain round. By 30 min, however, a significant number of cells are partially spread (data not shown). Therefore, adhesion assays were performed at the 15-min time point. B3C5 cells demonstrate a significant decrease in cell adhesion to both FBG and TSP at 15 min (Fig. 2, B and D). This data confirms that co-expression of Î±5Î²1 with Î±vÎ²3, significantly inhibits Î±vÎ²3-mediated cell adhesion to its ligands, independent of cell spreading. The cell adhesion experiments were performed in the absence of exogenous FN. However, CHO B2 cells do produce a small amount of cellular FN. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of Î±5Î²1 on Î±vÎ²3-mediated adhesion could require the ligation of Î±5Î²1 by endogenous FN. To test this hypothesis, B3C5 cells were allowed to adhere to FBG in the presence of the Î±5Î²1 function-blocking antibody. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, E and F, incubation of B3C5 cells with P1D6 did not significantly affect Î±vÎ²3-mediated adhesion to FBG at either the 15- or 60-min time points (p = 0.24). This suggests that the inhibitory effect of Î±5Î²1 on Î±vÎ²3 does not require the binding of FN to Î±5Î²1. Cell spreading follows cell attachment to adhesive substrates. Whereas B3C5 cell adhesion to FBG is significantly decreased, some cells do adhere. When B3C5 cell spreading on FBG was examined, however, cells show decreased spreading at all time points when compared with B3 cells (Fig. 3A). Î±5Î²1Blocks Î±vÎ²3-mediated Migration on FBGâIntegrin Î±vÎ²3 has an important role in cell migration, particularly during wound healing. Therefore, we sought to determine the effect of Î±5Î²1 expression on Î±vÎ²3-mediated cell migration on FBG. Random migration on FBG was determined using a Boyden chamber assay in which transwells were coated on both sides with FBG. As demonstrated in Fig. 3B, B3 cells migrate efficiently on FBG. Expression of integrin Î±5Î²1, however, inhibited greater than 90% of Î±vÎ²3-mediated cell migration (p = 0.0001). To determine whether this reflected a global decrease in migratory function of B3C5 cells, cell migration on FN was also examined. When B3 and B3C5 cell migration on FN were compared, no discernible difference was measured (Fig. 3B). Cells expressing Î±5Î²1 alone do not migrate on FBG (Fig. 4A). However, these cells can migrate efficiently on FN (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that expression of the integrin Î±5Î²1 suppresses Î±vÎ²3-mediated cell migration Inhibition of Î±vÎ²3by Î±5Î²1Is Dependent on the Cytoplasmic Tail of the Î±5Integrin SubunitâOne possible explanation for the effect of Î±5Î²1 expression on Î±vÎ²3-mediated adhesive events may be that the presence of Î±5Î²1 sterically hinders the interaction of Î±vÎ²3 with its ligand. To test this hypothesis, B3 cells were transfected with a chimeric Î±5 integrin cDNA, in which the cytoplasmic domain of the Î±5 integrin was replaced by the cytoplasmic domain of the Î±4 integrin. A stable cell line expressing the mutant Î±5 was established as described above (B3C4). B3C5 and B3C4 cells express similar levels of cell surface Î±5Î²1 (Fig. 1A). As previously demonstrated, the expression of wild-type Î±5Î²1 significantly inhibits Î±vÎ²3-mediated migration on FBG (Fig. 4A). When the B3C4 cells expressing the chimeric Î±5 integrin are examined, however, their migration on FBG is significantly greater than the B3C5 cells and is comparable with the untransfected B3 cells. To confirm that the chimeric Î±5 integrin is functional, CHO B2 cells were transfected with wild-type (X5C5) or mutant (X5C4) Î±5Î²1 cDNA and stable cell lines were established by FACS. There was no difference between the X5C5 and X5C4 cell migrations on FN (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these data suggest that Î±5Î²1 acts in an âinside-outâ fashion to negatively regulate Î±vÎ²3-mediated migration and that this effect is dependent on the Î±5 integrin cytoplasmic domain. Mn2+Promotes B3C5 Cell Adhesion to FBGâIntracellular signaling events can modulate integrin ligand binding affinity, a process termed activation or inside-out signaling (23Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 24Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). This process has been well described for members of the Î²3 integrin family (12Byzova T.V. Kim W. Midura R.J. Plow E.F. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 25Byzova T.V. Plow E.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 2081-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that co-expression of the integrin Î±5Î²1 leads to an alteration in the affinity state of Î±vÎ²3 resulting in decreased ligand binding. To test this hypothesis, we used Mn2+, a divalent cation known to stimulate integrin activity and interactions with ligand (26Bazzoni G. Shih D.T. Buck C.A. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25570-25577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). B3, B3C5, or X5C5 cells were allowed to adhere to FBG in the presence or absence of 100 Î¼m Mn2+ for 1 h (Fig. 5A). Treatment with Mn2+ does not significantly improve B3 cell adhesion to FBG, suggesting that Î±vÎ²3 exists in a higher affinity state in these cells. When Mn2+ is added to B3C5 cells, however, there is a significant increase in adhesion to FBG to a level that is comparable with the B3 cells (p = 0.41). X5C5 cells show no increased affinity for FBG in the presence of MnCl2. Similar results were obtained when adhesion was performed at 15 min (data not shown). Interestingly, enhanced adhesion of B3C5 cells to FBG is not seen in the presence of PMA (Fig. 5B). These data demonstrate that Î±vÎ²3 exists in a low affinity state when co-expressed with Î±5Î²1.

https://openalex.org/W2098231525,"At least three structural proteins in Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus (PBCV-1) are glycosylated, including the major capsid protein Vp54. However, unlike other glycoprotein-containing viruses that use host-encoded enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi to glycosylate their proteins, PBCV-1 encodes at least many, if not all, of the glycosyltransferases used to glycosylate its structural proteins. As described here, PBCV-1 also encodes two open reading frames that resemble bacterial and mammalian enzymes involved in de novo GDP-L-fucose biosynthesis. This pathway, starting from GDP-D-mannose, consists of two sequential steps catalyzed by GDP-D-mannose 4,6 dehydratase (GMD) and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose epimerase/reductase, respectively. The two PBCV-1-encoded genes were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant proteins had the predicted enzyme activity. However, in addition to the dehydratase activity, PBCV-1 GMD also had a reductase activity, producing GDP-D-rhamnose. In vivo studies established that PBCV-1 GMD and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose epimerase/reductase are expressed after virus infection and that both GDP-L-fucose and GDP-D-rhamnose are produced in virus-infected cells. Thus, PBCV-1 is the first virus known to encode enzymes involved in nucleotide sugar metabolism. Because fucose and rhamnose are components of the glycans attached to Vp54, the pathway could circumvent a limited supply of GDP sugars by the algal host.

Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus (PBCV-1) 1The abbreviations used are: PBCV-1, Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus 1; GMD, GDP-d-mannose 4,6 dehydratase; GMER, GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose epimerase/reductase; p.i., postinfection; ORF, open reading frame; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. is the prototypical member of a group of large polyhedral, plaque-forming viruses in the family Phycodnaviridae that replicate in certain unicellular, eukaryotic Chlorella-like green algae (1Van Etten J.L. Lane L.C. Meints R.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 586-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PBCV-1 genome, which has been sequenced, consists of a large (>330 kb) linear, non-permuted double-stranded DNA with covalently closed hairpin ends (2Van Etten J.L. Meints R.H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 447-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Additional features of the virus have been reviewed recently (3Van Etten J.L. Graves M.V. Muller D.G. Boland W. Delaroque N. Arch. Virol. 2002; 147: 1479-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The PBCV-1 major capsid protein, Vp54, located on the viral surface, is one of three glycosylated viral proteins. The glycan portion of Vp54 contains seven neutral sugars, glucose, fucose, rhamnose, galactose, mannose, xylose, and arabinose (4Wang I.N. Li Y. Que Q. Bhattacharya M. Lane L.C. Chaney W.G. Van Etten J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3840-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) that contribute to the protease resistance and antigenicity of the virus. Recently, the Vp54 crystal structure was solved, and four N-linked glycosylation sites and two O-linked oligosaccharides were identified (5Nandhagopal N. Simpson A.A. Gurnon J.R. Yan X. Baker T.S. Graves M.V. Van Etten J.L. Rossmann M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14758-14763Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, the four glycosylated Asn residues are not located in consensus sequences typical of eukaryotic N-linked glycans (5Nandhagopal N. Simpson A.A. Gurnon J.R. Yan X. Baker T.S. Graves M.V. Van Etten J.L. Rossmann M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14758-14763Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This finding, together with other results (4Wang I.N. Li Y. Que Q. Bhattacharya M. Lane L.C. Chaney W.G. Van Etten J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3840-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 6Que Q. Li Y. Wang Y. Lane L.C. Chaney W.G.

Virology. 2001; 285: 332-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), led to the conclusion that unlike other viruses PBCV-1 encodes at least part, if not all, of the machinery required to glycosylate its structural proteins. Furthermore, glycosylation probably occurs independently of the host endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi system. Analysis of the PBCV-1 genome revealed several ORFs that are related to enzymes involved in glycan formation. For example, PBCV-1 encodes three enzymes, UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, glucosamine synthase, and hyaluronan synthase, involved in the biosynthesis of the extracellular matrix polysaccharide hyaluronan (8DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Graves M.V. Burbank D.E. Van Etten J.L. Science. 1997; 278: 1800-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 9Landstein D. Graves M.V. Burbank D.E. DeAngelis P. Van Etten J.L.

Virology. 1999; 257: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Other ORFs resemble glycosyltransferases and enzymes involved in the metabolism of nucleotide sugars (2Van Etten J.L. Meints R.H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 447-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 3Van Etten J.L. Graves M.V. Muller D.G. Boland W. Delaroque N. Arch. Virol. 2002; 147: 1479-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In the present study we characterize two PBCV-1 ORFs, A118R and A295L, that encode proteins that resemble GDP-D-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (GMD) and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose epimerase/reductase (GMER), respectively. GMD and GMER are highly conserved proteins involved in GDP-L-fucose formation in bacteria, plants, and animals (11Tonetti M. Sturla L. Bisso A. Benatti U. De Flora A. J. Biol.

Enzyme analyses, performed on both the recombinant proteins and extracts from PBCV-1-infected Chlorella cells, indicate that both proteins are functionally active, leading to the production of two nucleotide sugars, GDP-L-fucose and GDP-D-rhamnose. Therefore, PBCV-1 is the first known virus to encode enzymes involved in nucleotide sugar metabolism. Cloning and Expression of Recombinant GMD and GMERâProduction of virus PBCV-1 and DNA isolation were performed as described (16Van Etten J.L. Burbank D.E. Xia Y. Meints R.H. Virology. 1983; 126: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 17Van Etten J.L. Meints R.H. Burbank D.E. Kuczmarski D. Cuppels D.A. Lane L.C. Virology. 1981; 113: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Gene-specific primers were used for PCR amplification of the protein encoding regions for the putative GMD and GMER enzymes, ORFs A118R and A295L, respectively. The forward primers used to amplify GMD (5â²-AATTGGATCCATGTTGTCTAAAGTTGCATTAGT) and GMER (5â²-AATTGGATCCATGATAATGGATAAGCACTCTAA) contained a BamHI restriction site, whereas the reverse primers for GMD (5â²-AATTCTCGAGTTATTTATTTCCAAACGTATCTGA) and GMER (5â²-AATTCTCGAGTTAGTTCGTGTTAGTATATTTTATA) contained a XhoI restriction site. Polymerase chain reactions (50 Î¼l) were performed with 1.5 units of Pfu polymerase (Sigma), in the presence of 2 mm MgSO4, 0.2 mm deoxyribonucleotides triphosphate, and 0.1 Î¼m primers. The PCR products were purified from 1.2% agarose gels using the Nucleobond kit (Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany), digested with BamHI and XhoI, and ligated into the pGEX-6-P1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) using a rapid ligation kit (Roche Applied Science). The resulting plasmids were used to transform E. coli K803. DNA sequencing of positive clones was performed by M-Medical (Firenze, Italy). E. coli K803 cells containing vectors with the correct inserts were grown in 2Ã YT medium (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, pH 7.0), containing 200 Î¼g/ml ampicillin. Expression of both glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-Î²-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Optimal protein recovery was obtained by induction at 20 Â°C for 16 h for GMD and at 30 Â°C for 2 h for GMER. Cell lysis, purification of the fusion proteins, and proteolytic cleavage of the glutathione S-transferase tag were performed as described (18Bisso A. Sturla L. Zanardi D. De Flora A. Tonetti M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and protein purity was monitored by SDS-PAGE. Both recombinant proteins were stored at 4 Â°Cin50mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol in the presence of 10% glycerol. In Vivo Expression of PBCV-1 GMD and GMERâChlorella NC64A was grown in modified Bold's basal medium and infected with PBCV-1 following described procedures (16Van Etten J.L. Burbank D.E. Xia Y. Meints R.H. Virology. 1983; 126: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Aliquots were withdrawn at various times postinfection (p.i.), and RNA was isolated, electrophoresed under denaturing conditions on 1.5% agarose/formaldehyde gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and transferred to nylon membranes as described (19Sun L. Adams B. Gurnon J.R. Ye Y. Van Etten J.L. Virology. 1999; 263: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The RNA was hybridized with a118r or a295l probes; the probes were labeled with 32P using the random primers DNA labeling system (Invitrogen). After hybridization, radioactivity bound to the membranes was visualized using Storm 840 phosphorimaging and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) as described (19Sun L. Adams B. Gurnon J.R. Ye Y. Van Etten J.L. Virology. 1999; 263: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Protein expression and enzyme activities were assayed on cell extracts obtained at various times after virus infection. Cells were disrupted by resuspending algal pellets in Tris/HCl 50 mm, pH 7.0, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 Î¼l/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), at 3 Ã 107 cells/ml, and vortexing for 10 min at 4 Â°C with 600 mg/ml of 1-mm glass beads. Supernatants obtained after centrifugation at 12,000 Ã g for 20 min were used for further analyses. Rabbit antisera raised against recombinant GMD and GMER were produced by PRIMM (Milano, Italy). Western analyses employed standard procedures, and detection was performed with the ECLplus system (Amersham Biosciences). Analysis of Enzyme ActivitiesâGMD and GMER activities were assayed on both recombinant proteins and algal extracts prepared from virus-infected cells. Recombinant GMD dehydratase activity was assayed using either unlabeled GDP-d-mannose (Sigma) or a mixture of unlabeled substrate and GDP-d-[U-14C]mannose (New England Nuclear, final specific activity 231 MBq/mmol). Unless otherwise specified, the standard assay contained 100 Î¼M substrate in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, and 1 mm NADP+; products were monitored by reverse phase and anion exchange HPLC (see below). To prepare the GMER substrate GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose, 5 mm GDP-d-mannose was incubated with 200 Î¼g/ml of recombinant viral GMD for 30 min. Conversion of GDP-d-mannose to GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose was determined by HPLC (see below). At the end of the reaction GMD was removed from the incubation mixture by ultrafiltration, using Microcon YM-10 microconcentrators (Millipore). Because of its chemical instability, GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose was used immediately after production. Recombinant GMER activity was assayed by monitoring GDP-l-fucose production by reverse phase HPLC. The standard reaction contained 100 Î¼m substrate in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, and 1 mm NADPH. The products were identified as nucleotide sugars by comparing HPLC retention times with known standards and by electrospray mass spectrometry analyses. Monosaccharides obtained after acid hydrolysis were analyzed by TLC and GC-MS (see below). Cell extracts from uninfected and virus-infected algae were assayed for enzyme activity in Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 100 Î¼m14C-labeled substrates, and either 1 mm NADP+ or NADPH at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml. Products were monitored by both reverse phase and anion exchange HPLC. Chromatographic Analyses of GMD and GMER ProductsâProducts formed from both recombinant proteins and cell extracts were compared with known standards by TLC and HPLC. TLC was performed on the 14C-radiolabeled monosaccharides after acid hydrolysis, as described in Ref. 11Tonetti M. Sturla L. Bisso A. Benatti U. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27274-27279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar. To analyze the intermediate compound GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose, samples were reduced with NaBH4 prior to hydrolysis (11Tonetti M. Sturla L. Bisso A. Benatti U. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27274-27279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The radiolabel was detected with the Cyclone system (Canberra Packard). Sample extractions and reverse phase HPLC, using a C18 column (Waters), followed published procedures (11Tonetti M. Sturla L. Bisso A. Benatti U. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27274-27279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Better separation of GDP-mannose, GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose, and GDP-d-rhamnose was achieved by anion exchange chromatography. For this analysis, 100-Î¼l aliquots of the extracted samples were injected onto a Wesca Anion/R column (Alltech) and eluted with a 100â500 mm NH4HCO3 gradient at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. An additional step, using 1 m NaCl, was required to elute NADPH, which otherwise remained tightly bound to the column. For both reverse phase and anion exchange HPLC, eluates were monitored by UV absorbance at 260 nm and by continuous flow scintillation counting (Packard Radiomatic 500TR). Electrospray MS Analysis of GDP SugarsâElectrospray analysis was performed on an Agilent1100 MSD ion trap instrument (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) by flow injection of the samples with an infusion pump (KD Scientific, New Hope, PA). The reaction mixtures were diluted 1:19 with water to reduce salt concentration; spectra were acquired in the negative ion mode in the mass range of the expected m/z ratios. The ion source parameters were set to obtain optimal signal to noise ratio for molecules of interest (20Miketova P. Schram K.H. Mol. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Monosaccharide Analysis by GC-MSâGDP sugars obtained with the recombinant enzymes were purified by anion exchange chromatography as described above. The GDP-d-rhamnose standard was kindly provided by Dr. Paul Messner, Universitat fuÌr Bodenkultur, Wien, Austria (21Kneidinger B. Graninger M. Adam G. Puchberger M. Kosma P. Zayni S. Messner P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5577-5583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Samples were derivatized according to Henry et al. (22Henry R.J. Blakeney A.B. Harris P.J. Stone B.A. J. Chromatogr. 1983; 256: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and Merkle and Poppe (23Merkle R.K. Poppe I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, the nucleotide sugars were hydrolyzed with 2 N HCl for 90 min at 100 Â°C, dried in a Speed-Vac, and the resulting monosaccharides were reduced to their corresponding alditols with NaBH4 (10 mg/ml in 1 m ammonia solution). The products were acetylated in 1:1 pyridine/acetic anhydride, resuspended in 100 Î¼l of CH2Cl2, and 5-Î¼l aliquots of this solution were injected into an HP 5890 series II gas chromatograph coupled with an HP 5889A engine mass spectrometer equipped with an electron impact ion source (Hewlett Packard). Separation was performed on a S.E.-54 (Alltech) capillary column; the helium gas flow was 45 ml/min. The oven temperature gradient was as follows: initial temperature 80 Â°C, isothermal for 10 min, 80 to 190 Â°C (rate 15 Â°C/min), 190 to 250 Â°C (rate 4 Â°C/min), isothermal to 54 min. The MS analysis was performed in single ion monitoring detection mode (ion 115), monitoring characteristics and specific ions derived from the scan analysis of preliminary MS spectra. To determine the d or l nature of the rhamnose monosaccharide, (S)-octyl glycoside derivatives were obtained from the dried hydrolyzed GDP-rhamnose according to Leontein et al. (24Leontein K. Lindberg B. Lonngren J. Carbohydr. Res. 1978; 62: 359-362Crossref Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Samples were dissolved in (S)-2-octanol and heated at 120 Â°C overnight with a catalytic amount of trifluoroacetic acid. The solution was dried, acetylated, and analyzed as described above. The single ion monitoring chromatograms of the 273 ion corresponding to the d- and l-rhamnose standards were compared with the unknown epimeric form. Expression of PBCV-1 Recombinant GMD and GMER EnzymesâPBCV-1 ORFs A118R (345 amino acids) and A295L (317 amino acids) (accession number U42580 for PBCV-1 genome) encode proteins that resemble GMD and GMER, respectively, from prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Resequencing both genes indicated that the putative GMD sequence was identical to that initially reported, whereas GMER differed at amino acid positions 142 and 143, with AK instead of ER. The nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences have been deposited in GenBankâ¢, accession codes AY225120 for GMD and AY225121 for GMER. No other sequences bearing homology to enzymes involved in the metabolism of nucleotide sugars were detected by either BLAST or TFASTA analyses of the PBCV-1 genome. Recombinant PBCV-1 GMD and GMER proteins with the expected molecular weights were obtained in high yield and good purity (â¼2 mg/liter of initial bacterial culture for GMD and 0.8 mg/liter for GMER) (Fig. 1). The lower yield for GMER resulted from precipitation of the protein during purification. Characterization of PBCV-1 Recombinant GMD and GMER EnzymesâEnzyme assays established that both proteins have the expected catalytic activities. Dehydration of GDP-D-mannose by viral recombinant GMD produced a compound with an identical retention time on reverse phase HPLC (Fig. 2A, peak 2) as the GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose, an intermediate in the GDP-l-fucose biosynthetic pathway, produced by human recombinant GMD (18Bisso A. Sturla L. Zanardi D. De Flora A. Tonetti M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The identity of this compound was confirmed by TLC after NaBH4 reduction, which led to the production of both rhamnose and 6-deoxy-talose (11Tonetti M. Sturla L. Bisso A. Benatti U. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27274-27279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) (not shown), and by electrospray MS, which indicated a m/z of 586.3, consistent with GDP-D-mannose (m/z 604.3) lacking a water molecule (Fig. 3, A and B). GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose (peak 2) incubated with NADPH in the absence of enzyme was stable, thus ruling out any spontaneous chemical reduction of the intermediate (Fig. 2B).Fig. 3Electrospray ionization-MS spectra of nucleotide sugars produced by GMD activity. GDP-d-mannose (A), GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose produced by the dehydratase activity of recombinant GMD (B), and the new compound obtained by GMD in the presence of NADPH (C). The m/z of the GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose is congruent with the loss of a water molecule from GDP-d-mannose. After the NADPH-dependent reduction of the intermediate compound by GMD, the m/z of the new compound is increased by two units, suggesting the reduction of the ketone group on C-4, with the consequent formation of a GDP-6-deoxy-hexose.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Incubation of recombinant GMER with NADPH and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose produced a compound with a retention time identical to GDP-L-fucose (Fig. 2C, peak 3). Electrospray ionization-MS spectra indicated a m/z of 588.4, which is compatible with GDP-L-fucose (not shown). After hydrolysis, this monosaccharide migrated identically to fucose on TLC. Thus, recombinant viral GMER is a catalytically active, bifunctional enzyme with both epimerase and reductase activities (11Tonetti M. Sturla L. Bisso A. Benatti U. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27274-27279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, when GMD was incubated with its substrate GDP-D-mannose and both NADP+ and NADPH, instead of NADP+ alone, an unidentified compound was detected by reverse phase HPLC (Fig. 2D, peak 4). Electrospray MS analysis of this unidentified GMD product indicated a m/z of 588.3, which is consistent with a GDP-6-deoxy-hexose (Fig. 3C). TLC analysis performed after acid hydrolysis (without NaBH4 reduction) of this C14-labeled GMD product indicated a single compound that migrated like the 6-deoxyhexose sugar rhamnose (not shown). This same unidentified compound appeared when purified intermediate GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose was reincubated with GMD and NADPH. Parallel experiments established that formation of the new compound was accompanied by a stoichiometric decrease in NADPH absorbance at 340 nm (not shown). GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose was not converted to any other compounds when GMD or NADPH was omitted from the reaction. These findings indicate that the virus GMD also has a stereospecific NADPH-dependent reductase activity. This activity was confirmed by reconstructing the complete pathway, i.e. by adding GMD and GMER to an incubation mixture containing GDP-D-mannose, NADP+, and NADPH. These conditions produced both GDP-L-fucose (peak 2) and the unknown compound (Fig. 2D, peak 4). The amounts of GDP-L-fucose and the new compound depended on the relative amounts of GMD and GMER (i.e. a high GMER/GMD ratio resulted in more GDP-L-fucose formation and vice versa). To confirm the identity of all the nucleotide sugars formed by GMD and GMER, we developed an anion exchange HPLC procedure that improved separation of the nucleotide sugars (Fig. 4). Spectra analyses indicated that each peak contained a guanine moiety. GC-MS analysis on the monosaccharides, performed after acid hydrolysis of the nucleotide sugars and conversion to the corresponding alditol acetates, confirmed that GMER activity produced GDP-L-fucose (Fig. 5A). GMD reductase activity produced only one compound with the same retention time as rhamnose (Fig. 5B). This finding establishes that GMD also acts stereospecifically on the 4-keto group of the intermediate nucleotide sugar that is generated from GDP-D-mannose. The absolute configuration of rhamnose was determined by a GC-MS procedure that differentiates chiral compounds (23Merkle R.K. Poppe I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The rhamnose produced by the GMD reductase activity had a retention time identical to that of the GDP-D-rhamnose standard (21Kneidinger B. Graninger M. Adam G. Puchberger M. Kosma P. Zayni S. Messner P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5577-5583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5C).Fig. 5GC-MS analysis of the monosaccharides in the GDP-6-deoxy-hexoses produced by GMD and GMER.A and B, the nucleotide sugars were purified by anion exchange chromatography, and the monosaccharides were released by acid hydrolysis, followed by conversion to alditol acetates and GC-MS analysis. Retention times were compared with those of sugar standards: fucose, produced by GMER activity (A), and rhamnose, produced by GMD reductase activity (B). C, rhamnose obtained by GMD reductase activity was derivatized with a chiral compound, (S)-2-octanol. The corresponding (S)-octyl glycoside derivative, analyzed by GC-MS, had the same retention time as the GDP-d-rhamnose standard, indicating that rhamnose synthesized by PBCV-1 GMD has a d configuration.

However, unlike GMDs from other organisms, which are reported to be very unstable, PBCV-1 GMD retains complete activity when stored at either 4 Â°C or â20 Â°C for several weeks. Interestingly, GMD activity decreased about 3-fold if NADP+ was omitted from the reaction; NAD+ was less effective in stimulating the enzyme activity. This finding suggests that, unlike human GMD (18Bisso A. Sturla L. Zanardi D. De Flora A. Tonetti M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), NADP+ is loosely bound to the virus enzyme. GMD reductase activity (510.3 Â± 10.9 Î¼mol/h/mg protein) determined on GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose in the presence of NADPH, was about 10-fold higher than the dehydratase activity. The specific activity of GMER epimerase/reductase activity was 17.9 Â± 0.7 Î¼mol/h/mg protein. Unlike GMD, viral GMER was unstable, exhibiting a significant loss of activity due to precipitation from solution when maintained at both 4 Â°C and â20 Â°C. GMD and GMER Expression in VivoâExpression of PBCV-1 GMD and GMER in virus-infected Chlorella cells was investigated by Northern and Western analyses. Both GMD (A118R) and GMER (A295L) mRNAs were expressed starting at 45 min p.i. and reached a maximum at 60 min p.i (Fig. 6A). The size of the GMD mRNA (â¼1.4 kb) is about the expected size for the 1038-nucleotide-long A118R ORF. In contrast, the size of GMER mRNA (â¼2.2 kb) is about twice the size expected for the 954-nucleotide-long ORF A295L. However, complex mRNA expression patterns are often observed for other PBCV-1 genes (25Schuster A.M. Girton L. Burbank D.E. Van Etten J.L. Virology. 1986; 148: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Because PBCV-1 DNA synthesis begins at 60 â90 min p.i (26Van Etten J.L. Burbank D.E. Joshi J. Meints R.H. Virology. 1984; 134: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), both genes are expressed as early genes. GMD and GMER proteins of the appropriate size first appeared 90 min p.i. and peaked at 180â210 min p.i. (Fig. 6B). Cell extracts were assayed for GMD and GMER activities at various times after PBCV-1 infection. GDP-D-mannose was completely converted to the intermediate compound GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose when the reaction contained NADP+ and no NADPH (Fig. 7A). However, both GDP-D-rhamnose and GDP-L-fucose appeared when NADPH was added to the reaction (Fig. 7B); these sugars result from GMD reductase activity and GMER activity, respectively. The identity of all 14C-labeled compounds was verified by TLC analysis. The relatively higher amount of GDP-D-rhamnose compared with GDP-L-fucose (Fig. 7B) probably results from the intrinsic instability of GMER as noted above for the recombinant GMER. In fact, GMER activity could only be detected immediately after disrupting the cells, whereas its activity disappeared after incubating the cell extracts at 4 Â°C for a few hours or after freezing at â20 Â°C. In contrast, GMD was stable under both conditions. Neither GDP-L-fucose nor GDP-D-rhamnose appeared when GDP-mannose or GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose was incubated with extracts from uninfected cells, either in the presence or absence of NADPH. Thus, the enzymatic activities in extracts from the infected cells proved to result from the virus-encoded enzymes and not from host-encoded enzymes. Degradation of GDP-D-mannose to the monosaccharide form began only after 3 h of incubation (â¼10%) in extracts from healthy cells. The formation of GDP-D-rhamnose and of GDP-L-fucose using cell extracts at various times after virus infection (Table I) correlates with the appearance of GMD and GMER (Fig. 6B).Table IRates of GDP-d-rhamnose and GDP-l-fucose production in Chlorella extracts prepared at different time points after PBCV-1 infectionmin postinfectionnmol/h/mg protein090120180240GDP-D-rhamnoseND6.9 Â± 1.212.3 Â± 0.728.4 Â± 3.110.9 Â± 1.4GDP-L-fucoseNDND1.3 Â± 0.46.3 Â± 0.55.0 Â± 1.2 Open table in a new tab The results presented here demonstrate that Chlorella virus PBCV-1 encodes the genes for two functionally active enzymes involved in GDP-L-fucose biosynthesis. Enzyme activities were detected with recombinant proteins as well as in extracts from virus-infected cells, i.e. both proteins are expressed and function during viral replication in the host. PBCV-1 GMD catalyzes the dehydration of GDP-D-mannose at the C-4 and -6 positions to form the intermediate metabolite GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose (Fig. 8). The virus GMER behaves as a bifunctional enzyme, with an epimerization activity that leads to a change in the sugar configuration, followed by the NADPH-dependent reduction of the 4-keto group of the intermediate to form GDP-L-fucose. These GMD and GMER activities are identical to those of GMD and GMER enzymes from prokaryotes, plants, and animals (11Tonetti M. Sturla L. Bisso A. Benatti U. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27274-27279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 12Sturla L. Bisso A. Zanardi D. Benatti U. De Flora A. Tonetti M.

However, the virus GMD has an additional unexpected NADPH-dependent, stereo-specific reductase activity on the 4-keto group of the intermediate. This activity creates another nucleotide sugar, GDP-D-rhamnose (Fig. 8). This novel activity indicates that PBCV-1 GMD is a bifunctional enzyme. GMDs from other organisms lack this reductase activity, with the exception of a GMD from Aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus (21Kneidinger B. Graninger M. Adam G. Puchberger M. Kosma P. Zayni S. Messner P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5577-5583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, in this latter case the reductase activity only occurred with recombinant His- or glutathione S-transferase-tagged GMD and only small amounts of GDP-D-rhamnose appeared. Accordingly, the reductase activity observed with the A. thermoaerophilus enzyme may not occur in vivo. In fact, the bacterium has another enzyme, GDP-deoxy-D-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase (RMD), for GDP-D-rhamnose production (21Kneidinger B. Graninger M. Adam G. Puchberger M. Kosma P. Zayni S. Messner P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5577-5583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast, GDP-D-rhamnose is formed in vivo after PBCV-1 infection, indicating that GMD reductase activity occurs with wild type enzyme and the activity is not an artifact of the recombinant enzyme (e.g. because of incorrect protein folding). The possibility that GDP-D-rhamnose arose in vivo by another enzyme activity encoded by the virus is excluded because no recognizable RMD homologs exist in the PBCV-1 genome. Moreover, the high reductase activity observed with both wild type and recombinant GMD, as well as its kinetic properties 2M. Tonetti, L. Sturla, J. L. Van Etten, manuscript in preparation. suggest that GDP-D-rhamnose production by GMD is physiologically relevant. Because both fucose and rhamnose are components of the glycan portion of PBCV-1 major capsid protein Vp54 (4Wang I.N. Li Y. Que Q. Bhattacharya M. Lane L.C. Chaney W.G. Van Etten J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3840-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the viral GMD and GMER enzymes may be necessary to provide the virus with the appropriate nucleotide sugars. Indeed GDP-D-mannose metabolizing activities leading to GDP-D-rhamnose and GDP-L-fucose were not detected in extracts from uninfected cells. However, rhamnose and trace amounts of fucose are among the seven neutral sugars in uninfected Chlorella NC64A cell walls (27Meints R.H. Burbank D.E. Van Etten J.L. Lamport D.T.A. Virology. 1988; 164: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Presumably the host is unable to supply enough of these two monosaccharides for virus production. To summarize, the results in this report have three unique aspects. (i) This is the first report of a virus encoding enzymes involved in the synthesis of nucleotide sugars. (ii) Unlike GMD enzymes from other organisms, the virus-encoded GMD is a bifunctional enzyme. (iii) Unlike GMD enzymes from other organisms, the virus recombinant GMD is very stable. We thank Dr. Mike Nelson for his enthusiasm in helping to initiate this project. We are indebted to Dr. Paul Messner for kindly providing the GDP-d-rhamnose standard."
https://openalex.org/W2144053462,"Inhibition of angiogenesis-promoting factors such as fibroblast growth factors is considered to be a potential procedure for inhibiting solid tumor growth. Although several peptide-based inhibitors are currently under study, the development of antiangiogenic compounds of small molecular size is a pharmacological goal of considerable interest. We have already shown that certain naphthalene sulfonates constitute minimal functional substitutes of the antiangiogenic compounds of the suramin and suradista family. Using those data as a lead, we have carried out a rational search for new angiogenesis inhibitors that could provide new pharmacological insights for the development of antiangiogenic treatments. The results of the study strongly underline the relevance of the stereochemistry for an efficient inhibition of acidic fibroblast growth factor mitogenic activity by the naphthalene sulfonate family and allow us to formulate rules to aid in searching for new inhibitors and pharmaceutical developments. To provide further leads for such developments and acquire a detailed insight into the basis of the inhibitory activity of the naphthalene sulfonate derivatives, we solved the three-dimensional structure of acidic fibroblast growth factor complexed to 5-amino-2-naphthalenesulfonate, the most pharmacologically promising of the identified inhibitors. The structure shows that binding of this compound would hamper the interaction of acidic fibroblast growth factor with the different components of the cell membrane mitogenesis-triggering complex.

The development and maintenance of blood vessel networks for the supply and withdrawal of metabolites is a critical event in the development of solid tumors when they reach a critical size (1Yancopoulos G.D. Davis S. Gale N.W. Rudge J.S. Wiegand S.J. Holash J. Nature. 2000; 407: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar). In addition, these vascular networks strongly contribute to the dissemination of malignant cells to distant sites (2Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (7603) Google Scholar). Inhibition of angiogenesis was proposed as a strategy for the treatment of tumors about three decades ago (3Folkman J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1971; 285: 1182-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This now commonly accepted idea is at the forefront of one of the most promising fields in cancer research, i.e. the blockage of angiogenesis-promoting factors (2Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (7603) Google Scholar, 4Rak J. Yu J.L. Kerbel R.S. Coomber B.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1931-1934PubMed Google Scholar). At present there are more than 20 antiangiogenic agents in different stages of clinical development for oncology (5Kruger E.A. Duray P.H. Price D.K. Pluda J.M. Figg W.D. Semina. Oncol. 2001; 28: 570-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), a considerable number of which are polypeptides that the organism uses to counterbalance the effect of the positive angiogenesis regulators (6Hagedorn M. Bikfalvi A. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2000; 34: 89-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (aFGF and bFGF) 1The abbreviations used are: aFGF, acidic FGF; bFGF, basic FGF; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; NTS, 1,3,6-naphthalenetrisulfonate; NMS, naphthalene monosulfonate. are two very important angiogenesis-promoting polypeptides. They belong to a family of mitogens that to date includes 23 polypeptides (7The ADHR Consortium Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar, 8Yamashita T. Yoshioka M. Itoh N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The two members of the group that were first described are aFGF and bFGF. They have very similar biochemical and biological properties and have served as paradigms for the whole family (9Baird A. BoÌhlen P. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 95. Springer, Berli1990: 369-418Google Scholar, 10GimeÌnez-Gallego G. Cuevas P. Neurolog. Res. 1994; 16: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). FGFs are often detected in tumors (11Folkman J. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1987; 235: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (4061) Google Scholar, 12Hayek A. Culler F.L. Beattie G.M. Lopez A.D. Cuevas P. Baird A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Histological studies have shown that the growth of solid tumors is suppressed by monoclonal antibodies against bFGF and that this effect was due to the inhibition of bFGF-induced angiogenesis (13Hori A. Sasada R. Matsutani E. Naito K. Sakura Y. Fujita T. Kozai Y. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6180-6184PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that antisense targeting of bFGF and FGF receptor-1 in human melanomas blocks intratumoral angiogenesis and tumor growth (14Wang Y. Becker D. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Finally, angiogenesis promoted by another well characterized inducer of blood vessel development, the vascular endothelial growth factor, has been reported to require endogenous expression of bFGF by endothelial cells, and it is therefore blocked by neutralizing antibodies against bFGF (15Jonca F. Ortega N. Gleizes P.E. Bertrand N. Plouet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24203-24209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Mandriota S.J. Pepper M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2293-2302PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, inhibition of FGF mitogenic activity seems a crucial target for the development of antiangiogenic cancer treatments. FGFs show a characteristically high affinity for the glycosaminoglycan heparin and the glycosidic moiety of heparan sulfate proteoglycan (9Baird A. BoÌhlen P. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 95. Springer, Berli1990: 369-418Google Scholar, 10GimeÌnez-Gallego G. Cuevas P. Neurolog. Res. 1994; 16: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 17Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that binding to either of these polysulfates is required for FGFs to recognize their specific tyrosine kinase receptor on the cell surface (18Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 19Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5346-5350Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). In the case of aFGF-driven mitogenesis, the presence of either heparin or some specific polyanions like myo-inositol hexasulfate is, in addition, a nearly absolute requirement (21GimeÌnez-Gallego G. Con G. Hatcher V.B. Thomas K.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22Pineda-Lucena A. JimeÌnez M.A. Nieto J.L. Santoro J. Rico M. GimeÌnez-Gallego G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 81-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, disruption of the interaction of FGFs with heparin and heparan sulfates seems an obvious target for antiangiogenesis. The polysulfonated binaphthyl ureas known as suramins are considered potential anti-cancer agents because of their anti-angiogenic activity (23Manetti F. Corelli F. Botta M. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2000; 6: 1897-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The antiangiogenic activity of suramins is based, at least in part, on their ability to disrupt the interaction of many growth factors with their membrane receptors, such as in the case of FGFs and their tyrosine kinase receptors (19Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5346-5350Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 24Gagliardi A. Kassack M. Kreimeyer A. Muller G. Nickel P. Collins D.C. Cancer Chemother.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2654-2660PubMed Google Scholar). Because it has been shown that heparin disrupts aFGFÂ·suramin complexes (27Middaugh C.R. Mach H. Burke C.J. Volkin D.B. Dabora J.M. Tsai P.K. Bruner M.W. Ryan J.A. Marfia K.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9016-9024Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and counteracts the antiangiogenic effect of these polysulfonated ureas (25Pesenti E. Sola F. Mongelli N. Grandi M. Spreafico F. Brit. J. Cancer. 1992; 66: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 26Takano S. Gately S. Neville M.E. Herblin W.F. Gross J.L. Engelhard H. Perricone M. Eidsvoog K. Brem S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2654-2660PubMed Google Scholar), suramins are considered to act by blocking the heparin-binding sites of FGFs (28Stein C.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2239-2248PubMed Google Scholar). Another group of antiangiogenic and anti-tumoral compounds is comprised by suradistas, a type of non-cytotoxic synthetic binaphthalene sulfonic distamycin-A derivatives. These compounds tightly interact with FGFs, inhibit the binding of these polypeptides to the tyrosine kinase cell membrane receptors, and suppress FGF-induced angiogenesis and neovascularization in vivo (29Mariani M. Paio A. Ciomei M. Pastori W. Franzetti C. Melegaro G. Grandi M. Mongelli N. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 61: 455-458Google Scholar, 30Ciomei M. Pastori W. Mariani M. Sola F. Grandi M. Mongelli N.

Res. 1997; 7: 36-44Google Scholar), probably by a mechanism similar to that of the suramins. Despite the potential relevance of the suramins and the suradistas as inhibitors of the FGF angiogenic activity, no high resolution data of their complexes with these polypeptides are available so far. Knowledge of the molecular structure of these complexes could be used to improve their pharmacological properties and lead to the design of better angiogenesis inhibitors. A major reason for the lack of data is that these two inhibitors promote the appearance of heterogeneous aggregates of the complexes (23Manetti F. Corelli F. Botta M. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2000; 6: 1897-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Middaugh C.R. Mach H. Burke C.J. Volkin D.B. Dabora J.M. Tsai P.K. Bruner M.W. Ryan J.A. Marfia K.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9016-9024Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Of outstanding interest was the finding that 1,3,6-naphthalenetrisulfonate (NTS) constitutes a minimal model for the inhibition of aFGF mitogenic activity by suramins and suradistas (32Lozano R.M. JimeÌnez M. Santoro J. Rico M. GimeÌnez-Gallego G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 899-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover NTS has been tested with positive results both in vitro and in vivo as an inhibitor of aFGF-induced angiogenesis and glioma proliferation (32Lozano R.M. JimeÌnez M. Santoro J. Rico M. GimeÌnez-Gallego G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 899-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 33Cuevas P. Lozano R.M. GimeÌnez-Gallego G. Neurol. Res. 1999; 21: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 34Cuevas P. Carceller F. Reimers D. Cuevas B. Lozano R.M. GimeÌnez-Gallego G. Neurol.

Lett. 1999; 275: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This suggests potential new avenues for the development of new antiangiogenic compounds. The three-dimensional structure of aFGF complexed with NTS obtained by 1H NMR showed that NTS binds weakly and quite heterogeneously to the heparin-binding site of aFGF, in agreement with its low binding constant (32Lozano R.M. JimeÌnez M. Santoro J. Rico M. GimeÌnez-Gallego G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 899-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The studies of Lozano et al. (32Lozano R.M. JimeÌnez M. Santoro J. Rico M. GimeÌnez-Gallego G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 899-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) also showed that naphthalene derivatives containing a reduced number of sulfonate groups per aromatic ring seem to act as better inhibitors of aFGF mitogenic activity than NTS. However, this enhancement was accompanied by the appearance of a clear toxicity of the compounds against quiescent cells at concentrations where they inhibit aFGF mitogenic activity. Based on these preliminary data, we have explored a wide window of charge, size, and relative position of substituents of the naphthalene ring in an attempt to identify new naphthalene derivatives that combine the highest inhibitory activity with the lowest toxicity. In a further step, the most pharmacologically promising of those compounds, 5-amino-2-naphthalenesulfonate, was evaluated for its antiangiogenic activity in vivo with positive results, and the three-dimensional structure of its complex with aFGF was solved by x-ray crystallography to a resolution of 2.0 AÌ. All of these studies allow formulation of a set of stereochemical rules that may constitute the basis for the development of new antiangiogenesis treatments. A complete list of all of the compounds used in the study reported here is shown in Table I, and their formulas are provided in the supplemental data. All of the reactions were performed in dry flasks fitted with glass stopper or rubber septa under argon, unless otherwise noted. Air- and moisture-sensitive liquid reagents were transferred via syringe or stainless steel cannula. Flash column chromatography was performed employing 230â400 mesh silica gel. Thin layer chromatography was conducted in Kiesel gel 60 F254 (Merck). Detection was first by UV (254 nm) and then by charring with a solution of 20% aqueous sulfuric acid (200 ml) in acetic acid (800 ml). Anhydrous MgSO4 or Na2SO4 was used to dry the organic solutions during work-ups, and the removal of the solvents was carried out under vacuum with a rotary evaporator. Unless otherwise noted, the materials were obtained from commercially available sources and used without further purification. Compounds prepared in our lab have had their structures and purity confirmed by NMR. The solvents were dried and purified using standard methods. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in D2O.

Evaporation of the solvents yielded the sodium salts. Acetyl Amide Derivatives (C-4, C-10, C-15, and C-19)âAcetyl amides were prepared by heating a suspension of the corresponding sodium sulfonate salts in acetic anhydride for 4 h at 90 Â°C. The solvent was evaporated, yielding the acetyl amide derivatives. Benzoyl Amide Derivatives (C-5, C-11, and C-16)âA slight excess of benzoyl chloride (1.2 equivalents) was added to a solution of the corresponding sulfonic acid in pyridine. The solvent was evaporated after 30 min, and the residue was chromatographed on a silica gel column (MeOH:CH2Cl2, 1:9 v/v). The purified product was transformed in its corresponding sodium salt (see above). Compound C-2âConcentrated H2SO4 (0.32 ml) was added to 2-methyl-naphtalene (2.8 mmol). The mixture was heated in an oil bath at 80 Â°C for 3 h. This solution was cooled, poured over ice, and made basic by the addition of 1 n NaOH. The product was separated in cold and isolated by filtration. Compound C-8 âIon-exchange resin (Amberlite) (H+ form) was added to a solution of sodium 2-naphthalenesulfonate in methanol. The mixture was stirred overnight and filtered, and the solvent was evaporated. The residue was lyophilized and yields the acid. Compound C-12âExcess of phthalic anhydride (1.3 equivalents) was added to a solution of C-9 (0.6 mmol) in methanol. The mixture was stirred overnight and evaporated. The residue was chromatographed on silica gel column (MeOH:CH2Cl2, 3:7 v/v) to yield the required product. Compound C-13âAdipoyl chloride (0.5 equivalents) was added to a suspension of C-9 (1.0 mmol) in pyridine. Stirring was continued for 48 h, and the solvent was evaporated. The residue was digested with a small volume of methanol, and the solid that separated was collected and characterized. Compound C-25âGramine (6.45 mmol) was dissolved in concentrated H2SO4 (10 ml) and stirred for 5 min at 0 Â°C. This solution was poured over ice and made basic by the addition of 1 n NaOH. This aqueous solution was extracted with dichloromethane, made neutral by addition of 1 n H2SO4, and evaporated. The residue was digested with hot ethanol, and the solids were separated by filtration. The ethanol solution was evaporated, and the residue was subjected to column chromatography (ethanol) to yield the desired compound. The effect of the compounds listed on Table I on aFGF-driven mitogenesis and quiescent cell viability was studied in vitro as described by Lozano et al. (32Lozano R.M. JimeÌnez M. Santoro J. Rico M. GimeÌnez-Gallego G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 899-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) using 100-Î¼l cultures of plated fibroblasts Balb/c 3T3. The concentration of aFGF used in the assays (0.32 ng/ml) correspond to that eliciting a half-maximum mitogenic response at myo-inositol hexasulfate concentrations that induce a nearly full activation of the mitogen (20 Î¼g/ml; 32). The inhibitors and, when pertinent, aFGF were added in 10 Î¼l of a solution containing myo-inositol hexasulfate (200 Î¼g/ml), bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, once the cultures have reached quiescence (15 h after being transferred to minimal culture medium). Pathogen-free C57/BI/6 mice (Charles River) weighing 25 Â± 4 g were used. The animals were housed in plastic cages in temperature- and humidity-controlled conditions; food and water were available ad libitum, and a 12-h light/dark schedule was maintained. The animal welfare guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and the European Union were carefully followed. Sterile gelatin sponge cubes of 10 mm3 (Curaspon Dental, Clinimed Holding, Zwanenburg, The Netherlands) were implanted subcutaneously in the backs of the mice after induction of intraperitoneal anesthesia as described (33Cuevas P. Lozano R.M. GimeÌnez-Gallego G. Neurol. Res. 1999; 21: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The animals were distributed as follows: Group A (n = 10) sponges loaded with 200 Î¼l of phosphate-buffered saline containing 29 Î¼gÂ·ml-1 heparin; Group B (n = 40) sponges were embedded with the same solution containing 10 Î¼gÂ·ml-1 aFGF. After implantation of the sponge into the subcutaneous pouch, the skin was sutured. The mice of Group B were randomly divided in four groups (n = 10) that received 0.008, 0.08, 0.8, and 8 mgÂ·kg-1 of 5-amino-2-NMS, respectively, in an intraperitoneal injection of 200 Î¼l of phosphate-buffered saline, 24 h after surgery (25Pesenti E. Sola F. Mongelli N. Grandi M. Spreafico F. Brit. J. Cancer. 1992; 66: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 33Cuevas P. Lozano R.M. GimeÌnez-Gallego G. Neurol. Res. 1999; 21: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). All procedures were performed under sterile conditions. For angiogenesis evaluation, the mice were re-anesthetized as described, and the sponges were surgically extracted and treated for histological studies as described by Cuevas et al. (33Cuevas P. Lozano R.M. GimeÌnez-Gallego G. Neurol. Res. 1999; 21: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) 7 days after the implants. Neovascularization was quantified with computerized morphometric software connected to a microscope. Ingrowths of neovessels into sponges was assessed by measuring surface area with erythrocyte content. Neovascularization was analyzed in four predetermined visual fields in three different sections at 10-fold magnification. The statistical analyses were performed by using Student's t test. The protein was obtained using established protocols (22Pineda-Lucena A. JimeÌnez M.A. Nieto J.L. Santoro J. Rico M. GimeÌnez-Gallego G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 81-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The residues are numbered according to their positions in the primary structure of the 154-amino acid aFGF (36Zazo M. Lozano R.M. Ortega S. Varela J. DiÌaz-Orejas R. RamiÌrez J.M. GimeÌnez-Gallego G. Gene. 1992; 113: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Crystals of the complex between aFGF and either 5-amino-2-NMS or NTS were grown using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 295 K by mixing 0.75 mm protein, 1.5 mm of the inhibitor and 60% sodium/potassium tartrate buffered with 5 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.85) over a well solution of 1.3 m Li2SO4. The typical crystal size achieved after â¼1 month was about 0.7 Ã 0.5 Ã 0.2 mm. To corroborate the presence of the inhibitor inside the crystals, several crystal specimens were washed using the crystallization buffer, solubilized with 1 n NaOH, and subjected to electrospray mass spectrometry. The mass spectra were recorded on a liquid chromatography coupled mass spectroscopy HP 1100 spectrometer using electrospray ionization. For the diffraction experiments, the crystals were cryo-cooled in a stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K using the crystallization solution supplemented with 20% glycerol as cryo-protectant. X-rays from a synchrotron source at Beamline X11-DESY (Hamburg, Germany) were employed to collect data on a Marccd detector. Diffraction was visible to 1.8 AÌ, but only data to 2.0 AÌ were suitable for subsequent processing with MOSFLM (37Leslie A.G.W. Moras D. Podjarny A.D. Thierry J.C. Crystallographic Computing. 5. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 27-38Google Scholar) and programs of the CCP4 suite (38P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19824) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the monoclinic system, space group P2 (a = 96.5 AÌ, b = 47.2 AÌ, c = 97.8 AÌ, Î² = 107.0Â°), with six protein molecules/asymmetric unit corresponding to a 48% solvent content. The calculated VM value (39Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7935) Google Scholar) is 2.4 AÌ3/Da. The structure was determined by molecular replacement using AMoRe (40Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5031) Google Scholar). The searching model was the one derived from 2axm (41DiGabriele A.D. Lax I. Chen D.I. Svahn C.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 812-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), with one molecule searched six times at 3.5 AÌ resolution. The positions of the six molecules in the asymmetric unit were optimized using rigid body refinement, leading to an R value of 44.9 (Rfree = 45.2). Inspection of the initial sigma-A maps showed that certain side chains were quite disordered, although some electron density was obvious. This problem was overcome by use of noncrystallographic symmetry restraints. Several steps of simulated annealing and B factor refinement were carried out with CNS (42BruÌnger A.T. Adams P.D.

Bulk solvent and anisotropic overall B factor corrections were applied through the refinement.

Inhibition of aFGF Mitogenic Activity by Naphthalene SulfonatesâTo single out new naphthalene sulfonate derivatives with better potential pharmacological profiles as angiogenic inhibitors than naphthalene trisulfonate (32Lozano R.M. JimeÌnez M. Santoro J. Rico M. GimeÌnez-Gallego G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 899-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), a rational search, by iterative trial-and-error, of the best functional group substitutions was carried out. Two starting compounds were initially used in this search: 1-naphthalene monosulfonate (1-NMS) and 2-naphthalene monosulfonate (2-NMS). 1-NMS inhibits aFGF mitogenic activity at lower concentrations than naphthalene trisulfonate (32Lozano R.M. JimeÌnez M. Santoro J. Rico M. GimeÌnez-Gallego G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 899-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), but it becomes toxic for quiescent fibroblasts at the highest concentrations required to reach a substantial inhibition aFGF mitogenic activity (32Lozano R.M. JimeÌnez M. Santoro J. Rico M. GimeÌnez-Gallego G. J. Mol.

The search space was later widened to other sulfonate-derivatized aromatic compounds. A complete list of all tested compounds is shown in Table I, and their formulas are provided in the supplemental data. The whole series of tested compounds covers a wide range of specific inhibitory activities illustrated in Fig. 1a, despite the sometimes significant similarities in chemical composition.

https://openalex.org/W2166007843,"Studies of mucins suggest that the structural effects of O-glycans are restricted to steric interactions between peptide-linked GalNAc residues and adjacent polypeptide residues. It has been proposed, however, that differential O-glycan sialylation alters the structure of the stalk-like region of the T cell co-receptor, CD8, and that this, in turn, modulates ligand binding (Daniels, M. A., Devine, L., Miller, J. D., Moser, J. M., Lukacher, A. E., Altman, J. D., Kavathas, P., Hogquist, K. A., and Jameson, S. C. (2001) Immunity 15, 1051â1061; Moody, A. M., Chui, D., Reche, P. A., Priatel, J. J., Marth, J. D., and Reinherz, E. L. (2001) Cell 107, 501â512). We characterize the glycosylation of soluble, chimeric forms of the Î±Î±- and Î±Î²-isoforms of murine CD8 containing the O-glycosylated stalk of rat CD8Î±Î±, and we show that the stalk O-glycans are differentially sialylated in CHO K1 versus Lec3.2.8.1 cells (82 versus â¼6%, respectively). Sedimentation analysis indicates that the Perrin functions, P exp, which reflect overall molecular shape, are very similar (1.61 versus 1.54), whereas the sedimentation coefficients (s) of the CHO K1- and Lec3.2.8.1-derived proteins differ considerably (3.73 versus 3.13 S). The hydrodynamic properties of molecular models also strongly imply that the sialylated and non-sialylated forms of the chimera have parallel, equally highly extended stalks (â¼2.6 AÌ/residue). Our analysis indicates that, as in the case of mucins, the overall structure of O-glycosylated stalk-like peptides is sialylation-independent and that the functional effects of differential CD8 O-glycan sialylation need careful interpretation.

CD8 is required by mature T cells restricted to recognizing foreign antigenic determinants (peptides) complexed with class I MHC antigens (MHCp), whereas CD4 is involved in MHC class II-restricted T cell responses (1Swain S.L. Immunol. Rev. 1983; 74: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Because CD8 and CD4 are believed to interact with the same MHCp complex as the TCR (2Parnes J.R. von Hoegen P. Miceli M.C. Zamoyska R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 649-655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these proteins are commonly referred to as T cell co-receptors. CD8 is a glycoprotein consisting of disulfide-linked subunits, Î± and Î², which are encoded by two closely linked genes near the immunoglobulin Îº locus (3Sukhatme V.P. Vollmer A.C. Erikson J. Isobe M. Croce C. Parnes J.R. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 161: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Despite sharing relatively low sequence similarity (â¼20%), the CD8 subunits are structurally related and predicted to have identical topologies (4Norment A.M. Littman D.R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3433-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Each chain consists of an extracellular immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) V-set domain attached to hydrophobic transmembrane sequences and short cytoplasmic tails via extended, disulfide-linked stalk-like peptides of 48â51 (Î±-chain) or 37â42 (Î²-chain) residues (reviewed by Gao et al. (5Gao G.F. Rao Z. Bell J.I. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 408-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar)). The IgSF domains in CD8 exhibit highly variable N-linked glycosylation; in humans, only a single site on the Î²-chain is glycosylated, whereas in mice the Î±- and Î²-chains have three and one sites, respectively. The ratio seen in the mouse is reversed for rat CD8. In all species, the stalk-like region of each chain is rich in proline, serine, and threonine residues and is O-glycosylated. Amino acid sequencing of rat CD8Î± has indicated that the four threonine residues 122, 126, 132, and 134 clustered at the membrane-distal end of the stalk are occupied with O-glycans (6Classon B.J. Brown M.H. Garnett D. Somoza C. Barclay A.N. Willis A.C. Williams A.F. Int. Immunol. 1992; 4: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of CD8Î± is attached to the tyrosine kinase p56lck (reviewed in Ref. 7Rudd C.E. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 400-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Most T cells express CD8 as an Î±Î² heterodimer, although a homodimeric form (CD8Î±Î±) is found on subsets of intraepithelial T lymphocytes of the gut, Î³Î´ T cells, NK cells, and lymphoid-related dendritic cells (reviewed by Zamoyska (8Zamoyska R. Immunity. 1994; 1: 243-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)). CD8Î±Î± and CD8Î±Î² T cells undergo different pathways of selection, perhaps reflecting an underlying functional specialization within the CD8 T cell population (9Rocha B. Vassalli P. Guy-Grand D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The interaction between CD8Î±Î± and class I MHCp ligands was initially investigated using cell adhesion assays (10Norment A.M. Salter R.D. Parham P. Engelhard V.H. Littman D.R. Nature. 1988; 336: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). More recently, the affinities and kinetics of the interaction of soluble forms of human and mouse CD8Î±Î± with human and mouse class I MHC, respectively (11Wyer J.R. Willcox B.E. Gao G.F. Gerth U.C. Davis S.J. Bell J.I. van der Merwe P.A. Immunity. 1999; 10: 219-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 12Kern P. Hussey R.E. Spoerl R. Reinherz E.L. Chang H.C. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5659-5667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), have been determined using surface plasmon resonance-based methods. In both cases, the interactions were shown to have extraordinarily low affinities and extremely rapid dissociation kinetics. Crystallographic analyses of the complexes of CD8Î±Î±/class I MHCp from humans and mice (14Gao G.F. Tormo J. Gerth U.C. Wyer J.R. McMichael A.J. Stuart D.I. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y. Jakobsen B.K.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 519-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) indicate that CD8 binds the membrane-proximal Î±2 and Î±3 domains of MHCp and makes additional contacts with Î²2-microglobulin. An analogous interaction was revealed by the crystal structure of the complex of human CD4 domains 1 and 2, and murine MHC class II (16Wang J.H. Meijers R. Xiong Y. Liu J.H. Sakihama T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Reinherz E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10799-10804Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), insofar as CD4 binds a membrane-proximal cavity formed by residues from both the Î±2 and Î²2 domains of class II. It has been proposed that the weak interactions between the TCR and MHCp may be enhanced by simultaneous interactions involving CD8 (17Garcia K.C. Scott C.A. Brunmark A. Carbone F.R. Peterson P.A. Wilson I.A. Teyton L. Nature. 1996; 384: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). However, CD8 interactions are generally at least 10-fold weaker than those involving the TCR, and CD4 interactions are possibly even weaker. Therefore, although they will contribute somewhat to the overall interaction, it seems more likely that the key function of the co-receptors is to recruit sufficient p56lck to pre-formed TCRÂ·MHCp complexes to consolidate the early signaling response (11Wyer J.R.

An additional level of complexity regarding these interactions arises from the recent suggestion that ligand binding by CD8 is regulated in vivo by changes in its O-glycosylation. Specifically, Moody et al. (18Moody A.M. Chui D. Reche P.A. Priatel J.J. Marth J.D. Reinherz E.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and Daniels et al. (19Daniels M.A. Devine L. Miller J.D. Moser J.M. Lukacher A.E. Altman J.D. Kavathas P.

To account for this effect, sialylation-induced changes in the structural properties of the stalk, either involving electrostatic repulsion between the two chains (18Moody A.M. Chui D. Reche P.A.

As has already been noted (20Baum L.G.

In the present study, we test the second proposed mechanism, i.e. that O-glycan sialylation modulates the extension of the stalk-like region of CD8. Our findings suggest that sialylation has little, if any, effect on the overall structure of CD8. Chemicals and ReagentsâAnhydrous hydrazine was prepared by distillation from reagent-grade hydrazine (Pierce, catalog number 21515-1) mixed with calcium oxide and toluene. Reagents for automated hydrazinolysis were from Oxford GlycoSciences (Abingdon, UK). Chromatography (grade 3MM) paper was from Whatman. Acetonitrile and methanol were from Riedel-de-HaeÌn (Sigma). All other chemicals were AnalaR-grade from Sigma. EnzymesâSequencing-grade exoglycosidase and peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGaseF, EC 3.5.1.52) enzymes were obtained from Glyko Ltd.

Dwek R.A. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 285-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using the buffers provided by the enzyme manufacturers. When enzyme arrays were used, the buffer was 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5. Exoglycosidases were used at the following concentrations. Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase (EC 3.2.1.18), 1â2 units/ml; almond meal Î±-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.111), 3 milliunits/ml; bovine testes Î²-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23), 1â2 units/ml; Streptococcus pneumoniae Î²-hexosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.30), 120 units/ml; and jack bean Î±-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.24), 100 milliunits/ml. Preparation of sCD8Î±Î± and sCD8abâFour recombinant soluble forms of CD8 were prepared as described previously (22Pellicci D.G. Kortt A.A. Sparrow L.G. Hudson P.J. Sorensen H.V. Davis S.J. Classon B.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 246: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Briefly, sCD8Î±Î² was produced by co-expressing sCD8Î± with sCD8Î² constructs (Fig. 1) in both Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 cells (referred to as sCD8Î±Î±K1 and sCD8Î±Î²K1) and the mutant CHO cell line Lec3.2.8.1 (referred to as sCD8Î±Î±Lec and sCD8Î±Î²Lec). The sCD8Î±Î² was purified to homogeneity by OX-8 affinity and/or ion-exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration and the sCD8Î±Î± by immunoaffinity chromatography on an antibody (OX-8) column. For ultracentrifugation-based structural comparisons with these mammalian cell-expressed forms of murine CD8, Escherichia coli-expressed unglycosylated human sCD8Î±Î± consisting of residues 1â120 of the mature protein, referred to here as sCD8Î±Î±E, was prepared as described in detail elsewhere (23Gao G.F.

Hydrazine Release, Re-N-acetylation, and Labeling of N- and O-GlycansâApproximately 50 Î¼g of each protein was dialyzed against 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and then lyophilized. N-Glycans were released by hydrazine at 95 Â°C (N * mode) and purified using a GlycoPrep 1000 (Oxford GlycoSciences Ltd., Abingdon, UK). These hydrazinolysis conditions represent a compromise between achieving non-selective release, maximizing yield, and minimizing released sugar degradation (24Patel T. Bruce J. Merry A. Bigge C.

For in-gel release of the glycans, the Î±- and Î²-chains of CHO K1 sCD8 were separated on a one-dimensional SDS-PAGE gel that was stained with Coomassie Blue. The N-linked glycans were released from gel slices by incubation with PNGaseF as described previously (27Kuster B. Wheeler S.F. Hunter A.P. Dwek R.A. Harvey D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 82-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Labeling and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)â Fluorescent labeling with 2-aminobenzamide (2-AB) was performed as described by Bigge et al. (28Bigge J.C. Patel T.P. Bruce J.A.

Hart at the Oxford Glycobiology Institute. Simultaneous Exoglycosidase Sequencing of the Released Glycan PoolâExogylcosidase sequencing was performed as described previously (31Rudd P.M. Guile G.R.

Normal phase HPLC separations (NP-HPLC) were performed on a GlycoSepÂ®-N chromatography column (Glyko Ltd.) using low salt conditions, and structures were assigned as described previously (29Guile G.R.

Trypsin Digestionâ50 Î¼g of each sample (sCD8Î±Î±K1 and sCD8Î±Î±Lec) was dissolved in 200 Î¼l of 6 m guanidine HCl, 0.5 m Tris, pH 8.0, with 3 Î¼l of 0.5 m dithiothreitol and reduced by incubation at 37 Â°C for 2 h. The sample was then alkylated by addition of 3 Î¼l of 4-vinylpyridine and incubated for a further 1.5 h in the dark at 37 Â°C and then dialyzed against 50 mm NH4HCO3. Samples were dried, then resuspended in 40 Î¼l of trypsin solution (1.25 Î¼g/ml in 25 mm NH4HCO3 10% acetonitrile), and incubated overnight at 37 Â°C. Peptides were extracted with a C18 ZipTip (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and analyzed directly by MALDI mass spectrometry. A fifth of each sample was desialylated with A. ureafaciens sialidase, and the glycopeptides were analyzed by MALDI after extraction with a C18 ZipTip. MALDI Mass Spectrometry of GlycopeptidesâSamples were purified using C18 ZipTips (Millipore, Bedford, MA) prior to analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (33Harvey D.J. Rudd P.M. Bateman R.H. Bordoli R.S. Howes K. Hoyes J.B. Vickers R.G. Org. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 29: 753-766Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Positive ion MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded with a Micromass TOFSpec 2E reflectron-TOF mass spectrometer (Micromass Ltd., Atlas Park, Simonsway, Manchester, UK) fitted with delayed extraction and a nitrogen laser (337 nm). The extraction voltage was 20 kV; the pulse voltage was 3200 V, and the delay was 500 ns. Samples were prepared by mixing 0.3 Î¼l of the solution of tryptic peptides and glycopeptides on the MALDI target together with the matrix solution (0.3 Î¼l from a solution of Î±-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml) in 7:3 (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and allowing it to dry at room temperature. The resulting molecular weights were used to search the sequence data base maintained at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg, Germany. MALDI Mass Spectrometry of Released GlycansâUnderivatized, released glycans were purified using a Nafion 117 membrane (Aldrich) and examined by MALDI mass spectrometry with the TOFSpec instrument in positive ion reflectron mode. Samples (0.3 Î¼l in water) were mixed with a saturated solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid on the MALDI target and allowed to dry at room temperature. The sample was then recrystallized from ethanol. Operating conditions for the mass spectrometer are as follows: extraction voltage, 20 kV; pulse voltage, 3200 V. The instrument was calibrated with dextran oligomers. Monoisotopic masses of the [M + Na]+ ions are listed in Tables I and II; all masses were within 0.1 mass unit of the calculated values.Table IAnalysis of N-glycans of sCD8Î±Î± expressed in CHO K1 cells The N-glycan pool from sCD8Î±Î±K1 was subjected to exoglycosidase sequencing and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, as described under âExperimental Procedures,â to derive the structures shown. The relative abundance was calculated from the fluorescence intensities of the peaks from the NP-HPLC analysis (Fig. 2a, top panel).Table IIAnalysis of N-glycans of sCD8Î±Î± expressed in Lec3.2.8.1 cells The N-glycan pool from sCD8Î±Î±Lec was subjected to exoglycosidase sequencing and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as described under âExperimental Proceduresâ to derive the structures shown.

Q-TOF Mass Spectrometry of GlycopeptidesâElectrospray MS and MS/MS spectra were recorded with a Micromass Q-TOF mass spectrometer fitted with a Z-spray ion source and a nanoflow injection system. The ion source temperature was 150 Â°C; the needle voltage was 1668 V, and the cone voltage was 80 V. Samples were infused in 1:1 double-distilled water/acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid at about 20 nl/min from borosilicate capillary needles. For MS/MS, the collision energy was 35â40 V for the doubly charged [M + 2H]2+ ions from the C-terminal glycopeptide ions and 100â110 V for the singly charged ions. The mass window for parent ion selection was about 4 Da. Argon at 20 pounds/square inch was used as the collision gas. Sample acquisition and processing were performed with the Micromass MassLynx data system. Analytical UltracentrifugationâAnalytical ultracentrifugation experiments were performed using a Beckman Optima XL(I) analytical ultracentrifuge, which is equipped with absorbance and interference optics. Samples of sCD8Î±Î±E, sCD8Î±Î±K1, and sCD8Î±Î±Lec were spun at 40,000 rpm at 20 Â°C. Sample distributions were recorded, using the interference or absorbance systems, at 2-min intervals. The data were analyzed using the Sedfit software (34Schuck P. MacPhee C.E. Howlett G.J. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 466-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 35Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 272: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The partial specific volumes and masses of sCD8Î±Î±K1, sCD8Î±Î±Lec, and sCD8Î±Î±E were calculated using the known amino acid composition of CD8 and the glycosylation analysis of sCD8Î±Î±K1 and sCD8Î±Î±Lec reported herein. The calculation was accomplished using a derivative program of AtoB (36Byron O. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 408-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The sedimentation coefficients of sCD8 calculated over a concentration range were extrapolated to infinite dilution and corrected for buffer viscosity and density compared with water as a standard solvent. The program Sedfit was used to calculate the frictional ratio of each sample f/f 0, this being the ratio between the experimental frictional coefficient and the frictional coefficient of a spherical species of the same mass and partial specific volume. The frictional and sedimentation coefficients obtained were corrected for hydration effects for a series of different levels of hydration as previously described (37Mavaddat N. Mason D.W.

The bead molecules used to predict hydrodynamic properties were calculated using the program AtoB (36Byron O. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 408-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The solution properties of the bead models were calculated using SOLPRO (39Carrasco B. de la Torre J.G. Byron O. King D. Walters C. Jones S. Harding S.E. Biophys.

The structure/function analysis of protein glycosylation can be problematic because preventing glycosylation, either genetically or with inhibitors, can lead to protein misfolding and/or non-secretion (for example see Ref. 40Lu X.

In the case of O-glycans, post-expression enzymatic deglycosylation is difficult because commercially available endo-Î²-N-acetylgalactosaminidases do not cleave all types of O-glycan chains (41Iwase H. Hotta K. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 14: 151-159PubMed Google Scholar). The O-glycosylation of proteins secreted by CHO cell-derived Lec3.2.8.1 cells has not been characterized previously in detail, but these cells are known to be deficient in enzymes required for sialylation (Lec2 mutations; Refs. 42Deutscher S.L.

It was therefore anticipated that these cells would produce soluble forms of sCD8 Î±Î± and Î±Î² with substantially modified O-glycans. We confirm this proposal here and examine its consequences for the structure of sCD8 expressed in Lec3.2.8.1 versus non-mutant CHO K1 cells using velocity sedimentation analysis, which is one of the few techniques that presently yield structural data for native glycoproteins with the properties of CD8. To allow reliable hydrodynamic modeling we also characterize the N-glycosylation of the soluble forms of CD8. CD8 ConstructsâFor the present study, four recombinant soluble forms of glycosylated CD8 were prepared as described previously (22Pellicci D.G. Kortt A.A. Sparrow L.G. Hudson P.J. Sorensen H.V. Davis S.J. Classon B.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 246: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Briefly, sCD8Î±Î± consists of the mouse CD8Î± chain (residues 1â130 of the mature polypeptide) expressed as a soluble, homodimeric fusion protein with 17 residues of the rat CD8Î± stalk-like peptide (residues 122â138) containing the O-linked sugars and the OX-8 anti-rat CD8 monoclonal antibody epitope (Fig. 1a). Overall, the stalk-like region of this protein, measured from the first residue beyond Î²-strand G of the murine Î±-chain V-set IgSF domain, consists of 26 residues. sCD8Î±Î² was generated by co-transfecting the sCD8Î± construct (Fig. 1a) together with a construct consisting of residues 1â116 of the mouse Î²-chain sequence attached to the 23 residues forming the C terminus of the sCD8Î± construct (Fig. 1b). The sCD8 isoforms were expressed in CHO"

These enzymes are capable of hydrolyzing extracellular matrix (ECM) components under physiological conditions. Specific and selective inhibitors aimed at blocking their activity are highly sought for use as potential therapeutic agents. We report herein on a novel mode of inhibition of gelatinase A (MMP-2) by the recently characterized inhibitors 4-(4-phenoxphenylsulfonyl)butane-1,2-dithiol (inhibitor 1) and 5-(4-phenoxphenylsulfonyl) pentane-1,2-dithiol (inhibitor 2). These synthetic inhibitors are selective for MMP-2 and MMP-9. We show that the dithiolate moiety of these inhibitors chelates the catalytic zinc ion of MMP-2 via two sulfur atoms. This mode of binding results in alternation of the coordination number of the metal ion and the induction of conformational changes at the microenvironment of the catalytic zinc ion; a set of events that is likely to be at the root of the potent slow binding inhibition behavior exhibited by these inhibitors.

Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1999; 43: S42-S51Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). MMPs constitute a multigene family of at least 26 secreted and membrane-tethered zinc-dependent endopeptidases, which can be classified according to their structures and substrate specificities (2Massova I. Kotra L P. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 3Nagase H. Woessner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3827) Google Scholar). Members of the family include: collagenases (MMP-1, -8, -13), gelatinases (MMP-2, -9), stromelysins (MMP-3, -7, -10, -11, -12), and membrane-type (MT)-MMPs (MT1-MMP to MT6-MMP). The catalytic domains of the MMPs have an ellipsoid shape with a small active site cleft. This cleft contains the catalytic zinc ion, which is essential for catalysis (4Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Isupov M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Tryggvason K. Science. 1999; 284: 1667-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Gelatinases, MMP-2 (gelatinase A) and MMP-9 (gelatinase B), constitute a distinct subgroup of the MMPs family due to the incorporation of three repeats of the fibronectin-type II module in the catalytic domain. These enzymes have been shown to play a key role in tumor cell invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis by promoting degradation of ECM and the processing of cytokines, growth factors, hormones, and cell receptors (5Moses M.A. Stem Cells. 1997; 15: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 6Nguyen M. Arkell J. Jackson C.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 960-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). As with other MMPs, MMP-2 and MMP-9 are expressed as zymogenic latent enzymes (pro-MMPs) requiring activation. Both proteolytic and non-proteolytic mechanisms have been described for zymogen activation. However, the âcysteine-switchâ hypothesis (7Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) proposes that upon activation, the zinc ion in the latent active site is converted to a catalytic zinc ion by the dissociation of the conserved cysteine thiolate within the active site. The cleavage or the dissociation of the propeptide makes available the catalytic zinc ion to the substrates (4Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Isupov M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Tryggvason K. Science. 1999; 284: 1667-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Activation of pro-MMP-2 is mediated by members of the membrane-type MMP subfamily of membrane-tethered MMPs, in particular MT1-MMP. Pro-MMP-2 activation by MT1-MMP is a highly regulated process involving the action of the endogenous tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) (8Polette M. Birembaut P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 9Ellerbroek S.M. Stack M.S. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 940-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 10Sato H. Takino T.

In this process, TIMP-2 binds the N terminus of the active MT1-MMP and the hemopexin-like domain of pro-MMP-2, forming a ternary complex. This results in the accumulation of pro-MMP-2 on the cell surface and its subsequent activation by an adjacent TIMP-2-free MT1-MMP (13Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A.

Thus, a delicate balance between MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 on the cell surface determines the ability of cells to activate pro-MMP-2. Because of the central function that MMP-2 and MMP-9 play in many pathological processes, these MMPs constitute and remain major targets for therapeutic intervention (14Overall C. Lopez-Otin C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 9: 657-672Crossref Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). To date, the most common approach to target MMP activity, including gelatinase activity, has been the development of reversible hydroxamate-based peptidomimetic inhibitors such as Batimastat and Marimastat, which possess high affinity toward the catalytic site of the enzymes (15Rasmussen H.S. McCann P.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 75: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 16Brown P.D. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 52: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, clinical trials using these broad spectrum MMP inhibitors have been disappointing. Several reasons were provided to explain these poor results including lack of specificity, toxicity, and the stage of cancer in the patient (17Coussens L.M. Fingleton B. Matrisian L.M. Science. 2002; 295: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (2331) Google Scholar, 18Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5031) Google Scholar). In addition, although the reversible hydroxamic acid-based inhibitors were selected for their high affinity inhibition in classical enzyme inhibition studies, their effects on MMP structure and function both at the protein and at the cellular level are poorly understood. We have shown that reversible synthetic MMP inhibitors like Marimastat can, under certain conditions, promote pro-MMP-2 activation by MT1-MMP in the presence of TIMP-2 (19Toth M. Bernardo M.M. Gervasi D.C. Soloway P.D. Wang Z. Bigg H.F. Overall C.M. DeClerck Y.A. Tschesche H. Cher M. Brown S. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41415-41423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This paradoxical effect correlates with the extent of the synthetic inhibitor affinity toward MT1-MMP since an irreversible mechanism-based inhibitor selective for gelatinases had no such effect. Structurally, we have recently demonstrated that the mechanism-based inhibitor for gelatinases produces a conformational state in the active enzyme complexed with the inhibitor that resembles that of the latent inactive form (20Kleifeld O. Kotra L.P. Gervasi D.C. Brown S. Bernardo M.M. Fridman R. Mobashery S. Sagi I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17125-17131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that the binding mode of the inhibitor may exert profound effects in the structure, regulation, and activity of MMPs. A recent report by Bernardo et al. (21Bernardo M.M. Brown S. Li Z. Fridman R. Mobashery S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11201-11207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) described the design, synthesis, and characterization of two new potent slow binding inhibitors that are selective for MMP-2 and MMP-9. Specifically, these dithiol inhibitors are 4-(4-phenoxphenylsulfonyl-)butane-1,2-dithiol (1) and 5-(4-phenoxphenylsulfonyl) pentane-1,2-dithiol (2) (see Scheme 1) exhibiting K i values in the range of 46â260 nm (21Bernardo M.M. Brown S. Li Z. Fridman R. Mobashery S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11201-11207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, both 1 and 2 exhibit much lower affinity toward MMP-3. Based on their slow binding mode of inhibition, inhibitors 1 and 2 were expected to initiate subtle conformational changes in the active site of the enzyme, resulting in a stable complex that do not readily reverse to allow recovery of activity (21Bernardo M.M. Brown S. Li Z. Fridman R. Mobashery S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11201-11207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), as we reported for the interaction of the first mechanism-based inhibitor selective for the gelatinases (20Kleifeld O. Kotra L.P. Gervasi D.C. Brown S. Bernardo M.M. Fridman R. Mobashery S. Sagi I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17125-17131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Herein we report on the nature of the interactions of these two novel MMP inhibitors within the active site of MMP-2. Specifically, we show that the dithiol moieties of these inhibitors are directly coordinated to the zinc ion in a bidentate manner, in a process that proceeds with a conformational change of the enzyme involving structural alternations in the nearest coordination shell of the zinc ion. Because of the need to use relatively large amounts of enzyme for the various biophysical experiments, human pro-MMP-2 was obtained from two sources. Specifically, TIMP-2-free pro-MMP-Î± was purified from the media of HeLa S3 cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding the full-length cDNA of human pro-MMP-2 as described previously (22Olson M.W. Bernardo M.M. Pietila M. Gervasi D.C. Toth M. Kotra L.P. Massova I. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2661-2668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and pro-MMP-2 purified from HT-1080 cells was generously provided by Prof. Alex Strongin of the Burngham Institute. The protein concentration of the enzyme was determined using the molar extinction coefficient of 122,800 mâ1cmâ1 (23Murphy G. Crabbe. T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 470-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Pro-MMP-2 was activated with 1 mm p-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA), dissolved in 200 mm Tris, for 30 min at 37 Â°C. Inhibitors 1 and 2 were synthesized as described earlier (21Bernardo M.M. Brown S. Li Z. Fridman R. Mobashery S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11201-11207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Both 1 and 2 were dissolved in 10% Me2SO. The inhibitors were complexed with MMP-2 using a 1:100 enzyme to inhibitor ratio. Sample PreparationâAll enzyme samples were subjected to gelatin zymography before XAS data collection. The enzyme was concentrated by ultrafiltration using a Millipore Centricon-30 (Bedford, MA) device to make a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. All samples were loaded into copper sample holders (10 Ã 5 Ã 0.5 mm) covered with Mylar tape and were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. The frozen samples were then mounted inside a Displex closed-cycle helium cryostat, and the temperature was maintained at 30 K to minimize the thermal disorder in the XAS data. Data CollectionâXAS data collection was performed at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory, beam-line X9B. The spectra were recorded at the Zn k-edge in fluorescence geometry at low temperature (30 K). The beam energy was defined using a flat Si (111) monochromator crystal. The incident beam intensity I0 was recorded using an ionization chamber. The fluorescence intensity was recorded using a 13-element Germanium detector. The transmission signal from a zinc foil was measured with a reference ion chamber simultaneously with fluorescence in order to calibrate the beam energy. Several scans of each sample were collected for a total of 1 Ã 106 counts across the edge. The samples were checked for burning marks after each scan, and the beam position on the sample was changed before each scan to minimize radiation damages. Data Processing and AnalysisâThe average Zn k-edge absorption coefficient Î¼(E), which was obtained after 10â12 independent XAS measurements for each sample, were aligned using the first inflection point of a reference zinc metal foil XAS data (9659 eV). Subsequently, the absorption coefficients for different samples were shifted in x-ray energy until their first inflection points were aligned at the same energy. The smooth atomic background was removed with the AUTOBK program of the UWXAFS data analysis package, developed at the University of Washington, Seattle (24Stern E.A. Newville M. Ravel B. Haskel D. Yacoby Y. Physica B. 1995; 208 & 209: 117-122Crossref Scopus (920) Google Scholar). The same energy, E 0 = 9659 eV, was chosen for the purpose of background removal as the origin of the photoelectron energy. The R-space region for minimizing the signal below the first shell was chosen between 1.2 and 3 AÌ. After the removal of background, the useful k-range in the resultant k2 -weighted Ï(k) was between 2.0 and 9 AÌâ1. Model data for the fitting procedure were constructed by extracting the catalytic zinc site coordinates (in a radius of 6 AÌ from the crystallographic coordinates of gelatinase A (PDB code 1CK7). Using the computer code FEFF7 (26Rehr J.J. Mustre de Leon J. Zabinsky S.I. Albers R.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5135-5140Crossref Scopus (1808) Google Scholar, 27Zabinsky S.I. Rehr J.J. Ankudinov A. Albers R.C. Eller M.J. Phys. Rev. B. 1995; 52: 2995-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar), we calculated the theoretical photoelectron scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. Total theoretical Ï(k) was constructed by adding the most important partial Ï(k) values that contributed to the R-range of interest. The theoretical XAFS signal was fitted to the experimental data using the non-linear least squares method, implemented in the program FEFFIT (24Stern E.A. Newville M. Ravel B. Haskel D. Yacoby Y. Physica B. 1995; 208 & 209: 117-122Crossref Scopus (920) Google Scholar) in R-space, by Fourier transforming both theory and data. Data and theory were weighted by k and multiplied by a Hanning window function in Fourier transforms. CD was measured using an Aviv spectrophotometer, model 202. The data was collected using quartz cells with a light path 0.1 cm for far UV (180â240 nm). In the inhibition studies, all samples contained 6.6 Î¼m active MMP-2, 66 Î¼m 1 or 2, in 0.5% ethanol. All samples were prepared in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 75 mm Na2SO4, 5 mm CaSO4, 0.02% Brij. A recently published x-ray structure of MMP-2 (4Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Isupov M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Tryggvason K. Science. 1999; 284: 1667-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) (PDB code 1CK7) was used for the molecular modeling carried out in this study. Crystallographic water molecules present in the x-ray structure were retained, and the program âprotonate,â a component of the AMBER 6 package (28Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. Cheatham III, T.E. Ross W.S. Simmerling C.L. Darden T.A. Merz K.M. Seibel G.L. Cheng A.L. Vincent J.J. Crowley M. Tsui V. Radmer R.J. Duan Y. Pitera J. Massova I. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A. AMBER. 6th Ed. University of California, San Francisco1999Google Scholar) was used to add hydrogen atoms to the enzyme. The two enantiomers of the inhibitor 1 were then constructed and docked into the active site of MMP-2 using SYBYL (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). The distances between the active site zinc ion and its ligand atoms were constrained to values determined experimentally. Atomic charges for 1 were determined using the RESP fitting procedure (29Bayly C.I. Cieplak P. Cornell W.D. Kollman P.A. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 97: 10269Crossref Scopus (5357) Google Scholar). This consisted of first optimizing the molecules at the HF/3â21G* level of theory and basis set, followed by a HF/6â31G* single-point energy calculation to determine the electrostatic potential around the molecule, which was subsequently used in the two-stage RESP fitting procedure. All ab initio calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 98 suite of programs (30Frisch M.J. Truck G.W. Schlegel H.B. Scuseria G.E. Robb M.A. Cheeseman J.R. Zakrzewski V.G. Montgomery Jr., J.A.

Following the RESP fitting procedure, the R- and S-1/MMP-2 complexes were fully solvated in a box of TIP3P waters such that no atom in the complex was less than 10 AÌ from any face of the box. This resulted in a total of 53,587 atoms. The particle mesh Ewald (PME) method was used to treat long range electrostatics (31Darden T.A.M. York D. Pedersen L.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (19731) Google Scholar). The AMBER 6 software package using the Cornell et al. force field (32Cornell W.D.C.P. Bayley C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11375) Google Scholar) based on the Parma99 data set of parameters was used to carry out the energy minimization. Two individual 20,000 energy minimization steps were carried out for the fully solvated R- and S-1 stereoisomers bound to the MMP-2 active. The first 500 steps consisted of steepest descent energy minimization, followed by 19,500 steps of conjugate-gradient energy minimization. The local structures around the catalytic zinc ion in latent and active MMP-2, and in the complexes of active MMP-2 with inhibitors 1 and 2 were studied by XAS. XAS refers to modulations in x-ray absorption coefficient around an x-ray absorption edge of a given atom. The technique measures the transition core electronic states of the metal to excited electronic states or continuum states. Spectral analysis near the electronic transition, x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), provides information on the metal charge state and geometry (33Scott R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 414-459Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Spectral analysis above the absorption edge, in the extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) region, provides complementary structural information such as coordination numbers, types, thermal disorder, Debye-Waller factors, and distances from neighboring atoms to the central (absorbing) atom. XAS is a valuable technique for elucidating the structures of a variety of metal-binding sites in metalloproteins (33Scott R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 414-459Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). XANES Studies of Pro-MMP-2, Active MMP-2, and of the Complexes of MMP-2:1 and MMP-2:2â Fig. 1 shows the normalized zinc k near-edge spectra of pro-MMP-2, active MMP-2, and inhibited states of the enzyme. Although difficult to interpret quantitatively, near-edge spectra are very sensitive to the geometry and the nature of the ligands. Thus, they can be very useful as fingerprints of particular coordination environments. The near-edge spectrum of pro-MMP-2 has two characteristic peaks at 9714 eV and at 9738 eV (Fig. 1). As we reported previously, the peak intensity at 9738 eV changes upon activation or inhibition of the enzyme due to alternation in the local structure around the catalytic zinc ion. The dissociation of the cysteine residue from the catalytic zinc ion during activation of MMP-2 results in the reduction of the peak intensity at 9738 eV. Interestingly, binding of both 1 and 2 further reduce this intensity (Fig. 1), while binding of the mechanism-based inhibitor 3 (also referred to as âSB-3CTâ in earlier publications), which interacts with the zinc ion by one thiolate upon the requisite reaction within the active site that results in the formation of the thiolate and the attendant inhibition of the enzyme, largely restores it (20Kleifeld O. Kotra L.P. Gervasi D.C. Brown S. Bernardo M.M. Fridman R. Mobashery S. Sagi I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17125-17131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, the changes in the edge energy upon binding of 1 and 2 to MMP-2 are more pronounced (Fig. 1, inset). Specifically, a significant shift of the edge position to higher energy is observed. As we reported earlier, such shifts to higher energy may be associated with changes in coordination number or ligand exchange at the metal ion (20Kleifeld O. Kotra L.P. Gervasi D.C. Brown S. Bernardo M.M. Fridman R. Mobashery S. Sagi I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17125-17131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 34Kleifeld O. Frenkel A. Martin J.M.L. Sagi I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 98-103Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Overall, these results, suggest that the interactions of 1 and 2 with the catalytic zinc ion of MMP-2 are different than the one observed for 3. EXAFS Data Analysis of Pro-MMP-2, Active MMP-2, and MMP-2:1 and MMP-2:2 ComplexesâThe results of the EXAFS data analysis of MMP-2, in its latent, active, and inhibited states complemented our XANES studies. The EXAFS analysis were conducted by fitting the data to theoretical phase shifts and amplitudes that were constructed by feeding the coordinates of the structural and catalytic zinc sites of pro-MMP-2 (PDB code 1CK7) into the FEFF7 program (26Rehr J.J. Mustre de Leon J. Zabinsky S.I. Albers R.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5135-5140Crossref Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). The catalytic zinc ion in pro-MMP-2 is bound to three histidines and one cysteine, whereas the structural zinc ion is bound to three histidines and one aspartate. The theoretical models that were constructed from these sites were used to modulate the catalytic zinc site of the various enzyme complexes. Standard curve-fitting procedures were used to fit the FEFF7 theory data to the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier-transformed Ï(k). The k 2 weighting factor and the Hanning window function, defined between 2 and 9 AÌâ1 were used in the Fourier transforms of all data sets. During the fitting procedure, the corrections to the energy origin (ÎE 0), bond distances (ÎR), and mean square disorders of the distances (Ï2) were varied until the best fit was obtained. The number of relevant independent data points N idp in the data was calculated using Equation 1 (35Stern E.A. Phys. Rev. 1993; B48: 9825Crossref Scopus (501) Google Scholar), Nidp=2ÎkÎRÏ+2(Eq. 1) where Îk and ÎR represent the data ranges in k and R spaces, respectively. Equation 1 implies that the number of fit variables should be smaller than N idp. To reduce the number of fit variables, we fixed the many-body factor S02 at 0.9. Fig. 2 shows the best fitting results of the EXAFS analysis of the various structures. The fitting parameters and the quality of the fits are listed in Table I. The zinc sites in the various forms of the enzyme were fitted to the ZnâN, ZnâO, ZnâS, and ZnâC paths using different combinations of varied and constraint parameters. In addition, different initial conditions of distances, Debye-Waller factors, and ÎE 0 shifts, were applied in the fitting procedure. In order to account for two zinc ions in our fitting procedures, we have used the following strategy, which was specifically developed, in our laboratory for the EXAFS analysis of MMPs (20Kleifeld O. Kotra L.P. Gervasi D.C. Brown S. Bernardo M.M. Fridman R. Mobashery S. Sagi I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17125-17131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, the EXAFS data were fitted to a relevant theoretical model containing only one zinc ion and in the second stage, the fits were refined by constraining and fixing the structural zinc contributions in the fits and fitting the residual phases and amplitudes with the appropriate model. This procedure was repeated in an iterative way until a stable solution was achieved. Furthermore, final refinement of the data included the repeat of the second stage by fixing the catalytic zinc contributions. Using this fitting procedure allowed us to better estimate the goodness of the fits and to refine the results.Table IEXAFS curve fitting parameters of pro-MMP-2, active MMP-2, MMP-2:1 and MMP-2:2 inhibitor complexesFitPathÎE0R [AÌ]Ï [AÌ2]Pro-MMP-2Fit 1.Zn-N Ã 2-3.17[F]1.88 [F]1.0E-03 [V]Zn-N Ã 1-3.17[F]1.91 (1)1.0E-03[VA]Zn-S Ã 1-3.17[F]2.24 (1)1.0E-03 [V]Zn-C Ã 26.9 [F]2.63 [F]6.0E-03 [V]Zn-C Ã 56.9 [F]3.01 (4)6.0E-03[VA]Active MMP-2Fit 1.Zn-N/O Ã 45.65[F]1.99 (2)3.0E-03 [V]Zn-C Ã 47.1 [F]3.00 (1)1.0E-03 [V]MMP-2:1 complexFit 1.Zn-N Ã 3-7.1 [F]1.91 (1)6.0E-03 [V]Zn-S Ã 2-7.1 [F]2.24 (1)5.0E-03 [V]Zn-C Ã 46.8 [F]2.76 (4)1.9E-02 [V]Zn-C Ã 46.8 [F]3.05 (5)1.9E-02[VA]Fit 2.Zn-N Ã 3-7.3 [F]1.01 [F]6.0E-03 [V]Zn-S Ã 2-7.3 [F]2.24 (1)5.0E-03 [V]Zn-C Ã 46.8 [F]2.76 (3)5.0E-03 [V]Zn-C Ã 46.8 [F]3.05 (4)1.8E-02[VA]Fit 3.Zn-N Ã 3-3.6 [F]1.94 (1)3.0E-03 [V]Zn-S Ã 1-3.6 [F]2.27 (1)1.0E-06 [V]Zn-C Ã 46.8 [F]2.78 (5)1.9E-02 [V]Zn-C Ã 46.8 [F]3.07 (7)1.9E-02[VA]Fit 4.Zn-N Ã 3-8 [F]1.91 (2)1.0E-02 [V]Zn-S Ã 3-8 [F]2.23 (1)1.1E-02 [V]Zn-C Ã 46.8 [F]2.75 (4)3.0E-02 [V]Zn-C Ã 46.8 [F]3.04 (6)3.0E-02[VA]MMP-2:2 complexFit 1.Zn-N Ã 3-0.5 [F]1.95 (1)2.0E-03 [V]Zn-S Ã 2-0.5 [F]2.29 (1)4.0E-03 [V]Zn-C Ã 21.95[V]3.34 (9)1.4E-02 [V]Zn-C Ã 51.95[V]2.96 (9)1.4E-02[VA]Fit 2.Zn-N Ã 1-1.6 [F]1.87 [F]1.0E-03[VA]Zn-N Ã 2-1.6 [F]1.99 (1)1.0E-03 [V]Zn-S Ã 1-1.8 [F]2.22 [F]2.0E-03[VA]Zn-S Ã 1-1.8 [F]2.36 (2)2.0E-03 [V]Zn-C Ã 24.68[V]2.61 (7)1.2E-02 [V]Zn-C Ã 54.68[V]2.97 [F]1.2E-02[VA]Fit 3.Zn-N Ã 3-0.5 [F]1.97 (1)2.0E-03 [V]Zn-S Ã 1-0.5 [F]2.31 (2)1.0E-08 [V]Zn-C Ã 25.5 [V]2.64 (9)1.0E-02 [V]Zn-C Ã 55.5 [V]2.96 (9)1.0E-02[VA]Fit 4.Zn-N Ã 3-7 [F]1.98 (1)5.0E-03 [V]Zn-S Ã 3-7 [F]2.3 (1)1.1E-02 [V]Zn-C Ã 21.1 [V]3.3(1)1.4E-02 [V]Zn-C Ã 51.1 [V]2.96(1)1.4E-02[VA] Open table in a new tab Stable and reproducible fits of pro-MMP-2 were consistent with a tetrahedral coordination of the zinc ion with three ZnâN(His) at 1.90 Â± 0.01 AÌ, one ZnâS(Cys) at 2.24 Â± 0.01 AÌ contributions (in the first coordination shell), and seven ZnâC contributions were two ZnâC at 2.63 Â± 0.05 AÌ and five at 3.01 Â± 0.04 AÌ (in the second coordination shell).

https://openalex.org/W1965418377,"The FemABX family encodes enzymes that incorporate l-amino acids into the interchain peptide bridge of Gram-positive cell wall peptidoglycan and are novel nonribosomal peptidyl transferases that use aminoacyl-tRNA as the amino acid donor. We previously reported the identification of the femX gene from Lactobacillus viridescens and recombinant expression of active FemX (LvFemX) that catalyzes the transfer of l-Ala from Ala-tRNAAla to the Ïµ-amino group of l-lysine of UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide (Hegde, S.

Recombinant LvFemX exhibits Km values of 42 and 15 Î¼m for UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide and Escherichia coli Ala-tRNAAla, respectively, and exhibited a kcat value of 660 minâ1. Initial velocity and inhibition kinetic studies support an ordered sequential mechanism for the enzyme, and we propose that catalysis proceeds via a ternary complex. The pH dependence of the activity was bell-shaped, depending on the ionization state of two groups exhibiting apparent pKa values of 5.5 and 9.3. Chemical modification of the enzyme and the kinetics of inactivation, and protection by substrate, indicated the involvement of carboxyl groups in the catalytic function of the enzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis identified Asp109 as a candidate for the catalytic base and Glu320 plays an additional important role in the catalytic function of the enzyme.

Recombinant LvFemX exhibits Km values of 42 and 15 Î¼m for UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide and Escherichia coli Ala-tRNAAla, respectively, and exhibited a kcat value of 660 minâ1. Initial velocity and inhibition kinetic studies support an ordered sequential mechanism for the enzyme, and we propose that catalysis proceeds via a ternary complex. The pH dependence of the activity was bell-shaped, depending on the ionization state of two groups exhibiting apparent pKa values of 5.5 and 9.3. Chemical modification of the enzyme and the kinetics of inactivation, and protection by substrate, indicated the involvement of carboxyl groups in the catalytic function of the enzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis identified Asp109 as a candidate for the catalytic base and Glu320 plays an additional important role in the catalytic function of the enzyme. The Ïµ-NH2 group of diamino acids such as meso-diaminopimelic acid, l-lysine, or l-ornithine of the stem peptide of peptidoglycan is cross-linked to d-Ala4 of the neighboring peptide either directly or via interchain peptide bridge (Fig. 1). The interchain peptide bridges are synthesized only in a subset of Gram-positive bacteria that include many important human pathogens and in a very few Gram-negative species, including pathogenic spirochetes but excluding non-pathogenic species of the flora (1Ghuysen J.M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1968; 32: 425-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymes that incorporate l-amino acids into the interchain cross bridge; unlike the mur-encoded enzymes in the peptidoglycan biosynthetic pathway, are novel nonribosomal peptidyl transferases and use aminoacyl-tRNA as the amino acid donor (2Plapp R. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3675-3682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Matsuhashi M. Dietrich C.P. Strominger J.L. J. Biol.

The interchain peptide is specific for a given species and varies both in sequence and chain length from species to species (Fig. 1). In Staphylococcus aureus, the femX (now renamed as fmhB), femA, and femB genes were shown to be responsible for the incorporation of glycine1, glycine2-3, and glycine4-5, respectively, of the pentaglycine interchain peptide (5Stranden A.M.

Similarly, femAB homologs of Streptococcus pneumoniae designated as murM and murN were reported to be responsible for the addition of l-Ala/l-Ser to l-Lys and subsequent incorporation of a second l-Ala residue, respectively (9Filipe S.R.

Though the femABX gene products (including murMN and femAB homologs from other species) have been implicated in interchain peptide formation, no catalytic activity has been demonstrated for these proteins. In S. aureus and other bacteria, FemX purifies as a large, cell wall-associated multienzyme-lipid complex (3Matsuhashi M. Dietrich C.P. Strominger J.L. J. Biol.

Dietrich C.P. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3191-3206Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In contrast, Lactobacillus viridescens (also known as Weissella viridescens) has been shown to produce a soluble FemX (EC 2.3.2.10) that catalyzes the transfer of l-Ala from alanyl-tRNA to UDP-MPP before its lipid conjugation (2Plapp R. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3675-3682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have purified L. viridescens FemX (LvFemX), identified the femX gene using reverse genetics and demonstrated the catalytic activity for the recombinant LvFemX (Ref. 12Hegde S.S. Shrader T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6998-7003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar and Scheme 1). Recently, two recombinant enzymes, namely BppA1 and BppA2 (equivalent to the S. aureus FemX and FemA) from Enterococcus faecalis have been shown to specifically transfer l-Ala from alanyl-tRNA to the first and second positions of the side chain, respectively (13Bouhss A.

In the present study, we report the substrate specificity, kinetic parameters of various tRNA and UDP-MPP substrates, kinetic mechanism, solvent kinetic isotope effects, and the involvement of Asp109 in the catalytic function of LvFemX.Scheme 1A, the reaction catalyzed by LvFemX.

BstN1 was purchased from New England Biolabs, and DNase was from Promega. RNase inhibitor and NTPs, were from Roche Applied Science. Uniformly labeled l-[14C]Ala (specific activity 158 mCi/mmol), l-[14C]Ser (151 mCi/mmol), and [14C]Gly were from Amersham Biosciences. The N-terminally His6-tagged E. coli T7-RNA polymerase expression plasmid (pT7-911Q) was a kind gift from Dr. Thomas Shrader. The plasmids containing E. coli tRNA genes were the kind gift from Drs. O. C. Uhlenbeck, Alexy Wolfson, and Haruichi Asahara (University of Colorado). The expression plasmid (pQE-alaS-459-6H) of C-terminally His6-tagged recombinant E. coli alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS-459-6H) was the kind gift from Drs. Lluis Ribas de Pouplana and Paul Schimmel. Wild-type and mutant LvFemX were expressed and purified as described previously (12Hegde S.S. Shrader T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6998-7003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated by the Bio-Rad protein assay method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. UDP-MPPLys and UDP-MPPDap from S. aureus and Bacillus subtilis, respectively, were isolated and purified to homogeneity as described previously (12Hegde S.S. Shrader T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6998-7003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), with an additional round of Mono-Q and Biogel-P2 chromatography (FPLC, Amersham Biosciences). The purity of the products was determined by electrospray mass spectrometry and the concentration determined spectrophotometrically using a molar absorption coefficient of 104mâ1 cmâ1. UDP-MPPOrn was isolated and purified from Lactobacillus cellobiosus (ATCC 11739) as described above. L. cellobiosus was grown in MRS medium (Difco) at 37 Â°C to mid-log phase (OD600 = 1.2), vancomycin was added to a concentration of 40 Î¼g/ml, and the flasks were incubated for an additional 3 h. The UDP-MPPLys-Ala (product of the FemX) was prepared enzymatically and purified as described above. All tRNAs used in the study were synthesized in vitro using T7-RNA polymerase. The synthesis of various tRNAs from encoding plasmids using deoxyoligonucleotide templates were performed as described previously (15Sampson J.R. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, plasmid-encoded tRNA genes (100 Î¼g of plasmid) were digested with BstN1, the restriction enzyme removed by phenol/chloroform extraction and the linearized plasmid recovered by ethanol precipitation. The transcription reactions of 1 ml included: 40 mm Tris (pH 8.2), 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 2 mm spermidine, 7 mm each NTP, 250 units of RNase inhibitor, 15 mm MgCl2, 100 Î¼g of bovine serum albumin, 2 units of inorganic pyrophosphatase, 100 Î¼g of purified T7-RNA polymerase and 100 Î¼g of linearized plasmid template, and the reactions were incubated for 10â12 h at 37 Â°C. Proteins from the reaction mixture were removed by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation of the nucleic acids. The precipitate was dissolved in DNase digestion buffer (Promega), and the plasmid template was digested with 20 units of RNase-free DNase. The DNase was removed by phenol/chloroform extraction and the tRNA transcripts were precipitated twice with 2 volumes of ethanol, re-dissolved in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm DTT and 200 units of RNase inhibitor. The transcripts were analyzed by electrophoresis on a denaturing acrylamide gel (12%) in Tris borate/EDTA buffer containing urea. For microhelixAla (17Fracklyn C. Schimmel P. Nature. 1989; 337: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) two deoxyoligonucleotide templates: micro-p, 5â²-AATTGCTGCAGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGCTATAGCTCTAGCTCCACC-3â² (T7 promoter sequence is underlined) and micro-t, 5â²-TGGTGGAGCTAGAGCTATAGCCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTACTGCAGCAATT-3â² (transcribing sequence is underlined) were used instead of plasmid template. Forty micrograms of each of the oligonucleotides annealed by heating to 80 Â°C and cooling to room temperature before adding to the transcription reaction as described above. The final transcripts were also heated to 80 Â°C and cooled to room temperature before storage. The typical yield of tRNA transcript from the above reactions was 8â9 mg. For routine assays and kinetic studies, aminoacylation of tRNA reactions were coupled to the FemX reaction (see below). Pre-charging of tRNA was performed as described previously (18Asahara H. Uhlenbeck O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3499-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 500-Î¼l reaction mixtures contained 100 Î¼m Ala-tRNA, 5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 Î¼m [14C]Ala, 5 mm DTT, 100 units of RNase inhibitor, 1 unit inorganic pyrophosphatase, 2â3 Î¼m AlaRS-459-6H in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Charged tRNA was recovered and stored atâ80 Â°C as described (18Asahara H. Uhlenbeck O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3499-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Aminoacylation of Ser-tRNA was performed using commercially available E. coli aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Reaction rates were measured by monitoring the incorporation of radioactivity [14C]Ala into purified UDP-MPP (2Plapp R. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3675-3682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hegde S.S. Shrader T.E. J. Biol.

The 40-Î¼l assay mixture in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) contained 1 mm ATP, 60â80 Î¼m [14C]Ala, 10 mm MgCl2, 2â3 Î¼m AlaRS (19de Pouplana L.R. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15041-15048Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or 500 units of E. coli aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (Sigma) in the case of Ser-tRNA), 0.1 unit of inorganic pyrophosphatase, UDP-MPP, and tRNA. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 Î¼l of appropriately diluted FemX (40â100 ng), incubated for 1â2 min at 25 Â°C, and stopped by rapidly transferring the tubes to boiling water bath for 2 min. 2 Î¼l of the quenched reaction mixtures were spotted onto precoated cellulose TLC plates, and the incorporation of [14C]Ala into product was quantitated as described (Ref. 12Hegde S.S. Shrader T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6998-7003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar and Scheme 1). Initial velocity kinetic data were fitted using Sigmaplot 6.0. Equation 1 was used to fit simple substrate saturation kinetics, where the concentration of one substrate was varied at a fixed, saturating (â¼5Ã Km) concentration of the other substrate. Equation 2 was used to fit initial velocity patterns, where concentrations of both substrates were varied.

Equations 3, 4, and 5 were used to fit competitive, noncompetitive, and uncompetitive inhibition, respectively. In Equations 3, 4, and 5, I is the concentration of the inhibitor, and Kis and Kii are the slope and intercept inhibition constants for the inhibitor, respectively. The solvent kinetic isotope effects on V and V/K were determined by measuring the initial velocities using saturating concentrations of UDP-MPP and varying concentrations of Ala-tRNA in H2O or 75% D2O as solvent. Solvent deuterium isotope effects were calculated from Equation 6, Ï=VA/[KA (1+IEV/K)+A(1+IEV)] (Eq. 6) where, I represents the fraction of isotope, and EVK and EV are isotope effects on V/K and V (â1), respectively. The reaction rates of [14C]Ala transfer from alanyl-tRNA to UDP-MPP by LvFemX were measured over the pH range of 5.5â9.1 (in 50 mm MES buffer, pH 5.5â6.8 and 50 mm Tris and/or Hepes buffer, pH 7.1â9.1) using 600 Î¼m each substrate. The reaction mixture was preincubated for 20 min before the addition of FemX. Assays were also performed using 300 Î¼m precharged tRNA (to ensure the completeness of the aminoacylation reaction over a wide pH range), and the rates were fitted to Equation 7, logk=log[C/(1+H/Ka+Kb/H)] (Eq. 7) where C is the pH-independent plateau value, Ka is the ionization constant for the acidic group, Kb is the ionization constant for the basic group, and H is the hydrogen ion concentration. Reaction with 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) Carbodiimide (EDC)âFemX solutions (25 Î¼m, 200 Î¼l) in 50 mm MES/Hepes buffer (75:25, v/v), pH 6.0, were incubated with varying concentrations of EDC (1â5mm) at room temperature in the presence and absence of Ala-tRNA or microhelixAla. Aliquots were removed at suitable intervals and after terminating the reaction by the addition of 0.1 volume of 1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.5), the residual activities were measured under standard assay conditions. Enzyme sample incubated in the absence of EDC served as the control. Reaction with EDC/Nitrotyrosine Ethyl Ester (NTEE)âFemX solutions (100 Î¼m, 500 Î¼l) in 50 mm MES/Hepes buffer (75:25, v/v), pH 6.0, were incubated with 5 mm EDC and 5 mm NTEE at room temperature in the absence and in the presence of 120 Î¼m microhelixAla for 45 min. Subsequently, the reaction was arrested by the addition of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation, washed extensively with chilled acetone, air-dried, and dissolved in 0.1 m NaOH. The number of nitrotyrosyl groups incorporated was determined spectrophotometrically, at 430 nm, using a molar absorption coefficient of 4600 mâ1 cmâ1 (20Pho D.B. Roustan C. Tot A.N.T. Pradel L.A. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4533-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Deoxyoligonucleotide synthesis and other procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. C-terminally His6-tagged mutants were purified as described previously (12Hegde S.S. Shrader T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6998-7003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Substrate Specificity of LvFemXâIn all kinetic measurements, the rates of aminoacylation of tRNAs were adjusted so that the FemX reaction was rate-limiting. Initial velocities were determined at pH 7.5, at 5â8 different concentrations of each substrate. The data were fitted by nonlinear, least square curve fitting. Kinetic constants for aminoacyl-tRNAs, determined at a saturating concentration of UDP-MPPLys and UDP-MPPOrn are listed in Table I. The steady-state kinetic parameters for UDP-MPPLys and UDP-MPPOrn determined at saturating concentrations of different aminoacyl-tRNAs are also summarized in Table I.Table ISteady-state kinetic parameters for aminoacyl-tRNA and UDP-MurNAc pentapeptideSubstrateaValues were measured at a fixed and saturating concentrations of Ala-tRNAAla (75 Î¼m) (a), Ala-tRNASer (100 Î¼m) (b), Ser-tRNASer (75 Î¼m) (c), UDP-MPP(Lys) (200 Î¼m) (d), and UDP- MPP(Orn) (250 Î¼m) (e), as second substrate, respectively.KmkcatV/KÎ¼Mmin-1UDP-MPP(Lys)aValues were measured at a fixed and saturating concentrations of Ala-tRNAAla (75 Î¼m) (a), Ala-tRNASer (100 Î¼m) (b), Ser-tRNASer (75 Î¼m) (c), UDP-MPP(Lys) (200 Î¼m) (d), and UDP- MPP(Orn) (250 Î¼m) (e), as second substrate, respectively.42 Â± 2.5660 Â± 2416UDP-MPP(Lys)bND, not determined.42 Â± 4260 Â± 1806UDP-MPP(Lys)cNucleotide sequence of microhelixAla is 5â²GGGGCUAUAGCUCUAGCUCCACCA-3â².5.5 Â± 0.732 Â± 0203UDP-MPP(Om)aValues were measured at a fixed and saturating concentrations of Ala-tRNAAla (75 Î¼m) (a), Ala-tRNASer (100 Î¼m) (b), Ser-tRNASer (75 Î¼m) (c), UDP-MPP(Lys) (200 Î¼m) (d), and UDP- MPP(Orn) (250 Î¼m) (e), as second substrate, respectively.120 Â± 10620 Â± 2205UDP-MPP(Dap)NDbND, not determined.<0.01Ala-tRNAAlad15 Â± 1660 Â± 2444Ala-tRNAAlae31 Â± 2620 Â± 2520Ala-tRNASerd18 Â± 2260 Â± 1614MicrohelixAladcNucleotide sequence of microhelixAla is 5â²GGGGCUAUAGCUCUAGCUCCACCA-3â².29 Â± 2650 Â± 1522MicrohelixAlaecNucleotide sequence of microhelixAla is 5â²GGGGCUAUAGCUCUAGCUCCACCA-3â².41 Â± 4620 Â± 2015Ser-tRNASerd7.5 Â± 132 Â± 0304Ser-tRNASere12 Â± 1.524 Â± 0202a Values were measured at a fixed and saturating concentrations of Ala-tRNAAla (75 Î¼m) (a), Ala-tRNASer (100 Î¼m) (b), Ser-tRNASer (75 Î¼m) (c), UDP-MPP(Lys) (200 Î¼m) (d), and UDP- MPP(Orn) (250 Î¼m) (e), as second substrate, respectively.b ND, not determined.c Nucleotide sequence of microhelixAla is 5â²GGGGCUAUAGCUCUAGCUCCACCA-3â². Open table in a new tab Kinetic MechanismâThe initial velocity pattern was determined using UDP-MPPLys and Ala-tRNAAla at five different concentrations for each substrate. The resultant double reciprocal plot was intersecting (Fig. 2A), indicating a sequential kinetic mechanism. Product inhibition experiments were carried out using UDP-MPPLys-Ala versus either UDP-MPPLys or Ala-tRNAAla. UDP-MPPLys-Ala exhibited linear, competitive inhibition versus UDP-MPPLys (Fig. 2B) with an inhibition constant of 48 Â± 4.5 Î¼m, and linear, noncompetitive inhibition versus alanyl-tRNA (Fig. 2C, Kis and Kii of 291 Â± 48 Î¼m and 157 Â± 16 Î¼m, respectively). Ser-tRNA exhibited uncompetitive, dead end inhibition versus UDP-MPPLys with an inhibition constant of 248 Â± 33 Î¼m. Solvent Kinetic Isotopic EffectsâSolvent kinetic isotope effects on acyl transfer were determined by measuring initial velocities at pH 7.5, in both H2O and 75% D2O. Reactions were performed at a fixed, saturating concentration of UDP-MPPLys and at varying Ala-tRNAAla concentrations. The solvent kinetic isotope effect on V was 1.7 Â± 0.2 and on V/K was 1.1 Â± 0.1 (Fig. 2D). pH ProfileâThe pH activity profile of the Ala transfer reaction by LvFemX was bell-shaped (Fig. 3) and suggested the involvement of two groups exhibiting pKa values of 5.52 Â± 0.03 and 9.32 Â± 0.05 whose ionization is critical for catalytic activity. Modification of Carboxyl Groups and Site-directed MutagenesisâLvFemX lost more than 95% of its activity when incubated with EDC. No loss of enzymatic activity was observed in control samples. Semilogarithmic plots of residual activity as a function of time of inactivation at various concentrations of the EDC (Fig. 4) were linear up to 5% remaining activity, indicating that the inactivation follows pseudo first-order kinetics. The slope of the plot of the log of inactivation rate versus the log [EDC] was unity (Fig. 4, inset) suggesting that at least one molar equivalent of the reagent binds to one molecule of the enzyme for inactivation. Incubation of the enzyme with 1.2 molar equivalents of either Ala-tRNA or microhelixAla protected against inactivation by EDC, with about 85% of the initial activity being retained after incubation with EDC (Fig. 4). Modification of the enzyme with EDC in the presence of NTEE resulted in the incorporation of 5.05 nitrotyrosyl groups per molecule of the enzyme, with a loss of more than 95% of the initial activity. However, modification of the enzyme by EDC and NTEE, in the presence of 1.2 equivalents of either Ala-tRNA or microhelixAla, resulted in the incorporation of 3.1 nitrotyrosyl residues per molecule of the enzyme, with retention of 85% of the initial activity. This suggests that the loss of catalytic activity was due to modification of two carboxyl groups essential for the catalytic activity. Similarly, modification of LvFemX with the more reactive, carboxylate-specific reagent, Woodward reagent K (2-ethyl-5-phenylisoxazolium-3â²-sulfonate) inactivated the enzyme completely at a molar ratio of 1:20 as the result of the modification of 5 carboxyl groups, as determined by electrospray mass spectrometry of the inactivated FemX (data not shown). Inclusion of Ala-tRNA again protected against the modification of two carboxyl groups and the enzyme retained 80% of the initial catalytic activity (data not shown). To identify which carboxyl groups are involved in catalytic activity and protected against modification by Ala-tRNA, we mutated five carboxylate containing amino acid residues, which are conserved among FemABX family members to their amido-isosteres. Three of the mutant forms of FemX; E205Q, E215Q, and E316Q retained 100, 85, and 40%, respectively, of the wild-type activity. However, the mutated enzymes, D109N and E320Q, lost more than 99 and 96% of the catalytic activity, respectively, as compared with wild-type enzyme. The steady-state kinetic parameters of UDP-MPP and Ala-tRNAAla substrates for the D109N and E320Q mutant enzymes are listed in Table II.Table IIComparison of steady-state kinetic parameters (for Ala-tRNAAla and UDP-MPPLys) of wild-type and D109N and E320Q mutant enzymeWild-typeD109NE320QKm (UDP-MPPLys)42 Â± 2.5165 Â± 2067 Â± 5Km (Ala-tRNAAla)15 Â± 161 Â± 554 Â± 3kcat660 Â± 2411 Â± 0.555 Â± 3V/K(Ala-tRNAAla)440.21Fold decreaseâ28044 Open table in a new tab The FemABX family of enzymes were identified in the late 1960s and early 1970s and shown to be aminoacyl-tRNA-dependent nonribosomal peptidyl transferases (2Plapp R.

Chem. 1968; 243: 768-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, no mechanistic studies have been reported on this interesting family of peptide bond synthesizing enzymes, perhaps due to the extreme complexity of their substrates and assay procedures. The genes encoding FemABX enzymes were discovered in the 1990s and LvFemX was the first active recombinant enzyme reported (12Hegde S.S. Shrader T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6998-7003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The fact that LvFemX is a soluble protein that acts before lipid conjugation of its UDP-MPP substrate and exhibits good activity using unmodified E. coli Ala-tRNAAla, make it a good candidate for preliminary mechanistic studies of members of the FemABX enzymes. The method described here (adapted from Ref. 15Sampson J.R. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) to prepare in vitro transcribed tRNAs using T7 RNA polymerase is an inexpensive, and efficient, method to generate tRNAs (or any RNA molecules from a DNA template) on the milligram scale. From the determined steady-state kinetic values, particularly the relative V/K values, Ala-tRNAAla was the best donor substrate for LvFemX. MicrohelixAla exhibited an identical kcat value but a 2-fold increase in Km value. However, the increase in Km could be partially attributed to the likely heterogeneity in microhelix preparations (which has been observed before using the T7 RNA polymerase in vitro, see Ref. 16Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar) that could result in the generation of unchargable forms of microhelix, which would be observed in the spectrophotometric method of quantitation used. This suggests that FemX primarily recognizes the stem loop of tRNA and that other regions of the tRNA are not required for the peptidyl transferase activity of FemX. The Km value for Ala-tRNASer was identical to Ala-tRNAAla but its maximal velocity was 3 times slower compared with Ala-tRNAAla. Serine was transferred at an even slower rate from Ser-tRNASer. Though Ser-tRNASer is a poor substrate, it exhibited a 2-fold lower Km value compared with Ala-tRNAAla. Gly-tRNAGly was a very poor substrate for which the activity could be demonstrated, but for which the kinetic parameters could not be obtained with precision. The Km value of Ala-tRNAAla (15 Î¼m) for LvFemX appears to be high considering the physiological importance of the FemX reaction and the cellular concentrations of tRNAs. However, the affinity of LvFemX for heterologous tRNAs from different sources varies considerably and the L. viridescens Ala-tRNAAla (natural source) was previously shown to be the best substrate (2Plapp R. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3675-3682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among the UDP-MPPs tested, UDP-MPPLys was the best substrate. UDP-MPPOrn exhibited a comparable kcat value but a 3-fold higher Km value. UDP-MPPDap was an extremely poor substrate for LvFemX using E. coli Ala-tRNAAla, with only trace amounts of [14C]Ala being transferred upon prolonged incubation at high concentrations (1 mm) of the pentapeptide. Further, UDP-MPPDap did not exhibit any significant inhibitory effect versus UDP-MPPLys or UDP-MPPOrn at concentrations up to 1 mm (data not shown). The intersecting initial velocity plot obtained with UDP-MPPLys and Ala-tRNAAla suggests a sequential kinetic mechanism where both substrates must be bound to the enzyme for catalysis to occur. In order to distinguish between the ordered and random addition of substrates we determined product inhibition patterns by UDP-MPP-Ala and Ser-tRNA. The observation of linear, competitive inhibition versus UDP-MPP and linear, noncompetitive inhibition versus Ala-tRNAAla is consistent with the ordered addition of UDP-MPP followed by Ala-tRNAAla. The observation of uncompetitive, dead end inhibition by Ser-tRNA versus UDP-MPP confirms the order of substrate addition. To probe the potential rate-limiting nature of the chemical reaction, solvent kinetic isotope effects were determined at pH 7.5, a region where small changes in pH(D) did not have any effect on kinetic parameters (data not shown). The unitary values of the solvent kinetic isotope effects on V/K suggest that aminoacyl-tRNA is kinetically âsticky.â The larger values of the solvent kinetic isotope effects on V, which includes steps from the precatalytic ternary complex through final product release may reflect the effects of solvent isotopic substitution on the chemical step, the release of products, or the conformational changes that allow this to occur. Although small, the inequality of D2OV and D2OV/K argues against a rapid equilibrium random mechanism where the chemical step is rate-limiting. The pH dependence of the activity of LvFemX suggests that the deprotonation of a group exhibiting a pK value of 9.32 Â± 0.05 and the protonation of a group exhibiting a pK value of 5.52 Â± 0.03 causes a loss of catalytic activity (Fig. 3). The group that exhibits a pK value of 5.52 is most likely an enzyme group that acts as a general base to promote catalysis via abstraction of a proton from the Ïµ-amino group of the lysine residue of UDP-MPPLys. A possible role for the group exhibiting the pK value of 9.32 is to function as general acid donating a proton to the 3â²-oxygen of the ribose of tRNA during the collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate. We propose a model for the reaction catalyzed by LvFemX that includes this acid/base assistance (Fig. 5). UDP-MPP binds to the free enzyme followed by Ala-tRNAAla. In the ternary complex, nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl of the aminoacylated-tRNA generates the zwitterionic, tetrahedral intermediate. Based on our pH studies, we invoke the participation of a general acid to assist in protonating the 3â²-hydroxyl group of the tRNA ribose moiety and a general base to deprotonate the positively charged amine. A very similar mechanism involving catalysis by promoting the appropriate decomposition of a similar tetrahedral intermediate has been proposed for an aminoglycoside 2â²-N-acetyltransferase (23Vetting M.W. Hegde S.S. Javid-Majd F. Blanchard J.S. Roderick S.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We could demonstrate that the carbodiimide, EDC, inactivated the enzyme in a time-dependent manner. Though EDC is relatively specific for carboxyl groups, it can react with cysteines (24Lundblad R.L. Techniques in Protein Modification. CRC Press, Boca Raton, Ann Arbor, London, and Tokyo1995: 233-247Google Scholar). However, LvFemX does not contain any cysteine residues, suggesting that the loss of catalytic activity can be attributed to the modification of catalytically essential carboxyl group(s). Protection against inactivation by substrates suggested that the loss of activity was due to the modification of carboxyl groups located at, or near, the active site and not due to nonspecific modification of the enzyme. A multiple sequence alignment of members of the FemABX family revealed the presence of five highly conserved Asp or Glu residues. Mutation of either Glu205 or Glu215 to the corresponding glutamine had no effect on the catalytic activity. Glutamate 316 is totally conserved in FemABX family members; however, the E316Q mutant exhibited only a modest 3-fold decrease in the catalytic activity. Asp109 and Pro110 are totally conserved in FemABX family members, and Pro110 is essential for the structural integrity of the enzyme, as mutation of this residue results in total loss of catalytic activity (12Hegde S.S. Shrader T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6998-7003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The V/K value of the D109N mutant decreased more than 230-fold (Table II), and this is primarily due to a 60-fold decrease in kcat, with only a modest increase in Km values of the mutant enzyme. Glutamate 320 is another totally conserved residue and the mutant E320Q enzyme exhibited a 20-fold lower V/K value and a 12-fold lower kcat. These data suggest roles for Asp109 and Glu320 in the catalytic function of the enzyme. FemABX homologs are present in all organisms that produce branched peptidoglycan and are absent in species which produce directly cross-linked peptidoglycan (14Bouhss A. Josseaume N. Allanic D.

Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, the family members share low degrees of sequence similarity (12Hegde S.S. Shrader T.E. J. Biol.

Prince D.B. Mutchler V.T. Curry K.A. Ho A.M. Sarver R.W. Hagadorn J.C. Choi G.H. Garlick R.L. Structure. 2002; 10: 1107-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) reveals it has two domains; a helical arm domain and a globular domain that resembles histone acetyltransferases (Fig. 6A). LvFemX exhibits 38% sequence similarity compared with S. aureus FemA. Alignment of the LvFemX sequence with the S. aureus FemA sequence and structure reveals an amino acid deletion in FemX corresponding to the helical arm domain. There are no highly conserved amino acid residues present in the helical arm domain. The helical arm domain of FemA was proposed to be the tRNA binding site based on similarities to bacterial seryl-tRNA synthetases (26Benson T.E. Prince D.B. Mutchler V.T. Curry K.A. Ho A.M. Sarver R.W. Hagadorn J.C. Choi G.H. Garlick R.L. Structure. 2002; 10: 1107-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Despite the truncated 12 amino acid helical arm domain, FemX can efficiently bind and catalyze amino acid transfer from aminoacyl-tRNAs. LvFemX is a cytoplasmic enzyme in vivo, while other known FemABX enzymes are cell wall-associated, and we suggest that the helical arm may be involved in cell wall association. The globular domain of FemA has a large, L-shaped channel that traverses the surface of the domain (Fig. 6B) that has been proposed to be the pentapeptide substrate binding cavity (26Benson T.E. Prince D.B. Mutchler V.T. Curry K.A. Ho A.M. Sarver R.W. Hagadorn J.C. Choi G.H. Garlick R.L. Structure. 2002; 10: 1107-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Asp108 and Asp396 (equivalent to LvFemX Asp109 and Glu320) are located at the bottom of the cleft with their side chain carboxylates facing toward the cleft at a distance of 4.21 AÌ from each other (Fig. 6, B and C). In the near vicinity are two conserved residues, Tyr71 and Arg76 (equivalent to LvFemX Tyr73 and Lys76) at a distance of 2.46 and 4.69 AÌ, respectively, from Asp108 (Fig. 6C). These structural observations, coupled with our kinetic studies, chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis suggest that Asp109 is the general base exhibiting a pK value of 5.5 whose protonation abolishes catalytic activity. The function of Glu320 may be to fix the positions of Tyr73 and Lys76, either of which may serve as the general acid based on the higher pK value of 9.3. In penicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus, femA and femB could be deleted with resultant restoration of Î²-lactam sensitivity, but fmhB (FemX) is essential for the viability (8Rohrer S. Ehlert K. Labischinski H. Berger-Bachi B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9351-9356Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Whereas S. pneumoniae MurM and MurN (equivalent to FemX and FemA) are reported to be nonessential, MurM is essential for Î²-lactam resistance. These data argue that FemX is an excellent target for narrow spectrum antibiotic development against pathogenic bacteria that produce branched peptidoglycan. Inhibitors developed against FemX would be expected to be active in organisms in which FemX is essential (such as S. aureus) and to be effective in restoring Î²-lactam sensitivity where FemX is not essential for viability (e.g. S. pneumoniae)."

https://openalex.org/W1994817410,"Cell-specific activation of the transcription factor ÏF during the process of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis is governed by an antisigma factor SpoIIAB and an anti-antisigma factor SpoIIAA. SpoIIAB, which exists as a dimer, binds to ÏF in a complex of stoichiometry ÏFÂ·SpoIIAB2. Escape from the complex is mediated by SpoIIAA, which reacts with the complex to cause the release of free ÏF. Previous evidence indicated that Arg-20 in SpoIIAB is a contact site for both ÏF and SpoIIAA and that contact with ÏF is mediated by Arg-20 on only one of the two subunits in the ÏFÂ·SpoIIAB2 complex. Here we report the construction of heterodimers of SpoIIAB in which one subunit is wild type and the other subunit is a mutant for Arg-20. We show that the dissociation constant for the binding of ÏF to the heterodimer was similar to that for the wild type, a finding consistent with the idea that ÏF contacts Arg-20 on only one of the two subunits. Although SpoIIAA was highly effective in causing the release of ÏF from the wild type homodimer, the anti-antisigma factor had little effect on the release of ÏF from the heterodimer. This finding is consistent with a model in which SpoIIAA docks on the ÏFÂ·SpoIIAB2 complex, making contact with the subunit in which Arg-20 is not in contact with ÏF. SpoIIAB is both an anti-ÏF factor and a protein kinase that phosphorylates and thereby inactivates SpoIIAA. We show that SpoIIAA effectively displaces ÏF from a complex of ÏF with a mutant (SpoIIABR105A) that is impaired in the kinase function of SpoIIAB.

Sporulation in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis is an attractive system in which to study the problem of cell-specific gene transcription (1Stragier P. Losick R. Annu. Rev.

American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2002: 1-7Google Scholar). Sporulation involves the formation of an asymmetrically positioned septum that partitions the developing cell or sporangium into a forespore (the smaller cell) and a mother cell. The transcription factor ÏF is activated in a cell-specific manner that limits its activity to the forespore compartment of the sporangium (3Margolis P. Driks A. Losick R. Science. 1991; 254: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The activity of ÏF is governed by a pathway involving the proteins SpoIIAB, SpoIIAA, and SpoIIE (3Margolis P. Driks A.

SpoIIAB (henceforth abbreviated AB) is an anti-ÏF factor that binds to ÏF, trapping it in an inactive complex. AB is responsible for holding ÏF inactive prior to the formation of the polar septum and in the mother cell after polar division (9Duncan L. Losick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The ÏF factor escapes from the complex with AB in the forespore in a process that is mediated by the anti-antisigma factor SpoIIAA (henceforth abbreviated AA; see Refs. 12Duncan L. Alper S.

Biol. 1998; 284: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The activity of AA is, in turn, controlled by phosphorylation at Ser-58 through the opposing activities of SpoIIE, a phosphatase, and AB itself, which is both a serine protein kinase and an antisigma factor (6Arigoni F.

Here we are concerned with the mechanism by which AA mediates the release of ÏF from the complex with AB. AB is a dimer and contains an adenosine nucleotide binding pocket that can hold either ATP or ADP (9Duncan L. Losick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2325-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The binding of AB to ÏF is dependent on the presence of nucleotide in the pocket, with ATP being more effective than ADP (15Alper S. Duncan L. Losick R. Cell. 1994; 77: 195-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The complex is asymmetric, having a stoichiometry of one molecule of ÏF per dimer of AB (ÏF1Â·AB2) (16Campbell E.A. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Previous work indicated that AA reacts with the ÏFÂ·ABÂ·AB complex to induce the release of ÏF from its antagonist (12Duncan L. Alper S. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 147-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 17Garsin D.A. Paskowitz D.M. Duncan L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). An attractive model for the mechanism of this displacement reaction arose from the x-ray crystallographic studies, which revealed a potential docking site for AA on one of the two AB subunits (18Campbell E.A. Masuda S. Sun J.L. Muzzin O. Olson C.A. Wang S. Darst S.A. Cell. 2002; 108: 795-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). According to this model, AA would dock on the complex, making contact with one molecule of AB and sterically displacing ÏF from the other molecule. Previous work (13Garsin D.A. Duncan L. Paskowitz D.M. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) had identified Arg-20 of AB as a contact site for both ÏF and AA. A key feature of the docking model is that Arg-20 on one AB subunit is in contact with ÏF, whereas Arg-20 on the other subunit is exposed to solvent and is free to make contact with AA. A second residue of importance in the docking model is Glu-104 of AB, which is a contact site for AA but not for ÏF. Substitutions at Glu-104 impaired the capacity of free AB to phosphorylate AA and prevent AA from causing the release of ÏF from the ÏFÂ·ABÂ·AB complex (17Garsin D.A. Paskowitz D.M. Duncan L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here we describe the use of heterodimeric mutant forms of the AB to investigate further the docking model and other aspects of the reaction of AA with the ÏFÂ·ABÂ·AB complex. Construction of spoIIAB Expression PlasmidsâWild type and mutant forms of spoIIAB were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)/pLysS (Novagen) using an isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside-inducible phage T7 RNA polymerase system. Three kinds of expression plasmids were constructed for the purification of AB proteins as follows. An expression plasmid for the purification of untagged AB in the experiment of Fig. 1 was made by amplifying the wild type gene from pDAG14 (13Garsin D.A. Duncan L. Paskowitz D.M. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Campbell E.A. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) by PCR using oligonucleotides MH07 and MH08, which contained the restriction sites EcoRI and HindIII, respectively. The PCR product was digested with these enzymes and ligated to the expression plasmid pET-29a (Novagen), which had been similarly enzyme-treated, to create pMH13. Insertion into pET-29a joined spoIIAB to the coding sequence for an S-tag. pMH13 was introduced into E. coli strain BL21(DE3)/pLysS (Novagen) to create MHE31. Expression plasmids for the purification of His6-AB proteins were made by amplifying wild type and mutant forms of spoIIAB from pDAG14 (wild type spoIIAB gene), pMH84 (spoIIAB-E104K), pMH88 (spoIIAB-R20E), and pMH68 (spoIIAB-R105A) by PCR using oligonucleotides MH04 and MH11, which contained restriction sites for BamHI and XhoI, respectively. The PCR products were digested with these enzymes and ligated to the expression plasmid pRSETA (Invitrogen) that had been digested with these same enzymes to create pMH1 (His6-spoIIAB), pMH8 (His6-spoIIAB-E104K), pMH51 (His6-spoIIAB-R20E), and pMH54 (His6-spoIIAB-R105A). This fused the spoIIAB gene downstream and in-frame to six histidine codons in the vector. The plasmids were then transformed into BL21(DE3)/pLysS to create strains MHE08 (wild type), MHE53 (E104K mutant), MHE55 (R20E mutant), and MHE62 (R105A mutant). The co-expression plasmid for producing the ABÂ·ABR20E heterodimer was made by amplifying the wild type spoIIAB gene from pDAG14 using oligonucleotides MH04 and MH17, which contained BamHI and HindIII/EcoRI sites, respectively. (The oligonucleotide MH17 contains a HindIII site 4 bases away from the end of the EcoRI site, which was subsequently used for cloning the second mutant copy of spoIIAB gene between restriction sites HindIII and EcoRI.) The PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated to the expression plasmid pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences) that had also been treated with BamHI and EcoRI to create pMH21. This fused spoIIAB in-frame to the coding sequence for GST 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; IEF, isoelectric focusing; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; in the vector. By using pMH51 (the expression plasmid for producing His6-ABR20E) as a template, a DNA sequence containing the mutant spoIIAB, its ribosome-binding site, and the upstream histidine codons was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides MH16 and MH11, which contained the restriction sites HindIII and EcoRI, respectively. The PCR product was digested with these enzymes and ligated to HindIII/EcoRI-digested pMH21 to create pMH46. pMH46 was transformed into BL21(DE3)/pLysS to create MHE21. Construction of spoIIAC Expression PlasmidsâStrain LDE7 used for the production of ÏF in the affinity chromatography experiment of Fig. 3 was described previously (9Duncan L. Losick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2325-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The spoIIAC expression plasmid used for the experiment of Table I was constructed by amplifying the spoIIAC gene from chromosomal DNA from B. subtilis PY79 using the primers, 5â²-atggatccatggatgtggaggttaag-3â² and 5â²-atgaattccatccgtatgatccat-3â². The PCR fragment was digested by BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into the BamHI/EcoRI-digested vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) to generate pMF14 in which the ÏF-coding sequence was fused to the coding sequence for GST. pMF14 was then transformed into DH5Î± to create MHE02.Table IBinding of ÏF to homomeric and heteromeric AB dimersAnalytekonkoffKd105m-1s-110-3s-1nmABÂ·AB3.13.812ABÂ·ABR20E1.44.128ABR20EÂ·ABR20E0.0050.005Out-of-range Open table in a new tab Protein PurificationâE. coli strains used for the production of AB and ÏF were grown at 37 Â°C in 1 liter of LB containing 75 Î¼g/ml ampicillin and 25 Î¼g/ml chloramphenicol until the culture reached an A600 >0.4 (In the case of strains used for producing AB heterodimer and ÏF, only ampicillin was added to the culture.) T7 RNA polymerase synthesis was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cells were harvested 3 h later by centrifugation. Cell pellets were suspended in the appropriate binding buffer and disrupted by sonication. After sonication, the insoluble debris and the unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant fluid was collected. Four kinds of purification procedures were used for purifying AB and ÏF proteins. For purification of the untagged AB, cell pellets from strain MHE31, which produces S-tagged AB, were suspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100). The supernatant fluid was loaded onto S-protein-agarose (Novagen) for 1 h at 4 Â°C. After washing with 6 column volumes of buffer A, the S-protein-agarose bound with S-tagged AB was suspended in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2). 25 units of biotinylated thrombin were added to the agarose mixture for up to 2 h at room temperature. Untagged AB was released from the agarose during this cleavage reaction and stored in 15% glycerol at -80 Â°C. For purification of the His6-AB (wild type and mutant proteins), cell pellets from strains MHE08, MHE53, MHE55, and MHE62, which produce His6-AB, His6-ABE104K, His6-ABR20E, and His6-ABR105A respectively, were suspended in buffer C (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5 NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol) plus 5 mm imidazole. The supernatant fluid was loaded onto Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) for 1h at 4 Â°C. After washing with 6 column volumes of buffer C plus 20 mm imidazole, proteins bound to the column were eluted with buffer C plus 200 mm imidazole. Elution fractions containing the purified proteins were dialyzed into storage buffer and stored in 15% glycerol at -80 Â°C. Cell pellets from strain MHE21, which produced ABÂ·ABR20E heterodimer, were suspended in buffer C plus 5 mm imidazole. The supernatant fluid was loaded onto Ni2+-NTA-agarose for 1 h at 4 Â°C. After washing with 6 column volumes with buffer C plus 20 mm imidazole, proteins bound to the column were then eluted with buffer C plus 200 mm imidazole. Elution from Ni2+-NTA-agarose was diluted and mixed directly with glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences) with 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 Â°C. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of 1Ã PBS and eluted with buffer D (10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). The eluate was dialyzed into buffer E (0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.15 m NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm CaCl2) and treated with 50 units of thrombin. SpoIIAB heterodimers were separated from the GST tag by remixing the fraction with glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin for 1h at 4 Â°C. The flow-through from the resin contained the pure SpoIIAB heterodimer. It was stored in 15% glycerol. Cell pellets from strain MHE02-produced GST-tagged ÏF were resuspended in 1Ã PBS. The supernatant fluid was loaded onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin. The column underwent extensive washes with 1Ã PBS, and ÏF protein was released from the GST tag by cleaving the column with 50 units of thrombin in 1Ã PBS. Site-directed MutagenesisâA mutant spoIIAB encoding ABR105A was created by site-directed mutagenesis using appropriately designed oligonucleotides MH85 and MH86, pDAG14, and the Quick-Change Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Testing Subunit ExchangeâEquimolar amounts (10 Î¼m each) of AB and His6-AB were mixed and incubated at 4 Â°C for 3 h. The mixture was diluted in buffer C plus 5 mm imidazole from 50 to 500 Î¼l. 25-Î¼l resin (bed volume) was added to the 500-Î¼l mixture, and the sample was rotated on a rotator at 4 Â°C for another hour. The resin was collected by centrifugation (4000 rpm), washed with 5 column volumes of buffer C plus 20 mm imidazole, and suspended in 25 Î¼l of 2Ã SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol). Eluates from the resin were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Surface Plasmon ResonanceâKinetic and equilibrium constants of the protein-protein interactions were measured by surface plasmon resonance with a BIAcore 3000 instrument (Amersham Biosciences). To prepare the sensor chip, 80 Î¼l of anti-His antibodies (concentration 50 Î¼g/ml) diluted in 10 mm acetate, pH 4.5, were immobilized on the chip through the amino coupling procedure with HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.0005% surfactant P-20; Amersham Biosciences). The sensor surface was activated by injection of 1:1 mixture of N-hydroxysuccinimide/1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide for 8 min at 10 Î¼l/min. Anti-His antibodies were then injected at a flow rate of 5 Î¼l/min for 8 min. 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5, was injected at a flow rate of 10 Î¼l/min for 8 min to block any unreacted esters. Unbound material near the chip surface was removed by injecting 10 mm HCl at a flow rate of 10 Î¼l/min for 2 min. A sample of solution containing His6-AB, His6-ABR20E, or His6-ABÂ·ABR20E heterodimer diluted in HBS buffer was applied to one flow cell of the CM5 sensor chip already coupled with anti-His antibodies. The analyte ÏF was dialyzed into binding buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP) and injected over the sensor surface at a flow rate of 30 Î¼l/min for a total of 60 Î¼l. Concentrations of the analyte ÏF applied ranged from 20 to 200 nm. After the interaction, 50 Î¼l of 20 mm HCl was injected to regenerate the surface. Moreover, no specific interactions were observed when analyte ÏF was injected over a flow cell with immobilized anti-His antibody only. Apparent kinetic constants (kon and koff) were obtained by use of the BIAevaluation software (Amersham Biosciences). Production of [35S]Methionine-labeled ÏFâRadiolabeling of ÏF using strain MHE5 was as described by Alper et al. (15Alper S. Duncan L. Losick R. Cell. 1994; 77: 195-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) with the following changes. B1 vitamin was added to the culture (1 Î¼g/ml). The cells were grown in the presence of rifampicin for 2.5 h before labeling. Unlabeled cells were harvested before the addition of [35S]methionine, and 1 ml of the cultures was pelleted and lysed in 500 Î¼l of buffer that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Triton X-100. Affinity ChromatographyâMutant and wild type forms of AB were mixed with Ni2+-NTA-agarose (30 Î¼l of resin) for 1 h at room temperature in buffer C. The resin was collected by centrifugation (4000 rpm). 100 Î¼l of the radiolabeled ÏF was added to the resin, and the mixture (original volume of 150 Î¼l) was diluted to a volume of 500 Î¼l with buffer C. The column support bed was formed with â¼5 Î¼l of glass beads (200â300 Î¼m; Sigma, catalog number G-1277), and the column was filled with buffer C. The column bed was formed by adding the resin mixture and allowing it to settle while the column flowed by gravity. The column was then washed 5â10 times with 5 column volumes of buffer C. The column was eluted with 50 Î¼l of 1% SDS, buffer C, 8 Î¼m non-radioactive ÏF, or 8 Î¼m AA purified as described previously (13Garsin D.A. Duncan L. Paskowitz D.M. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Isoelectric FocusingâRL2220 (thrC::spoIIQ-lacZ, erm spoIIE-1::kan) was transformed with chromosomal DNA from MHB10 and selected for spectinomycin resistance to create KC365. Cells were induced to sporulate by the resuspension method (25Harwood C.R. Cutting S.M. Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 442-443Google Scholar). At indicated times after the initiation of sporulation, 1-ml samples were harvested. For isoelectric focusing (IEF) cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.1 mg/ml DNase I) and incubated at 37 Â°C for 10 min. Lysates were mixed 1:1 volume with 2Ã IEF sample buffer (8 m urea, 2.6% (v/v) ampholytes, pH 5â6 (Pharmalyte, Amersham Biosciences), 2% Triton X-100, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.04% bromphenol blue) and loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide IEF slab gel containing 8 m urea and 2.6% (v/v) ampholytes, pH 5â6 (Pharmalyte, Amersham Biosciences). The gel was run at 200 V for 30 min followed by 300 V for 2.5 h with 10 mm phosphoric acid as the anolyte and 20 mm NaOH as the catholyte. Approximately equal numbers of cells were loaded for each sample as determined by A600 at the time of harvesting. The protein was electroblotted 20 V overnight (transfer buffer was 25 mm Tris, 193 mm glycine, 20% methanol) to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) and then incubated with affinity-purified polyclonal anti-SpoIIAA antibodies raised in rabbits against SpoIIAA purified as described previously (13Garsin D.A. Duncan L. Paskowitz D.M. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Donkey anti-rabbit antibodies labeled with iodine-125 (Amersham Biosciences) were used for detection on Biomax MS film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Kinetic Measurements of Kinase ActivityâPhosphorylation reactions were carried out at 21 Â°C in 50-Î¼l reaction volumes containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP plus 5 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol), 25 nm AB. The AA concentration was varied from 62.5 nm to 2 Î¼m. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 850 Î¼l of 10% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid before the rate of phosphorylation reached a maximum. The protein was precipitated by the addition of bovine serum albumin to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid and dissolved in 1 ml of Tris base. The final sample was counted in liquid scintillation counter after adding 7 ml of scintillation fluor (Opti-Fluor, Packard Instrument Co.). The time 0 blank was subtracted from each value. ÏF-Directed Î²-Galactosidase SynthesisâpMH68 containing the spoIIAB-R105A mutation was linearized with restriction enzymes StuI and XcmI, and introduced by double recombination into the spoIIA operon of competent cells of MHB26 (thr::spoIIQ-lacZ::erm) by transformation and selection for spectinomycin resistance, creating strain MHB10. Cell pellets from MHB10 were collected at each time point from the beginning of sporulation (time 0) in resuspension medium and treated with 10 Î¼l of 20 mg/ml lysozyme at 30 Â°C for 15 min. Î²-Galactosidase activity of the sample was determined according to Harwood and Cutting (25Harwood C.R. Cutting S.M. Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 442-443Google Scholar). AB Dimer Subunits Do Not ExchangeâOur strategy for studying the contribution of each of the two subunits of ABÂ·AB to its interactions with ÏF and AA was to construct heterodimers of the antisigma factor in which one of its two subunits was a mutant for a contact site. The feasibility of such a strategy rested on the premise that ABÂ·AB is stable and hence that heteromeric dimers would not undergo subunit exchange with each other. Subunit exchange would defeat the purpose of constructing heterodimers as it would generate a mixture of homodimers and heterodimers. To investigate whether ABÂ·AB would undergo subunit exchange, we separately purified homodimers of ABÂ·AB that had been tagged with an extension of six histidine residues at its NH2 terminus (His6-ABÂ·His6-AB) and homodimers of the unmodified, wild type protein. Next, we prepared an equimolar mixture of His6-ABÂ·His6-AB and ABÂ·AB and incubated the mixture at 4 Â°C for 3 h. Finally, we recovered the histidine-tagged protein from the mixture using Ni2+-NTA-agarose. When analyzed by SDS-PAGE, material that had adhered to the resin was found to contain only His6-tagged AB (Fig. 1, lane 11; which could be distinguished from unmodified AB by its larger size). Control experiments carried out in parallel showed that His6-tagged AB bound to the resin, whereas unmodified AB did not (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 8). Conversely, little or no His6-tagged AB was present in the flow-through when either His6-AB alone (lane 3) or a mixture of His6-AB and unmodified AB (lane 10) was applied to the resin. On the other hand, unmodified AB was present in the flow-through when either the untagged protein alone (lane 7) or the mixture of tagged and untagged proteins (lane 10) were applied to the resin. We conclude that little or no His6-ABÂ·AB heterodimers had formed during the incubation period and hence that the dimer does not undergo a significant level of subunit exchange. Purification of an AB HeterodimerâArg-20 of AB was identified previously as a probable contact site both for ÏF and AA in that a loss of side chain substitution (R20A) or a replacement with a negatively charged side chain (R20E) impaired binding to either partner protein in vitro and caused high levels of ÏF activity in vivo (13Garsin D.A. Duncan L. Paskowitz D.M. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The assignment of Arg-20 as a contact site for ÏF was confirmed by the recent determination of the crystal structure of the ÏFÂ·ABÂ·AB complex (18Campbell E.A. Masuda S. Sun J.L. Muzzin O. Olson C.A. Wang S. Darst S.A. Cell. 2002; 108: 795-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The crystal structure revealed that Arg-20 on one of the two AB subunits in the complex is in contact with ÏF, whereas Arg-20 on the other subunit is exposed to solvent and hence would potentially be available as a docking site for AA. This interpretation predicts that heterodimeric AB in which one subunit is wild type and the other harbors the R20E substitution would be unimpaired in binding to ÏF. (We used R20E rather than R20A because the effect of the former substitution is more severe than that of the latter; see Refs. 13Garsin D.A. Duncan L. Paskowitz D.M. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar and 17Garsin D.A. Paskowitz D.M. Duncan L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar.) To create the heterodimer, we co-expressed the genes for the mutant and wild type protein in E. coli. The genes were arranged in tandem in a construct in which their transcription was under the control of a promoter recognized by the phage T7 RNA polymerase. The gene for the wild type protein in the construct was preceded by the coding sequence for GST as well as the coding sequence for the cleavage site for the protease thrombin, whereas the gene for the mutant protein was preceded by six histidine codons. Thus, E. coli cells harboring the construct were expected to produce GST-tagged AB and His6-tagged ABR20E. Expression of the construct was expected to generate three kinds of dimers: GST-AB homodimers, His6-ABR20E homodimers, and GST-ABÂ·His6-ABR20E heterodimers. A lysate was prepared from cells of E. coli harboring the construct, and the following procedure was used to separate the heterodimers from the homodimers and other proteins in the lysates. First, we used Ni2+-NTA-agarose to purify His6-AB homodimers and GST-ABÂ·His6-ABR20E heterodimers from the lysate. Lane 1 of Fig. 2 shows that both GST- and His6-tagged proteins had adhered to the column. Second, a glutathione-Sepharose (GST) resin was used to separate GST-ABÂ·His6-ABR20E heterodimers from the His6-AB homodimers. The purified heterodimers (Fig. 2, lane 2) were treated with thrombin to remove the GST tag, resulting in purified ABÂ·His6-ABR20E heterodimers. Finally, glutathio"

The use of antisense oligonucleotides for the CD26 mRNAs demonstrated that both events (enhanced by IL-12), CD26-CD45R0 association and membrane compartment redistribution, are related.

Samelson L.E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 242-248Google Scholar). The transmembrane tyrosine-phosphatase CD45 is essential in this process because it dephosphorylates at least the inhibitory site of Src family kinases, responsible for the phosphorylation of ITAMs (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs) (2Baker M. Gamble J. Tooze R. Higgins D. Yang F.T. O'Brien P.C. Coleman N. Pingel S. Turner M. Alexander D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4644-4654Google Scholar). This extremely active phosphatase does not require ligand binding for optimum catalytic activity; later in the process, CD45-dependent dephosphorylation of key substrates, Src, or other protein-tyrosine kinases (e.g. ZAP-70/Syk) and ITAMs must be avoided. An advance in the understanding of CD45 function was the discovery of specialized membrane domains, called rafts, ganglioside-enriched membranes (GEMs), or detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). These membranes contain a high density of sphingolipids and cholesterol (2Baker M. Gamble J. Tooze R. Higgins D. Yang F.T. O'Brien P.C. Coleman N. Pingel S. Turner M. Alexander D.R.

A compartmentation model has been proposed in which the immunological synapse initiates the clustering and stabilization of the TCR by the formation of a large lipid microdomain that accumulates (e.g. CD4 and CD8) and segregates (e.g. CD45 and LFA-1) several membrane proteins (â6). As the phosphorylation decreases within minutes after the initial response, other phosphatases (not CD45) should be recruited to these rafts later (5Thomas M.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 270-276Google Scholar). However, the role of the extracellular domain of CD45 remains elusive despite its high Mr and structure, which strongly suggest ligand-receptor interactions (6Penninger J.M. Irie-Sasaki J. Sasaki T. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 389-396Google Scholar). The diversity of the structures and sizes of different CD45 isoforms is cell type-dependent and developmentally regulated. Upon T cell activation, naive T cells switch from isoforms containing A, B, or C epitopes, with post-translational (O- and N-linked glycosylation) information, to the lowest Mr isoform, CD45R0, which lacks sequences coded by 4/A, 5/B, or 6/C exons (6Penninger J.M.

CD45â T cell lines transfected with cDNAs of different CD45 isoforms or cells from transgenic and knock-out mice had differential responses to Ag. CD45 has also been reported to associate with several surface molecules such as Thy-1, TCR, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD7, CD8, CD26, CD28, LFA-1, B cell receptor, lymphocyte phosphatase-associated protein, endoplasmic reticulum protein glucosidase II, and CD45 itself (6Penninger J.M.

As the different CD45 isoforms have similar PTP activities, these data suggest that they may interact differentially with other surface molecules that alter PTP accessibility to substrates, modifying in this way the signals received not only through Ag receptors but also through cytokine receptors and integrin-mediated adhesion, to either augment or inhibit T cell activation (9Xu Z. Weiss A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 764-771Google Scholar, 10Arroyo A.G. Campanero M.R. SaÌnchez-Mateos P. Zapata J.M. Ursa M.A. del Pozo M.A. SaÌnchez-Madrid F. J.

The surface CD26 glycoprotein is identical to dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (EC 3.4.14.5). T cells expressing high levels of CD26 constitute a subpopulation of CD45R0+ cells with helper activities in B cell Ig synthesis, proliferative responses to soluble Ags and allogeneic cells, secretion of TH1-type cytokines, and transendothelial migration capacity (13Fleischer B. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 180-184Google Scholar, 14De Meester I. Korom S. Van Damme J. ScharpeÌ S. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 367-375Google Scholar). This study describes the distribution of CD26 and CD45R0 molecules in plasma membrane microdomains of fresh and activated human T cells; it also shows that IL-12 (an inducing TH1 response cytokine) dramatically changes CD45R0 membrane compartmentation through a CD26-CD45R0 association. The significance of this finding is discussed. Cytokines, Antibodies, and ReagentsâRecombinant human IL-12 was purchased from PeproTech (London, UK). Lectin from Phaseolus vulgaris (PHA-P) was obtained from Sigma. Three different anti-human CD26s were used. Anti-CD26-FITC (or -PE) Ta1 mAb (murine IgG1) was from Coulter (Hialeah, FL), and 1F7 mAb (murine IgG1) was kindly donated by Prof. S. F. Schlossman (15Morimoto C. Torimoto Y. Levinson G. Rudd C.E. Schrieber M. Dang N.H. Letvin N.L. Schlossman S.F. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3430-3439Google Scholar). Anti-CD26 TP1/16 hybridoma, donated by Prof. F. SaÌnchez-Madrid, was obtained from a fusion with splenocytes from mice immunized with activated human T lymphocytes. Its precise specificity was studied by Western blot and immunoprecipitation as described in this report, comparing the results with those of 1F7 mAb, and by flow cytometry of cDNA-transfected (or not) Jurkat cell lines (clone 11) (16Tanaka T.

TP1/16 mAb was used as a hybridoma supernatant or purified from ascitic fluid using affinity chromatography in protein A-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences), isotyped as IgG1 (Sigma; ImmunoType mouse monoclonal antibody isotyping kit), and labeled with FITC (Sigma, Fluorotag FITC conjugation kit). F(abâ²)2 goat anti-mouse (GAM), labeled with FITC or PE, and ascitic fluid containing IgG2a and IgG1 isotype control mAbs (UPC10 and MOPC21) were purchased from Sigma. Mouse anti-human CD3 (IgG1, clone UCTH-1), CD71 (transferrin R; IgG2a, clone M-A712), CD4 (IgG1, clone RPA-T4), CD8 (IgG1, clone RPA-T8), HLA-DR (IgG2b, clone TU36), common CD45 (anti-HLe-1, IgG1, clone 2D1), which recognizes a sialic acid-independent epitope, and CD45R0 (IgG2a, clone UHTL-1) mAbs were purchased from Pharmingen or BD Biosciences. Goat anti-mouse H+L was from Caltag, and mouse anti-human CD3 (clone OKT3) mAb was kindly provided by Prof. J. R. Regueiro and Dr. A. Pacheco. Mouse anti-common CD45 (clone D3/9), CD45RA (clone RP1/11), CD45RB (MC5/2), and CD45RC (RP2/19) mAbs, used to study isoform switching, have been described previously (10Arroyo A.G. Campanero M.R.

Immunol. 1990; 20: 2667-2671Google Scholar). Cell Isolation and CultureâBuffy coats were kindly provided by the Centro de TransfusioÌn de Galicia (Santiago, Spain). Blood was donated by healthy volunteers and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by Ficoll Paque PLUS (Amersham Biosciences) density gradient centrifugation as described elsewhere (20Cordero O.J. Salgado F.J. VinÌuela J.E. Nogueira M. Immunol. Lett. 1998; 61: 7-13Google Scholar). Cells were cultured (106 PBMCs/ml) in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin, and 100 IU/ml penicillin (Sigma) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 Â°C. PBMCs were activated with 1â1.5 Î¼g/ml P. vulgaris lectin in the presence or absence of cytokines for the indicated time. The cell lines used were cultured under the same conditions except that Geneticin (100 Î¼g/ml, Sigma) was added to the medium of CD26-transfected cell lines. Inhibition of CD26 Expression with Antisense Morpholino Oligosâ Antisense morpholino oligos bound to partially complementary DNA and ethoxylated polyethileneimine (EPEI) were provided by Gene Tools as a Special Delivery Protocol kit. Morpholino subunits are assembled by phosphorodiamidate linkages to obtain an oligo with a modified non-ionic nuclease-resistant backbone. The CD26 antisense sequence, 5â²-GAACCTTCCACGGTGTCTTCATCGT-3â², was designed to bind to the target sequence in the region containing AUG of the post-spliced mRNA for the highest effectivity of translation blocking. The fluoresceinated 5â²-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3â² morpholino oligo was used as a standard control for nonspecific effects. EPEI electrostatically binds the anionic morpholino-DNA duplex, generating a cationic complex that approaches the anionic cell surface, leading to endocytosis. Subsequent acidification within the endosome increases EPEI ionization driving to membrane permeabilization and oligo release into the cytosol. The ratio of EPEI/morpholino oligos/PBMCs was tested for optimal internalization. Briefly, Morpholino-DNA duplex and EPEI (1.6 nm and 0.64 nm, final concentrations) were mixed and preincubated for 20 min in MilliQ (Millipore) water at room temperature, the mixture was added to the cells (4 Ã 106) in serum-free RPMI medium, and the samples were incubated for 3 h at 37 Â°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Cells were then washed with RPMI and cultured as described above. Immunostaining and ImmunofluorescenceâCell surface Ag expression was measured by direct or indirect immunofluorescence as described (21Cordero O.J. Salgado F.J. FernaÌndez-Alonso C.M. Herrera C. Lluis C. Franco R. Nogueira M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 920-930Google Scholar). CD45RA, CD45RB, CD45RC, and sometimes TP1/16 mAbs were used as hybridoma supernatant and revealed with FITC- or PE-labeled GAM Abs. The other Abs were applied as primary antibodies. Viable lymphocytes were identified according to their forward and right angle scattering. The percentage of cells positive for the Ag was evaluated by setting negative controls as the omission of primary antibody or the inclusion of isotype controls. Direct immunofluorescent protocol was used for two-color experiments (21Cordero O.J. Salgado F.J. FernaÌndez-Alonso C.M. Herrera C. Lluis C. Franco R. Nogueira M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 920-930Google Scholar). For studies of detergent resistance of proteins associated with rafts, the work of Janes et al. (22Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 447-461Google Scholar) was adapted to flow cytometry. Briefly, cells were treated with 1% Triton X-100 for 5 min on ice, with 10 mm methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin (MÎ²CD; Sigma), which depletes cellular cholesterol, for 15 min at 37 Â°C, or with MÎ²CD followed by Triton X-100 extraction, before fixation (3% PFA in PBS for 30 min at room temperature) and staining as described above. Samples were processed on a BD Biosciences FACScalibur cytometer, except where indicated. WinMDI software (a kind gift of J. Trotter, Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA) was used to analyze data. Protein Concentration DeterminationâThe protein concentration of samples was determined using the Bradford procedure (Sigma). Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. Membrane Phosphatase and Peptidase in Vitro AssaysâCells were washed twice in RPMI 1640 and resuspended at 3 Ã 106 cells/ml in hypotonic lysis buffer (HLB) (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 10 Î¼g/ml aprotinin) before sonication. Individual samples were made up in duplicate in the presence and absence of 1 mm Na3VO4. The membranes were sedimented from post-nuclear supernatants at 100,000 Ã g for 60 min at 4 Â°C, the resulting pellet was resuspended in 200 Î¼l HLB by sonication, and the protein concentration was determined. Plasma membrane (PM) protein (20 Î¼g) was incubated as described by Cayota et al. (23Cayota A. Vuillier F. GonzaÌlez G. Dighiero G. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1996; 104: 11-17Google Scholar) in a reaction mixture of 5 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma 104Â® substrate), 80 mm MES, pH 5.5, 10 mm EDTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol at 37 Â°C. After a 20-min incubation, reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of 0.2 n NaOH. PTP activity was expressed as absorbance units at 405 nm after removal of values of the samples duplicated in the presence of vanadate. Dipeptidyl-peptidase IV activity was measured as described previously (24Cordero O.J. Salgado F.J. VinÌuela J.E. Nogueira M. Immunobiology. 1997; 197: 522-533Google Scholar) and expressed as absorbance units at 405 nm. Briefly, PM protein (20â40 Î¼g) was incubated for 1 h at 37 Â°C in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml Gly-Pro p-nitroanilide tosylate (Sigma). Isolation of GPI-enriched Membranes by Equilibrium Density Gradient CentrifugationâThe following steps were carried out at 4 Â°C unless indicated otherwise, basically following the works of Ilangumaran et al. (25Ilangumaran S. Briol A. Hoessli D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1328: 227-236Google Scholar, 26Ilangumaran S. Arni S. van Echten-Deckert G. Borisch B. Hoessli D.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 891-905Google Scholar). Cells (50 Ã 106) were washed twice in PBS and once in TKM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA). Detergent lysates were prepared in TKM containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and the protease inhibitors Pefabloc SC (2 mm), leupeptin (10 Î¼g/ml), and aprotinin (5 Î¼g/ml) for 20 min on ice. For equilibrium gradient centrifugation, cell extracts were adjusted to 40% sucrose, loaded into SW55Ti tubes (Beckman L8-M), overlaid with 2.7 ml of 36% sucrose, and finally completed with 1.575 ml of 5% sucrose in TKM buffer. After centrifugation at 200,000 Ã g for 18 h, 450-Î¼l fractions were collected and stored at â20 Â°C. Fraction proteins were evaluated by Western blotting or immunoprecipitation or were detected by dot immunoassay. Serial dilutions in PBS (200 Î¼l) of detergent-lysates or sucrose density fractions were applied to the wells and dotted onto nitrocellulose filter sheets using a Bio-Rad dot-blot apparatus (25Ilangumaran S. Briol A. Hoessli D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1328: 227-236Google Scholar). Western Blotting Analysis and ImmunoprecipitationâDifferentially activated cells were washed in cold PBS and harvested in lysis buffer at 4 Ã 106 cells/100 Î¼l (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 10 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 5 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, and 1% Triton X-100; or alternatively, 20 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.8, 0.15 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.12% Triton X-100, and 1% digitonin as described by Torimoto et al. (27Torimoto Y. Dang N.H. Vivier E. Tanaka T. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2514-2517Google Scholar)). After 30 min on ice, nuclei and debris were removed by centrifugation at 13,000 Ã g for 15 min, and cleared lysates were assayed for protein content. Samples, normalized for total protein or for number of cells, were run on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences) for analysis with the appropriate primary Ab (TP1/16, D3/9, or UCHL-1) and HRP-labeled secondary Ab. For Western blotting with D3/9 or TP1/16 Abs, samples were treated under nonreducing conditions with SDS-PAGE buffer at 37 Â°C for 15 min. Detection was carried out by the chemiluminescent system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation studies, cell surface proteins were sometimes biotinylated following the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Briefly, 25 Ã 106 lymphocytes/ml were resuspended in PBS, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin for 30 min at room temperature. When required, the depletion of microdomain-linked proteins was carried out according to Cheng et al. (28Cheng P.C. Dykstra M.L. Mitchell R.N. Pierce S.K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1549-1560Google Scholar). Briefly, washed cells (50 Ã 106) were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution with 1 Î¼g/ml HRP-conjugated cholera toxin B subunit (which binds membrane GM1; Sigma) for 30 min at 37 Â°C. Then cells were washed twice and resuspended in 1 ml of 0.5 mg/ml 3â3â²-diaminobenzidine in Hanks' balanced salt solution with or without H2O2 for 45 min at 4 Â°C. After lysis, polymerized raft proteins were removed as described above. Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-CD26 TP1/16 (in contrast to 1F7, anti-CD26 TP1/16 was more effective with Triton than digitonin lysates), anti-CD45 D3/9, or anti-CD45R0 mAbs, previously coupled for 1 h at 4 Â°C to anti-mouse-agarose beads (Sigma; 50 Î¼l of 1:1 lysis buffer). Occasionally, precleared lysates were incubated first with antibodies. Precipitated protein was recovered by centrifugation, washed three times in lysis buffer, eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed as described above, except for the filters with biotinylated proteins, which were incubated sequentially with streptavidin, biotinylated alkaline phosphatase, and CDP-Star substrate (New England Biolabs). Developed filters were exposed on X-Omat S film (Eastman Kodak Co.) several times depending on the intensity of the signal. When needed, the blots were stripped as described elsewhere (29Mirabet M. Herrera C. Cordero O.J. Mallol J. Lluis C. Franco R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 491-502Google Scholar). Dot blots were treated as described above, except when measuring alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels. AP activity was developed directly with bromochloroindolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate (BCIP/NBT, BioRad). The spots were quantitated by scanning the filters and densitometry (ImageMaster 1D, Amersham Biosciences). Cell Proliferation and Calcium AssaysâThree-day PHA-blasts were cultured in 96-well culture plates at 1 Ã 105 cells/well in a total volume of 100 Î¼l of complete medium with/without 20% conditioned medium (medium in which PBMCs were activated previously for 3 days). In the preincubation assays, cells were cultured with the anti-CD45R0 and CD45RA Abs for 30 min before adding the cytokines, whereas in the postincubation assays, the Abs were added 30 min after the cytokines. Controls were cells incubated in the absence of cytokines. After 2 days of culture, 20 Î¼l/well CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to the plate 4 h before the absorbance was recorded at 492 nm in a Labsystems Multiskan MS plate reader. All cultures were performed in triplicate. For calcium measurements, 5 Ã 106/ml washed cells were resuspended in calcium-containing assay buffer (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgSO4,5mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2,10mm HEPES, 1 mm Na2HPO4) with 4 Î¼g/ml fluo-3-penta-acetoxymethylester (Fluo-3 AM; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in the presence of 0.025% Pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes) and 2 mm probenecidin (Sigma) for 30-45 min at 37 Â°C. After washing, cells were diluted (250,000 cells/ml) and warmed prior to use (37 Â°C for 15 min). Lymphocyte stimulation was carried out with anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 (t = 80 s) plus GAM H+L mAb (t = 280 s). Analyses were performed by flow cytometry and MFI 3.4J2 software, a kind gift of Eric Martz (Scripps Institute), for mean fluorescence intensity data. IL-12 Enhances PM CD26-CD45R0 InteractionâPreviously we reported a strong IL-12-dependent surface CD26 up-regulation on activated human T cells, including the effector/memory CD45R0 subset (25Ilangumaran S. Briol A. Hoessli D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1328: 227-236Google Scholar, 30Salgado F.J. Vela E. MartiÌn M. Franco R. Nogueira M. Cordero O.J. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 1136-1141Google Scholar). A weaker staining of these IL-12 blasts with anti-CD45R0 UCHL-1 mAb, previously observed (20Cordero O.J. Salgado F.J. VinÌuela J.E. Nogueira M. Immunol. Lett. 1998; 61: 7-13Google Scholar), is shown on the same cells (Fig. 1A). Explanations such as loss of sialylation, isoform switching, or CD45 internalization in the presence of IL-12 were ruled out (data not shown). Down-regulation was discarded, because IL-12 enhanced the levels of PM PTP enzymatic activity, which is â¼90% CD45-specific (31Mustelin T. Coggeshall K.M. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6302-6306Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Because CD26 is known to associate with CD45 (6Penninger J.M. Irie-Sasaki J. Sasaki T. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 389-396Google Scholar, 7Johnson P. Maiti A. Ng D.H.W. Herzenberg L.A. Blackwell C.

Fig. 1C shows that, in the presence of IL-12 together with the expected CD26 up-regulation, anti-CD26 TP1/16 mAb also coprecipitates more CD45 (the two low Mr isoforms). In consonance with the above result, neither CD45 nor R0 Ags (which were surface biotinylated) were down-regulated by IL-12. The nature of the coprecipitated bands is confirmed later on in this article. An attractive model to explain these results is that IL-12 is up-regulating a certain type of CD26 expression (already existing; see Fig. 1C) that induces interaction with CD45R0 and/or other molecules and masks the anti-R0 Ab epitope. Thus, as observed in Fig. 1, UCHL-1 could precipitate only the free CD45. CD26 and CD45 Are Present in PM Microdomains, and Their Distribution Changes with T Cell Activation in the Presence or Absence of IL-12âCD26 was found in GEMs (4Horejsi V. Drbal K. Cebecauer M. Cerny J. Brdicka T. Angelisova P. Stockinger H. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 356-361Google Scholar) of mouse T cell lines (25Ilangumaran S. Briol A. Hoessli D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1328: 227-236Google Scholar, 26Ilangumaran S. Arni S. van Echten-Deckert G. Borisch B. Hoessli D.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 891-905Google Scholar) and porcine lung (32Parkin E.T. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 887-896Google Scholar). We considered a possible relationship between the CD26-CD45R0 association and GEMs/PM rafts. The well known GPI-anchored (32Parkin E.T. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 887-896Google Scholar) AP was used as a control for microdomain purification by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation. AP was detected in the light density fractions (LDF) (Fig. 2A, lanes 4â6). Transferrin R (CD71) was used as control for soluble, non-raft protein (data not shown). The dual distribution of CD26, with â¼28% of the material detected in the LDF and 51% in the heavy density fractions (HDF) (Fig. 2A, lanes 10 and 11) of the sucrose gradient, is shown in human T cells (because monocytes and B and NK cells from PBMCs are essentially CD26â) (Fig. 2C). In activated T cells, in addition to a higher intensity, CD26 was redistributed to the GEMs (37% in LDF and 30% in HDF, percentages that are in agreement with data from mouse T cell line (25Ilangumaran S. Briol A. Hoessli D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1328: 227-236Google Scholar), indicating the activated status of T cells). IL-12 enhanced CD26 intensity and enriched the intermediate fractions (33 and 26%, respectively in LDF and HDF, n = 4; Fig. 2, C and F). Note that there is more CD26 than the well described CD4 glycoprotein (which shows a bipolar pattern) in the rafts. In fact, CD26 is present in almost all sucrose gradient fractions, including fraction 3 (AP and CD4 are not detected in this fraction) (Fig. 2B). As described previously in a murine T cell lymphoma (25Ilangumaran S. Briol A. Hoessli D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1328: 227-236Google Scholar) but not in Jurkat or B cells (22Janes P.W.

https://openalex.org/W2072526818,"Glutamine synthetase (GS) regulation in Escherichia coli by reversible covalent modification cycles is a prototype of signal transduction by enzyme cascades. Such enzyme cascades are known to exhibit ultrasensitive response to primary stimuli and act as signal integration systems. Here, we have quantified GS bicyclic cascade based on steady state analysis by evaluating Hill coefficient. We demonstrate that adenylylation of GS with glutamine as input is insensitive to total enzyme concentrations of GS, uridylyltransferase/uridylyl-removing enzyme, regulatory protein PII, and adenylyltransferase/adenylyl-removing enzyme. This robust response of GS adenylylation is also observed for change in system parameters. From numerical analyses, we show that the robust ultrasensitive response of bicyclic cascade is because of allosteric interactions of glutamine and 2-ketoglutarate, bifunctionality of converter enzymes, and closed loop bicyclic cascade structure. By system level quantification of the GS bicyclic cascade, we conclude that such a robust response may help the cell in adapting to different carbon and nitrogen status.

Living organisms have complex regulatory systems to sense, adapt, and survive in different environments, thus maintaining homeostasis. The complex signal transduction systems tend to increase the robustness (insensitivity) of organisms to variations in environmental conditions and system parameters (1Csete M.E. Doyle J.C.

Robustness and sensitivity in signal transduction systems are possible mechanisms for adaptation (3Kitano H. Foundations of Systems Biology. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA2001: 1-39Google Scholar). Covalent modification cycles and allosteric interactions are important mechanisms involved in signal transduction (9Cohen P. Control of Enzyme Activity. Chapman and Hall, London1983Crossref Google Scholar). Interconverting enzymes are covalently modified and demodified by independent converter enzymes or by a same bifunctional (ambiguous) enzyme in a covalent modification cycle. Theoretical analyses of these interconvertible enzyme cascades have shown that enzyme cascades exhibit a potential for signal amplification, flexibility, and ultrasensitivity (5Goldbeter A.

The regulation of glutamine synthetase enzyme in Escherichia coli, a well characterized bicyclic cascade system, is attributed to interconvertible enzymes, bifunctional modifying enzymes, and allosteric interactions on these enzymes. Here, we have developed a steady state model of this system to generate stimulus/response curves for fractional modification of glutamine synthetase to varying input stimuli. The stimulus/response curve of a typical Michaelis-Menten enzyme is hyperbolic and requires an 81-fold change in the input stimulus for a 10â90% change in the output response. Ultrasensitive enzyme requires <81-fold change in the input stimulus for a 10â90% change in the output response; thus, stimulus/response curve is steeper than hyperbolic curve. A subsensitive enzyme requires >81-fold increase in the input stimulus for the same effect (5Goldbeter A. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Most often in nature, the physiological responses are known to be ultrasensitive (21Aon M.A. Gomez-Casati D.F. Iglesias A.A. Cortassa S. Cell Biol. Int. 2001; 25: 1091-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The existence of ultrasensitivity in covalent modification cycles is the result of operation of enzymes in a region of saturation with respect to their substances termed as zero order sensitivity (5Goldbeter A.

Glutamine synthetase (GS) 1The abbreviations used are: GS, glutamine synthetase; ATase, adenylyltransferase; AR, adenylyl-removing enzyme; PII, signal transduction protein PII; UTase, uridylyltransferase; UR, uridylyl-removing enzyme; 2KG, 2-ketoglutarate; GLN, glutamine. of Escherichia coli plays a vital role in nitrogen assimilation under nitrogen starvation conditions (9Cohen P. Control of Enzyme Activity. Chapman and Hall, London1983Crossref Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes the formation of glutamine from glutamate and ammonia. Its activity is regulated by reversible covalent modification cycles and by cumulative feedback inhibition (9Cohen P. Control of Enzyme Activity. Chapman and Hall, London1983Crossref Google Scholar, 26Rhee S.G. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 37-92PubMed Google Scholar, 27Stadtman E.R. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1980; 49: 813-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Reversible covalent adenylylation and biosynthesis of GS share a common mechanism for sensing intracellular nitrogen status (29Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. Cornish-Bowden A. Cardenas M.L. Control of Metabolic Processes. Plenum Press, New York1990: 183-194Crossref Google Scholar). Because of these multiple regulation mechanisms, GS activity is highly controlled and rapidly adjustable to different environmental stimuli (28Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 813-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Therefore, GS has been a prototype of signal transduction by enzyme cascades since four decades (27Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44357-44364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Glutamine synthetase covalent modification is a closed bicyclic cascade of two protein nucleotidylylation cycles (reviewed in Refs. 26Rhee S.G. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 37-92PubMed Google Scholar and 28Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 813-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In one cycle, glutamine synthetase is reversibly adenylylated to an inactive form (in absence of Mn(II)) and deadenylylated to active form by a bifunctional enzyme adenylyltransferase/adenylyl-removing enzyme (ATase/AR). While in a second cycle, regulatory protein PII is reversibly uridylylated and deuridylylated by another bifunctional enzyme uridylyltransferase/uridylyl-removing enzyme (UTase/UR). These two cycles are connected in a manner that the unmodified protein PII activates adenylylation of GS and uridylylated PII (PII-UMP) activates deadenylylation of GS, thus converting it to a more active form. Stadtman and co-workers (29Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. Cornish-Bowden A. Cardenas M.L. Control of Metabolic Processes. Plenum Press, New York1990: 183-194Crossref Google Scholar, 30Rhee S.G. Park R. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3138-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have shown by theoretical analysis of GS regulatory cascade that the interconvertible enzyme cascade is endowed with remarkable flexibility, rate amplification, signal amplification potential, and sensitivity. In addition to theoretical analysis, it has been proved experimentally that covalent modification of dodecameric enzyme GS is not an all-or-none process (28Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 813-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 29Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. Cornish-Bowden A. Cardenas M.L. Control of Metabolic Processes. Plenum Press, New York1990: 183-194Crossref Google Scholar). GS subunits are adenylylated/deadenylylated independently, and under most physiological conditions, GS activity is inversely proportional to the number of adenylylated subunits per dodecamer. The steady state level of GS adenylylation varies from 0 to 12, and this depends upon the nutritional state of the organism, primarily on glutamine and 2-ketoglutarate concentrations as confirmed by in situ experiments (31Mura U. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 13022-13029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in vivo studies (32Senior P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 123: 407-418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the steady state GS activity can be achieved by modulating the concentration of the known carbon and nitrogen effectors (30Rhee S.G. Park R. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3138-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 31Mura U. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol.

Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 161: 319-327Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recently, Ortega et al. (18Ortega F. Acerenza L. Westerhoff H.V. Mas F. Cascante M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1170-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) challenged the zero order ultrasensitivity mechanism in covalent modification cycles by showing that zero order ultrasensitivity is lost if the modifying enzyme is strongly product-sensitive and ambiguous (bifunctional). They correlated these results with in vivo experiments of GS cascade sensitivity (34van Heeswijk, W. C. (1998) The Glutamine Synthetase Adenylylation Cascade: A Search for Its Control and Regulation. Ph.D. thesis, University of Amsterdam, AmsterdamGoogle Scholar) where a change in concentration of regulatory protein PII did not affect the nonadenylylated glutamine synthetase concentration. In subsequent work, Ortega et al. (35Ortega F. Ehrenberg M. Acerenza L. Westerhoff H.V. Mas F. Cascante M. Mol. Biol. Rep. 2002; 29: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) clarified that the degree of modification of target molecule can exhibit ultrasensitivity to change in total rather than free effector concentration that decide whether a bifunctional enzyme acts as a modifier or demodifier. Product inhibition per se has not been demonstrated experimentally in vivo in E. coli glutamine synthetase cascade, but allosteric regulation to control the glutamine synthetase activity has been well documented (26Rhee S.G. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 37-92PubMed Google Scholar, 27Stadtman E.R. J. Biol.

The main objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of bifunctionality and allosteric interaction of effectors, glutamine, and 2-ketoglutarate on the response of GS bicyclic cascade at steady state using new insights from recent experimental work on reconstituted GS enzyme system. We solved the steady state equations for GS cascade numerically and found the predicted dose/response curve for GS adenylylation to be sigmoidal and represented by the Hill equation. From the theoretical analysis, we show that the GS system responds with robust ultrasensitivity to a varying concentration of modifying and interconvertible enzymes of GS bicyclic cascade. Furthermore, we investigate the reason for robustness of the system toward varying parameters. We conclude from our analysis that bifunctional modifying enzymes and allosteric interactions on modifying and interconvertible enzymes with closed loop cascade structure render robustness to the ultrasensitive performance of GS system. Model of GS Cascade StructureâGlutamine synthetase cascade regulation modeling framework is schematically shown in Fig. 1. In this analysis, the concentration of metabolites ATP, UTP, PPi, and Mg2+ is considered to be invariant. Regulation of GS enzyme involves two reversible nucleotidylylation cycles (PII uridylylation/deuridylylation and GS adenylylation/deadenylylation) with two bifunctional converter enzymes, UTase and ATase. Modified (uridylylated) and unmodified PII connect the two cycles to make a closed loop bicylic cascade. A large number of metabolites affect these modification and demodification steps in both the cycles, among which glutamine and 2-ketoglutarate (2KG) play a dominant role as signals of intracellular nitrogen and carbon, respectively (26Rhee S.G. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 37-92PubMed Google Scholar). Glutamine inhibits the uridylylation of PII and deadenylylation of GS by allosteric interaction, whereas it stimulates deuridylylation of PII-UMP and adenylylation of GS (37Ninfa A.J. Jiang P. Atkinson M.R. Peliska J.A. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 2000; 36: 31-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). PII is a homotrimeric protein and has been found to act as a sensor of the carbon signal, 2KG, by directly binding to it (38Kamberov E.S. Atkinson M.R. Ninfa A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17797-17807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 39Jiang P. Peliska J.A. Ninfa A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12782-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We have assumed that free PII without the binding of 2KG cannot be uridylylated, and furthermore, three molecules of 2KG can bind to PII with negative cooperativity (39Jiang P. Peliska J.A. Ninfa A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12782-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 40Ninfa A.J. Atkinson M.R. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 172-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). 2KG-bound PII species (i.e. PII-2KG, PII-(2KG)2, and PII-(2KG)3) can go through the uridylylation/deuridylylation cycle. PII bound with only one 2KG molecule is active in terms of activation of ATase for adenylylation of GS. The deadenylylation of GS by ATase requires 2KG-bound PII-UMP, whereas glutamine inhibits deadenylylation of GS by inactivating ATase-PII-UMP-2KG complex. Studies have indicated that PII can be uridylylated to PII-UMP and can form a combination of PII-(UMP)2 and PII-(UMP)3 species bound with 1â3 numbers of 2KG molecules depending on 2KG concentration (37Ninfa A.J. Jiang P. Atkinson M.R. Peliska J.A. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 2000; 36: 31-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 40Ninfa A.J. Atkinson M.R. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 172-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 41Jiang P. Peliska J.A. Ninfa A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12802-12810Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Here, we have assumed that all of these species can activate ATase to deadenylylate GS-AMP. It can also be noted from Fig. 1 that in the case of cells under rich carbon and poor nitrogen sources, PII will mainly exist as the uridylylated form of PII-2KG, PII-(2KG)2, and PII-(2KG)3, which would further activate deadenylylation of GS-AMP, resulting in active GS. In the case of cells under poor carbon and rich nitrogen sources, PII will mainly exist as unmodified PII-2KG and will activate adenylylation of GS. Thus, the structure shown in Fig. 1 representing GS regulation qualitatively correlates with known response to carbon and nitrogen status. Supplemental Table 1 lists the steady state equations for covalent modification cycles, equilibrium relationships for allosteric interactions, and mass balance equations for total species. These equations were solved numerically using Fsolve program of MATLAB (The Math-Works Inc.). The accuracy of the simulation was verified by numerically checking the mass balance of all of the species. The simulations were carried out for estimating the fractions of GS-AMP formed for particular glutamine and fixed 2KG concentration. We found that the predicted dose/response curves for adenylylation of GS are sigmoidal on semilogarithmic plots. These predicted curves of fractional output response (f) to a given input (I) are similar in shape to those given by the Hill type equation of the form as shown in Equation 1, f=InHK0.5nH+InH(Eq. 1) where n H is the Hill coefficient, I is the free concentration of input signal, and K 0.5 is the half-saturation constant. Thus, the steepness of the dose/response curves can be characterized by the Hill coefficient (42Koshland Jr., D.E. Nemethy G. Filmer D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar) using the expression shown in Equation 2, nH=log(81)log(I0.9/I0.1)(Eq. 2) where I 0.9 and I 0.1 are input required for 90 and 10% output response, respectively. Supplemental Table 1 also lists the parameters used in the simulations, and most of the kinetic/equilibrium constants were taken from the literature (32Senior P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 123: 407-418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Kamberov E.S. Atkinson M.R. Ninfa A.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12802-12810Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Estimated reaction rate parameters were individually varied over a wide range, and the system response was analyzed. Reaction rate constants were screened to get a best fit to the half-saturation constant for GS adenylylation from the data taken from literature (39Jiang P. Peliska J.A. Ninfa A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12782-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The enzyme concentrations are referred from the work of Ninfa et al. (37Ninfa A.J. Jiang P. Atkinson M.R. Peliska J.A. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 2000; 36: 31-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and Rhee et al. (30Rhee S.G. Park R. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3138-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The data taken from the literature consider Mg2+ as sole divalent metal ion in the reaction. We compared our simulation results with the dose/response curves of GS adenylylation at various total glutamine concentrations reported by Ninfa et al. (37Ninfa A.J. Jiang P. Atkinson M.R. Peliska J.A. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 2000; 36: 31-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) on reconstituted GS enzyme system. In this work, we have assumed that the total glutamine concentration is nearly equal to its free concentration; hence, we can validate the sensitivity of the response using Hill coefficient. The steady state model was used to quantify the sensitivity of GS adenylylation with respect to glutamine as input at various concentrations of bifunctional modifying and interconvertible enzymes (UTase, ATase, PII, and GS). The response was ultrasensitive with a Hill coefficient of approximately 1.8â2 (i.e. approximately, a 9-fold change in the stimulus is required for a 10â90% change in the output response) and was invariant to changes in the total PII, ATase, and GS enzyme concentrations (Fig. 2 A). However, Hill coefficient varied from 2 to â¼5.5 with increasing total UTase enzyme concentration. A similar analysis at various total 2KG concentrations also yielded an invariant Hill coefficient of 2. The sensitivity of the response was also robust to changes in the parameter values such as dissociation constant, kinetic constant, and so on. Thus, the steepness of dose/response curves obtained for glutamine as input and GS adenylylation as output was invariant at various component enzyme concentrations and 2KG concentration (results not shown). The previous experimental and theoretical studies on GS system have reported a Hill coefficient value of â¼1.5 (29Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. Cornish-Bowden A. Cardenas M.L. Control of Metabolic Processes. Plenum Press, New York1990: 183-194Crossref Google Scholar, 30Rhee S.G. Park R. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3138-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Besides Hill coefficient, the half-saturation constant (K 0.5) quantifies the response by indicating the concentration of glutamine required for 50% adenylylation of GS. K 0.5 increases with an increase in 2KG concentration, and the results are in agreement with reported in vitro studies by Jiang et al. (41Jiang P. Peliska J.A. Ninfa A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12802-12810Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) on reconstituted GS system (Fig. 2B). The value of K 0.5 was invariant with varying PII, GS, and ATase concentrations. However, K 0.5 increased with an increase in UTase/UR concentration but to a much lower extent than that of the 2KG (results not shown). Although the sensitivity was invariant to system parameters, K 0.5 was highly dependent on changes in parameter values. Fig. 3A shows the dose/response curves for effect of 2KG concentration on GS adenylylation at various glutamine concentrations. A higher concentration of 2KG was required to activate the GS system with increasing glutamine concentration. At a low concentration of glutamine (â¼50 Î¼m), GS was active even at a very low 2KG concentration. Fig. 3B shows the performance of uridylylation cycle at various glutamine and 2KG concentrations when complete bicyclic cascade of GS was simulated. The uridylylated form of PII was largely insensitive to 2KG concentration and more dependent on glutamine. However, the unmodified PII concentration was sensitive to both glutamine as well as 2KG concentration. At high concentrations of both glutamine and 2KG, PII will mainly exist as inactive PII-(KG)2 and PII-(KG)3 as indicated by Fig. 3B, curves a and e. Thus, in such an instance, our analysis shows that the signals of carbon and nitrogen status are not transmitted to the second GS cycle. It can also be noted from Fig. 3B that a specific ratio of unmodified PII to uridylylated PII (i.e. PII/PII-UMP) exists at a given 2KG and glutamine concentration. This ratio was found to be mainly dependent on glutamine. From our studies, it appears that the GS system responds strongly to the carbon and nitrogen status of the cell and is invariant to the system variables/parameters. What is the reason for such a robust response of GS cascade to changes in enzyme concentrations and system parameters? To understand this behavior, we have analyzed a simple monocyclic cascade with allosteric interactions, representative of the second cascade in the GS system as shown in Fig. 4. The steady state equations are given in Supplemental Table 2 and were solved using parameters given in Supplemental Table 1 as explained for the GS cascade. If the total concentrations of B and P (converting enzymes in the cycle) are altered independently, the fractional modification of interconvertible enzyme (G) demonstrates zero order sensitivity (Fig. 4, curves aâc). This is a well known result as illustrated by Koshland and co-workers (5Goldbeter A. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6840-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 6Koshland Jr., D.E. Goldbeter A. Stock J.B. Science. 1982; 217: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 12Goldbeter A. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14441-14447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When we consider that B and P are related through an effector such as PII and PII-UMP in GS cascade related through glutamine, the zero order effect is compromised as shown by Fig. 4, curve d). At steady state, the rate expression for the modification and demodification of enzyme cascade given in Fig. 4 is shown in Equation 3. k33ÃBxÃGKm3=k44ÃPÃHKm4(Eq. 3) Simplifying for Bx in terms of its dissociation constant (K 5), the free glutamine concentration (x) can be given as shown in Equation 4, x=n2ÃHGÃ1B/P(Eq. 4) where n 2 = (k 44 Ã K m3 Ã K 5)/(k 33 Ã K m4). If Bt and Pt are independently fixed, Equation 4 illustrates that the sensitivity is dependent on Bt, Pt, and Gt with zero order effects. Now if B and P are related through an effector x linearly as B/P = x/n 1, Equation 4 can be written as Equation 5. x2=n1Ãn2ÃHG(Eq. 5) For simplicity, if Gt = G + H, then for f = H/Gt we obtain Equation 6. xt(f=0.9)=n1Ãn2Ã9andxt(f=0.1)=(n1Ãn2)/9(Eq. 6) In such a case, using Equation 2, we obtain a Hill coefficient of 2, irrespective of the parameter values embedded in n 1 and n 2. Also, the sensitivity in this case is independent of the total enzyme concentrations, Gt and Bt. The half-saturation constant K 0.5 in this case can be given as x t(f=0.5) = (n 1 Ã n 2)0.5 and is therefore related to the system parameter values present in n 1 and n 2. Thus, by linking the ratio of B to P through an effector, the response is rendered ultrasensitive and robust. Reversible covalent modification cycles in combination with allosteric interactions are known to yield highly ultrasensitive response (5Goldbeter A. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6840-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 10Stadtman E.R. Chock P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2761-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 11Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2766-2770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Goldbeter A. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14441-14447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we demonstrate that such cascades can also respond with robustness. The results obtained from the analysis are summarized in Fig. 5. In the GS bicyclic cascade, the output of PII uridylylation cycle is a function of allosteric effectors, which act as inputs to the system. Unmodified PII allosterically interacts with 2KG, and in such a case, more glutamine was required to demodify PII. The uridylylation cascade thus acts as a signal integrator and was subsensitive (results not shown). The uridylylated form of PII was a strong function of glutamine, whereas the unmodified form of PII was a function of both glutamine and 2KG. These unmodified and modified forms of PII act as inputs to the GS adenylylation and deadenylylation cycles, respectively. Thus, the output of GS adenylylation cycle was dependent directly on glutamine and indirectly on 2KG concentrations. The net response of GS adenylylation was robust because of bifunctionality of ATase and UTase, allosteric interactions of effectors, and closed loop bicyclic cascade structure. As compared with ATase, another bifunctional enzyme UTase/UR was not under the influence of closed loop. Therefore, the GS system response shows zero order effects at higher concentration of UTase/UR. Such a high concentration of UTase/UR may not be relevant in vivo. It is noteworthy that for E. coli grown under derepressed conditions, UTase/UR concentration is â¼400-fold less than GS concentration under similar conditions. This represents the pyramidal relationship of enzyme concentration (GS, 411; PII, 42; ATase, 2.6; UTase/UR, 1) in GS cascade system known to be responsible for efficient performance of the cascade (29Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. Cornish-Bowden A. Cardenas M.L. Control of Metabolic Processes. Plenum Press, New York1990: 183-194Crossref Google Scholar). The robust ultrasensitive response of GS can thus be quantified by Equation 7, f=(GLN)2(K0.5)2+(GLN)2(Eq. 7) where f is fractional adenylylation of GS and K 0.5 is glutamine (GLN) concentration required for 50% GS adenylylation. The value of K 0.5 was mainly dependent on 2KG and system parameter values. The genetic regulation of GS synthesis is also regulated by PII and 2KG (26Rhee S.G. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 37-92PubMed Google Scholar, 29Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. Cornish-Bowden A. Cardenas M.L. Control of Metabolic Processes. Plenum Press, New York1990: 183-194Crossref Google Scholar, 37Ninfa A.J. Jiang P. Atkinson M.R. Peliska J.A. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 2000; 36: 31-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Our analysis has shown that the response of GS adenylylation was insensitive to total GS concentration. We postulate that even the response of the GS synthesis cycle may depend only on the effector concentration. Thus, the synthesis and activity of GS may depend on the carbon (2KG) and nitrogen (glutamine) status of the cell alone. Our results are consistent with reported experimental observations. (i) According to Jiang et al. (41Jiang P. Peliska J.A. Ninfa A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12802-12810Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and Rhee et al. (30Rhee S.G. Park R. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3138-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the effect of glutamine on GS adenylylation shows approximately a linear change in half-saturation constant at various 2KG concentrations. (ii) According to Rhee et al. (30Rhee S.G. Park R. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3138-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the GS adenylylation dose response curves for glutamine as input show cooperative-like behavior with a Hill coefficient of â¼1.5. (iii) As analyzed by van Heeswijik (34van Heeswijk, W. C. (1998) The Glutamine Synthetase Adenylylation Cascade: A Search for Its Control and Regulation. Ph.D. thesis, University of Amsterdam, AmsterdamGoogle Scholar), the variation of total PII concentration did not influence the adenylylation of GS. Ortega et al. (18Ortega F. Acerenza L. Westerhoff H.V. Mas F. Cascante M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1170-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have argued that this insensitivity is because of product inhibition and bifunctionality. Here we have shown that this effect is attributed to specific allosteric interactions, bifunctionality, and closed loop bicyclic cascade structure. We have extended this result and shown that adenylylation of GS is not influenced by the variation, not only in the total PII but also in total GS, ATase, and UTase/UR under in vivo conditions. (iv) As presented under âResults,â our model correlates well with various hypothetical observations made by Ninfa et al. (37Ninfa A.J. Jiang P. Atkinson M.R. Peliska J.A. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 2000; 36: 31-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Robustness is an important issue in sensitivity analysis of biological system, because it provides an in depth understanding of the response of the system to internal failures and environmental changes. Various biological systems have been shown to respond with robustness to system parameters and environmental perturbations (reviewed in Refs. 3Kitano H. Foundations of Systems Biology. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA2001: 1-39Google Scholar and 4Morohashi M. Winn A.E. Borisuk M.T. Bolouri H. Doyle J. Kitano H. J. Theor. Biol. 2002; 216: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) because of feed forward control and redundancy in system components. In this work, we have used the term ârobustnessâ to describe the constant output response of GS system to various system parameters (such as kinetic constants and so on) and change in concentration of system components (PII, ATase, and GS). Although the system does respond with a constant Hill coefficient, the half-saturation constant K 0.5 was sensitive to changes. It can be emphasized that the ultrasensitive robust response of GS system is the result of cascade network topology and regulatory architecture. Does this ultrasensitive robust response of GS system exist inside the cell? The significance of this behavior of enzyme cascade has to be studied further. From available details, it can be postulated that GS cascade has the necessary components for exhibiting robustness and ultrasensitivity. As explained above, allosteric regulation of ambiguous and interconverting enzymes impart structural stability to the GS cascade. GlnK, a PII-like protein, has been shown to exist in E. coli and appears to be designed to function under the condition of nitrogen starvation (43Van Heeswijk W.C. Hoving S. Molenaar D. Stegeman B. Kahn D. Westerhoff H.V. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 44Atkinson M.R. Ninfa A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 45van Heeswijk W.C. Wen D. Clancy P. Jaggi R. Ollis D.L. Westerhoff H.V. Vasudevan S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3942-3947Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is possible that this protein may provide redundancy, a property of robustness to GS cascade system. The ultrasensitive robust response of E. coli GS cascade shown by our simulations for glutamine and 2KG as inputs may be important under nitrogen starvation conditions, because E. coli do not require dedicated response of all-or-none as also shown by the experiments (26Rhee S.G. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 37-92PubMed Google Scholar, 29Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. Cornish-Bowden A. Cardenas M.L. Control of Metabolic Processes. Plenum Press, New York1990: 183-194Crossref Google Scholar) (see Addendum), whereas Huang and Ferrell (17Huang C.-Y.F. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10078-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) and Ferrell and Machleder (20Ferrell Jr., J.E. Machleder E.M. Science. 1998; 280: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar) demonstrate that in a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade system, a dedicated response is essential for the oocyte to decide on the question of maturation. In such cases, a switch-like ultrasensitive response from a cascade system is necessary. System level understanding and quantification are vital for analyzing signal transduction pathways (3Kitano H. Foundations of Systems Biology. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA2001: 1-39Google Scholar, 47Kitano H. Science. 2002; 295: 1662-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3091) Google Scholar). The mathematical and computational modeling by integrating different formalisms can help in uncovering the behavioral complexity of biological systems. Through such an analysis, we have demonstrated that the likely function of enzyme cascades might be to provide robustness other than imparting ultrasensitivity toward environmental perturbations. AddendumâBatchelor and Goulian (46Batchelor E. Goulian M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) have recently reported robustness in EnvZ/OmpR (covalent modification cycle, two-component regulatory) system of E. coli. They found that when EnvZ concentration is lower than OmpR, steady state level of phosphorylated OmpR is insensitive to variation in the EnvZ and OmpR concentration. This work not only supports our work presented here but also suggests that two-component regulatory system of GS synthesis (i.e. NRI/NRII cycle) may also respond with robustness to change in component enzyme concentrations.

https://openalex.org/W2039209188,"Compared with folded structures, natively unfolded protein domains are over-represented in protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. Such domains are common features of all colicins and are required for their translocation across the outer membrane of the target Escherichia coli cell. All of these domains bind to at least one periplasmic protein of the Tol or Ton family. Similar domains are found in Ton-dependent outer membrane transporters, indicating they may interact in a related manner. In this article we have studied binding of the colicin N translocation domain to its periplasmic receptor TolA, by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) using fluorescent probes attached to engineered cysteine residues and NMR techniques. The domain exhibits a random coil circular dichroism spectrum. However, FRET revealed that guanidinium hydrochloride denaturation caused increases in all measured intramolecular distances showing that, although natively unfolded, the domain is not extended. Furthermore NMR reported a compact hydrodynamic radius of 18 A. Nevertheless the FRET-derived distances changed upon binding to TolA indicating a significant structural rearrangement. Using 1H-15N NMR we show that, when bound, the peptide switches from a disordered state to an ordered state. The kinetics of binding and the associated structural change were measured by stopped-flow methods, and both events appear to occur simultaneously. The data therefore suggest that this molecular recognition involves the concerted binding and folding of a flexible but collapsed state."

In the present study we have analyzed the mechanism of c-Jun function as a transactivator with respect to members of the basal transcription machinery, TATA-binding protein-associated factors (TAFs). We show that one member of the family, human TAF7 (formerly TAFII55), physically interacts with c-Jun through two independent interaction domains, within the N- and C-terminal part of c-Jun. Interaction in vitro correlates with enhanced transactivation function of c-Jun in HEK293 and COS cells in the presence of increasing amounts of TAF7. TAF7 interacts preferentially with DNA-bound phosphorylated c-Jun, suggesting that TAF7 represents a novel c-Jun co-activator mediating activation of AP-1 target genes in response to extracellular signals. c-Jun is a member of the AP-1 family of transcription factors regulating expression of specific target genes in a variety of cellular processes including proliferation, stress response, and tumorigenicity.

The AP-1 family of leucine zipper proteins is composed of Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2), Jun (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD), and ATF proteins, which can form a variety of functional dimers (for review see Ref. 1Angel P.

Both gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches in tissue culture and in mice have established specific and essential functions of the various subunits in a number of processes ranging from cell survival, proliferation, oncogenic growth, cell death, neuronal excitation, and chronic inflammation to the cellular defense against toxicity (for reviews see Refs. 2Angel P.

During this broad spectrum of important cellular processes, AP-1 activity is subject to rigorous and complex regulation at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Regulatory signals by growth factors, oncoproteins, proinflammatory cytokines, and environmental stresses are transmitted to AP-1 by various signaling pathways, including those utilizing specific members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, such as extracellular signal-regulated kinases, JNKs, 1The abbreviations used are: JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; bZIP, basic region and leucine zipper domain; CBP, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; TBP, TATA binding protein; TAF, TBP-associated factor(s); CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus.1The abbreviations used are: JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; bZIP, basic region and leucine zipper domain; CBP, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; TBP, TATA binding protein; TAF, TBP-associated factor(s); CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus. and p38 (8Karin M.

Much is known about the events that lead to their activation. Both the signal transduction pathways and the molecular events regulating the transcriptional potential of these factors are well described. Particularly, phosphorylation sites and their function are in many cases well defined, like N-terminal phosphorylation of c-Jun at serines 63 and 73 by the Jun N-terminal kinases (9Binetruy B. Smeal T. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 351: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). c-Jun interacts with many other transcription factors, which modulate AP-1-dependent activity, such as steroid hormone receptors (10Herrlich P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2465-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), Smads (11Qing J. Zhang Y. Derynck R. J. Biol.

The interaction of c-Jun with co-factors of transcription bearing intrinsic acetyltransferase activity, like CBP (13Lee J.S. See R.H. Deng T. Shi Y. Mol. Cell.

J. 1995; 305: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), provides evidence for a cross-talk between c-Jun and the basal transcription/chromatin remodeling machinery. Despite this detailed knowledge on signaling cascades and interacting factors, neither the mechanism of how hyperphosphorylation is âtranslatedâ into increased RNA synthesis nor the players involved in the process of transactivation, potentially including components of the basal transcription machinery, have been identified conclusively. Among the activities involved in transcriptional regulation of eukaryotic protein-coding genes the factor TFIID plays a particularly central role. Mammalian TFIID consists of TBP and 13 TBP-associated factors (TAFs) (for review see Refs. 17Albright S. Tjian R. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 1-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 18Bell B.

Cell Res. 1999; 246: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Evidence that TAFIIs function as co-activators in eukaryotic cells has come from the investigation of the role of hsTAF11 (formerly TAFII28), hsTAF10 (formerly TAFII30), and hsTAF4 (formerly TAFII135) in transcriptional activation by several transactivators, mainly by nuclear receptors (20Brou C.

Further evidence that TAFs are required for transcriptional activation in vivo derives from genetic studies in Drosophila (23Pham A.D. Muller S. Sauer F. Mech. Dev. 1999; 84: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), Caenorhabditis elegans (24Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K.

We show the importance of their synergistic interaction, which is mediated through the N- and C-terminal domains of c-Jun.

Cell Culture and TransfectionâCOS and HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and used for transfections. For transient expression assays, the cells were seeded at 30% confluency and transfected by the calcium phosphate method. 2 Î¼g of the Î²-galactosidase expression plasmid pCH110 (Pharmacia Corp.) was used to normalize for transfection efficiencies, and the total amount of DNA was kept constant at 20 Î¼g/plate with the use of pSG5 plasmid (Ref. 40Zoumpourlis V.

The experiments were repeated at least three times. c-Jun Interacts with TAF7 (TAFII55) in Vitro and in VivoâTo identify cellular proteins involved in mediation of the transactivation function of c-Jun, we searched for the potential interaction partners of c-Jun in TFIID, using recombinant baculovirus expression vectors to express TAFs and TBP (Fig. 1A, right panel). First, in vitro protein-protein interactions were performed using baculovirus expressed, recombinant human TBP and TAFs (TAF1, TAF4, TAF5, TAF6, TAF7, and TAF15) and bacterially expressed recombinant GST-c-Jun (1â79; Fig. 1A) encoding the minimal transactivation domain of c-Jun. In agreement with previous reports (16Franklin C.C. McCulloch A.V. Kraft A.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), recombinant TBP was bound by immobilized GST-c-Jun (Fig. 1B, right panel). Similarly, TAF7, but none of the TAFs tested here, showed a detectable physical interaction with c-Jun (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Under these conditions, TAF7 also interacted with the GST control. However, this interaction was much weaker compared with that with GST-c-Jun1â79. These data show that under these conditions in addition to TBP, only one of the analyzed TAF family members, TAF7, was able to interact with the N-terminal region of c-Jun in vitro. Note that under different interaction conditions another TFIID component, TAF1, can also bind to c-Jun in vitro (14Lively T. Ferguson H. Galasinski S. Seto A. Goodrich J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25582-25588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To confirm the physical interaction between TAF7 and c-Jun proteins in living cells, immunoprecipitation assays combined with Western blotting were performed using extracts from transiently transfected COS cells (Fig. 2A). The cells received the B10-hTAFII55 plasmid expressing human TAF7 protein tagged with the B10 epitope (lanes 1 and 4), the RSV c-Jun expression vector encoding wild-type c-Jun (lanes 2 and 5), or both (lanes 3, 6, and 7). After transfection total cell extracts were prepared and expression of c-Jun (Fig. 2B, upper panel), and B10-tagged TAF7 (Fig. 2B, lower panel) was confirmed by Western blot. To demonstrate the c-Jun/TAF7 interaction, c-Jun-containing protein complexes were immunoprecipitated using an anti-c-Jun antisera (Fig. 2A, lanes 4â6), and the amount of co-precipitated TAF7 was determined by Western blot, using the anti-B10 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A (lane 4), significant amounts of TAF7 interacting with endogenous c-Jun can be co-precipitated, which is further amplified in cells overexpressing c-Jun (Fig. 2A, lane 6). Immunoprecipitation of the same samples using an anti-Ras antisera as a negative control showed that TAF7 was not co-precipitated unspecifically under these conditions (Fig. 2A, lanes 1â3). These data show that TAF7 specifically interacts with c-Jun both in vitro and in vivo. c-Jun-dependent Transcriptional Activation Is Increased by TAF7âTo determine whether co-expression of TAF7 further increases c-Jun-dependent activity of AP-1-dependent promoters, transactivation experiments with c-Jun-responsive promoters fused to luciferase or CAT reporters were performed in COS and HEK 293 cells. In COS cells transfected with the standard AP-1-dependent reporter gene 5xcoll TRE-luc containing five synthetic AP1 sites, c-Jun had an almost 4-fold effect on transactivation of the reporter that was further enhanced about 4-fold upon ectopic overexpression of TAF7 (Fig. 3A). Expression of the TATA-luc reporter lacking AP-1 sites, which was used as a negative control, was affected by neither c-Jun nor TAF7 nor overexpression of both. These data show that the TAF7-induced enhancement of 5xcoll-TRE-luc reporter gene expression was specifically mediated through c-Jun rather than by a general effect on components of the basal transcriptional machinery. Similar to the 5xcoll-TRE-luc construct expression of the âclassicalâ AP-1-dependent reporter â73/63 CollCAT was increased about 5-fold by c-Jun (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2), which was further enhanced in the presence of increasing amounts of TAF7 (Fig. 3B, lanes 3â5). When we analyzed the promoters/enhancer units of thymidine kinase or RSV-LTR, whose high basal activity is not affected by c-Jun overexpression, 2P. Angel and T. Oehler, unpublished observation. no major changes in activity of these regulatory units were detected (Fig. 3B, lanes 6â9, and data not shown). These data show that the series of transcription factors regulating the activity of these potent promoters were not affected by TAF7. Co-transfection of expression vectors encoding other TAFs (i.e. TAF12) did not influence the activation of the reporters by c-Jun (data not shown), confirming our data obtained by in vitro interaction of recombinant proteins. These data demonstrate that TAF7 interacts with c-Jun and positively influences the transcriptional activation by c-Jun. c-Jun Contains Two Binding Sites for TAF7âPrevious findings showed an interaction between TBP or p300 with both the N- and C-terminal halves of c-Jun (27Dunphy E. Johnson T. Auerbach S.S. Wang E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1134-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 43Vries R.G. Prudenziatti M. Zwartjes C. Verlaan M. Kalkhoven E. Zantema A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6095-6103Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to test whether in addition to the N-terminal domain the DNA-binding domain of c-Jun could also participate in an interaction with TAF7. To answer this question, GST pull-down assays followed by Western blot analysis were performed using protein extracts from 293 cells transiently transfected with a hsTAF7 expression vector. In agreement with the data on in vitro interaction of recombinant hsTAF7 and c-Jun N terminus (Fig. 1), using a GST fusion protein containing the N-terminal part of c-Jun (amino acids 1â166) as a bait, significant amounts of hsTAF7 could be pulled down (Fig. 4A, lane 3). A GST-c-Jun fusion protein containing amino acids 1â79 of c-Jun was less efficient. In contrast, GST alone did not pull down detectable levels of hsTAF7 (lane 1), confirming specificity of interaction. Interestingly, compared with the transactivation domain, the C-terminal part of c-Jun bZip containing the DNA-binding region was even more efficient in hsTAF7 pull down (lane 2). These data suggest that in addition to the N terminus, the C-terminal part of c-Jun is able to interact with hsTAF7. The potent binding of hsTAF7 to the bZip sequence of c-Jun can be explained by direct interaction or by heterodimer formation of c-Jun with a hsTAF7-loaded dimerization partner. To distinguish between these two possibilities and to define the structural requirements of c-Jun required for hsTAF7 interaction in more detail, GST pull-down assays were performed with in vitro transcribed and translated c-Jun proteins (Fig. 4, C, lanes 1â5, and D, lanes 1, 2, 7, and 8) and GST fusion proteins containing the full-length hsTAF7 protein (Fig. 4B, lane 3). As shown in Fig. 4C, 35S-labeled wild-type and mutant c-Jun proteins containing an intact bZip region were efficiently bound to GST-hsTAF7 (lanes 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14). Even the minimal DNA-binding domain of c-Jun (amino acids 224â331) was precipitated as efficiently as the wild-type protein (lanes 6 and 12). As a negative control a GST fusion protein containing a small part of the N-terminal region of avian c-Jun, which completely lacks the transactivation domain, was used (Fig. 4, B, lane 6, Î6â91, and C, lanes 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15). This protein precipitated the various Jun proteins with only very low efficiency. These data show that the region of c-Jun spanning amino acids 224â331 is able to interact with TAF7 independently of a dimerization partner. Moreover, this domain acts independently from the hsTAF7 interaction domain in the N terminus. This is further supported by the very efficient precipitation of a GHF1-c-Jun fusion protein composed of the DNA-binding domain of c-Jun and the transactivation domain of the transcription factor GHF1/Pit1 (Fig. 4D, lanes 5 and 6). Analysis of additional c-Jun mutants revealed that in the absence of the N terminus, the leucine zipper region is required for c-Jun/TAF7 interaction (Fig. 4D). Deletion of this region in a c-Jun mutant containing only the basic domain (c-Jun basicD; amino acids 221â288) led to a complete loss of complex formation (lanes 3 and 4). Moreover, the Jun-TAF7 interaction was similarly lost upon replacement of the c-Jun leucine zipper by the corresponding region of GCN4 (GLZ, lanes 11 and 12). Together these results suggest that dimerization is not sufficient for hsTAF7 binding but rather relies on c-Jun-specific sequences of the leucine zipper domain. hsTAF7 Interacts Preferentially with DNA-bound Phosphorylated c-Jun in VivoâHaving defined hsTAF7 interaction regions in the N- and C-terminal parts of c-Jun, we wanted to know whether this interaction could be modulated by the phosphorylation events that regulate the activity of the c-Jun transactivation domain. To address this question, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with a c-Jun expression vector to increase c-Jun levels in the cell (Fig. 5A, lanes 3 and 4). To efficiently generate phosphorylated c-Jun, the cells were treated with the alkylating agent MMS, which is one of the most potent inducers of the JNK pathway (42van Dam H. Huguier S. Kooistra K. Baguet J. Vial E. van der Eb A.J. Herrlich P. Angel P. Castellazi M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1227-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 39Wilhelm D. Bender K. Knebel A. Angel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4792-4800Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). When we analyzed phosphorylation of c-Jun at serines 63 and 73 by Western blot using a phosphospecific antibody (lanes 5â8), a low level of spontaneous c-Jun phosphorylation was observed in transfected cells already in the absence of MMS treatment (lane 7), which was possibly induced in response to the transfection procedure. Phosphorylation was drastically increased in both untransfected (lane 6) and c-Jun overexpressing cells (lane 8) in response to treatment with MMS. A significant percentage of c-Jun exhibits a slower electrophoretic mobility, which is caused by hyperphosphorylation of c-Jun at serines 63 and 73, as well as threonines 89 and 91 (34Hagmeyer B.M. Konig H. Herr I. Offringa R. Zantema A. van der Eb A. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3559-3572Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 36van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1995; 18: 1798-1811Crossref Scopus (569) Google Scholar). These slower migrating forms are also detectable in MMS-treated c-Jun overexpressing cells using the antibody, which recognizes both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of c-Jun (lane 4, marked by an asterisk). When we incubated GST-hsTAF7 protein with extracts from untreated c-Jun overexpressing cells, a significant amount of c-Jun was retained (Fig. 5B, lane 2). The amount of TAF7-bound c-Jun is not significantly increased when extracts from MMS-treated cells were used (lane 3). These data were obtained in the presence of an oligonucleotide comprising a mutated AP-1 binding site. However, when we included an excess of oligonucleotides representing a wild-type AP-1 binding site in the binding reaction, the level of TAF7-bound c-Jun was increased when comparing with untreated cells (lane 4). Thus, in the presence of wild-type AP-1 binding sites, the amount of co-precipitated Jun was strongly increased (compare lanes 3 and 5). Particularly, the slower migrating, hyperphosphorylated form of c-Jun became preferentially bound to GST-hsTAF7 (lane 5). These data strongly suggest that c-Jun and hsTAF7 interact in solution regardless of the phosphorylation status of c-Jun. DNA binding of Jun may induce a conformational change of the N terminus, making this transactivation domain susceptible for phosphorylation-dependent binding of TAF7. Transcriptional activation by sequence-specific activators can be mediated via TAFs, through interaction between transactivation domains and the TAFs (21Jacq X. Brou C. Lutz Y. Davidson I. Chambon P. Tora L. Cell. 1994; 79: 107-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 44Goodrich J.A. Hoey T. Thut C.J. Admon A. Tjian R.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3093-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, there is not much known about how and whether these interactions participate in vivo in the regulation of specific target genes. Here we describe novel interactions in vitro and in living cells between the hsTAF7 component of TFIID and the transcriptional activator c-Jun, a member of AP-1 family of transcription factors. Under these conditions c-Jun did not interact with other TAFs, and strong promoter/enhancer units, which are controlled in a c-Jun-independent manner, were not affected, showing selectivity of interaction. TAF7 protein contains almost 40% of charged residues and has been shown to interact with Sp1, USF, YY1, and CTF transactivators in solution interaction studies but not with NF-ÎºB p50 subunit (60Chiang C.-M. Roeder R. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Thus, similar to other c-Jun-interacting proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, such as CBP/p300 (41Bannister A.J. Oehler T. Wilhelm D. Angel P. Kouzarides T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2509-2514PubMed Google Scholar, 46Benkoussa M. Brand C. Delmotte M.H. Formstecher P. Lefebvre P. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31853-31859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and ASC proteins (48Jung D.J. Sung H.S. Goo Y.W. Lee H.M. Park O.K. Jung S.Y. Lim J. Kim H.J. Lee S.K. Kim T.S. Lee J.W. Lee Y.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5203-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), this highly charged protein potentially represents a central component of transcription factor cross-talk that interacts under various cell and/or promoter context with multiple molecules sharing subtle commonality in structure. TAF7 interacts with two independent sites in the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of c-Jun. The first one comprises the dimerization domain, adjacent to the basic DNA-binding domain, referred as the âleucine zipperâ (49Kouzarides T. Ziff E. Nature. 1988; 336: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). In the absence of the N-terminal interaction domain, either deletion or replacement of the leucine zipper results in a complete loss of interaction. Previously, a number of other structurally unrelated cellular proteins including NF-AT, members of the Ets and Smad protein families, and p300 have been identified that interact with the DNA-binding domain of bZip proteins, including c-Jun (for review see Ref. 50Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2438-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, c-Jun/TAF7 interaction significantly differs from complex formation of Jun with these proteins. First, c-Jun/TAF7 complexes were detectable in the absence of DNA, whereas Jun-NFAT interactions rely on the presence of adjacent binding sites. In contrast to Jun/NF-AT, interactions between Ets and Jun proteins are formed in a DNA-independent manner. However, interaction is mediated through the basic region of c-Jun (50Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2438-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Similarly, the basic domain of c-Jun is involved in p300 interaction (43Vries R.G. Prudenziatti M. Zwartjes C. Verlaan M. Kalkhoven E. Zantema A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6095-6103Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the case of Smad proteins, amino acid substitutions, which interfere with homodimerization of Jun or ATF-2, also interfere with Smad interaction (51Sano Y. Harada J. Tashiro S. Gotoh-Mandeville R. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8949-8957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Whether this interference is due to the requirement of specific amino acid sequences in the leucine zipper domain (as found for c-Jun/TAF7 interaction) or to the general loss of dimerization remains to be determined. Structural analysis of TAF7/c-Jun complexes will be required to determine in more detail the structural features of interaction. What are the possible functions of TAF7 binding to the leucine zipper region of c-Jun? A potential mechanism of cooperativity between c-Jun leucine zipper domain and TAF7 includes the stabilization of specific heterodimers, thus providing selective dimerization between specific AP-1 subunits in the cell. Interestingly, synergistic interactions of Jun complexes with non-bZIP DNA-binding proteins, like NF-AT, Ets, and Smad family members are mediated through their DNA-binding domains, extending the recognition specificity of the complex, as compared with the individual components (for review see Ref. 50Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2438-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). An additional function of TAF7 binding to the bZIP domain of c-Jun may reside in prevention of this domain for binding to negatively acting factors, such as steroid hormone receptors (10Herrlich P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2465-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Although ternary complexes containing Jun and non-bZIP proteins stably associate with DNA, at present it is still unclear whether or not TAF7 remains associated with the bZIP region of c-Jun upon DNA binding. We have preliminary unpublished data that in vitro interaction between TAF7 and a recombinant c-Jun mutant lacking the N terminus (c-JunÎ6â223) is reduced in the presence of wild-type but not mutant AP-1 binding sites. Clearly, following c-Jun-mediated recruitment of TAF7 to AP-1 binding sites, liberation of TAF7 from the bZIP domain of c-Jun upon DNA binding will enhance the local concentration of TAF7 and support its interaction with the N-terminal transactivation domain of c-Jun. Our GST pull-down assays suggest that the site of interaction between TAF7 and the transactivation domain of c-Jun is localized between amino acids 1 and 166. Although deletion of amino acids 119â166 did not affect complex formation, 3C. Munz and P. Angel, unpublished observation. loss of the region between amino acids 79 and 118 reduced Jun/TAF7 interaction. Interestingly, these sequences overlap with the previously described a1 and [epsis ] regions (52Baichwal V.R. Park A. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1493-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) also known as region III (33Oehler T. Angel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5508-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which functionally cooperate with upstream sequences containing the JNK phosphorylation sites Ser63 and Ser73. Neither the nature of the factor(s) binding to these regions nor the mechanisms of how these factors mediate the transactivation potential of c-Jun have been defined. Possibly, TAF7 directly binds to two sites located between amino acids 1â79 and 79â116. However, we consider this possibility unlikely, because these regions of c-Jun did not interact with TAF7 produced in bacteria or by in vitro transcription/translation (data not shown). Only recombinant TAF7 produced in insect cells or protein extracts from mammalian cells expressing TAF7 yielded efficient co-precipitation. These data suggest that one more additional factor associating with TAF7 is required for complex formation. This bridging factor might bind directly to c-Jun. On the other hand, it is also possible that post-translational modification of TAF7 contributes to c-Jun/TAF7 interaction. Importantly, binding of TAF7 to the TAD of Jun was greatly enhanced in extracts from MMS-treated cells in the presence of wild-type but not mutant AP-1 binding sites. Under these conditions, the majority of Jun appears to be in a DNA-bound status (53Papavassiliou A.G. Chavrier C. Bohmann D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11562-11565Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We propose a model where changes in the DNA-binding domain of c-Jun upon DNA binding leads to conformational change in the N terminus supporting binding of TAF7 to the transactivation domain of c-Jun. Several examples of conformational changes of transcription factors have been reported that are important for their activity, e.g. Ets (54Greenall A. Willingham N. Cheung E. Boam D. Sharrocks A. J.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), ATF-2 (56Sano Y. Tokitou F. Dai P. Maekawa T. Yamamoto T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29098-29105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and c-Jun (57Oehler T. Pintzas A. Stumm S. Darling A. Gillespie D. Angel P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1141-1147PubMed Google Scholar), where auto-inhibition by cis-acting modules is relieved by DNA-binding, post-translational modifications or the binding to other co-regulatory proteins. Binding of TAF7 to the N terminus of c-Jun is most efficient on c-Jun molecules, which underwent strong hyperphosphorylation at multiple serine and threonine residues in response to stress signaling. Enhanced binding of TAF7 might keep the c-Jun protein in an âopenâ active conformation by unmasking inhibitory sequences. By that, binding of additional factors, such as the phosphoisomerase Pin1, which specifically binds to hyperphosphorylated c-Jun and whose activity is required for JNK-mediated, c-Jun-dependent transcription of cyclin D1 (58Wulf G.M. Ryo A. Wulf G.G. Lee S.W. Niu T. Petkova V. Lu K.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3459-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), might be supported. Alternatively, phosphorylation-dependent interaction of c-Jun with other activators or co-factors of transcription with histone acetyltransferase activity, like p300/CBP (59Arias J. Alberts A.S. Brindle P. Claret F.X. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montiminy M. Nature. 1994; 370: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), facilitates opening of chromatin structures. Subsequent interaction of c-Jun with TFIID components, like TAF7, stabilizes TFIID and enables more efficient initiation of transcription process. Although the role of TAFs in transcription is not entirely understood, additional interactions of c-Jun with TAF7 may well contribute to transactivation through AP-1 responsive elements. These inducible functional interactions with co-factors like TAFs can allow extracellular signal regulated transactivators, like c-Jun, to integrate these signals in basal transcription machinery in a promoter-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2094625158,"We have identified a cDNA (named C114) that encodes novel transcripts induced by IL-11 in mouse 3T3 L1 cells. Northern analysis of RNAs from multiple mouse tissues detects two C114 transcripts of â¼1.0 and â¼2.0 kb with the highest expression in liver, testis, brain, and kidney. The C114 cDNA contains an open reading frame of 187 amino acids with a predicted mass of 21 kDa. Three putative nuclear localization signals are predicted at amino acids 83â88, 126â131, and 167â178. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-C114 fusion plasmids, amino acids 126â131 are shown to be essential for the nuclear localization of C114. An arginine-rich region (amino acids 98â143) spanning the nuclear localization signals (amino acids 126â131) exhibits a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding activity. Competition experiments with different RNA homopolymers demonstrate that C114 preferentially binds to poly(IÂ·C). Similar to other dsRNA-binding proteins, C114 binds to the dsRNA-activated protein kinase, protein kinase R (PKR), via dsRNA-binding domains of PKR and the N-terminal region of the C114 protein. In vitro kinase assays indicate that C114 inhibits PKR activation via a dsRNA-independent mechanism. Overexpression of C114 protein inhibits the induction of eIF-2Î± phosphorylation following poly(IÂ·C) treatment.

IL-11 is a bone marrow fibroblast-derived cytokine with a variety of in vitro biological activities within the hematopoietic, lymphopoietic, hepatic, adipose, bone, and neuronal systems. It was originally isolated from a primate bone marrow-derived stromal cell line based on its ability to stimulate the proliferation of an IL-6-dependent mouse plasmacytoma cell line, T1165 (1Paul S.R. Bennett F. Calvetti J.A. Kelleher K. Wood C.R. O'Hara Jr., R.M. Cleary A.C. Sibley B. Clark S.C. Williams D.A. Yang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Takiguchi Y. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) isolated a cDNA encoding a novel adipogenesis inhibitory factor that inhibits adipogenesis of mouse 3T3 L1 cells. The cDNA sequence of this factor is identical to IL-11 (2Kawashima I. Ohsumi J. Mito-Honjo K. Shimoda-Takano K. Ishikawa H. Sakakibara S. Miyadai K. Takiguchi Y. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Using biological assays and 125I-IL-11 binding analysis, we previously demonstrated the existence of functional IL-11 receptors on 3T3 L1 mouse preadipocytes (3Yin T. Miyazawa K. Yang Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8347-8351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the participation of IL-11 in diverse physiological processes, its precise role in cell growth and differentiation remains unclear. Protein kinase R (PKR) 1The abbreviations used are: PKR, protein kinase R; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; DRBD, dsRNA-binding domains; PACT, PKR activating protein; TRBP, HIV-1 transactivating response RNA-binding protein. is a 68-kDa serine/threonine kinase that manifests two distinct kinase activities, one for its own phosphorylation and the other for the phosphorylation of other substrates. Once activated, PKR becomes autophosphorylated and acquires the capacity to phosphorylate its well studied substrate, eIF-2Î±. Phosphorylation of eIF-2Î± inhibits protein synthesis by impairing the activity of guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF-2B (4Williams B.R. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/89/re2)PubMed Google Scholar). As a serine/threonine kinase found in a latent state in most cells, it plays an important role in cellular antiviral defense. In addition, PKR has been implicated in other cellular processes including apoptosis (5Deb A. Haque S.J. Mogensen T.H. Silverman R.H. Williams B.R.G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6170-6180Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), cellular transformation (6Meurs E.F. Galabru J. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Hovanessian A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PKR also functions as a signal transducer in signaling pathways activated by different stimuli, including dsRNA, IL-3, interferon-Î±, interferon-Î³, IL-1, tumor necrosis factor, and platelet-derived growth factor, through a variety of effectors including NF-ÎºB, IRF-1, ATF-2, STAT3, and eIF-2Î± (4Williams B.R. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/89/re2)PubMed Google Scholar, 11Deb A. Zamanian-Daryoush M. Xu Z. Kadereit S. Williams B.R.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2487-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although PKR has been implicated in different cytokine actions, its involvement in IL-11 signaling has not been reported. Meanwhile, the physiological events and signaling pathways that trigger PKR activation by cellular RNA or proteins are not well established (4Williams B.R. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/89/re2)PubMed Google Scholar). Several PKR modulators have been identified. PKR inhibitors include cellular proteins such as P58, HIV-1 transactivating response (TAR) RNA-binding protein (TRBP), ribosomal protein L18, and NF90 and its homologues (12Benkirane M. Neuvent C.

On the other hand, other cellular proteins such as PKR activating protein (PACT) and PKR associate protein X (RAX) function as PKR activators (15Patel R.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4379-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Many of these proteins also contain well defined dsRNA-binding domains (DRBDs). In this study, we identified a novel IL-11-inducible transcript, C114, in 3T3 L1 cells. C114 is a nuclear protein exhibiting higher expression in the nucleolus. C114 interacts with dsRNA and also binds and inhibits the activity of PKR. We propose that this novel cellular protein acts as a negative regulator of PKR. Antibodies and Reagentsâ3T3 L1, NIH-3T3, and HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Anti-FLAG monoclonal M2 antibody was from Sigma, and anti-V5 monoclonal antibody was from Invitrogen. The anti-eIF-2Î± and phosphospecific anti-eIF-2Î± antibodies were from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). Recombinant human IL-11 was kindly provided by Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). Various polynucleotide resins were from Amersham Biosciences. PCR-based cDNA SubtractionâTotal cellular RNA was isolated from starved or IL-11-stimulated (500 ng/ml) mouse 3T3 L1 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and poly(A) RNA was purified using oligo(dT) beads (Invitrogen). cDNA synthesis and subtraction were done using PCR-Select cDNA subtraction kit (Clontech) following manufacturer's instructions. mRNA of IL-11-treated 3T3 L1 cells was used as a tester, and mRNA of untreated cells was used as a driver. Subtracted PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) to obtain a subtraction library. DNA fragments were prepared from individual cDNA clones by PCR and used as [Î±-32P]dCTP-labeled hybridization probes for Northern blot analysis. Total RNA extracted from IL-11-treated or untreated 3T3 L1 cells was prepared as mentioned above. RNA was electrophoresed in a 1.0% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences). After a cDNA fragment was confirmed by Northern blot to show a differential expression pattern, the full-length cDNA was cloned from a mouse liver cDNA library (Stratagene) by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Poly(A)+ RNA blot of mouse tissues (Mouse MTN blot, Clontech) was also used for Northern analysis. Cellular Localization of C114 ProteinâThe entire coding region and various mutant forms of C114 cDNA were amplified by PCR using primers containing a EcoRI or BamHI site and cloned into pEGFP (Clontech) so that the coding sequence continued in-frame with that of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). These pC114-EGFP hybrid plasmids were transfected into NIH 3T3 cells by LipofectAMINE transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were grown at 37 Â°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum for 48 h and examined by fluorescence microscopy to detect the distribution of C114-EGFP proteins. Mock pEGFP vector and mitochondrial protein-fused EGFP constructs were also transfected into NIH 3T3 cells. Polynucleotide Binding StudiesâIn vitro transcription/translation reaction of C114 was carried out using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (16Coolidge C.J. Patton J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1407-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Radio-labeled C114 protein was incubated with various resins (Amersham Biosciences), which were first washed and resuspended in wash buffer 1 (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol, 4 mm Mg(C2H3O2)2Â·4H2O, 200 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Equal aliquots of 35S-labeled C114 protein were added to 40 Î¼l of a 1:1 volume of each resin and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 30 min. The resins were spun down, washed three times with 500 Î¼l of wash buffer 1, and washed twice with 500 Î¼l of wash buffer 2 (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol, 4 mm Mg(C2H3O2)2Â·4H2O, 50 mm KCl). The proteins bound to beads after the wash were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. For quantitation, bound proteins were eluted by the addition of an equal volume of 2Ã Laemmli loading buffer, and equal aliquots were subjected to scintillation counting to determine the amount of proteins bound to each resin. For analysis, the percentage of proteins bound to each resin was calculated, taking into consideration the specific activity of each deletion construct, and comparison was made relative to the levels of the wild-type protein bound to each resin. For competitive binding studies, analyses were performed as above in the presence of competitor polynucleotides. Various concentrations of competitors (either poly(IÂ·C) or poly(dIÂ·dC)) ranging from 0.05 to 100 Î¼g were added to the in vitro translated 35S-labeled C114 protein followed by the addition of resins. Analysis of bound proteins was carried out as above. Construction of Eukaryotic Expression Vector Encoding C114 with a FLAG EpitopeâTo generate a FLAG epitope-tagged version of C114 for expression in mammalian cells, the coding region of C114 was amplified by PCR from C114/pGEM-T using 5â²-AGGAATTCTATGGCGAGTCCTGCTGCC-3â² and 5â²-ACGGATCCTCGCCCCATGATGACGAC-3â² as the forward and reverse primer with a BamHI and EcoRI restriction site, respectively. The 600-bp PCR product was ligated in-frame with a FLAG tag into the pCMV-2 vector. Co-immunoprecipitationâHEK 293 cells were transfected with FLAG epitope-tagged C114 in pCMV-2, FLAG-tagged PACT, and/or V5-tagged PKR in Vet vector (described in Refs. 15Patel R.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4379-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar and 17Goh K.C. deVeer M.J. Williams B.R.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4292-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl containing 1% Triton X-100. Cellular debris was removed by spinning at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Lysates were incubated with either M2 anti-FLAG (Sigma) or anti-V5 (Invitrogen) and Protein A-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) overnight at 4 Â°C. The immunocomplexes were washed with lysis buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with monoclonal anti-V5 or anti-FLAG (1:5,000) followed by appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences). Pull-down Assaysâ35S-labeled wild-type or mutated forms of PKR were in vitro translated using TnT-coupled reticulocyte system from Promega (18Feng G.S. Chong K. Kumar A. Williams B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5447-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). FLAG epitope-tagged C114 protein was immunoprecipitated from transfected HEK 293 cell lysates with the M2 anti-FLAG (Sigma) and Protein A-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described above. Twenty Î¼l of the in vitro translated 35S-labeled proteins was incubated with FLAG-tagged C114 protein in immunocomplexes containing Protein A-agarose and anti-FLAG antibody in 500 Î¼l of pull-down buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) at 4 Â°C for 2 h. The resin was washed four times with 500 Î¼l of pull-down buffer. Proteins were eluted with 40 Î¼l of Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transblotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane followed by autoradiography and processed for Western blotting with M2 anti-FLAG antibody. Five Î¼l of in vitro translated 35S-labeled proteins was also resolved by SDS-PAGE to visualize the input proteins. Kinase AssaysâHEK 293 cells were transfected with V5-tagged PKR constructs. In some samples, PKR-expressing plasmid was co-transfected with various forms of FLAG-tagged C114 plasmids (see Fig. 2B). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and lysed in an equal volume of lysis buffer. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatants were collected. PKR was immunoprecipitated from aliquots containing 100 Î¼g of total protein using an anti-V5 monoclonal antibody in radio-immune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) at 4 Â°C overnight. Protein A-agarose was added for an additional hour followed by washing four times with 500 Î¼l of TNEN buffer (20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 Î¼M vanadate, 1 mm NaF, pH 8.0) and twice with activity buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 200 units/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5% glycerol). The immune complex containing PKR was incubated with activity buffer containing 1 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP at room temperature for 30 min. One Î¼g/ml poly(IÂ·C) or 1 unit/ml heparin was added as a PKR activator. In some samples, kinase activities were assayed in the presence of the affinity-purified wild-type or mutant form IV of C114 protein. Labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography and Western blotting. Partial Purification of FLAG-C114 ProteinsâHEK 293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type or the mutant form IV of C114 protein (see Fig. 2B). Cells expressing FLAG-tagged fusion proteins were harvested and lysed as described above. The clear lysate was then applied to the anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) and Protein A-agarose for overnight incubation at 4 Â°C. The agarose beads were then washed three times with Tris-buffered saline buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 mm NaCl). Bound FLAG-tagged fusion protein was eluted with six 1-ml aliquots of FLAG peptide (Sigma) at 0.1 mg/ml in Tris-buffered saline, washed, and concentrated by centrifugation in Centricon 10 (Amicon), and purified FLAG-tagged fusion proteins were rinsed and dissolved in kinase activity buffer. Cloning of Mouse C114 âC114 was cloned using PCR-based cDNA subtraction strategy from 3T3 L1 cells treated with human IL-11 (500 ng/ml) for 30 min. Northern blot analysis confirmed induction of C114 expression in IL-11-treated 3T3 L1 cells as early as 30 min and persisting for 24 h (Fig. 1A). Sequencing of C114 revealed that it is identical to several expressed sequence tags deposited in GenBankâ¢. To obtain the full-length cDNA sequence for C114, PCR-based rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed using a mouse liver cDNA library based on the overlapping sequences of several mouse expressed sequence tags. The full-length cDNA contains an open reading frame of 561 bp, which encodes a 187-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 21 kDa. The deduced protein sequence contains three putative nuclear localization signals, a basic amino acid-rich region, as well as a highly acidic amino acid tail at its C terminus (Fig. 1B). An identical full-length sequence has since been submitted by others (GenBankâ¢ accession number AK010961). C114 also shares a very high sequence homology with a recently submitted human hypothetical protein FLJ13902 (GenBankâ¢ accession number AK023964). The striking similarity (91% identity at the amino acid level) suggests that FLJ13902 is likely a human counterpart of mouse C114. Sequence alignment with the human genome data base revealed that the human FLJ13902 gene consists of four exons and is localized at human chromosome 7q22.1. C114 protein also has significant homology with two other proteins with unknown functions from Caenorhabditis elegans and yeast (GenBankâ¢ accession numbers AE003808 and P41880). Northern blot analysis of mRNA prepared from mouse tissues showed that C114 mRNA is widely expressed in mouse tissues with higher abundance in liver, kidney, brain, and heart and low expression in lung and skeletal muscle (Fig. 1C). Two major C114 transcripts of 1.0 and 2.0 kb were detected in most tissues. The length of the cloned cDNA corresponds to the size of the shorter transcript. Cellular Localization of the C114 ProteinâTo elucidate possible functions of C114, we examined the cellular localization of the C114 protein. The C114 cDNA was fused in-frame into the N or C terminus of EGFP in the pEGFP vector, which expresses a green fluorescent protein to facilitate protein localization in living cells by confocal microscopy. Addition of C114 to pEGFP resulted in a nuclear localization of the C114 fusion protein with enrichment in the nucleolus (Fig. 2A, panel c). In contrast, the green fluorescent signal distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells transfected with pEGFP plasmid (Fig. 2A, panel a), whereas the signal was detected in mitochondria when transfected with pEGFP-mitochondrial protein plasmid (Fig. 2A, panel b). There are three clusters of Arg/Lys-rich sequences present in the basic region of C114 (83RHLRRR88, 126KRRKKR131, and 133KLKEKK138). To determine the sequences responsible for nuclear localization of C114, wild-type C114 and a series of deletion mutants were expressed as GFP fusion proteins, and confocal fluorescence microscopy was performed 24 h after transfection of NIH 3T3 cells. The pattern of various EGFP-ÎC114 proteins indicated that the last two clusters of the Arg/Lys-rich sequences (126KRRKKRQKLKEKK138) are the major nuclear localization signals for the C114 protein (Fig. 2B). Nucleotide Binding Analysis of the C114 ProteinâSince C114 protein accumulates in nucleolus, and many nucleolar proteins are dsRNA-binding proteins (12Benkirane M. Neuvent C. Chun R.F. Smith S.M. Samuel C.E. Gatignol A. Jeang K.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 13Kumar K.U. Srivastava S.P. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1116-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), 35S-labeled in vitro translated C114 was tested for its ability to bind various polynucleotide resins. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, unlike in vitro translated luciferase protein, wild-type C114 bound poly(IÂ·C) but not poly(A) or poly(U) RNA. Competitive binding studies were next performed to compare the binding of wild-type C114 to dsRNA versus dsDNA. For these experiments, in vitro translated C114 was incubated with poly(IÂ·C)-agarose in the presence of either free poly(IÂ·C) or poly(dIÂ·dC) competitors and assayed for the ability to bind to the poly(IÂ·C) resin (Fig. 3C). In the presence of increasing amounts of poly(IÂ·C) RNA, the binding of wild-type C114 to poly(IÂ·C)-agarose decreased 79.5% in the presence of the highest concentration of competitors. In contrast, poly(dIÂ·dC) failed to compete for wild-type C114 binding to the poly(IÂ·C) resin with the highest concentration of competitors. These results suggest that wild-type C114 preferentially binds dsRNA. Although C114 clearly binds dsRNA, no known dsRNA-binding motifs were identified in the highly basic amino acid-rich region of C114 by domain search analysis. To determine the regions of C114 that are important for dsRNA-binding, a series of deletion constructs of C114 were assayed for their ability to bind dsRNA (Fig. 3D). The N-terminal 56 amino acids (amino acids 1â56, mutant fragment III) and the C-terminal peptide (amino acids 143â187, mutant C114 fragment VI) showed only 15 and 25% poly(IÂ·C) binding capacity as compared with wild-type C114 protein, respectively. On the other hand, the middle region (amino acids 51â143) containing highly basic amino acid residues contains 88% poly(IÂ·C) binding capacity (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that the binding of C114 to dsRNA is mediated by its middle region. C114 Interacts with the dsRNA-dependent Protein Kinase PKRâDifferent dsRNA-binding proteins, including the viral proteins HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat), TRBP, and vaccinia virus E3 protein, and cellular proteins such as PACT and NF90, interact with PKR (13Kumar K.U. Srivastava S.P. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1116-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 18Feng G.S. Chong K. Kumar A. Williams B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5447-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether C114 can interact with PKR. Co-immunoprecipitations were performed with overexpressed FLAG-tagged C114 and V5-tagged PKR constructs in HEK 293 cells. When FLAG-tagged C114 was immunoprecipitated with an antibody against FLAG, V5-tagged PKR could be detected when the immunoprecipitates were immumoblotted with anti-V5 antibody (Fig. 4A). In addition, a comparable amount of FLAG-C114 (14%) was found to associate with PKR as compared with FLAG-PACT (17%), a well characterized PKR-interacting activator (Fig. 4B). The co-immunoprecipitation results also demonstrate that the N-terminal 50 amino acids of C114 are responsible for its association with PKR in cells (Fig. 4A, lane 4, and B, lane 6). We also mapped the regions of PKR that interact with FLAG-tagged C114 protein. Wild-type PKR or its deletion mutants were individually expressed as [35S]methionine-labeled proteins and incubated with purified FLAG-tagged C114 protein. As shown in Fig. 4C, panel b (lanes 1â3), wild-type PKR and two deletion mutants containing two DRBDs can interact with the C114 protein. Purified FLAG-C114 associated with Protein A-agarose did not pull down the PKR deletion mutant containing only the kinase domain or in vitro translated luciferase (lanes 4 and 5). These results suggest that C114 can interact with DRBDs in the N terminus of PKR. C114 Inhibits PKR Kinase ActivityâSince several RNA-binding proteins including cellular proteins such as PACT and NF90 (14Parker L.M. Fierro-Monti I. Mathews M.B. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1407-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and viral proteins such as TRBP and E3L (19Brand S.R. Kobayashi R. Mathews M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8388-8395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 20Sharp T.V. Moonan F. Romashko A. Joshi B. Barber G.N. Jagus R. Virology. 1998; 250: 302-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) are known to affect PKR activity, we tested whether C114 can modulate the activity of PKR. Expression constructs of FLAG-tagged C114 or its mutant form IV and V5-tagged PKR were co-transfected into HEK 293 cells. The V5-PKR protein was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody against V5 and co-immunoprecipitated with transfected C114 proteins. When kinase assays were performed, PKR immunoprecipitated from C114-expressing cells was less activated in the presence of poly(IÂ·C) or heparin (Fig. 5A, lanes 3 and 6). However, similar levels of PKR autophosphorylation were observed with immunoprecipitated V5-PKR from V5-PKR expression alone or the mutant form IV of C114 co-expressing cells (Fig. 5A, lanes 2, 4, 5, and 7). Comparable results were observed when kinase assays were performed using V5-PKR mixed with partially immunoaffinity-purified FLAG-C114 or FLAG-tagged mutant form IV of C114 protein in vitro (as described under âMaterials and Methods,â data not shown). Although the IV mutant form of C114 retained 98% of the poly(IÂ·C) binding ability as compared with wild-type C114 (Fig. 3D), it lost its binding ability to PKR (Fig. 4A, lane 4) and the effect on PKR activation. When PKR mixed with the IV deletion mutant of C114, similar levels of PKR phosphorylation could be achieved by the PKR activators in the same assay (Fig. 5A, lanes 4 and 7). These results suggest that the inhibition of PKR activity is mediated through direct interaction of C114 and PKR and is independent of dsRNA binding. This scenario is supported by the fact that wild-type C114 can also inhibit PKR activation in the presence of heparin (Fig. 5A, lane 6). To further test the negative regulatory role of C114 on PKR function in cells, we examined the levels of phosphorylation of endogenous eIF-2Î± in cells following poly(IÂ·C) treatment of cells for 2 h. Overexpression of C114 in HEK 293 or HT 1080 cells resulted in lower levels of poly(IÂ·C)-stimulated eIF-2Î± phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). In contrast, overexpressed C114 IV mutant did not complex with PKR (Fig. 4, A and B) and had no effect on eIF-2Î± phosphorylation (Fig. 5C, lane 6). Taken together, these results suggest that C114 inhibits cellular PKR function through the interaction between C114 and PKR protein. In this study, we have identified C114 as a novel 21-kDa dsRNA-binding protein that interacts with PKR and inhibits PKR activity by a dsRNA-independent mechanism. C114 was isolated through a differential screening for IL-11-inducible genes in a mouse preadipocyte cell line, 3T3 L1. IL-11 is a multifunctional cytokine in the bone marrow microenvironment (1Paul S.R. Bennett F. Calvetti J.A. Kelleher K. Wood C.R. O'Hara Jr., R.M. Cleary A.C. Sibley B. Clark S.C. Williams D.A. Yang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7512-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 21Yang Y.C. Yin T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 762: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It shares a common signal transducer, gp130, with other IL-6-type cytokines, such as IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1). These cytokines play important roles in the regulation of complex cellular processes such as gene activation, proliferation, and differentiation (22Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G.G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). The main components of their signaling pathways are Janus kinases, Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2, and the signal transducers and activators of transcription STAT1 and STAT3 (23Calkhoven C.F Muller C. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1920-1932PubMed Google Scholar). However, mechanisms underlying IL-11 in growth and differentiation signaling have not been elucidated. Accumulated evidence suggest the requirement of PKR in response to a variety of biological stimuli, including cytokines (4Williams B.R. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/89/re2)PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, PKR has been shown to interact with STAT3 activated by platelet-derived growth factor to induce c-fos expression (11Deb A. Zamanian-Daryoush M. Xu Z. Kadereit S. Williams B.R.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2487-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the direct signaling link between IL-6 family cytokines and PKR function has never been established. PKR is critical in interferon-mediated antiviral defense, apoptosis, signal transduction, and cell growth but is also implicated in the onset of differentiation (4Williams B.R. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/89/re2)PubMed Google Scholar, 7Judware R. Petryshyn R. Mol. Cell.

Analysis of phosphoproteins has demonstrated increased phosphorylation of PKR and eIF-2Î± during 3T3 F442A adipogenesis. Consistently, inhibition of adipocyte differentiation by cat serum correlated with reduced PKR activation, diminished eIF-2Î± phosphorylation, and elevated growth rate (7Judware R. Petryshyn R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3259-3267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Woldehawariat G. Nekhai S. Petryshyn R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 198: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), suggesting a role of PKR in adipogenesis. Furthermore, introduction of a kinase-inactive dominant negative PKR mutant into 3T3 L1 prevented proliferation arrest and interfered with adipogenic differentiation (23Calkhoven C.F Muller C. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1920-1932PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its mitogenic activity on a plasmacytoma cell line, IL-11 was cloned as an adipogenesis inhibitory factor (2Kawashima I. Ohsumi J. Mito-Honjo K. Shimoda-Takano K. Ishikawa H. Sakakibara S. Miyadai K. Takiguchi Y. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Our observation that C114 is an IL-11-inducible PKR modulator suggests its potential role in adipogenesis. Interestingly, besides IL-11, expression of C114 in 3T3 L1 can also be induced by insulin (data not shown). Although insulin induces a decrease in eIF-2Î± phosphorylation in chondrocytes (24Towle C.A. Mankin H.J. Avruch J. Treadwell B.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 121: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), IL-11 significantly reduces LPS-induced binding activity of NF-ÎºB (25Trepicchio W.L. Wang L. Bozza M. Dorner A.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5661-5670PubMed Google Scholar), a process known to be modulated by PKR (4Williams B.R. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/89/re2)PubMed Google Scholar, 5Deb A. Haque S.J. Mogensen T.H. Silverman R.H. Williams B.R.G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6170-6180Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Further studies of PKR and C114 interaction may clarify the regulation of PKR in adipocyte differentiation and potential cross-talk between IL-11, insulin signaling pathways, and PKR functions. PKR has a bipartite structure consisting of N-terminal DRBDs and a C-terminal catalytic domain. Its DRBDs are known to interact with its catalytic domain and act as auto-regulators for PKR activation (26Nanduri S. Rahman F. Williams B.R. Qin J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5567-5574Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). PACT binds to DRBDs of PKR, which leads to a conformational change facilitating PKR activation (14Parker L.M. Fierro-Monti I. Mathews M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32522-32530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). C114, like NF90 and many other cellular PKR antagonists, also binds DRBDs of PKR (13Kumar K.U. Srivastava S.P. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1116-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). C114 protein inhibits PKR autophosphorylation in a dsRNA-independent manner, suggesting inhibitory effects mediated by its binding to DRBDs of PKR. This interaction may result in a conformational change of PKR, leading to its inability to be activated by polyanionic agents. PKR is mainly localized in the cytoplasm but is also expressed in the nucleolus (27Jeffrey I.W. Kadereit S. Meurs E.F. Metzger T. Bachmann M. Schwemmle M. Hovanessian A.G. Clemens M.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 28Tian B. Mathews M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9936-9944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Under normal condition in Daudi cells, the cytoplasmic to nuclear ratio is â¼5:1. Following interferon treatment of Daudi cells for 16 h, this ratio could increase to around 17:1 (27Jeffrey I.W. Kadereit S. Meurs E.F. Metzger T. Bachmann M. Schwemmle M. Hovanessian A.G. Clemens M.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). DRBD1 domain in the N terminus of PKR plays an important role for PKR nucleolar localization (27Jeffrey I.W. Kadereit S. Meurs E.F. Metzger T. Bachmann M. Schwemmle M. Hovanessian A.G. Clemens M.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Moreover, previous findings also demonstrated that cytoplasmic PKR is predominantly in a dimeric form, whereas in the nucleus it is a basic (i.e. unphosphorylated) protein. PKR appears to be actively transported to the nucleus by unknown mechanisms and translocated to the nucleolus by binding to structural RNAs, possibly rRNA (27Jeffrey I.W. Kadereit S. Meurs E.F. Metzger T. Bachmann M. Schwemmle M. Hovanessian A.G. Clemens M.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In contrast, C114 is predominantly nuclear but has been found in the cytoplasm by fractionation (data not shown). It is highly enriched in nucleolus, determined by its second and third Arg/Lys-rich clusters. Our data also demonstrate that C114 can interact with the DRBDs of PKR protein. Transient transfection experiments showed an increased amount of PKR in the nuclear fraction when coexpressed with C114 in the HEK 293 cells (data not shown), suggesting that C114 might play a role in nuclear import and export of PKR in cells. In many of the experimental systems, what regulates PKR in the cells has remained an enigma, especially in the cases where synthetic or viral dsRNA is not involved. As a novel cellular inhibitory factor of PKR, expression of C114 in 3T3 L1 cells can be induced by IL-11 and insulin as well as poly(IÂ·C) treatment but not by interferon-Î³, transforming growth factor-Î²1, IL-4, and IL-9 (data not shown). C114 may modulate intracellular PKR activity under a variety of growth and differentiation conditions and in response to various extracellular stimuli, within and outside the context of virus infection. Further functional studies of this novel PKR modulator should provide important insights into the role of PKR in cell growth and differentiation. We thank Dr. Ganes C. Sen for kindly providing FLAG-tagged PACT plasmid."

The mechanism by which these nonallosteric enzymes form a stable complex triggered by the binding of their respective substrates raises the question of how such a cooperative association is induced. Analyses of mutations in both enzymes identify residues that are required for their association, some of them being important for catalysis. In arginase, two cysteines at the C terminus of the protein are crucial for its epiarginase function but not for its catalytic activity and trimeric structure. In OTCase, mutations of putative ornithine binding residues, Asp-182, Asn-184, Asn-185, Cys-289, and Glu-256 greatly reduced the affinity for ornithine and impaired the interaction with arginase. The four lysine residues located in the SMG loop, Lys-260, Lys-263, Lys-265, and Lys-268, also play an important role in mediating the sensitivity of OTCase to ornithine and to arginase and appear to be involved in transducing and enhancing the signal given by ornithine for the closure of the catalytic domain.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the expression of arginine anabolic and catabolic genes is regulated at multiple levels in response to a wide variety of metabolic signals such as arginine and amino acid concentrations, nitrogen quality, and availability (reviewed in Ref. 1Messenguy F. Dubois E. Food Technol. Biotechnol. 2000; 4: 277-285Google Scholar). In addition, two mechanisms are known to operate at the level of enzyme activity. Excess arginine causes feedback inhibition of the activity of the two first enzymes of the anabolic pathway, acetylglutamate synthase and acetylglutamate kinase (2Jauniaux J.C. Urrestarazu L.A. Wiame J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wipf B. Leisinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 874-880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another regulation known as the âepiarginase controlâ leads to the inhibition of the activity of the anabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTCase) 1The abbreviations used are: OTCase, ornithine carbamoyltransferase; CP, carbamoyl phosphate; GBD, Gal4 DNA binding domain; GAD, Gal4 activation domain; M.am, minimal medium; PALO, N-(phosphoacetyl)-l-ornithine.1The abbreviations used are: OTCase, ornithine carbamoyltransferase; CP, carbamoyl phosphate; GBD, Gal4 DNA binding domain; GAD, Gal4 activation domain; M.am, minimal medium; PALO, N-(phosphoacetyl)-l-ornithine. (EC 2.1.3.3) by the catabolic enzyme, arginase (EC 3.5.3.1). In the presence of ornithine and arginine, the respective substrates of the two enzymes (4Messenguy F. Wiame J.M. FEBS Lett. 1969; 3: 47-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), OTCase and arginase form a one-to-one enzyme complex in which the activity of OTCase is inhibited, whereas arginase remains catalytically active (5Messenguy F. Penninckx M. Wiame J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 22: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The epiarginase regulation prevents the recycling by OTCase of ornithine produced by arginase and, because both enzymes are cytosolic in S. cerevisiae, is expected to avoid the operation of a futile urea cycle when yeast is growing on arginine as a nitrogen source (4Messenguy F. Wiame J.M. FEBS Lett. 1969; 3: 47-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This control was found in yeast species showing a strong Pasteur effect and taxonomically related to Saccharomyces (6Vissers S. Urrestarazu L.A. Jauniaux J.C. Wiame J.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1982; 128: 1235-1247Google Scholar) and was also reported in Bacillus subtilis (7Issaly I.M. Issaly A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 49: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The absence of the epiarginasic regulation in some species can be linked to a mitochondrial localization of OTCase, whereas arginase is cytosolic, as for example in Debaryomyces hansenii, Hansenula anomala, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (8Urrestarazu L.A. Vissers S. Wiame J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 79: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Direct interaction between OTCase and arginase, which are trimeric, was demonstrated by molecular sieving, a complex containing both enzymes being only observed in the presence of ornithine and arginine (4Messenguy F. Wiame J.M. FEBS Lett. 1969; 3: 47-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Purification in the presence of these effectors (4Messenguy F. Wiame J.M. FEBS Lett. 1969; 3: 47-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and equilibrium sedimentation and electron microscopy (9Hensley P. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1988; 29: 35-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) identified an OTCase-arginase hexamer. The association of the two enzymes was rapidly reversible in vivo as well as in vitro under specific conditions, such as protein dilution, suggesting that no enzymatic modification was involved in this inhibitory mechanism (4Messenguy F. Wiame J.M. FEBS Lett. 1969; 3: 47-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 10Penninckx M. Simon J.P. Wiame J.M. Eur. J.

It was proposed that the ornithine regulatory receptor site on OTCase is distinct from the catalytic site, because by mutation, heating, or chemical alteration inhibition by arginase can be lost without impairing the catalytic activity of OTCase (5Messenguy F. Penninckx M. Wiame J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 22: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the occurrence of a second ornithine binding site was not supported by the data of Hensley and co-workers (9Hensley P. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1988; 29: 35-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) who proposed that the binding of ornithine to the active site promotes a conformational change needed for the complex formation with arginase. Vissers et al. (6Vissers S. Urrestarazu L.A. Jauniaux J.C. Wiame J.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1982; 128: 1235-1247Google Scholar) have investigated the occurrence of the epiarginase control in 32 yeast species belonging to 12 different genera and obtained some correlation between the sensitivity of OTCases to excess ornithine and their sensitivity to arginase. Indeed, all OTCases inhibited by arginase present a marked inhibition by excess ornithine. However, the reverse is not true, and some arginase insensitive OTCases are inhibited by excess ornithine. To get deeper insight at the molecular level into the mechanism involved in the inhibition of OTCase by arginase, we created and analyzed in the S. cerevisiae OTCase a series of mutations leading to the loss of inhibition of its activity by arginase. We also identified residues in the arginase that are required for its regulatory function. S. cerevisiae HY is a diploid strain obtained by crossing strains HF7c (MATa, ura3â52, his3â200, lys2â801, ade2â101, trp1â901, leu2â3,112, gal4â542, gal80â538, LYS2::GAL1-HIS3, URA3::(GAL4(17-mer)3-CYC1-lacZ) and Y187 (MATÎ±, ura3â52, his3â200, ade2â101, trp1â901, leu2â3,112, metâ, gal4Î, gal80Î, URA3::GAL1-lacZ) (12Louvet O.

This strain lacks both GAL4 and GAL80 genes and contains integrated GAL1-lacZ and GAL1-HIS3 reporter genes. The yeast strain 02859d (ura3, leu2, trp1), isogenic to the wild type strain Î£1278b, was used to delete the CAR1 and ARG3 genes. Deletion of the CAR1 gene was achieved by transformating the strain 02859d with pWX4 plasmid as described by Dubois and Messenguy (14Dubois E. Messenguy F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 253: 568-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), leading to strain 02859dÎcar1. Deletion of the ARG3 gene was performed using the PCR strategy developed by Wach (15Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The disruption cassette, containing the kanMX4 cassette with long flanking regions homologous to the ARG3 gene, was synthesized using PCR. This cassette confers to yeast a resistance to Geneticin (G418). The homologous regions of ARG3 gene were located upstream from the start codon and downstream from the stop codon. The PCR protocols for preparation of this cassette were identical to those described in Wach (15Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Integration of the kanMX4 cassette at the target locus was confirmed using the PCR strategy as described by Wach (15Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Strain 02859dÎarg3-car1 (ura3, leu2, trp1, arg3::kanMX4, car1Î) was used as recipient strain for transformation with plasmids overexpressing CAR1 or ARG3 genes. Strain 12S16c (ura3, leu2, arg3Î) (a gift from M. Crabeel) was used as recipient strain for transformation with plasmids expressing wild type or mutated ARG3 genes or with plasmids expressing GBD-OTCase or GAD-OTCase. Strain 12T7cI (ura3, car1Î) (14Dubois E. Messenguy F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 253: 568-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), isogenic to the wild type strain Î£1278b, was used as recipient strain for transformation with plasmids expressing GBD-arginase or GAD-arginase. The strains used in the two-hybrid analysis were grown on synthetic medium containing 0.7% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids. This medium was supplemented with 2% glucose and all amino acids except those whose omission was required for plasmid selection. All the other strains were grown on minimal medium (M.am) containing 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 3% glucose or 2% galactose, vitamins, and mineral traces as described previously (16Messenguy F. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 128: 49-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lithium acetate procedure was used to transform the recipient yeast strains (17Ito H. Fukura Y. Murata K. Timura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) Escherichia coli strains XL1-Blue, XL1-Red, and HB101 from Stratagene were used for plasmid amplification, plasmid mutagenesis, and selection of plasmids containing a functional LEU2 gene and the GAD-ARG3 gene, respectively. To overexpress OTCase and arginase, we amplified by PCR the full-length ARG3 and CAR1 genes, using as template the genomic DNA from the wild type strain Î£1278b and as primers the appropriate oligonucleotides extended with BamHI restriction sites. These fragments were inserted in the BamHI site of vector pYeF2 (pUC19, 2Î¼, URA3, GAL10 promoter) (18Cullin C. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Yeast. 1994; 10: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), yielding plasmids pDC2 (pGAL10-ARG3, 2Î¼, URA3) and pEJ24 (pGAL10-CAR1, 2Î¼, URA3). The two genes were sequenced to ensure that no mutation was introduced during the PCR procedure. The DNA binding domain of the Gal4 activator, Gal4-(1â147), is referred to as GBD, and its activation domain, Gal4-(768â881), is referred to as GAD. The underlined GBD and GAD refer to the DNA sequences encoding these domains. GBD-containing fusion genes were constructed in vector pAS2 (19Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen R.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Transformants harboring the vector, or a derivative thereof, were selected by omitting tryptophan from the yeast nitrogen base medium (Difco, Detroit, MI). GAD-containing fusion genes were constructed in vector pACTII (19Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen R.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar), transformants harboring the vector, or a derivative thereof, were selected by omitting leucine from the yeast nitrogen base medium. GBD-ARG3 and GAD-ARG3 FusionsâTo construct the GBD-ARG3 and GAD-ARG3 gene fusions, we PCR-amplified the ARG3 gene, using as template the genomic DNA from the wild type Î£1278b strain and as primers the appropriate oligonucleotides flanked by a BamHI site for the 5â²-end and a XhoI site for the 3â²-end. This DNA fragment was digested by BamHI and XhoI and inserted into the pAS2 vector, then digested by BamHI and SalI, leading to plasmid pGBD-ARG3, and inserted into the pACTII vector, and finally digested again by BamHI and XhoI, leading to plasmid pGAD-ARG3. In these GBD-ARG3 and GAD-ARG3 fusions, we determined the nucleotide sequence to ensure that the fusions were in-frame and that no mutation had been introduced during the PCR procedure. GBD-CAR1 and GAD-CAR1 FusionsâTo construct the GBD-CAR1 and GAD-CAR1 gene fusions, we amplified by PCR the CAR1 gene, using as template the genomic DNA from the wild type Î£1278b strain and as primers the appropriate oligonucleotides flanked by a BamHI site for the 5â²-end and a XhoI site for the 3â²-end. This DNA fragment was digested by BamHI and XhoI and inserted into the pAS2 vector, then digested by BamHI and SalI, leading to plasmid pGBD-CAR1, and inserted into the pACTII vector, then finally digested again by BamHI and XhoI, leading to plasmid pGAD-CAR1. In these GBD-CAR1 and GAD-CAR1 fusions, we determined the nucleotide sequence to ensure that the fusions were in-frame and that no mutation had been introduced during the PCR procedure. Plasmid pGAD-ARG3 was used to transform E. coli strain XL1-Red (Stratagene) to obtain mutations in the ARG3 gene, because this strain is highly mutagenic. Plasmids containing the mutated GAD-arg3 gene were extracted from a pool of bacterial transformants and used to transform yeast strain MaV99 containing plasmid GBD-CAR1. This strain is suitable for the use of the reverse two-hybrid assay, because it contains the URA3 reporter gene under the control of the UASGAL sequences. The URA3 gene allowed the selection of mutated GAD-OTCases having lost their interaction with GBD-arginase, because only the strains that did not express the URA3 gene could grow on a medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid plus 25 Î¼g of uracil. 15 candidates were obtained, and their DNA was extracted and used to transform E. coli strain HB101 (leuâ, proâ, amps). This allowed the selection of plasmids containing a functional LEU2 gene and the GAD-ARG3 gene, and eliminated the pGBD-CAR1 plasmid. The deletion of the region between amino acids 166 and 169 (ÎEVNK) was created by in vitro mutagenesis on double-stranded DNA from plasmid pKV0c2 (pBR322, 2Î¼, URA3, ARG3), which contains the ARG3 gene, leading to plasmid parg3-M1. The substitutions T68G, E123S, E123A, G181R, D182N, N184Q, N185Q, C191M/C194N/F197V, E256Q, E256A, K260R, K260A, K263R, K263A, K265R, K265A, K268R, K268A, C289S, L290S, L290Q, and Q294P were introduced in OTCase by site-directed in vitro mutagenesis on plasmid pDC2 (pGAL10-ARG3, 2Î¼, URA3), leading to plasmids pME223 (T68G), pME204 (E123S), pME206 (E123A), pME216 (G181R), pFV48 (D182N), pME234 (N184Q), pME235 (N185Q), pME211 (C191M/C194N/F197V), pME205 (E256Q), pME207 (E256A), pME217 (K260R), pME218 (K260A), pME213 (K263R), pME208 (K263A), pME240 (K265R), pME219 (K265A), pME241 (K268R), pME220 (K268A), pME237 (C289S), pME238 (L290S), pME239 (L290Q), and pME221 (Q294P), respectively. All genes were sequenced to ensure that no additional mutation had been introduced during the PCR procedure. The deletion of the region between amino acids 78 and 86 (ÎGGSS-VMIDG) was generated by in vitro mutagenesis on double-stranded DNA from plasmid pEJ24 (pGAL10-CAR1, 2Î¼, URA3), leading to plasmid pAM4. The substitutions H309K/H312E and C321R/C326T were introduced in arginase by site-directed in vitro mutagenesis on plasmid pEJ24 (pGAL10-CAR1, 2Î¼, URA3), leading to plasmids pME209 (H309K/H312E) and pME210 (C321R/C326T), respectively. The changes of the amino acids H309K/H312E/C321R/C326T were generated in arginase by site-directed in vitro mutagenesis on plasmid pME210, leading to plasmid pME222 (H309K/H312E/C321R/C326T). All genes were sequenced to ensure that no additional mutation had been introduced during the PCR procedure. Î²-Galactosidase activity was assayed as described by Miller (20Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Protein contents were determined by the Folin method. Arginase activity was assayed as described previously (5Messenguy F. Penninckx M. Wiame J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 22: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). OTCase activity was determined by citrulline detection (21Archibald R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1944; 156: 121-129Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Routinely the OTCase activities were measured in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 5 mm carbamoyl phosphate and at ornithine saturation. The reaction was carried out at 30 Â°C for 30 min and was stopped by addition of HCl at a final concentration of 0.5 m. In the experiments of OTCase inhibition by arginase, 1 mm agmatine, an arginine analog, and increasing amounts of arginase (up to 1000 arginase units) were added in the incubation mixture. This enzyme concentration corresponded to an amount of wild type arginase 4-fold higher than the amount required for maximal inhibition of OTCase. Agmatine was used in the OTCase-arginase binding assays instead of arginine to avoid arginine degradation at high arginase concentration. The experiments shown in Fig. 5 (see below) were performed using the more sensitive assay of Prescott and Jones (22Prescott L.M. Jones M.E. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 32: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), for which standard curves for citrulline were generated in each experiment. Specific activities were expressed in micromoles of citrulline formed per hour and per milligram of protein. Alignment of OTCase amino acid sequences of S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, human, Pyrococcus furiosus, E. coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been performed with the ClustalW program (23Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 403-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2360) Google Scholar, 24Higgins D.G. Sharp P.M. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar). Based on this multiple sequence alignment, the structure of E. coli was selected as template to construct a three-dimensional model of S. cerevisiae OTCase. Assignment of the coordinates, construction of additional loops (residues 45â50 and residues 160â169 in the yeast sequence), and minimization of the structure were carried out using the Modeler4 program (25Sali A. Modeller, Protein Structure Modeling by Satisfaction of Spatial Restraints. Rockefeller University, New York, NY1997Google Scholar). The quality of the model has been checked using the Procheck program (26Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The geometry of the final model complies with statistical criteria. About 98% of the residues fall in allowed regions (86.2% and 11.5% of phi/psi angles are, respectively, in the most favored or additional allowed regions) of the Ramachandran plot, and all bond lengths and valence angles corresponded to expected values. Graphical outputs were generated with Molscript (27Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Cryst. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). All calculations were carried out on an O2 SGI workstation operated with Irix 6.2. The coordinates of the model are available upon request to the authors. The gel filtration procedure was carried out at 4 Â°C. A Superdex 200 column (1.6 Ã 60 cm, Amersham Biosciences) was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing either 15 mm ornithine or a concentration stated in the legends of Figs. 2 and 3C, and 1 mm agmatine. This column was pre-calibrated with serum albumin (molecular mass, 66 kDa), E. coli OTCase (molecular mass, 120 kDa), Enterococcusfaecalis OTCase (molecular mass, 240 kDa), and P. furiosus OTCase (molecular mass, 420 kDa). Elution was carried out with the same buffer, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and 0.56-ml fractions were collected. Activities of OTCase and arginase were determined in each fraction as described.Fig. 3Elution profile of a mixture of arginase and OTCase extracted from wild type and mutant strains. The molecular mass of arginase is about 114 kDa and that of OTCase is about 120 kDa (A). When the two enzymes are associated as in B, the molecular mass of the associated peak is about 200 kDa. Arginase and OTCase from wild type and mutant strains were eluted on Superdex 200 column with Tris-HCl 50 mm, pH 8.0.

Plasmid DNA was prepared using the alkaline lysis method (28Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9838) Google Scholar). Double-stranded DNA was prepared using Qiagen columns. DNA was sequenced by the Thermosequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). Site-directed in vitro mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Selection of a Mutated OTCase Resistant to Inhibition by Arginase Using the Reverse Two-hybrid AssayâAs a first attempt to select mutations in OTCase that impair its association with arginase, we took advantage of assays that had been developed in yeast (13Vidal M. Brachmann R.K. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Boeke J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10315-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 29Fields S. Song O.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). We first tested whether OTCase and arginase do interact in vivo using the two-hybrid assay (29Fields S. Song O.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Therefore, we fused OTCase and arginase coding sequences to the DNA binding domain (GBD) and the activation domain (GAD) of the Gal4 protein, leading to the chimeric proteins GBD-OTCase, GAD-OTCase, GBD-arginase, and GAD-arginase (see âExperimental Proceduresâ), which were tested in vivo by the two-hybrid assay. The results indicated a significant interaction between GBD-OTCase and GAD-arginase and a stronger interaction between GBD-arginase and GAD-OTCase (data not shown). We used the reverse two-hybrid assay to select mutants impaired in the interaction between the two proteins (see âExperimental Proceduresâ). The plasmids of strains growing on 5-fluoroorotic acid were extracted, purified, and used to transform yeast strain 12S16c for OTCase activity determination, and strain HY (containing plasmid GBD-CAR1) was used to confirm the loss of interaction of these mutated OTCases with arginase. Only one candidate, named M3, retained sufficient OTCase activity to sustain the growth of a strain deleted of the ARG3 gene. This residual OTCase activity was resistant to the inhibition by arginase, even at ornithine concentrations higher than 100 mm (data not shown). The GAD-arg3-M3 gene was sequenced and found to harbor a single replacement Asn for Asp at position 182, a highly conserved residue present in all OTCases (Fig. 1). The mutation was introduced in the ARG3 gene yielding plasmid pFV48 (pGAL10-arg3D182N, 2Î¼, URA3). The substitution resulted in a slight reduction of OTCase specific activity, a strong decrease of the apparent affinity of the mutant enzyme for ornithine and a total loss of inhibition of its activity by arginase, even at high ornithine concentration (200 mm instead of 15 mm) (Table I and Fig. 2). Moreover, OTCase-D182N had lost the capacity to interact with arginase, as shown by molecular sieving (Fig. 3). In the presence of ornithine and arginine, wild type OTCase and arginase formed a complex of about 200 kDa, whereas, in contrast, OTCase-D182N and wild type arginase were unable to form such a complex, even at a concentration of ornithine equivalent to 2-fold the apparent Km value (Fig. 3 and Table I).Table ICharacteristics of the mutated OTCasesPlasmidsNature of the mutation in OTCaseOTCase specific activity measured at saturation of ornithine and CPApparent Km for ornithineRemaining activity of OTCase after inhibition by 500 units of WT arginasemM%pDC2WT15701.614pME223T68G773.418pME204E123S13902.116pME206E123A15202.615pME216G181R0NDaND, not detectable.

Open table in a new tab Construction of Additional Mutations in OTCase by in Vitro MutagenesisâAt present more than 60 OTCase amino acid sequences are available (SwissProt search, 2002), and the crystal structure of OTCases from P. aeruginosa, E. coli, P. furiosus, and human are known (30Villeret V.

Each polypeptide chain from these trimeric enzymes folds into two domains, a carbamoyl phosphate binding domain and an l-ornithine binding domain (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 1, alignment of the amino acid sequences of these OTCases and those of S. cerevisiae and S. pombe shows large regions of identity but also reveals several regions where the sequences diverge significantly. The region from residue 161 to 168 in particular is unique to the S. cerevisiae OTCase. However, deletion of amino acids E166/V167/N168/K169 (Î in Fig. 1) had no effect on the OTCase-arginase interaction (data not shown). Surprisingly, the mutation D182N rendering OTCase insensitive to arginase occurs in a conserved stretch (Gly-181, Asp-182, Asn-184, and Asn-185) in which some amino acids might interact with ornithine, according to studies on E. coli OTCase complexed with the bisubstrate analog N-(phos"
