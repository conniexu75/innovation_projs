https://openalex.org/W2316386966,"Apoptotic pathways controlled by the Rel/NF-kappaB family of transcription factors may regulate the response of cells to DNA damage. Here, we have examined the NF-kappaB status of several prostate tumor cell lines. In the androgen-independent prostate tumor cells PC-3 and DU-145, the DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB was constitutively activated and IkappaB-alpha levels were decreased. In contrast, the androgen-sensitive prostate tumor cell line LNCaP had low levels of NF-kappaB which were upregulated following exposure to cytokines or DNA damage. The activity of the IkappaB-alpha kinase, IKKalpha, which mediates NF-kappaB activation, was also measured. In PC-3 cells, IKKalpha activity was constitutively active, whereas LNCaP cells had minimal IKKalpha activity that was activated by cytokines. The anti-inflammatory agent ibuprofen inhibited the constitutive activation of NF-kappaB and IKKalpha in PC-3 and DU-145 cells, and blocked stimulated activation of NF-kappaB in LNCaP cells. However, ibuprofen did not directly inhibit IkappaB-alpha kinase. The results demonstrate that NF-kappaB is constitutively activated in the hormone-insensitive prostate tumor cell lines PC-3 and DU-145, but not in the hormone responsive LNCaP cell line. The constitutive activation of NF-kappaB in prostate tumor cells may increase expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, thereby decreasing the effectiveness of anti-tumor therapy and contributing to the development of the malignant phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2330837897,"There is now evidence to suggest that BRCA1 and BRCA2 are involved in the response of cells to DNA damage and cell cycle checkpoint control. This report examines the death pathways of human cells with various BRCA1 and BRCA2 genotypes after exposure to gamma-rays. A lack of functional BRCA1 and BRCA2 led to defective repair of DNA double-strand breaks in irradiated cells. This impairment resulted in a relaxation of cell cycle checkpoints, production of micronuclei, and a loss of proliferative capacity. Heterozygous BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations also led to enhanced radiosensitivity, with an impaired proliferative capacity after irradiation. The existence of a phenotype related to radiosensitivity in BRCA1+/- and BRCA2+/- cells raises the question of the response of heterozygous women to radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2077077203,"Human cDNAs encoding a novel member of Tob/BTG1 anti-proliferative family proteins were cloned. The putative protein product termed Tob2 consisted of 344 amino acids with high similarity to the Tob protein. The tob2 mRNA was 4.1 kb long and was ubiquitously expressed in human adult tissues, as was revealed by Northern blot hybridization. However, further in situ hybridization analysis showed a characteristic expression of the tob2 mRNA in oocytes, suggesting a unique role of Tob2 in oogenesis. Like the Tob protein, Tob2 inhibited cell cycle progression from the G0/G1 to S phases. Intriguingly, the amino-terminal half of Tob2 as well as that of Tob was associated with a human homologue of yeast Caf1, a component of the CCR4 transcription factor complex. Moreover, Caf1 was associated with cyclin dependent kinases. These data suggested that both Tob and Tob2 were involved in cell cycle regulation through their interaction with Caf1. Finally, the tob2 gene was mapped to human chromosome 22q13.1-q13.31."
https://openalex.org/W2019180113,"The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathway subserves an essential tumor suppressor function in various cell types. A heteromeric complex composed of TGF-beta type I (RI) and type II (RII) receptors is required for TGF-beta signaling. We have identified a subset of human gastric cancer cell lines which are insensitive to TGF-beta and which express a low level of TGF-beta type I receptor mRNA relative to a gastric cancer cell line which is highly responsive to TGF-beta. Using these cells, we show that hypermethylation of a CpG island in the 5' region of the TGF-beta RI gene provides another potentially important mechanism of escape from negative growth control by TGF-beta. This hypermethylation was found in four of five human gastric cancer cell lines and five out of 40 (12.5%) primary tumors examined. In human gastric cancer cell lines, treatment with the demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, resulted in increased expression of the TGF-beta RI gene, but not the RII gene. Transient transfection of an RI expression vector into the TGF-beta resistant SNU-601 cell line restores TGF-beta responsiveness. These findings suggest that one of the mechanisms of escape from autocrine or paracrine growth control by TGF-beta during carcinogenesis could involve aberrant methylation of CpG islands in the 5' region of the TGF-beta RI gene."
https://openalex.org/W2326133032,"FGFRs (fibroblast growth factor receptors) are encoded by four genes (FGFR1-4). Alternative splicing results in various receptor isoforms. The FGFR2-IIIb variant is present in a wide variety of epithelia, including the bladder epithelium. Recently, we have shown that FGFR2-IIIb is downregulated in a subset of transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder, and that this downregulation is associated with a poor prognosis. We investigated possible tumour suppressive properties of FGFR2-IIIb by transfecting two human bladder tumour cell lines, J82 and T24, which have no endogenous FGFR2-IIIb expression, with FGFR2-IIIb cDNA. No stable clones expressing FGFR2-IIIb were isolated with the J82 cell line. For the T24 cell line, stable transfectants expressing FGFR2-IIIb had reduced growth in vitro and formed fewer tumours in nude mice which, in addition, grew more slowly. The potential mechanisms leading to decreased FGFR2-IIIb mRNA levels were also investigated. The 5' region of the human FGFR2 gene was isolated and found to contain a CpG island which was partially methylated in more than half the cell lines and tumours which do not express FGFR2-IIIb. No homozygous deletion was identified in any of the tumours or cell lines with reduced levels of FGFR2-IIIb. Mutational analysis of the entire coding region of FGFR2-IIIb at the transcript level was performed in 33 bladder tumours. In addition to normal FGFR2-IIIb mRNA, abnormal transcripts were detected in two tumour samples. These abnormal mRNAs resulted from exon skipping which affected the region encoding the kinase domain. Altogether, these results show that FGFR2-IIIb has tumour growth suppressive properties in bladder carcinomas and suggest possible mechanisms of FGFR2 gene inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2327387014,"To elucidate the possible role of NF-kappaB in mouse skin carcinogenesis we studied the expression of p50 (NF-kappaB1), p52 (NF-kappaB2), p65 (RelA) and IkappaB-alpha inhibitor as well as kappaB-binding activity in adult SENCAR mouse skin, skin papillomas, and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) generated by a two-stage carcinogenesis protocol. We found that in normal epidermis all of the above proteins were mostly expressed in the cytoplasm of basal cells. Western blot analysis revealed a dramatic increase of p50 and p52 expression in mouse skin tumors starting from the middle stage of promotion. We also found that the level of IkappaB-alpha protein in many late papillomas and SCC was lower than in normal epidermis. Results of EMSA showed an increase in kappaB-binding activity in mouse skin tumors and suggested that p50 is the major component of constitutive kappaB-binding complexes in normal epidermis and in tumors. It has been shown that nuclear IkappaB protein Bcl-3 is able to increase p50/p50 homodimer binding to the different kappaB sites in mouse thymocytes. Our finding on Bcl-3 overexpression in late papillomas and SCC could explain the selective increase of p50-related kappaB-binding in mouse skin tumors. Thus, our results strongly suggest the important role of p50 in skin carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2076994758,"Akt, a proto-oncogene that encodes a cytosolic serine/threonine kinase, can phosphorylate and modulate the activity of several proteins involved in cellular metabolism and survival. Recently, two mammalian highly related forkhead transcription factors FKHRL1 and AFX and their nematode homologue Daf-16 have been found to be targets of this kinase. Here we show that Akt, but not inactive Akt, represses the transcriptional activity of FKHR, another member of the forkhead family. FKHR mutants with alanine substitutions at three Akt phosphorylation consensus sites (T24, S256 and S319) were inhibited by Akt, but mutation of all three sites rendered FKHR resistant to suppression. By contrast, the transcriptional activity of the oncogenic PAX3-FKHR fusion protein, containing two consensus phosphorylation sites, was not inhibited by Akt. Importantly, Akt inhibited the translocation of FKHR to the nucleus, providing a mechanism by which Akt might regulate the transcriptional activity of FKHR. Consistent with this model, the localization of the PAX3-FKHR fusion protein was nuclear and was not altered by Akt. These results provide evidence that Akt inhibits the transcriptional activity of FKHR by controlling its trafficking into the nucleus and that oncogenic PAX3-FKHR can escape this negative regulation by Akt."
https://openalex.org/W2316848840,"The tumour suppressor PTEN, also named MMAC1 or TEP1, is associated with a number of malignancies in human populations. This protein has a dual protein phosphatase activity, being also capable to dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 triphosphate. We have studied the mechanism of growth suppression attributable to PTEN. We observed that PTEN overexpression inhibits cell growth in a variety of normal and transformed, human and murine cells. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and TUNEL labelling experiments in transiently transfected cells demonstrate that this inhibition is due to a cell cycle arrest rather than induction of apoptosis. Given that PTEN is unable to cause cell growth arrest in retinoblastoma (Rb)-deficient cell lines, we have explored the possible requirement for pRb in the PTEN-induced inhibition of cell proliferation. We found that the co-expression of SV40 antigen, but not a mutant form (which binds exclusively to p53), and cyclin D1/cdk4 are able to overcome the PTEN-mediated growth suppression. In addition, the reintroduction of a functional pRb, but not its relatives p107 or p130, in Rb-deficient cells restores the sensitivity to PTEN-induced arrest. Finally, the hyperphosphorylation of transfected pRb is inhibited by PTEN co-expression and restored by PI-3K co-expression. Accordingly, PTEN gene is mostly expressed, in parallel to Akt, in mid-late G1 phase during cell cycle progression prior to pRb hyperphosphorylation. Finally, we have studied the signal transduction pathways modulated by PTEN expression. We found that PTEN-induced growth arrest can be rescued by the co-expression of active PI-3K and downstream effectors such as Akt or PDK1, and also certain small GTPases such as Rac1 and Cdc42, but not by active Ha-ras, raf or RhoA. Collectively, our data link the tumour suppressor activities of PTEN to the machinery controlling cell cycle through the modulation of signalling molecules whose final target is the functional inactivation of the retinoblastoma gene product."

https://openalex.org/W1981514907,"A proportion of extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas (EMC) have been shown to have a characteristic translocation t(9;22)(q22;q12) involving the EWS gene at 22q12 and the CHN orphan nuclear receptor gene at 9q22. This translocation appears to be largely specific for EMC, but has not been detected in all such tumours. We report here a case of EMC with a t(9;17)(q22;q11.2) as the sole chromosome abnormality. We have determined that the translocation results in the fusion of the entire coding region of CHN to the N-terminal transactivation domain of RBP56/hTAFII68. This is the first report of a translocation involving RBP56/hTAFII 68, a protein with sequence homology to both EWS and TLS/FUS. The involvement of RBP56/hTAFII68 may explain some unusual features of the tumour."
https://openalex.org/W2318572606,"While 25% of human cancers harbor oncogenic Ras mutations, such mutations are not found in astrocytomas. We have previously demonstrated that the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases expressed by malignant human astrocytoma cells and specimens results in functional upregulation of the Ras signalling pathway and increased levels of activated Ras*GTP. Farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) are promising anti-cancer agents in early clinical trials, which may exert their effect through pharmacological inhibition of the Ras signalling pathway. In this study we establish the anti-tumorigenic properties of the FTI L-744,832 against a panel of malignant human astrocytoma cell lines. Furthermore, we demonstrate the multiple mechanisms by which L-744,832 exerts its effect. L-744,832 demonstrates both cytostatic and cytotoxic effects on astrocytoma cells, and cells expressing a truncated constitutively phosphorylated Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor common in high-grade astrocytomas (EGFRvIII/p140EGF-R) demonstrate increased sensitivity to the agent. L-744,832 is capable of inducing apoptosis in astrocytoma cells under anchorage-dependent conditions; this process occurs in a p53-independent manner and is associated with increased expression of Bax and Bak. L-744,832 also induces cell cycle arrest at both the G1/M and G2/S checkpoints; this process is also independent of p53 mutational status. Cell cycle arrest in drug-treated cells can be accompanied by induction of p21WAF1/CIP1, but this induction is not necessary for the cell cycle inhibitory effects, nor is it dependent on functional p53. Finally, angiogenesis in astrocytomas has been shown to be dependent on secretion of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) by tumour cells, particularly under hypoxic conditions. L-744,832 potently inhibits the secretion of VEGF under hypoxic conditions. These combinations of mechanisms suggest that these tumours, despite the absence of oncogenic Ras mutations, will be amenable to growth inhibition by FTIs, through a combination of anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, and anti-angiogenic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2335372561,"The effects of p38 MAP kinase and ERK on UVB induced c-fos gene expression were studied in a human keratinocyte cell line, FL30. UVB significantly increased c-fos gene expression at both the transcriptional and protein levels. p38 and ERK were also significantly activated after UVB irradiation. Treating the cells with p38 inhibitor SB202190 inhibited p38 activation, but not ERK; treating the cells with MEK-1 inhibitor PD98059 inhibited ERK activation without suppressing p38 activation. The kinase activation was determined by Western blots using phospho-p38 or ERK antibodies, or an in vivo p38 activity assay. Further studies demonstrated that blocking p38 almost completely abrogated UVB induced c-fos gene transcription and c-Fos protein synthesis. Inhibiting ERK partially abrogated UVB induced c-fos transcriptional and protein levels. Suppression of both p38 and ERK not only completely blocked UVB induced c-fos expression, but also decreased c-fos gene basal expression. Our data indicated that p38 may play a more important role than ERK in UVB induced c-fos expression in human keratinocytes. Since c-fos expression may play an important role in UVB induced AP-1 activation, and AP-1 activation is known to play a role in tumor promotion, both p38 and ERK could be potential targets for chemoprevention of skin cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2321661916,"Dlk/ZIP kinase is a newly discovered serine/threonine kinase which, due to its homology to DAP kinase, was named DAP like kinase, Dlk. This kinase is tightly associated with nuclear structures, it undergoes extensive autophosphorylation and phosphorylates myosin light chain and core histones H3, H2A and H4 in vitro. Moreover, it possesses a leucine zipper which mediates interaction with transcription factor ATF-4, therefore it was called ZIP kinase. We employed the yeast two-hybrid system to identify interaction partners of Dlk that might serve as regulators or targets. Besides ATF-4 and others we found Par-4, a modulator of transcription factor WT1 and mediator of apoptosis. Complex formation between Dlk and Par-4 was confirmed by GST pull-down experiments and kinase reactions in vitro and coexpression experiments in vivo. The interaction domain within Dlk was mapped to an arginine-rich region between residues 338 - 417, rather than to the leucine zipper. Strikingly, coexpression of Dlk and Par-4 lead to relocation of Dlk from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, particularly to actin filaments. These interactions provoked a dramatic reorganization of the cytoskeleton and morphological symptoms of apoptosis, thus suggesting a functional relationship between Dlk and Par-4 in the control of apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W2026084994,"We have previously demonstrated that ectopic expression of the HPV-18 E6*I protein has an antiproliferative effect in cells derived from HPV-containing cervical tumours. This effect correlated with the ability of E6*I to inhibit the E6-mediated degradation of p53 both in vitro and in vivo and with an increase in p53 transcriptional trans-activation. The observation that the E6*I protein can interact with both full-length HPV-18 E6 and E6-AP proteins in vitro indicated the mechanism by which this activity was mediated. In this study we describe a mutational strategy to attempt to differentiate between the E6-AP and full-length HPV-18 E6 interactions, with respect to the biological function of E6*I. We identify regions of the E6*I protein essential for its interaction with full-length E6 and important for its interaction with E6-AP. We show that a mutant of E6*I which is unable to bind to full-length HPV-18 E6 protein is unable to inhibit the E6-directed degradation of p53 and is also unable to inhibit the proliferation of a cervical tumour-derived cell line. Finally, we show that inhibition of transformed cell growth by E6*I protein correlates with its ability to induce apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. These results raise the intriguing possibility of using E6*I as a basis for therapeutic intervention in HPV-associated tumours."
https://openalex.org/W1996105340,"Although most extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas (EMC) are cytogenetically characterized by the translocation t(9;22)(q22;q12), another subset has recently been identified carrying a t(9;17)(q22;q11). Whereas the t(9;22) is known to result in fusion of the CHN (TEC) gene from 9q22 with the EWS gene from 22q12, creating a chimeric EWS/CHN, the genes involved in the t(9;17) of EMC are unknown. We examined two EMC with t(9;17)(q22;q11) and found that the CHN gene was recombined with the RBP56 gene from 17q11 to generate a chimeric RBP56/CHN. RBP56 has not previously been shown to be involved in tumorigenesis but it encodes a putative RNA-binding protein similar to the EWS and FUS (TLS) proteins known to play a pathogenetic role in several sarcomas. The presence of the RBP56/CHN chimeric gene in EMC with t(9;17)(q22;q11) shows that the N-terminal parts of EWS and RBP56 have similar oncogenic potential making them pathogenetically equivalent in oncoproteins arising from fusions with certain transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2317786914,"The cdk2 gene has been identified as a human cdc2/CDC28-related gene that encodes a protein kinase essential for the G1/S transition in mammalian cells, but not for the G2/M transition, which requires Cdk1, another p34cdc2/CDC28 homolog. Novel potential functions of Cdk2 have been uncovered by using two potent and specific inhibitors of its kinase activity, roscovitine and olomoucine, on human wt p53-expresser untransformed and tumor-derived cells. At concentrations equal or superior to respectively 30- and 20-fold their in vitro IC50 values for cyclin B/Cdk1, cyclin A/Cdk2 and cyclin E/Cdk2, the Cdk inhibitors precipitately induce a dramatic nuclear accumulation of wt p53 and a delocalization of nucleolin from the nucleolus in all interphase cells, whatever their cell cycle status, acting in this way like the DNA-damaging drug, mitomycin C (7 microg/ml). These early events are soon followed by a nucleolar fragmentation in both normal and tumor cells in the presence of the Cdk inhibitors but not in the presence of the DNA-damaging drug. Yet, treatment with either type of compounds eventually triggers rapidly the death of the tumor cells and, much more slowly, that of the normal cells. The Cdk inhibitors, however, stimulate cell death from any stage of the cell cycle, whereas the DNA-damaging drug kills more efficaciously S phase cells. These observations provide a hint that the Cdk2 kinase might be involved in controlling the nuclear levels of the tumor suppressor wt p53 protein and in maintaining the nucleolar integrity and function, linking in this way the cell division cycle machinery to survival functions and overall cell metabolism via the control of nucleocytoplasmic transport and of ribosome production."
https://openalex.org/W1983688686,"We have isolated a human and murine homologue of the Drosophila prune gene through dbEST searches. The gene is ubiquitously expressed in human adult tissues, while in mouse developing embryos a high level of expression is confined to the nervous system particularly in the dorsal root ganglia, cranial nerves, and neural retina. The gene is composed of eight exons and is located in the 1q21.3 chromosomal region. A pseudogene has been sequenced and mapped to chromosomal region 13q12. PRUNE protein retains the four characteristic domains of DHH phosphoesterases. The synergism between prune and awdK-pn in Drosophila has led various authors to propose an interaction between these genes. However, such an interaction has never been supported by biochemical data. By using interaction-mating and in vitro co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we show for the first time the ability of human PRUNE to interact with the human homologue of awd protein (nm23-H1). In contrast, PRUNE is impaired in its interaction with nm-23-H1-S120G mutant, a gain-of-function mutation associated with advanced neuroblastoma stages. Consistently, PRUNE and nm23-H1 proteins partially colocalize in the cytoplasm. The data presented are consistent with the view that PRUNE acts as a negative regulator of the nm23-H1 protein. We discuss how PRUNE regulates nm23-H1 protein and postulate possible implications of PRUNE in neuroblastoma progression."

https://openalex.org/W2320010059,"The effects of HIV-1 Tat protein on mitochondria membrane permeability and apoptosis were analysed in lymphoid cells. In this report we show that stable-transfected HIV-Tat cells are primed to undergo apoptosis upon serum withdrawal. This effect was observed in both the Jhan T cell line and the K562 cells, the latter expressing the bcr-abl chimeric gene, which confers resistance to apoptosis induced by different stimuli. Using a cytofluorimetric approach we have determined that serum withdrawal induces a disruption of the transmembrane mitochondrial potential (Δψm) followed by an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the subsequent DNA nuclear loss in K562-Tat cells but not in the K562-pcDNA cell line. These pre-apoptotic events were associated with the cleavage of the caspase-3, while the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Bax proteins was not affected by the presence of Tat. Regardless of the steady state of the Bax protein, we found that in both K562 and K562-Tat cells, this protein is located in the nucleus, but after serum withdrawal its localization was mainly in the cytoplasm. The activity of caspase-3 detected in K562-Tat cells after serum withdrawal paralleled with the mitochondria permeability transition. Nevertheless, in Jhan-Tat cells the inhibition of this caspase with the specific inhibitor, z-DEVD-cmk, did not affect the disruption of the mitochondria potential induced by serum withdrawal. Interestingly, we found that HIV-Tat protein accumulates at the mitochondria in the K562-Tat cells cultured under low serum conditions, and this mitochondrial localization correlated with the Δψm disruption detected in these cells. In addition, HIV-1 Tat protein synergies with protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), a ligand of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor, in the induction of apoptosis in both Jhan and K562 cells. Thus, HIV-1 Tat protein may induce apoptosis by a mechanism that involves mitochondrial PT and may contribute to the lymphocyte depletion seen in AIDS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2328636984,"p53 tumour suppressor protein levels and p53-dependent transcriptional activity have been recently shown to increase in cells treated with leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor of nuclear export. Experiments presented here show that LMB treatment leads to growth arrest and a senescence-like phenotype in human normal fibroblast cultures. This effect is reversible after removal of the drug and further passage by trypsinization. Instead, LMB has a strong cytotoxic effect on human neuroblastoma cell lines even at nanomolar concentrations. In both these cell types the effects of LMB are attenuated when the activity of the endogenous wild type p53 protein is abrogated by overexpression of a dominant negative p53 mutant. We conclude that the induction of the p53 response by LMB plays an important role in the effects of this drug on cultured cells."
https://openalex.org/W2056836148,"Activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) by Fas ligation is caspase-dependent, suggesting that caspases may regulate activators of the JNK pathway. Here, we report that an upstream activator of JNK, hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1), was cleaved during apoptosis. Cleavage of HPK1 was blocked by peptide inhibitors for caspases. HPK1 was efficiently processed by recombinant caspase 3 in vitro. A conserved caspase recognition site, DDVD (amino acids 382 - 385), was found in the HPK1 protein sequence. By testing HPK1 proteins with in vivo and in vitro cleavage assays, we showed that aspartic acid residue 385 is the target for caspases. HPK1 cleavage separated the amino N-terminal kinase domain from the carboxyl C-terminal regulatory domain, and enhanced HPK1 kinase activity. Unlike the full-length HPK1, the N-terminal cleaved product failed to bind adaptor molecules Grb2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein 2) and Crk (CT10 regulator of kinase). The C-terminal fragment, although having three proline-rich domains, bound to Grb2 and Crk less efficiently than the full-length HPK1 protein. Taken together, the cleavage of HPK1 by caspase profoundly changed its biochemical properties."
https://openalex.org/W2315706862,"Ku antigen is a complex of Ku70 and Ku80 subunits and plays an important role in not only DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) repair and V(D)J recombination, but also in growth regulation. Ku is generally believed to always form and function as heterodimers on the basis of in vitro observations. Here we demonstrate that the localization of Ku80 does not completely coincide with that of Ku70. Ku70 and Ku80 were colocalized in the nucleus in the interphase but not in the late telophase/early G1 phase of the cell cycle. Since the in vivo function of Ku might be partially regulated by the control of its transport, we attempted to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the nuclear translocation of Ku. The nuclear translocation of Ku80 started during the late telophase/early G1 phase after the nuclear envelope was formed and this was preceded by the nuclear translocation of Ku70. Furthermore, we found that the Ku80 protein was transported to the nucleus without heterodimerization with Ku70. To understand in detail the mechanism of transport of Ku80, we attempted to identify the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of Ku80 and defined to a region spanning nine amino acid residues (positions 561 - 569). The Ku80 NLS was demonstrated to be mediated to the nuclear rim by two components of PTAC58 and PTAC97. All these findings support the idea that Ku80 can translocate to the nucleus using its own NLS independent of the translocation of Ku70."
https://openalex.org/W2328145836,"The mechanisms through which heregulin (HRG) regulates the progression of breast cancer cells to a more invasive phenotype are currently unknown. Recently we have shown that HRG treatment of breast cancer cells leads to the formation of lamellipodia/filopodia, and increased cell migration and invasiveness through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3 kinase). Since the process of cell migration must involve changes in adhesion, we explored the potential HRG regulation of paxillin, a major cytoskeletal phosphoprotein of focal adhesion. We report that HRG stimulation of non-invasive breast cancer cells resulted in stimulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and PI-3K, and a concurrent unexpected increase in the level of paxillin phosphorylation on serine residue which was sensitive to protein-phosphatase 2b but not to protein tyrosine phosphatase 1. In addition, HRG triggered a rapid redistribution of paxillin to the perinuclear regions from the tyrosine-phosphorylated focal adhesions, and increased cell scattering. There was no effect of HRG on the state of phosphorylation and localization of focal adhesion kinase. The HRG-induced increase in serine phosphorylation of paxillin and cell scattering were selectively inhibited by a specific inhibitor of p38MAPK or a dominant-negative p38MAPK mutant, but not by inhibitors of p42/44MAPK or PI-3 kinase pathways. For the first time our results have shown that HRG, a potent migratory growth factor stimulates serine phosphorylation of paxillin. These findings suggest a role of p38MAPK-dependent signal transduction pathway(s) in serine phosphorylation and disassembly of the paxillin from the focal complexes during HRG-induced cell shape alterations and motility."
https://openalex.org/W2329360646,"We have analysed the pattern of beta-catenin expression by immunohistochemistry in mice singly or multiply mutant for Apc, p53 and Msh2. We observed increased expression of beta-catenin in all intestinal lesions arising on an ApcMin+/- background. In all categories of lesion studied mosaic patterns of beta-catenin expression were observed, with the proportion of cells showing enhanced expression decreasing with increasing lesion size. p53 status did not alter these patterns. We also show that beta-catenin dysregulation marks pancreatic abnormalities occurring in ApcMin+/- and (ApcMin+/-, p53-/-) mice. In these mice both adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the pancreas arose and were characterized by increased expression of beta-catenin. We have extended these analyses to intestinal lesions arising in mice mutant for the mismatch repair gene Msh2. In these mice, increased expression of beta-catenin was again observed. However, in contrast with ApcMin+/- mice, a subset of lesions retained normal expression. Taken together, these findings show that increased expression of beta-catenin is an efficient marker of early neoplastic change in both murine intestine and pancreas in Apc mutant mice. However, we also show that dysregulation of beta-catenin is not an obligate step in the development of intestinal lesions, and therefore that genetic events other than the loss of Apc function may initiate the transition from normal to neoplastic epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2332029728,"Retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells are of central importance in the maintenance of neural retinal function. Changes in the RPE cells associated with repair activities have been described as metaplasia, while RPE cell apoptosis is responsible for the development of a variety of retinal degenerations. We investigated the regulation of the anti-apoptotic properties of the fibroblast growth factors (FGF) 2 in serum-free cultures of RPE cells. In the absence of serum, confluent stationary RPE cells died by apoptosis via a caspase 3-dependent pathway. The addition of FGF2 greatly reduced apoptosis over a 7-day culture period. We demonstrated the involvement of an autocrine loop involving endogenous FGF1 in the mechanisms that govern FGF2-induced resistance to apoptosis by showing: (1) higher levels of apoptosis in cells treated with antisense FGF1 oligonucleotide or after neutralization of excreted FGF1; (2) the long-term activation of FGFR1 and of ERK2, (3) the inhibition of FGFR1 and ERK2 activation and an increase in apoptosis if excreted FGF1 was neutralized. FGF2 also increased the de novo synthesis and the production of Bcl-xl before the onset of apoptosis. Both inhibition of ERK2 activation, which decreased Bcl-xl synthesis, and downregulation of Bcl-x by antisense oligonucleotide treatment inhibited the survival-promoting activity of FGF2. Thus, FGF2-induced cell survival is a progressive adaptive phenomenon involving ERK2 activation by excreted FGF1 and ERK2-dependent Bcl-x production."
https://openalex.org/W2335610215,"Transcriptional activation by the tumor suppressor p53 is regulated at multiple levels, including posttranslational modifications of the p53 protein, interaction of p53 with various regulatory proteins, or at the level of sequence-specific DNA binding to the response elements in p53's target genes. We here propose as an additional regulatory mechanism that the DNA topology of p53-responsive promoters may determine the interaction of p53 with its target genes. We demonstrate that sequence-specific DNA binding (SSDB) and transcriptional activation by p53 of the mdm2 promoter is inhibited when this promoter is present in supercoiled DNA, where it forms a non-B-DNA structure which spans the p53-responsive elements. Relaxation of the supercoiled DNA in vitro resulted in conversion of the non-B-DNA to a B-DNA conformation within the mdm2 promoter, and correlated with an enhanced SSDB of p53 and an elevated expression of a reporter gene. In contrast, sequence specific DNA binding and transcriptional activation of the p21 promoter were not inhibited by DNA supercoiling. We propose that conformational alterations within p53-responsive sites, which either promote or prohibit sequence specific DNA binding of p53, are an important feature in orchestrating the activation of different p53 responsive promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2334745804,"Dlk (also termed ZIP kinase) is a novel serine/threonine kinase with a unique C-terminal domain that is rich in arginine and contains three putative NLS motifs and a functional lecuine zipper. Dlk is indeed localized in the nucleus where it shows a speckled distribution. To elucidate the biological functions of Dlk, we wanted to identify the signals relevant for nuclear transport and further the nuclear structures which Dlk binds to. Expression of various deletion and point mutations of Dlk as GFP fusion proteins revealed that the leucine zipper is required for association with speckles and the most C-terminal NLS is necessary and sufficient for nuclear transport. Interestingly, a C-terminal deletion mutant defective for nuclear transport exhibited a pronounced colocalization with actin filaments and, even more strikingly, was a very potent inducer of apoptosis. This apoptotic activity was abrogated, however, when this mutant was retargeted to the nucleus via a heterologous NLS from large T, indicating that Dlk only exerts an apoptotic activity in the cytoplasm. To identify the speckle like structures to which Dlk binds we performed immunofluorescence analyses with antibodies directed against representative marker proteins of replication, transcription, or splicing centers. None of these marker proteins revealed a colocalization with Dlk. Instead, we found a partial colocalization with PML bodies which seem to play a key role in regulation of apoptosis. Taken together, these data strongly suggest a functional role for Dlk in control of cell survival which is dependent on its subcellular localization."
https://openalex.org/W2312435994,"Accurate phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in proteins plays a central role in regulation of cellular function. Although connections between aberrant tyrosine kinase activity and malignancy are well-established, significantly less is known about the roles of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) in tumorigenesis. We have previously shown that the transmembranal form of PTPase Epsilon (PTPε) is upregulated in mouse mammary tumors initiated specifically by ras or neu, suggesting that PTPε may play a role in transformation by these two oncogenes. In order to test this notion in vivo, we created transgenic mice that express elevated levels of PTPε in their mammary epithelium by use of the MMTV promoter/enhancer. Following several cycles of pregnancy female MMTV-PTPε mice uniformly developed pronounced and persistent mammary hyperplasia which was accompanied by residual milk production. Solitary mammary tumors were often detected secondary to mammary hyperplasia. The sporadic nature of the tumors, the long latency period prior to their development, and low levels of transgene expression in the tumors indicate that PTPε provides a necessary, but insufficient, signal for oncogenesis. The results provide genetic evidence that PTPε plays an accessory role in production of mammary tumors in a manner consistent with its upregulation in mammary tumors induced by ras or neu."

https://openalex.org/W2312735157,"High levels of c-myb expression are necessary for the proliferation of hematopoietic precursor cells whereas down-regulation of c-myb is required for terminal differentiation; this down-regulation occurs through a conditional block to transcriptional elongation in intron I. We previously observed that cAMP analogs prevented the late down-regulation of c-myb during hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA)-induced differentiation of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells and blocked differentiation; this correlated with the induction of NF-κB (p50/RelB) complexes which were shown to bind to NF-κB recognition sites flanking the transcriptional pause site of c-myb. We now selected stably-transfected MEL cells which overexpressed p50, RelB or both at levels similar to those induced by cAMP to determine whether these NF-κB proteins regulate c-myb expression in intact cells. We demonstrate that transcriptionally active NF-κB (p50/RelB) complexes, but not p50 or RelB alone, prevented the early and late down-regulation of c-myb mRNA and increased c-myb transcriptional elongation in HMBA-induced MEL cells. The increase in c-myb expression was sufficient to block erythroid differentiation and allow continuous proliferation of cells in the presence of HMBA. Steady-state c-myb mRNA levels in untreated cells were not affected by overexpression of NF-κB, suggesting that p50/RelB specifically modulated the efficiency of transcriptional attenuation during MEL cell differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W1980597862,"Estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer cells display extensive methylation of the ER gene CpG island and elevated DNA methyltransferase (DMT) expression compared to ER-positive cells. The present study demonstrates that DMT protein levels tightly correlate with S phase fraction in ER-positive cells, whereas ER-negative cells express DMT throughout the cell cycle. In addition, levels of p21CIP1, which disrupts DMT binding to PCNA, are inversely correlated with DMT levels. Therefore increased DMT expression in ER-negative cells is not simply due to elevated S-phase fraction, but rather to more complex changes that allow cells to escape normal cell cycle-dependent controls on DMT expression. Because ER-negative breast tumors often have activated growth factor pathways, the impact of these pathways on DMT expression was examined in ER-positive cells. Stable transfection with fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) 1 and 4 led to increased DMT expression that could not be accounted for by a shift in S phase fraction. Elevated DMT protein expression in FGF-transfectants was accompanied by a significant decrease in p21, again suggesting a reciprocal relationship between these two proteins. However, acquisition of an estrogen-independent phenotype, even in conjunction with elevated DMT levels, was not sufficient to promote ER gene silencing via methylation. These results indicate that multiple steps are required for de novo methylation of the ER CpG island."

https://openalex.org/W2062232879,"The proliferation of most normal cells depends on the synergistic interaction of several growth factors and hormones, but the cell cycle basis for this combined requirement remains largely uncharacterized. We have addressed the question of the requirement for insulin/IGF-1 also observed in many cell culture systems in the physiologically relevant system of primary cultures of dog thyroid epithelial cells stimulated by TSH, which exerts its mitogenic activity only via cAMP. The induction of cyclin A and cdc2, the phosphorylation of cdk2, the nuclear translocation of cdk4 and the assembly of cyclin D3-cdk4 complexes required the synergy of TSH and insulin. Cyclin D3 (the most abundant cyclin D) was necessary for the proliferation stimulated by TSH in the presence of insulin as shown by microinjection of a neutralizing antibody. Cyclin D3 accumulation and activity were differentially regulated by insulin and TSH, which points out this cyclin as an integrator that ranks these comitogenic pathways as supportive and activatory, respectively. Paradoxically TSH alone strongly repressed cyclin D3 accumulation. This inhibition was overridden by insulin, which markedly stimulated cyclin D3 mRNA and protein accumulation, but failed to assemble cyclin D3-cdk4 complexes in the absence of TSH. TSH unmasked the DCS-22 epitope of cyclin D3 and assembled cyclin D3-cdk4 in the presence of insulin. These data demonstrate that cyclin D synthesis and cyclin D-cdk assembly can be dissociated and complementarily regulated by different agents and signalling pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2335063558,"Cytogenetic analysis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) identified deletions of chromosome arm 11q. These observations led us to analyse the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome arm 11q in 113 primary childhood ALL samples using 14 microsatellite markers. LOH was found in 18 (16%) patients. Detailed examination identified three distinct regions of deletion. The first region is flanked by D11S901 and D11S1391 at 11q22–23 containing the ATM gene. Mutational analysis suggested that the altered gene in this region is not the ATM gene. The second region is flanked by D11S614 and D11S924 at 11q23 containing the MLL gene. The third region is flanked by D11S1356 and D11S614 at 11q23 containing the MLL gene. All the cases with LOH at MLL locus lacked detectable MLL gene rearrangements. In addition, 20 children have been studied both at initial diagnosis and relapse; none of the individuals who relapsed acquired LOH of 11q, suggesting that 11q deletions were infrequently involved in the progression of childhood ALL. Children with 11q LOH had a good response to induction chemotherapy (P=0.015). These data suggest that alterations of putative tumor suppressor genes on 11q are important events in development of childhood ALL. Our map provides important information toward cloning putative tumor suppressor genes associated with childhood ALL."
https://openalex.org/W1965652709,"The MLL gene is reciprocally translocated with one of a number of different partner genes in a proportion of human acute leukaemias. The precise mechanism of oncogenic transformation is unclear since most of the partner genes encode unrelated proteins. However, two partner genes, AF10 and AF17 are related through the presence of a cysteine rich region and a leucine zipper. The identification of other proteins with these structures will aid our understanding of their role in normal and leukaemic cells. We report the cloning of a novel human gene (BRL) which encodes a protein containing a cysteine rich region related to that of AF10 and AF17 and is overall most closely related to the previously known protein BR140. BRL maps to chromosome 22q13 and shows high levels of expression in testis and several cell lines. The deduced protein sequence also contains a bromodomain, four potential LXXLL motifs and four predicted nuclear localization signals. A monoclonal antibody raised to a BRL peptide sequence confirmed its widespread expression as a 120 Kd protein and demonstrated localization to the nucleus within spermatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2024238240,"We have used two different, but complementary assays to characterize functions of SV40 T antigen that are necessary for its ability to immortalize rat embryo fibroblasts. In accordance with previous work, we found that several functions were required. These include activities that map to the p53 binding domain and the amino terminal 176 amino acids which contain the J domain as well as the CR1 and CR2 domain required for binding and sequestering the RB family of pocket proteins. Moreover, we found that even though activities dependent only upon the amino terminus were sufficient for immortalization they were unable to maintain it. This suggests that immortalization by these amino terminal functions requires either additional events or immortalization of a subset of cells within the heterogeneous rat embryo fibroblast population. We further found that an activity dependent upon amino acids 17 – 27 which remove a portion of the CR1 domain and the predicted α-1 helix of the J domain was not necessary to maintain growth but was required for direct immortalization suggesting that at least one of the functions required initially was not required to maintain the immortal state. This represents the first demonstration that some of the functions required for maintenance of the immortal state differ from those required for initiation of immortalization."

https://openalex.org/W2326114137,"The CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) is expressed in >50% of human breast cancers. To investigate the consequence of CSF-1R expression, hormone-dependent human breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and T-47D, were transfected with CSF-1R. Unexpectedly, CSF-1 substantially inhibited estradiol (E2) and insulin-dependent proliferation of MCF-7 transfectants (MCF-7fms) and prevented cyclin E/cdk2 and cyclin A/cdk2 activation, consistent with a G1 arrest. In contrast, CSF-1 increased DNA synthesis in T-47D transfectants (T-47Dfms) alone and with E2 or insulin. In response to CSF-1, there was a marked and sustained upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21Waf1/Cip1, in MCF-7fms but not T-47Dfms. CSF-1 also markedly upregulated cyclin D1 in MCF-7fms. The coordinate increase in cyclin D1 and p21 had the effect of decreasing the specific but not absolute activity of cyclin D1/cdk4. p53 was not involved since CSF-1 induction of p21 was unaffected by dominant-negative p53 expression. ERK activation by CSF-1 was robust and sustained in MCF-7fms and to a much lesser extent in T-47Dfms. Using pharmacological and transient transfection approaches, we showed that ERK activation was necessary and sufficient for p21 induction in MCF-7fms. Moreover, activated MEK inhibited E2-stimulated cdk2 activity. Our findings indicate that the consequence of CSF-1R-mediated signals in human breast cancer cells is dependent on the genetic background of the particular tumor."
https://openalex.org/W2334409298,"A variety of receptors coupled to the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gq/11 stimulate intracellular Ca2+ release through inositol (1,4,5)-trisphos-phate (IP3) formation. We previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of the α subunit of the Gq/11 protein by protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) regulates the activation of Gq/11 protein. Here we show that protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are also essential for Gq/11 protein activation. We find that Gq/11 protein-coupled receptor-mediated formation of IP3 is blocked by PTP inhibitors as well as PTK inhibitors. These inhibitors act prior to Gq/11 protein activation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the α subunit of Gq/11 appears to inhibit its interaction with receptors. Thus, PTP is required for controlling the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the α subunit of Gq/11 to promote its interaction with receptors. Therefore, we conclude that PTKs and PTPs co-operate to proceed activation cycle of the Gq/11 protein through tyrosine phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation of the α subunit of Gq/11."
https://openalex.org/W2321928655,"Inhibin, a member of the TGF-beta superfamily, is synthesized in the testis by Sertoli cells and exerts an endocrine regulatory function on pituitary hormone synthesis. A distinct local function has been proposed, negatively controlling cellular growth in the testis (tumor suppressor activity). A critical test for the identification of a tumor suppressor is the reversal of transformed growth properties upon re-expression of the gene in tumor-derived cell lines. Sertoli cell-derived tumoral lines were previously established from tumors that develop in elderly transgenic males which express in the testis the large T antigen of polyoma virus. Both the tumors and the cells in culture exhibited reduced levels of the inhibin alpha subunit mRNA. Stable transfectants were generated, in which this subunit was expressed from a heterologous promoter. All of them exhibited a strict inhibition of growth at confluency. On the other hand, in addition to an aging-related decrease in inhibin synthesis, the alpha subunit gene was down regulated in vivo in cells expressing the viral protein. The conjunction of these two factors accounts for the age-related occurrence of testicular cancers in the transgenic model, again pointing to inhibin as a potent cell growth regulator in the seminiferous epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2316629408,"Aberrant communication among growth factors and cytokines that regulate tissue homeostasis often results in malignancy. Among the many cell types that participate in this process, stromal fibroblasts communicate in a paracrine and juxtracrine manner with cells of epithelial, endothelial, and hematopoietic origin. For fibroblasts, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a major proliferative and differentiation agent. Interleukin-4 (IL-4), however, possesses only modulating functions in this cell type. Here, we investigated the consequences of deleting Stat6 on PDGF and IL-4 signaling, proliferation, and transcriptional activation by establishing and characterizing early passage fibroblasts from wild-type and Stat6 null mice. Both wild-type and Stat6−/− fibroblasts showed nearly identical PDGFR and IL-4R activation, gross substrate tyrosine phosphorylation, PI 3-kinase activation, as well as Stat1, 3 and 5 DNA binding activities. Unexpectedly, IL-4's enhancement of PDGF-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation was greatly diminished in Stat6−/−, but not wild-type fibroblasts. PDGF-induced [3H]thymidine uptake was largely unaffected. Strikingly, IL-4, but not PDGF induction of the proinflammatory gene products, IL-6 and MCP-1 was markedly reduced in Stat6−/− fibroblasts. Thus, Stat6 is an important and specific mediator of IL-4-enhanced PDGF-induced proliferation as well as IL-4's transcriptional activation of IL-6 and MCP-1."
https://openalex.org/W2332336193,"The p53 tumour suppressor protein is tightly regulated by protein-protein association, protein turnover and a variety of post-translational modifications. Multisite phosphorylation plays a major role in activating and in finely tuning p53 function. The proline rich domain of murine p53 is a substrate for phosphorylation, in vitro and in cultured cells, by the p42ERK2 and p44ERK1 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. However, to date there have been no reports of attempts to determine whether p53 from any other species is a substrate for MAP kinase. In this paper we confirm that murine p53 is targeted by recombinant MAP kinase and by MAP kinases in extracts of both murine and human cells. In contrast, human p53 is not a substrate for recombinant MAP kinase nor are there any detectable levels of protein kinase activity in stimulated human cell extracts which phosphorylate the proline rich domain of human p53 in vitro. Finally, although stimulation of murine fibroblasts with o-tetradecanolylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), an indirect activator of the MAP kinase pathway, leads to site-specific phosphorylation of murine p53, similar treatment of human fibroblasts and epithelial cells showed no significant changes in the phosphorylation pattern. These data are consistent with accumulating evidence that significant species-dependent differences exist in the post-translational modification of p53."
