https://openalex.org/W3155004337,"The development of a portfolio of COVID-19 vaccines to vaccinate the global population remains an urgent public health imperative1. Here we demonstrate the capacity of a subunit vaccine, comprising the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain displayed on an I53-50 protein nanoparticle scaffold (hereafter designated RBD-NP), to stimulate robust and durable neutralizing-antibody responses and protection against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques. We evaluated five adjuvants including Essai O/W 1849101, a squalene-in-water emulsion; AS03, an α-tocopherol-containing oil-in-water emulsion; AS37, a Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist adsorbed to alum; CpG1018-alum, a TLR9 agonist formulated in alum; and alum. RBD-NP immunization with AS03, CpG1018-alum, AS37 or alum induced substantial neutralizing-antibody and CD4 T cell responses, and conferred protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pharynges, nares and bronchoalveolar lavage. The neutralizing-antibody response to live virus was maintained up to 180 days after vaccination with RBD-NP in AS03 (RBD-NP-AS03), and correlated with protection from infection. RBD-NP immunization cross-neutralized the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant efficiently but showed a reduced response against the B.1.351 variant. RBD-NP-AS03 produced a 4.5-fold reduction in neutralization of B.1.351 whereas the group immunized with RBD-NP-AS37 produced a 16-fold reduction in neutralization of B.1.351, suggesting differences in the breadth of the neutralizing-antibody response induced by these adjuvants. Furthermore, RBD-NP-AS03 was as immunogenic as a prefusion-stabilized spike immunogen (HexaPro) with AS03 adjuvant. These data highlight the efficacy of the adjuvanted RBD-NP vaccine in promoting protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and have led to phase I/II clinical trials of this vaccine (NCT04742738 and NCT04750343)."
https://openalex.org/W3154757366,"Studies on the real-life effect of the BNT162b2 vaccine for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention are urgently needed. In this study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of data from the Israeli Ministry of Health collected between 28 August 2020 and 24 February 2021. We studied the temporal dynamics of the number of new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations after the vaccination campaign, which was initiated on 20 December 2020. To distinguish the possible effects of the vaccination on cases and hospitalizations from other factors, including a third lockdown implemented on 8 January 2021, we performed several comparisons: (1) individuals aged 60 years and older prioritized to receive the vaccine first versus younger age groups; (2) the January lockdown versus the September lockdown; and (3) early-vaccinated versus late-vaccinated cities. A larger and earlier decrease in COVID-19 cases and hospitalization was observed in individuals older than 60 years, followed by younger age groups, by the order of vaccination prioritization. This pattern was not observed in the previous lockdown and was more pronounced in early-vaccinated cities. Our analysis demonstrates the real-life effect of a national vaccination campaign on the pandemic dynamics. A retrospective analysis of data from the Israeli Ministry of Health collected between 28 August 2020 and 24 February 2021 documents the real-life effect of a national vaccination campaign on the pandemic dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W3156441252,"UK Biobank is a major prospective epidemiological study, including multimodal brain imaging, genetics and ongoing health outcomes. Previously, we published genome-wide associations of 3,144 brain imaging-derived phenotypes, with a discovery sample of 8,428 individuals. Here we present a new open resource of genome-wide association study summary statistics, using the 2020 data release, almost tripling the discovery sample size. We now include the X chromosome and new classes of imaging-derived phenotypes (subcortical volumes and tissue contrast). Previously, we found 148 replicated clusters of associations between genetic variants and imaging phenotypes; in this study, we found 692, including 12 on the X chromosome. We describe some of the newly found associations, focusing on the X chromosome and autosomal associations involving the new classes of imaging-derived phenotypes. Our novel associations implicate, for example, pathways involved in the rare X-linked STAR (syndactyly, telecanthus and anogenital and renal malformations) syndrome, Alzheimer's disease and mitochondrial disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3153769365,"Decisions are held in memory until enacted, which makes them potentially vulnerable to distracting sensory input. Gating of information flow from sensory to motor areas could protect memory from interference during decision-making, but the underlying network mechanisms are not understood. Here, we trained mice to detect optogenetic stimulation of the somatosensory cortex, with a delay separating sensation and action. During the delay, distracting stimuli lost influence on behavior over time, even though distractor-evoked neural activity percolated through the cortex without attenuation. Instead, choice-encoding activity in the motor cortex became progressively less sensitive to the impact of distractors. Reverse engineering of neural networks trained to reproduce motor cortex activity revealed that the reduction in sensitivity to distractors was caused by a growing separation in the neural activity space between attractors that encode alternative decisions. Our results show that communication between brain regions can be gated via attractor dynamics, which control the degree of commitment to an action. The flow of information in the brain is regulated over space and time. The authors show that mice can adaptively filter stimuli originating in the sensory cortex. The stimuli are gated by attractor dynamics in the frontal cortex, revealing a mechanism of gating of neural information."
https://openalex.org/W3154039181,"Integrating large single-cell gene expression, chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation datasets requires general and scalable computational approaches. Here we describe online integrative non-negative matrix factorization (iNMF), an algorithm for integrating large, diverse and continually arriving single-cell datasets. Our approach scales to arbitrarily large numbers of cells using fixed memory, iteratively incorporates new datasets as they are generated and allows many users to simultaneously analyze a single copy of a large dataset by streaming it over the internet. Iterative data addition can also be used to map new data to a reference dataset. Comparisons with previous methods indicate that the improvements in efficiency do not sacrifice dataset alignment and cluster preservation performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of online iNMF by integrating more than 1 million cells on a standard laptop, integrating large single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic datasets, and iteratively constructing a single-cell multi-omic atlas of the mouse motor cortex."
https://openalex.org/W3156828529,"Many cognitive processes require communication between the neocortex and the hippocampus. However, coordination between large-scale cortical dynamics and hippocampal activity is not well understood, partially due to the difficulty in simultaneously recording from those regions. In the present study, we developed a flexible, insertable and transparent microelectrode array (Neuro-FITM) that enables investigation of cortical–hippocampal coordinations during hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs). Flexibility and transparency of Neuro-FITM allow simultaneous recordings of local field potentials and neural spiking from the hippocampus during wide-field calcium imaging. These experiments revealed that diverse cortical activity patterns accompanied SWRs and, in most cases, cortical activation preceded hippocampal SWRs. We demonstrated that, during SWRs, different hippocampal neural population activity was associated with distinct cortical activity patterns. These results suggest that hippocampus and large-scale cortical activity interact in a selective and diverse manner during SWRs underlying various cognitive functions. Our technology can be broadly applied to comprehensive investigations of interactions between the cortex and other subcortical structures. Liu et al. present a flexible, insertable and transparent microelectrode (FITM) array termed Neuro-FITM. Multimodal recordings with Neuro-FITM reveal diverse and selective large-scale cortical activation patterns associated with hippocampal sharp-wave ripples."

https://openalex.org/W3153711543,"The evolutionary and genetic origins of the specialized body plan of flatfish are largely unclear. We analyzed the genomes of 11 flatfish species representing 9 of the 14 Pleuronectiforme families and conclude that Pleuronectoidei and Psettodoidei do not form a monophyletic group, suggesting independent origins from different percoid ancestors. Genomic and transcriptomic data indicate that genes related to WNT and retinoic acid pathways, hampered musculature and reduced lipids might have functioned in the evolution of the specialized body plan of Pleuronectoidei. Evolution of Psettodoidei involved similar but not identical genes. Our work provides valuable resources and insights for understanding the genetic origins of the unusual body plan of flatfishes."

Plasma 25(OH)D3 concentrations in Cyp24a1 KO rats were approximately twofold higher than in wild-type rats. Wild-type rats showed five metabolites of 25(OH)D3 in plasma following oral administration of 25(OH)D3, and these metabolites were not detected in Cyp24a1 KO rats. Among these metabolites, 25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone was identified as the second major metabolite with a significantly higher Tmax value than others. When 23S,25(OH)2D3 was administered to Cyp24a1 KO rats, neither 23,25,26(OH)3D3 nor 25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone was observed. However, when 23S,25R,26(OH)3D3 was administered to Cyp24a1 KO rats, plasma 25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone was detected. These results suggested that CYP24A1 is responsible for the conversion of 25(OH)D3 to 23,25,26(OH)3D3 via 23,25(OH)2D3, but enzyme(s) other than CYP24A1 may be involved in the conversion of 23,25,26(OH)3D3 to 25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone. Enzymatic studies using recombinant human CYP species and the inhibitory effects of ketoconazole suggested that CYP3A plays an essential role in the conversion of 23,25,26(OH)3D3 into 25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone in both rats and humans. Taken together, our data indicate that Cyp24a1 KO rats are valuable for metabolic studies of vitamin D and its analogs. In addition, long-term administration of 25(OH)D3 to Cyp24a1 KO rats at 110 μg/kg body weight/day resulted in significant weight loss and ectopic calcification.

Vitamin D3 is metabolized by CYP2R1 and CYP27A1 to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) in the liver and by CYP27B1 to 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) in the kidneys, thereby binding to vitamin D receptors (VDRs) and exhibiting various physiological effects. The key enzyme in the metabolism of 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 is CYP24A1, which is known to generate multiple metabolites via C-24 and C-23 hydroxylation pathways (1Jones G. Prosser D.E.

Biosci. 2005; 10: 119-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are two vitamin D responsive elements in the promoter region of the CYP24A1 gene, and the binding of active vitamin D to VDRs leads to profound transcriptional induction of CYP24A1. The resultant CYP24A1 protein inactivates the active form of vitamin D. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining constant plasma levels of active vitamin D. CYP24A1 dysfunction causes elevated plasma levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 and is associated with idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia or kidney stones, which indicates the importance of this enzyme for vitamin D metabolism (3Nesterova G.

We identified that rat CYP24A1 catalyzes a six-step reaction commencing with 24R-position hydroxylation, leading to calcitroic acid, which is designated as the C-24 pathway. In contrast, human CYP24A1 catalyzes a four-step reaction starting at position 23S, leading to the formation of a 26,23-lactone. The ratios of the C-23 and C-24 pathways vary among species. For human CYP24A1, the ratio in the initial reactions of C-23 and C-24 is approximately 1:4, whereas in rat CYP24A1, it is approximately 1:25 (6Kusudo T. Sakaki T. Abe D. Fujishima T. Kittaka A.

Our focus is investigating which steps of the C-24 and C-23 pathways are carried out only by CYP24A1 and which steps contribute to the extent of involvement by other enzymes. Although Cyp24a1 KO mice appear to be useful, it is difficult to evaluate detailed time courses of metabolites in terms of blood sampling volumes possible in small rodents. Recently, we successfully generated genetically modified (GM) rats deficient in Cyp27b1 or Vdr genes (17Nishikawa M. Yasuda K. Takamatsu M. Abe K. Okamoto K. Horibe K. Mano H. Nakagawa K. Tsugawa N.

Rep. 2020; 10: 5677Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Type II rickets model rats with a mutant Vdr (R270L), which recognizes 1,25(OH)2D3 with an affinity equivalent to that of 25(OH)D3, were also generated. Although Cyp27b1-knockout (KO), Vdr-KO, and Vdr (R270L) rats exhibit rickets symptoms, they are significantly different to each other. Comparison among WT and three types of GM rats led to novel concepts regarding vitamin D actions, including genomic and nongenomic actions. In this study, we generated Cyp24a1 KO rats and succeeded in measuring the time course of 25(OH)D3 plasma levels and its metabolites after the administration of 25(OH)D3. Furthermore, we revealed for the first time that not only CYP24A1, but also CYP3A1/2 is involved in the bioconversion of 23S,25,26(OH)3D3 to 25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone, which is known to have a biological activity to reduce serum Ca level (18Ishizuka S.

In order to obtain authentic standards for 25(OH)D3 metabolites, 25(OH)D3 was metabolized in a reconstituted system containing rat recombinant CYP24A1 expressed in E. coli cells. As shown in Figure 1A, 24R,25(OH)2D3, 23S,25(OH)2D3, 24-oxo-25(OH)D3, 24-oxo-23,25(OH)2D3, and tetranor-23(OH)D3 were isolated as authentic standards. Although 24R,25(OH)2D3 and 23S,25(OH)2D3 were eluted at the same retention time (Fig. 1A), they were clearly separated by normal-phase HPLC, as described previously (6Kusudo T. Sakaki T. Abe D.

Commun. 2004; 321: 774-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All of the metabolites standards showed an absorbance maximum at 265 nm. The purity of 24R,25(OH)2D3, 24-oxo-25(OH)D3, 24-oxo-23,25(OH)2D3, and tetranor-23(OH)D3 was estimated to be 94, 92, 84, 95%, respectively, based on HPLC-UV profiles. Figure 1B presents the HPLC profile of 25(OH)D3 and its metabolites in the plasma of WT rats 24 h after 25(OH)D3 administration. A metabolite at a retention time of 19.8 min, which was not detected in vitro, was detected in rat plasma (Fig. 1, B and C). The DMEQ-TAD adduct of this metabolite showed the same LC retention time and similar MS and MS/MS patterns to those of the synthetic standard of (23S,25R)-25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone. These results appear to be consistent with the finding that one of the major metabolites of 25(OH)D3 in the plasma of 25(OH)D3-treated rats is (23S,25R)-25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone (9Napoli J.L.

Thus, the peak observed at a retention time of 19.8 min (Fig. 1B) was identified as (23S,25R)-25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone. Ion spectra involving DMEQ-TAD adducts of 25(OH)D3, 24,25(OH)2D3, and 25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone were similar to those shown in our previous study (11Nishikawa M. Yasuda K. Takamatsu M. Abe K.

The ion product spectra of DMEQ-TAD adducts of 24,25(OH)2D3, 24-oxo-25(OH)D3, 24-oxo-23,25(OH)2D3, tetranor-23(OH)D3, 25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone, and 23,25,26(OH)3D3 are shown in Figure S1. The major characteristic ions for DMEQ-TAD adducts of 24,25(OH)2D3, 24-oxo-25(OH)D3, 24-oxo-23,25(OH)2D3, tetranor-25(OH)D3, 25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone, and 23,25,26(OH)3D3 were their molecular ion species [M + H] at m/z of 762.4, 760.4, 776.4, 690.4, 774.4, and 778.4, respectively, and fragment ions at m/z 247 and 468 were detected as major ion products of all compounds (Fig. S1). The ion fragment at m/z 468 was selected for multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) analysis, as shown in Table S1, because of greater specificity and lower background than the fragment at m/z 247. Chromatograms for each metabolite are shown in Figure S1. Two peaks for each metabolite were detected, which represented the 6R- and 6S- isomers of the DMEQ-TAD adduct of each metabolite, as in the case of 25(OH)D3 reported in a previous study (20Higashi T.

Twenty-six offspring were obtained, one of which had a 1 bp insertion at a target site. Consequently, 30 amino acid residues from 439 to 469 were substituted, resulting in the introduction of a premature stop codon at residue 469 (Fig. S2). This frame shift causes loss of the cysteine residue at position 462, which is the fifth ligand of heme iron and the active center, and causes a deletion involving the C-terminal portion of CYP24A1, which consists of 514 amino acids. Thus, this truncated CYP24A1 could not show enzymatic activity. Homozygotes for this mutant CYP24A1 allele were used in this study. We confirmed that no off-target site (OTS) events occurred in potential OTSs searched using the CRISPR Direct tool for CYP24A1 sgRNA (Fig. S3). No significant difference was observed in the appearance and growth rate between Cyp24a1 KO and WT rats (Fig. 2). Femoral length in Cyp24a1 KO rats at 15 weeks of age was similar to that of WT rats. CT scanning, von Kossa staining, and toluidine blue staining of femora revealed no noticeable differences between Cyp24a1 KO and WT rats (Fig. S4). St-Arnaud (21St-Arnaud R. Targeted inactivation of vitamin D hydroxylases in mice.Bone. 1999; 25: 127-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) demonstrated that 50% of Cyp24a1 KO mice (homozygous mutant) died before 3 weeks of age, but no such situation was observed with Cyp24a1 KO rats. μCT scans showed no particular symptoms such as soft tissue calcification (data not shown). Neither plasma Ca and P levels nor parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were significantly different between Cyp24a1 KO and WT rats (Table 1).Table 1Plasma concentration of Ca, P, and PTH of WT and Cyp24a1 KO rats at 15 weeks of agePlasma Ca, P, and PTH levelsWTCYP24a1 KOCa (mg/dl)9.4 ± 0.49.5 ± 0.5P (mg/dl)7.9 ± 0.67.5 ± 0.2PTH (pg/ml)200 ± 90260 ± 29Each value represents the mean ± SD (n = 5–8; biological replicates).

Plasma concentrations of 25(OH)D3 and its metabolites in WT and Cyp24a1 KO rats before 25(OH)D3 administration were compared (Fig. 3, A and B and Table 2). 25(OH)D3, 24,25(OH)2D3, and 24-oxo-25(OH)D3 were detected in the plasma of WT rats. As shown in Table 3, approximately twice as much 25(OH)D3 was detected in the plasma of Cyp24a1 KO rats than in the plasma of WT animals, whereas 24,25(OH)2D3 and 24-oxo-25(OH)D3 were not detected (<0.8 nM and 1 nM for 24,25(OH)2D3 and 24-oxo-25(OH)D3, respectively), which suggested that CYP24A1-dependent metabolites were not detected in Cyp24a1 KO rats. Plasma concentrations of 25(OH)D3, 24,25(OH)2D3, and 24-oxo-25(OH)D3 in Cyp24a1 mutant-heterozygous rats were 15.4 ± 8.1, 22.0 ± 10.2, and 5.6 ± 2.1 nM, respectively, similar to those of WT rats.

In the next step, 25(OH)D3 was orally administered to WT or Cyp24a1 KO rats at 200 μg/kg body weight, and plasma concentrations of 25(OH)D3 and its metabolites were examined periodically over 0–48 h. After 25(OH)D3 administration, plasma 25(OH)D3 concentrations in Cyp24a1 KO rats were markedly elevated than in WT animals (Figs. 3 and 4). The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of 25(OH)D3 in Cyp24a1 KO rats was four times higher than that in WT rats (Table 3 and Fig. 4). Figure 3, C and D show the MRM chart of 25(OH)D3 and its metabolites in rat plasma 4 h after administration of 25(OH)D3. In addition to 24,25(OH)2D3 and 24-oxo-25(OH)D3, three metabolites 24-oxo-23,25(OH)2D3, tetranor-23(OH)D3, and 25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone were detected in WT rats, whereas none of these were detected in Cyp24a1 KO rats. Figure 5 shows the time course of plasma concentration of all metabolites detected in WT rats. Among the five metabolites detected in WT rats, 24,25(OH)2D3, 24-oxo-25(OH)D3, and 25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone remained at high plasma concentrations 48 h after administration. It is noted that they are known to have a high vitamin D binding protein (DBP)-binding affinity (22Bouillon R. Okamura W.H. Norman A.W. Structure-function relationships in the vitamin D endocrine system.Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 200-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is reasonable to assume that the half-life (t1/2) in plasma of these metabolites is closely linked to their affinity for DBP.Figure 5Time courses of plasma concentration of 25(OH)D3 and its metabolites in WT rats after single dose administration of 25(OH)D3.

The Tmax values of 25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone compared with those of other metabolites, with no detection of 25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone in our in vitro system containing recombinant rat CYP24A1 (Fig. 1), strongly suggested the likely involvement of enzyme(s) other than CYP24A1 in the formation of 25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone. As described above, 25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone has been previously reported to be detected as a 25(OH)D3 metabolite, and its structure has been reported to be (23S,25R)-26,23-lactone-25(OH)D3(19). It has also been reported that this metabolite is generated from 25(OH)D3 via 23S,25(OH)2D3 and 23S,25R,26(OH)3D3 (9Napoli J.L. Pramanik B.C. Partridge J.J. Uskokovic M.R.

To investigate the participation of CYP24A1 and other enzyme(s) in 25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone formation in vivo, 23S,25(OH)2D3 and 23S,25R,26(OH)3D3 were separately administered to Cyp24a1 KO rats and examined for the formation of 25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone. As shown in Figure 3, no conversion of 25(OH)D3 into 23S,25(OH)2D3 was observed in Cyp24a1 KO rats. When 23S,25(OH)2D3 was administered to Cyp24a1 KO rats, neither 23,25,26(OH)3D3 nor 25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone was detected (Fig. 6C). These results strongly suggested that CYP24A1 is responsible for the conversion of 25(OH)D3 into 23S,25,26(OH)3D3 via 23S,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 7). However, when 23S,25R,26(OH)3D3 was administered to Cyp24a1 KO rats, 25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone was detected in the plasma (Fig. 6, B and D). These results strongly suggested that conversion of 25(OH)D3 to 23S,25R,26(OH)3D3 via 23S,25(OH)2D3 is catalyzed by CYP24A1, but enzymes other than CYP24A1 are involved in the conversion of 23S,25R,26(OH)3D3 to 25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone.Figure 725(OH)D3 metabolic pathway in rats based on the previous (2Sakaki T.

Here we describe an imaging-free framework to localize high-throughput readouts within a tissue by cutting the sample into thin strips in a way that allows subsequent image reconstruction. We implemented this framework to transform a low-input RNA sequencing protocol into an imaging-free spatial transcriptomics technique (called STRP-seq) and validated it by profiling the spatial transcriptome of the mouse brain. We applied the technique to the brain of the Australian bearded dragon, Pogona vitticeps. Our results reveal the molecular anatomy of the telencephalon of this lizard, providing evidence for a marked regionalization of the reptilian pallium and subpallium. We expect that STRP-seq can be used to derive spatially resolved data from a range of other omics techniques. A refined spatial sampling technique transforms standard RNA sequencing into a spatial transcriptomics method."
https://openalex.org/W3154617605,"Canine acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome (AHDS) has been associated in some studies with Clostridioides perfringens overgrowth and toxin-mediated necrosis of the intestinal mucosa. We aimed to determine the effect of a single fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on clinical scores and fecal microbiomes of 1 and 7 dogs with AHDS from New Zealand and South Africa. We hypothesized that FMT would improve AHDS clinical scores and increase microbiota alpha-diversity and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing microbial communities’ abundances in dogs with AHDS after FMT. We sequenced the V3-V4 region of the 16S-rRNA gene in the feces of AHDS FMT-recipients and sham-treated control dogs, and their healthy donors at admission, discharge, and 30 days post-discharge. There were no significant differences in median AHDS clinical scores between FMT-recipients and sham-treated controls at admission or discharge (P = 0.22, P = 0.41). At admission, the Shannon diversity index (SDI) was lower in AHDS dogs than healthy donors (P = 0.002). The SDI did not change from admission to 30 days in sham-treated dogs yet increased in FMT-recipients from admission to discharge (P = 0.04) to levels not different than donors (P = 0.33) but significantly higher than sham-treated controls (P = 0.002). At 30 days, the SDI did not differ between FMT recipients, sham-treated controls, and donors (P = 0.88). Principal coordinate analysis of the Bray-Curtis index separated post-FMT and donor dogs from pre-FMT and sham-treated dogs (P = 0.009) because of increased SCFA-producing genera’s abundances after FMT. A single co-abundance subnetwork contained many of the same OTUs found to be differentially abundant in FMT-recipients, and the abundance of this module was increased in FMT-recipients at discharge and 30 days, compared to sham-treated controls. We conclude in this small pilot study FMT did not have any clinical benefit. A single FMT procedure has the potential to increase bacterial communities of SCFA-producing genera important for intestinal health up to 30 days post-FMT."

However, whether RseP has additional cellular functions is unclear. In this study, we used mass spectrometry–based quantitative proteomic analysis to search for new substrates that might reveal unknown physiological roles for RseP. Our data showed that the levels of several Fec system proteins encoded by the fecABCDE operon (fec operon) were significantly decreased in an RseP-deficient strain. The Fec system is responsible for the uptake of ferric citrate, and the transcription of the fec operon is controlled by FecI, an alternative sigma factor, and its regulator FecR, a single-pass transmembrane protein. Assays with a fec operon expression reporter demonstrated that the proteolytic activity of RseP is essential for the ferric citrate–dependent upregulation of the fec operon. Analysis using the FecR protein and FecR-derived model proteins showed that FecR undergoes sequential processing at the membrane and that RseP participates in the last step of this sequential processing to generate the N-terminal cytoplasmic fragment of FecR that participates in the transcription of the fec operon with FecI. A shortened FecR construct was not dependent on RseP for activation, confirming this cleavage step is the essential and sufficient role of RseP.

While bacterial cellular membranes act as a barrier to protect a cell from extrinsic damages caused by various xenobiotics and hazardous changes in environmental conditions, they must mediate not only selective import of nutrients and other small molecules but also transduction of signals from the external milieu to adapt to environmental changes. A variety of mechanisms exist to transmit information across the membrane. Among them, regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) is a crucial mechanism conserved among all kingdoms (1Brown M.S. Ye J.

Intramembrane proteolysis.Chem. Rev. 2009; 109: 1599-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In RIP, a class of membrane proteases called intramembrane proteases (IMPs) mediate transmembrane (TM) signaling through the cleavage of target membrane proteins. IMPs are unique membrane-integrated proteases in that they have their proteolytic active site located within the lipid bilayer and catalyze proteolysis in the membrane. IMPs are classified into four families: site-2 protease (S2P; zinc metallopeptidase), rhomboid protease (serine protease), presenilin/signal peptide peptidase (aspartyl protease), and Rce1 (glutamyl protease) (3Sun L.

Escherichia coli RseP is one of the most well-studied members of the S2P family proteases. RseP was first identified as a key factor that regulates the σE extracytoplasmic stress response through the cleavage of a single membrane-spanning anti-σE protein, RseA (9Kanehara K. Ito K.

DegS and YaeL participate sequentially in the cleavage of RseA to activate the σE-dependent extracytoplasmic stress response.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2156-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In the σE extracytoplasmic stress response, the accumulations of misfolded outer membrane proteins and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis intermediates in the cell envelope act as stress cues to induce the cleavage of RseA by DegS, a membrane-anchored serine protease, on the periplasmic side (site-1 cleavage). This first cleavage triggers the following RseP-catalyzed second cleavage of RseA inside the membrane (site-2 cleavage), leading to liberation from the membrane of the RseA cytoplasmic domain fragment complexed with σE. Finally, degradation of the RseA cytoplasmic domain fragment by cytoplasmic proteases such as ClpXP activates σE to induce the transcription of stress genes (12Kroos L. Akiyama Y. Biochemical and structural insights into intramembrane metalloprotease mechanisms.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1828: 2873-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Ades S.E. Regulation by destruction: Design of the σE envelope stress response.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2008; 11: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The first cleavage of RseA by DegS is a prerequisite for the subsequent site-2 cleavage by RseP. Similarly, most of the other S2P family proteases are known to catalyze intramembrane proteolysis of a target protein only after preceding trimming of the substrate on the extracytoplasmic side by other protease(s). E. coli RseP has also been shown to eliminate remnant signal peptides generated during the membrane translocation of presecretory proteins that would contribute to the quality control of the cytoplasmic membrane (14Saito A.

According to this model, the DegS-cleaved form of RseA that has lost most of its periplasmic domain (leaving a ~30 a. a.

The TM segments of the known substrates of RseP share no detectable homology in their primary sequences, suggesting that RseP does not recognize a specific sequence motif(s) in the TM segment of a substrate for its cleavage. Mutational analysis of the TM segments of model substrates showed that the stability of their helical structures is an important determinant for their susceptibility to RseP (28Akiyama K. Mizuno S.

Consistently, RseP homologs in other bacteria cleave a variety of membrane proteins with no apparent sequence homology. The sequence diversity of the RseP/S2P substrates makes it difficult to predict potential substrates from a simple sequence analysis of TM sequences of membrane proteins. It would thus be reasonable to assume that RseP still has unidentified substrates and plays important roles in some cellular processes by cleaving these substrates, and a more comprehensive approach is needed to search for novel substrates and cellular functions of RseP. In this study, we employed a proteomic approach to achieve the above objective. Proteomic analysis is a powerful technique to identify novel substrates of proteases as reported previously (30Began J.

We found that the accumulation of several proteins encoded in the fecABCDE operon (fec operon) decreased considerably in the RseP-deficient strain.

These results uncover the details of the FecR processing in the ferric citrate–induced TM signaling and a new physiological role of RseP in the iron uptake in response to the environmental conditions in E. coli. For comprehensive understanding of the cellular functions of RseP in E. coli, we attempted to identify new physiological substrates of RseP by a quantitative proteomic approach. We expected that this analysis would enable us to find not only direct proteolytic substrates of RseP but also proteins whose expression is regulated as a result of substrate proteolysis by RseP. We compared the protein levels in the membrane fractions prepared from the ΔrseA ΔrseP mutant strain expressing the WT or a proteolytically inactive form (a mutant having a Glu-23 to Gln alteration (E23Q) in the conserved zinc metallopeptidase active site motif, HE23xxH) of RseP from a plasmid. Although the rseP gene is essential for growth, it can be deleted in the absence of the functional rseA gene encoding anti-σE protein RseA, a physiological substrate of RseP. In both the strains, σE is constitutively activated because of the absence of RseA, and thus, we can exclude the possible changes in protein expression resulting from RseP-dependent induction of the σE stress response. The membrane fractions were prepared from these strains grown to mid-log phase in L broth containing 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), an inducer of the plasmid-encoded RseP derivatives, and subject to nanoLC/MS/MS analysis. As a result, we identified 13,815 unique peptides derived from 1419 proteins (E. coli strain K-12). Among the identified proteins, 17 exhibited a significant (p < 0.05) increase, whereas 41 exhibited a significant decrease in the samples prepared from the RseP(E23Q)-expressing strain compared with the samples prepared from RseP(WT)-expressing strain (Table 1 and Table S1).

Although these proteins accumulated under the RseP-deficient condition, they are unlikely to be the direct substrates of RseP, as S2P proteases generally cleave a single membrane-spanning protein with type II membrane topology. The top three of the latter group were FecA, FecD, and FecE, which also exhibited a fold change greater than 2. These proteins constitute the Fec system, one of the iron uptake systems in E. coli. Expression of these proteins is known to be induced in response to the availability of environmental iron. The decrease in their levels in the RseP-deficient strain indicates that they should also not be the direct substrates of RseP. However, because it has been shown that many bacterial S2P proteases are involved in cellular responses to environmental changes including the availability of iron (e.g., B. bronchiseptica HurR (21King-Lyons N.D.

Although the regional background of a company significantly determines how the concept of I4.0 can be introduced, the regional aspects of digital transformation are often neglected with regard to the analysis of I4.0 readiness. Based on the analysis of the I4.0 readiness models, the external regional success factors of the implementation of I4.0 solutions are determined. An I4.0+ (regional Industry 4.0) readiness model, a specific indicator system is developed to foster medium-term regional I4.0 readiness analysis and foresight planning. The indicator system is based on three types of data sources: (1) open governmental data; (2) alternative metrics like the number of I4.0-related publications and patent applications; and (3) the number of news stories related to economic and industrial development. The indicators are aggregated to the statistical regions (NUTS 2), and their relationships analyzed using the Sum of Ranking Differences (SRD) and Promethee II methods. The developed I4.0+ readiness index correlates with regional economic, innovation and competitiveness indexes, which indicates the importance of boosting regional I4.0 readiness."

https://openalex.org/W3152589791,"Nonshivering thermogenesis is essential for mammals to maintain body temperature. According to the canonical view, temperature is sensed by cutaneous thermoreceptors and nerve impulses transmitted to the hypothalamus, which generates sympathetic signals to s-adrenergic receptors in brown adipocytes. The energy for heat generation is primarily provided by the oxidation of fatty acids derived from triglyceride hydrolysis and cellular uptake. Fatty acids also activate the uncoupling protein, UCP1, which creates a proton leak that uncouples mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation from ATP production, resulting in energy dissipation as heat. Recent evidence supports the idea that in response to mild cold, s-adrenergic signals stimulate not only lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation, but also act through the mTORC2-Akt signaling module to stimulate de novo lipogenesis. This opposing anabolic effect is thought to maintain lipid fuel stores during increased catabolism. We show here, using brown fat-specific Gs-alpha knockout mice and cultured adipocytes that, unlike mild cold, severe cold directly cools brown fat and bypasses s-adrenergic signaling to inhibit mTORC2. This cell-autonomous effect both inhibits lipogenesis and augments UCP1 expression to enhance thermogenesis. These findings suggest a novel mechanism for overriding s-adrenergic-stimulated anabolic activities while augmenting catabolic activities to resolve the homeostatic crisis presented by severe cold."
https://openalex.org/W3156169135,"Estrogen receptor alpha (ER)-positive breast cancer is commonly treated with endocrine therapies, including antiestrogens that bind and inhibit ER activity, and aromatase inhibitors that suppress estrogen biosynthesis to inhibit estrogen-dependent ER activity. Paradoxically, treatment with estrogens such as 17b-estradiol can also be effective against ER+ breast cancer. Despite the known efficacy of estrogen therapy, the lack of a predictive biomarker of response and understanding of the mechanism of action have contributed to its limited clinical use. Herein, we demonstrate that ER overexpression confers resistance to estrogen deprivation through ER activation in human ER+ breast cancer cells and xenografts grown in mice. However, ER overexpression and the associated high levels of ER transcriptional activation converted 17b-estradiol from a growth-promoter to a growth-suppressor, offering a targetable therapeutic vulnerability and a potential means of identifying patients likely to benefit from estrogen therapy. Since ER+ breast cancer cells and tumors ultimately developed resistance to continuous estrogen deprivation or continuous 17b-estradiol treatment, we tested schedules of alternating treatments. Oscillation of ER activity through cycling of 17b-estradiol and estrogen deprivation provided long-term control of patient-derived xenografts, offering a novel endocrine-only strategy to manage ER+ breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3152741254,"In most group-living animals, a dominance hierarchy reduces the costs of competition for limited resources. Dominance ranks may reflect prior attributes, such as body size, related to fighting ability or reflect the history of self-reinforcing effects of winning and losing a conflict (the winner-loser effect), or both. As to prior attributes, in sexually dimorphic species, where males are larger than females, males are assumed to be dominant over females. As to the winner-loser effect, the computational model DomWorld has shown that despite the female’s lower initial fighting ability, females achieve some degree of dominance of females over males. In the model, this degree of female dominance increases with the proportion of males in a group. This increase was supposed to emerge from the higher fraction of fights of males among themselves. These correlations were confirmed in despotic macaques, vervet monkeys, and in humans. Here, we first investigate this hypothesis in DomWorld and next in long-term data of 9,300 observation hours on six wild groups of robust capuchin monkeys ( Sapajus libidinosus ; S . nigritus , and S . xanthosternos ) in three Brazilian sites. We test whether both the proportion of males and degree of female dominance over males are indeed associated with a higher relative frequency of aggression among males and a higher relative frequency of aggression of females to males. We confirm these correlations in DomWorld. Next, we confirm in empirical data of capuchin monkeys that with the proportion of males in the group there is indeed an increase in female dominance over males, and in the relative frequency of both male-male aggression and aggression of females to males and that the female dominance index is significantly positively associated with male male aggression. Our results reveal that adult sex ratio influences the power relation between the sexes beyond predictions from socioecological models."

Indeed, genetic deletion of IL-6 alleviates various complications associated with poor clinical outcomes including the adverse remodeling of adipose tissue, cachexia and hepatic steatosis. Thus, pharmacological blockade of IL-6 may be a more favorable treatment option to fully restore metabolic function after injury. To test this, we investigated the safety and effectiveness of blocking IL-6 for post-burn hypermetabolism using a validated anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody (mAb) in our experimental murine model. Here, we show daily anti-IL-6 mAb administration protects against burn-induced weight loss (P < .0001) without any adverse effect on mortality. At the organ level, post-burn treatment with the IL-6 blocker suppressed the thermogenic activation of adipose tissue (P < .01) and its associated wasting (P < .05). The reduction of browning-induced lipolysis (P < .0001) indirectly decreased hepatic lipotoxicity (P < .01) which improved liver dysfunction (P < .05). Importantly, the beneficial effects of this anti-IL-6 agent extended to the skin, reflected by the decrease in excessive collagen deposition (P < .001) and genes involved in pathologic fibrosis and scarring (P < .05). Together, our results indicate that post-burn IL-6 blockade leads to significant improvements in systemic hypermetabolism by inhibiting pathological alterations in key immunometabolic organs. These findings support the therapeutic potential of anti-IL-6 interventions to improve care, quality of life, and survival in burned patients."
https://openalex.org/W3156988616,"TBC1D4 is a 160 kDa multidomain Rab GTPase-activating protein (RabGAP) and a downstream target of the insulin- and contraction-activated kinases AKT and AMPK. Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 has been linked to translocation of GLUT4 from storage vesicles (GSVs) to the cell surface. However, its impact on enzymatic activity is not well understood, as previous studies mostly investigated the truncated GAP domain lacking the known phosphorylation sites. In the present study, we expressed and purified recombinant full-length TBC1D4 using a baculovirus system. Size-exclusion chromatography and coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that full-length TBC1D4 forms oligomers of ∼600 kDa. Compared with the truncated GAP domain, full-length TBC1D4 displayed similar substrate specificity, but had a markedly higher specific GAP activity toward Rab10. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we mapped 19 Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites in TBC1D4. We determined Michaelis–Menten kinetics using in vitro phosphorylation assays with purified kinases and stable isotope-labeled γ-[18O4]-ATP. These data revealed that Ser324 (KM ∼6 μM) and Thr649 (KM ∼25 μM) were preferential sites for phosphorylation by AKT, whereas Ser348, Ser577, Ser595 (KM ∼10 μM), Ser711 (KM ∼79 μM), and Ser764 were found to be preferred targets for AMPK. Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 by AKT or AMPK did not alter the intrinsic RabGAP activity, but did disrupt interaction with insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP), a resident protein of GSVs implicated in GLUT4 trafficking. These findings provide evidence that insulin and contraction may regulate TBC1D4 function primarily by disrupting the recruitment of the RabGAP to GLUT4 vesicles.

These findings provide evidence that insulin and contraction may regulate TBC1D4 function primarily by disrupting the recruitment of the RabGAP to GLUT4 vesicles. In skeletal muscle, stimulation by both insulin and contraction triggers an increase in glucose uptake from the blood stream through a rapid and reversible redistribution of GLUT4 from GLUT4 transporter storage vesicles (GSVs) to the cell surface (1Klip A.

Phosphorylation cascades transmitted via AKT or AMPK kinases as well as Rab (Ras-related proteins in brain) GTPases in their active GTP-bound form are thought to be responsible for relieving the intracellular retention of GLUT4 in the basal state (3Sano H.

The Rab GTPase-activating proteins (RabGAPs) TBC1D1 and TBC1D4 (also known as AS160) are downstream targets of AKT and AMPK kinases, and phosphorylation of these two proteins is associated with enhanced translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in response to insulin and contraction (5Peck G.R.

The majority of the known phosphorylation sites are localized within the second PTB domain and the region between the PTB domains and the C-terminal GAP domain. The mechanism of TBC1D1 and TBC1D4 regulation through AKT and AMPK phosphorylation in GLUT4 trafficking has been of particular interest for many years. Previous studies suggested a point of convergence for AKT and AMPK signaling through elevated insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of TBC1D4 after contraction (10Arias E.B. Kim J. Funai K. Cartee G.D.

Due to the fact that all previous studies utilized truncated GAP domain of TBC1D4, the molecular function of the phosphorylation sites remains largely unknown. In this study, we focused on the regulation of recombinant full-length TBC1D4 through AKT-and AMPK-dependent phosphorylation and investigate the temporal and spatial pattern of TBC1D4 phosphorylation in details. After mapping TBC1D4 phosphorylation sites, our results show that AKT and AMPK have different affinity toward their target phosphorylation sites. In addition, phosphorylation of specific sites in TBC1D4 may influence phosphorylation of other sites, which may explain in part the insulin-sensitizing effect of muscle contraction. We used the baculovirus expression system to express full-length recombinant TBC1D4 protein. The cDNA for the long isoform (1298 aa) of the murine Tbc1d4 gene was cloned into the transfer vector pAcSG2-6xHis to create a baculovirus as described previously (7Mafakheri S. Florke R.R. Kanngiesser S. Hartwig S. Espelage L. De Wendt C. Schonberger T. Hamker N. Lehr S. Chadt A. Al-Hasani H. AKT and AMP-activated protein kinase regulate TBC1D1 through phosphorylation and its interaction with the cytosolic tail of insulin-regulated aminopeptidase IRAP.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 17853-17862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The construct for His6-TBC1D4 includes two N-terminal PTB domains, a central CB domain, and a C-terminal GAP domain (Fig. 1A). Baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells were cultured, harvested, and the recombinant protein was purified as described under “Experimental procedures”. The yield of TBC1D4 after IMAC was approximately 1 mg/109 Sf9 cells with a purity of ∼80% as determined by densitometry of Coomassie-stained gels. In SDS-PAGE the purified protein appeared as a single band with an apparent Mr of ∼170 kDa (Fig. 1B). In contrast, using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), the apparent molecular mass of the purified protein corresponded to 608 kDa (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1). To explore possible oligomerization of TBC1D4, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation experiments using lysates from HEK293 cells expressing either full-length HA-tagged TBC1D4, FLAG-tagged TBC1D4 (Fig. 1D, upper panel), or both tagged proteins. As shown in Figure 1D (lower panel), immunoprecipitation of HA-TBC1D4 with HA-antibodies resulted in coprecipitation of both HA-TBC1D4 and FLAG-TBC1D4. To map the interacting domains of TBC1D4, we coexpressed FLAG-tagged full-length TBC1D4 and different HA-tagged domain constructs of TBC1D4 (Fig. 1A) and analyzed protein–protein interactions with immunoprecipitation using HA- and FLAG antibodies. As illustrated in Figure 1E, FLAG-tagged TBC1D4 coprecipitated with the HA-tagged N-terminal PTB domains (C1 and C2; Fig. 1A), the residual CB/GAP domains with the C-terminal tail of TBC1D4 (C3 and C4; Fig. 1A) but not with the protein lacking both PTB domains and the 127 amino-acid-spanning C-terminal tail (C5; Fig. 1A). We further investigated structural features of TBC1D4 complexes by limited proteolysis using low concentration of trypsin and analysis of partial digestion products by mass spectrometry. Interestingly, rapid fragmentation occurred predominantly at tryptic sites close to two phosphorylation sites in TBC1D4, Ser348 and Ser577 (Fig. 1A; Fig. S2). We investigated the catalytic activity of TBC1D4 and performed RabGAP assays as described in “Experimental procedures.” The GTPase Rab10 has been previously identified as major substrate for the truncated GAP domain of TBC1D4 (15Sano H. Eguez L. Teruel M.N. Fukuda M. Chuang T.D. Chavez J.A. Lienhard G.E. McGraw T.E.

Purified GST-Rab10 was loaded with [γ-32P]GTP, incubated with purified full-length TBC1D4 protein, and the rate of [32P]phosphate release resulting from hydrolysis of [γ-32P]GTP was measured as described previously (7Mafakheri S.

Figure 2, A and B illustrate that purified GST-Rab10 exhibited some endogenous GTPase activity, but the initial velocity of GTP hydrolysis was substantially increased in the presence of full-length TBC1D4. Similar results were obtained for Rab8a (data not shown), consistent with previous studies that identified main Rab substrates using recombinant GAP domain expressed and purified from E. coli (4Miinea C.P.

https://openalex.org/W3152834515,"The way people choose routes through unfamiliar environments provides clues about the underlying representation they use. One way to test the nature of observers’ representation is to manipulate the structure of the scene as they move through it and measure which aspects of performance are significantly affected and which are not. We recorded the routes that participants took in virtual mazes to reach previously-viewed targets. The mazes were either physically realizable or impossible (the latter contained ‘wormholes’ that altered the layout of the scene without any visible change at that moment). We found that participants could usually find the shortest route between remembered objects even in physically impossible environments, despite the gross failures in pointing that an earlier study showed are evident in the physically impossible environment. In the physically impossible conditions, the choice made at a junction was influenced to a greater extent by whether that choice had, in the past, led to the discovery of a target (compared to a shortest-distance prediction). In the physically realizable mazes, on the other hand, junction choices were determined more by the shortest distance to the target. This pattern of results is compatible with the idea of a graph-like representation of space that can include information about previous success or failure for traversing each edge and also information about the distance between nodes. Our results suggest that complexity of the maze may dictate which of these is more important in influencing navigational choices."
https://openalex.org/W3155633619,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a lethal malignancy with limited treatment options. Sorafenib is the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved first-line targeted drug for the treatment of advanced HCC. However, its effect on patient survival is limited. Recently, studies have demonstrated that the imbalance between apoptosis and autophagy plays a critical role in chemoresistance, and it is hypothesised that restoring the balance between these processes is a potential treatment strategy for improving chemoresistance in cancer. However, there is currently no evidence supporting this hypothesis. We aimed to investigate if vaccinia-related kinase 2 (VRK2), a serine/threonine protein kinase, confers sorafenib resistance in HCC cells. Here, we found that VRK2 was enriched in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells and patient-derived xenografts. Both in vivo and in vitro evidences showed that VRK2 blunts the efficacy of sorafenib against hepatocellular carcinoma by disturbing the balance between apoptosis and autophagy. Mechanistically, VRK2 promotes the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 by activating JNK1/MAPK8, thereby enhancing the dissociation of Bcl-2 from Beclin-1 and promoting the formation of the Beclin-1-Atg14-Vps34 complex, which facilitates autophagy. Furthermore, VRK2-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 promotes the interaction of Bcl-2 with BAX, thereby inhibiting apoptosis. In conclusion, targeting VRK2 for modulation of the balance between autophagy and apoptosis may be a novel strategy for overcoming sorafenib resistance in HCC."

EETs could be readily converted to less biological active diols by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). However, whether sEH inhibition can ameliorate the comorbidities of insulin resistance and hypertension and the underlying mechanisms of this relationship are unclear. In this study, C57BL/6 mice were rendered hypertensive and insulin resistant through a high-fat and high-salt (HF–HS) diet. The sEH inhibitor, 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl) urea (TPPU), was used to treat mice (1 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks, followed by analysis of metabolic parameters. The expression of sEH and the sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) was markedly upregulated in the kidneys of mice fed an HF–HS diet. We found that TPPU administration increased kidney EET levels, improved insulin resistance, and reduced hypertension. Furthermore, TPPU treatment prevented upregulation of SGLT2 and the associated increased urine volume and the excretion of urine glucose and urine sodium. Importantly, TPPU alleviated renal inflammation. In vitro, human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (HK-2 cells) were used to further investigate the underlying mechanism. We observed that 14,15-EET or sEH knockdown or inhibition prevented the upregulation of SGLT2 upon treatment with palmitic acid or NaCl by inhibiting the inhibitory kappa B kinase α/β/NF-κB signaling pathway. In conclusion, sEH inhibition by TPPU alleviated insulin resistance and hypertension induced by an HF–HS diet in mice.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) manifests as a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance. Among diabetic patients, almost 50% to 70% also suffer from hypertension, and its development coincides with the development of hyperglycemia (1Lastra G. Syed S. Kurukulasuriya L.R. Manrique C.

What is more, the prevalence of hypertension in diabetic patients is 2 to 3 times higher than that in the general population (4DeFronzo R.A. Ferrannini E. Groop L. Henry R.R. Herman W.H. Holst J.J.

Besides, hypertension is a critical factor in increasing the incidence and mortality of cardiovascular events in the course of diabetes (5Kabakov E. Norymberg C. Osher E. Koffler M. Tordjman K.

Specifically, compared with normotensive individuals with diabetes, coexisting hypertension increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality by 25% and 30% (6Chen G.

In addition, for every 10 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure on average in diabetic individuals, the risk of any DM-related end point is reduced by 12%, and the risk of DM-related death is reduced by 15% (9Adler A.I. Stratton I.M. Neil H.A.W. Yudkin J.S. Matthews D.R. Cull C.A. Wright A.D. Turner R.C. Holman R.R.

Therefore, it is of great significance to reduce diabetes and hypertension incidence and control blood pressure and blood glucose with reasonable drugs. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) encoded by EPHX2 is ubiquitously expressed in all living organisms and exists in almost all organs and tissues; it was found that the human liver possesses the highest sEH activity, followed by the kidney (10El-Sherbeni A.A.

Physiol. 2010; 298: H679-H687Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). sEH functions to enzymatically hydrolyze epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and other fatty acid epoxides (12Zhang D. Xie X. Chen Y. Hammock B.D. Kong W. Zhu Y. Homocysteine upregulates soluble epoxide hydrolase in vascular endothelium in vitro and in vivo.Circ. Res. 2012; 110: 808-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). EETs are metabolites of arachidonic acid produced by the cytochrome P450 pathway (13Yang H.-H. Duan J.-X. Liu S.-K. Xiong J.-B.

There are four regioisomers: 5,6-EET, 8,9-EET, 11,12-EET, and 14,15-EET, among them renal 14,15-EET metabolites account for up to 56.4% (14Laethem R.M. Balazy M. Falck J.R. Laethem C.L. Koop D.R. Formation of 19(S)-, 19(R)-, and 18(R)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids by alcohol-inducible cytochrome P450 2E1.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12912-12918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is reported that the sEH inhibition, an effective strategy to elevate the levels of EETs, has a therapeutic effect on multiple diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, inflammation, stroke, dyslipidemia, immunological disorders, and so on (15Shen H.C. Soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors: A patent review.Expert Opin. Ther. Patents. 2010; 20: 941-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the effects of EETs/sEH system on diabetes accompanied by hypertension remain unknown. 1-Trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl) urea (TPPU) is a potent inhibitor of both human and mouse sEH and selectively inhibits the hydrolase domain, thus increasing the EET levels. The pharmacokinetics of TPPU is dramatically superior to those of the 1-adamantylurea–based inhibitors, like 12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido) dodecanoic acid. In this study, TPPU was used to investigate whether sEH inhibition ameliorates insulin resistance with hypertension and the potential mechanisms. Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), encoded by the SLC5A family, is expressed almost exclusively in the initial convoluted portion (S1 segment) of the proximal tubule epitheliums (16Wright E.M. Turk E. The sodium/glucose cotransport family SLC5.Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 510-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Zelniker T.A. Braunwald E. Cardiac and renal effects of sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors in diabetes: JACC state-of-the-art review.J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2018; 72: 1845-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). SGLT2 is responsible for 97% of the body's daily glucose reabsorption, whereas SGLT1 expressed in the later parts of the proximal tubule only accounts for the remaining 3% glucose reabsorption (18Hummel C.S. Lu C. Loo D.D.F. Hirayama B.A. Voss A.A. Wright E.M. Glucose transport by human renal Na+/d-glucose cotransporters SGLT1 and SGLT2.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2010; 300: C14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Compared with healthy individuals, there is significantly higher expression of SGLT2 in the proximal tubule in diabetics. Thus, glucose reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate is dramatically increased, leading to higher blood glucose levels (19Rahmoune H. Thompson P.W. Ward J.M. Smith C.D. Hong G. Brown J. Glucose transporters in human renal proximal tubular cells isolated from the urine of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes.Diabetes. 2005; 54: 3427-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Recently, SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and canagliflozin, have been developed and widely approved in antihyperglycemic therapies. In addition to lowering blood glucose, inhibiting SGLT2 can lower blood pressure and reduce body weight (20Heerspink H.J.L. Perkins B.A. Fitchett D.H. Husain M. Cherney D.Z.I. Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the treatment of diabetes mellitus: Cardiovascular and kidney effects, potential mechanisms, and clinical applications.Circulation. 2016; 134: 752-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). In the present study, we aim to explore whether sEH inhibitor TPPU could reduce blood pressure and glucose in mice with hypertension and diabetes. Interestingly, TPPU administration ameliorated hypertension and insulin resistance by decreasing renal glucose and sodium reabsorption via inhibitory kappa B kinase α/β (IKKα/β)/NF-κB signaling pathway–mediated SGLT2 inhibition. At the beginning of the study, animals were fed with either a standard chow (SC)/normal salt (NS) (n = 24) diet or a high fat and high salt (HF–HS) diet, starting with similar body weight (SC–NS = 22.06 ± 1.12 g versus HF–HS = 22.47 ± 1.07 g). After the 12-week dietary intervention, the final body weight of mice fed with an HF–HS diet was significantly higher than that of mice fed with an SC–NS diet (SC–NS = 29.84 ± 1.79 g versus HF–HS = 33.88 ± 1.28 g) (Fig. 1, A and B). Besides, these two groups showed different feeding behaviors. Specifically, the mice in HF–HS group took less food daily by 28% than that in SC–NS group, but with a higher energy intake (more than 13%) (Fig. 1, C and D), these alterations in weight gains could be attributed to the energy intake differences between the two dietary regime mice. Similarly, compared with the mice in SC–NS group, the mice in HF–HS group displayed enlarged fat depots and increased epididymal adipose tissue mass (Fig. 1, A and F). However, there was almost no difference in subscapular adipose tissue between the two groups (Fig. 1E), indicating that HF–HS diet does not affect the brown fat deposition but has obvious effects on white adipose deposition with a significantly larger adipocyte size in H&E staining (Fig. 1, A and G). Blood pressure and heart rate were evaluated at the end of the experiment. Over time, as showed in Figure 1I, there was a significant increase in systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure (about 30%, 23%, and 19% higher versus SC–NS group). However, the dietary intervention has almost no influence on heart rate (Fig. 1J). Increased fasting blood glucose and random glucose levels were observed in HF–HS mice (Fig. 1H). Consistent with this, markedly decreased insulin sensitivity was observed in HF–HS mice compared with that in SC–NS group (Fig. 1K), and the area under the curve (AUC) of insulin tolerance in HF–HS group was about twice of that in SC–NS group (Fig. 1L). Moreover, glucose tolerance of mice in HF–HS group was suppressed significantly, resulting in an increased AUC (1749.83 ± 96.12 versus 2860.00 ± 89.50) (Fig. 1, M and N). Taken together, these data indicated that an HF–HS diet resulted in increased blood pressure and insulin resistance. The expression of sEH and SGLT2 was evaluated by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and Western blot (WB). The expression of sEH and SGLT2 was significantly increased in the kidney (Fig. 2, A–D). These data indicated that sEH and SGLT2 might play an important role in this animal model with insulin resistance and hypertension. Our previous study demonstrated that sEH inhibitor (TPPU) inhibited SGLT2 expression to regulate glucose homeostasis in db/db mice (21Fu M. Yu J. Chen Z. Tang Y. Dong R. Yang Y. Luo J. Hu S. Tu L. Xu X. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids improve glucose homeostasis by preventing NF-κB-mediated transcription of SGLT2 in renal tubular epithelial cells.Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2021; 523: 111149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). SGLT2 inhibitors as the first-line glucose-lowering medication exerted extensive cardiovascular beneficial effects. Dapagliflozin is a potent, competitive, reversible, and highly selective SGLT2 inhibitor. Compared with other SGLT2 inhibitors, dapagliflozin has higher affinity and stronger inhibitory effect on SGLT2 protein. In this study, dapagliflozin was used as a positive control. As observed, both TPPU and dapagliflozin decreased systolic blood pressure, and moreover, TPPU also decreased diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial blood pressure (Fig. 3, B–D). As expected, TPPU treatment significantly decreased the level of fasting blood glucose as shown in Figure 3A. Moreover, TPPU administration markedly improved insulin resistance determined by glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test (ITT) (Fig. 3, E–H). Among these groups, dapagliflozin displayed a similar effect to TPPU in maintaining glucose homeostasis. Taken together, sEH inhibitor TPPU could exert similar effects as dapagliflozin in regulating blood pressure and blood glucose, which indicated that sEH could be a potential therapeutic target for hypertension and diabetes. Comprehensive laboratory animal monitoring system studies was used to measure metabolic activities. There were no significant changes in the volume of oxygen consumption (VO2) and volume of carbon dioxide production (VCO2) between mice treated with an SC or an HF–HS diet, but the HF–HS diet decreased the value of respiratory exchange ratio (RER), revealed that the HF–HS diet caused a notable shift from glucose toward lipid utilization. Interestingly, administration of TPPU or dapagliflozin in an HF–HS diet–treated mice markedly increased the level of RER, which likely reflected the shift from fatty acid oxidation to carbohydrate consumption (Fig. 3, I–N). To further explore the mechanisms of TPPU administration involving the regulation of blood pressure and insulin resistance, the urine volume, urine glucose, and sodium excretion among different diet and administration groups were determined. Interestingly, urine volume, urine glucose excretion, and urine sodium excretion were markedly increased in mice treated with an HF–HS diet as shown in Figure 4, A–C. Importantly, TPPU treatment further increased urine volume and the excretion of glucose and sodium (Fig. 4, A–C). The inhibition of SGLT2 activity by dapagliflozin showed the similar effects to TPPU (Fig. 4, A–C). From the IHC staining and WB results, SGLT2 expression in the kidney was significantly upregulated in mice treated with an HF–HS diet as shown in Figure 4, D–F. Interestingly, TPPU administration markedly prevented the upregulation in SGLT2 expression induced by an HF–HS diet treatment (Fig. 4, D–F). Moreover, the sEH activity in kidney was increased, and the level of 14,15-EET in the kidney was lower in mice treated with an HF–HS diet than that in mice treated with an SC–NS diet, and moreover TPPU treatment markedly inhibited the sEH activity and thus increased the level of 14,15-EET in mice treated with an HF–HS diet, compared with that in mice without TPPU treatment as shown in Figure 4, G and H. Collectively, these data demonstrated that TPPU administration lowered hypertension and improved insulin resistance by inhibiting sodium and glucose reabsorption mediated by 14,15-EET–triggered reduced SGLT2 expression. H&E staining was conducted to assess the morphological characters in the kidney. As expected, regular arrangement of renal tubular cells and glomeruli was observed in mice of the SC–NS group and SC–NS+TPPU group, and the improper arrangement of tubular cells with endocytic vacuoles was more common in the kidney of mice treated with an HF–HS diet as shown in Figure 5A. Importantly, TPPU treatment markedly reduced the vacuolation of the renal tubules (Fig. 5A). Our previous data indicated that inflammatory response modulated the expression of SGLT2 in the kidney; so to explore whether inflammatory response was involved in this process, inflammation-related markers were determined in this study. The level of CD68, a macrophage biomarker, was higher in the HF–HS group than that in the SC–NS group or SC–NS + TPPU group as shown in Figure 5, A, B, F, and G. Interestingly, administration of TPPU significantly inhibited the expression of CD68 induced by an HF–HS diet (Fig. 5, A, B, F, and G), which indicated that TPPU treatment markedly prevented macrophage infiltration in the kidney induced by an HF–HS diet. Furthermore, TPPU treatment markedly prevented the upregulation in interleukin-1β (IL-1β), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, tumor necrosis factor α, and NF-κB expression in the kidney induced by an HF–HS diet (Fig. 5, A, F, C–E, and H–J). To further explore the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of TPPU, the IKKα/β/NF-κB signaling pathway was detected in this study. As expected, the level of phosphor-IKKα/β and phosphor-IκBα was increased, and moreover, NF-κB nuclear translocation was also increased in the kidney of mice treated with an HF–HS diet as shown in Figure 5, A, F, and J, which indicated that inflammatory response was activated by an HF–HS diet treatment. Importantly, TPPU treatment vastly decreased the level of phosphor-IKKα/β, phosphor-IκBα, and NF-κB nuclear translocation (Fig. 5, A, F, and J). Taken together, these data indicated that TPPU treatment markedly inhibited kidney inflammatory response induced by an HF–HS diet treatment. Because SGLT2 is highly expressed in the renal tubular epithelium, human proximal tubule epithelial cells (HK-2 cells) were used to explore the regulatory mechanisms of SGLT2 expression. Dose-dependent effects of palmitic acid on SGLT2 expression were done in HK-2 cells. Interestingly, NaCl (20 nM) and palmitic acid (100 μM) markedly increased SGLT2 and sEH expression in HK-2 cells (Fig. 6, A and B), and NaCl (20 nM) and palmitic acid (100 μM) were used for further analysis. Next, the effects of TPPU or EETs on SGLT2 expression in HK-2 cells treated with NaCl and palmitic acid were investigated. As expected, TPPU or EETs (11,12-EET and 14,15-EET) significantly prevented the upregulation in SGLT2 expression in HK-2 cells treated with NaCl and palmitic acid as shown in Figure 6C. Knocking down of EPHX2 also prevented the upregulation of SGLT2 in HK-2 cells treated with NaCl and palmitic acid as shown in Figure 6D. Inflammation is a key driving factor in metabolic disorder and hypertension, and the classical IKKα/β/NF-κB signaling pathway plays a vital role in the inflammation. As expected, phosphor-IKKα/β and phosphor-IκB expression were increased in HK-2 cells treated with palmitic acid and NaCl. Moreover, 14,15-EET pretreatment dose dependently prevented the increase in phosphor-IKKα/β and phosphor-IκB expression induced by palmitic acid and NaCl treatment as shown in Figure 6E. Importantly, 14,15-EET dose dependently prevented the increase in nuclear NF-κB expression in HK-2 cells treated with palmitic acid and NaCl (Fig. 6E). Immunofluorescent localization of NF-κB further confirmed the effects of 14,15-EET on NF-κB translocation to the nucleus in both in vivo and in vitro studies (Fig. 6, F and G). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) (2 μg/ml), as a solvent control for palmitic acid, and mannitol, as an osmotic control for NaCl, did not activate the IKKα/β/NF-κB signaling pathway (Fig. 6, E and G). Interestingly, NF-κB inhibition by BAY 11-7082 or administration of 14,15-EET significantly prevented the increase in SGLT2 expression in HK-2 cells treated with palmitic acid and NaCl (Fig. 6, H and I). Collectively, these data revealed that 14,15-EET prevented the upregulation in SGLT2 expression in HK-2 cells treated with palmitic acid and NaCl via inhibiting IKKα/β/NF-κB signaling pathway. In the present study, we investigated whether TPPU treatment had a potential protective effect on insulin resistance and hypertension in mice treated with an HF–HS diet. As expected, the HF–HS diet caused obvious insulin resistance and hypertension characterized by increased body weight, blood glucose, blood pressure, and impaired glucose tolerance in C57BL/6 mice. Interestingly, sEH and SGLT2 expression in the kidney was markedly increased in mice treated with the HF–HS diet. These data suggested that sEH and SGLT2 may be involved in this pathophysiological process. Importantly, TPPU treatment significantly improved insulin resistance and reduced hypertension with increased kidney 14,15-EET level. Moreover, TPPU administration markedly prevented the upregulation in SGLT2 expression accompanied by increased urine volume, urine glucose excretion, and urine sodium excretion, which partly accounted for the glucose-lowering and blood pressure–lowering effects of TPPU treatment. In addition, TPPU treatment markedly inhibited SGLT2 expression mediated by attenuated inflammatory response characterized by reduced macrophage infiltration and proinflammatory factor production, which was due to inactivation of IKKα/β/NF-κB signaling pathway. Taken together, these data demonstrated that sEH inhibition alleviated insulin resistance and hypertension induced by an HF–HS diet in mice via increased urine glucose and sodium excretion mediated by decreased renal SGLT2 expression, which was due to inactivation of IKKα/β/NF-κB–induced inflammatory response. Our previous studies showed that CYP2J3 gene delivery increased EET generation and prevented fructose-induced hypertension and insulin resistance in rats (22Xu X. Zhao C.X. Wang L. Tu L. Fang X.

Moreover, endothelium-specific CYP2J2 overexpression in mice significantly increased 14,15-EET level, thus ameliorated age-related insulin resistance and elevated blood pressure (23Yang Y. Dong R.

In this study, administration of TPPU also increased EET level and thus improved insulin resistance and lowered hypertension in HF–HS diet–treated mice, which was a supplement for the beneficial effects of sEH/EET system on metabolic disorders. CYP450/EETs/sEH system has been extensively studied for its role in cardiovascular and metabolic protective effects. Cytochrome P450 epoxygenase inhibitors significantly increased mean arterial blood pressure in rats fed on an HS diet (24Makita K. Takahashi K. Karara A. Jacobson H.R. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H.

The sEH inhibitor, 12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-dodecanoic acid, lowered blood pressure and ameliorated renal damage in mice fed on an 8% NaCl diet for 14 days (26Imig J.D. Zhao X. Zaharis C.Z.

Moreover, inhibition of sEH reduced blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats (27Jiang H. Anderson G.D. McGiff J.C.

The sEH inhibitor, trans-4-[4-(3-adamantan-1-ylureido)-cyclohexyloxy]-benzoic acid, decreased blood glucose level in mice treated with HF diet + streptozotocin/nicotinamide (29Zuloaga K.L.

In this study, an HF–HS diet was used to induce hypertension and insulin resistance, which was very similar to the unhealthy lifestyle in human beings. TPPU treatment improved insulin resistance and lowered hypertension in HF–HS diet–treated mice, which further confirmed the hypothesis that sEH deletion or inhibition had beneficial effects on the regulation of blood pressure and blood glucose in different animal models. As a diabetic therapeutic target, SGLT2 inhibitor has been developed rapidly and attracted considerable attention for its powerful sugar-lowering effects with significant cardiovascular benefit.

https://openalex.org/W3156290047,"Synaptic plasticity damages play a crucial role in the onset and development of depression, especially in the hippocampus, which is more susceptible to stress and the most frequently studied brain region in depression. And, mitochondria have a major function in executing the complex processes of neurotransmission and plasticity. We have previously demonstrated that Iptakalim (Ipt), a new ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channel opener, could improve the depressive-like behavior in mice. But the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. The present study demonstrated that Ipt reversed depressive-like phenotype in vivo (chronic mild stress-induced mice model of depression) and in vitro (corticosterone-induced cellular model). Further study showed that Ipt could upregulate the synaptic-related proteins postsynaptic density 95 (PSD 95) and synaptophysin (SYN), and alleviated the synaptic structure damage. Moreover, Ipt could reverse the abnormal mitochondrial fission and fusion, as well as the reduced mitochondrial ATP production and collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential in depressive models. Knocking down the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium (Mito-KATP) channel subunit MitoK partly blocked the above effects of Ipt. Therefore, our results reveal that Ipt can alleviate the abnormal mitochondrial dynamics and function depending on MitoK, contributing to improve synaptic plasticity and exert antidepressive effects. These findings provide a candidate compound and a novel target for antidepressive therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3153321041,"Human cell division is a highly regulated process that relies on the accurate capture and movement of chromosomes to the metaphase plate. Errors in the fidelity of chromosome congression and alignment can lead to improper chromosome segregation, which is correlated with aneuploidy and tumorigenesis. These processes are known to be regulated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) in other species, but the role of ERK2 in mitosis in mammals remains unclear. Here, we have identified the dual-specificity phosphatase 7 (DUSP7), known to display selectivity for ERK2, as important in regulating chromosome alignment. During mitosis, DUSP7 bound to ERK2 and regulated the abundance of active phospho-ERK2 through its phosphatase activity. Overexpression of DUSP7, but not catalytically inactive mutants, led to a decrease in the levels of phospho-ERK2 and mitotic chromosome misalignment, while knockdown of DUSP7 also led to defective chromosome congression that resulted in a prolonged mitosis. Consistently, knockdown or chemical inhibition of ERK2 or chemical inhibition of the MEK kinase that phosphorylates ERK2 led to chromosome alignment defects.

Critical to the fidelity of cell division is the accurate movement and alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate and their segregation during anaphase. Errors in these processes are linked to human developmental disorders and tumorigenesis (1Gordon D.J. Resio B. Pellman D. Causes and consequences of aneuploidy in cancer.Nat. Rev.

However, whether human ERK2 is active in mitosis and what roles it plays in human somatic cell division remains ambiguous. Our RNAi screen for novel factors important for cell division identified the dual-specificity phosphatase 7 (DUSP7/MKP-X). DUSP7, DUSP6/MKP-3, and DUSP9/MKP-4 are members of the cytoplasmic ERK specific mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases (MKPs) subfamily that share similar amino acid sequences, subcellular localizations, and substrate preferences (15Seternes O.M.

DUSP7 contains an N terminal noncatalytic Rhodanese-like domain and a C-terminal dual-phosphatase domain. A conserved Kinase Interaction Motif (KIM) in the noncatalytic domain is essential for the interaction between MKPs and ERK (19Owens D.M. Keyse S.M.

Two key amino acid residues within the conserved catalytic sequence (H/V)C(X5)R(S/T) of the phosphatase domain, C331 and R337, are important for DUSP7’s phosphatase activity (25Denu J.M. Dixon J.E.

However, in contrast to MKPs such as DUSP6 and DUSP9, little is known about the physiological functions of DUSP7. Here, we have determined that MEK phosphorylation activity and DUSP7 phosphatase activity regulate the levels of active phospho-ERK2, which is important for the fidelity of chromosome alignment and segregation during cell division. To understand the role of DUSP7 during cell division, we began by defining the protein–protein interaction and protein proximity networks of DUSP7 in mitotic cells. Localization and affinity purification (LAP = GFP-Tev-S-tag)-tagged and biotin identification 2 (BioID2)-tagged DUSP7 inducible HeLa stable cell lines were used to express LAP/BioID2-DUSP7 and biochemical purifications were analyzed by mass spectrometry. In-house R scripts were used to analyze the mass spectrometry data and protein interaction and proximity networks were visualized with RCytoscape JS (Fig. S1, A and B). Further, we applied Gene Ontology (GO) terms (mitotic spindle; kinetochore and chromosome segregation) (Fig. S1C) and CORUM complex annotation analyses to these networks (see Experimental procedures for details). These analyses determined that ERK2 (aka MAPK1) was also associating with DUSP7 in mitosis (Fig. 1, A and B). Next, we validated the DUSP7-ERK2 mitotic interaction by immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments using mitotic cell extracts from Taxol- or nocodazole-arrested LAP-DUSP7 stable cell lines (Fig. 1C). The KIM domain was shown to be essential for the interaction of some DUSPs (DUSP1, 4, 6) with ERK2 (24Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. A conserved docking motif in MAP kinases common to substrates, activators and regulators.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 27Chen P. Hutter D. Yang X.

To better understand the DUSP7-ERK2 interaction, we generated DUSP7 KIM mutants R102A, R103A, and R102,103A double mutants (Fig. 1D and Fig. S2, A–C). IP experiments from mitotic cells transiently transfected with DUSP7 or DUSP7 KIM mutants showed that ERK2 IPed with DUSP7 but not DUSP7 KIM mutants (Fig. 1E). To further define the interaction domains of DUSP7 involved in ERK2 binding, we generated a series of LAP-DUSP7 stable cell lines expressing DUSP7 truncations (Fig. S3A). ERK2 failed to associate with DUSP7 truncations (Fig. S3B), likely due to DUSP7 destabilization. Next, we sought to determine the significance of the DUSP7-ERK2 interaction. Consistent with the abolished interaction between DUSP7 KIM mutants and ERK2 (Fig. 1E), DUSP7-R103A and DUSP7-R102,103A double mutants showed a slightly reduced ability to dephosphorylate ERK2 in mitotic HeLa cells (Fig. 1F and Fig. S3, C–E). However, DUSP7-R102A could still dephosphorylate ERK2 (Fig. 1F); this phenomenon was also observed for conserved KIM mutations in DUSP6 (29Nichols A. Camps M. Gillieron C. Chabert C. Brunet A. Wilsbacher J. Cobb M. Pouyssegur J. Shaw J.P. Arkinstall S. Substrate recognition domains within extracellular signal-regulated kinase mediate binding and catalytic activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-3.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24613-24621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Similarly, IP experiments using in vitro expressed proteins or mitotic cell extracts from DUSP7 or DUSP7 catalytic dead mutant (C331A and R337A) (Fig. S2, D–G) cell lines showed that ERK2 IPed with DUSP7 and DUSP7-R337A but not DUSP7-C331A (Fig. 1, G and H, Fig. S3, F–H). While overexpression of DUSP7 led to the absence of phospho-ERK2, overexpressed DUSP7-R337A or DUSP7-C331A showed a reduced ability to dephosphorylate ERK2 in mitotic HeLa cells (Fig. 1I). Together, these results showed that DUSP7 was binding to ERK2 during mitosis and that the DUSP7 KIM was required for this interaction, while the DUSP7 catalytic sites (C331 and R337) within its phosphatase domain were important for regulating the levels of active phospho-ERK2. To understand the importance of DUSP7’s function in regulating the levels of active phospho-ERK2 during cell division, we first identified siRNAs capable of depleting DUSP7 levels by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2A and Fig. S4A) and DUSP7 mRNA expression by RT-qPCR (Fig. S4, B and C). Knockdown of DUSP7 led to a failure to dephosphorylate ERK2 and an increase in phospho-ERK2 levels (Fig. 2A). We then analyzed the consequences of depleting DUSP7 during metaphase (Fig. 2B) and postmetaphase (Fig. 2E) with immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy. DUSP7 depletion led to an increased percentage of defective mitotic cells with chromosome misalignment (siDUSP7 = 44.6 ± 5.6, p < 0.05 compared with siControl = 29.1 ± 2.9) (Fig. 2, C and D). These defective cells also showed defects in spindle organization including unfocused and multipolar spindles (Fig. 2C). The chromosome misalignments defects in siDUSP7 cells translated into an increase in the percentage of lagging chromosomes during anaphase (siDUSP7 = 24.9 ± 3.7, p < 0.05 compared with siControl = 13.45 ± 3.1) (Fig. 2, F and G). The mitotic defects were rescued by an siRNA resistant DUSP7 (Fig. S2H) expressed at near endogenous levels but not DUSP7 catalytic dead mutants (Fig. S4, D–F). Similar results were observed and statistically analyzed in U2OS cells (Fig. S4, G–I) and HCT116 cells (Fig. S4, J–L). Next, we analyzed whether DUSP7 depletion could affect the timing of cell division by live-cell time-lapse microscopy in HCT116 GFP-H2B cells (Fig. 2H). This analysis showed that depletion of DUSP7 led to a marked increase in the time from chromosome condensation to chromosome segregation (siDUSP7 = 54.0 ± 38.3 min, p < 0.01 compared with siControl = 38.0 ± 19.1 min) (Fig. 2, I–K; Movies S1–S4). Together, these results showed that depletion of DUSP7 led to a slowed mitosis where cells failed to properly align and segregate chromosomes. Next, we sought to determine if ERK2 was important for human cell division. First, we depleted endogenous ERK2 by RNAi (Fig. 3A) and analyzed the consequences during cell division (Fig. 3B) with IF microscopy. Depletion of ERK2 led to an increased number of cells with defects in chromosome alignment during metaphase (siERK2 = 52.1 ± 2.8, p < 0.01 compared with siControl = 30.6 ± 3.5) (Fig. 3, C and D), which was consistent in U2OS cells (Fig. S5, A and B) and HCT116 cells (Fig. S5, C and D). ERK2 depletion also led to an increase in interphase cells that were multinucleated or contained micronuclei (siERK2 = 22.6 ± 6.2, p < 0.01 compared with siControl = 3.8 ± 0.8) (Fig. S5, E and F). Since phospho-ERK2 levels were lower in mitosis than in G1/S phase (Fig. S5, G–J), we asked if ERK2 phosphorylation or ERK2 kinase activity was important for cell division. HeLa cells were treated with a MEK inhibitor U0126 (30Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A.

Commun. 2005; 336: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and analyzed by western blotting and IF microscopy (Fig. 3E). Phospho-ERK2 levels decreased in U0126-treated cells, but were not affected in FR180204-treated cells (Fig. 3F). In comparison to the control DMSO treatment, cells treated with U0126 or FR180204 showed an increase in chromosome alignment errors (U0126 = 48.7 ± 12.7, p < 0.05 and FR180204 = 45.6 ± 6.5, p < 0.05 compared with DMSO = 25.8 ± 3.9) (Fig. 3, G and H), which was consistent in U2OS cells (Fig. S5, K and L) and HCT116 cells (Fig. S5, M and N). These results showed that inhibiting ERK2 phosphorylation, and thereby its activation, or ERK2’s kinase activity led to chromosome alignment defects. Since DUSP7 dephosphorylated ERK2 (Fig. 1E), we hypothesized that overexpression of DUSP7 would lead to similar chromosome alignment defects to those observed in cells treated with the MEK inhibitor U0126. To test this, we overexpressed GFP-tagged DUSP7 (validated to decrease phospho-ERK2 levels, Fig. 1, F and I) or the catalytic dead DUSP7-C331A or DUSP7-R337A mutants (showed minimal effects on phospho-ERK2 levels, Fig. 1I) and analyzed the cells by IF microscopy (Fig. 4A). While DUSP7 overexpression led to a significant increase in chromosome alignment defects, overexpression of DUSP7-R337A or DUSP7-C331A did not (DUSP7 = 42.1 ± 6.9, p < 0.05; DUSP7-C331A = 30.6 ± 3.5, p = 0.3183; and DUSP7-R337A = 34.4 ± 5.7, p = 0.1386; compared to the GFP control = 27.3 ± 3.5) (Fig. 4, B and C), which was consistent in U2OS cells (Fig. S6A) and HCT116 cells (Fig. S6B). These results showed that an overabundance of DUSP7 phosphatase activity led to chromosome alignment defects. To further understand the phospho-ERK2 equilibrium regulated by MEK and DUSP7 during cell division, we asked if the ERK2-DUSP7 interaction was dependent on ERK2 phosphorylation. IP experiments using cell extracts from a U0126-treated LAP-DUSP7 stable cell line showed that ERK2 bound to DUSP7 in the absence of MEK kinase activity (Fig. S6C). Since ERK2 is phosphorylated by MEK at T185 and Y187 (33Haystead T.A. Dent P. Wu J. Haystead C.M. Sturgill T.W. Ordered phosphorylation of p42mapk by MAP kinase kinase.FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 34Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H.

Identification of the regulatory phosphorylation sites in pp42/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase).EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar), we generated the nonphosphorylation mimetic mutant ERK2-2A (T185,Y187A) (Fig. S2, I and J) and analyzed its binding to DUSP7. In vitro binding experiments showed that both ERK2 and ERK2-2A bound to DUSP7 (Fig. S6D). Similar results were observed in IP experiments from HeLa cell extracts (Fig. S6E). Together, these results showed that DUSP7’s binding to ERK2 did not require ERK2 to be phosphorylated. Instead, D318 within the ERK2 common docking (CD) domain (24Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. A conserved docking motif in MAP kinases common to substrates, activators and regulators.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) was responsible for its binding to DUSP7 (Fig. S6F). Next, we examined if phosphorylation of ERK2 at T185 and Y187 was critical for cell division by analyzing cells overexpressing GFP-tagged ERK2 or the nonphosphorylation mimetic mutant ERK2-2A (Fig. 4A). Compared with the overexpression of ERK2, overexpression of ERK2-2A led to a significant increase in cells with chromosome alignment defects in metaphase (ERK2 = 28.7 ± 4.4, p = 0.1438; ERK2-2A = 49.7 ± 3.0, p < 0.01; compared with GFP control = 20.6 ± 6.4) (Fig. 4, D and E), which was consistent in U2OS cells (Fig. S6A) and HCT116 cells (Fig. S6B). These data indicated that the proper amount of phospho-ERK2 in cells was critical for chromosome alignment and segregation during mitosis. This study revealed a novel function for DUSP7 in mitotic chromosome alignment and established the MAPK/ERK pathway as being important for cell division. Our data are consistent with a model where, during a normal mitosis, MEK’s kinase activity phosphorylates ERK2 and DUSP7’s phosphatase activity dephosphorylates ERK2 to establish an equilibrium of active phospho-ERK2 (Fig. 4F middle panel). This phospho-ERK2 equilibrium is critical for ensuring the fidelity of chromosome alignment and segregation. Perturbing the balance of active phospho-ERK2 through MEK inhibition (Fig. 4F right panel), DUSP7 depletion (Fig. 4F left panel) or overexpression (Fig. 4F right panel) leads to defects in chromosome alignment. Together, these results establish DUSP7 as an important mitotic phosphatase that regulates the abundance of active phospho-ERK2 to ensure the fidelity of chromosome alignment and segregation. Interestingly, although the DUSP7 KIM mutant R102A did not bind EKR2, it could still dephosphorylate it (Fig. 1F, Fig. S3, C–E). This is consistent with previous DUSP6 observations, where the DUSP6 KIM mutant R64A did not bind ERK2 but was able to dephosphorylate it (29Nichols A. Camps M. Gillieron C. Chabert C. Brunet A. Wilsbacher J. Cobb M. Pouyssegur J. Shaw J.P. Arkinstall S.

Therefore, it is possible that these mutants are capable of transiently interacting with ERK2, but that the interaction is undetectable in IP experiments. With the exception of ERK2, there is little known about the repertoire of DUSP7 substrates, regulators, and interactors. The GO enrichment analyses of the DUSP7 protein association network and DUSP7 proximity protein network indicate that DUSP7 is likely to associate with numerous proteins that carry out important functions related to a broad array of cellular processes including apoptosis, regulation of transcription, and cell division (Table S1). Therefore, future studies aimed at understanding the importance of these interactions will further aid our understanding of DUSP7’s function in cell division and beyond.

Design A retrospective cohort study of 463,630 births in 19 NHS Trusts in England using routinely collected electronic data supplemented with case note audit (n = 1,658), and surveys of service users (n = 2,085) and health care professionals (n = 1,064). The primary outcome was stillbirth rate. Outcome rates two years before and after the nominal SBL implementation date were derived as a measure of change over the implementation period. Data were collected on secondary outcomes and process outcomes which reflected implementation of the SBL care bundle. Results The total stillbirth rate, declined from 4.2 to 3.4 per 1,000 births between the two time points (adjusted Relative Risk (aRR) 0.80, 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI) 0.70 to 0.91, P&lt;0.001). There was a contemporaneous increase in induction of labour (aRR 1.20 (95%CI 1.18–1.21), p&lt;0.001) and emergency Caesarean section (aRR 1.10 (95%CI 1.07–1.12), p&lt;0.001). The number of ultrasound scans performed (aRR 1.25 (95%CI 1.21–1.28), p&lt;0.001) and the proportion of small for gestational age infants detected (aRR 1.59 (95%CI 1.32–1.92), p&lt;0.001) also increased. Organisations reporting higher levels of implementation had improvements in process measures in all elements of the care bundle. An economic analysis estimated the cost of implementing the care bundle at ~£140 per birth. However, neither the costs nor changes in outcomes could be definitively attributed to implementation of the SBL care bundle. Conclusions Implementation of the SBL care bundle increased over time in the majority of sites. Implementation was associated with improvements in process outcomes. The reduction in stillbirth rates in participating sites exceeded that reported nationally in the same timeframe. The intervention should be refined to identify women who are most likely to benefit and minimise unwarranted intervention.

Mitochondria from MCU-KO and MCU/CyD-DKO mice displayed reduced Ca2+ uptake and diminished extent of PTP induction. The Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria from CyD-KO mice was increased compared with mitochondria from WT mice. Deletion of CyD prevented mitochondrial swelling and resulted in transient depolarization in response to Ca2+, but it did not prevent Ca2+-induced delayed mitochondrial depolarization.

PTP induction caused by excessive Ca2+ accumulation is the major mechanism of Ca2+-induced mitochondrial damage (5Bernardi P.

Induction of the PTP leads to mitochondrial depolarization and swelling of the organelles (16Bernardi P. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore: A mystery solved?.Front. Physiol. 2013; 4: 95Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In addition to PTP, mitochondrial depolarization can be induced by free fatty acids (FFAs) (17Schonfeld P. Schild L. Kunz W.

In our previous study with brain mitochondria from MCU-KO mice, we showed that a combination of PTP inhibitors, cyclosporin A (CsA), ADP, and bovine serum albumin (BSA, free from FFA), completely inhibited mitochondrial swelling induced by Ca2+, thereby attributing mitochondrial swelling to PTP induction (14Hamilton J.

However, in this previous study, we did not investigate the effect of PTP inhibitors on Ca2+-induced mitochondrial depolarization (14Hamilton J. Brustovetsky T. Rysted J.E. Lin Z. Usachev Y.M.

The molecular composition of the PTP is still an area of active research and zealous debate (20Bernardi P. Mechanisms for Ca(2+)-dependent permeability transition in mitochondria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2020; 117: 2743-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, there is a consensus regarding the involvement of mitochondrial cyclophilin D (CyD) in the PTP (21Baines C.P.

Early studies established that CyD is a molecular target for CsA, and application of CsA to isolated mitochondria increases mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and defers PTP induction (25Crompton M.

In the present study, we compared the functions of brain mitochondria from CyD-KO and MCU-KO mice and their genetic backgrounds C57BL/6 and CD1 mice, respectively. In addition, we analyzed brain mitochondria from MCU/CyD-double KO (MCU/CyD-DKO) mice. We investigated, in particular, the effect of CyD deletion on PTP induction in brain mitochondria lacking MCU. Deletion of CyD prevented Ca2+-induced swelling of MCU-KO brain mitochondria but could not completely preclude Ca2+-induced sustained mitochondrial depolarization. The latter was attenuated by dibucaine, a phospholipase A2 inhibitor, and prevented by BSA, suggesting involvement of a phospholipase A2- and FFA-dependent mechanism of depolarization in Ca2+-treated brain mitochondria from MCU/CyD-DKO mice. In our experiments, we used MCU-KO and CyD-KO mice, and their genetic backgrounds CD1 and C57BL/6 mice, respectively. In addition, we generated MCU/CyD-DKO mice by crossing MCU-KO mice with CyD-KO mice and then interbreeding the resultant F1 progeny to produce mice that were null for both MCU and CyD. Every mouse used in our experiments was genotyped. Figure 1, A and B show representative genotyping data of tail tissue from WT, MCU-KO, CyD-KO, and MCU/CyD-DKO mice. Samples from the same mice were used to determine the presence or absence of DNA encoding MCU (upper panel) and CyD (lower panel). In addition, immunoblotting was used to confirm the absence of MCU and CyD in all mitochondrial preparations used in our experiments (Fig. 1C). We used a Ca2+-sensitive electrode to evaluate Ca2+ uptake by isolated Percoll-purified brain mitochondria. Ca2+ retention capacity (also known as Ca2+ uptake capacity (27Murphy A.N. Bredesen D.E.

Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was monitored by following a decrease in Ca2+ concentration in the incubation medium outside of mitochondria. Despite complete deletion of MCU in MCU-KO and MCU/CyD-DKO mice (Fig. 1C), brain mitochondria from these animals were able to take Ca2+ up (Fig. 2, C, D and I–L). Similar results were recently reported for mitochondria isolated from photoreceptor cells (31Bisbach C.M. Hutto R.A. Poria D. Cleghorn W.M. Abbas F. Vinberg F. Kefalov V.J. Hurley J.B. Brockerhoff S.E. Mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) deficiency reveals an alternate path for Ca(2+) uptake in photoreceptor mitochondria.Sci. Rep. 2020; 10: 16041Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previously reported data (14Hamilton J. Brustovetsky T. Rysted J.E. Lin Z. Usachev Y.M. Brustovetsky N. Deletion of mitochondrial calcium uniporter incompletely inhibits calcium uptake and induction of the permeability transition pore in brain mitochondria.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 15652-15663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), brain mitochondria isolated from CD1 mice accumulated Ca2+ at a six times higher rate than brain mitochondria isolated from MCU-KO mice (Fig. 2, M and N). The total amount of accumulated Ca2+ was nine times smaller in brain mitochondria from MCU-KO mice compared with mitochondria from WT CD1 mice (Fig. 2, A–D, K and L). In contrast to the difference between CD1 and MCU-KO mitochondria, brain mitochondria from CyD-KO mice accumulated two times more Ca2+ compared with brain mitochondria from C57BL/6 mice, the genetic background for CyD-KO mice (Fig. 2, E–H, K and L). These results with CyD-KO mitochondria are consistent with our previously reported data that demonstrated increased Ca2+ uptake in brain mitochondria isolated from CyD-KO mice compared with mitochondria from C57BL/6 mice (26Li V. Brustovetsky T. Brustovetsky N. Role of cyclophilin D-dependent mitochondrial permeability transition in glutamate-induced calcium deregulation and excitotoxic neuronal death.Exp. Neurol. 2009; 218: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Ca2+ retention capacity of mitochondria from MCU/CyD-DKO mice was similar to the Ca2+ retention capacity of mitochondria from MCU-KO mice (Fig. 2, C, D and I–L). Similar to MCU-KO mitochondria, the rate of Ca2+ uptake by MCU/CyD-DKO brain mitochondria was six times slower than the rates of Ca2+ uptake by brain mitochondria from CD1, C57BL/6, or CyD-KO mice (Fig. 2, M and N). The influx of Ca2+ into the mitochondrial matrix can activate pyruvate dehydrogenase and the TCA cycle enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, thus stimulating mitochondrial respiration (3Denton R.M. Regulation of mitochondrial dehydrogenases by calcium ions.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1787: 1309-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibition of Ca2+ uptake could affect mitochondrial respiration. To investigate the effect of suppressed Ca2+ uptake on mitochondrial respiration, we used a Clark-type oxygen electrode to measure the rate of oxygen consumption by mitochondria. We assessed basal respiration with only substrates present in the incubation medium (V2), respiration stimulated by ADP (V3), respiration after depletion of exogenous ADP (V4), and maximal, uncoupled respiration in the presence of the uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol (VDNP). In our experiments, we evaluated the respiratory rates of both nonsynaptic and synaptic mitochondria from CD1, C57BL/6, MCU-KO, CyD-KO, and MCU/CyD-DKO. We did not find a significant difference in mitochondrial respiration among brain mitochondria from any of these five mouse strains (Fig. 3, A and B). Statistical summary of respiratory data is shown in Figure 3, C and D. In subsequent experiments, we assessed the stimulating effect of Ca2+ on respiration of nonsynaptic and synaptic brain mitochondria from control, CD1 mice, and MCU/CyD-DKO mice (Fig. 4). Previously, we showed that Ca2+ could inhibit respiration of mitochondria oxidizing pyruvate plus malate but not succinate plus glutamate (14Hamilton J. Brustovetsky T. Rysted J.E. Lin Z. Usachev Y.M. Brustovetsky N. Deletion of mitochondrial calcium uniporter incompletely inhibits calcium uptake and induction of the permeability transition pore in brain mitochondria.J. Biol.

Calcium-induced cytochrome c release from CNS mitochondria is associated with the permeability transition and rupture of the outer membrane.J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Consequently, in our present experiments, mitochondria were fueled with 3 mM succinate plus 3 mM glutamate. Predictably, the Ca2+-stimulated respiration of mitochondria from CD1 mice was more robust compared with Ca2+-stimulated respiration of mitochondria from MCU/CyD-DKO mice. Although basal respiration (V2) was not different in mitochondria from MCU/CyD-DKO versus mitochondria from CD1 mice, Ca2+-stimulated respiration assessed immediately after Ca2+ addition (VCa′), and at the maximal O2 consumption, (VCamax) was ∼50% slower, signifying the persistence of Ca2+ uptake at a slower rate in the DKO mitochondria.Figure 4Ca2+-stimulated respiration of brain nonsynaptic and synaptic mitochondria isolated from CD1 and MCU/CyD-DKO mice.

In these and other similar experiments, we simultaneously monitored changes in mitochondrial swelling by following light scattering of the mitochondrial suspension as well as changes in mitochondrial membrane potential by measuring the distribution of the lipophilic cation tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+) across the IMM. Addition of CaCl2 (100 μM) to brain mitochondria from CD1 and MCU-KO mice (Fig. 5) produced a decrease in light scattering, indicating mitochondrial swelling, and an increase in TPP+ concentration in the incubation medium ([TPP+]ext), indicating mitochondrial depolarization. The amount of mitochondrial swelling induced by Ca2+ was quantified as a percentage of maximal mitochondrial swelling induced by the pore-forming peptide alamethicin (33Vodyanoy I. Bezrukov S.M.

Acta. 2010; 1797: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Addition of Ca2+ (100 μM) to brain mitochondria from MCU-KO mice produced approximately two times less swelling and depolarization compared with CD1 mitochondria (Fig. 5). The decreased amplitude of Ca2+-induced mitochondrial swelling and diminished depolarization suggested that mitochondria from MCU-KO mice have reduced propensity for PTP induction but are still capable of undergoing the permeability transition. Statistical summaries of mitochondrial swelling and membrane potential are shown in Figure 5, E and F, respectively. Application of 100 μM Ca2+ to nonsynaptic (Fig. 6A) and synaptic (Fig. 6B) mitochondria isolated from C57BL/6 mice resulted in swelling of the organelles and caused a rapid, sustained depolarization. On the other hand, when applied to nonsynaptic (Fig. 6C) and synaptic (Fig. 6D) mitochondria from CyD-KO mice, a 100 μM Ca2+ pulse did not result in mitochondrial swelling but did cause a rapid, transient depolarization. Within 5 min following addition of Ca2+, CyD-KO mitochondria became repolarized to a level approaching the membrane potential before Ca2+ addition. However, later, without any additional Ca2+ application, CyD-KO mitochondria became gradually depolarized, without any measurable corresponding change in swelling and were completely depolarized 12 min after Ca2+ application (Fig. 6, C and D). Predictably, this delayed depolarization was not sensitive to CsA (not shown) and, therefore, could not be attributed to induction of the classical PTP. Another possibility was the uncoupling action of FFA. We hypothesized that Ca2+ accumulated in mitochondria could activate mitochondrial Ca2+-dependent phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which produces FFA (35Nishida T. Inoue T. Kamiike W. Kawashima Y. Tagawa K.

We also described its in vitro ion channel activity using patch clamp recording and investigated its anti-inflammatory activity in LPS-induced Raw 264.7 macrophage cells and carrageenan-induced paw edema in mice. FS48 was found to adopt a common αββ structure and contain an atypical dyad motif. It dose-dependently exhibited the Kv1.3 channel in Raw 264.7 and HEK 293T cells, and its ability to block the channel pore was demonstrated by the kinetics of activation and competition binding with tetraethylammonium.

Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels play an important role in Ca2+ signaling, action potential repolarization, cellular proliferation, migration and secretion, and cell volume regulation (1Wulff H. Castle N.A. Pardo L.A. Voltage-gated potassium channels as therapeutic targets.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2009; 8: 982-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Their crucial involvement in the above physiological processes makes Kv channels important targets in developing novel therapeutic drugs against cancer, autoimmune diseases, and some diseases related to neurological, metabolic, and cardiovascular disorders (1Wulff H. Castle N.A. Pardo L.A. Voltage-gated potassium channels as therapeutic targets.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2009; 8: 982-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). As an example, Kv1.3 expressed on macrophages and effector memory T lymphocytes is a multifunctional Kv channel and the target of drugs modulating the immune system (2Serrano-Albarras A. Estadella I. Cirera-Rocosa S. Navarro-Perez M. Felipe A. Kv1.3: A multifunctional channel with many pathological implications.Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2018; 22: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As such, highly selective modulators and blockers of Kv1.3 are excellent drug development sources for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Some venomous animals can capture prey and defend against predators by changing the excitability after activation or inhibition of Kv channels in excitable cells. It is therefore not surprising that these channels are targets of a variety of toxins from venomous animals (3Norton R.S. Chandy K.G.

Over the course of long-term evolution, blood-feeding arthropods have gradually developed a rich array of pharmacological peptides and proteins, which are helpful to feed and overwhelm their host's defense system. Transcriptomic and proteomic data from different labs have suggested that defensive responses of host animals related to hemostasis, immunity, and inflammation can be modulated by these various kinds of components (4Mans B.J. Evolution of vertebrate hemostatic and inflammatory control mechanisms in blood-feeding arthropods.J. Innate Immun. 2011; 3: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, only a few of the ion channel modulators or blockers are identified from the salivary glands of bloodsucking arthropods. For example, Vasotab can prolong the action potential and cause positive inotropism of isolated rat heart myocytes (5Takac P. Nunn M.A. Meszaros J. Pechanova O. Vrbjar N. Vlasakova P. Kozanek M.

FS proteins identified in the salivary glands of the cat flea Ctenocephalides felis and the rat flea Xenopsylla cheopis (Rots) (8Andersen J.F. Hinnebusch B.J. Lucas D.A. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D.

Hinnebusch B.J. Lucas D.A. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Pham V.M. Ribeiro J.M. An insight into the sialome of the oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis (rots).BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 102Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We previously reported that FS50 from the flea X. cheopis whose sequence is similar to that of the FS-H antigen of C. felis is an inhibitor of the sodium channel NaV1.5 and can elicit recovery from arrhythmia induced by BaCl2 in rats and monkeys (10Xu X. Zhang B. Yang S. An S. Ribeiro J.M. Andersen J.F. Structure and function of FS50, a salivary protein from the flea Xenopsylla cheopis that blocks the sodium channel NaV1.5.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 36574Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Another FS protein from salivary glands of X. cheopis, FS48, shares extremely low sequence identity to FS50 and high identity to the FS-1 antigen of C. felis. Thus, FS48 is conceived to have different functions from FS50. In this study, we perform an in-depth investigation into the structure and function of FS48. We find that FS48 can effectively block Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.3 channels in the same manner as classical scorpion K+ channel toxins. As expected, FS48 displays anti-inflammatory effects via blocking Kv channels in vivo. Finally, a predicted structural model indicates that FS48 contains the common core αββ structure while lacking the classic functional dyad motif of scorpion toxins. Thus, it seems that FS48 is a novel α-KTx toxin rather than a scorpion toxin mimic. The present work is the first detailed study of a Kv channel blocker from the salivary glands of a blood-feeding arthropod and will provide a view to understand the bloodsucking mechanism of the flea and serve as a novel drug template molecule useful for the design of new Kv1.3 blockers with high selectivity. To evaluate the function of FS48, we obtained the recombinant protein as described previously (10Xu X. Zhang B. Yang S. An S. Ribeiro J.M. Andersen J.F. Structure and function of FS50, a salivary protein from the flea Xenopsylla cheopis that blocks the sodium channel NaV1.5.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 36574Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). As revealed by SDS-PAGE analysis, the FS48 fusion protein (23.38 kDa) was mainly expressed in the soluble fraction in BL21(λDE3) (lane 5) (Fig. 1A, panel a). The His tag was separated from the recombinant peptide using enterokinase, and the 23.38 kDa fusion protein was successfully split into two products, the His tag in a 17 kDa fragment and remainder in a fragment of 6.324 kDa (lane 6). Two peaks from the uncleaved mixture were apparent when separated by cation exchange chromatography after HisTrap HP affinity column (Fig. 1A, panel b). The cleaved FS48 fusion protein was nearly pure after the repurification with a HisTrap HP affinity column with a large peak appearing after about 40 min (Fig. 1A, panel c). Finally, after application to a Superdex 75 column, the purified protein corresponding to FS48 was eluted at about 13 min, was collected manually, and lyophilized (Fig. 1A, panel d). Both MALDI-TOF-MS and SDS-PAGE analyses suggested that FS48 was expressed and purified successfully (Fig. 1, A and B). The concentration of endotoxin was less than 5 EU/kg, which is below the allowable endotoxin limits stipulated by the FDA for IV preparations and an acceptable concentration for cell-based experiments. A final FS48 yield of 1.8 mg/L was obtained, and the protein was stored at −20 °C after freeze-drying. FS48 had a peptide chain of 55 amino acids with 15 charged residues, which were widely distributed throughout the entire molecule (Fig. 2A). As its alignment with known scorpion toxins using Clustal W showed, FS48 shares less than 20% sequence homology but contains the three-disulfide bond feature of the well-characterized scorpion α-KTx toxins, which adopt a well-known cysteine-stabilized α/β scaffold. In addition, although the typical “functional dyad” presenting in Charybdotoxin (ChTX) did not exist in FS48 while residues C49-C55 were relatively conserved when compared with scorpion toxins such as Agitoxin-2 (AgTx-2) and ChTX (Fig. 2B). The circular dichroism (CD) spectra analysis showed that FS48 contained α-helix, β-sheet, and random coil in aqueous solution such as ChTX (Fig. 2C). The predicted structure of FS48 was characterized by the presence of an α-helix with three turns running from V28 to C39 and a double-stranded antiparallel β-sheet composed of residues Q46-V49 and K52-C55. Two β-sheets were separated by a well-defined type I β-turn formed by the G50 plus K51 residues and connected by disulfide bridges, C31-C53 and C35-C55, to the α-helix and by disulfide C22-C48 to a loop spanning residues I18–D27, respectively. A tight turn formed by the residues K40–R45 separates the α-helix and the β-sheet. In addition, FS48 like FS50 contained an additional αββ structure with a small α-helix running from A3-Y6 and two strands of β-sheet spanning residues K9–T11 and G14–T17. Two structural regions were linked by the large loop spanning residues I18–D27 and the fourth disulfide bridge, C8–C39 (Fig. 2D). Of note, the surface of FS48 mainly consists of hydrophilic and polar amino acid residues, which are exposed to the solvent (Fig. 2E). Structural superimposition demonstrated that the overall fold of FS48 was very similar to those kv1.x channel blocking peptides such as AgTx-2 and ChTX (Fig. 2, F and G). Additionally, an atypical dyad comprising R45 and Y54 at the C terminus of FS48 could be well superimposed with that of ChTX at an ideal distance of about 6.8 Å between the carbon atom of R45 and the center of the aromatic ring of Y54 (Fig. 2, F and G). To further explore the mechanism of FS48 blockade of the Kv1.3 channel, a reasonable FS48-Kv1.3 complex model was obtained through bioinformatics methods using Z-docking. As shown in Figure 2H, FS48 took its β-sheet domains as the major channel-interacting surface in contrast with the fact that almost all negatively charged residues excluding D15, such as E5, D25, D27 and E37, were situated in the nonbinding interface. Although FS48 did not contain conserved pore-blocking K27 and Y36 residues like most Kv1.x toxins (11Rodriguez D.L.V.R. Possani L.D. Current views on scorpion toxins specific for K+-channels.Toxicon. 2004; 43: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), the equivalent R45 of FS48 may project its side chain into the selectivity filter of Kv1.3 channel and interact with the conserved pore-blocking domain GYGDM located in S5-S6 subunit of Kv1.3 through several hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (Fig. 2, H and I). The phenol ring of Y54 seems to make pivotal contacts between FS48 and the vestibule of Kv1.3 channel via additional four hydrogen bonds with Y400 and G401 locating different subunits (Fig. 2H). Moreover, Y54 might also interact with Kv1.3 through six hydrophobic interactions with GYD locating different subunits (Fig. 2J). K9 and 52K could react with D376 locating the D link and E374 locating the B link in the turret domain, thus playing the role of the additional positively charged residue of the toxin (Fig. 2H). In addition, several extra hydrogen bond interactions were localized in the binding interface. In detail, K7, F20, V49, and K52 of FS48 formed four hydrogen bonds with S378, S379, D402, and G380 locating the B link of S5–S6 subunit while V28 and S47 of FS48 formed two hydrogen bonds with S378 and H404 residues of the channel C chain and T13 of FS48 formed hydrogen bond with H404 residue of the channel D chain (Fig. 2I). Thus, the complex model suggested a structural model for FS48 binding to Kv1.3 channel. Since primary structure sequence alignments showed that FS48 belonged to the cysteine-stabilized α/β fold, known as the scorpion toxin-like superfamily, and might have effects on Na+ and K+ channels (11Rodriguez D.L.V.R. Possani L.D. Current views on scorpion toxins specific for K+-channels.Toxicon. 2004; 43: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), the effect of FS48 was first examined on DRG neurons and HEK 293T cells expressing human Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, Kv2.1, Kv4.1 with the whole-cell patch clamp technique. As displayed in Figure 3, under the administration of FS48, no change of inward currents was observed when TTX-S (Fig. 3A) and TTX-R Na+ channels (Fig. 3B) were activated by a −10 mV depolarization, indicating that both TTX-S and TTX-R Na+ channels on DRG neurons were FS48-resistant. The currents of Ca2+ channels on rat DRG cells were also completely insensitive to FS48 (Fig. 3C). For three neurons tested, 10 μM FS48 induced less than about a 3% decrease in current amplitudes of Na+ and Ca2+ channels. However, FS48 at 10 μM concentration reduced currents of K+ channels on rat DRG cells by about 12% (Fig. 3D, n = 5). The effects of FS48 on Kv channels were then determined on HEK 293T cells expressing Kv1.1–1.3, Kv2.1, and Kv4.1. The currents elicited by a +10 mV depolarization were measured before and after the application of FS48. As shown in Figure 4, FS48 at 10 μM had no effect on the currents in Kv2.1 and Kv4.1 expressing cells. However, the administration of 1 μM FS48 reduced by 42.77 ± 3.09%, 23.52 ± 1.08%, and 54.31 ± 1.33% the outward currents mediated by the Kv1.1–1.3 channels, respectively (Fig. 4, n = 5 for each group).Figure 4Pharmacological effects of FS48 on K+ channel subtypes. K+ currents were evoked by 100-ms depolarizing pulses to +10 mV from a holding potential of −70 mV. Representative currents traces of Kv4.1, Kv2.1, Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.3 channels in the bath solution before (black line) and after (red line) the application of 1 uM or 10 uM FS48 and after (blue line) recovering by washout with the perfusion system. Scale bars are given as an inset.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further identify whether FS48 was an external pore blocker, a competition experiment with tetraethylammonium (TEA) was carried out. When 0.2 mM of TEA was added, the Kv1.1 current was reduced by 31.81 ± 1.98% (n = 5) (Fig. 4). However, when a mixture of 0.2 mM TEA and 1 μM FS48 was applied, the observed block was only increased by 7.5 ± 1.3% (n = 5), suggesting an obvious competition of both ligands binding Kv1.1 (Fig. 4). Thus, FS48, just as TEA, suppressed Kv1.1 by binding to the pore and occluding it. The concentration-dependent effect of FS48 binding Kv1.1–1.3 was verified at concentrations ranging from 10 nM to 100 μM. Figure 5 shows the concentration-dependent suppression effects of FS48 on the currents of Kv1.1–1.3, producing IC50 values against the three subtypes of 1.34 ± 0.12 μM, 3.97 ± 0.23 μM, and 0.73 ± 0.08 μM, respectively (Fig. 5, A, E, and I). Notably, toward higher protein concentrations, the concentration–response curve showed saturation at above 95% inhibition of the K+ currents, suggesting that FS48 bound the channels with a high efficacy (Fig. 5, A, E, and I). Furthermore, the inhibition kinetics of FS48 were analyzed to identify the important role of the membrane depolarization on its binding to three subtypes. 5 μM or 10 μM of FS48 caused a rapid suppression within about 12–16 s. However, the inhibition was readily reversible, and an almost complete recovery was observed after the washout with FS48-free external solution, with the time constant of 13 ± 3 s, which suggested an extracellular site of action (Fig. 5, B, F, and J). The current–voltage relationships were explored with 200-ms voltage stimuli, ranging from −70 to +20 mV in a 10 mV step. As could be seen from the current–voltage curve before and after exposure to 1 μM FS48 (Fig. 5, C, G, and K), K+ currents were initially elicited at around −50 mV (n = 5). The maximum current was observed at +20 mV for the control. After treatment with 1 μM FS48, K+ current amplitudes at all test potentials were reduced. At 20 mV, the currents were decreased by 40.43 ± 1.97%, 27.69 ± 2.89%, and 47.5 ± 2.34%, respectively (Fig. 5, C, G, and K). However, the voltage dependence of activation was not shifted by FS48, which implied that FS48 did not affect the voltage sensor of Kv1.1–1.3 subtypes. Additionally, the ratio of K+ current amplitude in the presence of peptide to one in its absence showed that the blocking effect of FS48 was voltage-independent. In order to elucidate whether FS48 inhibited the current through a physical obstruction of Kv channel pore or gating modification mechanism, the effects of FS48 on steady-state activation of Kv1.1–1.3 subtypes were investigated (Fig. 5, D, H, and L). The curves in the absence and presence of 1 μM FS48 were characterized by a V1/2 values of −20.85 ± 0.69 mV and −22.62 ± 0.73 mV, −20.98 ± 0.14 mV and −21.22 ± 0.19 mV, −18.33 ± 0.13 mV and −18.83 ± 0.24 mV, respectively. Moreover, no significant changes were observed in the slopes of the curves before and after a 10-min exposure to 1 μM FS48. Thus, the cooperativity of the four voltage sensors of Kv1.1–1.3 subtypes was not affected by FS48 binding. Taken together, these results further indicated that FS48 performed its inhibitory effects via a voltage-independent pore-blocking mechanism. In order to identify the sites of interaction between FS48 and Kv1.3, we constructed two mutants with R45 to A and R45 to K and examined their effects on Kv1.3 currents after mutants were expressed and purified. The results showed that 200 nM FS48R45 K did not alter the activities suppressing Kv1.3 channel. However, 200 nM FS48R45 A markedly reduced its activities suppressing Kv1.3 channel when compared with 200 nM wild-type FS48 (Fig. S1). Kv1.3 is highly expressed in activated macrophages and plays important roles in apoptosis, migration, phagocytosis, and immunomodulation of macrophages (12Villalonga N. David M. Bielanska J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 46307-46320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To investigate whether FS48 had effects on the function of Kv channels of macrophages, the Kv currents evoked by depolarizing pulses in Raw 264.7 cells were measured under the administration of FS48. As shown by Figure 6A, at +40 mV, both 100 nM MgTx, a highly specific Kv1.3 blocker, and 10 μM FS48 reduced the amplitude of the Kv current of LPS-activated macrophages by 59.45 ± 2.79% and 54.63 ± 4.94%, respectively. The current–voltage relationships were analyzed by using 150-ms voltage steps, ranging from −50 to +40 mV in steps of 10 mV at 2 s intervals, as depicted in Figure 6B. Once the channels opened at around −50 mV, robust outward current increases were observed in LPS-activated Raw 264.7 cells at all depolarizing voltages applied from −50 to +40 mV (black line, n= 4). However, the currents at all test voltages were reduced markedly by the treatment with 1 μM FS48 (red line) or 100 nM MgTx (blue line). Apart from acute inhibition of functional Kv1.3 channels, Kv1.3 blockers have been proven to exhibit anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects by decreasing the channel expression (2Serrano-Albarras A. Estadella I. Cirera-Rocosa S. Navarro-Perez M. Felipe A. Kv1.3: A multifunctional channel with many pathological implications.Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2018; 22: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Before analysis, the cytotoxic effect of FS48 on murine macrophages was evaluated by the MTT method. As shown in Figure 7A, the addition of 0.1–30 μM FS48 to cells for 24 h did not inhibit the proliferation of Raw 264.7 cells. To analyze the effect of FS48 on Kv1.3 channel expression, Raw 264.7 cells activated by 100 ng/ml LPS were exposed to 3 μM FS48 and 100 nM MgTx for 24 h before the mRNA and protein expression of Kv1.3 were measured using real-time PCR and western blot analysis. FS48 and MgTx greatly reduced mRNA expression induced by LPS (Fig. 7B). Correspondingly, the amount of Kv1.3 protein elicited by LPS also was inhibited by FS48 and MgTx (Fig. 7C). On average, 3 μM FS48 and 100 nM MgTx decreased Kv1.3 protein expression induced by LPS by 73.58 ± 7.25% and 76.15 ± 13.81%, respectively (Fig. 7, C and D). As nitric oxide (NO) is an important indicator of macrophage activation, we explored the effects of FS48 on the NO production induced by LPS in Raw 264.7 cells. Compared with the control cells, Raw 264.7 cells stimulated by 100 ng/ml LPS showed a 59.78-fold increase of the mRNA level of iNOS. However, this increase was evidently inhibited by both MgTx and FS48 after exposure for 8 h (Fig. 8A). NO production is positively related to nitrite concentration in culture medium. Therefore, the NO secretion can be examined by determining the nitrite concentration in the supernatants of stimulated cells. As exhibited in Fig. 8B, 100 ng/ml LPS induced nitrite release increase from Raw 264.7 cells by 11.09 μM, but this increase was obviously inhibited by FS48 in a concentration-dependent manner after 24 h incubation. Furthermore, 10 μM FS48 had a similar effects to 100 nM MgTx with both inhibiting LPS-induced nitrite production by about 37.65%, which was in line with the results of mRNA levels. To explore the effects of FS48 on LPS-stimulated inﬂammatory cytokines expression, the gene expression and protein production of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in Raw 264.7 macrophage cells were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and ELISA with MgTx as the positive control. As shown in Figure 8, C–H, 100 ng/ml LPS significantly induced transcription and production of the above three inﬂammatory cytokines. Nevertheless, like MgTx, FS48 signiﬁcantly blocked the production of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 stimulated by LPS in a concentration-dependent manner. To identify whether the inhibitory effect of FS48 on macrophages was mediated by Kv1.3, Kv1.3 expression in Raw 264.7 cells was specifically knocked down using siRNA. Three siRNA sequences were employed, and western blot analysis revealed that the Kv1.3 level in all macrophages transfected with siRNA was obviously downregulated compared with nonsilencing RNA (Fig. 9A). Gene knockdown rates of Kv1.3 by Si-1, Si-2, and Si-3 in LPS-stimulated Raw 264.7 cells were about 38 ± 6.67%, 43.24 ± 10.94%, and 91.4 ± 1.84%, respectively (Fig. 9B). We then further studied the effects of FS48 on macrophages transfected with Si-3. As shown by Figure 9, C–F, the production of NO, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in Raw 264.7 cells stimulated by LPS was not affected by downregulation of the Kv1.3 channel and respectively showed 4.18, 26.13, 16.03, and 108.94-fold increases when compared with the control. However, the downregulation of the Kv1.3 channel greatly reduced the suppressive effects of both MgTx and FS48, which did not inhibit the production of NO, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in Raw 264.7 cells stimulated by LPS when compared with the control. The results confirmed that the blockage of Kv1.3 by FS48 was responsible for its suppressive effects on macrophage cells. The Kv1.3 channel is closely associated with MAPK/NF-κB pathways, which play key roles in the production of inﬂammatory cytokines (16Kan X.H. Gao H.Q. Ma Z.Y. Liu L. Ling M.Y. Wang Y.Y.

Immunopharmacol. 2018; 63: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects of FS48 on LPS-stimulated inﬂammatory signaling pathways were investigated by western blot. As shown in Figure 10A, compared with normal cells, addition of 100 ng/ml LPS significantly activated MAPK/NF-κB pathways and increased the amounts of phosphorylated ERK, JNK, p38, and the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB p65 subunit. However, like the positive control, MgTx, FS48 evidently abrogated the increasing levels of phosphorylated ERK, JNK, p38, and nucleus translocation of NF-κB p65 induced by LPS. Their reduction rates were 45.78 ± 2.85%, 44.44 ± 2.31%, 54.23 ± 2.03%, and 44.25 ± 7.04%, respectively (Fig. 10B). The results suggested that FS48 inhibited the inflammatory factor expression in LPS-activated macrophages via suppressing MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathways. The effect of FS48 in acute inﬂammation was identified with the carrageenan-induced paw e"

However, up to 1 in 11 participants are colour blind. We simulate the impact of various forms of colour blindness on measurements with the Forel-Ule scale, which is used to measure water colour by eye with a 21-colour scale. Colour blindness decreases the median discriminability between Forel-Ule colours by up to 33% and makes several colour pairs essentially indistinguishable. This reduces the precision and accuracy of citizen science data and the motivation of participants.

These conclusions and recommendations apply to colour-based citizen science in general, including other classification and monitoring activities. Being inclusive of the colour blind increases both the social and scientific impact of citizen science."
https://openalex.org/W3155065301,"Interaction of talin with the cytoplasmic tails of integrin β triggers integrin activation, leading to an increase of integrin affinity/avidity for extracellular ligands. In talin KO mice, loss of talin interaction with platelet integrin αIIbβ3 causes a severe hemostatic defect, and loss of talin interaction with endothelial cell integrin αVβ3 affects angiogenesis. In normal cells, talin is autoinhibited and localized in the cytoplasm. Here, we used an optogenetic platform to assess whether recruitment of full-length talin to the plasma membrane was sufficient to induce integrin activation. A dimerization module (Arabidopsis cryptochrome 2 fused to the N terminus of talin; N-terminal of cryptochrome-interacting basic helix-loop-helix domain ended with a CAAX box protein [C: cysteine; A: aliphatic amino acid; X: any C-terminal amino acid]) responsive to 450 nm (blue) light was inserted into Chinese hamster ovary cells and endothelial cells also expressing αIIbβ3 or αVβ3, respectively. Thus, exposure of the cells to blue light caused a rapid and reversible recruitment of Arabidopsis cryptochrome 2–talin to the N-terminal of cryptochrome-interacting basic helix-loop-helix domain ended with a CAAX box protein [C: cysteine; A: aliphatic amino acid; X: any C-terminal amino acid]–decorated plasma membrane. This resulted in β3 integrin activation in both cell types, as well as increasing migration of the endothelial cells. However, membrane recruitment of talin was not sufficient for integrin activation, as membrane-associated Ras-related protein 1 (Rap1)–GTP was also required. Moreover, talin mutations that interfered with its direct binding to Rap1 abrogated β3 integrin activation. Altogether, these results define a role for the plasma membrane recruitment of talin in β3 integrin activation, and they suggest a nuanced sequence of events thereafter involving Rap1–GTP."

Constipation-induced male rats were treated orally with low to high doses of HLp-nF1 and an anti-constipation medication Dulcolax for five weeks. Study has 8 groups, control group; loperamide-treated group; Dulcolax-treated group; treatment with 3.2 × 10 10 , 8 × 10 10 and 1.6 × 10 11 , cells/mL HLp-nF1; Loperamide + Dulcolax treated group. HLp-nF1 treated rats showed improvements in fecal pellet number, weight, water content, intestinal transit length, and contractility compared to the constipation-induced rats. Also, an increase in the intestine mucosal layer thickness and the number of mucin-producing crypt epithelial cells were observed in HLp-nF1-treated groups. Further, the levels of inflammatory cytokines levels were significantly downregulated by treatment with HLp-nF1 and Dulcolax. Notably, the metagenomics sequencing analysis demonstrated a similar genus pattern to the pre-preparation group and control with HLp-nF1 treatment. In conclusion, the administration of &gt;3.2 × 10 10 cells/mL HLp-nF1 has a positive impact on the constipated rats overall health."

This study evaluates the effect this policy has had. Panel data of 1,049 counties in China from 2015 to 2019 are used for the regression discontinuity design (RD) to estimate the impact of B&amp;V on the improvement of the income level of rural residents. The results show that, compared to the counties without the B&amp;V policy, the income of rural residents in counties with B&amp;V has increased by 1.468–1.518 times, which is nearly 1.3 times the sample mean of survey data, indicating that the income level of rural residents has been improved significantly by B&amp;V. However, the quantile regression results show that the higher the income level of rural residents, the smaller the effect of this policy. From the dynamic effect of years, the influence curve of B&amp;V on rural residents’ income is an inverted U-shaped, first increasing and then decreasing, and the impact of this policy on the income level of highly-educated farmers is greater. Finally, three different methods are used to verify the robustness of the model."
https://openalex.org/W3154252828,"The Speech-to-Song Illusion is an auditory illusion that occurs when a spoken phrase is repeatedly presented. After several presentations, listeners report that the phrase seems to be sung rather than spoken. Previous work [1] indicates that the mechanisms—priming, activation, and satiation—found in the language processing model, Node Structure Theory (NST), may account for the Speech-to-Song Illusion. NST also accounts for other language-related phenomena, including increased experiences in older adults of the tip-of-the-tongue state (where you know a word, but can’t retrieve it). Based on the mechanism in NST used to account for the age-related increase in the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon, we predicted that older adults may be less likely to experience the Speech-to-Song Illusion than younger adults. Adults of a wide range of ages heard a stimulus known to evoke the Speech-to-Song Illusion. Then, they were asked to indicate if they experienced the illusion or not (Study 1), to respond using a 5-point song-likeness rating scale (Study 2), or to indicate when the percept changed from speech to song (Study 3). The results of these studies suggest that the illusion is experienced with similar frequency and strength, and after the same number of repetitions by adult listeners regardless of age."
https://openalex.org/W3154637257,"We develop an integrative conceptual framework that seeks to explain individual differences in the ability to use information and communication technologies (ICT skills). Building on practice engagement theory, this framework views the continued usage of digital technologies at work and in everyday life (ICT use) as the key prerequisite for the acquisition of ICT skills. At the same time, the framework highlights that ICT use is itself contingent upon individual and contextual preconditions. We apply this framework to data from two recent German large-scale studies ( N = 2,495 and N = 2,786, respectively) that offer objective measures of adults’ ICT skills. Findings support our framework’s view of ICT use as a key prerequisite for ICT skills. Moreover, they demonstrate that literacy skills have strong associations with ICT skills, largely by virtue of their indirect associations through ICT use. By comparison, regional digital cultures (as proxied by internet domain registration rates) evince only limited explanatory power for individual differences in ICT skills."
https://openalex.org/W3155096338,"Soil phosphorus (P) deficiency is a major constraint of crop production in Sub-Saharan Africa. In particular, in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of Burkina Faso, P is rarely replenished as fertilizer supplies are limited in rural areas and because of the socio-economic situation of farmers. There is however, an abundance of local phosphate rock resource in the country. The development of local inorganic P fertilizers to improve crop production and replace the nutrients removed after harvesting, as well as to promote to sustainable agriculture, is desired. This study evaluated the efficiency of low-grade Burkina Faso phosphate rock (BPR)-based P fertilizers, produced by acidulation and calcination-the major fertilizer processing methods, on lowland rice production and the soil factors influencing their effectiveness. The results showed that the acidulated P fertilizers were as effective as conventional commercial P fertilizers on various soil types, textures, and fertility. Calcined P fertilizers were consistently effective on fine-textured soils with high basic fertility. It was found that fine soil texture and basic fertility of the initial soils were important factors in agronomic efficiency of BPR-based fertilizers and the resilience of rice production to climatic variability. It is recommended that soil type, with respect to soil texture, soil properties, inherent fertility, and water availability, should be considered when using BPR-based fertilizers for rice cultivation."
https://openalex.org/W3155468471,"Introduction Abortions remain one of the highest contributors to maternal deaths in Ghana. In 2003, a policy on post-abortion care was introduced to help reduce abortion-related mortality and morbidity. However, depending on the method of pregnancy termination; women encounter varying experiences. This study examines the experiences of women seeking post-abortion care services in a Regional Hospital in Ghana. Materials and methods In-depth interview technique was used to collect data from 20 purposively selected post-abortion care clients at the Volta Regional Hospital. Data were analysed manually using a qualitative content analysis technique. Results The study found that medical abortion was the main method of pregnancy termination used by women who participated in the study to induce abortion. Spontaneous abortion, however, was attributed mainly to engaging in activities that required the use of excessive energy and travelling on bad roads by pregnant women. The study also revealed that, women do not seek early post-abortion care services due to stigma and poverty. Conclusions We found that severity of pain from complications, stigma and financial constraints were factors that influenced women’s decision to seek post-abortion care services. Our findings also suggest that women who experienced spontaneous abortion mainly received financial and emotional support from partners and other family members. To encourage women to seek early post-abortion care services, the Ministry of Health and the Ghana Health Service should take pragmatic steps to educate women on the dangers associated with delay in seeking post-abortion care services and the factors that expose women to spontaneous abortions."
https://openalex.org/W3155997967,"Light is the key regulator of circadian clock, the time-keeping system synchronizing organism physiology and behavior with environmental day and night conditions. In its natural habitat, the strictly subterranean naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) has lived in a light-free environment for millennia. We questioned if this species retains a circadian clock and if the patterns of this clock and concomitant rhythms differed in liver tissue from mice and naked mole-rats. As expected, in mice, the various circadian clock genes peaked at different times of the day; the Period gene (Per) group peaked in the evening, whereas Brain and Muscle ARNT-like1 (Bmal1) gene peaked in the morning; this phase shift is considered to be fundamental for circadian clock function. In sharp contrast, in the naked mole-rat both Per1 and Per2, as well as Bmal1, peaked at the same time in the morning-around ZT2-suggesting the organization of the molecular circadian oscillator was different. Moreover, gene expression rhythms associated with glucose metabolism and mTOR signaling also differed between the species. Although the activity of mTORC1 was lower, while that of mTORC2 was higher in naked mole-rat livers compared to mice, unlike that of mice where the expression profiles of glucose metabolism genes were not synchronized, these were highly synchronized in naked mole-rats and likely linked to their use of feeding times at zeitgebers."

This study aims to assess the validity evidence of the Openness Toward Organizational Change Scale (OTOCS) by examining the internal structure of the measure (e.g., dimensionality, reliability, measurement invariance) and its relations with other variables such as quality of work life, burnout, job satisfaction, and work engagement. A cross-sectional study was conducted using total sample of 1,175 workers, with 565 workers from Portugal and 610 from Brazil. The data provided satisfactory validity evidence based on the internal structure: the expected dimensionality was confirmed, acceptable levels of reliability were found, and measurement invariance was achieved among countries and sex. The measure also demonstrated satisfactory validity evidence based on the relations to other variables, being negatively associated with burnout and positively associated with work engagement, job satisfaction and quality of work. The OTOCS proved to be a relatively short self-report measure with satisfactory validity evidence to be used among Brazilian and Portuguese workers."
https://openalex.org/W3156860536,"Primary cilia are hubs for several signaling pathways, and disruption in cilia function and formation leads to a range of diseases collectively known as ciliopathies. Both ciliogenesis and cilia maintenance depend on vesicle trafficking along a network of microtubules and actin filaments toward the basal body. The DIAPH (Diaphanous-related) family of formins promote both actin polymerization and microtubule (MT) stability. Recently, we showed that the formin DIAPH1 is involved in ciliogenesis. However, the role of other DIAPH family members in ciliogenesis had not been investigated. Here we show that depletion of either DIAPH2 or DIAPH3 also disrupted ciliogenesis and cilia length. DIAPH3 depletion also reduced trafficking within cilia. To specifically examine the role of DIAPH3 at the base, we used fused full-length DIAPH3 to centrin, which targeted DIAPH3 to the basal body, causing increased trafficking to the ciliary base, an increase in cilia length, and formation of bulbs at the tips of cilia. Additionally, we confirmed that the microtubule-stabilizing properties of DIAPH3 are important for its cilia length functions and trafficking. These results indicate the importance of DIAPH proteins in regulating cilia maintenance. Moreover, defects in ciliogenesis caused by DIAPH depletion could only be rescued by expression of the specific family member depleted, indicating nonredundant roles for these proteins."

The resistance training and aerobic training groups participated in twice weekly supervised after-school exercise sessions of &lt; 1 hour instead of their PE class. Sum of skinfolds, lean body mass (bioelectrical impedance analysis), muscular strength (6 repetition maximum (RM)) bench press, lateral pulldown and leg press) and estimated cardiorespiratory fitness (multistage 20 meter shuttle run) were assessed at pre and post intervention. Complete data were available for n = 40 of the resistance training group, n = 40 of the aerobic training group and n = 30 PE (controls). Resistance training attenuated increases in sum of skinfolds compared with controls (d = 0.27, [0.09–0.36]). We found no significant effect on lean body mass. Resistance training produced a positive effect on muscle strength compared with both controls (d = 0.66 [.49-.86]) and aerobic training (d = 0.55[0.28–0.67]). There was a positive effect of resistance training on cardiorespiratory fitness compared with controls (d = 0.04 [-0.10–0.12]) but not compared with aerobic training (d = 0.24 [0.10–0.36]). Replacing a 2-hour PE class with two 1 hour resistance training sessions attenuated gains in subcutaneous adiposity, and enhanced muscle strength and aerobic fitness development in Colombian youth, based on a median attendance of approximately 1 session a week. Further research to assess whether adequate stimuli for the development of muscular fitness exists within current physical education provision is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3154065496,"The formation of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques accompanies the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Tangles are made of fibrillar aggregates formed by the microtubule-associated protein tau, whereas plaques comprise fibrillar forms of amyloid-beta (Aβ). Both form toxic oligomers during aggregation and are thought to interact synergistically to each promote the accumulation of the other. Recent in vitro studies have suggested that the monomeric nonphosphorylated full-length tau protein hinders the aggregation of Aβ1–40 peptide, but whether the same is true for the more aggregation-prone Aβ1–42 was not determined. We used in vitro and in vivo techniques to explore this question. We have monitored the aggregation kinetics of Aβ1–42 by thioflavine T fluorescence in the presence or the absence of different concentrations of nonphosphorylated tau. We observed that elongation of Aβ1–42 fibrils was inhibited by tau in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, the fibrils were structurally different in the presence of tau but did not incorporate tau. Surface plasmon resonance indicated that tau monomers bound to Aβ1–42 oligomers (but not monomers) and hindered their interaction with the anti-Aβ antibody 4G8, suggesting that tau binds to the hydrophobic central core of Aβ recognized by 4G8. Tau monomers also antagonized the toxic effects of Aβ oligomers in Caenorhabditis elegans.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects 15% of individuals over the age of 65 years (1Petersen R.C. Lopez O. Armstrong M.J. Getchius T.S.D. Ganguli M. Gloss D. Gronseth G.S. Marson D. Pringsheim T. Day G.S.

It has a heavy sociohealth impact, partly related to increased life expectancy. Despite the scientific community's effort, no treatment is currently available. Most of the therapies tested so far focused mainly on amyloid-β (Aβ), small peptides of around 39 to 43 amino acids obtained by protease-mediated cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (2Trambauer J. Fukumori A. Steiner H. Pathogenic Aβ generation in familial Alzheimer’s disease: Novel mechanistic insights and therapeutic implications.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2020; 61: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These peptides are found in amyloid deposits (plaques), one of the main pathological hallmarks of AD (3Price J.L. Davis P.B.

Aging. 1991; 12: 295-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Especially abundant are two peptides: Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42. The aggregation of these peptides, particularly by Aβ1–42, is thought to be the most toxic fragment leading to the neuronal damage in AD. However, most treatments focused on the “Amyloid hypothesis” have not been successful (4Mullane K. Williams M.

Tau is a family of microtubules-stabilizing proteins made up of 352 to 441 residues, which are abundant in the central nervous system (7Congdon E.E. Sigurdsson E.M.

This could be because of not only fibrillar and oligomeric Aβ peptides inducing tau hyperphosphorylation, which could lead to loss of tau's microtubule-binding activity and neuron degeneration (12Wallin C.

We investigated a possible direct interaction between tau monomers and Aβ1–42, the most toxic variant of the amyloid precursor protein cleavage products, its impact on the various stages of Aβ1–42 kinetics of fibril and oligomer formation, and on its in vivo toxicity. We used (i) thioflavine T (ThT) to investigate the kinetics of fibril formation in the presence of tau and employed protocols for analyzing the changes in the underlying molecular mechanisms of the aggregation process; (ii) surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to study the direct interaction between tau (2N4R) and Aβ1–42 monomers and oligomers and the changes in oligomer binding to anti-Aβ antibodies in the presence of tau; (iii) transmission electron microscopy (TEM), SDS-PAGE, and Western blot (WB) to further investigate the structure and composition of aggregation products; and (iv) a Caenorhabditis elegans–based toxicity assay, which has been used to detect toxic soluble assemblies of amyloidogenic proteins (13Stravalaci M.

We used a ThT-based aggregation assay to determine the influence of tau on the kinetics and the underlying molecular mechanisms of Aβ1–42 fibril formation (15Cohen S.I.A. Vendruscolo M. Dobson C.M. Knowles T.P.J. From macroscopic measurements to microscopic mechanisms of protein aggregation.J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 421: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Five micromolars of freshly prepared Aβ1–42 were incubated in the absence and presence of five tau concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 7.5 μM in PBS at 37 °C, under quiescent conditions. The solutions contained 20 μM ThT, and the fluorescence intensity was measured every 5 min for up to 30 h. Nonphosphorylated tau delayed Aβ1–42 polymerization in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1). The half-time of transition (50% of the Aβ monomer is converted into fibrils) rises from 2 h in the absence of tau to 10 h with 7.5 μM tau. We then made a quantitative analysis of the effects of tau on the kinetics of Aβ1–42 fibril formation by fitting integrated rate laws to the aggregation traces (Fig. 1, A–C) (15Cohen S.I.A.

We perturbed previously determined rate constants of the dominating process (surface-induced secondary nucleation) (16Beeg M. Stravalaci M. Romeo M. Carrá A.D. Cagnotto A. Rossi A. Diomede L.

This showed that the elongation rate (Fig. 1C) was particularly perturbed since only a reduction of this rate can explain the experimental results. The elongation rate constant was lowered by approximately two orders of magnitude compared with that in the absence of tau (k+0) (Fig. 1D). This was further confirmed in experiments under the same conditions as before but with 10% (mass equivalent) of preformed sonicated Aβ1–42 fibrils. In this condition, the nucleation steps were bypassed, and the dominant process for the consumption of monomers was the elongation. Tau significantly affected the aggregation kinetics (Fig. 2), and the experimental aggregation curves are described well by the mathematical model, when the elongation rate is lowered (Fig. 2). The reaction curve of non-normalized ThT values from Figure 1A showed that the highest ThT value rose three times during the fibril formation of Aβ1–42 in the presence of 5 μM tau compared with Aβ1–42 alone (Fig. 1A). This might be due to changes in the fibril structure, which could increase the number of ThT-binding sites. Alternatively, more fibrillary material might form as a result of Aβ–tau heteroaggregation or the formation of tau fibrils. First, we used TEM to determine the morphology of the fibrils formed during the aggregation of 5 μM Aβ1–42 with and without 5 μM of tau for 48 h (Fig. 3, A and B). The aggregates formed in the presence of tau were longer, thicker, and straighter (Fig. 3B) than the fibrillary aggregates in the solution only containing Aβ1–42 (Fig. 3A). We used an SPR sandwich assay to clarify whether heterogeneous Aβ–tau aggregates were formed. The solutions used in the TEM experiment and tau alone, incubated for 48 h, were flowed first over anti-Aβ (Fig. 4A) or antitau (Fig. 4B) antibodies immobilized on the chip surface. The anti-Aβ antibody (6E10) captured Aβ1–42 species, either with or without tau, but no binding was detected flowing tau alone, as expected (Fig. 4A). Subsequent injection of the antitau secondary antibody gave no binding signal for any of the solutions suggesting that the Aβ1–42 species captured by immobilized 6E10 did not contain tau. A subsequent third injection of 6E10 gave a binding signal on the lanes where Aβ species were captured previously (blue line), confirming that they are Aβ oligomers. However, 6E10 did not detect the Aβ species captured by immobilized 6E10 after injection of the tau–Aβ mixture. Again, this might be due to the structural differences of Aβ1–42 aggregates, preventing their binding to 6E10, so that only the binding of Aβ monomers is detected under this condition. Figure 4A shows that the antitau antibody (Dako) captured tau, either with or without Aβ, whereas no binding was detected with Aβ alone. The species in the tau–Aβ mixture captured by the antitau antibody do not appear to contain Aβ1–42, since 6E10 injected as secondary antibody did not cause any binding signal. The similarity of the sensorgrams and the absence of any ThT signal with tau alone suggest there is a similar amount of monomeric tau in the solution and that Aβ1–42 does not induce the formation of tau aggregates. This was further supported by SDS-PAGE separation followed by Coomassie blue (CB) staining and/or Western blot (WB). The solution containing tau alone or Aβ with tau at time 0 and after 48 h had the same intense tau monomer band at 63 kDa in the CB-stained 12% gel (Fig. 4C). The separation and identification of Aβ1–42 aggregates after 48 h was possible with 8% SDS-PAGE gel and CB/WB (Fig. 4D). A notable amount of Aβ1–42 aggregates was situated in the stacking gel of Aβ1–42-containing solutions incubated with and without tau. When tau was present during the aggregation, there was an additional high–molecular-weight band recognized by the anti-Aβ 6E10 antibody (Fig. 4D), further supporting the formation of different Aβ1–42 aggregates in the presence of tau. SPR was then used to further study the direct interaction between different species of Aβ1–42 and tau protein. Tau fibrils were formed by incubating 50 μM tau in 50 mM phosphate buffer (PB) at pH 7.4 in the presence of heparin and 1 mM dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane at 37 °C. The kinetics of fibril formation was monitored by ThT fluorescence, which showed that the plateau was reached after 23 h (Fig. 5A). The formation of fibrils was confirmed by atomic force microscopy, which showed straight and several micrometer-long fibrils (Fig. 5A, inset). Tau monomers and fibrils were then immobilized in parallel surfaces of an SPR chip (Fig. 5B), at immobilization levels of 4200 and 770 resonance unit (RU), respectively. The following injection of the antitau antibody A0024 resulted in maximum binding signals of ∼480 and ∼80 RU on immobilized tau monomers and fibrils, respectively (Fig. 5, C and D), in agreement with the immobilization level (Fig. 5B). We then analyzed the direct interaction of Aβ1–42 monomers and oligomers with tau monomers and fibrils. Previous studies showed that toxic high–molecular-weight aggregates are formed during the incubation of highly concentrated Aβ1–42 solutions (13Stravalaci M. Bastone A. Beeg M. Cagnotto A. Colombo L.

The oligomer-rich solution and an aliquot of the same solution taken at the start of the aggregation reaction was then diluted to 10 μM and injected over tau monomers and fibrils immobilized on the chip surface. No binding for either of the 2 Aβ1–42 solutions was observed for the tau fibrils (Fig. 5E). Oligomers, but not monomers of Aβ1–42, bound with high affinity to the tau monomers (Fig. 5F). The results shown in Figure 5F were replicated in three additional independent experiments (data not shown). We then examined whether tau monomers binding to Aβ1–42 oligomers prevented the binding behavior of the latter. We exploited an SPR-based immunoassay, which can distinguish and quantify the specific binding of Aβ monomers and oligomers to immobilized 4G8 (13Stravalaci M. Bastone A. Beeg M. Cagnotto A.

Aβ1–42 oligomer-enriched solutions were diluted to 1 μM into PBS and incubated with or without different tau concentrations (0.1–100 nM). After 10 min, the solutions were injected in parallel over 4G8 immobilized on the chip surface. The presence of tau reduced the SPR signal induced by Aβ1–42 oligomer, in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6A).

We extended this work by using the more aggregation-prone and clinically more relevant fragment Aβ1–42. We found that tau slowed the amyloid fibril formation of Aβ1–42, as previously observed with Aβ1–40 (12Wallin C. Hiruma Y. Wärmländer S.K.T.S. Huvent I. Jarvet J. Abrahams J.P. Gräslund A. Lippens G.

https://openalex.org/W3155539850,"Fibrillin-1 is an extracellular matrix protein which contains one conserved RGD integrin-binding motif. It constitutes the backbone of microfibrils in many tissues, and mutations in fibrillin-1 cause various connective tissue disorders. Although it is well established that fibrillin-1 interacts with several RGD-dependent integrins, very little is known about the associated intracellular signaling pathways. Recent published evidence identified a subset of miRNAs regulated by fibrillin-1 RGD-cell adhesion, with miR-1208 among the most downregulated. The present study shows that the downregulated miR-1208 controls fibroblast proliferation. Inhibitor experiments revealed that fibrillin-1 RGD suppressed miR-1208 expression via c-Src kinase and the downstream JNK signaling. Bioinformatic prediction and experimental target sequence validation demonstrated four miR-1208 binding sites on the ERK2 mRNA and one on the MEK1 mRNA. ERK2 and MEK1 are critical proliferation-promoting kinases. Decreased miR-1208 levels elevated the total and phosphorylated ERK1/2 and MEK1/2 protein levels and the phosphorylated to total ERK1/2 ratio. Together, the data demonstrate a novel outside-in signaling mechanism explaining how fibrillin-1 RGD-cell binding regulates fibroblast proliferation."

Cis-prenyltransferase (cPT) generally catalyzes the consecutive head-to-tail condensation of isoprene units and produces (Z,E-mixed)-polyprenyl pyrophosphates (Fig. 1A) (1Takahashi S. Koyama T. Structure and function of cis-prenyl chain elongating enzymes.Chem. Rec. 2006; 6: 194-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 2Yamashita S. Takahashi S. Molecular mechanisms of natural rubber biosynthesis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2020; 89: 821-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The reaction starts with the transfer of a prenyl group from the first donor substrate, (all-E)-prenyl pyrophosphate such as farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), to the C4 carbon of the acceptor substrate isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP). The pyrophosphate group of the donor substrate is eliminated as inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), concertedly with the C-C bond formation. This C-prenylation reaction yields prenyl pyrophosphate that is elongated by one isoprene unit with a Z-double bond, from which a second prenyltransfer to another IPP molecule proceeds. By repeating a similar condensation reaction, cPTs from bacteria and archaea typically produce a C55 product (undecaprenyl pyrophosphate), while eukaryotic cPTs usually yield longer (>C70) products. The products of cPTs are metabolized into glycosyl carrier lipids such as undecaprenyl phosphate and dolichyl phosphate, which are typically utilized for peptidoglycan biosynthesis and protein N-glycosylation, respectively. In addition, there are cPTs that give much longer or shorter products. Natural rubber is biosynthesized by the action of cPT from Hevea brasiliensis (3Yamashita S. Yamaguchi H. Waki T. Aoki Y.

Shorter (all-Z)-prenyl pyrophosphates such as neryl pyrophosphate, (Z,Z)-FPP, and nerylneryl pyrophosphate are produced from one dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) and 1 to 3 IPP molecules via the actions of plant cPTs and are used as the precursors of terpenes (Fig. 1B) (4Kang J.H.

Some cPT homologs, however, are known to accept prenyl pyrophosphates as an acceptor substrate and yield irregular products formed through head-to-middle prenyl condensation. For example, lavandulyl pyrophosphate synthase (7Demissie Z.A. Erland L.A.E. Rheault M.R. Mahmoud S.S.

MA1831 and MM_0014, which are orthologous cPTs from the methanogenic archaea Methanosarcina acetivorans and Methanosarcina mazei, respectively, unusually accept both IPP and DMAPP as prenyl acceptor substrates (13Emi K.I.

The regular condensation reaction between FPP and IPP gives relatively short polyprenyl pyrophosphates, while the irregular reaction between FPP and DMAPP yields geranyllavandulyl pyrophosphate (Fig. 1C). Similar versatility in acceptor substrate recognition has also been reported for (Z,Z)-FPP synthase from Solanum habrochaites (15Chan Y.T. Ko T.P. Yao S.H. Chen Y.W. Lee C.C. Wang A.H. Crystal structure and potential head-to-middle condensation function of a Z,Z-farnesyl diphosphate synthase.ACS Omega. 2017; 2: 930-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although the crystal structures of the plant enzyme are known, the reason for such a “loose” substrate specificity remains obscure. In the present study, we solved the crystal structures of MM_0014. To understand the binding modes of different substrates, the enzyme crystals in the substrate-free and FPP-complex forms were soaked with either IPP or DMAPP, respectively. Some of the solved structures provided insight into the substrate preference for the versatile cPT. Interestingly, at least one structure revealed that the enzyme can catalyze an O-prenyltransfer reaction by the use of glycerol in the crystallization buffer as a prenyl acceptor substrate. Additional in vitro assays showed that the enzyme prenylates small alcohols, such as ethanol, 1-propanol, and 2-propanol, and also a water molecule as prenyl acceptors. These findings imply the role of the unique C-terminal structure of this enzyme on its specific substrate-binding mechanism. Recombinant MM_0014 fused with an N-terminal thioredoxin-polyhistidine tag was expressed in Escherichia coli cells and purified via affinity chromatography. After cleavage of the tag sequence, which should have given the N-terminal sequence starting from GPGYQMDIPKFK where the methionine residue is the putative first residue of native MM_0014, the enzyme was further purified using gel-filtration chromatography and then crystallized in its substrate-free form. The asymmetric unit of the crystal with a C2221 space group contained two protein molecules that comprised a homodimer, which is considered to be the typical biological unit for general cPTs (1Takahashi S.

In each subunit, a β-sheet was composed of parallel β7-β6-β1-β2-β5-β3 strands, and there was an antiparallel β4 strand that existed only in subunit A (Fig. 2B). The β-sheet was sandwiched by α-helices, and a narrow cavity was formed by α1, α2, α3, and α4 helices and β1, β2, and β5 strands. The overall structure of MM_0014 is in a ζ-fold (17Oldfield E. Lin F.Y. Terpene biosynthesis: Modularity rules.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

Because the density was thought to be derived from a fatty acid bound to the recombinant enzyme during the expression in the host E. coli cells, palmitic acid was placed provisionally as the ligand because it fit the density well. Although the C-terminus of subunit B was disordered, the C-terminal structure was resolved in subunit A. The C-terminus of subunit A extended toward the cavity of subunit B and covered its cavity opening, where the carboxyl group of the terminal Gly219 residue interacted with a carboxyl oxygen of the purported palmitic acid ligand. In contrast, the cavity of subunit A was in an open conformation because the C-terminus of subunit B was deemed operationally disordered.Figure 3Comparison of the ligand-binding cavities in complex structures of MM_0014.

When soaked with IPP overnight, an electron density consistent with an IPP molecule was observed in subunit A (Fig. 3C, Figs. S1 and S2), but not in subunit B where fatty acid was still bound. IPP was bound to the cavity opening of subunit A, which remained in an open conformation and bound an inorganic phosphate molecule. Superposition of the two subunits of the IPP-binding structure (designated as “free+IPP”) showed that a fatty acid ligand overlapped IPP and therefore might inhibit the binding of the substrate to subunit B (Fig. S3). It is also curious that no electron density derived from a Mg2+ ion was observed even though the crystallization buffer contained Mg2+. This might be because IPP was not precisely at the catalytically active position, as discussed later. In contrast, when soaked with DMAPP for 10 min, subunit A accommodated a pyrophosphate-Mg2+ complex (Fig. 3D and Fig. S1). Therefore, the crystal structure was designated as “free+PPi.” The binding site of the pyrophosphate molecule overlapped with that of the inorganic phosphate, not IPP, in the free+IPP structure. The electron density corresponding with the dimethylallyl moiety of DMAPP was sparse and barely visible, suggesting the possibility that MM_0014 rapidly hydrolyzed the allylic substrate with the aid of Mg2+, probably through Lewis-acid-assisted catalysis (Fig. S2). Based on these crystal structures, we presumed that, in MM_0014, the binding sites of the prenyl acceptor (IPP) and donors (allylic substrates) for the head-to-tail condensation (Fig. 1A) agree with those of previously studied cPTs (1Takahashi S. Koyama T. Structure and function of cis-prenyl chain elongating enzymes.Chem. Rec. 2006; 6: 194-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Teng K.H. Liang P.H. Structures, mechanisms and inhibitors of undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase: A cis-prenyltransferase for bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis.Bioorg. Chem. 2012; 43: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). With a final aim of obtaining the ternary complex structures of MM_0014 with prenyl donor and acceptor substrates, a cocrystallization of MM_0014 with FPP and Mg2+ was performed using a different crystallization buffer. The asymmetric unit of the P212121 space group contains eight protein molecules that form four homodimers (Fig. 4A). Each protein molecule possessed an electron density that penetrated the cavity more deeply than the fatty acid ligand did in the substrate-free structure (Fig. 4B and Fig. S1). The shape of the electron density, however, did not fit well with FPP, particularly at the pyrophosphate group. It is also noteworthy that inorganic phosphate was still bound at the supposed prenyl-donor binding site and that no electron density was derived from Mg2+ ion. These facts suggest that the ligand was actually a derivative of FPP. However, the electron density was obviously longer than farnesol (FOH), which can be produced from the hydrolysis of FPP. Thus, we speculated that the ligand was derived from the prenyltransfer reaction between FPP and glycerol because the crystallization buffer contained glycerol as a cryoprotectant. We constructed models of the possible products from the reaction, i.e., 1-O-farnesyl-sn-glycerol (FG), 2-O-FG, and 3-O-FG (Fig. 4C), and fitted them with the electron density (Fig. 4D). A 1:1:1 mixture of the models seemed to fit better than each model, suggesting that different O-prenylation products are formed and bound in MM_0014. The FG-complex crystals of MM_0014 (designated as “co-FG”) were soaked with DMAPP for 39 min to elucidate the binding mode of DMAPP at the prenyl acceptor-binding site, because the recognition of DMAPP as the prenyl acceptor substrate is required for the head-to-middle condensation. As a result, surprisingly, by replacing the FG ligand, two DMAPP molecules were found bound to four of the eight protein molecules in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 5A, Figs. S1 and S2). Therefore, the crystal structure was designated as “co-FG-DMAPP.” DMAPP molecules were accommodated in both the prenyl donor- and acceptor-binding sites, and a Mg2+ ion was coordinated between the pyrophosphate group of DMAPP at the donor-binding site and the α-phosphate of DMAPP at the acceptor-binding site (Fig. 5A, upper panels). These DMAPP-binding subunits were all in a closed conformation. In the other four protein molecules, FG and pyrophosphate were still bound in the donor-binding site, while a Mg2+ ion was coordinated between the pyrophosphate and α-phosphate of another pyrophosphate that was bound to the acceptor-binding site (Fig. 5A, lower panels). The DMAPP-binding protein molecule formed a dimer, either alone (one of four dimers in the asymmetric unit) or with an FG-binding protein molecule in an open conformation (two of four dimers). The remaining dimer consisted of two FG-binding protein molecules, while only one subunit held an inorganic phosphate at the acceptor-binding site in a closed conformation. The distance between the C1 of DMAPP at the donor-binding site and the C2 of DMAPP at the acceptor-binding site, which corresponded to the C-C bond-forming atoms in the head-to-middle condensation catalyzed by some cPT homologs, was 4.3 Å (Fig. 5B). This distance seems somewhat long, which could be why this structure could be solved without the complete processing of either a prenyltransfer or a hydrolysis reaction. The distance, however, could become somewhat shorter when the donor substrate is FPP, which yields geranyllavandulyl pyrophosphate from the reaction of MM_0014 with DMAPP. In addition, the fact that highly conserved asparagine and threonine residues (Asn66 and Thr63 in MM_0014), which are reported to be involved in proton elimination (18Malwal S.R. Gao J. Hu X.Y. Yang Y.Y. Liu W.D. Huang J.W. Ko T.P. Li L.P. Chen C.C. O'Dowd B. Khade R.L. Zhang Y. Zhang Y.H. Oldfield E. Guo R.T. Catalytic role of conserved asparagine, glutamine, serine, and tyrosine residues in isoprenoid biosynthesis enzymes.ACS Catal. 2018; 8: 4299-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), exist in close proximity to a methyl group of DMAPP at the acceptor-binding site agrees with the supposed position of proton elimination in the formation of geranyllavandulyl pyrophosphate (14Ogawa T. Emi K. Koga K. Yoshimura T. Hemmi H. A cis-prenyltransferase from Methanosarcina acetivorans catalyzes both head-to-tail and nonhead-to-tail prenyl condensation.FEBS J. 2016; 283: 2369-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Comparison of the DMAPP-binding and IPP-binding cavity structures provided insight into the substrate preference of MM_0014. Superposition of the structures showed that the C4 of IPP, which is the atom involved in the C-C bond formation in the head-to-tail condensation, nearly overlaps the C2 of DMAPP (Fig. 5B). The atom positions, however, are inconsistent with the substrate preference of MM_0014, where IPP is much more reactive than DMAPP as the prenyl acceptor (13Emi K.I. Sompiyachoke K. Okada M. Hemmi H. A heteromeric cis-prenyltransferase is responsible for the biosynthesis of glycosyl carrier lipids in Methanosarcina mazei.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2019; 520: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In fact, the position of IPP seems unsuitable for the reaction. Because of the absence of a Mg2+ ion, the pyrophosphate group of IPP is misaligned by ∼3 Å from that of DMAPP. If an allylic substrate binds to the donor-binding site, IPP is considered to move deeper into the cavity because its pyrophosphate group would be coordinated to Mg2+ along with the allylic substrate. With such a suitable binding position, the C4 of IPP must move closer to C1 of the allylic substrate, and the C2 of IPP, from which a proton would be eliminated, must exist near the conserved residues Asn66 and Thr63, which are probably involved in proton elimination (18Malwal S.R. Gao J. Hu X.Y. Yang Y.Y. Liu W.D. Huang J.W. Ko T.P. Li L.P. Chen C.C. O'Dowd B. Khade R.L. Zhang Y. Zhang Y.H. Oldfield E. Guo R.T. Catalytic role of conserved asparagine, glutamine, serine, and tyrosine residues in isoprenoid biosynthesis enzymes.ACS Catal. 2018; 8: 4299-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To confirm if the O-prenyltransfer reaction is catalyzed by MM_0014, 14C-labeled FPP was reacted with an excess amount of the enzyme in the absence and presence of 25% (v/v) glycerol. After reaction, nonpolar products were extracted n-pentane and then analyzed by reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography (TLC) (Fig. 6A). Even in the absence of glycerol, a radiolabeled spot (Rf = 0.67) comigrated with authentic FOH was detected, suggesting that MM_0014 can catalyze hydrolyzation of FPP. Along with the spot, another radiolabeled spot (Rf = 0.76) was detected only in the sample from the enzyme reaction with glycerol, which suggested that the spot was derived from FG. In contrast, no pentane-extractable products were detected when the enzyme was removed from the reaction. Next, nonlabeled FPP was reacted with the enzyme in the presence of 25% (v/v) glycerol, and the reaction products were analyzed via LC-ESI-MS following extraction with n-pentane (Fig. 6B). As a result, some UV peaks eluted at 3.6 to 5.0 min emerged only in the presence of MM_0014. The two UV peaks at 3.6 to 4.4 min were coeluted with a positive ion with m/z of 319, which correspond to FG-Na+ adduct ion (Fig. 6C), while any specific ions were not coeluted with the peak at ∼4.8 min. No ions obviously derived from FOH were detected under the conditions of the analysis. The separation of two peaks at 3.6 to 4.4 min was also observed in the extracted ion profile of m/z 319.4 ± 0.5 (Fig. 6D), which was unlikely the result of sample overloading because a diluted sample also gave two peaks. This suggested the production of the mixture of 1-O-FG, 2-O-FG, and 3-O-FG as expected from the structural study (Fig. 4D), because the enantiomeric 1-O-FG and 3-O-FG could not be separated under the conditions used for LC. The approximately 1:1 ratio of the peaks suggests that MM_0014 has a biased regio-specificity for O-prenylation, not having the same reactivity against all the hydroxy groups of glycerol. Instead of glycerol, small alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, and 2-propanol were also tested for use as the acceptor substrate for MM_0014 reactions to elucidate the versatility of the enzyme. LC-ESI-MS analyses of the products from the reaction with FPP and 10% (v/v) ethanol, 1-propanol, or 2-propanol gave extracted ion peaks with m/z values corresponding to those of farnesyl ethyl ether, farnesyl 1-propyl ether, and farnesyl 2-propyl ether, respectively, suggesting the occurrence of O-prenylation reaction toward the alcohols (Fig. 7). 2-Propanol was likely the most reactive among the tested substrates as judged from the ion intensities of the presumed ether products, given that their ionization efficiencies were similar. Methanol seemed not a good acceptor substrate because the formation of farnesyl methyl ether was undetectable. In the present study, we solved the substrate-free and substrate-bound crystal structures of a cPT from M. mazei, MM_0014. The co-FG+DMAPP structure revealed the binding mode of DMAPP as an acceptor substrate for irregular head-to-middle condensation. The observed conformations of the donor and acceptor substrates were basically similar to those in cPT homologs that specifically catalyze a head-to-middle condensation, such as lavandylyl pyrophosphate synthase, cyclolavandulyl pyrophosphate synthase, and isosesquilavandulyl pyrophosphate synthase (10Gao J.

However, the 4.3 Å distance between the C1 of DMAPP at the donor site and the C2 of DMAPP at the acceptor site in MM_0014 was significantly longer than the distances between the corresponding atoms in cyclolavandulyl pyrophosphate synthase (3.7 Å in 5YGK) and isosesquilavandulyl pyrophosphate synthase (3.9 Å in 5YGK) (Fig. S4). This difference in distance could be why MM_0014 cannot catalyze the head-to-middle condensation between two DMAPP molecules, while it can catalyze the head-to-tail condensation between DMAPP and IPP (13Emi K.I. Sompiyachoke K. Okada M. Hemmi H. A heteromeric cis-prenyltransferase is responsible for the biosynthesis of glycosyl carrier lipids in Methanosarcina mazei.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2019; 520: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Although the IPP-binding structure of MM_0014 (free+IPP) did not provide verifiable information about distance, we inferred the cause for the substrate specificity of MM_0014 toward IPP based on the DMAPP-binding structure, as described above. As far as we could ascertain, no cPT-family enzyme is known to catalyze O-prenylation. Even when including the hydrolysis of prenyl pyrophosphate, which can be regarded as the O-prenylation toward water, there are only two examples: tuberculosinol synthase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and kolavelool synthase from Herpetosiphon aurantiacus, which are terpene synthases specifically catalyzing the hydrolysis of the allylic pyrophosphate substrates (19Chan H.C.

Thus, it was surprising that MM_0014, which originally catalyzed C-prenylation on the alkenyl carbon of IPP, could accept simple molecules such as glycerol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, and also H2O as acceptor substrates for O-prenylation. Catalysis of both C- and O-prenylation of the same or similar substrates has been reported with some aromatic prenyltransferases (21Bai N. Li G.H. Luo S.L. Du L.C. Hu Q.Y. Xu H.K. Zhang K.Q.

The study was performed using eyeball morphometry, analysis of the bony orbit including its morphometry, macroscopic study, morphometry, histological examination of the eye tunics and chosen accessory organs of the eye and histochemical analysis. The orbit was funnel shaped and was open-type. There was a single ethmoid opening for the ethmoid nerve on the orbital lamina. The pupil was round, while the ciliary body occupied a relatively wide zone. The iris was brown and retina had a pigmented area. The cellular tapetum lucidum was semi-circular and milky and was composed of 14–17 layers of tapetal cells arranged in a bricklike structure. In the lower eyelid, there was a single conjunctival lymph nodule aggregate. One or two additional large conjunctval folds were observed within the posterior surface of the upper eyelids. The superficial gland of the third eyelid had a serous nature. The third eyelid was T-shaped and was composed of hyaline tissue. Two to three conjunctival lymph nodul aggregates were present within the bulbar conjunctiva of the third eyelid. The lacrimal gland produced a sero-mucous secretion. A detailed anatomic analysis of the eye area in the captive South African Painted Dogs females showed the similarities (especially in the histological examination of the eyetunics and orbital glands) as well as the differences between the Painted dog and the other representatives of Canidae . The differences included the shape and size od the orbita with comparison to the domestic dog. Such differences in the orbit measurements are most likely associated with the skull type, which are defined in relation to domestic dogs. The presented results significantly expand the existing knowledge on comparative anatomy in the orbit, eye and chosen accessory organs in wild Canidae ."

We have previously proposed that SK1 exists as both a monomer and dimer in equilibrium, although it is unclear whether these species translocate to the PM via the same or different mechanisms. We therefore investigated the structural determinants involved to better understand how translocation might potentially be targeted for therapeutic intervention. We report here that monomeric WT mouse SK1 (GFP-mSK1) translocates to the PM of MCF-7L cells stimulated with carbachol or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, whereas the dimer translocates to the PM in response to sphingosine-1-phosphate; thus, the equilibrium between the monomer and dimer is sensitive to cellular stimulus. In addition, carbachol and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced translocation of monomeric GFP-mSK1 to lamellipodia, whereas sphingosine-1-phosphate induced translocation of dimeric GFP-mSK1 to filopodia, suggesting that SK1 regulates different cell biological processes dependent on dimerization. GFP-mSK1 mutants designed to modulate dimerization confirmed this difference in localization. Regulation by the C-terminal tail of SK1 was investigated using GFP-mSK1 truncations. Removal of the last five amino acids (PPEEP) prevented translocation of the enzyme to the PM, whereas removal of the last ten amino acids restored translocation. This suggests that the penultimate five amino acids (SRRGP) function as a translocation brake, which can be released by sequestration of the PPEEP sequence.

Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid that is formed by the phosphorylation of sphingosine (Sph) by sphingosine kinase, of which there are two isoforms (sphingosine kinase 1 [SK1] and sphingosine kinase 2). SK1 and sphingosine kinase 2 are encoded by different genes and have distinct subcellular localization and biochemical properties (1Pyne S. Adams D.R. Pyne N.J. Sphingosine 1-phosphate and sphingosine kinases in health and disease: Recent advances.Prog. Lipid Res. 2016; 62: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). S1P is degraded by S1P lyase, to produce (E)-2-hexadecenal and phosphoethanolamine, and by S1P phosphatase, which dephosphorylates S1P to form Sph (1Pyne S. Adams D.R. Pyne N.J.

S1P is released from cells via specific transporters in the plasma membrane (PM) and then binds to and stimulates a family of G protein–coupled receptors, the S1P receptors (S1P1-S1P5), on cells or can act on intracellular targets, such as histone deacetylase 1/2, to induce cellular responses (1Pyne S.

Therefore, SK1 is a target for therapeutic intervention in cancer. Indeed, oncogenic transformation of NIH3T3 cells is induced by overexpression of SK1 (7Xia P. Gamble J.R. Wang L. Pitson S.M.

Biol. 2000; 10: 1527-1530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), and this involves its translocation from the cytoplasm to the PM, a process that allows access to the substrate (Sph). The importance of this process is evident from studies showing that the overexpression of a kinase-dead G82D hSK1 mutant fails to induce transformation, thereby demonstrating dependency on the catalytic activity of SK1 and therefore S1P (7Xia P.

A key step in the transformation process is the phosphorylation of SK1 by extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) on Ser225 in hSK1, which promotes translocation of the enzyme from the cytoplasm to the PM (8Pitson S.M.

The importance of this is underlined by the fact that the constitutive localization of SK1 to the PM promotes oncogenic transformation (9Pitson S.M. Xia P. Leclercq T.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R.

Moreover, studies have demonstrated that SK1 activation and localization to the PM and subsequent stimulation of the S1P2 receptor by released S1P (‘inside-out’ signaling) increase transferrin receptor 1 expression (10Pham D.H.

Dynamically regulated localization of SK1 to the PM is clearly important for the cellular function of the enzyme. Although the structural basis for this controlled targeting remains incompletely understood at present, the emergence of crystal structures for SK1 has begun to shed some light on the issue in recent years. The enzyme adopts a bidomain organization with a C-terminal domain (CTD) that hosts the lipid substrate binding site and an N-terminal domain (NTD) that binds ATP; the catalytic center is formed at the interface between these two domains (as reviewed (11Adams D.R. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Sphingosine kinases: Emerging structure-function insights.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2016; 41: 395-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)). Sph is bound within a J-shaped cavity (the ‘J-channel’), formed by packing of three extended lipid-binding loop structures against a β-sandwich core in the CTD. An exposed hydrophobic patch on the exterior of lipid-binding loop 1 (LBL-1) (L194/F197/L198 in human SK1 [hSK1]) has been shown to be a key determinant for membrane engagement, including curvature-sensitive binding (12Shen H.

The same hydrophobic patch on LBL-1 has also been implicated in the binding of SK1 to calcium- and integrin-binding protein, a calcium-sensing partner protein that is involved in the translocation of SK1 from the cytoplasm to the membrane (14Jarman K.E. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Pitson S.M. Translocation of sphingosine kinase 1 to the plasma membrane is mediated by calcium- and integrin-binding protein 1.J. Biol.

Acidic phospholipids also play a critical role in the membrane localization of SK1, notably phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidic acid (PA) (15Stahelin R.V. Hwang J.H. Kim J.H. Park Z.Y.

The interface was first identified by analysis of hSK1 crystal structures (11Adams D.R. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Sphingosine kinases: Emerging structure-function insights.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2016; 41: 395-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In all five of the currently available structures, the protein adopts a dimeric assembly (19Wang Z. Min X.

The mode of dimerization generates a pronounced groove at the dimer interface that is aligned parallel with the LBL-1 loops of the two protomers within the assembly. The grooved surface exhibits a pronounced positive electrostatic potential surface because of contributions from basic residues within the NTD and on the tip of LBL-1, and this is topographically coordinated with the LBL-1 hydrophobic patches to provide a suitable membrane-binding interface (11Adams D.R. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Sphingosine kinases: Emerging structure-function insights.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2016; 41: 395-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recent mutagenesis studies have validated the proposed membrane engagement surface and specifically identified K27, K29, and R186 in hSK1 as residues that are important for binding to PA-enriched target membranes (13Pulkoski-Gross M.J. Jenkins M.L. Truman J.P. Salama M.F. Clarke C.J. Burke J.E. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. An intrinsic lipid-binding interface controls sphingosine kinase 1 function.J. Lipid Res. 2018; 59: 462-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The Ser225 phosphorylation site for ERK in hSK1 (conserved in mouse SK1 [mSK1]) occupies a prominently solvent-exposed position within an extended regulatory loop (the ‘R-loop’) that packs on the reverse side of the CTD β-sandwich core to LBL-1 and is therefore on the opposite side of the protein to the membrane engagement surface. The mechanism underpinning translocation in response to phosphorylation at this site has not yet been elucidated. However, it may involve induced interdomain movement that affects the presentation of key basic residues in the NTD relative to LBL-1 in the CTD and thence whether the protein presents a topographically coordinated combination of surface elements or misaligned patches; R-loop phosphorylation might also impact on the capacity of SK1 to adopt a dimeric assembly in principle (11Adams D.R. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Sphingosine kinases: Emerging structure-function insights.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2016; 41: 395-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As an added complexity, there are additional drivers for translocation of SK1 to the PM that are independent of S225 phosphorylation in SK1. For example, Gq has been shown to promote translocation of mSK1 and hSK1 to the PM in HEK293 cells in a manner that is dependent on the generation of the activated Gαq subunit but independent of downstream [Ca2+]i elevation or phosphorylation by ERK (23ter Braak M. Danneberg K. Lichte K. Liphardt K. Ktistakis N.T. Pitson S.M. Hla T. Jakobs K.H. Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Galpha(q)-mediated plasma membrane translocation of sphingosine kinase-1 and cross-activation of S1P receptors.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The C-terminal tail of SK1 binds proteins, including tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (24Xia P. Wang L. Moretti P.A. Albanese N. Chai F. Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Sphingosine kinase interacts with TRAF2 and dissects tumor necrosis factor-alpha signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7996-8003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and protein phosphatase 2 (25Barr R.K. Lynn H.E. Moretti P.A. Khew-Goodall Y. Pitson S.M. Deactivation of sphingosine kinase 1 by protein phosphatase 2A.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34994-35002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have suggested that protein binding to the C-terminal tail might have an important role in regulating translocation of SK1 to the PM (11Adams D.R. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Sphingosine kinases: Emerging structure-function insights.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2016; 41: 395-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Indeed, truncation immediately preceding Gly364 in hSK1 to remove the C-terminal tail (21 residues) has been shown to promote constitutive activation and binding to PS-containing lipid raft microdomains (26Hengst J.A. Guilford J.M. Conroy E.J. Wang X. Yun J.K. Enhancement of sphingosine kinase 1 catalytic activity by deletion of 21 amino acids from the COOH-terminus.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 494: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) in a manner independent of ERK phosphorylation. The existence of both phosphorylation-dependent and phosphorylation-independent mechanisms for translocation of SK1 from the cytoplasm to the PM raises a question as to whether there is any mechanistic intersection between the differing modes of translocation at the level of protein structure. This might occur, for example, if the ERK phosphorylation destabilizes an autoinhibitory C-terminal folding so as to correctly present regions required for binding acidic phospholipids. This would represent a unified mechanism for membrane localization, promoted either by ERK phosphorylation or by alteration of the position of the C-terminal tail. We have therefore investigated the structural/functional properties of SK1 that facilitate its translocation from the cytoplasm to the PM of MCF-7L breast cancer cells using mSK1. This includes defining whether the monomeric or dimeric forms of SK1 localize to different microdomains in the PM, potentially to facilitate distinct aspects of the enzyme’s pleiotropic signaling functions, and defining the role of the C-terminal tail of SK1 in regulating translocation. Such studies inform on evolutionary conserved structural–functional properties of SK1 and enable identification of possible deregulated mechanisms controlling translocation of SK1 in preclinical murine disease models. Confirmation of the expression of WT GFP-mSK1 mutants was by Western blot analysis using the anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 1A). The treatment of MCF-7L cells with S1P (5 μM, 10 min), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (1 μM, 10 min), or carbachol (100 μM, 10 min) induced translocation of endogenous (detected with the anti-SK1 antibody) or WT GFP-mSK1 from the cytoplasm to the PM (Fig. 1A). Carbachol binds to M1- and Gq-coupled M3 muscarinic receptors in MCF-7 cells (27Fiszman G.L. Middonno M.C. de la Torre E. Farina M. Español A.J. Sales M.E.

Translocation of SK1 was quantified by measuring membrane immunoreactivity or GFP intensity at the PM as an area under the curve (AUC) as described in Experimental procedures. Both endogenous SK1 and WT GFP-mSK1 exhibited significant increases in the AUC at the PM after treatment with ligands (Fig. 1, B and C). Results were also quantified as the percentage of cells containing PM-associated SK1 as described in Experimental procedures. In WT GFP-mSK1 transiently overexpressing MCF-7L cells, there appeared to be very little SK1 associated with the PM, with the majority of SK1 localized in the cytoplasm and perinuclear region. Treatment of cells with S1P, PMA, or carbachol stimulated translocation of WT GFP-mSK1, such that there was an increase in the percentage of cells containing PM SK1 (Fig. 1, B and C). These responses were observed as a redistribution of SK1 from the cytoplasm/perinuclear regions to the PM. GFP-transfected cells stimulated with PMA, carbachol, or S1P did not show a redistribution of GFP (Fig. S1). To confirm the identity of the endogenous hSK1, MCF-7L cells were treated with SK1 siRNA, which reduced the intensity of the immunostaining of a 42-kDa protein detected on Western blot of cell lysates and decreased the immunofluorescence at the PM in response to ligand stimulation of the cells (Fig. 1D).Figure 1Effect of the MEK-1 inhibitor, PD98059, on the translocation of endogenous SK1 and WT GFP-mSK1 in MCF-7L cells.

https://openalex.org/W3156384351,"Background HIV-HCV coinfected individuals are often more deprived than the general population. However, deprivation is difficult to measure, often relying on aggregate data which does not capture individual heterogeneity. We developed an individual-level deprivation index for HIV-HCV co-infected persons that encapsulated social, material, and lifestyle factors. Methods We estimated an individual-level deprivation index with data from the Canadian Coinfection Cohort, a national prospective cohort study. We used a predetermined process to select 9 out of 19 dichotomous variables at baseline visit to include in the deprivation model: income &gt;$1500/month; education &gt;high school; employment; identifying as gay or bisexual; Indigenous status; injection drug use in last 6 months; injection drug use ever; past incarceration, and past psychiatric hospitalization. We fitted an item response theory model with: severity parameters (how likely an item was reported), discriminatory parameters, (how well a variable distinguished index levels), and an individual parameter (the index). We considered two models: a simple one with no provincial variation and a hierarchical model by province. The Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) was used to compare the fitted models. To showcase a potential utility of the proposed index, we evaluated with logistic regression the association of the index with non-attendance to a second clinic visit (as a proxy for disengagement) and using WAIC compared it to a model containing all the individual parameters that compose the index as covariates. Results We analyzed 1547 complete cases of 1842 enrolled participants. According to the WAIC the hierarchical model provided a better fit when compared to the model that does not consider the individual’s province. Values of the index were similarly distributed across the provinces. Overall, past incarceration, education, and unemployment had the highest discriminatory parameters. However, in each province different components of the index were associated with being deprived reflecting local epidemiology. For example, Saskatchewan had the highest severity parameter for Indigenous status while Quebec the lowest. For the secondary analysis, 457 (30%) failed to attend a second visit. A one-unit increase in the index was associated with 17% increased odds (95% credible interval, 2% to 34%) of not attending a second visit. The model with just the index performed better than the model with all the components as covariates in terms of WAIC. Conclusion We estimated an individual-level deprivation index in the Canadian Coinfection cohort. The index identified deprivation profiles across different provinces. This index and the methodology used may be useful in studying health and treatment outcomes that are influenced by social disparities in co-infected Canadians. The methodological approach described can be used in other studies with similar characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W3153802848,"Background and purpose The role of copy number variation (CNV) variation in stroke susceptibility and outcome has yet to be explored. The Copy Number Variation and Stroke (CaNVAS) Risk and Outcome study addresses this knowledge gap. Methods Over 24,500 well-phenotyped IS cases, including IS subtypes, and over 43,500 controls have been identified, all with readily available genotyping on GWAS and exome arrays, with case measures of stroke outcome. To evaluate CNV-associated stroke risk and stroke outcome it is planned to: 1) perform Risk Discovery using several analytic approaches to identify CNVs that are associated with the risk of IS and its subtypes, across the age-, sex- and ethnicity-spectrums; 2) perform Risk Replication and Extension to determine whether the identified stroke-associated CNVs replicate in other ethnically diverse datasets and use biomarker data (e.g. methylation, proteomic, RNA, miRNA, etc.) to evaluate how the identified CNVs exert their effects on stroke risk, and lastly; 3) perform outcome-based Replication and Extension analyses of recent findings demonstrating an inverse relationship between CNV burden and stroke outcome at 3 months (mRS), and then determine the key CNV drivers responsible for these associations using existing biomarker data. Results The results of an initial CNV evaluation of 50 samples from each participating dataset are presented demonstrating that the existing GWAS and exome chip data are excellent for the planned CNV analyses. Further, some samples will require additional considerations for analysis, however such samples can readily be identified, as demonstrated by a sample demonstrating clonal mosaicism. Conclusion The CaNVAS study will cost-effectively leverage the numerous advantages of using existing case-control data sets, exploring the relationships between CNV and IS and its subtypes, and outcome at 3 months, in both men and women, in those of African and European-Caucasian descent, this, across the entire adult-age spectrum."
https://openalex.org/W3154273048,"The U.S. Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative was announced in early 2019 and rapidly became a focal point for domestic HIV prevention and treatment programs. Using publicly available data from CDC, we examined historical trends in the average annual percent change (AAPC) in HIV diagnosis rates for the 57 EHE high incidence “hotspots” using Joinpoint analysis. We then assessed the ecologic association of various hotspot characteristics with changes in these rates over time using a multivariable regression model. From 2008–2017, the overall rate of newly diagnosed HIV cases in the U.S. declined from 19 to 14 per 100,000 persons, with the AAPC declining significantly in the U.S. overall (-3.1%; 95% CI: -3.7, -2.4) and in the 57 hotspots (-3.3%; 95% CI: -4.6, -2.8). There were large (AAPC &lt;-5.0), moderate (-5.0 to -2.5) and small (-2.5 to 0.0) rates of decline in 14, 19 and 17 hotspots respectively, with increasing trends (AAPC &gt;0.0) noted in seven hotspots. In the multivariable regression analysis, higher initial HIV diagnosis rate and location in the Northeast region were significantly associated with declining AAPC rates whereas no significant differences were found by hotspot gender, age, or race/ethnicity distribution. This analysis demonstrates that the rate of decline in HIV diagnosis rates in hotspots across the U.S. has been highly variable. Further exploration is warranted to assess the correlation between programmatic factors such as HIV testing and antiretroviral therapy and pre-exposure prophylaxis coverage with HIV trends across the hotspots."
https://openalex.org/W3155077564,"Urban mobility is a vital aspect of any city and often influences its physical shape as well as its level of economic and social development. A thorough analysis of mobility patterns in urban areas can provide various benefits, such as the prediction of traffic flow and public transportation usage. In particular, based on its exceptional ability to extract patterns from complex large-scale data, embedding based on deep learning is a promising method for analyzing the mobility patterns of urban residents. However, as urban mobility becomes increasingly complex, it becomes difficult to embed patterns into a single vector because of its limited capacity. In this paper, we propose a novel method for analyzing urban mobility based on deep learning. The proposed method involves clustering mobility patterns and embedding them to capture their implicit meaning. Clustering groups mobility patterns based on their spatiotemporal characteristics, and embedding provides meaningful information regarding both individual residents (i.e., personalized mobility) and all residents as a whole, enabling a more effective analysis of mobility patterns. Experiments were performed to predict the successive points of interest (POIs) based on transportation data collected from 1.5 million citizens in a large metropolitan city; the results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves top-1, 3, and 5 accuracies of 73.64%, 88.65%, and 91.54%, respectively, which are much higher than those of the conventional method (59.48%, 75.85%, and 80.1%, respectively). We also demonstrate that the proposed method facilitates the analysis of urban mobility through arithmetic operations between POI vectors."

Natural plant extracts have shown therapeutic potential in preventing oxidative stress and inflammation related to obesity complications. In this study, Senna alexandrina Mill. leaves were utilized to treat high-fat diet-related metabolic disorders and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases. Plasma biochemical assays were conducted to determine the lipid profiles and oxidative stress parameters, and the gene expression of antioxidant enzymes and inflammatory mediators was measured. Histological stained livers of high-fat diet-fed rats were observed. S . alexandrina leaf powder supplementation prevented the increase in cholesterol and triglyceride levels in high-fat diet-fed rats. Moreover, S . alexandrina leaves also reduced lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide production in these rats. Prevention of oxidative stress by S . alexandrina leaf supplementation in high-fat diet-fed rats is regulated by enhancing the antioxidant enzyme activity, followed by the restoration of corresponding gene expressions, such as NRF-2 , HO-1 , SOD , and CAT . Histological staining provides further evidence that S . alexandrina leaf supplementation prevents inflammatory cell infiltration, lipid droplet deposition, and fibrosis in the liver of high-fat diet-fed rats. Furthermore, this investigation revealed that S . alexandrina leaf supplementation controlled non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by modulating the expression of fat metabolizing enzymes in high-fat diet-fed rats.

SLIK is formed through C-terminal truncation of the Spt7 SAGA subunit, causing loss of Spt8, one of the subunits that interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP). SLIK and SAGA are both coactivators of RNA polymerase II transcription in yeast, and both SAGA and SLIK perform chromatin modifications. The two complexes have been speculated to uniquely contribute to transcriptional regulation, but their respective contributions are not clear. To investigate, we assayed the chromatin modifying functions of SAGA and SLIK, revealing identical kinetics on minimal substrates in vitro. We also examined the binding of SAGA and SLIK to TBP and concluded that interestingly, both protein complexes have similar affinity for TBP. Additionally, despite the loss of Spt8 and C-terminus of Spt7 in SLIK, TBP prebound to SLIK is not released in the presence of TATA-box DNA, just like TBP prebound to SAGA. Furthermore, we determined a low-resolution cryo-EM structure of SLIK, revealing a modular architecture identical to SAGA. Finally, we performed a comprehensive study of DNA-binding properties of both coactivators. Purified SAGA and SLIK both associate with ssDNA and dsDNA with high affinity (KD = 10–17 nM), and the binding is sequence-independent. In conclusion, our study shows that the cleavage of Spt7 and the absence of the Spt8 subunit in SLIK neither drive any major conformational differences in its structure compared with SAGA, nor significantly affect HAT, DUB, or DNA-binding activities in vitro.

SLIK (also named SALSA for “SAGA altered, Spt8 absent”) was discovered in 2002 in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (14Pray-Grant M.G. Schieltz D. Mcmahon S.J. Wood J.M. Kennedy E.L. Cook R.G.

In this isoform of SAGA, the 150 kDa subunit Spt7 is C-terminally truncated, resulting in loss of the 65 kDa Spt8 subunit—one of the two main TBP-interacting subunits. Stress conditions trigger passive diffusion of protease Pep4 into the nucleus (16Makio T. Wozniak R.W.

Cell Sci. 2020; 133jcs237156Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), where it cleaves the Spt7 C-terminus of SAGA, resulting in dissociation of Spt8 and formation of SLIK (17Spedale G.

In the recent cryo-EM structure of SAGA in complex with TBP, Papai et al. (18Papai G. Frechard A. Kolesnikova O. Crucifix C. Schultz P. Ben-Shem A. Structure of SAGA and mechanism of TBP deposition on gene promoters.Nature. 2020; 577: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) showed that the Spt3 and Spt8 subunits of SAGA cooperatively inhibit TBP binding to DNA, with Spt8 appearing to have a secondary role in adjusting the orientation of TBP. Earlier in vivo cross-linking studies revealed that the general transcription factor TFIIA competes with Spt8 for TBP binding (19Warfield L. Ranish J.A. Hahn S. Positive and negative functions of the SAGA complex mediated through interaction of Spt8 with TBP and the N-terminal domain of TFIIA.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1022-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Papai et al. (18Papai G. Frechard A. Kolesnikova O. Crucifix C. Schultz P. Ben-Shem A. Structure of SAGA and mechanism of TBP deposition on gene promoters.Nature. 2020; 577: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) therefore proposed that TFIIA displaces Spt8 from TBP and promotes TBP-DNA complex formation. In SLIK, the absence of Spt8 could result in a less repressive complex. This hypothesis would reconcile the seemingly conflicting data indicating that SAGA has both a positive and a negative role in expression of several genes (20Belotserkovskaya R. Sterner D.E. Deng M. Sayre M.H. Lieberman P.M. Berger S.L. Inhibition of TATA-binding protein function by SAGA subunits Spt3 and Spt8 at Gcn4-activated promoters.Mol. Cell.

Although high-resolution structures of the DUB module (22Samara N.L. Datta A.B. Berndsen C.E. Zhang X. Yao T. Cohen R.E. Wolberger C.

Paduch M. Kim S. Kramer R.M. Barrios A.F. Lu V. Luke J. Structural basis for activation of SAGA histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 by partner subunit Ada2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: 10010-10015Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) are available, both modules remain at lower resolution within the most recent complete SAGA complex structure, due to their inherent flexibility (18Papai G. Frechard A. Kolesnikova O. Crucifix C. Schultz P. Ben-Shem A.

Cramer P. Structure of the transcription coactivator SAGA.Nature. 2020; 577: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This limits the possibility to extrapolate the impacts of the loss of Spt8 and C-terminus of Spt7 from the structural information available, especially when considering that HAT module subunits Ada3 and catalytic Gcn5 both cross-link to Spt7 (26Han Y. Luo J. Ranish J. Hahn S. Architecture of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SAGA transcription coactivator complex.EMBO J. 2014; 33: 2534-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and that the DUB module is close to the C-terminus of Spt7 and Spt8 (18Papai G. Frechard A. Kolesnikova O. Crucifix C. Schultz P. Ben-Shem A. Structure of SAGA and mechanism of TBP deposition on gene promoters.Nature. 2020; 577: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Wang H. Dienemann C. Stützer A. Urlaub H. Cheung A.C.M. Cramer P. Structure of the transcription coactivator SAGA.Nature. 2020; 577: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Additionally, functional studies showed that the DUB module subunit Ubp8 affects the cleavage of Spt7 and may have a regulatory role in SLIK formation (27Hoke S.M.T. Liang G. Mutiu A.I. Genereaux J. Brandl C.J. C-terminal processing of yeast Spt7 occurs in the absence of functional SAGA complex.BMC Biochem. 2007; 8: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Whether the loss of Spt8 would reciprocally affect the DUB activity is unknown. Clarifying the respective contribution of SAGA and SLIK to transcription regulation is a prerequisite to interpret functional data such as genome-wide transcription analyses, which only see the sum of their individual contributions to gene expression. We therefore initiated a functional and structural study of SLIK, to elucidate how the absence of the C-terminus of Spt7 and loss of Spt8 impacts the complex. We solved a low-resolution cryo-EM structure of SLIK and compared it with currently available maps of SAGA, revealing a modular architecture identical to SAGA. We also used SAGA and SLIK complexes purified to high homogeneity to compare their DUB and HAT activities, which are identical on minimal substrate. Additionally, we compared binding of SAGA and SLIK to TBP and examined competition between SAGA/SLIK, TBP, and TATA-box DNA. We concluded that both complexes behave similarly in their interaction with TBP. It is well established that the SAGA family of transcriptional coactivators are recruited to gene promoters via interactions with DNA-binding activators (28Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. SAGA is an essential in vivo target of the yeast acidic activator Gal4p.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 29Ikeda K. Steger D.J. Eberharter A. Workman J.L.

Recently, Mittal et al. (32Mittal C. Culbertson S.J. Shogren-Knaak M.A. Distinct requirements of linker DNA and transcriptional activators in promoting SAGA-mediated nucleosome acetylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 13736-13749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) showed that the HAT activity in SAGA is sensitive to nucleosome-flanking DNA, hinting that SAGA might directly interact with flanking DNA. We therefore performed a comprehensive study of DNA-binding properties of both SAGA and SLIK coactivators. This established that both SAGA and SLIK bind DNA with high affinity in a sequence-independent manner. The overall structural arrangement, the chromatin-modifying function and the DNA-binding activity are unaffected by the cleavage of Spt7 C-terminus and loss of Spt8 in SAGA. Our data strongly suggest that SAGA and SLIK share the same fundamental functional and structural characteristics, and more gene-specific specific investigations would be required to reveal any distinct regulatory roles associated with their compositional differences. SAGA and SLIK were purified from S. cerevisiae cells, using a strain with a TAP-tag on Ubp8. Complexes were purified together from whole-cell extracts by affinity chromatography (IgG and Heparin) and subsequently separated during an ion exchange step, following the previously established protocol (14Pray-Grant M.G. Schieltz D. Mcmahon S.J. Wood J.M. Kennedy E.L. Cook R.G. Workman J.L. Yates III, J.R. Grant P.A. The novel SLIK histone acetyltransferase complex functions in the yeast retrograde response pathway.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8774-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Mass spectrometry analyses confirmed that all subunits were present. The Rtg2 protein, initially described to be associated with SLIK (14Pray-Grant M.G. Schieltz D. Mcmahon S.J. Wood J.M. Kennedy E.L. Cook R.G. Workman J.L. Yates III, J.R. Grant P.A. The novel SLIK histone acetyltransferase complex functions in the yeast retrograde response pathway.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8774-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), was not identified by mass spectrometry in neither purified SAGA nor SLIK complexes. Our SLIK complex has seemingly unaffected structural architecture and chromatin-modifying activities (see next sections), which contradicts the hypothesis that Rtg2 would be required for structural integrity of SLIK (14Pray-Grant M.G. Schieltz D. Mcmahon S.J. Wood J.M. Kennedy E.L. Cook R.G. Workman J.L. Yates III, J.R. Grant P.A. The novel SLIK histone acetyltransferase complex functions in the yeast retrograde response pathway.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8774-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We used cross-linking mass spectrometry to create and compare protein–protein cross-linking maps of SAGA and SLIK. We obtained 128/82 intramolecular and 70/59 intermolecular cross-linked peptides with an e-value below 0.01 for SAGA and SLIK, respectively (Tables S1–S3). These numbers are lower than in the exhaustive XL-MS analysis of SAGA by Han et al., (26Han Y. Luo J. Ranish J. Hahn S. Architecture of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SAGA transcription coactivator complex.EMBO J. 2014; 33: 2534-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) which included several repeats, and do not represent all the possible interactions; therefore the cross-linked peptides for SAGA and SLIK only partially overlap (58 intramolecular and 21 intermolecular cross-linked peptides are shared between SAGA and SLIK) (Fig. 2, Table S1). However, all SAGA and SLIK cross-linkers identified agree with the previously published SAGA complex structures (18Papai G. Frechard A. Kolesnikova O. Crucifix C. Schultz P. Ben-Shem A. Structure of SAGA and mechanism of TBP deposition on gene promoters.Nature. 2020; 577: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Wang H. Dienemann C. Stützer A. Urlaub H. Cheung A.C.M. Cramer P. Structure of the transcription coactivator SAGA.Nature. 2020; 577: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and cross-linking networks (26Han Y. Luo J. Ranish J. Hahn S. Architecture of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SAGA transcription coactivator complex.EMBO J. 2014; 33: 2534-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We conclude that the modules and subunits are similarly arranged in both complexes (Fig. 2). In both SAGA and SLIK, Tra1 cross-links to Taf12 and Ada1, in agreement with previous studies identifying Ada1 and Taf12 as Tra1 interacting partners forming a hinge region (26Han Y. Luo J. Ranish J. Hahn S. Architecture of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SAGA transcription coactivator complex.EMBO J. 2014; 33: 2534-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 33Sharov G. Voltz K. Durand A.

Commun. 2017; 8: 1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We can therefore conclude that the orientation of the hinge region is retained in SLIK. We compared the HAT activity of SAGA versus SLIK by measuring their respective initial acetylation rates at increasing concentrations of H3 peptide, in the presence of saturating amounts of acetyl-CoA, as previously described (34Ringel A.E. Cieniewicz A.M. Taverna S.D. Wolberger C. Nucleosome competition reveals processive acetylation by the SAGA HAT module.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: E5461-E5470Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Progress curves of SAGA or SLIK-catalyzed acetylation of H3 peptide were generated by coupling peptide acetylation with NADH formation. Velocity experiments were subsequently used to estimate the steady-state kinetic parameters. Initial rates were plotted as a function of the substrate concentration (Fig. 3A) and fit to the Michaelis–Menten equation. We concluded that kcat and KM values are indistinguishable for SAGA and SLIK (Table 1).Table 1Summary of steady-state kinetic parameters, nonlinear least square fitting to Michaelis–Menten equationProtein complexkcat (s−1)KM (μM)kcat/KM (μM−1.s−1)SAGA9.5 ± 1.5186 ± 1050.051 ± 0.014SLIK8.2 ± 1.6114 ± 1050.072 ± 0.015 Open table in a new tab Our results cannot be directly compared with any previously published studies, since none of them used the entire SAGA complex to measure HAT activity on minimal substrate. Ringel et al. (34Ringel A.E. Cieniewicz A.M. Taverna S.D. Wolberger C. Nucleosome competition reveals processive acetylation by the SAGA HAT module.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: E5461-E5470Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) used purified HAT module with H3 peptide substrate and obtained a kcat of 2.5 s−1 and a KM of 250 μM (with wild type HAT module and unmodified peptide). These values are similar to ours. Discrepancies may be due to the use of purified module versus full complex. We also used a slightly different experimental setup, including higher buffer osmolarity. Studies that used nucleosomal substrates typically report a much higher acetylation rate due to the increased affinity of SAGA to nucleosomes (32Mittal C. Culbertson S.J. Shogren-Knaak M.A. Distinct requirements of linker DNA and transcriptional activators in promoting SAGA-mediated nucleosome acetylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 13736-13749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We compared the DUB activity of SAGA and SLIK, using the minimal substrate ubiquitin-AMC (Ub-AMC) as previously described (35Samara N.L. Ringel A.E. Wolberger C. A role for intersubunit interactions in maintaining SAGA deubiquitinating module structure and activity.Structure. 2012; 20: 1414-1424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Progress curves of SAGA or SLIK-catalyzed hydrolysis of Ub-AMC were generated by monitoring the release of fluorescent dye AMC. Recorded fluorescence intensity signal was converted into the concentration of AMC and plotted as a function of time (Fig. 3B). Generated progress curves show that SAGA and SLIK exhibit the same level of activity. Subsequently, an estimation of the steady-state kinetic parameters was attempted from the initial velocity experiments. Initial rates were plotted as a function of the substrate concentration (Fig. 3B) and fit to the Michaelis–Menten equation. Accurate estimation of the kinetic parameters from collected data was not possible due to the technical limitations: the high KM observed (30–35 μM) in this experimental setup would require substrate concentrations far higher to the ones used here (20 μM maximum). These concentrations could not be used due to an increased aggregation of Ub-AMC above 30 μM, the high percentage of DMSO that would have resulted, as well as extended measurement times to produce complete substrate hydrolysis. However, our kinetic curves indicate that SAGA and SLIK hydrolyze Ub-AMC at the same rate (Fig. 3B). The KM that we observe is within the same range as reported by Samara et al. (35Samara N.L. Ringel A.E. Wolberger C. A role for intersubunit interactions in maintaining SAGA deubiquitinating module structure and activity.Structure. 2012; 20: 1414-1424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) using minimal substrate and purified DUB module, i.e., 24 μM. Notably, while Samara et al. were able to perform their experiment at 30 °C when using purified DUB module, our experiments were conducted at ambient temperature due to the limited stability of SAGA and SLIK at higher temperatures, thus slowing the reaction rate. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) confirmed that, as suggested by Mittal et al. (32Mittal C. Culbertson S.J. Shogren-Knaak M.A. Distinct requirements of linker DNA and transcriptional activators in promoting SAGA-mediated nucleosome acetylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 13736-13749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), purified SAGA binds to dsDNA (Fig. 4C). We therefore initiated a comprehensive study of DNA-binding properties of both SAGA and SLIK, using fluorescence polarization (FP) titrations (Fig. 5). We started to assess binding to DNA fragments that approximately match the size of SAGA and SLIK (27 nm long; top lobe 12–15 nm wide, Tra1 15–18 nm wide). To this end, we used fluorescently labeled 75-mer oligonucleotides that are 25 nm long (http://www.calctool.org/CALC/prof/bio/dna). The DNA sequence used corresponds to the HIS4 TATA-box containing promoter (see Supporting information). Both SAGA and SLIK bind to 75-mer dsDNA with high affinity (KD ∼ 10 nM) and 75-mer ssDNA of the same sequence with slightly lower affinity (KD ∼ 15–17 nM) (Fig. 5, A and B).Figure 5Characterization of SAGA and SLIK DNA-binding affinity. A, 75-mer dsDNA; KD(SAGA) = 10 ± 4 [nM], KD(SLIK) = 10 ± 4 [nM], B, 75-mer ssDNA; KD(SAGA) = 15 ± 11 [nM], KD(SLIK) = 17 ± 6 [nM], C, 20-mer TATA-less dsDNA; KD(SAGA) = 78 ± 32 [nM], KD(SLIK) = 15 ± 4 [nM], D, 20-mer TATA-box dsDNA; KD(SAGA) = 99 ± 50 [nM], KD(SLIK) = 21 ± 7 [nM], E, competition assay with Poly(dI:dC), F, competition assay with unlabeled 200-mer dsDNA corresponding to RPS5 TATA-less promoter. Individual data points are plotted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the binding was sequence-specific, we measured FP of labeled 75-mer dsDNA corresponding to the HIS4 TATA-box containing promoter with SAGA or SLIK, in the presence of increasing amounts of competitors Poly(deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic) acid (Poly(dI-dC)) (Fig. 5E), unlabeled 200-mer dsDNA corresponding to RPS5 TATA-less promoter (Fig. 5F), or unlabeled 75-mer of the same sequence (Fig. S1). FP was strongly reduced in all cases (decreased by 95% with ten times excess competitor), revealing that binding of both SAGA and SLIK to DNA is sequence-independent. To better characterize SAGA and SLIK binding to DNA, we assessed SAGA and SLIK binding to shorter DNA fragments (20-mer, i.e., approximately 7 nm in length). The sequence corre"
