https://openalex.org/W1498753987,"The H+-ATPase (F1F0) of Escherichia coli was purified from cells labeled with either [35S]sulfate or [U-14C-D] glucose, and the molar ratio of subunits in the complex determined. The molar ratio was calculated from the radioactivity incorporated into each subunit, using either the subunit sulfur content or subunit molecular weight. These labeling experiments confirm an alpha 3 beta 3 gamma 1 delta 1 epsilon 1 ratio of subunits in F1, and indicate a chi 1 psi 2 omega 10 ratio of subunits in F0. The chi, psi, and omega designations used here refer to the subunits of F0 in order of decreasing molecular weight. Staining with Coomassie brilliant blue gave a reliable indication of the molar ratio of subunits in F1, but very erroneous values for each of the subunits of F0. We attempted to estimate the ratio of subunits in the native membrane, since the stoichiometry determined for the purified complex could be an anomaly of purification. These estimates were made after labeling cells with [35S]sulfate during amplification of the ATPase genes carried on a lambda transducing phage. The subunit ratios in the native membrane were reasonably close to those obtained with purified F1F0. We conclude that the stoichiometry determined reflects the composition of F1F0 in the native membrane. The most surprising conclusion from this study is that there are 10 +/- 1 omega (proteolipid) subunits in each F1F0 complex. This is considerably more than had been assumed previously."
https://openalex.org/W1606568236,"Abstract Lysosomal enzymes contain 6-phosphomannosyl moieties which mediate their translocation to lysosomes. This recognition marker is synthesized by the sequential action of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase and alpha-N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphodiesterase. A new assay for the N-acetylglucosaminylphosphotransferase, using alpha-methylmannoside as acceptor, is presented. Using this assay, we partially purified the transferase and examined its substrate specificity. The transferase exhibited a very high affinity toward lysosomal enzymes (apparent Km values of less than 20 microM) and was greater than 100-fold more efficient (Vmax/Km) when using lysosomal enzymes as acceptors as compared to nonlysosomal glycoproteins that contain high mannose oligosaccharide units. Heat denaturation of the lysosomal enzymes resulted in the loss of acceptor activity. The model compounds alpha-methylmannoside and Man5--8GlcNAc were poor acceptors. We propose that this enzyme catalyzes the initial, determining step by which synthesized acid hydrolases are distinguished from other newly synthesized glycoproteins and thus are eventually targeted to lysosomes."

https://openalex.org/W1528576359,"The plasma membrane of Neurospora crassa contains a proton-translocating ATPase, which functions to generate a large membrane potential and thereby to drive a variety of H+-dependent co-transport systems. We have purified this ATPase by a three-step procedure in which 1) loosely bound membrane proteins are removed by treatment with 0.1% deoxycholate; 2) the ATPase is solubilized with 0.6% deoxycholate in the presence of 45% glycerol; and 3) the solubilized enzyme is purified by centrifugation through a glycerol gradient. This procedure typically yields approximately 30% of the starting ATPase activity in a nearly homogeneous enzyme preparation of high specific activity, 61-98 mumol/min/mg of protein. The membrane-bound and purified forms of the ATPase are very similar with respect to kinetic properties (pH optimum, nucleotide and divalent cation specificity, sigmoid dependence upon Mg-ATP concentration) and sensitivity to inhibitors (including N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and vanadate). Upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the purified ATPase displays a single major polypeptide band of Mr = 104,000, which is essentially identical in its electrophoretic mobility with the large subunit of [Na+, K+]-ATPase of animal cell membranes and [Ca2+]-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum. The structural similarity of the fungal and animal cell ATPases, together with the fact that both are known to form acyl phosphate intermediates, suggests that they may share a common reaction mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1492376891,"Fragments of rabbit skeletal muscle Ca2+-binding subunit of troponin (TnC), obtained by cleavage with trypsin, thrombin, and CNBr, were tested for their ability to form binary and ternary complexes with ATPase inhibitory subunit (TnI) and tropomyosin-binding subunit (TnT) and their ability to replace TnC in reversing TnI inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity. Three regions of TnC were found to be involved in interaction with TnI. Regions near Ca2+-binding sites II and III require Ca2+ for the interaction, while a third region near Ca2+-binding site IV binds TnI whether or not Ca2+ is present. The TnT binding site has been localized in the NH2-terminal half of TnC. Several of the TnC fragments form soluble ternary complexes with TnI and TnT. Fragments that contain amino acid residues 89-100 and at least one pair of Ca2+-binding sites are able to reverse the TnI inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity, which exhibits the same [Ca2+]1/2 regardless of which of the Ca2+-binding sites are present in the fragment."
https://openalex.org/W1511834042,"We have prepared monoclonal antibodies specific for cardiac myosin heavy chain. These antibodies were used for the separation and characterization of the molecular variants of myosin heavy chain present in the rabbit heart. Two molecular forms of myosin heavy chain, HC alpha and HC beta, were isolated from the euthyroid rabbit heart by affinity chromatography. Their reactivity with our antibodies indicated that the primary structures of HC alpha and HC beta differ in at least four and share at least two antigenic determinants. Differences in the primary structure of HC alpha and HC beta were confirmed by analysis of the peptides produced by limited chymotryptic digestion of the two heavy chains. Thirteen peptide differences were consistently found. The HC alpha and HC beta variants are shown by immunologic analysis and in chymotryptic peptide profiles to be identical with the predominant forms of myosin heavy chain synthesized in the hearts of hyperthyroid and adult euthyroid rabbits, respectively. During development and maturation of the euthyroid rabbit heart, HC alpha comprises approximately 50% of the ventricular myosin between birth and 4 weeks of age; it diminishes to 20-30% by 8 weeks and to 10-20% by 12 weeks of age. Cardiac myosin from a 1-year-old rabbit is composed almost entirely of HC beta. Cardiac myosin from embryonic animals at 20 days gestation contained 20% HC alpha. These results show that HC alpha occurs normally in the euthyroid rabbit heart and that the relative proportions of HC alpha and HC beta depend on both the developmental stage and the thyroid state of the animal."
https://openalex.org/W1589588327,"The effect of the DNA sequence of a template on the progress of DNA polymerase alpha was determined at the resolution of single nucleotides by using single-stranded, circular phi X174 DNA as a template and unique phi X 174 ONA fragments terminally labeled at their 3'-ends as primers. Therefore, the amount of radioactivity observed was always proportional to the number and not the length of nascent DNA chains. Extension of a primer by alpha-polymerase revealed that 3'-ends of nascent DNA chains accumulated at specific arrest sites consisting of GC-rich sequences of 1-8 bases distributed nonuniformly along the template with intervening sequences of 0-140 bases. The precise location and composition of these sites were determined by DNA sequencing methods, but a consensus sequence was not detected. However, the same pattern of arrest sites recognized by DNA polymerase alpha from CV-1 cells also arrested alpha-polymerase from HeLa cells, calf thymus tissue, and phage T4 DNA polymerase. An exception was DNA polymerase I from Escherichia coli which was insensitive to arrest signals. Analysis of recombinant DNA templates containing phi X174 DNA inserted into M13 DNA revealed that arrest sites were defined exclusively by those sequences within 24 bases upstream and 140 bases downstream of the arrest point; long range interactions between template sequences were not involved. One of the strongest arrest sites was located in the first two nucleotides at the base of the stem on the primer-proximal side of a stable hairpin structure, suggesting that such structures arrest the polymerase. However, only 28% of all arrest site nucleotides were found in this position; the rest were up to 25 bases upstream from any computer-predicted hairpin. Therefore, all arrest sites cannot be defined by secondary structure alone, although proximity to secondary structures may amplify normal variations in the rate of DNA elongation caused by primary sequences."

https://openalex.org/W2029952781,"The binding of [3H]spiperone, a dopamine receptor ligand, to striatal membranes was increased 30 to 35 percent in rats made diabetic with alloxan or streptozotocin. Binding of [3H]spiperone was normal in rats made diabetic with alloxan but treated with insulin. Thus the number of dopamine receptors and central dopaminergic transmission may be altered in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1590383264,"Purified CF1 (chloroplast coupling factor 1) synthesizes enzyme-bound ATP (CF1 less than ATP) from medium Pi. The reaction does not depend on medium ADP, indicating that the ADP substrate is tightly bound to CF1 (CF1 less than ADP). At saturating [Pi] and at the pH optimum of 6.0, a yield of 0.25 mol of ATP/mol of CF1 was obtained. The addition of hexokinase and glucose does not reduce the yield of CF1 less than ATP, showing that the ATP is never released from the enzyme. The addition of medium ATP, but not ADP, promotes the hydrolysis of CF1 less than ATP. The formation of CF1 less than ATP was analyzed in terms of a two-step reaction sequence in which Pi first binds to CF1 less than ADP which is then converted to CF1 less than ATP. Acid pH values were shown to increase the yield of CF1 less than ATP most significantly by promoting Pi binding. The equilibrium constant for the conversion of CF1 less than ADP . Pi to CF1 less than ATP was the same (0.4 at pH 6.0 and 7.0. The data suggest that acid pH values stimulate Pi binding by increasing the concentration of the H2PO4- species, which has been previously shown to be the form of phosphate that binds to beef heart F1 (33). These studies provide another example of an enzyme that dramatically lowers the free energy difference between enzyme-bound reactants and products compared to that of the same reaction occurring free in solution. The formation of CF1 less than ATP, if at the active site of photophosphorylation, means that protonmotive force does not directly promote the synthesis of the beta-gamma phosphoryl bond of ATP during energy-driven ATP synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1566325294,"The first step of the degradation of p-nitrophenyl-6-sulfo-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranoside and of keratan sulfate-derived oligosaccharides bearing N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate residues at the nonreducing end was considered to be accomplished by the action of a specific sulfatase (Kresse, H., Paschke, E., von Figura, K., Gilberg, W., and Fuchs W. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 6822-6826). In purification from human placenta, however, this activity co-chromatographed with isoenzyme A of beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase and had the same electrophoretic mobility as the latter enzyme. The activity was precipitated by a specific antiserum against beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase. A pronounced enzyme deficiency was found in Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff fibroblasts. The purified enzyme released p-nitrophenol from the chromogenic substrate as well as a second product which contained equimolar amounts of hexosamine and sulfate. This product had the same electrophoretic and chromatographic behavior as sulfated N-acetylglucosamine. It could be degraded by periodate to a smaller charged fragment. Incubation of keratan sulfate-derived oligosaccharides with beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase A analogously resulted in the liberation of N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate. The enzyme showed the highest affinity towards a trisulfated tetrasaccharide and exhibited a similar Km for the sulfated and the unsulfated p-nitrophenyl derivative."

https://openalex.org/W1824209837,"Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+-dependent ATP hydrolysis of fast skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) are strongly inhibited by trifluoperazine (TFP). Inhibition, which is Ca2+-dependent, is 90% with 14 microM TFP and 0.2 microM Ca2+. TFP interacts strongly, in a Ca2+-dependent way, with two SR proteins, calmodulin and the 53,000-dalton glycoprotein. The two proteins were purified by TFP affinity chromatography. The inhibition of SR activity by TFP was correlated with the interaction of the drug with the glycoprotein, rather than with calmodulin. The main effect was a shift of the (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase from a high to a low affinity form. Calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of three proteins (Mr = 57,000, 35,000, and 20,000) of the SR membrane of fast skeletal muscle was also demonstrated. Phosphorylation of these three proteins plays no role in the regulation of the active Ca2+-uptake reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1582623912,"The effects of urea and several methylamine solutes on the catalytic stability and aggregation properties of rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase were assessed at physiologically realistic concentrations of the solutes under several pH and temperature regimes. The loss of catalytic activity observed under conditions of pH-induced cold lability was significantly reduced in the presence of trimethylamine-N-oxide, N-trimethylglycine and N-methylglycine (order of decreasing effectiveness). The concentration-dependent methylamine stabilization of the enzyme, seen with as little as 50 mM trimethylamine-N-oxide, was accompanied by increased aggregation of the enzyme to molecular weights greater than the tetramer (polytetramer) as solute concentration was raised to 400 mM. At pH 6.5-6.7 and 25 degrees C, concentrations of urea greater than 25 mM promoted a time-dependent inactivation of the enzyme which was enhanced at lower temperatures. The urea sensitivity of the enzyme exhibited with 0.8 M urea for 1 h at pH 8.0 did not result in measurable inactivation. The fluorescence emission wavelength maximum of the enzyme was shifted to longer wavelengths and the fluorescence intensity was increased as pH was lowered to 7.0, suggesting the occurrence of a protein conformation change as specific amino acid residues of the tetramer became protonated. Measurements of enzyme light scattering indicated that perturbation by urea was correlated with tetramer dissociation, which was irreversible by dialysis at 25 degrees C. The urea and methylamine influences on phosphofructokinase activity and structure were not counteracting. The synergistic interactions among pH, temperature, and solutes observed with phosphofructokinase are compared to effects on other associating-dissociating protein systems in order to evaluate possible mechanisms of action of these low molecular weight solutes."
https://openalex.org/W1604372208,"Increasing data suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction may be an important early component of nephrotoxin-induced changes in renal cell function and viability. This study was designed to obtain more detailed information about the effects on several basic bioenergetic parameters of the direct interaction of Hg2+ with renal cortical mitochondria in vitro as a necessary prelude to studies of mitochondrial functional changes after treatment with mercuric chloride in vivo. Beginning at a threshold level of 2 nmol of Hg2+/mg of mitochondrial protein, Hg2+ induced marked stimulation of State 4 respiration, mild inhibition of State 3 respiration, and 2,4-dinitrophenol uncoupled respiration, a striking increase in atractyloside-insensitive ADP uptake and stimulation of both basal- and Mg2+-activated oligomycin-sensitive mitochondrial ATPase activity. These effects of Hg2+ could be prevented and reversed by the sulfhydryl reagent dithioerythritol and by albumin but were not affected by Mg2+. Detailed studies on the addition of HgCl2 to the preparation at different stages of the mitochondrial isolation procedure demonstrated that the presence of other proteins decreased mitochondrial Hg2+ binding, that the Hg2+ was not readily washed off the mitochondria by nonprotein-containing solutions, and that prolonged exposure of mitochondria to Hg2+ during the isolation procedure did not markedly alter its functional effects or their reversibility as assessed on the final mitochondrial preparation. These data provide an important basis for critically assessing the changes in function of mitochondria isolated after in vivo treatment with mercuric chloride."

https://openalex.org/W1584033181,"The electrogenic proton-translocating ATPase in the plasma membrane of Neurospora has been solubilized with lysolecithin and purified using a combination of gel filtration and density gradient centrifugation. Isolated plasma membrane vesicles are solubilized with lysolecithin in the presence of MgATP, vanadate, and chymostatin. The MgATP and vanadate are required to maintain the ATPase in an active form and the chymostatin prevents proteolytic degradation. Optimal solubilization of the H+-ATPase (approximately 70%) occurs at a lysolecithin/protein ratio of 3 (mg/mg). The lysolecithin extract is then passed through a Sepharose CL-6B column in the presence of lysolecithin, deoxycholate, MgATP, vanadate, dithiothreitol, and chymostatin. The bulk of the H+-ATPase activity elutes from this column as a relatively broad peak near the void volume. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel analysis of the column fractions indicates that the H+-ATPase present in the first half of this peak is substantially separated from all other membrane proteins whereas the H+-ATPase in the second half of the peak is still significantly contaminated. Isopycnic glycerol density gradient centrifugation of the pooled fractions from each half of the column peak results in further purification of the H+-ATPase. Gradient fractions containing the H+-ATPase from the first half of the column peak are virtually free of any other membrane proteins and those from the second half of the column peak are only slightly contaminated. The overall yield of the H+-ATPase is at least 24% based upon enzyme activity, and the specific activity is approximately 10 mumol of Pi liberated/mg of protein/min."

https://openalex.org/W1541461037,"Activation of the ATPase activity and the exposition of a new adenine nucleotide binding site of chloroplast coupling factor 1 (CF1) by dithioerythritol at 25 degrees C were reversed by oxidants. The ATPase activity elicited by heat (63 degrees C, 4 min) was slightly inhibited by oxidants and was partially additive with the activity induced by dithioerythritol. Titration of the thiols of CF1 and determination of their subunit distribution before and after activation by dithioerythritol show an increase of the free groups from 8 to 10 with the appearance of the 2 new thiols on the gamma subunit. These thiols were available to reagents in nondenatured enzyme and were reoxidized to a disulfide bond by iodosobenzoate or CuCl2. It is concluded that the mechanisms of CF1 activation by dithioerythritol and by heat are different and that the former involves a net reduction of a disulfide bond of the gamma subunit."
https://openalex.org/W4117022,"Calf thymus chromatin was fractionated by the Sanders' procedure ((1978) J. Cell Biol. 79, 97-109). this procedure involves sequential elutions of micrococcal nuclease-digested nuclei with buffers of increasing ionic strength. Through the use of the nuclei nick translation technique of Levitt et al. (Levitt, A., Axel, R., and Cedar, H. (1979) Dev. Biol. 69, 496-505) which specifically labels the transcriptionally competent regions of the chromosome, the lowest salt eluted, micrococcal nuclease-sensitive chromatin fraction, was found to be enriched in transcriptionally competent chromatin. This chromatin fraction contained approximately equimolar amounts of the core histones and low amounts of histone H1. In addition, this fraction was enriched both in the acetylated species of histone H4 and in the high mobility group (HMG) proteins 14 and 17, but it was depleted in 5-methylcytosine. As the ionic strength of the elution buffers increased, chromatin fractions from less micrococcal nuclease-sensitive chromatin domains were eluted. The nuclease-insensitive fractions were enriched in the unacetylated species of histone H4, 5-methylcytosine, and histone H1. Although these fractions had a smaller proportion of nucleosomes containing HMG-14 and HMG-17, they contained about 50% of the total HMG-14 and HMG-17 population."
https://openalex.org/W1577683846,"A method has been developed to isolate plasma membranes with high ATPase activity from wild type Neurospora. Cells are treated with snail enzyme to weaken their cell walls, disrupted by gentle homogenization in a medium designed to keep mitochondria and other organelles intact, and fractionated by differential centrifugation. After removal of mitochondria, several higher speed particulate fractions (particularly one sedimenting at 40,000 X g) contain an ATPase that can be identified as the plasma membrane enzyme on the basis of sensitivity to vanadate and kinetic properties. Its [S]0.5 for Mg.ATP, specificity for nucleotides and divalent cations, and pH optimum are virtually identical with those reported previously for plasma membrane ATPase from the slime mutant of Neurospora (Bowman, B. J., and Slayman, C. W. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 3357-3363). By contrast, ATPase specific activities in the wild type plasma membranes are much higher than in slime, ranging up to 7.3 mumol/min/mg of protein (the highest value yet reported for Neurospora). The best preparations appear homogeneous upon sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and band at an equilibrium density of 1.15 g/cm3. Two other markers, chitin synthetase and [acetyl-3H] concanavalin A binding, show approximate co-purification with the plasma membrane ATPase through membrane fractionation and sucrose gradient centrifugation."
https://openalex.org/W1483625847,"Limited labeling of amino groups with fluorescamine in fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles inhibits Ca2+-ATPase activity and Ca2+ transport. Under the labeling conditions used, 80% of the label reacts with phosphatidylethanolamine and 20% with the Ca2+-ATPase polypeptide. This degree of labeling does not result in vesicular disruption or in loss of vesicular proteins and does not increase the membrane permeability to Ca2+. Fluorescamine labeling of a purified Ca2+-ATPase devoid of aminophospholipids also inhibits Ca2+-ATPase activity, suggesting that labeling of lysine residues of the enzyme polypeptide is responsible for the inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase activity in sarcoplasmic reticulum. Fluorescamine labeling interferes with phosphoenzyme formation and decomposition in both the native vesicles and the purified enzyme; addition of ATP during labeling, and with less effectiveness ADP or AMP, protects both partial reaction steps. Addition of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog protects phosphoenzyme formation but not decomposition. The inhibition of Ca2+ transport but not of Ca2+-ATPase occurs in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles labeled in the presence of ATP, indicating that the transport reaction is uncoupled from the Ca2+-ATPase reaction. The inhibition of Ca2+ transport but not of Ca2+-ATPase activity is also found in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles in which only phosphatidylethanolamine has reacted with fluorescamine. Furthermore, the extent of labeling of phosphatidylethanolamine is correlated with the inhibition of Ca2+ transport rates. The inhibition of Ca2+ transport is a reflection of the inhibition of Ca2+ translocation and is not due to an increase in Ca2+ efflux. We propose that labeling of phosphatidylethanolamine perturbs the lipid environment around the enzyme, producing a specific defect in the Ca2+ translocation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1488050272,"We have developed an affinity chromatography procedure which measures binding of heparan sulfate species to agarose gels substituted with different heparan sulfates. Three major subfractions of bovine lung heparan sulfate (HS2, HS3, and HS4) which differ in sulfate content and hexuronate composition have been used. Association-prone variants of these species (HS2-A, HS3-A, and HS4-A) were prepared by gel chromatography. Free heparan sulfate chains were applied to columns of various heparan sulfate-agaroses which were eluted with a linear guanidine gradient and binding was assessed by measuring the hexuronate content of the effluent. Associating heparan sulfate of a particular subfraction was chiefly bound to gels that were substituted with chains of the same kind, i.e. HS2-A to HS2-A-agarose, HS3-A and HS4-A to HS3-A-agarose, and HS4-A to HS4-A-agarose. N-Desulfation and N-acetylation of HS2-A markedly reduced binding to HS2-A-agarose and periodate oxidation of glucuronate in HS3-A completely abolished binding to HS3-A-agarose. Partially oxidized HS2-A was separated into bound and unbound material by affinity chromatography on HS2-A-agarose. Gel chromatography of these fractions indicated that unbound chains were significantly smaller than bound ones. It is concluded that association between heparan sulfate chains may be quite specific and that the strength of binding is dependent on co-operative interactions between a number of contact zones. The latter may correspond to the N-sulfated and iduronate- and glucuronate-containing segments."
https://openalex.org/W1590453320,"The mitochondrial functional defects occurring in the early stages of nephrotoxic renal injury secondary to mercuric chloride have been characterized. No loss of cellular integrity or major mitochondrial structural alterations occurred within the first 3 h after a subcutaneous injection of 5 mg/kg of HgCl2. At 3 h, levels of Hg2+ in renal cortex and isolated renal cortical mitochondria were 1.87 and 0.72 nmol/mg of protein, respectively. Much evidence suggested that this Hg2+ had reached the mitochondria in situ and not during the isolation process. Mitochondria isolated beginning 1 h after treatment with HgCl2 showed depressed ADP uptake. At 2 h, inhibitions of State 3 and 2,4-dinitrophenol uncoupled respiration were detected. Inhibition of 2,4-dinitrophenol-activated mitochondrial ATPase activity was present when measured on mitochondria isolated at 3 h. These effects were not reversed by 2 mM dithioerythritol, 50 mg/ml of albumin or 5 mM MgCl2. Analysis of the data in the context of information available on the in vitro effects of HgCl2 (Weinberg, J. M., Harding, P. G., and Humes, H. D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 60-67) indicated that the mitochondrial functional effects could not be attributed to interaction of the mitochondria with Hg2+ during their isolation. These studies implicate compromised mitochondrial bioenergetic function as one of the earliest intracellular effects of Hg2+ in the production of nephrotoxicity but suggest that the intracellular process involves events in addition to those seen with direct exposure of mitochondria to Hg2+ in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1607423076,"The structure of the 21 S latent activity dynein-1 (LAD-1) particle has been investigated by limited proteolytic cleavage with trypsin and with chymotrypsin. The A alpha and A beta heavy polypeptide chains show different characteristic digestion patterns which remain essentially unchanged whether the chains are components of the 21 S LAD-1 particle or are in the form of separated fractions, although changes in their relative digestion rates upon separation suggest that the A beta chain in the 21 S particle is partially protected from digestion by the presence of the A alpha chain and intermediate chains 2 and 3. The progressive digestion of the A chains and intermediate chains causes an eventual dissociation of the 21 S particle to smaller particles sedimenting in the range 10 to 14 S. Within this broad peak, the fragments from the A alpha chain peak in the 10 to 12 S region, while those from the A beta chain peak in the 12 to 14 S region. Digestion of whole axonemes to a stage at which the A alpha chain is substantially digested but the A beta chain remains mostly intact, enables a large amount of 21 S dynein-1 to be solubilized by 3 mM MgATP2(-) in the presence of 0.1 M NaCl, pH 7.0. This indicates that the affinity of the 0.6 M NaCl-sensitive bond of the outer arm to the A-tubule is diminished substantially by the early stages of digestion of the A alpha chain."

Six of the first 16 residues of pro-C3 were identified by a microradiosequencing method. All six are nonpolar and are identical with the residues in beta chain of native plasma C3. This establishes beta chain as the NH2-terminal subunit in pro-C3. A comparison of primary structures of guinea pig and human C3 beta chains revealed identity of at least 8 residues within the NH2-terminal decapeptide. Incubation of plasmin with radiolabeled pro-C3 in macrophage lysate resulted in loss of pro-C3 and the generation of a two-chain molecule electrophoretically indistinguishable from native C3. These data indicate similarities between pro-C3 and the precursor of the fourth complement component, pro-C4, with respect to subunit organization, presence of phylogenetically conserved NH2-terminal regions, and the probable mechanism for generation of their respective native proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1560741647,"Regulated actin, F-actin plus troponin-tropomyosin, activates the myosin ATPase in the presence but not in the absence of calcium. Ultracentrifugation has been used to examine the interaction of regulated actin with two proteolytic fragments of myosin, heavy meromyosin (HMM), a two-headed species, and subfragment 1 (S-1), a single head. In the presence of ATP, the association constant (Ka) for the binding of S-1 to regulated actin is approximately 1.5 X 10(4) M-1, whether or not calcium is present. This is true for S-1 with and without the Mr = 19,000 phosphorylatable light chain. These results confirm the observations of Chalovich et al. (Chalovich, J., Chock, P. B., and Eisenberg, E. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 575-578) and support their suggestion that the inhibition of the regulated actin-activated ATPase of S-1 by removal of calcium does not result from preventing S-1 binding. The binding of HMM to regulated actin in the presence of ATP, however, is calcium sensitive. Removal of calcium results in approximately a 4-fold decrease in Ka, from 1.1 X 10(4) M-1 to 2.5 X 10(3) M-1. The results with HMM are more easily reconciled with the low stiffness of relaxed muscle and suggest a functional difference between S-1 and HMM."
https://openalex.org/W1571366008,"Abstract When is extracted from nuclease-digested nuclei by stepwise salt elution, two different classes of newly replicated can be distinguished. Nascent DNA eluted from nuclei under conditions of low to moderate ionic strength (0.1-0.3 M NaCl) exhibits nucleosomal periodicity and is found in particles which have the same electrophoretic mobility as bona fide H1- or high mobility group protein-containing mononucleosomes. Thus, factors believed to be involved with both the higher order coiling and transcriptionally active state of are rapidly complexed with newly synthesized DNA and may be retained on parental nucleosomes throughout replication. In contrast, approximately 40% of new DNA is resistant to extraction with solutions of moderate ionic strength. Most of this material is eluted from nuclei by 0.4-0.6 M NaCl. While bulk that is extracted by 0.4-0.6 M NaCl is organized into nucleosomes, most of the newly replicated chromatin from the same fractions lacks subunit structure, as determined by DNA size analyses in polyacrylamide gels, thereby distinguishing this nascent material from newly replicated eluted at lower ionic strength. Within 15 min all newly synthesized matures and exhibits the solubility and nucleosomal periodicity characteristics of bulk chromatin. The unusual properties of the nonnucleosomal fractions may reflect the structure of newly synthesized DNA prior to its assembly into nucleosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1533843471,"Binding of 21 S dynein ATPase isolated from Tetrahymena cilia to B subfibers of microtubule doublets was used as a model system to study dynein-tubulin interactions and their relationship to the microtubule-based sliding filament mechanism. Binding of 21 S dynein to both A and B microtubule subfibers is supported by monovalent as well as divalent ions. Monovalent cation chlorides support dynein binding to B subfibers with the specificity Li greater than Na congruent to K congruent to Rb congruent to Cs congruent to choline. The corresponding sodium or potassium halides follow the order F greater than Cl greater than Br greater than I. However, an optimal binding concentration of 40 mM KCl supports only 55% of the protein binding which takes place in 3 mM MgSO4 and does not stabilize dynein cross-bridges when whole axonemes are fixed for electron microscopy. Divalent metal ion chlorides (MgCl2, CaCl2, SrCl2, and BaCl2) have nearly equivalent effects at a concentration of 6 mM; all support about 140% of the binding observed in 6 mM MgSO4. The binding data suggest negative cooperativity or the presence of more than one class of dynein binding sites on the microtubule lattice. Low concentrations of MgATP2- induce dissociation of dynein bound to B subfibers in either 6 mM MgSO4 or 40 mM KCl. ADP, Pi, PPi, and AMP-PCH2P are unable to induce dynein dissociation, while AMP-PNHP and ATP4- both cause dynein release from B subfiber sites. The half-maximal sensitivities of the tubulin-dynein complex to MgATP2-, ATP4-, and adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP.PNP) are 1.3 X 10(-8) M, 3.6 X 10(-5) M, and 4.7 X 10(-4) M respectively. Incubation of doublets or 21 S dynein in N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), which can inhibit active sliding, has no effect on either association of dynein with the B subfiber or on dissociation of the resulting dynein-B subfiber complex by MgATP2-."
https://openalex.org/W1484477950,"The calcium ion dependence of calcium transport by isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles from rabbit skeletal muscle has been investigated by means of the Calcium-stat method, in which transport may be measured in the micromolar free calcium ion concentration range, in the absence of calcium buffers. At pH 7.2 and 20 degrees C, ATP, in the range 1 to 10 mM, decreased [Ca2+]0.5 from 2.0 microM to 0.3 microM and decreased Vmax of oxalate-supported transport from 0.5 to 1.3 mumol min-1 mg-1. Simultaneous measurements of transport and of ATPase activity in the range 0.8 to 10 microM free Ca2+ showed a ratio of 2.1 calcium ions translocated/molecule of ATP hydrolyzed. Transport, in the presence of 5 mM ATP, ceased when calcium ion concentration fell to 0.6 to 1.2 microM, whilst ATPase activity of 90 nmol of ATP hydrolyzed min-1 mg-1 persisted. The data obtained by the Calcium-stat method differed from those described previously using calcium buffers, in that they showed lower apparent affinities of the transport site for calcium ions, more marked sigmoidal behavior, an effect of ATP concentration on Ca2+ concentration dependence and lower ATPase activity in the absence of transport. The calcium complex of ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (CaEGTA) had no effect when transport was stimulated maximally at saturating free Ca2+ concentrations. However, at calcium ion levels below [Ca2+]0.5, 70 microM CaEGTA stimulated transport to rates of 20 to 45% of Vmax. Half-maximal stimulation of transport occurred at 19 microM CaEGTA. CaEGTA, 50 microM, decreased [Ca2+]0.5, determined at 5 mM ATP, from 1.3 microM to 0.45 microM. It is proposed that a ternary complex, E . Ca2+ . EGTA4-, is formed as an intermediate species during CaEGTA-stimulated calcium transport by sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes and stimulates the calcium pump at limiting free Ca2+ ion concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2082418131,"A cell-cell hybrid of a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line and human peripheral blood lymphoblasts from a patient with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia produces a surface antigen detectable by a monoclonal antibody. This surface antigen can be detected at significant levels on a fraction of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, but not on normal human lymphocytes from peripheral blood or bone marrow. Two different clones capable of transforming mouse cells to produce the surface antigen were isolated from a gene library of the hybrid cell by identification of small portions of the library containing functional genes, followed by detection of clones with human-specific reiterated sequences. Both clones also contain CHO-specific reiterated sequences and are therefore human-CHO recombinants. From the frequency of antigen-producing clones in the library, we estimate that they were present in the hybrid cell genome at a copy number of 100 to 1000."
https://openalex.org/W2051180152,"Laser Raman spectroscopy has been used to examine the conformations of the protein and phospholipid components of sarcoplasmic reticulum from rabbit white skeletal muscle. The phospholipid component is shown to have the conformation of fluid, liquid-crystalline lipids, even at 10 degrees C, and no breaks in the lipid conformation are observed in the range of 10-37 degrees C. Protein (predominantly the Ca2+-dependent ATPase) conformation is shown to contain very little beta-sheet structure under all conditions. Absolute content of alpha-helix and random coil or beta-turn could not be determined because of interference in the amide I and III regions. However, the Ca2+-ATPase in sarcoplasmic reticulum appears to undergo a conformational change at 15-18 degrees C which involves removal of a portion of the tryptophan residues from an aqueous environment and an increase in alpha-helical content. This conformation change coincides with a change in slope of Arrhenius plots of ATP hydrolysis activity. Increasing concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ appear to slightly decrease the alpha-helical content of sarcoplasmic reticulum protein."
https://openalex.org/W1484526482,"Yeast beta-(1 goes to 3)glucan synthetase is stimulated by ATP or GTP. The structural requirements for the activation were investigated by testing several phosphorylated compounds. The simplest substance with stimulatory ability was inorganic pyrophosphate. Addition of a nucleoside, as in GDP, decreased the concentration required for half-maximal stimulation; a third phosphate group, as in GTP, further enhanced the stimulatory capacity. On the other hand, esterification of the terminal phosphate of GTP with a nucleoside or a methyl group led to a total loss of activating ability: dinucleoside triphosphates and the gamma-phosphate methyl ester of GTP acted as competitive antagonists of the activators. alpha,beta- and beta,gamma-imino and -methylene derivatives of both ATP and GTP stimulated the enzymatic activity, suggesting that activation can occur without covalent transfer either of the terminal phosphate or pyrophosphate, or of the nucleotidyl residue. The stimulatory effect of the beta,gamma-imino derivatives of ATP and GTP was not additive. The inhibition constants obtained with gamma-phosphate esters of GTP were the same for either one of the two imino analogs. It is concluded that adenosine and guanosine derivatives bind to the same domain of the enzyme. It is also postulated that activators may interact with the enzyme or with a regulatory protein at two locations, a binding site for the nucleoside moiety and a functional site for the pyrophosphate residue."

https://openalex.org/W1550663680,"The effect of platelet tropomyosin on the ATPase activity of a muscle actin-myosin subfragment 1 system has been examined in 30 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 0.1 mM EGTA, 2 mM Tris, pH 7.8. Whereas muscle tropomyosin inhibits the activity by 60%, the platelet protein had no effect. Addition of muscle troponin in the absence of Ca2+ to the system inhibited the activity by up to 80% irrespective of whether muscle or platelet tropomyosin was used. The release of this inhibition by the addition of Ca2+ was much less in the case of platelet tropomyosin. This may result from the fact that platelet tropomyosin aggregates poorly in a head-to-tail manner and interacts only weakly with muscle troponin-T. In the presence of troponin-I and platelet tropomyosin, inhibition of the ATPase activity was 80%. This inhibition was largely released by the addition of troponin-C irrespective of the presence of Ca2+. The addition of brain calmodulin, however, released the inhibition in the presence of calcium but not in its absence. These effects can be correlated with the binding or lack of binding of the platelet tropomyosin to the actin filament."
https://openalex.org/W1565440817,"We have recently reported the isolation from rabbit alveolar macrophages of a receptor which retained its ligand-binding activity for the third component of complement (C3) and for its major proteolytic derived activation fragment (C3b). The isolated receptor demonstrated a greater ability to bind C3b than an equimolar amount of C3. C3b differs from C3 in at least two ways: it is a proteolytic cleavage product of C3 and it lacks the internal thiolester bond of C3. We have analyzed the binding ability to isolated receptor to various C3 and C3b analogs and we demonstrate that the specificity of the C3b-C3b receptor interaction depends upon the lysis of the C3 thiolester bond and accompanying conformational change rather than upon proteolytic cleavage of the C3 molecule. Minimal, if any, binding of C3 with an intact thiolester bond to the isolated receptor was demonstrable."
https://openalex.org/W1528390424,"The product of the N gene of bacteriophage lambda prevents the termination of lambda early transcription. Here we describe the physical properties of pure lambda N protein. N protein is small and very basic. The apparent Mr of N protein during electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate is 12,500. It contains 22 mol % (arginine plus lysine) and only one methionine. The methionine residue is at the blocked NH2 terminal since N protein is not detectably shortened by reaction with cyanogen bromide. When use is made of the DNA sequence of the N gene region of lambda DNA (Franklin, N. C., and Bennett, G. N. (1979) Gene 8, 107-119), the lack of an internal methionine residue, the size, and the amino acid composition of N protein can be used to predict that N protein contains 107 amino acids (calculated Mr = 12,241) and that its coding sequence begins at position 223 of the lambda pL operon mRNA. N protein can be assayed by its ability to stimulate endolysin synthesis in vitro in a reaction programmed with lambda N- DNA. N protein activity is heat-stable and trypsin-sensitive. Its sedimentation velocity in a sucrose gradient and its Stokes' radius indicate that N protein is an extremely asymmetric monomer (f/fmin = 1.6). The relationship between this high degree of molecular asymmetry and the sequence which N protein must recognize in lambda nucleic acid is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1530062966,"Vanadate inhibited the formation of proton gradient and membrane potential as well as Ca2+ transport by everted membrane vesicles from Mycobacterium phlei, with half-maximal inhibition occurring at 5 to 14 microM. That this is due to the inhibition of the proton-translocating ATPase was suggested by the observation that the inhibition described above occurred only when the processes were driven by the hydrolysis of ATP but not when energized by the oxidation of succinate and NADH. Furthermore, vanadate did indeed inhibit ATP hydrolysis by these membrane vesicles. Although the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis could be demonstrated only in the presence of high concentrations (e.g. 11 mM) of Mg2+, this was presumably due to the fact that we were measuring the sum of ATP hydrolysis by both coupled and partially uncoupled enzymes. This is the first reported effect of vanadate on bacterial proton-translocating ATPase."

https://openalex.org/W1567055574,"This laboratory has carried out the first detailed studies of the active polymeric forms of phosphofructokinases over the concentration region of 1 to 1200 micrograms/ml. This includes the concentration range in which the enzymes exist in vivo and the concentration range in which their association-dissociation equilibria shift to yield various polymeric forms. Previously, active enzyme centrifugation experiments were limited to the concentration range below a few micrograms per ml. The present experiments were made possible by the recent development in this laboratory of a new technique called high concentration active enzyme centrifugation (Wei, G. J., and Deal, W. C., Jr. (1979) Biochemistry 18, 1129). We report here three new active polymeric forms of pig kidney phosphofructokinase which have been observed in high concentration active enzyme centrifugation experiments. These include: 1) a 9.8 S form (Mr = 2.6 X 10(5)); 2) a 25 S form (Mr = 1.01 X 10(6)); and 3) a 53 S form (too asymmetric to estimate Mr). In addition, a 5.4 S form is predicted from the Mr (8.8 X 10(4)) of the polypeptide chain obtained from sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis; it is not known whether or not it is active. The 9.8 S value is the limiting sedimentation coefficient value observed in active enzyme centrifugation experiments. The 25 S form is indicated by a plateau in the 50 to 200 micrograms/ml region of the s versus c curve. The 53 S form is observed as a plateau in the 600 to 1000 micrograms/ml region of the s versus c curve."
