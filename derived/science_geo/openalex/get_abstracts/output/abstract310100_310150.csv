https://openalex.org/W2022311808,"The milk of Zalophus californianus is similar to that of other marine mammals. The chief protein of the milk is casein, which has a lower phosphorus content than bovine casein. There appears to be a complete absence of lactose, and it is believed that this is the first unequivocal demonstration of the absence of lactose from the milk of any mammal."

The spherules consist mainly of kamacite with unidentified pink inclusions. The meteoritic origin of these spherules seems reasonable, suggesting that the tektites containing them were formed by asteroidal or meteoritic impact."
https://openalex.org/W2004472952,Illumination of Chromatium with light absorbed by bacteriochlorophyll causes the oxidation of intracellular cytochrome. The quantum efficiency of this reaction approaches one electron per photon at 589 millimicrons and at wavelengths between 862 and 908 millimicrons. The efficiency of converting excitation energy to chemical energy is estimated to be about 30 percent.

If this depletion is explained in terms of a late accretion of volatile materials from a solar nebula with falling temperature, then the conclusion can be drawn that the moon accumulated not in earth orbit but as a separate planet, and that it was later captured by the earth."
https://openalex.org/W1981105372,"Basalts heated strongly with focused infrared laser radiation vaporized and splattered. Electron microprobe analyses of condensate, ejecta, and residue show strong vapor fractionation trends which, for some elements, are different from what would be expected theoretically and from previously reported data on more siliceous materials. It appears that solution effects can account for these differences. Heating of materials by a powerful focused laser beam for the purpose of study of vapor fractionation is a convenient technique that is more versatile than previous methods such as heating in solar or arc image furnaces."

https://openalex.org/W1972473463,Increase of the blood sugar which invariably follows administration of cortico-adrenal extract to adrenalectomized cats with symptoms of insufficiency is a reliable index of potency and affords a means of bio-assay of the material.
https://openalex.org/W2035887812,"Bathythermograms recorded off Newport, Oregon, show marked positive gradients during the period of cessation of summer upwelling. It is suggested that these are related to the formation of a shear zone or ""front"" between oceanic water and shelf water that has been exposed to the surface and modified."
