https://openalex.org/W2024516442,"Although normothermic machine perfusion of donor livers may allow assessment of graft viability prior to transplantation, there are currently no data on what would be a good parameter of graft viability. To determine whether bile production is a suitable biomarker that can be used to discriminate viable from non-viable livers we have studied functional performance as well as biochemical and histological evidence of hepatobiliary injury during ex vivo normothermic machine perfusion of human donor livers. After a median duration of cold storage of 6.5 h, twelve extended criteria human donor livers that were declined for transplantation were ex vivo perfused for 6 h at 37°C with an oxygenated solution based on red blood cells and plasma, using pressure controlled pulsatile perfusion of the hepatic artery and continuous portal perfusion. During perfusion, two patterns of bile flow were identified: (1) steadily increasing bile production, resulting in a cumulative output of ≥30 g after 6 h (high bile output group), and (2) a cumulative bile production <20 g in 6 h (low bile output group). Concentrations of transaminases and potassium in the perfusion fluid were significantly higher in the low bile output group, compared to the high bile output group. Biliary concentrations of bilirubin and bicarbonate were respectively 4 times and 2 times higher in the high bile output group. Livers in the low bile output group displayed more signs of hepatic necrosis and venous congestion, compared to the high bile output group. In conclusion, bile production could be an easily assessable biomarker of hepatic viability during ex vivo machine perfusion of human donor livers. It could potentially be used to identify extended criteria livers that are suitable for transplantation. These ex vivo findings need to be confirmed in a transplant experiment or a clinical trial."
https://openalex.org/W2042921915,"Ascl2, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is a downstream target of WNT signaling that controls the fate of intestinal cryptic stem cells and colon cancer progenitor cells. However, its involvement in colon cancer and downstream molecular events is largely undefined; in particular, the mechanism by which Ascl2 regulates the plasticity of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) programs in colon cancer cells remains unknown. In this study, we systematically demonstrate that Ascl2 loss of function in colon cancer cells promotes MET by derepressing the expression of microRNA (miR)-200s (i.e. miR-200b, miR-200a, miR-429, miR-200c, and miR-141) and further activating their expression through a transcriptional mechanism that involves direct binding to the most proximal E-box (E-box2) in the miR-200b-a-429 promoter. Activation of miR-200s due to Ascl2 deficiency led to the inhibition of ZEB1/2 expression and the alteration of epithelial and mesenchymal features. Transfection of miR-200b, miR-200a, and miR-429 inhibitors into Ascl2-deficient colon cancer cells promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in a reversible manner. Transfection of miR-200a or miR-429 inhibitors into Ascl2-deficient colon cancer cells increased cellular proliferation and migration. Ascl2 mRNA levels and the miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141, or miR-429 levels in the colon cancerous samples were inversely correlated.

https://openalex.org/W2016497824,"Here we present a metabolic profiling strategy employing direct infusion Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for the monitoring of soybean's (Glycine max L.) global metabolism regulation in response to Rhizoctonia solani infection in a time-course. Key elements in the approach are the construction of a comprehensive metabolite library for soybean, which accelerates the steps of metabolite identification and biological interpretation of results, and bioinformatics tools for the visualization and analysis of its metabolome. The study of metabolic networks revealed that infection results in the mobilization of carbohydrates, disturbance of the amino acid pool, and activation of isoflavonoid, α-linolenate, and phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathways of the plant. Components of these pathways include phytoalexins, coumarins, flavonoids, signaling molecules, and hormones, many of which exhibit antioxidant properties and bioactivity helping the plant to counterattack the pathogen's invasion. Unraveling the biochemical mechanism operating during soybean-Rhizoctonia interaction, in addition to its significance towards the understanding of the plant's metabolism regulation under biotic stress, provides valuable insights with potential for applications in biotechnology, crop breeding, and agrochemical and food industries."
https://openalex.org/W2047787307,"Objective To assess the availability and affordability of medicines and routine tests for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes in the West region of Cameroon, a low-income setting. Methods A survey was conducted on the availability and cost of twelve routine tests and twenty medicines for CVD and diabetes in eight health districts (four urban and four rural) covering over 60% of the population of the region (1.8 million). We analyzed the percentage of tests and medicines available, the median price against the international reference price (median price ratio) for the medicines, and affordability in terms of the number of days’ wages it would cost the lowest-paid unskilled government worker for initial investigation tests and procurement for one month of treatment. Results The availability of tests varied between 10% for the ECG to 100% for the fasting blood sugar. The average cost for the initial investigation using the minimum tests cost 29.76 days’ wages. The availability of medicines varied from 36.4% to 59.1% in urban and from 9.1% to 50% in rural settings. Only metformin and benzathine-benzylpenicilline had a median price ratio of ≤1.5, with statins being largely unaffordable (at least 30.51 days’ wages). One month of combination treatment for coronary heart disease costs at least 40.87 days’ wages. Conclusion The investigation and management of patients with medium-to-high cardiovascular risk remains largely unavailable and unaffordable in this setting. An effective non-communicable disease program should lay emphasis on primary prevention, and improve affordable access to essential medicines in public outlets."

Here, we report a new regulatory role of ECSIT in TLR4-mediated signal. By LPS stimulation, ECSIT formed a high molecular endogenous complex including TAK1 and TRAF6, in which ECSIT interacted with each protein and regulated TAK1 activity, leading to the activation of NF-κB. ECSIT-knockdown THP-1 (ECSITKD THP-1) cells exhibited severe impairments in NF-κB activity, cytokine production, and NF-κB-dependent gene expression, whereas those were dramatically restored by reintroduction of wild type (WT) ECSIT gene. Interestingly, ECSIT mutants, which lack a specific interacting domain for either TAK1 or TRAF6, could not restore these activities. Moreover, no significant changes in both NF-κB activity and cytokine production induced by TLR4 could be seen in TAK1KD or TRAF6KD THP-1 cells transduced by WT ECSIT, strongly suggesting the essential requirement of TAK1-ECSIT-TRAF6 complex in TLR4 signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2062442506,"Recent evidence suggests that some solid tumors, including ovarian cancer, contain distinct populations of stem cells that are responsible for tumor initiation, growth, chemo-resistance, and recurrence. The Hippo pathway has attracted considerable attention and some investigators have focused on YAP functions for maintaining stemness and cell differentiation. In this study, we successfully isolated the ovarian cancer initiating cells (OCICs) and demonstrated YAP promoted self-renewal of ovarian cancer initiated cell (OCIC) through its downstream co-activator TEAD. YAP and TEAD families were required for maintaining the expression of specific genes that may be involved in OCICs' stemness and chemoresistance. Taken together, our data first indicate that YAP/TEAD co-activator regulated ovarian cancer initiated cell pluripotency and chemo-resistance. It proposed a new mechanism on the drug resistance in cancer stem cell that Hippo-YAP signal pathway might serve as therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer treatment in clinical."
https://openalex.org/W2012819109,"Evidence from a number of countries in Europe and North America point towards the secular declining trend in menarcheal age with considerable spatial variations over the past two centuries. Similar trends were reported in several developing countries from Asia, Africa and Latin America. However, data corroborating any secular trend in the menarcheal age of the Indian population remained sparse and inadequately verified.We examined secular trends, regional heterogeneity and association of socioeconomic, anthropometric and contextual factors with menarcheal age among ever-married women (15-49 years) in India. Using the pseudo cohort data approach, we fit multiple linear regression models to estimate secular trends in menarcheal age of 91394 ever-married women using the Indian Human Development Survey.The mean age at menarche among Indian women was 13.76 years (95 % CI: 13.75, 13.77) in 2005. It declined by three months from 13.83 years (95% CI: 13.81, 13.85) among women born prior to 1955-1964, to nearly 13.62 years (95% CI: 13.58, 13.67) among women born during late 1985-1989. However, these aggregate national figures mask extensive spatial heterogeneity as mean age at menarche varied from 15.0 years in Himachal Pradesh during 1955-1964 (95% CI: 14.89-15.11) to about 12.1 years in Assam (95% CI: 11.63-12.56) during 1985-1989.The regression analysis established a reduction of nearly one month per decade, suggesting a secular decline in age at menarche among Indian women. Notably, the menarcheal age was significantly associated with the area of residence, geographic region, linguistic groups, educational attainment, wealth status, caste and religious affiliations among Indian women."
https://openalex.org/W1972989279,"Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are characterized by the combined expression of the semi-invariant T cell receptor (TCR) Vα7.2, the lectin receptor CD161, as well as IL-18R, and play an important role in antibacterial host defense of the gut. The current study characterized CD161(+) MAIT and CD161-TCRVα7.2(+) T cell subsets within a large cohort of HIV patients with emphasis on patients with slow disease progression and elite controllers. Mononuclear cells from blood and lymph node samples as well as plasma from 63 patients and 26 healthy donors were analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry and ELISA for IL-18, sCD14 and sCD163. Additionally, MAIT cells were analyzed after in vitro stimulation with different cytokines and/or fixed E.coli. Reduced numbers of CD161(+) MAIT cells during HIV infection were detectable in the blood and lymph nodes of all patient groups, including elite controllers. CD161+ MAIT cell numbers did not recover even after successful antiretroviral treatment. The loss of CD161(+) MAIT cells was correlated with higher levels of MAIT cell activation; an increased frequency of the CD161-TCRVα7.2(+)T cell subset in HIV infection was observed. In vitro stimulation of MAIT cells with IL-18 and IL-12, IL-7 and fixed E.coli also resulted in a rapid and additive reduction of the MAIT cell frequency defined by CD161, IL-18R and CCR6. In summary, the irreversible reduction of the CD161(+) MAIT cell subset seems to be an early event in HIV infection that is independent of later stages of the disease. This loss appears to be at least partially due to the distinctive vulnerability of MAIT cells to the pronounced stimulation by microbial products and cytokines during HIV-infection."
https://openalex.org/W2095440355,"A putative operon encoding the biosynthetic pathway for the cytotoxic cyanobacterial lipopeptides puwainphycins was identified in Cylindrospermum alatosporum. Bioinformatics analysis enabled sequential prediction of puwainaphycin biosynthesis; this process is initiated by the activation of a fatty acid residue via fatty acyl-AMP ligase and continued by a multidomain non-ribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthetase. High-resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements proved the production of puwainaphycin F/G congeners differing in FA chain length formed by either 3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-methyl dodecanoic acid (4-methyl-Ahdoa) or 3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-methyl tetradecanoic acid (4-methyl-Ahtea). Because only one puwainaphycin operon was recovered in the genome, we suggest that the fatty acyl-AMP ligase and one of the amino acid adenylation domains (Asn/Gln) show extended substrate specificity. Our results provide the first insight into the biosynthesis of frequently occurring β-amino fatty acid lipopeptides in cyanobacteria, which may facilitate analytical assessment and development of monitoring tools for cytotoxic cyanobacterial lipopeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1965402139,"The bi-component leukocidins of Staphylococcus aureus are important virulence factors that lyse human phagocytic cells and contribute to immune evasion. The γ-hemolysins (HlgAB and HlgCB) and Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL or LukSF) were shown to assemble from soluble subunits into membrane-bound oligomers on the surface of target cells, creating barrel-like pore structures that lead to cell lysis. LukGH is the most distantly related member of this toxin family, sharing only 30-40% amino acid sequence identity with the others. We observed that, unlike other leukocidin subunits, recombinant LukH and LukG had low solubility and were unable to bind to target cells, unless both components were present. Using biolayer interferometry and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence we detected binding of LukH to LukG in solution with an affinity in the low nanomolar range and dynamic light scattering measurements confirmed formation of a heterodimer. We elucidated the structure of LukGH by x-ray crystallography at 2.8-A resolution. This revealed an octameric structure that strongly resembles that reported for HlgAB, but with important structural differences. Structure guided mutagenesis studies demonstrated that three salt bridges, not found in other bi-component leukocidins, are essential for dimer formation in solution and receptor binding. We detected weak binding of LukH, but not LukG, to the cellular receptor CD11b by biolayer interferometry, suggesting that in common with other members of this toxin family, the S-component has the primary contact role with the receptor. These new insights provide the basis for novel strategies to counteract this powerful toxin and Staphylococcus aureus pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2016812500,"Numerous studies have divided blood monocytes according to their expression of the surface markers CD14 and CD16 into following subsets: classical CD14++CD16−, intermediate CD14++CD16+ and nonclassical CD14+CD16++ monocytes. These subsets differ in phenotype and function and are further correlated to cardiovascular disease, inflammation and cancer. However, the CD14/CD16 nature of resident monocytes in human bone marrow remains largely unknown. In the present study, we identified a major population of CD14++CD16+ monocytes by using cryopreserved bone marrow mononuclear cells from healthy donors. These cells express essential monocyte-related antigens and chemokine receptors such as CD11a, CD18, CD44, HLA-DR, Ccr2, Ccr5, Cx3cr1, Cxcr2 and Cxcr4. Notably, the expression of Ccr2 was inducible during culture. Furthermore, sorted CD14++CD16+ bone marrow cells show typical macrophage morphology, phagocytic activity, angiogenic features and generation of intracellular oxygen species. Side-by-side comparison of the chemokine receptor profile with unpaired blood samples also demonstrated that these rather premature medullar monocytes mainly match the phenotype of intermediate and partially of (non)classical monocytes. Together, human monocytes obviously acquire their definitive CD14/CD16 signature in the bloodstream and the medullar monocytes probably transform into CD14++CD16− and CD14+CD16++ subsets which appear enriched in the periphery."
https://openalex.org/W1963859626,"Entry of HIV-1 into host cells remains a compelling yet elusive target for developing agents to prevent infection. A peptide triazole (PT) class of entry inhibitor has previously been shown to bind to HIV-1 gp120, suppress interactions of the Env protein at host cell receptor binding sites, inhibit cell infection, and cause envelope spike protein breakdown, including gp120 shedding and, for some variants, virus membrane lysis. We found that gold nanoparticle-conjugated forms of peptide triazoles (AuNP-PT) exhibit substantially more potent antiviral effects against HIV-1 than corresponding peptide triazoles alone. Here, we sought to reveal the mechanism of potency enhancement underlying nanoparticle conjugate function. We found that altering the physical properties of the nanoparticle conjugate, by increasing the AuNP diameter and/or the density of PT conjugated on the AuNP surface, enhanced potency of infection inhibition to impressive picomolar levels. Further, compared with unconjugated PT, AuNP-PT was less susceptible to reduction of antiviral potency when the density of PT-competent Env spikes on the virus was reduced by incorporating a peptide-resistant mutant gp120. We conclude that potency enhancement of virolytic activity and corresponding irreversible HIV-1 inactivation of PTs upon AuNP conjugation derives from multivalent contact between the nanoconjugates and metastable Env spikes on the HIV-1 virus. The findings reveal that multispike engagement can exploit the metastability built into virus the envelope to irreversibly inactivate HIV-1 and provide a conceptual platform to design nanoparticle-based antiviral agents for HIV-1 specifically and putatively for metastable enveloped viruses generally.HIV-1 envelope spike protein remains a compelling but elusive target for preventing infection.ResultsGold nanoparticle conjugates of peptide triazole Env inhibitors demonstrated impressive picomolar antiviral potencies.ConclusionNanoparticle conjugates enhanced antiviral functions by multivalent attachment to virus Env spikes.SignificanceFindings reveal that multispike engagement can exploit the metastability of the virus envelope to irreversibly inactivate HIV-1.

The former also has a worldwide distribution. To assist conservation efforts, this study examines spatial and temporal patterns in the abundance, diversity, and nature of their faunal associates. A total of 14 species were found on A. grandiflorum and 6 species on H. finmarchica during a multi-year and multi-site sampling campaign in eastern Canada. Among those, 7 and 5 species, respectively, were attached to the sea pens and categorized as close associates or symbionts. Rarefaction analyses suggest that the most common associates of both sea pens have been sampled. Biodiversity associated with each sea pen is analyzed according to season, depth and region using either close associates or the broader collection of species. Associated biodiversity generally increases from northern to southern locations and does not vary with depth (∼100–1400 m). Seasonal patterns in A. grandiflorum show higher biodiversity during spring/summer due to the transient presence of early life stages of fishes and shrimps whereas it peaks in fall for H. finmarchica. Two distinct endoparasitic species of highly modified copepods (families Lamippidae and Corallovexiidae) commonly occur in the polyps of A. grandiflorum and H. finmarchica, and a commensal sea anemone frequently associates with H. finmarchica. Stable isotope analyses (δ13C and δ15N) reveal potential trophic interactions between the parasites and their hosts. Overall, the diversity of obligate/permanent associates of sea pens is moderate; however the presence of mobile/transient associates highlights an ecological role that has yet to be fully elucidated and supports their key contribution to the enhancement of biodiversity in the Northwest Atlantic."

https://openalex.org/W2027382550,"The genes responsible for silk biosynthesis are switched on and off at particular times in the silk glands of Bombyx mori. This switch appears to be under the control of endogenous and exogenous hormones. However, the molecular mechanisms by which silk protein synthesis is regulated by the juvenile hormone (JH) are largely unknown. Here, we report a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, Bmdimm, its silk gland-specific expression, and its direct involvement in the regulation of fibroin H-chain (fib-H) by binding to an E-box (CAAATG) element of the fib-H gene promoter. Far-Western blots, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Bmdimm protein interacted with another basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, Bmsage. Immunostaining revealed that Bmdimm and Bmsage proteins are co-localized in nuclei. Bmdimm expression was induced in larval silk glands in vivo, in silk glands cultured in vitro, and in B. mori cell lines after treatment with a JH analog. The JH effect on Bmdimm was mediated by the JH-Met-Kr-h1 signaling pathway, and Bmdimm expression did not respond to JH by RNA interference with double-stranded BmKr-h1 RNA. These data suggest that the JH regulatory pathway, the transcription factor Bmdimm, and the targeted fib-H gene contribute to the synthesis of fibroin H-chain protein in B. mori."

In this cross-sectional study conducted in a TB endemic area, we enrolled patients at high-risk for LTBI and progression from LTBI to active TB from 2011 to 2012. Diagnosis of LTBI was made by QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT). Differences in sex in terms of prevalence of LTBI and clinical predictors for LTBI were investigated. Associations among age, smoking status, and sex disparities in LTBI were also analyzed. A total of 1018 high-risk individuals with definite QFT-GIT results were included for analysis, including 534 males and 484 females. The proportion of LTBI was significantly higher in males than in females (32.6% vs. 25.2%, p = 0.010). Differences in the proportion of LTBI between sexes were most prominent in older patients (age ≥ 55 years). In multivariate analysis, independent clinical factors associated with LTBI were age (p = 0.014), smoking (p = 0.048), and fibro-calcified lesions on chest radiogram (p = 0.009). Male sex was not an independent factor for LTBI (p = 0.88). When stratifying patients according to the smoking status, the proportion of LTBI remained comparable between sexes among smokers and non-smokers. In conclusion, although the proportion of LTBI is higher in men, there is no significant disparity in terms of sex in LTBI among high-risk individuals after adjusting for age, smoking status, and other clinical factors."
https://openalex.org/W2148710213,"Flowers bear the function of filters supporting the attraction of pollinators as well as the deterrence of floral antagonists. The effect of epidermal cell shape on the visual display and tactile properties of flowers has been evaluated only recently. In this study we quantitatively measured epidermal cell shape, gloss and spectral reflectance of flowers pollinated by either bees or birds testing three hypotheses: The first two hypotheses imply that bee-pollinated flowers might benefit from rough surfaces on visually-active parts produced by conical epidermal cells, as they may enhance the colour signal of flowers as well as the grip on flowers for bees. In contrast, bird-pollinated flowers might benefit from flat surfaces produced by flat epidermal cells, by avoiding frequent visitation from non-pollinating bees due to a reduced colour signal, as birds do not rely on specific colour parameters while foraging. Moreover, flat petal surfaces in bird-pollinated flowers may hamper grip for bees that do not touch anthers and stigmas while consuming nectar and thus, are considered as nectar thieves. Beside this, the third hypothesis implies that those flower parts which are vulnerable to nectar robbing of bee- as well as bird-pollinated flowers benefit from flat epidermal cells, hampering grip for nectar robbing bees. Our comparative data show in fact that conical epidermal cells are restricted to visually-active parts of bee-pollinated flowers, whereas robbing-sensitive parts of bee-pollinated as well as the entire floral surface of bird-pollinated flowers possess on average flat epidermal cells. However, direct correlations between epidermal cell shape and colour parameters have not been found. Our results together with published experimental studies show that epidermal cell shape as a largely neglected flower trait might act as an important feature in pollinator attraction and avoidance of antagonists, and thus may contribute to the partitioning of flower-visitors."
https://openalex.org/W2005336610,"Agent-based models (ABM) are believed to be a very powerful tool in the social sciences, sometimes even treated as a substitute for social experiments. When building an ABM we have to define the agents and the rules governing the artificial society. Given the complexity and our limited understanding of the human nature, we face the problem of assuming that either personal traits, the situation or both have impact on the social behavior of agents. However, as the long-standing person-situation debate in psychology shows, there is no consensus as to the underlying psychological mechanism and the important question that arises is whether the modeling assumptions we make will have a substantial influence on the simulated behavior of the system as a whole or not.Studying two variants of the same agent-based model of opinion formation, we show that the decision to choose either personal traits or the situation as the primary factor driving social interactions is of critical importance. Using Monte Carlo simulations (for Barabasi-Albert networks) and analytic calculations (for a complete graph) we provide evidence that assuming a person-specific response to social influence at the microscopic level generally leads to a completely different and less realistic aggregate or macroscopic behavior than an assumption of a situation-specific response; a result that has been reported by social psychologists for a range of experimental setups, but has been downplayed or ignored in the opinion dynamics literature.This sensitivity to modeling assumptions has far reaching consequences also beyond opinion dynamics, since agent-based models are becoming a popular tool among economists and policy makers and are often used as substitutes of real social experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1990998396,"A growing body of work has shown that the highly homologous T-box transcription factors TBX2 and TBX3 play critical but distinct roles in embryonic development and cancer progression. For example, TBX2 and TBX3 are up-regulated in several cancers and recent evidence suggests that whereas TBX2 functions as a pro-proliferative factor, TBX3 inhibits cell proliferation but promotes cancer cell migration and invasion. While the molecular mechanisms regulating these functions of TBX2 and TBX3 are poorly understood we recently reported that the TGF-β1 signaling pathway up-regulates TBX3 expression to mediate, in part, its well described anti-proliferative and pro-migratory roles. The TBX3 targets responsible for these functions were however not identified. Here we reveal for the first time that the TGF-β1 signaling pathway represses TBX2 transcriptionally and we provide a detailed mechanism to show that this is mediated by TBX3. Furthermore, we implicate the down-regulation of TBX2 in the anti-proliferative function of the TGF-β1-TBX3 axis. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the regulation of TBX2 and TBX3 and shed light on the mechanisms involved in the anti-proliferative and pro-migratory roles of TGF-β1.

The transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) 2The abbreviations used are: TGFtransforming growth factorqRT-PCRquantitative real-time PCRCHXcycloheximide. pathway plays critical roles in a wide range of cellular processes including cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and the immune response. This multi-functional cytokine generally exerts its effects by binding and activating the TGFβ receptors I and II, which initiate a cascade of signaling events frequently involving Smad proteins and co-factors but which can also be Smad-independent (1.Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Specificity and versatility in TGF-β signaling through Smads.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). One of the well-known roles of TGF-β1 is its ability to inhibit the proliferation of epithelial cells but promote their migration (2.Massagué J. TGFβ signalling in context.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 616-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 has been shown to inhibit proliferation primarily by inducing a G1 cell cycle arrest through its ability to transcriptionally up-regulate expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p15Ink4b and p21Cip1 (3.Jahn S.C. Law M.E. Corsino P.E. Law B.K. TGF-β antiproliferative effects in tumor suppression.Frontiers in Bioscience. 2012; 4: 749-766PubMed Google Scholar). Its pro-migratory effects, however, appear to be mainly due to its ability to regulate key players of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (4.Heldin C. Vanlandewijck M. Moustakas A. Regulation of EMT by TGFβ in cancer.FEBS Lett. 2012; 586: 1959-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). These anti-proliferative and pro-migratory roles of TGF-β1 are important in embryonic development, for example during branching morphogenesis of the mammary gland, as well as during oncogenesis (5.Moses H.

We recently reported that TGF-β1 up-regulates expression of the T-box transcription factor, TBX3, through a mechanism involving the co-operation of Smad proteins and JunB. This was shown to be a critical downstream event for mediating TGF-β1-induced anti-proliferation and pro-migration of breast epithelial cells and keratinocytes but the TBX3 target genes responsible for this were not described (7.Li J.

The T-box family of transcription factors are highly conserved in evolution and play critical roles in embryonic development. TBX3 is a member of the TBX2 subfamily and along with its closely related family member, TBX2, it plays an important role in the development of the limbs, heart, and mammary glands (8.Rowley M.

Furthermore, we and others have also shown that TBX2 and TBX3 play distinct roles in cancer progression, with TBX2 functioning as a powerful pro-proliferative factor and TBX3 playing a role in migration and invasion (22.Peres J.

T-box 2 represses NDRG1 through an EGR1-dependent mechanism to drive the proliferation of breast cancer cells.Oncogene. 2010; 29: 3252-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Together with our previously published data showing that TBX2 and TBX3 exhibit mutually exclusive expression in some melanoma cell lines (24.Rodriguez M. Aladowicz E. Lanfrancone L. Goding C.R. Tbx3 represses E-cadherin expression and enhances melanoma invasiveness.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7872-7881Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we therefore speculated that the anti-proliferative function of TGF-β1 may be due to its ability to down-regulate TBX2 expression. Indeed, here we show that in human breast epithelial and mouse melanoma cells, TGF-β1 negatively regulates TBX2 protein and mRNA levels at a transcriptional level and importantly, we demonstrate that this regulation is dependent on increased TBX3 levels. Using both in vitro and in vivo assays we reveal that TBX3 binds and regulates the TBX2 promoter in response to TGF-β1 through a T-element at −186 bp. Furthermore, we show that the down-regulation of TBX2 expression is responsible for the decrease in cell proliferation induced by TGF-β1 and that this is possibly mediated by increased p21 levels. The normal human breast epithelial MCF-12A cells were maintained in complete medium consisting of DMEM/Ham's F12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 μg/ml cholera toxin (Sigma), 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Calbiochem), 10 μg/ml insulin (Novorapid, Denmark), 20 ng/ml EGF (GIBCO), and 5% horse serum (Highveld Biological, Lyndhurst, UK). B16 mouse melanoma cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Highveld Biological, Lyndhurst, UK) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cell lines were maintained in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C. For TGF-β1 treatment, we used 5 ng/ml rhTGF-β1 (R&D Systems), diluted in 4 mm HCl, 1 mg/ml BSA. For inhibition of de novo protein synthesis experiments, cells were pretreated with 30 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h and then treated with TGF-β1 for 8 h. The human TBX2 promoter luciferase reporter constructs have been described previously (25.Teng H. Parker M.I. Prince S.

The pcDNA 3.1(+) containing the full-length human TBX2 cDNA was supplied by Prof. van Lohuizen (Antoni van Leeuwenhoek hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The TBX2 cDNA was then excised and the vector re-ligated to generate the pcDNA3.1 (+) empty vector, into which the human TBX3 cDNA was cloned using the NheI and BamHI sites. The p21-pRc/CMV plasmid, which was prepared in the laboratory of Prof William Kaelin, was obtained from Addgene (Addgene plasmid 20814) (26.Adams P.D. Sellers W.R. Sharma S.K. Wu A.D. Nalin C.M.

Primary antibodies used were as follows: goat polyclonal anti-TBX2 antibody (sc-17880, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal anti-TBX3 (42–4800, Zymed Laboratories Inc., Invitrogen), rabbit polyclonal anti-p21 (sc-397, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and rabbit polyclonal anti-p38 (M0800, Sigma, Germany). Cells were harvested, and mRNA prepared as described previously (28.Mowla S. Pinnock R. Leaner V.D. Goding C.R. Prince S.

Primers used to amplify the human TBX3 (QT00022484), TBX2 (QT00091266), and GUSB (QT00046046) were purchased from Qiagen. To generate stably transfected cell lines, MCF-12A cells were transfected with either the empty expression vector pcDNA3.1 (+) or with this vector containing the full-length human TBX2 cDNA using X-tremeGENE HD DNA transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). Stable transfected cells were selected by 400 μg/ml G-418. The MCF-12A cells were transiently transduced using adenovirus with human TBX3 cDNA cloned into the vector component of an Adeno-X Tet-off expression system 1 (Clontech). The virus was purified using the Adeno-X Maxi purification kit (Clontech). All steps were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transient transfections were performed using X-tremeGENE HD DNA transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. MCF-12A cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells per well of a 12-well plate, 24 h before transfection. Cells were co-transfected with 400 ng of a TBX2-luciferase reporter plasmid plus 100 ng of the TBX3 expression plasmids or corresponding amounts of an empty-vector plasmid. Luciferase activities were measured using the Luminoskan Ascent luminometer (Thermo Labsystems, Franklin, MA). All transfections were performed in duplicate and at least three independent experiments were done to confirm reproducibility. Firefly luciferase values were expressed relative to empty-vector control. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the −218/+33 bp TBX2 promoter-luciferase reporter or pCMV-TBX3 expression construct as a template using PFU polymerase reagents (Promega). Mutations were introduced as follows (only sense-strand presented and mutations indicated with lowercase letters): T-element (-186): 5′-GCTGAGGCTTCCaAaAaCTTCTCCCAGGCC-3′; TBX3 DNA binding domain mutant (R133G): 5′-CATTACCAAGTCGGGAgGGgGAATGTTTCCTCCATTTAAAG-3′. The integrity of each mutant construct was verified using agarose gel electrophoresis and sequencing. Transient knockdown of TBX2 and TBX3 was achieved by siTBX2#1 (SI02656563), siTBX2#2 (SI03238802), siTBX3#1 (SI00083503), and siTBX3#2 (SI03100426) purchased from Qiagen. Knockdown of p21 was achieved using ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool Human CDKN1A siRNA (sip21#1) (Thermo Scientific) and sip21#2 (SI00299810) from Qiagen. The cells were transfected with siRNAs to TBX2, TBX3, p21 or a control (non-silencing) siRNA (1027310; Qiagen) using HiPerFect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. ChIP assays were carried out as previously described (10.Prince S. Carreira S. Vance K.W. Abrahams A. Goding C.R. Tbx2 Directly Represses the Expression of the p21 WAF1 Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor Kinase Inhibitor.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, MCF-12A cells treated with TGF-β1 for 24 h were fixed in 1% formaldehyde and the chromatin extracted, sonicated, and immunoprecipitated using antibodies against TBX3 (sc-17871) or IgG (negative control, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). DNA precipitated was analyzed by qRT-PCR using human TBX2-specific primer pairs or a nonspecific promoter region (GUSB, Qiagen). Crossing values (Ct) of TBX3 precipitated DNA were normalized against the Ct values of IgG. Fold enrichment was determined using the ΔΔCt method: Fold enrichment = 2−(ΔCt1-ΔCt2), where ΔCt1 is the ChIP of interest, and ΔCt2 is the IgG. Biotinylated DNA oligos were: WT: 5′-GCTGAGGCTTCCGACACCTTCTCCCAGGCC-3′, MT: 5′-GCTGAGGCTTCCaAaAaCTTCTCCCAGGCC-3′, Consensus: 5′-CTTAGGGAATTTCACACCTAGGTGTGAAATTCCCT-3′. For each DNA-binding reaction, nuclear extract was incubated with biotinylated DNA probe in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 10 ng/μl poly(dI-dC)). The beads were washed with binding buffer and boiled in protein loading buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 0.4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 20% glycerol). Proteins bound to the biotinylated probes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting using goat polyclonal TBX3 (sc-17871) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Short-term growth of cells was compared over a 3-day period, as described previously (29.Prince S. Wiggins T. Hulley P.A. Kidson S.H. Stimulation of Melanogenesis by Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) in Mouse Melanocytes and Neural Crest Cells.Pigment Cell Res. 2003; 16: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 0.5 × 104 cells were seeded in triplicate in 24-well plates on day 0 and treated with vehicle or 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 2–3 days. Statistical analysis was performed by using the 2-sample t test (Excel). TBX2 and TBX3 are highly homologous T-box factors with distinct oncogenic roles. We recently reported that TBX3 is transcriptionally activated by the TGF-β1 signaling pathway (7.Li J. Weinberg M.S. Zerbini L. Prince S. The oncogenic TBX3 is a downstream target and mediator of the TGF-β1 signaling pathway.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24: 3569-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and we therefore examined whether the expression of TBX2 is also responsive to this pathway. To this end we exposed MCF-12A breast epithelial and B16 mouse melanoma cells to TGF-β1 or vehicle over a time course spanning 1–36 h. Western blot analyses show that TBX2 levels decrease substantially in response to TGF-β1 treatment in both cell lines from 8 h in MCF-12A cells and 4 h in B16 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). This robust repression was also observed in WI-38 normal human fibroblasts (data not shown). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) experiments performed on cells treated as above demonstrate a corresponding decrease in TBX2 mRNA levels that precedes the decrease in protein levels (Fig. 1, C and D). To investigate if this regulation is transcriptional, we tested whether the −1604 bp TBX2 promoter is responsive to TGF-β1 treatment using a luciferase assay and the results showed a time-dependent decrease in reporter activity in response to TGF-β1 (Fig. 2A). To distinguish the need for de novo protein synthesis, cells were pre-treated with cycloheximide (CHX), a protein synthesis inhibitor, which abolished the repression of TBX2 mRNA and protein levels by TGF-β1 (Fig. 2, B and C). Together these results suggest that TGF-β1-mediated repression of TBX2 is transcriptional and that it requires the production of nascent protein.FIGURE 2TBX2 is transcriptionally regulated by TGF-β1. A, luciferase assay using MCF-12A cells, which were transfected with full-length human TBX2 promoter (400 ng) constructs and were treated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β1. Mean values (± S.D.) are presented as fold activity over that of an empty firefly luciferase reporter and are representative of at least three independent experiments. MCF-12A (B) and B16 (C) cells were pretreated with vehicle (control) or 30 μg/ml CHX for 1 h and treated with TGF-β1 for 8 h for MCF-12A cells and 4 h for B16 cells.

The results show that the repression of TBX2 by TGF-β1 treatment is sustained even in the −218 bp TBX2 promoter construct (Fig. 3A). To investigate whether Smad3 and Smad4 (Smad3/4) are involved in this regulation, MCF-12A cells were co-transfected with increasing amounts of Smad3/4 expression vectors and the −218 bp TBX2 promoter luciferase construct. Fig. 3B shows that Smad3/4 had very little effect on TBX2 promoter activity suggesting that the regulation of TBX2 by TGF-β1 either requires a Smad co-factor(s) or involves a mechanism that does not directly require the Smads. We therefore repeated these experiments in the presence or absence of the well-known Smad co-factors, JunB or Sp1, but no repression was observed (data not shown). Based on our previous findings we speculated that TBX2 may be downstream of TBX3 in the TGF-β1 pathway. To address this we screened the TBX2 promoter for T-elements and a T-element which is highly conserved between Tbx2 promoters from several species was identified at −186 bp (Fig. 3C). Indeed, depleting TBX3 levels by siRNA in MCF-12A cells diminished the ability of TGF-β1 to repress TBX2 protein and mRNA levels (Fig. 3, D and E). It is worth noting that while the fold repression of TBX2 by TGF-β1 in the siTBX3 cells was still significant, it was lower than that of the control cells and may be due to incomplete knockdown of TBX3. Furthermore, knocking down TBX3 in untreated cells resulted in an increase in TBX2 mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that TBX3 represses basal and TGF-β1 regulated TBX2 levels. We next wanted to confirm that TBX3 can directly repress TBX2 in vivo and to this end we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Cross-linked chromatin was prepared from TGF-β1-treated and control MCF-12A cells and DNA immunoprecipitated with an antibody to TBX3 was subjected to qRT-PCR with primers spanning the −186 bp putative T-element in the TBX2 promoter. The results obtained show that compared with the untreated control, the binding of TBX3 to the TBX2 promoter was enhanced by 8.5-fold in the presence of TGF-β1 (Fig. 4A). To determine whether TBX3 binds specifically to the −186 bp T-element in the TBX2 promoter, we performed a DNA affinity immunoblot (DAI) using nuclear extract isolated from TGF-β1-treated MCF-12A cells and a biotin-labeled probe containing the wild-type or mutated T-element (Fig. 4B). As an additional control a probe containing a full T-element consensus site was included in these experiments and protein-bound biotinylated DNA was isolated and analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-TBX3 antibody. The results showed that while TBX3 bound strongly to both the consensus and wild-type probes, it displayed a decreased affinity for the probe with the mutated T-element (Fig. 4B). Together, these results suggest that TBX3 binds the TBX2 promoter specifically at the T-element at −186 bp. To test whether TBX3 can repress the TBX2 promoter and whether the T-element at −186 bp mediates this repression, MCF-12A cells were co-transfected with a TBX3 expression vector and either a wild type −218 bp TBX2 promoter luciferase construct or a construct in which the T-element was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis. The results show that TBX3 repressed the TBX2 promoter by ∼18-fold and that the ability of TBX3 to repress TBX2 was significantly reduced when the −186 bp T-element was mutated (Fig. 4C). To identify the functional domains of the TBX3 protein that are responsible for this regulation, the wild type −218 bp TBX2 promoter luciferase construct was co-transfected with vectors expressing either a WT TBX3 protein or a TBX3 protein in which the DNA binding site was mutated or only a N-terminal TBX3 protein lacking the dominant repression domain. The data obtained indicate that the TBX3 DNA binding domain and C terminus containing a repression domain are important for its ability to repress the TBX2 promoter (Fig. 4D). All TBX3 constructs were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 4, C and D, right). We next investigated whether overexpression of TBX2 in MCF-12A cells could rescue the inhibition of cell proliferation by TGF-β1. Briefly, a pcDNA-TBX2 expression vector or the empty control vector was transfected into MCF-12A cells and G418-resistant clones were pooled for subsequent analysis. Overexpression of TBX2 was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 5A), and growth curves show that while cell proliferation was significantly reduced by TGF-β1 in the control cells, overexpressing TBX2 was sufficient to rescue this phenotype (Fig. 5B). This was confirmed by flow cytometry, which showed that TGF-β1 treatment induced a significant G1 cell cycle arrest in the control cells but had no effect on the cell cycle profile of the TBX2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5C). These results correlated with changes in the protein and mRNA levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (Fig. 5, A and E). Importantly, the increase in p21 mRNA and protein levels in TGF-β1-treated cells are abrogated when TBX2 is overexpressed suggesting that TBX2 may be the upstream regulator of p21 in the TGF-β1 pathway. Indeed, when TBX2-overexpressing cells were transfected with a p21 expression vector they had a decreased proliferative ability, which could not be further reduced by TGF-β1 treatment (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, TBX2 overexpression failed to have any significant effect on the TGF-β1-induced activation of p15 mRNA levels (Fig. 5F), another cell cycle inhibitor which has been shown to mediate a G1 arrest in response to TGF-β1 (30.Reynisdóttir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massagué J. Kip/Cip and Ink4 Cdk inhibitors cooperate to induce cell cycle arrest in response to TGF-beta.Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Together, these data imply that the anti-proliferative effect of TGF-β1 on MCF-12A cells occurs primarily through up-regulation of p21, since the continued repression of p21 in TBX2 overexpressing cells allowed the cells to proliferate even in the presence of TGF-β1 and despite the up-regulation of p15. To confirm this, p21 expression was knocked down using a siRNA approach and growth curve analyses performed in the presence and absence of TGF-β1. As expected, cells in which p21 were effectively knocked down proliferated faster than the control cells in the absence of TGF-β1 (Fig. 6A). Importantly, the p21-depleted cells also failed to show a significant decrease in cell proliferation in response to TGF-β1. In addition, when the MCF-12A cells were depleted of TBX2 the untreated cells had a significant decrease in cell proliferation which could not be significantly further decreased in response to TGF-β1 treatment depleted TBX2 in (Fig. 6B). These data together with Western blot results from TBX3 overexpressing cells (Fig. 6C) suggest that the down-regulation of TBX2 by TBX3 mediates the anti-proliferative effect of TGF-β1 through allowing up-regulation of p21.FIGURE 6The down-regulation of TBX2 by TBX3 mediates the TGF-β1 anti-proliferative effect through up-regulation of p21.

Blobe G.C. Role of transforming growth factor-β superfamily signaling pathways in human disease.BBA Molecular Basis of Disease. 2008; 1782: 197-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 is a potent inhibitor of cell proliferation, which is thought to result from its ability to induce a G1 cell cycle arrest through the up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (cdki), p15, and p21 (30.Reynisdóttir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massagué J. Kip/Cip and Ink4 Cdk inhibitors cooperate to induce cell cycle arrest in response to TGF-beta.Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). However, it can also stimulate invasiveness by promoting an epithelial to mesenchyme transition. Understanding how TGF-β1 coordinates its effects on the cell cycle and invasion in different cell types is a key issue, both for development and disease. Here we have dissected the interrelated roles of the TBX2 and TBX3 transcription factors, which are widely implicated in cancer progression, in the response to TGF-β1. Previously we demonstrated that the TGF-β1-mediated growth arrest observed in melanoma could be bypassed by ectopic TBX2 expression (36.Baldwin R. Tran H. Karlan B. Loss of c-myc repression coincides with ovarian cancer resistance to transforming growth factor β growth arrest independent of transforming growth factor β/Smad signaling.Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1413-1419PubMed Google Scholar), and that TBX3, which can promote invasiveness by repressing E-cadherin expression (24.Rodriguez M. Aladowicz E. Lanfrancone L. Goding C.R. Tbx3 represses E-cadherin expression and enhances melanoma invasiveness.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7872-7881Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), is a downstream target of the TGF-β1 signaling pathway and plays an important role in exerting its anti-proliferative and pro-invasive effects (7.Li J. Weinberg M.S. Zerbini L. Prince S. The oncogenic TBX3 is a downstream target and mediator of the TGF-β1 signaling pathway.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24: 3569-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, how TBX3 might exert its anti-proliferative function, and what suppresses TBX2 expression was not known. In this study we show that when the TGF-β1 pathway is stimulated in breast epithelial and melanoma cells, TBX2 expression is repressed through the direct binding of TBX3 to a half T-element in the TBX2 promoter. Our results are also consistent with TBX2 being a powerful pro-proliferative factor (22.Peres J. Davis E. Mowla S. Bennett D.C. Li J.A. Wansleben S. Prince S.

T-box 2 represses NDRG1 through an EGR1-dependent mechanism to drive the proliferation of breast cancer cells.Oncogene. 2010; 29: 3252-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and indicate that the down-regulation of TBX2 blocks proliferation through the de-repression of the TBX2 target gene, p21, a cdki that initiates the TGF-β1-induced G1 arrest (32.Yoo Y.D. Choi J.Y. Lee S.J. Kim J.S. Min B.R. Lee Y.I. Kang Y.K. TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest through the p21(WAF1/CIP1)-G1 cyclin/Cdks-p130 pathway in gastric-carcinoma cells.Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Together these data provide an explanation for how the TGF-β1 pathway exerts its anti-proliferative effect and reveal an upstream mechanism involved in regulating TBX2 and TBX3 in contexts where they are differentially expressed. Moreover, since overexpression of TBX2 can override the anti-proliferative effects of TGF-β1 without affecting p15 levels, up-regulation of p15 is unlikely to be required for the effect of TGF-β1 on the proliferative ability of these cells, though it may be involved in other TGF-β1-mediated functions. TBX2 and TBX3 are highly homologous T-box transcription factors which have distinct roles during embryonic development and in breast cancer and melanoma cell lines where they are both overexpressed (7.Li J.

Importantly, whereas TBX2 is essential for promoting cell proliferation, TBX3 inhibits cell proliferation but is required for cell migration. These results together with data from the current study suggest an interesting interplay between TBX2, TBX3, and TGF-β1 signaling in normal epithelial cells (Fig. 7). Briefly, in this context TGF-β1 signaling activates TBX3 expression in a Smad/JunB dependent manner and TBX3 then represses TBX2 transcription, which allows for the de-repression of p21 and a G1 cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, malignant cells acquire immortalizing mutations that enable them to evade the anti-proliferative effects of TGF-β1 signaling. For example, one of the mechanisms by which TGF-β1 exerts its anti-proliferative effects is through inhibiting expression of MYC that leads to the de-repression of p21. Many malignant cells however have mutations that result in the constitutive expression of MYC and hence these cells are resistant to the anti-proliferative effects of TGF-β1. It is therefore possible that cancers in which TBX2 is overexpressed will similarly disregard the TGF-β1 anti-proliferative signals. Intriguingly, the TBX3 promoter has a full consensus MYC binding site, raising the possibility that MYC will impact the TBX3-TBX2 axis identified here. The expression of MYC is usually down-regulated by TGF-β1 treatment, and ectopic expression of MYC in mouse keratinocytes desensitized the cells to TGF-β1 mediated growth inhibition (33.Feng X.-H. Liang Y.-Y. Liang M. Zhai W. Lin X. Direct interaction of c-Myc with Smad2 and Smad3 to inhibit TGF-β-mediated induction of the CDK inhibitor p15(Ink4B).Mol.

Furthermore, sustained MYC expression in ovarian cancers coincides with resistance to the anti-proliferative effects of TGF-β1 (36.Baldwin R. Tran H. Karlan B.

MUC1 engages in signal transduction by interacting with receptors for growth and differentiation factors, which contributes to the growth and survival of cancer cells. However, the mechanism by which MUC1 promotes cancer cell invasion remains unclear. Microarray analysis revealed that expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) was elevated in MUC1-overexpressing cells. Furthermore, up- and down-modulation of MUC1 expression was clearly correlated with the change of uPA expression. An immunochemical study showed that the distribution of uPA coincided with that of MUC1 in various human cancer tissues. The MUC1 C-terminal domain (MUC1-CD) was associated with nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 in MUC1-expressing cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated that MUC1-CD existed with NF-κB p65 on the uPA promoter. Luciferase assays indicated that the uPA transcriptional activity was correlated with the level of MUC1 expression and that this MUC1-enhancing effect on the uPA transcription was abolished by introduction of mutations into the NF-κB binding sites on the uPA promoter. These results indicate that formation of the MUC1-CD and NF-κB p65 complex enhanced nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 and subsequent occupancy of NF-κB binding region on the uPA promoter, leading to elevated transcription of uPA. We also demonstrated that uPA induced by MUC1 enhanced the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 activities, and consequently promoted cancer cell invasion.

Metastasis. 2009; 26: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). NF-κB is composed of two subunits (RelA/p65 and p50), and forms a complex with inhibitor of IκB in the cytoplasm. NF-κB activation is induced by degradation of IκB by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, and subsequently the activated NF-κB p65 subunit is translocated to the nucleus (32.Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Shared principles in NF-κB signaling.Cell. 2008; 132: 344-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3549) Google Scholar). It has been reported that MUC1-CD modulates the activity of the NF-κB pathway in breast cancer cells by interacting with and activating IKK family members and NF-κB p65 (12.Ahmad R. Raina D. Joshi M.D. Kawano T. Ren J. Kharbanda S. Kufe D.

Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1419-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that expression of uPA changed in parallel with the level of MUC1. To reveal the mechanism by which uPA is induced, we investigated whether or not MUC1-CD plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of uPA. Expectedly, formation of the MUC1-CD/NF-κB p65 complex promoted nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 and occupied the uPA promoter. Thus, MUC1 contributes to NF-κB-mediated uPA transcriptional activation, this being consistent with the fact that MUC1 promotes the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. Goat anti-uPA, Armenian (Arm.) hamster anti-MUC1-CD, mouse anti-MUC1-ND, and rabbit anti-heat shock protein 90 β (HSP90 β) (monoclonal) antibodies were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), Lab Vision (Fremont, CA), BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA), and Bioss (Woburn, MA), respectively. Rabbit anti-NF-κB p65 and goat anti-lamin B antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse anti-β-actin monoclonal antibodies and amiloride, a uPA inhibitor, were from Sigma-Aldrich. GM 6001, a MMPs inhibitor, and JSH-23, an NF-κB inhibitor, were from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY) and Symansis (Auckland, New Zealand), respectively. Human HCT116 colon cancer, A549 lung cancer and SKOV3 ovary cancer cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). HCT116 and SKOV3 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS (HI-FBS), 4 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. A549 cells were cultured in F-12K medium (ATCC) containing 10% HI-FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. MUC1 gene transfectants (HCT116/MUC1 and A549/MUC1) and control cells (HCT116/Mock and A549/Mock) were generated as described previously (34.Li Y. Ren J. Yu W. Li Q. Kuwahara H. Yin L. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Kufe D. The epidermal growth factor receptor regulates interaction of the human DF3/MUC1 carcinoma antigen with c-Src and beta-catenin.J. Biol.

MUC1 gene knockdown transfectants (SKOV3/Si-1 and -2) and control cells (SKOV3/Scr) were generated by introducing human MUC1 shRNA and scrambled shRNA vectors (OriGene, Rockville, MD), respectively, into SKOV3 cells using Fugene® HD transfection reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stable transfectants were obtained by selection with puromycin (1 μg/ml). Total RNA was isolated from HCT116/Mock and HCT116/MUC1 cells using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol for RNA extraction. Total RNA was labeled with either cyanine-3 or cyanine-5 using a Low Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol, followed by purification on an RNeasy column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Labeled RNAs were fragmented at 60 °C for 30 min and hybridized to Human Gene Expression 4 × 44K v2 Microarray (Agilent Technologies) at 65 °C for 17 h. Thereafter, the arrays were washed with GE Wash buffer 1 and GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent Technologies), and dried by centrifugation, followed by scanning with an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner G2565CA. Cells were solubilized with cell lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 (Tx-100), and a Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan)), and then sonicated on ice for 1 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to remove cell debris. Proteins in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were prepared using NE-PRE® Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagent (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein was determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). HCT116/MUC1 cells were solubilized with cell lysis buffer as described above. MUC1-CD and NF-κB p65 were immunoprecipitated from the lysates by successive incubation with anti-MUC1-CD or anti-NF-κB p65 antibodies, or the respective control IgG and PureProteomeTM Protein A or G Magnetic Beads (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Proteins and immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting and incubation with anti-uPA, anti-MUC1-CD, anit-NF-κB p65, anti-HSP90 β, anti-lamin B, or anti-β-actin antibodies. Immune complexes were detected with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 20 min and then washed with PBS. Thereafter, the cells were blocked, and permeabilized with 5% BSA and 0.1% Tx-100 in PBS at room temperature for 30 min, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-MUC1-ND, anti-uPA, anti-NF-κB p65, or anti-MUC1-CD antibodies. The cells, after washing with PBS, were stained with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies and DAPI. Images were obtained by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Leica, Mannheim, Germany). Sections of paraffin-embedded tumor and nonmalignant tissues were deparaffinized with xylene and ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed by treatment of the sections with 0.01 m citric acid buffer, pH 6.0, at 100 °C for 15 min. After washing with PBS, the sections were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS at room temperature for 1 h, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-MUC1-ND and anti-uPA antibodies. After washing with PBS, the sections were stained with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies and DAPI. Images were obtained by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon, Melville, NY). The tissues described above, thereafter, were also subjected to H&E staining. Specimens of tumor and adjacent nonmalignant tissues were obtained from cancer patients in accordance with the protocol approved by Osaka City University. These assays were performed basically according to Shang et al. (35.Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cofactor dynamics and sufficiency in estrogen receptor-regulated transcription.Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Subconfluent cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde in DMEM at room temperature for 10 min, and then the cross-linking reaction was quenched with 0.125 m glycine in PBS at room temperature for 5 min. Thereafter, the cells were washed with cold PBS and collected with a cell scraper. After centrifugation at 2,500 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, the pellets were resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and a protease inhibitor) and incubated on ice for 15 min. After sonication for 10 s six times, the lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatants were diluted 5-fold with ChIP dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 167 mm NaCl, 1.1% Tx-100 and 0.11% sodium deoxycholate), and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-NF-κB p65 or anti-MUC1-CD antibodies, or the respective control IgG. Immune complexes were precipitated with Dynabeads® protein A or G (Invitrogen), and subsequently the beads were washed successively with the following buffers; low salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Tx-100, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate), high salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Tx-100, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate), LiCl buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), and Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA). The washed beads were resuspended in ChIP elution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% SDS) and then incubated overnight at 65 °C to reverse the cross-linking. The eluates were collected and treated with RNase (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min, and with proteinase K (100 μg/ml) at 55 °C for 2 h. Then, DNA was purified using a High Pure PCR Cleanup Micro Kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) and subjected to PCR. For re-ChIP assays, MUC1-CD associated complexes obtained by primary ChIP were treated with re-ChIP elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 10 mm DTT, and a protease inhibitor) at 37 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted 20-fold with re-ChIP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 167 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1.1% Tx-100), from which MUC1-CD-associated complexes NF-κB p65 was immunoprecipitated with anti-NF-κB p65 antibodies. PCR was performed to amplify a distinct region of the uPA promoter with putative NF-κB binding sites (NF-κB BR) (forward primer, 5′-CTC TCA GCA ATC AGC ATG AC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCC TCT AGA AGA CTG TGG TCA G-3′), and a uPA non-promoter region (negative control region; CR) (forward primer, 5′-ACT TGG AGA ATG GAG CCT TG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AGG TCT GCT GGT CGC TTA TC-3′). DNA was identified by 30–35 cycles of PCR, and the intensities of bands were determined with Image J software (National Institutes of Health). Genomic DNA was prepared from HCT116/MUC1 cells using NucleoSpin® Tissue (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). To amplify the uPA promoter region (−1933 to +58), PCR was performed using the following primers: forward primer, 5′-GGC AGA TCT CCT CCA GCC AAG TAA TCT GG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AAT CCA TGG CTG CGG GGA CAG GTG GAC CC-3′. A BglII/NcoI-blunt-ended PCR product was cloned into the pCR®-Blunt II-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, sequenced, and then subcloned into PicaGene Basic Vector 2 (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan: WT/uPA vector). The uPA promoter mutated at the NF-κB and TCF4 (T-cell factor 4) binding site was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a KOD-Plus-Mutagenesis Kit (TOYOBO, Tokyo, Japan: MutNF-κB/uPA and MutTCF4/uPA vectors, respectively). Mutations from GGG to ACC in the two NF-κB consensus sequences (nucleotide positions; −1867 to −1865 and −1844 to −1842) and ones from TT to CG in the two TCF4 consensus sequences (nucleotide positions; −739 to −738 and −564 to −563) were introduced. To determine uPA promoter activity, cells were co-transfected with the pRL-TK vector (Toyo Ink) plus the WT/uPA vector, the MutNF-κB/uPA vector, the MutTCF4/uPA vector or an empty vector using Fugene® HD transfection reagent, and after 24 h, the promoter activity was assayed by using a PicaGene Dual Sea Pansy Luminescence Kit (Toyo Ink) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Promoter activity (i.e. Firefly luciferase) was normalized as to transfection efficiency by using Renilla luciferase activity (pRL-TK). Subconfluent cells were washed with PBS and then cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h. uPA in the conditioned medium was measured using an ELISA kit, an AssayMax Human Urokinase (uPA) ELISA Kit (Assaypro, St. Charles, MO), according to the manufacturer's protocol. These assays were performed basically according to He et al. (36.He Y. Liu X.D. Chen Z.Y. Zhu J. Xiong Y. Li K. Dong J.H. Li X.

The conditioned medium was electrophoresed on an SDS-PAGE gel containing gelatin (1 mg/ml) or casein (0.1% (w/v)) and plasminogen (5 μg/ml) under non-reducing conditions. The gels were washed with 2.5% Tx-100 in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, at room temperature for 1 h to remove SDS, and subsequently incubated with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, at room temperature for 30 min. Thereafter, the gels for casein zymography were soaked in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C for 14 h. The gels for gelatin zymography were soaked in the above solution plus 2 μm ZnCl2 at 37 °C for 36 h. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R250. HCT116/MUC1 cells were treated with JSH-23 (10 μm) or DMSO for 30 h to examine their effects on the formation and nuclear translocation of the MUC1-CD/NF-κB p65 complex and uPA expression. HCT116/MUC1 cells were incubated with GM6001 (20 μm), amiloride (25 μm), JSH-23 (10 μm), or DMSO to examine the effect on cell invasion. In vitro cell migration and invasion assays were performed using transwell chambers (24-well culture plates) with polycarbonate membranes (pore size, 8.0 μm; Corning Inc, Corning, NY). The membrane was pre-coated with fibronectin (1 μg, Asahi Glass, Tokyo, Japan) and Matrigel (5 μg, BD Biosciences) for migration and invasion assays, respectively. The cells were suspended in serum-free medium containing 0.1% BSA and then seeded into the upper chambers. In some cases, the cells were treated with chemical inhibitors as described above. The lower wells were filled with medium containing 10% HI-FBS. After incubation for 20 h, the membranes were fixed with methanol and stained with a H&E solution, and then non-migrating or non-invading cells were removed with a cotton swab. The numbers of migrating or invading cells were determined in five random fields per membrane and the ratio defined by the following formula is referred as percent invasion. Percent invasion = mean number of invading cells/mean number of migrating cells × 100. Differences between two groups were assessed using Student's t test. Differences among three or more groups were evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey-Kramer or Dunnett test. Aberrant overexpression of MUC1 in various malignant tumors is correlated with a poor prognosis. To determine how MUC1 induces tumor progression, we generated MUC1-overexpressing cells by introducing human MUC1cDNA into a human colon cancer cell line, HCT116 cells (HCT116/MUC1), and performed microarray analysis of mRNA using HCT116/MUC1 and HCT116/Mock cells to identify the differently expressed mRNA in these cells. Among some genes that were differently expressed in the two types of cells, we focused on that of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), the expression of which was elevated about 2.4-fold in HCT116/MUC1 cells as compared with in HCT116/Mock cells (Fig. 1A), because uPA plays an essential role in tumor invasion. uPA expression in some cells expressing different levels of MUC1 was further investigated using a human lung epithelial cancer cell line, A549 cells, and a human ovary cancer cell line, SKOV3 cells. Since A549 cells express a low level of MUC1, MUC1-overexpressing cells (A54"
https://openalex.org/W2051926947,"Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domains are short sequence motifs that mediate nearly all protein-protein interactions between B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins in the intrinsic apoptotic cell death pathway. These sequences are found on both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic members, although their primary function is believed to be associated with induction of cell death. Here, we identify critical features of the BH3 domains of pro-survival proteins that distinguish them functionally from their pro-apoptotic counterparts. Biochemical and x-ray crystallographic studies demonstrate that these differences reduce the capacity of most pro-survival proteins to form high affinity ""BH3-in-groove"" complexes that are critical for cell death induction. Switching these residues for the corresponding residues in Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer (Bak) increases the binding affinity of isolated BH3 domains for pro-survival proteins; however, their exchange in the context of the parental protein causes rapid proteasomal degradation due to protein destabilization. This is supported by further x-ray crystallographic studies that capture elements of this destabilization in one pro-survival protein, Bcl-w. In pro-apoptotic Bak, we demonstrate that the corresponding distinguishing residues are important for its cell-killing capacity and antagonism by pro-survival proteins."

Form I Rubiscos are phylogenetically divided into green- and red-type. Some red-type enzymes have catalytically superior properties. Thus, understanding their folding and assembly is of considerable biotechnological interest. Folding of the green-type RbcL subunits in cyanobacteria is mediated by the GroEL/ES chaperonin system, and assembly to holoenzyme requires specialized chaperones such as RbcX and RAF1.

We find that the C-terminal β-hairpin extension of red-type RbcS, which is absent in green-type RbcS, is critical for efficient assembly. The β-hairpins of four RbcS subunits form an eight-stranded β-barrel that protrudes into the central solvent channel of the RbcL core complex.

They differed considerably from other Gram-negative bacteria in regards to the backbone structure, the number of ester-linked long chain hydroxylated fatty acids, as well as the presence of a tertiary residue that consisted of at least one molecule of carboxyl-bacteriohopanediol or its 2-methyl derivative. The structural details of this type of lipid A were established using one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, chemical composition analyses, and mass spectrometry techniques (electrospray ionization Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and MALDI-TOF-MS). In these lipid A samples the glucosamine disaccharide characteristic for enterobacterial lipid A was replaced by a 2,3-diamino-2,3-dideoxy-d-glucopyranosyl-(GlcpN3N) disaccharide, deprived of phosphate residues, and substituted by an α-d-Manp-(1→6)-α-d-Manp disaccharide substituting C-4′ of the non-reducing (distal) GlcpN3N, and one residue of galacturonic acid (d-GalpA) α-(1→1)-linked to the reducing (proximal) amino sugar residue. Amide-linked 12:0(3-OH) and 14:0(3-OH) were identified. Some hydroxy groups of these fatty acids were further esterified by long (ω-1)-hydroxylated fatty acids comprising 26–34 carbon atoms. As confirmed by mass spectrometry techniques, these long chain fatty acids could form two or three acyloxyacyl residues. The triterpenoid derivatives were identified as 34-carboxyl-bacteriohopane-32,33-diol and 34-carboxyl-2β-methyl-bacteriohopane-32,33-diol and were covalently linked to the (ω-1)-hydroxy group of very long chain fatty acid in bradyrhizobial lipid A.

The triterpenoid derivatives were identified as 34-carboxyl-bacteriohopane-32,33-diol and 34-carboxyl-2β-methyl-bacteriohopane-32,33-diol and were covalently linked to the (ω-1)-hydroxy group of very long chain fatty acid in bradyrhizobial lipid A. Bradyrhizobium japonicum possessed lipid A species with two hopanoid residues. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an integral component of most Gram-negative bacteria cell envelopes. LPS is usually composed of three domains: lipid A, a hydrophobic part that anchors the LPS molecule in the outer membrane and constitutes their outer leaflet, the core oligosaccharide, and very often the O-specific polysaccharide (O-chain). Such LPS is called smooth, found, for example, in Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Bradyrhizobium yuanmingense, and Bradyrhizobium sp. (Lupinus). LPS composed only of lipid A and the core oligosaccharide is called rough. The semi-rough form additionally containing one repeating unit of O-chain was found in Bradyrhizobium elkanii and Bradyrhizobium liaoningense strains (1.Komaniecka I. Zdzisinska B. Kandefer-Szerszen M. Choma A. Endotoxic activity of lipopolysaccharides isolated from Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium and Azospirillum strains.Microbiol. Immunol. 2010; 54: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Bradyrhizobia are a slow-growing rhizobia forming a beneficial symbiosis with legumes. The endosymbiotic form of rhizobia, in which nitrogen fixation takes place, is called bacteroids. Rhizobial LPS plays an essential role in symbiosis progression. Together with membrane proteins and lipids favors optimal membrane architecture and determine its permeability, important for the morphology and functionality of bacteroids. Several reports demonstrated that the proper structure of rhizobial LPS is essential for root hair infection, nodule invasion, and adaptation to the endosymbiotic conditions (2.de Maagd R.A. Rao A.S.

The LPS also protects microsymbiont cells against plant defense responses, i.e. hypersensitivity reaction and systemic acquired resistance, by suppressing such reactions during rhizobial infection (6.Dow M.

Toxic enterobacterial lipid A consists of a β-(1→6)-linked glucosaminyl disaccharide substituted by two phosphate groups at positions C-1 and C-4′. Six fatty acid residues, which form two acyloxyacyl moieties, are linked in distinct positions to the sugar backbone (9.Zähringer U. Lindner B. Rietschel E.Th. Chemical structure of lipid A: recent advances in structural analysis of biologically active molecules.in: Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease.

The activity of such lipid A results from binding to the TLR4-MD2 receptor complex on macrophages and endothelial cells (11.Park B.S. Song D.H. Kim H.M. Choi B.-S. Lee H. Lee J.-O. The structural basis of lipopolysaccharide recognition by the TLR4–MD-2 complex.Nature. 2009; 458: 1191-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). Activation of TLR4-MD2 initiates a signaling cascade, which results in biosynthesis of pro-inflammatory mediators by macrophages. In severe cases this may lead to septic shock (12.Beutler B. Rietschel E.T. Innate immune sensing and its roots: the story of endotoxin.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). It was proven that, in humans, only such a lipid A structure is able to activate TLR4-MD2, determined by the set of fatty acids, their length, linkages, and spatial conformation (i.e. the presence of two acyloxyacyl residues) (10.Raetz C.R.

In lipid A samples, the structures of which differ from such enterobacterial ones, are usually less or not toxic in humans (1.Komaniecka I. Zdzisinska B. Kandefer-Szerszen M. Choma A.

The backbone of rhizobial lipid A can be composed either of a glucosaminyl-(d-GlcpN) or a 2,3-diamino-2,3-dideoxy-glucosaminyl-(d-GlcpN3N) disaccharide. In some Rhizobium species, the reducing residue of glucosamine-containing lipid A may be oxidized to 2-aminogluconate (16.Bhat U.R. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W.

The sugar backbone of lipid A can be decorated by phosphate, uronic acid, or mannose residues. The amino groups of d-GlcpN3N and d-GlcpN as well as C-3 and C-3′ of d-GlcpN are substituted by 3-hydroxy fatty acids. Hydroxyl groups of the primary fatty acids can be further substituted by nonpolar or very long chain (ω-1)-hydroxy VLCFAs, 2The abbreviations used are: VLCFAvery long chain (ω-1)-hydroxy fatty acidsCOSY1H/1H correlation spectroscopyDQF-COSY1H/1H double quantum filtered correlation spectroscopyd-GlcpNd-glucosamined-GlcpN3N2,3-dideoxy-2,3-diamino-d-glucoseESIelectrospray ionizationFT-ICR MSFourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometryHMBC1H/13C heteronuclear multiple quantum correlationHSQC-DEPT1H/13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence-distortionless enhancement by polarization transferHSQCndnon-decoupled HSQC spectrumROESYrotating frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopyTLR4-MD-2Toll-like receptor 4 and myeloid differentiation factor 2 complexTOCSY1H/1H total correlation spectroscopy. forming acyloxy-acyl moieties (17.Gil-Serrano A.M.

The structure of lipid A isolated from B. elkanii USDA 76 has been described in detail recently (21.Komaniecka I. Choma A. Lindner B. Holst O. The structure of a novel neutral lipid A from the lipopolysaccharide of Bradyrhizobium elkanii containing three mannoses units in the backbone.Chem.-Eur. J. 2010; 16: 2922-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It differs considerably not only from other Gram-negative bacteria but also from other rhizobial lipid A samples. The sugar backbone is constituted by five sugar units identified as two diaminoglucoses and three mannoses. There are four amide-linked fatty acids (two 12:0(3-OH) and two 14:0(3-OH)) in this lipid A. Two of them are substituted by two VLCFA hydroxylated fatty acids, forming acyloxy-acyl residues. Additionally, one of them can be further acylated by 3-hydroxybutyric acid, linked to the (ω-1) hydroxy group. In this article we present the unique lipid A structure from different Bradyrhizobium strains, which form two or three acyloxyacyl moieties with VLCFAs and also contain one or two hopanoid residues linked covalently as tertiary hydrophobic residue(s) to the hydroxy group(s) of (ω-1)-hydroxy fatty acids. Hopanoids are a class of pentacyclic triterpenoid lipids occurring in a wide range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Squalene and different species of hopanoid derivatives were discovered in Streptomyces spp., ethanol-tolerant bacterium Zymomonas mobilis, purple non-sulfur bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris, and Rhodomicrobium vanniellii, Methylococcus capsulatus, nitrogen-fixing Azotobacter and Beijerinckia, in symbiotic nitrogen-fixing Frankia and a wide group of Bradyrhizobium strains (26.Neunlist S.

Hopanoids play a role in membrane integrity and pH homeostasis in Rhodopseudomonas palustris TIE-1.J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 6145-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Hopanoid lipids are thought to stabilize the phospholipid plasma membranes, sharing this function with eukaryotic sterols (31.Rohmer M. Bouvier P. Ourisson G. Molecular evolution of biomembranes: structural equivalents and phylogenetic precursors of sterols.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 847-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In nitrogen-fixing bacteria this lipid component may have additional functions, besides membrane reinforcement. It has been proven that in Frankia, hopanoids can be involved in oxygen protection of the nitrogenase complex by forming of a diffusion barrier (27.Berry A.M. Harriott O.T. Moreau R.A. Osman S.F. Benson D.R. Jones A.D. Hopanoid lipids compose the Frankia vesicle envelope, presumptive barrier of oxygen diffusion to nitrogenase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 6091-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In the case of Rh. palustris the bacteriohopane polyols determine membrane integrity and play a role in pH homeostasis (30.Welander P.V. Hunter R.C. Zhang L. Sessions A.L. Summons R.E. Newman D.K. Hopanoids play a role in membrane integrity and pH homeostasis in Rhodopseudomonas palustris TIE-1.J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 6145-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Very recently, the first hopanoid-containing lipid A, obtained from LPS of the photosynthetic Bradyrhizobium strain BTAi1, was structurally and functionally characterized (32.Silipo A. Vitiello G.

(Lupinus) USDA 3045) were grown at 28 °C in 79CA medium according to Vincent (33.Vincent M. A manual for the practical study of root-nodule bacteria.in: International Biological Programme, Handbook No. 15. Blackwell, Oxford1970Google Scholar), for 14 days, with aeration by vigorous shaking. The cell pellets obtained by centrifugation were washed twice with saline, once with distilled water, and then delipidation was performed according to Que and co-workers (19.Que N.L. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. Purification and mass spectrometry of six lipid A species from the bacterial endosymbiont Rhizobium etli.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28006-28016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The delipidated and dried cell pellets were suspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), supplemented with 5 mm EDTA, and digested with lysozyme (6 mg g−1 dry mass, 4 °C, 16 h). The nucleic acids were degraded by treatment with DNase and RNase (0.3 mg g−1 dry mass, 37 °C, 30 min). Cell proteins were digested by incubation with proteinase K (0.3 mg g−1 dry mass, room temperature, for 18 h, followed by incubation for 10 min at 60 °C) (34.Reitz M. Rudolph K. Schröder I. Hoffmann-Hergarten S. Hallmann J. Sikora R.A.

Microbiol. 2000; 66: 3515-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The LPS preparations were obtained from hot 45% phenol/water extractions according to Westphal and Jann (35.Westphal O. Jann K. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide: extraction with phenol-water and further application of the procedure.in: Whistler R.L. Methods in Carbohydrate Chemistry. 5.

Microbiol. 1976; 22: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The phenol and water phases, which contained LPS, were dialyzed extensively against tap and distilled water. Pure LPS preparations were obtained by ultracentrifugation (105,000 × g, 4 °C, 4 h). The LPS was obtained from water phase after phenol/water extraction, 820 mg (5.8%) in the case of B. japonicum, 148 mg (1.4%) in the case of B. yaunmingense, and 344 mg (5.7%) in the case of Bradyrhizobium sp. (Lupinus). Lipid A was liberated from LPS by mild acid hydrolysis (1–2% aqueous acetic acid, 100 °C, 2–3 h). The free lipid A was purified by a two-phase Bligh-Dyer system according to Que et al. (19.Que N.L. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. Purification and mass spectrometry of six lipid A species from the bacterial endosymbiont Rhizobium etli.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28006-28016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, adequate amounts of chloroform and methanol were added to the hydrolysate to obtain a chloroform/methanol/hydrolysate, 2:2:1.8 (v/v/v), mixture. The mixture was vigorously shaken and then centrifuged. The chloroform phase, containing lipid A, was collected and washed twice with the water phase from the freshly prepared two-phase Bligh-Dyer mixture (chloroform/methanol/water, 2:2:1.8 (v/v/v)). The pure lipid A preparations (B. japonicum, 36 mg; B. yuanmingense, 18 mg; Bradyrhizobium sp. (Lupinus), 12 mg) were stored at −20 °C in CHCl3/MeOH (3:1, v/v). O-Deacylation of lipid A samples was performed by incubation (1–2 mg) in chloroform, methanol, 0.6 m aqueous NaOH, 2:3:1 (v/v/v), for 1.5 h at room temperature, according to Que-Gewirth and co-workers (37.Que-Gewirth N.L.

Chem. 2004; 279: 25420-25429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For total fatty acid and hopanoid lipids determination, lipid A preparations were subjected to hydrolysis in 4 m HCl (100 °C, 4 h). Liberated fatty acids and hopanoids were extracted with chloroform and converted to their methyl esters with diazomethane. After evaporation to dryness, hydroxyl groups of fatty acids and hopanoid lipids were derivatized with BSTFA (16 h at room temperature). Neutral and amino sugar analyses were performed according to standard protocols described elsewhere (21.Komaniecka I. Choma A. Lindner B. Holst O. The structure of a novel neutral lipid A from the lipopolysaccharide of Bradyrhizobium elkanii containing three mannoses units in the backbone.Chem.-Eur. J. 2010; 16: 2922-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). GC-MS analyses of fatty acids and sugars were performed on a Hewlett Packard gas chromatograph 5890 series II and Agilent Technologies GC System 7890A connected to a mass selective detector EI/CI MSD 5975C, equipped with a HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm) with helium as a carrier gas (flow rate: 0.7 ml min−1). The temperature program was as follows: 150 °C for 3 min, then raised to 250 °C at 3 °C min−1, then to 320 °C, 25 °C min−1. The final temperature was kept for 10 min for sugar analysis and 20 min for fatty acid analysis. Lipid A samples obtained from B. japonicum were analyzed on a high resolution hybrid Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR) instrument (Apex Qe Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) with electrospray ionization (ESI), equipped with a 7 tesla actively shielded magnet. Samples for analysis were prepared as described earlier (21.Komaniecka I. Choma A. Lindner B. Holst O. The structure of a novel neutral lipid A from the lipopolysaccharide of Bradyrhizobium elkanii containing three mannoses units in the backbone.Chem.-Eur.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) was performed with a Bruker-Daltonics Reflex III instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV and delayed ion extraction. Lipid A preparations were dispersed in methanol/water (1:1, v/v) at a concentration of 1 μg/μl with addition of 20 mm EDTA. The matrix solution was prepared from 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 1% trifluoroacetic acid and the spectra were recorded in positive or negative ion modes. For NMR analysis a sample containing 18 mg of native lipid A from B. japonicum dissolved in 0.6 ml of CDCl3/CD3OD (2:1, v/v) with 5 μl of D2O, was used. One- and two-dimensional NMR spectra were recorded at 700 MHz on an AVANCE III spectrometer with Cryoprobe (Bruker) using Bruker software. Spectra were recorded at 27 °C. The following two-dimensional NMR experiments were performed: COSY, DQF-COSY, TOCSY, ROESY, HSQCnd, HSQC-DEPT, and HMBC. The 1H and 13C resonances were measured relative to TMS (δH 0.0/δC 0.0). LPS of Bradyrhizobium strains were isolated using hot phenol/water extraction. The material was found mainly in the water phase (for yields see ”Experimental Procedures“). Lipid A was liberated from LPS by mild acid hydrolysis and subsequently subjected to sugar and fatty acid analyses. d-GlcpN3N was the only amino sugar component. A high amount of mannose (d-Manp) was also present in all lipid A preparations, whereas only small amounts of galacturonic acid (d-GalpA) were detected. Fatty acid analysis revealed the presence of two amide-linked 3-hydroxy fatty acids, i.e. 12:0(3-OH) and 14:0(3-OH). Ester-linked VLCFAs with chain lengths of 26–34 carbon atoms were identified as well (Table 1). The most abundant VLCFAs of strain B. japonicum were 26:0(25-OH), 32:0(31-OH), and 33:0(32-OH). Lipid A from B. yuanmingense and Bradyrhizobium sp.

https://openalex.org/W2068239262,"Flor yeasts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have an innate diversity of FLO11 which codes for a highly hydrophobic and anionic cell-wall glycoprotein with a fundamental role in biofilm formation. In this study, 380 nitrogen compounds were administered to three S. cerevisiae flor strains handling FLO11 alleles with different expression levels. S. cerevisiae strain S288c was used as the reference strain as it cannot produce FLO11p. The flor strains generally metabolized amino acids and dipeptides as the sole nitrogen source, although with some exceptions regarding L-histidine and histidine containing dipeptides. L-histidine completely inhibited growth and its effect on viability was inversely related to FLO11 expression. Accordingly, L-histidine did not affect the viability of the Δflo11 and S288c strains. Also, L-histidine dramatically decreased air–liquid biofilm formation and adhesion to polystyrene of the flor yeasts with no effect on the transcription level of the FLO11 gene. Moreover, L-histidine modified the chitin and glycans content on the cell-wall of flor yeasts. These findings reveal a novel biological activity of L-histidine in controlling the multicellular behavior of yeasts."
https://openalex.org/W1978289178,"The pearl oyster, Pinctada fucata (P. fucata), is one of the marine bivalves that is predominantly cultured for pearl production. To obtain more genetic information for breeding purposes, we constructed a high-density linkage map of P. fucata and identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) for growth-related traits. One F1 family, which included the two parents, 48 largest progeny and 50 smallest progeny, was sampled to construct a linkage map using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq). With low coverage data, 1956.53 million clean reads and 86,342 candidate RAD loci were generated. A total of 1373 segregating SNPs were used to construct a sex-average linkage map. This spanned 1091.81 centimorgans (cM), with 14 linkage groups and an average marker interval of 1.41 cM. The genetic linkage map coverage, Coa, was 97.24%. Thirty-nine QTL-peak loci, for seven growth-related traits, were identified using the single-marker analysis, nonparametric mapping Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test. Parameters included three for shell height, six for shell length, five for shell width, four for hinge length, 11 for total weight, eight for soft tissue weight and two for shell weight. The QTL peak loci for shell height, shell length and shell weight were all located in linkage group 6. The genotype frequencies of most QTL peak loci showed significant differences between the large subpopulation and the small subpopulation (P<0.05). These results highlight the effectiveness of RAD-Seq as a tool for generation of QTL-targeted and genome-wide marker data in the non-model animal, P. fucata, and its possible utility in marker-assisted selection (MAS)."
https://openalex.org/W2013271840,"Toll-like receptor signaling, mediated by functional Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains, plays a critical role in activating the innate immune response responsible for controlling and clearing infection. Bacterial protein mimics of components of this signaling pathway have been identified and function through inhibition of interactions between Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and their adaptor proteins, mediated by TIR domains. A previously uncharacterized gene, which we have named tcpF (for TIR domain-containing protein in E. faecalis) was identified in the genome of Enterococcus faecalis V583, and predicted to encode a protein resembling mammalian and bacterial TIR proteins. We overexpressed and purified TcpF from E. coli and found that the recombinant protein could bind to phosphatidylinositol phosphates in vitro, suggesting a mechanism by which TcpF may be anchored to the plasma membrane in close proximity to TIR domains of TLRs and adaptor proteins. Purified TcpF was also found to interact specifically with the TIR adaptor protein MyD88, and this interaction was dependent on the BB loop domain in the Box 2 region of TcpF. Despite no evidence of TcpF being a secreted protein, recombinant TcpF was effectively able to enter RAW264.7 cells in vitro although the mechanism by which this occurs remains to be determined. Overexpression of TcpF in mammalian cells suppressed the NF-κB activation induced by bacterial lipoteichoic acid. A mutant lacking the tcpF gene was attenuated for survival in macrophages, with increased ability to activate NF-κB compared to the wild type strain. Complementation in trans restored growth, and inhibition of NF-κB, to that of wild type levels. No appreciable difference in bacterial persistence, dissemination or pathogenesis was observed between the wild type and mutant in a mouse peritonitis model however, which suggested either a subtle role for TcpF or functional overlap with other redundant factor(s) in this virulence model."

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of PET with (11)C-acetate for MS diagnosis.Six patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 6 healthy volunteers (HV) were enrolled. The (11)C-acetate brain uptake on PET was measured in patients with MS and HV. Volume-of-interest analysis of cerebral gray and white matter based on the segmentation technique for co-registered MRI and voxel-based statistical parametric analysis were performed. Correlation between 11C-acetate uptake and the lesion number in T1- and T2- weighted MR images were also assessed.The standardized uptake value (SUV) of 11C-acetate was increased in both white and gray matter in MS patients compared to HV. Voxel-based statistical analysis revealed a significantly increased SUV relative to that in the bilateral thalami (SUVt) in a broad area of white matter, particularly in the subcortical white matter of MS patients. The numbers of T2 lesions and T1 black holes were significantly correlated with SUV of (11)C-acetate in white and gray matter.The 11C-acetate uptake significantly increased in MS patients and correlated to the number of MRI lesions. These preliminary data suggest that (11)C-acetate PET can be a useful clinical examination for MS patients."

This study aimed to examine the relationship between disease-specific funding levels of National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC), the main governmental resource for health research in China, and burden of disease.Funding magnitudes for 53 diseases or conditions were obtained from the website of NSFC. Measures of disease burden, mortality, years of life lost (YLLs) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), were derived from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010. The relationship between NSFC funding and disease burden was analyzed with univariate linear regression. For each measure associated with funding, regression-derived estimates were used to calculate the expected funds for each disease. The actual and expected funds were then compared. We also evaluated the impacts of changes of disease burden metrics since 1990, and differences from the world averages on NSFC funding.NSFC health research funding was associated with disease burden measured in mortality (R = 0.33, P = 0.02), YLLs (R = 0.39, P = 0.004), and DALYs (R = 0.40, P = 0.003). But none of the changes of mortality (R = 0.22, P = 0.12), YLLs (R = -0.04, P = 0.79) and DALYs (R = -0.003, P = 0.98) since 1990 was associated with the funding magnitudes. None of the differences of mortality (R = -0.11, P = 0.45), YLLs (R = -0.11, P = 0.43) and DALYs (R = -0.12, P = 0.38) from that of the concurrent world averages were associated with the funding magnitudes. Measured by DALY, stroke and COPD received the least funding compared to expected; while leukemia and diabetes received the most funding compared to expected.Although NSFC funding were roughly associated with disease burden as measured in mortality, YLLs and DALYs. Some major diseases such as stroke were underfunded; while others such as leukaemia were overfunded. Change of disease burden during the last 20 years and country-specialized disease burden were not reflected in current allocation of NSFC funds."
https://openalex.org/W2048201531,"Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family. The receptor is activated upon binding to its ligand, collagen, and plays a crucial role in many fundamental processes such as cell differentiation, adhesion, migration and invasion. Although DDR1 is expressed in many normal tissues, upregulated expression of DDR1 in a variety of human cancers such as lung, colon and brain cancers is known to be associated with poor prognosis. Using shRNA silencing, we assessed the oncogenic potential of DDR1. DDR1 knockdown impaired tumor cell proliferation and migration in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Microarray analysis of tumor cells demonstrated upregulation of TGFBI expression upon DDR1 knockdown, which was subsequently confirmed at the protein level. TGFBI is a TGFβ-induced extracellular matrix protein secreted by the tumor cells and is known to act either as a tumor promoter or tumor suppressor, depending on the tumor environment. Here, we show that exogenous addition of recombinant TGFBI to BXPC3 tumor cells inhibited clonogenic growth and migration, thus recapitulating the phenotypic effect observed from DDR1 silencing. BXPC3 tumor xenografts demonstrated reduced growth with DDR1 knockdown, and the same xenograft tumors exhibited an increase in TGFBI expression level. Together, these data suggest that DDR1 expression level influences tumor growth in part via modulation of TGFBI expression. The reciprocal expression of DDR1 and TGFBI may help to elucidate the contribution of DDR1 in tumorigenesis and TGFBI may also be used as a biomarker for the therapeutic development of DDR1 specific inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2091627255,"The aim of our study was to relate four modifiable lifestyle factors (smoking status, body mass index, physical activity and diet) to health expectancy, using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in a prospective cohort study. Data of the prospective EPIC-NL study were used, including 33,066 healthy men and women aged 20-70 years at baseline (1993-7), followed until 31-12-2007 for occurrence of disease and death. Smoking status, body mass index, physical activity and adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet (excluding alcohol) were investigated separately and combined into a healthy lifestyle score, ranging from 0 to 4. QALYs were used as summary measure of healthy life expectancy, combining a person's life expectancy with a weight for quality of life when having a chronic disease. For lifestyle factors analyzed separately the number of years living longer in good health varied from 0.12 year to 0.84 year, after adjusting for covariates. A combination of the four lifestyle factors was positively associated with higher QALYs (P-trend <0.0001). A healthy lifestyle score of 4 compared to a score of 0 was associated with almost a 2 years longer life in good health (1.75 QALYs [95% CI 1.37, 2.14])."
https://openalex.org/W1970442309,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative illness often characterized by asymmetrical symptoms. However, the reason for this asymmetry and the cerebral correlates underlying symptom asymmetry are still not well understood. Furthermore, the effects of levodopa on the cerebral correlates of disease asymmetry have not been investigated. In this study, right-handed PD patients performed self-initiated, externally triggered and repetitive control finger movements with both their right and left hands during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate asymmetrical effects of levodopa on the hemodynamic correlates of finger movements. Patients completed two experimental sessions OFF and ON medication after a minimum of 12 hours medication withdrawal. We compared the effect of levodopa on the neural activation patterns underlying the execution of both the more affected and less affected hand for self-initiated and externally triggered movements. Our results show that levodopa led to larger differences in cerebral activity for movements of the more affected, left side: there were significant differences in activity after levodopa administration in regions of the motor cortico-striatal network when patients performed self-initiated and externally triggered movements with their left hand. By contrast, when patients used their right hand, levodopa led to differences in cerebellar activity only. As our patients were affected more severely on their left side, we propose that levodopa may help provide additional dopaminergic input, improving movements for the more severely affected side. These results suggest that the impact of reduced dopamine in the cortico-striatal system and the action of levodopa is not symmetrical."
https://openalex.org/W1984101286,"Globally, India contributes the largest share in sheer numbers to the burden of maternal and infant under-nutrition, morbidity and mortality. A major gap in our knowledge is how socio-cultural practices and beliefs influence the perinatal period and thus perinatal outcomes, particularly in the rapidly growing urban setting.Using data from a qualitative study in urban south India, including in-depth interviews with 36 women who had recently been through childbirth as well as observations of family life and clinic encounters, we explored the territory of familial, cultural and traditional practices and beliefs influencing women and their families through pregnancy, childbirth and infancy. We found that while there were some similarities in cultural practices to those described before in studies from low resource village settings, there are changing practices and ideas. Fertility concerns dominate women's experience of married life; notions of gender preference and ideal family size are changing rapidly in response to the urban context; however inter-generational family pressures are still considerable. While a rich repertoire of cultural practices persists throughout the perinatal continuum, their existence is normalised and even underplayed. In terms of diet and nutrition, traditional messages including notions of 'hot' and 'cold' foods, are stronger than health messages; however breastfeeding is the cultural norm and the practice of delayed breastfeeding appears to be disappearing in this urban setting. Marriage, pregnancy and childbirth are so much part of the norm for women, that there is little expectation of individual choice in any of these major life events.A greater understanding is needed of the dynamic factors shaping the perinatal period in urban India, including an acknowledgment of the health promoting as well as potentially harmful cultural practices and the critical role of the family. This will help plan culturally appropriate integrated perinatal health care."
https://openalex.org/W1990949219,"Calcium/voltage-gated, large conductance potassium (BK) channels control numerous physiological processes, including myogenic tone. BK channel regulation by direct interaction between lipid and channel protein sites has received increasing attention. Leukotrienes (LTA4, LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4) are inflammatory lipid mediators. We performed patch clamp studies in Xenopus oocytes that co-expressed BK channel-forming (cbv1) and accessory β1 subunits cloned from rat cerebral artery myocytes. Leukotrienes were applied at 0.1 nm-10 μm to either leaflet of cell-free membranes at a wide range of [Ca(2+)]i and voltages. Only LTB4 reversibly increased BK steady-state activity (EC50 = 1 nm; Emax reached at 10 nm), with physiological [Ca(2+)]i and voltages favoring this activation. Homomeric cbv1 or cbv1-β2 channels were LTB4-resistant. Computational modeling predicted that LTB4 docked onto the cholane steroid-sensing site in the BK β1 transmembrane domain 2 (TM2). Co-application of LTB4 and cholane steroid did not further increase LTB4-induced activation. LTB4 failed to activate β1 subunit-containing channels when β1 carried T169A, A176S, or K179I within the docking site. Co-application of LTB4 with LTA4, LTC4, LTD4, or LTE4 suppressed LTB4-induced activation. Inactive leukotrienes docked onto a portion of the site, probably preventing tight docking of LTB4. In summary, we document the ability of two endogenous lipids from different chemical families to share their site of action on a channel accessory subunit. Thus, cross-talk between leukotrienes and cholane steroids might converge on regulation of smooth muscle contractility via BK β1. Moreover, the identification of LTB4 as a highly potent ligand for BK channels is critical for the future development of β1-specific BK channel activators."

Existing methods to assess the built environment using geographical information systems (GIS) data, direct audit or large surveys of the residents face constraints, such as data availability and comparability, when used to study communities in countries in diverse parts of the world. The aim of this study was to develop a method to evaluate features of the built environment of communities using a standard set of photos. In this report we describe the method of photo collection, photo analysis instrument development and inter-rater reliability of the instrument.A minimum of 5 photos were taken per community in 86 communities in 5 countries according to a standard set of instructions from a designated central point of each community by researchers at each site. A standard pro forma derived from reviewing existing instruments to assess the built environment was developed and used to score the characteristics of each community. Photo sets from each community were assessed independently by three observers in the central research office according to the pro forma and the inter-rater reliability was compared by intra-class correlation (ICC). Overall 87% (53 of 60) items had an ICC of ≥ 0.70, 7% (4 of 60) had an ICC between 0.60 and 0.70 and 5% (3 of 60) items had an ICC ≤ 0.50.Analysis of photos using a standardized protocol as described in this study offers a means to obtain reliable and reproducible information on the built environment in communities in very diverse locations around the world.

https://openalex.org/W2017861757,"Whether upper limb sensorimotor control is affected in schizophrenia and how underlying pathological mechanisms may potentially intervene in these deficits is still being debated. We tested voluntary force control in schizophrenia patients and used a computational model in order to elucidate potential cerebral mechanisms underlying sensorimotor deficits in schizophrenia. A visuomotor grip force-tracking task was performed by 17 medicated and 6 non-medicated patients with schizophrenia (DSM-IV) and by 15 healthy controls. Target forces in the ramp-hold-and-release paradigm were set to 5 N and to 10% maximal voluntary grip force. Force trajectory was analyzed by performance measures and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). A computational model incorporating neural control signals was used to replicate the empirically observed motor behavior and to explore underlying neural mechanisms. Grip task performance was significantly lower in medicated and non-medicated schizophrenia patients compared to controls. Three behavioral variables were significantly higher in both patient groups: tracking error (by 50%), coefficient of variation of force (by 57%) and duration of force release (up by 37%). Behavioral performance did not differ between patient groups. Computational simulation successfully replicated these findings and predicted that decreased motor inhibition, together with an increased signal-dependent motor noise, are sufficient to explain the observed motor deficits in patients. PCA also suggested altered motor inhibition as a key factor differentiating patients from control subjects: the principal component representing inhibition correlated with clinical severity. These findings show that schizophrenia affects voluntary sensorimotor control of the hand independent of medication, and suggest that reduced motor inhibition and increased signal-dependent motor noise likely reflect key pathological mechanisms of the sensorimotor deficit."
https://openalex.org/W2052846476,"Human embryonic stem cells and human embryonal carcinoma cells have been studied extensively with respect to the transcription factors (OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG), epigenetic modulators and associated signalling pathways that either promote self-renewal or induce differentiation in these cells. The ACTIVIN/NODAL axis (SMAD2/3) of the TGFß signalling pathway coupled with FGF signalling maintains self-renewal in these cells, whilst the BMP (SMAD1,5,8) axis promotes differentiation. Here we show that miR-27, a somatic-enriched miRNA, is activated upon RNAi-mediated suppression of OCT4 function in human embryonic stem cells. We further demonstrate that miR-27 negatively regulates the expression of the pluripotency-associated ACTIVIN/NODAL axis (SMAD2/3) of the TGFß signalling pathway by targeting ACVR2A, TGFßR1 and SMAD2. Additionally, we have identified a number of pluripotency-associated genes such as NANOG, LIN28, POLR3G and NR5A2 as novel miR-27 targets. Transcriptome analysis revealed that miR-27 over-expression in human embryonal carcinoma cells leads indeed to a significant up-regulation of genes involved in developmental pathways such as TGFß- and WNT-signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2054166860,"Accurate orthology prediction is crucial for many applications in the post-genomic era. The lack of broadly accepted benchmark tests precludes a comprehensive analysis of orthology inference. So far, functional annotation between orthologs serves as a performance proxy. However, this violates the fundamental principle of orthology as an evolutionary definition, while it is often not applicable due to limited experimental evidence for most species. Therefore, we constructed high quality ""gold standard"" orthologous groups that can serve as a benchmark set for orthology inference in bacterial species. Herein, we used this dataset to demonstrate 1) why a manually curated, phylogeny-based dataset is more appropriate for benchmarking orthology than other popular practices and 2) how it guides database design and parameterization through careful error quantification. More specifically, we illustrate how function-based tests often fail to identify false assignments, misjudging the true performance of orthology inference methods. We also examined how our dataset can instruct the selection of a “core” species repertoire to improve detection accuracy. We conclude that including more genomes at the proper evolutionary distances can influence the overall quality of orthology detection. The curated gene families, called Reference Orthologous Groups, are publicly available at http://eggnog.embl.de/orthobench2."

Hes3b can both bind DNA and form heterodimers. The expression of another member of the Hes/Hey gene family, Hes1, and of other basic helix-loop-helix factors exhibit an oscillatory pattern (2.Imayoshi I. Isomura A. Harima Y. Kawaguchi K. Kori H.

Oscillatory expression of the basic helix-loop-helix Ascl1 characterizes the self-renewing state, whereas sustained expression of specific genes results in fate determination, suggesting oscillatory versus sustained expression patterns are means of regulating cell fate.

Here, using a mouse insulinoma cell line (MIN6) and observations in isolated and dissociated/cultured mouse and human islets, we addressed possible functions of Hes3, which may be of interest to the field of diabetes. We showed that Hes3 is expressed in mouse and human pancreatic islets and that genetic manipulation of Hes3 in MIN6 cells affects gene expression; key genes regulated include insulin and pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1), a transcription factor involved in pancreatic development and diabetes (24.Fujimoto K. Polonsky K.S. Pdx1 and other factors that regulate pancreatic beta-cell survival.Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2009; 11: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition, Hes3 regulates the cell number and evoked insulin release. Using a Hes3 null mouse strain where the Hes3 gene was replaced by the reporter lacZ gene (25.Hirata H. Tomita K. Bessho Y. Kageyama R. Hes1 and Hes3 regulate maintenance of the isthmic organizer and development of the mid/hindbrain.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4454-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we confirmed Hes3 expression in the adult pancreatic islet and induction following streptozotocin (STZ)-induced damage, and showed that in the absence of Hes3, STZ-induced damage is more pronounced, as indicated by reduced beta cell number and increased blood glucose levels in vivo. Taken together, these findings suggest that Hes3 may have important roles in pancreatic islet function. MIN6 cells were grown in either serum containing medium (DMEM (Invitrogen, 61965-026), 15% fetal calf serum (Biochrom Superior, F0615), 70 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, M6250), 100 μg/ml of Pen-Strep (Invitrogen, 15140-122)), or serum-free N2 medium (DMEM-F12 (Sigma, D8062), 100 μg/ml of apo-transferrin (Sigma, T2036), 20 nm progesterone (Sigma, P8783), 100 μm putrescine (Sigma, P5780), 30 nm selenite (Sigma, S5261), and 100 μg/ml of Pen-Strep)). To examine changes in the properties of MIN6 cells under different culture conditions, cells were first maintained in serum containing medium for 5 days. Cells were then passaged and grown under serum-free conditions for another 5 days. The cells were then passaged again, back into serum containing medium (“RC” for return condition) for an additional 5 days prior to analysis. Serum and no serum controls were run in parallel in which the cells were maintained in either serum containing or serum-free conditions for the final 10 days of the experiment. For Exendin-4 treatments, cells were seeded at 50,000 cells/24-well plate well and treated with different concentrations of Exendin-4 (Biotrend, BP0111) beginning at 24 h after plating for different times, as indicated. For the sustained treatments, Exendin-4 was added every 2 days during medium changes, and cells were fixed and immunostained at day 5. In this paper, we denote serum-containing medium as “CC” (common conditions) and serum-free medium as “DC” (defined conditions). JAK inhibitor treatments were performed on MIN6 cells seeded at 50,000 cells/well in a 24-well plate in DC. The inhibitor (Calbiochem 420097) was added to the culture medium daily from day 1 to 5; cell fixation and visualization was on day 5. RNA was extracted from MIN6 cells grown in T75 flasks under the above mentioned culture conditions. For experiments using Hes3 siRNA, cells were transfected at 24 h after seeding. RNA integrity number for each sample was checked using Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Michigan). Quadruplicate samples from a single experiment were run in DNA microarray equipment (Affymetrix). Volcano plots, heat maps, and statistics were generated using the R-2.15.2 software. RNA was extracted from whole pancreas or MIN6 cells using the High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche Applied Science, 11828665001) and reverse transcribed using Promega M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, M170B). PCR was performed for total Hes3, Hes3a, Hes3b, Pdx1, insulin, and GAPDH (for primer list, please see below) using Dream Taq Green DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific, EP0711). MIN6 cells were grown in 6-well plates for 5 days, then lysed with 500 μl of CytoBuster Protein Extraction Reagent (Novagen, 71009-3) containing protease inhibitors (Sigma, P8340). Samples were resolved by Western blotting using standard techniques. Mouse pancreata were fixed by transcardial perfusion with 4% PFA followed by post-fixation overnight at 4 °C. Human isolated islets were fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min. The tissue was cryoprotected with 30% sucrose and embedded in OCT compound (Sakura, 4583). 12–14-μm sections were cut and mounted on glass slides. MIN6 cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 30 min. Both the sections and cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and blocked in 5% powdered milk and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS prior to incubation with primary antibody. Images were taken using a laser confocal microscope (LEICA, Germany). Tissue sections were washed 3 × 5 min in LacZ wash buffer (PBS, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, Sigma D6750, 0.002% Nonidet P-40, Roche 11754599001, and 2 mm MgCl2, Sigma 630063) and incubated overnight in LacZ staining buffer (LacZ buffer, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, Sigma, 736716; 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, Sigma, 702587) containing 2.45 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoxy-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-Gal, ROTH, R0404). Sections were then visualized using brightfield microscopy. MIN6 cell proliferation was determined 4 days after the final cell passage by incubating the cells with 10 μm EdU for 8 h followed by visualization using the Click-IT EdU Alexa Fluor 594 Imaging Kit (Invitrogen, C10339). Adherent MIN6 cells were cultured on sterile glass coverslips in CC, DC, and RC for 5 days. Cells were washed briefly with PBS and incubated with 4 μm Eth-D solution (LIVE/DEAD Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit for mammalian cells, Invitrogen, L-3224) for 30 min. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA and imaged. Combined glucose/KCl stimulated insulin production assay was performed on MIN6 cells as described in Ref. 26.Ort T. Voronov S. Guo J. Zawalich K.

Glucose concentrations were as follows: resting, 0 mm; stimulated, 25 mm. KCl concentrations were as follows: resting, 5 mm; stimulated, 55 mm. For these experiments, cells were maintained in a low KCl concentration (5 mm), which was not altered between resting and stimulated states. Glucose concentrations were as follows: resting, 2.8 mm; stimulated, 20 mm. MIN6 cells were plated at 50,000 cells/well in a 24-well plate. 24 h later, cells were transfected with Hes3 siRNA (2 μm final concentration in the culture medium) or scrambled control siRNA (Santa Cruz, sc-37942 and sc-37007) using DharmaFECT4 (Thermo Scientific, T-2004-001) as described by the manufacturer. Cells were assayed 12–24 h after transfection for changes in proliferation and in gene expression as determined by gene array analysis, immunocytochemistry, and Western blot. For Hes3 overexpression, MIN6 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 as described by the manufacturer with either pcDNA3.1 containing a C terminus GFP-tagged Hes3a gene or with an empty vector. Cells were cultured up to day 5, immunostained, and imaged using laser confocal microscopy. For high dose streptozotocin (Sigma, S0130) experiments, 8-week-old C57Bl/6J mice were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose of 150 mg/kg of streptozotocin or with PBS (vehicle control). For low dose streptozotocin experiments, 8-week-old C57Bl/6J mice were injected intraperitoneally with 5 daily doses of 50 mg/kg of streptozotocin or with PBS (vehicle control). Pancreata were extracted 4 weeks later. Pancreata were harvested from 10-month-old mice homozygous for the diabetes spontaneous mutations, Lepr db or Lep ob. C57Bl/6J mice served as control. C57BLKS/J mice were used as controls. 8-Week-old C57Bl/6J mice were administered a single 4-gray dose of irradiation for 3 min and 41 s. Pancreata were extracted 5 days after irradiation. One droplet of blood from a tail clip incision was placed on a glucose test strip and read using a glucometer (ACCU-CHEK Aviva, Roche Applied Science). Mice were fasted for 16 h (overnight) prior to the experiment. Glucose levels were measured 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after intraperitoneal injection of a 20% glucose solution (2 g of glucose/kg of body weight) (27.Phieler J. Chung K.J. Chatzigeorgiou A.

Mice were euthanized and injected with Working Enzyme solution (Dissociation buffer, Collagenase, Sigma, C7657) through the bile duct to perfuse the pancreas. Pancreas tissue was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C on a rocking platform at 100 rpm for dissociation. Dissociated tissue was washed with Quenching buffer (Hank's balanced salt solution, Invitrogen, 14025092; 10% FBS, Biochrom) and filtered. Different gradients of Ficoll (Sigma, F637) were applied to collect the islets. Islets were resuspended in Islet Culture Medium (CMRL 1066, Invitrogen, PL000676; 10% FBS Biochrom; PenStrep, Invitrogen). In this medium, hand-picking of islets was performed. Following this, islets were placed in the appropriate culture medium for experimentation as described under “Results.” Human isolated islets (4 preparations) were obtained by the Diabetes Research Group, King's College London, UK. Human pancreatic islets were washed 3 times with PBS at room temperature and dissociated using 0.05% trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen, 25300) for 2 min at 37 °C. Cells were then seeded at a density of 50,000 cells per well in a 24-well plate and cultured either in Islet Culture Medium (as described in mouse pancreatic islet isolation) or N2 medium for 48–72 h. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA, immunostained, and imaged. Results shown are the mean ± S.D. or S.E., as noted in the figure legends. Experiments were performed in triplicate, unless otherwise noted. Asterisks identify experimental groups that were significantly different (p value 0.05) from control groups by the Student's t test (paired, two-sided) (Microsoft Excel).

Hes3 immunolabeling of isolated adult human pancreatic islets showed expression of Hes3 (counterstained for glucagon, insulin, Pdx1, somatostatin, and Nkx6.1) (Fig. 1A). Western blot and PCR analysis confirmed Hes3 expression in protein and RNA extracts from isolated human (hu) and mouse (mu) pancreatic islets (Fig. 1, B and C). Isolated adult human pancreatic islets can be placed in culture for research or transplantation purposes (28.Ludwig B. Reichel A. Steffen A. Zimerman B. Schally A.V. Block N.L. Colton C.K. Ludwig S. Kersting S. Bonifacio E. Solimena M. Gendler Z. Rotem A. Barkai U. Bornstein S.R. Transplantation of human islets without immunosuppression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 19054-19058Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Typically, these cells are cultured in serum-containing media. However, in NSC cultures, serum inclusion in the culture medium opposes the nuclear localization of Hes3, and this may suppress transcriptional functions (9.Poser S.W. Park D.M. Androutsellis-Theotokis A. The STAT3-Ser/Hes3 signaling axis: an emerging regulator of endogenous regeneration and cancer growth.Front Physiol. 2013; 4: 273Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we cultured dissociated human islet cells in both commonly used serum-containing (“CC”) and serum-free, defined (“DC”) conditions. We point out that these two media compositions differ in various aspects, as detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” not only in terms of the presence or absence of serum. Under both conditions, cells grew efficiently and the cultures maintained expression of Pdx1, Nkx6.1, and insulin (Fig. 1, D and E). The incidence of cells with nuclear Hes3, the intensity of Hes3 label, the incidence of cells expressing insulin, and the incidence of cells co-expressing Hes3 and insulin was higher in DC than in CC (Fig. 1, F–I). Hes3 immunolabeling of the adult mouse pancreas showed that Hes3 is expressed in a significant proportion of beta and alpha cells (Fig. 1, J-K). (Insets are images of the cell nuclei stained with DAPI.) Hes3 immunofluorescence appeared postnatally at approximately day 8 and gradually increased until approximately day 20 (Fig. 1L). (Insets show merged channel images.) PCR analysis of total adult mouse pancreas confirmed the expression of both Hes3 isoforms (Hes3a and Hes3b) (Fig. 1M). To address functional roles of molecular mechanisms in pancreatic islet cells, the mouse insulinoma cell line MIN6 is a common tool that allows the assessment of cell growth and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (29.Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K.

MIN6 cells are typically cultured in CC. We also cultured them in DC to assess whether, like with the human cells, these conditions promote nuclear Hes3 expression. In some experiments, following growth in DC, we passaged cells back in serum-containing conditions (“RC”) to assess the reversibility of the cell state. Cells grew efficiently in all three conditions (Fig. 2A). (Percent of cells that incorporate EdU following an 8-h EdU pulse: CC: 47.7 ± 8.4%; DC: 15.0 ± 2.1%; RC: 49.8 ± 9.7%.) In CC and RC, no cells exhibited nuclear localization of Hes3. In contrast, in DC, ∼15% of cells exhibited strong nuclear Hes3 localization at each point in time (Fig. 2B). In DC, cells also exhibited a higher incidence of Pdx1 expression. Cells in all three conditions exhibited low cell death rates, as assessed by ethidium bromide incorporation.

https://openalex.org/W2004395617,"Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the ATXN3 gene. Although the principal genetic determinant of the age at onset (AAO) is the length of the expanded CAG repeat, the additional genetic contribution of MJD toward the AAO has mostly not yet been clarified. It was recently suggested in two independent studies that apolipoprotein E (APOE) might be associated with AAO variability in MJD patients. To identify the potential modifier effect of APOE polymorphisms on the AAO of MJD patients, 403 patients with MJD (confirmed by molecular tests) from eastern and southeastern China were enrolled in the present study. CAG repeats in the ATXN3 and APOE polymorphisms were genotyped. Data were analyzed using a statistical package. No contribution of APOE polymorphisms to the variance in disease onset was observed using ANCOVA (F = 0.183, P = 0.947). However, significant effects on the AAO of MJD were found for the normal ATXN3 allele and for the interaction of mutant and normal ATXN3 alleles in a multiple linear regression model (P = 0.043 and P = 0.035, respectively). Our study does not support a role for APOE as a genetic modifier of the AAO of MJD. Additionally, our study presents evidence that the normal ATXN3 allele and its interaction with mutant alleles contribute toward AAO variance in MJD patients."

The role of the redox potential as a factor contributing to the NO-generating activity of these two proteins is evaluated. The results show that LtHb undergoes the same reactions as HbA and that the reduced efficacy for these reactions for LtHb relative to HbA is consistent with the much higher redox potential of LtHb.

Evidence of functional heterogeneity in LtHb is explained in terms of the large difference in the redox potential of the isolated subunits. Earthworm hemoglobin (LtHb) is a potential blood substitute. LtHb can generate nitric oxide (NO) and preserve NO bioactivity. LtHb reactions with nitrite and NO are indicative of therapeutic possibilities."
https://openalex.org/W2140017729,"Studies of the evolution of collective behavior consider the payoffs of individual versus social learning. We have previously proposed that the relative magnitude of social versus individual learning could be compared against the transparency of payoff, also known as the “transparency” of the decision, through a heuristic, two-dimensional map. Moving from west to east, the estimated strength of social influence increases. As the decision maker proceeds from south to north, transparency of choice increases, and it becomes easier to identify the best choice itself and/or the best social role model from whom to learn (depending on position on east–west axis). Here we show how to parameterize the functions that underlie the map, how to estimate these functions, and thus how to describe estimated paths through the map. We develop estimation methods on artificial data sets and discuss real-world applications such as modeling changes in health decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2071842132,"A monoclonal antibody (McAb) against non-structural protein (NSP) 3B of foot-mouth-disease virus (FMDV) (3B4B1) was generated and shown to recognize a conserved epitope spanning amino acids 24-32 of 3B (GPYAGPMER) by peptide screening ELISA. This epitope was further shown to be a unique and predominant B cell epitope in 3B2, as sera from animals infected with different serotypes of FMDV blocked the ability of McAb 3B4B1 to bind to NSP 2C3AB. Also, a polyclonal antibody against NSP 2C was produced in a rabbit vaccinated with 2C epitope regions expressed in E. coli. Using McAb 3B4B1 and the 2C polyclonal antibody, a solid-phase blocking ELISA (SPB-ELISA) was developed for the detection of antibodies against NSP 2C3AB to distinguish FMDV-infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA test). The parameters for this SPB-ELISA were established by screening panels of sera of different origins. Serum samples with a percent inhibition (PI) greater than or equal to 46% were considered to be from infected animals, and a PI lower than 46% was considered to indicate a non-infected animal. This test showed a similar performance as the commercially available PrioCHECK NS ELISA. This is the first description of the conserved and predominant GPYAGPMER epitope of 3B and also the first report of a DIVA test for FMDV NSP 3B based on a McAb against this epitope."
https://openalex.org/W2098679222,"Murine models for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) research can provide important insights for understanding RA pathogenesis and evaluating the efficacy of novel treatments. However, simultaneously imaging both murine articular cartilage and subchondral bone using conventional techniques is challenging because of low spatial resolution and poor soft tissue contrast. X-ray phase-contrast imaging (XPCI) is a new technique that offers high spatial resolution for the visualisation of cartilage and skeletal tissues. The purpose of this study was to utilise XPCI to observe articular cartilage and subchondral bone in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) murine model and quantitatively assess changes in the joint microstructure. XPCI was performed on the two treatment groups (the control group and CIA group, n = 9 per group) to monitor the progression of damage to the femur from the knee joint in a longitudinal study (at 0, 4 and 8 weeks after primary injection). For quantitative assessment, morphologic parameters were measured in three-dimensional (3D) images using appropriate image analysis software. Our results showed that the average femoral cartilage volume, surface area and thickness were significantly decreased (P<0.05) in the CIA group compared to the control group. Meanwhile, these decreases were accompanied by obvious destruction of the surface of subchondral bone and a loss of trabecular bone in the CIA group. This study confirms that XPCI technology has the ability to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate microstructural changes in mouse joints. This technique has the potential to become a routine analysis method for accurately monitoring joint damage and comprehensively assessing treatment efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2064954791,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic and systemic disease and its developmental process involves the synergism of multiple risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, obesity and smoking. The diagnosis of subclinical atherosclerosis is essential for strategic guidance towards suitable treatments and efficient prevention against acute cardiovascular events. This study employed ultrasound radiofrequency (RF) tracking technology to characterize human carotid arteries in vivo in terms of intima-media thickness (IMT) and artery stiffness, and evaluated the statistical correlation between carotid IMT and stiffness, and the number of risk factors for atherosclerosis.A total of 160 asymptomatic subjects were enrolled. Ultrasound RF-tracking technology was employed to acquire carotid IMT and stiffness parameters: maximum IMT ((MAX)IMT), RF Quality IMT ((RF)QIMT), distensibility coefficient (DC), compliance coefficient (CC), αindex, β index and local pulse wave velocity (PWVβ). The subjects were categorized in four groups in terms of the number of risk factors: 'zero', 'single', 'double', and 'multiple', and statistical analyses of carotid IMT and stiffness parameters were performed between these different groups.The subjects (n = 145) with (MAX)IMT smaller than 1.0 mm matched the IMT criteria for non-atherosclerosis and were named as NA-subjects. Spearman's rho correlation analysis of the whole group and the NA-subjects both showed that (MAX)IMT correlated positively with (RF)QIMT, α, β, and PWVβ, and negatively with DC and CC (p<0.01). The analysis of covariance of NA-subjects showed significant differences between subjects with and without risk factors, and also showed significant differences between the 'zero', 'single', 'double', and 'multiple' groups.The carotid IMT and stiffness parameters obtained by the ultrasound RF-tracking technology were demonstrated to possess significant statistical correlation with the number of risk factors from 160 subjects, and these anatomical and mechanical parameters may potentially be used together with the IMT criteria to support subclinical atherosclerosis diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2021292585,"The development of dendritic cell based vaccines is a promising approach in cancer immunotherapy. For their successful use in the clinics, the propagation and functionality of DCs is crucial. We earlier established a two-step method for the large scale generation of DCs from umbilical cord blood derived MNCs/CD34+ cells. This work aims at improving their functionality based on the following observations: in vitro generated DCs can be less efficient in migration and other functional activities due to lower eicosanoid levels. The production of eicosanoids from Arachidonic Acid (AA) can be hampered due to suppression of the enzyme phospholipase A2 by IL-4, an essential cytokine required for the differentiation of DCs. We hypothesized that exogenous addition of AA to the culture media during DC generation may result in DCs with improved functionality. DCs were generated with and without AA. The two DC sets were compared by phenotypic analysis, morphology and functional assays like antigen uptake, MLR, CTL assay and in vitro and in vivo migration. Though there were no differences between the two types of DCs in terms of morphology, phenotype and antigen uptake, AA+ DCs exhibited an enhanced in vitro and in vivo migration, T cell stimulatory capacity, CTL activity and significantly higher transcript levels of COX-2. AA+ DCs also show a favorable Th1 cytokine profile than AA- DCs. Thus addition of AA to the culture media is skewing the DCs towards the secretion of more IL-12 and less of IL-10 along with the restoration of eicosanoids levels in a COX-2 mediated pathway thereby enhancing the functionality of these cells to be used as a potent cellular vaccine. Taken together, these findings will be helpful in the better contriving of DC based vaccines for cancer immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2042942955,"Ultra-conserved genes or elements (UCGs/UCEs) in the human genome are extreme examples of conservation. We characterized natural variations in 2884 UCEs and UCGs in two distinct populations; Singaporean Chinese (n = 280) and Italian (n = 501) by using a pooled sample, targeted capture, sequencing approach. We identify, with high confidence, in these regions the abundance of rare SNVs (MAF<0.5%) of which 75% is not present in dbSNP137. UCEs association studies for complex human traits can use this information to model expected background variation and thus necessary power for association studies. By combining our data with 1000 Genome Project data, we show in three independent datasets that prevalent UCE variants (MAF>5%) are more often found in relatively less-conserved nucleotides within UCEs, compared to rare variants. Moreover, prevalent variants are less likely to overlap transcription factor binding site. Using SNPfold we found no significant influence of RNA secondary structure on UCE conservation. All together, these results suggest UCEs are not under selective pressure as a stretch of DNA but are under differential evolutionary pressure on the single nucleotide level."
https://openalex.org/W2020519816,"The zebrafish posterior lateral line is formed during early development by the deposition of neuromasts from a migrating primordium. The molecular mechanisms regulating the regional organization and migration of the primordium involve interactions between Fgf and Wnt/β-catenin signaling and the establishment of specific cxcr4b and cxcr7b cytokine receptor expression domains. Itch has been identified as a regulator in several different signaling pathways, including Wnt and Cxcr4 signaling. We identified two homologous itch genes in zebrafish, itcha and itchb, with generalized expression patterns. By reducing itchb expression in particular upon morpholino knockdown, we demonstrated the importance of Itch in regulating lateral line development by perturbing the patterns of cxcr4b and cxcr7b expression. Itch knockdown results in a failure to down-regulate Wnt signaling and overexpression of cxcr4b in the primordium, slowing migration of the posterior lateral line primordium and resulting in abnormal development of the lateral line."
https://openalex.org/W2086503323,"Variations in individual body mass and composition have long been a key focus in the health sciences, particularly now that overweight and obesity are considered as public health problems. We study a mathematical model that describes body mass variations which are determined by the energy balance between caloric intake and total energy expenditure. To calculate the change in caloric intake and energy expenditure over time, we proposed a relationship for each of these quantities, and we used measured values that are reported in the literature for the initial conditions. To account for small variations in the daily energy balance of an individual, we include social interactions as the multiplication of two terms: social proximity and social influence. We observe that social interactions have a considerable effect when the body mass of an individual is quite constant and social interactions take random values. However, when an individual's mass value changes (either increases or decreases), social interactions do not have a notable effect. In our simulation, we tested two different models that describe the body mass composition, and it resulted that one fits better the data."
