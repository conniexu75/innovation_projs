https://openalex.org/W2002547950,"Microalgae are considered one of the most promising feedstocks for biofuels. The productivity of these photosynthetic microorganisms in converting carbon dioxide into carbon-rich lipids, only a step or two away from biodiesel, greatly exceeds that of agricultural oleaginous crops, without competing for arable land. Worldwide, research and demonstration programs are being carried out to develop the technology needed to expand algal lipid production from a craft to a major industrial process. Although microalgae are not yet produced at large scale for bulk applications, recent advances—particularly in the methods of systems biology, genetic engineering, and biorefining—present opportunities to develop this process in a sustainable and economical way within the next 10 to 15 years."
https://openalex.org/W1987576588,"In 2008, the world produced approximately 87 gigaliters of liquid biofuels, which is roughly equal to the volume of liquid fuel consumed by Germany that year. Essentially, all of this biofuel was produced from crops developed for food production, raising concerns about the net energy and greenhouse gas effects and potential competition between use of land for production of fuels, food, animal feed, fiber, and ecosystem services. The pending implementation of improved technologies to more effectively convert the nonedible parts of plants (lignocellulose) to liquid fuels opens diverse options to use biofuel feedstocks that reach beyond current crops and the land currently used for food and feed. However, there has been relatively little discussion of what types of plants may be useful as bioenergy crops."

Microelectrodes probe within the cytosol of cells but have a minimum size (hundreds of nanometers in width) for obtaining useful signals. Nanoscale field effect transistors (FETs) can have an active probe size of only tens of nanometers but generally allow only the outer cell potential to be measured. Tian et al. (p. 830 ) fabricated nanowires in which kinks could be introduced to create a sharp probe tip pointing away from the fabrication substrate. Coating the tip with a phospholipid bilayer allowed the probe to be inserted through the membranes of beating cardiac cells, where it could be used to follow temporal changes in cell potential."
https://openalex.org/W1502343738,"High-temperature superconductivity often emerges in the proximity of a symmetry-breaking ground state. For superconducting iron arsenides, in addition to the antiferromagnetic ground state, a small structural distortion breaks the crystal's C(4 )rotational symmetry in the underdoped part of the phase diagram. We reveal that the representative iron arsenide Ba(Fe(1)(-x)Co(x))(2)As(2) develops a large electronic anisotropy at this transition via measurements of the in-plane resistivity of detwinned single crystals, with the resistivity along the shorter b axis rho(b) being greater than rho(a). The anisotropy reaches a maximum value of ~2 for compositions in the neighborhood of the beginning of the superconducting dome. For temperatures well above the structural transition, uniaxial stress induces a resistivity anisotropy, indicating a substantial nematic susceptibility."

Dendritic cells (DCs) are important for maintaining gut tolerance because they help to keep T cells in an unresponsive state. However, in other environments, DCs activate T cells. What signals determine whether DCs induce T cell tolerance or activation? Manicassamy et al. (p. 849 ; see the Perspective by Mellman and Clausen ) found that β-catenin–dependent signaling is required for maintaining DC-mediated gut tolerance in mice. Wnt ligands were expressed in the gut, and β-catenin signaling was activated in DCs in the small and large intestines but not in the spleen. When β-catenin was specifically deleted from DCs in mice, the frequency of regulatory T cells and anti-inflammatory cytokines was reduced, whereas the frequency of pro-inflammatory T helper 1 and T helper 17 cells and their associated cytokines was increased. Mice lacking β-catenin in dendritic cells also exhibited enhanced susceptibility in a mouse model of colitis."
https://openalex.org/W2048131815,"Location, Location, Location Cell division is orchestrated by a complex signaling pathway that ensures the correct segregation of newly replicated chromosomes to the two daughter cells. The pathway is controlled in part by restricting the activity of critical regulators to specific subcellular locations. For example, the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) is recruited to chromosomes during mitosis where it oversees kinetochore activity and cytokinesis (see Perspective by Musacchio ). Wang et al. (p. 231 , published online 12 August), Kelly et al. (p. 235 , published online 12 August), and Yamagishi et al. (p. 239 ) now show that the phosphorylation of the chromatin protein, histone H3, acts to bring the CPC to chromosomes, thereby activating its aurora B kinase subunit. The Survivin subunit of CPC binds specifically to phosphorylated H3, with the phosphorylation at centromeres being carried out by the mitosis-specific kinase, haspin. Furthermore, Bub1 phosphorylation of histone H2A recruits shugoshin, a centromeric CPC adapter. Thus, these two histone marks in combination define the inner centromere."

Combining two-photon glutamate uncaging and two-photon calcium imaging, electrophysiology, and computational modeling, Branco et al. (p. 1671 , published online 12 August; see the Perspective by Destexhe ) discovered that single dendrites were indeed sensitive to both the direction and velocity of synaptic inputs. This direction- and velocity-sensitivity was measurable with only a few inputs and should thus be engaged frequently during normal brain function."
https://openalex.org/W1994028292,"Group I self-splicing ribozymes commonly function as components of selfish mobile genetic elements. We identified an allosteric group I ribozyme, wherein self-splicing is regulated by a distinct riboswitch class that senses the bacterial second messenger c-di-GMP. The tandem RNA sensory system resides in the 5' untranslated region of the messenger RNA for a putative virulence gene in the pathogenic bacterium Clostridium difficile. c-di-GMP binding by the riboswitch induces folding changes at atypical splice site junctions to modulate alternative RNA processing. Our findings indicate that some self-splicing ribozymes are not selfish elements but are harnessed by cells as metabolite sensors and genetic regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2031027810,"Rapid growth in demand for lignocellulosic bioenergy will require major changes in supply chain infrastructure. Even with densification and preprocessing, transport volumes by mid-century are likely to exceed the combined capacity of current agricultural and energy supply chains, including grain, petroleum, and coal. Efficient supply chains can be achieved through decentralized conversion processes that facilitate local sourcing, satellite preprocessing and densification for long-distance transport, and business models that reward biomass growers both nearby and afar. Integrated systems that are cost-effective and energy-efficient will require new ways of thinking about agriculture, energy infrastructure, and rural economic development. Implementing these integrated systems will require innovation and investment in novel technologies, efficient value chains, and socioeconomic and policy frameworks; all are needed to support an expanded biofuels infrastructure that can meet the challenges of scale."
https://openalex.org/W1985282777,"The functional impact of adiponectin on pancreatic beta cells is so far poorly understood. Although adiponectin receptors (AdipoR1/2) were identified, their involvement in adiponectin-induced signaling and other molecules involved is not clearly defined. Therefore, we investigated the role of adiponectin in beta cells and the signaling mediators involved. MIN6 beta cells and mouse islets were stimulated with globular (2.5 μg/ml) or full-length (5 μg/ml) adiponectin under serum starvation, and cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, insulin gene expression, and secretion were measured. Lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis to determine phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Akt, or ERK. Functional significance of signaling was confirmed using dominant negative mutants or pharmacological inhibitors. Participation of AdipoRs was assessed by overexpression or siRNA. Adiponectin failed to activate AMPK after 10 min or 1- and 24-h stimulation. ERK was significantly phosphorylated after 24-h treatment with adiponectin, whereas Akt was activated at all time points examined. 24-h stimulation with adiponectin significantly increased cell viability by decreasing cellular apoptosis, and this was prevented by dominant negative Akt, wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor), and U0126 (MEK inhibitor). Moreover, adiponectin regulated insulin gene expression and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, which was also prevented by wortmannin and U0126 treatment. Interestingly, the data also suggest adiponectin-induced changes in Akt and ERK phosphorylation and caspase-3 may occur independent of the level of AdipoR expression. This study demonstrates a lack of AMPK involvement and implicates Akt and ERK in adiponectin signaling, leading to protection against apoptosis and stimulation of insulin gene expression and secretion in pancreatic beta cells."

Current physical models posit that shocked expanding gas from the nova shell can produce X-ray emission but emission at higher energies has not been widely expected. Here, we report the Fermi Large Area Telescope detection of variable gamma-ray (0.1-10 GeV) emission from the recently-detected optical nova of the symbiotic star V407 Cygni. We propose that the material of the nova shell interacts with the dense ambient medium of the red giant primary, and that particles can be accelerated effectively to produce pi0 decay gamma-rays from proton-proton interactions. Emission involving inverse Compton scattering of the red giant radiation is also considered and is not ruled out."
https://openalex.org/W2121118426,"Candidiasis are life-threatening systemic fungal diseases, especially of gastro intestinal track, skin and mucous membranes lining various body cavities like the nostrils, the mouth, the lips, the eyelids, the ears or the genital area. Due to increasing resistance of candidiasis to existing drugs, it is very important to look for new strategies helping the treatment of such fungal diseases. One promising strategy is the use of the probiotic microorganisms, which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit. Such a probiotic microorganism is yeast Saccharomyces boulardii, a close relative of baker yeast. Saccharomyces boulardii cells and their extract affect the virulence factors of the important human fungal pathogen C. albicans, its hyphae formation, adhesion and biofilm development. Extract prepared from S. boulardii culture filtrate was fractionated and GC-MS analysis showed that the active fraction contained, apart from 2-phenylethanol, caproic, caprylic and capric acid whose presence was confirmed by ESI-MS analysis. Biological activity was tested on C. albicans using extract and pure identified compounds. Our study demonstrated that this probiotic yeast secretes into the medium active compounds reducing candidal virulence factors. The chief compound inhibiting filamentous C. albicans growth comparably to S. boulardii extract was capric acid, which is thus responsible for inhibition of hyphae formation. It also reduced candidal adhesion and biofilm formation, though three times less than the extract, which thus contains other factors suppressing C. albicans adherence. The expression profile of selected genes associated with C. albicans virulence by real-time PCR showed a reduced expression of HWP1, INO1 and CSH1 genes in C. albicans cells treated with capric acid and S. boulardii extract. Hence capric acid secreted by S. boulardii is responsible for inhibition of C. albicans filamentation and partially also adhesion and biofilm formation."
https://openalex.org/W2080812054,"Reduced chemosensitivity of solid cancer cells represents a pivotal obstacle in clinical oncology. Hence, the molecular characterization of pathways regulating chemosensitivity is a central prerequisite to improve cancer therapy. The hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1alpha has been linked to chemosensitivity while the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely elusive. Therefore, we comprehensively analysed HIF-1alpha's role in determining chemosensitivity focussing on responsible molecular pathways.RNA interference was applied to inactivate HIF-1alpha or p53 in the human gastric cancer cell lines AGS and MKN28. The chemotherapeutic agents 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin were used and chemosensitivity was assessed by cell proliferation assays as well as determination of cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. Expression of p53 and p53 target proteins was analyzed by western blot. NF-kappaB activity was characterized by means of electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Inactivation of HIF-1alpha in gastric cancer cells resulted in robust elevation of chemosensitivity. Accordingly, HIF-1alpha-competent cells displayed a significant reduction of chemotherapy-induced senescence and apoptosis. Remarkably, this phenotype was completely absent in p53 mutant cells while inactivation of p53 per se did not affect chemosensitivity. HIF-1alpha markedly suppressed chemotherapy-induced activation of p53 and p21 as well as the retinoblastoma protein, eventually resulting in cell cycle arrest. Reduced formation of reactive oxygen species in HIF-1alpha-competent cells was identified as the molecular mechanism of HIF-1alpha-mediated inhibition of p53. Furthermore, loss of HIF-1alpha abrogated, in a p53-dependent manner, chemotherapy-induced DNA-binding of NF-kappaB and expression of anti-apoptotic NF-kappaB target genes. Accordingly, reconstitution of the NF-kappaB subunit p65 reversed the increased chemosensitivity of HIF-1alpha-deficient cells.In summary, we identified HIF-1alpha as a potent regulator of p53 and NF-kappaB activity under conditions of genotoxic stress. We conclude that p53 mutations in human tumors hold the potential to confound the efficacy of HIF-1-inhibitors in cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2016852539,"Concerns about climate change, security of supply, and depleting fossil fuel reserves have spurred a revival of interest in nuclear power generation in Europe and North America, while other regions continue or initiate an expansion. We suggest that the first stage of this process will include replacing or extending the life of existing nuclear power plants, with continued incremental improvements in efficiency and reliability. After 2030, a large-scale second period of construction would allow nuclear energy to contribute substantially to the decarbonization of electricity generation. For nuclear energy to be sustainable, new large-scale fuel cycles will be required that may include fuel reprocessing. Here, we explore the opportunities and constraints in both time periods and suggests ways in which measures taken today might, at modest cost, provide more options in the decades to come. Careful long-term planning, along with parallel efforts aimed at containing waste products and avoiding diversion of material into weapons production, can ensure that nuclear power generation remains a carbon-neutral option."
https://openalex.org/W2074905007,"Three multiprotein systems are known for iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis in prokaryotes and eukaryotes as follows: the NIF (nitrogen fixation), the ISC (iron-sulfur cluster), and the SUF (mobilization of sulfur) systems. In all three, cysteine is the physiological sulfur source, and the sulfur is transferred from cysteine desulfurase through a persulfidic intermediate to a scaffold protein. However, the biochemical nature of the sulfur source for Fe-S cluster assembly in archaea is unknown, and many archaea lack homologs of cysteine desulfurases.

https://openalex.org/W1970013572,"Experiments characterizing the biological effects of sun exposure have usually involved solar simulators. However, they addressed the worst case scenario i.e. zenithal sun, rarely found in common outdoor activities. A non-extreme ultraviolet radiation (UV) spectrum referred as “daily UV radiation” (DUVR) with a higher UVA (320–400 nm) to UVB (280–320 nm) irradiance ratio has therefore been defined. In this study, the biological impact of an acute exposure to low physiological doses of DUVR (corresponding to 10 and 20% of the dose received per day in Paris mid-April) on a 3 dimensional reconstructed skin model, was analysed. In such conditions, epidermal and dermal morphological alterations could only be detected after the highest dose of DUVR. We then focused on oxidative stress response induced by DUVR, by analyzing the modulation of mRNA level of 24 markers in parallel in fibroblasts and keratinocytes. DUVR significantly modulated mRNA levels of these markers in both cell types. A cell type differential response was noticed: it was faster in fibroblasts, with a majority of inductions and high levels of modulation in contrast to keratinocyte response. Our results thus revealed a higher sensitivity in response to oxidative stress of dermal fibroblasts although located deeper in the skin, giving new insights into the skin biological events occurring in everyday UV exposure."
https://openalex.org/W1971374046,"Changes in the Rocks Changing sea level or major tectonic events, such as continental collisions, shift stratigraphic sequences by changing the depositional environment where certain rock types form. For example, a deep marine environment where limestone formation is favored may shift relatively quickly to a near-shore environment favoring sandstone formation because the relative sea level has dropped several meters. Petersen et al. (p. 827 ; see the Perspective by Müller ), however, suggest that small-scale convection in the mantle may also induce appreciable changes in the sequence of sedimentary deposits. Using a modeling approach, they found that this is possible on a small scale (that is, just a few hundreds of kilometers) over variable time scales. Thus, while the co-occurrence of sedimentary deposit sequences at regional and global scales can allow sedimentary rocks to serve as markers of marine environments, it should be kept in mind that local changes in surface movements may also manifest themselves in the rock record."
https://openalex.org/W2158021738,"Background A complex relationship exists between diet and sleep but despite its impact on human health, this relationship remains uncharacterized and poorly understood. Drosophila melanogaster is an important model for the study of metabolism and behaviour, however the effect of diet upon Drosophila sleep remains largely unaddressed. Methodology/Principal Findings Using automated behavioural monitoring, a capillary feeding assay and pharmacological treatments, we examined the effect of dietary yeast and sucrose upon Drosophila sleep-wake behaviour for three consecutive days. We found that dietary yeast deconsolidated the sleep-wake behaviour of flies by promoting arousal from sleep in males and shortening periods of locomotor activity in females. We also demonstrate that arousal from nocturnal sleep exhibits a significant ultradian rhythmicity with a periodicity of 85 minutes. Increasing the dietary sucrose concentration from 5% to 35% had no effect on total sucrose ingestion per day nor any affect on arousal, however it did lengthen the time that males and females remained active. Higher dietary sucrose led to reduced total sleep by male but not female flies. Locomotor activity was reduced by feeding flies Metformin, a drug that inhibits oxidative phosphorylation, however Metformin did not affect any aspects of sleep. Conclusions We conclude that arousal from sleep is under ultradian control and regulated in a sex-dependent manner by dietary yeast and that dietary sucrose regulates the length of time that flies sustain periods of wakefulness. These findings highlight Drosophila as an important model with which to understand how diet impacts upon sleep and wakefulness in mammals and humans."
https://openalex.org/W2090048264,"Neural development and plasticity are regulated by neural adhesion proteins, including the polysialylated form of NCAM (PSA-NCAM). Podocalyxin (PC) is a renal PSA-containing protein that has been reported to function as an anti-adhesin in kidney podocytes. Here we show that PC is widely expressed in neurons during neural development. Neural PC interacts with the ERM protein family, and with NHERF1/2 and RhoA/G. Experiments in vitro and phenotypic analyses of podxl-deficient mice indicate that PC is involved in neurite growth, branching and axonal fasciculation, and that PC loss-of-function reduces the number of synapses in the CNS and in the neuromuscular system. We also show that whereas some of the brain PC functions require PSA, others depend on PC per se. Our results show that PC, the second highly sialylated neural adhesion protein, plays multiple roles in neural development."
https://openalex.org/W2069369960,"Ras and Rho small GTPases possessing a C-terminal polybasic region (PBR) are vital signaling proteins whose misregulation can lead to cancer. Signaling by these proteins depends on their ability to bind guanine nucleotides and their prenylation with a geranylgeranyl or farnesyl isoprenoid moiety and subsequent trafficking to cellular membranes. There is little previous evidence that cellular signals can restrain nonprenylated GTPases from entering the prenylation pathway, leading to the general belief that PBR-possessing GTPases are prenylated as soon as they are synthesized. Here, we present evidence that challenges this belief. We demonstrate that insertion of the dominant negative mutation to inhibit GDP/GTP exchange diminishes prenylation of Rap1A and RhoA, enhances prenylation of Rac1, and does not detectably alter prenylation of K-Ras. Our results indicate that the entrance and passage of these small GTPases through the prenylation pathway is regulated by two splice variants of SmgGDS, a protein that has been reported to promote GDP/GTP exchange by PBR-possessing GTPases and to be up-regulated in several forms of cancer. We show that the previously characterized 558-residue SmgGDS splice variant (SmgGDS-558) selectively associates with prenylated small GTPases and facilitates trafficking of Rap1A to the plasma membrane, whereas the less well characterized 607-residue SmgGDS splice variant (SmgGDS-607) associates with nonprenylated GTPases and regulates the entry of Rap1A, RhoA, and Rac1 into the prenylation pathway.

Biochem. 2008; 104: 1760-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which SmgGDS promotes the activities of PBR-containing small GTPases is unclear. SmgGDS was previously reported to be a weak guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) because of its ability to promote the dissociation of GDP and uptake of GTP by its small GTPase partners (9Takakura A. Miyoshi J. Ishizaki H. Tanaka M. Togawa A. Nishizawa Y. Yoshida H. Nishikawa S. Takai Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1875-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 10Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F.

However, SmgGDS does not possess any of the known catalytic domains found in other GEFs, leading to the suggestion that SmgGDS regulates small GTPases by a novel, unknown mechanism that might not involve classical guanine nucleotide exchange. In this study, we provide evidence of a previously undescribed mechanism utilized by SmgGDS to regulate small GTPases, involving their entrance and trafficking through the prenylation pathway. Prenylation is necessary for optimal activity of members of the Ras and Rho families of small GTPases, increasing their hydrophobic character and thereby promoting their participation in membrane-localized signaling pathways and other biological interactions (3Winter-Vann A.M.

The prenylated GTPases then move to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to interact with the Ras-converting enzyme I (Rce1) and the isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase for post-prenylation processing (3Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 5Hancock J.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

The presence of a PBR influences which pathway a Ras or Rho family member will take to reach the plasma membrane (PM) after post-prenylation processing is completed in the ER. Small GTPases such as H-Ras and N-Ras, which lack a PBR, move from the ER to the Golgi, where they are palmitoylated, and then move by vesicular transport to the PM (5Hancock J.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 6Wright L.P. Philips M.R. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 883-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In contrast, small GTPases that possess a PBR, such as K-Ras, Rap1, RhoA, and Rac1, move directly from the ER to the PM by an uncharacterized mechanism that most likely involves unidentified chaperone proteins (5Hancock J.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 6Wright L.P. Philips M.R. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 883-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Several crucial events in this prenylation pathway remain a mystery. It is not known how a newly synthesized small GTPase initially finds its PTase in the cytosol. In the absence of any known regulatory mechanisms, it is often assumed that small GTPases are prenylated as soon as they are synthesized and advance through the prenylation pathway unimpeded in a nonregulated manner. Recently, several models have emerged to define how the Rab escort protein Rep might regulate the interactions of newly synthesized Rab small GTPases with their PTase, geranylgeranyltransferase-II (24Leung K.F. Baron R. Seabra M.C. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 467-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 25Wu Y.W. Tan K.T. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, the mechanisms that might regulate the interactions of newly synthesized Ras and Rho family members with their PTases have not been characterized. Also unknown is how PBR-possessing small GTPases, once modified by the addition of a hydrophobic prenyl group, move through the cytosol to the ER for final processing by Rce1 and isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase nor is it known how the fully processed PBR-possessing small GTPases move from the ER to the PM. It has been suggested that unidentified chaperone proteins might escort PBR-containing small GTPases between the cytosol, ER, and PM during the prenylation pathway (5Hancock J.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 6Wright L.P. Philips M.R. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 883-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), but these suspected chaperones have not been identified. Here, we report that the prenylation and trafficking of PBR-containing small GTPases is regulated by GDP/GTP exchange and by interactions with two splice variants of SmgGDS, which we have named SmgGDS-558 and SmgGDS-607. Our results demonstrate that SmgGDS-607 specifically interacts with nonprenylated small GTPases and regulates their entry into the prenylation pathway, whereas SmgGDS-558 specifically associates with prenylated small GTPases and regulates trafficking to the PM. These findings suggest that, in contrast to the previous view of unregulated entry of small GTPases into the prenylation pathway, prenylation of PBR-containing small GTPases is regulated in multiple ways. Interactions of PBR-containing small GTPases with SmgGDS splice variants in conjunction with GDP/GTP exchange presents, for the first time, a specific cellular mechanism to regulate the prenylation and subsequent membrane localization of these GTPases. All cell lines were obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection (Manassas, VA). The NSCLC cell lines NCI-H1703 and NCI-H23 were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics; the HEK-293T cell line was maintained in DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. All siRNA duplexes were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Sequences of the siRNAs are presented in supplemental Table S1. Nontargeting siRNAs (Dharmacon siControl 3) were designed not to target any human mRNA. Cells were transfected with 25 nm siRNA using DharmaFECT-3 transfection reagent (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) according to the manufacturer's instruction. All cDNAs were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A construct encoding human SmgGDS-607 (cDNA clone FLJ30470) was obtained from the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation Biological Resource Center (Chiba, Japan) and was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector with a single C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA). Two amino acids in the original construct that did not agree with the sequences in the NCBI Database were changed by site-directed mutagenesis to agree with the sequences in the NCBI Database (accession number NP_001093897). These changes were T197C to produce V66A and C1154T to produce F385L. SmgGDS-558-HA was generated by overlap PCR from SmgGDS-607-HA in the pcDNA3.1(+) vector. The Myc-tagged and GFP-tagged small GTPase constructs were generated as described previously (27Lanning C.C. Ruiz-Velasco R. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12495-12506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The SAAX mutants of the small GTPases described in supplemental Table S2 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis to change the cysteine in the CAAX motif to a serine. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocols, using primers purchased from Operon. The FLAG-tagged Rap1 GEF constructs MR-GEF, C3G, GRP3, and PDZ-GEF were the kind gifts from Dr. Lawrence Quilliam, Indiana University School of Medicine and Walther Oncology Center (28Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34901-34908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). NCI-H1703 cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors encoding the luciferase protein (a kind gift from Dr. Michael Dwinell, Medical College of Wisconsin) and the tetracycline repressor protein (Invitrogen) and selected for stable expression of the vectors. Lentiviral vectors expressing inducible shRNA for SmgGDS-558 (shRNA BD), SmgGDS-607 (shRNA C2), or a nontargeting control shRNA were generated using the “Block-iT” inducible H1 lentiviral RNAi system (Invitrogen, K4925-00). Cells were transduced with the lentiviral vectors containing the inducible shRNAs and selected for stable expression of the vectors. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 triple selection media (200 μg/ml Zeocin, 12 μg/ml blasticidin, 400 ng/ml puromycin). Expression of shRNA was induced using 2 μg/ml tetracycline (Invitrogen). Oligonucleotide sequences encoding the shRNA were purchased from Operon. The forward sequences were as follows: nontargeting shRNA, 5′-CACCATGGTTTACATGTTTTCTGATTGAGAAATCAGAAAACATGTAAACCA-3′; C2 shRNA, 5′-CACCATTCTCATTGCTATAGTTCCGAAGAACTATAGCAATGAGAA-3′; and BD shRNA, 5′-CACCATGAAGCGAATGGCTATCGTGAGAACGATAGCCATTCGCTTCA-3′. Reverse complements of the sequences were also purchased for formation of the shRNA double-stranded DNA complexes. Equal numbers of transfected cells were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride and immunoblotted using antibody to SmgGDS (BD Transduction Laboratories 612511), GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-32233), mouse HA antibody (Covance, MMS-101P), rabbit HA antibody (Covance, PRB-101P), mouse Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-40), rabbit Myc antibody (Covance, PRB-150P), mouse antibody to FLAG (Sigma, F3165), rabbit antibody to FLAG (Sigma, F7425), mouse antibody to Actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-47778), rabbit antibody to tet-repressor (Chemicon, AB3541), rabbit antibody to lamin B1 (Abcam, ab16048), or goat antibody to nonprenylated Rap1 (29Peterson Y.K.

Bound antibodies were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG, anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences), or anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2056) and ECL reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), as described previously (30Lanning C.C.

HEK-293T cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding HA-tagged SmgGDS splice variants and Myc-tagged small GTPases. After 24 h, equal numbers of cells were lysed in buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and the lysates were centrifuged (2500 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). A portion of the resulting supernatants was reserved for total cell lysates, and the remainder was immunoprecipitated using mouse HA antibody (Covance, MMS-101P) or mouse Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-40). Immunoprecipitates and total cell lysates were subjected to ECL-Western blotting as described above. Using an approved Institutional Review Board protocol (Medical College of Wisconsin Institutional Review Board PRO5554), lysates of archival lung tumors and their matched normal lung tissue were homogenized in 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol with protease inhibitors (Complete Mini Tablets, Roche Applied Science) and then centrifuged (18,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). The resulting supernatants were then normalized to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml protein, boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, and subjected to ECL-Western blotting using antibody to SmgGDS or actin. The expression of mRNAs for SmgGDS-558 and SmgGDS-607 in a panel of archival lung tumors and matched normal tissue was determined by quantitative real time PCR using methods described previously (31Regala R.P. Thompson E.A. Fields A.P. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 5888-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Anchorage-independent proliferation of the NSCLC cells NCI-H1703 and NCI-H23 was analyzed by their ability to form colonies in soft agar. 7 × 104 cells were transfected with siRNA or treated with transfection reagents only (mock transfection). After 24 h, cells were lifted, and 9.9 × 103 cells were suspended in 0.3% low-melt agarose (Bio-Rad) in complete RPMI. Triplicate wells were plated with 1 ml of the cell suspension over 1 ml of solidified 0.6% low-melt agarose in RPMI. After the 0.3% agarose layer set, each well was overlaid with 2 ml of complete RPMI. Digital images of the cells were collected 4 weeks (NCI-H1703) or 5 weeks (NCI-H23) later, and the numbers of visible colonies in the agar were counted using ImageJ. As described previously (32Hancock J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-114 in TBS (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5), incubated 15 min on ice, and then centrifuged at 25,000 × g at 4 °C to remove insoluble debris. An aliquot of the cleared lysate was retained as total cell lysate. The remaining lysate was subjected to temperature-dependent separation of the aqueous and detergent phases (2 min of incubation at 37 °C followed by room temperature centrifugation at 1500 × g). After separation of the aqueous and detergent phase, the aqueous phase was transferred to a separate microcentrifuge tube, and 11% Triton X-114 was added to a final concentration of 1%. Any remaining aqueous sample was then scavenged from the detergent phase and discarded. This step resulted in a loss of both detergent and aqueous sample relative to total cell lysate, visible as a disproportionate isolation of lamin B1 in the detergent fractions and GAPDH in aqueous fractions compared with the lamin B1 and GAPDH in the total cell lysate. TBS was then added to the detergent phase to a final concentration 1% Triton X-114. The detergent fractions, aqueous fractions, and total cell lysate were combined 1:1 with 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and equal volumes of each fraction and the total cell lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE and examined by ECL-Western blotting. Proteins were detected with mouse HA antibody to detect SmgGDS isoforms and small GTPases, GAPDH antibody (an aqueous phase loading control), and rabbit antibody to lamin B1 (a detergent phase loading control). OD values of the GTPases detected in the aqueous, detergent, and total cell lysate samples were measured on an AlphaImager HP and analyzed using AlphaView SA software (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). As discussed above, we observed in some experiments that there was disproportionate isolation of the detergent fraction (containing lamin B1) compared with the aqueous fraction (containing GAPDH). Therefore, all OD values for the detergent fraction were normalized by the factor (OD lamin in detergent phase/OD lamin in total cell lysates). Similarly, all OD values in the aqueous phase were normalized by the factor (OD GAPDH in aqueous phase/OD of GAPDH in the total cell lysate). NCI-H1703 cells stably expressing tet-inducible shRNAs were cultured with or without tetracycline for 72 h, transfected with cDNA encoding GFP-tagged Rap1A, and 24 h later examined by fluorescence microscopy as described previously (30Lanning C.C.

The sample identities were masked, and two investigators independently ranked the membrane localization of GFP-Rap1A on a scale of 1–3, a score of 1 representing undetectable, 2 moderate, and 3 extensive membrane localization. All results are the means ± S.E. Symbols above a column indicate a statistical comparison between the bracketed sample by analysis of variance with Dunnett's post hoc multiple comparison's test, by Student's t test, or by χ2 analysis, as indicated in the figure legends. p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. SmgGDS (also known as smgGDS and Rap1GDS1) was originally isolated from bovine brain (33Kaibuchi K. Mizuno T. Fujioka H. Yamamoto T. Kishi K. Fukumoto Y. Hori Y. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2873-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and human brain (34Kikuchi A. Kaibuchi K. Hori Y. Nonaka H. Sakoda T. Kawamura M. Mizuno T. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 289-293PubMed Google Scholar) as a cDNA encoding a 558-residue protein (NCBI accession NP_001093899, isoform 5). In addition to this previously described protein, which we refer to as SmgGDS-558, the NCBI Database also lists a 607-residue SmgGDS splice variant (NCBI accession NP_001093897, isoform 3), which we designate as SmgGDS-607. Both SmgGDS-607 and SmgGDS-558 consist mainly of predicted ARM repeats, with SmgGDS-607 differing from SmgGDS-558 by the addition of only one ARM repeat (Fig. 1A; supplemental Fig. S1). Western blotting of NSCLC cell lysates using a monoclonal SmgGDS antibody detects two proteins with apparent molecular masses of 55 and 60 kDa (Fig. 1B). We suspected that the 55-kDa protein corresponds to SmgGDS-558 and the 60-kDa protein corresponds to SmgGDS-607. To confirm the identities of these immunoreactive proteins, we designed siRNA duplexes to target either both SmgGDS splice variants simultaneously (siRNAs I1 and I2), only SmgGDS-607 (siRNAs C1 and C2), or only SmgGDS-558 (siRNA BD) (Fig. 1A; supplemental Table S1). Transfection of two NSCLC cell lines, NCI-H1703 and NCI-H23 (Fig. 1B), with siRNAs I1 and I2 decreases expression of both proteins detected by the SmgGDS antibody. siRNA BD decreases only the 55-kDa protein, and siRNAs C1 and C2 decrease only the 60-kDa protein. These results confirm the identities of the 55- and 60-kDa immunoreactive proteins and demonstrate that both SmgGDS-558 and SmgGDS-607 are expressed in NSCLC cell lines (Fig. 1B). In our previous immunohistochemical analysis of lung tumors and tissues, we found that SmgGDS protein is significantly elevated in NSCLC tumors compared with normal lung tissue (12Tew G.W. Lorimer E.L. Berg T.J. Zhi H. Li R. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 963-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To determine whether both SmgGDS splice variants are expressed in lung tumors and tissues, we conducted Western blotting of lung tumors and matched normal lung tissue from nine patients (Fig. 1C). Two proteins are detected by the SmgGDS antibody in most of these immunoblotted tissue samples, and the migration of the immunoreactive proteins corresponds to the migration of SmgGDS-607 and SmgGDS-558 (Fig. 1C). The SmgGDS antibody also detects an unidentified 42-kDa protein (p42) in some of the tumor or lung tissue samples (Fig. 1C, samples 2–8), which may be an SmgGDS degradation product or potentially another uncharacterized SmgGDS splice variant. We examined the expression of mRNA transcripts for SmgGDS-558 and SmgGDS-607 using quantitative RT-PCR in a panel of 50 matched samples of lung tumors and normal lung tissues (Fig. 1D). In both the normal tissue samples and in the tumor samples, quantitative RT-PCR analysis detected more abundant SmgGDS-607 mRNA than SmgGDS-558 mRNA (Fig. 1D). This detection of more SmgGDS-607 mRNA than SmgGDS-558 mRNA is consistent with the immunoblotting results, which indicated more detectable SmgGDS-607 protein than SmgGDS-558 protein in the majority of the tumors and normal tissue samples examined (Fig. 1C) as well as in the cultured cells (Fig. 1B). Somewhat surprisingly, we observed that neither SmgGDS-558 mRNA expression nor SmgGDS-607 mRNA expression is elevated in the tumors compared with the matched normal lung tissues (Fig. 1D). The finding that SmgGDS mRNA is not significantly elevated in the tumors was somewhat unexpected, based on our earlier report that SmgG"
https://openalex.org/W2001705172,"Background A peptide vaccine was produced containing B and T cell epitopes from the V3 and C4 Envelope domains of 4 subtype B HIV-1 isolates (MN, RF, CanO, & Ev91). The peptide mixture was formulated as an emulsion in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA). Methods Low-risk, healthy adult subjects were enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled dose-escalation study, and selected using criteria specifying that 50% in each study group would be HLA-B7+. Immunizations were scheduled at 0, 1, and 6 months using a total peptide dose of 1 or 4 mg. Adaptive immune responses in16 vaccine recipients and two placebo recipients after the 2nd immunization were evaluated using neutralization assays of sera, as well as ELISpot and ICS assays of cryopreserved PBMCs to assess CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses. In addition, 51Cr release assays were performed on fresh PBMCs following 14-day stimulation with individual vaccine peptide antigens. Results 24 subjects were enrolled; 18 completed 2 injections. The study was prematurely terminated because 4 vaccinees developed prolonged pain and sterile abscess formation at the injection site-2 after dose 1, and 2 after dose 2. Two other subjects experienced severe systemic reactions consisting of headache, chills, nausea, and myalgia. Both reactions occurred after the second 4 mg dose. The immunogenicity assessments showed that 6/8 vaccinees at each dose level had detectable MN-specific neutralizing (NT) activity, and 2/7 HLA-B7+ vaccinees had classical CD8 CTL activity detected. However, using both ELISpot and ICS, 8/16 vaccinees (5/7 HLA-B7+) and 0/2 controls had detectable vaccine-specific CD8 T-cell responses. Subjects with moderate or severe systemic or local reactions tended to have more frequent T cell responses and higher antibody responses than those with mild or no reactions. Conclusions The severity of local responses related to the formulation of these four peptides in IFA is clinically unacceptable for continued development. Both HIV-specific antibody and T cell responses were induced and the magnitude of response correlated with the severity of local and systemic reactions. If potent adjuvants are necessary for subunit vaccines to induce broad and durable immune responses, careful, incremental clinical evaluation is warranted to minimize the risk of adverse events.

https://openalex.org/W2095883935,"Although dietary ketogenic essential amino acid (KAA) content modifies accumulation of hepatic lipids, the molecular interactions between KAAs and lipid metabolism are yet to be fully elucidated.We designed a diet with a high ratio (E/N) of essential amino acids (EAAs) to non-EAAs by partially replacing dietary protein with 5 major free KAAs (Leu, Ile, Val, Lys and Thr) without altering carbohydrate and fat content. This high-KAA diet was assessed for its preventive effects on diet-induced hepatic steatosis and whole-animal insulin resistance. C57B6 mice were fed with a high-fat diet, and hyperinsulinemic ob/ob mice were fed with a high-fat or high-sucrose diet. The high-KAA diet improved hepatic steatosis with decreased de novo lipogenesis (DNL) fluxes as well as reduced expressions of lipogenic genes. In C57B6 mice, the high-KAA diet lowered postprandial insulin secretion and improved glucose tolerance, in association with restored expression of muscle insulin signaling proteins repressed by the high-fat diet. Lipotoxic metabolites and their synthetic fluxes were also evaluated with reference to insulin resistance. The high-KAA diet lowered muscle and liver ceramides, both by reducing dietary lipid incorporation into muscular ceramides and preventing incorporation of DNL-derived fatty acids into hepatic ceramides.Our results indicate that dietary KAA intake improves hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance by modulating lipid synthetic pathways."

The majority of colorectal cancers are characterized by a defective DNA mismatch repair (MMR). Here, we have employed the MMR-deficient HCT 116 colorectal cancer cells and the MMR-proficient HCT 116 cells with hMLH1 complementation to investigate the role of hMLH1 in selenium-induced DNA damage response, a tumorigenesis barrier. The ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) protein responds to clastogens and initiates DNA damage response. We show that hMLH1 complementation sensitizes HCT 116 cells to methylseleninic acid, methylselenocysteine, and sodium selenite via reactive oxygen species and facilitates the selenium-induced oxidative 8-oxoguanine damage, DNA breaks, G2/M checkpoint response, and ATM pathway activation. Pretreatment of the hMLH1-complemented HCT 116 cells with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine or 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl or the ATM kinase inhibitor KU55933 suppresses hMLH1-dependent DNA damage response to selenium exposure. Selenium treatment stimulates the association between hMLH1 and hPMS2 proteins, a heterodimer critical for functional MMR, in a manner dependent on ATM and reactive oxygen species.

https://openalex.org/W2081623026,"Abnormalities in the process of endocytosis are classically linked to malignant transformation through the deficient down-regulation of signaling receptors. The present study describes a non-classical mechanism that does not require internalization by which endocytic proteins affect cell migration and basement membrane invasion. Specifically, we found that the endocytic adaptor epsin binds and regulates the biological properties of the signaling molecule RalBP1 (Ral-binding protein 1). Epsin interacted with the N terminus of RalBP1 via its characteristic epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain. A combination of siRNA-mediated knock-down and transfection of siRNA-resistant constructs in fibrosarcoma cells demonstrated that impairment of the epsin-RalBP1 interaction led to cell migration and basement membrane invasion defects. We found the ENTH domain was necessary and sufficient to sustain normal cell migration and invasion. Because all the epsin endocytic motifs reside in the C-terminal part of the molecule, these results suggest that this novel regulatory circuit does not require endocytosis. In addition, cells depleted of epsin-RalBP1 complex displayed deficient activation of Rac1 and Arf6 suggesting a signaling function for this novel interaction. Further, overexpression of either epsin or RalBP1 enhanced migration and invasion of fibrosarcoma cells. Collectively, our results indicate that epsin regulates RalBP1 function in Rac1- and Arf6-dependent pathways to ultimately affect cell migration and invasion. We propose that the observed up-regulation of both epsin and RalBP1 in certain cancers contributes to their invasive characteristics."

https://openalex.org/W2026432698,"Dynamic changes in neuronal morphology and transcriptional regulation play crucial roles in the neuronal network and function. Accumulating evidence suggests that the megakaryoblastic leukemia (MKL) family members, which function not only as actin-binding proteins but also as serum response factor (SRF) transcriptional coactivators, regulate neuronal morphology. However, the extracellular ligands and signaling pathways, which activate MKL-mediated morphological changes in neurons, remain unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that in addition to MKL1, MKL2, highly enriched in the forebrain, strongly contributes to the dendritic complexity, and this process is triggered by stimulation with activin, a member of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily. Activin promoted dendritic complexity in a SRF- and MKL-dependent manner without drastically affecting MKL localization and protein levels. In contrast, activin promoted the nuclear export of suppressor of cancer cell invasion (SCAI), which is a corepressor for SRF and MKL. Furthermore, overexpression of SCAI blocked activin-induced SRF transcriptional responses and dendritic complexity. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that activin-SCAI-MKL signaling is a novel pathway that regulates the dendritic morphology of rat cortical neurons by excluding SCAI from the nucleus and activating MKL/SRF-mediated gene expression.

Trends Neurosci. 2009; 32: 432-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). SRF-dependent transcription is controlled by at least two different types of coactivators. One comprises the ternary complex factors, which mainly regulate the immediate-early genes such as c-fos (7Buchwalter G. Gross C. Wasylyk B. Gene. 2004; 324: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The other type of coactivator comprises megakaryoblastic leukemia (MKL) family members. The MKL family consists of megakaryocytic acute leukemia/megakaryoblastic leukemia 1/myocardin-related transcription factor-A/basic SAP, and coiled-coil domain (MAL/MKL1/MRTF-A/BSAC) and MKL2/MRTF-B (8Wang D.Z.

In nonneuronal cells, MKL1 is primarily activated by actin rearrangement stimulated with the activation of Rho GTPases; that is, release of MKL1 from G-actin enables MKL1 to translocate to the nucleus where it binds to and activates SRF (14Miralles F. Posern G. Zaromytidou A.I. Treisman R. Cell. 2003; 113: 329-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). MKL2, in addition to MKL1, regulates a set of cytoskeletal genes (11Selvaraj A. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41977-41987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 12Cen B. Selvaraj A. Prywes R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Furthermore, suppressor of cancer cell invasion (SCAI) has recently been identified as an MKL-interacting cofactor that inhibits cancer cell invasion (15Brandt D.T. Baarlink C. Kitzing T.M. Kremmer E. Ivaska J. Nollau P. Grosse R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, SRF-driven transcriptional regulation appears to be more complicated because of the presence of novel MKL-interacting cofactors. However, it remains unclear as to whether MKL1, MKL2, and SCAI play different roles in several biological processes through the regulation of their own target genes in neurons.The transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily plays important roles in various cellular processes associated with cell growth, differentiation, and development (16Massagué J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar, 17Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Nat.

Signal. 2009; 7: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To regulate such a wide variety of cellular functions, TGF-β binds to specific receptors and activates a multitude of signals, including the canonical pathway that promotes phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad2 and Smad3 (19Xu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1759: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and the noncanonical pathway that activates ERK, p38 MAP kinases, or Rho GTPases (20Zhang Y.E. Cell Res. 2009; 19: 128-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that TGF-β signaling also regulates SRF (21Qiu P. Feng X.H. Li L. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 1407-1420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 22Morita T. Mayanagi T. Sobue K. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1027-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Recently, a study showed that TGF-β1, a member of the TGF-β superfamily, activates SRF-dependent cytoskeletal genes or Smad3-dependent genes via nuclear translocation of MKL. This process may be involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which occurs during embryonic development and tumor progression (22Morita T. Mayanagi T. Sobue K. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1027-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether MKL family members mediate TGF-β signaling in the brain.In neurons, MKL1 regulates SRF-mediated transcription through the RhoA or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-induced ERK1/2 signaling pathway (23Tabuchi A. Estevez M. Henderson J.A. Marx R. Shiota J. Nakano H. Baraban J.M. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24Kalita K. Kharebava G. Zheng J.J. Hetman M. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10020-10032Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, MKL1 is highly expressed in the forebrain and regulates the neuronal morphology of cortical or hippocampal neurons (5Knöll B. Kretz O. Fiedler C. Alberti S. Schütz G. Frotscher M. Nordheim A. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 25Shiota J. Ishikawa M. Sakagami H. Tsuda M. Baraban J.M. Tabuchi A. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 1778-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). MKL1 may also be involved in nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced axonal growth of sensory neurons (26Wickramasinghe S.R. Alvania R.S. Ramanan N. Wood J.N. Mandai K. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 2008; 58: 532-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These observations imply that MKL family members participate in the regulation of neuronal morphology through regulating actin-based morphological changes or by controlling the expression of SRF-targeted cytoskeletal genes. In contrast to several reports on the function of MKL1, the expression and function of MKL2 in the brain remain unresolved. Furthermore, there is little information describing the kinds of extracellular ligands that potentially act upstream of the MKL family to regulate dendritic morphology. In the present study, we first investigated the pattern of MKL2 expression in the developing and adult brain and assessed whether MKL2 regulates SRF transcription and the morphology of rat cortical neurons. Furthermore, we found that activin, a member of the TGF-β superfamily, promoted dendritic complexity through nuclear export of SCAI and removing SCAI repressor function for MKL/SRF gene expression.DISCUSSIONThis study examining MKL expression and function in neurons has yielded several important findings. Quantitative PCR analysis with cDNA derived from several tissues revealed that, unlike the broad distribution of MKL1 mRNA, MKL2 mRNA is enriched in the brain (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, the in situ hybridization study showed that MKL2 is selectively expressed in several forebrain areas (Fig. 1, C and D). Characterization of the developmental profile of MKL2 mRNA showed that its expression rises during the postnatal week and is sustained into adulthood (Fig. 1, F–H). Taking our previous study into consideration, the up-regulation of MKL2 expression is similar to that of MKL1 expression during brain development (25Shiota J. Ishikawa M. Sakagami H. Tsuda M. Baraban J.M. Tabuchi A. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 1778-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although several studies including ours indicate that MKL1 and MKL2 function as the SRF coactivators and modulators of neuronal morphology (5Knöll B. Kretz O. Fiedler C. Alberti S. Schütz G. Frotscher M. Nordheim A. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 23Tabuchi A. Estevez M. Henderson J.A. Marx R. Shiota J. Nakano H. Baraban J.M. J.

Cortex. 2010; 20: 1915-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, and this study), MKL2 appears to be expressed in different areas of the brain and is more confined to the forebrain compared with the levels of MKL1 in the brain. As such, it is plausible that MKL1 and MKL2 play different roles in neuronal development and function. Moreover, MKL1 mutant mice display a different phenotype from MKL2, i.e. the failure to maintain a differentiated state of mammary myoepithelial cells during lactation (42Li S. Chang S. Qi X. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5797-5808Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 43Sun Y. Boyd K. Xu W. Ma J. Jackson C.W. Fu A. Shillingford J.M. Robinson G.W. Hennighausen L. Hitzler J.K. Ma Z. Morris S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5809-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A null mutation in the MKL2 gene displays an embryonic lethality phenotype, due to a spectrum of cardiovascular defects (44Li J. Zhu X. Chen M. Cheng L. Zhou D. Lu M.M. Du K. Epstein J.A. Parmacek M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 8916-8921Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) or because of the cardiac outflow tract (45Oh J. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15122-15127Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To understand precisely the functional differences between MKL1 and MKL2 in the brain, further studies aimed at finding molecules that interact with the MKL family members in the brain and the assessment of the role of the MKL1/2-SRF signaling pathway on neuronal development and function in vivo, especially in conditional MKL knock-out mice, are warranted.We have demonstrated that activin is an extracellular ligand upstream of MKL/SRF that promotes the dendritic complexity of cortical neurons (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6 and supplemental Fig. S5). Activin-induced dendritic complexity was observed to change slowly (supplemental Fig. S3) and was dependent on de novo protein and RNA synthesis (Fig. 4). In addition, MKL up-regulated the promoter of the β-actin gene, which is a cytoskeletal SRF target gene in cortical neurons (supplemental Fig. S9). In relation to dendritic spine morphology, activin increases the spine length of hippocampal neurons in a protein and RNA synthesis-independent manner (36Shoji-Kasai Y. Ageta H. Hasegawa Y. Tsuchida K. Sugino H. Inokuchi K. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3830-3837Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, our observation that activin promotes dendritic complexity may represent a late phase phenomenon that occurs after an increase in the number or strength of synaptic contacts that are made during the early phase of response to activin.What is the mechanism by which activin can transduce the signal to MKL in regulating dendritic morphology? We found that both MKL1 and MKL2 are localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in cortical neurons, and a drastic change in the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of the total amounts of MKL was not observed even when cells were stimulated with activin (supplemental Fig. S7). The expression levels of MKL1 and MKL2 were also not altered (data not shown). On the other hand, the cytoplasmic localization of SCAI, a repressor for MKL/SRF transcription, was observed to increase by activin-stimulated neurons (Fig. 7). Furthermore, overexpression of SCAI blocked activin-induced SRF transcriptional activation and dendritic complexity (Fig. 8). Collectively, these findings suggest that the exclusion of SCAI from the nucleus, rather than direct modulation of MKL, plays a major role in activin-induced dendritic complexity. These observations represent evidence that SCAI influences neuronal morphology and that its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is regulated by extracellular ligands.We found that C3 transferase, which is a Rho inhibitor, dominant negative SRF, and MKL1 or MKL2 siRNA reduced the dendritic complexity of neurons in the presence or absence of activin (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6 and supplemental Fig. S8). Conversely, follistatin, an inhibitor of activin, did not affect dendritic complexity of neurons in the absence of activin (Fig. 3). MKL is regulated by Rho and actin remodeling (14Miralles F. Posern G. Zaromytidou A.I. Treisman R. Cell. 2003; 113: 329-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 46Stern S. Debre E. Stritt C. Berger J. Posern G. Knöll B. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 4512-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation, which partially depends upon Rho, can modulate the transcriptional function of the MKL family (14Miralles F. Posern G. Zaromytidou A.I. Treisman R. Cell. 2003; 113: 329-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 47Muehlich S. Wang R. Lee S.M. Lewis T.C. Dai C. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 6302-6313Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, these findings indicate that constitutive MKL/SRF transcription in unstimulated cortical neurons, at least in part, contributes to dendritic complexity in a Rho-dependent manner.BDNF and NGF are the upstream signals that regulate neuronal morphology. Recent evidence suggests that BDNF and NGF also activate MKL/SRF transcriptional responses (24Kalita K. Kharebava G. Zheng J.J. Hetman M. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10020-10032Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 26Wickramasinghe S.R. Alvania R.S. Ramanan N. Wood J.N. Mandai K. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 2008; 58: 532-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although it is unknown whether BDNF and NGF affect dendritic morphology in an MKL-dependent manner, it would be interesting to examine whether such neurotrophin signals and activin signals converge on dendritic morphology via a common pathway, such as the cytoplasmic retention of SCAI, or convey distinct information spatiotemporally.Activin is known to regulate a variety of biological processes, especially brain functions such as adult neurogenesis and anxiety-related behavior (38Ageta H. Murayama A. Migishima R. Kida S. Tsuchida K. Yokoyama M. Inokuchi K. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 48Zheng F. Adelsberger H. Müller M.R. Fritschy J.M. Werner S.

Cell. 2009; 139: 814-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Elucidating whether such activin-regulated neuronal function is also mediated by the MKL family is important and may shed light on elucidating the novel mechanism by which structural alteration links to gene expression for neuronal plasticity.

Kremmer E. Ivaska J. Nollau P. Grosse R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, SRF-driven transcriptional regulation appears to be more complicated because of the presence of novel MKL-interacting cofactors. However, it remains unclear as to whether MKL1, MKL2, and SCAI play different roles in several biological processes through the regulation of their own target genes in neurons.The transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily plays important roles in various cellular processes associated with cell growth, differentiation, and development (16Massagué J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar, 17Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Nat.

Signal. 2009; 7: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To regulate such a wide variety of cellular functions, TGF-β binds to specific receptors and activates a multitude of signals, including the canonical pathway that promotes phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad2 and Smad3 (19Xu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1759: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and the noncanonical pathway that activates ERK, p38 MAP kinases, or Rho GTPases (20Zhang Y.E. Cell Res. 2009; 19: 128-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that TGF-β signaling also regulates SRF (21Qiu P. Feng X.H. Li L. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 1407-1420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 22Morita T. Mayanagi T. Sobue K. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1027-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Recently, a study showed that TGF-β1, a member of the TGF-β superfamily, activates SRF-dependent cytoskeletal genes or Smad3-dependent genes via nuclear translocation of MKL. This process may be involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which occurs during embryonic development and tumor progression (22Morita T. Mayanagi T. Sobue K. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1027-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether MKL family members mediate TGF-β signaling in the brain.In neurons, MKL1 regulates SRF-mediated transcription through the RhoA or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-induced ERK1/2 signaling pathway (23Tabuchi A. Estevez M. Henderson J.A. Marx R. Shiota J. Nakano H. Baraban J.M. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24Kalita K. Kharebava G. Zheng J.J. Hetman M. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10020-10032Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, MKL1 is highly expressed in the forebrain and regulates the neuronal morphology of cortical or hippocampal neurons (5Knöll B. Kretz O. Fiedler C. Alberti S. Schütz G. Frotscher M. Nordheim A. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 25Shiota J. Ishikawa M. Sakagami H. Tsuda M. Baraban J.M. Tabuchi A. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 1778-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). MKL1 may also be involved in nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced axonal growth of sensory neurons (26Wickramasinghe S.R. Alvania R.S. Ramanan N. Wood J.N. Mandai K. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 2008; 58: 532-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These observations imply that MKL family members participate in the regulation of neuronal morphology through regulating actin-based morphological changes or by controlling the expression of SRF-targeted cytoskeletal genes. In contrast to several reports on the function of MKL1, the expression and function of MKL2 in the brain remain unresolved. Furthermore, there is little information describing the kinds of extracellular ligands that potentially act upstream of the MKL family to regulate dendritic morphology. In the present study, we first investigated the pattern of MKL2 expression in the developing and adult brain and assessed whether MKL2 regulates SRF transcription and the morphology of rat cortical neurons. Furthermore, we found that activin, a member of the TGF-β superfamily, promoted dendritic complexity through nuclear export of SCAI and removing SCAI repressor function for MKL/SRF gene expression. Serum response factor (SRF) 4The abbreviations used are: SRFserum response factorCREcAMP response elementCREBcAMP response element-binding proteinLucluciferaseMKLmegakaryoblastic leukemiaSCAIsuppressor of cancer cell invasionSRFΔdominant negative SRF mutant. is a transcription factor that binds to a consensus sequence CC(A/T)6GG (called the CArG box), which is present in the promoters of several immediate-early or cytoskeletal genes (1Treisman R.

Several studies have demonstrated that deletion mutants of SRF in the mouse brain result in the attenuation of activity-dependent expression of immediate-early genes, impair synaptic plasticity and learning (2Ramanan N.

This second, and committed, step in lipid A biosynthesis is a target for antibiotic development. LpxC was previously identified as a mononuclear Zn(II) metalloenzyme; however, LpxC is 6–8-fold more active with the oxygen-sensitive Fe(II) cofactor (Hernick, M., Gattis, S. G., Penner-Hahn, J.

The metal bound to LpxC purified from Escherichia coli grown in minimal medium is mainly Fe(II). However, the ratio of iron/zinc bound to LpxC varies with the metal content of the medium. Furthermore, the iron/zinc ratio bound to native LpxC, determined by activity assays, has a similar dependence on the growth conditions. LpxC has significantly higher affinity for Zn(II) compared with Fe(II) with KD values of 60 ± 20 pm and 110 ± 40 nm, respectively. However, in vivo concentrations of readily exchangeable iron are significantly higher than zinc, suggesting that Fe(II) is the thermodynamically favored metal cofactor for LpxC under cellular conditions. These data indicate that LpxC expressed in E. coli grown in standard medium predominantly exists as the Fe(II)-enzyme. However, the metal cofactor in LpxC can switch between iron and zinc in response to perturbations in available metal ions.

Gram-negative bacteria are important targets in the continuing fight against antibiotic-resistant infections. The development of new antibiotics to treat infections caused by resistant organisms is critically needed and will require novel targets. One potential source of targets in Gram-negative bacteria is the lipid A biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 1A) (1Jackman J.E. Fierke C.A. Tumey L.N. Pirrung M. Uchiyama T. Tahir S.H. Hindsgaul O. Raetz C.R.

However, recent evidence has shown that LpxC is more active with Fe(II) as its metal ion cofactor compared with Zn(II) (18Hernick M. Gattis S.G. Penner-Hahn J.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 2246-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This increase in activity may correlate with a change in the ground state metal geometry from 4-coordinate in ZnLpxC to 5-coordinate in the Fe(II)-enzyme (18Hernick M. Gattis S.G. Penner-Hahn J.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 2246-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that facilitates catalysis by enhancing coordination and polarization of the carbonyl group of the substrate (Fig. 1C).

O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2003; 300: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 26Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2001; 292: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar); however, the Fe(II) redox state that activates LpxC oxidizes to Fe(III) in air (18Hernick M. Gattis S.G. Penner-Hahn J.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 2246-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not yet clear which metal ion activates LpxC in vivo. Both iron and zinc exist in high amounts in the cell, with total concentrations around 0.2 mm in Escherichia coli (26Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2001; 292: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). However, the concentrations of the readily exchangeable, or “free,” metal ions are vastly different. Although estimates vary, the best data available for readily exchangeable Fe(II) and Zn(II) come from mammalian cells, where estimates indicate that [Zn(II)free] is picomolar (10–400 pm) (27Bozym R.A.

The combination of the higher concentration of readily exchangeable Fe(II) and the enhanced reactivity of Fe(II)-bound LpxC (18Hernick M. Gattis S.G. Penner-Hahn J.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 2246-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) suggest that the native cofactor bound to LpxC in E. coli might be Fe(II) rather than Zn(II). To test this hypothesis, we developed rapid purification methods and activity assays to analyze the metal ion status of LpxC in vivo. Using these methods, we demonstrate that under normal growth conditions iron-bound LpxC predominates. However, the ratio of iron/zinc bound to LpxC depends on the cellular metal content. Although LpxC binds Zn(II) with much higher affinity than Fe(II), the higher cellular concentration of Fe(II)free contributes to the formation of Fe(II)-bound LpxC in vivo. In summary, these data indicate that Fe(II) is the biologically relevant cofactor for LpxC under common growth conditions, although metal switching occurs in response to metal availability. Furthermore, metal switching may be important for regulating the LpxC activity upon changes in cellular conditions. All solutions were prepared in “metal-free” plasticware, with reagents that did not contain extraneous metal ions and/or were treated with Chelex (Bio-Rad). The metal content of solutions, reagents, and proteins was measured by inductively coupled plasma emission mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Dr. Ted Huston, University of Michigan).

An NcoI restriction site was introduced at the C-terminal stop codon of LpxC by using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the primer 5′-CCT TCA GCT GTA CTG GCA CCA TGG GGA TCC GAA TTC GAG CTC CG-3′ and its reverse complement. The ZZ tag insert was amplified using PCR from the ZZ region of the commercial vector pEZZ (Amersham Biosciences) with the introduction of XhoI and EcoRI restriction sites as well as a stop codon at the 3′ end (forward primer 1, 5′-CGA TGA ACT CGA GGA CAA CAA ATT CAA CAA AG-3′, and reverse primer 1, 5′-TAA AGA ATT CTC AGG TTT CTA GAT TCG CGT CTA CTT TCG G-3′). The DNA fragment was extended using PCR amplification to add a TEV-protease cleavage site and an NcoI restriction site using the forward primer 2, 5′-ATG ACT TGC AAC CCA TGG GAG AAC CTG TAC TTC CAG GGT CTC GAG GAC AAC-3′, and the reverse primer 1 (see above). The PCR product and pLpxC plasmid containing the new NcoI restriction site were digested with NcoI and EcoRI and ligated together, catalyzed by T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs), to create the expression plasmid pEcC63ALpxC-ZZ. The plasmid sequence was verified by the University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core. The presence of the ZZ tag does not alter the LpxC activity or product affinity. However, the activity of the LpxC-ZZ fusion protein is more sensitive to freeze/thaw cycles than the untagged LpxC (data not shown). E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pC63ALpxC-ZZ were grown in Chemically Defined Medium (CDM) (36Outten F.W. Outten C.E. Hale J. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31024-31029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Protein expression was induced when the cells reached an A620 of 0.6 by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside along with the addition of either no added metals, 5–20 μm ZnSO4, 5–20 μm ferric ammonium citrate, or both metal supplements, and the cells were incubated overnight at 30 °C. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed once with 5 mm CaCl2 and twice with 10 mm Mops, pH 7. Control experiments demonstrate that 10 mm Ca(II) has no effect on the activity of ZnLpxC or apo-LpxC. The washed cell pellets from 100 ml of growth medium were transferred to an anaerobic glove box, resuspended in 3 ml of pulldown buffer (40 mm Mops, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm TCEP, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), and lysed by incubation with lysozyme (1 mg/ml) at room temperature for 15–30 min. The tubes were sealed with parafilm and removed from the glove box, and the cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 15–30 min). The sealed tubes were transferred back into the glove box; a portion of cleared lysate (200 μl) was set aside for ICP-MS analysis, and the remaining cleared lysate was incubated with 100 μl of IgG-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 30 min. The IgG-Sepharose beads were washed with 3× 1 ml of pulldown buffer, resuspended in 297 μl of pulldown buffer, and EcC63A LpxC and metal ions were eluted from the IgG beads by either incubation with 3 μl of AcTEVTM protease (10 units/μl, Invitrogen) or 10 mm nitric acid at room temperature overnight. The metals in the eluate were analyzed by ICP-MS. The concentration of EcC63A LpxC in the eluate was determined using the Bradford assay (Sigma) with purified LpxC as the standard. For control experiments, purified apo-LpxC-ZZ (100 μm) was reconstituted with 1 eq of either ZnSO4 or FeCl2 in the anaerobic glove box. The holo-LpxC (9 μm final) was then diluted into cell lysate prepared from BL21(DE3) cells transformed with the pEcC63A plasmid, encoding LpxC without a ZZ tag, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The lysate was then applied to IgG-agarose beads and washed as described above, and the bound LpxC-ZZ was removed by incubation in 10 mm nitric acid overnight followed by ICP-MS analysis of metal ions in the eluate. Chemically Defined Medium (CDM) (36Outten F.W. Outten C.E. Hale J. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31024-31029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) (supplemented with 0–20 μm ZnSO4 and/or ferric ammonium citrate) was inoculated with BL21(DE3) cells and grown in a shaker (250 rpm) overnight at 37 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellets resuspended in 20 mm Bistris propane, 10 mm TCEP, pH 7.5. The cells were washed, lysed, and clarified as described for the pulldown assays above. Metal ion concentrations in the cleared lysate were determined by ICP-MS analysis. The cleared lysate was diluted 10-fold into assay buffer prior to measurement of activity (see below) using 200 nm substrate. The LpxC activity in the cleared lysates was measured either immediately in the glove box or after 2.5 h of incubation in air. The ratio of iron and zinc bound to LpxC was estimated from the activity measured either anaerobically (A0), reflecting the activity of both ZnLpxC and FeLpxC, or after 2.5 h of incubation in air (A2.5) reflecting the activity due to ZnLpxC, assuming that all of the FeLpxC forms ZnLpxC under these conditions (18Hernick M. Gattis S.G. Penner-Hahn J.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 2246-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Equation 1 was used to describe the activity at A0, where SZn and SFe are the specific activity of Zn- and FeLpxC, respectively, whereas EZn and EFe are the concentration of Zn- and FeLpxC, respectively. Using the ∼6-fold higher activity of FeLpxC relative to ZnLpxC (EFe/EZn = 6) (18Hernick M. Gattis S.G. Penner-Hahn J.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 2246-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), A0 was solved in terms of the zinc enzyme and Etot (Equation 2). Using the relationship A2.5 = SZn·Etot, the EFe/Etot ratio in the anaerobic sample was calculated (Equation 3), and the EFe/EZn ratio was obtained by conservation of mass. To demonstrate that the native activity observed was specifically due to LpxC activity, control assays were performed with the LpxC-specific hydroxamate inhibitor L-161,240 (18Hernick M. Gattis S.G. Penner-Hahn J.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 2246-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).A0=SZnEZn+SFeEFe(Eq. 1) A0ETot =6SZn−5SZnEZnETot(Eq. 2) EZnETot=6A2.5−A05A2.5(Eq. 3) LpxC activity was measured as described previously (16Hernick M.

For native activity measurements, assays were performed in 20 mm Bistris propane, 10 mm TCEP, pH 7.5, bovine serum albumin (BSA, fatty acid-free, 1 mg/ml), and [14C]UDP-3-O-(3-hydroxymyristoyl)-N-acetyl-glucosamine (200 nm). Mixtures were pre-equilibrated at 30 °C, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of cell lysate. LpxC assays were also carried out in Fe(II) buffers for affinity determinations, as described below. After incubation for various times, the reactions were quenched by the addition of sodium hydroxide, which also cleaves the myristate substituent for ease of separation. Substrate and product were separated on PEI-cellulose TLC plates (0.1 m guanidinium HCl) and quantified by scintillation counting. Initial rates of product formation (<20% reaction) were determined from these data. To remove contaminating metal ions, ultrafiltration devices (Microcon molecular weight cutoff of 30,000) were incubated with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 500 μm EDTA, 100 mm dipicolinic acid for 30 min (500 μl), followed by 3× 500-μl washes with ultrapure water. To examine metal exchange in vitro, 10 μm LpxC C63A with either bound Zn(II) or Fe(II) was incubated in an anaerobic chamber with various concentrations of ZnSO4 or FeCl2 (0–300 μm) for ≥15 min in 20 mm Bistris propane, pH 7.5, 10 mm TCEP. The free and bound metal ions were separated by centrifugation (3000 × g, 4 min) in an ultrafiltration device, and the metals in an equal volume of filtrate and retentate were then analyzed by ICP-MS. For Zn(II) affinity measurements, apo-LpxC C63A (1–200 μm) was incubated in a metal ion and pH buffer containing 1 mm nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), 5 mm Mops, pH 7, 2.5 μm dipicolinic acid, and 0–0.5 mm Zntot (0–3.3 nm Znfree) at 30 °C for 30 min in an anaerobic chamber (39McCall K.A. Fierke C.A. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 40McCall K.A. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3979-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Free and bound metal were separated by ultrafiltration, described above, and metal ions were measured by ICP-MS. The concentration of Znfree in the metal buffers was calculated using the program MINEQL+ (Environmental Research software). The value of KDZn was obtained by fitting a binding isotherm to these data. The affinity of LpxC for Fe(II) was measured by assaying catalytic activity in the presence of varying free Fe(II) concentrations in an anaerobic glove box in 1 mm NTA, 5 mm Mops, pH 7, serving as both a pH and metal buffer. The assays contained 0–950 μm total iron (Fe(II)free 0–2.6 μm, as calculated by MINEQL+ (Environmental Research Software)), and 10 nm LpxC, in the presence of 1 mg/ml BSA. The Fe(II) affinity of LpxC was unchanged by pre-equilibrating the BSA with a buffered Fe(II) solution. The assay mixtures, containing all components except substrate, were incubated for 4 h on ice followed by 30 min at 30 °C in the anaerobic glove box. Assays were initiated by the addition of substrate (200 nm final), and processed as described above. The affinity is not dependent on the concentration of metal buffer. The first order rate constant for Me(II) dissociation from LpxC was measured by the time-dependent loss of activity upon incubation with EDTA. LpxC reconstituted with stoichiometric Zn(II) or Fe(II) was diluted into assay buffer containing 1 mm EDTA at 30 °C. At various times (0–30 min) an aliquot was diluted 100-fold into assay buffer (2 nm LpxC, 200 nm substrate). The reactions were quenched by the addition of sodium hydroxide and analyzed as described above. A single exponential was fit to the initial rates as a function of time. To measure the effect of fatty acids on metal dissociation kinetics, 100 μm palmitate was incubated with Me(II)-LpxC for 1 h on ice prior to dilution into EDTA at 30 °C. LpxC purified from E. coli was previously shown to contain bound Zn(II); however, this protein was purified under aerobic conditions with 2 mm dithiothreitol as the reducing agent (15Jackman J.E. Raetz C.R. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1902-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which is not sufficient to prevent oxidation of bound Fe(II) (18Hernick M. Gattis S.G. Penner-Hahn J.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 2246-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Subsequent experiments demonstrated that under anaerobic conditions Fe(II)-bound LpxC is 6–8-fold more active than ZnLpxC (18Hernick M. Gattis S.G. Penner-Hahn J.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 2246-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The absorbance spectrum of Fe(II)-bound LpxC has a broad peak with a maximum at 420 nm (ε420 = 1080 m−1 cm−1) (supplemental Fig. S1), similar to the spectra of other low spin non-heme Fe(II) complexes (41Grzyska P.K.

Gattis S.G. Penner-Hahn J.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 2246-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To clarify the identity of the biologically relevant metal ion cofactor, we purified LpxC under anaerobic conditions to re-examine the identity of the native metal cofactor. For all of these experiments, we used a previously characterized LpxC variant, EcC63A (18Hernick M. Gattis S.G. Penner-Hahn J.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 2246-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), that has high catalytic activity but reduced affinity for metal ions at the inhibitory site. This protein was fused to a cleavable C-terminal ZZ tag (33Nilsson B. Forsberg G. Hartmanis M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 34Nilsson B. Moks T.

LpxC-ZZ was induced in BL21(DE3) cells grown in minimal medium containing varied metal supplements and rapidly isolated by incubation with IgG beads followed by elution with either nitric acid or TEV protease. The concentration of metals and protein in the column eluate were determined by ICP-MS and Bradford assays, respectively. This method minimizes contamination of LpxC by adventitious metal ions. Control experiments using cells containing LpxC without the ZZ tag demonstrate that little or no (<0.1 μm) protein or metal ions are observed in the eluate. In general, LpxC-ZZ co-purifies with mainly Fe(II) and some Zn(II) (Table 1); no other divalent met"

https://openalex.org/W2149214195,"Sertoli cells supply germ cells with nutrients, including highly polyunsaturated fatty acids (hPUFAs), which are essential for testicular function. We have previously reported high expression of lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT)3 in mature mouse testis and suggested an arachidonoyl-transferase activity to LPA. To investigate the role of LPAAT3 in the storage and release of PUFAs, TM4 Sertoli cells were stably transfected with LPAAT3-small hairpin (sh)RNA. Arachidonoyl-, eicosapentaenoyl-, and docosapentaenoyl-containing phosphatidylcholine (PC) and linoleoyl-containing phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidylglycerol were significantly decreased as determined by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Expression of murine LPAAT3 in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells had essentially an opposite effect. The level of polyunsaturated PC correlated with cellular levels of free docosapentaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid in TM4 and CHO-K1 cells, respectively. Activity assays using microsomal preparations as a source of LPAAT3 revealed an excessive PA synthesis from LPA acceptors for docosahexaenoyl-, arachidonoyl- and less pronounced for linoleoyl-CoA. We propose that the efficient incorporation of hPUFAs into PA-the precursor of several phospholipids, including PC-and the selective increase of the polyunsaturated PC pool in TM4 Sertoli cells might be required for the controlled release of hPUFAs and their supply to germ cells."

Here we demonstrate that MBNL3 regulates the splicing pattern of the muscle transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 (Mef2) by promoting exclusion of the alternatively spliced β-exon. Expression of the transcriptionally more active (+)β isoform of Mef2D was sufficient to overcome the inhibitory effects of MBNL3 on muscle differentiation. These data suggest that MBNL3 antagonizes muscle differentiation by disrupting Mef2 β-exon splicing. MBNL3 regulates Mef2D splicing by directly binding to intron 7 downstream of the alternatively spliced exon in the pre-mRNA. The RNA binding activity of MBNL3 requires the CX7CX4–6CX3H zinc finger domains. Using a cell culture model of myotonic dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy patient tissue, we have evidence that expression of CUG expanded RNAs can lead to an increase in MBNL3 expression and a decrease in Mef2D β-exon splicing.

https://openalex.org/W1982134910,"Background Xenotropic murine leukaemia virus-related virus (XMRV) is a recently discovered human gammaretrovirus with yet unknown prevalence and transmission route(s). Its presence in prostate stromal fibroblasts and prostatic secretions suggests that XMRV might be sexually transmitted. We chose to study a compartment closely connected to the prostate, a location where XMRV was detected in independent studies. Seminal plasma samples from HIV-1 infected men were examined as they have an increased probability of acquiring sexually transmitted pathogens. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied the prevalence of XMRV in 93 seminal plasma samples of 54 HIV-1 infected men living in The Netherlands with a nested PCR amplification specifically targeting the XMRV gag gene. As a control for the presence and integrity of retrovirus particles, HIV-1 was amplified from the same samples with a PCR amplification targeting the env gene of the virus, or HIV-1 was quantified with a real-time PCR amplifying part of the pol gene. Conclusions/Significance Although HIV-1 was amplified from 25% of the seminal plasma samples, no XMRV was detected, suggesting that either the prevalence of XMRV is very low in The Netherlands, or that XMRV is not naturally present in the seminal plasma."
https://openalex.org/W2036224024,"Endothelial cells are remarkably heterogeneous in both morphology and function, and they play critical roles in the formation of multiple organ systems. In addition endothelial cell dysfunction can contribute to disease processes, including diabetic nephropathy, which is a leading cause of end stage renal disease. In this report we define the comprehensive gene expression programs of multiple types of kidney endothelial cells, and analyze the differences that distinguish them. Endothelial cells were purified from Tie2-GFP mice by cell dissociation and fluorescent activated cell sorting. Microarrays were then used to provide a global, quantitative and sensitive measure of gene expression levels. We examined renal endothelial cells from the embryo and from the adult glomerulus, cortex and medulla compartments, as well as the glomerular endothelial cells of the db/db mutant mouse, which represents a model for human diabetic nephropathy. The results identified the growth factors, receptors and transcription factors expressed by these multiple endothelial cell types. Biological processes and molecular pathways were characterized in exquisite detail. Cell type specific gene expression patterns were defined, finding novel molecular markers and providing a better understanding of compartmental distinctions. Further, analysis of enriched, evolutionarily conserved transcription factor binding sites in the promoters of co-activated genes begins to define the genetic regulatory network of renal endothelial cell formation. Finally, the gene expression differences associated with diabetic nephropathy were defined, providing a global view of both the pathogenic and protective pathways activated. These studies provide a rich resource to facilitate further investigations of endothelial cell functions in kidney development, adult compartments, and disease."
https://openalex.org/W1990919665,"Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is an important nutritional problem in India, resulting in an increased risk of severe morbidity and mortality. Periodic, high-dose vitamin A supplementation is the WHO-recommended method to prevent VAD, since a single dose can compensate for reduced dietary intake or increased need over a period of several months. However, in India only 34 percent of targeted children currently receive the two doses per year, and new strategies are urgently needed.Recent advancements in biotechnology permit alternative strategies for increasing the vitamin A content of common foods. Mustard (Brassica juncea), which is consumed widely in the form of oil by VAD populations, can be genetically modified to express high levels of beta-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A. Using estimates for consumption, we compare predicted costs and benefits of genetically modified (GM) fortification of mustard seed with high-dose vitamin A supplementation and industrial fortification of mustard oil during processing to alleviate VAD by calculating the avertable health burden in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALY).We found that all three interventions potentially avert significant numbers of DALYs and deaths. Expanding vitamin A supplementation to all areas was the least costly intervention, at $23-$50 per DALY averted and $1,000-$6,100 per death averted, though cost-effectiveness varied with prevailing health subcenter coverage. GM fortification could avert 5 million-6 million more DALYs and 8,000-46,000 more deaths, mainly because it would benefit the entire population and not just children. However, the costs associated with GM fortification were nearly five times those of supplementation. Industrial fortification was dominated by both GM fortification and supplementation. The cost-effectiveness ratio of each intervention decreased with the prevalence of VAD and was sensitive to the efficacy rate of averted mortality.Although supplementation is the least costly intervention, our findings also indicate that GM fortification could reduce the VAD disease burden to a substantially greater degree because of its wider reach. Given the difficulties in expanding supplementation to areas without health subcenters, GM fortification of mustard seed is an attractive alternative, and further exploration of this technology is warranted."

https://openalex.org/W2069475184,"The Mutyh DNA glycosylase is involved in the repair of oxidized DNA bases. Mutations in the human MUTYH gene are responsible for colorectal cancer in familial adenomatous polyposis. Since defective DNA repair genes might contribute to the increased cancer risk associated with inflammatory bowel diseases, we compared the inflammatory response of wild-type and Mutyh(-/-) mice to oxidative stress.The severity of colitis, changes in expression of genes involved in DNA repair and inflammation, DNA 8-oxoguanine levels and microsatellite instability were analysed in colon of mice treated with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). The Mutyh(-/-) phenotype was associated with a significant accumulation of 8-oxoguanine in colon DNA of treated mice. A single DSS cycle induced severe acute ulcerative colitis in wild-type mice, whereas lesions were modest in Mutyh(-/-) mice, and this was associated with moderate variations in the expression of several cytokines. Eight DSS cycles caused chronic colitis in both wild-type and Mutyh(-/-) mice. Lymphoid hyperplasia and a significant reduction in Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells were observed only in Mutyh(-/-) mice.The findings indicate that, in this model of ulcerative colitis, Mutyh plays a major role in maintaining intestinal integrity by affecting the inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W1992455867,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoded nuclear antigen (EBNA)-1 regulates virus replication and transcription, and participates in the remodeling of the cellular environment that accompanies EBV induced B-cell immortalization and malignant transformation. The putative cellular targets of these effects of EBNA-1 are largely unknown. To address this issue we have profiled the transcriptional changes induced by short- and long-term expression of EBNA-1 in the EBV negative B-cell lymphoma BJAB. Three hundred and nineteen cellular genes were regulated in a conditional transfectant shortly after EBNA-1 induction while a ten fold higher number of genes was regulated upon continuous EBNA-1 expression. Promoter analysis of the differentially regulated genes demonstrated a significant enrichment of putative EBNA-1 binding sites suggesting that EBNA-1 may directly influence the transcription of a subset of genes. Gene ontology analysis of forty seven genes that were consistently regulated independently on the time of EBNA-1 expression revealed an unexpected enrichment of genes involved in the maintenance of chromatin architecture. The interaction network of the affected gene products suggests that EBNA-1 may promote a broad rearrangement of the cellular transcription landscape by altering the expression of key components of chromatin remodeling complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2059440483,"Background Bisubstrate enzymes, such as 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (17β-HSD1), exist in solution as an ensemble of conformations. 17β-HSD1 catalyzes the last step of the biosynthesis of estradiol and, thus, it is a potentially attractive target for breast cancer treatment. Methodology/Principal Findings To elucidate the conformational transitions of its catalytic cycle, a structural analysis of all available crystal structures was performed and representative conformations were assigned to each step of the putative kinetic mechanism. To cover most of the conformational space, all-atom molecular dynamic simulations were performed using the four crystallographic structures best describing apoform, opened, occluded and closed state of 17β-HSD1 as starting structures. With three of them, binary and ternary complexes were built with NADPH and NADPH-estrone, respectively, while two were investigated as apoform. Free energy calculations were performed in order to judge more accurately which of the MD complexes describes a specific kinetic step. Conclusions/Significance Remarkably, the analysis of the eight long range trajectories resulting from this multi-trajectory/-complex approach revealed an essential role played by the backbone and side chain motions, especially of the βFαG′-loop, in cofactor and substrate binding. Thus, a selected-fit mechanism is suggested for 17β-HSD1, where ligand-binding induced concerted motions of the FG-segment and the C-terminal part guide the enzyme along its preferred catalytic pathway. Overall, we could assign different enzyme conformations to the five steps of the random bi-bi kinetic cycle of 17β-HSD1 and we could postulate a preferred pathway for it. This study lays the basis for more-targeted biochemical studies on 17β-HSD1, as well as for the design of specific inhibitors of this enzyme. Moreover, it provides a useful guideline for other enzymes, also characterized by a rigid core and a flexible region directing their catalysis."

Though numerous examples illustrate the ecological impact of invasive predators, no study has examined the genetic consequences for native populations subject to invasion. Here we capitalize on a natural experiment in which a long-term study of the brown anole lizard (Anolis sagrei) was interrupted by rat invasion. An island population that was devastated by rats recovered numerically following rat extermination. However, population genetic analyses at six microsatellite loci suggested a possible loss of genetic diversity due to invasion when compared to an uninvaded island studied over the same time frame. Our results provide partial support for the hypothesis that invasive predators can impact the genetic diversity of resident island populations."

In-vivo dose-ranging experiments with HS (dilutions 1/2-1/16) and CDN (6.25 mg/kg-100 mg/kg tid for 48 h) were performed to determine the minimal protective dilution/dose (highest survival) and the non-protective highest dilution/dose (highest mortality: HS-np dilution and CDN-np dose) over 7 days. Efficacy of CDN-np in animals pre-immunized with HS-np (combined strategy) was explored and blood bacterial clearance determined. The CDN measured protein binding was 86.9%. In-vitro, CDN significantly increased phagocytosis (vs. HS 1/10). In non pre-immunized animals, t>MIC values for CDN of approximately 35% (total) and approximately 19% (free) were associated with 100% survival. Significant differences in survival were found between HS-np alone (< or = 20%) or CDN-np alone (< or = 20%) vs. the combined strategy (90%, 60% and 60% for Stains 1, 2 and 3), with t>MIC (total/free) of 22.8%/14.3%, 26.8%/16.0%, and 22.4%/12.7% for Strains 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Prior to the second dose (8 h), median bacterial counts were significantly lower in animals surviving vs. dead at day 7.In mice (CDN protein binding similar to humans) total t>MIC values of approximately 35% (approximately 19% free) were efficacious, with a decrease in the required values in pre-immunized animals. This reinforces that immunoprotection to overcome resistance may provide lifesaving strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2054895461,"Several studies have been reported on the occurrence of sperm motility inhibiting factors in the male reproductive fluids of different mammalian species, but these proteins have not been adequately purified and characterized. A novel sperm motility inhibiting factor (MIF-II) has been purified from caprine epididymal plasma (EP) by Hydroxylapatite gel adsorption chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose ion-exchange chromatography and chromatofocusing. The MIF-II has been purified to apparent homogeneity and the molecular weight estimated by Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration is 160 kDa. MIF-II is a dimeric protein, made up of two subunits each having a molecular mass of 80 kDa as shown by SDS-PAGE. The isoelectric point of MIF-II is 5.1 as determined by chromatofocusing and isoelectric focusing. It is a heat labile protein and maximal active at the pH 6.9 to 7.5. The sperm motility inhibiting protein factor at 2 µg/ml (12.5 nM) level showed maximal motility-inhibiting activity. The observation that the epididymal plasma factor lowered the intracellular cAMP level of spermatozoa in a concentration-dependent manner suggests that it may block the motility of caprine cauda spermatozoa by interfering the cAMP dependent motility function. The results revealed that the purified protein factor has the potential of sperm motility inhibition and may serve as a vaginal contraceptive. The antibody raised against the MIF-II has the potential for enhancement of forward motility of cauda-spermatozoa. This antibody may thus be useful for solving some of the problems of male infertility due to low sperm motility."
https://openalex.org/W2075029700,"The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presents a unique system to explore links between genetic diversity and pathogens, as diversity within MHC is maintained in part by pathogen driven selection. While the majority of wildlife MHC studies have investigated species that are of conservation concern, here we characterize MHC variation in a common and broadly distributed species, the North American raccoon (Procyon lotor). Raccoons host an array of broadly distributed wildlife diseases (e.g., canine distemper, parvovirus and raccoon rabies virus) and present important human health risks as they persist in high densities and in close proximity to humans and livestock. To further explore how genetic variation influences the spread and maintenance of disease in raccoons we characterized a fragment of MHC class II DRA exon 3 (250 bp) and DRB exon 2 (228 bp). MHC DRA was found to be functionally monomorphic in the 32 individuals screened; whereas DRB exon 2 revealed 66 unique alleles among the 246 individuals screened. Between two and four alleles were observed in each individual suggesting we were amplifying a duplicated DRB locus. Nucleotide differences between DRB alleles ranged from 1 to 36 bp (0.4-15.8% divergence) and translated into 1 to 21 (1.3-27.6% divergence) amino acid differences. We detected a significant excess of nonsynonymous substitutions at the peptide binding region (P = 0.005), indicating that DRB exon 2 in raccoons has been influenced by positive selection. These data will form the basis of continued analyses into the spatial and temporal relationship of the raccoon rabies virus and the immunogenetic response in its primary host."
https://openalex.org/W1975104283,"Background The efficacy of current anticancer treatments is far from satisfactory and many patients still die of their disease. A general agreement exists on the urgency of developing molecularly targeted therapies, although their implementation in the clinical setting is in its infancy. In fact, despite the wealth of preclinical studies addressing these issues, the difficulty of testing each targeted therapy hypothesis in the clinical arena represents an intrinsic obstacle. As a consequence, we are witnessing a paradoxical situation where most hypotheses about the molecular and cellular biology of cancer remain clinically untested and therefore do not translate into a therapeutic benefit for patients. Objective To present a computational method aimed to comprehensively exploit the scientific knowledge in order to foster the development of personalized cancer treatment by matching the patient's molecular profile with the available evidence on targeted therapy. Methods To this aim we focused on melanoma, an increasingly diagnosed malignancy for which the need for novel therapeutic approaches is paradigmatic since no effective treatment is available in the advanced setting. Relevant data were manually extracted from peer-reviewed full-text original articles describing any type of anti-melanoma targeted therapy tested in any type of experimental or clinical model. To this purpose, Medline, Embase, Cancerlit and the Cochrane databases were searched. Results and Conclusions We created a manually annotated database (Targeted Therapy Database, TTD) where the relevant data are gathered in a formal representation that can be computationally analyzed. Dedicated algorithms were set up for the identification of the prevalent therapeutic hypotheses based on the available evidence and for ranking treatments based on the molecular profile of individual patients. In this essay we describe the principles and computational algorithms of an original method developed to fully exploit the available knowledge on cancer biology with the ultimate goal of fruitfully driving both preclinical and clinical research on anticancer targeted therapy. In the light of its theoretical nature, the prediction performance of this model must be validated before it can be implemented in the clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W2147637326,"Background The human Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) is a neurokine with effects on the immune system where it is involved in promoting tolerance. In this context, one of its receptors, VPAC1, has been found to be down-modulated in cells of the immune network in response to activating stimuli. In particular, the bacterial liposaccaride (LPS), a strong activator of the innate immune system, induces a rapid decrease of VPAC1 expression in monocytes and this event correlates with polymorphisms in the 3′-UTR of the gene. Methodology/Principal Findings MicroRNA 525-5p, having as putative target the 3′-UTR region of VPAC1, has been analysed for its expression in monocytes and for its role in down-modulating VPAC1 expression. We report here that miR-525-5p is promptly up-regulated in LPS-treated monocytes. This microRNA, when co-transfected in 293T cells together with a construct containing the 3′-UTR of the VPAC1 gene, significantly reduced the luciferase activity in a standard expression assay. The U937 cell line as well as primary monocytes enforced to express miR-525-5p, both down-modulate VPAC1 expression at similar extent. Conclusions/Significance Our results show that the response to an inflammatory stimulus elicits in monocytes a rapid increase of miR-525-5p that targets a signaling pathway involved in the control of the immune homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2097689786,"Kv2.1 channels, which are expressed in brain, heart, pancreas, and other organs and tissues, are important targets for drug design. Flecainide and propafenone are known to block Kv2.1 channels more potently than other Kv channels. Here, we sought to explore structural determinants of this selectivity. We demonstrated that flecainide reduced the K+ currents through Kv2.1 channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes in a voltage- and time-dependent manner. By systematically exchanging various segments of Kv2.1 with those from Kv1.2, we determined flecainide-sensing residues in the P-helix and inner helix S6. These residues are not exposed to the inner pore, a conventional binding region of open channel blockers. The flecainide-sensing residues also contribute to propafenone binding, suggesting overlapping receptors for the drugs. Indeed, propafenone and flecainide compete for binding in Kv2.1. We further used Monte Carlo-energy minimizations to map the receptors of the drugs. Flecainide docking in the Kv1.2-based homology model of Kv2.1 predicts the ligand ammonium group in the central cavity and the benzamide moiety in a niche between S6 and the P-helix. Propafenone also binds in the niche. Its carbonyl group accepts an H-bond from the P-helix, the amino group donates an H-bond to the P-loop turn, whereas the propyl group protrudes in the pore and blocks the access to the selectivity filter. Thus, besides the binding region in the central cavity, certain K+ channel ligands can expand in the subunit interface whose residues are less conserved between K+ channels and hence may be targets for design of highly desirable subtype-specific K+ channel drugs.

https://openalex.org/W2085798916,"Cells respond to a variety of stresses, including unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), by phosphorylating a subunit of translation initiation factor eIF2, eIF2α. eIF2α phosphorylation inactivates the eIF2B complex. The inactivation of eIF2B not only suppresses the initiation of protein translation but paradoxically up-regulates the translation and expression of transcription factor ATF-4. Both of these processes are important for the cellular response to ER stress, also termed the unfolded protein response. Here we demonstrate that cellular response resulting from eIF2α phosphorylation is attenuated in several cancer cell lines. The deficiency of the unfolded protein response in these cells correlates with the expression of a specific isoform of a regulatory eIF2B subunit, eIF2Bδ variant 1 (V1). Replacement of total eIF2Bδ with V1 renders cells insensitive to eIF2α phosphorylation; specifically, they neither up-regulate ATF-4 and ATF-4 targets nor suppress protein translation. Expression of variant 2 eIF2Bδ in ER stress response-deficient cells restores the stress response. Our data suggest that V1 does not interact with the eIF2 complex, a requisite for eIF2B inhibition by eIF2α phosphorylation. Together, these data delineate a novel physiological mechanism to regulate the ER stress response with a large potential impact on a variety of diseases that result in ER stress."
https://openalex.org/W2161656148,"Splicing event identification is one of the most important issues in the comprehensive analysis of transcription profile. Recent development of next-generation sequencing technology has generated an extensive profile of alternative splicing. However, while many of these splicing events are between exons that are relatively close on genome sequences, reads generated by RNA-Seq are not limited to alternative splicing between close exons but occur in virtually all splicing events. In this work, a novel method, SAW, was proposed for the identification of all splicing events based on short reads from RNA-Seq. It was observed that short reads not in known gene models are actually absent words from known gene sequences. An efficient method to filter and cluster these short reads by fingerprint fragments of splicing events without aligning short reads to genome sequences was developed. Additionally, the possible splicing sites were also determined without alignment against genome sequences. A consensus sequence was then generated for each short read cluster, which was then aligned to the genome sequences. Results demonstrated that this method could identify more than 90% of the known splicing events with a very low false discovery rate, as well as accurately identify, a number of novel splicing events between distant exons."
https://openalex.org/W2095577700,"Protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane occurs at the Sec61 translocon. This has two essential subunits, the channel-forming multispanning membrane protein Sec61p/Sec61α and the tail-anchored Sss1p/Sec61γ, which has been proposed to ""clamp"" the channel. We have analyzed the function of Sss1p using a series of domain mutants and found that both the cytosolic and transmembrane clamp domains of Sss1p are essential for protein translocation. Our data reveal that the cytosolic domain is required for Sec61p interaction but that the transmembrane clamp domain is required to complete activation of the translocon after precursor targeting to Sec61p."
https://openalex.org/W1968303994,"Most Science readers will know that Steve Schneider was a giant in atmospheric science who made seminal contributions in many areas, ranging from the roles played by cloud feedbacks in the climate system to the impact of aerosol particles in “nuclear winter” scenarios. They will also be aware that he was an indefatigable scientific educator, battling especially to ensure that climate disruption and humans' role in it were explained properly to the public. They likely know that he was well recognized for his contributions to atmospheric science and public policy. He was awarded a MacArthur Foundation “genius” grant in 1992. He was a contributor to all four of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, and he was co-awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for his work on climate change.

A less well-known side of Steve is that he was a stickler for getting the science right, regardless of the politics. When we were doing the nuclear winter studies in the early 1980s, he was constantly working to see that all public statements were as accurate as possible. When he and Starley Thompson reexamined the nuclear winter predictions a few years later, and found them to be less dire, Steve did not hesitate to make the revisions public, which led to the currency of the alternative term “nuclear autumn.” That's the way he was on all issues. Given new data, he did not hesitate to modify his views.

In the 1970s, we had many discussions of the responsibilities of “public scientists.” We agreed that one must first explain the scientific consensus, then say if you agreed with it (and if not, why not), and then give your personal opinion of what policy choices should be made. Being a scientist does not relieve one of the obligations of a citizen to speak out. In my experience, no scientist felt that obligation more strongly, or showed more dedication and courage in meeting it, than Steve Schneider. To the very last, he worked to educate the public and decision makers, ignoring illness and anonymous death threats from persons who opposed the scientific consensus on climate change.

His interest in the effects of climate disruption brought him together with Terry Root, a leader in studying its effects on organisms, especially on the distribution and timing of bird migration. Beginning in the 1990s he began to learn all he could about birds, and under Terry's guidance he quickly became an avid birder. They married and began a long-term collaboration that included influential papers, as well as many bird-watching and environmental exploration expeditions.

Steve also worked with economists and other experts on evaluating the costs and benefits of implementing various solutions to the problems of climate change. He brought attention to efforts that assessed potential impacts of climate change on agriculture, such as drought and soil erosion from flooding, and on public health, such as the spread of tropical disease vectors to higher latitudes.

Steve's nonscientific enthusiasms, aside from Terry, were many, including bird prints, wine tasting, and good food, accompanied by a fine sense of humor and a love of music. Steve delighted in playing folk songs and rock tunes on his 12-string guitar. He said he started playing as an undergraduate at Columbia in the 1960s when, in his words, “guitar-playing was a substitute for a personality.” He wasn't shy about singing, despite a less than velvety voice. Steve and Terry hosted many dinners that were followed by spirited guitar-strumming and singing to tunes by Bob Dylan, Simon and Garfunkel, and others. Steve and Stanford environmental economist Larry Goulder collaborated and performed publicly a few original songs as well, including their “Climate Change Blues,” and a warped version of the Beatles' “When I'm 64.”

In 2001, Steve was diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma. In his typical fashion, he immediately set out to learn everything about it, ably assisted by Terry. He collaborated with his doctors to design a course of treatment that led to remission. He underwent a bone-marrow transplant, a difficult and painful treatment, but he did more than endure it stoically. Whenever we scrubbed and gowned to visit him in his hospital room, we would find him sitting up in bed with a computer on his lap and Terry handing him papers, working on e-mail or a manuscript, and ready with a quick joke about his condition.

Knowing him well, I have nonetheless been stunned by the outpouring immediately after his death from fellow scientists and former students testifying to Steve's generosity in mentoring others. He was always happy to give time to my wife Anne and me, checking our writing on climate for accuracy and explaining fine points of atmospheric physics. I knew how open he was with students, but I didn't fully realize the scale of his giving. He wrote a book on his medical battle, and then gave much of his time to counsel others with the ailment. His generosity toward others persisted through years of struggle with a debilitating and eventually deadly disease.

When Anne and I try to sort out our impressions of Steve, his brilliant science doesn't come first to mind. It's his rollicking sense of humor, his descriptions of the wine he was serving us, sitting with him and Terry having yak butter tea with the queen of Bhutan, or maybe most of all seeing a tree covered with synchronously flashing fireflies in New Britain when searching for owls with our mutual friend, Tom Lovejoy. Steve was all the usual superlatives—a giant in his field, a wonderful friend, a hero, and more. He was a climate researcher who was also a man for all seasons. His myriad friends will miss him intensely, and so, I'm afraid, will billions of people who never heard of him, whose lives he so determinedly strove to improve.
