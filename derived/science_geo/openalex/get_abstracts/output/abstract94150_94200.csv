https://openalex.org/W1995384855,"Lifelong dietary restriction beginning at 3 to 6 weeks of age in rodents is known to decelerate the rate of aging, increase mean and maximum life-spans, and inhibit the occurrence of many spontaneous cancers. Little is known about the effects of dietary restriction started in middle age. In the experiments now reported the food intake of 12- to 13-month-old mice of two long-lived strains was restricted by using nutrient-enriched diets in accordance with the concept of ""undernutrition without malnutrition."" The mice on the restricted diet averaged 10 to 20 percent increases in mean and maximum survival times compared to the control mice. Spontaneous lymphoma was inhibited by the food restriction."
https://openalex.org/W2093517417,"Mathematical models for the dynamics of directly transmitted viral and bacterial infections are guides to the understanding of observed patterns in the age specific incidence of some common childhood diseases of humans, before and after the advent of vaccination programs. For those infections that show recurrent epidemic behavior, the interepidemic period can be related to parameters characterizing the infection (such as latent and infectious periods and the average age of first infection); this relation agrees with the data of a variety of childhood diseases. Criteria for the eradication of a disease are given, in terms of the proportion of the population to be vaccinated and the age-specific vaccination schedule. These criteria are compared with a detailed analysis of the vaccination programs against measles and whooping cough in Britain, and estimates are made of the levels of protection that would be needed to eradicate these diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2016429415,Development of autoimmune disease in female New Zealand hybrid mice was dramatically modified by classical conditioning of immunosuppression. Groups of animals received each week a solution of sodium saccharin (conditioned stimulus). One group of conditioned animals received an injection of cyclophosphamide (the unconditioned stimulus) after half of the weekly occasions when they received the saccharin solution. The rate of development of proteinuria and mortality were significantly retarded in these conditioned mice relative to untreated controls and nonconditioned animals that received unpaired treatment with saccharin and cyclophosphamide.
https://openalex.org/W1965298203,"More than 400 harbor seals, most of them immature, died along the New England coast between December 1979 and October 1980 of acute pneumonia associated with influenza virus, A/Seal/Mass/1/180 (H7N7). The virus has avian characteristics, replicates principally in mammals, and causes mild respiratory disease in experimentally infected seals. Concurrent infection with a previously undescribed mycoplasma or adverse environmental conditions may have triggered the epizootic. The similarities between this epizootic and other seal mortalities in the past suggest that these events may be linked by common biological and environmental factors."

https://openalex.org/W2091442911,"Pregnant rats underfed in the first 2 weeks of gestation had offspring with normal body weight at birth and weaning. However, starting at about 5 weeks of age the male offspring became hyperphagic and gained more weight than the controls. The female offspring did not overeat and did not become obese. Both male and female progeny showed increased fat cell size as adults. In males the epididymal and retroperitoneal fat pads were significantly enlarged nd adipocytes in these pads were hypertrophied. In females and fat pads were not enlarged, but adipocytes in the parametrial pads were hypertrophied."
https://openalex.org/W2032795116,"Analysis of single-trial electroencephalogram waveforms in a reaction time task demonstrated that the onset and offset values of event-related potentials can be used as indices of the duration of information processing. Two negative waves have been identified which peak at different times in different regions of the scalp, with the second overlapping the last part of the first. These waves are related in different ways to the duration of perceptual processing."

https://openalex.org/W2055985933,"A monoclonal antibody was used to prepare immunoaffinity columns that efficiently bind monoamine oxidase B activity but not monoamine oxidase A activity from detergent extracts of human liver mitochondria. The only discrete polypeptide component that eluted from affinity columns with potassium thiocyanate migrated in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with an apparent molecular weight of 59,000, as expected for human monoamine oxidase B. These results support the hypothesis that there is an intrinsic structural difference between monoamine oxidase A and B and demonstrate that immunoaffinity chromatography can physically resolve the two enzyme species in liver extracts."
https://openalex.org/W2082872950,"The finding that some opioid-mediated forms of stress-induced analgesia are antagonized by hypophysectomy and dexamethasone has led to the suggestion that beta-endorphin, released from the pituitary, may mediate these analgesic reactions. ""Long-term analgesia"" (an opioid-mediated form of stress-induced analgesia), which is blocked by dexamethasone and hypophysectomy, was also blocked by adrenalectomy and reinstated with corticosterone therapy. Corticosterone is proposed to play a permissive role in long-term analgesia and to be a critical hormone mediating this phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W1989288298,The integrity of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus is essential to the expression of normal circadian rhythms in rodents. Electrical stimulation of the SCN caused phase shifts and period changes in the freerunning feeding rhythms of rats and activity rhythms of hamsters. The phase response curve for SCN stimulation appears to parallel that for light pulses. These findings strengthen the hypothesis derived from lesion studies that the SCN are the dominant light-entrained oscillators in the rodent circadian system.

https://openalex.org/W2062120671,"Queuine, a modified base found in transfer RNA, appears to be a new dietary factor because (i) previous studies have shown that mice require it for the expression of queuine-containing transfer RNA's but apparently do not synthesize it, and (ii) significant amounts of free queuine are present in common plant and animal food products."
https://openalex.org/W1988281842,"The circadian rhythm of activity in vertebrates often splits into two components after continuous exposure to constant light. This observation suggests that at least two circadian pacemakers underlie the activity rhythm. After unilateral ablation of the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei in hamsters, the splitting phenomenon was eliminated and a single rhythm of activity was established. The period of the new circadian activity rhythm different from the periods of the split rhythm and that preceding the split. These results suggest an interaction between the bilaterally paired suprachiasmatic nuclei in the generation of the circadian rhythm of activity."

https://openalex.org/W2022510243,"A multineurotransmitter neuronal system that synthesizes and secretes both acetylated and deacetylated forms of alpha-melantropin and beta-endorphin is present in rat and human brain. The N-acetylated from of alpha-melanotropin had more potent behavioral effects than the deacetylated alpha-melanotropin. In the case of beta-endorphin, however, the deacetylated form has been shown to be more potent than the acetylated form. Enzymatic N-acetylation appears to be an important regulatory process for modulating the behavioral activity of peptides secreted from the opiomelanotropinergic multineurotransmitter neuron."

The increases were delayed in most subjects and were not correlated with changes in urinary pH or creatinine excretion. The data suggest a stress-related role for beta-phenethylamine."
https://openalex.org/W2033047662,"A monoclonal antibody-producing hybrid cell line was obtained by fusing mouse myeloma cells with spleen cells from a mouse immunized with C6 glioma cells. This antibody binds to a specific cell-surface antigen that is present on C6 rat glioma cells, transformed astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, and a human glioma cell line but is absent on a normal glial cell line, fibroblasts, and primary cultures of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The antigen also appears on tumor tissue of transformed oligodendrocytes but not on normal brain tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2009304549,Chick embryos received partial eye lesions. Examination of the embryos early in development showed the partial retina projecting across the entire tectum. At later stages the partial retina projected only to the appropriate portion of the tectum. The results suggest that the retina initially projects diffusely to the tectum and that the topographically aberrant projections are eliminated during subsequent development.

https://openalex.org/W1585727248,"A 110,000-dalton plasma membrane glycoprotein of mouse cells has been identified, purified, and characterized by use of a xenogeneic monoclonal antibody. The glycoprotein was a major component of the NIH/3T3 cell surface. It contained 15% of [3H]glucosamine incorporated into cell proteins and was composed of at least 16 isomorphic variants with apparent molecular weights from 100,000 to 120,000 and isoelectric points between 6.5 and 8.1. The glycoprotein constituted 0.1% of total cell protein, as measured by the yield of purified protein, and there were over 10(6) antibody-binding sites/cell. Immunoprecipitation from pulse-chase labeled cells showed that the 110,000-dalton glycoprotein was initially synthesized as a 92,000-dalton microsomal polypeptide which gradually was converted to the mature surface form. The turnover time of the surface form was at least 20 h. The antigenic determinant recognized by the monoclonal antibody was species-specific and nonpolymorphic. It was present in high concentration on most dividing murine cells in culture, whereas the concentration in normal mouse tissues differed widely. Among lymphoid tissues, antigen concentration was enriched in bone marrow as compared to spleen and thymus. Among nonlymphoid tissues, antigen concentration was 10-fold greater in kidney than in brain, liver, and skeletal muscle. The glycoprotein was purified without loss of antigenic activity by antibody affinity chromatography. The single step procedure yielded 3 mg of pure glycoprotein from 3 g of crude cell extract. The purification and characterization of this major membrane protein provide a basis for further study of its cell surface structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W1987443758,Hypothalamic stimulation in rats both reduces escape from noxious hindbrain stimulation and sustains self-administration only when hindbrain stimulation is inescapable. Self-administration reflects an aversion-ameliorative action of brain stimulation and not a positive reinforcement process. The psychophysical testing used is offered as a model for establishing the analgesic properties of brain stimulation.
https://openalex.org/W2014343551,"A chemically defined medium, CC-494, supports the cultivation in vitro of several spiroplasmas belonging to three distinct serogroups. Medium CC-494 supports the growth of flower spiroplasmas FS 23-6 and FS SR-3 and of honey bee spiroplasma HBS AS-576. The maximal populations of the two flower spiroplasmas and honey bee spiroplasma are comparable to those cultured in the undefined medium C-3G. The growth rate for all three spiroplasmas is slower in the defined medium."

Oral laetrile significantly increased in situ cyanide concentrations, while intravenous laetrile did not. Thiosulfate administration protected embryos from the teratogenic effects of oral laetrile. The embryopathic effects of oral laetrile appear to be due to cyanide released by bacterial beta-glucosidase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1998500548,"The feasibility of electronically locating and measuring tritium-labeled macromolecules directly on dried electrophoretic gels has been demonstrated. This new procedure eliminates the usual long film exposure in autofluorography and the attendant delay in processing and data reduction. An image intensifier and electronic camera tube are used to integrate the light produced by the tritium interaction with a scintillator incorporated in the gel. Preliminary results show that, compared to film, the exposure is reduced 100 to 1000 times. The response to low activity levels is improved, and spatial resolution is maintained. A proposed instrument could be used for measuring other isotopes as well as fluorescent and visible stains."
https://openalex.org/W2066672959,"In an experiment with ten macaque monkeys (Macaca nemestrina), a combination of photorefraction and corneal reflex photography was used to measure simultaneously the plane of focus and direction of gaze while they were presented with fixation targets. The monkeys ranged in age from 2 days to 10 weeks. Some of the infants that were less than 1 month old failed to change accommodation to targets at any distance, whereas others showed limited accommodative abilities. The magnitude of the accommodative response of infants older than 4 weeks appeared to be adultlike. Infant monkey's visual acuity improves dramatically after 4 weeks. These results, which show that the improvement in spatial resolution cannot be accounted for by increased accommodative accuracy, parallel those obtained from human infants where accommodative competence is attained by about 4 months of age."

https://openalex.org/W1580149250,"Stirred cytoplasmic extracts of the yeast Saccharomyces uvarum can, on addition of trehalose, display oscillations in the metabolite concentrations. Unstirred extracts may also develop spatiotemporal structures expressed in the metabolite concentrations. In this paper we present evidence of the existence of such patterns. The latter were recorded using the optical absorption of NADH in an annular cuvette, which was rotated in a photometer. Regularly spaced wavelike spatiotemporal standing waves were observed. At certain fixed points the NADH concentration appeared to remain constant. Such phenomena may improve our understanding of biochemical morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2046194929,"The amount of red chromatic valence of the red-green opponent colors channel of the human visual system has been reported to be greatly reduced in short wavelengths when the hue-matching method is used to measure red valence instead of the more typical cancellation method. Receptive fields with a silent surround were postulated to explain the reduction, and it was emphasized that the reduced valence curve represented the true chromatic valence curve of the visual system. In the present studies the previous results are interpreted to be a direct consequence of the method and the particular matching stimuli used. It is shown that the reduction can be explained by the existing color-matching data without appealing to the silent surround hypothesis."
